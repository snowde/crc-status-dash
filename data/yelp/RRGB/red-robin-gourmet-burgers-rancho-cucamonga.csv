Graciela P.,"Ontario, CA",1,57,189,4.0,1/4/2018,"This last visit we only had to wait 15mins before we were seated, which is actually pretty good.  Each time we've been here I can honestly say we've never had a bad experience with either a burger or a server. Honestly though the only thing that sucks is the bacon they use on the burgers. They look like those little strips you microwave, not cool especially for those bacon lovers.  We've even brought the girls here for a treat to see how they liked it, since they've never been. Well all three of them loved.  Make sure to join the rewards program, they send you several good deals through the year. A free gourmet burger for your birthday too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga
Aiden S.,"Brea, CA",0,144,54,1.0,1/8/2018,"Came here for lunch recently and it was a total lousy experience. The server lacked basic customer service skills. I mean if you can't even greet and pretend to like your job you are probably going to epically fail at it hands down. My order was wrong and I never got an apology. I had to ask multiple times for condiments. The food didn't taste fresh and the temp was cold. Meanwhile adjacent to us there was a PERFECT server!  Attentive, refilling drinks, checking in etc.  You name it. Only regret was it wasn't our server. Minus 1,2,3,4 and all five if I could for the lousy service and Red Robin not caring about my experience.  In and out would have been cheaper and so satisfying!  What a big mistake coming here.

Rosa S.,"Upland, CA",86,1,1,1.0,12/24/2017,"I went to this Red Robin's today for an early dinner. I logged intoy rewards program and saw I had a 50 % off coupon that said we get half of any fire gourmet with purchase of any additional burger, entree, sandwich, or entree salad. I attached a photo as well. I showed this information to our server. Our server, John, said that this coupon would apply and that the chicken sandwich we ordered would be half off. Shortly after the manager came to our table and explained how it does not apply because I needed to get a ""big"" burger. Confused by her statement, I went to show her what my coupon said. She said , ""I know what it says I don't need to see it"". She didn't even apologize for the inconvenience that someone on her team conveyed the wrong information. Honestly, her rudeness ensued.  When our server came back he asked if everything was better now. We were blunt with him and explained that the coupon says nothing about a big burger/sandwich anywhere. He read the coupon and agreed that our confusion was valid.  The manager came back to our table and immediately took out a printed email that she got from corporate. And there it was.. ""big or fine burger"". She then added that I would have needed to order two gourmet sandwiches for this to be valid. I said okay I understand and she walked away. Didn't even apologize for the confusion. It was clear that she was very focused on proving me wrong rather than explaining the mix-up that was made.  I am writing this review to show that the coupon is infact different than the corporate email this manager received. I am also writing this review to express my frustration with how rude this manager was. Her server was more apologetic for her behavior.  Lastly, I don't want a discount. I don't want ""a reason to come back"". I don't think I'll be returning to this Red Robin's. Next time, consider the fact that customer service can outweigh a ""cheaper meal"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga
Adrienne R.,"Ontario, CA",180,240,238,2.0,10/4/2017,"Gah, no wonder these chain restaurants are going under. I remember really loving the Red Robin in Moreno Valley when I was 18 my sister and I would go every Saturday, but now 10 years later idk if it's just this location but I'd rather not chance it and spend my money here. Even with the 2 for one tavern deal, our bill was $35 (onion rings, two lemonades, chicken caprice and red tavern burger with the 2 for one deal). I didn't try any of the burgers, but the chicken caprice sandwich fell apart on a ciabatta bun that absorbed any little drop of moisture immediately apparently. Had okay flavor but was not appetizing. I had gotten this after sending the cod and shrimp duo back, which was watered down cod and since both of us have worked in fast food we both immediately were able to tell that the deep fryer oil is old because the batter on everything tasted bad. The fries tasted baked and then deep fried, just off for some reason. Would much rather spend my money at a good mom and pop for cheaper or similar pricing. The team member helping us was sweet and really personable and patient, the 2 stars are for him and nothing else about this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga
Jamie V.,"Ontario, CA",103,44,3,1.0,12/24/2017,"We came here to use a Red Robin loyalty rewards 50% off coupon that reads, in full, as follows: ""50% off any Fire-Grilled Gourmet burger with purchase of any additional burger, entree salad, sandwhich, or entree. Expires 12/29/2017. Offer valid once per day. Discount applied to lowest priced Fire-Grilled Gourmet burger."" No extra small text, no other caveats. This was the entirety of the coupon.  So with this deal in hand, we ordered a chicken sandwhich and a tavern burger. When we got our bill, Red Robin refused to honor the coupon, with the manager explaining that the coupon only applied to ""Big"" Tavern burgers, not ""Small"" ones like the one we had ordered. And therefore our order didn't qualify. Notice that the coupon does not state this extra requirement anywhere. And in fact, once we showed the manager the coupon itself, the manager PULLED OUT AN INTERNAL RED ROBIN EMAIL FROM CORPORATE explaining what the coupons ""real"" definition was. So not only are Red Robin coupons not valid as-written but apparently we're also supposed to know what Red Robin's internal policies are before we come in and try to use said coupons. Avoid this place, and perhaps this entire chain. Red Robin deals are apparently not worth the paper (or emails) they're written on.

Lol.  Food was served fast and prepared exactly as requested. Meagan frequently checked our table for water, ice tea refilled, so as fries. We appreciated that Meagan was very patient with my 8 months old grand daughter.  Here is the verdict for food: Banzai and Peppercorn burgers were all delicious, very juicy.

Viri T.,"Lemoore, CA",40,44,30,2.0,2/26/2017,On Feb. 26 2017 I came in to this earing establishment with 9 other guests and was greetly in a friendly manner. We were seated within 15 mins and waitresses came and introduced her self. Everything was going well we all order and got our food. I got a chicken cesar salad the food was nothing special very basic nothing that wow me.  The reason why I am rating it a 3 was because I had to take my daughter to the bathroom and noticed it need several things so I asked one of the short hair lady that was walking around asking guest how their meal was going. I figured she woulf be the ideal personal to let know that the bathroom needed a little tlc.  45 mind went by and I had to go to the bathroom again with my son this time. I was very upset that the bathroom situation was not address but most importantly that 2 out of the 3 bathrooms had no toilet paper and one of them did not have seat covers.

Rosalie H.,"Walnut, CA",63,118,172,5.0,1/9/2017,"First time here at this Red Robin. We usually go to the one in Glendora but moved to the IE-- so here we are. Like the other RR - it's right off the freeway. It shares a parking lot with several other restaurants so I can see how parking can sometimes be tough. We came during a weeknight and it was pretty busy. We only had to wait maybe 5 minutes though Our server was super nice despite the hustle and bustle of the evening. We ordered drinks and our favorite ...the Bleu Burger with the endless Garlic fries. We asked the fries to be brought out early since I was starving. Everything is exactly what I expected from RR.

Mia N.,"Los Angeles, CA",58,78,3,1.0,11/1/2017,"First, let call out the single good thing about this place:  The host.   He greeted us immediately, he took our information, and he got me an ice water right away.   If there was a way to separately rate him, he'd get five stars. Unfortunately, the rest of the visit didn't even warrant a single star, but Yelp won't let me go lower than one.   Our waitress took our order, and delivered the waters.   Then a half an hour went by.  We were beginning to debate simply leaving, because the waitress was obviously avoiding our table, and no manager seemed to be on duty.   The waitress suddenly appeared and gave us a half-hearted apology for the wait, claiming ""a to go order just came in for 44 burgers, so we're way behind.""  This means that either a) they knew they had a large to go order when she took our order, and it took them half an hour to inform us of the wait, or b) they took the to go order AFTER ours, and put our order behind it.   Either way, unacceptable.   She then asked us if we just wanted our fries while we waited.  So basically we were offered part of our order as a replacement?  It didn't even make sense.   But whatever, we assumed this meant our order would be out shortly. It took another 15-20 minutes for the order to finally come out, and it had quite obviously been sitting out for a good portion of that.  The burgers were warm, but not hot.  The fries, normally  a Red Robin favorite, tasted like frozen fries popped in the oven for not quite enough time.  The waitress once again began avoiding our table, taking the long way around to visit the table next to us and then walking away in the opposite direction while pointedly ignoring us.    Oh, and during this 45-50 minute wait, our drinks were refilled exactly once (before any food was ever brought out).   Once we got our food, we never got another visit from our waitress.  We paid our bill on the electronic kiosk and left. Can't say as we have any desire to ever return, either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga
Lena P.,"Ontario, CA",21,487,1384,1.0,12/28/2016,"Vegetarian review:  They use to be good but their quality went way down.  We both got the veggie burger and it was undercooked and tasted weird, I took out the patty after a few bites. Their fries were also undercooked so we requested another batch and it was the same.  Their Oreo milkshake was pretty good but it was too small, should've ordered the large.  I got a side of mac n cheese and it was pretty good, probably the only decent thing I ordered that day. Overall we were very disappointed in the main entrees this time around, we both would've rather went to Farmer Boys for our veggie burgers and fries. Cheaper and tastes much better than Red Robin.

But having tried their branch here in Foothill Blvd. in Rancho Cucamonga it was a total disappointment. Fries are hard to chew and too starchy in this branch. Their gourmet burgers are over done when you ask for ""medium well"". The service sucks as the servers take forever to attend to the table--especially last week when we dined, it was a fund raising night with the police officers and the Red Robin crew took forever to even respond to the blinking green ""call for service"" light in our table.

Emily L.,"Fontana, CA",136,86,146,4.0,5/2/2016,"First time here! I had a free burger for my birthday and it's totally worth it. I had the porterhouse burger with garlic fries and it was completely free. I'm surprised they didn't charge me for the garlic fries substitution.  The burger was pretty good. I asked for it to be cooked medium well but it was kinda dry, I'll probably go for medium next time. The garlic fries were too overwhelming. After a few pieces, I was done. Too much grease. Also, my burger was topped with 1 onion ring and it was soooooo good. I have to get that next time.  During the month of May, they have a buy one get one half off, so I suggest going now. And definitely join their rewards program. They give a lot of deals like every 10th burger is free, I think.  Also, practically everything here is BOTTOMLESS even the root beer floats.

The seats inside the waiting area was clean but not very comfortable as the cushions need to be replaced.  There were a few large parties in the dining area. The server designated to our table was busy so another one initially introduced himself as someone helping her out. We never saw her. It worked out because he was great. He was able to steer us to the items suitable to our dietary needs. The food was delivered promptly and as ordered. He checked on us; re-filling our beverages and bottomless items. They don't hold back on the bottomless fries... (we had it refilled 2x). We ordered the Keep it Simple Burger with Bottomless Freckled Fruit Salad. The burger was good but the fruit salad did NOT look appealing. It looked like it was out on the counter for awhile. However, it did taste fresh. From the Kid's menu we ordered Red's Beef Burger with cheese, bottomless fries and apple juice. It was a no nonsense burger which satisfied a very finicky kid. The server assisted in processing our coupon so the correct amount was reflected in the pay at the table tablet. NOTE: if paying by cash, must pay through your server.

I usually go with the royal Robin burger. My wife gets the simply grilled chicken sandwich. My kids get the chicken strips or the pizza.

Also ordered was a bowl of chicken tortilla soup that never came out, so I canceled that and had it removed from the bill. Refills took forever, only after asking the manager for a refill. We went today for lunch, and the entire restaurant was maybe 30% to capacity so no reason why table service was so terrible (maybe short staffed like usual chain restaurants)  I understand the manager is trying to run a restaurant with the budget he was given by corporate, but he needs to fight more for his restaurant and be better staffed with employees to meet the needs of their customer base.

The waitress was nice and friendly but took a while to take our orders (I felt bad that a family member said a mean comment for taking so long to get our order, the looked understaff since I didn't see many waiters around). They have these screen tablet devices at each table where you can order drinks, appetizers, pay for your bill, and even play games while waiting (but at an extra cost). My cousin and I accidently paid for the tablet games, but ended up having a lot of fun with the trivia games while we waited for our food.  When our food came, we realized that we didn't have any utensils so had to ask for them and wait a bit longer to eat (at least for those that need forks and knives). The chicken was good, but the side salad that came with it was underwhelming (can't expect much since they're known mostly for their burgers). My cousin got sweet potato fries which are my favorite.

Michelle M.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",81,84,77,4.0,11/12/2016,"Had dinner at Red Robin last night after spending the day at Disneyland.  Now let me start by saying that I normally frequent this location on a weekend usually around lunchtime, but have only had dinner here maybe 2 or 3 other times in the 7 years that I have lived near this one.  The food is always yummy and service of the wait staff is generally pretty good.  Our server last night (can't remember his name, but has blond hair, wears it in a ponytail and has a beard) always made sure our drinks were never empty.  Onion rings app was hot and crispy, my burger and my husbands burger were DELISH!  The reason I'm giving 4 stars is because someone needs to do something about the rude hostesses up front.  Now I get it, it was a busy Friday night, but come on, smile, say hello, and be nice...it's not that hard.  Yes, customers get upset if the wait is long, but a little bit of good customer service goes a long way.  Trust me, if you as the hostess are nice to your patrons, the wait won't seem nearly as long.  Get it together hostesses!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga?start=80

After dropping off the car at nearby Sears we were stranded for a while and decided to grab a bite to eat. It wasn't long before my husband who has a heart condition felt very ill. We had already ordered and felt it would be better for him to sit in the fresh air. Benji was very accommodating and asked for our food to go while quickly cashing us out and bringing us our iced tea outside. While we waited for a while, we had nowhere to go anyway since we had to wait for the car. Taylor came out of the service exit and kindly brought us a water. Some time later he was walking to his car to leave and noticed we were still there. He went back and made sure we got our food.

They were right on time with their wait time, which my hunger appreciated.  To start, we ordered the Spinach Dip & a cup of clam chowder. I really didn't like the chips that came with the spinach dip. They had a heavy wheat taste to them, and not the light airy salted corn chip I'm used to. The clam chowder was just OK. I wasn't given soup crackers, which I love, and I didn't bother asking for any. For my entrée, I ordered the Simply Grilled Chicken Burger which came with all the toppings on the side. I forgot to ask them to add cheese, which made me sad because I LOVE cheese, but oh well, next time! My husband ordered the Whiskey BBQ Chicken Burger and I heard no complaints. I ordered the Grilled Chicken on a Stick and a side of fruit for my son. All in all, the food was OK.  The service was EXCELLENT! I really liked our waitress. She was super attentive and nice. She recommended we sign up for their Royalty Program and left an instruction sheet that walked us through the sign-up process which was as easy as sending at text, literally!

He had a bad attitude and never brought silverware for us even when our meals arrived. I had to ask a waitress who was helping others to bring us napkins and utensils, as well as drink refills.  I also don't appreciate being hovered over at times because the waiter had nothing else to do and made it obvious he was just trying to look busy more than half the time we were there and never asked if we needed anything else....just hovered.

I couldn't get our server's attention at all, and a manager finally noticed me and brought me the correct burger. After that, we barely saw him for the rest of our visit. It was really strange.

Brent P.,"Riverside, CA",20,10,1,1.0,4/2/2016,"Review is on restaurant/service. Food was ehh....just ok. Normally I usually don't go to Red Robin because of the kid factor (not hating on kids) but we tried it out again anyways. I's not sure about other locations but this one has gone downhill. My theory is that because it is so close to Victoria Gardens and the surrounding businesses, that they don't try as hard because they know that the foot traffic will be there.  When will hostesses figure it out that people do not like to be seated near the entrance, kitchen or bathrooms. Yeah, I really want a blast of cold air whenever the front door is opened, conversation from the kitchen or the smell of farts when I'm eating. I get that you have to use all available space to maximize your seating area, but c'mon, especially when there are other available seats. If its based off of rotation of the servers then ask the customer if its ok before you walk them to the table.  When we finally got a table the waitress asked if we had been there before. We said ""yes"" and then she said ""So you know how to use our touchscreen orders?"" Um, no. She ran through it. Basically, its there to make her job easier but its portrayed as quicker service because you're doing the ordering. Main entrees are ordered through your server, but all appetizers, shakes, and alcohol are ordered through the touchscreen and are delivered by the kitchen/bar. So basically, your server is only responsible for taking your main order, bringing your main order, and refilling your soda/tea/water (which I had to ask for a refill from the barback who brought our appetizer)....so you basically never see them again. You even pay and tip through the touchscreen. And also, clean the damn thing!!! Ours had food on it and it looked like it was cleaned with a burger wrapper it had so much grease on it.

Lesley M.,"Ontario, CA",0,11,,1.0,10/7/2017,"Now I understand why this place has so many poor reviews for service. My daughters and I ate here last night. Our original sever (older bald gentleman) was very pleasant but informed us he would be going on his lunch and that another gentleman would be taking over, however original server continued to serve the table directly next to us the remainder of our visit. I thought it was odd, but we ordered and received our food in a timely manner. The fried pickle nickels were delish, the cod and shrimp duo tasted like old grease and my daughter enjoyed her veggie burger. Our replacement waiter (younger Asian guy with man bun) was cordial but inattentive. We had no napkins no refills no ""how is everything"" nada. Meanwhile original waiter dude is going out of his way checking on the table next to us though he was supposedly on lunch. When I finally got a hold of our waiter I politely asked for napkins and the check which someone else brought to us. I paid and tipped and as I'm walking out I hear our waiter complaining to another server to which she responds ""yeah you gotta rush them out and be like 'anything else???'"" If I didn't have my kids with me I would have addressed this with the manager but instead shook my head and left. The 1 star is literally for the fried pickle nickels.

We've had a few dinners where member's food restrictions were either not taken seriously, or the servers did not pay close attention - meals had to be sent back several times. The restrooms haven't been as clean as I prefer at a restaurant on several occasions and I brought it to the attention of the server, host or manager.

Andrew L.,"New York, NY",117,46,33,2.0,8/12/2016,"Skip it, just take your money to Slater's. It's right across the street and it's FAR beyond just a simple ""Better"". Or you can also take it to Fuddruckers by Ontario Mall, which has a self-serving condiment bar and you don't have to pay tips. The only pros of Red Robin's is the unlimited fries. Gave 2 stars just to be fair because if the rating is solely on the dish I had, it'll be a pathetic -10. Well, a flat 0 for sure. Ordered the value double tavern burger or whatever it's called. WORST burger I've ever ingested in my life. Put it in a very simple comparison, it's the quality of a McDouble disguised as some gourmet restaurant burger. In fact, I MUCH MUCH MUUUUUCH rather take 2 McDouble for $2.50 than one sloppy soggy nonsense for $6.99.  Okay, allow me to explain why the burger was a flat 0 for me. Let's start with the lesser of the evils. 1st, sauce, personally I don't enjoy it, it's not much different than mayonnaise. If it's served in a modest amount it wouldn't bother me, but the whole burger was soaked in it and that leads to another catastrophe which will be covered last. 2nd lettuce, remember those dollar burger you get from either McDonald's or Burger King? Those shredded lettuce? That's fine and all, but when soaked with the overwhelming amount of weird sauce, it just adds to the mess. 3rd, meat patty. FLAVORLESSSSSSSSS. Again, freaking McDouble's frozen patties are more FLAVORED than this. So lastly, the buns. IDK what it is but it felt like it was the cheapest sesame buns that even Walmart doesn't dare to sell. By the second bite, it had already become a bunch of soggy mess. Just imagine dipping cotton candy in a glass of water. Like that episode of Cutthroat Kitchen where they put the judges on the competing floor and Jet Tila had to serve his sandwich with water soaked buns. I don't know who's recipe of burger that is, DISGUSTING. Flavorless is one thing but man, by the 3rd bite everything was soaked into a giant saucy mess. I get it, it's the cheapest dish of yours, but I much rather take that $7 bucks for a ButteryJack from Jack in the Box. That would've been WAYYYYYYY NICER than this tavern double soggy crap. Alright, done venting about the burger. The rest of the restaurant experience was pretty good. Service was good and the unlimited garlic fries were the star of the dish. My gf's burger was also MEH. Granted, either of us order their gourmet or signature burger and we've had it in the past which weren't bad. But with the same price, I'll GLADLY take it to Slater's right across the street or Fuddruckers which we frequent. The fries were amazing, but it's just like Kirlin, the strongest human but an insignificant shrimp fighting against Freeza/Cell/Boo, couldn't save the day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga?start=100

Nothing fancy their simplest one. Mine was burnt beyond recognition. I mean insulting that they let that piece of sh*t out of the kitchen. Wow, again. My wife's was not great but ok. Took around 15 minutes to get the replacement by which time my wife's would have been frozen so she ate. Second was mediocre at best.  Also the patty size.

Amber J.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",56,36,1,2.0,8/18/2015,"This past weekend my daughter and I decided to go to Red Robin because they do always have good burgers even though our prior visits the service has been mediocre. And it's extremely loud even for a family restaurant.  Well.........Red Robin didn't let me down - the service sucked again!!!! There is always a wait at this location. But luckily it was only about 10 minutes or so before we go seated at our booth. While we waited longer than usual for anyone to come to our table to get our drink order we noticed most of the tables were full. This couple across from us looked annoyed. Just from observing it looked like they were waiting for the waitress to pick up their check and process their payment.  Finally a male came to our table and knowing there would be delays I said we were ready to order. He said he wasn't a waiter and was just getting our drinks. It didn't take too long for the drinks to come back. My daughter ordered a Diet Coke and I ordered a regular ice tea. I can assume the reason some restaurants don't keep sugar/no calorie sweetener on the tables is because they are being stolen and it can get expensive. But if someone orders an unsweetened ice tea I would automatically bring the little container with the sugar/sweeteners in it, or at least ask!!!! This annoys the hell out of me. Our waitress Bunnie showed up with a smile and took our order. She was very friendly and we really liked her and it seemed she had been a waitress for a while. She knew her stuff. I always order the Bleu Ribbon burger($9.69) with steak fries and my daughter always get the Burnin' Love ($9.69) burger. This time she decided to get the sweet potato fries. Our food was taking a long time but Bunnie came back and let us know the kitchen was backed up and our food would be out shortly. They are always slow and backed up. My daughter and I talked about this while waiting for our food. I'm not sure if it's management or they are understaffed or unorganized (that was for sure, waiters had tables all over) or they don't know what they are doing.........but I guess that all boils down to management.  So the food finally comes. Our waitresses shift is over and she introduces our new waitress. I don't remember her name but she was less than enthused to be at work. At least fake that shit! My burger was good like usual. My daughter's burger was good like usual. My fries were piping hot, but the sweet potato fries were boarding cold. We couldn't see or find our waitress to let her know. It was very annoying. It seems like recently (maybe the past year, don't know) they only bring you like less than 7 fries out with your burger. REALLY?! No one ever came back to check on us or see if we wanted more fries. I had to eye the manager (who was helping on the floor, like usual- He has zero personality.) and ask for more fries even though we were already done with burgers and fries. It didn't take too long to bring those back but my daughter's sweet potato fries were freaking cold again!!!!  So we waited and waited and waited for our waitress to bring us our check(over 15 minutes). And then more waiting and waiting to get my change. The tip we left reflected her crappy waitress skills.

The service is always good. It's one of the only restaurants I can say have never made me sick (they take gluten free seriously, which I appreciate). I eat at this location on my lunch hour usually. I sit in the bar and I'm always in and out with plenty of time. The few time I have had issues, which have all been minor (forgetting a burger topping), the staff has always been helpful in resolving the situation immediately. The food is the star and I have never received a poor quality item. I usually order burgers on a gluten free bun, which is probably Udi's but they are never hard or super dry like some places. My only gripe is that they don't have a physical or easily accessed gluten free menu, they give you an iPad which is sometimes in use elsewhere. I usually just end up accessing it on my phone.

Mike P.,"Upland, CA",4,80,3,3.0,3/2/2015,"Ok, I am reviewing Red Robin again. After my first review, I was contacted by a Red Robin Regional Manager who apologized for the bad service, sent me a gift card and suggested that I give the Rancho Cucamonga location another try. For this, I say ""Thank you Red Robin for taking the time to follow up on your bad Yelp reviews"".  This is really what spurred me to being writing reviews. That and we want to share some of the really good places we have visited. After some time, my wife and I decided to try Red Robin again. We went back to the Rancho location as we were in the mood to ""pig out"" and relax.  We tried the Towering Onion Rings, as we are big fans of really good onion rings and we were not disappointed. They were great! For dinner we wanted to try the Tavern Double Burger with unlimited steak fries. The burgers were delicious but a bit on the small side. Thus the price of $6.99. We did have several orders of the delicious steak fries, although the wait was a little on the long side for them. Over all, the food was really, really good. We enjoyed it. It was what we came here to have and enjoy. We did find their beer list a bit on the limited side. We don't drink, Coors, Bud, Miller, ect and prefer beer with some taste like those of a good Micro Brew. Blue Moon and Sam Adams will suffice, but we are really looking for more taste.  We started out in the bar as Red Robin was fairly busy at 6pm on a Saturday evening.  The bar service was good as we watched the hockey game while waiting for our table. We were shown to our table about 30 min later where we had adequate service. Nothing out of the ordinary, but nothing special either. There were many, many empty tables and thought we could have been seated earlier, but who knows. Customer service is a BIG issue with us. We did not have any major problems, like before, but we do find Red Robin to be a bit on the loud side. For the type of family restaurant that Red Robin is, I am not surprised but would have liked to not to have yell my conversation at my wife. Would I return to Red Robin...........yeah I think I will.

Let that soak in your mind real quick: ENDLESS. GARLIC. FRENCH. FRIES. Gourmet Cheeseburger ($9.49) The burger is super simple. That doesn't mean the burgers are plain by any means.

Michael S.,"San Bernardino, CA",5,121,69,5.0,4/20/2015,"I cant help it... I LOVE Red Robin. We always start out with the Buffalo Wings... Red Robin has my favorite Buffalo Wings. Maybe about a year or so ago (maybe longer) they started serving them on a bed of potato chips... and my wife and I LOVE this. There is nothing better than a crunchy potato chip with buffalo sauce on it! So much more satisfying than the standard carrots and celery. We always get a little extra buffalo sauce on the side as well...  As for the burger, I keep it simple. I've ventured out and tried a few different things, and I always come back to the original... the Gourmet Cheeseburger. I'm kind of particular about my cheeseburgers, so I don't really care for too much frill... So, I order the Gourmet, monster (2 patties), with American cheese (because nothing melts like American cheese), and I hold the onion, tomato and relish. It is pretty darn close to the perfect burger... it is fantastic... every... time. Lately, my wife and I end up eating in the bar. We either belly up to the bar or we sit in one of the booths in the bar. We don't like the high tops in the bar because quite frankly they are just TOO close together. They may as well have one long cafeteria style table and let people pull up a chair, because you're all sitting shoulder to shoulder anyhow.  Aside from that, we like the bar area because Helen is usually working, and she is awesome. We hope that they keep her where she is and give her a raise... because it would be a shame to lose service that good to management. She always has an awesome attitude and just provides excellent, attentive service every time. We dont always get her as our server unless we belly up, but we always get great service when we do.   There is a gentleman (who's name I don't know) who is often serving in the bar area. As far as attitude goes... he's an A+ all the way, but unfortunately, its also his downfall... he spends so much time talking to the customers that the service ends up being slow and the food/drinks take longer to get. Overall, however, I give RR in Rancho 5 stars... I love it here. Its a casual atmosphere where you can get an awesome burger and wings.  Honestly, I went to Slater's 50/50 across the way ONE time. Dont get me wrong... Slater's is great. But there is no reason to wait 2 hours when you can get a delicious (and quite possibly better) burger at Red Robin and maybe wait 10 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga?start=140
Michelle T.,"Victorville, CA",67,5,,5.0,1/15/2016,"Update : A few months ago, I visited this Red Robin (on foothill in Rancho Cucamonga). It was not a great experience and I left an honest review on Yelp. To my surprise, I was contacted by a representative from Red Robin and given a gift card to try the restaurant again.  So, tonight, we decided to give it a shot.  I am SO HAPPY to report that we had an awesome experience. I did not tell anyone that I had a gift card from Yelp until the very end because I wanted an honest experience. Our server Derek was amazing. Last time we had an issue with our drinks, this time Derek was so on top of it that almost as soon as our bottomless float was finished, he was ready with another. Our food came out quickly and was delicious. I had the new Bonzai salad, which was delicious. And this time, we stayed for dessert too. We loved our mud pie! I am glad that we gave it another shot, and more glad that not only did we not experience the issues we had last time, but Derek actually exceeded our expectations. Thank you Katie A for listening to us and giving us a chance to rectify our opinion.  Previous Review: I have always loved Red Robin, so please note that this review is based on my experience at the Rancho Cucamonga Red Robin.  For fairness sake, I'll state that we did arrive at 7:30 on a Saturday night, so naturally, it was busy.  However, the host sat us, and told us our server, David, would be right over. He wasn't. He showed up about 10 minutes later, took our drink orders and appetizer orders. About 20 minutes later, I flagged him down and asked about our drinks. He looked at our table in disbelief as he realized he has completely forgotten our drinks. I also took this opportunity to ask for napkins and silverware and place our dinner orders. About 5 minutes later, he appeared with the 3 root beer floats Tim and the kids had ordered, but the older 2 kids and I were just brought empty glasses. When I asked why the 3 glasses on the tray were empty, David explained he had to go make the lemonades. Seriously? Just bring me my lemonade! Meanwhile, our appetizers were being delivered. And the guy delivering our appetizers tried to take away the tray of empty glasses. He was startled when I took the tray out of his hands and explained those weren't empty, they had yet to be filled. I finished my appetizer just as my lemonade was arriving. At this point we had 3 empty bottomless rootbeer floats at the edge of the table. They were ignored.  At 9pm, we still hasn't had any drink refills, nor had our server checked in on us. We decided maybe we should just leave. In retrospect, we all agree we should have.  Instead, we flagged down our server, pointed out how many people who had come after us were down leaving and we still had no food. He went to check on the food, which he said would be 3 more minutes. He then explained that this was his first shift and he was sorry he was messing up so badly.  7 minutes later our lukewarm soggy food was delivered. My guess is had been sitting under a heat lamp for the last 30 minutes.  The manager came over to talk to us, but literally did nothing. Personally, I feel he should have at least comped our bottomless drinks which were each refilled once in an hour and a half.  We barely ate any of our very sub par food, before paying our bill and leaving only a $1 tip, which frankly, I thought was over generous given that we paid over $100 for this disaster of a meal.  My tip to Red Robin is this: servers probably shouldn't start on a Saturday night dinner rush. And if guests pay for bottomless floats or lemonades, and your staff doesn't actually deliver bottomless drinks, you shouldn't charge them for them.  And lastly, the floor managers need to be aware of what's happening on the floor. The manager should have noticed the 6 empty glasses at the edge of the table, even if the server didn't. He has to be especially aware if the server is brand new.  This trip to Red Robin definitely left us with a bad taste in our mouth, and it may be a while before we return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga?start=140

Kate H.,"Auburn, WA",185,900,77,3.0,1/20/2015,"I guess I visited here when things just couldn't go right. It was pretty crowded, so we decided to go to the bar, where there is open seating. There were some seats together at the bar, but they were at a low bar and were in a high traffic area, so we went to the higher section of the bar, where we couldn't find two seats together. So, we settled into a booth in the bar, where the manager promptly told us that the booths in the bar were not available to us. He found a high-top table that worked for us. Fourth time's a charm, I guess. After we FINALLY found seating, it took forever for the server to get to us to take our order or even get us water. I ordered a burger without a bun and a side caesar salad. She brought the salad out first, which was very nice. But, she didn't bring any silverware. It took so long for her to get us silverware that I decided to eat the salad with my fingers. Hey, you've got to do what you've got to do. They were a little heavy-handed on the salad dressing, so I couldn't eat it. When my burger came out, it had a leaf of lettuce underneath it that was actually rotting and they put my burger in a basket. I guess they thought I was going to eat a meat patty with my fingers, too. I had to ask for a plate. Also, there were fries as my side with the burger. So, she had charged me for a caesar salad instead of substituting it as my side. My dining partner always gets his burger lettuce wrapped. Other Red Robins wrap theirs in iceberg lettuce, but this Red Robin wraps in Romaine ?!?!? It was awkward. So, we had a free burger on our rewards card, but we didn't want to use it. Our server said we had to use it or not use our rewards card for the purchase, which is a weird system. But, oh well.  Anyway, it's a very inconsistent experience than I've had at other Red Robins.

So I went to the bathroom and looked around and noticed that half the table were open. So I thought they are probably short staffed which isn't my problem but whatever. 20 minutes later we got our table. We were greeted quickly and placed our drink order and ordered the chile queso as an appetizer. It came quickly and we were impressed, however barely any chips came with it. We placed our order, talked watched a little tv and began to see people that sat down way after is were getting there food. The waitress stopped by about 3x to tell us that our food was almost ready. Well it finally came about 5:45, yes we sat down at 4:20. Both burgers were cold and the French fries were cold and getting hard from being cold. We didn't send it back because I know what happens when food gets sent back. Horrible service and the waitress didn't even offer to take off the appetizer or offer a free desert, she just acted like nothing happened. Won't go back to this location. Total disappointment.

The chili I ordered as the side was better than the burger but there wasn't much of that either.

When you eat somewhere and there are appetizers take the dirty dishes away and don't push it out of the way to put more plates down. Other than that the food was pretty good.

Jack S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",11,291,159,4.0,7/5/2011,"Red Robin has become one of our regular places for picking up a weeknight dinner when we are too behind to cook. The last few times that we stayed to eat, we went at an off time since this location seems to always be busy. My wife called in a to go order this past Thursday, and I stopped in to pick it up. It was right at 6:30, and the waiting area was packed! It had been between 15 and 20 minutes since the order was called in, and they brought it right to me when I checked in with the hostess. By the time I got home, the food was still piping hot. I went with a guacamole bacon burger this time. It was good as always. The guacamole was tasty and creamy, and the bacon was nice and crisp. We asked for an extra box of fries because on the to go orders, they are always cheap on the fries. They don't charge you for extra fries, just like in the restaurant, but if you don't ask for another box of fries, you might be disappointed when you get home. I also had to get a mini order of mozerrella sticks, because they are just too good to pass up! I don't know what it is about their batter, they aren't like typical seasoned bread crumbs, but not quite tempura either; it's somewhere in between. The breading is super crispy. I'm not sure what it is, but it's good! Their ranch is delicious too, super fatty and full of buttermilk! Red Robin is always delicious, and we almost always get food to go these days, which also makes it fast and painless. If you are going to dine in, call ahead and see what the wait is like, or make sure that you are not going right at prime eating times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga?start=280

When we recieved the food it was cold and when we asked for hot fries it was like we had to pull teeth....the waitress must have been new or something she didn't know what the hell was going on...everyone elses waiters and waitresses seemed friendly and outgoing bless her it isn't her fault the service sucked...but they took one of the meals off which was nice all in all I love this place can't say I wobt come back but please better service next time!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga?start=280

Vanna C.,"Salt Lake City, UT",76,65,2,4.0,6/28/2010,"I can never be disappointed in this place. We ended up coming in on a Sunday afternoon and I was a little iffy because I never go out to eat on Sunday afternoons because they're usually so crowded from the church goers. We were fortunate enough to come in on a day that was slow and waited about a minute before we were seated. For some reason we're always seated in the same area, which is right by the kitchen. Some people don't like being seated right by the kitchen because of the chit chat and clatter that goes on because the glass panels, but I don't mind it so much. It allows me to check out the behind the scenes action that goes on.  As soon as we were seated, we were greeted by our server who hastily asked us if we've been there before, ""yes"" and if we were ready to order, ""yes"". I guess the service is what's stopping me from giving this place five stars. If I wasn't somewhat of a regular and if I didn't already know what I want, I would be annoyed of how rushed she was. I ordered the Royal Red Robin Burger and the boy ordered the Whiskey River Burger, both cooked as pink as they can get it. They cook them medium but they're usually more on the medium rare side. So if you like your meat well, be sure to tell them that.  Our food arrived soon after we ordered and the fries were piping hot and crispy, just the way I like them. Since they have endless fries, you don't get a lot with the first order but they always promptly refill. The burger was big, juicy and oh so delicious. There's always one way I judge my burgers and it's the amount of cheese paper that I am rewarded with and Red Robin never disappoints. If there's left over cheese, then to me, it's a great burger.  About two bites into our meal, our server went on a lunch break and we were given another server. She was pleasant but if there's one thing that annoys me the most in a restaurant is if I'm rushed out. I wasn't even half way done with my burger yet before she dropped off the check and said, ""no rush"". Burger in hand, almost ready to take a bite and she comes by and drops the check book off. Yeah, right, no rush... I took my time and she didn't bother us again which was an upside.

At that point I call them and speak to the manger and he told me that I tiped the waiter $8.00 on my credit card slip (which stupid me never writes 0) in other words she wrote $8 as a tip totaling $10 with the cash tip I left!

I mean when we sit down, he says ""NIce to see you again, do you guys want the usual?"" The first time he said this, we looked at him stunned. We asked if he knew what that was and he listed off our order to us! We were very impressed (and slightly embarrassed that we go enough to have our order known like that! haha!).

She also apologized ahead of time for being so out of breath because she was so busy. She made my friend and I feel very welcomed! On the receipt the server name is Holly and she was amazing! Such a hard and kind worker. I never had to ask for a refill. She checked on the food for us. The service was honestly the best I've had from any restaurant. Also, the burger was fantastic!!!!!! I got the whiskey bleu cheese burger. Keep in mind that I do not like bleu cheese very much, but I fell in love with this burger. Plus the bottomless garlic fries (99 cents more) were delicious. I could barely finish I second basket. When I did ask for the second basket I received it almost immediately. Overall, I do not have one complaint about this visit today (I complain a lot).

The first time I left thinking nothing extravagant would have been plenty happy at in n out. This visit I ordered a burger that in the details did not say avocado. Burger arrived with avocado. Most would be happy about this but I am allergic. So the server requested kitchen for another burger. Upon are visit it was busy yes but we asked 3 different people for a side of ranch multiple times and never received more after the first two small sides she had dropped off in the beginning are cups sat empty for too long in my opinion as well considering how often our server and other servers walked past our table. Our server was nice and friendly but just felt a bit annoyed that after forgetting so much and waiting so long for another burger that was there mistake not ours nothing was comped. I don't go around asking for free things but everyone was done eating when I finally got a new correct burger and felt that was wrong and poor customer service on their part.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga?start=200

I went here yesterday with my family because they love this place, but when we got there and got seated, first the manager took our drink orders which was no problem but when our drinks were delivered by the waitress first off, one of the drinks was wrong and secondly she (accidentally) dropped the entire glass into my lap. Surprisingly I was extremely calm about this considering she stained my white shirt and it was ridiculously sticky and all over me, but after she dropped the entire glass on me, she never came back and we had a different waiter the rest of the meal. Maybe she was embarrassed, but okay whatever.  I'm just upset that there was absolutely no compensation of any kind to make up for the waitress's slippery fingers. Nothing, at all. We all joked that maybe we should've complained a little bit more and we would've received something like a discount of some sort, anything to show their gratitude for their massive mistake into my lap.

Our server Nancy was a frowny faced waitress who had zero personality or serving skills. We had to wait long periods of time before even getting her to come to to our table. When she did show up we had to ask her for stuff, she never once saw our need or offered us anything. Then she would basically drop whatever we asked for off on her way to another table. My son saw another waitress pass by who had a pleasant smile and my son said I want her to be our waitress. I said I was just thinking the same thing. Sadly we were stuck with Cruella Deville. Some guy ended up bringing us our food, then Cruella returned with her frowny face to bring our bill without asking us if we would like dessert, at this point I didn't even want dessert anymore.

My daughter for some reason, loves this place. I don't know. I guess because it's noisy and loud and they give you free balloons. Kinda reminds me of the noise level at the old Farrell's Ice Cream parlor, but burger-style.  There were about 40 families w/ kids when we came- okay, maybe 20 or so, but still.  I guess that some people still think that if their kid acts up in a noisy place like this, they don't have to bother about quieting them down or taking them out.  Mind you, I HAVE a 6 year old, so i'm not adverse to kids in restaurants. But helllloooo... screaming SCREAMING kids next to me at a booth annoys the hell out of me.  I digress... sorry... Okay, that said... foodwise, good selection, although heavy on the fried side (and I love fried food).  The service is awesome. We commented each time we've come here, that the service has always been really good, and the managers make themselves visible.   The onion ring tower is really good, nice portion size w/ good sauces.  I got the fish and shrimp platter. Good slaw, nicely drenched in mayonaisse sauce- yum- but the fish and shrimp were just okay.  They could have been pulled out a couple min. earlier, as well as the fries, which are refillable (A plus!) One last thing- (Peeve?)

We sat in the bar, which was nice to be away from the child guests in the main dining room.  A bartender immediately came up and took our drink order, was prompt to return with our drinks and take our order.   We ordered some cheese sticks and jalapeno coins for a starter and you can't go wrong deep frying frozen items.  We then got our burgers.  We should have went to In n Out .  I got through about 1/3 of mine because it just didn't taste right.  My friend, who bragged that she could house tons of Red Robin maybe ate half. Then we were ignored.  The original bartender disappeared and the other one went to everyone around us but us.  When I tried to get the bartender's attention because I wanted another cocktail, he returned with our check and the dessert menu and about ran off when I was able to stop him and tell him I wanted a drink.  While he prepared the drink, my friend and I decided we wanted dessert to get the nasty burger taste out of our mouths.  He dropped my drink off and ran off again without giving us a chance to order.  And then for the next 5 minutes, checked on everyone but us.  I saw the manager at the bar, so I went up to the bar and asked if I should order here.  The manager really didn't seem to care. The dessert was good.  Apple pie something or another that needed more than one scoop of ice cream for how big it was.   Thank heaven we decided to go back to our hotel after this rather than continue our night out because I immediately started having stomach cramps when we got back thinking I was going to vomit.  Luckily I went to sleep and it passed until the morning.  My friend wasn't as fortunate as I and spent the majority of the 1st half of our Sunday in the bathroom.   I feel violated that I spent what was way too much money for bad meat and bad service.  I regret this decision and will never visit any other Red Robin ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga?start=320

I ordered the 5 Alarm Burger (with some pink) and thought it was pretty tasty.  It's a smaller burger than what you'd find at Islands or Fuddruckers, but the meat itself is tender and juicy.  Oh, and it's not nearly as hot as the ""5 alarm"" may suggest.  In fact, it's pretty tame. So why the 3 stars?  Well, it's a good burger, but it's still just a burger (plus I have a built-in bias against ""gourmet"" burgers, really unless it was made with kobe or wagu beef, or has sauteed truffles, can you really consider any burger ""gourmet?"").  Better to save some dough and stop at Farmer Boys or Carl's instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga?start=340

I wanted to know exactly have good their so called gourmet burgers are. Honestly, I was kind of disappointed. I guess my expectations were too high. Their burgers are good, but nothing to write home about. Their smoothies are great though. I ordered the Strawberry Banana one, I liked it better than my burger. The wait for our food was pretty long. I was finished with my smoothie before out burgers showed up. I don't drink frozen things very fast if that's what your thinking. A plus is that they give you unlimited fries with your order of any burger. They are kind of stingy about the quantity of fries they give you each time though. There aren't that many in the basket so you have to ask for more whenever you run out. I guess they don't want to waste any. All and all my experience at Red Robin was meh at best.

Leah G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,6,,2.0,7/23/2013,"I have come here countless times with my family, and my opinion of this place has never really changed: nothing to rave about. I do t know how many times I have been here and something has gone wrong. Some people might say ""then don't go there anymore."" But it's a place my family enjoys regardless of my opinions.  Our most recent visit, we arrived about 10 minutes after they opened, and we were asked to wait for 10 more minutes, while they set up and ""assigned stations"". In my opinion, if you say you open at 11, you are open, and ready to seat customers as soon as the clock hits 11. Then, we were seated, and out server came right away. Redemption. Not quite. As one member of our party ordered Diet Coke and two others ordered Coke, he brought the drinks, and set them down. As soon as the person who ordered diet took a sip, she wasn't sure if it was diet or regular. So after tasting, we decided he had switched a diet with a regular, and left us guessing which was which. Then our order came out and he placed it on the table. Red Robin is famous for their gourmet burgers. They also have a large presentation on their menu on options of ""trade this for that"" ""make it your own"" so I take advantage of it. I usually order a burger that comes on an onion bun, and has Dijon sauce on it, but I always ask them to switch the bun for a sesame seed bun and to not put the sauce on. When the order arrived, the server put down the plate and said ""here is your burger on a sesame seed bun!"" When it clearly was not on a sesame seed bun. They did not put the sauce, like I asked, but the didn't put the other sauce that comes on it either. Their staff could be a little more aware of orders, and how they're prepared. If I were a server, I would be embarrassed to serve someone the incorrect thing, and to say it is what they ordered, when it was clearly not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga?start=340

The worst part was the manager ed  tries to sing elvis what a joke. Dogs were running when this guy opens his mouth. Overall since the manager ed cancelled the car cruise no reason to go here anymore. The reason they had a poor car count was always due to the bad and slow service and eds horrible singing that is a fact!!

The service was excellent both times we went. We'll definitely be back. I read the earlier review about someone else delivering food and pondered it for a bit. This isn't a 5-star restaurant and I don't expect the same type of service from it. I'd rather my food be delivered when it's ready and hot than wait for my server to be done with his/her other tables first. The staff was friendly. The order was taken promptly. Food came back quickly. The servers came back and checked on how we were doing. We were offered refills on soda and fries before they were empty. Our sodas were never empty the whole time we were there. The check was delivered and processed promptly. (One of my pet peeves is after eating our dinner, we often have to sit and wait for 15 to 20 minutes to get the check and pay for it. Not so here.) All in all, both visits were awesome.

Jason J.,"Upland, CA",37,473,96,1.0,1/9/2009,"Wow.  I was always fairly happy with this place until I went last week with some friends.  Again, wow.  I am shocked at how criminally bad it was to have dinner there. The ups: 1. Our waiter, Kent, did everything he could to try and save our experience.  Great waiter, who unfortunately, works at a restaurant with bad practices. 2. The food (I had the BBQ pork sandwich) was pretty good, but see notes below. The downs: 1. This list will be longer than I feel comfortable with: 2. Someone other than our waiter delivered our food, and yes, there was a problem.  My friend who is allergic to dairy, who specifically asked for her chili burger without cheese, got a nice, heaping stack of cheese on her chili burger. The waiter knew this.  But the person who delivered our food didn't.  Dumb.  Just dumb.  This is definitely becoming my pet peeve at restaurants now.  Moreso, because they have to ask who gets what..because lord knows they didn't take your order, and lord knows they wouldn't know their butts from a hole in the ground if it was messed up. 3. They have waiters working too many tables.  Our poor waiter was working his ass off, and still not making it back to our table frequently enough.  It wasn't like he was standing around doing nothing, so I blame the restaurant's waiter to table ratio. 4. Pet peeve numero due: restaurants that have people sweeping the floor right next to you as you eat.  Yummy: dust and crap in the air, my food, and now in my mouth.  Extra points Red Robin for seating me right (and I mean 1 ft) from the trash can, separated by a non-sealed glass divider, where said sweeping was dumped. 5. French fries came hot, but soggy. 6. After we had finished eating, a MANAGER, (or at least a manager appearing person), stopped at our table, said nothing, and right in the middle of my friends sentence, reached directly in front of her face, and cleared a plate...IN FRONT OF HER FACE, still saying nothing, and walking away.  No excuse me, no could I clear that, nothing.  Just reaching and interrupting by odd and awkward physical action. 7. On our way out, despite being obviously busier than hell, there were no less than five employees standing in the bar, gawking at TV. 8. As a minor annoyance, the restaurant layout is completely open, without fabric deadeners, so basically if there are more than 10 tables seated, the restaurant runs at a pretty good din, and you have to speak quite loudly to be heard, and lean in (refer back to plate cleared in front of face) to hear what anyone at your own table is saying. All of that said, again, wow.  This has to be the one of the worst dining experiences I've had in recent memory.   I don't naturally gravitate toward Red Robin, but it's safe to say now I will not be returning.  Ever.  Never ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga?start=340

I've never been to a Red Robin before but have always wanted to try it out, it looks good! But after getting the run around for an hour we decided to leave. Here's what happened, we sat down and ordered our food, the peppercorn burger and Western charm, and had been talking for about half an hour before wondering where our food was. After a bit, our server came back and told us how sorry he was about the wait but it would be out soon. Another 15 minutes pass and he sends out another server to give us fries. Another 5 pass and he comes back to reassure us that it'll just be a few more minutes. At this point it was 5:50 and we got there an hour before, they must've had to slaughter the cow in the back or something... Our server came back and the same story, it'll be ready soon. At this point we were tired of sitting there for an hour and got up and left. I talked to the hostess and let her know we were leaving and to cancel the orders. I ended up going to McDonald's across the street and wish i did that from the start.  Your server screwed up and i wish he was honest. Instead of giving us the run around, he should've let us know that he forgot the order (or what ever the excuse) and it would take another 20 minutes. If that was the case, we would've gotten an appetizer! It's that simple! It really wouldn't have been a big deal, but waiting and being led on for an hour is what pissed me off.
