Trevor L.,"Primghar, IA",27,4,,5.0,1/3/2018,"100% Awesome experience! Say at the bar after a day of traveling from Iowa. Tony was the bartender. OUTSTANDING SERVICE! Menu in the first 5 seconds, drink order in the next 10 seconds... never took attention off of customers even though he was SWAMPED! He checked on my order multiple times keeping me updated.  Food was delicious and was left full and satisfied. I don't give out 5s often but this was just perfect!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding
Tauni W.,"Redding, CA",31,37,38,5.0,8/10/2017,"My kids love Red Robin and it is a place that I don't mind going to occasionally. It was a busy Friday night and our party of 2 adults and 3 kids were seated in about 25 minutes.  Our server was prompt, grabbing all of our drinks and appetizers. The kids always want cherries on their sprite and he gladly got them, which I 100% appreciate as a mom.  Our food was good, everything was exactly as we ordered.  My four year old requested and was given an empty box after he tripped and spilled his in the parking lot. It really is the small things that people do that make a huge difference when I am out with my kids.  My only regret is that I can not remember our servers name.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding
Anna S.,"Roseville, CA",54,210,101,3.0,11/8/2017,It was decent. Super busy on a Saturday night but amazingly was able to seat our huge party at 5:30pm. The food was your typical fast casual sit down restaurant. Nothing special. Honestly a little over priced for the generic and lack luster burgers. The service was great though. Very attentive and quick to get us drinks and refills.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding
Tiffany H.,"Reno, NV",3,5,4,5.0,12/8/2017,Dylan our server was amazing tonight! He was slammed and still made sure we were happy! We had such a great time after a seriously hard day!

Danielle P.,"Monterey, CA",195,2,,1.0,12/10/2017,Use to have such great service but it's completely gone down hill! We placed an order ToGo over the phone and they didn't even put the order though! They are using a 3rd party system now & THEY SUCK! The manager FINALLY came by after talking on the phone to see where our order was & came to put a ticket into the kitchen. This was 30 minuets after I had been waiting in the lobby for my original pickup time! They gave us 25% off our ticket but If I were a manager I would have been more generous since it's clearly their fault.

David K.,"Redding, CA",140,4,,5.0,11/11/2017,"I had to leave a review because of my entire experience last night at Red Robin. First of all, all the staff were very friendly and welcoming and talked to me as my fiancé and I were waiting for a table. Our server, Andi, was one of the nicest people I've ever met and she engaged in actual conversation with us instead of just wanting to know our order. She found out that I was in the military before and we talked a little about that. She left to go put our order in and the manager, Jesús, came out and shook my hand and thanked me for my service and talked a little with me too. It was very nice of them to do that because they didn't have to. The burgers and fries were good as usual there, but their customer service made me want to write this so here I am.

Angela W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,8,2,4.0,8/30/2017,"My friend and I arrived at 11 am to avoid the lunch crowd and were seated almost immediately.  The food was as we have both come to expect and we were quite pleased.   The SERVICE was a different story though.  The food came fairly promptly, no complaints, however the side of Ranch I requested was, quite literally, thrown at me as the waitress rushed passed our table to parts unknown.  Not wanting to make a big deal about it, I did not say anything, when the refill for my sweet potato fries came though, not only were they HUGE, were nearly tossed at the table as well.  Since I did not recognize the young lady waiting on our table I could think of no reason for her obvious desire to avoid our table as the lunch crowd still had not arrived before we left.  I hope she learns to put her customers first if she plans on earning decent tips in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding

I ordered online, order was supposed to be ready at 6:01, got there at 6:06 to make sure it was ready because I had a special place to be ( reason for ordering online) go up to the bar-nope can't get it there anymore you have to go through the person in the front.. So I waited IN LINE there, as everyone got seated then find out my order wasn't even ready yet. Finally got my food and was able to leave a full half hour after it was supposed to be ready.. Wow thanks missed the special engagement, can't get that back.  The manager was nice enough to take off 25%(still not confirmed) but still, money isn't the issue.  the whole purpose for calling in an order or ordering online is so you don't wait in the lines.  Well not at Red Robin tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=20

During this visit, 10/21/15, was no exception. The food was good! This review however is about our server Candace. To date, she has been the BEST server we have had. She was full of energy, funny, beyond proficient, and just served with a genuine smile.  Since RR is a chain, their food is regulated by the company. The workers are also trained to do certain things a certain way but what Candace did and how she did them was beyond I have seen and experience in a long time.

Janice D.,"Mount Hope, KS",17,3,,1.0,9/8/2017,"So sad the kind of service that a small group of senior received today. The waitress was extremely rude as if she really didn't want to be at work or wait on them. One woman received the wrong burger only to be told by the waitress that is not what she ordered even after multiple people heard her order.  The directors order was wrong, he got a very runny egg on a burger when he asked for it hard. He informed the waitress who said she would get him another one, mind you the yolk had saturated the burger at this point.  Approx. 10 minutes later she brings out a hard cooked egg, an egg for his yolk covered cold burger. He explained to the waitress     ( who got pissy) that he didn't want his burger, she sent out a manager. He explained it to the manager who said they would make a new one only by that time they were all ready to leave. Now this wouldn't have been such a big deal except for the rude service that all 10 of them received. The residents wont be back and you can bet the other 90 people they live with and their families will all hear about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=20

Z H.,"Redding, CA",0,34,10,5.0,8/25/2016,"I haven't visited a Red Robin in several years because I had a mediocre experience in Illinois at a couple of them. But yesterday I had a business meeting at Red Robin in Redding. I have completely changed my opinion of this restaurant chain based on that experience. First the host, Kurt, was exceptionally friendly. Second, the waitress we had, Heidi, had the most pleasant and inviting countenance and manner about her that we truly enjoyed the entire meal and every interaction.  I ordered fish (can you believe that at a burger place?) and it was actually better than most places. So I highly recommend the fish and chips.   Overall, I honestly have no idea how they could have done a better job. This restaurant is at the top of my list now.

I've been here a dozen times and eat at the bar so I can watch sports while I eat. Tony has worked here for 14 years. He is an excellent bartender and always in a great mood. He keeps a clean bar. I worked in restaurants and look at little things. Tony is on point all the time. The orders have never been messed up. He works with his team well. The Guacamole bacon cheeseburger is my favorite and their onion rings are the best in Redding. Creamy and nicely breaded.  Onion rings, a big beer and Guac burger was 21 bucks.

Tommy L.,"San Diego, CA",644,18,12,5.0,8/29/2015,"We chose to go to Red Robin for my free birthday burger, which I chose to be the Uber burger because it sounds big. Upon eating Uber burger I discovered that I really enjoyed cheese infused with beer, as well as Canadian bacon even though it's actually just ham. They also put sausages on it that were of German descent but those are actually just hot dogs with fancy casings, but still really good. After inhaling uber burger, while eating my second basket of bottomless steak fries, and reflecting on what it will be like to deal with my first heart attack the waitress came over and told me some startling news. She apparently had neglected to realize and take note of the fact that the uber burger was so Uber that it was a specialty burger and not just a burger for the masses. So the birthday discount would not apply to the master race of hamburgers.  She was nice enough to call the manager whose name was Michelle who also seems like a very nice person since she took the price of the burger off the bill, as it was noticeably their mistake that they were willing to rectify and correction quickly. and I said rectify not erectify, its not that kind of restaurant.

Chelsea D.,"Redding, CA",111,1,,1.0,10/1/2016,"I have always loved Red Robin since they give many gluten free options that are lacking in Redding. I am extremely disappointed by my service today. Not only was there service extremely slow, though it was crowded, but they also got orders wrong. Our water was never refilled and our waiter stood watching us count out cash to pay the bill. To top it all off my gluten free burger had pasta in it, if I had not noticed I would have gotten extremely sick. When I told a hostess she said she would get the manager since that was a big deal, I wish I would not have done that, she was extremely condescending and acted as if it shouldn't have been an issue.

Came out with strangely dry looking chicken breast between two toasted buns and lettuce and tomato on the side. The broccoli was taking a little more time to steam apparently. So I start eating my sandwich and it's what you would expect a frozen chicken breast to taste like. Broccoli comes out finally, smallest portion no bigger than a fist, keep in mind this cost extra. It looks like they took packaged broccoli out this morning to let it defrost, then let it sit out all day to dry out, then steamed it back to its pathetic life. It was rubbery tough and disgusting. It also came with its very own brown rotten interior, you have to actually put effort into making broccoli that shitty.

Bill J.,"Reno, NV",157,86,30,2.0,8/21/2014,"Had not been in a Red Robin for some time and remembered why after this visit. It is loud in this restaurant, be prepared to have to lean way in to have a conversation, it felt like one big birthday party.  Everyone in the building must have had a birthday and when they sing since it is so loud in the building the singers all shout to be heard, too much. I remember Red Robin making decent food, but the Ensenada Chicken dish they serve could have been from yesterday held in the window. The chicken breast was flat and very dry, it looked much better in the photo album they call a menu. The salad was boring, all iceberg, big chunks of core and the dressing very flavorless. My ears were ringing by the time we got outside the building, won't be coming back for a while unless it is my birthday and I need to be shouted at.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=40

Our fries were served cold and mine looked like they had been sitting for quite some time before they were served. Even the second baskets of fries that were brought out to us were luke warm at best. When we are paying extra for the sweet potato fries my husband loves so much, it's disappointing for them to be served cold.

Jessica A.,"Redding, CA",216,69,54,4.0,11/21/2015,"I am giving RR 4 stars for what they are: an Applebee's style Burger chain. We don't often eat this type of food (very high-calorie, lots of deep fried options) however when my father in law suggested we take him there for dinner my husband and I were happy to oblige. We had the Poutine  (french fries covered in gravy and cheese curds, a Canadian favourite and very tasty), the chicken wings and onion rings as appetizers. All of the above were yummy and came with sauces, again VERY filling. After the appetizers all I could eat was a side salad while the guys ordered burgers. The burgers looked good but seemed a bit steep in price (about $12.00).  Overall a fun place to eat, they have also done some recent upgrades on the exterior and the menu. Don't expect the prices to be In N Out though, because they are steeper. I would recommend looking at the online menu before going to ensure this is what you're looking for.  Overall, nice staff, fairly short wait times, and what you'd expect from a chain burger restaurant.

My most recent visit was on January 23. We waited 15 minutes before our waitress ever visited our table. She took our appetizer & drink orders on the iPad because I refuse to do that myself. This is why I go out to eat and why I tip my waitress, for the service. Our drinks and appetizers came out in a timely manner, but we were done with our drinks and appetizers and she still had not taken our dinner order. Our waitress never came around or refilled our drinks, we had to find someone and ask them to bring her to our table so we could get a refill on our drinks. In the end, we were there for 90 minutes (not counting the time we waited for our table) 90 minutes for a burger. We sat down at 5:54 & finished at 7:30. I also do NOT like that I have to pay my bill myself. Again, waitressing is a service industry. I'm paying/tipping for a service. Unfortunately the service at this red robin has gone downhill.

I don't understand why they cannot figure out if they cannot seat a table of twelve right away, they can still seat tables of two, three, five, etc. and so on.   Last time I was there, there were several parties that were very large, I'm talking like 18-20. They made all of the smaller parties wait until they had room to seat the larger tables. Now, I'm no rocket restaurant-scientist, but there was room to seat the smaller groups right away. I hope they get this worked out because it's so frustrating. Pros:  My kid loves this place, new reward card is a great idea Cons: I don't like this place, not a fan of burgers, etc.  Way too loud, way too many BD parties, inept front of house hostesses that can't seat in-coming parties accordingly.

So I wanted to take my mom and 4 kids out to a fun, family friendly restaurant for dinner tonight. By the way it was far from it. We arrived and we were told it was a 15 min wait! Great!!!! They seat the 6 of us in a tiny half bench/half table that possibly normally would seat 4 people. We voiced are complaint that we wouldn't be able to fit here with our food as we were already practically sitting on top of each other so they worked something out and sat us elsewhere ( thank you) after ordering our food right away we waited  an additional 45 mins for it to arrive. One of the kids meals were mistakenly forgot about (oops we all make mistakes) all of our fries were very cold and brown looking a little shriveled like they sat for way too long! My moms fish was so cold and soggy the breeding was falling off I asked for my chicken burger to be cut in half it wasn't (no big deal, I'm an adult I'll wait for a knife and cut it myself) waiting on the server for 10 mins to ask if our food was good, I then complained he half assed listened mumbled I'll get a manager and walked away still no knife. Manager comes over with our kids meal and apologizes (thank you) I express my compliant he rolls his eyes asks what he can do and walks away. Gets my a knife, now it has sat for 20 mins definitely ice cold by now I asked for a fresh basket of fries as they were delivered old and cold he says no problem. He delivered the fries and walked away, I paid my bill on the kiosk and he walks back over about 10 mins later and says I was going to discount the bill but you have already paid....my response yes I did and I'm not looking for a discount I don't need one I came to dinner to eat and I paid for what I've ordered. He pulled up a chair and asked why I was so unhappy, I explained himself he then asked why I would want to eat there if I was unhappy. I explained I like to eat here, my family likes to eat here and we come here frequently as he can tell by my royalty card. Why am I explaining why I come eat here???? He then proceeds to tell me that I am very rude and he just recently won manager of the year? Ok, congratulations! Tonight the service and food was terrible and yes I complained about it. He then sat right across from me and told me he knew my problem? Ok, thank you! No he voiced that my problem was I am racist against Hispanics and that is what is wrong with me??? Wow! Totally stunned he just called me racist? Where did this come from? Why would he assume such thing when I simply complained about terrible food that was cold!? I'm contacting corporate and I hope that no one else gets treated the way I was tonight in front of my 4 children. My kids have no clue what he meant or what the word racism means!

This place is friggin' PACKED on most weekends, so have a back-up restaurant ready.  The staff has overall been very friendly and quick.  It's a fun, boisterous, bordering on insane atmosphere.  It will seriously give someone with PTSD a flashback, though.  Trust me. Also, if you're planning on a slice of Mile-High Mud Pie after your sandwich, be sure to share.  One slice can easily satisfy three women, it's that big and chocolatey...That doesn't sound right, does it?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=80

So if you're trying to watch you're figure it's not the best place to go. You can get a simply grilled chicken burger or a salad minus the bad toppings if you want to heat healthy here.

About $9 each plus beverages. Oh, they had a food ingredient menu on the table. Do not look at that. Example her Banzai burger: calories 1,033; fat 20g; salt 1922 mg; carbs 68.Basically your food intake is about one week's worth of the ugly stuff you are otherwise trying to avoid.

The wait staff were also hardly noteworthy.  My husband and I went there twice within a week and both times the staff was very clearly just there to get a pay check.  The second time we were seated near the drink station and through our whole dinner about four other waiters were hanging out in the drink station chatting while their tables sat unattended.  Our waiter stopped by once or twice to check on us and refill my husband's soda but it was clear he does not like his job. Lastly, I thought the baby carrier slings were perfect.  Our daughter was only a few weeks old when we went in to eat and taking her out of her carrier in a public place didn't appeal to me but the slings they set up next to the table to hold her carrier were the perfect height and allowed me to keep her close & comfortable while I ate both at a table and at a booth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=120

So we get to Red Robin after driving around town for about 30 minutes looking for somewhere to eat. We are taken back to our both and our waitress runs by and tells us she will be right back. She goes over, takes another tables order, and then comes back over to us. She takes our order and then walks off. Shortly after she comes back with drinks. My husband and I are sitting there chatting while we wait for our food when the waitress walks by and puts a basket of fries on the table.  ""No one else wanted these, so hear ya go."" Um... ok... A few minutes later I see the food get delivered to the table she took the order from before ours. Perfect, our food should be here soon. So we wait... And wait... About 15 minutes later, the server comes over to our table. ""My manager will be here to talk to you in a minute."" Turns out the kitchen has lost our ticket. No one is sure how this happened. See the manager agrees to comp half of our meal. Ok cool. He also tells us that they have moved our order to the front and our food should be out any minute. So we continue to wait. We are sitting back by the kitchen, so I am able to watch as food leaves the kitchen. I look at my husband and ask ""Didn't he say they moved our ticket to the front? Cause there is a lot of food leaving the kitchen that isn't ours..."" At this point we just have to laugh. An hour in and the only food we have scene is the basket of fries that no one else wanted. But our drinks stayed full and they didn't try to cover up the mistake. When we finally got our food it was nice and hot. And the same quality that we expect from Red Robin.

Keith V.,"Redding, CA",0,1,,2.0,2/21/2014,"I'm normally a huge fan of Red Robin.  Every time (with the exception of the last time I was there which I chose not to review because I was giving them the benefit of a doubt but not this time) that I go to Red Robin the food is amazing and the service is outstanding, outgoing & so friendly.  Until today that is.  We went the day before my brothers birthday since I work the next day & wont be able to celebrate with him.  We waited and waited for a server to get things started and finally he comes over (plus size guy wearing jean shorts?? not what I wanna see when dining out) and takes our drink order.  Another long wait and he finally gets our food order.  We specifically asked for a side of mayo, ranch, honey mustard & for a basket of fries to start out with while we waited for the meal.  While waiting he gave refills to 3 members of our party but ignored myself and my brother.  My mom finally got annoyed and asked our server if we could have the fries we ordered and he took off we assumed to go get them.  We never even got them.  After a while a different server brought us our food but not the condiments we asked for (not his fault as he didn't take the order & he gave us better service in those few minutes than we got all night).  This second server was told it was my brothers birthday and even said my brother would be one of the next ones to be sung to, but you have to complete most of your meal before they come out I've noticed so we figured it'd be a while.  Well, my brother and I never got asked if we wanted refills.  My nephew asked for his honey mustard again but as before, it never arrived.  Then our server drops off the check.  Really?  Not going to ask if we want dessert?  Still no offer to refill our drinks?  I was actually wanting to get the red velvet cake for dessert but by this point I was pissed and so was my brother.  My mom suggested we were not giving a tip and I totally agreed.  The worst service I've ever gotten at a restaurant.  I was a server at one time and never would I dream of disappearing and not offering to refill drinks or get more fries or offer dessert or not work that tip as much as I could with excellent service.  This guy was atrocious.  We complained to the gal that finally collected our check after ten minutes of waiting and my brother finally just leaving before he started a scene.  She brought a manager over and she was very wonderful and handled everything as she should have.  I will be back because of that but if I get this gentleman as my server... I will either leave or ask for a new section.  It was supposed to be a fun and festive night but it got ruined by disgusting service.  I've seen some of the best servers in my life work there so I'm shocked.  Even the previous visit there with the female server that ignored us (we tipped her) was way better than him.  He seemed to get this whatever I'm done with you attitude half way through our visit.  We couldn't even complain about the cold fries because he was never around.  What a joke.  I love Red Robin and I totally recommend it to anyone, just... don't allow this to happen to you.  Speak up.  The managers are very visible and watching, but they cant know everything that's happening unless you say something.  That was our bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=120

K B.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,5,,5.0,6/23/2013,Clearly the best red robin I have been to.... The service was absolutely fabulous which made us tip more than the usual amount...

Julio O.,"Vancouver, WA",4,78,21,4.0,3/2/2010,I took my kids out to eat here a few weeks ago. The burgers were great and the beer was cold. They have a pretty good selection on the menu and the people are very nice. It can get busy in there so the waiter or waitress can sometimes become preoccupied and forget to bring you a box for your left overs. I will visit this place again !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=140
Peter F.,"Redding, CA",0,3,2,5.0,11/12/2012,"Great food, can be slow at times due to being busy, but the food is fantastic.  Great casual, sit down restaurant, that you won't be disappointed about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=140
Just S.,"Redding, CA",0,29,2,5.0,4/15/2010,"The service is awesome and the food is really, really fresh. Once in a while you'll get a waitress who is having a bad day or accidently forgets about you... or maybe it's just my luck... but the restaurant as a whole is awesome. They even have a little game room for the kids to putt around in if you are waiting for a table.  They have a separate bar area, which I've never had the chance to enjoy because I'm usually with my kids. I heard they have a very strict and specific policy on mixed drinks, so you better just get a beer or don't expect anything super strong as far as mixed drinks go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=140
Wild F.,"Mount Shasta, CA",0,7,,4.0,3/26/2014,we always seem to have a pleasant experience when we come here. we usually order a burger and a wrap...always very good. the service is great too. we will be back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=140
Cat F.,"Alameda, CA",1,83,,5.0,12/28/2008,"I know this is a chain restaurant, but in Redding they do it right. We were just there yesterday and got a free appetizer, all of our orders (party of six) were correct and brought out quickly and our waiter Bobby was on it! He refilled our drinks, brought us extra fries, and all around responded to our requests with friendly and quick service. I have been to a couple of other Red Robins around the state, none compare to the service at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=140
Dave P.,"Redding, CA",15,45,3,5.0,3/5/2009,"It's a great place to go, friendly staff, and great food.  One recommendation, don't go at the height of dinner or lunch hour, as parking is hard to find at these times.  It's not that they have a small lot, they are just that popular!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=140
Sharon G.,"Modesto, CA",5,12,2,4.0,2/22/2009,"RED ROBIN is one of my favorite places to dine. I have been to many red robins in different locations  Pleasanton, Fremont,and now Redding. I have had some fun times in this place good food and drinks and I love the bottomless fries always hot and tasty. Funny story the other day I went with a group of friends and we had a long night of drinking the night before so we all showed up little hungover and hungry one of my friends was on her cell phone talking  and the conversation wasn't very pleasant who ever it was made her mad she had not noticed the waitress came up and asked if we were ready to order so she hung up and blurted damn you guys are    insert ( expletive )  irritating me. The waitress made a sad face and walked away. Then 5 minutes later a new waitress came over to take our order. She was gonna take over I guess the other waitress thought my friend was talking to her. Then we came to find out later on when leaving the person who took offense was the general manager filling in shifts they were short handed. My friend said sorry and told her that comment was not meant for her and we left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=140
Brooke B.,"Tacoma, WA",19,532,1331,2.0,4/3/2007,"The place is obnoxious and loud!  It's like a Chucky Cheese but with Hamburgers instead.  There aren't even any games to pass the time.  Anyway, they offer free refills and fries, but I can never get a server to bring them to me.  Go to Bartel's Giant Burger if you want a good burger.   I only gave this restaurant 2 stars because of their cocktails.  Those are yummy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=140
Devan M.,"Oakland, CA",1,6,,1.0,9/12/2010,Went here for my mom's birthday.  She ordered a bacon cheese burger and asked for swiss instead of cheddar.  The waiter screwed up her order and had to take it back.  10 minute wait for them to fix the order but no comp.  Snarky waiter (think its part of their ambiance) didn't make things any better.  Blue cheese burger and Spicy burger were okay but not worth $10 each.  Endless fries... if you can get a waiter over to your table.  Would not recommend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=140
Raquel R.,"San Jose, CA",93,288,62,4.0,3/5/2008,"it's a chain and yes its loud but they have the best french onion soup in the world. i mean literally.

David P.,"Redding, CA",2,41,22,5.0,1/31/2009,"This place is one of the best group/family restaurant's in redding i have had pretty much everything on there menu and have not been disappointed once, my 3 fav burgers are the Santa Fe burger, the 5 alarm burger and if you don't like spicy go with the blue ribbon burger its toped with blue cheese crumbles! the service here is always top notch i usually go with a big group and are food still comes out fast and are server is always on top of everything, you don't have to ask for refills they just bring em i go here at least 2-3 times a month and i don't think i will every get sick of it. and a hit for you guys if you want a free appetizer since there french fries are all you can eat just ask when you place your drink order if you can have some fries well you are deciding and they will bring em out at no charge just a little hit because there fries are to die for. so if you a good meal at a great price check out Red Robin",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=140
Wm. Darius M.,"Fall River Mills, CA",5,19,,4.0,2/11/2008,"Excellent at what they do, but don't expect ""pigs to fly.""  Big, relatively greasy, paper-wrapped burgers overflowing with additions, maybe a little slow at times on the refills and additional baskets of fries, but usually the service is prompt and they put enough staff on for the dinner rush, too.  And yes, it's loud, even obnoxious - especially the birthday celebrations - and then there's the kitschy decor, and occasionally a red-furred mascot to contend with.  So, go to Red Robin if you're looking for a kid- and noise-friendly location with enough sports-bar fare  to satisfy Dad (and soups, salads, pastas, etc. for grandparents, and/or weight- or health-conscious moms) after the kids' soccer games, recitals, or other obligatory parental-appearance opportunities.  To paraphrase Denny Green, it is what you think it is - that is, if you look at the architecture, or the menu, or the staff, or most of the patrons.  As a patron of Red Robin restaurants over the past decade or so, my tastes (and my dietary restrictions) have evolved.  But there's good stuff I can eat on the menu, and they'll prepare anything else I ask just the way I ask, and my kids can have all the grease, starch, and sugar they want.  Seriously, what's not to love?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=140
John T.,"Roseville, CA",2,58,,2.0,3/25/2007,"I went with my kids for a birthday.  It took forever to get a table for 5 people.  The waitress forgot part of our order.  Luckily the free refills of the sodas kept the kids happy, but the kids didn't eat much of their expensive burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=140
