Amit L.,"Los Angeles, CA",134,192,53,4.0,12/23/2017,"After a a few hours of shopping for Christmas inside the mall, I worked up an appetite and was really craving for something that would satisfy my stomach. It was either Panera, California Pizza Kitchen, or Red Robin. I'm glad I chose Red Robin!  Their bottomless fries and symmetrical art work is everything and a half! Oh, and their Crispy Chicken Sandwich is almost as good as another famous Chicken Sandwich spot I know of.  The staff is so friendly. They were quick to bring out the food and drinks but wasn't on their game about providing utensils and napkins before hand. Had to wait a few bites until I realized I was missing those items. But once I asked them for it, they immediately brought it over in milliseconds. I think the self pay kiosk at the tables is a very clever way to eliminate any billing issues. I know some people are adamant about paying for the things they order and so this kiosk relieves some of that stress and tension.  Overall, good food and a great place to dine and meet up for drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach
Andrew F.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,457,41,3.0,1/11/2018,"When you really want that good fries fix and have a decent burger along with those fries, Red Robin's the solution. Not too far from home, my wife and I consider RR a treat when we just want to stuff ourselves silly with fries. The burgers are slightly better than just an average burger. Sure, it's good, but it's not amazing. Wife and I always get the tavern burgers as that's the best bang for buck. Reason I gave a 3 rather than 4 or 5 is because it's always a crap shoot when it comes service at this particular RR. We've had some servers seemingly disappear on us for a whole meal service, servers showing partiality in service to other tables based off appearances, and servers that nickle and dime us with charges for items that weren't previously noted that we'd be charged for - so watch out for those random misc charges when you get your check. Pros: Bottomless fries Bottomless strawberry lemonade Nice assortment of complimentary dipping sauces for the fries Cons:  Service could be poor",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach
Jasmine S.,"Gardena, CA",4,86,63,2.0,12/3/2017,"(huge sigh) I really wanted to like this place. After receiving such great service last time amd tasty burgers and fries I decided to come back. I have returned twice and have been disappointed both times. The service was mediocre. My friend and I sat at the bar area and we received no service. After 15 minutes of just sitting I was ready to walk out, but my friend waved another waiter down who then told us someone would be right with us. We ended up waiting another 10 minutes and a young lady came over and took our orders. We ordered the chili cheese fries (after I warned my friend they aren't good) as well as fries, and fried pickles. We enjoyed everything except the chili cheese fries. We tasted almost no chili. Red Robin should call them cheese fries b/c that's all we tasted. Against my better judgement I came back and ordered the Banzi burger. It was absolutely awful. The pineapple tasted and looked old. There was just a pinch of teriyaki sauce on the burger. I ordered the burger thinking it would taste like the Maui burger at Islands, I was wrong. Oh and service again was reaaaaaaaaaaaaaally slow. It wasn't even crowded. I won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach
Jenn J.,"Redondo Beach, CA",178,188,1560,3.0,12/3/2017,"We come to this Red Robin quite often. It is conveniently located in the South Bay Galleria mall. We like the burgers and bottomless sides. It's reliably better than Johnny Rockets by a long moon shot.  Hubby and I enjoy the Red Robin Tavern, the guacamole and bacon burger and the Pesto Chicken burger. We also like to personalize our burgers with ciabatta bread and fresh jalapeños.  The kids meals are great deals! My toddlers love these meals. About $4.50-$6.00 for an entree (cod fritter, chicken tender, grilled chicken breast, meatballs, pizza, mac n cheese...), a bottomless side (fries, broccoli, corn, apples, fruit medley...) and a drink (milk, chocolate milk, lemonade, fountain drink). Serving size seems good enough for a 9-10 year old, as long as they get a refill or two on the bottomless size. A 12 year old may still be hungry with these portion sizes.  Given how much we love this place, why not a 5-star review? Service is spotty. Bottomless sides are not refilled all that frequently- seems the restaurant is chronically understaffed with just one waitress for a dozen tables. Also, some of the patrons are on the Ghetto size - I get that this is just the demographics of this mall but it sometimes makes eating here uncomfortable.  The Red Robin Rewards program provides coupons and frequent diners free burgers (10th burger free). Plus, a free burger on your birthday.  South Bay Galleria Mall gift cards also accepted here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach
Lilah D.,"Los Angeles, CA",267,205,1082,3.0,10/16/2017,"Tavern Tuesdays and free birthday burgers, yay!  And bottomless steak fries too.  Beyond that, I don't have much more to give more than three stars to.  First, I am not a carnivore so, I have depended on my sweetie's opinions on the tavern burger.  We are on the email list so, we get the alerts whenever there is a free burger avaliable at Red Robin. From the photo, the Tavern burger looks pretty good and I was informed how great a burger it is.  For me, all I'm able to have as far as burgers go, is the veggie burger.  I can get any version burger with a veggie patty.  I usually go with something like bbq or something  with a flavorful sauce otherwise regular condiments on a veggie patty is quite bland as their veggie patties are just OK. Love the bottomless steak fries!  Can't complain. Service is hit or miss.  It's a corporate mall chain burger joint so, just a 3 star review for my 1 to 2 visits a year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach
Kristen Q.,"Palms, Los Angeles, CA",211,700,1391,3.0,12/28/2017,"Got my free birthday burger here! I don't remember this place the same as dreamy as I did in college, guess my standards have changed. I do love the booth seating and the online iPad ordering. The burgers are not juicy though or as large as those gourmet burgers, it's a step above an average burger you could make yourself at home. The steak fries are alright too, maybe adding the garlic is necessary for a $1.50 extra. I like this place since it's a good deal and it's great to bring kids and you can stay for hours and chat but that's about it. Also, our waitress wasn't as bad as others have quoted as the service being terrible, thought service was pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach

Love their burgers & bottomless steak fries with their special season salt. Great options- veggie or turkey burgers and chicken sandwiches. Great place to have birthday dinners - sign up for their Rewards club to get a free birthday burger during your birthday month. There was only 1 time I wasn't satisfied with the food - the poutine fries were a little disappointing - too salty and the cheese looked like it was just melted sliced cheese. Other than that everything else I've had was delicious! No maybe it isn't the fanciest place but it's comfy, fun and laid-back with good food, good deals and good drinks.

Mo M.,"Torrance, CA",51,209,720,3.0,8/31/2017,I see where this place can get its bad reviews. It was a hit or miss with us. Our first waiter was not pleasent. But apparently he was on the way out. Got a replacement lady. Super helpful and very caring.  Got two burgers and kids chicken tenders.  Fire Burger thing was good. I got it with chicken and it had the Chipotle flavor. Not spicy at all.  so don't be afraid of it. Was good. Not memorable to say. But satisfies the hunger.  Salmon Burger was GREAT. Deff something I'd get again if I ever came back. Not dry Salmon. Perfectly cooked and very flavorful. Makes you feel like you don't want it to end.  Endless fries are nice. Not a big fan of them but the kids liked them. Chicken tenders were dry. Kids had a hard time chewing them. So that didnt get finished.  Besides that we were offered more fries.  But we can't because we were so full.   Never ending Rootbeer Float is a must if you like it. I do! Hard time transfering root beer into the ice cream mug. But it got easier with a less full cup.  Bathrooms were ok and unbussed tables. Meh.

Our server was Jerrell and he was very attentive, polite and friendly the whole time we were there. He made sure to stop by every few minutes to be sure we were okay and was quick to refill our beverages.

Alex W.,"Playa Vista, Los Angeles, CA",407,629,1513,4.0,3/27/2017,"Red Robin likely gets a bad rep for being a chain restaurant at a time when chains are looked down upon.  However, like many chains currently, they have been doing a good job of trying to offer customers a strong value for what they get.  The bottomless fries (as well as a few other items which are offered bottomless) and reasonably priced burger offerings are what brought me into Red Robin on this trip.  On top of that, management does a good job of sending out frequent coupons through their rewards program.  The tavern burgers offer a nice variety of options at a competitive price, while there are larger, more premium burgers also available. If you sit at the bar, service is pretty reliable and friendly.  The milkshakes are tasty, the beer selection impressive, and you can watch a game while you eat should you choose.  All in all, a good experience at a good price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach
Johnny L.,"Torrance, CA",149,110,331,4.0,2/21/2017,"Great burgers and bottomless fries! I always pass by this place when going to shop. Decided to give it a go. There's mini touch screens at every table and it includes games for your kids which has a small fee as well as being able to pay right there with card. There is a waiting queue but we only waited 5 min to be seated during the rush which made me quite pleased. I never went to red robins in my whole life but here we go~ A m b i a n c e: I love the classic interior of the place. Walls decorated with classic 20th century portraits and pictures. This place is great for a group because its pretty spacious. There is a bar as well with TV playing the usual sports channel. S e r v i c e: We were served by 3 different waiters and I can see the difference between them. The lady taking our order looked like she didn't want to come to work. Not very welcoming but just taking our order fast and not saying much else. Next guy came along and he hurriedly delivered my baja nachos and sped off without saying a word. The last guy was very attentive. Refilled our waters, and even checked up on us to see how we were doing. I guess its like Russian roulette. F o o d: My chicken burger came in undone, like the bun and veggies were all taken out and laid all on the plate. I guess this is how they do it? Not sure but I had fun putting together the burger. Baja nachos were okay, and I also love their unlimited fries. Cripsy and delish. Burgers was pretty good 7.5/10 P r i c e: Its a bit pricey. Most likely be spending above 10 dollars for their burgers. (I can buy multiple in-n out with that money)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach
Douglas M.,"Los Angeles, CA",117,157,104,4.0,8/2/2017,"Food: 4/5 for chain casual  Service: 4/5 Khali (sp) at the bar was on it  Value: 5/5 unlimited fries Love coming here during my birth month for the free burger and unlimited steak fries :P Since I have a self proclaimed ""black belt in French fries"" I'll go on record and say islands unlimited fries don't even compare to Red Robin! Now I'm a little biased because I like my fries with meat (steak cut/wedges) over skinny (shoe string). Their unlimited steak fries are an excellent value!  Burgers are fresh & juicy and fairly priced. When you think about it, Red Robin might be one of the best burger restaurants as far as value, RIGHT NOW!  We've been to this location the past (2) Julys and left happy (full) each time. Mac and cheese burger was solid (not that much pasta on it as the photo). You can't go wrong with any burger just choose based on what you're craving. The vegetarian boca burger is also tasty.  Only negative is sometimes it takes a while to get greeted when you sit in the bar. We moved to the bar stools and received excellent service!

Customer service was great. Waiter was attentive and had a sense of humor. The manager walked around tables to make sure  service was good. I ordered  the mushroom and swiss burger and it was good not the best Ive had, but decent. Meat was of okay grade. The sauteed mushrooms were delish and made the burger sooo good. The fries are bottomless and I wasnt excited. They give you a small amount of fries on the refill which will having you requesting a refill about 6 times for two people. Yep, we were given one basket of a small amount of fries to share between the two of us.  The fries didnt taste fresh, more so like a frozen bag of fries. They have different types of sauces for the fries  which is good and made the fries easy to eat.  The sauces cost so just be aware and dont go sauce crazy.  I will visit here again. The burger wasnt bad and my guy is so in love with fries he can eat anybodys fries, so the bottomless fry idea is perfect for him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach
Keaton G.,"Lawndale, CA",60,47,37,5.0,5/1/2017,"Wow, all I can say.  I use to go to Red Robin in Calabases all the time as a kid and all I ever ordered was the Chicken Strips.  They were by far the best in town at the time. I just recently starting going to Red Robin as one opened up near my house after I moved to the South Bay and man, those new burgers, endless fries, service, everything across the board were delicious.  I have been probably 5 times since my first initially visit about a year ago and every time I am stunned by not just the price, but the quality.  I recently wrote a bad review about ""Islands"" as they are just night and day different in quality. Favorites in no particular order 1.  Bleu Ribbon  OR the Black & Blue (which is slightly better) 2. Whiskey River 3. Smoke & Pepper 5. Mushroom Burger 6.  Even the Crispy Arctic Cod is good! I honestly only get Burgers/ Sandwhiches from this place but I would assume most things are as equally delicious.  Honestly, I haven't really had anything I dont like.  The only downside is the stomach ache after you get from the Bottomless Fries, which you can swap out for any other kind once you finish your first bottomless fries.  Love the atmosphere, and the fast service.  5 stars.  Keep it up Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach

At first I was worried that we would have a long wait for a table because it was a very busy time of year and the restaurant looked pretty full, but we were seated in under 10 minutes. Their menu is great; standard American fare, fun appetizers and burgers, chicken, some fish, etc. so there is something for everyone. We had the tower of onion ring appetizer (best onion rings I've ever had, no joke) and then we all got something different for lunch.

The bbq sauce was nice and sweet though. The burger was well done but still juicy. The jalapeño kaiser roll tasted nothing like jalapeño.

This place is surprisingly not that busy. I honestly don't love their burgers but I like coming here when I feel like I have to go to a sit-down restaurant that's not too pricey but that's also not too crowded and busy.  ""Are you looking for AMAZING burgers?"" This is not the place. I'm sure Red Robins had a time when it was popular for their ""gourmet"" burgers, but honestly there are just too many burger joints these days they're competing against. You can definitely find a better place that's not a nationwide chain restaurant.  ""Are you looking for ENDLESS fries?"" This is the place! Red Robins is known for their ""bottomless"" fries. Order your burger and ask to start off with some fries, order more if you have to (while you wait for your burger), then your burger will come out with fries, and then you're free to keep ordering more! Don't forget to ask for dipping sauces!

Aryanna H.,"Los Angeles, CA",167,36,66,4.0,8/2/2017,"Been here twice so far, and both were good experiences. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food is here. I'm a vegetarian, so going to a burger place can be pretty scary. They have quite a few vegetarian friendly options, but my favorite is the siracha tavern burger with the Boca burger patty!  The last time I was here I ordered this new burger- it has spicy aoli, onion rings, cheddar cheese, pickles, lettuce and tomatoes. It was SO good, and paired perfectly with the yummy thick cut fries and Mich Ultra. They sent out the burger frozen, but quickly brought back a fresh, perfectly cooked one as soon as it was brought to their attention. My boyfriend loves the mac and cheese burger, unlimited fries, and all of the sauces. The onion rings are also pretty bomb. Definitely can't go there too often due to not wanting to kill my insides, but it's a nice treat every once in awhile.

Jennifer T.,"Las Vegas, NV",593,553,729,3.0,1/17/2017,"Whenever my sister and I take our dogs to the groomers, we always stop by Red Robin for lunch and then shopping. The quality isn't as good as I remember, or maybe its just this location or... maybe I just chose the wrong burger but today's visit left me thinking that I shouldn't go to Red Robin anymore. My sister and I arrived at noon and were promptly seated by the host on their ""patio"" which is actually in the mall. Our server, Shannell was great. Super attentive, quick to ask us if we wanted fries and drink refills and was very friendly. Even though she got a bunch of tables back to back (and 2 large parties too), she still managed to give us great service.  I always get the freckled lemonade ($4.99), free refills! It wasn't very sour today and seemed a bit watered down IMO. My sister thought it was ok though.  - Bleu ribbon burger: tomatoes, lettuce, patty and blue cheese with a chipotle sauce I believe. I love blue cheese so I thought it would be a good choice but I was a bit disappointed when it came out. The buns weren't your traditional bun, and I think I was distracted by the blue cheese because I didn't notice that on the menu, it said onion bun! My burger was cold and the bun wasn't toasted. It wasn't very appetizing. I'm not sure if it was left to sit out while waiting for the fresh batch of fries to come out. My fries were also decent. I thought they could have stayed in the fryer for a tad bit longer.  - Fish and chips $13.49. 4 medium pieces of battered fish on top of a lettuce garnish and served with some tartar sauce and lemon. It came with bottomeless fries but my sister opted out for mac n cheese for $1.49 more. She really enjoyed the mac n cheese and thought the fish was just ok. Not the best she's had according to her.  Our server eventually got super busy, but I think a manager came by our table to ask us if we needed anything else. We requested a box. The cool thing is that you can pay at your table using the ipads they have on the table. Its similar to outback, applebees and other restaurants now a days.

Lissa M.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",81,14,8,1.0,4/16/2017,Food actually was good I had the black and bleu burger and it was cooked to my liking. Although it didn't have a lot of seasoning there is the house seasoning on the table to indulge. Fries hot and fresh onion ring tower was good. Only complaint if you order the bottomless fries you should actually receive unlimited amounts we didn't. So I would actually give the food 4 stars for the quality. For me it's very pricey for burgers and fries $45 for two people is a bit much and this would be my only deterrent for not frequenting the joint.  Service really needs some help there should be someone at the wait desk when you walk in or else why have there? Server was a bit slow on the refill jump but I guess maybe because it was a Saturday night. Update... Recently revisited had the same thing and it did not tastes the same burger was flavorless cold fries. The service is horrible slow uninviting and for some reason the place just feels dirty and sticky.

Mary Jane C.,"Torrance, CA",416,445,268,2.0,8/2/2014,"Red robin burgers are decent sized...  I have always asked to have them cut in half, so it would be easier to eat.  So, it was interesting when my waitress argued with me that they won't cut burgers in half anymore, then suggested she bring me a knife and I can cut it myself.  Why? Because it ruins the aesthetic value and won't look pretty anymore.  If this is truly Red robin policy, WTH corporate, seriously? If a customer wants a burger cut in half, cut the burger in half. So I ordered my usually veggie patty shroom burger with Swiss.  Know what happens? It comes out with a piece of corn on the edge of my plate (see photo).  So I get this lecture on how it's not pretty on my plate, but I get a stray piece of corn on my plate.. Got it. Also, our half order of onion rings came out burnt (see photo).  The onions inside were so withered and slimy from being overcooked.  I'm really disappointed  Red Robin.. You worry about pretty and now your food is coming out like this.  Seriously? Oh, and the hostess, despite checking on us.. I felt was having a bad day, so bad she had a poor attitude, didn't smile, couldn't even fake that she was an enthusiastic server.  Kind of had the ""oh well, get over it"" attitude when giving me the story on how they couldn't cut my burger, and the same attitude when asking how everything was (as if she cared).  Cheer up, buttercup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=80
Christiana W.,"Torrance, CA",180,173,11,2.0,10/9/2015,"I love red robin, just not this one! Every time I go it seems like there is not nearly enough employees for how busy they are. The employees always seem frantic and not able to give customers proper attention.  On our last visit, we had a very sweet waitress but she was very busy and did not check on us very often. We had been making small talk with a couple next to us and I thought they seemed nice. However, when the waitress brought out the check to our neighbors, the man started loudly complaining to our waitress. I felt so bad for her! He was being so loud and aggressive but kept saying ""I know it's not really your fault, you have to many tables to manage but....""  The waitress kept offering to get the manager but the man kept going off :( I would have liked to have said something but was kind of just shocked and we were already walking out. I felt like he could have just told her ""I can see you are working hard but we weren't happy with our experience today, can I speak with a manager"". It's not like it was her fault. You could tell she was working as hard as humanly possible.  One thing I love about red robin is all the refills and good attention. If I pay almost $4 for a freckled lemonade, it's nice to have it constantly refilled, same with fries, etc. By understaffing their restraunt, red robin is setting themselves up for unhappy customers and are ruining the positive reputation they otherwise could have",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=80
Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782,5.0,7/19/2014,"Reeeeed Robin ... yummmmmm. When I was in Hawaii, I would always see the Red Robin commercials on TV and want to go there even more, simply because there are no Red Robins in Hawaii.   But ever since I moved to California, I think I've been to Red Robin enough times to figure out my tried-and-true favorites. Even if I'm not a diehard burger fan, there's plenty on the Red Robin menu to choose from. One of my favorite entrees I ever got from Red Robin was discontinued--a full-sized entrée of creamy Mac & Cheese--but there are still a lot of menu offerings that I do like.   Of course, there will usually some sort of featured burger/promotion when you go to Red Robin, based on the time of year you are visiting or the different current events (sports events, etc.). But here are some of my favorites from the Red Robin menu:   ""Crispy Chicken Tender Salad"": This is my usual order whenever I go to Red Robin. This salad features a classic lettuce mix tossed with hard-boiled eggs, hardwood-smoked bacon, tomatoes and Cheddar, as well as chunks of Red Robin's classic ""Crispy Chicken Tenders."" The chicken tenders totally make this salad. There's a good amount of chicken that comes with the salad, and the dish is served with two pieces of garlic focaccia bread (especially amazing when they're warm) and your choice of dressing. While the honey mustard dressing is especially popular, I usually go for the blue cheese. This is probably one of my favorite salad entrees at a restaurant.    ""Smoke & Pepper"": This gourmet burger is one of the more recent additions to the Red Robin menu and is part of the eatery's recently launched ""Finest Gourmet Burgers"" line. This creation features a hamburger patty topped with black pepper bacon and extra sharp Cheddar cheese in between slices of a toasted ciabatta bun. The sandwich is served with the eatery's house-made Smoke & Pepper ketchup (which I opted to have on the side). I tried this burger when it first debuted and I was not disappointed with the creation. Basically, with this line of ""Finest"" burgers, Red Robin is upping the ante and creating more ""gourmet"" sandwiches. I loved the smoky, peppery flavor of this entrée, and it wasn't too spicy for me to handle. It tasted just fine without the ketchup, and a side of steak fries accompanied the burger, in true Red Robin fashion.   ""Bruschetta Chicken"": I've only tried this ""Bruschetta Chicken"" sandwich once, but I absolutely loved the pesto aioli. This dish is complete with grilled chicken breast topped with fresh bruschetta salsa, pesto aioli, Provolone, romaine lettuce and balsamic cream on rustic ciabatta bread. I ordered my sandwich with the salsa on the side, but the other flavors blended together perfectly. The chicken was tender, and the pesto-cheese blend was amazing, with the crunchy ciabatta to top it off.   ""Arctic Cod Fish & Chips"": I'm always on the hunt for a good fish 'n chips, and Red Robin's version doesn't disappoint. The eatery's version of this dish features premium hand-battered cod fillets that are fried to crispy perfection and served with bottomless steak fries. It's served with dill'd & pickle'd tartar sauce, and you can also use malt vinegar for additional flavor. If I don't feel like eating my usual salad or one of the chicken sandwiches, this entrée is my go-to.   ""Mac N' Cheese"": Though this is no longer an entrée (much to my dismay), you can still get the ""Mac N' Cheese"" as a side, and it also accompanies the ""Riblets & Mac N' Cheese"" entrée. I love this version of mac 'n cheese because it's classic yet incredibly creamy, featuring a cheesy blend of soft noodles.   ""Mountain High Mudd Pie"": I only had this dessert once, but boy, was it phenomenal. If you're an ice cream lover, then this is for you. The ""Mountain High Mudd Pie"" features piles of chocolate and vanilla ice cream layered with fudge, caramel and OREO cookies. I always get this dessert sans whipped cream because it has plenty of sweetness on its own. I love the combination of the OREO cookie crust, topped with the luscious ice cream and drizzled with the sticky caramel and fudge.   ""Gooey Chocolate Brownie Cake"": Though I can't say this ""Molten"" dessert is better than the one at Chili's, it's still a good sweet option to finish off your meal. This moist, indulgent chocolate brownie cake is topped with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge and is served with sweet strawberries and a berry sauce. The last time I had this brownie cake, there were a bit too many strawberries/too much berry sauce for my liking, as the sauce was a bit tart. But I love the texture of the fudgy brownie cake, and when combined with the vanilla ice cream and hot fudge, it's heaven on earth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=80

HOWEVER, i'm giving them a 1 star because the customer service is just awful. I went in on a Friday night - a wait for two people at 8:00pm was 20-25 minutes. Not bad. Until it turned out to be a 40 minute wait, and we arrived hungry. Once we finally got seated, a woman in a flowery shirt (the manager i'm assuming) took our drink order and told us our server will be right with us. She got our waters promptly and left. That was the last time any of the staff assisted us for a good 20-30 minutes. We waited and waited and waited, we didn't even know who our server was-- and guests who were seated AFTER us were already getting their food orders taken. I had to get up and let the manager know (who wasn't even paying attention to the floor, she was just mingling with the staff) that our server hasn't come in the past 30 minutes to take our orders. She then apologizes, and takes our order. She brings out a basket of fries with different sauces as an apology (which would've been nice, if we already didn't get bottomless fries with our burger). Finally our waitress, Shania, finally introduces herself, although she had passed our table a plenty amount of times while we were waiting to get our orders taken. I understand, she had a large party next to us, but if you can't handle that many people in your section maybe don't be a waiter??? It wasn't until AFTER the party left when she introduced herself.  The food was brought to the table and it was delicious we got the banzai burger and the sriracha tavern double, both came with bottomless steak fries. So with the fries from the manager, our actual meal with fries, Shania finally ""tries"" to be our waitress and brings us another basket of fries, ones that we don't want. We're already full, and irritated that the gesture just didn't seem enough anymore to redeem what little ""good"" customer service they had left. We didn't touch the basket, asked for the check and left. All in all, the food is pretty good here. However, if you come to this location, I recommend just getting take-out from here. We got there around 8, didn't finish until almost 10:30 because we waited so long. The managers really need to step it up here, pay attention to the floor, standing BEHIND the hostesses while chatting is not helping your establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=80

I think the reason they give you endless fries is because the portion they give is small.  The burger was pretty good. The sauces are really good but you have to pay for each serving. Over all it was okay.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=100
Varand A.,"Santa Clarita, CA",41,5,,3.0,7/23/2016,The food is amazing. The only problem is that it's like a meat locker in here! It's too cold; It's 70 degrees in here. I asked both my servers if the heater can be raised and they said they'd get back to me.... They never got back to me. I couldn't properly enjoy my food because I was shivering in my seat. My girlfriend even got goosebumps every few seconds. Couples across from us were also cuddling for heat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=100
Anastasia S.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,4,,2.0,4/11/2016,"First time in Red Robin, probably the last. The service is a very big issue. I ordered Avo-cobb-o salad - a salad that's supposed to have avocado as its main ingredient, but they brought it with no avocado at all! What???!!! I also asked them to toss it, but they didn't do it either so I had to send it back. They added some avocado but the salad still wasn't tossed. My boyfriend got Royal Red Robin burger, which was actually very tasty but barely warm. The fries weren't hot either, and when we asked our waiter to replace them with the hot ones, he brought new fries of exactly the same temperature - almost cold. Our waiter was very nice and friendly but it doesn't help much - with workers screwing up your orders Red Robin leaves a negative impression. It's very sad because the food could be delicious if served right and on time + the ambience is cool. I hope Red Robin fixes its issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=100
Satanik Z.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,2,2,1.0,10/16/2016,"SORRY EXCUSE FOR A BURGER-  Celebrating my birthday a day early .... Good thing I didn't have this on the day of because it would have ruined my birthday. After we were seated it took 15 minutes for a server to come to our table and only because I made eye contact with him. I ordered the Light Lemonade and it tasted watered down like hell. Tasted almost like a normal glass of iced water and even the refills after that tasted the same. I ordered the Buzz Mac N Cheese Double burger .... I should've gone to Johnny Rockets instead because it tasted horrible. A sorry excuse. That's what Red Robin should rename their 'Buzz Mac N Cheese Tavern' burger. It was terrible. Flat, No taste, Mac N Cheese BARELY had any cheese and the 2 patties were really thin with no taste and it was half the size as shown in the menu picture.... The frozen White Castle burgers from Target have more taste than this disgrace... A sorry excuse for a hamburger. The only taste I got out of it was the melted white sandwich cheese it had. I was close to going to California Pizza Kitchen which is across from it but I wanted a burger instead... BIG MISTAKE! I don't know if this burger is the same at any other locations because this is the first time I ordered but atleast at this location on this date October 16, 2016....

Food: Filling and on par. The bf got the royal red Robin and I ordered the avo-cobb-o salad and the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer. Everything came out on time and warm. My skinny alcoholic lemonade was delish also. Setting/environment: Noticed that the busser consistently cleaned tables and made sure there was available prepared/clean seating as soon as guests left. There are TV's with both the news and sports games on and our server was kind enough to change one to a basketball game for us. Service: Our server Khai was amazing and hardworking. I have worked in the restaurant scene before and he did extremely well taking care of every table and being on point with his friendly personality. We recognized how well organized he was in time management and making sure each guest was served excellently.

Bottomless fries are the bomb, can be a major gut buster if you don't control yourself. Service has always been great. Enjoyed the table top system to reorder drinks and pay.

TINY PORTIONS, Stale chips, the gauc and salsa cam in the same little containers I get my side of ranch in. My small amount of chips ran out of gauc and salsa.

They seemed to have redesigned the interior since my last visit about a year ago so it's bright, modern, and new looking.  The bar area's pretty nice and welcome, which is where I sat.  It seats about 6, I got there around 8pm and nobody was there.  There's also 4 tables behind, the rest of the dining area is built for tables of 4 or more + patio seating outside. They now have an ok happy hour with $3, $5, $7, $9 appetizers and alcohol around the $5 range (beer, wine, cocktails) which runs from around 6-closing I think.  The bartender told me that they were still running HH specials at least when I was there until closing.  I can see this being very popular after a night of shopping and hunger.  Looking at the new menu selections, they have some interesting burger combinations, some that looked like fancy creations out of steakhouses.  There was the Banzai (Hawaiian), the Bleu Ribbon, the Royal Red Ribbon (with an egg on top) to name a few plus about 10 others.  I ended up getting the Prime Chophouse with endless steakhouse french fries as the side, which you also get your choice of.  The burger was very meaty and juicy, plenty of mushrooms and the fried onions were great! It was very filling, I didn't have room for dessert or even for a refill of the fries.  The burger was good, there's also a new crab cake burger they were featuring which I'd love to try next time.  Ok service (I waited about 10 minutes after paying waiting for my change, so-so attention but I was sitting by myself at the bar so maybe she thought I'd get her attention if I needed it) Superpro hint: Get a free Customer Card and sign up for it, on your birthday they give you a free burger and also you get points everytime you spend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=60

I will not be going there anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=40
Rick S.,"Redondo Beach, CA",543,1619,11938,3.0,12/28/2015,"The quality of the burgers were good, but not a whole lot better than some of the fast food burgers like Burger King, McDonald's but may be more on par with the cooked when ordered counter service places like In N Out, The Habit, Fatburger and 5 Guys. The average meal or entree is about $10 and if you get a drink, add in tax and tip and you're at around $20 per person.  If you go a bit deeper with appetizers and/or fancier desert drinks, you'll land around $25 per person. I think the prices could go down a notch.  It's less about the portions in terms of their bottomless french fries (or the healither fresh fruit option) and the burger itself, but the patties should be a bit thicker (I'm not sure if the patties are made by a pressing machine or previously frozen but they're reminiscent of Burger King, which isn't bad, but here there's a gourmet price tag 3x+ higher than their fast food peer), and also enable customers to have them cooked to order (i.e., medium rare as opposed to medium well, their default) to get a truly fresh tasting juicy hamburger, so maybe the quality can be taken up a notch.  I'd say the unique ingredients and different named burgers is nice, but the foundation of the hamburger, the beef patty needs maybe a little more TLC in their approach to the perfect burger. I've been going to Red Robin  once in a while since the 1990's, and did notice the re-branding of the restaurant as ""Gourmet Burgers"" and I know it's been 25+ years with inflation and overhead (employee minimum wage increases too), so can't expect them to be too low, but I think maybe making the burger a bit more remarkable for the price is the solution.   Or have some sort of pre-priced menu with a meal for 2 for $15 (Any 2 burgers w/ bottomless fries) total w/ a soft drink could be a good marketing strategy. I think I felt maybe I could get more or from my perspective better value (be it quality or quantity) for my money, or paid less elsewhere for the same. The service here was fast and friendly as well as attentive. Parking was easy in the South Bay Galleria shopping center mall.  This is in the wing near what now used to be Nordstroms on the Hawthorne Blvd/Artesia (Redondo Beach Blvd) side/corner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=40

After waiting more than 20 minutes, it was the wrong salad and I wasn't offered bottomless fries while I waited for a replacement.  The new salad was an entree but I ate it anyway.  A different female manager came around during my wait and I told her service was so-so and she replied ""That's nice"".  Maybe English isn't her first language. No one apologized for the mix-up nor was a refill offered.  The server presented the check and after 10 minutes, I used the self-pay.  That's when he came around TWICE to wish me a happy holiday.  Had he done that a half hour prior, he would've received a better tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=40

We came here for dinner last night and immediately noticed that they changed their menus. They were a lot more organized and seemed to have a few new additions - but our favorites were still there so we ordered them: my mom and I always get the sauteed 'shroom burger and my dad and sister get the guacamole bacon burger. We are definitely creatures of habit - always getting the same thing, but we really love those burgers. However, when we received our burgers and took a bite, we were actually pretty disappointed because they just didn't taste the same. My dad and sister's guacamole bacon burger had a tiny blob of guacamole on it. There was such a small amount of it on there, my dad actually thought they forgot to put guacamole on it in the first place. My mom's and my sauteed 'shroom burger was extremely under seasoned. The mushrooms are usually really buttery and flavorful and this time they just tasted watery - no flavor at all! I had to ask for some horseradish to spread on the burger to get some flavor in there - but it wasn't really what I wanted. The only thing that saved the evening was our waitress. She was really great. She didn't even need to write down our orders, she just memorized them and didn't get a thing wrong. She brought everything out quickly and was very friendly - I wish I caught her name! So overall, this was a mostly disappointing visit. Our favorite burgers just weren't what they used to be.

Felicia H.,"Yorba Linda, CA",19,9,6,1.0,10/7/2016,"I decided to go into Red Robin's (for the 1st time ever) while I was waiting to pick up my eyeglasses. I chose to sit at the bar top because I thought service would be quicker. Not only was service below par, the bar area was not busy, and my bartender (Maria) seemed like she was overwhelmed or annoyed (or maybe both). As soon as I took a seat at the bar top she didn't say anything until she completed whatever she was doing. Then she asked me if I wanted drinks without handing me a drink menu or even a food menu. So at that point I had to ask her for a food menu, she handed it off to me but it was clear that she really didn't want to be bothered. I was looking at her screen and it wasn't full, and the other patrons at the bar top seemed content, so I don't know why she had that attitude. When I was finally ready to order, I had a request for the pacing of my food, I wanted my salad out first and the entree out after, she smirked and repeated my order. The food came out just like I wanted however, the chicken wings were so tiny and not even spicy. That was a disappointment, secondly she didn't ask me how I liked my food during the course of my time spent there. I'm giving one star because I can't give negative stars. Service at the bar top was poor and the food was subpar. What makes this horrible is the fact that it was my first time ever dining at Red Robin's and my experience was unpleasant, it wasn't a welcoming environment. I will definitely NOT be returning to Red Robin's. If you choose to eat at Red Robin's go at your own risk and set very low expectations, matter-of-fact don't have any expectations.  And if the bartender Maria, reads this (& I hope she does) you should really learn how to be sociable and personable if you're going to be bartending.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=120

What more could a fat girl want?  For a burger chain, I like Red Robin. Prices are decent and food is consistently good. Also I mean who can say no to bottomless steak fries? Not me. Last time I came I had their Tavern Double Cheeseburger and...it was better than the one I had in Vegas at that super fancy place owned by a very big name celebrity chef. So, yeah.  The Royal Red Robin is also a good choice, used to be my go-to, if you're in the mood for a messy burger with an egg on top. This location though I must say is probably my least favorite just because I don't really care for the layout of this restaurant. The flow is very strange since the entrace is right in the middle of the whole place. Also, it's attached to the mall so it can get pretty packed which in turn, typically causes this one to have very slow service. I've only been to a few other ones but they always have better service and seem a lot more put together.

So thank you Cynthia for doing that. You were very kind for doing that. Our main servee Elise finally came back 30 mins into being seated with mine and my husbands drinks. She told us that our kids shakes would come shortly. Everyone else in the back of the house and Cynthia started to bring out our food fairly quickly. Elise came back a couple of times asked us if we wanted refills and never came back with it. Kids didnt get their shakes until the end of the meal... And only because we told Elise she forgot them.

Elise, we saw how attentive you were with your other patrons, and we are sure that had you actually helped us we would have liked you..

I had to change out my water 3 times because there was food debris in each glass, including the third one, until I just decided to get a strawberry lemonade and push the water glasses to the side. Our server had to be asked multiple times for napkins, refills, and utensils before we got them and each time she made us feel like we were a burden for even asking. She made it seem like we were doing her an immense injustice by asking her for the basics, which she should have provided from the start! I was so annoyed by this that I decided not to get dessert so I could head out faster with my family. We ended up eating desserts at DQ in the food court upstairs where, despite the line, we were served quickly and with a friendly attitude.

The service is still nice but I can tell that It isn't as busy as it was 10 years ago. I finally found something on the menu (chicken strip salad) that is flavorful but doesn't upset my stomach.

This is a popular spot; prices aren't exorbitant so families with all ages of children, young couples and seniors too can dine here and not break the bank. No surprise really that this evening had a decent crowd. Ray greeted us with a smile and friendly demeanor. Took our order and within minutes out came the food. Of the food that arrived, only a quarter of it was a-okay, my burger. Her guacamole burger arrived with very little guac. Our extra crispy fries were limp and we could tell we're not fresh (we both like 'em well done). Ray offered to get us more, 2nd round was about a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the crisp that we like. Again the fries were lukewarm at best. By this time we had finished our burgers. A 3rd round arrived, this time they were crispy, but again not piping hot but passable. Ray was attentive and did the best he could...it seems it was the kitchen that didn't do their part.  And unfortunately we did not enjoy our experience.  My Sam Adams was icy cold and water was plentiful.

Erika G.,"Bellflower, CA",0,20,2,1.0,6/21/2015,"This is my first review and I've always had a decent dining experience when coming here, but I am completely grossed out right now. I came here today for a quick lunch. I ordered an appetizer, which was good, and a garden burger with mac n cheese as my side. My burger came out with fries instead of the mac n cheese. I had to put my order in again for my correct side. Waited for a few minutes, no problem. When I got my mac n cheese, I noticed that something black was sticking out on the side of the dish underneath the cheese. I thought somehow a topping of some sort was accidentally mixed in, but when I inspected it, I noticed that it wasn't a topping. It looked like a fairly large piece of glass or sharp object. I alerted my waitress and she calmly took it to the back. After 10-15 minutes, the manager came to my table and said that it looked like an acrylic nail. She proceeded to tell me that she asked all of her staff about it, but no one's nails matched the one that was found in my food. She then told me that none of the cooks or servers are allowed to wear fake nails or long natural nails. So....where did it come from? They make the mac n cheese individually so I would think that whoever prepared the dish would be the person to blame. The nail was actually baked into the noodles and cheese. The manager was nice and seemed to show concern so I did not make a scene, but this is serious. First, it's absolutely DISGUSTING. Do you know what kind of germs are under nails? Second, what if I swallowed it?! They took the burger off of my tab (still paid for my apetitzer and drink) and apologized, but if I choked and died, an apology would do no good. Hopefully management gets down to the bottom of this because it's unacceptable. I won't be eating here again anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=140
Alecks R.,"Torrance, CA",248,246,6,4.0,6/24/2014,"Although my quest for the perfect burger continues, I have to give credit where credit is due.  Red Robin is a staple for quality food and a good time. The environment and staff are always positive, welcoming, and the place is spotless. The collage of American photographs and memorabilia saturate the walls. This coupled with the HD televisions, full bar, and loud music make this place a reliable spot to grab a bite.  During today's visit, I grabbed Red Robin's blue cheese burger. A blue cheese burger is one of my favorite burgers and has been for a long time. But Red Robin's has to be the best blue cheese burger around. Not only did they add shoe string onions and an onion bun, but they threw on some mystery sauces that really caught me off guard. Coupled with their famous fries and table-top seasoning, it truly was a marvelous burger.  I specifically remember that towards the end of my meal, I thought to myself, ""THAT is one tasty burger!""

Scott S.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",708,558,1896,3.0,7/15/2014,"I believe the biggest problem with this location of Red Robin is their seating layout. It was not well thought out. All you have to do is go inside and you will quickly understand what I am saying. There are very few tables with any level of privacy or personal space, most on stacked right next to one another. I realize this is to maximize business. But, it is truly a poor business model as I know many people, including myself, who are very reluctant to go here due to this fact.   Then, there are the outdoor tables; where I prefer to sit. These tables are much more separated. The problem is, there is an exterior bench, right on the wall of this restaurant, where people sit and smoke. People also stand right next to the wall and smoke. This can really ruin your lunch or dinner.  The food is Red Robin. The servers are good or bad depending on who you get.  And, oh yeah, don't believe the commercial about a free burger on your birthday. The commercial doesn't tell you that you have to be signed up with their program to get one.

Jordan C.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,11,,1.0,4/18/2016,"Hello, The reasoning for this review is too share my recent experience and the horrible customer service at your South bay Galleria location. On April 14th, 2015 myself and my co-work stopped by to grab lunch. After browsing the menu, we were ready to order. I ordered my norm, in which was the 'Royal Red Robin"" with no bun and asked that my egg be cooked medium well. Before I could even get my request out regarding how I'd like my egg cooked, the waitress stated I could only choose from a"" well-cooked or sunny side up egg"". Then thought that was odd because I am a repeating customer and not ONCE has a waiter or waitress stated I could only choose between the two. I then expressed my concerns to her and asked could my egg be made medium well? Waiting for a response, her whole demeanor changed as if she was irritated I asked. She then stated ""well, the cook can only cook the egg those two ways"" and stood there. Then I guess she thought better of it and said let me go asked just to make sure. After she walks off, I go to the restroom and I see our waitress in the counter speaking with another worker of Red Robin, African American girl. Shortly after, the same girl I saw our waitress speaking to came over and pretty much told me what I could and couldn't order very rudely. Not once did she introduce herself, I'm not sure if she was a manger or not; however, I feel like a proper introduction of who you are would have been more appropriated rather than speaking to me anything less than a customer. I would include her name but she did NOT have on a badge. At this point I was feed up and if were hadn't been for my co-worker with me, I would have left!  And afterwards, I'm assuming our waitress did not want to serve us because another waitress starting serving us. Please help me understand, if I'm paying for MY food to be cooked a certain way, ""why is it so hard to do so""??? All I wanted was for my egg to be cooked medium well like I ALWAYS get it!  I absolutely love Red Robin and I often visit the Lakewood location, I've never had a problem.. They treat their customers so nice. We were in the area and stopped by and this location was beyond me.

Had to speak with management to substitute one burger for turkey as I don't eat Beef which was a small hassle when Islands substitutes easily and for free. So she charged me 2 bucks extra for the substitution, yet when the burger finally arrived to our table there was only ONE patty, not two! (Sad face)  Feeling spiritual and on a ""date night"".... I didn't complain. The burger is NOT big and luscious like it looks like in the commercial either. NO two handed monster burger, not even close. The bun is a wee bit bigger than a McChicken's bun. It's a generally small burger but just enough food to be pleasantly full along with eating the bottomless fries. Also our fries were prepared fresh and arrived piping hot as I requested. ""Interesting"" Turkey Patty though... It's a pretty Odd, SUPER poultry flavored turkey patty overly moist and dripping with broth that tasted completely unnatural and manufactured. Like a giant McFrankin' nugget....I could only imagine the blended up turkey parts slapped together and molded into a patty.  I bet I won't catch a cold for years I'm so chicken juiced up, LoL!!

It was cold. Asked for another cup. Five minutes later, my drink came, and it was watered down and flat. Had to ask for another one of that.  Food came, no napkins or silverware. Had to GET UP and ask for that because most of the servers were congregating near the hostess area and having a good time with each other instead of making rounds and seeing if people needed anything. I couldn't get anyone's attention! No one checked on us, and the only time we were asked if we needed anything else was after we had already gotten everything ourselves practically. Just bad service all around. The servers were more into chatting wtih each other than paying attention to the customer. The food is good here. I've never had anything bad. The food is 4 stars.

Also, RR now has these little tablets at every table that you can order food on, play games, pay your bill or call your server. Apparently these things do nothing as I pushed the button to CALL SERVER and all it does is blink. I have no idea if it's relaying to the front or if it's just supposed to get the waiters attention with the tiny blinking red light on it.

Red Robin isn't the joint I usually go to for my burger fix and I bet it has been tough to compete with the rise of gourmet burgers in the restaurant scene. Their free birthday burger promo definitely lured me in to give Red Robin a try. RR isn't horribly expensive (avg $10 a burger with side) but their burgers are pretty regular and definitely smaller than expected (I could finish an entire burger on my own). The best part is their bottomless side!! You can get either fries, BROCCOLI or a side salad. They do give a small portion of the side (probably so one doesn't waste) but you can keep ordering them.  Service was pretty average...probably because we sat at the bar area. We felt bad asking for more refill of our bottomless side. Looks like this place is one of those I'll frequent once a year ;)  Parking: Easy (located in the South Bay Galleria)  Additional loyalty club perk: free 10th item (they also offer entrees, salads, etc...)

Yesterday was my first visit to this Red Robin.  We were seated at a table in the bar area, which was a mistake.  After sitting for a solid 5-10 minutes without anyone acknowledging us or offering to pour a drink, the waitress finally arrives.  I ordered a diet coke - which was completely and utterly flat (some people like this, I do not). I was able to get through two sodas without the food arriving.  At that point, we had already been sitting in the restaurant for more than 30 minutes.  I was starving.  Looking around, I realized that the handful of people seated before us also remained food-less.. this didn't bode well. When the food finally came, my burger was acceptable and what I expected from a Red Robin.  Getting the check was another 20 minute ordeal (even when my companion just shoved his card into the waitress' hand without taking the check to examine it).

I want to say that out of all the times I've been here, I've only had one time where I said, ""Hey, this was awesome service."" Actually, the first time I ever went to this location was for my birthday. I took a rather large party, so I knew service would be a bit slower than usual; what I didn't expect was taking 20 minutes to take our order, half an hour for food, and upon receiving my food, still seeing cheese on the patty after I asked for none and let her know I was vegan. 20 more minutes later I get my burger, but not my sweet potato fries. 15 minutes later, I got my fries.  Worst experience ever.

But remember this, every waiter is a gate keeper to more fries and its an up hill battle to get more of them with extra ranch. You will never win, you will always get less fries then you expect and the servers will never give them all up. Truth be told Red Robin hires leprechauns and they like to hoard all there golden fries and parade around them at the end of the night.

Neal N.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,108,1,1.0,8/29/2012,"I regret choosing Red Robin over Island Burgers to eat dinner at.  It should have been a tall tail sign that we made the wrong choice when the restaurant is pretty empty at 7:45 PM.   Upon entering, we saw several tables that were littered with the previous diner's cups, utensils, and baskets (food is served in a basket).  After we were seated a waitress was prompt in taking our food and beverage order, but extremely slow in bring out our drinks.  In fact, our drinks came out at the same time our food did.   To further emphasize our wrong decision on where to eat at, the person that served our food said, ""it's really slow here tonight.""  Well, if it's that slow, then why didn't you take the initiative to clean the dirty tables rather than stand around the bar area and watch television?   Eventually our waitress came back around and asked if we wanted refills on our beverages and more fries.  I wonder what gave her the impression we would like a refill, us sipping on a straw to obtain the last bit of melted ice from the bottom of our cups?  Plus, how are you supposed to enjoy a burger without fries?  On the plus side, the burger was cooked well and had a lot of flavor. After what seemed to be an eternity of starring at dirty tables and staff standing around the bar area, which was actually 15 minutes, we still haven't received our refills.  At that point, we wanted neither and just wanted to get out of there.  I was impossible to get the attention of anybody, so we had to go to the front counter to ask for our check. I guess it was evident we weren't satisfied with our service, so the hostess retrieved the manager to ask about our experience.  We explained to her our complaints and issues regarding the service and she apologized.  It wasn't until she actually looked around the restaurant for herself and realized we weren't exaggerating how dirty the restaurant looked.   If you're contemplating on where to eat while you're at the South Bay Galleria, consider Island Burgers or California Pizza Kitchen.  You don't want to leave a restaurant with regret and remorse, but a satisfied pallet and tantalized taste buds.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=300

But of Course we don't  always get the same good costumer service we give.

Mike S.,"Lomita, CA",56,36,8,2.0,6/25/2015,"My very first time ever stepping in to this place.  I don't come to this mall very often, but I am aware it has been her.  My wife and I took our kids and met her sister and her kids for a late dinner.  Checked in about 745ish and was told it would be about 30 min for a table(there was an entire section on the inside part of the mall that had 4 or 5 empty tables).  About 825 we were seated(I was changing a diaper) and everyone was asked what they wanted to drink.  From what I was told, water was not offered(I know in some places you need to ask for water now, so I am not holding it against anyone).  I made it back and was told everyone ordered drinks, I added coffee to it.  About 10 minutes later my wife and her sister got there drinks and I got my coffee, and none of the kids drinks were delivered.  From there we ordered our food.  I actually gave our waitress the ultimate decision of placing my order(gave her 3 options and let her pick) Just before the food arrived about 20 min later, two of the kids drinks arrived(milk and chocolate milk), After the food was put down we asked about another drink that was missing along with utensils and napkins(we had none).  I also asked about a side that was ordered with my sons meal and she went to get it. When she came back she did not bring the utensils(burgers are easy but mac n cheese is a little tricky) and did not mention the missing drink.  She came back about 5 min later with forks and one napkin for each person, and we were told there were no clean knives(at this moment, I am thinking to my self, ""what the serious Fuck?""  How do you have a restaurant and not enough silverware for your guests?) and still no drink.  I took a bite of my burger, but then took the baby to let my wife eat.  Finished my cup of coffee.  I was asked in a pass by attempt if I wanted more coffee, which i definitely needed....  several minutes go by and I got up to walk around with the little fluffball.  I noticed that she wound up bringing a cup over.  When I made it back to the table, no creamer(wa wa waaaaaaaaa)  I was walking around still and asked our waitress if she could bring some creamer over...after a few more minutes of walking, I got to eat, the meal was the teriyaki chicken sandwich and it was very tasty, the SMALL cup of fries were tasty.  She walked by our table a few more times.  I was done with my food, my black coffee was still sitting there and about 10 minutes later she brought the creamer, and the check...(In my time walking around I saw a few people that were seated after us, and they got knives....)   I paid and I left...I honestly did not leave a big tip, $75 bill, and I left $10(I felt that was generous for poor service in my opinion) From what I heard, the food was good all around, but that bottomless fry idea did not exists at our table, not one was asked if they wanted more.  Once again, first time here, maybe I am supposed to ask, but if I didn't have to ask for more coffee, I figured I wouldn't have to ask for more fries... From there, we went outside to hang out for a bit and let the kids play and after about 20 minutes I looked in at where we were sitting, still a mess.... Overall, yes the food was tasty, but waiting, service, and vibe play a big part for me.  I am always willing to give a second try to a place, but a little effort will go a long way....(I am sitting here at 1145 pm drinking my second cup of coffee now....)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=220

Nicole J.,"Gardena, CA",72,118,562,3.0,5/5/2012,"I've been coming to the South Bay Galleria since I was a pre-teen (oh gosh that was so long ago..waaa) and would always see Red Robin, but never went in. My co-worker Denise asked me to lunch and was surprised when I told her that I had never been before. Located next door to Nordstroms, we were greeted by two friendly employees. We got there pretty early so it wasn't crowded and we had choice of where we sat. Red Robin is known for the different types of burgers they offer. Having gone to various burger places (The Counter, Fat Burger and Ruby's to name a few), I would've expected their selection of burgers would have been a bit bigger. If you look at the menu there are a lot of burgers listed, however many of them have similar ingredients so there wasn't that much of a distinction among some of them. Not a deal breaker, but an observation to note.  I ordered a raspberry limeade drink mixed with sprite. It was really good, I may have to make a home version of it because it was really tasty. The other good thing about this drink is that it fell into the ""refillable"" category which was a plus. Most restaurants that have specialty drinks will let you have refills without having to pay. The only drinks deemed refillable are the sodas, teas and lemonades so this was a pleasant surprise.  For food I got a patty melt. I must say it is really hard to find good patty melts these days. It just didn't have that ""patty melt"" taste for me. The bottomless fries were pretty good, however ours seemed like they'd been sitting under a heat lamp rather than being freshly cooked. And since we were one of the first in the restaurant, you wouldn't think that we'd have warm fries, but rather hot out the fryer.  Red Robin has a full bar area and also have televisions throughout the bar area so I would think it would be a nice place to catch a game or come in for happy hour.  The ambiance was pretty nice and our server was really attentive, however it wasn't a memorable enough place for me to want to return.

Jonathan P.,"Los Angeles, CA",456,184,91,1.0,1/7/2015,"I will never again go to a Red Robin restaurant again. 3 days ago, I had no opinion about Red Robin. I had been there probably twice before in my life. This review reflects my experience from 2 nights ago.  I've never in my life visited a restaurant with as poor customer service relations as this place. Neither managers appeared to care about customer satisfaction, even when they were clearly in the wrong. This goes for both the personnel and corporate relations.  So what is it that was so horrible. Let me start of first by saying that I would not have chosen to come here if it was not for the Free Birthday Burger voucher that was sent to me unsolicited by Red Robin. So, I grabbed my roommate and came down to have some drinks and a burger. When we first got there we were handed menus which were stuck together with the stickiest of syrup all over them. Do they not have the decency to at least clean off their menus? It was very disgusting. Little did I realize that the attitudes of the manager and servers would be equally disgusting. After ordering drinks, I handed the bartender my voucher and expected it to be honored as it was legitimate and was nothing fraudulent on my part. It even had my name on it. The bartender returned and said that they would need my club/membership card or something to that effect. I had absolutely no idea what they were talking about. The Free Burger Voucher had nothing written on it at all regarding some club membership. In fact, written on the voucher, it said to just ""hand it to your server and enjoy a free burger! "" So I asked the bartender to bring over the manager. He was of no help and reiterated the same ""requirement"" that was not mentioned in the voucher. At this point, I'm feeling bamboozled.  I think this is called Bait and Switch. I asked them, why would I receive this voucher from your corporate PR/marketing department if they did not intend to honor it. I even showed the manager the email it came in on my phone to show that it was legitimate. I basically got the sorry your loss attitude as if I were some freeloader who can't afford to buy myself a burger. Now I know managers have the discretion to make customers happy, especially in situations of no fault by the customer. Not here. I was basically told they won't honor it, and my business is of no concern to them. They weren't interested in the business that would have been generated from the rounds of drinks we intended on consuming in celebration of my birthday, but also my roommate would have purchased a dinner. Instead, they preferred to leave me with a sour taste in my mouth, and stickiness all over my hands from their dirty menu. Instead, the manager preferred to leave me with the worst possible impression on their establishment that could be possible. Like I said, I went from having no opinion of Round Robin before going there, to now having the worst possible opinion of their establishment and their personnel. I will never again go to Red Robin, which means my friends and family that go out with me will never go there also.  For Red Robin Corporate/Marketing department, I would suggest that you not send out Birthday Vouchers that you don't intend on honoring. Lucky for us there was an Island's right around the corner that had an excellent late night happy hour. The food was great and the service there was excellent. Although we wasted half an hour at Red Robin just to get the Round Robin treatment, Island's came to the rescue for the night. We were happy to spend our $$ there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=220

CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE?!! HOPE YOU FOLKS HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND!!!"" Did not seem very sincere and looked bothered. We really weren't complaining to the manager.

My companion asked for onion rings with his order but he got fries instead. So he had to ask for onion rings once again.

We were seated promptly next to a party of 10 and the server took our drink and food order.  The rest was downhill from there. As we sat there waiting, for what seemed like forever, we noticed the party next to us getting their food. Only half of them did. When they asked the manager what had happened he stated that the computers don't take large orders so they had to split the order into 2. Ok, fine. When the rest of their order came they were all enjoying it until another server turned to the gentleman and told him that his order was switched with his buddies (he had already eaten half of his burger) . He ordered a BOCA burger, being as how he's been a vegetarian since high school, and he buddy ordered a steak burger.  The man looked mortified. He didn't say much but the rest of the party asked to speak to the manager. Then our food came, I ordered a wrap and my boyfriend ordered a salad. Our FORKS WERE FILTHY, my fries were ICE COLD, and the server was no where to be found. Our drinks were empty, their was no condiments, and it just wasn't a pleasant experience.

I just did not really enjoy anything. maybe i should have ordered a burger since i guess that's their specialty  first the water is the most disgusting thing i have ever tasted. It tasted like sewer water.  It was clearly from the tap which i honestly cant say i have a problem with but it must be something in the pipes in that area because it was disgusting to the point that I got sick to my stomach and didn't even finish it, i didn't take more than 3 sips and i still got sick. I ordered the southwest grill chicken salad, it was just OK. way too many ingredients, but that is my fault because perhaps i should have ordered a simpler salad and something was off with the dressing, I couldn't put my finger on it  but the salad was just meh. I also ordered a cup of clam chowder which came out luke warm. I never send food back to the kitchen for fear of it being spit in etc so i chalked it up and ate the luke warm soup. It was ok...seemed like it would have actually been OK tasting if i was hot. the focaccia bread it came with was very good.  My godson ordered some burger that was suppose to have barbeque sauce on it and it had none and as he is the type of kid to keep quiet, he didn't say anything and no one notice until after it was all gone. Our waitress was OK nothing special ...it did take forever for her to bring out an order of fries and she kept bringing half the tables stuff and then return 5-10 minutes later with the other half (and that included drinks for example she brought my nasty water and anothers root beer at the same time and then 5-10 min later brought the other 3 people their drinks, who does that? it was just drinks, like soda, water, tea no one ordered alcohol. anyway i wont be returning unless a kid in my life request to go again but you can be sure i will try to persuade them out of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=340

The host was a young man and told me it would be 10 minutes to seat me because it was busy. No Worries, it was busy.  In a few minutes I was seated at a table and my waitress was Natalie, she was so cool, she bought me some of those killer fries before my food came. Then there was Jeanette, I called her ""The Dancing Queen"", she complemented me and did a gig down the isle which caused me to laugh out loud and pull her over to me. I was like you really like your job  and she replied, ""I love people and I treat them as if they are at my home"". That did it for me, like wow how righteous is that, so very.

She checked up on me often and I didn't feel ignored in any way by them except for the black girl at the host podium, she passed by everyone and asked how were they and looked at me and turned her head. But I didn't trip because she wasn't important to me even though I should've gotten her name so I can put her on Blast right now (next time I won't be so polite about it), But I didn't let it take away from my experience there and still will give 5 stars, and I stuffed myself on those crazy good fries until I couldn't eat any more.

The problem is it can get very busy and when it is busy, the service suffers. Last weekend we visited this location and it took 30 minutes for us to receive our drinks after we ordered them. We were getting up to leave when we saw the waitress come with our drinks so we sat back down. We mentioned this to the manager and he took the drinks off of our bill, which was nice.

When we were first seated a woman by the name of Theresa was our waitress. She was super friendly and I appreciated her positive attitude. Unfortunately I didn't appreciate the service. I'm not saying it's all her because she's a sweet woman and helped me out when I asked her to fix the bill for having lemon or some kind of foreign substance on my cup. I think I'm just more mad at the person who trained her. How could they not teach her to look at a glass before giving it to someone? And I'm also mad at whoever trained her because they didn't train her to wait at least 5 mins after getting my food to ask me how things are doing.  I don't know if I hadn't had a chance to take a bite yet. And thirdly, I felt that after she asked how the food was she felt that the customer service was over because I never seen her until it was time for the check. I had another waitress get me a refill on fries and to fix my drink. Normally this place is pretty good even when it's busy but the service today definitely sucked!

Eric K.,"Torrance, CA",39,26,25,4.0,7/26/2011,"Red Robin reminds me a lot of Fuddruckers, but with one distinct advantage: It actually exists. Until recently, I had been searching tirelessly for the Fuddruckers location that supposedly exists in Torrance (allegedly near Lucille's BBQ) to no avail. Hungry and annoyed, I decided to give up and check out Red Robin and the mall attached to it. Part of the Hawthorne Galleria mall, Red Robin is an innocuous diner that juts into the parking lot, along with Starbucks and CPK. Its decor is nothing special: booths; soft, cushioned seats; metal trim. Honestly, I never got a good look because I've always ordered for take out. Ordering for take out sets Red Robin apart from its competitors. As you enter and tell the hostess your intentions, you take a seat, and then the waitress sits right down next to you to take your order. The first time this happened, I was taken aback, as I did not expect this level of service from a burger joint. Red Robin sets the bar in this regard. As for the food, I usually order the bacon cheeseburger, with no tomato, cooked medium-rare. Thick cuts of bacon accompany a large beef patty, lettuce, and sauce, and the bun is toasted--possibly cooked in bacon grease or oil. It is not the best burger I have ever had, but it's really darn good. And it comes with thick, crispy steak fries. I am not a fan of thick steak fries, but these are pretty good. But here is the secret: don't order a drink. After I place an order, I hop on over to Nordstrom's Espresso Bar in the mall and treat myself to an Italian cream soda. It's so good, but it obviously doesn't contribute to Red Robin's rating. Okay, maybe a little bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=320
Sarah H.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,25,2,1.0,3/16/2015,"This is going to be a rant so I will tell you up front...  Food is ok. The service is TERRIBLE!       I walked in at around 7:45pm on a Monday night, there was no host and only about 6 tables in the whole place. I tried to get the attention of the many servers and what looked like a manager who walked by but they seemed to be too busy to simply acknowledge me. So I waited at the host stand and looked at a menu for 5 minutes before (who I believe to be the manager) came over to me. Before even asking how many were in my party or my name he told me to wait and he would get me when the next table became available. .. Ok. I realized they were probably all just flustered or something because there was another man waiting, visibly aggravated (apparently they had messed up his whole Togo order and he had been waiting for almost 30minutes)  My boyfriend showed up to meet me. We were greeted by a host finally who asked my name and preference for a table Or booth .. Booth .. She was polite told me it'd be 5 minutes. Then walked away. Again the manager came up to us, said to follow him, I could see he was walking us to a table and I was trying to explain to him Id like to wait for booth, he was very hard to communicate with, he cut me off and said ""oh ok. You want booth?"" Then just walked away leaving us in the middle of the restaurant.  Confused we walked back to the waiting area and sat down. Few minutes later a server came up to us and again asked how many and the name and walked us to a booth.  Finally we are seated, server said she'd be right with us and offered us water in the meantime. We both said yes she said she'd send someone over with them.  Waters never came.  It was now almost 8:36 and we had nothing infront of us but our menus finally she came back and asked if we were ready to order, I really wanted to try a mix drink. I picked two and asked her id she had tried either, she picked her favorite. He ordered a burger and coke, I ordered a vodka drink and half boneless wings. And now we wait.. And wait...   What seemed like too long. She came back with his coke and a water for me, told me my drink was being made, that she'd be right back with it.  9pm the rude interrupting manager, hastily brings us our food (still no drink) we had no silverware or napkins.  The server comes soon after to tell me that there is no vodka to make my drink and if I'd like something else.  No thanks. Just napkins. Refills. A box for the wings and a Togo container of ranch. 9:48 She brought back lids for the drop of ranch i had left and the check. I never got a water refill.

Charis H.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,3,,1.0,3/28/2014,"VERY DISAPPOINTED With Customer Service. This review is a little late since the incident happen a month ago, but anyway.  I am Gluten Free (GF) - not by choice, unless I choose to be sick.   This review only applies to the REDONDO BEACH LOCATION - I have never had an issue with the Lake Forest, CA or  Hillsboro, OR (the two I visit most often) or the other locations I have gone to in the past years. I was working on a small project in the South Bay and the producer said I could order food from a place of my choosing since the restaurant they ordered from was not GF Friendly.  I choose Red Robin, I have been to several Red Robins in different cities and states and was always happy with the service I received - especially the fries. So I ordered a basic GF Bun (as listed on the menu) with a standard hamburger.  The hostess taking the order with GF Bun and GF Fries saying there was no issue with fulfillment.  Of course they had a contact number if anything needed to be questioned or revised.    So the very kind, and extremely busy, Producer's Assistant goes to the RED ROBIN GOURMET BURGERS in REDONDO BEACH and finds out there are no Gluten Free buns as originally promised and they do not have any Gluten Free fries.  -  So they could not fulfill the requested order. I completely understand that they run out, but that is the whole point of giving your phone number so they can contact you to let you know of changes - not when you show up and 20-30 minutes when the order is suppose to be ready.   Well the Order was not ready and they were waiting for the customer to revise.  If I had been informed sooner,  I might have changed my order to something easier.  Just like when you order dining in, the waiter or waitress comes by and lets you know within minutes of the order being placed if there is a problem. The Assistant made the best call - since they did not know what items they had in stock she got me a lettuce wrap and a side salad, which granted was healthier but not as enjoyable.  As most GF people know salad tend to be the safest order at most restaurants... but I am kinda sick of Salad as the only option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=240

In theory it's a great idea, lots and lots of fancy sounding burgers with a full gambit of toppings. Sadly, Red Robin is a huge chain and failed to deliver quality.  Trying to be health conscience, I ordered the A-1 Peppercorn Burger. With only 1029 calories, 59 grams of fat, 2042mg of salt, and endless fries, I should have ordered two of them, but decided one was enough.  Surprisingly the burger didn't look half bad. Too bad the good times ended there. The meat was ground way too fine and packed way too tight. This amounted to a dry and chewy burger that didn't have much beefy taste. To further spoil the burger the default bun for the peppercorn burger was an abomination of bread that diverted all possible meaty enjoyment to the off-putting flavor profile that it brought.

Tara G.,"Gardena, CA",5,64,,1.0,12/27/2014,"This location has gone downhill over the past few years. At one time they removed their spinach and artichoke dip from the menu - then when it returned, it was NOT the same. They also got rid of the ""Just In Quesadilla."" More recent visits have garnered dry burgers with scant toppings, enough bread in the bun to feed an army for a week, and ""blah"" french fries. Tonight - well, tonight was the end for me. Our server Liz was top notch. Every table in her section was filled but she made us feel like we were her top priority. She easily answered my questions about certain menu items, did not pressure us to order too quickly, and was generally attentive. Appetizer came, one of the three appetizer plates was very dirty, with visible dried food stuck on it. Ditto for one of the glasses of water. Ew. Easily rectified though. There were three of us in my party. My two companions ordered the clucks & fries, and the clucks & shrimp. Both of those meals were just ok - dry chicken and a lettuce leaf garnish that was so huge and wet it had to be removed immediately to prevent soggy french fries.  I ordered the macaroni and cheese as a side dish, and it was actually very good. I also ordered the boneless Whiskey River chicken wings, which are on a separate menu and I think are a limited time item. These are served with the onion strings and home made potato chips. The first piece I tried seemed to be mostly fat, so I did not think much of it and set it aside. The second piece was fairly large, so I attempted to cut it apart with my fork. I was about to give up and ask for a knife when I noticed WHY it would not cut - IT WAS RAW. Not just a little, and not just a small portion - RAW ALL THE WAY THROUGH, as in NOT COOKED and PINK. It just so happened that Liz and another lady who I presume was possibly the manager arrived at the same time to ask if everything was ok, and I passed my plate over and discreetly let them know what the problem was. They were both very kind and apologetic, and said they would speak with the kitchen staff. Several times they offered to re-do it or replace the item but I declined. I only requested they remove the boneless wings from my bill; the end result was a much larger discount and adjustment. For that, I have to say the customer service was excellent.

I've been here twice, and both times, the wait is ridiculously long and the waiters are incompetent. If this restaurant was cooking steaks or 5 star Italian with a crowded area, I'd understand. But, it's burgers and fries. It doesn't take almost an hour to deliver the most basic American dish. And on top of this, people who came in after us received their food 20 mins before ours. This occurred TWICE. The waiter, Mauricio, wrote my order wrong and then blamed me for the mistake. I told him, specifically, what I wanted while pointing to the item on the menu. He also forgot an onion soup that we explicitly ordered and never returned our refills. BUT he blamed me/us? This waiter is clearly forgetful and needs to work elsewhere.   I asked the manager, ""Why does it take so long?"" She attempted to explain using the current occupancy, which couldn't have caused 50 mins of waiting with so many empty seats available, and concluded that a chicken sandwich took longer to make. But, after I told the waiter to correct my order at the kitchen, it took less than 4 mins, not 40 mins. Then she spoke to us like we made the mistakes, yet our water, two lemonades, and onion soup still hadn't came. We requested those items 10 minutes beforehand.   This place is ridiculous.

My Royal Red Robin Burger looked great - bacon and cheddar (instead of American), tomato, and a big fried egg on top - yum!  Bf got the lettuce wrapped Whiskey River BBQ Burger and a salad with oil and vinegar (his order was a result of post-cupcake carb guilt).  I got the seasoned steak fries and he got a side salad with oil and vinegar (he had a LOT of post-cupcake carb guilt). The burgers were yummy, but maybe we shouldn't have taken a look at the calorie count chart that they put on all the tables.  My burger was 1,191 calories with 2,090 mg sodium, 83 grams of fat and 48 grams of carbs!!  Holy what???!!!  The fries added 434 calories with 444 more grams of sodium, 18 grams of fat and 60 grams of carbs!

Jp P.,"Torrance, CA",0,14,5,4.0,9/9/2014,"Not gonna lie. Things started very, very roughly. Came for dinner after a long day, hungry and ready to grub. Took the server a long time to approach the table. 20+ mins. We were initially approached for drinks by the bus-boy. Indicative of good team work, at least. Server finally came. We were ready and ordered our app and meal at once. Appetizer came within an appropriate length of time. Food tho, well...that showed up about a half-hour after we finished our appetizer. And of course, it was cold. Considering we'd both ordered vegan patties....this was ridiculous. When the waitress returned, I voiced my frustration. She immediately offered to make me another but I was starved, I told her not to worry about it. I'd eat the one she served. The vegan patty was bland but no big deal, that's what you get when you order vegan at a burger joint. So there I sat, eating my cold, bland vegan burger - conjuring up a scathing review when she appeared. Stephanie (the waitress) had brought me a freshly made burger. ""Even though you said not to, I had them make you a fresh one anyway"" she said. ""I've also taken care of both your burgers"". ""I'm sorry for delay in your meals [she inserted an excuse about a computer failure here], I hope you'll at least take this one home with you"". It was as if she'd simultaneously given me warm hug and slapped the negative review right out of my head.  I was impressed. And grateful at the effort she'd made. It reminded me that outstanding customer service - even when so much has gone wrong - can always win someone back. Although I won't be back for the amazing vegan burger, I will be back, and RR can thank Stephanie for that.

Rae D.,"San Jose, CA",412,115,32,5.0,1/5/2010,"I've been here plenty of times.  I had to review this today because it just so happened that I ate here for lunch... and dinner.  Yes, I know.  I'm such a pig. Let's start with lunch... I had the peppercorn burger which is always good.  Their burgers have never really disappointed me.  In the past, I've had their whiskey river bbq burger and their royal red robin burger.  Both equally satisfying.  Maybe the Royal burger is better just for the fact that it has a jumbo fried egg!  Personally, I prefer skinny fries but how can you go wrong with bottomless steak fries!  I usually ask for a side of their onion ring sauce for the fries... tasty! On to dinner...  I felt so guilty for coming again that I decided to stray away from the burgers.  Instead I had the clam chowder soup and caeser salad.  The salad was decent but I absolutely loved the soup!  It's so much more creamy than others.  Very pleasantly surprised that there were a lot of clams, too!   So I had one of my friend's steak sliders, too.  Really good.  What really got me were the garlic parmesan steak fries.  Hell yeah.  I thought I was going to burst.  I seriously could not stop eating them.  Just thinking about them right now makes me want more! This Tuesday night must have been special because that was the first time I ever saw the Red Robin mascot greeting customers at their tables.  My companions have said they've seen the mascot before but not I!  =)  Mike, the manager, took the time to come to our table and check to see if everything was okay.  We voiced some concerns about past problems.  I told him that I loved Red Robin so much I had to come back for dinner... maybe I should show up for breakfast tomorrow?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=360
Diana I.,"Los Angeles, CA",2263,1137,1415,3.0,6/4/2009,"I used to come here all the time when I was younger! My friends and I would eat here at the beginning or end of a fun shopping day at the mall. I remember really loving this place! But sadly, with age, this place has lost its sparkle.  Their burgers are okay.. maybe a little overrated. They have a wide selection though and they come with bottomless fries. But I don't particularly like their fries because they're the fat soft kind, not the thin crispy ones!  But what's good is their seasoning! They have a bottle of their seasoning on each table so you can sprinkle more onto your food! It adds a nice little kick! Now when I go, I usually get their crispy chicken tender salad ($9.99) which comes with fried chicken breast tenders, hard-boiled egg, tomatoes, cheddar cheese and tiny bits of bacon. You can get any dressing you want with it but I'd definitely recommend the poppyseed honey mustard! MMM I looove honey mustard! The salad also comes with two small pieces of pita-like bread with garlic on it. Portions are pretty big too! I can never finish the salad! But one thing I will always love is their freckled lemonade, which is their strawberry lemonade but it's not the fake powdery kind (or maybe partially it is?). It has actual strawberries in it (or what used to be actual strawberries... haha). Basically, what I'm getting at is you can see the black strawberry seeds swimming in your lemonade, hence ""freckled!"" Makes it seem more authentic, like you're in the countryside sitting in your rocking chair on the porch, watching your father feed the horses... Service is kinda quick but less than friendly.

Hannah H.,"Gardena, CA",0,3,1,2.0,6/19/2015,"Well to summarize.. it was the worst service we ever had. It wasn't too busy but our waitress was just really slow and seemed like she just really didn't want to be there. To the point, I ordered a medium rare burger with an onion bun and specifically told her that I was allergic to sesame seeds and couldn't eat the regular bun. When she brought the food, it had a regular sesame bun but before I could say anything she walked away.. We didn't see her again for almost 15 mins. I let her know I couldn't eat it, without even saying sorry, she took it to get me another one. 20 mins later, everyone is done eating and she said it's still going to be a few more minutes. Again no apologies.. finally my food gets there and it's almost burnt but it has the good bun so I just eat it. Not to mention after all this time, she wasnt even refilling our drinks. At this point I am actually expecting a discount because of how horrible it was. She could have even not charged me for my garlic aolli and I would have been satisfied. (Btw, charging for sauces when people are ordering a bunch of food anyway is ridiculous.. how much does that really cost you? ..for another time.) We may go back, we may not.. but if we do, have it together..

Matthew C.,"Austin, TX",4,8,,5.0,5/31/2015,"Red Robin is my favorite chain restaurant, narrowly beating out Outback Steakhouse. The burgers are huge, juicy and savory. The special seasoning at the tables is so amazing that I frequently remove the cap and just inhale deeply. The thick-cut steak fries are delicious and, of course, come with unlimited free refills. They even bring out orders of fries for the table before the meal comes, like Mexican restaurants do for chips. The root beer floats are sweet and fizzy and, like the fries, are bottomless. Word of advice: come here with an appetite. They never stop bringing you seconds and you need two or three refills of everything to really appreciate the experience. For dessert, I recommend the Towering Doh! Rings...miniature croissant/doughnuts all stacked on a giant wooden peg. Soft, sugary, and served fresh from the oven, it's pretty hard to stop eating them. A typical meal for two can run $30-40, a great value for the portions and quality. Everything I've said above could apply to the entire chain, but this location at the South Bay Galleria is great unto itself. There's nothing I enjoy more than coming here after watching a movie at the AMC on the other side of the mall. It's nice and clean, frequently crowded but never too loud. The waitstaff are friendly and helpful, and do everything they can to keep you eating, like the stereotypical grandmother always commenting that her grandchildren are skin and bones. To sum up: the chain has great food in great quantities at great prices, and this particular one has a great location with great service. Yummm.

The side salad was not great, either (romaine, croutons, tomato, all flavorless) and the dressing sucked (bland, oily). I sampled some of the other food. No one really thought it was very good. My 7-year old nephew who is not picky did not like his spaghetti. It was too mushy (think 'Chef Boyardee' out of the can -- ever heard of al dente, guys?). It arrived w/fruit; my sister reminded the server we had asked for fries with it. Fries never came. The 'buzzard wings' were bland.

Interior decor reminds you of the ""other places"" such as TGIF, Applebee's, Chili's, etc... of the same class, but the food here is actually tasty!  I had the Bleu burger. The bun was tasty and reminded me of the finer hot dog buns I usually buy from the grocery stores. The patty was well cooked and had the texture and taste of a medium-well cooked patty, which was just what I ordered. The burger was surprisingly good, but I think the hype may have killed it for me, hence -1, however everything else was great....everything else meaning the fries. The seasoning and the fries...what a great combo! The service is great. I had a gentleman who was extremely attentive and warm and didn't hesitate to ask me if I needed anything else.

It's encouraged here, unlike other places that judge you or flat out refuse to allow substitutions or your own creations. The ""bottomless"" (God Bless America! and gluttony) steak fries are okay but can be inconsistent (one batch is fine and the next batch is overdone). Be sure to ask for the various dipping sauces.

People generally prefer one to the other). It's one of the few places that offers a choice. PS I like the fact that a bird is the spokescreature for a chain of burger joints. Kind of like how cows handle all the advertising for the Chick-Fil-A chain (""Eat more chik'n"").

Dave S.,"Torrance, CA",2,581,485,3.0,10/20/2010,"Carl's Jr has the Six Dollar Burger for $4.  This leads me to think Burgers have categories.  $4 burger is McDees.  $6 Burger is the local char broiler.  Then you skip $8 and go directly to $10 burger.  This is where burgers are called gourmet.  Umami, Fathers Office, Counter, Etal are $10 burgers.  Of course, on Yelp, you give a rating based on it's rank within the category.  So a 5 star $6 burger would 2 stars if it was sold as a $10 burger.  Red Robin is trying to get into that $10 burger echelon, but they fall short.  Their burger is respectable if it was sold at Steve's, but it wouldn't make it on the Umami menu.  Today, I had the bacon burger with cheese and egg. There is a fancy schmancy name for it, but I already forgot that name.  They do ask if you want it pink or not, so they do have two levels of cooking the meat which is good.  Of course I went with pink.  Life revolves around pink things.  Pigs are pink and.... well.. you get the idea.   So, the burger was good, but not $10 good.  I would rather spend $10 on a Umami burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=400

In terms of their plated entrees, you are best to steer clear.  Everything I've order (that didn't come on a bun) wasn't good.  They don't offer it anymore, but once I ordered fish & chips here, where instead of cod, it was fried salmon.  That didn't really work (though I'm not sure why I thought it would).  The service is okay at best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redondo-beach?start=400

That being said, I'll take the Pepsi challenge with Red Robin's honey mustard over any other chains any day. Easily, top 3.  Also, while I'm on the topic of things Red Robin is Awshm at, let me mention their strawberry-lemonades are arguably the best hybrid lemonade drinks on the planet. Yes, better than Sonic. Yes, better than your mother's. They're f'in sweet. ... shit, sorry, no pun intended. But trust me, they're great. A little pricey for lemonade, but it's worth it.

Well, my mind loved it, my stomach was roiling afterwards both times I had it (maybe from the grease of the fried egg). However, I still liked it and would gladly go back again. Can't remember any specific dish righ offhand, but there Teriyaki burger gets rave reviews from my other friends who go there as well. Their fries are limitless (so I've been told. I've never been able to eat past my first basket of fries that come with my meal) and already crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.
