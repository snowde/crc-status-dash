J R.,"Reno, NV",7,41,40,3.0,1/14/2018,"Red Robin has gone the way of the  corporates. Offer a fancier plating with less food, charge more, push drinks and appetizers, and follow the corporate seating chart and that formula will fix everything.  Not my favorite cookie cutter philosophy.  The seating is like police profiling. The bottomless fries are funny to me. They serve a third of what they used to. They will bring you another 1/3 of a serving if you happen to catch your server before they clear your table.  Somehow the perceived value of getting 2/3's of what they used to serve is a benefit?  Smaller burgers too. Because Red Robin made its name on tasty and innovative burgers that filled the plate and your belly at the same time, I think it is a shame. I am not saying the food is bad. This location has good servers, cooks, and managers. I am just not a fan of the ""Chili's"" style changes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno
Kelly W.,"Reno, NV",312,74,22,2.0,12/5/2017,"Went here the other night with my boyfriend because a gourmet burger sounded MOUTH WATERING. It's the first time I've been to this location and I hadn't been to Red Robin in awhile.  Regardless, the bottomless fries were calling my name. We were promptly seated in the bar and our waiter came to greet us. That's where things started to get a little weird. He greeted me by ""dude"", told us not to let him forget the silverware and to stab him if he did (which at first I thought was my kind of humor), and asked us for drinks. After I denied alcoholic beverages he asked me if I had had too much the night before. Ugh!!!  I looked over the menu and found a spicy, jalepeno topped burger with a corn bread Kaiser roll, sounded delicious. When I said that's what I was leaning towards the waiter he said he got plastered by jalepeno margaritas and downed a burger and it was delicious. Okay....... then he went to refill my water and never brought it back. My boyfriend noted he set it down on the bar, got confused and was kind of rude when he asked if we could have a new one.  My boyfriend ordered a double burger, he got a single patty. The waiter wasn't attentive so he just ate it, even though he tried to bring it up multiple times. The waiter was just sitting with another table talking. A manager came over to apologize and after all of this.... the worst part.  The waiter, who didn't seem to be all there and kind of suspicious, came over and said AND I QUOTE ""ya I know things were wrong with your burger but there's a survey on your bill, just go ahead and rate me all 10/10s"" I cannot tell you how uncomfortable I felt the whole night and that was just the cherry on top.  I do want to note that the food was delicious. One of the best burgers I've had. Just horrible experience overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno

Anthony L.,"Reno, NV",397,10,21,5.0,10/4/2017,"So I am a Buffalo Bills fan [Insert joke about being a Bills fan] and I was wearing my bright blue Bills shirt. My girlfriend and I go to sit at the bar and a women from across the bar, who is wearing a Patriot's shirt, says to me ""Did you lose a bet? Did someone force you to wear that shirt?"" I didn't know what to say so I kinda just laughed and shrugged it off. While this is happening, the bartender, who is turned around, hears what is going on and jumps in to save me. When he turns around, I suddenly realize he is decked out in Buffalo Bills gear and says to me ""don't worry about her, she is just mad that the Pats are behind us in the division.""   At this point, I really didn't care what the food tasted like because this made my whole experience. The food and beer was good though and we even ordered a dessert. We both ordered burgers and had our fair share of bottomless fries. The desert we ordered, was HUGE and we couldn't finish it all.

The first time I got it it was a 5-star burger for sure and it was probably the most delicious hamburger I've ever had lately the last couple times I've tried it the egg wasn't cooked as well and it turned into a total mess it wasn't delicious like I would have hoped.   The servers are okay, nothing special but a couple of them making extra effort to go above and beyond with the bottomless fries which are some of my favorite.  Whenever I go in during lunch time they never seem to be very busy.

Service was perfect, attentive, helpful, and timely.  Burgers were cooked just right, from the salmon burger to the specialty burgers. Fries, plank and sweet potato, were hot and plentiful with enough dipping ranch dressing for all concerned. Sangria was weak and I wouldn't recommend it, not enough fruit mixed in and over powered by the red wine. Parking was available and restaurant was clean.

I ordered a guacamole burger, but with a 1/2 lbs and a side of two sunny side eggs and unlimited sweet potato fries. (It's unlimited bottomless fries) my burger was a hit. If I wasn't with my younger cousins I would have ordered a blue moon  to wash it down cause it Goes perfectly.   Overall it was great.

(You know the ole what you can't see if what you can see doesn't look very good?) The plate passed the cooks inspection and then the waiters too.  Oh yea and the side of thousand island I got for my fries, looked like it had cottage cheese in it.  Big hunks of mayo that weren't blended in.

We both asked for medium rare and we both got well done.  They have a computer screen you can order food, pay your check and play games while you wait for your order.  When I went to pay, I noticed a 1.99 entertainment fee on my bill.  I inquired as to what the entertainment fee was about and the waitress stated it was for playing the trivia games on the screen.  I informed her that I must have not noticed the charge for playing the games when I went into the trivia app.  She said it does not inform you about the charge in advance, only upon paying the bill.  Now, most unsuspecting patrons would just pay the bill and it would go unnoticed......shame on Red Robin for not telling you in advance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno

The burger was another story. Hard as a hockey puck on the outside with one side clearly blackened.  I waited for awhile to get the server's attention regarding the burger. When I pointed how overcooked the burger was, she just shrugged and said, ""I'll let the kitchen know."" No offer to get another one made - silly me - I just assumed she was going to do it. Another few minutes pass but I'M HUNGRY, so I ate half of the burger in front of me, but no other burger ever made its way to my table.

For one of those rounds we had to flag down a server to get table items (drink sweeteners, silverware). When the food finally arrived, some of it was cold. Also, even though the correct dishes/orders were delivered to each of us, some of them were incomplete. For example, a Cobb Salad was delivered with no egg and no bacon, even though it was ordered with those items. We would have sent it back, but we were so hungry after the long wait, we didn't bother. When the server checked on us after our order was delivered, we asked for more fries (""bottomless fries"" you know). They never brought them. We had to flag him down and ask again. 5-10 minutes later they finally arrived. Overall, the entire dinner took at least 2.5 hours! This was dinner only; we weren't drinking or doing anything else at the restaurant. I can only imagine they were having major problems in the kitchen, but who knows. I never saw a manager anywhere around the restaurant. As a final note, the food itself tasted decent-to-good overall. I would rate the quality of the food 3-4 stars. Given the downturn in our experience, I don't think we'll be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno?start=40

I told him we haven't even seen our food server and had been trying to call for assistance with the table kiosk , but we ready to order. Manager was kind enough to take our order. Few min later drinks were brought to us by the busboy.  Shortly after, a waitress walked by and said ""your order is in"" and dropped off utensils. When our food arrived it was brought to us by our busboy who checked and asked if everything was ok. I asked for a refill of milk for my son. Waitress walked by and dropped off another drink for me but not my son.  After about 10 Mins. Waitress asked if we were done and I told her I was waiting for a glass of milk so my could eat.  When we finally finished eating she asked if I was ready to pay and pushed the table kiosk toward me. If she had stopped by earlier she would have know it wasn't working well because I had attempted to use it to call for service. Poor excuse for service.

Maritza H.,"Reno, NV",1,9,5,5.0,1/28/2017,I had gone in for a birthday burger and showed up with my brother. The burger and an appetizer we had ordered. My brother and I told the server we were intending to split it and when the burger was brought it it was already cut in half and we each had our separate plate and fries.

Nicole B.,"Reno, NV",56,227,676,3.0,4/12/2015,"I am always in the mood for a milkshake!  My wife and I stopped here for dinner together. I ordered the Buzz clucks and mac & cheese specifically so my wife could have leftovers to take to work the next day. I wasn't that hungry so I knew I wouldn't be able to finish a full meal. I was disappointed to find that the chicken tenders come smothered in a spicy sauce. I wish that had been specified on the menu. I don't mind spicy but the wife can't handle it which immediately meant whatever food I had left was going to waste. That really bugs me and if I had known that ahead of time i would have ordered something different.  On my quest to sample all of the mac and cheese options in Reno this is definitely at the very bottom of my list now. The cheese was all at the top of the bowl with bare noodles a plenty once you got past the first layer. I ate two bites of this just to give it a shot but it was not good. There was no flavor, no seasoning, and it was all around bland. Another disappointment. My chocolate milkshake was the only part of the meal that I actually enjoyed this evening.

All is pretty delicious and very filling.  The service, however, I feel is always very blah. The servers always seemed rushed and unenthused no matter how busy the restaurant is. The only exceptional service we've had was from lovely Britany. Other than that it's just mediocre.  I'm not a fan of this new computer system on each table. The staff encourages you to order and pay through the computer. I'm sorry, are you the server or am I? I feel like this has much to do with the downhill service.

R C.,"Reno, NV",265,72,8,1.0,12/11/2015,"Kietzke RR is right on my way home from work and I eat our a lot. Today, after working 10 hours, I decided to stop by for a burger and fires. First, let me say the food was very good.  The service was another story.  The person who brought out my order was other than my waitress. He asked me if I needed anything else and like a fool I said no before I realized there was no mustard on the table and he left. I searched nearby table for mustard and there was none. My waitress was on the other side of the room doing something with tableware. I hesitated and then got out of my seat and walked over and asked for mustard. She looked under the counter and there was none and then went on a mission to get a bottle while I returned to my seat. it must have been some mission because it took her close to 5 minutes to bring me back mustard. In the meantime, I could not eat my burger without mustard so I started on the ""bottomless fries"". Let me state that I was dismayed that not many fries were on my plate but I figured since Red Robin has bottomless fries it would not be long before I received a fresh dose of hot fries. This was wishful thinking since the fries on my plate were not even close to hot, but luke worm.  So here is how it goes, yes my server when she brought out the mustard did refill my coke and that was the last I saw of her except in her corner doing table settings or something. Eventually there was another girl with her and they went to the back. I finished my burger, wanted more fries but minutes went by without seeing my server. The bartender had a couple old men who were being difficult and the other person who brought out my order, never saw him again. I did not get more ""bottomless fries"" and I paid the bill on the terminal on my computer. I did not get more fries and the waitress got no tip. No one even noticed I left. It is not that the waitress ignored me it was that she did not even care.  It will be a long time before I go back to Red Robin. Next time I see one of their commercials offering bottomless fries I will just shake my head and laugh. If you work ten hours and just want to enjoy a meal and relax when you are STARVING Red Robin Kietzke  is not the place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno?start=40
Rachel S.,"Reno, NV",79,124,68,2.0,5/30/2016,"I try to like Red Robin. And sometimes I do but... Overall? It's just a miss for me. Tonight's dinner: me and my two kids. They each had a cheeseburger. They were decent, nothing special. I don't like their steak fries but the kids do, so cool. I had the Whiskey River chicken salad. That was a big letdown. The portion was not very big, of either salad or chicken. The chicken was dry. The BBQ sauce was decent, it saved the chicken. The menu said it came with garlic toast- it actually came with two small, thin, bland, super crisp (I would say brittle) crostini. I only ate about half of it before I got bored. I also got sweet potato fries which were good but cold, and dipped them in the spicy ketchup which was the highlight of the meal. The highlight of the meal was ketchup. So, yeah. Not great. I've had things there I liked much better. The DGB burger, for instance. That's decent. And I remember liking their fish and chips a billion years ago, but that's been a while. They have some alcoholic shakes and stuff that look good but I was not in the mood tonight.  Now... The service is a little bit of a problem. It wasn't overly quick for us but not terrible either. But I did notice that the table beside us, who actually got there before us, got basically ignored. They got their drinks and the server never came back to their table. She walked by a lot of times. They tried to signal her but she never noticed. Finally when she delivered our food to our table and still didn't go back to them, they stood up and walked out. And it took about 15 minutes for her to notice they'd gone. It was really weird.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno?start=40

Herb G.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,11,,2.0,9/9/2017,"We stopped in the restaurant because of one of their BOGO offers. It was busy, noisy and there was a wait for a seat except for the bar top which we chose. The food and service from the bartender was good considering the crowd, but it appears to me that Red Robin does not want the servers to waste time serving customers. After we took our seats, when the bartender had time to get to us, the first thing she did was put a Ziosk terminal in front of us, as if we were supposed to use it instead of ordering from the bartender. I let her know that when we go out to eat, we want a good meal, and good service, not another touchscreen to deal with. I explained that we did try the Ziosk terminals when Red Robin first installed them but they were always had problems, particularly not taking our Royalty card and crashing, and are more aggravation than they are worth. They still are. When we tried to check out using the terminal per the Bartender's request, bit it wouldn't accept our Royalty card and crashed. We asked the bartender to check us out manually, which led to the manager, who appeared highly annoyed, coming by. There was no apology for the terminal crashing or the inconvenience and when I expressed my displeasure with the continued problems with the Ziosk terminals he informed us that everybody uses them. I let him know that based of the continued bad experience with the terminals, we don't like them, would prefer not to use them and that we would appreciate it if they wouldn't make the servers drop them in front of us when we dined. I also reiterated that they have frequently crashed when we have tried to use them and we prefer to have a live server taking care of us. He informed us that the terminals were there to stay and they are expecting customers to use them. I informed him that if they expect us to use them, particularly with their crashing problems, we can always find another restaurant. He informed us that it was corporate policy. Overall, it is readily apparent to me that the Manager doesn't give a ##@# if we enjoy our visit or not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno?start=40

DeeMarie K.,"Indianapolis, IN",2,17,14,1.0,9/30/2015,"After 9 days of travel, I saw on my GPS there was a Red Robin in Reno, and I was delighted. Back home in Indianapolis, I eat at RR a few times a month.  I always know I'm able to go in, get seated quickly, be attended upon by friendly wait staff, get delicious, fresh, comfort food, and be on my way.  Upon arrival at the Reno location, I could tell this restaurant was managed completely differently.  It wasn't a busy time (only a few other patrons in the entire restaurant), yet none of the staff greeted us. Finally we got a table, and both of us had to brush lettuce and crumbs off our table and seat. Gross. Our waitress asked us if we were familiar with ""the Robin"". We said yes, so she just walked away. She didn't tell us about any new specials or burgers, just walked away. After a few minutes she came back to get our order. She wasn't friendly, but wasn't outwardly unpleasant. I'm so used to very cheerful, bubbly staff at RR, so it was off putting.  A few minutes later, another member of the wait staff came over and asked what we'd ordered. We couldn't remember the exact name of the new burger we'd tried, so we had to see a menu. This gentleman explained that our waitress didn't know what we'd ordered. He then walked away. What....?  Then, the wait on the food. Waiting, waiting, waiting. As I said, the restaurant wasn't even busy. We'd began to wonder if our waitress forgot that we'd ordered an appetizer. Then the appetizer came out with our entrees. There wasn't really room on the table for all 3 dishes, so we had to move stuff around.  Everything was cold. The cheese for the pretzel bites was cold and congealed. The burgers had no flavor and the sauce that I'm used to running out the sides, was so little that I couldn't even taste it.   The waitress didn't ask if we wanted more of the ""bottomless"" fries. We did. Didn't ask if we wanted refills on our drinks. We did.  She did, however, make sure we knew how to pay our check and stayed around for that. Big thanks. $35 for a dirty table, cold food, and no refills.   I'll be moving to Reno in a few months, but I'll never eat at this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno?start=40

The wait time was just unnecessary and the food was not that great either. Would not recommend this place simply because the service is horrible.

Jennifer S.,"Sparks, NV",70,198,15,2.0,8/4/2015,"I used to really look forward to going to Red Robin - as common person as that sounds.   The food used to have great taste and the service used to be awesome.  Wait staff was already very friendly and it was usually a great place to kick back and enjoy good food, decent prices and a nice atmosphere. Things have just gotten worse and worse as the years have gone by.  We are less and less impressed and as of late, a trip to Red Robin equates to lunch at Denny's.  Sure - it'll fill your stomach (sort of) but it won't taste great, you won't be happy during the meal and you'll leave thinking you could have filled an empty gas tank for the price of the two meals you and your spouse just consumed.   Two visits ago my husband and I were being walked to our table by the host.  He tried to seat us at a table.  Having a strong preference for booths and seeing just as many open booths as tables I asked if we could have a booth instead.  You would have thought that I'd asked him to part the Red Sea with the exasperated look on his face as he walked us to a booth and then proceeded to toss the menus on the table and turn around on his heel.  I complained to Management and was not even given the courtesy of acknowledgement that day. This past visit presented a different annoyance.  Horribly sub-bar food.  My husband's burger fell apart on his first bite and my BLTA had no filling.  BLTA = Bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado.  The sandwich I got included 1 piece of bacon broken up into 3 small pieces. 2 pieces of lettuce, 1 slice of tomato and no avocado.  The Clam Chowder resembled something that a surgeon would suck out during a liposuction procedure.  Did I bother sending it back or complaining?  No - why talk to deaf ears? The magic that was Red Robin is gone.  No longer are the days of happy wait staff, smiling manager who come to the table, great food with very competitive prices and an ambiance that could cheer up even the gloomiest of folks, even if for just 60 minutes.

Been to this location before and have never been disappointed. However, things have certainly changed. Here's a quick breakdown:  What I ordered: Red's Tavern Double burger with their famous steak fries  Customer service: no complaints, quickly got in and out with my order  Burger: First off there was no thousand island dressing, which comes standard on this burger. Big disappointment since I didn't get any other condiments with my order. Tasted like a bland, basic burger, nothing special about it. Ended up not finishing it.  Fries: This is the most disappointing part to me because I love Red Robin's seasoned steak fries. Cold and no seasoning. Ok I can't say no seasoning because to be fair there was a pinch of salt on a couple fries. So disappointed. Ate 5 then threw the rest away.  Overall worst Red Robin experience.

Evan G.,"Reno, NV",67,70,40,5.0,7/27/2016,"I came here today and was surprised to see it newly renovated. The host promptly attended my friends and I when we arrived. All the employees looked like they were having fun, which uplifted my spirit. As I was looking through the plethora of food and beverage options, I couldn't decide what I wanted. I asked the server what she liked, and I ended up ordering the tavern Q burger. Bonus points for bottomless steak fries! Now I've been to many burger joints and I must say that I was pleasantly satisfied with what I got. The burger wasn't that big, but the seasoning was spot on along with the melted cheese. As for drinks, I got a red sangria that was delicious - not watered down or filled with pure alcohol. Overall a great mixture. I'm obligated to mention that the desserts are some of the best. They have chocolate sticks and doughnut rings that are a perfect ending to a burger meal! My friends and I were happy with our food and the service was fantastic. I recommend anyone looking for good burgers to try out Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno?start=60
E D.,"Reno, NV",0,24,1,1.0,3/13/2016,"Why do I keep subjecting myself to this place? Oh yeah, the kid likes it, but even he is over it. They always screw up something and their service has always sucked. I mean it. Every time we go here, something is screwed up. Once.  One, single time, we've had stellar service even if the order was screwed up. You would think that as a burger place, they would, at least, get their burgers right, but sadly, that's not the case. Let's see.  We've had grilled cheese made with the cheese still partially in the plastic.  Thank goodness I noticed because that's when my boy was little.  I've ordered a different cheese on a burger and they haven't done it.  Too much mayo.  Never filling drinks or fries..  Cold, flavorless soup. No refills, dirty silverware, sticky tables with visible grunge on it, rare when burgers are ordered well done. Burned buns, raw buns, buns that were so stale and hard a duck wouldn't eat it, mayo saturated buns.  Burgers with onions when ordered without, can you tell the difference between swiss and cheddar? Raw on inside and burned out or just rare. I won't bore you with all the mess ups.  We don't even go there that often. This time, it took 15 minutes before the server even acknowledged us.  Another 15 to even get our beverages and an order taken.  The napkins provided were dirty and one of the forks was severely bent. We didn't see the server so couldn't ask for replacements. 30 more minutes before food arrived.  I ordered soup as an appetizer and it arrived at the same time as the burger.  I sent it back. Appetizers are before meals.  Asked for more napkins, clean ones, no apology was made.  We never got another fork. The fries were tepid, I can't image what the temperature the soup was. The burger had the wrong bun.  I had to use the stupid table top computer to even get the server back to our table. No one offered to fill our drinks that had been empty since before food arrived.  I ask for the right bun. No apologies again.  It took the server 10 minutes to come tell me that my replacement burger had been ordered.  We've been there almost an hour now. 15 more minutes before the burger arrives.  It's on the right bun, not even toasted, so much mayo that the whole thing is so slick with it, it oozes out and nothing stays in the bun.  The burger is in pieces in the bun, not well done and not with the cheese I ordered.  I'm hungry though so, I move on. Manager brings re-order. She just goes to put it on the table, nothing is said about wrong order, drinks aren't offered to be refilled (I've been sucking ice cubes for a while now).  I told her the order was wrong, the issue with soup, the napkins, the fork, the drinks.  Oh, she finally asks if she can refill the drinks.  Of course, there are still no apologies.  I get the, was the burger our fault too? Yeah lady, it was.  She forgets that we have water and sprite in less than a minute. Never apologizes, just says she's taking burger off the order.  I explain that I only want soup off, it's not my intention to get a free meal, but we've had several because of their screw ups. The manager takes the burger off anyway.  I never see her again despite asking for more sauce.  I've since given up on that too. I take the now soggy, mayo sodden top bun off, scrape as much mayo off the bottom bun as possible and eat what I can.  The lettuce and tomato are drowned at this point, they can't be saved. The pineapple is burned, not grilled.  It's horrible.  Essentially, I eat chunks of medium done burger off a greasy half of bun with a bent fork, sucking ice cubes (I was only half filled) using the limited napkins we were allowed, with no sauce and tepid fries. Sigh.  Server never brings a bill.  I am finally so fed up and we've been there over 2 hours, I just want to go home.  I use the damned table top computer that is meant to replace the need for a server.   I get the idea.  More service, less people, keeps overhead down.  The problem with these table top computers is that if I wanted to go pay triple (or more) than it costs to cook at home, I don't want to serve myself.  I can order pizza to be delivered from my home computer. Anyway, I fold and pay with the stupid thing.  Other than walking out, there's no other choice.  The tip.  Really nothing.  Why? I get that they live on tips, I've done it.  I usually tip when it's the kitchen's fault, but for wrong orders, poor service and having to serve myself, I think not. Hell, if they've even tossed me a single apology for their screw ups, I probably would have tipped, but nope.  Really, save yourself the trouble and go elsewhere.  Bottomless fries aren't worth it anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno?start=60

Magdalena C.,"Reno, NV",93,105,,2.0,10/1/2015,"Red Robin, you're such a mess... Disclaimer: My 3.5yo son LOVES the place so we frequent it. Normally it is between 3 and 4 stars, but today it was a joke. Someone thought it was a good idea to add the ordering machines to each table. They are a little tablets on a stand with a built-in  credit card reader and a printer. First of all the stupid thing has games on it. So my 3.5 yo tries to play with it. I do not like my family playing with electronic devices during meals. So RR actually encourages the use of devices at the dinner table. Meals are to socialize and have family time. I try to take it away and I am the bad guy. Thanks RR. Also RR is charging for the games so if your kid wins the race to the tablet, you're SOL.  Secondly, the waiters are more confused by these things than the guests.  Lastly, the devices are all mixed up. I am pretty sure we paid for someone else's dinner, but it was close amount, so I didn't want to prolong this painful experience and left.  One more thing; my baby was sitting in a chair that was literally falling apart. I asked for a different one, the waitress acknowledged it and moved on her merry way. The chair was never replaced.  My burger ""Burning love"" was ok. Spicy but oddly lacking in flavor. My husband's burger the seasonal smoky burger on ciabatta was excellent. That's why the second star.

Jesse B.,"San Antonio, TX",25,223,61,3.0,1/18/2014,"God only knows why I keep ending up in these franchised restaurants lately. I mean, they're not that amazing and they're the same 'ole, same 'ole everywhere you go. But I keep getting dragged to these restaurants because it's the most comforting place to go for my friends and family rather than take a step out on a ledge and see where the experience goes. So, foreword that's not really necessary but completed, I ended up at Red Robin. SIGH. So typical.  I've had one of their burgers before and it was good but I'm not much of a burger kind of girl. So yeah, I gobbled it down without really whimpering, and the bottomless fries were a nice touch, but was I amazed and potbellied-pleased? NO. I was bored. My visit this time around was the same thing. No really interesting dishes to try and nothing really stand alone amazing. So I had the Chicken-Tortilla soup. Wahoo. Just not taste-bud explosion amazing. (I admit this is a lot to ask of a Red Robin, but still.) The fries were hot and soft, but definitely not my favorite fries (I mean, we all have our favorite place for fries, right?). So, okay food, but not a place I enjoy going back to more than once. And as far as the service goes, OH NO. Our waitress was so dismissive and it was kind of hurtful (if I really got hurt that easily). She literally gave us our check the moment I finished my soup and without asking if we needed or wanted anything else. So clearly I did not, in fact, want dessert. Thank you, chick!

Mark A.,"Reno, NV",0,11,,5.0,8/6/2014,"Always my go-to stop for a great Burger and a gorge-fest of Steak Fries, it cannot be beat.  For those into healthier options, you can get some veg instead of fries or Sweet Potato fries now too.  Huge selection of burgers.  Take a few minutes to read the menu and if none stand out, do the 'make your own'.   Personal favorites are the Whiskey River BBQ burger and Royal Red Robin.  They got the burger cooked properly this time but even when overcooked, they are still juicy and tasty. Went for the special they had yesterday, $5 off when you spend $10 or more in celebration of their 500th Restaurant for Royalty Rewards members.  Corporate needs to prep their restaurants better:  At least 3 of the lower-level staff said they had no advance warning on this promo and they were hammered.  I had an early dinner around 4pm and they were still in clean-up mode from lunch.  Let your franchises know about such promos so they can schedule appropriately!  I can only imagine how frustrated some customers may have been during that rush and any review written about a visit yesterday needs to take that into consideration.  There have been previous e-mail promos that did not get to the staff at the restaurant, so there's clearly a breakdown in communication somewhere. Staff have always been friendly and attentive.  Managers often stop by to see how the food and service is.  I try to go once a month but it has been a few months since my last visit.  I forgot his name but a bartender/server still recognized me and asked how I was doing even though he was busy and just passing by the table I was at. The Red Robin spice blend is sometimes overused on fries so if you are one that prefers mild seasoning, be sure to request no seasoning on your fries.  There's always a container at the table so you can season them yourself. If you enjoy burgers and even go once in a blue moon, be sure to sign up for their Royalty Reward program.  Unlike most other places that only offer free food on your birthday, you have an entire month to redeem your free birthday burger! (not to mention the previously mentioned promotion yesterday that was awesome) This is a Burger Diner . . . it's going to be noisy!  This is NOT a place for an intimate, elegant dinner.  There's an arcade just inside the entrance for cryin' out loud! The decor is nostalgic and modern with classic pop culture posters and historical ones.  TVs are viewable from nearly every seat in the restaurant, depends on how good your eye-sight is from some of the fringe seats.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno?start=80

The water served was nasty tasting, worse than tap water. Unclean bar guns? Gross. After the meal we both had sick stomachs and bad stomach air pressure lol. Then the GF person got so lightheaded and dizzy we had to go home and get the emergency gluten enzyme pills for when gluten is in a supposedly GF meal.

Luis M.,"Reno, NV",42,4,1,4.0,6/24/2014,"It has been a while since I've visited the Red Robin Gourmet Burgers here in Reno, Nevada, and when I entered, I realized that not much had changed. I've always had pleasant experiences at this Red Robin establishment as there has always been someone to greet me and my party at the door and the hosts have always been quick to seat us. Today, I was meeting up with some co-workers for a celebratory lunch. The first thing I noticed after sitting down and ordering my drink was that the menu IS new. The menus have been redone in a harder laminate packaging that protects the menu much more efficiently than the older packaging. I asked for a raspberry lemonade that the waiter said wasn't on the menu but that he'd gladly get for me. I'm not sure how true that was as it was completed quite fast, but eh, I enjoyed it. So my co-workers and I spoke for a little while as we waited for our order. I chose the crispy chicken sandwich today as anything chicken is pretty effin' fantastic to me. I was debating between that, a teriyaki chicken sandwich, and a BBQ chicken sandwich, but decided I'd play it safe. I asked for the crispy chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato only, as I am very picky about my condiments. The waiter returned many times to fill our drinks. Once the order arrived, I was a little disappointed that the fries were packaged in a much smaller container than their previous, carefree splatter across the basket with the sandwich. But of course, the food was delicious. The chicken sandwich was tender and juicy as chicken sandwiches are meant to be, but not always prepared at other restaurants. The lettuce tasted fresh and the bread was of course FABULOUS. The tomato was oddly missing, but I figured I could live without it. In the meantime, I'd also asked for a side of marinara sauce for my fries (sometimes people look at me funny for asking for that, but this waiter simply paused a second before obliging). The fries were as great as I remembered and oddly enough I didn't need to take advantage of the bottomless fries as I had in the past! The waiter promptly delivered the bill and gave us another refill (yes!) before we left for the afternoon. Red Robin Gourmet Burgers continues to be the pleasant, family-friendly restaurant that I'd remembered. Speaking of, they were starting to get REALLY busy with plenty of families entering the establishment for lunch.

Stephanie P.,"Sparks, NV",227,212,649,3.0,1/31/2015,"This particular Red Robin does not seem to take Gluten Intolerance very seriously. I have been there twice and both times I have had to really stress the importance, because they do not take all of the precautions/steps that many other Red Robins do. They honestly were like, ""Ya, ya..."" The second time I was there my friend said something like about having an epi pen with her and all of a sudden the waiter visibly started taking it more seriously as I ordered. They still did not do all of the steps when my food came out (like different colored basket and manager bringing it out like others do) and a different waiter said, ""Oh ya, that is a gluten free bun...."" and something like if I asked for the GF dedicated fries then that's what those are. ~ I didn't get sick, fortunately that time, but I did after the first time. The ONLY reason why I went there the second time was because of a big get-together. ~ I HIGHLY recommend the Red Robin in Spanish Springs, though. They are totally on top of gluten issues and take all of the steps. If there is ANY question, they remake whatever it is. I have never questioned it there, but several times (I go there all the time) a manager has brought me part of my food and apologized for the delay on the other part (usually the fries), because they could not personally guarantee there was no cross-contamination (etc) of my particular item so they are having them remade. HUGE difference in service and reliability.  ~  I gave it 3 stars, because the food tastes really good like any other Red Robin.

Lisa C.,"Fernley, NV",0,15,,1.0,8/30/2015,"I was a huge fan of the Reno Red Robin, until the menu change this summer. They took the Southwest Salad off the menu, and changed the presentation of all the salads. The portions are much smaller than they were before the changes. The nice romaine lettuce that was piled into a nice entree sized bowl, was replaced with mostly what I call ""grass lettuce"" on a barely 12x4 plate. A little of that lettuce goes along way. The salad barely covers the plate, and the salad falls off the edges as you are trying to move it around with the fork to eat. It does not fill you up, and for that you pay $10.49! The first time the manager tried to have the kitchen duplicate the old Southwest Salad, as best they could. It was still disappointing. While it was a corporate decision, the manager was very understanding and did what he could to make me happy. There is no value any longer for the $ spent. Until these changes, I ate lunch weekly while in town doing my shopping. I hadn't been in over a month, when my granddaughter and her friend (both 10) wanted to go to Red a Robin yesterday. They have also ruined the kids menu also. The grilled cheese was some small pieces of bread with more crust than soft bread and cheese. The side salad no longer has croutons. A 10 old is not going to eat that lettuce. I had fries to share with her. I got a burger, since I am not happy with the salads. No knife was offered, so I had to wait for another server to bring one. The bun just crumbled apart. The meat and bacon are so thin, you can see through it. The fries yesterday were cold and over seasoned. The 2nd basket is usually very hot and best part of the meal. Not yesterday. The other 10 yr old, had Mac & Cheese. The bowl was only half full, after the waiter made a point of the Mac n Cheese is no longer bottomless. Usually the service is really good, but it was off. Maybe because it was a Sat, and busier than during the week. The birthday sundae for one of the girls was forgotten. We were just ready to leave at that point. I am looking for a restaurant with a decent entree salad! No more Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno?start=120

My son thoroughly enjoyed is Whiskey River BBQ burger (with strawberry lemonade and a vanilla shake for desert), while I thought that my Blue Ribbon Burger was better than average at best.  Gayle thought that her salad was a little bland and unsubstantial.

Laura T.,"Tucson, AZ",7,7,1,1.0,8/21/2013,"Absolutely horrible service. We dined at Red Robin last week and it is up there with the worst service ever. Our waiter had 2 other tables...not busy at all. He took our drink order and it took at least 15 minutes to even get water as well as what we ordered. We ended up going to the servers station ourselves to get water. After the food came out our server knew we were clearly unhappy and avoided us like the plague. He would shout from 10 feet away as he was walking ""everything good?""'. He never refilled our drinks so again we headed to the soda machine ourselves. The food was awful. I told him I was gluten free so I took my salad with no croutons and there was bread sitting on it when it came out. But he never came up to the table to ask so i just picked around it.

Stephanie P.,"Seattle, WA",454,781,1977,3.0,8/29/2006,"My mild-mannered dad usually doesn't care where we go or what we do when we hang out.  So when I asked him last weekend where he wanted to go for lunch, I was surprised to get an enthusiastic, ""Let's go to Red Robin, it's fun there!""  Personally, I hesitate to call any family restaurant ""fun,"" but if it makes my dad happy, Red Robin it is. Red Robin features cheery, primarily red decor, and it has the advantage over other family restaurants in that it resists the urge to hang random shit all over the walls.  No canoes, no street signs, no posters of dead actors from the 1950s.  Yes, the gaily patterned fabric lampshade covers are a bit much, but try not to look at them. The menu is quite small, and focuses pretty exclusively on burgers (which includes turkey/chicken and veggie ""burgers"").  If you want anything else, you're kind of out of luck - they only have a few wraps and a handful of salads.  There are some American-style entrees, but fewer than a dozen, and they're all over $10, which is more than I really want to pay for lunch at a family restaurant.  The menu is literally one laminated sheet, and while you don't expect a ton of choices at a place like Red Robin, it just feels really limiting to not even have a page to turn. The servers are usually perky (this is the ""fun"" part my dad was alluding to), and pretty on the ball as far as checking in, soda refills, etc.  If you come late in the evening, they're often kind of bored and ready to chat with you to pass the time, but during the lunch rush, they're friendly but busy. Red Robin is an easy, no-brainer choice when you want a quick, simple burger or sandwich for lunch.  But it's also overpriced and has a very limited menu, and I often find myself settling for something I don't really want, because they don't have what I do want.  Oh, and one final note: they make a big deal on their menu about their ""bottomless steak fries,"" but in all the times I've been there, no server has ever offered or asked if I wanted more.  Not that I need any more fat and calories in my life, but if you're going to lure people in with a promise of infinite refills, you should at least make a pretense of fulfilling that claim.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno?start=140
Shelby B.,"Sparks, NV",62,161,14,4.0,8/2/2012,"I was worried about this Red Robin for awhile, the couple of times I've gone in during the last year, it's been a ghost town!  Today, however, the parking lot was completely full and it was very busy inside.  The service was GREAT today, all the waiters seemed to work together to make sure our drinks were never empty, and our server was friendly, but not overly so.  The food is consistent, and in that I mean, it's just fine.  Just like any Starbucks or good chain anywhere, you know what you are going to get, and you know you're going to enjoy it.  For the sake of the great people who gave great service today, (and..okay, fine.. for the sake of my steak fry craving), I hope this Red Robin is always as busy as it was today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno?start=140

Eileen H.,"Concord, CA",344,329,94,2.0,6/23/2009,"So I generally really like Red Robin, and I even gave the one in San Bruno five stars.  We stopped at the Red Robin in Reno on Father's day on the way home from visiting my in-laws in Carson City, and it just wasn't up to par as far as Red Robin goes.   First of all, the feng shui of the place was just 'off'.  I didn't like how the place was set up, and I didn't feel comfortable.  The space just didn't flow.   The food was alright.  I didn't order a burger, I got a crispy chicken sandwich, which was pretty good.  My fries came with a healthy amount (read:  coated with) of seasoned salt.  Isn't that why they put a shaker of it on the table, so you can do it yourself?  I'm not a big fan of steak fries to begin with, so I only at a couple of them anyway.  My hubby had the whiskey river chicken wrap which is what he almost always orders there.   I ordered chicken fingers with mandarin oranges for my daughter, and guess what came out?  Chicken fingers with the same fries covered in seasoned salt.  But our server quickly brought out the oranges when I pointed out the mistake. The best thing about our meal was the dreamy orange smoothie (my standard drink order @ Red Robin).  It actually seemed bigger than usual and I didn't even finish it. After our meal I needed to use the facilities before we hit the road again.  The bathroom was marginally clean and it smelled (there was no kind of air freshener in there).  The worst was the fact that the toilets had so little flushing power that it couldn't even flush down the toilet seat covers!  I had to go so bad that I was just like, ""eff it, i gotta go, so I'm goin"", and I peed on top of two toilet seat covers.  EWWWWWW!!!!  (sorry TMI).  Anyway, Reno has every single chain restaurant that you'd ever want to eat at, so I'd say skip this Red Robin and go elsewhere!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno?start=160

We had a great server, we got our food REALLY QUICKLY - in fact we didnt have time to even really get started on the appetizer when the order came out. BTW - the appetizers were great. We got fried cheese sticks, and chips/salsa/guacamole - both were great.  I went for the Bacon Cheese Burger - the menu promised ""thick slices of bacon"" - but they actually came out as little thin skinny slices - but still the burger was good - nothing gourmet about it - honestly Burger King or Carl's Jr has better tasting burger.  My friend had - Prime Rib Dip and garlic Parmesan - the fries were awesome (I stole a few)  I think its cool you get endless fries - but we didn't have room for more!  I kind of like this place, it was bright and clean and colorful, people seemed happy.  They have a full bar, if drinking is your thing, and a ""to-die-for"" looking dessert menu - no room for that either.  $45.00 for 2 people  I'm gonna give it another try soon - even if its just for a piece of that Mud Pie!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno?start=160

The hamburger was mediocre- the bun was dry which puzzled me, the place is obviously busy so I couldn't figure out if the bun was stale, or if  they just leave it out uncovered for so long that it dries out- either way that's unacceptable for a pricey burger. The fries which my husband promised I would love disappointed.  I think they are frozen freezing changes the texture of the fry and these had that peculiar graininess that you find in a frozen fry.  Red Robin is an attractive, noisy, kid's oriented restaurant that sells very mediocre and overpriced food- I won't be back!  I just heard that the new Legends Shopping center in sparks has a Fuddrucker's, if it's as good as the other Fuddrucker's I have been to, I bet Red Robin will lose some business to them",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno?start=160

That said, the one reason I really, really want to hate Red Robin is their overcooked meat policy.  At RR you get two choices of how you want your burger done: ""No Pink"" or ""Some Pink.""  WTF?!  If you ask your server about this, your server will inform you that they are required by law to cook meat to a certain temperature--blah, blah, blah.  If you order a burger at Claim Jumper they will cook your burger however you want, even raw if you so desire.  That is because Claim Jumper uses quality meat.  The meat at RR?  Well, let's just say you're not allowed to see much pink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reno?start=160
