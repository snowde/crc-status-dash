CrazyAsianDude R.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/14/2018,"Amazing food and honestly great service....WOULD RECOMMEND!!! The only downside is I would say the place is always busy but it's very understandable, they are an overall great place so make sure to make a reservation at least 10-15 mins before eating there just to skip the wait. The waitress we had very consistent with her visits to us about refills and any help we needed with payment or games on the little electronics on top of the tables. The food in general was amazing with the proportions being slightly bigger than expected meaning you get leftovers to take him with you!!!! Despite being a stupid teen along with my friend, not knowing how to pay, the staff was kind enough to help us the whole way through making our night...all-in-all this place is just great even with the amount of time you would expect it to take for your food to be prepared, if it weren't for a recommendation to try the place, I honestly would not have been introduced to the world of gourmet foods and what other better place than to go here if you haven't already!!! 10/10 rating!!!!                                                                      -Mikey",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside
Lili B.,"Riverside, CA",148,23,9,5.0,12/27/2017,"Disclaimer: I am recounting second hand good customer service as my boyfriend came home and immediately asked I write a good review for Red Robin because, ""You're better at that kinda thing than I am."" He wanted to pick up some burgers to go since we had a gift card. Ordering a to go order online gave us 20% off. Score. Utilizing the Red Robin royalty points got him an extra couple bucks off. Dope. Then once all discounts and gift cards were applied, he owed 47 cents. To which the employee helping him told him to not worry about it. Rad. Twas a merry night of savings, burgers, and kindness indeed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside
Johnalyn L.,"Napa, CA",194,41,180,5.0,12/26/2017,"BAR AREA REVIEW: Went shopping all by my lonesome in the Tyler Mall & got hungry. I needed to pass time until traffic passed anyway so I went to the ever reliable Red Robin's! Parking can be hard to find since this Red Robin is located in the mall area & it's always busy & crowded.  Sat at the bar area since it was only me & not a huge party. I saw others in as large a party of 4 get serviced quickly at the bar as well. I quickly got my order taken & got my food fast while watching a game on tv. Food is as usual great,; burger cooked to medium exactly how I like, & the server was quick to refill my drinks & fries as needed. I ate soooo much I waddled out of there with my food coma baby!! Wrapping up the meal was easy with an electronic kiosk device to pay on instead of waiting around to catch the waiter's attention for the check. You can basically pay (electronic kiosk turns green on top once you've paid) & get up & go! I can always count on Red Robin's for a decent burger when I've got a craving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside
Peggy A.,"Perris, CA",5,22,12,4.0,1/9/2018,I came here because I didn't want to get poke bowl because last time it gave me the squirts. I was seated quickly by a sharp looking African American man (which was to my liking). I decided to get the $6.99 tavern burger because I'm a bit frugal. But the good thing was that it came with bottomless fries so I stayed there for about 2 and a half hours to take advantage of that AMAZING deal. The burger was ok. Just tasted like something I could've got at Burger King. I was so satisfied with my experience that I made my tip look like a smiley face(I tipped in coins) I attached a pic so you guys could see.

Lauren D.,"Irvine, CA",169,232,241,4.0,11/26/2017,"Believe it or not, last night was my very first time dining at Red Robin. My husband and I split the Banzai burger and the Southern Charm burger and went for the steak and sweet potato fries. Both burgers were really good! I think the Southern Charm wins by a little bit but I'd recommend both of them. The service was great too.

Sarina L.,"Riverside, CA",469,177,234,3.0,12/10/2016,"Red Robin is a great place for gourmet burgers. Their menu never ceases to amaze me as there is always new burgers to try out. When I order a burger, I either like to have an egg in it, some avocado, or some barbecue sauce with some bacon in it. I've had:  -Royal Red Robin ( it has an egg in it and bacon... bomb..) - Whiskey River BBQ (Fried onions and bbq sauce) The latest time that I went I got the buzzed mac and cheese tavern. Burgers and mac and cheese? Sounds like a great combo. It was only 6.99 with bottomless fries. I thought it was okay. It is smaller than their gourmet burgers. The mac and cheese had an interesting taste, it was a little sour to me. But overall, it tasted pretty good. But I'm not sure if I'd order it again. I got bottomless sweet potato fries ( additional $1.29 but totally worth it)  I give this location 3 stars because of service. They have these new table kiosks to pay and potentially order as well. I feel like because of this, the waitress was a little less attendant to our table. It took a long time to get additional baskets of fries. This has happened before so this time once we got our burgers, we asked for another order of fries. And based on their slow time, it came out halfway as we finished our burgers and the rest of the fries. Additional baskets took a little longer. It was also hard to flag down the waitress.  The little machines gave us a little headache. It started malfunctioning after the second card swiped. It took a good 15 minutes for the waitress to help us and print us our receipts. I'd say a good third of our visit was just waiting, either for food to come or for assistance. Food is great nonetheless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside
Juliana P.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",624,292,667,4.0,5/9/2017,"Came in for a quick dinner date on a Friday night and was seated by such a lovely hostess, Brooke! A+ customer service (and satisfaction!!!).  I ordered ""The Wedgie"" Burger which is essentially a protein-style hamburger (patties in between lettuce + guacamole, tomato, onions, and bacon) and it came with a side garden salad that I got with balsamic vinaigrette. Definitely a healthier option, but not any less tasty!  I've been to this location before (almost a 1.5 years ago) but my most recent experience was definitely much better overall. Our dining experience was up to par with my high standards!

Ashley L.,"Corona, CA",0,27,7,2.0,9/5/2017,"I used to come in here all the time since it's my boyfriends favorite burger place. Service is usually slow, I'm assuming because they don't want to refill the fries too much. But we still come often. We came here the other night and when the guy brought me my soda there was something funky in it. I brought it to his attention and just said ew gross! he then brought me a new one, which I couldn't drink cuz I was feeling pretty disgusted. I was even more shocked when we got the bill and saw he still charged us for the drink. The least he could have done was taken it off the bill. It really makes me wonder how well they actually clean.

Gladys M.,"Banning, CA",23,27,63,1.0,9/11/2017,"We stopped by after going to Castle Park so we were very hungry. They told us it would be a 30 minute wait & it turned into an hr & 15 minute wait. The only reason why we stayed was because the kids wanted to & it was one of their birthdays. The hostess' were disgustingly rude, I could hear them talking about our party, one rolled her eyes. While we waited a random family arrived & they asked the hostess question, as soon as the family walked away the girl started cursing at the other hostess and talked bad about the family. As we still waited my aunt asked the hostess a question about the wait and one of them got sassy with my aunt and called the manager which was no help either. I had my 2 month old sleeping in his stroller and they claimed that he was the reason why the wait was taking so long! We were only a party of 5, how hard is it to figure out where you guys want to sit us. After waiting over an hour we finally got seated, our server Jacob was outgoing, sweet & friendly unlike the other 2 rude girls. The manager then comes out & brings us complementary chips & salsa. My food was delicious & our server was great. If it weren't for the 2 dummies up in the front I would have given them a better rating.

Macie M.,"San Diego, CA",203,5,1,1.0,7/10/2017,"My friends and I dined in on Friday, we were sat near the kitchen when one of the bartenders and another employee were speaking negatively about a man sitting at the bar because he was ""SO GAY"". It is completely unacceptable for staff to be talking about their customers but especially about their sexual orientation, I'm not sure what this has to do with them or their job but I found it highly offensive, and I immediately wanted to leave, had my friends not already have ordered I personally would have left. I am very disappointed in the way this restaurants employees behave. This is about the third time I've been to this specific restaurant and had issues with the servers. I frequent the Chino Hills location and never have this issue I really hope that the employees will be talked to about this as it is completely unacceptable.  I will not be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=20

Stinken A.,"Riverside, CA",2,2,,2.0,3/26/2017,"Don't order 'to go' here. I ordered a simple little meal here for my lunch because I work at the mall. To start off it takes 10 minutes to get someone to pick up the phone. After placing my order, I go to pick it up 10 minutes later. After arriving at the resturant, I notice it's almost completly empty, giving no reason as to why it took so long for them to answer there phone. Speaking with the bartender, he looks up my order and tells me that my order was never placed!  It may not seem like a big deal but this isnt the first time its happened.

They gave us an extra cup of fries and sent us on our way after a total of an hour and 45 minute wait. I don't want an extra cup of fries, I want my money back.

Marissa G.,"Redondo Beach, CA",307,567,134,1.0,9/11/2015,"I went two months ago with my cousin. One a Friday night, it was crowded so we scored a table at the bar. Big mistake. Only one server was working the bar tables. Took forever to get our food and then he didn't bring us forks. My cousin had the fruit salad, which had some sort of sauce on it, making it too sticky and messy to eat by hand. Waiter was nowhere to be found. Eventually, she improvised and used the toothpick from her sandwich to eat the fruit. We didn't have napkins either, but thankfully I had a pack of Kleenex in my purse. We didn't get refills of our empty teas either. Of course he magically reappeared to drop off the bill. Came back on Tuesday for a late lunch with my mom. They're in the midst of renovations, so all the artwork is gone and they've got boards on the ground in the lobby area. They've switched to Ziosks, which is fine if you're like Chilis and are fully staffed. However, as multiple people have pointed out, this RR is too understaffed and now they've added Ziosks to avoid actually having waiters around.  Besides the 15-minute wait just for the server to come to our table and get our drink order, the food was awful and not well thought out. We each got a salad. I had the Avo-Cobb-O and the waitress said they were out of boiled egg. Um, why not make more? They take 20 minutes. Hell, the Target literally across the street sells them already boiled. From the time you opened until 3PM when I came in, could no one find the time to boil a few eggs? I saw a whole lot of standing around and laughing that suggests otherwise. The salads used to be served in a bowl, tossed already. Now, they come on a very long, narrow plate and the ingredients aren't even completely chopped let alone tossed for you. I had whole leaves of Iceberg in my salad. The chicken was in giant chunks that weren't completely sliced through. Trying to chop it up and mix the dressing with my salad resulted in a big mess. The stale, cold garlic bread on the side was the highlight of the meal.  This location needs to stop being cheap and get more servers out on the floor. On our most recent visit, the host had to run food and drinks because our server had 8 tables to deal with. Meanwhile, two managers (one male, one female) were at the pass, just chatting and having a great time. These Ziosks are not the answer. What good is a button to reorder drinks if I can see that the one and only server you have on staff is currently clearing off a table and then rushing back to the kitchen to pick up someone's order?  Stay away. Mediocre, old food and a long wait to get it. Edit: talked to the manager at the Corona location. She said the understaffing is a corporate thing. They're being given roughly a quarter of their usual hours and are being told to make it work. Yikes!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=40
Eddie Y.,"Riverside, CA",2,5,,3.0,12/19/2016,Great tasting food however meals and appetizers keep getting smaller. Got boneless wings and wedge salad. Salad was great and a good deal. Wings were laughable. Seriously pathetic. Manager said they weigh out amount of chicken they give you.  Seriously? Buffalo wilds is around the corner. They have slow service however if I'm in the mood for chicken wings they have my business. Someone's fuckn with the scale or I think they forgot to feed these chickens. It's bad when you spend $12 for lunch with a water and feel you should go to a fast food joint just to feel satisfied.  Left hungry and disappointed.  This place used to be one of my favorites. Quit being so damn cheap,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=40

Sonia A.,"Riverside, CA",0,4,4,1.0,8/12/2017,"Nice environment, decor. Waiter very nice.  But I go for the food bottomline. Were a family of 6 on a budget. Burgers for us are usually Bakers, the Habit, in & out, Islands, Carls, etc... We went here a few years ago & were not too impressed.   So when we got this coupon, I decide to give them another chance & treat ourselves to gourmet burgers. I got the burning love for about $12.  Any burger for that much should be a five or six Stars, Unforgettable, Melting in My Mouth, Extremely Uniquely Tasty & Delicious!  Again, the same disappointment as last time.  Mine was dry, no sauce, cannot taste the pepper jack cheese,  No Unique special taste!  it was not spicy or tasty really. It tasted like my husnands bbq, Ordinary. The meat was rubbery.  Not soft & delictable ( like the habits ). The original amt of fries you get are like 12.  Just because their bottomless doesnt mean you should be stingy on the first round. They were gone so fast & it took a long time to get the next round of 12. Haha!  So to leave spending 80-100 on these burgers is thievery.  My kids were like, "" I like The Habit"" better.    Thus, I will never waste my hard earned money on this place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=40
Jocelyn V.,"San Antonio, TX",114,90,107,3.0,10/10/2015,"Update: the interior design was recently changed, for the worst. Who was the person responsible? They probably are the person responsible for the over crowding at Disneyland, the hot weather in So Cal this week, and the reason Putin is so mad all the time, he probably is related to Kim Davis too. This location, was updated for the worst and there is no space, it looks tacky and not in a cute way but in I'm a burger joint trying to hard kind of way. The colors and reception at the front is strange, looks thrown together from the target design section. The menu and the dudes in the back cooking are the same.  Why did you change Red Robin.

Hands down the best Fish and Chips I have ever eaten; A perfectly crisp, golden exterior, with delicious, flaky, white Cod steaming beneath. Great salads, Fantastic Burgers. Try the Reds Double Tavern Burger for under ten bucks, and the Tower of onion rings. Americana memorabilia adorns the walls. A great place for kids and adults.

The burger are smaller then I remembered, and if they're going to offer bottomless fries, the server should be more attentive to that! Mike was our server, very hard to track to down. We waited quite some time for our French fries, so my burger got cold from just waiting. My fault though. The food was good, but it just wasn't what I was expecting. Up the service more!

The service is pretty good here if you sit in the bar area. Food comes out quickly, even if drink refills are a little slow. Red Robin Happy Hour stinks even though they advertise it everywhere, but that's not this location's fault. I appreciate the promptness and efficiency of service here, since I've spent a combined total of 40% of my upbringing waiting for my check in other Red Robins.

Kimberly W.,"Riverside, CA",18,12,1,4.0,3/25/2016,"The food and service here is, overall, pretty good. Only a few times have we had an unattentive server at this location. Because my fiancé and I usually come here after work on Fridays, there is a bit of a wait, but being a party of two, we get get seated fairly quick, usually at one of the small tables by the bar. The food is delicious, I've never had any major issues with their food, and it's delivered in a timely matter most od the time. I will say their California Chicken Burger tends to be a bit dry, on more than one occasion, so I've stopped ordering it altogether. More often then not,  my order is completely correct, though they sometimes forget my customizations, though as it's usually ""no tomato/pickles"", it's not the end of the world for me to have to take it off myself. It's when I ask for extra bleu cheese on my Bleu Ribbon burger that it upsets me when they forget. I mentioned earlier that we often sit at the small tables by the bar. They are really small, and the table gets really crowded. It doesn't help when you have this big ziosk on your table, which I absolutely love using, but it's just more in the way on such a small table. The tables are close together too, so your chair and the person behind you may be bumping into each other. Overall, great chain restaurant, only minor issues on occasion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=40
Jason H.,"Riverside, CA",143,57,7,1.0,8/28/2016,"So my wife and I used to frequent this particular Red Robin weekly. The manager and staff were amazing, we formed a close bond with Tammy the main manager because she always took great care in making sure my wife's unique order was handled safely, she has celiac and chrones so everything has to be handled very carefully.. Since Tammy has left management other than tremaine who we also love has gone down hill.. Tonight we were greeted by a guy in a cowboys jersey who was more concerned with the game then actually greeting us. Our waitress was great, Jasmine did an awesome job handling our party of 8'(celebrating moms bday).  Things really went down hill tho when I was about halfway thru my avo-Cabo salad when I found an incredibly long and nasty hair.. Jasmine was mortified and took it right back to have another one made.  The second try came out and this time instead of a piece of hair I noticed an all black (actually multiple black) pieces of avocado. At this point I just gave up and stopped eating all together.  The manager I think named Stephanie Didn't seems concerned with the fact that i hardly touched the second try.  Instead she came by and casually dropped off a ""free appetizer"" or dessert coupon and said, ""for the trouble"" ummmm, the least you could do was take this one item off the bill that was already close to $150!!! So unprofessional, we likely will go out of our way to the Rancho Cucamonga location from here on out.

Erica B.,"Corona, CA",2,16,6,1.0,8/9/2016,"Oh my goodness the worst place I have gone by far. We asked for two burgers mead/well and we get charcoal burgers. I tell the waitress they are over done and to please replace them because they are not edible. After she leaves another lady comes with the replacement burgers and says ok here are your burgers and I ask her the mead/well and she said ""yes no pink"". Ummm noo I want some pink but it's fine I don't want to waist food we can take them. So I'm not sure who she was but I'm assuming she was the manager only because she had a different color shirt. I'll let her slide because maybe she doesn't cook but how do your cooks not know what mead/well is.

I probably would have given this place more stars if it wasn't for the rude hostess at the beginning of our visit. Rachel was super sweet and quoted us 20 minutes to which we agreed to and took a seat in the waiting area. We started to notice smaller groups that came after us being called before us, which we understood because they were busy and we were a group of 5. When we noticed that another person from the same name had been called we simply asked if it was our group to which a new hostess Hannah, replied rudely ""We're still waiting on a booth for you guys (we hadn't specified which we preferred) you were quoted 30 minutes and it has only been 12"". All she had to say was that they were still waiting for a larger table for us. There was also a manager standing right next to her who said nothing about the rudeness. We would have gotten up and left if it hadn't been for Rachel calling us once again to seat us. Our server was great and the food was good but when I approached a manager with my complaint he didn't seem all too concerned. I work customer service as well so I understand rude customers,  but we weren't. We were simply asking a question. I understand that everyone has bad days but you are being paid to give your customers a good experience. We paid a lot for our food so I just feel like we should have been treated better.

Gerardo R.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,2.0,8/15/2017,"I went today for the first time and I must say I was extremely disappointed. I went there on a date thinking it would be a great place to get some good food and a friendly atmosphere. The food was good and that's the only reason I give it two stars. I would give zero stars for their customer service. It was almost towards the end of our dinner and our server had placed a pitcher of water on the bar and when he closed the door leading into the bar the pitcher fell and water got everywhere including on me. It wasn't a few drops but if not I got my glasses wet, my arm, and my shirt. I was really embarrassed because customers were laughing and instead of the server that spilled it coming up to me and apologizing for what he did he stayed at the bar and yelled ""I'm sorry"" but was not sincere. He saw me drying myself off and didn't bother to even offer me a towel or even more napkins. I found it completely rude and unacceptable that he never once came up to me to apologize for what he did. He just blew it off as if it was no big deal. I understand hat accidents happen but working in the service industry you make sure you go up to someone and apologize and try to make things right especially if you spilled water on them because they were being careless. After all that we were waiting for our check and it never came. I had to pay with my card because I just wanted to get out of there asap. I was astonished by how poor service I received and this is my first and last time I ever come to this location. It's saddens me to know that this place has good food but employs people that don't care. I am not expecting to get anything out of it but a sincere apology was the least that could have been done. I wouldn't recommend anyone come here and I know this restaurant has lost my business as well others that ask me about this place.

So we ordered from their 'Finest' menu. I got the DGB (Damn great burger,if I remember it correctly) of 1/2 lb perfect medium rare Black Angus Beef topped with a delectible combination of delicious oven-roasted tomatoes, very fresh arugula and roasted garlic aioli tossed in citrus olive oil dressing all bunned in toasted ciabatta. I liked the whole combination,delicious and nutritious. I got fresh salad with bleu cheese dressing for the side, instead of the bottomless steak fries. Overall,my meal was a good gourmet. My partner ordered the Black and Bleu burger. Medium rare 1/2 lb Black Angus Beef with sauteéd and blackened Portobello mushrooms,grilled onions,their own bleu cheese sauce, bleu cheese crumbles all in a toasted ciabatta bun and a side of Dijon sauce. His side of bottomless steak fries was crispy and fresh. He didn't like it and he's the one who used to eat here a lot.  Our server Matt was very attentive. Great service!

Seating is kind of tight inside especially when it's busy due to being in the mall. Service can be hit or miss here. Have had good waiters and some that seemed like they weren't sure what was going on. Still prefer coming here over other places in the mall as they have decent prices and a good selection of food and drinks. Their new pads they have at the tables are an awesome idea.

I sat at the bar, since I was dining solo, and just wanted to make it quick.  My burger-- something smoky with BBQ was great! The fries were good, too.  My problem was with the service, which I am hard pressed to complain about... the only reason i feel qualified to complain is that everyone around me got great service!  After my food came, I had to wait over five minutes or so to ASK for napkins... I knew i was gonna spill that delicious burger... but I could not get anyone's attention. I also asked for honey mustard, and it was never delivered, so I had to ask the bartender.  But what really annoyed me was how long it took to pay my bill--- I had actually planned on leaving only 15% tip, and not my usual 20%, but I needed change, so I was waiting for my card to be picked up. So I waited, and waited, and waited... and after 15 mins or so, I had to use the bathroom and just wanted to leave... so I just threw my bigger bill in (and gave over 20 %), when I got back from the bathroom, the money was still waiting there! I could have totally just walked out without paying!

The employees have all been very friendly, and the food is by far better than at any other red robin. The burgers are flavorful, it always comes out in good time, and always hot and fresh. I really cannot understand how anyone can complain, as this is not just a review I am making after one visit, we have been at least 10 times in the last 9 months. I refuse to go to McKinley location, even though that is so much closer to home. I will drive the extra 5 miles here any day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=120

And as anyone who knows me know that I am a huge egg fanatic! Other things I love on the menu are the French Onion soup and the Garlic Fries and Sweet Potato Fries, both of which are unlimited here!

It makes the sugary drinks more enjoyable. I came here for a birthday party with 10+ people. Almost everyone ordered an entree with fries. So, I assumed that the unlimited fries would start rolling in. One of the kids at our table would ask for a fry refill, but we would only get 1 basket. That's a little unsettling when there are 6 kids in one table. You can't expect a fry basket to last very long or for all the kids to share.

I've enjoyed many of their different burgers, and never had a bad experience with any of them. For something different and tasty, may I suggest the Royal Red Robin: the burger is topped with a fried egg.  Season it with their house seasoning, and the taste is out of this world.   Combine that with the bottomless steak fries, decent prices, and fun atmosphere, and you're always in for a treat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=120

After we ordered and finished eating, we literally waited almost a half hour before a manager walked by, heard my cousin complaining, and then finally told our waitress to bring us the bill. Then we waited another ten minutes before actually receiving, and at least another ten before she took it back to the computer. Unbelievable.

The two that I frequent the most is the Redlands location and also, the Rancho Cucamonga location. Before this location opened the closest Red Robin to me was the Redlands location, so you can say I was a bit excited when I saw the big RR banner outside the Galleria at Tyler.  The boyfriend and I visited this location during noon yesterday and it was pretty busy. There were an abundance of greeters at the door; however, they weren't really helpful at getting us seated. The hostess that directed us to our seats seemed confused as to where to sit us. She finally sat us in the corner booth of the bar that was of the utmost difficulty to get into since it was right next to someone's chair. From then on, it wasn't too bad.  Our waitress was kinda awkward, but she was nice. However, we saw another waiter who spent more than a good few minutes chatting up a customer and avoiding his other tables. The food tasted the same compared to other RR's. The restaurant itself was sort of small.

Honey S.,"Maumelle, AR",45,103,35,3.0,11/2/2013,Three stars because of so-so food quality. Service was great when we dined in but would no recommend ordering to go. When we ordered to go our containers were half full and we got tiny portions. Not okay when you've ordered chili con queso and have enough chips for one person if that.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=160
Crystal G.,"Riverside, CA",0,7,,5.0,6/3/2014,The staff at this location is always so nice and friendly! The other day I went and ordered a bacon burger! It was so tasty and good! There bottomless fries are amazing!!! Especially with the red robin seasoning! Yummy! There freckled lemonade is also so tasty and refreshing! You should try it! Definitely one of my favorite places to eat!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=160
Marie B.,"Riverside, CA",0,20,,1.0,6/23/2014,"THIS PLACE SUCKS!   The food is mediocre and the service is AWFUL!!!!   There are a lot of 20 something chicks with chips on their shoulders.... I blame Management for not letting employees know what is expected of them!  You walk in and are ignored!  Then you get adolescent back talking from the help... also argumentative with customers and they can't get your order right even when there are 2 of them taking your order!   If you like so so food and like getting treated like poop then go for it.  This is mostly for 20 something guys that need to get out of the house, grad a burger and watch tv while eating...  NOT FOR PEOPLE WITH ANY SOPHISTICATION OR STANDARDS!!!  My predictions is with service like this they will be out of business very soon!  With the economy what it is and  restaurants going under everywhere, I would be bending over backwards NOT to PISS OFF ANY CUSTOMERS that are paying you good money.  THEY DO NOT GET IT HERE!!!  Will NOT RETURN and DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=200
Brian B.,"Riverside, CA",74,48,10,5.0,6/11/2014,"Very few bad experiences here. Sometimes the parking can be hard and walking up to the restaurant can be like playing forger in real life. Great burgers the wait staff goes out of their way to make it an enjoyable experience. I usually only eat half the burger get another serving of bottomless fries and have a meal for latter and keep the calorie count down. They also will give you a soda and sauces to go ( Mmmmm campfire sauce ) . The whiskey river and DGB are favorites and the mud pie is way to much for any sane person but great to share! Although they were good it's no wonder the Ruby's a few doors down went out of business. Good food, good service, good price!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=200
Lucy B.,"Riverside, CA",0,2,,1.0,10/12/2013,"Tried twice and both times some items was undercooked and the rest was over cooked. $12 Atlantic cod fish and chips were barely cooked past frozen & did not have any seasoning - will go to H Salt Fish & Chips next time. 10$ Hamburrger patty was cooked twice as long as it needed to be, was extremely well done & the consistency was like leather.  The fries were soggy - no wonder why they give you an unlimited amount as customers probably don't want a second serving after they taste the first round - advertising gimic.  The cole slaw was plain, again no seasoning, with large chuncks of cabbage.  I felt as if I was ripped off, will NEVER go back again & suggest that you stay away if possible.  Also, the manager, Deborah, was very rude when I complained about the food.  You can go next door to the Cheesecake Factory, spend the same amount of money, & get a great meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=200

My burger was delicious. The fries were so yummy especially with their seasoning. All the employees were really nice. Got my free bday burger. The only drawback was that our appetizers came after I ate half of my burger but our waitress kept being very apologetic about it.

I've been here 4x and every time I have a bad experience. Their customer service is horrible and all of the servers seem like they're  hating their life. The food is always cold, and today I was facing the kitchen area so I saw our onion rings just sitting there for 10-15 minutes, our burgers and fries were cold too! It was disgusting!

J F.,"Corona, CA",0,35,27,4.0,8/14/2013,I was contacted by the restaurant manager probably 2-3 days after the incident. She was very concerned with the quality of service my family and I had received. I explained everything to her in detail. She apologized numerous times and offered to have us back. Service was a lot better. I said in my review that it was not the quality of the food as that has always been great. my complaint was with the service provided to us by our waitress. it really shows that Red Robin and its management team are serious about their service. I will say that they had no knowledge of us re-visiting. I guess anyone can have a bad day. All is forgiven.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=180

Kelli L.,"Carlsbad, San Diego, CA",53,18,,2.0,4/2/2014,"The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because of the food. The service is atrocious (aside from Saylor, the hostess, who was super friendly). We were seated right next to the kitchen and proceeded to sit for 10 minutes without a drink order, despite the fact our waitress came to the table right next to us twice (she had a total of 3 tables, including ours). Finally after announcing loudly we would like a drink, a manager rushed over from behind the wall and took our order. Our waitress still did not appear for another 5min. I ordered a cup of soup to start then a wrap. Bet you can guess what happened next! Our meals came out with no soup in site. I told the runner she could cancel the soup and shortly later our waitress came by to say they removed it. A few moments after that, the manager came and dropped off the soup! I didn't touch it. Our waitress only came by again to ask if we were done then left to get the check without taking our dirty plates. Needless to say, I didn't leave and tip and noted on the receipt that the zero was indicative of her service. We won't be back; I am so disappointed that this location represents Red Robin",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=180
Tim G.,"Riverside, CA",15,29,5,4.0,4/1/2013,"Early dinner with my wife - I had the Sea Scatter (I think that's what it was called) and she had the spicy burger (don't remember the name).  The drinks were potent, the fish and clams were excellent, but the shrimp, although cooked properly, were breaded oddly - like a heavy breadcrumb, that I didn't care for.  The burger my wife had was good, but a one-time-only experience, is sort of how she described it.  Bottomless fries were excellent, my side of coleslaw was really yummy, if small.  We had a lot of fun - the place was only half full (except the walls were completely full of fun stuff to look at) and we had great service - our server was very lively, talkative and uber-friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-riverside?start=180

Jenna R.,"Twentynine Palms, CA",1,1,,2.0,4/2/2014,"After an afternoon of shopping my friend and I decided to go to Red Robin for a late lunch. When we walked in we were immediately greeted by Saylor, the hostess, she is the ONLY reason why this place has two stars. She was extremely friendly and was quick to seat us. She even congratulated me on my pregnancy and made small talk about her child, which was sweet. When we sat at the table, we waiting a good 10 minutes before the manager heard me complain about not having anyone walk over to take our order and took it himself. After waiting a good 5 minutes for our drinks to arrive at the table, we waited at least 10 for our actual server to come take our food order. Our server completely forgot to bring the soup we ordered and we ended up asking for it to be removed from our bill. When our food arrived we were not impressed. Our sandwiches were greasy which made eating it not fun. The only good part of our meal were the fries and our drinks.

Veronica G.,"Riverside, CA",2,19,,1.0,6/25/2014,"I'm a regular at red Robin and I have been for the past 15 years. I order the same thing all the time every time. And I always order a basket of fries while we wait for our food. For the first time in 15 years did a waitress have the audacity to tell me NO you cannot have a basket of fries. It's our restaurant policy that we don't give fries to waiting customers because we have a shortage of french fries and the fries are for people that order hamburgers or bottomless meals.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I even asked her a second time so you telling me I can't order food right now? She said you can order it but I won't bring it to you until all of your food is ready. Not only that but she was rude. I spoke to a manager and instantly the manager came apologetic to our table.  she said was so sorry & she doesn't know who trained the waitress but her information was very wrong. The manager apologized and said she would speak to the waitress on the correct policies and my basket of fries was brought out. Shame on the waitress for not even thinking twice about what she said I was literally ordering my food who does that, says no to a paying customer? So very very disappointed with this red Robin here in Riverside at Tyler mall.
