Henry M.,"Blairstown, NJ",740,38,2,5.0,10/23/2017,My group and I stopped into this Red Robin and had an amazing experience. Probably the freshest food I've ever gotten at a Red Robin. I wanna thank our server MooMoo for the warm hospitality and excellent service. We love y'all! See ya again?!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke
Nicole P.,"Nashville, TN",82,3,,2.0,1/1/2018,"This has got to be the biggest disappointment this week. My family hardly ever goes out for dinner, and I'm sad that our one family outing fir the next several months was a fail. Waste of time and money. We were greated by space-cadet hostesses who couldn't answer for certain an allergen question, seated in a cold section, waited several minutes for our server and after placing our order, waited much longer for our drinks and even longer for our food. When food came, it was incorrect; however, we couldn't ask for fixes since we never saw our server again! We wanted our drinks refilled, but guess thats not an option. Only high point is that we could pay our bill via the kiosk at the table and get out of there!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke
Ryan L.,"Lynchburg, VA",0,1,,1.0,12/26/2017,I have always wanted to try a Red Robin.  Today we decided to drive an hour from Lynchburg to here and give it a try.  What a waste of time.  We waited an hour on two cold hamburgers.  I told the manager I wasn't paying for anything.  I was offered a gift card for a future visit which I turned down.  I wouldn't recommend going here to anyone.  If I'm paying over 10$ for a cheeseburger it had better be fresh when I get it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke
Orlando C.,"Forest, VA",61,19,4,1.0,12/7/2017,"Bambi was our waitress.  Please take better notes when taking orders.  This is 3rd visit here, very disappointed again.  Please hire better waitresses!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke
Largo S.,"Roanoke, VA",0,4,,2.0,12/13/2017,"Service was incredibly slow.  Food was cold.  Waiter didn't check on how anything was.  We'd been there once before with a similar experience but thought we'd give it another shot.  Sorry RR, but ""YUUUUUUCK""!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke
Scott W.,"Roanoke, VA",52,23,11,1.0,11/26/2017,"The last four times we've been to this Red Robin the service has been horrible. It took us 40 minutes to receive our food this trip. I asked for another French fry over ten minutes ago, still waiting. Managers used to walk around and check on customers haven't seen a single manager today. I doubt I'll ever be back to this location and according to Yelp I've been here twenty times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke
Christina L.,"Lexington, VA",8,20,2,1.0,10/14/2017,Wait staff was rude and unhelpful. My disabled mother needed a table at floor height. They instead seated us at a pub height table. When I asked for a different table they rolled their eyes and made s wait while hey seated 2 other customers who came in after us. The place was filthy too. Don't know about the food as we left after watching the 2 others be seated.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke
Pepper D.,"Magnolia, DE",0,5,,2.0,10/28/2017,"Dirty glasses and utensils. Burgers and fries were ok but there was a long wait for the small portion of extra ""bottomless"" fries.  All in all worst RR experience I have had in over a decade.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke
Bill T.,"New York, NY",1219,2039,6669,3.0,12/9/2015,"I have eaten at this Red Robin a couple of times while visiting Roanoke over the years.  It's pretty solid. Came here for lunch on a Friday and the place was fairly busy, but plenty of open tables. The hostess seemed to be disappointed that I didn't want to just sit at the bar.   I was led to an empty table and the waitress came by and told me how I could use the kiosk/tablet to order.  She took my drink order and left me to the device (as well as my own devices). I reviewed the menu on the tablet and attempted to order but the ""order"" button was greyed out.  I could see the food I wanted but just couldn't select it.  When the lady came back with my drink, she asked if I had any questions and I said ""yes, how do I order food?"".  She told me again to use the tablet but when I asked her to demonstrate she said ""Oh, this isn't working.""  She was friendly enough and tried a couple of times, then went off somewhere to make sure it was turned on or assigned to the table or something but it still didn't work.  Finally, she took my order the old-fashioned way. The food was fine.  Boneless wings and french fries.  They did come by and replenish my fries and my club soda as well.   When it came time to pay, I tried the tablet again and then it was working.   It was actually an easy process.    The food was fine and the waitress was friendly, I would just say if you have technology you want your customers to use, it should work.  And if it doesn't, your priority should be taking someone's order rather than technical troubleshooting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke
Kerry M.,"Abingdon, MD",0,2,,1.0,4/17/2017,Food was terrible and the service wasn't much better. Next time I'll go to McDonald's where I know I'll get terrible food and service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke
Jordan S.,"Troutville, VA",259,87,52,3.0,6/5/2017,This is one of our favorite places to eat at. Every time we have been our order has gotten messed up. But love the food. Burning Love is #fire,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke
Andrew D.,"Lynchburg, VA",1,6,2,4.0,7/30/2016,Food was good! Not great! Service was ok but could have been better. Took about 10 min to get drinks which is why I didn't give 5 stars,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke
Brent H.,"El Cajon, CA",0,28,,2.0,7/30/2015,"Don't go here with a group of twenty or more.   I'm giving 0 stars for service and 4 stars for the burgers. Average of 2 stars.   We showed up with 22 adults and 12 kids. We were only granted one server.   1.5 hours before our food orders were taken. 2+ hours before the kids received food. Hot mess at the end with the tickets.   Kids got to bed real late.   Food is very good.  Burgers are over priced.  But, this is a tourist area and expected.   Steer clear if you're with team sports on a schedule.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke
Michael W.,"Grinnell, IA",0,9,,3.0,12/30/2015,"Came in on the Sunday between Christmas and New Year's about 2pm, and it was very busy.  We sat at the bar, it took a long time to get our order and while the overall order was good, the burger meat was barely cooked at all though it had been ordered well done, which is the only reason the reason isn't much higher. Considering how busy it was, the noise level was very low compared to most places we've been before.  We plan to try the place again when we are in the area..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke

James T.,"Acworth, GA",1,157,21,4.0,6/30/2015,"Not thinking I went in on Fathers Day. Luckily they could fit me in at a booth/table. Nice service. I ordered the burger with the egg on it med well. The burger came out a hell of a lot redder than it should have been, but I was hungry and it tasted good. As I told the waitress 'as long as it doesnt make me sick I am OK with it"". Didn't get sick and will be returning for another... not on a holiday tho!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke
David T.,"Williamsburg, VA",13,7,1,5.0,1/5/2016,Me and my wife had a great experience here twice great food and the wait staff can be great too the bottomless fries are the best so is the seasoning I had the reds double tavern burger it was very good will probably eat here again next time I'm out here,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke
Jon B.,"Lynchburg, VA",0,15,1,2.0,7/1/2016,I called in an order and it seemed to be a very simple order. They told me it was 10 minutes before it would be ready. I went inside and waited 15 more minutes. I finally got my food. The order was wrong since they forgot to put ketchup and mustard on my burger. The burger was not that good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke
Brian C.,"Moore, OK",0,8,,2.0,1/31/2016,Staff seems to not care what's going on. I watched one of the cooks finger food on a plate in the window with his gloves on and then turn around and go back to cooking. Ordered a fish and chips. Fish was actually brown on the inside. Looked overlooked from the dark brown color of the breading. I would not recommend anyone eat here until a proper inspection is done and cooks receive training on how to handle and prepare food. Staff running around having conversations next to tables about needing to smoke. Unprofessional to a whole new level.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke
James D.,"Roanoke, VA",0,5,,1.0,3/27/2015,"Good Service but that's about it...  If you want no flavor food, slow kitchen, dirty furnishings, this is the place for you! My wife and I went there last night for the gluten free offerings.  We sensed we were in trouble when our feet were sticking to the floor in the lobby.  Yes, they have gluten free buns but the hamburger really had no flavor.  My bottomless GF Sweet Potatoes fries were a joke.  When our food was served I asked for more SP Fries.  It came out 15 minutes later after I had finished my meal.  Our server even noticed they were seasoned meaning they were cooked in the same fryer as non-GF so she wouldn't let me have them.  This in addition to the sticky floors, food stuck to the sides of the tables and dusty furnishings will keep us from returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke

Erin C.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,5,,4.0,4/8/2012,"I love this chain. This location is good but when it gets busy if you sit at the bar you'll be waiting a longer than usual.

Dave H.,"Boston, MA",22,132,67,3.0,9/19/2012,"Decent franchise restaurant.  While the menu is good, the atmosphere is not.  As a burger joint I was surprised to find a few healthy alternatives.  Veggie burger for example.   They also have a limited offer of salads, but the dressing options make it virtually useless to order. The onion rings stood out as the clear winner here.  Having said that, I found everything else ""ok.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke?start=20
Aaron K.,"Charlotte, NC",0,2,,2.0,10/4/2014,"My first time at Red Robins, this will be the last time. Food was very mediocre and prices are VERY HIGH. Bottom less fries literally came 6 fries at a time and luke warm. I ordered Cod burger, it was ok not worth the $12. My son got riblets and Mac and cheese, it was yucky and the sauces tasted like they came out of a can. $40 for the 2 of us to eat. If you like frozen food service food this is the place for you. Service was sub par too. Do yourself a favor and look for a small mom and pop place that serves food with pride.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke?start=20
Z C.,"St Charles, MO",2,26,10,3.0,8/10/2014,"Take-out was good. Service was awful.  Ordered salad and soda - called ahead to take out - in town on business. When I walked in and told the hostess I was there to pick up an order, she just pointed to the bar and said ""there."" Stood at the bar where there were two employees working but not paying attention to me. Also in front of me were dirty dishes and glasses.  Nice. Would have gone around to another part of the bar but it had dirty dishes too.  Stood there for several minutes before I was acknowledged. A manager-type, based on clothing, came over and talked to me. In a couple more minutes, my food was ready - but wait, no soda? ""Oh, you wanted a soda?"" One of the bartenders rang up my order and was nice enough; maybe she thought I would tip her for handing me a bag and asking if I wanted utensils. (No, I'll eat the salad with my hands, Thanks, though.) The hotel shuttle driver told me that she had only been to this place once because of the poor service. Now I see why.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke?start=20
Nathaniel A.,"Rocky Mount, VA",0,11,,5.0,8/31/2015,"This place is wonderful! The waitress was very attentive and always made sure our drinks were filled. We never had to press the button on the computer to reorder our drinks. The waitress was also very friendly. The food was also great. Their wings don't have that many options for sauces, but they are definitely good sauces! They have a great selection of burgers to choose from, but also other food options too. The milkshake I got was great also! The regular desserts looked great, but after eating all of my food I couldn't eat anymore! All in all, this place was wonderful, it was a bit pricey, but well worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke?start=20
Jordan W.,"Roanoke, VA",1,3,4,1.0,9/28/2013,The hostess was very slow in seating us and seemed annoyed. The manager saw that we had not been waited on and still continued to walk pass us.

Danielle D.,"Roanoke, VA",12,15,2,1.0,6/4/2013,"WOW - I am in search for a meal on a Sunday night. Decided on Red Robin. Very nicely decorated but the service was below average. 4 employees walked by me while I was waiting to be sat - no hello, no nothing. After a 10 minute wait I was finally seated in the bar area where I was made to wait an additional 8 minutes before the bar tender came to take my order. She was obviously not interested in serving our table as she bitched about how bad her job sucked to another coworker the ENTIRE time I was there. Food was delicious and came out fast. If I wanted good food, I could cook. Went to RR for the experience which fell way below my standards. Not worth your time, if your looking for a good chain restaurant - Applebee's is less than a mile away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke?start=20

D C.,"Roanoke, VA",0,3,,3.0,2/20/2016,"Great food and service as usual. BUT, while having an early lunch with few people yet in restaurant, the conversation from the party beside us was audible and disconcerting. What made it so was that of the two patrons seated, one of them was an employee at this Red Robin, but off-duty. Then an on-duty server walked up and began chatting. You couldn't help but hear the conversation about how both of these RR employees were discussing their separate love affairs. According to the conversation, they were married but sleeping with other married RR employees. Not only was the whole thing completely a sleeze-fest, but the on-duty RR server stood and chatted for about 15 minutes. If I were a manager, I'd be hot. Clearly the manager either is not supervising well or doesn't care. I'm a fan of RR's food, but this puts a damper on things at this particular restaurant. A great meal cheapened by the audio of illicit love affairs among the employees shouldn't happen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke?start=20

Kimberly R.,"Wellington, FL",0,18,,1.0,8/16/2015,"AVOID!!!!!! Walked in, sat right away. Floor was slippery/greasy. Sat. And sat. And waited. And waited. And....waited. It was not busy at all. Maybe 4 or 5 other tables.Workers all around. Walking by. Not once did any of them so much as look at us! After about 10-15 min someone finally came over and asked if we had been helped. Nope! She made some lame excuse that our waitress was helping another table, but she could take our order. Gee thanks. Bout time. So, she took our drink and food order. Then the manager came over and apologized. Offred us a free dessert. Nice enough, but too little, too late. While waiting for our food, I was able to glimpse in the kitchen as we were seated nearby. OMG!!!!! Ugh. Dirty dirty dirty. Trash overflowing, empty boxes on the ground, just gross! Seemed like alot of standing around, nothing getting done! Our food was ok. My husbands burger bun was stale. My chicken had been burnt/charcoal pieces(like big black chunks!)were falling off. Do NOT go here. Go to Applebees. Lol.

It was very loud and garish, lots of bright lights of all colors, very busy with wait staff running all over the place, dishes banging, loud music playing. It seemed like forever waiting for our food, but watching the freak show (aka the ""clientele"") was interesting. The burgers were only ok (6.5 on a 10 scale) and the prices were 2x Burger King.

When we first went neither of us knew what to expect we had never been to a red robin. But we loved it. Both time the service was great. The atmosphere is casual. The staff is freindly and outgoing. They not only are on the ball with refills and such but joke and talk with you make you feel at home. I have had a double cheese burger and a mushroom burger both were the best burgers I have ever tasted. My husband had to other different burgers and has not stopped talking about them. The bottomless steak fries is my husband's favorite thing about this place. You can keep the fries comming as long as you want just ask, they are refilled free. The soda is high but is also refillable. Prices are good. Average for prices today. Two of us can eat for about $28.00. Give or take. Last time we ordered a pile high mud pie for dessert. Which we shared. It was huge and out of this world I would recommend it though it is about $5.00 something but well worth it. They also have shakes, floats and of course mixed drinks I can not talk about these as i have not had these. I also do not drink mixed drinks. It is kid friendly, group friendly.  It is a family atmospher very relaxed. Tvs everywhere, and great decore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roanoke?start=20
