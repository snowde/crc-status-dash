Kelsey B.,"Franklin, NJ",86,4,,3.0,11/19/2017,"We recently went to Red Robin in between shopping for a quick bite to eat and a get a drink. We sat at the high tables near the bar. We ordered our first drink and waited 20 minutes to receive them, even though the bar was right in front of us. We eventually placed our order, asking for an appetizer to start. It took a while for the onion rings to come out. Shortly after receiving the app, our main course came out. They really don't give you enough time to finish one meal before the next comes out. They have really good food but just wish their time management was handled better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway
Robert N.,"Naples, FL",14,285,108,2.0,10/11/2017,It's just not good.  Burger had so much salt it wasn't edible.  Service was below average as she was barely interested in the fact that I only ate a few bites of the burger so I asked to speak to the manager who apologized and offered to make another.  Better burgers at Fuddruckers and Five Guys.  Cheaper too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway
ToniAnn D.,"Maywood, NJ",192,116,140,2.0,12/3/2017,"Let me first say that my chicken sandwich was great, no complaints there. However, my sweet potato fries were soggy and had no flavor. The service was kind of slow and the place was dirty. The bathrooms weren't well kept and the silverware wasn't all that clean to be honest. The spinach artichoke dip was pretty tasty as well, but the chips they give you stick all together. I must admit though, afterwards I was very thirsty! I feel like I had cotton mouth for hours- so the food must of been very salty. All in all though, it's more of a fast food chain, so I didn't expect the quality to be all that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway
Kristin F.,"Mount Arlington, NJ",101,85,70,3.0,6/9/2017,"Pros: Well what can I say, Red Robin burgers are delicious! Too bad I'm not too into chain restaurants, but after not coming here in a while, I thought it was time to give it another shot. I ordered the Royal Red Robin burger. It was a bacon cheese burger with a sunny side up egg, mmmmm. I'm starting to salivate again just typing about it. The service was good and speedy for a Friday night. The restaurant looked like it was packed but we were seated pretty quickly. Our waitress was a sweetheart and was very patient when we didn't know quite what we wanted yet. Gotta love the bottomless fries and soft drinks! Cons: A little too greasy for my taste. My orange cream soda just tasted like cream soda with whipped cream. My boyfriend decided to try the new Blue Moon shake, but had to send it back because it was just foam and lacked the Blue Moon taste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway

Burgers were over $11 & I could have made better ones at home.  Not gourmet anymore here.  I asked for medium well & it came back very well.  I told the waitress, but she had a huge sigh when I called over like she couldn't be bothered.  Five Guys blows them away they just don't have alcohol.   I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway

Dave O.,"Mount Arlington, NJ",97,143,201,1.0,11/23/2017,"I am so upset at my experience here.  The only positive thing was that our party was seated very quickly.  We were greeted by our server who took our drink order.  Upon placing our orders we waited and waited. It took around 20 mins to get our two burgers and two chicken dishes.  For the $52 price tags we got cold fries (who would want bottomless cold greasy fries?), unremarkable tepid bland burgers incorrectly cooked - of course without the blue cheese that was in the menu, white bitter lettuce and a very cold seating area.  My wife's refill of sweet potato fries finally came out after we were done receiving the check and paying.  Poor service, a very poor experience and a dirty restaurant with straw wrappers and used napkins on the floor leaves me no reason or desire to return.  When I asked my son how many stars it had here, he said 2.5.  I was not surprised and rather disappointed.  In VA, RR was a nice pleasant experience.  In NJ, not sure what's happened.  We will not be returning and should have gone to five guys or White Castle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway

Guess we are supposed to pass it around and share?!? The waitress was friendly, she just had way to much to do.

Alessandra D.,"Flanders, NJ",158,67,15,5.0,3/12/2017,"We come here sporadically throughout the year only because I am beyond impressed with their kids menu. It's been a few months since my last visit and boy have they improved on a lot. There have been some major renovations and the staff has received some much needed training. Once again, kids menu is 5 stars- never a complaint with that- and they added the table touch screen for the kids to play games. Service was great and I saw the manager checking in on tables throughout the dining area. For dessert, we ordered the stack of donuts which were hot, perfectly sized, and came with 2 dipping sauces. We ordered dessert added the loyalty number, and paid for the bill through the touch screen. Very cool and easy with youngsters in tow.

I ordered an iced tea with kettle one thanking like every other place it would be charged as a kettle one mixed drink they charge me for a full ice tea plus the Price of kettle one?? They said they don't use a full shot in there mixed drinks that's why they charged me separate. I guess you don't want to drink there since they're ripping you off. Wanted to mention first when we walked in the hostess had not one ounce of personality don't know where they got her from. The server was OK but needs a lot more training. Came back wants to ask us how our meals were after the appetizer and meals came out at The same time. We were never asked if we want it anymore unlimited french fries.

The food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  The last time I had eaten at a Red Robin was years ago and I don't remember the experience being especially good.  My expectations were low.  My chicken sandwich arrived at the table exactly as I had ordered it.  The food runner that brought us the food took our request for sauces and came back in a reasonable amount of time with the goods. The fries were a bit soggy, but the chicken sandwich was good and the BBQ sauce had a nice tang to it.  My colleagues enjoyed their meals as well.

Dave C.,"Kissimmee, FL",7,11,5,4.0,9/28/2016,"Admittedly Surprised! I originally came to RR for lunch to try something from the 6.99 cheesy menu  but I got stuck in the appetizer page.  They now have GREAT NORTHERN POUTINE FRIES. An extremely tasty order of steak fries smothered in brown grave (definitely canned or powdered - but it worked), garlic aioli, sautéed mushrooms, and cheese curds.   This by far is the best thing that has appeared on the Red Robin Menu.   Now to the mediocre boneless Buzz Wings. Two words describe them:  dry and dryer. They were overcooked and not enough buzz sauce to make up for it.   They definitely bring some heat so if you order them, ask for ranch or blue cheese, but I will stick to the POUTINE FRIES!

Had to wait 45 minutes for 1 cheeseburger and an order of kids chicken fingers. Everyone else around us was seated after us and ate before us. When I asked to speak to a manager the manager did not seem phased at all and appeared to be bothered that I asked to talk to him. He did, however, comp our meal. He claimed the kitchen was backed up, but then why was everyone else eating and not us? A few times we have gone and the order comes out incorrect or we get the appetizers with the burgers.

Mariah B.,"Rosedale, Queens, NY",589,238,3341,3.0,9/1/2015,"We came here on our way back from Bushkill , PA. This Red Robin is located in Rockaway TownSquare Mall which is a pretty decent mall. This Red Robin is located across from H&M. The bathroom this day was gross and smelly. The hosts were very nice and attentive. My friends and I weren't really that hungry so the waitress had very easy orders. I ordered the sangria (wasn't strong enough for me) and chili cheese fries which were just okay. The tablet on the tables are for paying your bill, playing games (which they charge you for.. Beware) and ordering desserts. Overall, I would return to try one of their infamous burgers.

Mike W.,"Newfoundland, NJ",56,48,37,1.0,8/23/2016,"Two years ago,  my Yelp review of this location would have been drastically different.  This chain, not just this particular restaurant, has significantly gotten worse.  I suspect it is the usual corporate effect, but the changes are considerable.   I do not like how they are now pushing the ""Burger and Brews,"" because you can do one thing good,  but two things crappy.  This is applicable to Red Robin, because before they focused on Brews, the burgers were good.  Entrance:  You can enter either from the street side, or Rockaway Mall side.  As of recent,  I have not encountered much of a wait.  If the Hostess quotes you a 20 minute wait,  it will really be 10.  Who knows why they overestimate that much.  A negative aspect is that they got rid of their benches out in the mall, for waiting customers.    The hostess is always quick to greet.  For some reason, they always want to seat customers at the tables directly next to the entrance doors, while other tables are open.  They got rid of the one table near the mall entrance, where you were essentially eating your meal with waiting customers. Decor:  I have no idea why they re-designed the restaurant the way they did.  Not only did they get rid of waiting seats, they put up barriers to section off parts of the restaurant.  This makes everything feel more confined and cramped.  I believe there are actually less seats on the floor,  as there were before the monstrosities.  Plus,  the place just does not feel as clean as it was before.  For instance, my table during the last visit still had crumbs on it. Food:  My family and I generally stick to salads and burgers.  If you want onion rings, get them as a side to your burger and not the tower appetizer.  Financially, it is cheaper to subsitute them for your French fries. Over our visits during the past months, we have had problems with our burgers.  From being overcooked,  undercooked, tasteless,  greasy,  and wrong toppings, we have had it all. For instance, my burger during the last visit was undercooked but I ate it anyway and got a stomach ache.  Almost every time, we send the Burgers back to the kitchen and management ""Comps"" them.  I try not to be a pain, but I want my burgers how they are ordered. I would be remissed if I also did not mention the issue with the salads.  Before all the changes,  the salads, particularly the Southwest Salad, used to be a very big portion and fresh.  Now the prices were raised and the overall salad got smaller.   On our last visit,  the avocado was fresh but lettuce was browning.  It was a very poor and sad $9 salad. Conclusion: The question I would like to present is if corporate is aware of these changes, and how many other customers are having problems as well.  There is only so many meals they can write-off before correcting their mistakes.  Due to the lack of competition in the area,  I continue to be a patron of the establishment.  Time will only tell if Red Robin leads to the same demise as Fuddruckers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway?start=20
Joseph N.,"Wayne, NJ",312,123,264,4.0,5/22/2016,"Everybody has their favorite burger chain; Five Guys, Shake Shack, Johnny Rockets, Fuddruckers, and so on...Hands down my favorite has to be Red Robin (RR). RR's burgers are consistently delicious! Moreover, the chain is always showcasing some new burger creation; I think their newest creation is a purger sandwiched between ramen noodles. The RR at the Rockaway mall is large and relatively clean. The large space yields itself for plenty of seats, so waits are not usually an issue. The staff is friendly and, service is snappy. The food is great; and with unlimited french fries who can complain. You can't go wrong with your choice of burger here.  However, if you are overwhelmed and not sure what to choose from the mammoth menu try the royal red robin burger. The royal red robin burger is a tasty bacon cheese burger that is topped off with a sunny side up egg. It is magic between buns! The burger oozes with farm fresh goodness! Seriously!...what other burger joint incorporates all of your favorite farm animals (cow, pig and chicken) between two buns?!  The fries are piping hot and endless. Also, try the new pickle coins...these fried pickles are hands-down the best pickle chips on the face of the Earth! They are the right blend of salt, sour, vinegar and crisp. RR is not the best burger place, but it is a great burger chain. So fly on over to RR for consistent burgers and yummy fries.

I asked the host about the $6.99 burger special and she was one of the most clueless workers I ever talked to. A host should atleast know a little bit about specials and the menu. I excused her and just read thru a menu myself and since I saw it on there I figured it was to be as the sign described it to be. The burger came out and was pretty small. For the Mac and Cheese on it, it was really no more than a spoonful lol the best thing about my meal was the unlimited fries and the dipping sauces (at extra cost) my waitress was very attentive but was a bit sassy.

Just three days later, we returned to the same Red Robin, but this time as grandad (Da) and grandmother (Umma) with our special needs grandson ""D"".  ""D"" can be unruly but he was on his good behavior. He used his inside voice and did not bother the other diners.  He was NOT perfect, but our server and the staff were attentive and considerate. They took our order and they we're pleased when ""D"" asked for 'chez sanwch' and fries with bubble water. We ordered two new choices of burgers and, again, we were quite happy with our selections.

Our server was very nervous and not great at her job. She barely checked in on us and when I asked for something it took me reminding her twice before I got an item. When our food came out both of the burgers we ordered tasted gassy, like they had the grill turned way too high up. My burger came out missing half of the toppings it was supposed to come with. Neither one of us finished our burgers because of the gassy taste, and our fries were nothing to write home about.

Still no pink, but this time were very greasy. Also, our salads were shorted on toppings leaving us unsatisfied.

BEWARE there are tablets available on each table that you can use to contact your server, order drinks, and play games to pass time. Our food was so slow to come out that we noticed some trivia questions popping up that you could play and asked you if you wanted to play the next question. NO WHERE on the screen did anything notify you or tell you that you would be charged an ""entertainment fee."" When it came time to pay the bill (which you pay on the tablet we noticed a $1.99 entertainment fee). Again our server was no where to be found and we paid the bill. Once Scott did attend to the table we asked about the fee and he said that it was has been a common issue and has been logged by multiple people that the pop up does not come up. Scott said he would have to the manager come to our table and give us an entertainment fee credit. When the manager came to the table he started to yell at us that the pop up comes on the screen 2 times (which it does not) and rudely hands me a piece of paper that does not offer a credit but a ""word about credit cards"" and tells me to ask questions and contact guest support on the red robins website and walks away.

CJ K.,"Hackettstown, NJ",0,23,,1.0,2/1/2016,"A friend and I stopped in on Friday night for a quick bite to eat. I had been to this location before, and I never expect anything great. It's nice to have a place in the mall with table and a bar, but the food - typical chain restaurant fare - is mediocre at best.  But Friday had to have been the worst experience. David was our server and he was extremely unhelpful, slow, and completely absent (until he wanted us to pay). It took us 15 minutes to get drinks to the table and get our food order taken (even though we mentioned we were ready to order everything when we ordered our beers).  When the beers did arrive, the glasses were filthy. Lipstick and grime on both. We were lucky we ordered bottled beers because David didn't return until well into our meal to see how everything was, so we would have been waiting a while. He wasn't even around for us to mention anything. He did apologize for the excessively gross glassware when he did finally check on us.  The orders were correct, but the food is never truly great. But that's a problem with the chain as a whole rather than an issue with this specific restaurant.   Once we finished our burgers, it was clear that David wanted us out, even as we were still finishing our drinks. He asked if we were familiar with the pay at table system (I was), so he mentioned we can pay at any time, no rush. Two minutes later, he came back to see if we had questions about it; we didn't. Another moment later, he came back to ask if we were going to use the system or wanted to pay in cash. In the guise of being helpful, he offered to split the check for us separately. This was nice, but something I've done myself as a customer before. So it read as forceful. He brought up the check on the tabletop system again for us to show us. We took the hint, chugged our drinks, and paid.  We were not there an excessive amount of time, we were ignored for most of our stay, then pushed out the door.  And while David stood out on this particular visit, I would hate to pinpoint him. I have been to this location several times and the service is never very good.

I ordered a chicken sandwich and a margarita - hey, it's the holidays, it's time to celebrate! The rest of my party ordered the same small burger, made the way they wanted and with a order of Onion rings, we were ready to eat.  As our food came out, the rest of my party did not like their burgers one bit. Thankfully my chicken sandwich was scrumptious, although that could be for the massive amount of mayo they lopped onto it... whatever, I was hungry. Additionally, my margarita wasn't too strong and that was a bummer. When it comes to restaurants I usually don't judge them based upon their lack of food, especially a place like this. The reason why it gets a lovely two stars is due to the fact that our waitress just wasn't nice. Having worked in restaurants before, I know what good quality service is and she just did not cut it.  Needless to say, my tip reflected her behavior and I will not be returning.

This is just like any other chain, it's interchangeable with Fridays, Ruby Tuesday and son on.  The only difference is that there aren't any other ones in the area.  I have been to one in VA a bunch of years ago and remember the food being better.  It probably wasn't, I probably just evolved.   Like I said, the server was nice, attentive and even cheery.  They definitely earn points for their customer service.  The meal I ordered tasted nothing like it was described in the menu.  The chocolate milk ordered for my son was more like an over sweetened milkshake, obviously just a crap load of Hershey's.  Be original and try not to kill off the youngest of clients.  The onion crisps or whatever they are called were nothing more than a pile of tasteless grease.  The chicken on my sandwich was very mediocre with zero flavor.  Even the bun was lousy.  It all tastes like mass produced slop that will kill you if you eat it often enough.  I would rather eat good tasting food if it's going to kill me. If you aren't into flavor or real food, go for it.  Otherwise, head over to another nearby grease joint that at least has flavor and semi original decor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway?start=80

Brian C.,"Flanders, NJ",8,24,,1.0,4/6/2011,"On a recent burger kick (I've tried about twelve places on my lunch hour in New York over the past few months), I felt it was time to try the nearby Red Robin.  I've never been to a Red Robin location, and while I cannot rule out going back, I am in no rush to provide repeat business. The service was absolutely atrocious.  I was told my takeout order (very simple--an A1 Peppercorn Burger) would take 10-15 minutes, but alas, at the 15 minute mark, there was no update on my burger.  No ""just a few more minutes""--in fact, even at the 20 minute mark, it required ME asking the two bartenders (neither of whom was doing much in the way of work) for an update--they did not strike up a conversation to reassure me that the order was on its way.  After staring blankly for several moments, they finally looked at my order on the computer and, without giving me an update, one of them went over to the grill. He came back about 3-4 minutes later and simply said it wasn't ready.  No update on this, no ""sorry, the order must have not gone through,"" nothing.  Another few minutes went by and he went back to the grill and again came back with no burger.  While I do appreciate his offering me a free drink while I waited, it was still vexing to get no concrete update on the status of my order. The burger eventually came at about the 33 minute mark.  The other bartender (the one who had not been checking on the grill) rang me up and offered nothing in the way of an apology.  No coupon/money-taken off the order.  No ""sorry, we're swamped today.""  Nothing.  As if the service and wait had not been utterly unacceptable. It was unclear what caused the delay.  The restaurant had a reasonable crowd, but they were far from fire-hazard levels.  There was no indication that the order did not go through.  All I could gather from this is that take-out orders take between 30 & 40 minutes, and yet they'll mislead you by telling you they'll take 10-15.  Truly unacceptable--I would MUCH RATHER have learned that they forgot to input my order than found out the takeout process is so absurdly lengthy. As for the food, it was a bit disappointing.  Burgers seem entirely dictated by the toppings--if you get a well-dressed burger, you'll be happy.  But, on its own, the patty is bland. Their fries were nothing if not overhyped.  Just basic, generic steak fries. To the restaurant's credit, I heard from a buddy that works in the mall that the service is not ordinarly atrocious.  But you only get one chance to make a first impression, and my first impression of Red Robin is beyond horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway?start=80

Then how come they can't cook a burger as ordered? Is it really that hard when you cook burgers all day, every day? I ordered the ""Smoke and Pepper"" burger because I was starving and the picture looked amazing. I ordered it medium rare. It came out with limp, almost rare bacon and was fully cooked through, easily medium well. I didn't want to send it back but luckily (the very good, attentive) waitress had them take it off the bill.  I ended up going next door to Cups to get some frozen yogurt before I had to get to work. I will not be back to Red Robin, nor will the friend I had lunch with. Total waste of money. If you want a burger that's cooked perfectly and tastes delicious, walk past Red Robin, go into Macy's, take the down escalator, turn left when you get off and walk straight to Muldoon's - where you'll get a burger that will be worth the money charged for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway?start=100

Our most recent visit saw us waiting 30 minutes just to receive the guac dip appetizer and a kids meal. Once the meals came, they somehow managed to forget the onion straws on one of the burgers. We didn't dare send it back for fear of how long it would take.  Regarding the guacamole dip, I don't know why Red Robin has decided to shrink it so dramatically, but it is no longer worth ordering.

I went here post hurricane for a warm meal and some heat. The place was packed, but I was expecting that since nobody had power and wanted some place to warm up. What was really neat is their wait system. We came and were told that there was a 30-45 minute wait (can't blame them!). The hostess took our information on an iPad (which I thought was neat) and also took my cell phone number. What they used with the phone number was about 30 minutes later texted us to tell us that our table was ready! We were able to walk around the mall and not worry about our name getting called when we were gone. We walked in when they texted us and were immediately seated! Moreover, in the initial text, they give you a link to check on your place in line. Red Robin is known for their burgers, so that is what I got. I am a sucker for hot food so I ordered the Cry Baby style burger (ghost pepper ketchup, fried onions, among other things). The burger came with their unlimited fries. I also ordered the strawberry lemonade. The strawberry lemonade came in a pretty neat glass. The lemonade comes with real strawberries in it which were so good. While the glass is deceptively small and the drink is on the higher end price wise, it is bottomless, so you are not actually being ripped off! The food came out really fast. The burger was pretty good. All the ingredients worked well together (I added some cheese since it wasn't included). Since it was named the Cry Baby burger, I expected to be crying, but it was far from hot. I didn't break a tear or a sweat. The burger was good even though I didn't cry. The fries are really good steak fries as well (these are also bottomless). Overall, it was a good experience. We had to wait a little for our check, but otherwise service was decent.

Megan K.,"Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ",0,17,10,1.0,10/8/2011,"Went here for lunch with some friends on a Saturday afternoon. We had seen the commercials and since the burgers always looked so good we made a special trip to try it. Well we were seriously underwhelmed.  When we walked in the restaurant there was no one at the host station. There were however, two employees chatting away at the bar in no apparent rush to seat us even though they looked right at us.  After finally being seated our waiter appeared, took our order, and yawned in our faces. Obviously, our orders didn't entertain him. When our drinks came my friend picked up the container of sugar packets to add to her iced tea, and hiding behind it were dirty napkins and straw wrappers. I guess clean tables don't entertain them either. We ordered the onion ring tower for an appetizer, which I have to say were probably some of the best I have ever had. Although, the dipping sauces did leave a little to be desired.  Then the burgers came out. My boyfriend ordered the Whiskey River burger on the jalapeno roll, some pink. Our friend ordered the bacon cheeseburger with cheddar cheese and pickle relish, no pink. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with cheddar, some pink. Mine and my boyfriend's orders came out fine. As our friend took a bite of her burger, she realized her burger was not cooked to her liking, indeed it was pinker than either of the some pink burgers. So she asked to send it back to have it cooked more. No big deal right? Well you would have thought she asked them to reconstruct the Coliseum. It took 20 minutes for them to come back with the recooked burger. When it finally came she asked for an extra plate, the waiter went to get it, but instead served another table first. You would think after making a patron wait so long to finally get her food they would try to get her what she needed asap.  My friend at this point was extremely angry and got up to speak to the manager. I will give them credit, however, because after the manager found out about our issues, we were met with an apology from everyone we had come in contact with and our meal was comped.  Even still, the burgers were mediocre at best and vastly under seasoned. The steak fries that they say are from America's best potatoes seemed like nothing more than a bag of frozen fries you can find in the freezer section of any grocery store. Plus the cost for basically America's simplest meal, a burger and fries, is a little much.  Everything totaled I don't think we will be returning to Red Robin.

William W.,"Northampton, MA",0,44,,3.0,8/12/2011,"Red Robin is an upscale burger joint, sort of a cross between McDonalds and TGI Fridays. The decor is similar to the latter while the food resembles the former. The dining room is nicely appointed with lots of polished wood and expensive looking tile. A full bar occupies the center of the restaurant, although it wasn't doing much business on a weekday at lunch time. There are raised booths around the periphery of the dining room, where, I assume, the cool and attractive people are seated so as to be more clearly seen and admired by the riffraff below. I was shown to a less exalted station -- a small table behind a planter near the door to the mall. Nevertheless the service was fine.  I ordered a salad, a patty melt, and iced tea to drink. The salad was good -- a colorful assortment of greens and chopped vegetables sprinkled with bits of an orange cheese-like substance and served with a wedge of pita bread. I asked for Italian dressing. It came in a little tub, separate from the salad. I prefer salads to be tossed with the dressing so every piece is evenly coated, but it's not the end of the world if it's not. The dressing, unfortunately, had that gelatinous, slightly slimy appearance that tells you it came in a bottle from a factory. It was also loaded with sugar, but I think I'm in the minority in this country in not liking sweet salads. Italian it was not.  When I ordered the patty melt, the server asked how I wanted it cooked -- ""pink or no pink."" I said ""no pink,"" but it came pink inside just the same. (Sometimes I wonder, what's the point?) Taking my life in my hands, I ate it anyway. And it was pretty good -- the burger was tender and juicy, the onions were nicely caramelized, and there was just the right amount of melted American cheese to glue everything together. It was served between two slices of grilled dark rye bread, which had a pronounced carroway flavor that I enjoyed, although I could detect no seeds in the bread.  All the sandwiches here are accompanied by steak fries, which the menu touts as being made with ""America's highest-quality premium potatoes."" I thought they were pretty mediocre. They had the uniformity of shape and color which indicated they had been hanging out in a plastic bag in the freezer rather than having been cut from fresh potatoes, premium quality or otherwise. They were also limp, lukewarm, and under seasoned.  So all things considered, I'd grade my meal here a B-, and at $18 not including the tip, it was quite expensive. Those ""premium potatoes"" don't come cheap I guess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway?start=120
Louis C.,"Sparta, NJ",0,7,,2.0,9/25/2013,"Tried it twice. I don't see the attraction. Burgers are so so, service is a no no. After waiting ridiculous time to be seated, then longer to get served with what is really just   fast food.

Melissa A.,"Rockaway Township, NJ",2,31,,1.0,8/13/2013,"There is a reason why I no longer frequent this Red Robin location, despite the fact that it is right in my own backyard. Mistakingly, last week I made an exception after receiving an e-mail regarding my free birthday burger as part of the Red Robin Royalty Program. In a nutshell, this Red Robin location truly is ""for the birds""!!! Since its opening a couple of years ago I don't think I can really remember a time where the food didn't take FOREVER to come out, regardless of whether they are busy or not. Just read the reviews...nearly every reviewer says exactly the same thing! Even the people at the table across from us had complained about the ridiculous amount of time that it was taking to receive a burger, and had something comped on their bill...a typical sight at this Red Robin. My husband and I waited over a half an hour for our food, in which time our server never gave us any updates on the status of our meals. After all, the servers already know the deal...this is commonplace here. Besides the fact that my patty melt came out without onions, it was also burned to a crisp and black on the edges. By the time I had locked eyes with our server and signaled that I needed him, my husband was nearing the finish line on his dinner. I had come to the decision that I was not going to place a second order and wait close to another year for near frickin' fast food. I told our server that I was sending back my food, and as usual they send the manager right on over. The manager seemed pleasant enough but after a while you just get sick of hearing the same old ""schpeel,"" if you know what I mean. He admitted that although there was no excuse for everything that transpired that evening, they are currently understaffed and are always trying to improve on things. It killed me to not respond, ""I guess you have been understaffed since you opened your doors,"" but I bit my tongue. Otherwise I was painfully truthful in my complaint, and everything that I have typed in this review I stated to the manager. I even managed to tell him how I have never experienced any problems at their Clifton location, which is ALWAYS busy! He asked me if I wanted anything else but I told him that I didn't feel like waiting again, that my husband was basically done eating, and that we hadn't planned on being there that long. I'm not looking for a handout or anything, but just believe that a good manager would have comped my husband's burger...but figured perhaps they didn't because with all the comping going on there they must be near bankruptcy! Afterwards we ended up stopping by McDonald's, and even though I don't like their burgers very much anymore it was soooooo much more worth it! No aggravation, no wait (unless you count five minutes for FRESH fries!), and all this for a fraction of the price! The thing that really sucks is that my husband ended up cashing in on my birthday burger...Happy Birthday To Me!  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway?start=120
Justin F.,"Rockaway, NJ",304,71,,4.0,7/6/2011,"This is a good place for burgers. I've been there only once, and I enjoy the burgers and the endless fries...i only ate half of the bacon cheese burger, which was huge, and some of the fries. I had an ice cream shake, which was filling. THe atmosphere can be noisy at times, and service can be on and off. THey even have a bar near tvs for watching sports.

The manager is funny and awesome; he knocked off a whole meal off our check because I had a few drops of water drip on me from the leaking ceiling from the snow.

Teresa S.,"Lake Hopatcong, NJ",0,4,,1.0,3/29/2013,"Granted, it's a stinkin Red Robin for crying out loud, but I've had more attentive service at McDonalds.  First, we were told the wait for our party of 5 (including 4 year old twins) would be 10-15 minutes.  Rather, it was more like 25 minutes.  Seated and after we received our drinks, waitress slow to come back for our order, even after everyone closed the menus.  It took about 45 minutes before the first dish hit the table (we told her to bring dishes out as they were ready as we were short on time).  On top of that, beverages weren't refilled unless asked and I had to wait for silverware after my meal finally arrived.  It became very clear the kitchen was running slowly that day, the waitress should have warned us but instead laughed at me when I asked.  That $45 could have been better spent elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway?start=120

Amy L.,"Pequannock, NJ",4,6,1,1.0,12/31/2011,I have a huge issue with this place.  My fiance and I went here to try it out.  We went when they weren't busy at all.  We were seated once we entered.  We sat at the table for over 30 minutes with no service what so ever.  We watched the employees talk a mile a minute and take orders from the people after us.  When we finally got up annoyed the people next to us said they had been waiting for an hour and once they finished the last round in cards they were going to leave as well.

Dana R.,"Lake Hiawatha, NJ",5,57,2,1.0,7/21/2014,"Husband and I stopped in here while shopping in the mall. We have been to another location & it was great! This one, not so much. The waiter was never to be seen, we had to keep asking another waiter for our waiter just to get more drinks. The appetizers were awful - we had the Guac, Salsa and chips - well, the guac was just plain avocado with extra extra salt, and the salsa was literally, tomato sauce. We just ate the chips. I had a burger, it was good, my husband had the french dip which was extremely dry. I complained to the manager, nothing was done about it, we paid & left. I responded to the survey on the bottom of my receipt once I got home, then I heard from another manager. We spoke for well over 20 minutes on the phone about what went wrong - he said he wanted me to try it again as he promised that was not their belief for their customers. So he said he will be sending me a gift card to cover the full amount of what we paid during that trip. I never received it & never went back. I wasn't asking for a refund, I just wanted the manager to know the awful service and the awful appetizers",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway?start=120
Richard B.,"Dover, NJ",1,63,31,4.0,8/11/2012,"I've always been pleased with the burgers at red robin. I would love to try more menu items but I can't seem to let go of my sautéed shroom burger. The French onion soup is an excellent complement. The bottomless steak fries are a fantastic touch and I can search for the bottom! Waitstaff seems to get pissy if you want more than 2 refills but I scavenge off my other party member plates after that point anyhow; it just helps us leave quicker. If you bring kids and they order from the children's menu be sure to keep away from the pizza, it is GARBAGE. You wouldn't expect the child pizza at a burger place to be anything to write home about, but not even my toddler would eat it. Only a corporate mentality that focuses on numbers would think its worth serving.  The freckled lemonade is my beverage of choice, and there's good deals on happy hour drinks and appetizers in the bar, just make sure to ask to be seated accordingly. I come here whenever the opportunity arises.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway?start=120

Megan B.,"Lutz, FL",3,8,1,2.0,2/12/2011,"Host/hostess area was very poorly run. They told everybody a smaller amount of wait time than there really was (told me 15 minutes, we waited 45) and they kept screwing up... We asked for a high chair and were treated as if we had asked for some sort of unheard of seating arrangement, or like we were a party of 30 or something. There did not seem to be any sort of rhyme or reason as to how they were seating people, I think because they all each had a plan for the tables but weren't communicating with one another.  Everybody who came up to the hostess station was told that they were ""next""... how can every single party be next? By the time we were finally seated, our very well behaved children were cranky with hunger. The server was nice but rushed us to order and rushed us out of there, too, taking my plate away while I was still eating. The burger itself was alright... juiciness was ok but the ""burger experience"" was boring. If I tried this place again it would be without kids and I also would try a burger with some sort of ""zest"" to it. Also, I ordered it bunless but it came wrapped in SO MUCH lettuce that it was hard to even get to the burger through the lettuce (there was at least 1/4 of a head of iceberg on it... enough that I couldn't pick it up and it filled my entire basket with lettuce.) My husband thought his burger was ok but sort of boring, as well.  Daughter liked her corndog, though it took several reminders to the server for her to receive her chocolate milk. Overall, I think this COULD been an ok eating experience had they just been honest with me up front about how long it would take to be seated. If we hadn't been so rushed to order, I may have selected a different burger that I would have enjoyed more, as well. Just an example of how ""front of the house"" stuff can really sour a dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockaway?start=120
