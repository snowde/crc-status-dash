Sparky Jr. D.,"San Jose, CA",2,42,133,3.0,1/4/2018,"Sorry I have to do this, Red Robin. I've been a pretty consistent fan of this restaurant for the last three years for its cheap prices and friendly staff. The food has always been okay; no complaints there. Not too long ago, the staff was very attentive and bottomless fries still existed! Now, good luck tracking down your server for napkins or a refill on those ""bottomless"" fries and root beer floats you paid for.  I appreciate the efforts our server made today to at least acknowledge our presence after 10 minutes of being seated, but the fact that it took him 20 minutes since we were seated to actually put in our order shows how understaffed this restaurant is. Our server was running around to so many other tables I couldn't even keep track. I don't blame him, but I do hope that this restaurant gets him some more help and other employees on the floor. Additional stars given for Daphne, Tiffany and Steven. I've never seen such enthusiastic workers and despite the wait time that comes frequently when dining here, I've always enjoyed their service and appreciate their hard work. Hope to see some improvements and some new staff members to help out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose
Shannen R.,"San Jose, CA",267,400,228,3.0,12/27/2017,"I've been to a few Red Robin locations in the past. I'm going to have to say this again: ""Red Robbiiiiinnnn....yuuuuum."" S/O and I were looking for something to eat before we head into REI. Came around 2:30 and the place wasn't packed. We had to wait about 10 min to get seated. We waited another 10 minutes for someone to take our order.  Our waitress was really nice though, so that's a plus. S/O ordered the Burnin' Love Burger with onion rings. He finished his meal quick so it's safe to say that he likes it. I ordered the chicken burger with garlic fries. I liked the garlic fries more than my burger, so that says something. Each table has it's own mini tablet where you are able to order games and pay for your meal with a card. It's easy peasy to use if you will. Otherwise, bring enough cash + tip so you can walk out quick. Not a big fan of Red Robin but it sure fills you up quick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose
Brandon Y.,"San Jose, CA",827,615,1134,2.0,12/13/2017,"Solid 2.5 stars - went here for ma's b-day because she loves the bottomless fries, though overall nothing really stood out too much. At over $11 for a burger, even though they are 1/2 pound burgers, I expected a bit more. We got the chips and guac appetizer, which didn't really feature that many chips or that much salsa/guac, and it took a while to get more fries and pay, despite the digital menu device blinking. Overall, I feel like Red Robin has potential, but there would need to be an improvement in quantity of food and service that would make me more inclined to visit more often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose
an l.,"San Jose, CA",90,188,283,1.0,12/12/2017,"I don't even know how this place remains opens. The staff seemed more concerned with socializing with the cooks than serving the customers. We were seated at 835pm. Had to click ask for server on their touch screen at 845. At 850 she came and said sorry. Ordered and since we were starving, we asked if we could have our fries first. It's 905 and we still have not had any food delivered to our table especially the fries that we asked for first. When our food was finally brought to us, we were given no utensils, no napkins, no ketchup. Our waitress stated she would bring it right to us and we watched her go take another order to the bar, check on two other tables before she brought us anything.  There were only four other tables in the restaurant at the time we were there. Onto the food. Our fries were cold and the burgers were soggy from too much sauce. It wasn't the burgers I was used to eating at Red Robin years ago. I've never been so disappointed in a burger ever. This was worst than a Carl's Jr. burger.  Sure enough she never checked back in on us. We paid on the little kiosk they have at the table which takes away the whole food ""service"" aspect of working in a restaurant. I guess the up side of being able to pay at the table is we didn't have to flag down the waitress who didn't do anything other than bring our food to us. She did not deserve a tip and Red Robin did not deserve us as patrons. One star is more than what this place deserves. Last but not least, I checked my email receipt and was charged 1.99 for entertainment center which we did no use for any sort of entertainment other than paying. This place is a scam.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose
Heather R.,"San Jose, CA",11,65,110,2.0,8/28/2017,"This place can be a hit or miss, and Saturday's dinner was definitely a MISS. We got there around 4:45, so I wasn't expecting service to be slow. Took about 10 minutes for our server to greet us after being sat. I ordered a simple chicken, lettuces wrap sandwich. Delicious. No problems there. But hubby's food on the other hand, unacceptable. He ordered a bacon cheeseburger from the gourmet section, and that's where things went very wrong. His patty was BURNt!! Wtf. Shame on you cooks for having the balls to serve it. Then they had the brilliant idea to have the burned part of the patty turned over because you know, we wouldn't be able to taste the burnt-ness that way.  We let our server know right away (which took another 3 minutes or so because I flagged her down), and she swapped it out for us.  Will we be back? Probably.

Melanie S.,"Seven Trees, San Jose, CA",176,131,297,3.0,11/20/2017,"We were seated right away. The server was very friendly and extremely attentive. His name was Elliot. My friend enjoys coming to this particular Red Robin because it was the place of her first date  with her boyfriend. She recommended the pretzel bites because of the beer cheese it comes with. She was right, it was delicious! We ordered the bbq chicken wrap to share and they were accommodating because one of us wanted chicken and one of us didn't. We added avocado and this also was delicious! I did notice other tables were having difficulty with their orders being brought out. One table offered to pay $5 for their drink and wanted to cancel their order because of the long wait. Either my friend and I were not aware of the long wait or our server was just on top it! I had a pleasant experience and will probably come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose

Melissa M.,"Campbell, CA",0,30,4,1.0,12/19/2017,"Burgers are usually pretty good. The rest of it, not impressed. Arrived around 11:15 to an empty restaurant and a 15 minute wait. Not a good start. Was starving, so ordered quickly, and added a salad so we could have something to munch on while we waited. That was a waste, as it showed up with the rest of our meal. Couldn't get our waiter's attention to save my life. Good luck getting bottomless fries. Asked for medium well burger, it was raw.  I understand s*#! happens, but this has been the experience I've had for at least the past few visits and I'm over it. Didn't bother mentioning anything to the manager because I did during my last visit and he was defensive, rude and dismissive.

Amanda P.,"San Jose, CA",76,46,54,5.0,7/26/2017,"Phenomenal service from our waitress Tiffany, if she hasn't been given a raise yet, she definitely deserves it. Came with two of my friends around 7:30-8:00, hoping for a good bite. We ordered two appetizers being the onion rings and the chips and dip. Both came out fairly quick and was super satisfying. About my meal, I had the french onion soup as well as the Garden Burger (got the veggie patty but you can opt out for the vegan boca). Can't say I remember the prices of my meal but it was phenomenal. The French onion was super creamy with the amounts of melted cheese that was on top and the veggie burger tasted healthier than I expected. Woo-hoo! I also ended up signing up for the Red Robin's rewards system which seemed to have great perks as you build up your criteria. Plus a free burger on your birthday month! Overall, super satisfied with the restaurant's hospitality, the steamin' food and the open environment to just enjoy a meal with friends. Second time at this location and both 5/5 stars, great job guys!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose
Mark O.,"Bellingham, WA",163,239,737,4.0,4/16/2017,"This is a busy location, but we were seated fairly promptly and received excellent service. Although it was a little noisy, the food was excellent. I ordered a Blue Ribbon Burger which was prepared exactly to my specifications. My three companions and I shared a guacamole, salsa and chips appetizer and the waiter brought us additional tortilla chips quite promptly. My companions seemed quite pleased with their meals (Salmon Caesar Wrap, Whiskey BBQ Burger and Mac-n-Cheese + a cup of Red's fabulous French Onion Soup).

Steven S.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,6,,2.0,1/1/2018,"For a self professed gourmet burger joint with unlimited fries, this visit failed on both counts.  The first two angus burgers ordered medium rare arrived well done with a very small number of cold fries on the side.  While we waited for a redo on the burgers another order of fries arrived cold and dry again.  Second burgers were better but closer to medium and edges were crispy singed.  The final fries attempt came very hot but the potato centers were not meaty and flaky but weirdly creamy.   Dessert guys?  No thanks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose

Judy W.,"San Jose, CA",55,134,105,3.0,8/10/2017,"I ate the Red Robin classic hamburger and my friends ordered onion rings stack appetizer. I'm allergic to the onion rings bread crumb exterior or the oil they used! Unfortunately, I didn't notice until I left the place and went to another place. This shows that their oil used is not good for us because I am sensitive to the oil restaurants use in their food. I am definitely able to eat onion rings at different restaurants. The waiter thought my friend, her brother, and I were trying to save $ and gave us the onion rings for free. Great service and we tipped him 20-25%. Great waiter. Sadly, I won't return for another while.  ---------------------------------------- First time here! The red robin classic hamburger was great! The bottomless fries were worth it, hot and steaming!

We had been sitting for 40 minutes and our waitress hadn't even introduced herself. They said they were busy but there was only 2 other full tables in our section.

Carlos A.,"San Jose, CA",317,149,749,4.0,1/19/2017,"Haven't been to a Red Robins in a long time and for no particular reason! So I came here with my wife after shopping at Westgate and burgers sounded like a good idea! So we get there and I ordered The A-1 burger, pink and with an extra patty!  It's must of been an off day from when the other reviews went because my burger was close to perfect.It was juicy, full of flavor, had that char flavor note, and was extremely filling...of course the bottomless fries helped but I only had one serving as the burger was more than enough!  A solid 4 stars as a 4.5 may have been given had my burger been more on the pink side and less on the well side although the cook managed to serve up a juicy burger. Like I said, we must have hit the burger lottery because our burgers were spot on and the service from our server was second to none! And just an FYI my review comes of a comparison to the many burger spots I've been to. Being a former Marine I've had many a burger from different parts of the U.S. ----Almost forgot, you have to try the pretzel bits with the beer-cheese! The pretzels are light and fluffy not dense like you think a pretzel would be and the cheese sauce is nice as you can taste the hint of cervesa!!

I usually experience long wait times here, so we already decided if there was a wait, then we would leave. We ordered the blue cheese burger with fries and the veggie burger with garlic fries. Both were good and reasonably priced, but nothing amazing. The garlic fries didn't come out until my bf was pretty much done with his burger, but they ended up giving us 2 baskets. Our server was attentive and apologized for the wait time on the fries. I do think their $6.99 burger with fries is a good deal.

Michael B.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,24,11,1.0,11/29/2017,"My fiancé and I went in for lunch the other day within fifteen minutes of them opening. We both ordered pretty basic stuff. She got a tavern burger with cheddar cheese. I got a blue ribbon burger on a regular bun and an ice tea.  The server says no problem it will be out shortly. No mind you I used to work for these guys in Alaska and when my uncle owned it it was a really great place and we were busy from open to close. This location maybe had 20 people in for lunch at best with in the first half hour. From the time we ordered to the time we were served, it took at least twenty minutes to see our server who told me the ice tea machine was having issues, it would be a few more minutes to get some tea. When she brought it to me it was like dirty water and had little to no tea flavor. But said it would get me started. I was not impressed.  Then our burgers came, the fries were ice cold and the burgers were like warm. Furthermore if you go into a place and they ask you for temp on a burger (some pink or no pink as the ask) than if you ask for some pink you should get what you order especially when the place is not busy. But instead my burger was cooked all the way through. A server there that we know got us one of the managers. They said they could remake. But we figured it took 30 minutes to get in the first place we were not going to wait another 30 minutes. Let alone pay for food we didn't order.  I mean how hard is it when you first open to not have the right food and drink ready and waiting. Is it a lack of training, lack of standards or a pure lack of leadership. That's why you have regs and checklists. If someone is running late it can mess up the whole team. Maybe schedule your crew fifteen minutes earlier to make sure things are done right. The manager gave us coupons for two apps, is that really a good standard. Besides taking care of our food for that day, he should have taken the time to get our names and take down our concern.  He invited us back but didn't give us his card. A little unpersonal if you ask me. Not a good lasting impression. 11/28/17 Went back today to give them a second chance. Huge mistake! I am not certain where the lack of training is coming from or even the pride of ownership of ones duties. But even after telling the server exactly how we wanted our meals, there was some type of breakdown either from the Manager who was in the kitchen actually cooking our burgers or the server who put in the ticket. They were not very busy so there should not have been any mistakes. My fiancé ordered a tavern burger with cheddar cheese and no sauce. Yet the burger came to us with American cheese and sauce all over the bottom bun. Her second burger can back with the bun soaked in grease, one patty that was charded to hell and back and a top bun that was all ripped up. Obviously they pitched the bottom bun and patty and did them over, scrapped the cheese off the top patty and just recheesed it. Then tried to heat the bun up on the flat top. What a fucking joke!! Plus the fries they sent out weren't even hot, and looked like ones left over from an earlier batch that had been sitting a while.  I got the Royal Red burger. The nice picture shows it with a sunny side up nice looking egg. What I got was a broken yolk chard flat egg with burn bottom and edges. Plus if a server asks you if you want some pink to the patty, you would expect some pink. Not the hockey puck that I got. I sent it back and still got a well done patty but the egg was sunny side up with a burnt bottom and edges. Which is a true indicator the cook did the egg in a hurry over high heat. I did not have the time or fortitude to wait a third time and told the server to just remove it. And I got my meal with a side salad instead of fries, but could only eat part of it because the lettuce was rusted and the green leaf was wilted. Two things you never want to see I. Your salad greens.  We got up from our table and asked to see the manager. We waited up front far too long and walked out. ""Larry"" the manager said he made our food but he was confused. Not what I would want to hear from a person who is supposed to be in charge. Told us to come back sometime for a burger on him. But not sure that's a risk I want to take again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=20

The patty was juicy and well done. The pineapple wasn't I believe grilled, but it was warm and its flavor melded with the burger perfectly.

The chicken sandwich was decent but the broccoli didn't show up until we were almost done. We were never offered refill for the sides.

Bryan W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1107,1018,2609,4.0,7/26/2017,"When you were a kid (assuming you aren't any longer), did you ever have such a dreadful experience at a restaurant that you promised yourself you wouldn't eat there again? To me, that experience was at Red Robin Gourmet Burgers. When I was in middle school (or was it high school??), I had eaten at the Red Robin near my house for the very first time; I really didn't like their burgers one bit and decided I would never visit a Red Robin ever again. The only positive thing out of that experience was that they had decent fries.  Fast forward about 10 years and I've kept up my promise to avoid Red Robin. But that all changed when I decided to give it another try since my girlfriend got a free deal through their birthday rewards (basically if it's your birthday month, you can get any free burger from ""gourmet burger"" section). We ended up going to the one in San Jose. The Red Robin Gourmet Burgers that we went to was on El Paseo de Saratoga within the Westgate shopping plaza. Since it's a huge mall, there should always be plenty of parking. Getting here is also very easy because the plaza is nearby major streets (like San Tomas Expressway and Saratoga). I recommend coming slightly before you get hungry because wait times can be long. Even though it was a Monday night around 630pm, we had to wait approximately 15 minutes before getting in. And it would also take us around 20 minutes to actually get our food.  If you have never been to Red Robin Gourmet Burgers before, this restaurant is another one of those big burger chains that you see on T.V. and everywhere you go. As the name suggests, this restaurant specializes in fat, juicy burgers with a variety of different ingredients. Their burgers are split between the classic gourmet burgers (like the guac bacon and the original), and their finest burgers (fancier burgers with ingredients like arugula). In terms of pricing, Red Robin is a bit more expensive than most burger chains for what you get (more on that later), but one reason why people keep coming is because of their unlimited steak fries (they come with each meal and you can substitute for other type of fries for more $$). I ended up getting the Burnin' Love and my girlfriend got the Guacamole Bacon. -Burnin' Love (6/10). First off, I give props to Red Robin for actually putting some spice in this burger. Usually, most restaurants are flaky with their ""spicy"" burgers, but this one packed some heat. I love the idea of frying the jalapenos and placing one right on top of the burger. However, the burger falls really short: The patty was super small and not that juicy. It looked and tasted more like a charbroiled diner style burger (something you see at In n Out), which was disappointing as it should have been bigger. Plus, they don't have a medium rare option! And furthermore, the lettuce was very, very meh. They used sliced lettuce which probably came from a giant pack. Why not use a large slice of iceberg lettuce? I mean you clearly have some if it's on your wedgie burger picture? But all in all, this wasn't a ""bad"" burger per say. I feel like it didn't meet my low expectations.  -Guac Bacon (7/10). Though the Guac Bacon burger has the same shortcomings as the above, at least they had a very large helping of guac to make up for the meh patty. I love the bacon in there, even though it wasn't crispy. All in all, I probably would've gotten this one instead. Or maybe the swiss mushroom..  -Steak Fries (9/10). To be honest, I'd probably come to Red Robin just for their steak fries. They are HUGE, super crispy, and warm. I recommend getting a refill/second batch because those are much hotter and crispier. That's because when you get your burger, the fries have been sitting since it takes longer to make a burger than fries. Thus, get the second batch!! All in all, I have to rate the food quality at Red Robin 3 stars at best. It was probably just as I'd remembered it as a kid. HOWEVER, the biggest redeeming factor of this place was the hella good service. First off, the waitress/waiter who were both serving us were super kind; they kept asking if everything was okay. They also processed our checks very fast. And second, the boss was SO HELPFUL for getting my phone out of the little crevice in the bench where I dropped it in. I was a bit distressed since I always do this to myself, but he was very kid to me. He jokingly asked for a $100 tip, and if I had that money, maybe I would. So for that, I end up giving Red Robin a ""nice-su, you can take your parents here and they'll be happy."" TBH my parents would probably be okay with this since they love good service. But if you want the creme de la creme of burgers, this Red Robin (or any for that matter) is not for you. Eat well and prosper,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=20
Jeanette T.,"San Jose, CA",33,12,3,1.0,11/26/2017,"Came here after my best friend's wedding! I had a bad experience at a different Red Robin location but since the bride and groom wanted Red Robin, I decided to give it another shot. BAD IDEA!! Apps never came out, asked if we could swap some side for fries was told there was an additional charge (no problem) but when the food came, NO FRIES! I sure got charged for them though. The kids plates (which did have fries) were COLD!! I mean COLD COLD!! really?? My burger was dry and overcooked. I had to go and find the waiter to get refills & ask to not be charged for the appetizers since we never received them!! I would have spoken to the manager about these issues but as I stated I was the driver and had the bride and groom with me who had to go get ready for their reception!!

Yaya O.,"Santa Clara, CA",19,63,16,1.0,6/23/2017,It's sad that I have to write a negative review I really wanted to try this place but it was just beyond unreasonable. It's Friday night and not busy at all. I'm here with my family and the two hosts at the front tell us that we can be seated but it will be an hours for us to get any food because their kitchen is behind. I've never encountered this before I would understand if it was busy but the place wasn't.

Ryan L.,"San Jose, CA",483,1136,3043,1.0,11/22/2016,"I was craving Red Robin so I made the trek out to West San Jose on my day off. The experience was terrible and I won't be going back anytime soon. What used to be a consistent, reliable chain restaurant is now just a mess. First, I was seated at a table with a menu that was missing pages and it was the pages with all of the hamburgers on it. The place was busy and our waitress was slammed, even at 1:45pm on a Tuesday afternoon. When our food finally arrived, it was terrible. The fries were cold and limp. I got the Southern Charm burger that was barely warm and had no flavor. I couldn't taste the bbq sauce or onions on it. There was no ketchup on the table and the waitress didn't come around for another 7 minutes to get more ketchup, take an order for more fries and refill our beverages. It took another 10 minutes for our fries to arrive despite the waitress claiming that all of the ""fryers have been fired."" The interior was not very clean and seemed very worn. It was super noisy even though the restaurant was half empty. Thank goodness our server was a rockstar and hustled. She was the only part of this situation that worked. Everything else was awful.

Marlene B.,"San Jose, CA",177,143,219,1.0,5/30/2017,"Last night we received the worst service/meal ever. I have been to this location a few times in the last year and it keeps going further downhill but I thought one more shot. Well that's it.  - Food took over an hour to come out - once we received food, French fries instead of broccoli was on everyone's plate.  - when broccoli came out it was smaller serving than when you get a refill.  - at that point I asked to speak to manager & she came over. I wasn't looking for a free meal when I came in but I just couldn't take it anymore. After she comped our meal she asked if she could get us anything else. Asked for more broccoli.  - When broccoli arrived I proceeded to eat it & there was a staple in the broccoli.  I don't know ‍ where it came from or how it got there, luckily it didn't cut my gums or anything. I called the manager over again and I told her. I'm just glad the little boy with us didn't eat that piece of broccoli.  Never again.

Ilana V.,"San Jose, CA",17,41,44,3.0,5/21/2017,"I'm sitting here waiting for my burger (it's been about half an hour and I'm hungry) but as I've been here many times before I feel like I can write an honest, although hunger-motivated review.  Started dinner off today by missing our name being called, apparently they ""yelled it three times"" but somehow my late-twenties ears missed these clear and well-enunciated calls. The part that got to me wasn't that they didn't make an effort to find us but that there was absolutely no apology- or anything remotely resembling an apology in response. Once we were re-added to the list, we were brought in fairly quickly. We immediately met our server, Ryan, who has so far been SUPER nice, getting us multiple drink refills and checking in on us frequently. The food here is mediocre, complex flavors and seasoning being replaced by cheese and bacon. The cocktails and alcohol-containing milkshakes contain very little alcohol and a lot of sugar.  So why, you ask, would I choose to come here rather than any of the gourmet burger options offered in the Bay Area? I have a very good reason: the steak fries and freckled lemonade. For someone who mocks the addition of sugar in all of our food, I cannot stop myself from ordering a freckled lemonade. Sometimes (today) they add less sugar and it is slightly sour and delicious. Other times it is diabetes in a cup, but every single time it is exactly what I want. They make it with vodka too but I haven't tried it; why mess with perfection?  Now the steak fries: I'm pretty sure they contain recreational drugs as a seasoning (can I say crack on yelp?) Every few months I CRAVE these amazing bits of salty goodness smothered in ranch dressing (I clearly have a very refined palate) and these fries are the actual reason I will ALWAYS come back to Red Robin.  So if you're looking for a gourmet burger, go somewhere else. But if you're looking for a mediocre meal with the best fries and freckled lemonade ever, come stand in line for a half hour, wait for your food for another 45 minutes, and enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=20

We also just went and were seated underneath an A/C unit. I went to go get reseated and the hostess said there is nothing she can do because there were no tables open. This was not true at all as there were 20 open tables at least! Instead of saying, let me see about that and I am sorry, she was curt and not helpful.

Too much bread compared to chicken. Drinks were pretty good though. All three drinks were nice: TNT, Orange Blitz, and Merry Moscato.

For the last 3-4 years the burgers have been cold or over done and it's taken AT LEAST 40 mins to get a burger out of the kitchen. When I ask where our meal is, after 30 mins usually, these are the frequent excuses: 1) sorry, the kitchen is really busy. 2) the fries are still cooking 3) we are really short on fries and you can only have one basket. 4) oh sorry there are empty tables but the wait is 20 mins because we are short servers.  8-10 other people waiting too. 5) oh sorry its taking so long for your server to come over for the first time, we have a few called in sick. 6) many, many issues that are simple with orders being correct...changing to a ciabbata bun, getting regular bun.  extra onions requested, no onions on burger.  No relish/spread requested, it has it on there!  Plain bacon cheese burger ordered, no bacon on burger!   7) sorry we are training a new cook.  The experienced one quit yesterday!  Seriously no one else knows how to cook a silly burger and fries??!!

Helen W.,"San Jose, CA",279,217,487,1.0,8/15/2016,"I usually don't give 1 star reviews, because I think it is really hard to be that bad, but my visit to Red Robin left me feeling very unhappy. First of all, it is clear that the restaurant is pretty understaffed. There was a decently long wait to be seated, despite available booths, and the process of ordering/getting our food/getting refills took a while too. This is not a deal breaker, and i am okay with waiting. The big problem occurred with the food itself. I ordered the Chicken Bruschetta. It looked perfectly fine when it arrived. If it wasn't for the fact that I was sharing with my sister and had to cut it in half, I would not have noticed the fact that the chicken was HALF RAW. This was no little bit of pinkness, it looked as if they completely failed to cook half the chicken. I just don't know how they could have made such a huge mistake.  After discovering this, because service was so slow, it took a while to wave down our server to get this issue fixed. Our waitress was so apologetic--I don't blame her--but honestly I feel like they should have offered to waive our check for this kind of mistake. Instead, they said they would bring me out a new one--they did, but they brought fries instead of onion rings (which I had ordered). I would've let this pass since I felt bad the waitress was so busy, but honestly they were still making me pay the extra so I was going to get my moneys worth. Furthermore, we asked if it was possible to change the channel on the TV. Not a big deal if they wouldn't do it, but the problem was that they said they would and they never did. Not very happy about that either. In the end, the food was decent, and our waitress did try to make things up for us by being more attentive after the incident. However, I personally believe that there shouldn't have been this problem in the first place. Imagine if I hadn't shared with my sister, I would've just eaten the chicken raw...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=80

Well to be fair, I was pretty hungry too. But it was really good! The chicken stood out to me a lot and the upgraded fries was definitely worth. The fries itself is good too! Even better, you get unlimited refills. Though I don't think you'll really need more than one or two refills because the meal was really filling. The refill took a while to get here but the fries came out hot and crispy. Also tried the House Salad ($4) and Bowl of Clam Chowder ($5).

We spent the next five minutes laughing and deciding who would get to eat the next 4 bites. There was so little dip that we were looking for the hidden camera. Funny. Not $7 funny, but funny.

Another reason why we come here is for their onion ring tower. Red Robins seriously has THE BEST onion rings anywhere! Hands down they are delicious. Huge onions, crispy and perfectly fried in batter, and most importantly, it tastes so fresh! Only $5 for the small tower or $9 for the large. It's so worth it.  All the burgers that we've tried here have been pretty good. The cod fish burger and whiskey river burger are among my favorites. The burgers are huge and they come with bottomless fries. I'm not a huge fan of their thick cut fries so I normally replace it with a salad.  Most of their appetizers are pretty cheap, they have ones ranging from $3 up to $9.. not bad at all! The service has been consistently great. You can order off the little electronic tablets on your table too and even pay for your meal on there which is super convenient if you're in a rush or forgot an order.

Robert C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",516,609,4400,4.0,7/26/2015,"We Asian-Americans are known for being opportunistic.  I'm one of those people who gets as many free or discounted birthday meals as possible- and I only use one birthday, unlike my ex!  Red Robin has two locations near me in Sunnyvale: the Rivermark area in extreme northeast Santa Clara, or the Saratoga area next to the AMC 14. The only other location is in Eastridge mall San Jose..  Neither of these two locations is really close -about 8 miles each way.  And just try going from my house in south central Sunnyvale to either location during rush hour -it may take you half an hour or longer. There are no Red Robins west of Saratoga for 26 miles -in San Mateo! Now that I'm newly retired, I can take advantage of off times to get my free meals.   I was down in Campbell , and made plans to hit Red Robin in Saratoga, with my newly printed out free birthday meal. You can't just get a birthday meal, but have to join the Red Robin e-mail club, and bring along your 16 digit membership number.  Talk about red tape, the 16 digit number is longer than my 9 digit social security number, and 10 digits would cover every man, woman and child on earth.  They purposely make it long so that if you screw up any one of the 16 digits, you miss out on the free birthday burger.   We get there at 435pm on a Monday, park the Prius, and saunter in, me in my shorts, and my   thin, smoky white, cross strap Birki sandals contrasting against my tennis tanned legs.  And I was overdressed, judging from the clothes or lack of clothes the other guests were wearing. We are served promptly, seated at a cozy table for 2 next to the kitchen, with a view of bumper to bumper traffic on Hamilton Ave(?)  through the windows.  Good ambiance, very clean premises, with waiters all over the place, and teenagers out of school for the summer seemingly in every booth.       Have not been to a Red Robins in years, and it takes us 10 minutes to decide what to order.  All burgers come with unlimited fries.  However I'm not a fan of Red Robin's fries, as they are too chunky and lack the taste of the thin fries.   So the wife and I order our burgers with unlimited salads, at the same price. It takes 20 minutes for our orders to be prepared and served, and this is at 445pm.  Come here an hour later and you may as well use smoke signals to call in your meal!  They don't serve the salads with lettuce, cucumbers, and bits of tomatoes, until the  burgers are ready, and then serve it in a small bowl.  If you want those unlimited salads or fries, you are going to have eat it in small chunks, with long wait times between servings. The wife gets the $10 California chicken burger, complete with lettuce, tomato  and guacamole.  I get the $10 Banzai beef burger, with pineapple, lettuce, tomato.   The burger must be 6"" tall.  Nobody can eat that directly with their mouth.  OK, maybe my ex-wife could fit it into her big mouth, as she put her foot in her mouth way too many times. Messy to eat.  We would look like toddlers with food all over our faces!  Now you know why they provide a knife and fork! I love pineapple with my burgers, but this is seemingly the only place I can get them to put pineapple on my burger, except in Hawaii, where they put pineapple at Island burger in Wailea for $11, and the burger there is half the size with no fries .     So I'm in hamburger heaven here, savoring my Banzai Burger piece by piece, going through two salads.   We leave at 525pm, 50 minutes after entering, with the wallet $15 lighter, thanks to a free birthday burger.   A toddler starts screaming in the background.  Good timing, our leaving!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=60

This particular location is right across from Westgate Mall and was busy, but not packed when I arrived with my daughter for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We walk in and see the hostess moving at a snail's pace to get menus and escort a couple to their table. She looked at me and my first thought was, ""Wow, is she in SLOW-MO?."" Literally. She didn't greet us, didn't smile, or even say she'd be with us in a moment, she just blankly looked at us with an open mouth then very slowly turned away and started leisurely walking away. Even the couple following her to their table looked at each other befuddled at her sloth-like pace. Fortunately, at that moment another gentleman (likely a server) saw me with my jaw on the floor and said, ""Oh sorry, let me help you get seated, table for 2?"" So glad someone else came to seat us, or else we could have possibly been waiting quite some time for the hostess to slowly come back. We sat down and ordered our food.

I asked what type of dipping sauce they had. The waiter said ""we have a lot."" He brought out two salad dressings and two other sauces. I asked for the Chipotle sauce but it would cost 75 cents. That's more expensive than McDonald's!! All times are estimates... except the time the food came out is accurate as I was starving. I was constantly checking the time as I could not believe how long it was taking for the food to come out. Overall, the lack of service and the cold food has solidified the fact that I will not be returning. I wanted to give it another shot only because the place is a 2 minute drive from my house. I left feeling so disappointed and had wished that I had gone to Umami burger where the burgers are half the size, but 100% more satisfying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=60

I couldn't finish it, it was that bad. The fries were very greasy and not very garlicky. The worst was my wife's Caesar salad.

The kitchen is not busy and we have been watching all of the servers receive massages from a creepy server that wears glasses and just standing around while there is food in the window. I used to work at Red Robin myself for years and the service we have been getting is intolerable. We asked our server multiple times for things we needed and never received  it until we were almost done eating. First, our order was wrong and mistakes happen but when I ask for something that was missing in my burger it shouldn't take 20 minutes to get onion slices. Also, we asked for a refill of fries and I had to ask twice and they were not even the garlic fries we ordered. This is such a disgrace for what Red Robin is suppose to represent. As I am eating I don't want to see a creepy two eyed weirdo massage multiple girls on the line. Seriously so gross. If people have cold food it's because servers are too busy not doing their job. This is the worst Red Robin ever. If I could leave no stars I would do so. It's not just our tables order that was wrong but the tAble next to ours was incorrect and they look irritated. I would like to add if there is food in the window you need to run it out!!!! Management you need to crack down and make sure people are doing their jobs correctly unless you are getting a massage from the creepy server on which that can be sexual harassment.

David A.,"San Jose, CA",1,2,,3.0,11/3/2016,This is probably the worst place to eat in the area.The burgers are good enough but it really lacks in customer service. So as you come in they always are going to tell you the wait is over 15 minutes even if there are 10 empty tables in plain view.Then you proceed to sit in the waiting area and you feel like your in that in the scene from Beetlejuice when they are sitting in the afterlife lounge and all those weird people are around them(which isn't Red Robin's fault of having that clientele it's just the area). Your then seated and ignored for another 15 minutes as the crew walks by you multiple times looking but not making eye contact as if amongst themselves they are deciding who is going to get stuck with you.Its like when your in school and your picking teams for a sport and it's down to you and the other kid who is not really good and they just settle for you.If your privileged enough to be served high five yourself!!! I ordered a drink an chips and they proceeded to bring me my drink promptly and a fancy bowl sculpture with about 5 chips on it.I then played trivia on the little tablet thing and like always looked around the restaurant to see if I could recognize who I was destroying in movie trivia.My burger arrived and it was good but kinda tiny(oh well it was good so I can't complain). Then I asked for a refill of my bottomless fries after I devoured my plate of 7 fries and they proceeded to bring me out another plate of 4 fries in another fancy sculpture bowl.Nice try Red Robin!!!distracting me with a fancy bowl.Why do they advertise bottomless fries and then they hoard their fries like a leprechaun and his pot of gold?

Marlina M.,"San Jose, CA",1,8,,2.0,10/17/2016,"So Red Robin is not by any means a 'new' dining experience for me, and probably most of us out there, as it is not a new restaurant. What is new to me is the overall decline of customer service that has been sadly occurring in many like places (Buffalo Wild Wings, Mimis, Chilis, etc). My review is not about the food, because the food here is greasy good - so good in fact that after three consecutive bad trips I still have voted to go back for the promise of endless seasoned steak fries.  But lets talk about that for a minute - lets talk about the 'bottomless fries' premise. Now I don't know about you but when I hear the catch phrase 'bottomless fries' I am pretty excited and really do think I am about to do some real potato damage. The best part of that aside from the taste, is the fact that it is going to not only be an endorsed process but one that is facilitated with speed and ease for my consumption pleasure. But bottomless fry seekers beware....such is not the case. Red Robin has actually found the ingenious formula of attracting customers with the sly fry claim while gently folding in some basic satiating know-how. What ever you had in mind about bottomless fries let me tell you what actually happens. Your burger will arrive to the table with your first side of fries that is usually served in a little tea cup size metal 'holder' meant to jazz up the presentation and keep the fry portion to a minimum. Keep in mind these are steak fries so they take up some room. All said and done, you get a burger with roughly the amount of fries it takes to fill up a toddler. Then your server walks away leaving you fry-less by burger bite 4 and you are in your mind thinking ""Its ok that she hasn't came back yet and Im almost done eating - they are bottomless"". Minutes will start to overlap and you are now fully done with your burger and your drink is gone (long gone if you have a man that drinks like mine does) in desperate need of a refill. Finally just before you contemplate asking another waitress if you can get help your server will return and you will ask for more fries. Five minutes later they will return with a wire basket containing 10 fries all laid out flat on the serving basket to give the appearance of being full. Now if something is such a big selling point for you, like oh I dont know.....fries, then wouldn't you have a whole lot of fry action going on in the kitchen? My point is that even with the initial disappearance of your server once you do ask for the fries shouldn't they be there in way less than 5 min? Enter the trickery of the fry catch. By intentionally making you wait for the fries by spacing out the arrival of the fries one of two things is going to happen. One, your stomach will cue the brain that the parties over and you are full or two you are just going to get tired of waiting for fries in increments of 10. And just like that they have served you one or two servings of fries, making good on that bottomless promise.  But that was a rant and not even what this review is about - ok so basically here it is quickly. The service is just plain bad. Your server really does disappear on you and often your needs are just not met. On Saturday we went in early at about 5pm and were seated within about 5 min. We then sat at our table for about 17 min watching employees walk around, make small talk by the drink machine and seat other guests who had their beverages on the table within minutes. My husband wanted to go but I wanted to see who was actually supposed to be our server. Low and behold it was someone that walked by us countless times. Now I understand  being busy, so much so that the simple ""I'll be right with you"" would have shut  me up but over 10 min? I mean come on. So our server finally approaches and I just asked if I could talk to the manager. I know - I have become that person lol.....anyways she walks away, goes up to the manager and I see her laughing a little with him cause you know, that's always cool to do, and then he comes to the table. I told him what happened and that we were just going to leave but that he should be aware of what is happening on his watch - not that he seemed to care much. He then tells me to wait a minute because he wanted to give me a coupon for 'next time'. He then comes back with two 'Free $3 or $5 appetizer coupons' which was nice of him but basically means I can get fried jalapeno coins or the chips & salsa, and if you have ever had those here can probably agree should be free as it is so.....yeah. It was just a bummer all around having to get my newborn (not the easiest task) and go to a different place.  Case in point: If you want a burger really bad that is not from a drive through, have extra time, no kids, like being ignored and don't really like fries this place will work for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=100

First of all the hostess told me that it was a 15 minute wait for a part of two. 40 minutes later my sister and I were finally seated.  Then it once we ordered, it was another hour wait for our burgers. When I finally received my guacamole burger I was devastated when there was the tiniest smear of guacamole on my burger. I couldn't even taste the guacamole or even see it on my burger. Consequently my burger had no flavor.  When I asked for a refill in my bottomless fries it took another half hour to refill them. What is the point of saying bottomless fries if they are going to take forever. I was still waiting for my fries when everyone had finished their food. Finally my fries came and they were okay.  Before I even left the restaurant I had to run to the bathroom. I had gotten good poisoning! I don't have other digestive issues so I know that it was because of the food I had just eaten.  Finally after two hours of mostly waiting and paying to be being poisoned I will not be back to Red Robin ever again. I can cook better burgers at home in a half hour for half the price that won't make me sick.

Kristen I.,"San Jose, CA",72,210,1,3.0,1/31/2016,"Pros first: The food was great. I had a cheeseburger and my dad had a hickory burger. I got the onion rings with uncharge instead of bottomless fries, because the onion rings are stupendous. My 3 year old enjoyed picking her entree, side, and beverage from the extensive kids menu, and I enjoyed that this menu was available for $5 and under.  Cons: My dad ordered a side caesar and he got a regular side salad. The silverware was dirty. We had to ask for silverware and napkins. We had to ask for drink refills. It took 20 minutes to place our drink orders, another 15 to place our meal orders, and yet another 10 for my daughter's milk to come out. That's 45 minutes from arrival, 25 minutes from order, for a 3 year old's milk to arrive. Not exactly stellar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=120
Michelle D.,"Campbell, CA",355,398,1021,4.0,2/3/2014,"The El Paseo Red Robin is my favorite location with its great service. Plus, who doesn't love the endless fries? I was surprised to find this location very busy on a Saturday night at 5.  It was filled with families with small children; I guess a 5 PM dinner time for families with toddlers is the equivalent to a 7 PM dinner for adults.  We had to wait for 20 minutes but it was nice that they texted us when the table was ready. When we were seated, we were greeted by a nice waitress who served us our waters quickly.  We took a while to decide what we wanted but she was very patient and checked up on us without being pushy.   I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ burger and it was pretty good considering I am not a Red Robin fan.  The burger was nicely cooked and the toppings were not overwhelming.  I would expect a BBQ burger to be dripping with barbecue sauce but it was not overwhelming.  The crispy onion straws on the burger were a nice touch and every other bite I would crunch on a piece of bacon.  The bun however, was not toasted to my liking (or at all really) as well as everyone else's buns.  I guess they don't toast their buns or they were really busy that day... My big problem with Red Robin is their ""endless"" fries are usually not endless and floppy.  Our waitress asked if we wanted more fries but I was satisfied with the fries I had.  The manager also came by and asked if we were satisfied with our meals, which we appreciated.  The steak fries were also very crispy!  Not one was soggy, which made me very happy.  The fries were tasty AND they were actually endless. Overall, I was pleased by my dining experience.  The service was great and the food was good.  I still prefer the Island chain to RR, but I am starting to reconsider after that Whiskey burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=120

Kevin C.,"San Jose, CA",98,264,114,4.0,9/16/2015,"I was first introduced to the Red Robin chain when I was in college.  For a student on a budget, it really checked all the boxes: - free refills on fries - free refills on drinks - reward program (buy 9 entrees, get 1 free) ... Okay, maybe there weren't very many boxes back when my metabolism was faster and my wallet was lighter. More than a decade later, it's still a decent sit-down spot for a diet-busting burger meal.  (I don't dare look at the nutrition facts here.)  The decor got updated a few years ago, and the new chairs are an improvement. The burgers are pretty good: cooked to order, juicy, and piled high.  The Whiskey River BBQ burger is one of our favorites, featuring fried onion strings and barbecue sauce.  The guacamole bacon burger is a self-explanatory classic.  These come with bottomless steak fries (try RR's salty spice mix on them) and run about $10 each. Red Robin now also features a ""Tavern Double"" line of small double cheeseburgers (about $8 each) and a higher-end line of signature burgers on ciabatta buns (about $14 each).  These likewise let you refill fries ad infinitum. The ""freckled"" strawberry lemonade is a popular choice that's been around for years.  The newer ""poppin' purple"" prickly pear lemonade is even sweeter.  These come with free refills, so it's no big surprise that they check in around $4.50 each.  (It would be nice if the beverage menu listed the prices though.) The guest service experience can vary pretty wildly.  On our latest visit, our server Katelynne did an outstanding job and made sure we had everything we needed.  Prompt drink refills, piping-hot fry refills, the works.  She even checked whether we could combine the ""Tavern Double Tuesday"" special with a free birthday burger offer.  Really impressive service, considering she was flying around to cover many tables. On the flip side of things, in that same visit we saw vacated tables neglected for a long time before being bussed.  It honestly seems like the busboys here don't try very hard.  You'd think RR doesn't employ any busboys, but once in a great while they'll come by and bus a table... Food:  4 stars Value:  3 stars, depends a bit on how many fry refills you down Service:  3.5 stars, can be hit-or-miss (5 stars for Katelynne) Overall:  3.5 stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=160

I came here pretty late at night with my boyfriend (9:30PM), so there was no wait and not many people inside. We were seated, and our waiter brought out the menus for us. We were ready to order but our order wasn't taken for at least 10 minutes. We had to call another waiter over to take our order because we had no idea where our initial waiter was.  When my burger came out, I saw that it did not come with many of the ingredients that were listed on the menu. I thought they had given me the wrong item, so I called our waiter over and asked him if it was the right burger. He told me it was, but I knew it was missing some avocados among other things like jalapenos. He brought over a menu and realized that my burger was indeed missing some essential ingredients from it. A few minutes later, he brought back a plate with a few avocado slices and some jalapeno pieces on it.  What a disappointing experience! Not the best service from this place.

Jesus C.,"San Jose, CA",393,258,377,4.0,12/31/2012,"I hadn't been to this Red Robin a while and felt like having something extra fatty this night. As we pulled up we noticed that their sign out front was different and looked nothing like the old one. We didn't think too much of it and just went in. To our surprise they had remodeled the whole restaurant. The waitress said they were trying to get away from the Chuck E Cheese feel. The Food: The food is always great but this time it seemed extra tasty and not as greasy. I don't think they changed the menu items but it tasted a bit better than before. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger which I always order when I go here. I did notice that the bacon seemed to be of better quality than before. Not only that but I received three strips of bacon vs. the two that they normally give out. I got my burger on a wheat bun with American cheese. They waitress did ask how I wanted my burger cooked, some pink or cooked all the way through. I like it juicy so I went with some pink and I'm not sure if they gave you this option before. The hot date got a Chicken Caesar wrap which she said it also tasted good.  The Staff: The staff was nice as always. I did notice that they stopped wearing jeans like before. It's a little dressy and it looks nice, so long as they feel comfortable in their attire. The waitress came around a few times to make sure everything is ok. The only thing that sucks was that we did not get offered drinks or a refill on fries before the check was brought out. It's not like I was hungry after the meal, but it would have been nice if we were offered.  The Restaurant: As I said above, they remodeled the whole place. The layout was similar as before. The bar on the same side and the restrooms are located in the same spot too. They changed up the booths and made everything nicer. They moved the TV's around and added new pictures and frames. They even had framed pictures on the ceiling (dangerous, would not want to sit there) which looked cool! When you put your name on the wait list they take it down on a note pad and they actually text you when your table is ready. This is cool because you can go and wait in your car if the waiting area is too full. Am I going back?!?

I ordered the Bleu Burger to go, which featured a delicious medium cooked patty with deep fried onions, tomato, lettuce, and cheese sandwiched between two onion-flavored buns. The quality of the meat patty was absolutely superb - juicy, flavorful, and melt-in-your-mouth fantastic and definitely so much better than I anticipated from a burger chain. I would definitely recommend this burger for first-timers! The price of the burgers here are a little bit on the higher end ($8 and up), but it's definitely worth every buck when you taste how good they are. Also, your burger comes with a side of fries of your choice, ranging from steakcut fries to sweet potato fries to garlic fries. I'm always a fan of sweet potato fries, and they are definitely delicious here as well. Love Red Robin and cannot wait till my next visit! P.S.

The last three times I've eaten here, my burger and the fries has been brought to me cold to luke warm. Three different visits spread out over about two years and three cold meals. It was obvious that the burgers were made and left on the counter for a long while before being brought to the table. They offered to remake them for me and once I accepted, but it too came out cold. There's no reason that a burger at a place like this shouldn't be brought to the table still steaming hot. And my last visit a week ago actually included at least one raw potato in the fries. Remaking my burger ensures that I'm not eating with my family or friends and that they're waiting for me, so I usually decline and at least they have been nice enough to take the burger off my order.

First of all...parking here is HORRIBLE (thanks to the theatre) and wait times here are HORRIBLE (you can guess why...thanks to the theatre). The bar area here is super tiny, and the restaurant has a very odd, narrow lay out. The main dining room you get a view of the kitchen (which is SUPER loud btw). Putting all that aside, one thing Red Robin does is try to make dinner a good value. They have all sorts of cheap appetizers and most burgers are around $10 with bottomless fries. Quality isn't as good as before, but for the price you're paying, it's not a bad deal! I stick with the Royal Red Robin or Whiskey River BBQ burgers and they are usually done well! They have a bunch of dipping sauces which are good too.  Fair prices on drinks, but they aren't very generous on pours. Well drinks come in taller pint-style glasses, so you end up with a standard serving with 90% mixer. My vodka lemonade was so watered down, I complained to the manager who admitted that she has to order a double. She was nice enough to comp the drinks and give us a free speciality cocktail on the house, but I won't be drinking here anymore...unless it's a beer or something! Overall, it's too much of a hassle!

Till now when I am writing this post, I still have very upset intestine. And I think it entered my milk too cuz my 4 month old EBF baby also fuzzed and cried the whole evening last night and had mild diarrhea today. Poor baby.  Besides the food poisoning I am complaining, their service is bad too, they have a lot of empty tables, but they make us waited 30 mins to be seated, and they assigned us a table just right next to the restrooms. They didn't even consider that the table is poor to a family with a little baby. Food served very slowly.

My stepdad uses a walker as she could clearly see and when she asked us if we wanted s booth I asked for a table.

Alison ..,"Santa Clara, CA",5,162,6,2.0,9/14/2016,"I'm disappointed with this location.  Seeing my older review from 2014 on Yelp was actually helpful, a good reminder of that experience shows the place is hit or miss.  This place isn't always the best choice. Mediocre is the right label. My husband and I have gone to this location on numerous visits, but, the next time we want Red Robin, it will have to be the Rivermark location. The next time I'm near Westgate, I'll strongly consider other dining options. Our visit was tonight- Wednesday, Sept. 14th at 8:00.  We were seated in the coldest area of the restaurant- the central area near the window.  I asked if we could relocate- We normally sit near the bar, during afternoon hours.  When our waitperson (Jessica) asked what we wanted, my husband suggested that I needed a jacket. Jessica tells me the manager is busy in the kitchen, but will get to it when they get the chance.  It would have been nice if this mythical manager actually stopped by and acknowledged that there was a problem.  Our food came, and the fries were cold with my Arctic Cod burger.  My husband ordered fish and chips- the fish was soggy, and the four small pieces were buried in his cold fries.   Food would be classified as warm, but not hot.  Service was not stellar-it was okay, but, we only saw our server when she took our order and brought the food to the table.  We were near a semi-large group. It really wasn't that busy.  There were three people working at the maitre'd station, mostly having a conversation amongst themselves. It took awhile to get a refill on the drinks, and the replacement for the cold fries only came AFTER we finished our meals.  Same for drink refills. As far as observations on restaurant cleanliness, I noticed the tables outside that needed to be bussed when we came in, still needed attention as we were leaving.   As far as sitting at that cold table, I don't understand why we had to sit at that specific table other than the fact that table was in the zone for that waitperson. That situation could have been resolved in a personable fashion over the excuse of ""We'll get to it when we can"".   My guess is that the system cannot be adjusted.  My problem with this place is that I've had better experiences at this location.   Much better.  Enough that I normally ignore that the value of the food is overpriced for what is received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=140
Natalie ?.,"San Jose, CA",8,39,2,3.0,10/17/2015,"Red robin is a new discovery in our house. Yes, I know - a little late to the party. They have great burgers here. The apps are also great. The fish and chips lack the oomph than other places. The breading doesn't stay on the fish which is very frustrating. The prices are very good also - let's be honest that is hard to find in this area. The reason this place does does not warrant five stars is the service. Last two times I went to Red Robin I saw my server twice. Once to take my orders and the next to pay. The food was delivered by an expediter not our server.  Whenever I go there I am convinced the reason they have bottomless fries is because there is no way possible for you to get more than one order.

My husband ordered his burger medium well done, so they did not have to wait for the burger to be fully cooked.  The one star is for the service, not the food.  We didn't get a chance to taste our food this time around.  The waiter could have come by to explain they are busy or food is almost ready, he didn't.  We left without him noticing, we did get a thank you on the way out by the hostess.   We ended up going to Carl's Jr.  The Carl's Jr. On Saratoga, where there is one lady taking the order, and making the food-- we got our order in 5 minutes, with a hello and a goodbye. AND a thank you.  IDK if I want to go back to this Red Robin location. Might just have to haul my cookies all the way over to the east side, next time I'm able to go on a date w my hubby.  So sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=200
Pauline M.,"San Jose, CA",29,12,1,3.0,10/16/2015,"Half way decent restaurant. The three stars is mostly for their onion rings and malt milk shakes, everything else about Red Robin is ""meh"". The burger I ordered was lacking quite a bit in flavor, the cheese was hardly melted on top, and it was served lukewarm. The service is incredibly slow here. It was a bit crowded so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, but it felt like we were waiting an eternity for our food to come.

It was almost as if they were purposely trying to do bad, hoping they would get enough media attention from Gordon Ramsay to have a ""Kitchen Nightmare"" transformation.

Tim Y.,Silicon Valley,53,715,4224,5.0,8/19/2012,One of my favorite places for a delicious juicy burger! This is my favorite location. My usually is their Royal Red Robin burger which consists of bacon and a fried egg. I always ask for extra crispy bacon and this is the only location that really makes it extra crispy. The garlic fries are amazing especially if they are straight out of the fryer.  Don't forget to signup/register for a Red Robin card. Get a free free burger after purchasing 9. I think you also get a free appetizer on your first use (verify that this hasn't changed). You also get a free birthday burger in your birthday month. The kids menu has plenty of choices for a reasonable price. The balloon at the end of the meal is always a treat for my son.

After complaining, manager brought the soup and tells me ""we will remove it off your bill"". Burgers taste just ok. Nothing special. In'n'out have tastier burgers now.

I am very aggravated and disappointed with the service my mother and I received when we first walked in to put our names down. My mother got a very rude response from EVAN in the front saying ""Well this is America"". Once I heard that, I was already taken by surprise by his sarcastic comment to my mother. I knew after that this might not go well. As I caught Evan glaring looks at my mother and I. Laughing and smirking to himself. As we got called up within 4 minutes of putting our names down. He asked my mother if we needed a kids menu while he looked at me straight in the eyes. He definitely tried to antagonize and provoke me. After that, I was beyond livid. Sadly he didn't have a name tag, but thankfully before I even followed I asked a manager his name. I am very upset and I definitely want something taken care of because of this. I will not be recommending this place because of his service. Everything starts with the people in the front, if you provide great customer service you'll be a lot more successful.

But since the latest remodel, unless we just had a string of bad luck in our visits,  either the management has changed or something fundamental shifted but this is a place that needs serious help.  Service quality is seriously diminished.  Certainly there are some good people working there, but errors in orders and long waits for food shouldn't be the norm.  Food quality and presentation has also slipped.  It isn't the same experience at all. We keep telling ourselves we'll never go back, but tonight, after watching a movie at the AMC, we decided to give it another chance for dessert, and arrived to no hostess at the front station at all (waited for five minutes and even asked staff if anyone was available to no avail).  We had to leave knowing we would be stuck in there for a VERY long time.  The only folks waiting aside from us was a family who walked out with us complaining they had sat there for 30 minutes looking at a number of empty tables filled with uncleared dishes that were not being tended to. The place was a mess.    Red Robin is a repeatable concept.  It is a successful franchise. It has an established system that should be easy for any conscious manager to sustain.  I have no idea why this place has tanked, but it needs to wake up and get the fix it needs.  We'll come back when it decides to be a restaurant that cares about its customers again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=220

As for the food itself, this Red Robin, like other locations, has gotten a bit more modern in its decor.   My most recent experience here was my to-go order on the last day to redeem my birthday burger.  I was seated at the bar and I was amused to see how they arranged their hard liquor bottles on their shelves.  Some of their bottles were literally way out of reach for their bartenders...one of them even had to get a stool just to reach a bottle of Jameson!   Otherwise, a decently adequate Red Robin for your burgers and unlimited fries fix.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=220

Savannah J.,"San Jose, CA",17,32,10,1.0,7/1/2014,"My friends and I used to come here a lot, but the last 3 times we have been here it's been absolutely terrible.  The wait for food is just ridiculous. 40+ minutes just to get a chicken sandwiches for 3/4 people?  None of the servers we had we attentive or offered anything while we waited. The drinks took forever to get, the refills took even longer.  Hint: when you want the server to bring something extra (like extra barbecue or campfire sauce) tell them BEFORE you get your food. We made the sad mistake of asking when we got our food initially and didn't get what we asked for until we were finished.  The last time we went, our server gave me the wrong food but I decided to eat it anyways because it took 45 minutes to get it and I was starving. The manager on duty took it off our bill, thankfully.  We had to talk to the manager twice and was offered a discount on our overall bill, but because we asked for separate checks, the discount was taken off. Our server (the last time we went) told us that our discount would be taken off if we got separate checks, but she could find the manager and have him apply the discount to each check and that it would just take a little longer. Since we were there for 2 hours anyway, what's another few minutes? She came back 10 minutes later with our bills.... And no discount.  Just absolutely the worst service I've ever had 3 times in a row at the same place, different servers. Train your servers to be more customer friendly, or hire a new staff.  It would be wise of this location to offer fries (more than one basket for 4 people) while waiting 45 minutes for their food.

Christina L.,"Palo Alto, CA",71,134,350,2.0,6/24/2014,"Three visits over the last year, and all I can say is: Don't bother going out of your way for this one. If you do, don't come hungry, and expect to wait.  The decor is disjunct, the wait is interminable, the food is mediocre, and the bathrooms are smelly. If you sit in a booth by the far wall, there's even a draft coming through the bottom of the window frame.  Our wait time for a table was quoted at 20 minutes, but ended up being closer to 30. Their handy app showed our place on the list. Once seated, however, it was another waiting game. We ordered a mud pie and some drinks to pass the time before our burgers arrived. We waited 10 minutes for the pie/drinks, and then 30 minutes for our burgers. Good thing we weren't starving! Our server Jeff hustled like crazy to serve us, apologizing for the wait, and attentively checking in. His hustle was to no avail, though, as the kitchen seemed to be moving at glacial speed. We could see that the few orders that were partially made sat under heat lamps for several minutes, awaiting last parts/ingredients before runners/servers brought them out. All the employees looked frazzled and exhausted. What a mess.  There were empty two-top tables over by the bar that could have been filled. Large parties often take up many tables and sit for long periods of time. This creates a backup for smaller dining groups. These could have easily been arranged into those bar tables.  I always look forward to the bottomless fries. Today, though, they were soggy and mushy. I didn't even finish the ones on my plate. My tavern double burger came lopsided, with tomatoes arranged on one side of my burger. It was greasy and ooey with cheese, but only served to remind me that Five Guys would have been a similar, cheaper, and faster meal.

He would bounce around nearby tables, but would somehow manage to skip our table numerous times when we needed service. The restaurant was initially packed, but the service speed did not pick up after the crowds cleared out. We started with the giant onion ring tower as appetizer. It was delicious and crunchy (and the probably best part of the meal). I loved the dipping sauces, especially the BBQ one. For entrees, we ordered the Ensenada Chicken Platter and the Whiskey River BBQ Wrap. The chicken was rather dry and bland. It had the exquisite taste and texture of cardboard paper. The BBQ Wrap was about the same. It makes me wonder whether Red Robin microwaves their food like Applebee's. The Cookie Magic shake was noticeably better than McDonald's Oreo McFlurry. (Apples to apples right?) However, its signature monster size has gone on a diet and is much smaller than I remember it during college. Was quite disappointed when I finished it a third of the way into the meal. The clam chowder soup was quite good and about the same quality as the ones I get from Safeway. I recommend it. On the other hand, the French Onion soup (which is supposed to contain sweet caramelized onions) was the saltiest I've ever tasted. I imagine the chef accidentally dumped half a cup of salt into it. No one at our table wanted to finish it. Overall, the food and service were quite subpar.

Both times I had called ahead to put my name down because I had the Red Robin Royalty Card.  Let me start with Thursday, January 22. We got to the restaurant, checked in, and immediately got seated. We got a few bad stares because their were people waiting, it looked like I just walked in, and got seated right away. Service was great and quick. I ordered the Fish and Chips, and it was done well (crispy). Our waiter was very attentive, and making sure everything was fine.  We went again with my family and friends on Sunday, January 25th, and once again called ahead of time using my Red Robin Royalty Card. We waited a little bit, but we were seated pretty fast. Now service was way slower. It took like 15 minutes to get our drinks, and when we ordered our food it took almost an 1 hour to get. I ordered the Fish and Cod, and it was ""soggy"". I didn't want to send it back because I didn't know how long it was going to take, since we already waited an hour to eat. My mom ordered the same thing, and her's was just as soggy as mine. They messed up on my friend's order, and had to send it back. I know it wasn't just our table because the table next to us sent their food back several times due to mistakes. My dad ordered beer also, it took ordering it 3 times to finally get it, and drink refills also took a long time also. I've been to this Red Robin several times, and never see service this bad.

Her name is Katelynne He... I get it, everyone has bad days, but to not take care of a customers because they screwed up on your order, doesn't help anyone. First it takes over 30 minutes to get my beer and 2 milk shakes. Then another 30 minutes to receive our burgers, to only find out that my order (Royal Red Robin) was screwed up. Egg Over hard was requested and I received Sunnyside up. Fine, no problem, its a mistake, I sucked it up and waited 20 minutes to have an egg cooked. 20 MINUTES TO HAVE ONE EGG COOKED OVER HARD!!! Wtf!! All of this while Katelynne is next door chopping away while I flagged her down to check on my burger. She clearly knew my order was screwed up because she only came by to ask where my burger was previously. But with no sense of urgency taking care of the situation, she said she was tired from being up at 6am. Ok, I guess it's ok to not do your job because you're tired.  When the burger came out, I dig in to my burger to only find out that the *ucken 20 min egg that was being cooked, cooked for literally 20 min on the grill. Bit into the burger and what do I bite into? This Caramelized, plastic texture that was from the egg. Ok, at this point, not cool. I waited over an hour just to get this burger that was not up to standard. Not only that, but I tell Katelynne, our server..... Her response, ""ok"".. and walked away.  I work in the food industry and I know what standards are and what they are all about. Her standard is no where near Red Robin's standard. She should've taken care of the situation right then and there, but had us wait another 15 minutes to flag down someone else to get the manager over. And of course, she took care of the problem.

When there is a wait, they have a system that sends you a text when your table is ready and also allows you to see how many people are in front of you all from your own smartphone.

The food was very good, but did take a little too long to come out.  Clam chowder 4/5: came out quickly, was almost lukewarm, but tasted very good and had a lot of clams  Fish and Chips 4/5: took a little too long to come out, but was very moist and seasoned nicely Bacon burger 5/5: again took a little too long to come out, but was a very tasty and moist burger (definitely worth the wait), came with decent fries Overall, my first time at Red Robin was better than average. We only had to wait 2-3 minutes until we were seated and our friendly waitress came and checked on us quite often.

On December 30th at 7 p.m. I visited Red Robin with family and I ordered a Bonsai Burger.  When it arrived, I called the waiter over to ask whether my burger is supposed to be a turkey burger, since I didn't have a menu in front of me and I thought I had ordered a beef burger.  He told me ""Absolutely not, I'll send it back.""  What he then came back with was a burger whose meat was so burned it was actually nothing but a charcoal disk.  Again I showed it to the waiter and his face looked shocked and he said ""Oh that is really burned.""  At the moment that he returned with a third burger I asked for a to-go box since everyone at my table had finished eating. At home, opening the to-go box I couldn't help but want to inspect the burger and this photo is what I found. Shocking!!

My mother went with the Patty melt with Thousand Island dressing on a bun. 28 minutes later our food was served in the tiniest portions. Mine was one burger, NOT two, with ""mixed fruit"" of mandarin slice, (ya know the one in the can), squishy strawberries and about 1/4 of a cup worth. My burger was definitely kid size at $8.49 price. For 50 cents more I could have gotten a normal size one.... My mothers was a joke.

The grilled chicken was nice and tender too.

She just looked down and with a very passive aggressive demeanor told us the wait time. We took open bar seating since we just planned on getting a drink and some fries. Our waitress comes over with water for two of us, and says she'll be back with one more for our other diner.  So 15 minutes later there's no sign of her and we don't have a lot of time.  We spot a guy in a blue dress shirt by the bar, and naturally assume he's the manager. We wave him over and tell him our orders haven't been taken yet. He just shrugs us off and says our waitress would be right with us. Great,  thanks. She finally shows up and takes our orders.  We get our appetizers a short while later but no drinks. We finish our food and still no drinks. We look over at the bar tender who looks genuinely bewildered. She's pouring beers for people at the bar and standing around with a confused look on her face. We flag down our waitress and ask about the drinks.  She goes to the bar and asks the woman behind the counter then walks away.  They finally come. Mines got a tiny piece of ice floating in it, with a big clump of salt stuck to the side of the glass.

We sit and order our daughters food first so it comes out first then our drinks and later on our food. The food comes out not too long after and after a bit later of sitting my daughters macaroni and cheese comes out, apparently it takes longer to cook a tiny cup of Kraft macaroni than it does to make three hamburgers. Speaking of food, I thought my ""pig out"" burger was pretty gross, the meat like warm and soggy, cheap sliced government looking cheese, soggy bland bacon, the whole thing was mushy, bland and just disappointing, we used to live across from another red robin and their burgers were always hot, juicy yet crisp enough to have some bite to it, they were definitely two hand premium burgers, this was like a crappy old Burger King burger, I would almost prefer a good Big Mac or whopper over this, so I didn't finish it, the fries were a mix of decent fresh crunchy fries and old cold soggy fries,my daughters Mac and cheese was watery and bland (definitely in a whole class or two under elephant bar's) I never got a single refill of my drink, neither did any of my group, we did get a single refill of fries, but he offered to put them in right after we just got served and they didn't come out until we were receiving dessert. one of my biggest complaints from last time was the fact that they put those dumb terminals on each table trying to sucker people out of money for free cell phone games, it makes the waiters lazy and never come around, even to collect your money, it's like ""you done?

I was going to smash burger but I wanted it to be a little more special than just a regular fast food store. We didnt wait for long until we were finally seated. I felt really good having my 2 little brothers with me in the same table. I was asking them how their school was and such. Food was good, my server was very nice too. When we were done eating our meal, I have paid using their tablet and left some tip, walked out then came right back in because I have forgotten my phone. I came back, the reception didnt have my phone so she had to look for my server. When my server came he handed me my phone and underneath it was the tip I had given him, he says ""Heres your money, I dont need it"" turned his head around mugging me. Now what seems to be the problem is that, am i being judged as a person by how much i tip'd? Am I a bad person for not being able to galantly tip like the rich folks do? I mean my sallary is not that great also, Im barely able to get by with what Im getting. I took my brothers to eat despite having a budget, i havent even paid for some of my bills yet, and yet I was made to feel sad just for not tipping him the amount his expecting. I dont think im a cheap person, sometimes when i see homeless people i give them money, or when there is boy scouts/girl scouts I buy their goodies, and sometimes when I can, i treat my family out for dinner. What am i getting at here is that I did not appreciate what my server did, I do hope he's not doing that to any other customers, Im not the type to say fire the guy since we all are in need of a job, but what he did was wrong, and hurtful. Im a nurse and customer service is a must in my profession, receiving gifts, tips or any such is not acceptable. As a nurse we get cursed at, yelled at, and sue'd, or even get our license revoke in worst case scenario, but we still smile because at the end of the day at least were making every person we care for cared for.  I will not be coming back to any other Red Robins Restaurant after this experience. It wasnt a very pleasant experience. Edit: Food was great, my brothers had a fun time. They thanked me for the treat right when I dropped them home. That is very fulfilling to me, as long as my brothers had a good dinner, it is all I could ask. As for me, the server left a bad taste in my mouth.

Sara B.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,22,2.0,10/18/2014,"""Doggie entitlement mentality"" runs rampant around here.  We realize that.  California realizes it too, so this summer the governor signed a law that allows pet owners to bring their pets along to a restaurant as long as they remain on the patio.  It is still illegal to bring any animal inside a restaurant, unless it is a service animal. So imagine our surprise and dismay when we went to this Red Robin location a couple of nights ago and were seated in the dining room, only to discover that a woman at the table next to us had her smallish (Pomeranian?) dog under the table.  She had even put two little dishes (one filled with dog food and one with water) on the floor under the table, so this little prince (or princess?) could have its meal, too, though this did not stop the little creature from continually begging for scraps (which were occasionally given...yuck), nor from stepping in its water dish a few times as it wandered around beneath the table.  This was clearly a pampered family pet, not any kind of service animal.  WHAT was it doing in a restaurant? I should mention that the outside temperature that evening was very mild.  It would have been entirely comfortable for this lady and her doggie to sit on the patio and LEGALLY enjoy their meal.  It would even have been perfectly fine for her to leave her precious pet in the car for an hour or so...it was NOT hot and would not have posed any danger to the animal. Allowing people to bring their pets into a restaurant is just irresponsible and cowardly behavior by the restaurant's team and management.  I realize that people in this area can get pretty worked up if they are told that their precious pets cannot go everywhere and do everything that humans do...but that's just tough.  Managers can and should stand up to them and uphold the law for the benefit, health, and enjoyment of the other restaurant guests!  If a guest really believes that their dog should be treated like family, then they should either eat on the patio where their pets are legally allowed, or stay home and eat at the family (and dog) table!

The longish wait for a booth was expected, and about a dozen people were in the lobby. We waited perhaps twenty minutes. Not too bad. The booth was in the bar area. The wait person, Juan, was not friendly or engaged. Our drink order took a long time (perhaps another ten minutes), he said the bar was backed up; but we watched the bar tender casually washing and wiping glassware, yet still promptly serving customers on the bar stools. One drink came first, then Juan took our food order. Right out of the menu book, nothing complex. After a reminder, the second drink arrived.  Then we didn't see Juan near our booth for sometime, perhaps another twenty minutes. We flagged down a staff member and out came Juan with our cold burgers and cold fries. I told Juan we'd not eat those, he shrugged and vanished. We asked the person at the hostess station for the manager (we were very tempted to just cut and run). Well, Juan got to him first! ""I sincerely apologize"" over and over. Then a new one ""Why didn't you tell me sooner?"" Really dude? This is your restaurant. If you don't know when your customers are being ignored, or your food is cooling off at the serving line, or your servers are ""phoning it in"" you might consider another career!

Burgers here are definitely gourmet- flavorful, filling portions and a great variety to choose from. I tried their ""sauteed shroom"" burger with a vegan patty. Mushrooms on my burger tasted delicious and patty was juicy too. Bun was fresh. Substituted steak fries for sweet potato fries- which were BOMB! We also tried their shakes- banana  and cookie dough- both were delicious. Onions rings are average. I like that Red Robin has tons of choice in their menu. Even if you are not a burger person- you will find something for your tastebuds (sandwiches, wraps, appetizers, shakes, desserts). Also, they have the ability to customize their menu- you can substitute a salad or coleslaw or sweet potato fries for their regular fries (all burgers are served with bottomless fries). If you are a vegetarian you can turn any burger into veggie burger by just substituting it with a vegan patty. They also offer a variety of buns to choose from.  Then why am I holding back one star? I wish my food came out a little more hot than it did (at best my burger was luke warm, with cheese slice just softened but not melted enough; onion rings were also at room temperature). Service here was excellent. Kaylee was our server. She has a good sense of humor and is very attentive. She got our order right and refills were served promptly. She checked on us regularly to ensure a great dinning experience. I would certainly recommend this place especially if you have a large group since seating here is plenty (indoors and outdoors) and wait time is generally limited.

Today I came here for dinner with my Mom. We waited ten minutes and we're seated at a small booth. Our waitress, Sara, came by shortly to take our order. She was warm, friendly and efficient. I ordered a drink from the bar, the bar was out of Disaronno. Bummer, I get a soda. Two out of our three appetizers get to the table. Sara apologizes, admits that she forgot to put the order in for the third, and races back to the kitchen. When our burgers came, they were all wrong. We didn't want pickle relish and avocado added. We sent them back. Sara came back afterwards with our corrected burgers and third appetizer. While eating my Mom discovered she had no avocado.  We give up on trying anymore. The manager comes by, in addition to Sara, to apologize for getting so many things wrong with our order. When we got the blithely compared our burgers and my drink. Overall, we've definitely had better there. Hopefully management works out the kinks in the kitchen so food is made how the customer wants and brought in a timely manner. Sara was a great waitress.

The only good thing about this place was the amazing desert - I think they call it ""Mud Pie"".  I might go back just for that if I wanted to eat myself sick again on a HUGE slice of chocolate, Oreo, caramel awesomeness.  But, sadly, I most likely will not because the rest of everything else there kinda sucked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=300

I guess they are experimenting with doing away with waiters and have not gone all the way on that???  It was a little weird... however getting to split the bill at the table and pay separtely at the table with the machine was AMAZING!!!  This revolutionizes splitting the bill (you literally select what you had and it all gets split out...)  That itself is worth 5 stars!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=300

The second meal was sent back because gluten free was ordered due to allergies and that's not what she got.  Her new meal showed up when the rest of us were almost finished.  However, the worst thing about the meals were the fries.  They were awful, hard and dry.  We asked for a new batch of fries and was told that ""they are all that way, we are having a problem with the supplier"".  Well, the fries are why we go to Red Robin.  I don't know why they would serve fries that they knew were bad.  I think they should have told us prior to ordering that they were having problems with the fries.  We could have ordered something else, like onion rings.  So, we didn't eat much of the ""all you can eat fries"" because they were inedible.  Also, just about when we were about to leave, our server asked if we wanted refills on our drinks.  By then, we just wanted to leave.  This has to be the worst experience we've had at Red Robin.  None of us are planning to go back anytime soon.  By the way, I did send an email to the corporation regarding the awful fries.  Their response, ""we will forward the email to the manager"".  That's the last I've heard.  So, the restaurant management doesn't care and neither does the corporation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=300

The burgers were smaller than I remembered but the bonzai burger was still pretty yummy. My mom liked her mushroom burger too. Warning: We're not really burger people so it's hard for me to compare with other burger places. We upgraded two of our regular fries to the sweet potato fries for 80 cents (still bottomless though!). The sweet potato fries were a huge hit amongst my family, parents included. Try it plain before you decide to add extra stuff on the fries because I liked it just the way it was (although I have to say that the Red Robin seasoning is yum-o, but way salty).  We came on a random Tuesday night around 7pm so I was surprised that there was such a long waiting time. We had a 7 person party and had to wait close to 40 minutes before we were seated.

Alexa gets a 5 star for the great service despite the other staffs behavior.  The first this that really shocked me and really gave me a sour taste in my mouth was Pricilla The hostess was walking with Amanda a Server and stopped next to us against the shelf where the lego Burger and fries are and Amanda whispered something to Pricilla and then Pricilla responds with a very loud, ""Oh heeeeellllllllll no, I'm not f***ing doing that"" and it really blew me away when I heard that come out of her mouth. Later right before we were leaving Pricilla became a puppy dog to Amanda just to keep talking to her and laughing.  Pricilla also was so stuck talking to the busser (who was clearly doing his job) and she was touching him and pointing at him with a pen and was going on for a good 3 minutes, while a couple is standing at the front waiting to be seated. The manager Nicole who I guess has only been a manager for a short period of time, which is no excuse. Nicole seats them and on her way walking to seat them gave Pricilla very dirty look, which shouldn't be happening at all.  Nicole the manager started off too friendly with her employees and then as the night went on she became increasingly rude with her staff, making rude smart remarks with very rude facial expressions, and while expediting the food she was being really rude to the kitchen manager clearly yelling and being very repetitive, which I can clearly hear everything she's saying and can see all of her facial expressions. I'm sorry but in my 5 years of coming here I have never had such a bad experience with staff.

I look around and oh, the hostess is chatting loudly at her front desk and over at the kitchen all the servers are talking and laughing loudly with each other....in fact both areas were having louder conversations than the actual patrons it seemed. Me and my guest sat looking pretty upset and got no acknowledgement or apology. I can understand a wait when it's busy, but at this time there was, maybe, five occupied tables? No excuse for the plain disregard for customers. I also went to the restroom and it was disgustingly dirty and zero empty tables had been bussed or cleaned and had used plates and empty cups.

Bob P.,"Santa Clara, CA",12,16,1,2.0,8/5/2015,"Saturday evening my girlfriend and I went to the Saratoga Red Robin about an hour before our movie was to start. After being seated we waited quite a while before we saw our server. She ordered a prime rib burger with tea, and I had the chicken crisp salad with a glass of water. The server dropped the tea and water as he hurried by after a while, but there was no sugar or sweetener on our table or any unoccupied tables nearby. After trying to get the attention of any of the wait staff, it was finally resolved by a trip to the bar and bringing the sweetener back to our table. Interesting that they no longer have sugar, just sweetener. Our food finally arrived and my girlfriend was delivered a french dip sandwich, not the prime rib burger she ordered. The food runner had to go find our server. Can you say: wait another 5 minutes? Of course he said he would take it back and get the right food but by this time we had only a few minutes to get to the movie. He told the manager and when she came by she asked if we wanted the burger, we said no, we have to go to the movie now. Manager asked if we wanted to take it to go. Was she unaware that you can't take food into an AMC theater? Did she think we would leave it in a car for 2 hours to grow bacteria and get all soggy? We deferred her offer to take it to go and she said she was sorry about the mix up. Then, in a tone that came across like she was doing me a favor, she said she would take it off the bill. Duh, did she really think I was going to pay for a burger I never received? I think when they screw up this bad that she could have offered a certificate for a burger in the future or some kind of compensation because the snack bar at the theater was my lady's only recourse after this happened.

Eric S.,"San Francisco, CA",251,104,79,3.0,8/21/2013,"I've been coming to this Red Robin for over 10 years, usually once or twice a year, and I'm finally writing a review.  First off, I really like the food here. The whiskey BBQ burger is my goto burger, subbing onion rings for fries and having at least one friend get fries so we get bottomless fries :) the jungle shake is pretty good too as I have recently discovered and red robin now offers some mini patty options for a dollar or two less.  Pricing is average, ~$10 a burger with fries. Nothing special.  The service on the other hand is totally hit or miss. In recent trips, I'd have to say I'm not impressed and last time I went the waiter never gave us any fries even though we asked for them the moment we sat down. He said he'd get them twice but never did, and it was a slow afternoon so that really disappointed me. In olden days, the staff would practically force feed us fries and keep them coming - that's what drew me to Red Robin in the first place and kept me going over the years. I even went for 3 of my birthdays in a row in high school! The location next to Amc 14 Saratoga recently remodeled and it looks pretty nice now. Food tastes delicious still. But the staff recently hasn't been too hot, which is why I'm rating this as 3 stars, because it really used to be the staff and fries that set red robin apart for me, and without it, I could easily go elsewhere. My friends feel the same and it's harder to get a group to go to red robin anymore :/ nonetheless, I would still say it is worth a trip every now and then!

Water came right away but the shakes took about 20minutes. At this time, we each ordered out meals. The food took about 40 minutes to come! The waitress knew we were waiting long and was nice enough to give us some fries to snack on while we waited. My fiancé ordered another beer shake with an extra shot. When this came he said he was still not able to taste the alcohol. Word of advice: order drinks at the bar directly to make sure you get what you pay for. Alone, he spent $18 on drinks and they were watered down and not mixed well. In addition, there was a charity event going on ( sheriffs raising $ for special Olympics), and they would go to every table and ask for money. It was really uncomfortable and I would see them scout families.

Mostly every time we've gone, we received great customer service, though, once in a while (as with every restaurant type establishment) the service was a little slow.  This last time that my girlfriend and I went, we decided to share a burger. We waited for about 25 minutes after we ordered, until our server came to our table. He told us that there had been a mix up with our order and that they were making it. Meanwhile, he brought us a basket of fries and told us our meal would be taken care of.  Within minutes, he returned with the burger, and left us to eat. We realized that the burger had been made normal(both my gf and I aren't a fan of the pickle relish), and asked if he could bring a bun without the pickle relish. He apologized again and brought his manager who informed us that they'd be making a second burger, and a bun for the burger on our table as well as a gift card for next time.  Talk about above and beyond.  Of course, by this time, we'd been there for about 45 minutes and were starving, however, her genuine concern for our meal by checking up on us a few times after they brought the second burger was reason enough to write a review.

Maryanne R.,"Cupertino, CA",62,448,18,1.0,8/2/2014,"We arrived tonight, a Saturday, at 8 pm and were quoted a 30-minute wait time.  They called us shortly before the 30 minutes.  Hostess sat us at a table with a dirty seat, and a crayon still on it from the last guests. The waiter came over and asked about drinks.  I said that we definitely want 4 waters.  My husband and kids ordered milkshakes.  He brought only one water for me.  My husband ordered three more waters.  He brought the shakes over and again, my husband ordered three more waters.  He brought half the waters in the freckled lemonade glasses and half in their giant pint-style glasses. He took the order and that was the last we saw of our ""server"". The food took too long, and was not hot.  We had to ask the food runner to bring some cutlery and napkins.  No one came over to check on us to see if we needed drink refills, fry refills, find out if out food was okay.  Nothing.  I've never seen anything like it.  Also, none of the other staff made eye contact with us.  I was trying to get someone's attention, anyone, to get a drink refill, but no one even looked our way.  Finally, my husband had to get up and ask the hostess to have someone bring us a bill. I think we fell throught the cracks at Red Robin tonight.  All I can think is that our served got phased, or he started the table for another server - I don't know, but something went wrong and we got the short end of the stick. Then, the very casually dressed manager came over, did not identify himself as a manager, and said ""It looks like you're all done here, can I get anything else for you?""  We said that we'd like the bill and a soda refill.  He brought the soda refill, apologized that I had to wait more than 15 minutes for a refill, and then said he was going to adjust the check and find out who was responsible for this.  Buddy, we don't care who is responsible, we just want to go home.  It was nice of him to take a random $13.30 amount off the check, but it took another 10 minutes to get out of there.  He dropped the check and said, ""I know you want to go, so....."" and kind of trailed off.  My husband was reaching into his pocket for his wallet as the manager was saying that, and yet he left the table and never came back.  We finally got the attention of the server who was waiting on a table next to ours and she ran our check.   This location was so good right after they remodelled the place about a year ago.  They were so on it.  The staff was smiling, upbeat, professional, following all the steps of service and they weren't raffling off the dishes when they got to the table, they just put them in front of who ordered them, which was very impressive for a casual family restaurant.  Well, that's all gone out the window now.  After tonight's lack of service and the quality of the food on our two most recent visits, we won't be back.  Next time it'll be Island's, or Five Guys, or SmashBurger, or The Counter, or one of the other MANY burger choices in the area for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=320

Jess D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1080,56,16,2.0,7/20/2012,"RED ROBIN...............................y u u u u u c k....... I went here for dinner with a party of 3 around 8:45pm tonight. Being it was nearly 9pm on a Thursday evening, I didnt expect a wait, but there was a 20 minute wait, which ended up taking 25 minutes.  As soon as we sat down, the person I was with said ""I bet the service is gonna suck tonight"" and boy, were they right.  First of all, being this Red Robin is right next to a movie theater, and Batman is showing at midnight tonight, along with the movie's trilogy, the manager of this location should have had the common sense to over staff, rather than under staff.  Nearly half of the restaurant was empty, but due to the fact the customer ratio was greater than the server ratio, everything just ran as slow as Eeyore on heroin.  The chefs were more backed up then the Octo-moms birth canal.  It took nearly 40 minutes to get our food after we ordered. When we finally got our food, they said ""oh they are making your sweet potato fries, so we brought you some regular fries to go with your burger for now"". Oh really!? Gee, thanks.... because I had no idea that sweet potato fries took 45 minutes to cook. Maybe Miss Idaho herself was back in the kitchen peeling them?  A few minutes later, the sweet potato fries FINALLY arrived. I was hoping that after the first bite, my teeth would turn solid gold or something spectacular would happen, due to the fact... they took so damn long, but unfortunately.... nope, they were just plain ol' sweet potato fries.  After finishing up, we asked for the check. The waitress informed my party that she went ahead and comped our drinks and took off the $1.00 charge for the sweet potato fries. Personally, I feel she should have given us all mani/pedi's to make it up to us, being the entire experience sucked as bad as the Star Wars prequel.  But with some restaurant chains, bad service and bad food is to be expected.  Let's just say that the ride back, wasnt a walk in the park, and more like a rush to the nearest restroom.  I felt as though I was in labor all over again and with every red stop light, the pain and breathing got worse.  The pains in my stomach felt as though the lolipop guild were doing a kickline against my insides.  I began to sweat and feel more and more awful.  My burger flashed through my imagination still moo-ing at me, all pink in the middle, and giving me the middle finger, telling me, ""payback is a b!tch"".  I felt like I for sure got a piece of mad cow on my plate, and maybe now it was multiplying inside me wanting revenge?... Maybe all of my vegan friends back in LA werent just ""food hipsters"" afterall? Maybe this vegan thing wasnt such a bad idea? I thought to myself. Finally, after the pain subsided and I awoke next to the toilet ((kidding)), I realized that maybe it was time to end things with Red Robin. Time to tell the 'big red faced guy' that it was over, and I wouldnt be seeing him or his delicious drinks anymore (and no, I am not talking about Mel Gibson).  This might take some time to get over. Afterall, I never experienced anything like this before with Red Robin or my innards, for that matter.  Needless to say, I wont be coming back. It was a fun ride, but a bumpy one. It was fun while it lasted, but not while it blasted. Well, you get the point.... ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=340

They ended up comping our meal but we were there for a good 3 hours. Today they lost part of our order. How does that even happen? The lost order was a simple sandwich.  For every single visit we have had to wait for fries. You would think that a place that advertises all you can eat fries would make sure that they had enough fries ready. One time we waited over 30 minutes because the kitchen was so backed up. We got 2 baskets today and one was nice and fresh and the other was stale and had what I call ""fry bits"".

I came here with 3 buddies for happy hour and we ordered some drinks, guac and salsa with chips, and chili cheese with chips. The guac and salsa was very underwhelming because they gave such a small amount of guac and salsa. The chili cheese was pretty good (better than the guac and salsa at least). But the best part of course was the drinks. Well drinks are $2.50, domestic pints are $2.50, premium pints are $3.50, and margaritas are $3.50.

I have received good service for the visits I have made to this Red Robin. The bottomless fries are a plus, but after I finish a burger & some appetizer, I am done after a serving of fries. A second round of fries would be forcing it..so the bottomless part is not too exciting for me. Their lemonade is good, but I am not a lemonader either...WOW red robin is just not for me huh?! The thing is, I eat practically anything so if my friends decided to go there, I wouldn't mind. I just would not be the one to choose Red Robin.  This is probably for all places with mozzarella sticks, but Red Robin has some delish mozz sticks and they are only good for maybe 10 minutes. After that, it's like eating rubber. My sister and I were sharing the appetizer and we had two left after our entire meal.

She apologized and mumbled some excuse as she went to the bar. She comes back a few minutes later and states they were out of the beer we ordered. So it takes 20 minutes to figure that out?! Uhh, no. Regardless we ordered a different kind of beer and received our drinks a few minutes later, which was after we got our dinner, which was both annoying and ridiculous. The fries were cold and the burger was not good. The buns were cold and tasted like they came straight out of a bag, which I'm sure they did, but they should at least warm them up. The BBQ sauce was insanely overwhelming and the crispy onion strings that were on the burger were a soggy flavorless mess.

It's a burger place, so try to avoid the rest of the menu and just get a burger! The A1 Peppercorn Burger ($10.39) and the Burnin' Love Burger ($9.59) are my personal favorites, both delivering some serious flavor. Take note: All burgers are open to customization, so don't be afraid to substitute certain cheeses, sauces, or other items to make the perfect burger for your taste. The fries could be crispier, but they're bottom-less, and just cover them with Red Robin Seasoning or Dat Campfire Sauce! Everyone raves about the Freckled Lemonade ($3.99), and it's very good for sure, but for a change of pace, get the Root Beer Float ($3.19). Endless root beer float for that price is an absolute steal! The service is definitely friendly enough, and there are a few TVs scattered around if you want to peak at a game that's showing, which adds to that fun, casual environment.

Steve B.,"Gilbert, AZ",14,32,1,1.0,1/27/2012,"So, here is a rather disappointing review of the Red Robin in the Paseo De Saratoga shopping center.  It all began with a burger craving, and neither of one of us wanted In-N-Out, so we decided on Red Robin.  Big mistake [tonight]. We were seated in an expeditious manner, as expected, by a pretty good hostess.  Next, comes our waitress, Ashley.  She was a little short thing, with what appeared to be a decent personality...at first.  We placed the drink order, which consisted of a patron margarita and two strawberry limeades.  It took her quite a while to bring them.  Next, comes the order.  I don't really know how difficult it is to write down on your little pad, ""bacon cheeseburger, dry, with fries.""  The next order was the Whiskey River BBQ cheeseburger (with fries), which somehow happened to arrive at the table, prepared correctly (amazing). So, during the entire time it took to dine, Ashley stopped by to 'see how things were,' just once.  We still didn't have any utensils or napkins about 10 minutes after our orders arrived.  Empty food plates and drink glasses began to pile up on our table, during which she showed absolutely no interest whatsoever in clearing them. This was not an enjoyable experience for any of the parties involved, including our little waitress, 'Ashley.'  She had a very apparent attitude problem tonight.  I just hope it gets fixed before she forces more customers to feed their appetite elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=380

The problems I have with this restaurant cannot be fixed with another experience but only by avoiding the restaurant at all costs.  Every single appetizer was over 2000 calories and I assure you my daily needs are somewhere around 1800. Regardless, that was JUST the appetizers, the burgers were even more, a gruesome total I dare not mention. I'm embarrassed I consumed something that cray.  Anyways, while I was there I put the caloric experience aside and just decided to eat the damn burger. I ordered the Royal Burger (topped with bacon and a fried egg) because for the longest time, since I went to Burger Me in Tahoe-Donner, I've been yearning for a burger with a perfect fried egg on top. This was more like a piece of rubber with no yolk. It didn't do anything for the burger aside from add calories.  I opted for a side salad and I was seriously disappointed. Such a weak salad, probably to encourage you choose bottomless fries next time. The price to food quality ratio is out of control.

I can only come up with two possibilities: 1) you're lazy 2) you're stupid It's part of your job, dude. Is splitting two checks three ways really any harder than splitting one check six ways? Okay. I might be a little harsh, but the situation just baffles me to no end. The onion rings stack were delicious and the game day nachos were good as well, but not enough to get me to come back.

Shortly after she took our order, she disappeared. Thankfully, we'd had the foresight to ask for both our drinks and a separate glass of water. By the time the server reappeared, all our glasses were empty. It took about 30 minutes to get our food and it really just seemed our server was in the weeds. That confused me, seeing as how the restaurant wasn't even halfway full and it was a random Thursday night. We had to ask for a few things multiple times (like drink refills), and my friend was disappointed when her mac and cheese came out SUPER al dente, not to mention COLD. My burger was super tasty at least (and hot!), and I got to sub out the bun and a salad for fries, which made me happy. But would I go out of my way to come here again? Nope.

Our burger: YUMM! Fit for a mushroom-lover! The burger came with a delicious juicy patty and almost 1/2 an inch of grilled mushrooms! Also, we were able to switch to a ciabatta bread bun which made the burger even tastier.  The patty was cooked just the way I asked which was medium rare.  Not dripping with sauce and cheese.  As promised, it came with bottomless fries, but we were so full from our burger, we only had 1 basket.   For next time, my friend recommended the Chicken Pesto Sandwich because it comes with bottomless GARLIC FRIES!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=400
Lauren S.,"San Jose, CA",140,129,1,4.0,7/12/2012,"First off, I don't typically come to this one, because it's the furthest from my house. Secondly, my future husband really doesn't like this place. at all. ever. But after last night, I think I might have changed his mind. Rather successfully, I might add! After a shopping trip at Westgate, he wanted Amatto's. I like the sandwiches, but I just wasn't in the *mood* for it. So after much deliberation, I conceded and started to drive towards Santa Clara. Finally, he said, just go where you want! I said, but you don't LIKE where I want! Eventually HE conceded, and we turned around and headed to Red Robin.  The wait was pretty long - we heard they were short staffed - so we put out name in and scouted for a place at the bar. After about 10 minutes, a place opened up, so we snagged it. John, the bartender, was quick, friendly, and poured with a pretty heavy hand, and was really nice to look at! By the time we were eating our appetizer, our name was being called (even though I had told the hostess we were sitting in the bar, whatever). Our food came quickly, and John was always quick to fill out drinks and ask how things were going for is. The future husband decided he liked his Blue Ribbon Burger, and of course, I loved my Baja Turkey Melt. REALLY sad that they're no longer serving their AWESOME french onion soup anymore! Overall, I would come back here tomorrow to sit in the bar again. Also! Happy hour prices are seriously DIRT cheap. I'm a whiskey drinker, and their well whiskey is Barton's. Not too bad, especially for $2.50 for a whiskey and coke! Small domestic drafts are also $2.50, big ones are just $3.50. Happy hour runs from 3-6 and 8-close.

Raquel R.,"San Jose, CA",93,288,62,5.0,5/21/2012,"The good: Gluten free menu, the server Andres!!  the bad: fry seasoning is not gluten free, tricky. the ugly: the wait This was the first place I ate out since I began my gluten free venture. I have to say Red Robin BRAVO, because you made my first experience a good one.  I have to admit I was scared. Eating out is almost impossible when you are gluten intolerant. SO imagine my wonderful surprise when I heard they had a gluten free menu. (I took pictures)  During the wait for the table I looked at my choices, I was disappointed because no Bonzai burger but soy sauce is like 60 percent wheat so I understand.  Ordering: I tried not to make my gluten problem a problem so I didn't tell my waiter, much to my boyfriends dismay. I ordered the cheeseburger. Protein style when I asked if they had a seperate fryer for their fries He said yes but looked at me weird. I asked for fries with no seasoning. My boyfriend couldn't handle it anymore and said ""she can't have gluten"" A big look of realization came across the waiters face and he said ""we have a gluten free bun.""  GLUTEN FREE BUN!!! I almost died. YES please.  I ordered my food feeling so happy and when it arrived I was so happy because apparently when you have allergies you get a yellow basket that means the manager prepares it or whatever so you are sure it is perfect and gluten free. I still thought the fries looked like they had seasoning so I asked if I could get different fries. THe waiter took it all in stride and I thanked him profusely.  My food was good. Yes good and the bun was not lacking. I have to say though they added relish to my burger which I hate relish but  that was probably my fault. The bun is an extra $1 but it is worth it. My fries we amazing and my $2.50 well drink was also amazing. (happy hour after 9pm, M-F) If you go and you are gluten free Eat without being worried.

NOOOPE! Side note: If you guys frequent Red Robin enough, sign up for their email club thing. You'll get a coupon for a free birthday burger, which is the reason I was dining there :)  I always order the same thing -- Royal Red Robin Burger, no lettuce or tomatoes, medium rare, cut in half, campfire sauce and ranch on the side for my french fries, and a Strawberry Freckled Lemonade. Dang, I'm at what, 2,800 calories already? The food was good (and 5 stars for that), but what was starting off as a great dinner experience took a bad turn that just left me pissed off the rest of the night. I gave our waiter my birthday burger coupon when she first took our order for two reasons, 1.) I knew it would make her job easier so she wouldn't have to void stuff out and blah blah, and 2.) I wanted my birthday sundae to be ready, as well as have the staff be prepared to sing Happy Birthday to me (oh come on, birthdays only come once a year and for that one day, you're allowed to be as self-centered as you want). Ten minutes after our food was taken away, I kept glancing around for my waiter, pretending to be unaware that I get a free sundae and ready to act embarrassed when everyone sings Happy Birthday to me and the surrounding tables clap for me. Then I see my waiter. She has my sundae. She sets it down on our table. And then ... ""Sorry, none of the other waiters want to sing Happy Birthday to you."" -____- SERIOUSLY? Talk about unprofessionalism (not sure if that's a word) and just downright rude, I pretended that I didn't really care when in reality I was crying that no one wanted to sing Happy Birthday to me :( lol. Then she went on this rant of how she tried finding a group of people but no one wanted to do it, and blah blah. That's funny, I just saw a group of your people serenading three different tables prior to you coming out, but then again, what do I know? I'm just a customer. She also added something along the lines of like, ""And I'm sure you don't want me to sing by myself."" (to which I responded in my head, ""People at Cold Stone do it all the time."")

Erin B.,"Sunnyvale, CA",19,11,,2.0,7/13/2014,"We've been long-time customers of this particular Red Robin restaurant, long before it was given a facelift and calling itself a ""bistro.""  Let me tell you, from one burger lover to another, that it has pretty much gone downhill since then.  While the menu has expanded, offering new things like chili cheese fries and a myriad of dipping sauces, the quality and consistency of the food (particularly takeout) has taken a serious nose dive.  For example, a couple of nights ago my husband and I ordered our usual takeout meal, including chili cheese fries and mac and cheese.  We've ordered these items a dozen times in the past, and let's just say that we have gotten something a little different each time. It all depends on who is in the kitchen and who is packaging the food.   To be fair, there have been times when there has been a lot of love put into our meal, and it has shown through the quality of the burger, the amount of chili put on the fries, and how neatly it was packaged. This time, when we asked for chili cheese fries, we were told that they were ""out of chili.""  Out of chili??!??!  How can you be out of chili???  The mac and cheese was literally buttered pasta with shredded cheese sprinkled on top.  On TOP, and not mixed into it.  ARE YOU SERIOUS.  Who the hell makes their mac and cheese like that?  Were they banking on the heat of the pasta melting the cheese while it sat in the to go container?  I literally had to throw it in a saucepan and add our own cheese and milk.  Really??!   Also, the packaging of the food was horrendous.  Foil sloppily wrapped around the burger, burger boxes a little smashed with shreds of cheese stuck to it... you get the picture. That reminds me, one time when we dined in the restaurant, we were actually told that they were out of mac and cheese.  What?!?   It's just pasta, cheese, butter, and milk, for Pete's sake.  How often do they stock their kitchen??? Regarding quality of service, we've actually had quite pleasant experiences with all of our servers.  So, that's why I'm being pretty generous and giving two stars instead of one. All in all, when Red Robin is good, it can be really good.  However, when it's bad, it's annoyingly AWFUL.  And, unfortunately, we've experienced more bad than good lately, so we're hesitant to come back for another dine-in or takeout experience.  Just not worth the money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=420

The waiter for that station was serving a large party of 18, so she filled in and made sure we were taken care of.  We ordered the Prime Chophouse Burger and the California Chicken Sandwich. Both were juicy, delicious and hit the spot.  I worked in a restaurant for over 10 years so I commend management who support their staff when it's needed.

Jessica L.,"San Jose, CA",140,50,76,3.0,1/29/2012,"Location/Ambiance: Located in the Paseo De Saratoga shopping center which is full of things to do, eat, and buy. I usually go here before going to the AMC in that plaza and appreciate that I can have dinner before a movie without having to get in my car in between. Red Robin is a chain restaurant and has that chain restaurant ambiance. Clean, large, with ample seating. I went one weekend and the wait was 30-40 for two people.  Food/Prices: I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants but Red Robin is not too shabby. They have consistently good ""gourmet"" burgers at a good price that are served with delicious, BOTTOMLESS steak fries. I always get the Guacamole Bacon Burger ($9.89) - SO good! Fresh guacamole with a hint of lime, crispy bacon strips, and swiss cheese - droooool! You can customize your burger so that's a plus. One of the best things is their HONEY MUSTARD. Sometimes I crave that more than the burger. Also, their Red Robin seasoning turns those steak fries into a party. It's mainly a burger place but there are also other entrées like pasta and sandwiches but I'd avoid anything but a burger. There's a bar if you'd like an alcoholic beverage with your meal as well. Service: Good. I'd give Red Robin 3.5 stars if I could.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=440

Julie N.,"San Jose, CA",633,401,1382,4.0,3/31/2011,"What were we thinking coming here on a Friday evening?!!!  luls, actually we were starving and our first two attempts at dinner failed so we ""settled"" with Red Robin's delicious burgers! We left the crazy lines and waiting in the cold rain at Orenchi and Kahoo and decided we were too hungry to search for another ramen place. Got here and saw the mob of people and started to silently sob. It worked out perfectly though because as we were about to become forced anorexics we saw the sign for happy hour, which starts at 8PM. It was 8:02! Yaaay $3.50 imported beer! Put our name on the 45 minute wait list (with the assistance of a very organized, hardworking host =] ) and headed to the bar where we had multiple beers and raspberry margaritas :D The bartenders were kinda lame, carding us multiple times... whaaa they don't take the time to remember their customers' faces anymore? The margaritas were a waste of time and money because they were so weak and the glasses came out stickyicky.  After about an hour, my boyfriend left to check on our spot in line and was told we just had a couple more minutes. We attempted to finish up at the bar so other people could sit but no bartenders were around to charge us! Being the good people that we are, we told the host that came to get us later that we never got charged for anything. he said he'd take care of it... more on that later.  got seated and our server was super friendly! We weren't even in her section! Our section's server was on lunch so this server just picked up an extra table... so nice of her considering it was madness in the restaurant.  I had the Bleu Ribbon burger and my boyfriend had the Whiskey River BBQ Burger. I have this unhealthy addiction to their honey mustard sauce so I generously poured it onto my burger, which took away the already subtle melted bleu cheese taste. The blue cheese was definitely there though because my tummy reminded me starting an hour later =)  Random note: I never have room for refills of the steak fries. So much for ""bottomless"" =(  We got the check and they still hadn't charged us for all the bar drinks! But of course on our way out, my boyfriend stops by the bar and tells the bartender she never charged us (what a stand-up guy!). She gives us this look, ""Who are you?"" but then remembers and for the first time all night, smiles at us and makes light conversation -_______- Confession: I used to not like Red Robin all that much because I'm so bad at eating burgers... gets too messy! But I've slowly but surely overcome my awkwardness eating burgers, and with my new skills, I had a delicious (tipsy) meal at Red Robin!

Peter T.,"San Diego, CA",302,835,382,2.0,4/20/2009,"This location is located in my hometown. With the recent closure of Kirk's Steakburgers, Red Robin has been pushed into the spotlight as the leading burger(s) within a 5 mile radius of my parent's house.  The restaurant is SUPER cheesy. Its like since Bullwinkles and Chucky Cheese filed for chapter 7 decades ago,and Red Robin bought up all their gadgets and put it in their restaurant; which in turn, makes it very child-friendly. Their walls are also filled with a bunch of theme-less random pictures. I thinkt they're going for an 50's American thing, but there are movie posters of the Matrix, and maybe even Speed 1. Maybe its a  Keanu (sp) Reeves theme. Anyway, the burgers are (not) gourmet but they are delicious. And to define not gourmet i mean that the quality of meet is not any where up to par. When they ask for temperature they ask ""a little pink or no pink"" which means that the quality of meet is unsafe to eat anywhere below medium-well. Um.... scary? But their Bonzai Burger combines sweet and hickory flavors which is enough for me to risk being sick for 3 weeks with food poisoning.  Oh yea, service is shoddy. Once i waited 50 minutes for a togo order.  Go here if you are: A. A family looking for a fun night out. AMC theateres is right next to it so burgers, kids, movies. Fun for everyone! B.

Aubrey C.,"Cupertino, CA",28,168,,2.0,5/30/2011,"2.5 stars, primarily due to weakness of the service Red Robin, even though a chain, has decent burgers but their service is suspect, especially when the restaurant is busy. I went here with friends one Saturday evening. The bulk of the menu at Red Robin is (of course) burgers, though they do have other things such as fish and chips, and something they call clamstrips.. which I assume are chicken strips except with claims.  I had the Royal Burger, which has a fried egg on top. It was a solid burger, but the egg was a bit overcooked (and not runny enough). For around $10, the price isn't too bad for a gourmet burger given that you get endless steak fries. However, when the restaurant is busy, they seem to be stingier with the fries.. perhaps because they don't have enough. At the same time, if you're going to pay $10 for a burger, you may as well go to a non-chain place that has (likely) better and fresher ingredients.  It's the service that really hinders Red Robin though. We had to wait about 15 minutes before anyone even came for a drink order... and even then, we had to get a server's attention. Even for a chain restaurant, our server was a tad incompetent.. she messed up two of our orders, and inexplicably only filled my root beer float halfway. The service all throughout the meal remained slow.  Basically, Red Robin is only good for the occasional burger, but if you want something a tad bit better (with infinitely more capable service), there are a lot of places in the Bay Area with great burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=440
Jill S.,"San Jose, CA",38,8,,5.0,3/14/2012,"Red Robin is a great place to go if you are looking for a great burger and a kid-friendly restaurant. We were at the Saratoga location this past Sunday after seeing the Lorax with our 2 1/2 year old daughter. The restaurant was quite crowded when we got there around 6 but the wait was not bad. The manager on duty that night was extremely friendly and patient with our daughter when she asked for a balloon. Although they did not have any strings for the balloon, she went out of her way to get a straw to tie her balloon to.  This may seem like a small or insignificant fact to some but as a mother, I was very pleased to see her take the time to make my daughter happy. She even got down on her level to talk to her and when a couple approached to put their name on the list for the wait, she told them she would be with them in just a minute. She seemed to be doing it because she truly cared and not because she had to. In this day and age, when most staff/managers at restaurants seem like they never want to be bothered by children, this small act of kindness made my daughter and in turn me, very happy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=440

Or so we thought!  :( Although there were very few customers, it took a little while before our server came to take our orders.   At 12:30, we finally had to ask our server what happened to our food... She said it was coming in a minute... Some more time passed (a lot more than 1 minute), and we still hadn't received any food, so we asked them to take the food to go, as we were now going to be late for our work meeting.  It took over 15 minutes just to get our food packed up!  If indeed our food was just about ready to be served... We could have managed to scarf it down in the time to get it packed for us!  I do have to say at least they managed to pack the hot foods in a separate bag from the cold foods.  BUT, of course, they didn't include utensils for the salad, nor did they include any Ketchup for the fries... Nor the extra orders we asked for since we would no longer be able to cash in on our unlimited fries!  :(. She also said we could get cups for our drinks... And while she gave us Togo cups for our waters and two of the paid drinks (which they didn't get any refills on while we were seated...)... The other two of the paid drinks never actually materialized! The bill took a really long time to arrive after we asked, even after our server knew we were running extremely late.  Then it took even longer to get the bill picked up to run a credit card.  When they finally picked it up, it took a really long time to get the slip back, so we finally gave up and went to the front register to get it ourselves.  One car stayed behind to take care of the card and wait for the forgotten drinks while my car left first. Of course, but the time we got to work (less than 10 minutes away), the fries had that sogginess to it (which we couldn't hide with ketchup even, as our waitress forgot, even though we asked for it and she said she would get it for us) and the burger just didn't hit the spot. Needless to say, definitely NOT my best Red Robin experience.  I guess we won't becoming back here again for lunch.  (We had come with a large party a few years back and had great service...

They hadn't even fired it!!! The burger finally came out about 8pm and it was raw inside!!! The cheese wasn't melted, and the fries were soggy!!! I couldn't believe it. We asked for a manager immediately. She came out, offered to cook the hamburger herself and get me a fresh salad. Guess what? The burger was STILL raw! The manager was apologetic, but kept touching my boyfriend on the arm, inappropriate if you ask me. I ate a bit of my salad, but we were so turned off, we left without paying.  Needless to say, we will NEVER go back. How can a hamburger place fail so miserably and not be able to cook a damn hamburger properly!?!

Once a week they parade an employee in a red robin outfit to hand out ballons to the kids (don't remember what week night). They specialize in hamburgers, but also have a few chicken items.  Mac and cheese is typical kraft, but you can substitute fruit for fries on the kid menu items  Vegetarians can get a veggie patty which is actually pretty good. Unlimited fries and drink refills allows you to be a glutton. Their cookie magic Oreo shakes are great .  They've got one of the better mixed drink menus in town.  If you got room for dessert try their mud pie, it's huge!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=460

However, the reason I wish to review my experience here today is based solely on the the CHARMING waitress we had *insert sarcasm* named Shannon. When she took my order I told her I would take the grilled turkey burger. She read my order back to me as the turkey sandwich, which in my experience is a completely different dish. So I wanted to clarify with her that the ""sandwich"" would come with a turkey PATTY (not deli slices) and would come on a hamburger bun! And she replies impatiently... ""yes, the sandwich."" Ok. Maybe she is having a bad night, I'll let that one go. What really bugged me was when she actually brought my food to me. She says and I quote ""Here's your turkey BURGARRRR. Don't take offense."" Is she serious?! Not only that, she was not attentive to our table at all even though there weren't many other patrons at the time.

Don't waste your money on that movie unless you're a die hard fan. Pun intended. Anyways, the food here is the typical greasy, fatty and unheatlhy food that you'd find at most American places. I was hungry though so ordered the chicken burger with onion rings. For a $1.00 extra, you can subsitute onion rings for the bottomless fries. You can also get bottomless refills on almost all of their nonalcoholic drinks. There is a nutrition chart on the table which I read of course and found out that most of the items there are about 900+ calories and that excludes the fries.  The funny thing is the fat content wasn't included, just the saturated fat was listed. I guess they don't want to scare people too much. My guess is that my fried chicken burger had  twice the amount of a McDonald's McChicken sandwhich as it was big but a little bland. Honestly, the McChicken sandwhich is much better IMHO. I feel so ashamed for eating over a whole days worth of calories late at night.  Ugh! I'll try to eat healthier from now on as hard as it is for me at times. BTW, the salads aren't low in calories either, so you might as well have a burger or a bunless one. Still, you'll be consuming close to 600 calories. Also, if you happen to be a little larger than average, don't let them sit you in a small two person booth as my husband who is only sort of overweight had a hard time getting out of the booth. I'm not kidding. I guess the table is just too close to the seat.

We were seated in a booth by the kitchen, which was a bit distracting but our server made up for the crap table. Sabrina (our server) was very upbeat and patient with us (and the other tables she was looking after) and I really appreciate that, for it was my first time coming here in about 6 years and was unsure of what to order. I ended up choosing the Chophouse burger and J picked the Burning burger(?). The flavors in my burger were nice but the portion size was ridiculously small and Jason didn't like his burger much either and both of us agreed that for the price, it was a rip-off. However, the massive amount of steak fries that Sabrina kept bringing over to us made up for the pitiful sized burger.

So, I asked the server if I could have some extra on the side. He came back with a little cup of some kind of powder and said that was what they used. Sriracha powder?! That stuff is awesome! I sprinkled it lavishly all over my burger and fries, and that was the best burger meal I've ever had at Red Robin. Overall, I like coming here with my family.

But no, says the barkeep, because it'll look to other customers who are waiting like you're getting served ahead of them. That's a hassle says me. . . What? Like it's my fault that people are too thick to start appetizers before ordering mains, or the wait staff is too clueless to care about their customers enough to suggest the alternative, or to offer even so much as a cool drink   I swear, the cattle on the menu were treated better than those made to wait in line at this place. The staff doesn't give a sh!% about anything except looking smug.  We left, and went to Kirk's.  The food was *FAR* better tasting, with fresher condiments, properly cohesive fresh meat in the burgers, and way better grilled. There was also zero wait, couteous service, and it cost half as much. I'm pleased to recommend the experience to anyone reading this review     For my money, the best burgers in Silicon Valley are at Kirk's, unless of course you'd be interested to try the the grill at the SJ Muni Golf Course.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=500

She would go at least once a week and come back with mountains of left-overs that would sit in the fridge until death overtook whatever  was once in them. I guess this was another case of Paramore: love the band, hate the fans. So Red Robin is actually a lot of fun. And I really have to hand it to my boyfriend. He was able to hype up a restaurant he enjoyed (and knew I would enjoy) if only he could get me there to see it. Great job, Love. Not only is Red Robin fun, it's quirky fun. From the crooked glasses to the collage motif, this is a pretty neat little diner. Of course I had to order the tortilla soup. I would rate it 3 in my Top 5, but that's not a bad ranking. It's just white-person tortilla soup with no spicy kick. I could see how lots of people like it. Boyfriend had a famous burger and (bottomless) steak fries. He greatly enjoys the (rather tasty) freckled lemonade. I got a strawberry milk shake. Chili cheese chip dip was generous and delicious.

My friends also had to wait forever to get a refill and when our server came to our table he would even let us get a word in before he would leave.

Four of us:  Double Banzai Burger + Orange Cream shake for son  Reds Rice Bowl (on a plate) + Speckled Lemonade for son's GF  Bacon Cheeseburger + chocolate malt for daughter  A-1 Peppercorn Burger + Iced Tea for me  One side of onion strings  Plus a special request side of fried jalapeno rings (yum)  $63.11 (ouch), $75 total with tip.  Our server was wonderful and attentive. Very friendly. Service is always hit or miss here. Sometimes you get a good server like we did, other times you get a blah to terrible one.  The kitchen is slow.  Now, I cannot comment on what my kiddies ate, but I can sure comment on my A-1 Peppercorn Burger: ""Sizzling, hickory-smoked bacon, melted Pepper-Jack cheese, A-1 Peppercorn sauce, crispy onion straws, onions and tomatoes on an onion bun.""   This was not a meld of flavors, but an all out brawl with the bun being the bully. Note: Not so much an onion bun as it was an herb bun, totally overpowered the burger, and was dry and crumbly.  Save for the tomato and onions, everyone fought with each other - and not in a good way. The Pepper-Jack cheese lacked flavor but delivered an unpleasant gooey sliminess to the burger.  I usually like to try a different burger each time, but definitely will not be revisiting the A-1 Peppercorn burger!  In the end, I think we are still St. John's fans. Better burgers, better onion rings, better fries - and better prices on half-off days! $63 for four lunch plates. Ouch.  (Isn't RR supposed to be family friendly?  Yikes.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=540

The first my two friends and I had her as our waitress, the service was alright up until she commented on the fact that she received a smaller tip than she thought she deserved (not in so many words), and told us ""we shouldn't do that.""  Ummmm, what???  My two friends had her AGAIN last night, and when the bill came, she had already added a $5.00 tip! And here I thought gratuity was only included with parties of 6 or 8 or more. My friend told the manager and Tiffany (the waitress) denied the whole thing.  I've been in food service for over 3 years and I know that you NEVER, ever ask for a tip. You may think you deserved one, but it is totally out of line to ask or even demand a tip, and especially out of line to add on to the bill of a party of two!

Myka W.,"San Jose, CA",135,134,15,4.0,11/30/2009,"It was my birthday Saturday and hubby was taking me to see New Moon at the AMC so I said I wanted to try Red Robin. It's one of those places you see every time you go to the movies...but I'd never tried it.  We walked in and like a previous review...I wasn't quite sure what I was supposed to do. There were families everywhere with kids running around. I see a hostess with a clipboard so I walk towards her. Ask the wait (15, not bad) and tell her two. She says ok...""Don't you want my name?"" ""Oh, yeah, sorry."" Friendly enough but it is really chaotic in the entrance. Ok, so first impression is rough. I""m a little worried because it seems very kid oriented, hubby looks anxious, I'm thinking, ""oh crap, hope the food is ok."" Anyway, we get seated, luckily in a section with very few kids. Right away we are super excited by the bottomless drinks. A bottomless root beer float? Hubby was all over that. I got the Raspberry Limeade, also bottomless. The waitress asked if we'd been there before and let us know about the bottomless fries (my weakness, uh oh!) so we're pretty stoked. We decide to get the queso and the Blue Ribbon burger to split. The staff split everything for us. The burger was really good and the steak fries were perfect. Our drinks were never below half (bad bad for the waistline but so nice!) The queso was ok. It had very little salsa and we'd hoped there would have been more.   The manager stopped by once to say hello and was genuinely surprised neither of us had ever been to a Red Robin. He was very nice and made sure my drink stayed full. Total bill was $23 and hubby wants to go back for his birthday. My only suggestion is to get the lobby/hostess situation more organized. It is really disorienting that they don't have a hostess stand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=540

Dan N.,"San Jose, CA",0,28,,1.0,4/17/2012,"TLDR version: horrendous service, poorly prepared food I've tried coming here a couple of times, and usually end up going somewhere else due to inexplicably long wait times.  I once tried to come at lunch and the place was half empty with no one waiting, but was told that there would be a 30 minute wait time. But I decided to give them a chance and came here relatively early on a Friday night.  The place was busy, but wasn't totally packed.  As usual, they said it was a 30 minute wait.  One hour later, my friends and I were seated.  I don't think they actually do any estimations; they just say 30 minutes regardless of how busy they are. A friend of mine has the menu here memorized, so as soon as we're seated she orders a bunch of appetizers for us.  It takes 45 minutes before the food shows up, and the waitress disappears for 20 minutes at a time.  Our burgers come out a little over an hour after we place our orders.  Water and drinks were left empty, and they didn't even give us utensils until 10 minutes after they brought our food. If the food was awesome I might overlook the bad service, but other than the awesome onion rings the rest of the food sucked.  The burgers were all burnt.  We had one child with us who ordered the grilled cheese, and the cheese wasn't melted.   A side order of mac and cheese came out cold.   I've been to other Red Robins, and they're not my favorite place but they're a decent place to get burgers.  I'm staying away from this one for good though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=560

It seems as though they are a bunch of high school kids that just don't care. Once we get seated it's always hit or miss as far as the server goes. most of the time the servers are pretty bad.

So like I said it really is hit or miss with the servers. Let's talk food... we have tried the onion rings, fried zucchini, cheese sticks, and Kettle-Cooked Chips and all of them are yummy. My favorite is the zucchini though. We have also tried the guacamole and it wasn't good at all. For burger time I always order the cheese burger with pepper-jack cheese, onion straws, and avocado.

Tonight we let our 11-year-old pick an un-veto-able dinner for a special occasion.  He normally has pretty good taste, and my biggest worry was on budget rather than quality, but an afternoon trip to Target gave him unusual motivation, and I cringed when he said, ""Red Robin!"" So we're seated, and no one comes.  And no one comes.  Waitrons are just standing around doing nothing, the place is half empty.  Finally I see some of them pointing in our direction and having a heated discussion.  Finally someone comes to the adjacent table and  I overhear him mumbling something about a mix-up and how he'll take care of them for now.  He takes their order. A good 5 minutes later someone else comes to us and says he's not our server, but can take our drink orders. Finally a waiter shows up, explains that this is his section and he was on his break, and says he wishes the hosts would use their brains.  I dunno, at my company we cover for each other when people aren't available, and we also don't bad-mouth the other employees in front of customers, but what do I know, I don't work in a restaurant.  Whatever, we could have been assertive or bitchy or something and gotten served faster, this in and of itself doesn't take them down to one star. Dude drops our food on the table, and says, ""let me get you some silverware"" and we also order a drink refill for one of our kids.  He repeats the drink order, comes back and drops one set of silverware on the table and vanishes.  Problem is, three of us need forks for our food.  I've been known to rob other tables or even bus stations, but that's not an option here -- everything's in the kitchen.  Finally I walk over to the kitchen, where all the waitstaff are standing around looking stupid.  I asked for two more sets of silverware, and they get them, and I remind the guy about the drink, and he says, ""yeah, I have a shift meeting coming up here, I can't get it right now."" So let's talk about the food.  Burgers ordered medium-rare are well done (big surprise); salad greens are Oklahoma quality, not California quality;  salad is covered in institutional cheddar shreds, the kind they'd give us in elementary school that we joked was government surplus.  The menu lacks diversity, and the special flavorings of all the individual burgers are all in mayo, so if you don't want the mayo, you don't get the flavor.  Quality for price is really weak.  Why would anyone ever come here, other than boundless love for their 11-year-old?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=580

Esma B.,"Campbell, CA",31,3,1,1.0,4/7/2012,"first i must add a little personal note and state that i was raised with small portions and organic meat and with a dedicated and talented mother that cooked excellent meals nearly every night. it was my first time coming in today with the family (family of 4 - two kids) and might I just say now my last as well. I came in with a fresh mind and hungry stomach and was excited to try my first American restaurant. As soon as we got seated after 25 minutes it took the waitress 10 minutes to bring drinks and be ready to take our order. we ordered an appetizer specifically so we can munch on before the meal, however the appetizer didn't come until 20 minutes later along with the food! I thought appetizers come immediately(?) or else we wouldn't have ordered it in the first place!! now I ordered my first prime ribs and i was extremely displeased. not only was it expensive but it really doesnt taste like meat. it tastes like a bunch of hormones and false tenderizers. I'm sure right now if I were to apply extensive research and figure out what was in those ribs I would be very displeased; and not to mention how my stomach just didnt take that sandwich at all well. fries were okay, I just felt that everything was extremely greasy as well as one of their classic burgers on the menu (I stole a bite from my brothers burger). now not to mention how LOUSY the service at that place is. no towels on the table? two time request for hot sauce? forgetting water? extra refills on things we never requested? I'm sorry, but I've been to other places which is a little bit better than that.

Plenty of options to choose from. Picked the cheeseburger with a GF bun with fries.  Waitress explained that the GF fries are cooked in a separate fryer.  Waitress was very accommodating - didn't make me feel awkward for ordering off a special menu at all.  Food was great (even the GF bun!), hot and the service was even better.

Love the fries & campfire sauce, and you have to order them right when you sit down so they (usually) will come out ahead of your meal. We've had a couple instances with less-than-stellar servers (not knowing the menu, not bringing fries till the meal is already out, etc), but fortunately our experiences have been more on the good side. I like that this one has also incorporated the SMS messaging for your table, so you can pretty much go off and do whatever you want, and then just go back when your table's ready.

Greg A.,"San Jose, CA",39,32,2,3.0,2/22/2009,"If one were to list every burger joint in the world from greatest to worst, there'd be numerous fights about what place should be on top, and which chain (probably McDonald's) should go on bottom, but I don't think there'd be one person who could argue that this particular Red Robin would go directly in the middle of the list. The service is pretty good, they never seem to mess up the orders. It can take a little time to get the check and then have them ring you out. The waiters are nice, but they're not TOO nice, so you never have to worry about your food being delayed because they can't stop talking to you about the new Twilight book. The best way to describe the food here is this- Think of Denny's. Now add a little higher quality beef with a little less grease, and recipes that actually sound good. That's a Red Robin burger. Also, if you only like a touch of mayo, definitely make sure to ask for Mayo on the side, because they buy lettuce that's been marinated in Miracle Whip for 18 months. Easy to find, the parking isn't bad, the bathrooms are clean.

I went on a Sunday for a late afternoon lunch, and the number of kids at this location was incredible.  There were more balloons than hamburgers in the place, and the noise level was pretty high.  There were maybe about 4-5-6 t.v.s playing baseball, a small bar to the left by the entrance, and everyone scattered throughout the restaurant with their screaming kids. The food was great, although you have to be prepared to pay at least 7 or 8 just for the burger, but they do come with fries, which are bottomless.  The fries really taste like potatoe, and they're big and fluffy.   I got the California Chicken Burger and it was excellent.  It was heavy, filling and tasty.   The fries were heavy.

Bradd S.,"San Jose, CA",57,46,40,1.0,12/6/2007,"Worst. Service. Ever. I've eaten at this Red Robin five times. On one occasion, the host apparently sat me in no-man's land (a table that's not currently covered by anyone on duty). A waitress did eventually notice my situation and picked up the table. She was quite friendly and contrite, but she wasn't particularly good at handling me in the out-of-section booth. Another time, the host sat us in a proper section. Unfortunately, the host staff had also assigned multiple large groups to the same waitress. She was rushing around trying to cope with two ten-tops at the same time, and three overall! Furthermore, the neighboring servers completely ignored the problem. I'm very mild-mannered about service mistakes (having been a bad waiter myself), but eventually I had no choice but to complain. After that, we had the server and a manager both waiting on us, and the service was still terrible. Just as an example, the two of them together couldn't get our drink orders right. I asked for one of the drink specials, a milkshake with alcohol, and my guest ordered Dr Pepper. My meal arrived before my shake, and the waitress kept getting the Dr Pepper order wrong. She would ask, ""What did you have again? Sprite?"" She even got confused about whether Red Robin was a Coke or Pepsi house and would offer the wrong one. Nevermind that we didn't even want cola, she brought us Diet Coke. On my fifth and final visit, the same waitress served us again. She was less busy and less incompetent, and we acted as though her mistakes were entertainment rather than inconvenience. The meal was OK, if a bit chaotic. Unfortunately, I got quite sick that night. I have no way of knowing whether the food made me sick, or whether it was an unrelated illness, but I don't want to press my luck. That's three terrible experiences out of five visits, and almost every part of the restaurant contributed to the problems: the host staff, wait staff, bar, management, and possibly kitchen. This earned this Red Robin the dubious honor of being the first restaurant I've ever permanently banned from my dining list.

Karissa T.,"Carlsbad, CA",47,11,3,2.0,9/2/2009,"My 4 other girlfriends and I decided to go to Red Robin on a Thursday night; I was really excited about the food but once I saw the crowd of people outside, I was intimidated. So we walked in and saw a host/hostess stand but no one in sight. We didn't really know what to do then all of a sudden, a woman and her 3 children walk around us. She had definitely cut in front of us to get to the hostess that had shown up right as the woman had cut us off. The hostess had seen the woman cut in front of us but did nothing about it; she motioned for us to come forward and I tried to ask her how long the wait was going to take. She couldn't hear me with the phone ringing, the music blaring, and the loud chatter in the tiny lobby. She got frustrated and wrote the amount of people in my party and what I was wearing (as well as racially profiling me).. she then said, ""WE'LL CALL YOU WHEN WE HAVE A TABLE OPEN!""  I'm thinking.. what the eff? She didn't even get my name..  So my girlfriends and I stepped outside to wait for our table-- a moment later, we realize the outside tables are open and the weather was nice so why not? I went back inside and flagged down the other host that had seemed to be coming back from a break. I had asked if we could possibly sit outdoors and he said no, right off the bat. I asked why and he said he didn't know and that the waiters told him not to seat anyone outside. I asked to speak to a manager and he panicked for a moment and ran to a waiter. The waiter approached me and said he'd take care of us if we wanted to sit outside, so I agreed to go outside (I decided not to complain to the manager just yet because my stomach was growling hard!).  We sat down out in the patio and ordered -- I got the Royal Red Robin burger which was absolutely delicious but I hope there was no spit. The waiter was nice but he ended up forgetting about us for half an hour straight while we waited for our check. I walk in with one of my girlfriends looking for him and we see him sitting at a booth in the back.. eating. He saw that we had been looking for him so he looked alarmed, he jumped up and rushed to us. He quickly apologized and got us our check. We paid, but then we had to wait even longer because we had asked for a to-go back. I had suggested not to ask (to my friends) because I knew it would take forever and I was right; it took another 20 minutes and we were late for our movie at AMC14.

Worse, instead of informing us politely she just kept on with the ""yours will be out in just a minute"" line. So we were disappointed with the service and had Yelp on the brain. We discussed divvying up our dinners so that we could all just eat already. I presume the waitress overheard us talking because shortly after that someone who looked like a manager came out and said there was a ""human error"" and offered to ""make it right."" She was nice (maybe more serious/mediocre than nice), professional, and had the remainder of our food out quickly and gave us some extra fries (she was probably trying to liquor us up - RR's fries are intoxicating) and a drink refill. We were on our way to satisfaction but still hemming and hawing (as one does when approaching 90 hungry minutes in a chain restaurant.) Not that we expected much more (really, what do you expect when you eat at RR on a Friday night?) Here's why RR gets three stars and not zero: Unexpectedly (and without solicitation), the manager came back out and covered our entire dinner bill for the night. Admittedly we had spent a significant amount at the bar, but I would consider this ""above and beyond"" to make things right. The food and drinks were all good and we ended up going home satisfied -- almost feeling a little guilty, but not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=660

Where to eat before watching Star Trek?  Hmmm - we know we wanted to hit up Nordstrom Rack for some Mother's Day deals, and there is a theatre there, what to eat, what to eat... RED ROBIN! The wife loves their freckled lemonaide, it comes loaded with strawberries, their fries & seasoning always hit the spot too. here's what we had: Appetizer Nacho's w/ grilled chicken: 3 of 5 - This is an easy dish to replicate and I often do so at home when we are entertaining.  Each chip gets topped off with cheese, beans & a jalapeno slice with sour cream, guac & salsa on the side to top off.  The chicken was cut into big chunks which was cool but was a little too filling and they put waaaaaaaaay too much cheese, not ideal if you are trying to keep the calories to a minimum. Cluck n Fries: 4 of 5 - the wife always orders this, the chicken strips were bomb! nice and crispy and well seasoned.  Their bbq & ranch dipping sauces have a very good flavor.  The fries were nice and big just not as fried as we like. Blackend Bayou Burger - 3 of 5 - it came on a jalapeno kaiser bun, have no idea what that means.  They were able to leave the burger pink which made it nice and juicy, also had pepper-jack cheese, angry onions and instead of lettuce cole-slaw. Pretty good overall but i didnt walk awy thinking i had one of the most awesome burgers either, i am struggling to remember what else it had in it, so thats why its a 3. Service: 5 of 5 - Our waiter was very attentive without being in the way, very clean worker, smooth, brought out our refills about 2 or 3 sips earlier than most do, in fresh glasses.  Sure it was dead and he only had like 3 or 4 tables but he was on point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=660
