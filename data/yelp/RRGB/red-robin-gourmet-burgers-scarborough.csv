Tim S.,"Jamison, PA",25,124,87,3.0,9/5/2017,"Food was exactly what I expected. It was good, not great. I got an Avo-Cobb salad. It was fine. Service was very good. Daniel provided ""night level"" service at lunch. He was very thorough. Even checking back after I was done.  Providing no wifi because you are a ""family"" restaurant is just another way of saying that you don't want to cater to business travelers. As a result, I'll go elsewhere next week. Wifi is the expected standard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough
Phinney C.,"Portland, ME",0,104,8,4.0,7/24/2017,"Let me regale you with a not very interesting story, it might even sound familiar. Long day at work, I'm tired, in need of beer and food, but the girlfriend and I must go to the Marshall's to return things. We need something quick and easy and there's Red Robin across the street. I'm too tired to argue but am not expecting much. We sit at the bar, and I'm pleasantly surprised to see they have a Maine Beer Co. beer on, which seems like a small miracle. Then I see this list with other microbrews: Foundation Afterglow, the Maine Beer is not regular ol Lunch (which I would have also happily taken), but a Tiny Beautiful Something. WTF????? I exaggerate not when I say, I was completely blown away and happier than a pig in _____.  The food was perfectly okay. Not the best meal I've ever had in my life, but definitely decent, and definitely better than a lot of other options in the area. I forget the bartender's name, but she had on some rad eyeliner and was wonderful. She was quick, attentive, suggested a good drink for the lady and just all around awesome.  Still though, that beer selection. There used to be Jimmy the Greeks, but since that closed, there's really nowhere else with a decent beer selection (aside from the Sebago/Seadog) in the mall area. I told my GF anytime she wants to spend some quality time at Marshall's/Homegoods, you know just where to drop me off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough
Rene C.,"Portland, ME",350,183,569,3.0,11/22/2017,"My wife and I were out and about picking up a few things before the big turkey day and decided to go to Red Robin for a late lunch. This was my first time here, however my wife had been once before when this store first opened. She could only remember ordering a milk shake. Anyway, I was interested in a burger and very intrigued by the advertisement of there endless fries. When we arrived we had to wait only a minute or two for the hostess to seat us. We were seated in a comfortable booth and our waitress was ready to take our drink order. We ordered waters with lemon and she promptly brought them to our table and took our appetizer order, onion rings and pretzel bits. Amazingly, our app order was delivered lickity split, the quickest I have ever had! Soon after that we ordered out main dishes. I got the famous cheese burger and my wife ordered the half-sandwich and soup deal, getting the French onion soup and the BLTT crousant. We both agreed that the pretzels were fantastic, however the onion rings were greasy and the batter crumbled off before you could eat rhem. Our waitress, who was awesome stopped by several times asking us how the meal was and if we needed anything else. We told her about the rings and she said she was sorry and latter on informed us she took the $5 charge for the rings off our bill. Kudos for her and RR for treating the customer right. My wife didn't care for the French onion soup, but not due to it being not prepared corretly. She had forgotten that it came with soaked bread. Well, I ended up with most of it and it was great! She did find her sandwich very good. My cheeseburger was okay. It was a tad over cooked and had that charbroiled flavor. I managed to rescue a few fries that were lightly toasted on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. The rest were over cooked and hard. Our wonderful waitress offered me some more and I declined. I was stuffed anyway. I more than likely would have taken her up on her offer had most of the fries been the ones I ate that were crispy on the,outside and gooey on the inside. I would say that due to the fact that there a Emre tons of choices to eat around, I probably won't be back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough
Cathy B.,"South Portland, ME",1,10,,4.0,11/20/2017,"Went to Red Robin on a weekday evening before 6 pm. Was pretty busy, but the wait was short and we sat in the bar and took advantage of a Happy Hour beer. I ordered the Avo-Cobb-O Salad (Cobb Salad) and it was the absolute best Cobb salad I have ever had. For $10.99 I received a very generous mixed greens base, topped with grilled chicken breast, bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, hard boiled egg, tomato, avocado, garlic toast and choice of dressing, all artfully displayed over the greens. I could not have asked for more and took a good portion of it home for later. Our server was very friendly, attentive, but not pushy.

CAMPFIRE SAUCE, check! (Seriously get the campfire sauce).  They also have a great rewards program. You get a free burger for your birthday month and every ten entrees you buy you get one free.  Their menu changes seasonally which is nice and keeps things interesting.  I also love the atmosphere. They are very kid friendly which is important to me. I also Like that they have lots of non-burger options and chicken and veggie burgers since I'm not a huge burger fan.

Mark M.,"Yarmouth, ME",18,118,142,4.0,10/24/2015,"Gourmet burgers is certainly true. So many unusual burgers to chose from. Skimpy on the french fry portion, but apparently they offer free refills on sodas and fries. Our waitress did not come back until we were finished, so I cannot confirm if this is actually the case at this restaurant or not. I got the Uberburger which has burger, bacon, bratwurst, cheese, lettuce, on a pretzel roll. I asked for it medium well and it was a bit past well done.

Rebecca A.,"Lisbon, ME",199,372,1193,3.0,1/10/2016,"I am always impressed that red robin comes out with new burgers that peak my interest, hello southern charm with candied bacon. Don't underestimate some of the awesome classics such as the whiskey river burger with bbq sauce and onion straws. Theres also the chophouse with mushrooms, al sauce, horeradish sauce onion straws and plenty of cheese. They will even serve your burger wrapped in lettuce rather than a bun. The endless fries as a side are a dream come true, especially with some campfire sauce. How can you go wrong with a creamy bacon sauce, more please.You can also substitue the fries for another side,such as the delcious cheesy gooey creamy mac n cheese, but it is not endless. I like the pick 2 appetizers. It's two small portions of some yummy fried foods such as jalapeno coin, mushroom, mozzarella sticks, onion rings.  They have decent drink selections and even make some of their own unique cocktails. The service is average to awesome. Some are all over the place but make sure you have what you need and others are filling your drinks and ordering you fries before you ask. The red robin club card is also a great investment.

There were several tables nearby visibly frustrated by the wait as well.

Seated at a table, I waited over 10 minutes for my server.  I ordered upon arrival cause who knows when she would come back!  Once again good food.  When the manager (I think) flew by asking how is everything, I said ""ok"" in a way I hoped he would follow up...nope!  Great he says and walks by.

I don't care for the traditional fries, so I usually opt for the sweet potato fries (which are AMAZING) or the steamed broccoli.

Diane P.,"Westbrook, ME",14,34,46,3.0,6/30/2015,"Burger and fries.....for a casual carnivore, those words conjure up imagery of juicy flavorful beef, crispy salted fries, and the right blend of toppings that make your mouth water.  Usually.  We have been to Red Robin multiple times and have fallen in love with one of their newest burgers,  Southern Charm.  We have always loved every other burger we have tried, this time, not. We opted for the Southern Charm that comes with candied bacon, onion, BBQ sauce, lettuce on a toasted bun with mayo. The other burgers we have had the pleasure of inhaling here have had flavor and were seasoned well.  This time, no seasoning at all, very bland.  Had to dip it in BBQ for flavor. The fries were crispy but also needed salt.  Amazing what a difference 2 simple spices can make, when used properly.  After being asked by the super friendly bartender, Katelyn, how the burger was and commenting in the lack of flavor and seasoning, she asked the GM, Nicole, came over and apologized but did nothing about it.  The bar manager, Brad,also came by to apologize and finally offered, as we were getting ready to leave, to replace it.  Way too late to save the experience by then.  The tip was definitely for service, not the food.  Common sense tip: if something isn't tasting the way it should or you just aren't happy with it, send it back, you are paying for it.  I expected a small adjustment to the bill, that did not happen.  If you don't really want to know if everything was ok with the meal, don't bother to ask me then do nothing about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough?start=20

Shane L.,"Scarborough, ME",326,289,621,4.0,11/24/2013,"While there are many different burger places around Portland/Scarborough to choose from, this is one that we came across while heading out for a team quick lunch.  While we had a party of 5, they were able to seat us very quickly in the dining area. The server on this day was very attentive and even at times over aggressive with drink refills and endless fries that come with each burger that is ordered. I had the avocado burger that was cooked perfectly at a medium temperature.  It seemed that they took the time to be exact with the order that I made along with no seasoning on the fries. There were no complaints of about any of the food that was ordered at the table but there were a couple of things that were more situational than anything else.  The server wanted us to join the Red Robin email rewards club so bad that he kept coming back to us over and over again even after we stated that we were not interested.  I eventually caved and signed up through the small iPad that they brought to the table but, by then the folks that I took to lunch were not impressed. The cleanliness of the restaurant was good with the attentiveness of the staff showed through as each table got up, they were there to immediately clean for the next table that sits. Now again, this is not your mom and pops burger joint, but is good for a quick and hearty burger to dive into at lunchtime.  The management and the waitstaff are friendly enough for a chain and you most likely wont leave unhappy (even though some of the reviews tell otherwise)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough?start=20

The appetizer was slow to arrive and the manager apologized and took it off our bill. Incidentally, we ordered the new Poutine and it was pretty bland -- I wouldn't get it again.   When the food eventually arrived, some of it had cooled, indicating that perhaps they had timing issues with the rest of the order (it was just my wife, my daughter, and me). I had the ""Big Pig Out,"" which is one of their new tavern burgers. The ""big"" part means that it's supposed to be one large burger patty instead of two smaller patties, but it was underwhelming and definitely not worth the extra $2-$3 for what seemed to essentially be the same amount of meat as the two patty burger. During the last visit we were at the restaurant for more than 90 minutes.

Greg H.,"Brunswick, ME",1,16,,2.0,8/22/2014,"I don't understand why it takes so long to get our food when there are fewer customers in the place than staff working. It took a really long time, given how few people were in the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough?start=40
Devin R.,"South Portland, ME",1,17,13,5.0,3/10/2014,"The bottomless root beer floats are simply fantastic, but the Blue Moon beer shake and the Guinness shake are the best!  Staff is always very accommodating, and they are great with kids.  Our kids always leave with a balloon (or two), and they start asking when we are coming back before we even get home.  The variety of burgers is impressive, and the staff is always quick to point out any special or limited time burgers.  We like the Peppercorn Burger, the Banzai Burger, and the fish and chips (which also comes as a ""burger"")  The first time we tried Red Robin, we were covered in paint and exhausted from a long weekend of home renovations, and they treated us like royalty.  We have never left disappointed!  This is our go-to family night out place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough?start=40

Sophie S.,"Taunton, MA",4,54,78,1.0,8/9/2013,"Went on a Friday afternoon on our way to gray, Maine. Long wait for waitress, had to ask for my husbands side salad, it was up to be served, waitress too busy talking & wrapping cutlery to notice. When food finally came, my onion straws we're cold. Sent them back, sandwich, chicken, was cold, but I was starving. My husbands burger was average, served on rye bread not a roll. Had to ask for coffee refill. Check dropped of, cash wasn't  cold in folder, she was there to grab it. Nothing angers me more than an absent waitress runs for the cash. She was surely disappointed with her 10% tip(only left a tip cuz my husband said we should, I would have left a penny) Our waitress really made this a bad experience. No more red robin for us!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough?start=40
Coleman Q.,"Portland, ME",0,7,1,3.0,9/20/2013,"Friendly staff, and good food. Wait was not long. Just a few small things that could have been better in my opinion. Bottomless Fries were a little slow and I wish they would have just kept them coming rather than me having to ask for them. Also while it was minor it seemed as the bartender was slow with getting orders for the tables which is no big deal but could be better. Last thing which was strange was that my water glass was never refilled once, it just was taken away about ten mins into service.  Just polishing up and this could be as Good as any other RR I have been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough?start=40
TJ S.,"Steep Falls, ME",5,2,,1.0,11/13/2012,"Don't expect them to do anything if they screw up your order. My burger was missing key ingredients and they didn't do anything but say ""Sorry"".

Ryan D.,"Crescent City, CA",3,35,6,3.0,7/4/2012,This place is a good burger joint with lots of choices. They even have a good gluten free bun and offer veggie patties which my wife loves. I recommend the BBQ Western burger.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough?start=40
Neal D.,"Salisbury, MA",16,5,,5.0,12/30/2012,"For a chain restaurant I really Like Red Robin, The burgers were out of this world and the waiter was very good, on point with every thing.  Would be a regular but it is too far.  hope I will get a chance to go back soon!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough?start=40

m b.,"Boston, MA",2,104,,1.0,6/26/2012,"Ok this is a long time coming-  this review is for all their locations.  I've had the misfortune of eating at some of these across the eastern seaboard because my kids like this place-  bc a few of them have tv's in the floor, and they have some shitty robin walking around- some ahole in a robin costume.  When your tagline is ""Gourmet Burgers"", then you better as hell be serving one hell of a burger!  instead- this places burgers SUCK!  they SUCK! (So bad it had to be stated twice!)  Low grade beef, poorly cooked/made, and just a total disaster.  The other food-  things like fried clam strips-  is actually better than the burgers, but still marginal chain food.  why in the world do we need so many of these stupid chain restaurants??  ill tell you why-  its a actually a pretty good indication of what our culture is like in all these ""franchise"" type areas.  bad food, bad service (run by teens of course), bad everything really.  just another joke of a franchise.  ""Gourmet Burgers""-  freakin hilarious!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scarborough?start=40
