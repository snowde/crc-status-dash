Gen I.,"Mantua, NJ",5,26,4,1.0,12/18/2016,"I went with myfamily and ordered a glass of wine. Being 42 with my 15 year old daughter with me I didn't think it would be a problem. I was carded and told that I could not have the wine. When asked for the manager, he was very rude and condescending.  He explained state law to me. Which I explained to him I understood. My problem was why being over 40 was I carded to begin with. His attitude and tone were very poor. My party of 6 left and took our business down the street.

Paul T.,"St. Johnsbury, VT",0,7,,1.0,11/9/2017,"Unfortunately, our party of four had an experience here that brought new meaning to the word ""pathetic"".  Upon receiving our menus, we asked for a copy of the dietary guide.  Seven minutes later, when asked when it was coming, our waitress replied, ""Oh, just a few more minutes.""  I complained to the manager that this was totally unacceptable, and he assured me it would be at the table forthwith.  The waitress showed up with her version of the dietary guide...a list of  the calories in the desserts.  She obviously had no idea what it was. Totally useless.  We had one person in the party who is extremely sensitive to salt.  That's all we needed, the sodium information.  Finally, the manager brought it to us.  The waitress seemed to have nothing but problems in taking our orders (uh, we were not that difficult a party, believe me), and we were assured that one of us could have burger and fries without the salt.  Well, three of the orders came out.  The saltless order did not.  We AGAIN spoke to the manager, who mentioned that the kitchen screwed it up, and she jumped in the line and made it herself for us...however, this was 10 minutes after the rest of the food had arrived. Let me sum up the rest of the evening...the manager again apologized and said we would not be charged for the meal.  Uh, we WERE charged for it, so we again complained.  What a horrible evening, truly.  The combined, almost concerted ineptness of the staff truly helped to ensure a negative experience.  We will never, ever set foot in a Red Robin again.  Ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale?start=20

David P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,184,,2.0,3/30/2016,"I've been a Red Robin customer since the mid 80s. But, those days are done. In the last couple years, sadly, they have gone down hill dramatically. This is true for locations not only in metro Phoenix but southern CA, too. Burgers seem smaller. I won't argue with their decision to change how they serve their ""endless"" fries. You can still have all you want - it's just a lot less likely that pounds and pounds of potatoes will go to waste like they must have in the past. The service is inconsistent. When I was last at this location, late on a weeknight, the place was dead. Many tables needed to be cleaned but no one seemed to care. I was seated in the bar area despite specifically asking for dining room. The bartender himself served me. He was nice, but he had a bar to tend. No doubt he (accurately) figured his better chance for tip money was his bar customers so I was a bit ignored with dirty tables all around me. I do appreciate they use real ice cream. Mixing chocolate and raspberry is simply amazing. Sadly, not all servers understand how to make this happen. Sometimes I get one flavor in the glass cup and the other in the metal cup. I didn't want a chocolate shake AND a raspberry shake. One time I got one flavor and my companion got the other. When they blend it right, then there is nothing better in life in terms of a milkshake. I can't think of the name of the automated interactive system they've implemented. I really do not like this. I could see the system being perfect in a busy bar for faster service and table turns. But, in Red Robin? Come on, just let a server come by and take my order. Let a runner serve me. Then check in from time to time without needing to be summoned - electronically or otherwise. Oh, and that tip calculator it has? Makes it easy to short the server because they aren't really servers any more. Too bad.  Many other choices now for much better burgers at not-too-much-more prices. And, those other places have human beings as servers who are polite and friendly. Kind of like what Red Robin used to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale?start=20

Forgets drink for one of us for over 5 min. 35 min later takes our order. Forgets one order and claims he dropped it in the kitchen and they're remaking. Brings us another tables extra fries order by mistake, forgets to bring any silverware or plates so we ask a passing manager so we can eat our appetizer. 2 hours for a dinner of burgers because of the crappy service. We live a mile away and probably won't be back.

The buns were soggy, my burger was supposed to be ""some pink"" but was more like a hockey puck (super well done). I ordered extra crispy fries but there was no seasoning on them and several of them were burnt....which is sad because that's never been a problem before. My husband got a Royal Burger and he said it was ok but felt like they must be using cheaper ingredients....I'm gonna have to agree. I think we'll just go to one of the breweries around here....it's a couple bucks more expensive but it definitely tastes better. Sorry Red Robin, we won't be back.

Service is normally quick and the service is almost always good. They're able to keep good servers over time, and many of them can guess our orders. Always nice. Huge plus for fluten-free options.

I asked for a side of blue cheese dressing. I was told ""I'll be right back with that ""; the server then proceeded to stand and talk with the manager. We waited several minutes to see if he was going to bring the requested item. All the while my food was cooling! My husband then got up and reminded him of my request. A few minutes later the dressing finally arrived.

Marc T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",522,129,361,2.0,9/1/2012,"Well, damn. Until tonight, all of our experiences at Red Robin had been positive. Even at this location, our past meals had been enjoyable. Tonight, though...tonight left a sour taste in my mouth. That's not to say that the food was bad...it was actually pretty good. But the service was atrocious. We thought it was our lucky day when we walked right in on a Saturday night and sat right down at 7:00. We ordered our appetizer and drinks. The waiter, Cameron, came back and took our order a few moments later. Our appetizer came out in record time! We had hardly taken a few bites of our hummus plate, and then our food came out! Like I said...the food was good. So, where was the horrible service? The food was there fast, hot, and it was good. What could have bothered me so much? Well, I don't think the waiter said more than a dozen words to us. It seemed like he was late for something very important, and we were his last obstacle to overcome before he was able to free himself from the self-imposed bonds of servitude to Red Robin. Customarily, the waiter comes around after the food arrives and asks how things tasted. This guy didn't show up until our food was gone, our drinks were gone, and we were ready for the check and couple of to-go boxes. He begrudgingly gave me a refill on my drink before he dropped off the check. Now, granted, we don't ever get desert in a restaurant...but this guy didn't even give us the satisfaction of turning down his delicious sounding proposal. The whole process felt like we were imposing on this kid. We were in and out of the restaurant in less than 30 minutes.  This guy robbed us of the entire restaurant experience. If you can't enjoy the experience, then why go? It will definitely be a while (if ever) before I visit this location again. But I can promise that I'll avoid this kid like the plague if he's still ""working against his will"" at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale?start=40
Jean S.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",26,124,34,3.0,12/15/2015,Awfully pricey. We both had their French onion soup. The best part was the bread and cheese. The broth watery and tasteless.

Like when my lunch buddies at work want to drag me to Applebee's or Chili's or some junk like that for lunch, I'll compromise with Red Robin. We're still talking junky food from all the same venders but at least they have bottomless steak fries and other perks.   The biggest advantage of eating here is that I can get a Royal Red Robin Burger. Basically this means a regular hamburger with an egg laid on top of it. How awesome is that? If you know anything about me, you know that I love fried eggs on top of anything; pancakes, beef, asian rice bowls, anything!  Okay so yeah, the egg, it's awesome. Let's talk about what's not awesome. Lettuce. Order this thing without lettuce and you will thank me in the morning. I mean something so beautiful is an egg on a hamburger doesn't need to be ruined by warm vegetation! The description says crisp lettuce? That is lies and we both know it. Just say no to lettuce.   Some other ideas for this sandwich are: Sprinkle some of that Red Robin seasoning on it. It's pretty good. Order it with a chocolate milkshake. That can't be bad.  Oh and Red Robin's has a pretty sweet deal where their French fries are all you can eat, or as I like to call it, the kids eat for free special. So if you have like 20 effin' kids, please take them here and feed them all these French fries, meanwhile you get to mow down on this tasty sammich.

Didn't help that the restaurant was 4% full. It's hard keeping track of all 2 of your tables, isn't it? I enjoyed my fish burger, but not my fries. I ended up eating some of my fries because well...I was hungry and it was clear she wasn't going to come back after she dumped the bill on us. Oh wait, she did come back as I was halfway through my food (I am a slow eater) and tried to take my friggin plate away. Why didn't I enjoy my fries? It looked and tasted like the kitchen had taken old fries and refried them. :( ""Oh, I'm sorry. I totes thought you were done!"" *insert insipid airhead giggle here* I had food in my hands and I was chewing. What gave her the idea I was done? I couldn't even ask for water because my mouth was full. I should've because I ran out of water...and I was thirsty by the time the meal ended.

They had issues getting his confirmation code to work though and instead of being helpful- like just giving the free appetizer- they said they couldn't do anything to help us and gave my dad some RR card help line to call, even though by then it was closed.. They did not offer us the appetizer and weren't very helpful.  Then we ordered drinks which took a while and then we finally got to order dinner. The dinner came out and I had a smaller burger but it still came with bottomless fries. Me, being the fry-lover that I am ate all of my (smaller portion) of fries. I asked for more. We waited for 20 mins and still no fries. I eventually had the server cancel the extra order (since they were to be bottomless) and got the check. It was poor service on their part. The server did apologize after I asked for the check. He ignored us for the most part though, which made me mad since it wasn't busy in the bar area at all.

The burgers are restaurant burgers; a bit better than McDonald's or similar, but nowhere near what I can do at home, and more costly. Nothing here sets it apart from any other mediocre restaurant style burger place.   Of the two times I've eaten here, I once had the burger come pink -extremely- pink (like, 'rare'; I asked for medium. I think it was just rushed out of the kitchen because I ordered later than the rest of my party. If you don't like that, explicitly state 'no pink'), and the other time, there was a misunderstanding what I wanted (I asked for the Royal Red Robin burger, the waitress said ""You mean the cheeseburger?"" I didn't have the menu any more, and didn't remember if it had cheese on it or not, so said ""Uh...I guess?"" Apparently not), which wasn't exactly the restaurants fault, but was still really weird and kinda made it less appealing.

Kristin S.,"Charlestown, MA",359,544,44,3.0,5/8/2007,"After a morning of condo hunting my husband and I were starving. We pulled into the first strip mall we found and it turned out to be one with a Red Robin. I'm not normally a chain kind of person but times were desperate. I was surprised at how good my turkey burger was (why its listed as ""Adventuresome"" I don't know...) but it was enjoyable. My husband enjoyed his burger very much, polishing off the entire thing. The best thing about Red Robin is the bottomless steak fries!!!  It's a diner type place that focuses almost solely on burgers. They have a salad menu but its very limited. It kind of reminded me of Fudruckers, only slightly less greasy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale?start=80
Patrick D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",25,4,,5.0,4/27/2013,This is literally the best restaurant in the world. Make sure you ask for fries before your burger gets there. All the burgers are amazing and the chicken sandwiches are amazing too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale?start=80
Jon D.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,69,8,4.0,8/21/2010,"Red Robin has the best burgers in America, at least as far as commonplace chains go. They have wraps, salads, and chicken sandwiches, too, but I've only had the burgers and they're awesome. I was sadly disappointed to find that they stopped serving the Santa Fe cheeseburger or whatever it was called, but the Guacamole Bacon cheeseburger is a nice alternative. The fries are plentiful (supposedly they are refillable for free? I dunno, I'm usually too stuffed with the burger to find out) but a bit too salty and greasy. The sodas are too watered down right off the bat, perhaps due to the ice. The waitresses are friendly (and very nice to look at) but going there alone I feel slightly rushed as they hand me my cheque as soon as I start on the fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale?start=80
A. L.,"Dublin, CA",42,78,14,4.0,12/27/2011,"Went to this location yesterday. It was pretty slow in terms of business but had a good experience. We sat in the bar and the bartender was really nice. He was funny and made our experience quite pleasant. The host at the front was friendly, too. The food is great and priced perfectly. We didn't wait more than 15 minutes for our food to be made and it came out hot and fresh, and of course it was delicious. My favorite appetizer is the towering onion rings! We also enjoyed the happy hour. I'd recommend this Red Robin! There wasn't anything wrong with our experience, but it wasn't outstanding, either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale?start=80
C. S.,"Queen Creek, AZ",0,65,2,1.0,3/31/2010,Their glassware and utensils always smell. I can't put my finger on it but they smell bad. We have tried to eat at this location a few times but always end up making the trek to the Red Robin on Mayo.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale?start=80
