Dana J.,"Maplewood, MN",10,78,55,5.0,11/30/2017,"Went there two weeks ago with the boyfriend and my dad. We were told it'd be a 20-30 minute wait (Typical for a Friday evening), but were seated in about 10-15. Our server was GRACE, and she was AMAZING! Normally I don't rant and rave about specific people, but she went above and beyond! She was patient with us, answered questions, very friendly, but professional. Had excellent recommendations. She always kept our drinks full, and endless fries coming! She even offered to let us try one of their famous sauces, (Campfire sauce?!) and it was so delicious! I have the grilled chicken teriyaki burger with grilled pineapple, and the flavors were on point. MY only two complaints about the entire experience is; 1- Coke products 2- bun got a little soggy-couldn't been a little toasted Ask for Grace if you go to this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview
Jennifer B.,"Minneapolis, MN",64,143,440,3.0,12/18/2017,"I remember when this place was first built and my friend who worked here used to dress up as the big Robin mascot! Good times. I had not eaten at a Red Robin since then but I remember the burgers being greasy. This past visit I was surprised by how busy it was, the place was packed. We had reservations for 6 people and only waited about 10 mins. So overall the food was ok. Server was very friendly and efficient. I ordered the Red Robin Gourmet Burger with cheddar cheese. The sweet pickle relish stood out otherwise there wasn't anything special to it. Garlic fries were yummy- wide cut with minced garlic and parmesan cheese. Side of fries served with the burgers was small (~10 fries) but the free refill side was large. Noise level in the restaurant was very loud. At the end they have convenient tablets to pay at the table and even print your receipt. For a low key group dinner it worked great but I won't be coming back on my own anytime soon, just not my vibe and there's too many other good burger places out there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview
Joelle A.,"Saint Paul, MN",37,6,1,5.0,12/27/2017,"The burgers here are great. I've NEVER had a bad meal here. The bottomless basket of fries, is ingenious! Our waitress, Shawn, (we've had her a few times) never fails at being the best waitress! She always finds the best deals for us, because we are ""frequent patrons"" to Red Robin.

Dan F.,"Spring, TX",147,385,419,3.0,6/9/2017,"I will tell you straight, the burgers are over priced.  The burgers are ok but the patty tends to be thin and at this price they should be a bit more meaty.  I go here usually due to location (that old adage is right on) or a friend wants to go.  The beers can be big, which is good but pricey.  The service was ok, but the waitress was tired and hey, that happens and I don't need a show, but if she would have asked how I was doing would have been nice.  I am not a cheap guy, I can ball with the best of them, but I like a deal - you dig me yelpers, I know you do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview

I feel gipped.. the salmon burger was decent .. I ordered from Amazon restaurant delivery and they also did not have the fact the garlic herb fries have parmeson on them and I'm lactose intolerant.. that isn't Red Robins fault I don't think.. more amazons. but it was a bummer..  mostly  they were super cheap on the amount of soup they have in a ""bowl"" size.. worth near 6.00. definately not worth it for a few spoons ful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview
Stephanie K.,"Minneapolis, MN",94,322,196,3.0,4/14/2017,"Red Robin has some really nice things to offer. It has a huge menu with a million options, which can oftentimes serve as a red flag. You get a lot of choices regarding your meat and your bun, for example. Overall, I thought the food was good.  The unlimited sides and milkshakes is a bit of a joke because it'll take forever to get them and that's more food than anyone should be eating. Overall, I just didn't love this place because of the atmosphere. It has all the class of an Applebees.  I'd rather go to Red Cow for a burger at the same price with a much hipper/cleaner vibe.  I did really like how customizable the kid menu is. You get a lot of different choices for entrees and sides and some are even healthy!  Good luck getting your kid to eat unlimited fills of broccoli, however, when everyone else is eating burgers and fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview

Amy R.,"Saint Paul, MN",308,1266,1214,3.0,2/20/2016,"This place used to be really good. Not this visit. Apparently my name is difficult. The server asked me X3 what my name was and still after awhile didn't have my name on the wait list. Eek.  We were stuffed at a small booth. Luckily our little one fit in. Still crammed. With the onslaught of menus, the little mini ipad/pay station, seasonings and all the other hooey on the table, it made it pretty tight and packed. Food was ok. Took a loooooong time to come out. For what we ordered it should not have taken almost 50 min. Endless fries means endless wait times. Refills were pretty scarce. The mini ipad/pay station is a pain. Since when do we have to do our own check outs. Not to mention a 1.99 entertainment fee. Really? We didn't use that thing. Just really disappointed on this visit. Probably won't return in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview
Tiffany C.,"Maplewood, MN",50,3,1,5.0,8/15/2017,"This place is always very busy. When we went there tonight we sat at our table for over 20 minutes without waitstaff taking a drink order. We decided to leave. We spoke with the manager and not only was she very apologetic she paid for our meal, and our meal was out within minutes. Our waitress Katie K, was incredibly attentive and we never went more than 10 minutes without being checked on. This was over and beyond what they needed to do to fix the situation, and they were kind the entire time. What started as a not so happy Situation turned into a place that I will always recommend to people. Thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview
Riley N.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,18,1,5.0,2/3/2017,"My boyfriend and I went last Friday right during dinner rush, there was a wait- to be expected. But we grabbed a few spots at the bar and were promptly served. The bartender was one of the highlights of the experience. He was knowledgeable and offered great suggestions since I had never been before.  The food was also great, the fry portion was small, and at first I was bummed, until I learned that IT IS UNLIMITED FRIES. How could someone not love this place? Also when we ordered a beer we were asked ""short, tall or extra large"" ..... Extra large?! What  a cool option. We will be back :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview

Kelsey P.,"Minneapolis, MN",164,155,129,4.0,1/6/2016,"All my life, I thought Red Robin was a fast food joint. You learn something new every day! While admittedly, it's miles from gourmet, the food was pretty damn good! Lots of selection for burgers, and more salads than a lot of places (I think there were 8 or 9?)! I had the Bonzai Salad, which was romaine with carrots and almonds and cabbage and teriyaki chicken, with a delightful ale vinaigrette. It felt ...heavy and left me feeling satisfied for the whole afternoon! When I got back to the office I looked up the nutrition and there were only 450ish calories. Including dressing! Whaaat! I think I just found my new guilty pleasure! Service was a little slower than I would have expected, for how few people were dining, I'd be nervous to see what it's like on an evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview
Mike B.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,192,1,2.0,9/14/2016,"Incredibly loud.  This is apparently a thing that some kinds of restaurant think is attractive. They are wrong.  It just indicates their budget for sound deadening material is inadequate. The ""bottomless fries"" would be nice if the server ever came back to give you more of them.  The burger setups are quite good--shame that the burgers they put into them are mediocre.  It is also kind of expensive for what you're getting. I haven't been able to figure out why the parking lot is always full when you can cross 694 and go to Five Guys for better burgers, better fries, and less noise all at a lower price.  I've only gone twice since they opened so maybe they've gotten a lot better.  I will probably never find out, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview
Lilly P.,"Minneapolis, MN",2,41,14,2.0,8/27/2016,"Normally we enjoy this location, however our services tonight was very sub par.

Aurora R.,"Circle Pines, MN",57,3,,3.0,3/13/2017,"Our waitress seemed to do a lot of walking around looking busy; as far as checking in on us, she met the bare required check ins. The location was decently busy (but our waitress didn't appear to have many tables- we noticed two other tables with like two people). The food was spot on and the blended alcoholic beverage was on point!! I would recommend the place, as long as you're not a very needed eater as the wait staff we had was a little too busy looking with her Fitbit steps than checking on her customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview

After this experience I don't think we will be back.  We ended up taking our food home to eat due to the fact that our son needed to be at work by 8pm.

Jesse M.,"St Paul, MN",6,43,35,4.0,2/9/2016,"Red Robin is a great burger place. It's not gourmet but it's solid, and you get all you can eat steak cut fries! I have heard more than one person I've been with say that the burgers are sort of bland. This is true but it's because they don't salt the meat. Try this: Open your burger bun, take some of the house seasoned salt on the table and generously shake it on. Now try your burger. It makes a world of difference.  The place is way too packed and you'll wait over a 1/2 hour if you go at peak times so be prepared and forewarned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview
Kim G.,"Cloquet, MN",0,57,56,3.0,10/29/2016,"Not so great tonight. We drive a very long way to come here, and usually have a great meal, but tonight was not one of them. They were busy, and we were seated at a red table that was in everyone's way. Our onion rings were not hot- I saw them sitting for a good 5 minutes, as I was facing the food window and very close up. Our server comped them. My whiskey river garden burger was totally greasy; I have had this at least 4 times but tonight it was gross. They put way too much mayo on typically, and my husband had the whiskey river chicken sandwich which was swimming in mayo as well. We really enjoy Red Robin, and will return, but tonight was not it's best effort.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=20
Scott E.,"Colorado Springs, CO",26,339,46,3.0,4/2/2015,"After singing the jingle for years...Yummmm!, it was time to experience Red Robin. We wondered in around 7PM on a Thursday. The place was moderately full. It is a cross between an Applebees and Upscale hotel bar. Instantly greeted by a college boy. He sat us in the bar in front of the big screens airing hockey. He said that he would be there to help us if we needed it, but that Nessa would be our server. I will divided this review into four categories: 1 - Look and feel.  Four stars for clean, modern and inviting. 2 - Service was one star. While Nessa was great, she was overworked or overwhelmed by the number of tables she had to serve. Her smile was real, her insight for first timers was spot on and her attention after the food arrived and swiftly getting our check was excellent. Once we were seated it was 14 minutes before water was brought to the table. With the wings, there were no napkins or utensils. I asked the host and he brought over some napkins and forks, and said they were ""out of knives"". This was a new reply for me. Apparently Red Robin needs to cut back a bit on advertising and invest in some cutlery. The food did arrive quickly and hot.  3 - Food was four-five stars. Excellent. Impressive. While the wings are small (where do they find chickens that tiny?), they were perfectly cooked. We had bone-in plain batter with their BBQ and spin on buffalo sauce. So yummy. The homemade potato chips that are served with the wings are delicious. We will be back just for this appetizer. We shared the Royal Red Robbin Burger with endless steak fries. This burger had the over easy egg on it. Very good. The fries were awesome. Congrats to the kitchen staff for delivering great food.  4 - Other stuff: Beer list is ok, but no Grain Belt Premium on tap or bottles.  Parking is in a large stand alone lot. Bathrooms are clean. Large full service bar.  Overall a three, but if service improves, an easy four star experience.  We will be back when we have LOTS OF TIME to wait and we will be sure to be properly hydrated before entering. Food is that good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=20
C G.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,1,,3.0,4/30/2017,Food was ok when it arrived.  Had to ask where our appetizer was and it was then delivered luke-warm.  They were busy but not unusually busy.  Burgers tasted good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=20
Dan A.,"Minneapolis, MN",7,121,56,1.0,11/25/2015,"Under cooked burger.  Wimpy fries.  Seriously overpriced for what is a crappy drive-in burger.   You can get same thing, and sooner, and for $4.99 at Sonic.  Not that you want that either but you would be half less unhappy paying $5 - than paying $10.89 for a cold cheeseburger.

Abe M.,"St Paul, MN",154,332,114,2.0,1/18/2012,"I went here with the family for the first time over the weekend and I am stumped as to why this place is always full. I wasn't feeling that need to pound down a burger, so I ordered some Game Day Nachos instead. I think that's where I went wrong. These had to be the worst nachos I've ever had. Fake cheese is never good on nachos. The chips were so salty, I could only eat about four before calling it quits. About the only thing half good on the nachos was the presentation. The atmosphere is very busy and loud with kids all around. It almost gives it a chaotic feel. But hey, at least they are kid friendly and the service was alright too.

Apparently RR has Gourmet and Fine Gourmet burgers....who pays attention to the categories?!  :) The difference IS....the Fine are 1/2 lb burgers rather than 1/3 lb.... Neither of us finished ours, which is the norm, so it wasn't indicative of the bigger burger...sorry.  So the gal said she would have to talk to the manager.  As we waited for him to come to our table...already set ourselves up for the No......  The gal came back with the check and the manager just took the discount off!!  THANK YOU!!  Rather than quibble with patrons over a few $ difference he took care of it.  Alleviating any issues.  THANK YOU Red Robin, looking forward to my next tasty burger from a friendly staff!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=20

Sharifah I.,"Saint Paul, MN",4,19,6,4.0,4/2/2016,"I've eaten here plenty of times with different experiences good and bad in food, staff, wait times, etc. This review is based on my experience from yesterday. We got there around 4:30ish and was seated right away. It didn't take long for our waitress to come out. It wasn't that busy at that point. Our drinks that weren't made at the bar came out quickly. My mom's pickled pear lemonade took longer but a plain vanilla shake for my five year old took over 20 minutes to get. The appetizer and the meals themselves took long enough to come out as well probably due to how busy it was at the restaurant. I was concerned since people who had arrived after us got drinks and appetizers before us. They messed us the burger my mom ordered and offered to fix it and not charge us for it. The Red Robin rewards are nice to since every so often we'll get a free burger which we did last night. The burgers are decent, gourmet...no.

(same thing happened our last visit.. and the one before that..) At least this time the service was good. The waitress was nice but was quite busy due to it being dinner rush.

They give out free balloons to the kids and sing a song for you if its your birthday. If you are into a full bar and beer on tap; they have that too. Overall it's a great place for a burger.

Miles strolled up to the table and called my fiance ""boss"" - immediate no-no. It took forever for our drinks to arrive, and my mom's sandwich didn't arrive with the correct bread because Miles neglected to tell her that they were out. Are all of these things understandable? Sure. But you see, a GOOD server will stop by your table and let you know some of these things -- ""Hey, I'm really sorry, it looks like the bar is short-staffed.

He never actually stopped at our table after the food was delivered. He just breezed by and asked if everything was okay, never actually waiting for an answer before he moved on. Very unprofessional. As a person that formerly worked in the restaurant business, I thought to myself, 'Shouldn't that kind of hospitality be commonplace for a server?' Yet Miles didn't do any of these things. Hence why he ended up with a collective tip from the 3 of us, of less than 5%. Get Miles out of there, and hire quality staff please, that know how to wait tables.

(We all work at Target HQ) We had about 8 of us there and I was the only one to order a Southwest Chicken Salad, which was awesome. The chicken was perfectly cooked, nice and juicy with a wonderful bed of lettuce and some fried jalepeno on the side. I finished it all, but it could easily be a salad for two. There nice slices of avacado and they gave me my dressing on the side, awesome. Everyone else got a burger and everyone seemend to like it. They had fries coming on whenever you wanted it and my Diet Coke was refilled on a solid pace. I tried a couple sweet potatoe fries and they were very nice with the saltiness mixing with the sweetness of the sweet potatoe. My salad was about 8 minutes later than all the other dishes, so a co-worker said that it was a lot later than everyone, so they comped me the salad. (I made sure to tip the servers, because it wasn't their fault) but the classiness of the business to reconize something that went wrong goes a long way. They had no idea that I was a big Yelper, so their big step up to make things right really went a long way. The place was packed at lunch time, so they must be doing something right.

Dawn S.,"St Paul, MN",0,94,,5.0,3/18/2013,"I give Red Robin 5 stars because of the vegetarian burger option. They have boca and gardenburger.  The boca burger has a smoke flavor and a nice texture, a good vessel for the ""burger"" toppings. I have never understood why all restaurants that serve burgers do not always offer a boca burger in place of beef.  You just keep them in the freezer until someone orders.  I HATE black bean burgers because of the seasonings; if I want cumin and taco flavors, I'll go to a Mexican restaurant and order tacos...   So, in my opinion, other burger joints should lose the black bean burger and just stock the boca burgers. For us, the service has always been average to above average.  Nothing to complain about. I do like their sides options.  If you don't want their bottom-less steak fries (and who wouldn't), they do have a side salad, steamed broccoli, sweet potato fries, and a bunch of others as options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=40

The bar's okay but nothing to write home about. And the prices seem high given the dining experience and the quality of the food. My three favorite places for hamburgers are Blue Door, Groveland Tap and the Nook/Shamrock. Food quality is far better, IMO. Ambience is quirkier, reflecting the independent ownership vs corporate-dictated decorating. Prices actually seem slightly lower. The wait-staff are always great and know what they're doing and what's working (or not) in the kitchen or at the tap. Yeah, it takes me 10-15 minutes longer to drive there and parking at those places isn't as convenient.

Kim R.,"Saint Paul, MN",91,359,298,3.0,4/2/2013,"I'm not huge on chain restaurants, so I had never tried Red Robin before this past weekend when some friends suggested meeting for lunch.  This place is pretty big, and the service was great. The menu is very extensive so everyone should be able to find something that suits their fancy. I'm not a red-meat eater, so I steered clear of all of the burger options. After reading a review on Yelp, I decided to try the Whiskey River Chicken wrap with a cup of chicken tortilla soup. The wrap had really nice flavor from the BBQ sauce and ranch, but the chicken was not very hot... The soup I would definitely not order again. It tasted like it was from a can and the flavor was overpowered by too much cumin. We started our meal with the pretzel bites. I was super pumped to try these, because who doesn't like a pretzel with cheese sauce?? Unfortunately, the cheese sauce was not great, it was a little thick and goupy. I  preferred the whole-grain mustard sauce. There was something different about the pretzels themselves, they almost tasted deep fried...

It's a burger place, I have to talk about the 'gourmet' burgers right?   Ok, here's my take on the burgers.  Less beef than I remember, less beef/burger flavor, more food service bun, more cheese, food service bacon-the salty transparent kind you can almost see through.

B.  Where was the great service so many rave about?  The menu said I got free refills on my steak fries.   The waitress did not return to my table (it was 8 pm, not busy) until I was finished eating.  That means my water didn't get refilled, nor my fries.  This is great service.  Oh, when she dropped off the food she literally returned 15 seconds later to ask how the food was.  I hadn't even tried it yet.  ""looks good"" ??

My husband's birthday and my birthday are three days apart and as email members of Red Robin's birthday club, we each receive a coupon around the same time every year for a free burger and fries--the only thing you pay for is your beverage.  You also receive a complementary sundae and unless you LIKE clapping and singing, you can usually opt out of the usual dog and pony show if your server isn't a tool (and since they haven't received their tip yet, chances are good they'll do whatever you ask).   We found ourselves at the location in Plymouth recently while waiting for our second car to come out of the shop.  It was one of those days where it was snowing {again}, it was an hour and a half past lunch, both adults were ""hangry"" and even more critical, Toddler F. was also wet, hungry and desperate to get out of her car seat.  We'd been driving around aimlessly until we turned a corner and saw the Red Robin.  Hello, lifesaver!  When all was said and done, 2 enormous burgers w/fries + 2 sodas + 1 kid meal of mac & cheese, steamed broccoli and milk + tip = about $41.  And lifesaver or no, that's not exactly a deal.   This week, also known as birthday week at the F. house, we went to the Shoreview location because it is closer to home where 2 enormous burgers w/fries + no soda (NY resolutions) + 1 kid meal of mac & cheese, steamed broccoli and milk + 2 sundaes + tip = about $12 (remember to tip on the full value of the meal, yo!)  And that *is* a deal!   Until the little one came along, I'd never paid close attention to the décor or RR flair but my munchkin LOVES the carousel horses mounted in the dining area.  RR also has balloons near the hostess stand and when we walked into the entry my kid immediately began flirting with the young woman at the hostess stand and earned a pink RR balloon for her efforts which provided entertainment during the meal, the car ride home and at home as well.  Family friendliness is an important factor for me these days so I appreciated the gesture.   Over the past several years, I would guesstimate my attendance to RR at around 15 visits and most of the time the food is consistently pretty good.  Occasionally it is really good and one time it was not so great which I guess is how it goes at these kinds of places.   I'm having a hard time deciding between a rating because the cost of the food generally has an impact on how I'd rate the experience.   4 stars = free RR burger 3 stars = full price RR burger Overall I'm going to go with three.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=60

Dennis L.,"St Paul, MN",30,42,,4.0,2/4/2011,"Love that egg on the burger. The Royal Red Robin was the first burger I had with a fried egg on top. Of course now I've had plenty of similar burgers in other restaurants, but I'll always have fond memories of the first that popped my egg burger cherry. I believe there are only two or three in the entire metro area so finding one of these burger chains nearby maybe difficult. It may be worth it to some people to travel for those unlimited fries that come with every burger though. Unfortunately for me, I'm usually too full after the burger to order another round of those fries (one of these days, it will happen)!  They do have pretty good onion rings as well. It comes out on a giant cone with a couple sauces and it's not an uncommon starter to have right away. Overall, they are not bad in my book!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=80
Kore P.,"Plymouth, MN",63,93,60,4.0,4/21/2011,Red Robin is a nice place to have a burger with the family. They have a nice variety of burgers and endless french fries. Their burgers are above average and one of the better choices on this end of town. Lots of families with kids and a loud room. Service is prompt and consistently good. Great place to cure that burger fix.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=80
M L.,"Lorton, VA",2,22,8,4.0,12/15/2013,"We've eaten at this Red Robin twice now, and we love their food.  I always leave satisfied. The burnin love burger is my favorite! It's not too spicy, but it has just the perfect zing to it. However, the service here isn't anything to write home about.  Our waitress today was very slow and seemed a little snotty. Other than that, no complaints",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=80
Jacque U.,"St Paul, MN",79,231,2,4.0,3/28/2011,"For a chain, my hubby & I have a pretty great love for Red Robin.  I've been to many of their stores and really haven't had a bad experience.  Saturday lunch was no exception. Our family of 3 went to celebrate daughter's birthday (she's 2) with a casual lunch before nap time.  She could probably honestly care less where we ended up so this was more of a mom & dad pick.  She had the kids cheeseburger with apple slices.  I really like that there is a good selection of sides for the kids meals.  Most places it's fries or yogurt.  Here its fries, oranges, apples slices, broccoli, and like 2 other things. I had the Blue Ribbon Burger and Hubby had the Luau.  The luau was pretty standard.  He's a communist who hates condiments so it only had the teriyaki sauce on it.  My burger was good though I had a hard time finding the blue cheese under all that chipolte mayo at first.  The fries were fine as usual. My standard is the Whiskey River Chicken Wrap and I probably should have stayed with that.  I love the flavor and the crunch of the tortilla strips in the wrap.  There was nothing wrong with my burger but I love the wrap for a reason. Also, Red Robin himself was there which daughter got a kick out of.  She kind of stalked him all around the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=80
Norton L.,"Shoreview, MN",19,128,25,5.0,5/20/2008,"This is the second of my post-birthday reviews and yes, I concede this is a chain review (see my disclaimer below). Red Robin is a burger joint.  They have a few unique ""flavors"" of burgers as well as the classics and they are all good, tasty, and huge.  Their steak fries aren't that much better than fries from a freezer case--until you add their seasoning salt.  Then they taste much better.  Plus, the fries are all-you-can-eat, so you can indulge yourself as much as you want. But the reason for this review is for two specific menu items.  The first is their onion rings.  They come stacked in a tower like one of those baby ring toys with two sauces.  One is a ranch sauce and the other is one that I would describe to you if I had any talent in describing tastes.  Just believe me when I say it's yummy. The other menu item I love at RR is their freckled lemonade.  It's pink lemonade with cut up strawberries in it.  I'm not a huge fan of instant lemonade, but it's taken to a whole 'nother level when you add fresh strawberries to it.  It's pricey at $3.99, but it's bottomless and I drink as much as I can when I'm there. Since I was there on my birthday, I got a free ice cream and hot fudge  dessert with a pile of whip cream.  RR is one of those places that chooses to embarrass you with clapping and singing at your table as penance for your dessert, but I was fortunate that there were an extraordinary number of those last night and by the time they got to me, our waiter just handed the dessert to me and said, ""happy birthday."" The dinner topped off a fun evening with my family and I can't complain about a greasy, sloppy, artery-clogging meal. ----- Chain review disclaimer:  I won't do 'em.  You can't make me.  Well, ok.  Yes, you can.  But not easily.  I've sworn off chain reviews because chains are supposed to be the same wherever you go.  That's the beauty of a chain restaurant.  So I'll only do a review if there is something out of the norm for a chain, or the particular location.  This will happen if there is something unique, if they are extraordinarily good, or extraordinarily bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=80

Colin M.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,38,,4.0,5/8/2013,"First time I've eat Red Robins.  Was very impressed.  Since I'm a vegetarian, I ordered their veggie burger.  It was one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had.  The fries were also excellent.  Also great service.  I would def eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=80
Jeff Z.,"St Paul, MN",2,25,,2.0,7/20/2012,"I went there 2 weeks ago and ordered a double cheeseburger. It was cold. I had to send it back. It was cold again. They messed it up twice. The only good thing about Red Robin is there refillable steak fries. They were the only part of my meal that was hot. They also told me this ""The smaller patties will tend to get colder faster."".I wish that she would have told me that sooner. The Manager tries to get me to order something else. Like the Half pounder. I think. What are the chances they'll mess it up again? 100% in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=80
Steve W.,"Andover, MN",15,100,,5.0,8/1/2007,"Yes, I know this is a chain and all chains are bad (according to some), but as a vegetarian I can't say that I've had a better garden burger anywhere else!  They even have two options for meatless patties, a Boca burger type (more meaty) and a Garden Burger (more grainy).  My personal preferrence is the Garden burger patty. I get the 5-alarm burger with the Garden Burger patty and my wife always gets the Whisky River BBQ burger with the same; both of us swear ours is the bets.  The fries are really good and their salt seasoning is pretty good too.  We travel with a full crew (four kids) and it's a great place for families.

Allison M.,"Washington, DC",6,27,,4.0,11/16/2009,"Red Robin is like that comfy sweatshirt you wear on the weekend after a long week of business suits. Its a place where you can get good burgers and fries and sit back and relax with your friends without worrying about things like calories, vegetables, and oh-so-fancy silverware.  I had the Bayou burger, and it was exactly what I hoped for: excellent roasted peppers and onions on a burger that was cooked to order with a decent bun. On top of that, the fries were not bad and came as a bottomless basket.  I cannot give this place a five because of the price. I know good burgers can cost me, but it still feels like they are padding it for the gimmick. Its like buying the Abercrombie sweatshirt when there are plenty of other options. Still, this place is fun and relaxing. And if you need some bottomless fries and a good burger, this is definitely the place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=80
