Allison B.,"Slidell, LA",76,1,,3.0,11/14/2017,"Had really great service with the best waiter, however the restaurant was dirty. Went for a later lunch on a weekday and only maybe had about 5 tables with customers. Only 2 waiters and it was also brought to our attention that the ""big boss"" was in house. You'd think if they had corporate there, they would clean up the tables immediately and not have their hostesses sitting and goofing around in the front of the place.  We just ended up ordering from the $6.99 burger menu, which was not bad for the price. I mainly enjoyed their spiked freckled lemonade with was amazing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell
Jess C.,"Gretna, LA",147,240,565,1.0,1/7/2018,"SAVE YOUR COINS.... this was the most dry terrible burgers and to top it off it was a $43 bill for a beer and two burgers... you basically order and pay on your own through a computer on the table but it prompts you to tip like a full service restaurant.

Nate H.,"Mandeville, LA",235,208,394,2.0,10/16/2016,"Very disappointing. I had been wanting to try Red Robin for years but have never lived near one. It seems I have not been missing much. They have a great looking menu. Several burgers, sandwiches and plates available. The shakes look really good. I ordered the BBQ burger. Can't remember what they call it. Very underwhelming. The cheese on the burger wasn't melted and was hard and the burger was drowning in runny BBQ sauce. The meat had no taste to it and was undercooked. I opted for macaroni and cheese as my side rather than fries which I believe was $1.00 extra. The portion that I received was laughable.Very small. It was a bit of macaroni with a tad of cheese sprinkled on top and melted. No taste. My hamburger and macaroni were nearly $15. Way overpriced for what you get. They really need to step up their game here. I forgot to mention we had to wait several minutes at the door twiddling our thumbs waiting to be seated. We were the only ones waiting and there were only two other tables in the place at the time. Probably won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell

James B.,"Broadmoor, New Orleans, LA",223,219,253,4.0,2/23/2016,"So, driving aimlessly on a Sunday afternoon we decide to go to the Red Robin. Small wait, but the chalkboards for the kids to play with made it pass by much faster. This place is uber kid friendly. It was almost designed for children and parents with children. When you are the parent of loud (Most are loud) toddlers, you look for places with ambient noise just below a roar to mask your childs ""Not so Inside"" voices. Red Robin does this nicely. We were seated quickly and ordered first for the kids. This too is a must so that they do not have to wait long to get their food which caused some level of blissful silence as they eat. Also, this lessens the time spent blocking them from grabbing at everything on the table. If you are in the food service industry and do not know this fact, always get the kids order first. ALWAYS!! And never strive to serve the family together unless the kids are older.. NEVER!! I ordered the Fiery Ghost Style Tavern Double, with an egg added for, well flavor. The bottomless fries were good, hot, crisp and tasty. My burger was ample and delicious. I love any establishment which will allow me to add a fried, runny egg to the top of my burger because it just completes the burger in my opinion. All in, a very enjoyable experience. Kids, happy-Wife, happy- Wallet- happy, Daddy- happy!! AND I signed up for their loyalty card which gives me a free burger on my birthday. Can you argue with free food?? Nay, nay, nay I say.. And again, nay, nay!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell

Shercole K.,"New Orleans, LA",291,423,734,4.0,12/13/2015,"I always saw the commercial for Red Robin, but never paid much mind to it and assumed it was more fast food place, but I was wrong. This is an actual restaurant, which is good for groups, low-key dates and family outings. The parking situation is also good! It is located within the Fremeaux Shopping area so there is ample lot parking! I went during opening week! Even though it was super crowded, service was good and they got things done! The server was great, I sat at the bar....Yes there is a bar. I went with the Bacon Cheeseburger with Steak Fries... Talk about good. It was yummy so tasty and a pretty great burger!

Danny T.,"Slidell, LA",7,62,108,4.0,12/6/2015,"I had Red Robin once before trying this one. My first experience was really good so naturally I had to try out the new one in Slidell! We (a party of three) went in and immediately saw there was a wait, which we were expecting anyway. They estimated the wait to be 15 minutes then took our name and phone number. Within 10 minutes I got the text saying they were ready for us.  Overall, the place is up-to-date and clean. Every table has their computer/tablet thing which the guests use to order their appetizers, desserts, and some specialty drinks. It took a while for our server, Dawn, to greet us & get our drinks, but it was understandable considering how busy it was.  We ordered our appetizers and they were out within 10 minutes. We orders our entrees and they arrived within probably 15 minutes. Pretty fast! I got the chili burger. It was pretty good & very messy. We also had the seafood plate thing which was pretty tasty & a good portion. Overall the food was good & the service was even better. Dawn was great; she was attentive & got us refills on everything before we had to ask, though she was a little too talkative. But I guess I'd rather someone full of life & energy than someone who seemed like they hated their job. If you have a sweet tooth, definitely try out their bottomless root beer floats!

Chris S.,"Picayune, MS",182,81,45,4.0,5/24/2016,"Where I'm from we have Red Robins all over the place. My sister and I have made it a tradition to go there. It was a delight to see one placed in Slidell. It is a little pricier than most other burger joints but you really don't get the quality of a good gourmet burger like they have here.  Price: A little more than you would pay elsewhere but not too bad.  Food: I have yet to try a dish here I didn't like. I do wish they would bring back the Mocha Milkshakes.  Atmosphere: That is the charm about Red Robins most of the time. I found this one to be a little cramped compared to the others but it is nice clean and dark inside. Nice chill out spot. Has a decent bar.  Staff: Very friendly, makes sure your food is exactly the way you wanted it. Never pushy. Always a smiling face on most.

Amanda B.,"Pulaski, TN",1,15,18,1.0,2/23/2017,"Soooo I seriously DO NOT UNDERSTAND how this place calls them-self Red Robin ""Gourmet Burgers"". Like I'm so confused? How is a frozen over-cooked pre-made patty gourmet????? No flavor at all and poor quality meat. Sweet potato fries are frozen and not fresh. Just go to Five Guys.  It's cheaper and delicious.

Buz B.,"Slidell, LA",17,128,22,4.0,2/15/2016,"Over all pleasant experience with decent food and a fun atmosphere and attentive bar staff. Stopped here on a friday night of all nights, expecting a wait. There was a wait, but the bar was free and clear, so we sat there with no wait at all. What I didn't like initially about this place is that the bar area is hidden behind a giant wall, so we had to ASK if there was one.   The beer I got came fresh and cold in a proper Sam Adams glass, which I loved and the menu all looked appetizing. I got the Nantucket platter because I was in the mood for some fish and chips. The lady friend got some kind of burger which she thought was really good. The Nantucket platter came with beer battered cod, fried shrimp and clam strips. It was all good except with a few complaints. The fish came out in large nugget shaped lumps instead of a strip or filet, and wasn't easy to eat. The shrimp was a bit overdone and way too crispy, but those clams and fries were all right. The atmosphere in there is fun and they have tv's all around so there's a good bit to keep your attention. The bar staff was friendly and fun and when the time came for the check, they just set you up with a little Kiosk thingy of your own, which I REALLY liked. I reckon I'll go back again and try an actual burger, but I'm not really a restaurant burger kind of guy. Over-all it was enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell?start=20
Teresa L.,"Clearwater, FL",117,233,186,4.0,1/24/2016,"This new spot is kicking it.  We were seated quickly and addressed soon after. The service was good though toward the end it seemed kind of slow.  Then again, they do have these fancy-dancy machines on the table for you to pay with so. . .  The decor is cool and fun. The table top game was fun to play as well. But I was mostly excited about the menu.  Having recently readjusted to mostly paleo myself, I was thrilled to see the option for burgers wrapped in lettuce. In fact, the availability of substitutions for sides plus the really great burger choices deserve another visit.  My one complaint is that I would like a bigger choice of how my burger is cooked. ""A little pink or well done"" are not very acceptable to me, however the other options and ease of working with my eating habits may bring me back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell?start=20

We thought perhaps the stsff were still learning to handle large groups. But then we went by ourseleves and sometimes service was fine, sometimes not. On our most recent visit, we had a large party of 23 people in a Sunday. We were a group of young families with small children. Here's what the restaurant got wrong: This chain doesn't take reservations or even call-ahead seating. We were not given sufficient shade for being sat outside. There were adults finished eating before several children even got their food. (Dealbreaker) We had to continually ask for our children's food. (Dealbreaker) Wrong kid's meals were brought out.

It was a bit over-cooked for my taste and didn't come as I ordered it (asked for no tomato but got tomato). The onion strings on the burger were very tough. I couldn't bite through or break them. Fries were great!!  Prices were in line for the atmosphere and menu offerings. Will try again to see if burger was just a fluke.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell?start=40
Dean R.,"Slidell, LA",0,39,10,5.0,12/2/2015,First time I have ever been to Red Robin and it was pretty good. The food tasted great and the service was super. She was very attentive and explained the entire menu. Loved the dessert with the cronut type doughnuts. (Gotta Try It) Atmosphere was busy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell?start=40

Christopher K.,"St. Petersburg, FL",15,1,,1.0,1/20/2016,"This was my first time to a Red Robins restaurant and will honestly be the last. We stood by the front door for 3 minutes without anyone acknowledging us or seating us... Mainly because no one was around. When we were seated, it took another 5 minutes to get drink orders in. 10 minutes to receive our drinks and order. It took over an hour to get 2 burgers with garlic Parmesan fries. The waitress kept saying ""it was almost done."" ""Oh I know it's taking a little longer than normal, I have the manager looking into it."" After the long wait... It was a cold dry burger that was desperately undercooked for a medium burger. The meat was not even remotely warm.. I wish it sat under a heat lamp for another 10 minutes to actually warm/cook the burger. 15 minutes after finishing our fries they asked if we wanted more.. Luckily those fries were scalding just out of the frier hot. The garlic Parmesan fries were the only redeeming factor of the place. And after all of this... A $50 check. Thanks, I'll go elsewhere next time since there is so much burger competition in the area. This should definitely not be a place that takes an hour and a half to eat at...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell?start=40
Eric M.,"Diamondhead, MS",64,2,,2.0,5/22/2016,"My family has long enjoyed Red Robin, used to frequent them often when we lived in AZ.  We were very excited about the Slidell location opening up.  We stopped in yesterday with 2 of our kids and may not ever go back.   From the beginning the experience was not in line with the other locations we have visited.  The hostess station was rude, once seated it took 10 minutes to get our drink order taken.  My daughter went to the restroom and came back saying there was no toilet paper, when my wife told the hostess again meet with rudeness.  Once our food arrived one of the orders was wrong, my daughter ate it anyway because she was hungry.  Don't waste your time or money on the gluten free bun, my daughter found it practically inedible.  I hope this is location specific and not a trend for Red Robin  nationwide.  Our waiter(s) were friendly once the 1st one arrived, shift changed in the middle, only good thing to say.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell?start=40
Angie B.,"Lacombe, LA",0,8,2,1.0,4/17/2016,"I'll start by saying my server was great. That aside today was my second trip to red robin and I specifically went there to get the ""endless"" sweet potato fries. I love sweet potato fries and there aren't many places that have them on the menu. I got a cheeseburger and ordered the fries, ate one order of fries (which was small, about half the size of a normal order of fries) and ordered another. 15 minutes later I asked the server where they were and he said ""oh let me go check"" he came back 10 minutes later and said ""they burned them, it'll be about 15 minutes for them to remake some."" I was with my wife and she had already finished eating and was waiting to leave so I told him never mind. I would chalk this up to just a mistake in the kitchen BUT THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED AT THIS EXACT SAME LOCATION! The last visit they said the kitchen burnt the fries then as well. Either they need to hire new cooks or be honest about the ""endless"" or bottomless or whatever they call them fries. I didn't even eat half my burger Bc I was saving room for those stupid fries. I would understand if I was asking for a 5th refill of fries and they were trying to cut me off but I'm not a pig and only wanted one more stinking order. I will not be going to this restaurant ever again, they completely lost my business. Jerks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell?start=40
Kim N.,"Slidell, LA",31,5,,3.0,3/8/2016,"Burgers are delicious, I thought I'd try chicken salad oh no.. Romain salad was awful. How do I start to eat something that looks like it's caveman made.the chicken was days old and served cold. I I could not believe my eyes. I sent it back I wish I took a picture of that mess. Take that off the menu please. Stick to the burgers...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell?start=40
Floyd D.,"Slidell, LA",0,19,1,2.0,12/11/2015,I went there last Friday and the line was out the door so we didn't go in. This Friday we gave it another try. When we got there at 5:45 they told us they didn't have any French fries just sweet potato fries. My wive didn't mind so we went in because I figured they would substitute a side if you didn't want sweet potato fries. We waited a few along with a number of people and when we got seated I looked around and seen a few open tables but at least the wait wasn't long. We order the drinks which came quick and the waitress said just sweet potato fries for the substitute and the sides were extra. So we sat through two game of hangman waiting for the waitress to come back and called it a night for Red Robbin. The place seemed very crazy for only a few people in there (not that big). Well I still don't know if they got a decent burger and will give it try another day in about a month and a little more on their feet. I will also make a point to update this review. I hate to be negative but like to see the place succeed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell?start=40
Candace S.,"Slidell, LA",2,34,9,4.0,1/11/2016,"I was so happy to see Red Robin come to Slidell. I had it for the first time when I lived in Indiana. The food is consistent and delicious.

Wendy B.,"New Orleans, LA",0,2,,1.0,3/30/2016,"Very disappointed with service and food.  Burgers overlooked, orders mixed up & had to go ask for utensils.  On top of that we were charged $1.99 for entertainment fee.  Didn't know what that was and since we had decided we would not return we just paid the bill and left.  After getting in our car I decided to call and ask what it was.  I was told it was for the game machine on the table and that I had to ok the charge on the screen.  I told them we did not know what the machine was for and since it was in the middle of the table, I pushed it to the side (not touching any part of the screen).  With that said, I was given the Manager who told me I must have touched it, so I promptly walked back into the restaurant and demanded my money back.  I was given $2 even though I paid tax and tipped on the $1.99 charge.  Watch your bills people, this is obviously a rip off.  Will never go there ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-slidell?start=60
