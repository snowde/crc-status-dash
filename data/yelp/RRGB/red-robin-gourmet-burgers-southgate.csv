Phred N.,"Dearborn, MI",0,39,8,5.0,11/7/2017,*Update* Went to the Dearborn location for lunch with my wife. LOVED it! Great service and the burgers were done to perfection!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate
Tonya J.,"Livonia, MI",19,2,,2.0,9/23/2017,We stopped going to this Red Robin for two years because the service and food was horrible. All I can say that has improved was the food was hot this time.  The waitress checked our drinks one time and didn't come back until after I complained to the person that brought our meals out that we never got our appetizer and that I wanted it removed from the bill. Then she appeared to apologize. At that point I inquired about silverware and she blamed the hostess for not having it when we were seated.  My husband requested more fries and we waited almost ten minutes for them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate
Johnny P.,"Broomfield, CO",2,15,12,2.0,9/22/2017,"Ok, had lunch here today, Very disappointed with the service, the food and the manager! Our server was slow, my fries were cold when my meal was served, the chicken tortilla soup had no chicken! Manager came to our table asked if they would mind adding chicken to the soup, and he brought out a new bowl.  Just seems they really didn't care about making their customers happy.  So only two stars for this one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate
Jon F.,"Lincoln Park, MI",3,74,14,3.0,8/7/2017,"Red Robin, like so many chains, is one of those places that can be a reliable outing for you, but it can also be hit and miss.  When I traveled more and was in a hurry, I would rely on places like Chili's and RR to get me taken care of and still enjoy the meal.  From time to time I could be let down (Applebee's just down the street on Eureka, I'm looking at you!), but for the most part, you can do okay with these places.  Red Robin in Southgate is just that. We went this last weekend on Sunday afternoon.  This is Church crowd time, so the places on Eureka Rd will be busy but you shouldn't have any problems getting in.  We sat at the bar as always, and our bartender did a fine job, not too nosy and not 'disappeared'.  We split the Big Sirracha burger and an order of garlic Parmesan fries.  My girlfriend had a rum & coke and I had a pint of the Two-Hearted. The drinks were okay, my beer was cold enough but my girlfriend felt that her rum & coke was flat.  The burger was good.  I don't know that I'd call these world class, but they use good ingredients and everything tasted like a good burger should - you can taste the meat but also the sauce and everything else.  The fries were okay.  I liked the Parmesan garlic topping, and they were fries, but I just have never been impressed with their steak fries.  I would like them to be crispier but I don't know that that will happen.  The only other complaint I had was that it was too warm and muggy.  RR, put on the AC and get that temp to room 72! So, overall I wasn't blown away but I'd be totally okay with it if it was on the agenda.  A couple of changes and I'd be much more impressed, as I was when I first went to RR back in Cali.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate
Emily S.,"Lincoln Park, MI",34,109,22,3.0,4/19/2017,"I've been here many times but it was my last visit that prompted me to write a review. The food is great, no complaints there at all. Whatever kind of burger you're craving, they have it. The appetizers are pretty good as well....we normally get the pretzel bites.  We went here last Saturday and got seated near the bar at a 2 person table. The host that brought us to our table was friendly... our waiter, not so much(didn't catch his name). I think that maybe he was a bartender and got pulled to wait tables by the bar or something, I couldn't really tell. If his job is truly a server, I would be shocked. It's not that he was rude, but he just wasn't friendly at all. He didn't greet us, all he said was ""what can I get you?"" He didn't ask if we wanted drinks or offer us any specials they had...he didn't ask if we wanted to start with an appetizer. Just a plain old ""what can I get you?""  So we ordered waters and an appetizer. I also ordered a milkshake but told him he could wait to bring it out with the food. He brought out our waters and then a different waiter brought us our appetizer. Our waiter didn't bring out any silverware or napkins so we had to ask a different waitress for some. Then, he came back and took our food orders. The food took about 15 minutes to come out and was brought by ANOTHER waiter. He looked around for our waiter and asked if we needed anything... we told him just some more water so he went and got it for us because our waiter wasn't around.  Our waiter didn't come back to our table, until we were almost finished with our meal, and said ""what kind of milkshake do you want?"" I just told him I changed my mind.  He NEVER returned to our table until he gave us our bill. He did however walk around taking other customers' orders and talking out loud to another girl working saying that he's ""ready to leave and go to the bar and he's not staying late tonight."" I would MAYBE expect this type of talk from a kid in his 20's but this was a grown man.  Just not impressed with the service that night. I've never had any other problems here before...we normally always have great service but this just left a bad taste in my mouth. I would give the food and other employees that helped 5 stars but this guy in particular I'd give 1.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate
Leon M.,"Chelsea, MI",4,17,69,1.0,3/21/2017,"I haven't been back here in a long time. Now Iam reminded why I will Never come back.     Management of this Red Robin has been Very Poor for years. Look at the way my burger and fries are served.  Very sad looking, Not appetizing to Look at or taste. This is not the kids meal. Skimpy amount of fries and the Smokey peper jack burger is about the size of McDonalds regular hamburger- not like pictured in menu.   Service is So slow. Good luck trying to get a drink or fry refil. What good is bottomless fries when you can't get any. I blame the management because we were recently at the Red Robin down the street from U of M Ann Arbor and what a night and day difference. Very good there even with a full house.

Kelly M.,"Rockwood, MI",0,17,,4.0,12/30/2017,"My family has went there for a long time and my hubby and I have been there for many dates. My nephew loved playing ""I spy"" with all the decorations and had a ball with the game area. He also says the chocolate milkshakes are great. Their mai tais are my favorite and the cups are even cute. I like the guacamole burger a lot, hubby likes the whiskey river burger. The fries are basic steak fries. Onion rings aren't anything great. The last visit we had a strange waiter who kept talking in a strange monotone voice and you'd think he was receipting a novel, just to take a drink order!

I hope the manager reads this review and gives him a raise or paid vacation day cuz he deserves it. He did a great job and went above and beyond and just seems like a good person. Our food arrived hot and we enjoyed our meals. Very fresh and tasty. Also, I'm happy because they have gluten free buns so I can eat a burger like it's meant to be enjoyed!

Dan M.,"Utica, MI",119,101,20,4.0,9/4/2016,Four stars earned for one reason and one reason alone. (Well maybe two reasons).  The DGB is the best burger around in my opinion. And bottomless fries is always a plus!  Otherwise the service was lackluster. A lot of details missed that should be regular things when dining in a full service establishment. Check for refills often. Have silverware available when food comes. It did improve by the end of the meal. It's possible her section was swamped. There were some bigger parties including my party of 8.  I will always return. I love Red Robin!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate

What is there to say about the food other than I love it I love it I love it I can come here and eat 3 times a week and not get bored simply because they make it so easy for you to get it your way. The fries with the buzz sauce and some of that Red Robin on rollers is an entree in itself not to be missed believe me two orders of fries and I have not even touched my burger yet.

She was quick with everything, repeated our orders for confirmation (and did it again as she sat them down at the table). We never wanted for anything.

When the group of girls at the host stand decided to be snotty little girls and make a smart ass comment. When I turned back to react they all laughed.

My best friend who loves their burgers, got the mushroom swiss and endless fries. Those fries are damn good. I really love their seasoning salt. I bought a bottle and have before it's good stuff.

If you're not a big fan of hamburgers or if you can grill a good burger at home, Red Robin might not be for you.  I've never had anything messed up, and my order has always been delivered rather quickly by servers who are usually good at their job.  The food has always been good. I don't know what it is about Red Robin though, but it seems like a dine-in restaurant that parents always bring their kids to eat.  I hate dining next to a table of kids, but it always seems to be that way at Red Robin.  Last time, there must've been a birthday party or something, and the huge group had a bunch of kids being more rambunctious and uncontrollable than a dog pissing on the carpet in excitement because company is over.  If it's busy, it will always be loud in there.  Because of the design of their parking lot, you will not get a good parking spot at all if they are busy.  You might as well start walking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate?start=20

Service was again slow. But this time, the food was awful! The paper they used to put around the burgers must have caused the fire because they didn't have them anymore so it was sloppy to eat (not cool for a girl on a date) so I decided to use a fork and knife but the chicken was very stiff. As I picked off some of the tomato hoping to make it neater I noticed a long black hair. I was completely turned off after that.

As for the food it was just meh. For the 3 of us to eat it was over $45 which in my book is too damn much a freaking burger. I won't be venturing back anytime soon.

Britney was our server and even though she was new she went out of her way to get me jalapeño coins(which are no longer on the menu as an app) really good service even when they started getting really busy,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate?start=40
Barry H.,"Downriver, Detroit, MI",1,57,,2.0,5/13/2014,"If you are in the under 30 crowd and both of you want a high priced burger from a national chain that has a bar, and don't want to make it at home, I suppose it is OK.  It is an OK place to take a date if you don't mind paying for it.  For me there really is not that much on the menu that we like.  I tend to expect more from a place that charges the kinds of prices that they charge.  There are plenty of other places around town that do a good burger that are cheaper than this place.   I think they need to change the menu and offer more variety it seems all this place wants to sell are high end burgers.  I think it is a mistake- they are narrowing their niche too much. Service is OK though but nothing to rave about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate?start=40
Nikki C.,"Detroit, MI",134,348,24,4.0,11/16/2012,"Whenever I go here, which is usually when I receive a cool incentive or birthday freebie for being a card holding Red Robin frequent diner (their incentive program) -- I sit right at the bar. The service is quick, friendly and personalized. All you can eat fries? YES!!l (although, on my last visit, the fries were either overdone or they had been sitting out for some time) I highly suggest joining their email club for freebies and a heads up on specials and new items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate?start=40

Danny T.,"Detroit, MI",38,7,,2.0,11/1/2015,"Waitress was stressed out, lemonade had a nat, soda was flat, and fries were not fresh. Waitress never came back to ask if we wanted more fries or drinks. Didn't seem like enough food for a $14 dollar burger. Ive been to other locations and loved it. This One today just did not cut it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate?start=40
Erin M.,"Riverview, MI",3,27,,2.0,9/2/2013,"They changed the menu.  I think maybe they are fans of Rachel Ray and her never ending burger recipes.  Personally, when I go out to eat, I want to order something I can't easily make at home.  I can make a great burger at home any day of the week. I want something different when I go out.  They used to have a great turkey &avocado on a croissant.  It was a great sandwich.  It wasn't on the menu the last time I went. It was basically a lot of $10 burgers.  I was bummed.  If you like burgers, this is your place.  Otherwise, not so great anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate?start=40
Tommy H.,"Old Greenwich, CT",2,258,,1.0,12/27/2011,"If I could give negative five stars I would...where to start.  Place was empty and still took 15 min to seat us.  Messed up our drink order...30 min for the apps to to come out...then another 40 min for main courses...fries were cold, Burger was raw, chicken was cold.....and they screwed up one order altogether.

Dawn W.,"Levelland, TX",67,52,1,2.0,9/10/2012,"Normally a chain restaurant gets three stars from me minimum because of the corporate standards regarding service and such, but Red Robin in Southgate is only getting two.   My husband and I always look for interesting places to dine, and will always give a chain restaurant a chance to impress us.  After all, they didn't become a chain for no reason, right? Well, the four times we have dined here were four lessons in various levels of disappointment.   Three times it was the agonizingly slow service--and normally, we never go to a restaurant during any dinner or lunch rush.  With a less than half-full dining room, why does it take almost ten minutes for anyone to come over and inquire about drinks?   There are televisions randomly scattered throughout the dining room, and the noise level is rather high, but this is normal for a family restaurant.  The menu has many choices for those with varying levels of burger tolerance.  The restaurant features bottomless steak fries with most of the burgers.  The dessert menu has several interesting and unusual offerings, and features milkshakes.   Most of the menu items are a bit on the pricey side for a family chain restaurant, and normally for the two of us it is around $30 when all is said and done.  It is not difficult to find a better choice in the area, unless someone in your family really digs the kitschy decor and doesn't mind being seated around large families.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate?start=40
Stephanie W.,"Rockwood, MI",6,17,13,3.0,1/16/2012,"I have been going to this Red Robin location for at least 10 years. Up until recently I had always enjoyed dining here. That's why I'm still debating between 2 and 3 stars. Several of my most recent visits were sub-par, with the most recent being the worst of all. Most recently, I went with 2 friends, one of which had a 7 month old at the time. In the past, the service I've received at this restaurant has always been decent, if at times maybe a tiny on the slow side. However, I had never actually been upset by the service until this particular night. The service was absurd. We actually debated not tipping, but we felt bad and still left a few dollars each...although she didn't deserve even 10%. Once we had placed our orders and gotten our soups, our food took forever to come out, and in the meantime the waitress did not come back to check on us. When our food finally did come out, another employee brought it out and we were in serious need of refills. I ordered the French onion soup and fish sandwich that comes with coleslaw on it, and the ""coleslaw"" had no dressing whatsoever- it was just dry shredded cabbage. The fish itself was cold. However the French onion soup was really good. By the time the waitress finally came back to check on us, I just wanted my sandwich sent back and another bowl of soup. My friend had also gotten a soup and sandwich and when the waitress came back with my new soup, she asked for a box for half of her sandwich. She came back with a box and the bill, which we had to have separated and my sandwich removed from still. In the meantime, the 7 month old baby had become fussy and my friend was tending to her. Once the waitress returned with our corrected checks, she took my friend's half sandwich she had gotten the box for but was too busy taking care of her daughter to put into the box just yet. My friend's sister mentioned this to the waitress and she apologized and said she'd have the kitchen make her a new one, so we waited. After about 15 to 20 minutes of waiting to get the sandwich so we could leave, we saw the waitress standing near the doors of the restaurant, talking to someone who looked like it could be her mom, and also using her cell phone. We decided to leave at that point, because we had gotten fed up with waiting and being ignored. We stopped in to grab some quick soup and sandwiches and ended up being there for nearly 2 hours because the service was so slow. The food was incredibly underwhelming, aside from the soup. All in all, I'm sure I'll be back to Red Robin in the future, but I will definitely be wary the next time I'm there. If the service and food continues in this fashion, I won't remain a repeat customer much longer. I also feel it's worth noting that the menu seems to have downsized quite a bit and a few of the items are doubled, such as burgers you can also get as wraps. They seem to be missing a few items that I rather miss. I hope this restaurant isn't really going downhill, as I did always enjoy it. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate?start=40

Bob S.,"Edina, MN",102,89,,3.0,11/27/2007,"The burgers here all always great and there is a great variety to choose from as well as other sandwiches, salads, and appetizers.  My personal favorite is the Whiskey River BBQ Burger (also available as a chicken sandwich).   Red Robin is a preferable alternative to other ""family restaurant"" places like Applebee's, Chili's, Fridays, etc.  The quality of the food tends to be better and the atmosphere and service are comparable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-southgate?start=40
