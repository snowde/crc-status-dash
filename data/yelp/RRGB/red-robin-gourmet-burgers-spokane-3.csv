Dan P.,"Cedar Falls, IA",69,188,309,3.0,7/25/2015,"I work in the industry. At our place we make burger patties from whole ground beef logs and season them ourselves so I can say I've been spoiled with consistent high quality burgers. Food: My wife and I had an avocado bacon Swiss burger. It was good. The more I took bites from the patty the more I was wondering where I've tasted this flavor before. Without being too rude, it taste like most run off the mill preformed patties. Or a ""good not great"" flavor. Had a milkshake, I've had many from one local diner in particular who make their own ice cream. Red Robin's DOES NOT COMPARE. It was ok. Wish the fries where crispier. Service: the waitress, Krista, was A+. Very appropriately attentive, not a hint of forced kindness, timely authentic hospitality. I'd say if my rating was entirely based on hospitality Red Robin would have gotten a 5 because of Krista. Here's what chains do right. Consistency. If you are looking for an expected bite. Red Robin is a place to get exactly what you expect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3?start=20
J D.,"Spokane, WA",6,9,1,3.0,4/5/2016,"Tasty burger chain with some new issues (""The Rub"" at the bottom, would have been 4 stars.) The Food - I have to say that I've never been dissatisfied with my burger or other dish, but I do feel that it may be slightly overpriced for ground meat, bun and some sauce...  But yummy! The Experience - The servers do a good job running sodas and the extras.  The kitchen staff brings the food, and if there is an issue, a manager checks it out and then delivers your correction.  I think this ensures a touch of accountability; I like that.  But..... The Rub - I feel that in a sit-down served restaurant, you should not have to ""pay at the cash register"".  Red Robin's new pay at the table shifts the responsibly to fix check issues to you.  We had a group of people out for my wife's birthday and had a free burger card for her meal.  We presented this card at the end meal, the waitress looked at us like we were dumb, asked for the computer thing, played with it for a moment, explained that we are now responsible for this section of our meal and gave it to us to run our own card...  So, now I'm responsible for my check and they default the tip higher than normal???? Frustrated, I downgrade the tip and pay for the meal, which I assumed was correct.  NOPE.  I discovered that night that we had paid full price.  I was supposed to know how to use the burger card, somehow (what was she doing playing with device before degrading us?)  Now we have to go back again for her free burger. Maybe the server just failed the new system, but it made no new fan of me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3?start=20

April G.,"Seattle, WA",18,4,,2.0,9/26/2015,"Normally I love red robin's, and my hubby and I normally go here for date night. Tonight was not a good experience. They forgot the sauce on my hubby burger, and I order the whiskey river BBQ salad, but my chicken had no bbq. The waitress only offered to have it remade which meant I would get to watch my hubby eat as I starved, because I just got off work and was super hungry.  So I said no, and nothing else was offered.  No free dessert or anything for the mess up. That is just ridiculous, and nothing compensated on my bill. So I am no so not happy with my experience at all tonight, not even sure if I will ever come back. And we have dinner or lunch here two or more times in a month.

Georgia G.,"Spokane, WA",84,16,1,2.0,6/29/2016,"The burgers have changed. They are not big, freshly made patties anymore. Mine this time and last was thin, burnt, and not at all as good. Unfortunate.

Cody O.,"Spokane, WA",60,10,,3.0,12/9/2014,"I live about a block away form this Red Robin and being part of their royalty program am always getting great offers and deals and because of this I try to come here once a week either for lunch by myself or dinner with my family.  I've had a good experience almost every time I've come here. The staff is friendly, the atmosphere, while loud and can be quite loud with children or birthday parties, its usually not to bad that I can't talk amongst my family.  To the food, the real reason why reviews were started, they've been great, my wife loves the Southwest Grilled Chicken salad and I was always a huge fan of the Chili Chili cheeseburger. They changed the idea behind that chili cheeseburger though rather recently, before one would get a plate, burger and bun, topped in chili and required silverware to get it all, now its more of like half a scoop of chili on a cheeseburger. It really takes the oomph out of what was my favorite cheeseburger.  Their menu is great otherwise, many of their other burgers are delicious, my next favorite being the A1 Peppercorn burger.  Overall, its a decent restaurant, somewhere in between a fast-food burger joint and a more traditional sit down restaurant but that is okay, its why I go. Wait time can be a bit long, but never anything crazy. The last time I went on a Friday, 12/5/14, I arrived at 6 pm and put my name down for a table for 4 and waited only like 15-20 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3?start=20
Matt B.,"Snohomish, WA",36,396,16,3.0,1/12/2014,"Yeah, there's nothing wrong with it. It's just that it's Red Robin. Once you've been to one, you've pretty much been to them all.  Wife and I stopped in for lunch the other day while shopping, since we got a gift card here for Christmas. Having been to Red Robin before, we new exactly what we were going to get. Burgers are fine. I always pisses me off that they think I'm too stupid to order my burger anything more complex than ""pink"" or ""no pink"". I actually want my burger medium rare. They won't cook it that way, even if I ask. My ""pink"" burger came out moderately moist, but still definitely overcooked from where I want it. Service was entirely fine. Not great, but (pardon the pun) serviceable. We did keep having to ask for water, which I find slightly annoying, but whatever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3?start=20

It started off fine but took a turn for the worst.   My self and by 2 boys got our drinks immediately.   My 5 year old daughter didn't get her apple juice till 10 minutes later then another 10 minutes till we placed our order.

Megan S.,"Pasco, WA",18,327,37,1.0,12/27/2012,"Worst food we have EVER received from a restaurant.  Let me start by saying that my husband and I love Red Robin. We eat there at least once a week in our hometown and we usually have great food and service there. Here, however, the food was simply disgusting. We received food that should have never left the kitchen. I've posted a couple pictures for you to see for yourself, though it was nastier in person I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, wrapped in lettuce, with a side salad instead of fries, and he ordered a bleu ribbon burger, also wrapped in lettuce with a side salad instead of fries (we stay away from carbs). We both ordered ranch with our salads. Our waitress was very nice, but never refilled our drinks even though they sat empty a very long time. The first thing I noticed when our food arrived was that my ranch was quite obviously different in color and texture than my husband's ranch. While his was a normal consistency and color, mine was yellow and thick-- a sign that it was nasty and old. I hate complaining, so I decided to try it on my salad anyway. It tasted off, so I refused to eat any more of it out of fear for food poisoning. Here's where it really got gross. While I'd been dealing with the salad grossness, my husband ate his. When he got to his burger, he noticed the lettuce ""wrapping"" was limp, transparent, and slimy. It looked like the rotten lettuce that's in the bottom of my refrigerator. He took the lettuce off and tried to eat the burger with a fork, but clearly, we'd both lost our appetite.  Furthermore, we asked for our burgers to be well done-- no pink-- and they both arrived with a lot of pink. The kitchen in this restaurant is awful. I wonder if they had a blind man back there working. Who serves rotten lettuce? Who serves two different ranches, one fresh and one obviously not, to a table?  Not to mention, the remodel is uncomfortable (see my Valley RR review) and we were seated about 30 feet from the door and felt a cold draft the whole time. I have NEVER, EVER complained in a restaurant, but out of principle I refuse to pay for such terrible food. When the manager came over, he offered what I believe was more of a justificiation than an apology and told us he'd take my husband's burger off the tab (didn't address my gross ranch, but oh well). He said the lettuce had been ""frozen"" and that he pulled a bunch of frozen lettuce out of the fridge. I have seen frozen lettuce before and it never looked like that. The point is, WHY DID SOMEONE IN YOUR KITCHEN THINK IT WAS OKAY TO SERVE THAT? If it's ""frozen"", travel across the parking lot to Safeway, and pick up some new lettuce (don't serve it anyway!). Is it THAT hard? He never acknowledged that the food we received was not suitable to be served. He never said he'd offer more training to employees; he didn't even say he would talk to the kitchen staff about it.  If the kitchen takes no pride in food preparation (what customers see), I wonder how clean it is back there (where customers don't see). WE WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3?start=20
Melodi W.,"Spokane, WA",109,3,,3.0,11/12/2014,"So the service was great, especially for how busy it was on Veterans Day, but y'all might want to take some advice for next year and not hand out balloons to the children when you know your place will be packed with vets. 3 of them popped while we were in there and had over half the place hit the floor.

Amy G.,"Spokane, WA",0,8,,2.0,9/21/2014,"My husband and I stopped here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We were greeted by the manager and seated immediately. We had to wait a long time for our waitress to even acknowledge that we sat down in her section. It almost seemed like she was annoyed with us even ordering. After we placed our order it took a very long time to get my husband's milkshake. Our waitress blamed the time on the 'new' bartender and complained how 'slow' she was. When we received our appetizer we did't have napkins  or utensils and had to ask one of the hostess for them. Our waitress never really checked in with us during our meal, she was very quick to bring us more drinks when we didn't need them. We spoke to the manger before leaving and she was very apologetic, telling us that she would address the issues with our waitress.

And I got the impression that just because I was by myself and she knew she wouldn't get a very large tip from my table, she ignored me.

Casey P.,"New York, NY",37,373,34,5.0,9/2/2012,"My dad and I came here on a Saturday afternoon to watch the Hawaii-USC game. We were fortunate enough to bump into an employee on our way in and he helped us out. Initially we walked through the bar because they had a couple of televisions set up there. But since I was only 20 at the time I couldn't sit there. Instead the waiter seated us in the restaurant area with a good view of the television. He actually made the effort to adjust the television and change the channel so we could watch. Our waiter really went above and beyond to make sure we had an enjoyable experience. When it came time to order our food, we had a different server, a friendly young woman. She was prompt, and accommodated my request for a vegetarian substitute. She also moved a plant that was blocking our view of the television. The food was wonderful - try the BBQ burger with a veggie pattie. It has onion straws, lettuce, cheese, and barbeque seasoning. They did a great job with my order. Our request to stay and watch the football game was somewhat unusual, because Red Robin is far from a sports bar.

David G.,"Colbert, WA",3,6,67,4.0,12/4/2017,"Very homey place to sit down and eat a burger with fries. Every time I come heres it's gonna be a burger i'm getting because they always got a new one on the menu to try! I will upload menu pics if I ever see new burgers because that's what their known for! Last time I got the Taco Tavern Double which isn't the thick juicy 1/2 pound patty ones but it was still yummy. Paired with sweet potato fries!! Yes this restaurant is one of the rare place that serves them! I highly recommend them over the steak fries or thick cut normal fries whatever you call them. Very kid friendly food as well, my Niece and Nephew love the pizza , grill cheese, mac and cheese. They also got yummy milk shakes for the kids. Salads are pretty good just make sure you order yours with romaine lettuce only unless you like weeds in yours. They also got options to throw on some cooked chicken etc, More protein . I won't give them 5 stars because sometimes the service is pretty slow to get food ordered or extra napkins and this is not even at peak lunch time or new employees. One time I got both types of fries and they were freezer burnt! Which shocked me and I didn't expect it, must of been old limp fries sitting in freezer too long idk. Anyways wasn't like that after going back recently phew. A helpful tip by the way; if you order food to go don't buy sweet potato fries! Unless you don't mind soggy mushy fries, they will not be crunchy at all. The steam kills them because they are trapped in boxes for too long. Normal fries are fine because they are thicker. Almost forgot to mention you can tell them to double your patty on any hamburger. I do this if I had a light breakfast and need more calories.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3

My fries came out and were perfect as usual, but the soup was BARELY lukewarm, and all the grease that was in it was making little round pools of grease in the broth. Not appetizing. I sent it back for a new one, and I'm pretty sure I got the exact bowl back, with the cheese a little more crusted and stuck on. The cheese, which my favorite part, was rubbery to the point of it being difficult to chew and swallow. The bread part was soggy and rubbery-how does one even accomplish that?! The onions were burnt in some places-not charred, not carmelized-BURNT. And the broth was scalding! I tried so hard to eat it, because I have been sick and nothing has tasted good to me, but....no.

We were able to take advantage of the free Tavern Double Burger for the Seahawks red zone touchdowns! It was two small, kiddy sized patties, lettuce, tomato, and a slice of cheddar on a small bun. Perfectly sized for me. Our Guacamole Burger was tasty and attractive on its gluten free bun ($1 extra). The Clucks and Fries arrived hot and crispy. Took some effort to catch wait staff for additional ranch dressing dip. I forgot to request a substitute of fresh steamed broccolli and they appeared in 10 minures, cooked fresh to order! I like that they are left plain.   They also appeared to be a bit understaffed as it was difficult to catch our friendly wait person, Tracy, as she bustled from tables to staff station.   Rounded up 3.5 for lack of keeping drinks refilled, the iced tea and strawberry lemonade. The large chocolate shake was equal to two regular ones, very filling! Restrooms were tidy and clean.  Hubby was facing the center of the dining room and found the noise very loud.

Angela M.,"Spokane, WA",0,24,,4.0,9/28/2015,"It would be really hard to walk into a Red Robin and not find something that will please you with their menu variety and attentiveness to dietary needs.  Each burger is cooked to order and the wait staff are sure to ask you how you want your burger done (pink or no pink). Me, being a little squeamish about pink hamburger, always ask for my burgers cooked all the way through and I have yet to turn away a burger at Red Robin for being under cooked. They have lots of options and sauces, each meal is nicely seasoned and flavored (even their diet menu options) so you should never have a bland meal.  The fries are okay, they are fries. There's nothing that can really be said about fries. They are hot (usually, once they were cold but they were replaced immediately) and they are thick steak fries so you will fill up on them. Watch out.  If you don't like the fries (I'm not a huge fan of RR's fries) they have other options such as steamed broccoli or their freckled fruit salad. The broccoli is steamed to perfection and great for dunking in a sauce. The freckled salad is sweet but not too sweet and has a natural fruity flavor. I'm not sure if they put a syrup on it or if they rely on fruit juice for the salad, but whatever it is, it is really good.  The wait staff is usually really friendly and attentive to your needs and offers empathy and resolution if you just don't like something. I ordered a raspberry creme soda from this establishment once and it was awful, really really awful; it was like drinking cold medicine. I told my waitress and she apologized, took the offending drink away and took the order off our check and offered me a free drink in replacement. A+ service.  This location also has an electronic ordering device at each table where you can order in private or call a waiter over, you can also pay your bill without waiting for a check which is a great convenience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3
Emelie L.,"Spokane, WA",0,5,,2.0,4/7/2015,"Honestly, every time I go to this location. I'm not impressed. The hostesses are rude, the service is slow, and everyone acts like they would rather not be there. Half the time the staff doesn't even ask how everything is. I don't know why I keep going back, oh probably the food is good, because the service here.. IS HORRIBLE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3?start=40
Tabitha M.,"Waxhaw, NC",0,2,,4.0,1/2/2014,"Food is so-so, as Red Robins always are. However, we went into this location with a large party, sat a long time, and got non-stop excellent service from Nate. He was patient as we sat and waited for the rest of our party, prompt to refill drinks as soon as they began to get low, got every order correct, and was fun. Awesome service!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3?start=40

Scott B.,"Spokane, WA",8,119,27,5.0,1/6/2011,"This is the letter I recently sent to Red Robin Corporation. My family has a tradition of eating at Red Robin for birthdays.  On this day we were there to celebrate my son Carters birthday. We informed multiple employees including our server that it was his birthday.  By the end of the meal a few things became evident.  One was the food was as good as usual.  We each had something different and it was all very good.  The other thing we discovered was the service was not up to your usual standards.  The server was not as attentive as he could have been and the only thing that came promptly was the bill(which I do like).  He also forgot to acknowledge that it was my son's birthday.  No singing or desert or anything.  My wife and I though maybe this tradition no longer existed.  We left and were disappointed.  I filled out your survey stating all of this and voicing my displeasure.  The next day my wife was on her friends facebook page and spotted a picture of her friends family celebrating a birthday at Red Robin where everyone was singing and sharing a desert.  My wife as so unhappy that she called to talk to a supervisor at the Red Robin on the Newport highway.  She was informed that no one was available to talk to her due to it being busy and that she should call back at some other time.  She was upset that no one took her name and offered to call her back but she did as they requested.  When she called back later she talked to a manager named 'Jimmy' who really impressed her.  He told her in no uncertain terms that Red Robin as a company strives to make everyone feel special and that what happened should never have happened.   He stated he wanted to make it up to us by sending a gift card to make up for my son's meal.  He also stated that he would send his business card and that next time we ate at Red Robin we should ask for him so he could help Carter celebrate a belated birthday.  My wife and I thought this was a very nice gesture and that Carter would probably get a $10 gift card for a child's meal.  Two days later Fed-EX showed up at my door with an overnight delivery from Red Robin.  To my surprise inside was a $30 gift card and a letter from manager Chris Eldred.  This went way beyond any expectations I had.  The letter showed a company that knows what it needs to do to be a success.  We probably would have comeback again just because of how good the food was, but now I look forward to coming back to eat at a restaurant that cares about the customer and knows how to be a success in a consumer oriented industry. We want to say thank you to your company for this corporate attitude and a special thank you to your managerial staff for a great attitude.  We look forward to eating here real soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3?start=40
Sara S.,"Portland, OR",1,22,,1.0,12/30/2014,"I've never been a huge fan of Red Robin, just because I don't see anything really special with their food, but I don't knock them for that, because even though it's nothing special, they do a good job with the basic stuff they serve. My issue today was the fact that we didn't even have the chance to eat anything. The place was packed, which isn't their fault, however the attitude of the hostess, who acted as though she was working the door at an exclusive nightclub and not a family friendly burger joint, left much to be desired. She couldn't be bothered, and told us to sit in the bar. We tried, but it's tough to sit in the bar when the only tables open haven't been cleared off. Literally 5 tables in the bar that were waiting to be bussed. She didn't care, so we left. Yeah, it's a big chain and they don't care if they lose a customer here or there, but with a hundred other choices out there that have better food and service, they should try a bit harder.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-spokane-3?start=40

Colin S.,"Pullman, WA",3,3,,5.0,7/22/2010,"Red Robin, I have noticed, is kind of a northwest thing. My friends and I love this place and when we went to college nearby, we'd go all the time.
