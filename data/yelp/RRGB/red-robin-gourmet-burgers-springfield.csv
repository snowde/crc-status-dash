Olive B.,"Springfield, IL",2,64,12,4.0,11/6/2017,"Nice place to grab a great burger, unlimited French fries - don't forget the fry sauces! - and a drink with your family.    Wait staff are friendly and attentive but not overbearing.   We had a couple of issues with our table of 8-  plates came out dirty, and one entree was forgotten in kitchen.  Both resolved quickly and with apologies.   This is weird to mention but it bugged me: Watching a waitress do something at the bar and when she lifted her arm up I noticed a huge hole in her RR shirt.  The entire underarm was blown out.   Not a good look, please get another shirt from your manager.  All in all a great visit for burgers and fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-springfield
Jake S.,"Lincoln, IL",0,16,,1.0,11/5/2017,"I'VE NEVER WANTED TO DINE AND DASH BEFORE EVER! BUT I ALMOST JUST FUCKING WALKED OUT WITHOUT PAYING! FUCK RED ROBIN, GO TO CHILI'S! For a place that specializes in burgers the burgers were very disappointing. I ordered my burger with no pink in the middle. It was fucking pink and my girlfriends burger as well as mine was cold. The sweet potato fries were cold, and I felt like I was definitely not my server's priority. Little does he know, I tip better than all 10 people at that big table put together, not now tho! They gave my girlfriend a new burger and took off the $7 charge for the first burger and gave her just a plain burger for $9 and charged us $1.49 for more sweet potato fries wtf. That's $3.50 more than we spent in the first place. The manager took off both of our appetizers which took $10 off so I didn't bitch about it but still.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-springfield
Margaret S.,"Honolulu, HI",37,114,278,4.0,6/19/2017,"Not sure what all the dislike is about in this page. Reading through the reviews I was surprised by what I was reading. My husband and I stopped here in the way to Chicago for dinner. We were completely done with our meal within 45 minutes, which included a second supply of the sweet potato fries. Our server was very gracious and friendly. Our food was typical for the chain, but we had no complaints!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-springfield
Julie B.,"Chatham, IL",0,64,,1.0,4/22/2017,"I love Red Robin and was looking forward to dining there with my sister. My favorite sandwich on the menu is the California Chicken sandwich. I was extremely disappointed with the California Chicken sandwich that I received when I dined there last Tuesday. I've been used to receiving a sandwich with 4 large, thick slices of bacon and at least a scoop or scoop and a half of fresh guacamole. Instead, I received a sandwich with two small paper thin slices of bacon and just a tiny dollop of guacamole. It barely covered the bun. It was so bad, I thought the waitress had brought me the wrong sandwich. I also ordered garlic fries which were nothing more than steak fries with some old minced garlic on top. They did not look like the garlic fries pictured on the menu and they tasted horrible. I also got the ""bottomless"" root beer float which was a waste of money. They barely put any soft serve ice cream in my float. So I was basically just drinking a root beer. The service we received from our waitress was just mediocre. Yet they wanted us to give her a 20% tip. I don't think so!!!! So an overall disappointing meal. I will not be going back to Red Robin. If I want a burger I'll go to Chilli's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-springfield

Clueless hostess waiter was pleasent but our food took forever then was wrong I asked for the bbq chicken sandwich I got the burger but didn't want to wait 45 minutes for another meal.

Mark B.,"Rantoul, IL",0,4,,4.0,5/1/2016,"Great restaurant and staff. I am in town weekly and this is one of my favorite places to eat. Normally I order the Blue Ribbon Burger with a side what is great about this establishment is that they will make the burger with a lettuce wrap and serve a vinegar based coleslaw without fail.  The last visit I asked if they could make a Chicken Wrap with some changes to their normal wrap, well they nailed request just exactly what I requested.

Kendra E.,"Springfield, IL",0,1,1,1.0,8/28/2015,"We gave Red Robin another chance after having an awful experience 6 months ago. We ordered spaghetti for our son and ordered fruit salad as a side since the apple slices we ordered the previous time tasted like they had sat in water for 3 weeks. When we received the meal, I immediately noticed the stawberries (which are my son's favorite) in the fruit salad looked an odd sickly pale purple color(I provided a photo which looks a little better due to the red table seeming to bring in some color). The rest of the fruit looked old with the tell tale translucent edges. I ended up grabbing the fruit salad and put it to the side refusing to let my son eat it. I understand that Red Robin specializes in burgers and fries, but if you have a hard time keeping fruit fresh, maybe...just maybe it should not be offered as a side dish for children.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-springfield
Patrick S.,"Auburn, IL",0,13,2,2.0,2/18/2015,"We were excited when Red Robin came to Springfield because we've often eaten at other locations but this one has been disappointing.  Been there twice as I am willing to give any place a second chance and the service was worse the second time. Even though it wasn't busy, and pretty early (about 5:00), it seemed as though they couldn't get us out fast enough. The portions of fries was small but I figured since it was bottomless fries they would bring more. That offer never came but the check did. It isn't hard to please me. The bare minimum of keeping my glass filled will get my server a generous tip (usually over 20%) but if they aren't interested in making us glad we ate there then I am happy to go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-springfield
Jon E.,"Springfield, IL",10,16,8,1.0,2/19/2015,"Gotta say...not real impressed with this visit.  My wife was craving a burger, so we decided to come here.  It was a Thursday night, just before 6pm, so right on the cusp of the dinner rush. I ordered the Prime Chophouse Burger (no cheese) and a side of Buzzard sauce.  My wife ordered the Royal with no tomatoes, and we ordered the Kids Spaghetti with Apple Slices for our son.  Well, when the food came out, I immediately noticed the mass of cheese oozing out of my burger, so I immediately sent it back.  My wife was lucky in that she could still simply pull out the tomatoes that they failed to remove.  Interestingly though, my son was making an odd face while eating his apple slices, so I tried one and they had absolutely NO flavor whatsoever...it was like eating apple-shaped water. After a few minutes, I pulled the waitress to the side to ask about the side of sauce that I received, and the waitress responded that it was the ""Campfire Sauce"".  I had to correct the waitress in that I had asked for a side of Buzzard Sauce.  After a while longer, my burger finally arrived and was mediocre at best.  Also, the fries were AMAZINGLY over-seasoned and the Buzzard Sauce was practically a liquid salt lick and completely inedible.   It's sad to say that between my wife and myself, the only praise we could give was for the Orange Cream Soda (which is simply an orange sode with some Whipped Cream on top). I sincerely doubt we will be back, and maybe it could have been a better experience if it even seemed that they were actually listening to our order, but I doubt it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-springfield
John M.,"Clayton, MO",31,4,,1.0,10/21/2015,Took 1:15 to eat for 2 people and 15 min of that was actual eating. Go across the street to coopers hawk. Way better burger and way better atmosphere.

Aaron M.,"Seattle, WA",98,45,1,1.0,9/4/2014,"Oh my gosh this place is sooooooo slow. We arrived at 6:30 on a weeknight and almost an hour later still didn't have our food. It wasn't busy--open tables everywhere--but we had to wait 10 minutes to be seated. Then waited 30 minutes for our hamburgers and kids spaghetti to arrive after ordering.  The service was friendly, our waitress was great, but getting our food in a timely manner just didn't happen. The good was good but not worth the wait.

Gail W.,"Taylorville, IL",2,221,,2.0,2/28/2016,"We like Red Robin's food, but this particular restaurant is usually a very trying experience. Yesterday was no different. We arrived about 2 and there were about 6 parties waiting to be seated. I asked to sit in the bar because no children are allowed to sit in that area and it is usually a little quieter. The hostess said it would be about 10 minutes --- hmmm, get someone to bus those empty, dirty tables and you'd have no wait. We were finally called and she proceeds to a table in the regular dining area and right next to a table with 2 small screaming toddlers. I reminded her that we had asked to sit in the bar and she looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language....but she did lead us into the bar and seated us at a table that was probably empty when we arrived! Someone came to take our drink order fairly quickly and we asked if we could place our lunch order also since we were going to a movie. He took our order and then we waited...along with everyone else in that section. Food seemed to be coming out of the kitchen very slowly. Our drinks arrived and we continued to wait. Our burgers finally arrived, but we had no napkins and no flatware. I can make do with a burger and fries with no fork, but I did need a knife to cut the burger in half. We asked the person who brought our meals if we could get some napkins and silver. She got napkins but then disappeared to ""find"" silverware. Our original waiter came by to see if everything was OK and I asked for silver again and he said they were backed up. Really? A restaurant without enough silverware? I asked if I could at least get a knife and he headed off to see what he could find. Finally came back with 2 knives -- both wet, so I guess he washed them himself (I hope!). Wiped off 1 knife with one of the napkins and was finally able to eat. The burgers were good -- fries crispy and hot. Their fries are bottomless, but we didn't dare ask for more or we would have missed the movie for sure! We only visit this location about every 6-8 months -- just long enough to forget how painful it is! Food is good, but service and kitchen are awful. Hostess is clueless. We might go back about September or October.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-springfield
Joseph S.,"Athens, IL",1,46,7,1.0,1/25/2016,"So a friend came to town and wanted Red Robin, okay, let's try again. This time was seated within 10 minutes (with no one in front of us) unimpressive. We were seated and of NO surprise to me, our drink order (sodas) went over 15 minutes - we started talking to the table beside us because they started a 5 minute timer that they were walking out if they didn't get their food. So when they walked out, we walked out, of course hostess no where to be seen. This specific store is junk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-springfield
Tony C.,"Springfield, IL",1,73,69,2.0,5/27/2015,"Even though it is a newer place, it has a grimy feel to it.  Burgers were not impressive, seemed a touch overpriced.  People should form their own judgment, and try it.  I probably will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-springfield
Josh B.,"Springfield, IL",36,10,,1.0,8/11/2013,"I went to Red Robin on Friday 8/9/13 for the first time and was very disappointed.  They were very busy and when I went in to the restaurant they said there would be a 35 minute wait, it ended up actually being a ten minute wait which was nice. We were sat down and after about fifteen minutes our waitress comes to our table. We order drinks and an appetizer of chips and chilli queso. The waitress brings us our drinks and takes our order. I was thirsty and I drank my drink fairly quick. My glass sat empty for another fifteen minutes before I had to ask the waitress for another drink. Another fifteen minutes passes and we get our burgers, we never received our appetizer. I told this to the guy who brought out our burgers. He goes and brings back our appetizer, which the queso dip was lukewarm so I know it had been sitting there for awhile. While eating I finished off my second drink and again it sat there empty for at least fifteen minutes.  The hamburgers were subpar at best. I would have been much happier with five guys or steak n shake. Once I got my bill I had some sticker shock. With tip it was almost $50! Wow what a rip off! I will not be visiting Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-springfield
Daniel B.,"Springfield, IL",28,4,,5.0,8/21/2015,My family and I have came here since they opened and the food has always been good.

Vince H.,"Springfield, IL",2,4,,1.0,11/22/2014,"The wife, sister-in-law and I went here and expected a good experience but it was far from it. The first indication should have been the hostess telling us that she didn't know how our server was but someone would come along and help us eventually.    We decided to order a couple of beer's and the Blue Moon draft was not working correctly and after waiting 15 minutes we were told this. In the mean time they forgot to take our order.  After finally ordering it was 50 minutes before we received our food which turned out to be an over priced burger and average fries that they seem to be so proud of offering.

Jessica B.,"Unionville, CT",16,70,99,2.0,11/14/2013,"I don't know why I expected better from Springfield, but I always learn my lesson when I eat at restaurants on the west side. Simple order: 2 children's pizzas with side fruit cup, one bowl of soup, one house sald, and one tavern double burger. 24 minutes later, we received our food but only after everyone around us got their food and most of them had come in after us and had more people. Not only was my soup ill prepared (french onion soup) with the cheese that's supposed to be floating on top, had actually made its way to the bottom of my bowl like some sort of soup-logged, drowning matter. I was the only one at my table who had issues with my food. Everyone else had great food.

Bret H.,"Kansas, IL",12,37,32,1.0,6/28/2014,"Dining with an autistic child presents its own set of challenges. When Connor is hungry he is hungry right now. Our waitress was very understanding of that and promised some fries to hold him over until the food was ready. However, half hour and a huge meltdown later and we still had no food. I understand not everyone is comfortable around disabled people, but some sensitivity and some understanding would've been nice. We were completely ignored by server after server and manager after manager. They walked right by our table without making any eye contact. Even though they could tell that we were experiencing problems they offered nothing to help. It's really not that difficult guys, all you got to do is give us a little something quicker, like you promised, or even just some of those free crackers they come with salads.  We completely understand that our child can be a bit of an annoyance, trust me. We know. We also know that we are very good tippers. Especially when service has been performed that deserves a good tip. However, unkept promises and avoidance will not equal a good tip.  This is my first trip to Red Robin. Been wanting to come for a long time. Your burgers look epic on those commercials. I really doubt I will ever be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-springfield?start=20
Patrick P.,"Springfield, IL",36,11,,2.0,9/7/2013,"Waited a few weeks after opening to try it out.  Arrived at 5 on a Friday evening, and had about a ten minute wait.  (Nice touch: getting a phone number and sending a text when your table is ready) Kids loved theirs, portions were large enough that both of my boys had lunch the next day on theirs.  Younger son ordered spaghetti and wished it had more cheese on it -- and the waitress delivered right away. Wife had the Bleu Ribbon Burger, which she found to be overly spicy.   She was also disappointed that the waitress had trouble expressing how done the burgers would be -- they are ordered either ""pink"" or ""no pink"" but the waitress said ""No pink might still have pink -- we actually cook to temperature""   So I asked what temperature, and she didn't know.   I shrugged and said ""Well, if it's the wrong temperature, you'll correct it, right? "" and the waitress first said no, then said yes, but it would take a long time. I ordered the Prime Chophouse burger ""Pink"" and found it to be very good.  The fries are steak fries and marketed as a ""bottomless basket"" -- which it literally is -- a small metal dish of fries with no bottom.   But they'll also bring more fries for free.  The first order of fries, and my son's order of fries were a bit bland, but were much better after we added salt at the table.  The refill order of fries that we got were much better . . . I'd guess that someone forgot to salt the first batch. We had a Mini-tower of Onion Rings (the ""O-Ring Shorty"" and an order of Pretzel Bites with cheese sauce.  The older son liked the pretzels and not the rings, and the younger didn't like either.   The pretzels were good, and the rings were a bit overly greasy for my taste, but they were hot and crisp and had a nice flavor. Refills on our drinks came quickly, and the waitress was quick to remove dirty dishes.  (Which brings me to our one other issue -- the plates that came with our appetizers were dripping wet.  But one of the busboys quickly replaced them for us). We finished with a shared slice of Strawberry Cheesecake. Total for four of us was exactly $60.00 after the tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-springfield?start=20

Our waitress was friendly, but terribly forgetful.  Forget to bring out the entire milkshake my wife ordered, forgot my sauce for my fries, forgot my lemonade until we were nearly finished with our dinner, NEVER refilled our water.  Oh - when she did bring out the fry sauce I ordered, it was the wrong one.  She spent significant time chatting with friends and gave us the quick drive-by - all is okay- look.   Food was not up to par.  My burger and my wife's just didn't taste that great.  My fries weren't fully cooked and overall it just didn't taste that great.   I should have read the other reviews before going here - I'll never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-springfield?start=20

I had also asked for the lettuce, tomato and onions to be omitted.  Well, none of this happened. The waitress took the plate back and I waited while everyone else ate. Eventually my plate returned, this time the burger was right but onion rings were served instead of straws and no fries whatsoever.

Finally a young lady took our drink and appetizer order.  Our short stack of onion rings came out fairly quick.  The server came back and got our food order.  We had a bacon cheeseburger, a blue burger, kids chicken fingers and a kids macaroni.  We received our food in a good amount of time but after that we never saw our server again.  We asked for ketchup since the bottle on the table was empty.  She never returned with one so I took a bottle from another table.  We also never got drink refills so that pretty much put us over the edge.  The food was just okay, other than the blue burger had WAY too much sauce on it.  The last straw was we ended up having to ask another server to bring us our check.   Overall a pretty mediocre experience.  The food was just okay.  Nothing to really rave about.
