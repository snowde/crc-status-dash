Christopher S.,"Staten Island, NY",0,11,,3.0,1/2/2018,Red Robin is a chain known for its burgers and milkshakes. Both the burgers and milkshakes are as promised.  This particular location is strange as it can be VERY hit and miss on cleanliness and service. At times I have been there tables have been pristine and other times have been visibly dirty. Same goes for the service. Sometimes it's great and other leaves a lot to be desired.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island
John N.,"Staten Island, NY",53,151,24,3.0,11/8/2017,It's typical burgers some are good and priced right and some just have way too much going on and a little over priced. Wait staff is always attentive. Burgers to me seem bland from the ones I have had  Tavern double and the smoke and something ?  Not memorable I guess!  Unlimited fries is a good deal why not carb up right ? Oh and onion rings are ok.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island
Liza M.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",0,1,,5.0,9/28/2017,"I defiantly enjoyed my time here. It was nice to come and eat after a long day of shopping with friends. The food is very good and the staff are nice. I suggest to not go on busy days like weekends and Fridays because you have to wait for seats and it's very crowded. But even on busy days I was very satisfied with the food and service, and we got sat down pretty quickly. This is my number one go to when I go to the mall!  P.s I suggest getting the pretzel bites and dip then into caramel. It's so good and the caramel is absolutely delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island
Lyndsay V.,"Staten Island, NY",82,102,258,4.0,8/5/2017,"This is a chain restaurant so you already know what to expect when you arrive. With that being said I have never had a bad experience here. The staff is always kind and even go out the way to make sure we are good when we bring our son.  On the food side, I always order the same thing. Literally, always the same thing! The Banzai Burger. Never have I had any issues and it's literally amazing. My husband changes it up from time to time and I have never had something he absolutely didn't like. Except the ramen buns, but I think they did away with those. For the food and price this place is definitely good stop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island
Kati L.,"Richmond, NY",9,28,1,1.0,1/7/2018,First off they don't give military discounts. That's completely unacceptable. How don't you support the military? Second of all it's a burger joint but you can't get your burger cooked the way you want it? Seriously? Third the waiter was very pushy and we will not be coming back here,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island
Jackie S.,"Staten Island, NY",110,148,489,2.0,9/20/2017,Honestly I should have known better this place has two stars and it's always empty. The waitress was not even attentive despite the fact that no one was in there. We ordered the pickle chips and the wedge salad for an appetizer. The wedge salad hardly had any dressing or toppings on it. I also ordered French onion soup and it literally came out cold and the cheese on top was like a hard block. Like how do you mess up soup? I like my soup to be boiling hot with the melted cheese on top. I also ordered a side of french fries in which I did not know it was free refills until I told the waitress that the first batch came out with literally about 10 fries. It was happy hour so we each got a drink as well. I don't think that this was too bad. First as well as my last time here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island
Maggie L.,"New York, NY",155,248,348,2.0,12/1/2017,"My family and I were seated within 15 minutes upon arrival at this Red Robin location. Service was superb - our female server arrived right away, was quick and addressed each of us as either sweetie or honey.  Food was even quicker. We ordered food for 10+ people and didn't need to wait more than 15 minutes. That was also the problem! All of our burgers were ice cold, as if they were premade and sitting there waiting to be picked up.  I thought the greasy garlic fries were tasty but the burgers were pretty disgusting. I don't recall when the last time I've eaten at Red Robin was, and now I understand why this is so. I likely won't ever visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island

Michelle S.,"Staten Island, NY",179,410,809,3.0,7/19/2016,"I'm giving it a 3 here because of the Ramen Burger. Just take this off the menu. It's a fad and it's not really done well here. The ramen ""buns"" are hard and kind of greasy. Honestly, I just pushed them to the side and had the burger and toppings ( which were good!).

Sabrina F.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",0,12,2,1.0,11/18/2017,"I have been to different Red Robin's around the country and Canada and always had an amazing juicy Mushroom Swiss burger ..I brought my husband to RR because it was his first time and I haven't RR in a few years and I was truly excited to share this experience......welllllll....I ended up ordering my favorite mushroom swiss and honestly it was no better than Mcdonalds quality...even though I asked for pink the meat was still dry and very minimal mushrooms, burger was not served hot so the cheese was not super melted on a crappy bun ...and I had to add my husband's tomato and bacon to make mine more enjoyable. The fries were also half warm..we didn't ask for second round of fries. His Madlove burger was slightly better mostly bc unlike mine it was actually served somewhat hot..but still didn't taste like a $16 burger. Also we were very shocked that we got charged 1.99 ""entertainment fee"" for the games on the tablet...we didn't bother fussing about it we're just not coming back. We ended up going to Fiveguys next door and immediately felt the difference. Would not recommend this RR to a friend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island
Kirsten S.,"Staten Island, NY",271,338,2128,2.0,7/5/2017,I'm not a chain restaurant person but my mother loves this place. She is a fan of the tavern burger with just cheese. She just loves burgers from anywhere but I'm harder to please. Bottomless fries is not a draw when there not that good and even if you are a fan have fun tracking down a waiter for a refill. I'll no doubt be there in the future at some point but only to appease my mom.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island
Jon G.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",0,3,,3.0,11/10/2017,So the burgers are pretty good here but they always take forever to bring the French fries out. When you order your burger it only comes out with like 7 French fires but when you order more (because the fries are bottomless) they take forever to come out. Like 20-30 min. I'm always done with my burger by the time they bring out more fries. It's really annoying.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island
Matthew K.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",7,70,7,2.0,9/13/2017,Another flavorless chain restaurant that resorts to over salting to make their lackluster food have any sort of flavor. I had the Mac and cheese burger and it came out burnt with plain macaroni. Not the first time this has happened but definitely will be the last.

Nicole R.,"Brooklyn, NY",92,34,11,3.0,6/4/2017,"Went today to for an early dinner with my family.  I will say that I'm disappointed my phone died before I actually got my order to take pictures.  For starters we had the ""O-Ring Shorty"". The sauce (not sure if it was honey mustard or chipotle sauce) was amazing. Very tasty.  For dinner my boyfriend had the bacon cheeseburger well done with chili fries which he says were amazing.  My daughter had their Mac and cheese (picky 2 year old) who did eat all of it so I suppose it was to her liking.  As for me I had the ""Turbo-Q Tavern Double"" (with yellow American not the Pepper Jack) and was impressed burgers are of a great quality and the fries are well seasoned.  I do believe this place is is understaffed and was in great questioning as to why one of the workers had Christmas Pajama pants on ... lol overall good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island
Dylan P.,"Castleton Corners, Staten Island, NY",0,15,,1.0,12/1/2017,Waited over an hour and our food did not show up despite large groups who arrived after us getting their food.

Anna T.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,29,44,4.0,8/26/2016,"To all the parents of kids with food allergies, this review is for you.  My son has multiple food allergies, and so dining out isn't usually an option for my family.  A few months ago, on Father's Day Weekend, I really wanted to take my husband out for a meal and include our son.  To my surprise, many mommy websites listed Red Robin as a great restaurant for customers with food allergies.  I looked up their site and was impressed with their interactive allergen menu.  It helped me eliminate the allergens we were avoiding and gave me a sizeable list of options available for him.        This was one of the best allergen menus I've seen.  It was concise and very thorough,  allowing me to decide on his order ahead of time.  Rather than just stick with one or two ""safe options,"" Red Robin offered a variety of options that custom fit his needs.        We arrived at Red Robin right before the busy lunch orders began, so thankfully there wasn't any wait.  When it was time to order, I told the waitress of my son's food allergies, she wrote it all down and said it wouldn't be a problem.  His food arrived a few minutes before everyone else's, our waitress made sure he had the correct order.  Throughout the meal, she kept checking in on us to see if there was anything else we needed.    We ordered the Burnin' Love burger with Fries, Nacho Crunch Tavern Double with salad & balsamic dressing,   from the Kids Menu & Chicken Stickens from the kids menu.  The Burnin' Love burger was juicy and spicy, it was a nice blend of chipotle and pepper jack.  The Nacho Crunch Tavern was yummy! It wasn't as big as I originally thought, but it ended up being very filling.  The pizza was pretty good, my daughter enjoyed it.  My son ordered the chicken stickens & loved it! He loved being part of the group and not being singled out because of his allergies.  For the first time we didn't have to bring a meal from home for my son, he was able to join us and have his own prepared dish.    At the end of the meal, we paid our bill at our table on the Ziosk Tablet.  No more waiting in line or flagging the waitress down for the bill, everything can be done at the table.  Every restaurant should implement the Ziosk table tablets.  Overall, we had a great Father's Day Lunch and are so thankful to the staff of Red Robin for going out of their way to be professional and caring!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island
Alex S.,"Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, NY",35,30,8,2.0,9/19/2017,"I went there with my friend today, we ordered sangria which was watered down, fried pickles, and a wedge salad as appetizers. The fried pickles were good. The wedge salad was dry, barely any dressing on it. My friend ordered French onion soup, a simple thing off the menu, you can't mess that up, but they did. They served her cold soup, with the mozzarella being a big blob, had to send it back. It was disgusting. She ordered a side order of fries and they give us like 10 fries and when she asked why there was barely any fries the waitress told us cause there unlimited...but still give more than 10 fries knowing that they were being shared. The waitress was also really slow, especially for the place being sooo empty. I don't think I would go back. As we were leaving we asked the lady who stands in the front if they had mints she legit gave us a dirty look and said no nastily because we interrupted her being in the phone.

Our server was a young man named Nicholas, he was great. Very attentive and helpful. Restaurants need more servers like him. Our food was great, I mean is a human being actually capable of making a bad burger? I just didnt like the mayonnaise, i think it was miracle whip. No Human on this planet should use Miracle Whip.

Had plates with food stuck under them as well. JUST SO DIRTY!).

Jennifer W.,"Brooklyn, NY",115,160,118,2.0,8/11/2015,"I came here today with my sister for lunch while shopping. The service was subpar. The wait staff was nice but when you have one waitress for like 15 tables, you know it isn't going to be great. I'm giving this place 2 stars because the food was decent but that's about it.  We ordered the Guacamole and Salsa with chips for the appetizer. The portion was so small it was ridiculous...the bowl of chips was probably about 8-10 tortilla chips. The guacamole and salsa were good though. Even if you ordered a few different appetizers, the portion would still be too tiny in my opinion.  For the main course, we both had the keep it simple burger which came with toppings on the side and bottomless fries. I only know the fries were bottomless because it said so on the menu but no one ever told us we were entitled to refills.  When our meal was served, I was asked by the runner if I needed anything and I asked for honey mustard sauce which I never received. We just used the salsa and guacamole for the fries. Our waitress did not check on us once to see if we needed anything and my sister didn't have any water or soda to finish her burger. It literally could take one minute to check on someone and she should have came back at least once. No one ever asked us if we wanted more fries or a refill either. We also waited about 10-15 minutes for the check after finishing everything on our table. I doubt this place cares that they have a 2 star rating on Yelp. They are located in the mall which means people will always come here based on convenience. There aren't many options for food in the mall and they know they will always get customers coming in because of their location not their service. I think it's safe to say I will never come back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=20

George C.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",0,8,,1.0,7/23/2017,"After I was sat down at my table, I waited 15 minutes for a waitress to come over and greet me.I almost forgot,  I waited on line for 20 minutes to be seated with about a third of the tables being empty. The service was slow because every time I rang a bell to call for service, it took the waitress 10 minutes to call on me.It was 5:00 and the place was half empty. Finally after a 45 minutes wait when I first sat down,the food didn't look appetizing. The burger I ordered looked flat, no way looking like the picture on the menu. They gave a few french fries, no way filling up the basket like the picture on the menu. It took them additional 20 minutes to bring out the second refill of french fries. The ice tea I ordered was horrible, it taste flat and too sweet. After I paid the bill with my credit card,a woman ran after me in the parking lot accusing me of not paying my tab. She yelled at me like an animal, not showing me any respect. Unfortunately for me,I didn't swipe the card correctly, that is my mistake.

The appetizers arrived quickly:stuffed mushrooms,cheese sticks & onion rings:  Apparently they did not change the frying oil; they All had a horrible aftertaste!  Which even the dipping sauces provided did not improve the taste. I ordered the ""Bleu Ribbon"" burger the only thing I ate was the meat itself; the bread and fillings had a weird taste. Also the steak fries had the same weird aftertaste as the fried appetizers. I just left everything on the plate uneaten... talk about a hot mess of a meal. The price for the meal would've been reasonable ..if the food was good; but it was unpalatable. I was really looking forward to have a nice experience there; but I won't be eating at that Red Robin in Staten Island again.

Nina L.,"New York, NY",497,694,98,4.0,3/17/2014,"After countless commercials on local television*, the greater New York area finally has a Red Robin location.  Firstly, really Yelpers of Staten Island? Some of the commentary on this page is not to be believed. I think what is missed here is that Red Robin is in fact a chain restaurant. You aren't stepping into the next big thing when it comes to 'gourmet burgers,' but instead are dealing with a glorified Burger King. When you're shopping in the Staten Island Mall, don't try to find that too shocking.  As for the food, it's okay. It's on the same page as other nearby chain establishments like Applebees, TGIF, and others. You mostly dine places like this to get an affordable meal when you're out and about. I do agree that the wait times are a bit crazy at the moment seeing as they've just opened, but to try something new it was worth the extra 15 minutes or so. I got the Whiskey River BBQ burger and it was fairly tasty. Doused in solid, zesty sauce and topped with crispy fried onions it was disgustingly satisfying. I love the idea of bottomless fries to quell my need for an exuberant amount of carbohydrates in one sitting. For the frequently mentioned service, I didn't find it to be better or worse than any other restaurant in the area. Our waiter was actually quite pleasant and attentive even though the dining room was extremely busy. When we sat down I was feeling a bit woozy from not eating all day and requested my fries arrive as soon as possible. They came piping hot within minutes! We also split a salted caramel shake and instead of bring one large cup and two straws, he nicely had it separated and garnished**, with the salted caramel (which was too salty, sorry RR), and huge dollops of whipped cream.  Overall, I don't see what all the negative fuss is about on this business' Yelp page. I wish them success and if I'm ever desperate in the Staten Island Mall I wouldn't mind stopping in again. *I'm a complete sucker for moving pictures of fake-ly glazed burgers. **Yes I used garnished in a Red Robin review...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=40
Vinny U.,"Staten Island, NY",179,172,1353,1.0,1/21/2016,"Ok so while visiting the lego displays at the mall we decided to eat here . Geez first of all when we walked in to the establishment the girl at the front podium just continued chatting and laughing with a coworker and didnt even acknowledge us untill i said umm hi can we step inside and sit ourselves or do we have to wait for you ? So then we finnaly sat and waited about 15 mins for anyone to come over and ask us if we wanted anything to drink and or order appetizers ,  but that was ok because our waiter was the kid that just walked in as we were entering too so i understood it wasnt his fault because they should have sent someone else to start us off while he gets ready . So now while we're waiting we noticed they have those new electronic touchscreen thingys on all the tables and that was pretty cool because you can now look at the menu on there and there's games on it for the kids BUT didn't help much with 3 kids trying to play at the same time lol ,It was pretty dead inside and all the tables around us were empty so we asked if we can grab the one on the other table and the waiter apologized and said sorry im not allowed to do that which i didnt understand why if no one is there but no problem i know he doesnt make the rules !! I ordered a burger med rare and onion rings and the kids got chicken fingers and a burger , they split it 50/50 . Now here's where it gets bad , my burger came well well DONE LIKE A DEEP FRIED AND OVER GRILLED HOCKEY PUCK but i didnt say anything and just ate it because i was hungry and i didnt wanna sit too long because if you have kids you know where im coming from lol just wanted to eat quick before the kids started buggin out lol. The onion rings were perfect and the thai dipping sauce was delicious but the fries were blah very boring , just steak fries but thats it . Imo they should season them or something and oh yeah i forgot to mention they have some sort of seasoning on the table but if i have to do it myself then i might as well make my own burger too. Towards the end the waiter came and asked if everything was ok and he noticed half of my burger was just sitting there so i said ""dude look at the burger its very well done "" and he said "" didnt you say med rare "" i said yup and he then said wait let me get you a new one and i said naaa man its all good i was starving so just ate some and thats all ,He then sent over the manager who was also a sweetheart . She said ih sir let us give you something else on us amd i said no its ok but thank  you and she said ok im so sorry about that i will remove it from the check which she did. So overall my burger sucked but the onion rings were good , probably my last time visiting this location and I've heard that this is one of the worst ones around. Thanks for the heads up Jason C . Try at your own risk but ill be at millers ale house or somewhere else next time !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=40
Jasmine C.,"Brooklyn, NY",129,194,274,4.0,2/2/2014,"We had to wait in line for our table, but I find their waiting service very nice. They would text you when your table is ready, which allows you to walk around the mall.  Our waitress was nice and friendly. When our food was taking a while to get here, she would notify us even though we didn't ask.  I ordered a freckled lemonade, which is minute maid lemonade with strawberries, nothing special but it does taste good. We got the Shorty Rings which comes in 6 pieces with two different sauce, love the orange sauce. I ordered the Royal Red Robin burger, which was good but gets very messy. My boyfriend ordered the California Chicken burger, which also look good but don't know what it taste like.

Arianna M.,"Staten Island, NY",83,14,17,1.0,2/17/2016,"The service in this restaurant is literally some of the worst I have ever experienced. To start, there is never, ever someone at the hostess stand. You have to wait 5-10 minutes just to be seated. Next, there's no one busing tables. You walk in and there's 10 tables with dirty dishes because no one is going around cleaning them. It takes ages for a server to come to your table, even with the light blinking obnoxiously. And when they do, they're usually rude. There's really no purpose to the displays. If you're gonna have them on the table, let me order from it. I really think the poor service is managements problem. Just because it's located inside a mall doesn't mean the service should suffer. If anything, you have a higher flow of traffic because of your location. Get it together.

Leslie C.,"ASTORIA, NY",190,139,28,2.0,7/28/2014,"Rarely ever do I follow suite with nearly all of the previous reviews, but this Red Robin has a serious issue.....service.   I've been to handful of Red Robins in multiple states and this is by far, the worst experience I've had. The waitress was extremely nice, but, despite an empty restaurant, and I do mean empty, our food, 2 burgers, took 30-40 minutes.  After what proved to be an eternity to receive our food, BOTH of our orders were incorrect.   Dear Red Robin Gourmet Burger headquarters, listen up! The kitchen staff at this location either need to ALL be fired, or they need an intensive retraining session.  Let's be honest, the cooks and expediting stations are not making complicated meals, they are primarily making burgers and fries.  To say that the wait time for the burgers is unacceptable is an understatement and I can guarantee that if you do not address and bring in some veterans to run the kitchen properly, this business will fail.  I was shocked to hear that this location has already been open for 8 months; the mistakes that were made were rookie mistakes, something simply doesn't add up. Needless to say, I will not be revisiting this location anytime soon.

It didn't get on me, but it made me sick after what I'd just eaten. We couldn't eat our food so we just paid and left hungry.

After being seated we waited OVER HALF AN HOUR for our waitress. She came by twice saying she'll be with us shortly. Meanwhile, she didn't take our drink orders yet. After over 35 min, my MIL, asked if she would take our orders. She rolled her eyes as if we were being a nuisance. Btw, we also tried using the tablet that's on the tables but we couldn't order or our water and juices. So we clicked on ""call waiter"" & it was just blinking. That's probably why she said she would be with us shortly but never came.  I would've complained to the manager but didn't want to get her in trouble. Now thinking back, I should've.

Also, check if people need more drinks. Burgers were delicious. I spoke to a manager there who asked if everything was ok and I told her about the missing stuff in the salad and she said that their supplier had a bad shipment of boiled eggs that were contaminated from the asian flu, so no eggs in any red robins. Maybe it's time for them to switch to a different suppliers. This is one thing that worrys me about eating out, not knowing where our food is being processed.

Nancy M.,"Staten Island, NY",0,3,,1.0,11/16/2014,"Today was the first time I went to Red Robin and it will be my last. I went there this evening with my boyfriend and a friend of ours, and let me express my great dissatisfaction of my experience there.  First we walked in and the hostess greeted us with an attitude. As a hostess and the first person I see when I walk into an establishment (especially for the first time) I should be greeted with a smile, a ""How are you?"" and asking how many will be in my party. Not me having to initiate the conversation. We were told we had to wait 20-25 minutes, which, at the time, was fine after seeing a few people in the waiting area already when we walked in. 20 minutes go by and we sit down, however, we see not one person actually leave the restautant (and there's only was entrance and exit because this location is set up in a mall and the mall was already closed, our mall closes at 6PM on Sundays.) We finally sat down and I count that there are 14 tables in total and more than half of them could have sat 3 people and no one had left the restaurant!  I would understand if it was a Saturday and dinner time, or even if it was busy tonight, but it wasn't! As I looked around at the empty tables, 3 of them weren't cleaned, including one next to us. Our waitress finally came over and never introduced herself or welcomed us to the restaurant she didn't even seem like she wanted to be there in any way. After waiting for our drinks to come (which took about 15 minutes) the tables still weren't cleaned and there were absolutely no bus boys or anyone else making an attempt to clean them!! Still not knowing our waitresses name, she was subpar and didn't understand my order or the menu item of the combo salad with a soup. I ordered a Caesar salad with a Tortilla Chip Soup and she said ""So you want a Caesar Wrap"" as a statement and not a question. I corrected her and even though she seemed confused as anything she thankfully she got my order right.  Half an hour goes by and we get our food. The 2 burgers that my boyfriend and friend ordered were decent, not the best and the fries weren't even hot. The salad and soup I got was ok. Nothing amazing for $10. The salad was small and the soup was way to cheesey  and the chicken within it tasted fake and rubbery beyond belief. The menu item itself is misleading to say it had vegetables whereas it only has corn.  Now that we're almost done with our food at this point, the food that had been sitting at the table next to us the whole time still hasn't been cleared along with the other tables! Our waitress at no point came over to us and checked how we were and when she did she didn't even ask if we wanted refills on the fries that came with the other 2 orders or our drinks. As she started to take the plates away we had to say that we wanted refills on the fries and she seemed baffled and took the plates away and brought us more fries. Finally when it came time to get the check (we finally learned the name of the waitress off of the receipt) she tosses the check holder onto the table! After the tedious wait of about 25 minutes for her to come back and forth, we're finally able to leave. After this horrible experience, I will NEVER come back to Red Robin. The service, waitresses, and entire  knowledge of the staff needs to be greatly assessed because this was probably one of the worst experiences I EVER had in my life!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=40

When we finally got to our seats and ordered our food everything was great until the food came.   There wasn't any silverware on the table or napkins so we had to wait until the wait staff came back. Then someone at our table (of 3) didn't get half their order. We waited another 15 minutes before our waitress came back to tell her. When we told her she says sorry then disappears. We wait another 10-15 minutes our waitress not even in sight so we ask another waiter.  So we have another 10 minute wait. Finally a random waitress tells the manager and he takes care of it. The staff here just seems to not care and just straight up disappear. Also the endless fries? Never even got the chance to ask for more(if I wanted any) since the wait staff just disappears after you get your order. The food wasn't amazing and it's definitely not worth the wait.

John J.,"Staten Island, NY",1,92,,5.0,4/3/2015,"Went here again last night, with a friend. Once again, the food was great. They specialize in burgers here, and they really do a great job. The burgers also come with never ending fries, so I got a couple orders of them. The burger was awesome, the fries were good. Service: Our order took about 15 minutes to be brought to us. I did ask for my burger to be well done, and I think 15 minutes is reasonable, I take about 8 minutes to cook a burger at home, and I don't make it well done, so 15 minutes is reasonable. Price: Red Robin, please do something about the price. My burger was 10.29, not the worst, but alittle high, considering I can buy 4 burgers for $7 at supermark to make on my own grill, my friend's burger was 13.99, and he ordered a drink which was 4.49 (a lemonade drink, not an alcoholic drink).. So at the end of the meal, I was satisfied, my burger was really good, and a nice size, I had 2 orders of fries, so maybe that makes up for the higher price. My friend however was extremely pissed off, he wound up putting in $22 for his share of the order and tax/tip. He was pissed and said he doesn't want to come here any more. $22 for a burger and lemonade is ridiculous, without the tip his share still would of cost $19. I don't think anyone should pay $19 for a burger and lemonade. other than the price, this place in my opinion, is the best place to eat in the staten island mall and its area of neighboring restaurants across the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=60

The beginning of the incompetent was with the hostess who act as if she had no idea what was going on with the tables and couldn't seat us yet. I had a very long wait, close to one hour for 3 people. Next the general service was poor, our waters took a good amount of time to come out. The burgers we ordered were not cooked the way we asked, we all ordered medium rare but received charred, tasteless and dry burgers. This is when the service got bad on their part. My girlfriend had asked for more water, and the busboy decided to stand next to the manager with another bus boy, conversing in the middle on the restaurant. I'm glad i didn't noticed that the bus boy that was asked to get water for us was the one that was standing there, but i eventually got up and asked for it. The best part was he replied to us"" i was gonna tell your waiter to get it"". I was just stunned by this, because generally that is part of a busies job.

Told them to forget the soup at this point. Then waiter made it seem like it was the chefs fault?  - Again, the waiters body odor nearly killed me as time went on.  - Burgers came back, and mine is STILL wrong. Oh, and the fries were cold.

So basically it was an hour 35 minutes. While we were waiting, we overheard the hostess say there were empty tables of 4 but they' weren't seating us because there are parties of 4 that aren't here yet.  So we finally sit down and looked over the rather small and menu and ordered our food and drinks. Our soda was flat and we had to send it back 3 times before deciding there is no good soda here. Then it took 45 minutes to bring us 3 simple burgers. When we got it, the burgers were cold. The bun, the cheese, the fries were cold. The meat was overcooked and the overall burgers were bland even with bacon and sauce. We all saw the bottom of the bottomless fries and was not offered refills despite their ""bottomless steak fries"" advertisement everywhere. The eating utensils were dirty and full of water spots.

Now that I got a persons attention and gave fair warning I wish I read others comments before going to this red robin in staten island mall. Next time I'll make the LONGER trip to New Jersey or to Long Island. I went cause I figured it would be just as good as other locations. I have no idea who manages this location or owns this franchise but it's bound to fail if they don't fix this issue. Place was barely full and had to wait around for 15 minutes. I walk in to see plenty of open tables. Then they try to seat me near this corner table which was so tight but was allowed to change once they cleaned another table. Yes tight and yes cause perhaps I'm TO FAT and yes I should stop complaining I can't fit in that booth and not go there but already there and I'm a foodie. Well I order my drinks along with some wings which had no sauce on them not to mention that they mention you can get dipping sauces. Waited around hoping for server to come, yes the place was still somewhat not busy. Almost ate my wings, another person brings food and I ask about my dipping sauce & was told they'll ask my server, the server returns & asks what do I want? Really.? I'm wondering if it was written down, I'm asked what do I want so I said I'd need to see menu then states to me that now they recall and will get it. Now for my food complaint, yes the allure is bottomless fries which are great if you can get them here cause by time my server came back I just ate what my girlfriend left. I was fed up waiting for service. I know if it was busy it would be a reason. Got the prime rib dip but sandwich was COLD and so was my girlfriend burger. My sandwich had cheese which cause it got colder the cheese started,to coagulate. Service was slow that my girlfriend got up to go get a bottle of ketchup from another table for use. The hostess seemed overwhelmed or confused of what to do when I was waiting on line with others waiting as well. My server seemed annoyed but to be fair it's January first and maybe tired from partying or I should just not judge cause after all I seldom saw them come to my table! Speaking of lack of service I could even hear the couple that came in when I was almost done complain that they were disappointed in service and felt they should've gone next door to eat there.

As a vet I only qualified for the free Tavern Double Burger with bottomless steak fries while my pal had a Bacon Guacamole  Burger and onion rings.

Word of advice, please hire people that actually need a job rather than those that get hired by chance that don't care. Really, like come one not only have I gotten bad service ONCE but TWICE, while giving it a second Chance.  First time, we take our seats, table is dirty, waitress comes and I can tell already she was not very outgoing and rude. Later on, I ask for water and she kept on walking by forgetting my water while giving the guy across from me a water. So I tell her again and she walked away obnoxiously as if I said something wrong. Not very pleasant! Second time, we take our seats, table is dirty so our waitress switches our seat with a sarcastic tone. Anyway, she seemed very nice, so when we got the check, we were deciding to give her more tip than we usually do (which is 20%). Bill was $35, we put $40, while getting out more singles for tip but she automatically grabbed it without asking us or asking if we needed the change. We were waiting to put a few dollars more when we get the $5 change but nooooo instead we look back and she says ""do you need anything else?"" Answering her own question"", have a good day now"" wow did that set me off. Boyfriend and I had our jaws dropped, in complete shock. We were going to go to the manager but figured that this whole place is crap and if you hired these amateurs than I'm sure the manager must be just like them. That food wasn't worth the service.  P.s. don't forget the hostess. Both times they sucked. They are very slow to adapting to what you are saying. First time, she looked at us like we speaked gibberish. Second time, we walk in, guy that looks like manager greets us but he sees the hostess are not talking to us, busy looking at a paper and talking amongst each other, not acknowledging us at all, he walks away without saying anything to them. Then I ask them about royal club card and then she asks me are you eating here tonight? I'm like yeah and then they ignore us again to talk then finally, ""follow me, no wait, one minute...

We were seated in the corner and then literally forgotten about. Not a single person came over to ask us if we needed something, how our food was, nada. I went here once before and have to say I enjoyed the burger, so I ordered it again. Ten years later, we had a different girl deliver our cheeseburgers, which we all ordered and had asked to be cooked differently. So how the hell were we supposed to know which burger was which? The moron's answer ""Oh, I don't know. The guy in the back knows by looking at it."" So, is he going to take a bite out of my burger to see which one is well done and which one was medium rare? Can he see through the burger?Then she disappeared, one burger got sent back and we waited almost half an hour for a new one. I also got to hear the never ending complaining from my family, how this place ""Sucks and the food is terrible."" Those were the words from an 81 year old.

Pepper J.,"Staten Island, NY",0,2,,1.0,11/13/2013,"This place is beyond bad. And to be soo bad soo soon is a real concern. It usually takes a poorly managed, inherently bad establishment about 6 months to show its true color, but this one seems to have accomplished that in a few weeks.  I tried to eating there twice hoping my first experience was just a bad night, but I was wrong. On my first visit my burger had a foul taste and it was served on a cold damp hard pretzel bun.  When the imported manager seeing my dish picked apart in my attemp to salvage something ask how It was and I said really bad. Her reply, ""Oh well, sorry"". Not sure how folks in Iowa feel, but in NY with a place like this on every corner, that won't fly. On my second visit my wife's sweet potato fries were frozen, the roll on my French dip was hard and stale and my fries were hard and cold. Oh I did get a teaspoon full of cole slaw and all for the shocking price of $14.00. Even if it wasn't old, stale and bad it wouldn't have been worth that. The wait staff is mostly confused but very polite. I assume most are imported as well, but I'm sure the politeness will fad when locals take over and are deluged by complaints on a daily basis.

Tori N.,"Staten Island, NY",35,81,66,1.0,1/5/2014,We've been here twice. Both times our burgers came out cold. The second time our server was MIA for over 20 minutes and didn't bother to pre-bus our table when dropping off the check. The staff are more interested in goofing around with each other than taking care of the customers. Never again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=100
Victoria T.,"Staten Island, NY",0,13,,1.0,6/6/2014,"Believe the reviews that state ok to very good food and HORRIBLE service.  Was here a few months ago and had a terrible experience, had to chase down wait staff, waited forever for the food, food order for 7 year old came wrong, took another 20 minutes to get the right thing, etc.  I vowed never to return.  But my son liked his little pizza and the free balloon (you know how kids are) so I figured we would give it another chance. Went back last night with my husband and 2 sons.  Same story as the last time, only worse.  When we walked in no hostess was around, she showed up at least 5 minutes later, said she would be right back, another bit of time, she came back to seat us.  Then just like our last visit 3 months ago, no wait service to be found for 12 minutes (timed it this time). We ordered our food and did get our drinks pretty quickly.  But then you wait and wait, you never see your wait staff again, and you wait some more.  As we were looking around the room, we could see many people complaining to various staff, others walking out after waiting for wait staff, others walking out after waiting for food for an hour (for appetizer).  I would have walked out too but my kids were hungry and it's hard to explain to them that we've been waiting to long.  APPETIZERS finally came after about 45 min, food followed that another half an hour later.  Overall, 2 hour meal, most of that time spent waiting.  We also had no silverware or napkins on our table, I spilled my drink while waiting and had to go through my purse looking for a tissue to wipe up the spill.  Food was ok when it came, a bit cold from sitting around.  It didn't come with the side of bbq sauce that I ordered and the amount of fries in my little cup holder was anemic.  LIke others have said, what good is bottomless fries if you can never find any staff to order them?  I will say that our waitress was pleasant and seemed to be trying to do a good job and I give her credit for a decent attitude when so many people are complaining.  Not sure what the problem is here, but think that there are many, front of the house needs to get in order and obviously there is some type of problem in the kitchen.   If you are looking for this type of food, honestly, go across the aisle to Applebees. I can't believe that this place will stay in business at this locale for long if this keeps up.  I really felt badly for people sitting there for over an hour with no food who had small kids with them........just terrible......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=100
Michelle F.,"Heartland Village, NY",0,3,,1.0,3/12/2014,Horrible service.  Waitress Christine was s total nightmare.  Never in my life have I gotten such poor service anywhere.  The restaurant was not even crowded so it cannot be because of that.  Never again !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=100
Rose C.,"Manhattan, NY",21,98,1,1.0,11/26/2013,"Like so many, I was excited about Red Robin coming to the SI Mall. I usually drive to Jersey when I'm in the mood for quality burgers which in the past they always served. However, this time I was unsatisfied. I expected much more because it's a new place. You just assume they will try harder and be at the top of their game. Not the case, unfortunately. First of all, the service left a lot to be desired. We had to wait almost 35 min. for a table and then were seated at a huge round table for 6 right smack in the center of everything (we were 2 adults and a 5 yr old). Needless to say we weren't happy. When we told the maître'd we wanted to sit elsewhere (there was an empty booth a few feet away, she went to the manager (brown haired girl with a pony tail - this was sunday nite around 7pm) who informed us that we couldn't have the booth because there were people on the way for it. I then remarked that didn't know one could reserve a table at RedRobin - I would have requested a booth when I first walked in. She then said that I couldn't do that. You have to take what's available. Huh? I was puzzled. When I tried to push it she changed her tune and said it had to do with the number of tables assigned to each server. The bottom line is that it was just ridiculous how bad their customer service is. The maitre'd didn't know what to say when pressed and clearly the person to blame was the manager. She was just plain rude. So we wound up sitting at this uncomfortable table and the meal started off badly. The irony is that the booth we wanted sat empty for 25 min. while we ate. It was then given to 3 teenagers who didn't strike me like they had called in advance for it. Advice to Red Robin - I have driven to Jersey with my family numerous times to eat at Red Robin but I will never return to your SI mall location. You don't treat a customer with a family that way. If your staff is amateurish and ill mannered then perhaps you should provide more training because they will ruin your business. That being said, the burgers were dry and lackluster. Also, I ordered a side of coleslaw and the tiny amount they give you should really just be complimentary or give a bit more because a thimbleful is just absurd. There is such a thing as being too greedy, guys. I was so disappointed because this would have been my go to place to eat during my Xmas shopping excursions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=100
Ruel D.,"Staten Island, NY",32,8,1,2.0,2/12/2014,"After shopping with my brother-in-law and niece, we decided to come to Red Robins for lunch where we met up with mutual friends. Service was no existent, we were with kids and it was not worth being here. 20 minutes to be seen for our order is ridiculous. I admit that the food I ordered (grilled chicken wrap) was delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=100

dance t.,"Cary, NC",2,67,,4.0,2/16/2014,"Great burgers. You can tell open flames touched the meat! So good. So so good... That's assuming you get your burger before if gets cold waiting in the kitchen for pickup. The service was disorganized, but friendly. I didn't get forks or a napkin and my wife had to go grab it elsewhere. But we got refills before asking, so that is a plus. Two stars for service but four stars for the burgers! The fries were nothing special but next time I will ask if they have curly fries. Onion rings were great. Will go back until service gets really bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=100
Fran A.,"Staten Island, NY",0,33,1,1.0,11/26/2013,"Sorry, Red Robin, but you're just getting worse instead of better.  Our 4th visit was yesterday and it was pretty bad.  Hostesses up front have been clueless on every visit.  3 of them with their heads together trying to figure things out.  You have to stand on top of them to get their attention.  We got seated next to a bussing station where a mob of busboys with lots of time on their hands were very loud and obnoxiously yakking and banging on a garbage can.  We got up and moved to another table and complained to a manager who apologized.  Next, the women's restroom was filthy.  Dirty toilets, empty paper rolls, paper all over the floor, and overflowing gargage can.  Next, our burgers were overdone and not hot by the time they got to our table.  Had to send the food runner back for sauce she forgot to bring.  I should have looked at the check more carefully, too, because we got charged for salad which should have been a free substitution with our burgers.  On 3 out of 4 visits it was obvious that the servers don't know the menu.  When (if ever) is someone going to do some TRAINING in this place?  No one knows what they're doing!!  I was originally hoping to go for the perks of the Red Robin Royalty program but I am losing patience with this place and might just forget about ever going back.  It seems all the employees here are too young, too inexperienced, and too lacking in plain and simple manners to do their jobs well.  Bye-bye, Red Robin!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=120
Jessica P.,"Staten Island, NY",0,3,,1.0,1/5/2014,Have been to other red robins before and this one was by far the worst. Poor service. Poor service is enough to make me not go back. The food was great and no problems with the food at all. Just the service. I was told about a loyalty club my server was going to sign me up for and didn't. Just like he forgot to bring out my dessert my mother in law ordered for my birthday. The table wasn't bused between appetizers and the meals. He was no where around when I wanted to order another drink. When we asked for a to go box we got it. Just no bag. It was like the server couldn't get rid of us fast enough once we asked for a to go box because he handed us the check with it.We did want dessert but since the check had  been handed to us and I was annoyed already I paid and left. The only reason I tipped him was because I'm a waitress at a restaurant and know what this kid is probably making an hour.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-staten-island?start=120
