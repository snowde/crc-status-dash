Jennifer R.,"Antioch, CA",70,14,,3.0,11/10/2017,"2nd visit in about 2 months. Pretty much the same experience. The food is always great but the service is painfully slow. Our first visit was definitely the worst..... we stood there waiting for close to 15 minutes to be sat while taking notice of the almost empty restaurant. The manager came around the corner and was very embarrassed that we'd been waiting so long and quickly and sweetly sat us and also offered an appetizer on the house to apologize.  The manager changed our opinions with her kind gesture and very sweet nature, she is fantastic!! So, the 4 of us were quickly back to our initial feeling after waiting another 10 minutes to be greeted by our server, order drinks and our appetizer. Basically we waited about 20 minutes between server visits when we were all ordering drinks..... we figured it was a fluke... obviously we were wrong.  So, next visit it's me, my Husband and our Son. Pretty much the same thing happened minus the helpful manager. My Husband ordered a few beers and waited quite a while for each. We had to use the 'call server' button on the tablet.  The food is still fantastic, the prices are great and the location is good.....and if you're willing to turn a 45 minute dinner into a 2 hour wait-a-thon, have at it. I'd give this place 1 star but the manager and food deserve to be recognized.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton
Ashley J.,"Stockton, CA",28,10,9,1.0,12/7/2017,"Red Robin is our favorite restaurant. With that being said, I will avoid this location from now on. We were sat quickly but it took at least 15 mins for anyone to acknowledge us, and there were only around 5 other small tables, not busy at all.  Our drinks, appetizer and food came out all at the same time - - ****37 minutes after ordering**** - - and yes I sure did time it after it took that long for anyone to even come take our order. I can understand that time on the food but seriously, no drinks? 37 mins for onion rings?  Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton
Antonio M.,"Lakeview, Stockton, CA",36,1,,1.0,10/4/2017,"Terrible service! We basically ordered all our food through the kiosk. Told they only had seating at bar, due to low server staff so we sat. Thinking ok will be fine, boy were we wrong. I wont be coming back management needs to step up help out its servers if under staffed. Very sad cause we liked the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton
Asia V.,"Lathrop, CA",0,16,22,5.0,1/7/2018,"We had a good experience at Red Robin. Stopped in for lunch, it was not too crowded, but we choose to sit in the bar area because the game was on. Every seat had a good view of a t.v. The bar tender even though she was alone was very attentive. The food came out quickly. We shared the voodoo fries, they were just ok but I had the srarcha burger and hubby had the weggie burger which was with no bread. We both enjoyed our meals.  The drinks were good also.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton
Melanie S.,"Stockton, CA",93,2,,1.0,1/8/2018,"Very disappointed. Walked in to order Togo. After getting home opened our boxes and they just couldn't do it right. On our bacon cheeseburger we wanted mustard and ketchup only and it only had tons of mayo on it , no mustard and no ketchup... called to complain and was told we will get an email. We should of just waited till I opened my black and blue burger. I asked for no onions and it has tons of onions on it . I didn't want to call back so I'm just writing a review. The were not busy and we just wasted $40 for nothing. One reason I hate eating out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton
Matthew C.,"Stockton, CA",30,10,2,5.0,1/4/2018,Came here in Saturday 10/31 with 7 other people and was greeted and seated promptly. Our waitress whom I forgot her name (leticia I think ) was very personable and was on her toes. She made sure we were well taken care of and always topped off our fries and drinks. Our food came out fast and hot. Overall we had a great experience here at Red Robbin! We will be back!

Richard T.,"Stockton, CA",43,4,2,1.0,11/17/2017,"Just wow,nobody knew how to use the remote in the bar I asked them to put on the kings game and they ignored me and left it on golf for 45 minutes. I grabbed my own menu,took about ten minutes to get service because they were really busy organizing glasses. I attempted to change my appetizer order. As soon as I said ""So I ordered an appetizer"" the bar back or server(red shirt) cut me off and said "" it will be out as soon as it's ready"" and continued organizing glasses and coversating with another customer.ordered Sam Adams WINTER ALE and it was flat.

Anthony D.,"Marseille, France",71,167,398,2.0,2/10/2017,"Definitely not my happy burger place. A little disappointed in this restaurant. People were telling me how good was the burger, but I found the burger super dry and not tasty. Maybe a fluke ?  Drinks are good, lot's of choice and appetizer are big and tasty. I recommend them. But service was really impeccable, our lady was super nice and friendly. Red Robin likes new tech gadget, so now you can order appetizer on a tablet on your table. You can even pay with it, super easy and fast to check out.  To summarize, I won't come back there for the food, but maybe to get a drink around the nice bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton

Kimberly L.,"Stockton, CA",62,49,42,1.0,10/2/2017,"I will not be coming back here. I'm writing this from inside the bathroom stall of the women's bathroom while my insides try to become my outsides. Came here for a quick birthday dinner with my husband. We ordered the boneless buzz wings, a mushroom burger for me, and a bbq burger for my husband. Everything was going okay...the server was sweet and doing her best but there were issues in the kitchen where they had to suddenly change out the oil in the fryers, and so things took an extended period of time, but we were in no rush so no big deal. I go to pay for our check and suddenly, my stomach seized up. It came on literally in the blink of an eye. Fine one minute, and sick and all get out the next. I waited a second, breathed, and hoped it was just food settling. No. Another horrible spasm, and I knew I was in trouble. My husband told me to run and he'd handle the check; I barely made it to their bathroom before all hell broke loose. So here I sit, sweating hold and cold shivers, feeling like I'm going to vomit for 20 minutes now with my body literally expelling everything it can. This feels like food poisoning.  Graphic? Gross? You bet your bottom it is. But it's my current situation and I'm pretty sure the food is the culprit. I thought my mushrooms tasted a little fishy but put that down to maybe them being sauteed a certain way. Now I'm not so sure...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton

We're here right now and we were told they only have 2 servers and there are two big parties (15+) so we were given a choice: sit at the bar or wait 25 mins. We sat the bar. The bartender was serving 6 tables. I honestly felt like we were at a cafeteria. We ordered got our food, and after that we were never checked on. Our waters were never refilled, and we never saw the bartender/server again.

Tim D.,"Stockton, CA",0,26,1,1.0,12/9/2017,I tried to overlook the other reviews as I always loved the Red Robin in Manteca. I was however very disappointed in the Stockton location. Half empty and standing room only at the reception desk. Once we were seated it was the typical 10 minutes until a server arrived. During that time we didn't notice any other servers as they all seemed to hide in the back. Once she arrived she was friendly and asked if we were ready to order. As a previous server it's standard to ask for appetizers first. Up sell the customer on appetizers and drinks. Nope. Then as soon as the last person ordered she was gone. Food finally arrived after 15 minutes which isn't bad but we had to ask for silverware and napkins. When we were done they no longer ask if you would like dessert. Once again up sell people. It was my sons birthday and we had to push the electronic payment machine back to say we weren't finished. Overall I won't be back to this location. Food was typical but server and hostess training is lacking and it's very apparent. The management really needs to step up their game or they will be like all the other big names that failed in that location.  Servers: 20% of a 50$ check is 10 bucks. Up Sell appetizers and drinks and it's now a 100$ check. Boom 20 bucks for an hour of basic serving. Do it for yourself if you don't care about the company.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton

Didi O.,"Stockton, CA",63,107,620,4.0,9/4/2017,My son loves this place . I would rate the cleanliness to 3 . Maybe it's a busy place or there's not a lot of crew in here that they don't pay attention to cleanliness . Anyways the best time to come here is during happy hour when most of the appetizers are 50% off Monday to Friday 3-6 pm. The first time we came the service is a little slow. But he second one it was a little faster . There's one waitress that was really good  and thought about everything took care of our needs and exceeded our expectations. Sorry I did forget her name but I'm still coming back so I would see her again . The food I great . Kids love it . Great to try the diff burgers . It comes with bottomless fries ( garlic) . Love it and they will really offer it to u again . The appetizers are really good too . So come by and visit . Hope u will like it,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton
David T.,"Manteca, CA",0,2,3,1.0,11/30/2017,"Okay, first of all, the burger is okay; however, all the staff's waiters including the manager with the tattoo arm are taking their F**KING long time almost an hour! I was waiting my food arrive and it took about 23 minutes. Even though it's not that busy! After I was done eating my burger. I ask the manager to hand me the bill, so she told me I had to wait a minute. While I am waiting when she come back, it took like 17 minutes. I ask many times to give me the bill, so I will pay the GOD F**KING DAMAGE food bill! All the waiter services freaking ignore me when I ask to hand me the bill. The services were chit chat, while everyone still waiting there food and waiting there bill.  I should have walked out of here and not paid for it.

Ria T.,"Stockton, CA",62,43,45,3.0,2/8/2017,"My first order was incorrect so l sent it back. Then my next burger was beyond burnt so I asked the Manager to remove it from my bill because I didn't want to piss off the cook for complaining a third time. The manager was very apologetic and insisted I take a free burger to go. I slowly gave him my order and when he got back with the burger it was still incorrect, lol. I specifically asked for ciabatta bread and received a regular bun. But hey at least I got pepper jack cheese on there that time, so I guess that's progress.  Gave them another chance to redeem themselves when I went with my friend for her free birthday burger. And yes they screwd up again!

Hillary C.,"Santa Barbara, CA",283,95,63,3.0,7/13/2016,"I'm giving 3 stars because  the food was pretty good, but the service was not. I came when they first opened and the service was slow, but I expected it because they were brand new. I was disappointed on how long it took even though they've been open for a few months, and the restaurant was half empty. I went with a party of 8 so we expected service to be slow, but not this slow. It took about 20 minutes to get seated which wasn't too bad on a Wednesday night. We ordered and it took an hour from when we ordered to get our food and our waitress never came to check on us to see if we needed a refill on water or any of our other drinks. We actually had to use the nifty little computer/tablet device to call our waitress over and ask where our food was. The table behind us ordered, got their food, and left way before we even got our food.  I ordered the simply chicken burger which was really well cooked and the bottomless sweet potato fries. They were pretty good.  I don't think I'll be returning unless I really have to for a birthday or something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton
Tom T.,"Stockton, CA",0,5,,1.0,12/29/2017,"I like Red Robin because of the diverse menu and good food, you can even find some healthy options if that's what you're looking for.  I've always had very good experience at the Elk Grove location, but Stockton was the exact opposite.  8pm on a Thursday I asked for a table and was told to sit in the bar.  Took a while but eventually someone brought a menu and and water and said the bartender would be my server.  I waited another 20 minutes and then left.  No staff at the bar or the reception desk to tell them why I was leaving (no service).  Lots of other places I can go to spend my money.  Not sure who the manager is here, but it's time for someone new who knows what they are doing, hires competent, motivated staff and trains them well and monitors the operation. It's not rocket science, but they do need to show up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton
Elisha T.,"San Jose, CA",69,29,28,4.0,2/2/2017,"Red Robin's! ...yummmm! A friend and I decided to grab some dinner before he left back to his college-town, and we had a good experience with our meal. It was like a Thursday or Friday night, and there was a very short wait time.  Maybe around 10-15 minutes at most.  One thing I love about this Red Robin's location more than all the others is that there's so many chalkboards to make the time go by a little faster.  I drew a picture of Bob Belcher from Bob's Burgers on their largest chalkboard to kill time.  We got called shortly after I finished writing up Bob's ""Burger of the Day"": Kelp Me If You Can: Comes with Kelp. Haha.  Our waitress was nice, and was super quick in refilling out drinks and checking up on us.  She even gave a good recommendation as my friend couldn't decide between which shake to have with his dinner.  He order some burger that I forget, since I didn't have any, and I ordered a BLTA on croissant with some chicken tortilla soup on the side.  That's my usual Red Robin's order, at least.  While we waited for our food, another server offered us fries while we waited.  Once our food arrived, we got to enjoy a couple rounds of bottomless sweet potato fries.  The only thing that left me a little disappointed with the meal was that there was so little avocado on my sandwich, I didn't even notice it when I received my order or took my first bite.  They were definitely skimping on that.  Everything else, however, was great as always.  Maybe it's because this location is newer, but I haven't had any issues in coming here as opposed to some other locations.   Overall Results: 4/5 stars. Don't skimp on a girl's avocado!  Also we felt rushed to pay and leave a tip for our server because her shift ended while we had just received our food.  She took off with her cash tip from us while we were still eating dinner.  Everything besides that was a good dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton?start=20
Nora P.,"Las Vegas, NV",12,6,30,1.0,11/4/2017,"We sat in the Bar area, we weren't greeted at first. I asked the girl in the bar if we can sit anywhere and she said yes. So my niece and I sat down and waited and see if someone will come to our table to serve us. No one came for about 15 minutes. My niece got up and got someone to help us with our order. A gentleman came and took our drink order. It took awhile to get our ice tea and the strawberry lemonade. So I got up and told someone at the bar if we're getting serve if not we're going to leave and I asked for a manager, sure enough I was speaking to a manager and she told me that they're very busy and will take our order shortly. We came in at 12:45 and still waiting for our food at 1:40. Bad service and will not comeback at this particular location.

Leon B.,"Stockton, CA",73,31,11,2.0,5/29/2017,"Let me start by stating -- I am a huge fan of Red Robin.  I'm new to the Stockton area, and I've always enjoyed going to the Red Robins at both the Foster City and Brentwood locations.  I'm accustomed to the welcoming atmosphere, the high energy, and a great guest experience.   I was at this location on Sunday, May 29th at approximately 6:30pm.  First of all, the hostess didn't acknowledge us.  And when she finally did come to the podium, she didn't even say hello.  She wasn't very welcoming, she didn't smile, extremely low energy, and I got the impression she didn't want to be there, which made me feel bad for going in.  Worst part is -- she didn't even do her hair.  She literally looked like she jumped out of bed and put her hair up in a very big messy bun.  If you're going to work the front of any restaurant, you should look presentable.  The hostess sets the tone for your customers. Our table service was amazing and so was our food, which was this restaurant's only saving grace.  Please, Red Robin, get some better hostesses -- at least some that want to be there.  I am very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton?start=20
Alden C.,"Los Angeles, CA",477,129,453,3.0,5/16/2016,"In a city like Stockton, it's a surprise there wasn't a Red Robin earlier. It recently opened so my party of 8 came to try out their burgers and unlimited fries. The wait was about 45 minutes on Thursday night. They have the system where they text you when your table is ready. To my surprise, they had our table ready in a mere 13 minutes!  When we got seated, our server Natasha was very accommodating and friendly. Although she had a busy section to maintain, she was nothing less than spectacular as our waitress. She kept checking up on our table and gave us refills upon refills of fries. I had the Red Tavern Double with regular fries. The burger patty itself looks dry and burnt but the taste was fine. It was not as dry as it looked which was a relief. The fries were nothing special, they were your standard steak fries and there was no crisp to them. My girlfriend ordered the sweet potato fries with her burger and those were great at an extra cost of $1.49.  Overall, I enjoyed this establishment but the food is mediocre. The unlimited fries are a plus if you really enjoy fries. The prices are a little on the higher side, especially for drinks.

Sadly the food quality was below average. The portions were small and the burger itself tasted like it was a frozen microwave patty. Paying $15 per burger at a so called gourmet burger restaurant I expected more.

We came in during the first week of opening during Sunday lunch hour so we had no choice but to deal with an hour wait. Employees handed out menus during the wait and also checked on us  frequently despite the long wait. Very hospitable of them.  As soon as we were seated I ordered a Raspberry Limeade to drink. A+ presentation and it was refreshing considering the hot day. For my meal, I ordered a Southern Charm Burger, no pink, with avocado on top. I chose to stick with the bottomless steak fries as my side.  Man oh man, not sure if I was super hungry but the Southern Charm Burger I ordered was one of the BEST burgers I've ever had in my LIFE. Delicious, the beef was cooked medium well just like I asked, and the flavors were bangin'.  Service was just a tad bit slow with the steak fries refills and all however it is in fact the first week of opening AND it was a full house! Our waitress was Robin and she was very patient and accommodating.  Considering that I signed myself up for the rewards program, I'm looking forward to my free birthday burger next month.

Keilani R.,"Stockton, CA",147,83,32,2.0,8/24/2016,"Went in around 6pm with 4 adults & 3 babies. 2 babies in a high chair & 1 in a sling. The hostess set that up right away & sat us within minutes. There was no wait at that time. Our server Jaylin came & out, greeted us & continued to take our order. We were ready to order everything so in order for us to get our drinks fast, she ordered for us on the little tablets on the tablet. Smart idea! So while the bartender was getting started on our drinks, she was still at our table, taking our dinner order. Our server was attentive but she didn't really know her bar menu. After getting our husbands excited by telling them it was happy hour, she then came back & said ""sorry it's not happy hour anymore."" She couldn't even tell us what was on the happy hour menu (for our future preference.) As a server, you really need to know both menus on the top of your head!  My son didn't get his fries with his meal. My friend ordered a Long Island & it took about 20 minutes for her to get it. All because they already ran out of glasses. The server said she had to ""go on a mission"" to find a glass & wash it for her long island.  The food was okay. Pretty pricey though.  Not sure if I'd come back on my own. Maybe only if it was someone's birthday dinner there. You can get the same quality food & drinks elsewhere for a cheaper price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton?start=20

It must be because its in Stockton because I've never been in a Red Robin in Elk Grove or Manteca that looked like this!   This place will go out of business soon.

Nice. Kudos. We checked in with the hostess and she informed us the wait would be 40-50 minutes. People were swarmed in the small wait area as well as sitting outside on the walkway... Ew. My stepmom saw three whole tables in the bar area available and decided to ask if we could sit there and the girl just shrugged her shoulders and said ""sure"". Uh, okay. So you were just going to allow us to sit and wait like dummies? Right, okay. Our server was a mess, when my stepmom asked about the fish and chips he straight up told her ""it's not restaurant style it's fast food style, frozen and fried to order, nothing special."" Uh, another okay. We asked about a few items on the menu and he had zero knowledge. He asked way too many times if we were okay yet allowed our drinks to sit at the bar for almost 10 minutes. It wasn't until Nelson, another server who was wonderful, stepped up to the plate and brought them to us and eventually brought us out our food while our actual unnamed server walked around. The entire time during dinner there were 4 empty tables just sitting there as well as plenty tables outside but we could see so many people still waiting. Why wasn't the hostess offering those customers these tables!?!? All around, nothing spectacular. I'd rather spend a few dollars more and go to market tavern for their burger.

Food was barely edible, because it's cold. Their bar mac n cheese tastes like it's made from powder. Their burger was cold and undercooked.

What's nice is that they take down your number and text you when your table's ready. To kill time, we just shopped at the mall, which is walking distance from the restaurant. The onion rings are boooomb. I asked to get them extra crispy, and extra crispy they were. I didn't have a great experience w my burger though. After a hiccup with my burnt burger order (I do not recommend getting the Turbo-Q Tavern for $7.99), the waitress Natasha was very accommodating & understanding, which I appreciated. She let me switch my order and my new burger was much juicier. All burgers come with bottomless fries. I ordered the sweet potato fries ($1.49 extra) and these were super good! My friends stuck with the normal steak cut fries which were extra fat and tasty w the special seasoning salt. We also got one order of garlic fries ($1 extra), but these weren't really worth it in my opinion. I recommend asking for another round of fries the moment your first set comes out, because they take foooorever to bring out another plate. Overall, Red Robin was decent, considering it's only been open for a few days. Hopefully their service improves as time goes on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton?start=40

But since there weren't very many customers inside, I can understand it from a $ and cents standpoint. I walked right to the bar and sat down. The bartender immediately asked what I wanted to drink. I ordered up a beer and the Big Pig Out with a salad instead of the bottomless fried. My burger was actually really tasty! When you substitute the salad instead of fries...it too is bottomless...so order seconds or thirds if you got room for it. My suggestion; if you sub in a salad ask for it to be served right away as you wait for you burger to be cooked and served. Plenty of parking since this restaurant is in the corner of the mall. Speaking with bartender, they have a weekday happy hour (3-6). I mentioned that there were a couple nearby places that had late night happy hours...and that the previous restaurant here (Elephant Bar) also had one and that the place was usually pretty full during such time (as opposed to its current empty state).

We stand around for almost five minutes before I am about to just say ""lets go"" when he finally shows up.  The place was almost empty, except for a large table of guests having a birthday party (all of whom already have their food) and three or four other occupied tables through out the entire  place. Just about everyone had their food already and the people sitting by us had already paid and were about to leave. Our waitress was just blah. She took our drink orders, came back about ten minutes later with them, and then asked if we were ready. So we order. I get the Wedgie Burger with a side salad & boyfriend gets the pepper burger with fries. Fast forward forty five minutes and still no food. The place is almost completely empty. Finally the waitress comes out with our food almost fifty five minutes later and apologizes because their chefs have had a bad day. I was so hungry, so I accepted the apology and she was on her way. Well, they forgot the bacon and tomato on my burger and the lettuce wasn't even wrapped around it. I literally had to eat it with a fork, and even had to force myself to do that. The only thing you could taste on the burger was salt, salt, and more salt, along with the Red Robin seasoning. I get to my side salad and the lettuce is warm... like it had been sitting under a heat lamp or something. Not just a little warm, but to the point where it was all wilted up. I was so disappointed. We had requested a couple of extra napkins when our food was brought out, and it took the waitress ten minutes to even bring them to us, and when she finally did my boyfriend let her know that my entire burger was messed up and missing items. She did say sorry, and that she could bring me out sides of the items missing, but at this point I was already almost done (and if it takes ten minutes for napkins, I can't imagine how long it would be for more food) so I just shook my head and said no. That was the only time during our entire meal we saw her by the way. Not once did she come back and ask us if we needed refills on drinks or if we wanted more fries. Nothing. And nobody else was sitting in our section, so she either just didn't care or forgot about us. My boyfriend paid and as we were leaving our waitress finally walked by us and said ""sorry"" one more time, but that was it. I can see why the place wasn't busy. Customer service is incredibly crappy here and the atmosphere is so dark and blah inside. I wish we would have made the drive to Manteca instead.

Julia W.,"Stockton, CA",44,171,,1.0,9/26/2016,"I was excited that Stockton was getting a Red Robin restaurant because I've heard the food was good. While the food is quite tasty, the customer service is awful. I dined here maybe six times and only twice did I receive decent service from the servers. Casey and Felisha are amazing servers -- both pleasant and attentive to your needs. Unfortunately it takes forever to receive your meal. The last few times, we've gotten free baskets of fries because of the awful wait time for our meals.  I don't understand what the deal is at that restaurant. Lack of training perhaps? On one visit, I ordered the mac and cheese and was served the burger with the mac and cheese. When I pointed out to the server that I didn't order this, that I ordered the mac and cheese. He said that mac and cheese is only on the kid's menu and no where else. Okay..? Another visit happened forty minutes after they opened. The server took our drinks and orders, then delivered our beverages and that was the last that we saw of her. Another server delivered our meal then we had to ask another server for to-go containers. We paid our bill and left. My last visit to Red Robin included my parents, husband and one year old son. We arrived at 6:00 and left at 7:30. Besides us, six other tables hadn't received their meals yet and we all received free baskets of french fries while we waited for our food. When we finally got our meals, we didn't have silverware so our server went to get us some. She returned with some, saying she had to wash them in the back which I thought was odd. After I finished my food, I strolled my anxious son outside and waited for my family to receive to-go containers. After a good ten minutes, they appeared outside saying that our server was in the back washing dishes because the dishwasher had quit. Very rarely do I see managers when I eat here.

The service is consistently bad and slow. The wait staff all seem like this is their first time serving, and have had 0 training. The atmosphere always feels chaotic and unorganized. The restaurant itself each visit has been in shambles, tables and chairs all out of place, dirty tables left and right, food and garbage on the floor, and the bathrooms a hot mess.

Ian C.,"Oakland, CA",30,58,48,2.0,2/13/2017,"This is the 2nd attempt Red Robin is in Stockton, The first time was on West Lane in 1990s, in the same plaza as China Palace, it was actually good back then just bad location. This time they took up where the Lyon's and Elephant bar was. The location is much better but after going there twice on a Sunday, I can only give them 2 stars, The overall service is so slow, you'll be asking WTH. I'm handicap and I had to remain standing with my 2 canes for over 10 mins to draw attention to host/waiter to sit me down. The only fast portion of my entire evening was the menu was brought to us after about 5 mins we sat down and not along the same time we were brought to the table I need to add there were waiter, waitress that walk past and saw us waiting but no one gave us any kind of attention or acknowledgement that someone will be right with you- Big Strike 1  We sat down, later got our menus, we were pretty quick with deciding on our drinks. Drinks were slow and we ordered appetizers along with it. We also quickly ordered our burgers knowing how extremely SLOW this place is. The appertizers came once hell frozen over and decided to show up. then took another eclipse for our actual burgers to show up, The food was average, my son's kid burger was dried as mojave dessert and I ordered sweet potato fries with my order but came with regular fries instead, I had to wait and let the waiter know kitchen mess up  After waiting another 40mins or so, I had to ask the waiter, are they still peeling the sweet potato or did they ran out and had to go food4less to get some or something. I had to ask can you please bring me a double order so I won't have to wait another 40 mins for another round of fries. First batch showed up after 15 mins looking like all burnt, at least 2nd batch looks normal. It took so long for the fries to show up, it's closing time !!We had to pack our food to go and leave.  Overall this is one of the worst Red Robin we've been. We goto the one in Pleasanton and Foster City quite often but those 2 locations had 1000x times better service and speed and food. I want to know what the heck does the kitchen and wait staff ate before their shifts ?  It's like they each ate a tub full of pig lard and decide to work at snail speed. Food took forever to come out and they look and taste like crap. There are plenty of wait staff there all suppose to look busy doing side jobs but I can clearly tell they are milking the clock.

Mila S.,"Stockton, CA",54,17,8,1.0,9/25/2016,Came here for my grandson birthday and received terrible service!  Waitress took other customers orders before ours and we were there first.  Then the waitress was told twice about my grandson birthday and they did nothing.  She didn't even bother coming by checking on us or giving us more water.  She didn't even give us a check but I saw others with their check.  We checked on the machine on the table and saw the bill and paid it on there.  Bottomless fries???? That was a total joke!  During our stay we witnessed 3 other parties have there birthdays celebrated yet my grandson never got his.... What a bad experience for a birthday!   25 Sep 2016 Heard back from Jen K from customer service to say someone will contact me within 2-3 day and STILL haven't heard from them!  I guess it's just not this location that has bad customer service the overall company!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton?start=60

Charlotte W.,"Modesto, CA",0,8,1,1.0,4/9/2017,"Visited on 04/08/2017 roughly around 6ish... was there for about an hour and a half.  The service was okay, our waiter wasn't very attentive, and we had to ask multiple other waiters for things like ... napkins, flatware, and refills on our ""bottomless"" fries.  Food was good. Typically this review would be about a 3 star. The reasoning behind the one star is that after paying and rightfully not tipping our waiter for his crappy service, did I notice that an extra 3 dollar and some change, charge (what would have been a 15% tip) was taken out on my card. Now my receipt says the correct amount I paid. My account however posted the charge for more that what was on my receipt. It is highly unappreciated that your restaurant or employees thought it could take money from my account without my consent. I don't care if it was $3 or $38 it's not right, and is considered fraud.

Shonda T.,"Stockton, CA",19,9,3,1.0,6/6/2016,"My second visit to this place on June 5th was worst than my first and resulted in no charge to my entire party of seven. Mind you, we did not ask that they not charge us. The manager, who was going to come to our table after I had to return my burger due to it being undercooked, simply made the call to do this without talking to us. I would have preferred that he or she come to the table to discuss the problems we were having. The problems we experienced were:  1) The air conditioner was going full blast, it was like dining in their freezer. 2) There was trash all over the floor which seemed to have been there for quite a while.  3) The hostess spoke to my mother with an annoyed tone when she inquired about our seating.  4) We were a party of seven and received appetizer plates and silverware for four.  5) Our refills, which were needed because our meal took a long time to come, required that we flag down our server.  6) We received a couple of orders of fries before our order came, which we didn't ask for and are still puzzled about. It could have been to make up for the amount of time we waited for our orders. I don't think our server communicated anything about them before placing them on our table.  7) My burger was undercooked, and when recooked, arrived after everyone else had finished their food so I had to ask for it to be packaged to go.  8) The waitress said the manager was going to come over to talk to us and that he or she was paying for my meal. He or she never showed.  9) When we went to pay via the kiosk at the table my meal was still on there. After letting the waitress know this, she went to clear it up and came back a few minutes later and said everyone's meal was free.  I know none of this happened intentionally. Nobody woke up and said they were going to make our dining experience horrible. But, there are some issues that some customer service training could easily fix. I would like to recommend the management of this restaurant read or reread if they have read it previously, the book Disney U: How Disney University Develops the World's Most Engaged, Loyal, and Customer-Centric Employees by Doug Lipp. It is a great book that I think many organizations could benefit from. As I mentioned earlier, the floor was littered with trash, many of the servers, though nice people, were not attentive to the things that were going on around them. Regardless of assigned tables or responsibilities they have to appear to be aware that every customer is their customer. That book shows how management can achieve that. There was one small example that someone might get it. The gentleman server who came by to deliver my recooked burger, looked over at the table across from us and said ""don't tell me you are still waiting on your sweet potato fries?"" to which they gave an exasperated reply in the affirmative. He seemed to be the one with the most hustle and awareness to even ask them that. He hurried away to get their item which did show up a moment later.  Lastly, I want to recommend that they have regular salt and pepper shakers for elderly customers who may have trouble using the grinding shakers. Our server was kind enough to grind some salt into a small container for my mom. My server was also kind enough to make my raspberry iced tea more to my liking with a few more pumps of the raspberry flavoring. So there were instances of good showmanship in the customer service area but much work needs to be done. I hope this review is helpful for them. It's good to have Red Robin back in Stockton, but if improvement doesn't happen I will take my burger cravings to the one in Manteca.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton?start=80

Tiffany C.,"Newport Beach, CA",7,22,4,3.0,7/15/2016,"This was my second time coming to Red Robin in Stockton. I went during their first week of opening and it was pretty chaotic. So many people were inside and our waitress was not educated about the menu. She couldn't tell us what beers were on tap and what were in the burgers we were asking questions about. I gave her the benefit of the doubt because it can be stressful with a new job and new environment.  So I came in again with a large group this time. It was Wednesday night and the wait wasn't too long. The restaurant was about half full too, so I figured we would get our food pretty quick. Well after ordering, half an hour goes by, forty minutes go by, and we were all wondering what was going on so we had to call our waitress using the electronic devices that are on the table because she seemed to have gone missing during that hour of waiting. Finally our food came out and she was switching up our orders so after she left we were passing around our plates to their rightful owners.  I give this place three stars because they make a pretty good turkey burger and the fact that they offer sweet potato fries, which I'm a sucker for. They're not spectacular by any means, but they do the job.  I think this place bit off more they can chew with the size of the restaurant and the staff. Both times we received pretty poor service and I am not going to be coming back here unless forced to for a social gathering, where I'll bite my tongue and pray for decent service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton?start=80
Tom A.,"Stockton, CA",0,7,1,1.0,5/27/2016,The much anticipated opening of Red Robin in Stockton has left me almost speechless. The circular bar is a great left over from the previous occupant but that is where it ends. The remodeled Resturant is well lit and the staff in general appear to be cheerful. The wait times are incredibly long once you've place your order.... We waited 39 minutes for my food in all that time nobody managed to get us our silverware or napkins set up?? I forgot to mention we ate at the bar and sat next to a servers station and I was appalled at what I witnessed..fruit for drinks being dropped on filthy server trays and then placed in patrons cocktails!!!  Servers rubbing their hair scratching there armpits and then handling the same prepared fruit with out a set of tongs or toothpick I can't imagine this is allowed to go on management or the health department??? I would never order a mixed drink from a server after what I witnessed. The TV's at the bar are positioned in such a high location that the glare from can lighting blinds you as you try to watch???  Oh don't let me forget if you order a draft beer it's likely it will poured into a warm Pilsner glass ( kinda defeats the purpose) In my humble opinion. Somebody needs to get this place straighten out and soon!! Cleanup and retrain server at the bar station reposition the TV's to a lower much lower sight line. Personally after what I witnessed at the servers station I won't be back.

LaShaye S.,"Stockton, CA",58,47,62,2.0,12/2/2016,"My husband and I have been coming here since it opened this year. In the beginning this place was awesome. Great, and fast service, fresh food, stirng alcoholic drinks. Well in the last few months the service has slowly wained. There is barely anyone to greet you when you walk in the door, and if there is the person usually seems over worked since they are bussing tables as well ( from what I've seen lately). Yesterday when we went we the place was fairly empty, but we were a party of three. Three older people who clearly walked in after us got seated first. OK no biggie... We aren't cry baby's. But when we sat down we literally were at the table for about 15 minutes before anyone even tossed a look, or a smile our way. There was a waitress bussing the table behind us, and she saw that no one was helping us but still went about her way serving that table. After 20 minutes if sitting there she finally acknowledges us, and says that our waitress didn't know that our table was hers to work, so she will instead be taking our order. (We were playing with our baby to pass the time, and I really wanted some onion rings which is the only reason we didn't leave). After she took our order the food came pretty quickly. It was good, and hot so I can't complain about that. I did order a drink... I forgot the name if it. I usually order the zombie, and this drink was similar to it. The drinks are usually good, and stiff but this drink was just juice. I literally didn't taste a drop of alcohol. We are usually tipsy after a drink here, but I didn't even get a warm fuzzy feeling. I was very disappointed with the service yesterday, and have been our past few visits. She only came back to give us the check, and never asked to refill our drinks nor if we wanted condiment's etc. I usually give a place several chances before I write a bad review becasue some incidents are isolated. Red robin seems to now have workers that are overworked, and the place seems understaffed. The waiters aren't as attentive as they once were, and overall its become a sub par place to eat.

Jen L.,"Stockton, CA",0,17,5,3.0,5/17/2016,"Was there for dinner last night while the Warriors game was on so that might be why they were so packed but it still shouldn't account for their unpreparedness. They need to work on picking up the pace.  Wait time: 1 star So, we got there around 7:15pm and they told us it'll be about a 35 minute wait. We got our text saying they were ready after 30 minutes so we go in hoping to get out seats but they told us it'll be like 5 minutes cause they need to clean our table. They come back saying it might take ten to fifteen minutes for our table. To be polite, I simply said, ""OK, no problem."" We finally got seated, which of course, was a table that didn't even had customers so obviously, there was no table to clean. Our waitress was sweet and came really quick to serve and take our orders.  This is where we got angry because it took about forty minutes for our orders to come out! It's now 9:30pm when we finally got our food. We had four orders only! It should not take that long for our orders to come out! By now the kids and I were extremely hungry, irritable, and angry waiting for our food. The waitress was nice to constantly come and apologize for the wait and check up on us.  Service: (waitress - 4 star) Food: 3 star We ordered a Royal Red Robin, Fish n' Chips, Mac n' Cheese, and a simple burger. Food was mediocre, nothing really stand out and we weren't expecting it to.  I know this place is new, but if one game night kept them backed up with the excuses of them being new, this might drive people to go somewhere else.

Dave N.,"Woodbridge, CA",14,66,398,2.0,12/28/2016,"Like every newer place that opens in Stockton, you have to be willing to wait for a long time to try this place out or wait a couple months for the crowds to die down to get in and out of here quickly. I found myself going with the second option. Went in here after a couple months of it being open and after checking out the rating of this place the locals were giving it, I didn't have high expectations walking in. The reviews are pretty accurate of my experience in a lot of ways.  The couple times I've came in I have eaten at the bar. It seems like one of the bigger waiting periods after factoring out wanting to eat in the dining area is the wait for food. First time I came in they did alright, but the second time I came in it was very chaotic. The bar area seemed very understaffed. I get it's a week day, but it seemed like everyone was eating at the bar that day and it literally took about 15 minutes for a friend and I to put in an order. This was 15 minutes after being told, 'give me just 1 minute and I'll be back to take your order' by the bar tender.  What made it worse is my food came out with the wrong side and when I asked for the correct side, I ended up checking my bill and saw she charged me for an extra side. Side dishes are bottomless here for the most part from what I understand. Instead of acknowledging that she put the order in wrong from the get go, I ate the small charge for a side. I find that not only is the bar hostess understaffed, but has an issue acknowledging her short comings all around. I tried to help her speed up the check out process because she was too busy attending to other guests by requesting she put our orders on the Ziosk. I have never been refused Ziosk payments from any of the restaurants I've been to that utilize these machines (Applebees, chilis, etc), but you guessed it, she refused and let me know that she could check me out by taking my card.  Food is mediocre and I found the service to be crap all around. If I've said it once, I've said it dozens of times. There's just too many burger joints in this town that have better food and service all around to where this place just can't compete.  This place just doesn't compare to the Manteca location at all. Shorting the staff and having the customers watch them struggle but maintaining an attitude of, 'I'm doing my job the best I can', out of pride isn't going to work. The place this location is heading isn't far off from where the other restaurants that used to have their location are at today. Wouldn't be surprised if this location is closed down the next time I decide to give them a chance. I'd rather drive 20-30 minutes out to see a Red Robin do it properly in the next town than to entertain dining here. The 2 out of 5 is for the beautiful remodeling they've done here on the inside and the decent food. All I can do is entertain if you're in the mood for a burger, give another place in town a shot.

Yes my tips reflected that at first.  Now? They've worked out all the kinks.  The burgers were always delicious.  Last time we went there they had a guy pushing around a cart full of fresh fries and left them at every table.  He came around about every 10 or 15 minutes and dropped off as many baskets as your table wanted. There were some salads at my table and those were refilled promptly as well.   Sure, the waits can still be long to get seated but once you're in its all good! The last few times we went there they stated there'd be a 45 minute wait and we were seated in less than 20.

I turned on the call server flasher on my table and was walked by 3 or 4 times and ignored. Pretty ticked off. This happened last time I came too. I ordered a cup of soup and it was never brought out. By the time I received it all my companions were finished eating.

People arrived after us who were seated nearby, they were served before us! Finally got my burger, and looked down at the frys-12 total. Had to count them because I couldn't believe it. Got the server to ask for more. By the time they finally came I was done with my burger. This time the server gave me 8 frys. I know it's petty to count your frys, but I couldn't believe how tight they are with fry refills. It's almost false advertising. When we got the ticket it was $30 bucks for 3 burgers.  I suppose it's a good place to eat if you've get several hours to burn and wait for frys. It's just a waiting game for the bottomless frys.

Andie G.,"Stockton, CA",72,41,,5.0,8/2/2016,"I know, based on the other reviews here that this review seems already biased, but this is totally my honest experience. (and if you read my other reviews, you'll see that if I have a bad experience, I have no qualms writing about it.) I've been to other RR restaurants in other towns and always liked it. I was so excited to see we were getting one here in Stockton. A coworker of mine told me that customer service here was lousy and that the food was subpar, BUT that he went opening week, so to keep that in mind.  So yesterday, I was craving a Teryaki Chicken Burger and talked my husband into taking me to RR. We walked in, were seated within 4 minutes (the restaurant was busy but not slammed). We were served by Peter, who took all our gentle ribbing and jokes in stride. He was attentive and fun and explained everything we asked him to. Our food was AMAZING.. (loved my ceasar salad and my Chicken Burger while hubs could barely finish his BBQ Bacon Burger) Drinks and bottomless fries were flowing and we were in and out in less than an hour.  I don't know if we just caught a good time between rushes, but we had a fantastic experience and WILL absolutely return!!

Irene D.,"Stockton, CA",0,20,38,3.0,9/6/2016,"Red Robbin is great but Stockton's Red Robbin is not quite where it should be. It has been a few months since it first open and yet the staff still seems a bit lost. We never go for the first month of a restaurant opening just so it gives them enough time to get things in order and I don't have to write a bad review. Unfortunately I still have to write one even though months have already passed since they first opened. I have enjoyed my experiences and food at the Red Robbin in Manteca so I had expectations.  The food still has a way to go before it reaches the standards of other Red Robbins but it's definitely on its way. I think the staff need better training and should be more knowledgeable of the menu options, happy hour, etc. During our visit, which was about 1 month ago there was quite a wait for the server to come around and take the drink order, once taken it took another while longer to get the drinks to our table. We walked over to the bar and got the drinks ourselves. When we finally saw our server to take our food order there was another delay in getting our food finally to our table. The whole experience took about 1 hour and half from start to finish, we should have been done a lot sooner, we were a party of five 3 kids 2 adults.

Steve N.,"Lodi, CA",36,7,3,2.0,8/1/2017,"*preface - I'm a huge RR fan and the Redding and Citrus Heights locations makes this place look even worse than it is.. Stocktons RR has incredible issues. We entered on Sunday evening and the place had 5 tables, that includes the 3 pairs at the bar! 3 servers a runner a bar tender person and a manager, with whom I would have a chat... We sat at the bar, pair #4, upon sitting the bar person felt the need to drop the hint that ""she was quit busy and that it would be a moment before she could get to us"".. Personally I hate that line, take a drink order and get done what you need, then deliver drinks and get food order, not rocket science just organize your mind. She would not return for several minutes, more than 5 but less than 10, with menu's and still no drink order, again she now has 4 pairs she's serving and making 2 milkshakes for the other 2 tables in the main dinning area. This obnoxious routine continued and worsened when she informed a trio that they would have to wait as she had 4 tables ahead of them, they sat at the bar anyway and had the same experience we did. Bar person was wasting time walking the restaurant and touching and texting on her cell phone while behind the bar. This story has been our pattern at this location for about 7 months, we've been here to dine about 9 times now so I've really given this location a chance. When our food arrived we immediately asked for more fries because this location does NOT like to ask nor provide bottomless anything even beverages are hard to get refilled. Fries did not show up before our meal was done, my wife and I are not fast eaters. Manager passed by to see about the ice cream machine and I asked him for more coke and why it was so slow in there and why his staff seemed to be struggling with the super low volume..? no reply, just evil glare and my coke.

Appetizers look bigger on the menu (as usual) but they were pretty good and came out quickly. I wouldn't recommend the pretzel bites; the taste just wasn't right and the cheese to dip them in didn't taste good either.  The NachOMG was heaping and pretty delicious.

I ordered the southern burger and the carmelized onions and chedder cheese were almost nonexistent,  bacon was thin and hard and there was only a dab of bbq sauce. My husband enjoyed his burger, something with an over easy egg,  but he also said his bacon was thin and there was very little of it. Ambience wasn't as expected, can't really put my finger on it.  No warmth with the decor, sorta cafeteria feel.  Our utensils and our platters looked dirty.  They were promptly replaced, but still were suspect.   However, service was absolutely excellent!!  The waitress we encountered in the bar area was great and so was our waitress in the dining room area.

Kinda obvious if its  burger and fries joint. Every time we ask for a serving for fries. We had to wait on the cooking staff .

We started trying to get a table. No one would help us. We finally had to go up and ask other employees for a table (the original 3 walked off without saying a word). It was empty by the way. There was 1 person sitting at the bar, and maybe 4 tables in the place had people at them. We ordered an appetizer and drinks. It took about 10 mins to get my beer, the appetizer we got was wrong, they never gave us silverware or napkins. I went to go ask for ranch, napkins, forks, etc. the guy I asked said sure. Then never did it. I finally got up went to the bar and when he saw me again he asked someone else to go grab it. By then we'd probably had been there about a half hour.

It was an early Monday afternoon around 2:30 pm. Business seemed to be pretty slow and there was a good amount of waiters working that day. The service I received would have been totally understandable if it had been a busy night and they were short on staff. However, this was not the case.  Our waiter was a young guy, Giovanni, I believe. I've seen him around, a great photographer but a mediocre at best waiter. It took him forever to get our drinks (water) and it took him even longer to get  us lemon even though we clearly asked for it from the start. The same happened with the rest of our food. At least they were nice enough to give us a drink on the house to make up for our slow service.

Anthony M.,"Stockton, CA",4,34,2,1.0,9/5/2016,"Talk about all around horrible service.  I met up with a friend of mines to grab a bite to eat and we chose this place.  Upon entering we notice hardly anyone is in the restaurant as we walk in there was no one at the front counter so we waited a few minutes and as time pass by, the line at the front door is starting to form.  We got tired of waiting and chose to walk into the bar and eat there.     We sit down and now we are waiting at the bar tables for one of the three waiters/waitress to come take our order.  After several times of passing us up we had to flag one down just to give us menu.  After our menu came out to us we took a few minutes and were ready to order. Granted we got a cute waiter that flirts, that wasn't enough to quell our appetite.     So we flag her again and she takes our order.  We ask for our drinks and I get an Irish mule and my friend just orders a Diet Coke.  She puts that order in and probably around five mins pass my friend gets his soda.  A few mins after that I get my drink.  Now we took the opportunity to start placing our orders while she brought my drink.  We order some chips and salsa for appetizer I get fish and chips and my friend gets a burger with onion rings.  She takes the order and says ok I'll have the chips out in a few mins.  That's when we assumed ball started to roll in our favor, well we were wrong it rolled the other way and made full circle around the mall before we got anymore attention.  She came by because I push my drink close to the edge to give a subtle hint that I wanted another glass, she looks over to my friend and also ask if he wanted a refill it was quite obvious from the glass with ice and him chewing the ice cubes. She puts in another order for my drink.  I can see the bartender from where we are sitting and I notice she isn't doing much of anything other then talk to the patron sitting in front of her.  I see she hasn't attempt to look at anything  for quite some time.  Now we are also wondering what about our appetizer  and we look over and now we see only one waiter at the bar and she is talking to a group that came in shortly after us and giving them their appetizers.  So we flag her down and ask what happen to our appetizers.  And she says idk let me check on it, she comes back out and says another person will come out with it.  I decided to ask what about my drink so she had to ask the bartender and the bartender tells me that it will be out shortly.     About 30+ mins now our appetizer is coming out to us but it also looks like our main meal came out with it too.  My friend decided to scrap that idea of keeping the appetizer because we we have our meal now, which makes sense.  So she is comes by and drops off my long awaited drink and my friend ask to remove the appetizer because we already have our meal, she comply and takes it off the order.  I don't know what boat my friend was on but he decides he wants one of the specialty sauce .  She says ok it's extra my friend is like ok.  So I finish up my fish and chips and he finish up his burger and was down to two onion rings before realizing he ordered the sauce which also came about that time.     Now I think we time lapse for about an hour of sit wait and eat.  We got tired of waiting for the waiter so we used the machine and paid for it ourselves before leaving.  Now my friend wasn't happy and decided not to tip at all.  I still tip just not as big as I would have.   Of the three red robins(Pleasanton,Tracy and Manteca)I have been to.  The Stockton  one is by far the worse I  hope this location re trains the whole staff.  If not they can easily fold up within the year if they continue down this path.  Avoid this location and go somewhere else.  If not don't say I didn't warn you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton?start=120

Finally got to out table and the kid/host shrugged us off after he seated us. The ""host"" seated 2 more tables on either side of us and took their drink orders. We got nothing until our waitress showed up. Our waitress however was very attentive and stayed on top of the 6 or 7 tables she had seated around us.

My son ordered a burger and fries. When my food finally came, the salad looked liked they pulled it out of a disposal and threw it on the plate. There were about 5 fries on my son's plate. I snuck one and wished I hadn't. It was cold and tasted old. Then there's that tablet they have at the table. I went to turn it around because it was so annoying. It was dirty and sticky.

But thought it was just part of working out the bugs from a new place.  And we were taking hope with seeing a few newer reviews that were decent. There were 5 in our group. Service, waiter Daniel, lagged. Some drinks were quick but it was a wait for bar service (a smoothie & a root beer float). Tho my wife's beer came out quick, too bad it wasn't the kind she ordered.  Our order was taken in a timely manner. When some of it arrived 2 of the 4 that were delivered were wrong. My wife's food was not delivered. The server said he was on the way to grab it. I told my kids to eat and I waited for my wife's chicken wrap to be delivered before I started on my patty melt. 12 minutes later (per my phone from where I sent a text as our food was being delivered) my wife's meal came. My kids were finished eating. To say we weren't happy at that point is an understatement.  But we tried to make the best of it. Unfortunately my patty melt had gone cold and all I could taste was coagulated grease that had cooled.  Our server finally came by after my wife's food was delivered. I explained the issues and he said he would be right back with the manager.  A few minutes later he came back alone. He said the manager was busy but he would remove the kids meals that were screwed up and discount my wife's meal.  When I was paying the bill I saw that only 1 of the messed up kids meals was removed. At that point I just didn't want to be there any more. I paid the bill but could not get out of there fast enough. As we left, it was all I could do not to tell the 3 families that were in the lobby waiting for a table to Run! Don't waste your money!!

He asks her to bring 2 sides of ranch, utensils and water. She brings utensils, 1 ranch. She forgot the second order of ranch and the water. My husband ordered a refill order of the bottomless fries - ha! good luck with that! We were so frustrated, we ended up using the self-check-out and paid our bill. Left a big fat $0 for tip!

Marvin B.,"Stockton, CA",134,30,13,1.0,5/26/2016,"The family and I like Red Robin and we were generally excited that one finally opened in Stockton. Well, the experience on the other hand ended up being a terrible one. It was 8:30pm on Wednesday night and we decided to try it out. My wife called and spoke to someone to ask about the wait and was told about 5 minutes. When we got there 2 minutes later, one of 4 hostesses told us it would now be a 20 minute wait.  So after we spoke up, we got seated a couple minutes ahead of those before us. From here, it snowballed into more pathetic customer service. A server change (Vanessa to Daniel), a manager impersonation, an assurance we were to be taken care of by server 2, late drinks, a 25 minute wait, some lukewarm heavily salted fries, an attempt to ask server to at least get girls food out so they can eat, server saying there are a few orders ahead of us, no sense of urgency, another attempt to speak to a manager (Allison), speaking to the manager, manager being defensive after I call out quality of fries, server listening in, manager attempting to rectify things, manager checking on order, order comes out finally after a 45 minute wait, order of one of kids food wrong, manager attempts to correct, says food is on them, I ask for food to go and ask to obtain manager business card and corporate number, she gives me her card and general manager (who will be in following day), my wife goes to front to grab hostess' names, we leave with food, we go to McDonalds instead and get fast food, starving, my 5 & 6 year old girls crying, I find homeless guy near McDonalds and give him Red Robin's food. What bothers me the most is that my girls had to witness and be part of this horrific experience. They were on the verge of tears due to a combination of things (late dinner, tiredness, etc.) My wife and I weren't even concerned with our dinner at this point and we really just wanted the kids fed after a long day and what we thought would be a nice family dinner. I'm 35 and I have never been a part of a dining experience like that from beginning to end. We're going to address this with corporate later today.

I get to Red Robin, walk in to the bar, and stand there... 5 minutes , 10 minutes go by, finally the little girl comes to me and asks ""can I take you order?"" I just looked at her, looked at the bag, look back at her and ""this is mine right here."" So I'm wondering, should I go off? I know my food is going to be cold, and they are obviously not thinking like that, so I am throughly disappointed and heated at this point, and tempted to just turn and walk out, but I paid and walked out.  I get home and open my food to see NO DAMN STEAK FRIES IN MY BOX!!!!!! RED ROBIN STOCKTON!! You are a sad, sad, SAD store. I've been to many and plenty of Red Rodin stores... And your service is by far the worst!!! Because of that, I will drive across town, and not only get a better burger, but WAY better service....  So here's an update: I went back here again, thinking it was just a bad day, and yes, one person redeemed them. His name is Sean. He was by far the most enjoyable person there!! Great personality, fast, courteous, just a great guy. He took my phone order, made suggestions, and gave me the total for my order before we hung up. I get there, and he's taking care of EVERYONE at the bar, helping customers (both at tables and the bar) and got me in and out of there in about 10 minutes. He is Mr. Red Robin hands down. I'll be back just because of HIS service. His personality is infectious and you will smile while you're there. I give Sean 5 STARS!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton?start=140

Aaron C.,"Lodi, CA",0,24,,3.0,6/23/2016,"I generally like Red Robin, but this one has to get it together soon. First visit there were four of us, and the experience was OK. Food was good, but wait staff seemed unorganized. We attributed this to being a new restaurant and left mostly satisfied, except for a slight lack of attentiveness from the staff. Our waiter was very pleasant when he was there. A month or so later, two of us go back and sit at the bar, which is a nice bar. I'm not one to usually walk out of places but we came close. Bartenders were overwhelmed with drink orders but holding it down the best they could. It took forever to get our orders taken. The worst part was the attitudes of the wait staff, they were just making it worse, and I was surprised how inappropriate they were with each other in front of customers. By the time we left there were at least 5 empty bar area tables that still hadn't been cleared. And our burgers were good but fries were cold. Cold fries are never good.  They might get a third shot from me but it won't be soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton?start=140
Patrick S.,"Stockton, CA",25,3,,1.0,5/24/2016,"Going to the new restaurant in town is always a gamble. Tonight it did not pay off. Long wait to be seated, then almost 20 minutes before a waiter/waitress even approached our table. Lots of help standing around chatting with each other instead of taking care of customers. The bartender actually took our order and our ""waitress"" didn't even stop by the table until after the food had arrived. Had to ask 3 separate people to speak to the manager, who eventually came but gave a somewhat apathetic apology. Aside from the poor service, the food was actually really good. Just don't expect much from the bottomless fries. Getting a second basket will prove to be almost impossible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton?start=140

At one point my drink was taking so long my boyfriend had to go to the bar to get it and came back empty handed. The atmosphere looks run down for it only being less than a year old.

The food at this particular location is mediocre, though you cant beat bottomless fries even if they come out cold sometimes. The server for our first visit was sarah. she was very nice and helpful but the rest of the staff seems to lack experience. Its as if they just hired any, and everyone that applied. If you plan on visiting the bar id recommend sticking to beer, and avoiding the hard stuff. The cocktails are very close to being considered virgin..

Mary B.,"Stockton, CA",1,6,1,4.0,6/16/2016,"To begin with, after reading earlier reviews, I'm glad I waited for the mad rush of a new restaurant to die down before visiting. Ok...I'm just going to 'fess up...I came in to see how many orders of bottomless fries a 53 year old grandma and her college daughter could consume. I'll get to that later because the high light of my visit was my server, Nick! He was attentive, enthusiastic, and very knowledgeable. His recommendations were on point; he even took the time to assist my daughter and me with the automated ordering appetizer device on our table. I am NOT technologically astute, but he was patient and even demonstrated a COUPLE of times until I got the hang of it! Actually, all of the staff were attentive, friendly and eager to check on us throughout our meal. Even Ahmad, the table cleaner, answered my inquiry on whether or not to get the regular or crispy onion rings. (The regular, with the lovely panko, was perfectly crispy for our taste!) The manager, Eric, even stopped by to make sure we were satisfied! So definitely 5 stars for the personnel! The food was quite good. I ordered the BLTA (a for avocado), no mayo, with mustard on the side. The croissant was a nice change from toast. My daughter ordered the whiskey and bbq crispy chicken sandwich. She said it was good, as well. I felt the food was better than most chain restaurant fare. I even think it beat the Creamery! Now, as for the bottomless fries, Nick gave us a basket to share before the food even came out because I was worried about the seasoning being too overwhelming. They were delicious! I mean, who doesn't love steak fries?!?!? They had the perfect proportion of crispy exterior to fluffy potato center!  We didn't even have to order any extra fries! I ended up taking most of my sandwich home! My daughter found room for a salted caramel milkshake. She was glad she did because she said it was the best part of her meal! I'm so glad we have another hangout option where we can have a nice time out when she's in town for a visit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton?start=180
Maria C.,"Stockton, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/28/2016,"Seated quickly. Longer than I would expect time to be greeted by our server. The waitress was friendly.  The server passing out food at the table behind us nearly hit one of my kids on the head several times with her tray which was obviously too heavy and overloaded....why don't they have the stands to place the trays on?  There were 4 of us but we were only given 2 sets of silverware and the 2 additional sets didn't make it to the table until well after our food was served....couldn't seem to get anyone's attention.  The tabletop and everything on it was very greasy.  The floors were absolutely disgusting....covered in what I would assume is the droppings from all day if not yesterday as well.  Out of our 4 meals, the sides were either missing or wrong on 3.  The side salads are literally lettuce with very few slivers of carrots....like the bag salad you purchase at the store.....that's it....nothing more. The salads were wilted.  The lettuce on our burger/sandwiches was wilted as well. The server who brought our food nearly dropped the tray. I had to grab played off of her tray to prevent it from falling. In the process half of my sandwich fell off of the plate onto her tray and fell apart. No apology or even acknowledgment that it happened from the server.  When my sons broccoli finally arrived it was about 5 small pieces and wilted with mostly brown spots on the stalks. I told him not to eat it.  It wasn't until my waitress saw that I was obviously typing out something on the survey on the electronic pay device that I feel we received any proper attention. She came over and asked all the right things at that point, but it was too late.  The only good thing was my sons burger. He loved it aside from the wilted lettuce.  They are good for burgers and fries....otherwise I would not recommend this restaurant. I will not be returning to this location unless it's for a group event that I have no say in.

T F.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,4,,1.0,8/28/2016,"Been trying to get my Dad to go to this Red Robin for months after he had a bad experience here in the past. Finally convinced him to try again, since hubby and I love the one near our home.  Worst service ever!  (Breille) My Dad is a disabled vet, and we are a family in the restaurant business. I always tip 20-25%. Having waited tables, I know it can be tough and a thankless job at times. Our server, Breille, however, did a stellar job of earning the first $00 tip I have given in my life.  We ordered a shake to share, she brought the shake but no straws or spoons. 15 minutes later, someone else finally brought the spoons. People at several tables who were seated after the two of us (both in and out of Breille's station) were waited on, served, finished their meals and left before we even received our (cold) burger, salad, and the onion ring appetizer (all at one) after sitting there for over an hour an 15 minutes. She took another fifteen minutes ( after we finally found her chatting with other wait staff and a man who appeared to be the shift manager) to bring Dad his 'garlic bread"" . The garlic bread was actually completely dried out pieces of toast that were burnt on one side.  All in all, it was over two hours before we were able to get our bill then another 15 minutes to catch Breille's attention to correct a mistake (as she was back chatting with staff again). Dad questioned her about a $1.99 ""Entertainment charge"" added to the bill. It was in error, she said she would take care of it and we mentioned we had been waiting awhile already and would like to get going. She then proceeded to slowly stop by every other table in her section, and chat with the customers at each table ( seriously, every table!) BEFORE taking care of our bill so we could pay and leave. Bad on you, Red Robin in Stockton. Bad wait staff, bad shift management, bad food.  Never again.

Marlis L.,"Lodi, CA",0,5,,2.0,7/4/2017,"We have been to other Red Robins and are members of the loyalty club, so this visit, Sunday, July 1, was disappointing. Upon entering,he hostess asked if bar seating was OK and started to take us there,  We said, ""No."" She gave a sigh and then took us to a room, near the doorway, with other patrons. That room can be used for private parties. Waitress came quickly and took our orders, a burger and a salad. Both were good - no- burger was delicious! Right away she asked how things were, but she came to us before I could taste my salad. During the meal, the waitress never noticed that a water needed refiling and we couldn't get her attention. She never asked if we wanted more fries. Towards the end of our meal she asked is we wanted soda refills, which we did. Good idea because soft drinks are @ $3.00. The part we disliked the most is the little computer that is at each table. I'm out to relax and want to be taken care of - not do things for myself. Patrons have to get their own bill. I could not figure out how to put in my rewards info. But be careful when your bill shows up on the screen because it automatically adds a 20% tip.  I almost missed that and then had to figure out how to change that to put in the amount we wanted to tip. You sign the screen, but the total was not there.  I summoned the waitress to make sure the amount was correct and then asked about a receipt.

Tim C.,"Stockton, CA",3,7,1,1.0,7/28/2016,"Tonight's experience at Red Robin was horrible at best and we will NEVER come back. It started with being told a wait time of 15 minutes that stretched to 25 while multiple tables sat empty waiting to be cleaned. The hostesses appeared quite inept at figuring out how to estimate seating times or keeping track of who and where to seat guest. Once we were finally seated the server offered us the free fries at least 3 times and finally brought 1 basket only when my pregnant daughter's food (soup for goodness sake) was still not out 15-20 minutes after the rest of the food. The wait staff wandered in and out of kitchen perhaps checking on the status of the food multiple times and nearly always returned empty handed. When our food finally came it was only half the order, the soup and a Cobb salad took another 15-20 minutes. The manager was no where in sight and we only received an apology from the waitress who did manage to get the late food removed from our bill (even if only to save her tip it was good). Needless to say by the time the missing foods came out the rest of us had finished eating. It was a total waste of two hours for mediocre food and crappy service. Guess we cross one more restaurant off the list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton?start=200
Steve-Jen D.,"Acampo, CA",3,2,,1.0,7/6/2016,"We have been to Red Robin in other locations and were glad to see that one had come to Stockton. Unfortunately, the experience was not good. It was fairly slow tonight and we sat at the bar. Our bartender/server Sean was great. We ordered two beers and two burger entrees. Sean was knowledgeable about the menu and made good suggestions. The food came out around 20 minutes later and one of the burgers was wrong. We sent it back, but the reorder took another 20 minutes, so I ended up finishing my burger before my husbands even came out. As we waited, we watched as our server Sean was taking other patrons orders, making drinks, making milkshakes, and packing up to-go orders. We felt guilty asking him for anything as he quickly rushed around the bar trying to take care of everyone with no additional help in sight. Meanwhile, we had a clear view of the two hostesses standing around chatting with each other and checking their cell phones throughout our visit. Can't imagine why two hostesses were even needed since it was slow and why couldn't one of them be helping over at the bar. It was sad to see such a poorly managed operation. We asked Sean if we could talk to his manager and Eric came out shortly after. We shared our experience and observations. We even suggested that the to-go business be moved over to the hostess station because it was ridiculous to expect the bartender to handle that too. Eric said that it was a corporate policy that hostesses not handle the to go business. He also said that they had no familiarity with the menu and could not assist the bartenders in any way, because they are the ""face of the company"". No making milkshakes, no going to the kitchen for ranch dressing...nothing.  So....the faces of the company stand around checking their phones and gossiping while customers wait to be served....and the manager blames his company's policies. The one star here is for Sean because no one else we encountered deserves one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton?start=200
a.b. f.,"Stockton, CA",0,25,8,3.0,9/24/2016,"I would have rated my experience higher if not for the pricing and quality of the food.  $5.00 for a very small paper bowl of thin tortilla chips and the salsa & guacamole dip were in these little take-out size containers.  A hefty price for the little we got.  But to give credit where it's due:  The chips/guac/salsa was good.  Then my husband order his $13.99 smoke n pepper flavored hamburger and got this sweet flavored sauce hamburger instead. When he mentioned it to the server, who admitted it was a mistake, my husband got his smoke n pepper flavored hamburger ""fast""....but the patty was not pink as he requested and it was ""dry"".  I think they have hamburger patties just sitting there for instances such as this.  His order came with ""bottomless fries"", but every portion fit into the size of your palm.  He got 2 ""bottomless fries"" refills which is equivalent to the size of an initial first order elsewhere that I won't mention.  I paid $6.99 for my tavern mac n cheese and the side was a salad.  To say the salad was bigger than the mac n cheese was an understatement.  The mac n cheese was the serving size for ""kiddies"" like the those instant mac n cheese bowls.  Though dry, the cheese flavor was still good. The server was super friendly, no fault there, but the food and the prices were a bit exorbitant for the little portions we got.

She walked away. kiosk had limited selection and no soups to choose which is part of what we wanted. Appetizers came out delayed and several minutes apart.Our waitress visited everyone around us but never us. It was beyond ridiculous, laughable really. We finally had enough and asked another waitress, not oir own who was continously MIA, to speak with the manager. for a brief moment we had service and a person trying to do there job and i thank the manager who was the only positive thing throughout. The Burgers were wrong. I wanted medium i got well done. My wife wanted extra onions and got none. My grandmothers burger was supposed to have thick cut peppered bacon, it was plain. My fathers burger had an egg, they had to make it late and it took 15 min(to fry an egg?) It was like they intentionally were being bad.

Something wrong with this place,i tell you what. the inside tables location is sort of weird, but  its ok, ma by they have something on they mind, that we do not know.the waitress was on trainee, she was all nice and sweet.But the food......oh,boy! first, we ordered artichoke dip, that in the menu said, coming with celery,carrots sticks and chips, so, when it arrived- the dip looks like someone spread it all over the dish, with a fingers or something, was no carrots and no celery sticks ,i had to ask our waitress, so she brought it in, she apologized and did said that there  are trainee on the kitchen also.Ok, here come my clam chowder,barely warm, no potato, no clams, looks like a puree soup. My husband's burger was WET AND MUSHY ! Like it was just microwaved. What the hell?? His fries was also old and re-heated, i mean, you know how fresh fries taste like, right?  I've ordered steamed broccoli ,yeah, they was steamed all right, about 3 days ago, besides, they was all so old, the florets was yellow and dead, i mean, i know how to cook, and i cook everything from scratch at home, so, i was thinking, if they let such a broccoli go on the floor, what they think customers are- a donkey who can not recognize dead broccoli from alive and fresh? The turkey in my BLT Club wrap was almost frozen. The ice water stinks, i mean, STINKS! Even my lemon didn't help much  .

That was the highlight of the experience. 7 out of the 8 orders were wrong and missing items and a bowl of tortilla soup took 30 minutes to be brough out. After fixing a few of the orders, they forgot to bring a few side items and water. Finally, they brought the check and the water but didn't ask if we wanted to order dessert. 4 of us did actually. I asked to speak with the manager and explained the situation. We were apologized to and give 25% off the bill along with a $20 gift card. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and went back today, 6/23/16. Well, again, the service was horrible. After ordering, we waited an hour. Then the server comes over to inform us the order didn't get put in the first time but the food would be shortly. Same story. Spoke with the manager and was given 25% off the bill and a $20 gift card. That's their answer to horrible service. Just give a discount and gift card because actually fixing your system would be to hard. I will not be going back a 3rd time.

With this being a new restaurant (and a CHAIN restaurant) you would think they would have their servers trained! We got there and had to wait 15 mins, which wasn't bad for the restaurant being so busy. After being seated, our server Stephanie ""greeted"" us twice before we even got to order drinks. I asked her if I could have a side order of sweet potato fries for my daughter to snack on before we ordered. She replied ""I would have to charge you for that since you haven't made your order yet. So you would end up paying twice"". I was a little confused, so I told her I would wait. We ordered drinks and waited for her to come back and take our food order. I ordered the D.G.B burger with sweet potato fries. When it was my boyfriends turn to order we seemed to get rude responses. He ordered the Blue Cheese burger with a cup of chili. Once the food arrived to our table, we realized that my fries were cold and so was his chili. We tried to look for our server or ANY server for that matter to let them know that we wanted a HOT bowl of chili but did not manage to flag one down. By he time we had almost finished our burgers, Stephanie finally comes by our table to check on us. She takes the cold chili and tell us that she will have the kitchen make a new one. We finish the rest of our food and wait a few minutes for the chili to arrive. Stephanie brings the ""new"" bowl of chili (she reheated it). At this time she finally decides to ask us if we wanted any refills, does NOT ask us if we want any desserts or how our burgers were, if we needed any napkins, etc... We decide not to finish the chili and wait for her to bring the check. After 5-10 minutes of waiting (we had been there for about an hour and a half total) Stephanie walks by our table trying to deliver food to the table behind us and we ask her for the check. Once again she gives us a rude response by telling us to pay the check on the ziosk tablet that sits on every table in the restaurant. What if we wanted to pay cash?!!!! Anyways, our total for 2 burgers and 2 soft drinks came out to $41.43 so we left $45 on the table and got out of there! We ALWAYS tip more than were supposed to but in this case we didn't.

She finally came by and asked if I needed anything...and pretty much kept going...so we couldn't tell her how horrible the food was. I asked her what she recommended for a big burger...my burger was smaller than my moms. And I only had 5 fries on my plate. She literally checked on us 3 times without us asking for something. On top of all this I was charged $1.99 for an entertainment fee...apparently that was bc I played a game of that lil tv thing...the only time I touched it was to call the server.

Bryan W.,"Lodi, CA",0,1,,1.0,8/7/2016,"Last night I went to Red Robin Stockton location. It had been a long day and we were looking for a good place to eat. I have been to Red Robin Elk Grove, CA location and had a pleasant time. Upon arrival at the Ref Robin Stockton  I was told there was a 20 minute wait. Looking around I saw that there were many open tables that hadn't been bussed yet. I asked the hostess at the from desk if I could sit at one of the open tables in the bar area. Now bar seating rule of thumb is that these tables are first come first serve at the Elk Grove Red Robbin this is how it works as well. To my dismay the hostess informed me that only seats at the bar counter were first come first serve. So we decided to wait for the tables to get bussed which took 35 minutes. I have worked in food service and know that there are complications when it is short staffed but it takes only takes a competent worker a few minutes to properly buss a table to be ready for service. So when seated at the table they never gave us napkins and dining utensils to eat with. While waiting what seemed like forever for my food I watched staff members chatting behind me and talking. This gives good reason to believe that the my wait was caused by slacking off from staff. It took a grand total of 2 hrs to get food and leave the place that looked like a dump with tables uncleaned and food all over the floor.

The sweet potato fries were to skinny and not enough flavor. We ordered onion rings for the table that were bomb and the garlic fries were pretty good. The khalua shake was really good but loose like it had sat for a minute. Couldn't taste the ice cream just a milk consistency. The flavor itself was on point.

Stephanie M.,"Stockton, CA",0,2,,5.0,6/23/2016,"Our server, Gabriella, was AMAZING! She did everything to make sure we were accommodated and she was on point with the drink/bottomless fries refills. Only thing I recommend is that the trash in the front of the entrance gets cleaned up. Other than that it's a pretty cool place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton?start=240
Celeste M.,"Stockton, CA",1,5,1,5.0,5/20/2016,Best food and service yea it took a while to get in and eat but that's understandable since they just opened and everyone wants to try it!

Dylan G.,"Stockton, CA",0,27,2,2.0,9/20/2016,"i love the onion rings here with the ranch dip, it's amazing. although i had gotten 9 onion rings instead of 13, from what it says online. that'll minus 1 star. i got the garlic fries also and i couldn't take more that 3 bites they made my fingers smell weird like a metal scent lol fishy scent also. which was truly weird so minus 1 star for that. the burger was really bland too. the waitress was really annoying every 5-8 mins she would come around and ask ""how's the food"" ""you need anything else"" ""is there anything i can do"" like no if there's anything i'd like, i would ask you. so minus 1 star for that. also, they charge a connivence fee for that annoying tablet at the table. literally. that's ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton?start=240
Cecil P.,"Stockton, CA",2,13,1,1.0,5/28/2016,"We got here at 7:10. It is now 8:49 and we have no food. Our 20 minute wait became 46 and our name had disappeared from the wait list. We were told the computer made a mistake and took us off. I could see our name on the list with no check mark by it. A simple apology always beats a lie. They tried to seat us at a table with no chairs because it was in direct line of kitchen. There were numerous tables in the side room empty and we asked for one. They put us there and we asked for a manager to explain why we were removed from the list. He said the staff told him there were 2 similar names and ours was accidentally marked as seated. I explained that we had seen our name and it wasn't marked off, they had made a mistake and lied rather than being honest. Won't be able to comment on the food. We are leaving. We have noticed the people seated 10 minutes before us still have no food. I'm hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-stockton?start=240
