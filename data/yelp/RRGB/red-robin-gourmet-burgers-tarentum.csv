Emily H.,"Orange Park, FL",51,191,71,4.0,10/22/2011,"This place is usually nice to come for dinner, never really ate lunch here. I have been to a few different ones along the east coast, i recommend the burgers. The staff at this particular location seem very nice and know what they are doing. Drinks are very tasty!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum?start=20
Steve M.,"Oakland, Pittsburgh, PA",1,8,2,1.0,11/20/2013,Sorry to report the $10.00 burger was a big disappointment and that is because it was soooo small and burned. When I say small this was like a single patty at mcD's. It is as if RR decided quality is not relevant nor quantity. The server was great took excellent care if us very attentive. Oops the people behind us got up and walked out...no service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum?start=20
Darla D.,"Valdosta, GA",3,27,35,3.0,6/7/2014,"To start off, the whole restaurant was freezing cold. The chips that we ordered were very greasy. It wasn't the best place to eat at. I just don't like eating food when I'm cold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum?start=20
John H.,"Valencia, PA",3,72,19,4.0,11/2/2011,"We were at the Mall and my son wanted to go here for lunch. I was hesitant because when I looked up the Yelp reviews on my mobile App. It only 2 1/2 stars. Also I have been to the one in Cranberry for dinner a couple times, and was never really satisfied. This time I got the Whiskey River BBQ Burger with sweet potato fries. My son got a Bacon Cheeseburger and my wife got a Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad. Everything was cooked perfectly and everybody was very satisfied with everything we got.       At first I thought $10.00 was a bit much for a burger but when you look at all the toppings that the burger came with, and then add bottomless fries and free drink refills it's really not that bad. A lot of restaurants charge extra for every extra topping, refills and more fries.      My wife loves the Red Robin special spice that they have on the tables. She had to buy some to take home.     All of the staff at this location was very good at every thing they did, all the way from the kitchen to the server and even the manager that stopped by to see if everything was ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum?start=20
Michael P.,"Oakmont, PA",9,7,,4.0,6/26/2013,I've always enjoy Red Robin and the one at the Pittsburgh Mills Mall is just as good as the others. The waitstaff was friendly and quick without being intrusive or overbearing. I usually get the garden burger as a substitute and it was very well cooked considering it can come it very soggy. I always try a new burger at Red Robin when I go and there have certainly been some hits and misses. I recommend the bacon and blue cheese burger. Delicious.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum?start=20
DD D.,"Allegheny, PA",1,10,1,3.0,1/2/2016,The burgers were excellent but they must have  gone to Ohio to get the meat.  The wait (after we ordered) was unbelievably long.  The atmosphere is nice and so are the people.  They seemed to be short staffed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Karla D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",338,918,2097,3.0,12/28/2016,The food is average chain fare but an ok place to stop for a quick bite before a movie. And I mean who doesn't love bottomless fries? I had the bruschetta chicken sandwich and it was good. My boyfriend had a bleu cheese burger and our friend a veggie burger. Everyone was happy with their selection.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
D T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",47,233,24,3.0,3/27/2017,"Burger was good, service was good, wait time average, fried cod bland and tasteless, kids pizza ok, tortilla soup good and not too spicy. What restaurant only has one yellow crayon for a 4 yo? We asked about other colors and they said they were out until the truck came tonight??  From the looks of the other reviews this place needs a little more attention from the management end. It was better than I remember it however. Only gave 2 stars in 2011.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Chelsea C.,"Oakmont, PA",121,333,75,2.0,11/8/2016,"I used to be a fan of Red Robin - but not anymore. We had to wait forever for our food. Our burgers were sloppily made with not very much flavor in the meat beyond the toppings. We only got a tiny handful of fries on each plate, which were barely dusted in Red Robin seasoning, and had to wait forever and a day for more fries. What a waste of time and money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Lisa D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",21,19,9,4.0,1/6/2017,"We love coming to Red Robin as a family.  The food is decent, the price is decent and you can take the kids!  I love their steak fries with camp fire sauce!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Brandon R.,"Pittsburgh, PA",30,52,,2.0,4/29/2016,"Stopped here for a quick bite tonight.  It was fairly busy but we were seated fast.  Our waitress was very nice and quick to take our order.  I ordered a veggie burger and my fiance ordered a cheeseburger, no appetizer.  As we waited for our food I started leafing through the drink and dessert menus on the table.  They were both sticky and covered in residue so that was gross. We waited 25 minutes until our food came.  Our waitress came over and apologized for the wait and said she was unsure why it was taking so long. My veggie burger tasted good, but lacked toppings.  Two very thinly sliced tomatoes and an extremely small skiff of lettuce (nothing like the photo on the website-bursting with fresh lettuce and bright red tomatoes and pickles).  It was thin as a mcdonalds hamburger and was ate in a few minutes.  My fiance's burger was made much better and she had no complaints.  I also ordered broccoli as a side.  I think I got 4 pieces...not joking. Idk, i might pop back in sometime but not in a hurry.  There's a local chain that I've fallen for that can't be beat when it comes to burgers-Red Robin could become a faint memory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Bob S.,"DuBois, PA",0,4,,1.0,7/23/2016,"Leave Fido at home. I am very upset your shift manager denied us the opportunity to have our dog on your patio during lunch.  It was sunny and over 90 degrees so we could not leave her in the car.  While my wife waited for a take-out order her waitress was surprised to hear we were not allowed to have our (14 lb) dog on the patio.   I was told us it was against the law for non-service dogs to be on the patio. According to Pennsylvania law, non-service dogs are not allowed in areas where restaurants prepare food.  This is understandable. However very few restaurants prepare food on their outside patio.  Our dog has been allowed on the patio of this restaurant in the past as well as other Red Robins, Panera Bread and Chipotle restaurants.  In fact this was the first time we were denied the opportunity to have our dog with us in a restaurant outside seating area. There are lots of restaurants in Pennsylvania that allow dogs in their outside seating area.  Check out this website:  My wife and I will not be back to this Red Robin restaurant without management extending an apology and letting us know our dog is welcome in the patio seating area during future visits.  I tried to send this message to the Red Robin store using email but the Red Robin email system denied delivery.  Hmmmm!  No complaints allowed?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Jamie F.,"New Kensington, PA",0,15,8,2.0,3/1/2016,The hostess was very welcoming. The waitress was poor. Didn't even ask us if we wanted additional drinks or desserts. The person who cooked my burger needs to find a job he's good at cause it certainly isn't grilling meat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Kalyn B.,"Rossiter, PA",134,137,63,4.0,9/10/2015,"This was my first experience at Red Robin and I'm thrilled to say that I can't wait to return. We told our waitress that it was our first time to Red Robin and she was very kind and explained the entire menu. The food was excellent! It came out quickly, tasted fresh, and piping hot! The turkey burger was the best I've ever had!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Mike And Nita B.,"Bettendorf, IA",20,170,,2.0,8/25/2015,Can't recommend it .  Service was extremely slow and they were not busy.   The staff doesn't seam to enjoy their job which is typically a reflection of the quality of the management.   Nobody was smiling. Not a fun place and I sat in the bar. My burger was OK.  The mini wedge salad was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Mara K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",153,280,19,2.0,7/8/2014,"I learned that Red Robin began as a kick ass burger joint in Northern California.  Like a book made into a movie the original story is always the best.  Red Robin is your typical chain restaurant with all the bells and whistles that go with being a chain.  Glossy menus with a bunch of appetizers and desserts to choose from.  And of course, every combination of ingredients for burgers. I ate here because I had a casual business meeting.  We all got a different style burger, and one member of our group opted for a healthier vegetable burger.  Each choice comes with unlimited fries.  (I can physically hear the calorie count rising). I got a Western style bacon burger and asked for it to be cooked at medium temperature.  It came out slightly crisp, more of a medium well.  I didn't hate it, but certainly didn't want to run back for another. My biggest problem was the service.  We were there for lunch and it was only slightly crowded.  While seated immediately and given our drinks right away, after lunch was served we didn't see our server for some time.  I had to flag her down for the bill and then it got switched with another diner's bill and I was charged the wrong amount - a lesser amount I may note - and it took a long time for them to correct.  I think they need to get their act together here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Joley B.,"Rochester, NY",17,412,416,3.0,10/6/2013,"This is a decent spot to grab a bite when you're traveling in the area.  The manager I think was full of life and filled us in on the Giant Rubber Duck that was in Pittsburgh while we were there!   The wait staff seemed friendly and quick - though I was surprised by their attire.  I would expect a little more put-together appearance for such an establishment. I had a salad, and my husband had a burger.  They were ok.  Nothing stellar or out of the ordinary.  It was sufficient.  Though I do enjoy their fries.  And their seasoning.  Love that there is extra on the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Cora L.,"Creighton, PA",10,39,22,1.0,11/3/2014,"I remember when this place first opened in the Mills I was so excited. They had big portions cheap prices and cool atmosphere for my kids and me. I soon discovered once their reputation caught on they minimized quantity maximized their profits all while sacrificing quality and experience.   Don't get me wrong your kids will be tugging your shirt in excitement once you first walk in the door my smiles will soon be frowns when their little bellies start grumbling and service is slow. This place is usually packed and under-serviced. We gave the new APP menu a go which was a terrible mistake. She brought out a small souffle cup and a handful of chips when we ordered the 8$ spinach and artichokes dip, I literally thought it was a joke, ended up just giving it to the kids due to their food was still not out.    Our meals came out so late. My 4 year old wouldn't eat his burger it was burnt not sure how that happens on a conveyer belt but it did. Nothing was really good. Never got refills on anything server just never came back. Another server was running around we ended up grabbing her due to kids waiting so long they fell asleep in the booth (never a good thing). The experience was disappointing just thinking about what red robin used to be. Check came out at whooping 90 bucks for unhappy kids and horrible service. :(  ANOTHER FAIL",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Jenny C.,"Gibsonia, PA",62,100,22,4.0,8/17/2013,"First of all they have ""skinny"" drinks!  I'm drinking a Stoli Raspberry Lemonade.  Only 80 cal!  This is the first time I've been to this location.  Everyone was very friendly. From the guy who took our name at the door, to the hostess, to the waitress.  I also LOVE their burgers.  My favorite is the BBQ bacon burger.  Then there's the fries.  They are refillable with no limit!  Can you say, ""Red Robin ... YUM!"" Ok, my fruit salad arrived as I was typing this review.  NOT YUM!  It was slimy and half rotten.  Other than that, it was a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Casey R.,"Oakmont, PA",48,7,,1.0,4/3/2015,"As a step above fast food and below neighborhood restaurant dining, I expected far better.  I have been to this location several times, but this time it was not at all good.  The crab burger had good flavor but was obviously a Food Service product. I do expect even chains to actually MAKE food. Also, the burger was deep fried and not drained. The grease dripped out of it and soaked into the bun. The cook obviously did not care one bit about actual food. No respectable cook (I know it couldn't have been a chef) would serve something in this condition.  And do not waste the extra buck on the garlic herb fries. They just have garlic salt on them and are dusted with Parmesan that has clearly been sitting out for days. We were the second customers in the door today, so it couldn't have merely sat out all day. The day had just begun.  It's a shame. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Jennifer G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",100,411,180,4.0,1/2/2013,"I don't often crave burgers or red meat, but when I do, I'm glad Red Robin is around.  They have an excellent variety of burger options with unique toppings such as pineapple!  And you can't go wrong with bottomless steak fries.   Make sure you try the speckled lemonade.  It too, has endless refills and the cut up strawberries inside the lemonade are a perfect sweet treat to compliment your burger.  If you are watching your calorie intake, you can get it made with diet lemonade. A seasonal special was the Sam Adams milkshake.  It was so bizarre, yet tempting, that I had to try,  I'm not even quite sure how to describe the flavor, but it was a nice treat and totally worth trying if you like both beer and milkshakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Tammie H.,"Natrona Heights, PA",1,2,,2.0,6/22/2015,"Went in with my family around 2pm.  Our seating was in the corner.   Restaurant was nearly empty.  Paying for our check noticed that others guest were having there fries delivery in a silver tin can.  So, my boyfriend asked Joe our server ""what's with the fries coming in that tin can like cup"" he said there were none clean. Keep in mind it was empty in the restaurant at the time. We were informed it was part of the presentation. Why weren't ours presented like that? Not too mention they weren't hot. No excuses",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Jacob S.,"Highland Park, Pittsburgh, PA",4,30,4,2.0,6/17/2015,Lousy experience tonight. Servers seem untrained and unprepared. My French onion soup was a mix of charred and raw onions. And it took forever to get our burgers. I had the Fiery Ghost Double. It was underwhelming at best.  The weirdest thing was the server refilling our drinks with a paper to go cup.  Hopefully they were just having an off night.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Jason D.,"Gibsonia, PA",20,114,,3.0,8/5/2013,"Here's the problem with Red Robin....there are other places that do gourmet burgers at about the same price, but do it alot better.    I recommend hitting up Burgatory if you are in the market for a great gourmet burger with character and flavor.    You could do alot worse than Red Robin however, though the one at the Mills I have had hit and miss on service quality.    The food is better than say Eat-N-Park, or many diner burgers.    I do recommend to people with children, as the speckled lemonade, and atomsphere is very family friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
Annie Z.,"New Kensington, PA",0,3,,1.0,12/27/2015,"This place warrants my first Yelp review.  Really only to  complain in absolute amazement in this establishment's total lack of concern for their patrons' disgust about the ambience, disorganization, and quality.  Main course was served about a minute and a half after appetizer.  A medium burger was served raw.  The loudness of the milkshake machine was discussed at several tables in disbelief, ruining the ambience and appetites.  The disinterest of our concern from the server and management was ultimately the deciding factor in our not even paying the bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tarentum
