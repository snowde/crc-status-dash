Pete D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,29,,3.0,12/2/2017,"I've eaten at this location a few times and unfortunately it has gone downhill.  Service: It seems this is a roll of the dice. Some report good service, others say service was terrible. We had a server that was either inexperienced or didn't care. We ordered 3 drinks and she brought them out individually over a span of 15 mins?! When she took our order she didn't mention any of the specials, but did try to up-sell us. She came by once to check on us, but by that time we were almost done eating. I was cautious about touching the iPad device on the table, who knows how often they clean them? Prices: I noticed the prices went up since my last visit which isn't too surprising. The issue is they're at a price point that it's not worth it to go there. For $12 I expect a large gourmet burger and a heap of fries, which I didn't get. For half the price I can get a top burger at Carl's. I also ordered a draft beer which cost $5.40 for the 16oz, (WTF?)! I guess this is to off-set the happy hour prices? Never again.. Food: in a nutshell it is a poor value. I ordered the Boss Hog burger and of course didn't look anything like the picture. It was suppose to be pulled pork atop a beef patty, instead it was a few slivers of pork, I really had to look for it. The bottomless fries only works if you have an attentive waitress, which we didn't.  Fortunately we have a lot choices in T.O. when comes to restaurants.

Bonni W.,"Oak Park, CA",0,20,6,1.0,1/7/2018,"I'm not sure why I'm actually here AGAIN, every time we come, it takes forever to get a waiter to even bring us water, we are so parched by the time we get it and they leave and say ""be right back to take your order"" ...................my 50th Birthday  is soon approaching before they come back to actually rushing us and taking it.... We found out he wasn't even our waiter but was happy to take as long as we were on the ball about it......I feel rest assured that he repeated it all back but wait..... let see what happens???? Ok still waiting..... It's now been 30... I will say the manager came over and was sincerely nice but it's always the same excuse..... the restaurant is maybe 50% full and she tells us that corporate didn't forecast right for tonight's crowd.... oh and they are staffing tighter because of the minimum raise hike, seriously..........I think she was almost embarrassed as she also mentioned the other manager was in the kitchen cooking our dinner. Food is here about 40 minutes later and yep, two out of the 3 orders is wrong....oh and overcooked..... This isn't their fault..... it's mine, I must be a glutton for punishment....and Red Robin, you should be seriously ashamed how you run this business and how you run your employees to the ground.... shame on you and shame on me for coming back, it will be my last.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks

Eddie E.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,9,4,1.0,12/15/2017,"Horrible experience today waiting for more than 45 minutes to get our order, and then just one order of fries came. When we ordered two full orders that came with burgers and fries. I had to go get the manager, and the manager asked what table are you sitting in, I pointed towards our table, and then she said "" oh #12"" As though I know the numbers of the tables.  Come on, I don't work there, and No, there no numbers posted. She went to go find out about our orders, never apologized, nor said anything about how long before we get our food.

Joe B.,"Goshen, KY",4,3,,2.0,1/13/2018,"One of my favorite casual burger spots - great variety of burgers including price ranges, really good salads, sandwiches are great, and pretty good entrées. They are usually pretty crowded due to popularity so easier to just order take out - have been doing do for the past few years. Really good website ordering so you can customize to the Nth degree if you want. Relocated to a new area 4 mos ago and tonight was our 5th attempt at ordering to go. As usual, the website was perfect - it remembered our location of choice and was easy to log on to our loyalty account. As usual, finished the order and got the confirmation saying my order would be ready at 7:59pm. As usual,  I arrived on time to check in at the time the current confirmation told me to. As usual, the hostess told me they were working on my order. At 8:10pm I asked the hostess if she could check on my order since I could see a few to go orders being packed from where I was standing  and saw one of the bags get moved to a heat lamp. The hostess never came back. At 8:14pm a young man came to deliver a to go order but the customer had left for a moment. He saw me watching and asked if I was waiting for an order - I said yes and gave my wife's name- he said that my order was ready except for my drink (my order was the one on the heat lamp and had been there for about 5 min before I was told it was ready). He came back with my drink immediately and started to verify my order. I noticed there was no teriyaki sauce and no garlic bread - which is the norm for this location to forget. As he went to retrieve the missing items, I tasted one of the French fries and noticed that it was cold. Its 8:20 now and family expecting food so I didn't make the Temps an issue. Got home and salads on came with 1 mini cup of dressing and no breads sticks for the kids meal and the fruit was shabby at best. Been a fan for many years but this location is a no-go for me going forward. I hope this gets read by management there cause I can't get their attention while I'm in the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks
Genevieve L.,"Ventura, CA",0,7,,4.0,1/8/2018,"Southern charm burger is to die for!! Of all the Red Robins this is the only one in Ventura County that seats based on age group (21+, teens, and kiddies) which I think is a great idea!! If you don't have children typically, you don't want to sit around a bunch of screaming kids. I speak for all the RR with the next few comments..It would be cool if they brought out fresh fries from the beginning not when you ask for a refill. Other than that, service is usually slow. I will say, I went to the RR off E Main St in Ventura, the waitress was rather attentive! So kudos to her!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks
Gabrien R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,3,,2.0,12/30/2017,"I typically love going here on occasion. My family of 10 recently went to dinner here and we got pretty bad service. My father has a gluten allergy so he order something off their gluten free menu, when they brought all the food to the table they gave my dad his meal but it wasn't the gluten free option he ordered. Alongside that we got the wrong drinks and one of the burgers was made incorrectly.

I don't expect greatness when I go into a burger chain but often they make up for it with their service. I have to say, Red Robin's service is mediocre, at best.

Maricela R.,"Oxnard, CA",195,260,765,3.0,2/1/2017,"The staff deserve 5 stars, our waitress was very attentive and friendly. There was absolutely no wait on a Friday night which was cool. They have happy hour specials that seem good but when I went it wasn't happy hour time. They have bottomless fries which is a cool concept but i doubt people will eat more than 2 orders of fries lol the garlic cheese fries were delicious. The mac and cheese was average. I tried the vegan burger it was good. You can ask for any of their burgers to come with the vegan patty. I had the sangria, it was decent. My friend had a burger and a beer. He said his meal was average. They have the little machine thing, you can order things and you pay using it too.

Benjamin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",461,460,191,3.0,1/31/2017,"Waiting for a movie to start at the theater next door, I popped into Red Robin for a quick bite to eat as I came directly from work and knew I wouldn't be able to eat again until after the movie.  It was a Tuesday night so the restaurant was fairly quiet.  There wasn't a host when I walked in so I thought it was a seat-yourself deal (shows you how often I frequent Red Robin) and I went into the bar area and had a seat at one of the high top tables.  It's so 1990's restaurant like (not in decor, but in business concept) though the decor could use a good overall.  The bathroom were sticky and smelled. At the table, nobody came even though several servers walked right past me.  I tried several times to get the bartender's attention but she didn't notice me either.  I was going to have to get up and walk over to the bar, which I did, and asked if there was a server on duty.  She was apologetic and went into the kitchen and told me someone was coming.  Nobody came even though several servers walked right past me.  Finally, a guy who just started his shift introduced himself and took my order. He checked on me occasionally and made sure my drink was topped off.  He was a good server.  He wasn't over the top, but also not a grump either.  I got a burger and 'bottomless' fries.  I don't get that concept.  Who wants to keep filling themselves up with french fries?  The burger came out surprisingly fast and then I understood the 'bottomless fries' concept.  You're given such a small portion (maybe 8-10 fries), most people would probably keep asking for more.  I don't really like fries, so I just ate the first portion and I was content.  It's a big burger and I've got to say, it's one of the better burgers I've had in awhile.  The patty is flavorful and the toppings don't soak the roll but blend nicely together.   I hardly doubt I'll return as this is pretty far from where I live, but if you want a burger, it's a good place to drop in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks

I couldnt finish it without removing the fried jalapeno, the not fried jalapeno and gulp a lot of ice cold water. But im not blaming them, they gave me exactly what I asked for.

Peter C.,"Upper Darby, PA",93,1,,1.0,8/27/2017,"I was just accused and lectured by the manager of this establishment about underage drinking after they saw my wife drinking my alcoholic drink. I guess our server Chloe didn't even have the courage just to ask my wife for ID, instead our server straight up escalated it to the manager who immediately approached us like we were criminals of sort. There was not even a polite request for her ID. We immediately even offered to show our ID as well and went to obtain the ID to prove that we were over 21 without further causing a scene like the manager was in front of everyone. Even after the incident, there wasn't any apology at all from either Chloe or the manager.  They even seemed to purposely left our order hanging for more than 45 minutes and never came by once to tell us about our order while the other groups around us received their order.  Definitely a horrible experience with the manager and the server of this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks
Christopher D.,"Westlake Village, CA",4,19,,1.0,3/14/2017,"I'll give it 1 star for fond memories. I used to be a regular at the old Agoura location before it closed down forcing me here.  It's the mall so parking is horrible and I'd say 30% of the time, I just keep driving and find another restaurant with the wife. The last two times have pretty much diminished any desire I have to return to this location. A year or so ago, the place was upbeat, the bartenders friendly, and always on top of things. These last 3 trips have been a literal embarrassment. I stopped in for a late lunch (around 3PM) and the place was pretty much empty except for the bar area. Usually I just grab myself a seat at the bar and be on my way. No one showed up in the bar for about 10 minutes. When they finally did, I was able to at least get a appetizer and drink in. 10 min later the water comes, and maybe 10 after that the appetizer shows up. (In this time, the staff hadn't even returned to take an order. Ended up standing my menu vertically to get their attention) Asked for place settings multiple times, was never provided any until I had fully eaten. Looking around it looks like there was maybe 3 people on-staff the entire time. The cook, the manager, and maybe 1 hostess. It's been like that fairly frequently. The entire bar area was a pretty uncomfortable scene with multiple people complaining about the incredibly long waits. As I left, there was a couple arguing with the manager about the service, so I wasn't the only one. The manager didn't even really seem to care about the complaints and the answer was ""If you're hungry, you can always eat elsewhere!""  It's easier for me to cut my losses and just stop coming here. I felt like I honestly wasted my money there for sub-par food. This place also has a nasty habit of ""forgetting"" you had an appetizer/salad order and it just sits on the prep table until you either mention it or they realize it's there. Not cool for you to deliver an appetizer to a group, and then minutes later bring the entree. They say unlimited fries, which I now understand. The old Agoura location was pretty nice and would just set a basket of fries next to your entree. Here it's like they find the 9 soggiest fries they can and put it in the basket. Really... 9 fries? The last few times I felt like I needed to know ahead of time what I wanted or I'd be in for a wait.  Think I saw my server make 3 times in almost an hour. Maybe the manager changed, but boy this place is a disaster. Just save yourself the time. I can't even bring myself to go in for the free burger anymore.

Got the order completely wrong (ordered it with no mayo as I'm allergic), brought it back a second time and I'm convinced they just microwaved the burger and put it on a new bun because it was dry as hell. Asked for a knife and was handed a plastic one in a bag, was told it was because they were out of clean silverware. Never got a refill on my soda even after I asked her in twice in passing. Oh! and to top it off it was my daughters birthday (she was even wearing a pink headband that says ""Happy Birthday""). I also mentioned it to her right when we sat down so that they could come sing for her. Ordered a few sundaes for the kids including the Birthday Girl. Never did she/they come sing Happy Birthday and of course she charges me for my daughter's complimentary sundae.

Kat C.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",6,90,16,2.0,4/27/2017,"I realize I'm writing a review of a burger place from a vegetarian perspective . . . But hey it's 2017, so if a restaurant is going to offer vegetarian options they should be held accountable for their taste. The Bocca Burger I ordered was one of the worst things I've ever tasted in my entire life. That is not hyperbole. It neither looked nor tasted like any Bocca Burger I've seen in person or could find online. It was more like pinkish Solyent Green. The manager replaced the Bocca Patty with their Garden Burger ... it was also unlike any Garden Burger I've  ever seen! Both were soggy, mushy, textureless and flavorless. The manager confirmed that both are MICROWAVED. I politely explained that I don't see the point of indulging in a restaurant meal to get microwaved frozen food. She vehemently insisted they were both ""quite popular""...which I highly doubt. She took the Bocca burger off the bill...but that's not really the point. An evening out - even at Red Robin - should be a treat, not mushy microwaved food that you could prepare better at home. Although it's convenient, I won't be back to this RR. I'll be at Habit Burger where they know how to make a veggie burger without a microwave. Also, lost points for the filthy iPad ""entertainment system"" on the table...which is full of gross, greasy fingerprints and they CHARGE you $1.99 for your kids to use it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=20

We sat there for about 10 minutes before we were greeted by our server. She took our drink and app order and it took another 10 minutes to get our waters and our appetizer never came. We called our server over and ordered our burgers. It took 40 MINUTES for our food to come. It was 7:45pm on a Thursday night. There were only a few other tables. Pretty dead. We also watched our server put a beer down in front of a likely underage gentlemen at the table next to us and then AFTER he took a sip she asked ""You're 21 right?"". We were floored. Our server also touched our fries with her bare hands right on the line. EW. I've worked in a restaurant for close to 4 years and have held a Food Handlers Card the entire duration. You are NOT suppose to touch food with your bare hands. Anyways... we got our food, it was mediocre.

Parking for any of the restaurants in this location is the worst, but that's not the reason for the low rating.   The main reason is for their prices.  $9 for an order of onion rings?!?!?  REALLY?!?!?  Ok, I got over that thinking of the big bowl of clam chowder soup that was coming.  Or was it?  We were told by 3 different people that they ""had to make a new batch and it would be a few minutes until it was ready"".  Okay.  20 minutes went by and still no soup.  By now, the onion rings were gone and we were still waiting.  Finally, the server brings us our bowls (not cups) of soup.  We both stared at each other as we could not believe this small thing was the BOWL size!  No kidding, the BOWL was really a 4 inch by 4 inch SQUARE.  We laughed just thinking if this was the bigger size, what does the cup size look like?  So we ate our ""freshly made"" soup and laughed at how many undercooked pieces of potato were in it.  Overall, not a good experience, once again, and much too pricey for what we ordered.  Our bill was a little over $30 for an order of onion rings, 2 bowls of soup, 1 coke, and 1 soda water.   As we attempted to pay the bill on the electronic pad at the table, I noticed I was charged $2.99 for my soda water.  I've ordered soda water in restaurants my entire life and I have never been charged for it.  Anywhere.  No lie.  I asked our server if it was a mistake on the bill, and after getting an apology, I was told that charging for soda water was something they ""recently started doing"".  That pretty much ended it for me right there for good.  Not ever going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=20

She didn't tell us our food would take awhile due to a lot of orders. Which I completely understand but it would be nice if she checked up on us once in awhile. The only real complaint is that I order an appetizer and it took 40 minutes.. It was pretty sad.

Jeff B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,18,,2.0,12/4/2016,"Reviewing the menu you see pictures of Gourmet Burgers, juicy, cheese hanging off the edge, BBQ sauce dripping. What you actually get is a burger half the height of the picture, a dry Bun/Meat and if you look closely you may find a little BBQ sauce somewhere in there. The endless fries were dry and no amount of Ketchup could save them. To top off the experience, there was a real piece of day old Brockley, flattened  in between the pages of the menu.

This must of been a piece of heaven because from the moment we walked in, to our food, to us leaving. Such extrodinary service!!!Karina was our host and when I say host I mean it started with her. I felt like royalty and she treated me amazing! She complimented my dress and made conversation. She was far from a host robot im use to. She should be on her way up, because customer service with a smile is very rare now days. Our food was definately heaven sent. The boneless wings are the best I have ever had, and what sucks is hooters is right down the way and their wings are a 2 on a scale, where red robin hits that 10 easy! Our server Julie was sooooo funny and sweet, and she was not in a hurry to leave considering it was 930pm on a Thursday. The ice cream machine broke and even though it was a big inconvenience she didnt show it. The show must go on, and she did so well.....she excels at multi tasking and kept all her tables satisfied and attended to. I would really appreciate it, if my review was sent to Corporate. Corporate needs to be aware of this particular location. Im 29, and I've been to alot of restaurants, lots of fancy expensive ones and its sad to see that theu can not provide the service that was given here tonight. I will definately be a regular here and will be bringing all my family and friends. Thank you to Karina the host and Julie our server for making this experience one we will never forget!!! Ever! P.S I love the new happy hour menus and times. Love the new food items, and im a HUGE fan of wings and Ive tried so many all over the world  and yours are STILL my favorite! Keep up the good work!!!

She also said she would inform her manager. Her manager came by and rather then offer to discount our food order she dropped off pretzel bites. By that time we had been waiting almost an hour.

We have been in the area for three years and have seen the decline of service and now see the amazing and fun service we are consistently receiving. What warrants this review today was the outstanding service of Katelyn and her manager Brooke. I didn't have online success with a promotion and was reassured I can make my order over the phone and they would honor the promotion. I anticipate I would have to show the team my good faith effort and they were very receptive and understanding and kept their word.

It took 15 mins to get our beer brought out and 25 for our food. Fries were cold and not fresh. Sandwiches were good.

Josh W.,"Marina del Rey, CA",0,21,3,3.0,3/26/2015,"Summary: good food for a chain if you know what to order but your dinner will likely take twice as long at this location..literally.

They have a good fry seasoning too. Very kid friendly and good vibe for a family meal.  The bad: Burgers are really not special. They got rid of the salmon.  This location: I grew up with RR in a different town and have been to many locations. So far this location had the worst service. There was no wait to be seated but it took a  long time to order and receive the food. The food was not hot upon arrival (probably sat for a while before delivery to the table).

My salad was wilted and old. The server offered to bring me fruit that did not arrive until he brought our check. My son spilled his drink on our table and i cleaned it up but had to ask the server for a new replacement drink and although I didnt mind cleaning up my sons drink... He didnt seem too concerned with helping or even offering his help. He never once came around to ask if we were ok or to refill drinks once our food was delivered and the restaurant was far from full.

The Genisys was quite hot and spicy because there was jalapeños in the burger, bun, and sauce.  My Southern Charm was juicy and sweet.  The BBQ sauce and onions really made the difference.  My almost 2-yr old daughter ordered grilled chicken and broccoli (her usual) from the kid's menu and it was nice and juicy, too.  Our server was Drew and he was friendly and fast. Our fries and drinks were refilled promptly and payment via their tabletop tablet was easy.  Overall, my wife and I always enjoy Red Robin burgers and find it quite nice that they are willing to create new menu items to keep it interesting.  We love coming here, despite dealing with mall parking.

Michael R.,"Port Hueneme, CA",210,189,220,3.0,8/29/2015,"Hard to go wrong with bottomless fries and a fried egg atop your burger. Tonight I had the new ghost pepper burger with raw and fried jalepenos. Of course I had them add an egg (1.49 extra) and I requested two sample size servings of their premium dipping sauces (otherwise 75 cents each.) The chipotle sauce was okay and the sweet and spicy thai was a little better but nothing to write home (or yelp) about. Now it appeared to me that most, if not all, of the burgers came in two sizes, either a double...which you think would be the bigger of the two but isn't (it's two small kids size patties) or the big burger...which is a single thick patty (for $2 more.) Not wanting to over eat, I went with the ""double"" and it was plenty. Only drawback is you can't order your patty medium rare (or whatever you like) since the patties aren't thick enough. Service was very friendly and the kids were happy so hey, it was a win. Only real disappointment was the $5 dinner salad, which was about half the size of a Habit salad for the same price. They were also out of hard boiled eggs for my wife's Cobb salad, which was interesting since I was able to get a fried one on my salad (I'm guessing prepackaged for quality control.) Try it or Diet Final Word Try it. You could do a lot worse than Red Robin and its a lot cheaper than its in-mall competitor, Stacked (although Stacked is damn good.)

My friend & I ordered the Burgers, my wife a wrap & his wife a large fancy salad.  Being 4:30 and not jammed yet there shouldn't have been any service problems but.... After ordering, the waiter told our friend they didn't have any hard boiled eggs (?) for the salad would she like to substitute avocado... she said yes. We sat & talked for awhile when we realized it was about 20 minutes and no food yet then the waiter finally stopped by and said ""Coming up soon"".  Finally the food came.  My wife said her wrap was OK.  My ""Gourmet Burger"" looked O.K. but when I bit into it the Onion Bun tasted like it had just come out of the fridge...it wasn't toasted or heated at all...the meat was NOT handmade gourmet but seemed to be a frozen patty and it was tepid, not hot...

I flagged down the waiter and told him about the Cold Fries he said..""...oh they're a little cold?""...I said ""NO they're ice cold""...he said ""No Problem & off he went"".

To sum up this is a great place you and your buddies can hit up for lunch or dinner before catching a movie or hitting the town.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=120

Alex H.,"Ventura, CA",0,4,,1.0,2/2/2015,"Will never come here again. Tried this place 4 separate times. First time was fine. The last 3 times have been terrible.  Service is EXTREMELY slow. Poor management.  I order the same thing every time - a grilled chicken salad. It's supposed to come with bread. Literally the last 3 times I've come here I never get the bread. So I can't just say ""they forgot"" the first time it happened. It's like they skimp you on the little things to cut costs wherever possible.  Cucumber in my salad was bad last time I went. The chicken used to come out hot, lately it comes out half frozen as if it had been cooked previously and left out all night until someone ordered it. Ew. --- The very last time I came here it was dead slow (I wonder why) and it took over 40 minutes for us to receive our food.  One of the waitresses took her lunch and ate her food in front of us and the other 3 tables in our section that had ALL been sitting without entrees for over 40 minutes.  Staff was extremely unapologetic about the wait. When the food finally did come out it was cold. The table in front of us sent theirs back. The table behind us was had their appetizer completely forgotten. And have of my entree was ""missing"" as well.  The waiter asked if I wanted a refill on my iced tea.. Took him over 10 minutes to bring me a new one, it only came out with our food. If it was busy, that's one excuse. But the place was dead. Very poor service.

Ari M.,"Oak Park, CA",0,34,6,3.0,6/14/2014,"Red Robin is definitely one of my favorite places.  Went here last night (Friday) with a friend to celebrate my birthday - which was the previous day. Anyway, apparently a lot of dads wanted their hamburgers and to watch the Kings win; it was pretty packed. Only a couple of 2 person booths were empty. A lot of smaller tables had been put together for groups of over 6. But I digress. This is an awesome place. Usually I have no problems with food/service/etc. Yesterday, though, our fried zucchini (which I am obsessed with), was haphazardly cooked. My friend split a piece in half and we saw that there was flour and uncooked egg/flour mix against the zucchini. Was also a bit harder to bite into than I'm used to.  Now, I appreciate their attempts to move forward in the technological world. What I don't like is them appearing like Stacked. That place is ok, but over-priced. I liked the original Red Robin, where waiters and waitresses take the orders so the food can be customized and quesitons can be asked. That's what tips are for. Not them dropping off the food. The ordering pad was a sticky mess that we couldn't navigate because they were so busy we didn't get a waitress to show us how it works, so we kept having to press the ""call server"" button. Also - we had.... 3 waitresses. It was frustrating. They were nice, but it drove us crazy. That's how busy it was. I'm just venting though. Usually everything is great. Apparently it's best to ignore holiday weekends completely.  Quick menu synopsis: Hamburgers = awesome! They don't mess up on how to cook the meat. Soups = soupy goodness! Bottomless anything = bang for your buck! (Just make sure to press the ""call server"" button) Shakes & malts = cold deliciousness! Strawberry lemonade = childhood summertime memories! Cod filet (fish & chips) = I ordered this yesterday. Normally cooked to perfection. They had the same smidge of a problem as the zucchini. They're forgiven since it's still fresh and tasty. Overall, still go, don't take to heart the 3-star rating. Make sure to beat the peak-hours. Early birds for happy hour and elders before 7, cocktail times, or early lunchers. Try for late lunches and 7+pm dinners.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=140

Ohh, I wish I could remember her name! She's always so darn sweet and she seems genuinely happy to help us it puts a smile on my face. All the other waitresses I've had besides her have also been great too. I always get the Royal Red Robin Burger and the Freckled Lemonade. And usually the fried mushrooms for an appetizer. I come here when I want to eat my feelings. Both always arrive hot and taste really good and I also love when a new hot basket of fries comes up when I have room for it. I don't care if they are frozen or fresh at all. I just don't want to know whatever it is I love those fires! Before this Red Robin opened up I would have to go to Simi or Calabasas.

Chicken Burger, which has glorious guac in it, but minus the bacon, and while it tastes really good, I'm battling the heat factor.  If I'm expecting a freshly cooked meal, it'd better be hot upon arrival.......not so hot that I burn my tongue, but I'd better be able to feel significant warmth on my tongue.......and I rarely if ever do at these restaurants.  Their argument has been (sometimes) that the lettuce and tomato cool it off.  Give me a break..... then why is it always the right temp. if they bring it out just after cooking......with the same cold lettuce and tomato touching it?  Nice try, but I wasn't born yesterday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=140

We came an hour and half early with a party of 5 and was told the wait would be 20 minutes, after waiting about 30 minutes we asked how much longer because now we were getting nervous we might miss the movie we already bought tickets for and was told they weren't sure and was waiting for people to leave. I saw a few smaller tables open so I asked the hostess if we split our party up could we get seats faster because we were pressed for time and she said maybe, she wool check and let me know. I preceded to watch parties of 2 & 3 walk in put their name on the list them get seated..now my wait was up to 45 minutes (over double what I was originally told) and I didn't think we would have time to eat and see the movie and since I had not eaten all day I figured I would ask for a manager before I left to express my disappointment and then go to the mall food court which I really did not want to do. I spoke to Sarah the manager on duty and she handed me menus and said to decide what we want and she will put the order in so the food would come fast and she would get us a seat all together which she did in a timely fashion..still worried about not having enough time to eat and make the movie we decided to trust Sarah and I am glad we did. She brought Emily over to be our waitress and she was immediately on top of things, it felt like I was back on set with craft services...Sarah offered us an appetizer on the house, food and drinks came quickly.

James C.,"Buena Park, CA",0,5,1,1.0,11/23/2015,"Poor service. My family and I love Red Robin, reasonably priced and good atmosphere. This location, however, has gone down hill since its recent renovation. I'm pretty sure they must have changed management because my gripe isn't with a particular server or host, it's with the overall service of the entire staff which is almost always a reflection of management. First, when I entered the restaurant the hostess just stood there until I asked for a table, no ""hi welcome to red robin or at least ""welcome"", just a blank stare.  Second, it took 15 minutes to get someone to take our drink order. Third, they forgot to bring out the appetizer and decided to just deliver it AFTER our main entrees arrived. Um, by that point an appetizer is pointless. Fourth, the bartender slid my beer down on our table and  just walked away. Not that big a deal, but maybe a ""here is your beer"" would be a little better approach rather than acting like it was a chore to bring my $7 beer.  Fifth, it took 10 minutes after we said we were done to finally get our check. Considering we had already been there for over an hour because the food took so long to get to our table, our kids were antsy, and it wasn't a busy night! It took so long my wife had to leave with the kids before I could even pay.  Our last visit was the final straw. We've noticed a change over the last few months in the declining level of service but decided to brush it off each time. Not anymore though... Until this location changes the way in which they treat their customers we won't be back. Very unfortunate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=100

Alex B.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,51,,1.0,6/5/2014,"I have visited other Red Robin restaurants where the food and service were fine, so was expecting a similar experience here for lunch.  I ordered the whiskey river BBQ burger and my friend ordered the same burger but with chicken, instead of beef.  Both ordered sweet potato fries, so an easy order (or so we thought!).  Our food arrived within about 15 minutes - my burger was there, but my friend's chicken burger seemed to have become a chicken wrap, in a spinach tortilla and had not fries.  Clearly they had messed up the order so I got started eating my burger, assuming my friend's would arrive any minute.  Another 10 - 15 minutes went by before my friend's chicken burger arrived.  My fries were pretty cold and the burger didn't really taste of anything, certainly not like the description on the menu. By the time my friend's burger arrived, I was almost finished eating and there was only a mumbled apology from the waiter - he said the kitchen must have missed the order. When a similar thing has happened in other restaurants, they often offer to comp a part of the meal, or even a drink to make up for their error - no such offer here. The price of over $15.00 for an iced tea and a burger with a small portion of sweet potato fries (not 'endless' fries, at least we were not offered any more) is definitely not worth it - I don't plan on returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=100

Hubby ordered a bacon burger w/ onion on the side,  a patty melt for me, both Cooked ""pink"" and an iced tea w/ lemon and water. Lettuce, tomato, onion and mustard on the side. Not too complex, right?  Right away the waiter didn't bring the lemon and forgot to ask me what kind of cheese I wanted on the melt. Oh, oh, should have been our first clue. Almost 30 minutes later, we got our well done burgers and cold fries. Our fries ""upgrade"" to the herb, garlic, parm and parsely specials were unbelievably bad (Smash burger has nothing to worry about if RR is trying to compete with theirs). Two pieces of shriveled parsley, no garlic, a few slivers of parm, no oil and TONS of salt. Our burgers were delivered with none of the sides. When we reminded the meal deliverer (who was not the waiter), she brought them all on the same plate and also  someone I assumed was the manager. I told her both burgers were overcooked and she did her best to convince me there WAS some pink in there (somewhere). She did offer to re fire the burgers and bring new fries, but we were too hungry and (fortunately) had a gift certificate, so we weren't ""technically"" paying for the meal. Thankfully...or it ALL would have gone back to the kitchen. I have never written a review but felt compelled. The bill was just shy of $26.00 and NOTHING was correct with the order.

Jay R.,"Westwood, Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/17/2015,One thing to say about this location-bad management.  Everything was wrong the wait-30 mins with some open tables dotted around the restaurant. The service-way slow not enough servers for the crowd.  Food too slow and left under the lights too long.  Finally the whole place was cold really cold inside - they just need to turn up the thermostat.  No way all these things can go wrong at once unless management is simply squeezing every dime out of a popular place by skimping on staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=100
Joy R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",55,270,112,4.0,8/8/2013,"Superior customer service. Attentive, cheerful and way above average. Management certainly knows how to treat a diner and make it a pleasant visit. Most refreshing. The mushroom burger was loaded with fresh sautéed mushrooms. Ask for tomato and lettuce if you want it a bit more dressed up. Perfect cooked as requested, medium grilled. The endless steak fries are fat, crisp and more where they came from at any sign of a close to empty dish. Loved the smaller sized lunch burger, $6.99 and added a house salad, crisp and freshly made.

Our waiter was awesome! I forgot his name but he was great he seemed so nice and well happy to be there... Whether that was all fake or not it was still nice!

Deb G.,"Burbank, CA",0,1,,1.0,12/2/2013,"So... My boy and I went to this Red Robin after both not having been to a Robin in ages, expecting what normally comes from a visit to any Red Robin location -good burgers, solid service, fun atmosphere, etc.  While the atmosphere was there, everything else was dreadfully lacking.  I honestly couldn't believe our experience. First, and the biggest of complaints, was the service.  Our server seemed over-worked, like she had too many tables to attend to and that's not her fault.  She only refiled my water once and it was empty for about 70% of my time in the restaurant.   However, that's not the big whammy... When a customer orders a burger a certain way (absolutely plain) and the server forgets, the answer is never 'let's just scrape off what she didn't want on it,' which is exactly what happened.  The burger returned to my table after I sent it back wet in sauces I had previously asked to be removed, with small pieces of lettuce and tomato still remaining.  What's worse... I could actually see missing scrapes of bread where they tried to remove condiments and add-ons with a knife.  Ew.  Seriously, worst experience.  Honestly, if I was allergic, think of the consequences.  Absolutely poor service... a huge lawsuit waiting to happen.  Step it up, Red Robin.   Secondly, something was even up with my boyfriend's burger that night.  Super salty and in a bad way.  He's a salt lover and even he couldn't take it.  (Note:  He has eaten that same burger before at a different Red Robin location.  Huh... food for thought.) Anyway, I will not be returning to that Red Robin.  Who knows what I'll find in my burger next time.  Ugh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=160
Kristina K.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",206,112,6,1.0,2/20/2012,"Had a terrible experience here on Sunday afternoon! From the moment we walked in, all the staff members we saw looked pissed off. We were not greeted and when we were sat there was not even a smile on the girls face. The bartender was our server and there weren't many people in the bar area, but our service was lacking! Took forever to get iced teas and refills throughout our meal. There was a new person each time we needed something. We both ordered the bbq chicken wrap and soup combo and when our food should have arrived, we were approached by yet another person to tell us they were out of tortilla soup....VERY DISAPPOINTING! We should have been told when we ordered or JUST AFTER we ordered, not 15 minutes later. And the bartender/our server told us straight up he didn't want to deliver the bad news so he sent someone else out!...WTF?! I opted for a salad instead and before I could ask what dressings they had, the guy walked away!... I wanted to just leave at this point, but then another staff member brought out our food, without asking if we needed anything. I needed salad dressing! It took another 5 minutes before anyone else came over and then another 5 minutes to get the dressing.... The wrap was terrible and the balsamic dressing was too bitter. My dates fries were stale....even the iced tea had a ""dirty"" taste. I even asked for no tortilla strips on my wrap and the dressing on the side...guess what? It was made as they normally do and ignored my requests! I was fed up already so I just ate what I could, picking through the wrap. My date did the same as it was just bad food, bad service and an all around bad experience!  We will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=160

The highlight of the night had to be our server Emily! Not only did she make our dining experience an absolute pleasure, she was extremely witty, funny, helpful and delightful, smiles all around! She even helped me be more decisive in my decision making (which is hard to do since I'm extremely stubborn).

Kim T.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,4,,5.0,7/1/2012,They have gluten free hamburger buns that you can get with any burger or sandwich.  I have not have any bread since I was diagnosed with Celiac months ago and did not know what to expect.  I was so pleasantly surprised.  I guess they use Udi's buns which are delicious!  If you need gluten free and eat there you should ask for the fries & burgers without the seasoning salt (which is not safe).   The waitress was very nice and friendly.  She did switch my husbands burger with the one from another table but realized her mistake and came back immediately to fix it.  Drinks remained topped off and the food was above expectations.  Will return.  :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=160
Bethany R.,"NEWBURY PARK, CA",2,17,1,2.0,1/10/2013,Blah....have been here several times and am always left wondering how such a mediocre restaurant has such a prime spot next to the Muivco theater.

Stuart M.,"Westlake Village, CA",1,40,1,4.0,7/28/2013,Red Robin seems to have staying power when other similar restaurants (Chilli's) can't pull that off.  The food is above average for this kind of establishment but not quite able to compete with their neighbors Lazy Dog or Stacked.  Our server (Ryan) was great.  He took our order without writing anything down and then moved to another table to do the same.  I was doubtful he was going to pull off the orders but he did!  My wife's sandwich showed up missing the cheese and sauce and Ryan (followed by the manager) were on it instantly and deducted $5 off the bill.  They are now in our regular rotation of family eateries.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-thousand-oaks?start=160

Stacey D.,"Newbury Park, CA",4,9,,1.0,5/27/2013,"My family and I just finished lunch at Red Robin. A short, brunette girl introduced herself as our server and took our order. I had specified for the appetizer to come out first to our server. We waited over 30 minutes for the appetizer to come out after I had asked where our food was initially. When our wings came out , they were cold!! I complained to server Ryan and he mentioned he wasn't the server but will take care of the issue and have the kitchen re-fire the cold wings. Our server (the girl) stormed out of the restaurant and left. Guess she was done for the day and didn't bother telling us or introducing the new server. When Ryan came back with the wings  and the rest of our food, he apologized to us and said he is our server now. VERY CONFUSSING!! Mean while I thought for sure a manager would at least come by and check on u or apologize but we never saw a manager at all! Not even sure if they had one working. Finally the bill came and Ryan told our husband he was sorry again and that he asked the manager to take off the wings that took 30 minutes and were cold and the manager said know. WE aren't looking for free food at all but why would you tell a customer that your manager wouldn't take off the wings if I didn't even ask??!! It was a very slow day at Red Robin, poor service , poor food and poor management!!!! I wont be back and I hope corporate reads this and works on all of things to make it a better ran restaurant.
