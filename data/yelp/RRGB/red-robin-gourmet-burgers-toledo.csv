Trenton L.,"Doylestown, OH",14,11,,4.0,9/3/2017,"Great for family visit, but not a real date place. Great food a little bit pricey, but the unlimited fries make up for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo
Kelsey S.,"Toledo, OH",83,16,,3.0,7/27/2017,"Red Robin as a chain isn't too bad. The food is fresh and hot, but isn't anything particularly distinct from any other burger joint. Their drinks are pretty tasty, the staff is pretty great.   However, unless we're going while it's dead and not busy, a lot of times there's quite a bit of a wait to get seated to eat. Depending on who the cook is for the day, sometimes the food isn't as good as it should be with some of their other staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo
Jason T.,"Lima, OH",0,18,11,5.0,8/16/2017,Excellent service! They really take care of you. Sabrina at the bar is always checking on you. Nice spot!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo
Jeffrey B.,"Bowling Green, OH",0,2,,5.0,9/20/2016,I am a legit reviewer as any of the characters in that one South Park episode about Yelp reviewers were as well.

Tiffany W.,"San Angelo, TX",0,10,6,2.0,1/28/2017,"I'm a lover of Red Robin but I was extremely disappointed by my last visit. I went with friends and ordered the teriyaki chicken sandwich (which is one of my favorites) with a side of teriyaki sauce because I love to dip my fries in it too!!! When my sandwich arrived there was no teriyaki sauce on it and no side. When I asked about it, the food runner said ""yeah they ran out of that sauce"" I was slightly stunned because isn't that the entire point of the sandwich  she apologized but just walked away and offered no solution. When our waitress came to see if everything was ""tasting ok"" I let her know that NO it wasn't ok that I got a plain chicken sandwich. I didn't want to order anything new because it was a busy Friday night and my friends had already received their food and been eating it. Thankfully she agreed with me that a plain sandwich was not ok and she at least went to get the managers attention. The manager then arrived at the table and brought me a cup of the teriyaki sauce and apologized. So all was right in the end BUT I'm still wondering if they were OUT then were did that sauce come from and why wasn't it originally on my sandwich??? My speculation is they were running low and were just trying to conserve and to pull a fast one on me.... but it caused a lot of hassle and I'm just not pleased :/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo
Razoun R.,"Perrysburg, OH",40,108,736,2.0,4/3/2014,"The service. The service. The service!! The service is just constantly an issue. Whyyyyyyyyyyy. Why is it so hard to be cordial? Polite? Friendly? Happy? It's a customer service JOB. It's ok. I've done it and I know what it is like. Greeted by a grumpy hostess. Then comes our waiter. Where do I start. Kid was completely out of it. He mixed up my side, so instead of taking my plate back. He actually says why don't you grab your appetizer plate and slide your burger off of here. I'll bring you another side. He just stood there as I clumsily destroyed my burger as I was trying I reach into the tray that he held. Fast forward ten minutes or so. Was on the last couple of bites of burger and here comes my side. A big clump of cheesy fries that looked (and tasted) like it's been sitting under the heat lamp.  Anywhoooo. The manager was really nice. Kept trying to ask what is wrong. Was having one of those days where I didn't want to complain about the staff and have them get in trouble. But by the time the bill came I was done.  Used to come here often. Don't see that happening anymore. For about $15 a person, I'd rather have a burger somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo
James M.,"Newport, MI",57,709,347,4.0,8/20/2015,"Never been a Red Robin fan. However, with the exception of the slooow service, everything was spot on with my most recent visit. Menu has changed a bit, but in a good way. LOVED the buzzard wings, all of our burgers were GREAT, & dessert was OUTSTANDING! Everything was fresh & our server was very attentive. Thus far this is my favorite RR location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo
Pete F.,"Toledo, OH",1,22,,2.0,12/29/2015,Well...........we went for my Birthday and it was......ok. Best thing was the fries. My burger was a little dry and the wife said her Prime rib sandwich was medicore. Her salad was nasty and the onion rings were way to greasy. My son got his usual plain cheeseburger. When he got his burger it didn't have cheese on it. She took it back and they threw a cold piece of cheese on a burger that was already cooked.......surprise! Not melted! His favorite was the milkshake. I guess I will stick to 5 guys.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo
Matt M.,"Toledo, OH",28,5,,1.0,8/15/2015,"Horrible, horrible service. Three different visits, three instances of mixed up orders, inattentive staff and slow service. Will never step in this restaurant again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo
Mark P.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,18,10,5.0,4/24/2015,The grilled turkey burger gets me every time. Sooooo good.  Love red robin. The restaurant is clean.  The server was friendly. The food was hot and great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo
Robin M.,"Fayette, OH",11,6,3,5.0,3/30/2016,"Well just ate at red robins for the 2nd time. Our experience was the same as last time. Food was great and our server was Kenzie this time. Excellent service, our glass never went dry and she was very bubbly,great personality.

Paul G.,"Toledo, OH",0,22,2,2.0,7/6/2014,Food was adequately presented even though service was slow.  Hamburger was dry but no complaints about fish. The problem with this Toledo Red Robin is that the food is very mediocre. I only eat there when others insist.  I guess some people like the food but this is not for me. Ten dollars was taken off Neal by manager for slow service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo
Mike F.,"Miami, FL",0,58,6,4.0,5/27/2016,the burgers and steak fries were amazing. service was pretty good for how busy it was.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo
Faith C.,"Toledo, OH",64,296,422,4.0,11/15/2011,This is a good family restaurant where you can take the kids for a burger that isn't fast food.  I love that they offer bottomless steak fries and the burgers are delicious at a decent price. Complete your meal with a freckled lemonade- it's a bit pricey for lemonade but you get free refills! They now also have a Red Robin card where you can get a free burger on your birthday as well as other incentives!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo
Scott M.,"Van Wert, OH",20,63,1,4.0,5/9/2015,"Have eaten here several times, never had a problem.  Last time had an excellent salad with chicken and a good vinaigrette dressing.  Beer on draft is a little pricey but was great.  Service has always been prompt and pleasant.  Bottomless fries are awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo
Collin G.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",0,7,,2.0,2/16/2016,Red Robin is past its prime. The burgers use to be think and juicy. Now they feel like they came out of a freezer. The fries and burgers came to the table cold. There seems to be a ton of staff here but everyone is just milling around.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo
Long P.,"Toledo, OH",162,49,11,4.0,12/13/2012,Welcome to the Bird!  So much better than Burger Bar 419. The burger patty has a great amount of flavor that you can savor. I got the guacamole bacon burger. The bottomless steak fries are tastiy and you can add the seasoning salt to make it even better. They also have great ranch dressing to dip your fries (also try Campfire sauce). The only thing I was disappointed in was that my burger wasn't the temperature I would have liked to eat it at (a little colder; I did order it medium though..also maybe the guacamole and lettuce cooled it down...). I left feeling satisfied and the right amount of full (not bloated). Waitress was really nice too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo
Stella S.,"Toledo, OH",2,12,10,4.0,12/27/2014,"It's all about the bottomless fries, right? The burgers are a close second. Always great service, not a bad experience yet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo

Austin W.,"Valparaiso, IN",0,7,1,1.0,6/30/2014,"First off. Our server did the best she could. Secondly we went there and told them we had dairy allergies. When we got home all of us felt terrible. Our food was incorrect for half of our orders. And we had to send them back. Multiple times. Food was mediocre at best and in the end we regretted eating there. We also realized when we felt ill, that would mean that the allergy menu was inaccurate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo?start=20
Billy L.,"Monroe, MI",0,247,2,4.0,6/27/2012,I really like the turkey burger at Red Robin. It's got a good taste to it and it's a fairly decent size. The fries are a little meh. This store has a nice atmosphere to it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo?start=20
Thomas S.,"Toledo, OH",0,36,,2.0,7/12/2014,"Not on my list of favorites. Go there once a year, grandkids birthday choice. Never satisfied. Place makes me nervous somehow, acoustics are bad and it seems like a mad house, so much rushing around...can't seem to relax. Grandkids like it, they sing to them, that's all that matters, I can tolerate it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo?start=20
Hank's Dad R.,"Holland, OH",2,199,,3.0,3/31/2011,"This is a place that seems chaotic.  It's certainly noisy, we normally count how many birthdays get celebrated while we're there.   But they also seem to have a high turn over of staff.  But despite this, the place is always very well run.  i don't know if its their group of managers here or just corporate policies, but the place from when it opened has always functioned extremely well. It's not the best burger around, but it is good, reasonably priced, and a pleasant experience. It is distinctly better than the one at Fallen Timbers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo?start=20
Corynne H.,"Kokomo, IN",171,65,,5.0,4/22/2009,"I LOVE Red Robin! It is a little pricy, but it's great! Their unlimited steak fries are always fresh and hot, and really yummy! I always get the strawberry lemonade (it's amazing!) as well. The burgers are big as well, and they've always cooked the burgers to my order exactly. The wait staff is nice, and the environment is really fun. It's really colorful and exciting. It's a great family restaurant! Everytime I've gone, there's always been a line, but it's well worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo?start=20

Scott L.,"Perrysburg, OH",0,28,,4.0,5/7/2011,"If you just want a quick consistent burger, this is the place.  It can get quite busy on Friday and Saturday nights so plan wisely.  Try out the Whiskey River BBQ burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo?start=20
Akhom K.,"Toledo, OH",11,78,1,4.0,3/1/2007,"I still remember Opening Day here, there was a human-size red robin leading a congo line through the restaurant.  They don't have a huge menu, they are a burger place and that is the main thing they offer.  But I like the chicken tenders and french fries.  I especially like this place because they did the clap and made me stand up in front of everybody  else.  It might of been a little embarrassing but I learn to like attention and I got a free sundae. I like how they designed and decorated the place, even the ceiling fan is unique.  The bar looks artistic, but it isn't the type of place that I would like to drink.  I feel guilty when there are kids in the room. But it is a fun place, they have great color and energy, the drink refills get to the table quickly as does the food.  There usually isn't' a wait here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo?start=20
B G.,"Liberty Center, OH",24,106,,3.0,2/9/2009,"This is a burger place.  Sure they have a few other things, but when it comes down to it, they sell themselves as a burger joint.  In my book, if you are a burger place, and pride yourself on all your specialty burgers, and charge $10 for a burger, fries, and a drink, then you better make an AWESOME burger.   Unfortunately, they just make a good burger.  If I just want a good burger and fries (and I don't want fast food) I can do that for cheaper at a dozen diners in the area.  I just don't see anything special enough about the food or experience to warrant coming here again.  Don't get me wrong, I didn't have a bad meal (3-stars is ""A-OK"" according to Yelp), I just would rather go elsewhere for the same thing. Oh, and I guess they are well-known for their all-you-can-eat-fries.  This would be sweet (and props to them for the cool idea), but the fact remains that both times I went here I never ordered a second helping. The fries have that big, potato-y, not-crispy-enough, ""steak-fry"" thing going on, and I just can't gorge myself on those.   I mean, really, how many fries do you need?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo?start=20
Josh W.,"Ann Arbor, MI",112,253,12,4.0,1/2/2006,The hamburger place that is actually vegetarian friendly.  I love Red Robin because they offer both Boca burgers and Garden Burger patties! They offer an array of beautiful  greasy tasty gut bombs that will please any pallet.

Amy W.,"Ann Arbor, MI",13,222,,4.0,1/4/2006,"Believe it or not, sometimes a vegetarian wants a good burger (a good veggie burger, not a slab of ground cow). Red Robin is the place for a good veggie burger, you can get an original Boca burger or a garden burger, I prefer the garden burger. The blue ribbon burger with a garden burger patty is wonderful. You can also substitute a salad or steamed veggies for the fries. The steak fries are endless, but I am just not a fry girl. The onion ring tower and the spinach artichoke dip are yummy appetizers. The staff at this location are friendly and are always sure to double check that you got a veggie patty not a meat patty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo?start=20
