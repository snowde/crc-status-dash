Mary R.,"Baltimore, MD",31,162,,3.0,8/7/2017,"I came here to pick up an order last night. For some weird reason the bar tender is also the guy who gets your carry out order. Unfortunately for me, he had just started fulfilling a sizable drink order. I had to wait about 10 minutes for my order. I got an extra order of home fries in a cup and I wasn't sure if this was standard or to in some way compensate me for my time. Either way, it was all good. I had the Banzai salad which was good, thank goodness the dressing was on the side. My dinner companion had a burger and made yummy noises the whole time she ate. Red Robin Towson is A-OK and we will probably be back since it's in the 'hood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-towson

Kelly C.,"Baltimore, MD",52,7,12,3.0,11/14/2017,This was my first time at this location in over two years. The menu now includes more food option which is great. I was very disappointed that they were out of soft drink. Staff stated that it was due to Veterans Day celebration. Minus the lack of drink options my experience was overall pleasant.

Dee D.,"Baltimore, MD",83,256,292,4.0,11/7/2016,"I'm not a fan of Red Robin. It's more of a family oriented or kiddy kind of place in my opinion. Burgers are very basic. I don't want to sit in a burger restaurant and have basic. think if you only sell burgers they should be real handmade in the kitchen kind of burgers.  I ended up here after seeing the ad for the Billion Dollar Baby burger. Winner of the South Beach Wine and Food Festival for 2016.  Now more about this burger, angus beef on a roasted ciabatta bun, peppered bacon, fried potato cake,truffle flavored cheese blend, fontina cheese, mayo, shredded romaine and grilled tomatoes.  Sounds like burger heaven right? It was.  Service was decent. Bartender was attentive.  Margaritas are 5.50 all day.I like the machine that lets you pay your bill at your table. Which is a plus. Pretty convenient if you are in a hurry.  If I had to take my god children somewhere to eat. This would be it. If I needed to eat, this isn't it .I'm a foodie, if I visit a place like this.

Alenna D.,"Brooklyn, MD",0,7,,2.0,11/11/2017,"Guacamole burger looked like guacamole had maybe been smeered on the bun and then scraped back off. Then the waiter upcharged us on fries that he had said earlier came with the burger. I heard another waitress say something about veterans discounts, so I asked our waiter and he said yeah, but not on anything we had ordered. Would have been good to know earlier.

Tiffany D.,"Baltimore, MD",136,97,196,4.0,4/21/2017,"THIS REVIEW IS JUST FOR THE NEW SALMON BURGER ON THE MENU---- It is excellent, amazing, delicious, well-cooked, and something that I would never expect to enjoy from Red Robin. The cut of salmon was very generous, the flavor was on point, and the bottomless fries on the side added to the number. I typically don't care for burgers from here because the toppings are the only thing gourmet about them, but this salmon burger was gourmet all the way. My only advice is to hold the tempura lemon wheels as a topping. They were actually disgusting!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-towson
Jim H.,"Baltimore, MD",9,144,1,2.0,2/1/2017,"Why am I reviewing a sub-par burger chain? Because their 'gourmet' burgers are overpriced, poor quality crap.  And I hate being duped, and so should you.   We had their pepper bacon burger, which came out tepid. The quality of meat was poor as evidenced by the grainy filler texture, and the overly crisp, and THIN, barely-there 1  1/2 slices of bacon, were the grand insult for a burger that tops $13 bucks. Bottomless fries? Is that a draw for people?  How many fries can a person eat, anyway?  We had to wait around for 15 minutes to get more, and by that time we just wanted to leave to go eat somewhere good.   For a better burger experience all-round and for half the price, try Five Guys.  Their burgers are always fresh, HOT, and delicious! I won't bother to mention the hostess..oh wait maybe I will.  She was a surly thing, with more eyelash than personality...barely acknowledged us as we entered the restaurant, and definitely couldn't care less-you know the type-thinks she too good to be working at a sub-par burger joint....Well, maybe if she gets her meals there, then I can understand the attitude....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-towson

Shannon A.,"Middle River, MD",175,167,141,4.0,1/21/2017,"This location is a thousand times better than White Marsh. Though RR is not my personal favorite, my kids and niece always always request it when given a choice. The service was a lot quicker and friendlier, even though they were crowded and busy. The manager also checked in to make sure everything was okay. They also seem to have a team atmosphere where servers help each other with food and drinks when it's in the best interest of the customers. The bathrooms and restaurant were very clean. I couldn't give a five because the food isn't my favorite (for example our nachos were dripping with grease), but if I have to go to one this is the best Baltimore choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-towson
Robert H.,"Baltimore, MD",0,1,,1.0,12/9/2016,"I used to like this place but during our last family visit, I sat at that table for two hours watching while some of our orders came out in fits and dribbles.  We arrived at 7, and my brother-in-law left at 8:15 without having eaten.  The two side salads were the substitute-for-fries salads, and the person who ordered sweet potato fries didn't get them (which is normal).  Me and two others were still waiting for food when we decided to leave at 9:15.  A manager came to the table at one point, but seemed completely oblivious to there being a problem.  I contacted Red Robin customer service, but am still waiting for a reply, two-and-a-half weeks later.     This location looks like it's ready to close, and has lost my business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-towson

Asked for a bottle less root beer float but had to wait for the ice cream to freeze (waiter's exact words). Had to send plates back cause they were dirty. Server was polite though.

The servers are really friendly and offer great service but it's just not worth the MEH food and filthy place. The bathrooms were one of the worst i've ever seen anywhere, let alone a restaurant.

Donna T.,"Nottingham, MD",7,4,,1.0,2/20/2017,"I must admit that I've been to this location in the past and the White Marsh one as well and have had good experiences. Only wish I could say the same about today's visit. My friend and I arrived around 3pm for a late lunch. There were maybe 10 tables filled at any one time. My friend was craving their onion rings and was told they were sold out. Our server said Valentine's Day ""did them in."" I'm sorry but Valentines Day was 6 days ago. What, no food deliveries in 6 days? Not her fault but still unacceptable. I ordered a side salad and my friend chose the mozzarella sticks. She enjoyed hers. The salad was just meh. Typical side salad, however it arrived without dressing. Another person dumped it in front of me and abruptly turned on her heels to return to the kitchen. I had to call out to get her attention to please bring the salad dressing. After another 5 minutes, she returned. The waitress eventually returned to take the rest of our order. Our appetizer and salad plates were not removed until our meal arrived. My friend ordered pickles with her burger and when it was delivered was told they were out of pickles! My gosh, there's a grocery store located in the same shopping center for pete's sake! Again, not the server's fault. I ordered mayo on the side... guess what? You got it... not there. I had to ask and wait for another 5 minutes for it to arrive. The fries were cold, my friends burger was hot. Mine was barely warm after waiting for the mayo. The LT and onion were just sad. One small pic of lettuce, 2 VERY thin slices of tomato and literally 4 thin slices of red onion for the entire burger. I only ate half bc it was so salty and my friend said her was completely tasteless. The manager asked us how our meal was and when expressed our concerns he said we were really busy yesterday. I told him he should go to Weiss for some pickles, half joking. He replied I did but they went through them already. Mister go buy more or learn how to order your food.

C'mon its french fry heaven! I could stop my review here, but I guess I'll talk about the burgers too. I've never had anything other than a burger because if a place is known for its burgers im surely not going to order a salad! I've had the A1 Peppercorn, Royal Red Robin, Whiskey River BBQ, and Burnin Love. The latter was my favorite; with pepper jack cheese, chipotle aioli, and fried jalapenos its perfectly spicy.

Becky M.,"Reisterstown, MD",133,28,55,5.0,8/16/2014,"My husband and I went on a Saturday around 2p, so a little after the lunch rush. We were seated immediately in the bar section and greeted by our friendly server, Natty.  We had a decent sized booth for just the two of us, we got an appetizer, beer, and split a whiskey river BBQ salad. The appetizer, towering onion rings, is one of my a favorites. And we followed that up with the salad, split between the two of us. Perfect amount of food to fill us up. The onion rings came out very quick, they were hot and tasty!  Salad was delicious and I took the rest of mine home as leftovers. The place was clean, the food was delivered by two different people, both very friendly. And the hostess that sat us was friendly as well. The place is good for kids and groups ... I don't think they take reservations though - but if you have a large party, I would recommend calling ahead so they can get the tables together.  All time favorite is still the Whiskey River BBQ chicken burger, bottomless fries, with a side of (amazing) honey mustard poppyseed dressing. I've been to Red Robin in Owings Mills/Towson several times, and it's nice to see that over the years the food continues to come out exactly the same. Every now and then there are specials (I think there's a delicious burger that comes out around October) - but I can always count on the meal looking and tasting like it did the last time. The menus used to be a tall laminated thing, now they have rearranged and made the menu into a booklet. No difference to me.. as long as the pages aren't sticky.  Strawberry lemonade..... MUST try if you have a sweet tooth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-towson?start=20
Lily R.,"Bethesda, MD",144,135,360,2.0,12/3/2013,"Red Robin, Red Robin. You used to be amazing, so amazing. But these last few visits have been a grave disappointment. Every time it's like they've found a new trick to cut corners. The quantity of the spinach and artichoke dip appetizer has diminished noticeably at each visit it the last year or so, until my most recent visit where the portion was comically small, in a dish approximately the size of a large ramekin, and only filled halfway. It also tasted like the frozen dip you can get at the supermarket. Likewise, the burgers have shrunk. They try to trick you by using a large bun, but the quantity of meat is definitely less. They also give you less fries, and although they are still bottomless, they make sure to never ask if you want more. They must have some sort of policy like, don't remind the customers about the fries! so you have to actively seek out a server and request your extra fries, which makes you feel like maybe you shouldn't have more fries. I also ordered a salad there recently and it was way too small for a fairly expensive price. All the prices seem inflated for the food quantity.  They recently did some sort of image overhaul where they redid the menu and added a lot of options. The burgers are still delicious (whiskey river BBQ burger is the best!) But I think I can probably find a comparable restaurant where you don't feeling like you're being cheated. I think I'm done. Quit being so cheap, Red Robin.

Brittany B.,"Baltimore, MD",8,87,50,2.0,1/20/2015,"I've eaten here twice; the first time was fine. I got a patty melt that was good and everything went smoothly The second time we came was pretty awful. There was just a lot of literal garbage on and around our table (wrappers and crumbs and stuff like that) and we aren't usually a nitpicky group... It was just crazy how much garbage there was lol. Our server was terribly inattentive and didn't refill things even though there weren't really any other people in the restaurant. We think that the service was bad because we came in at a weird hour (like mid afternoon, probably around when the high school gets out) and maybe the servers don't give a damn around then because they are used to being shafted by kids? I dunno. My burger was small and gross, like falling apart and mushy, I forget exactly what I ordered but it had guacamole on it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-towson?start=20

My son's mini corn dogs were plump with hot dog and the tavern double was solid per usual.  The manager was quick to apologize for the plastic but the damage was done.

It was small and ultimately disappointing. As a burger establishment, I expected more from them.

Look, Red Robin, I know you make up your burgers ahead of time and keep them in warm water heated by heat lamps, but maybe turn up the temperature a tad?  Otherwise, good fries, and pretty chipper staff (half of whom are named Meghan or Jennifer).   It could be a little cleaner: Please Red Robin, learn to sweep under the table, wipe off the grease from the ketchup and pepper shakers as part of your cleaning up process! Lastly-and this seems to be on par with other ""family oriented"" restaurants these days-since parents do not know how to control their lovely children anymore, and babysitters are all starving for work, expect NOISE; the music and TVs are too loud, kids shout and scream to be heard and noticed, and I'm yelling at Meghan and Jennifer to request more fries!  ~Makes Five Guys seem like a Zen experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-towson?start=60

After that, we ordered a side of onion rings which I ended up canceling because it took to long. Mary, the manager came over with the onion rings and said the check was on her that night.

Personally, I always get guacamole bacon burger, but most of my friends are obsessed about the chili burger (get it if you're okay with eating your burger with a fork and a knife).

No, this isn't gourmet and the various styles of burgers are probably better classified as lots of sauce and lots of fats (you know that ""chain restaurant flavor"" usually most identifiable at Applebee's), but sometimes that's exactly why a burger is the perfect chain restaurant food.

Hannah O.,"Round Rock, TX",0,5,,3.0,9/4/2010,"Red Robin is the most vegetarian friendly chain restaurant I know of. A surprise I know for a burger joint. You can get every burger on their menu with a choice of two veggie patties, both boca and the garden burger variety. I tend to prefer the boca patty and go for choices like the whiskey river, blue ribbon, blackened bayou, and most recently the pub style.  Their beer selection has much to be desired, but a yummy treat is their freckled lemonade.  Its worth visiting their flash calorie counter when planning meals, since some of their burger/fry combos run upwards of 1500 calories. Ouch! I tend to go for a subbed wheat bun, a side salad instead of fries, and only eat half. One of the benefits of red robin is the extraordinarily fast service.  This seems to stay true for the chain around the country. You can be in, seated, fed, and checked out within 30 minutes.

I went to a Red Robin two almost three years ago in a another city, in a another state. After that horrible visit I promised I would NEVER visit another Red Robin again. I should've just stuck with that and Not went but after seeing the bottomless fries commercial over and over and over again I was now craving the fries! So I took my family. Our service started off HORRIBLE, It took us 5-10 minutes to get seated and the sad part is, they weren't that busy or understaffed and we were the only ones that walked in. After we were seated it took more than 20 minutes to have our server greet us and introduce her self to us! I wasn't happy about that our service started off horrible! That strawberry lemonade they have is disgusting and they should stop serving it but to each it's own! I ordered our appetizers and it took a minute for us to order them because the server kept walking past us and not tending to us at all to be honest! It was more so like ""oh I forgot I have those customers too"", We didn't order food when we were ready because again she kept walking past us like we were invisible, It's funny cause I'm always the one needed to be rushed and to make a decision and I had enough time to make a decision and decide EXACTLY what I wanted! That never happens..lol anyway We were never offered refills on drinks that were refillable but she made sure to tell us which drinks weren't refillable! Our food finally arrived and it was warm, Our appetizers here hotter than the food! No wait I take that back the spiciness of the buffalo sauce was hotter than our food and that's just disappointing,our fires were lukewarm. I was not impressed at all! it actually made me mad! At the end of it all we took two bites an packed everything up, My older children ate their tenders thank god and my youngest had a burnt dry burger! SMH!!!  It looKed as if none on the staff last night was over 25 and if they were they sure didn't act like it and they seems to be playing and chatting a lot! There was even a random guy over behind the counters in a red,blue and white hoodie I may be off about the colors but anyway he was over there chomping away at food and standing near ours! I was unsure if he was a worker that was off for the night or if he was a friend of a worker that was getting off soon but it was very unsanitary an awkward. I feel like i wasted so much money there last night. I barely are anything! I went home hungry.

When I get a burger, it looks nothing like the pictures I was fooled with, and the taste is never anything earth shattering. I'll just stick to 5 Guys for burgers intermixed with occasional late night runs for a double whopper with cheese @ BK. Now (again ironically) here is what I love about red Robin - their fish & chips is FABULOUS. Some of the best fish & chips I've found about town. I take the family to RR on occasion knowing I can always get my fish & chips and I'll be happy. I also just learned about the bottomless fries, and they have decent fries here ... we  just ask for more fries *immediately* after the server delivers our food, again after 5-10 minutes, whether we're ready for more or not, and again before we leave when I replenish along with half the fish & chips I saved for the journey home. Good way to squeeze out a little more value. Now as to why only 2 stars ... every time we come here, we are waiting 10-15 minutes on average while we are looking at a restaurant with 10-15 clean, open tables right in the middle of the place. If I owned this place, I'd be going  nuts thinking about the lost revenue while people turn and walk out because they can't seem to get seated at one of the dozen or more open tables ... and we've seen many people do this.

Eric C.,"Baltimore, MD",220,248,197,3.0,5/7/2011,"So...I had never been to Red Robin, ever.  Yes, I'm a good 7 years late on the notice.  I finally made my debut at Red Robin today. For a Saturday at noon, Red Robin was packed like a can of Bumble Bee Tuna stuck in vegetable oil.  Luckily for me, there was no one sitting at the bar, which I where I sat.  I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Burger which came with a side of golden steak fries.  The burger, while being edible, seemed to be lukewarm in temperature.  A couple of the previous reviews for Red Robin pretty much points out this same thing.  Nonetheless, I did my best to digest the burger. I did come away with a souvenir: a bottle of Red Robin seasoning which was $3.  I'll put that seasoning to use this summer with them burgers smoking on the grill.  Not a bad deal considering seasoning in the market can reach way more than $3. Not bad for my first time at Red Robin.  The restaurant, from previous observations, gets packed during the weekends so take notice.  Not a bad spot to come to in order to get a quick burger and some steak fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-towson?start=40

Joseph C.,"Baltimore, MD",94,282,47,3.0,8/29/2013,Red Robin is OK if you're out in the 'burbs and can't get to a good restaurant.  Decent food quality.  Above most chains I would say.  Nothing particularly special on the menu though.  Standard fare done fairly well.  Cheap.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-towson?start=40
Rachel F.,"Baltimore, MD",110,66,9,3.0,3/27/2011,"Ughhhhhhh. I. Am. So. Full. Which is to be expected when you go to dinner at a restaurant with bottomless steak fries. Once you get past the potatoes, Red Robin is a whole lotta burger. All types. All kinda. All good. Quick. Easy. Fast. Only a 3-starer for me though, because it was kind of a stressful dining experience, despite the friendly staff and quick food. It was packed! I'm talking line out the door, tons of kids, lots of noise, and people everywhere kind of packed. I went at 6:30 on a Sunday night, so maybe a lot of people had the same idea, but I have a feeling it's probably a pretty busy restaurant all the time. There aren't very many other restaurants in the area, so everyone seems to flock here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-towson?start=40
Crystal H.,"Fort Meade, MD",19,40,26,2.0,12/27/2013,"Really slow service, the restaurant was not busy. I got my beverage ten minutes after I got my food. I will not be visiting this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-towson?start=40
