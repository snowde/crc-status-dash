Eric S.,"Darby, PA",0,17,6,4.0,10/8/2017,Place lives up to the hype! Great tasting burgers and fries . The beer selection was pretty good as well. Good mid lunch hour spot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose
Ashley Y.,"Bensalem, PA",28,86,189,2.0,10/31/2017,"I was craving for a good burger last night and Red Robin was the first thing that came to mind. The hostess and waitress was nice and friendly. The food was just plain o..k, it was not what I remembered. The fries were a bit too hard and bland. The burger and toppings were good but the bun was too soggy. I think they changed the buns. It's squared buns and it's very soft. I had to take the buns out to finish the burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose
Veronica N.,"Philadelphia, PA",304,270,1479,4.0,4/5/2017,"When I'm craving a burger & fries, this is my go to place. Service is usually decent & friendly servers. The place is always clean.  I love that you can sign up for their rewards program & you can earn a free burger after 10 are purchased. They also give you a free burger for your birthday.  I love their ""wedgie"" burger it's 450 calories ( no fries )  but I get mine without bacon. My other go to splurge is the ""whiskey river"" burger. I always ask for the sweet potato fries it's a small up charge  but it's totally worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose
Cara B.,"San Diego, CA",397,138,424,4.0,4/25/2017,"I expected a mediocre lunch, but was happily surprised when I had a great lunch! I left feeling super full and totally satisfied. Not to mention the bill was ridiculously low. I had no idea Red Robin was so good and so cheap. Definitely going to frequent here when I am craving a burger.  Restaurant experience for fast food pricing. Thats a win! The wait staff was nice, I was in and out quickly, no complaints here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose
Natasha S.,"Philadelphia, PA",10,63,70,3.0,10/25/2017,"Took my daughter there for here birthday. She was more impressed than I.

Jo R.,"Philadelphia, PA",23,60,12,1.0,11/28/2017,"Went in around 2:30pm on a Sunday. A few people waiting to be seated. The hostess ignored me twice. After 5 minutes or so I'm able to give my name and told it'll be a half hr wait. So we decided to do take out instead. We waited at a booth near the bar and gave our order. Told it will be about twenty minutes for the food. 35 minutes later the food comes out in the togo bags. Do a quick look through, and the milkshake is missing. Find the waitress 5 minutes later and it takes another 5 for the milkshake...only to be brought out in a cup half full. Whatever, food is getting cold, we're hungry, let go home and eat. Get home, my pub mac and cheese is the exact same size as the child mac and cheese we ordered except with different cheese sauce at twice the price. The 3 burgers that were ordered came with a small amount of dry cold fries with no flavor. There was no campfire sauce with the order which was also requested. Our total was $52. Absolute waste of time and money. On top of that I emailed corporate two weeks ago with tracking # 00916925 with no response. Will never order take out/togo from this red robin ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose
Christine R.,"Norristown, PA",293,90,436,3.0,4/11/2017,"I went to dinner here with my boyfriend recently and everything was just average to me.  I got the black and bleu burger with sweet potato fries and my boyfriend got the BBQ chicken wrap and fries.  The place is sort of like an Applebee's feel.  My burger was pretty good, and I did like the fries but at about $15 it was just a bit much and prefer other burger places close by.  Our server was very fast and friendly.  I would possibly give this place another shot but wouldn't go out of my way to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose
Dana S.,"Philadelphia, PA",123,209,1614,3.0,1/21/2017,This place is hit or miss on the service and food. The last time I went the service was very slow but the drinks and food were good.

Marlyn V.,"Morrisville, PA",935,681,873,5.0,5/9/2016,"It is very hard to be a good chain restaurant, because you are almost set up for Yelp failure as soon as you open.  This is simply because it's almost like you're a sellout for not being a mom & pop place. Well, I am here to tell you, that for a chain, Red Robin as really won my vote despite all that.  Pros:  1. Reasonable prices for a full meal of burger and fries (around $10) 2. Bottomless Steak fries - uhh where else does this happen? 3. A variety of fun burgers and chicken sandwiches 4. Reasonably priced drinks 5. Short wait time during busy times Cons: 1. It's a chain. Ok, now with that out of the way, I just want to say that living in Bensalem, you can't avoid chain restaurants, and not the terrible kind either, considering in this same mall there is a Crackle Barrel and a Chik fila, which for a North Jersey girl - these are high commodities. As for Red Robin, we came to have a cheap and quick meal after spending $18 on a burger and fries in a local micro brewery - which was delicious, but just way too much for a meal that consisted of a burger and fries. So here are my three favorite burgers that will make you beleive you are NOT in a chain restaurant.  1. Bonzai Burger if you like something sweet and tangy. A little more on the adventurous side since it does have pineapple slices in it, but completely delicious and will make you wish you always put pineapple in your burgers.  2. Guacmole Burger - this is messy and delicious, and I am a bit bias, because you could put guacomole on roadkill and I would probably love it. 3. Chili Cheeseburger - this is my favorite burger, it is a disaster to eat - get utensils! The chili is very tasty and it is one hearty meal, so make sure you come in starved. As for sides, I'm not much of a steak fries girl, but with their fancy dipping sauces I am! I like the spicy ketchup and some fancy creamy bbq sauce one they have for free. But most of the time I go for the onion rings, because these are some of the BEST onion rings I've ever had. They are crispy and flavorful, I only wish these too were bottomless! Overall, I would definitely come back, they are also very family friend, they give balloons to the kids, they have milkshakes (and adult versions too) and the decor inside is actually  really cute.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose
Jerry E.,"Bensalem, PA",64,8,48,2.0,5/28/2017,2 and a half stars  service was great food was warm at best not hot like it came right off the grill but more like pre cooked burger and sweet potato fries first one came out cold second on a little hotter then the first one need to get cooks that care about the food,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose
Rebecca Y.,"Bensalem, PA",0,9,2,5.0,10/28/2017,My bacon cheeseburger was AWESOME. The fries were less than desirable. I passed my complaint on to Red Robin. Their response was fast. Their follow up was even better. They made sure that the location responsible heard the complaint and called me. The manager I spoke with could not have been nicer. His apology was sincere. He is sending me a Red Robin gift card to make up for the last meal. I will be ordering from Red Robin at horizon blvd in trevose again without a doubt.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose
Stephen B.,"Philadelphia, PA",181,419,1036,5.0,3/12/2016,Its been good awile since I've been to Red Robin. Desided to drop in again for dinner. It's been remodeled and looks alot nicer. I was seated in the area that has been added on. With nice comfortable seats.  I started off with a cup of chili. Was good with alittle spice to it.  I then for entree I got the feiry ghost double burger. Was good and really spicy. But that's the way I like most of my food. Back in the day it was always the 5 alarmer burger I got. As a place that are known for burgers they have many to choose from. And the burgers are packed well. And come out fresh as any burger should. The steak fries that come with it are also good. But recommend adding the the seasoning to the fries. that is at the table. Because the fries have not much sauce to them.  Looking forward to coming back in near future!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose
Annie H.,"Philadelphia, PA",14,22,39,3.0,2/3/2017,"This place is really a hit or miss. Some nights the food and service are decent and other times it's pretty lousy. I came there with family and friends recently and decided to try the Buzz Mac 'N' Cheese Tavern Double (although I made it a single since I didn't feel like eating a double patty), and it was surprisingly delicious. I'll come back again to try the other new burger options on their menu and update my review then. For now, 3 stars for the fickle food/service. 5 stars for that mac and cheese burger. :p",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose

Dan B.,"Langhorne, PA",116,101,23,3.0,7/17/2017,Red Robin is one of my favorite chain restaurants. With a chain restaurant you know it'll be limited but the burgers are very tasty and they've recently started serving a large variety of craft beers which is nice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose
Renee A.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,11,1,5.0,7/23/2017,Anytime is a good time for a burger and don't forget the stack of onion rings. The campfire sauce is AMAZING. Always have great food and great service. It tends to get busy later especially in Friday or Saturday so we go earlier to beat some of it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose
MsChristine H.,"Feasterville-Trevose, PA",13,28,2,3.0,5/25/2017,"Good burger choices and some nice chicken sandwiches too.  About the same as other Red Robin's I've been too.  They are all loud, but you can still have a conversation.  If you have kids it's a great place for them.  Especially the big eaters can have as many fries as they want.  That is always good.  Service can be slow at this place, but that's never really an issue for me.  We go here when we want burgers and fries.  Reasonable prices for everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose
Brooke G.,"Bensalem, PA",16,33,2,3.0,5/29/2017,"I would describe this location mediocre at best. The food was pretty overpriced in my opinion. My ""bottomless fries"" weren't even offered to be refilled at all. The table we were sat on was overcrowded with the digital pad, plates, and drinks. I felt pretty cluttered and a little too close to the table next to me. Pretty cramped space and just ok food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose
Sarah M.,"Bensalem, PA",0,17,,3.0,7/10/2017,"I've had super mixed experiences at this Red Robin. Sometimes the service is amazing and you feel like they're making it rain fry refills. Sometimes you feel like the red headed step child left in the corner to fend for yourself.  But like all Red Robin's, the food is good. I am a vegetarian and I'm super pleased that they offer both a Boca and a Garden burger option. I also like that they can customize any of the burgers (swap the bun, hold the mayo, add onion, etc.) Skip dessert and go elsewhere or just continue ordering endless fries until you burst.  Oh, and join their rewards program. They give you a free birthday burger and every so many meals you get a free burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose
George D.,"Asheville, NC",1,43,15,5.0,10/10/2016,Great place for burgers. Love the Banzai Burger! Bottomless steak fries are awesome too! Service and staff have always been great. Burgers and brews? A great combo!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose

Shane H.,"Columbus, OH",13,17,14,5.0,7/22/2015,"I had never been to a Red Robins until today.  It was fantastic. I had the down south burger ( or at least I think that is what it was called) either way it was delicious. Brown sugar bacon sweet honey bbq. I was in love!! The fries were good especially with the sweet Thai sauce. Mhmmm .  I've never been to a full service burger place and I was pleasantly surprised and impressed.  The service was great. Very good server she was super attentive and helped me so much when ordering.  She actually helped me pick out my burger; so the fact I loved it made it even better. It wasn't very busy at lunch but I think it's because it was more of a sit down deal. I was lucky to have an hour lunch :-) . They seemed to have a great selection of craft beers, however I was on lunch break. I don't think it would have been a good idea seeing I love craft beer. Anyways it was great. Definitely give it a shot. I think you will enjoy it. Very very impressed and I hope I come across another one again. I was only here for business so I'm definitely looking for more in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=40

Nancy P.,"New York, NY",364,583,233,2.0,6/21/2013,"So I've been to this location a few more times now.  Definitely do not go to this location with a large crowd of people (7 or more people).  They do not take reservations and even when they recommend you call ahead to let the servers know you are coming with a large party, it does absolutely nothing for you.  I still had to wait at least 45 mins after the time I notified them I would be coming in.  On my birthday, they gave us a choice..wait at least 45 mins or sit outside.  We had already been waiting 40 mins so we sat outside.  Why are there no heat lamps or anything outside?   The food was about the same here from the Oxford Valley one, so I am grateful of the consistency of their beef burgers.  Not a fan of those pretzels or the artichoke dip and hummus. They also can't seem to swipe the Red robin royalty cards at this location.  Very inconvenient.  Go to Oxford Valley; it's only about 15 min drive.  It saves you a lot of time and effort.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=40
Jamie C.,"Vancouver, Canada",23,60,138,4.0,12/2/2014,"I stopped in with a friend before catching a movie and we weren't disappointed.  We ordered the Royal Red Robin, a Avo-cobb-o salad, and drinks.   The waitress asked if we were splitting our meals and we told her we were, and both the salad and burger dishes were split nicely.  She even offered to bring us different salad dressings, which was nice of her.   The burger was nice and juicy. Although a little messy with the egg, it was delicious! I usually enjoy the Banzai Burger which is a bit more fun with the pineapple and teriyaki glaze, but the Royal Red Robin was really good if you like egg in your burger. The salad was fresh and had a good amount of ripe avocado chunks in it.  I don't usually get salads at restaurants, but I think I would order this again. We each ordered a beer and a long island iced tea, and the drink was actually quite strong.  We were pretty happy :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=40
Steve D.,"Warminster, PA",2,39,11,2.0,11/18/2014,"Nothing Special / Saturday Night 6:30pm Prime Dinner Time I have not been here in years and I figured I could get in relatively quickly with two of my children while we needed to wait in this neighborhood for a few hours. Front Door quoted 30 minutes and we only waited 16. They plug in your cell phone # and they put it in the system. You can check their waiting list and your party's progress. Very techie cool and efficient. No music could be heard in lobby. Had to walk through smokers to get in. Not enough wait area seating and the limited seating they had was blocked by some old merry go round horses and where I was standing was cluttered with a marketing stand.  Service. B+... She apologized over 10 times for our wait and her lack of getting to us and it wasn't too bad. She explained that they opened the room we were in recently and they were having trouble adjusting to the volume. Maybe they should extend the waiting area and remove some tables? That would work against the bottom line driven chain restaurant philosophy and actually improve guest experience. She was friendly but hurried. Mini computers on tables as seen in Applebees, Chilis, etc... Swipe your own credit card, order appetizers, play games for a fee... If it isn't bad enough most people these days have their faces buried in their phones now we are given more technology. Maybe we can replace servers all together? Stupid Food... Average at best with Above Average Prices. 1/2 O-Ring Tower $5 for six small onion rings. Over $1 per mini onion ring? Good sauces and hot but poor deal. Maybe my portion was not done correctly? Daughters onion soup. Decent My Burger... Had steak sauce, blue cheese, lettuce, tomatoes. For $11 it was mediocre. A gourmet burger you can' twit for your next bite. Not necessarily this one. It was good but ""good"" is not the expectation after reading the descriptions in the menu. $10 chicken fingers (Some other fancy name on menu). Definitely frozen product fried. Maybe 5 tenders. My son liked them but he is a simpleton and it is really the steak fries he liked. Bottomless Steak Fries... A+ they were hot and were fried with fresh oil. Had to ask for refill but they are a winner. Milk Shakes A+ I let them each get one, extra dollar you get a refill. We went with the classic. Took a long time since the bar was behind with their new restaurant size but very delicious. One was given to,us for free since it had a straw paper in the bottom of it? New room, we were packed in like cattle. Couldn't hear music. TV game ended and news came on. Not appropriate for dinner at a family restaurant. (Typical Philly News is murder, murder, weather, sports) $45 bill... 2 entrees and a soup. No alcohol and free shake.

Veronica K.,"Feasterville, PA",249,406,221,3.0,8/26/2012,"If anything is to the testament of how bored people become in southeast PA,  just look at how crowded this place gets. Really, people have nothing much else to do at night than go out and crowd every restaurant in the area, but for some reason, even week nights, this palce is packed to the gills.  Their food is good considering it is a chain. Usually I hate getting burgers at chains because they're often devoid of flavor, but their bacon guacamole burger is awesome. However, their bottomless fries are a joke. They bring out maybe ten fries tops in these baskets and then you have to ask repeatedly to have them refilled, and the second time they come with maybe five fries in them. Also, I substituted fries with my meal for black beans and was given the tinest container of black beans, barely enough to count as a side and more of just a garnish. Overall, it gets some stars for good main courses, but the atmosphere just isn't worth it most of the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=40

Assuming they were all ranked similar we chose our first time to the one closest to the theatre. Like most ""not so"" fast food places, we gave a name and waited. Within 6 minutes our table was ready. The beer selection lacked, the noise level was over the top, literally. It was chuckie cheese with   a good burger. Enter those bottomless fries, a nice twist for the burger side kick, however by the time we refilled, it was time to go. (Thank goodness). We chugged our beers, grabbed a box & left.

The walkie talkies, the weird tablets at the bar where you can play games while waiting (which cost $1 each too- no thanks), the goofy, overpriced drinks- I could go on... However, the burgers were surprisingly delicious. I had a burger with fried jalapenos, pepper jack cheese and a jalapeno cornbread kaiser, with sweet potato fries on the side.

I love me some steak fries! They were extremely packed for an afternoon, which is why the service was just average, but still the experience wasn't horrible. The kids menu is a great bargain for only $4.99, a burger, a side, and a drink, can't complain about that.

My boyfriends burger was ordered medium rare and it came out medium well, no pink! He ate it and don't complain because he was so hungry. Saw a puddle of water on the floor by a nearby table and watched multiple staff members look at it or step over it and not one person stopped to pick it up. Staff made no effort to clean up the floors around and in between new tables so the place just looked filthy. My dessert, doh nuts or whatever they call them, came out way too greasy and completely flavorless! To top it off, when our check came, there were 2 beers on there bar we did not have.

Anson S.,"Bensalem, PA",39,154,372,3.0,12/15/2015,"Burgers are pretty good. Bottomless fries, broccoli, sweet potato fries for the win! Service is alright. Our waitress is new and in training with Bobby, she was pretty nice and enthusiastic to be there, but more training is definitely in need. For appetizer, we had the $9 BBQ Wings and Chips. It was about 8 wings served on a platter of chips and fried onions. The sauce was on the sweet side and the wings were served hot and saucey. The burgers here are pretty good for around $10. They were filling, fresh, and creative. For the patties, I've noticed that lately, it's not as well-seasoned as it used to be so it was lacking some flavor for me. I ordered the guacamole burger only to find they forgot to give me any guac! It wasn't my best meal there, but my family had a great meal with their Chophouse, Royal, and Whiskey River burgers.  The bottomless fries were awesome, but our waitress in training was so hard to track down for refills and she forgot about six things during our meal (forgetting water, forgetting broccoli refill, forgetting check, forgetting water, forgetting knives, forgetting fries refill).  I think I would go again but probably not for a while since the food didn't taste as good and we had a somewhat annoyed experience with the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=20

Ty M.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,41,,4.0,10/16/2016,I was finally able to dine at Red Robin after being turned away by crowds and long waits during several attempts. It was well worth the wait and definitely lived up to the hype. The food was decent especially the burgers. They are creative in the toppings they add to their sandwiches and give you a bonus with the bottomless fries. It was also a plus to be able to watch Sunday NFL games while there.

Heather R.,"Philadelphia, PA",25,65,16,5.0,9/30/2015,"I'm pretty surprised there's only a 3.5 star rating! I've been to several Red Robin locations over the years and have experienced consistently great food and service. The Neshaminy location is my go to for sure. I've tried most burgers and chicken sandwiches on the menu and they are ALL delicious. No exaggeration. They cook the food perfectly, the fries and dipping sauces are great, and the onion rings are incredible. My favorite is the Royal burger but I switch it up pretty often. The service at this location always stands out. The servers are seriously on top of their tables and the manager always stops by. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. I absolutely love the freckled lemonade and margaritas as well.  I'm also impressed at how clean it is--including the bathroom--for a chain restaurant in such a busy area. The prices are fair and the fries are bottomless! I don't think I will ever get tired of Red Robin. It's great getting a free meal and ice cream every birthday too! Just sign up for the free royalty club card. My husband is a HUGE fan of the Ragin' Cajun Chicken Sandwich--a crispy hunk of chicken drenched in buffalo sauce with pepper jack cheese.

Courtney H.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,18,,3.0,7/31/2017,"My husband and my son love burgers. My diet is 99% vegetarian (occasional fish). I read that Red Robin had the best veggie burger, so we decided to check it out. I was expecting a fast food counter situation, and was surprised to find it was really a sit-down place. We loved the atmosphere. We loved the variety of the kid's menu, including the healthy sides. The menu was awesome. There were a lot of different burger choices for my husband. I appreciated that I had the choice between a Boca Burger and a Gardenburger. I HATE Boca Burgers, but it's a nice option for those who are Vegan. I had the Gardenburger, and it was great, because I love Gardenburgers. So, that was a win. My husband loved his burger as well. The bottomless fries were mediocre at best, but everything was so filling that there really wasn't any need to ask for another helping. The staff was friendly. There were tablets on the table which let you play games, pay your bill or examine the items on the menu, and my husband accidentally opened an app which added a charge to our bill. We asked three times to have the charge removed, as we didn't use the app, and we were reassured that it had been. It never was. I also was shocked by our final total, and felt like it was a little overpriced. Overall, I think I would go back there again for a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=20

Pros: This goes in the ""best fried food category"".  I'm not big on frying but they do it right. Not greasy and everything came out hot! We had the onion ring appetizer and the jalapeño and zucchini app.  Of course we had to try the burgers so we had bacon cheeseburger and the traditional cheeseburger.  There are so many options!  Cons: The brownie sticks are not as described.  They are FROZEN!  Not the soft warm brownie you'd expect.

Then the server came over and just asked us if we were ready. I ordered a medium burger and my friend ordered a well done burger both orders were completely different orders and our burgers came out with the opposite temperatures. My friend also asked for no sauce on his and got the sauce. It also took over 10 minutes each time we asked for refills on our bottomless fries.

Brian C.,"Chalfont, PA",169,221,100,2.0,10/22/2015,"I have been a longtime supporter and fan of Red Robin, jeesh, going back almost 20 years!  I almost always get the Whiskey River BBQ burger and love it every time, but this time around, I was left underwhelmed and confused.   We came in on a Friday night and despite the long line, were seated right away at a hightop table in the bar.  Server came by fairly soon and took our drink orders and then we ordered food.  I went for the promo burger, this Ghost Pepper sauce with pepper jack, fresh jalapeños and fried jalapeños.  I asked the server if she tried it and if it was ""super hot"" and she said it did have a bite that lingered but it wasn't unbearable.  So I went for it and asked for my burger to be cooked medium. I'll be honest, I have a long history of eating spicy foods and have a pretty decent tolerance.  I have former experience with ghost peppers and had my butt kicked several times by them.  This burger...was embarrassingly not hot at all.  I mean with all the peppers they jammed on it, I never broke a sweat.  Lacked flavor too and the burger tasted like a Burger King Patty.  The famous bottomless steak fries were a shadow of what they used to be...soggy, limp and a very small portion.   I guess they are in the midst of rebuilding their identity and menu but I think they took a step backwards, or even sideways because it's nothing like it used to be.  I was really bummed because of how much I love this place.  Maybe it was an off night, maybe not.  I'd say I'll give it another go but this was not the RR I was used to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=20
Gerald S.,"Newtown, PA",1012,2191,6425,4.0,5/25/2013,"I stop in on occasion when in the area and feeling the ""burger lust"" hit me.  Red Robin offers a cool semi-roadhouse environment and sliders on the high side of the scale.  My preference was the Onion Burger with sauteed onions, red onion and onion roll for the bun.  Not sure it is still on the menu, but the First Bite Experience was so very pleasurable. Endless French Fries are also a plus for the hungry.  I know there are other things on the menu, but I have never gotten beyond the ground beef disks, fries or rings.  It compares well with Cheeburger Cheeburger, although it may lack a little something side by side with a 5 Guys.  As Grease Palaces go, Red Robin is a solid alternative, and scores well on the comfort scale and as a family activity destination. 08.12.13 - Returned after a movie at Neshaminy AMC. Same roadhouse atmosphere and friendly service. The special Berzerker Burger was nicely spicy and medium pink. Son was way happy with his basic Bacon Cheeseburger.  His thing is to put the fries inside the bun, and he relishes that first bite confirming his sound judgment. We split a Van Shake. It was pretty good, but not at the level of Nifty Fifty, or Chick Fil A.  Still a 4 Star experience.

Kathleen M.,"Philadelphia, PA",26,90,65,3.0,6/17/2016,"Since I started dating my boyfriend in March, we have been here 3 times. The first time we were here, the service was really good. The waitress was very friendly (we are still trying to figure if she remembered My bf, they went to school together). The 2nd time we went here it was somewhat busy but they ask you for your cellphone number and it sends you a message when your table is available. They asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar area (if not we would wait a bit longer). The only problem with a bar area is that people are louder in that area. It was hard to hear and i was slightly grouchy that evening. The food again was really good. During these two visits, I ordered the strawberry freckled lemonade to drink. They were really delicious. The waiters/waitresses were very l, they always brought more when you were nearly down to the bottom. The second time there, we ordered the onions rings. They were greasy (not in a bad way). The third time we were here, I tried the Mint Brownie Shake (i even shared it with my boyfriend). The shake cannot beat nifty fifties shakes but it was different. Out of the three visits, I ordered two different burgers: the Whiskey River BBQ burger and the bleu ribbon burger. The best part about the Whiskey River BBQ burger was the sauce, it wasn't too sweet. The best part about the bleu ribbon burger was the chipotle aioli.  Reason for 4 out 5 stars: the third time we went, we were out in the back area with 3 other tables. One had about 7-8 people and the other two tables had 2-3 people. Once seated, it took between 5-10 minutes before they acknowledged us. I watched the same three servers walking by us. Also the chair that I almost sat on was wet. I switched the chair because I definitely did not want my dress to get wet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=20

This due to my wonderful waitress who, for some reason, can't recall her name at the moment. I am not a big burger person but my boyfriend is which is why I came. It was my first time and my server answered all my questions. I got chips with salsa and guac because I was sold on it by my server. The salsa was your average salsa but the guac had a kick of lime which I love so I wish there was more of that. They gave it to you in little plastic condiment cups so I guess it makes sense for the price but I wished there was a bigger size option. The burgers are good. I have the prime chophouse and my BF got the big fiery ghost style tavern  burger. This one was pretty spicy but still enjoyable. The burgers didn't look too big at first but after half way, I got pretty full. It might be because I stuffed myself with the unlimited steak fries.

Jack C.,"Philadelphia, PA",7,25,,4.0,10/17/2015,"Had a gift card to use so I came down here on a Saturday Night, got some burgers to go and it was a pleasant experience. It was packed when I got there. In order to take out you have to go up to the end of the bar area and make your way around a mob full of people waiting to be seated (some impatiently), the overworked servers, and people that are seated in the bar area. A woman took my order (I'm assuming she was the manager at that moment) and let me know she would call my cell when my food was ready. I waited outside to get fresh air rather than stand around in that packed waiting area. I came in a little early and got the women's attention as she was calling my cell to where I could say, ""Hey, I'm waving at you!"" as she was on the phone with me. She and the servers got a laugh anyway, and my order went smoothly from there. I got a Bacon Cheeseburger for my dad which he loved, and I got a Whiskey River BBQ Burger and a Banzai Burger. The Whiskey BBQ was great as the BBQ Sauce, Onion Straws, Cheddar, and Mayo flavors all went very well together. The Banzai Burger was more average. The pineapple slices did not mix well with the tomato slice as far as flavor goes in my opinion. They kind of offset each other when eating together, because in order to get the sweetness of the pineapple slices you have to bite into the very middle of them to get the juices out of it. And by the time they come out you really can't taste the sweetness of it at all. I was better off just taking the pineapple slices off and eating them separate from the burger. The Steak Fries that come with the burgers were very good. The food was cooked perfectly and the servers/manager were nice so can't complain about that. 4 stars for this experience because getting to pick up is a bit of a hassle on Saturday Nights (certainly not their fault as things would have been much smoother on an off night I'm sure) and the Banzai Burger as I said is average. The service itself was great though as were the Whiskey River BBQ and Bacon Cheeseburgers so me and my dad are fans. I will be coming back to try different burgers next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=60

Sahil J.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,,2.0,2/21/2016,"This was my third and maybe last visit to this place within a year and how about if I just give everyone a overview of the first two times and a summary of the third. First visit: Sat in the bar area, mediocre service from the sever but wasn't bad. But exceptional service from the bartender who is still the same guy still. Burgers were great! Second visit: Sat in the second(middle) dining area. Food was great again and I was able to customize the heck out of one of their signature burger. Our server was great but we did have our first bad experience during that visit where we had to TWICE ask one of the guys who was cleaning around us to stop sweeping the carpet while we were having our dinner. He acknowledged our concern and moved about a foot away and continued doing it. So that left a sour taste in my mouth. Third visit:(tbl 51)Upon entering the restaurant we can see that is was pretty busy and it was around 9:20 in the evening on a Saturday so that was expected. We walked up to the greeter and were greeted and this is when it all went South. Our host who was standing right behind our greeter. He went to grab a couple of menus for us when he accidentally knocked a few them down to the ground and proceeded to kick them under the table while the greeter in a very playful manner kept yelling at him to stop. He did not listen and continued doing it and then turned to us and said ""You can follow me"". Then we walked about five steps and for some reason he went back to the greeter and started chatting and fooling around with her again. At this point we were very confused and a bit aggravated because we were just standing in the middle of the walkway with no one leading us to a table. Then my partner said ""are we suppose to seat ourself"" when a few seconds later he ran up in front of us again like nothing ever happened and looked around the dining area and stated ""everything looks full, where would you guys like to sit?"". We had no idea what to tell him so I pointed to the only open table and said ""I guess that one right there is fine"". He sat us there, gave us our menus and wished us a good meal and left. About 8 minutes after we were seated, our server walked up to us, very pleasantly introduced herself as ""Angela"" to us and offered us drinks. Upon questioning her about any specials, she stated ""we don't really have any specials, but we do have some special beers which are listed in the front near the bar"". At this point we were already a bit annoyed so we asked her to come back in a couple of minutes while we looked through our menus and also picked a drink. Then she came back and we ordered a 22oz Yuengling Lager and a Blue Moon. Then she had to leave and come back twice because we weren't ready with our orders yet. Before walking away the second time she instructed us to push the ""CALL SERVER"" button on the remote ordering pad when we are ready and she'll come right over. Within about 5 minutes of her leaving we pushed that button and waited for her to come take our orders. About 10 minutes later another server came over and disappointedly asked if somebody had taken our orders and we told her no and that we were waiting on our server after pushing the button. As she completed our orders, Angela reproached our table and said ""sorry about that guys, your food will be up shortly"". We waited another 20 minutes roughly and our food came out. Upon inspection of the burgers, they looked well made but were not ""right off the grill hot"". Mine was ordered to be cooked ""medium"" and my partner's was ordered to be cooked ""well"". They both were about the same temperature to touch and the fries seemed to have had been sitting for a bit also. While indulging in our meals, we had all kinds of unprofessional and distracting playfulness happening all around us. Granted that our table was right by the kitchen, so we probably saw and heard more than we needed to. When Angela came back to our table and asked if we wanted another round of beers, we told her no but maybe later. Then we asked her for a box to put our leftovers in that was pretty much the last time we saw her before we asked her for our check about 25 minutes later. Between that we did want to place an order for dessert but again couldn't locate her for a bit but luckily a manager by the name of Justin was standing right by our table and overheard us talking about ordering dessert. He approached and asked if he could help us with anything and we told him that we just wanted to order dessert and couldn't find our server.He proceeded to tap on the kiosk on the corner of the table and without showing me and having me do it it myself he just placed the order of the Gooey chocolate brownie cake with ice cream and berry sauce. At this point I don't know if you guys think I'm being petty but his way of helping me made me feel foolish. I didn't place the order myself because I had no idea, I was able to order it without berry sauce.It was all very childish & poorly managed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=60
Adam E.,"Bensalem, PA",3,16,,1.0,9/24/2015,"Went to this location on a whim with my boyfriend for a date that we barely had time for. I had been here about 2 weeks prior and I was in love with the bottomless fries but when the waitresses came she didn't mention them at all. So when she came back I asked about them and she said they come with any burgers we order and we got the short onion ring tower. Then she comes 10 minutes later with the rings and i ask her again and she finally says oh you can get them before your meal. So I'm like... ""ok yes please that's what I wanted 25mins ago."" After 10 more minutes she brings them and takes our orders. My boyfriend got the guac burger and I got the nacho crunch. The wait for the food wasn't bad but another waitress brought our food out. She called my burger the fiery ghost and i thought about it for a second and remembered i ordered the nacho crunch. So i ask her what she said it was and i told her i ordered the nacho crunch and now that I think back to it she treated my like i was a complete idiot. ""Oh you know you're right it is the nacho crunch im sorry it's been a long day!"" So the burger was nacholess and my boyfriend could tell i was getting upset so he googled the menu for me to make sure nachos were supposed to be on it. And they are otherwise it's not a nacho crunch burger it's just a burger.... So i press the button on the little electronic menu to call the waiter and about 20 minutes go by and nothing so I get up to find one and these two waitresses are sitting in the booth looking at me like I'm crazy. Apparently the call server button just flashes on and off... Or so they told me. I tell them my issue and they send a different waiter to fix it and he seems familiar. Honestly he tried hitting on me before on a dating app so it was super awkward seeing him. He seemed a little grumpy too. At this point i had stuffed my face in bottomless fries, soda, and onion rings so i was stuffed and after he went to fix it i asked him to cancel it. I didnt feel bad at all either my boyfriend was already half way through his burger. Im surprised no one came out to apologize to me it's so unprofessional. I had had a great experience with my parents and it was ruined in one night. I'll never recommend this place to anyone in the future.

We get there and are promptly seated in the lounge area of the bar and our server was Ryan. Why oh why did I look at the menu when I knew what I was lusting for and craving? It's like when you want to have sex and in the meantime you pick up a good book... forget about it! So tell me Ryan, I am torn between the fried cod and shrimp combo or this fabulous looking french dip... baby it's cold outside. He says oh go with the french dip. Okay I trust you Ryan!  Hubby looked at the menu too, damn us anyway! He asked, so how are your fried clams? Ryan said you get a huge basket of tender fried clams and they are very good!  I can not go to Red Robin without having the tempura fried zucchini spears, thick and topped with a ton of freshly shredded parmesan cheese. They serve it with ranch dressing, boring, so I quickly mix my sour cream, horseradish and mayo sauce at home and bring it along.  We already know the clam chowder is very thick, rich and holds tender clams and I had just made it at home last week, so I opted for the baked potato soup which was thick, cheddary and had bacon, celery and onions caressing the potatoes.  Hubby had the french onion soup and loved the rich beef broth it was in. He also loved their clams and so did I, hey Michael look over there, snitch a few trick, you know.  My french dip came on the most wonderful and flavorful toasted fresh baguette and rich Au jus. The shaved prime rib was well done, I would have preferred it medium at the least and it was topped with mozzarella cheese. I spooned a little of my horseradish sauce on it and walla, fantastico!  Endless steak fries and cole slaw came with both and we ask them to double fry the fries now and they were crunchy and good. Hold the seconds though, we're stuffed!  I need to go back soon for my fried cod and shrimp fix.... hold the menus please!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=60

Burgers are usually a bit overcooked, so don't expect to get a perfectly medium here. Well done is about all they do. Fries are probably the highlight here. They have those large ""Steak fries"" and they are usually pretty crispy. They come with little to no salt, so you can season it to taste. Soups are decent. Nothing that stands out from the crowd, but serviceable.  For a chain, it's above average.

In my book if your food comes in a red plastic basket its fast food,Something I strive to avoid. .We had a 20 min.wait for our table and were almost sitting in the tables on both side of ours lap.Too crowded Trying to salvage as many calories as possible, I went for the grilled chicken sandwich so I would still be able to enjoy 1 or 2 French fries or perhaps 6 would be more like it.  Ha ha. The chicken was on an interesting sounding bun, Jalapeno corn bread roll. We all had our sandwiches on what would prove to be a disappointment. Don't bother unless you like the texture of sandy grit.Alas  we couldn't taste any jalapeno just dry gritty roll. The chicken was sent back because one side was burnt to shoe leather. .I waited for my chicken and nibbled on  a few fries which were still fresh and taste the way I remembered. Good. The chicken came back to the table after everyone else was done and I gobbled it down to get on the road back to college.

There was no ketchup on the table... had to get it ourselves. We didn't know we could order appetizers from the device on our table... It would have been nice if she mentioned that to us when she first came over. When my onion rings came out I requested campfire sauce with the server who dropped off the food, who obviously was different from our waitress. I guess since there was no tip in it for her she blew me off and decided not to come back with the sauce. That would have been OK except for our waitress also went MIA. So now my onion rings are getting cold and no sauce. I finally had to physically get up and walk over to our waitress when she came to the table next to us and asked if they needed anything and proceeded to walk away in the opposite direction from our table. It was either that or wait another 30 minutes for her to meander back around. So yeah... that was pretty annoying.

It helps to get the sauce on the side so you can ease the calories. We have also come with relatives, and everyone young and old leaves happy. They are also vegetarian friendly, which is awesome. My husband and I  tried both the boca and gardenburger substitutes last weekend. The Boca definitely won for flavor, but neither left us feeling deprived of meat.

Kristin B.,"North Wales, PA",7,23,,3.0,9/30/2009,"This review isn't a review of Red Robin for the restaurant/franchise itself.  It has more to do with what I order there- a veggie burger with fried egg, tomato, and red onion, sub onion rings and a Bailey's milkshake.  Now this burger is not quite on par with the Burger Bar and the Counter restaurant, but as Burger Bar and the Counter are not around every corner this is attainable.  The veggie burger has the consistency of a real burger, a real plus.  Add a fried egg to it and it's heavenly.  If you haven't ever had a fried egg on a burger (any burger) you have to try it; I think of the pairing like peanut butter and jelly, or bread and butter. The other perk of Red Robin is the Bailey's milkshake.  A milkshake for grown-ups.  Fantastic.  I never go to Red Robin for dinner between 6- 9.  That's when all the children come out to play (and I like to avoid them).  I like to go for lunch through the week or for a late dinner.  Please go and try my burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=80
