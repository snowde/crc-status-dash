Amanda M.,"Chico, CA",0,28,20,3.0,1/10/2018,"Went on a Saturday mid day good amount of people. Food took a long time. My plate looked unappetizing. My fries were like thrown on plate and cold. And there was a piece of lettuce on my plate. My friends burger bun was super cold.  Plus I saw a waitress bring out someone's food and the bowl had lettuce all on the outside! Waitress asked how everything was and I said not good. She came back to inquiry why, told her we don't usually complain and let her know. We just got a refill on fries better this time. (Mind you they are unlimited fries) Nothing came of it so we paid and left! Sad, Red Robin is known for burgers and fries and yet they missed the mark here. And even worse establishment doesn't care for presentation or food.  I would give 2 stars but margarita drink was good. So 3!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3
Gilby G.,"Vacaville, CA",0,4,,4.0,11/13/2017,"Nice little place to grab a bite to eat. Like coming here for lunch. They offer gluten free buns which is huge for someone like me who has certain allergies to gluten. The place is a fair size, comfortable booths, friendly staff (sometimes they screw things up). Recommend the bacon cheeseburger for someone who wants to take it simple. They have a version of the standard Croque-Madame, one of their most famous burgers, that I also recommend.  Solid 4 stars, keep it up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3
John F.,"Vacaville, CA",62,72,10,1.0,11/11/2017,"I'm updating the rating from 5 stars to 1 star. For the past visits I had it good with Red Robin and would regularly eat here. I just Retired from the Chair Force and this is my first Veteran's Day. I regret eating here and here are the following reasons why: 1. Napkins, spoons and forks was not provided. My daughters have to use their hands and I have to get napkins from the restroom. 2. I ordered 3 Basket if fries including ranch. I asked 3 times but only got 1 basket and no ranch at all.  3. The side was incorrect and the quality of the food was different. For the positive, my waiter was over whelmed. He tried but it seems he had memory lapse which is understandable. I don't think I'll be eating here for awhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3
Shaneel R.,"Elk Grove, CA",4,506,664,4.0,1/13/2018,"Decided to stop here for dinner while driving through from Napa and it was good. Had the Siracha burger ( not at all spicy ) with the garlic fries ($1.29 extra ). Food was good and so was the service. Our server was Robby who was very attentive. Reason for 4 stars because the garlic fries did not at all have anywhere near enough garlic. It was site full of "" garlic oil "" but that's it. Waste of the extra money. Will not order that again for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3

Mmmm ...this location was okay, not busy at all and service was okay...friendly but almost awkward. Cousin wanted to order the onion ring tower and the waitress said 'you could've ordered it from this' (ordering system on table)....um okay but we might as well just order at the same time as our burger. And had you told us when we arrived we would have... Burgers, fries and onion rings were yummy but sauces were brought in tiny plastic take out containers as they didn't have ramekins...odd and sure is difficult to dip those onion rings in those tiny containers...oh well we adjust well and go with the flow but I can see someone complaining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3

Eva C.,"Tiburon, CA",45,172,567,4.0,12/7/2016,Love the Robin! Location was by the Vacaville outlets and we went around 2pm. It was very quiet and we were seated immediately by a very nice waitress. We ordered the cod fish fried sandwich and the whiskey river BBQ on a chibatta roll. We also ordered the onion rings. We were very pleased with the quality and quantity of food as well with the service. You receive bottomless fries with your orders and the onion rings were flavorful and crispy. This place is a strong 4+. Give them a shot - you shouldn't be disappointed. They have a large menu and I know from other locations in different states - their desserts and drinks are off the charts Good job.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3
Jaclyn B.,"Grass Valley, CA",72,3,,2.0,12/17/2017,"Super awkward and weird place.  There was a wait to sit down, even though there were a lot of open tables.  The hostess was a mumbler, the service was slow, and the food was just ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3
Brandon M.,"Fairfield, CA",69,95,18,2.0,8/14/2017,"I came in today around 3:30pm with my mother. She was in town from Oregon so I was treating her to dinner. The server was very patient with us as my mom took awhile to choose her meal. However, once we chose our meal we saw precious little of our server.  I initially ordered a coke and waited on my mom to order. The server came back and got my mom's drink order at which time I needed a refill which she tended to. Our meal arrived shortly thereafter. It was disturbing that our appetizer and main course arrived withing SECONDS of eachother. My coke was empty within 5-8 minutes of my meal arriving and I placed the glass at the edge of the table to indicate a refill. It went unfilled for over 10 minutes. Our bottomless fries were only refilled one time when the server happened to be walking by and ask if we wanted a refill and I had to point out my empty glass.  Once we reached a cessation of our meal the server came by. There was no offer of dessert or anything additional she was ready to check us out so we could leave. Grant it she helped me sign up for the rewards program and added a few points to my account once that was done I was left to pay my bill and there was no conclusion the waitress was done with us and we left. From here on I don't believe I'll ever dine in at this location but maybe just maybe order take out. I was extremely disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3
Gerardo F.,"Sacramento, CA",62,34,27,1.0,8/11/2017,"Came in on a weeknight around 8pm. Our waiter was very friendly, however, he was covering about 8 tables by himself.  The service was very slow. There was plenty of other staff around and a manager but he was getting no assistance.  The food arrived after a longer than acceptable wait and all of our fries were cold.  The waiter never came back to ask how the food was... I wish he had because my ciabatta bun was smashed and stale.  By the time he came back, I returned the burger and didn't ask for a replacement.  Then, of course, we had to wait another 10 minutes for the bill to arrive.  Then of, course, then printer on their little wireless checkout machine wasn't working.  Also, don't order alcohol here. They skimp on the liquor.  This definitely the least positive experience I've had at any Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3

Curtis F.,"Hollister, CA",3,7,,1.0,6/9/2017,"The waiter told us they didn't serve sweet tea, which one of us wanted. When he brought refills of tea, it was sweet tea, which the rest of us didn't want. One of the burger orders was wrong. He delivered a chicken sandwich and didn't offer to comp or replace it. Instead he commented that there was a lot of orders sitting, waiting to be delivered to customers and something must have been plated wrong. They are supposed to serve endless fries, but after our fries were eaten from our meals, the waiter was nowhere to be found. Also, the fries we were served were barely warm.

C.Z P.,"Vacaville, CA",3,29,25,2.0,10/23/2017,"We came here last night to grab burgers before a movie with our girls - it was about 5:20 and we had plenty of time before the movie started... We were hesitant to go here to be honest because the last few times have been uninspiring to say the least.  Even the food hasn't been that great. BUT we are always willing to give another try and go back for a 2nd, 3rd chance. We walked in and it seemed empty, maybe 4 people in the bar area, an empty small dining room to the right and only the center dining room to the left had diners.  We figured we would get right in.  However we did notice a couple of people waiting.  One gal finally asked us how many and as she scoured her ipad or whatever she said it could be about 15-20 minutes.  I was like ok, well there must more more business in the back that we can't see. As we were waiting I went to the restroom, which takes you through the bar and then I noticed just how empty and understaffed they were.  Also sadly the bathrooms were gross :( if you're that slow the bathrooms should be kept and I won't go into detail what was in the stalls. I walked back through the other side of the bar and looked into the dining room and was shocked there was a wait at all, there were empty tables and honestly not that many people to begin with.  My conclusion is they're highly understaffed because of traffic and what not.  Sadly when you understaff the experience will still be terrible.   We ended up waiting longer than 15 minutes so we sent our girls across the street to BJ's and they were packed but able to seat us immediately.  It's called adequately staffed.   Not sure we will ever go back here again :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3
Steve H.,"Vacaville, CA",0,17,2,1.0,10/13/2017,"Went here with extended family. After ordering fish and chips, waitress came back a few minutes later and said they were out. No problem. Ordered one of the specialty burgers. Our order ended up being placed about five minutes after the rest of the party. Order received after the rest of our party was done eating. Cold sweet potato fries. The burger left a bad taste in my mouth. As I was about to mention this to my wife, she turned to me and told me she had a nasty taste in her mouth. For some reason, the bacon on our burger seemed to have a slight taste of fish and onion. We ordered the burger without onion. We would have complained, but the waitress simply did not appear. We won't be back, nor will the two families that were with us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3
Brooke V.,"Winters, CA",67,7,1,1.0,3/23/2017,"Absolutely the worst service!!! Ashley was our waitress tonight and she was the worst.  1. She argued with us regarding how we ordered our burgers (pink,no pink) 2. She took 25 minutes to bring out the condiments after we got our food. 3. We asked for refill of fries and got them 45 minutes later 4. We NEVER got water we asked for 5. My son asked for a refill on his chocolate milk and was told there wasn't refills on milk. We ask the manager to show us where it says that...it didnt! Then we ask to speak to the manager and he comes and apologizes for the service and we think great that was nice. He offers to take off the kids meal and one simple burger. We were fine with that....Then he goes on to say he will take care of dessert if we all want to get something. The bill comes out and he didn't waive anything. We ask the waitress to call the manager again...he comes out and says I didn't tell you I would take care of milkshakes. I said I would take care of dessert. Milkshakes aren't a dessert they can be eaten with a burger. WTF? Daniel was the MID manager we were dealing with and Ashley was our waitress!!!!

Joanna G.,"Hercules, CA",27,15,2,5.0,8/19/2017,"It's hard to mess up a burger, so getting 5 stars falls on the service and the value for what we spent and what we ate.  I paid $5 for a delicious wedge salad and $6.99 for a double tavern cheeseburger with endless fries.

We had a new server and she was great, very attentive, while I do agree they have gotten a bit skimpy with their fries, at least they are bottomless. I imagine they are that way now because people have wasted so much food. All in all I was satisfied with the service and food, we were sat as soon as we walked in and greeted by our server in a timely manner, we had to wait for one person in our party and while we waited she brought our drinks and continued to check on us - so I decided to just go ahead and get some fries while we wait and she brought them in no time.

We left hungry, and seriously $40 for two very cold unedible meals? Never coming again. The server was really nice, but they need to hire ""chefs"" who know the difference between hot and cold.

Julie T.,"San Marcos, CA",149,408,760,5.0,10/5/2015,"I do not understand all the poor reviews for this Red Robin.  I came in today with the Hubs around noon. We were greeted cheerfully and seated promptly. Our waitress, Megan, was awesome. She was on top of our needs without being ""lurky or overbearing"". Our food was out to us fast, and everything tasted fresh and delicious. I've been to the Red Robin in Solano Town Center mall, and it was worse than terrible. So I don't get why several reviewers say it is so much better than the Vacaville location.  I will be returning to this Red Robin again soon, and offer! UPDATE: I was in again with the Hubs and the Wee One this past weekend (12-5-15). We sat in the middle of a very busy dining room at 12:30, and had the same great service and food as our first visit.

Aaron G.,"Vacaville, CA",0,2,2,1.0,10/10/2017,"I came here for the deal they have on some Tuesdays called ""Tavern Double Tuesday"". I ordered over the phone to go and the girl on the phone told me she hadn't heard of this deal. It's basically buying two entrees and two drinks and getting one of the entrees for free from the tavern burgers list. I told them I would like it cooked medium with pink and the burger I received was way over cooked and very dry with the cheese not even melted. I also had to order two drinks for the special, I ordered the strawberry lemonade without knowing I was going to pay $10 for two lemonades with rotten strawberries on the bottom. When I went to pick it up they took forever to even acknowledge why I was there and proceeded to bring out parts of my order at a time. Basically they are false advertising, understaffed and the cooks need to learn that burnt isn't medium but what do I know. The only thing that was semi ok was the simply grilled salad that they didn't even ask what dressing I wanted with it and assumed I would like ranch. Definitely not worth the $20 I spent even after taking the burger off the receipt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=20
Sandy M.,"Vallejo, CA",5,25,11,1.0,6/30/2017,"This review is on the workers at the restaurant and RED ROBIN Corporate office and not the food. The food was excellent. I ACCIDENTALLY forgot my eye glasses that were on the table. I know, how dare i forget my eyeglasses!! When i realized my error and called back to the restaurant the person on the phone described them to me right down to the brand name and the case!  ALRIGHT, my glasses are still there! I was in a car accident and couldn't go back for them for 2 weeks. When I called the 2nd time I was told my case was missing but my eyeglasses were there right down to the name brand that they were. Well, thats something I think to myself. I am told that my eyeglasses will be kept in the mangers office for safe keeping. Thank you very much I say. When I go pick them up, to my dismay I find out that my eyeglasses are completely gone! Sorry! I called up corporate that same hour and I talk to Daisy who calls the restaurant and gets the same story I told. She says she cant think of any else but they were taken and will escalate this matter.  Give it 48 hours and someone will call me. No surprise no one calls. I call up today and talk to DEB in the corporate office.  I am upset about this and NONE OF THE INFORMATION I have given prior to daisy is on the system, EXCEPT a case number. DEB starts asking me for all this information I really didn't have at my fingertips. She says she will wait while I go find it. I say I dont have it readily available and it will take some time to find.   She presses me on the information while asking me to keep my tone in check. I tell her I am upset that NONE of the prior information is in the system and I feel like I have been taken for a SECOND RIDE. I say I need to hang up as I am getting really mad. DEB keeps saying Im trying to help but your being uncooperative in a very condescending tone  and finally I say  I will call her back as her condescending tone was getting on my last nerve.  And she doesn't want to let me off the phone but will if it makes me happy. I hang up! I go to breathe and take a few minutes before calling back and she calls me first. She tells me she called the restaurant and talked to the manager COURTNEY who claims I never left my glasses there, ever! Then DEB says, Sandy can I give you a few gentle suggestions about your glasses because you've lost them and you never left them at our restaurant.  I insist yes I did leave them there and it was verified twice that I did. I recanted the day and events that happened while I there the day, the time, the drunk woman at the bar bothering people that the bar tender finally cut off, and her husband being upset with her and blah blah blah. DEB state saying Sandy you lost your glasses somewhere else. You never had them in our store.  Here are a few GENTLE SUGGESTIONS for remembering where you keep things.  I told DEB if she said that to me one more time I was hanging up because I did leave them there and they were confirmed there and I don't appreciate this crap and she started again with her gentle suggestions and I hung up on her. I have called a different corporate number and will hope that I get some satisfaction from that call. BTW, the cost of the glasses was $35.00! Over the counter Foster Grants tri focal glasses. This is about the principal of the situation now. Not the cost. Will I ever go back to a Red Robin again...I think not!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=20
Lori R.,"Trego, MT",1487,526,588,2.0,8/31/2015,"Our friends love to come here when they are in Vacaville so we decided on lunch here. It was noon on a Monday and it was pretty empty. We were promptly greeted and seated by a very friendly hostess.  Our server was by very quickly for our drink orders and to explain their kiosk appetizer ordering and check out functions.  We all decided on our meals and our order was taken. I ordered the bleu burger and my husband had the Royal burger and mine was made small size due to my small eating restrictions which was nice. All had the choice of onion rings, fries or sweet potato fries. We opted for fries with dipping sauce. Our friends had the classic burger and the bleu Niger too.  It did seem quite a long time for our order to come out but we weren't in any hurry.  My husbands burger had the sunny side up egg on it which was a miss, not runny as it should of been, yolk was hard. My burger didn't have any bleu cheese flavor at all which was really disappointing when that's the whole point of ordering a bleu burger. Fries were mediocre at best.

Roberta K.,"Vacaville, CA",2,19,5,2.0,8/2/2017,"I took my family out to eat on a Tuesday night at 8pm. Not a busy day in my opinion. The store had the two side dining areas cleaned and closed up with the chairs on the table. I understand pre closing so ok that's fine. In my head that means the store should be in pretty clean condition. It took a few min waiting till someone came up to seat us and the server came promptly. Justine S according to the receipt was friendly and nice. The kids were ""starving"" so I requested some of our fries ahead of time to appease them while the food cooked. I greatly appreciated that. The food wasn't anything special. My son loved his tavern burger but everything else wasn't anything well enough to give mention to. While taking my daughter to the restroom I was appalled by the state of the bathroom. Most of the stalls were out of things and the available toilet paper was just sitting around on whatever available surface. The toilet paper dispenser didn't even look like it could hold a roll. It was later in the evening and not busy so I'm not sure why the bathrooms were being ignored and in such condition.

The server Jacob was nice at first, then he got more tables. Waited 30 min for our order to be taken., so we politely asked for a manager. Over 10 minutes later, the ""manager"" took out order on what looked liked a scrap of paper. We asked for another server, as two tables that sat AFTER us left from being neglected and not having even an app. Tables that sat over an hour later (than my party) got apps, full meals and drinks. We were the 1st in his section. We were never checked on. Management never did anything and our food was COLD. My French dip was soggie. The burgers were hockey pucks, when we ordered rare. Plus...we got charged gratuity? We were 5 people. Not checked on. No service and ignored. Let's not forget that we asked for change of service!!!! I am appaled. It ruined two birthdays and an engagement announcement. What a waste of 200 dollars. Oh, did I mention the beer draft system was down?

Jana J.,"Cocoa, FL",0,56,1,1.0,10/8/2017,Red Robin is one of my favorite places to eat. I have only been disappointed one time before at a different RR. This will be my last trip to this Red Robin. Our food order was so messed up it was ridiculous. They put my daughters SIDE salad on top of her twirly pasta. It was not it a bowl but just leaves on top of the noodles. My burger and my husband's was completely wrong. My husband sent his back but I didn't because I do not return food. His 2nd burger was also wrong but he ate it. We all had extreme stomachaches after the dinner that evening. Never again.

Kristina D.,"American Canyon, CA",111,41,7,1.0,2/3/2017,"We go there on a Wednesday night hoping that it wouldn't be too busy.  We actually were planning on going to BJs but with their wait being 45 minutes, we opted for RR instead.  We are seated and our waitress (Jess i think her name was) asks us how we are.  We say fine and my father in law jokes that he's miserable (he always does that), to which she replies something about every American being miserable right now.  Nice political dig.  Pretty ballsy assuming our political leanings, not to mention inappropriate.  At any rate, we shrug it off.  After ordering our drinks, the waitress returns with them and we place our order.  Husband orders a chicken sandwich without lettuce tomato or mayo.  About 10 minutes later, waitress comes back to check on our drinks and brings refills.  She spills my whole glass of iced tea on my 7 year old, and then brings us towels for us to clean up the mess.  She doesn't even help to clean it up.  So we do, and the towels and wet kids menu laid on the table through the WHOLE MEAL.  She did not pick them up.  Our food comes and my husband's food has lettuce, tomatoes and mayo on it.  He brings it to their attention and a short time she comes back stating that the food runner just grabbed the wrong one.  The scraped off mayo that remained on the plate indicated that it was the same order.  Whatever.  The food was good and then she presents us with the bill.  We tell her that we'll pay by one credit card and then she proceeds to show us how to process it ourselves on the tabletop machine.  Too much hassle for her to go run it apparently.  Husband reviewed the bill, pays it and we leave.  We  expected some type of discount for spilling a whole drink on our kid, maybe the spilled drink comped, maybe the kid's meal?  Nope, full price.  What makes it worse is that my 7 year old thinks it's his fault, saying ""sorry mom, I should've packed extra clothes"".   So to recap, here are the reasons I gave one star: 1.  Insulting political commentary 2.  spilled drink with barely an apology 3.  Made US clean up spill 4.  Did not remove towels from table 5.  Food order incorrect 6.  Same food order with scraped off items 7.  Made us process our own payment 8.  No comped drink for spill Sorry Red Robin, this was a complete fail on multiple levels.  We will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=40

We only ordered a kids meal and a grilled cheese sandwich for myself and during this time the waitress never checked on us while we were waiting. When she brought our food my six-year-old daughter said ""why did she only bring me eight french fries?"" My plate also only had about six or seven french fries on it, however, when I looked at the table next to me, the waitress had brought out baskets of fries for them as well as for the table across from us. I asked for more french fries and the waitress took so long to bring them that we finished our entire meals and as soon as we finished, she brought out one little basket of fries. I have heard many negative views of this location and how they treat minorities and I hate to believe something like that but after the service that I received on that day and the fact that this is the second time that I have had poor service like this at this location, I am beginning to believe what people are saying about their staff and how they treat minorities is true.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=40

Bill R.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",63,217,1726,3.0,2/12/2016,"Deschutes, Lagunitas, and Racer 5 all on tap. We're off to a great start. This was a Friday night around 6pm. Not busy at all and ample bar seating available. Atmosphere is everything to me and the first thing I notice is all the overhead bar lighting was off. Asked about it and told a circuit blew. Second thing I noticed was how frigid cold it was?! Really? Had to stay bundled up the whole time. Asked to warm it up, but couldn't really tell. The one bonus about this place? NO KIDS PERMITTED IN THE BAR AREA! Thank you.  Since this was more of a appetizer and cocktails visit we started with pretzel bites and the mini tower onion rings. These were both fantastic; although the dippers that accompanied them could use a little work. Ranch dressing in a plastic cup just isn't winning me over.  We ordered the fish and chips entrée to share. The kitchen staff was kind enough to split and plate it separately for us. It was actually executed quite well. We opted for the free refill on fries as they were delish and also bottomless.  Mini towering doh rings. Again, the dough rings were perfect but the dippers need some work. They have a very pre made and artificial taste as though they came from a can or jar.  Surrounded by nice high def televisions at the bar.  Need a better variety of sports on the screens. I saw 6 around the bar all playing basketball (the same channel) at a time when NHL is mid season with tons of games and the PGA is in Pebble Beach. Get some variety up there please. It's been about a year since our last disappointment and things are noticeably  better. Staff was very friendly and food was better prepared.

Darrell P.,"Dana Point, CA",954,823,15212,3.0,11/2/2014,"""Dread Robin"" - Robbin' & steal'n... I'm a big fan of Red Robins, the service here was great BUT the food & drinks were not up to the usual Red Robin standard. I've been to a number of Red Robins & never left feeling disappointed, everything was on point but here, the food/drinks were ""Hit & miss.""  As we walked in, Nicole, the hostess, greeted all of us and seated us promptly. She was very friendly & courteous. Our server, Veronica was equally helpful as well. Its been a while since I've eaten @ Red Robins and I was really looking forward to finally getting a chance to check out this one in town... The 3 Star Rating was a bit surprising but I was going to give it a try anyway. (Huh, what'daya know?... Verdict: 3 Stars) 'And after browsing other Red Robin locations & yelp*views, a pattern can be seen, it appears that Red Robin Gourmet Burgers has become quite comfortable with ""average."" When I used to frequent RR more often in Orange County, a solid 4 Star rating, no doubt... Now, it seems that things are amiss. I expected better, consistent preparation of the food & drinks... 'The best thing we had on this day was the service. Overall, it was ""Okay."" The Fireball Peach Smash sounded great! Menu description: ""A delicious explosion of FIREBALL Cinnamon Whisky, peach purée, lemon wedges, fresh mint, and fresh, house-made sweet & sour."" ($6.49)  Photo -  Unfortunately, the description sounded better than it actually was. I ordered a double but the drink tasted as is it was a single served in a glass twice the size. Fail. (I'm sure this is a great drink if it was properly made.) Now, the virgin margarita ordered in our group was a sure winner! After all, how do you mess up a drink that consists of margarita mix & blended ice?... (Insert buzzer sound here) WTH?! Congratulations Red Robin's bartender, you somehow found a way! The drink was weak, needed more mix... 'Watered down. (A lot like my Peach Smash.) Fail, again. EL ordered the Guacamole Bacon Burger - Menu description: ""Guac, bacon, Swiss, tomatoes, lettuce, onion and mayo. No wonder you'll be grinning after the first bite""  ($10.49) I had the Burnin' Love - Menu description: ""Topped with fried jalapeño coins, salsa, Pepper-Jack, lettuce, tomatoes and chipotle aioli on a jalapeño cornmeal kaiser roll. It's love at first bite."" ($10.49) JK ordered the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger - Menu description: ""The one that made us famous. Featuring Red's pickle relish, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, pickles, mayo and choice of cheese."" ($8.99) The Guacamole Bacon Burger was tasty but a thin spread of guacamole does not make a ""Guac Burger."" So, you drop a dollop of guacamole & on a patty and call it a Guacamole Bacon Burger? FAIL, numero tres.  ""Where's the guac?!"" -    The Burnin' Love Burger did not disappoint, it had a bit of heat but I was hoping for more of a kick. The burger was perfectly cooked, med-rare w/good flavor. The Burnin' Love comes with a deep fried, whole jalapeño on the side, and the heat the burger was lacking was made up here... 'All in one bite. 'HOT DAMN! ""Yep, that did it!... Houston, we have ignition!!""Ahhhhh!..."" It's about time I eat something that's so-called, spicy, that's actually ""SPICY!"" I thoroughly enjoyed the Burnin' Love that was recommended by our server, Veronica. (Nicely done.) Photo -  The report that I received on the Red Robin Gourmet Burger was a big thumbs up.  The ""Bottomess Fries,"" cooked perfectlyt!... But when the pomme frites are buried in salt, to the point you're dusting them off, junk. Fail, numbre quatre. What are they seasoning the fries with, a shovel? Fireball Peach Smash (Double): ""M'eh; weak; waste $ Coke Virgin Margarita: ""M'eh""; weak; needed more margarita mix Guacamole Bacon Burger: Okay; good burger; BUT ""Where's the guac'?!"" Burnin' Love: Good; a bit of heat; awesome deep fried jalapeño  Red Robin Gourmet Burger: Good Steak Fries (Bottomeless): Fair portions; too salty Garlic Fries: Fair portions; too salty; NOT garlic bits, rather garlic seasoning Grand Total (+ Tip): $67 Red Robin used to have a slight edge to its rivals especially since the price point is a bit higher but after my recent visit, it's merely become ""One of the boys."" The ""Hit & miss"" items ranging from the weak, $12 ""Double"" Fireball Peach Slam, a diluted virgin margarita, the ""Guacamole Burger Spread,"" to the salt sticks, (i.e. - Fries), just left an overall, somber feeling of WTF?! You can get a good burger at In & Out or Carl's just down the street... 'And not pay $11 for it. (Sigh) 'Too bad, ""D'read."" - Aloha!

Michelle L.,"Sacramento, CA",795,718,4413,3.0,6/5/2015,"Caught Game 1 of the NBA Finals at Red Robin. Sat in the bar area, with good views of two TV screens, and ordered through the waitress, not the electronic tablet gadget thing. Started with one of the $5 appetizers, one of my weaknesses, the salted pretzel bites with cheese sauce. These came out good and hot, soft and not overdone. Beers came out fine, I also tried both the peach and raspberry flavored iced teas -- too sweet and artificial, but if I had to choose one over the other I'd go with the peach. Main orders were the Bacon Cheeseburger ($10.49) with cheddar cheese, some pink, and the garlic herbed steak fries ($0.99 extra), and the Black & Bleu burger ($14.29) off the ""Finest"" menu, some pink, with sweet potato fries ($1.49 extra). For dessert we tried the short (4 instead of 8) tower of Doh! Rings ($5.99) -- basically RR's version of cronuts, which came with a fudge sauce and a berry sauce to dip them in.  The bacon on my burger wasn't crispy or anything, and the herbed streak fries look like they were just seasoned with garlic salt with some chopped parsley; I was expecting real garlic. This part of my meal wasn't that spectacular. My bf had the Black & Bleu burger, which comes with blackened sauteed portobellos, caramelized onion, bleu cheese sauce/crumble and dijon on ciabatta. The sweet potato fries are also cut skinny; why can' they make sweet potato steak fries too? In my opinion, for a bleu cheese fix, save your $3.50 and just get the Bleu Ribbon burger ($10.79) off the ""Gourmet"" menu. That comes with steak sauce, chipotle aioli, bleu cheese and onion straws on an onion bun. As for the ""bottomless"" fries aspect, neither of us ordered regular steak fries to begin with, but the second basket they brought to our table was just the ordinary seasoned steak fries. Oh well. The refill on beer took awhile too. The dessert was an afterthought, but since it was close enough to National Donut Day and cronuts are the ""in"" thing we got a half order to share. The presentation reminds me of a paper towel dispenser. The plastic cups with the sauce were not wide enough to really dip the donuts in easily. I did prefer the berry sauce over the chocolate. Covered in sugar, they did have some of the layering inside like a croissant and were okay. I've had other cronuts, as well as funnel sticks, donuts, etc. with the same idea before.  Service overall was okay. Bathroom floors were a litle sticky but otherwise well-stocked/maintained. Parking can be difficult since the lot is shared with BJ's and the Golden 1, otherwise easy to get back on I-80.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=40
Marc C.,"Union City, CA",43,18,1,1.0,5/15/2015,"***Do not visit this Red Robin...drive to Fairfield, trust me it's not worth going to this one*** So first off my poor review here stems from months ago. I have eaten at this chain multiple times, every time has been a poor experience. However, I understand that not all chains are perfect and there is always room for growth. The worst part of this chain is the excruciatingly slow service. I went in for lunch with my wife and son at 1:15pm on 5/15. It was not busy, most of the tables were empty with only 3 other parties seated. We got our menus and ordered from our server promptly after being seated. This was around 1:20pm. We ordered the zucchini sticks and jalapeño coin appetizer, 2 burgers, and a kids grilled chicken. We got our drinks shortly after, and this where the pain just dragged out. It was 1:40 and we still hadn't received our appetizers. Last time I checked, zucchini sticks and jalapeño coins do not take 20 minutes to cook. Upon receiving our app (from a different person by the way) I asked how long it would take for our burgers. The server said she'd check....never saw her again. 15 minutes pass and I finally catch our original server. I asked her to check on our food, and she came back with our food.  All good right?  Nope.  Instead what we got was one of the burgers cold and the grilled chicken wasn't cooked all the way. They served pink chicken to our 2 year old son. So at this point it's nearly 2pm when we get our food, roughly 40 minutes after ordering. I called the server to bring the manager out. Who we got was a manager on duty (not the general manager) who had just transferred in.  I explained that i had some major concerns with the wait time and showed him the pink chicken meat. At this point I didn't even bring up the cold burger, we were just hungry. He proceeded to tell me that one of the burgers can take up to 20 minutes to cook. Which is fine and all if it is what it is, but keep in mind we ordered 40 minutes prior and our apps alone took 20 minutes to cook. He took the kids meal back and removed the cost from our check. Meanwhile our son is still hungry because we didn't let him eat the undercooked chicken. Before we left, I talked to the manager on duty again and explained that this wasn't the first time I have had issues at this specific Red Robin. I'm even a regular at the chain he used to work at in Concord, which I have had no issues with. I told him he had his work cut out for him because this location has major issues, paid our bill, and left with out still hungry 2 year old son who wanted grilled chicken. -Extremely slow service on multiple visits -Cold Food -Undercooked Chicken Never again.  If you are considering going here, please just drive to Fairfield or another place to eat.

And my visit to this location in Vacaville was just great, mainly because of our super server, Janique.  We were seated in the bar, where Janique seemed to be handling all 452 tables by herself. Even so, she greeted us promptly, got our drinks to us promptly, took our order promptly, and kept our iced teas refilled; all the while being chipper and conversational. Let's just say, Janique earned herself a couple extra bucks on her tip! Oh, and the food was definitely to our liking! Being a Red Robin Royalty member, I get a free sandwich during my birthday month, which just happens to be May, so I ordered the mushroom/swiss with bottomless steak fries, which all came out hot and fresh (the bun was uber-soft, which I love). Hubby's soup and half sandwich came out with a FULL chicken caesar wrap, so he was stoked, and the chicken tortilla soup was given a thumbs up.  All in all, we really liked having lunch here after our shopping excursion at the Vacaville Premium Outlets. And you just can't beat free food for your birthday, right? Oh, and Janique noticed the birthday freebie when she ran our bill, which also means I could have received a free birthday sundae, but we were so full from lunch that we just gave it a pass.

Vedran V.,"Dixon, CA",129,341,153,3.0,8/4/2014,"This Red Robin used to be TGI Friday's back in the day so it is more spacious then some other locations of the popular burger chain. Most of the times there is no wait but the parking can take a while because there are businesses such as BJ's and Golden 1 in the same lot  I came here for lunch with a bunch of co-workers and they had no problems accommodating our group of 8 on a large table close to the TV. The service was prompt but not extraordinary by any means. We had to ask several times to get refill on their bottomless fries. If the fries are bottomless and there is a large group it would be expected to bring out more than two portions, furthermore since all of us had burgers that come with refillable fries. If this is something Red Robin prides itself on, they can clearly do better. Even being frugal does not really explain it.  For my meal I had a Burnin' Love burger, which comes with fried jalapeno rings, pepper jack, lettuce, tomato, and chipotle aioi on a corn crusted kaiser bun. Sounds mouthwatering, doesn't it? Well, while the burger wasn't bad, and they got the patty temperature right, it still did not impress me. The bun was a little on the dry side and the heat level from jalapenos, pepper jack and chipotle aioli was barely noticeable. WIth these ingredients I was expecting the burger to be the bomb but it was only solid. As for the brews to go with that burger, the beer selection at Red Robin is not bad for Vacaville, a town that is clearly missing a place that carries decent taps. They had about 10 handles, but the best beers I could find were Sam Adams Rebel and Lagunitas IPA. Sad fact is that on the West Coast we need to have imitation of WestCoast IPA (yes Rebel) while there are so many IPAs brewed in the same area/County. Suggestion to Red Robin: how about carrying Heretic brews? It doesn't get much more local then that for quality beer in Solano County.  Red Robin was OK for a lunch with co-workers and no one left hungry. For more than a 3 star rating things should be somewhat outstanding and Red Robin did not deliver that level or food/drinks/service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=80

After asking for a manager, a line cook came out and spoke with me, and that took another 5 minutes. he had the gall to tell be it was very busy!

Anne L.,"Fairfield, CA",7,45,19,1.0,3/23/2016,"Went to Red Robin's last night because my daughter chose the restaurant.  We came in at the end of the rush.  The couple behind us was dealing with the manager.  The woman's food was wrong and the french fries were in a petrified state. We were advised our server was only the second day of this job.  Normally, not an issue.  However, if you're going to train new servers, teaching them to refill drinks and removing appetizer plates is part of the process.  In my opinion, having 20+ years in hospitality, she needed to be supervised more or limited on her tables until she wasn't as flustered. We placed our order and it literally took at least 45 minutes.  Our waitress avoided our table completely.  My husband requested to speak with the manager after we witnessed another table receive their food and they had been seated only 15 minutes prior to ordering.  Our waitress chose that time to let us know they were ""putting our food together"".  We pointed out the other table, seated after us (by about 30 minutes) was already eating but they were still ""putting our together""?  She went back into the kitchen.   About five minutes later our food was brought out by the kitchen supervisor.  When I asked if he was the manager, which is whom we requested to speak with, he confirmed he was.  He wasn't.  He was a shift supervisor.  When asked why the other table only recently sat down and were already eating, while ours was just being delivered; he couldn't respond.  When I asked what the ticket time on our order was, he sputtered some ""uhs"" and said he didn't know, but it had been awhile.  He downplayed the entire issue and said, ""well, you're food's here now"".  Yea, because that makes it all better. Let's see, my daughter's order was wrong.  We had taken onions and mayo off her burger but it contained both.  My burger was warm but the extra-cost, sweet potato fries were lukewarm, at best and my husband's burger was cold. We sent it back, asking for our bill and the actual manager.  She took her sweet time coming to our table.  Since she came from the kitchen, it's likely she received a recounting of her supervisor's experience with us.  She came out, is an ultra quiet voice.  She wanted to make it ""right"".  However, it was 8:00 p.m., we still hadn't eaten and there was no way we were going to eat there.  When we pointed out the other table that received prompt service, she said, she was addressing our issue now.  She tried to tell me at Red Robin's ""manager"" and ""shift supervisor"" are interchangeable.  That simply is not true.  Managers are above a supervisor because they have more authority.  Obviously, by the could-care-less attitude from the kitchen supervisor, he clearly wasn't manager material. The manager, Rebecca, continued to talk in ""soothing tones"" like they teach you in nursing and psychology.   We asked for our bill and she said she'd take care of it.  She never let us finish a complete thought without interrupting and trying to keep the calm.  This irritated my husband to no end and he swore a couple times.  She had the nerve to tell him she'd have to ask him to leave if he continued that.  Seriously, we already told her we were leaving! We asked for her GSM's contact information.  She didn't know what a GSM (General Service Manager) was.  They had a regional manager, Brett, and she gave me his number.  I called and left a message as soon as we left, about 8:15 p.m.  The call was sent to voicemail.  I received a  call this morning from the same number, but it went to my voicemail (I was working).  There was no message left and when I returned the call, it went to voicemail again.  I have yet to hear from this Regional Manager. Overall, it was the worst experience we've ever had there.  They aren't stellar by any means, but this was absolutely ridiculous.  Customer service is a concept that is obviously foreign to that particular store.  The management is in desperate need of retraining.  When servers can be heard discussing why people are getting cut before them, and they've been there over 10 hours, it's not a good environment for anyone to be in. Save you're money...avoid this store.  Fuddruckers in Fairfield, CA is a better option and faster service! UPDATE (4/1/16):  It was nice of Red Robin to ignore the fact I asked to speak to someone above the Vacaville Regional Manager.  They were nice enough to email me, in attempts to not having to speak with me, to let me know they sent me a $20 gift card.  Awesome!  Yeah...no it's not.  I mentioned I would never be back but I wanted to speak with someone.  I called their corporate office again, requested my case be escalated, again, to have someone call me.  After all, last week I was promised someone from Red Robin would call me by Monday or Tuesday of this week.  That didn't happen either. ATTENTION RED ROBIN:  Have someone in your corporate office, look up case number 00699373, and have them call me.  Customer service means addressing the customer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=60

We ordered 2 Red Robin burgers and two pub menu burgers, We could barely tell them apart. The meat tasted like the fake ""pink-stuff"" burgers one would get at a cheap restaurant. All were cold and soggy. The buns were cheaper, too. The service was terrible, with a long wait for a table and service during the meal. Don't try the milkshakes. They're so small, but served in a glass that gives the illusion of being large. All of this for the $80.00 !!!! Go to McDonald's or Wendys. At least you'll get what you pay for.

Cuz this time seemed like one big Waiting game.  On a Friday night, the wait for a party of 4 was 45 minutes. It was so chaotic and unorganized cuz helllla folks were standing around waiting to be seated, yet when I looked around there were plenty of open tables available. We waited so long, my friends snagged a table and we ended up seating ourselves. Then we waited more to get a server's attention just so we could get menus. Instead of ordering off the actual menu, there's also ziosks where you can order food and drinks right from the table. But it's more convenient if you're paying with debit/credit card and be sure that the server activates it for you first.  Our drinks and appetizer of Onion rings came out quickly, but we waited again even longer for our burgers. I went with one of the new items, the Southern Charm Burger, consisting of a 1/2 lb Angus beef patty covered with melted cheddar cheese topped with applewood bacon and sautéed onions doused in barbecue sauce on a ciabatta bun. Also came with their signature bottomless steak fries. Though it sounds and looked delicious on the menu, the burger wasn't anything too special. I waited sooo long for my food, I devoured it outta pure hunger and impatience, which didn't sit too well with my stomach later.  I used to like Red Robin.

On Saturday, December 4, the wifey and I decided it would be a nice little outing to head to the famous Red Robin. We were craving some good burgers. Unfortunately, our food adventure did not get that far. Upon entering through the two, double-door entryway, we were immediately in line. Not that there was many people. There were three to be exact and then another four that came in behind us. From the doorway to the front counter is about seven steps away, so not much room to congregate comfortably. To the left there is a red, cushioned bench to rest your wearing bones....from waiting for a RIDICULOUS amount of time!! That's right! The wife and I entered the restaurant and waited to be greeted. Yes, that is normal for any place you go to BUT we waited, along with the others, for more than the standard wait time. What is the standard wait time you may ask? I do not know but I am pretty sure you don't have to wait awkwardly for more than three minutes--to be noticed! Multiple waitress walked by all of us w/o any type of greeting, almost avoiding any eye contact. On Sunday, December 5, the wifey and I decided to try the eatery one more time...hoping for the best.

Two stars is only for the manger who was very apologetic and did his best to remedy the situation.

I remember when I use to eat beef.  The burger here was good but messy, but then again if it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong on your face.  I would always order the chicken Caesar wrap, which was excellent!!  The bottomless steak fries are so addicting. During my last trip here, I was extremely disappointed.  I ordered the vegan burger, which was HORRIBLE.  Dried and no flavor.  It's probably like eating cardboard, if I ever ate cardboard.  I had to drink lots of water to get this meal down.  My family ordered the regular beef burgers and chicken burgers some of them liked it and other did not.  The universal complaint we had was it was too dry. Sadly, I will not be going back to Red Robin for a vegan burger.   Service was great at first until our waitress said she had to go on a break and someone else was going to wait on us.  After that the service went down hill.   If you plan on ordering any burger here, make sure to order something that has lots of sauce or have them add extra sauce.  Otherwise, you might choke on their burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=100

John M.,"Richmond, CA",938,1197,1158,3.0,11/7/2013,"When in Rome, do as the Romans do. What that translates to in Vacaville is dining at a corporate chain casual dining restaurant. For me & a lifelong friend meeting here in town, that's how we ended up being at Red Robin. I mean, this being Vacaville & all, your choices pretty much boil down to 1 variation on a theme or another of a Chotchkie's or a Flingers. We actually tried to go Fresh Mex 1st but that place was too busy. This place, on the other hand, had open tables & open seats at the the bar. We sat at the bar. Service from the bartenders was unremarkably OK. I ordered a Fiery Ghost Style Big Tavern Burger & we split an order of Towering Onion Rings. Our food didn't take too long. The Towering Onion Rings were served 1st. $9 seemed like a lot for this appetizer, but the Onion Rings were quite crunchy tasty & were served with 2 delicious dipping sauces. Since Red Robin's theme is burger joint & they make the ""best burger"" claim,  I was curious about how well they would perform in 2 aspects of my Burger: doneness & spiciness. I ordered my Burger cooked medium & it was supposed to have a Ghost Pepper sauce. The bun & veggies on my Fiery Ghost Style Big Tavern Burger were good. The burger patty, however, was slightly overcooked to medium well & needed more seasoning. Surprisingly, the Ghost Pepper sauce was actually respectably spicy hot with a nice smoky flavor. To wash down my Burger & Onion Rings, beer was the natural choice. The tap selection was much more macro than micro so I decided Guinness was the way to go. Now, there is a specific way to pour a Guinness correctly & the bartenders here had no idea how to do it. At the Red Robin in Vacaville, the Towering Onion Rings were good but pricey. The Fiery Ghost Style Big Tavern Burger was OK overall. & the way the bartenders poured Guinness would seriously piss off an Irishman. I know. I've had Guinness at Guinness' Gravity Bar in Dublin, Ireland. They take it seriously there & I guess I do too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=100

Most of the servers working at this Red Robin now are friendly, but things like not bringing our appetizer out until after our burgers have been brought out is unacceptable.  It is no longer an appetizer and pretty much defeats the point.  Another time our appetizer was brought out but not any small plates, and our server kept forgetting our requests.  And not that it was our server's fault, but we had to wait awhile for our drinks one time because there weren't any clean glasses available.  As for the hosts/hostesses, some are friendly; others, not so much.  We had one hostess seat the family that came in after us before us, and when she did seat us she put us at the worst table in the restaurant.  We did not have a good feeling after that.   I love their bacon cheeseburger and their Red Royalty rewards card is pretty good, so I can keep coming back because of those things.  But there is definitely room for improvement when it comes to their service, and if it does happen, I can bump up the rating again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=120

However I had to wait 12 minutes just for the hostess to say that it would be an hour wait. The host is the first person customers make contact with, and should the easiest job to maintain. I understand staffing can sometimes be an issue but there shouldn't be any at the front. Tonight they left many customers hanging.

The speckled lemonade is great, and the waitress at this location came by with refills before we even needed them. I got a sauteed mushroom burger, and there were so many mushrooms on it they were overflowing! Great, since at other places they will give you 4 or 5 slices only. We also got the tower or onion rings appetizer, which were really good and had a couple of dipping sauces. Cant forget about the bottomless steak fries!! Its funny, Ive never had to order a second round of fries because there's just too much food, but just the thought of them being free makes me happy! BF got the burger with the fried egg on it (cant remember the name), but he didnt talk much so Im guessing he was too busy soaking up the deliciousness to do so. Ask to sign up for the RedRoyalty Rewards program! Its free, and they keep track of how many burgers you've ordered and how much you've spent there, and will give you free items and deals after so many points.

Server only came by once after our drinks were delivered to ask if we needed anything during which we asked for some fries to hold us over until the food came.  Never got refills on our drinks until we asked.  Food was okay...we had the black & bleu burger, tavern burger (eh) and kid's cheeseburger. They've gotten skimpy on the bottomless fries.

First off, there is nothing wrong with the food quality or taste. Tastes great just like at any other typical Red Robin. When we arrived for lunch on a Monday afternoon, the place was far from bustling. We have a 3-year-old and she was not offered a kid's menu nor crayons/coloring sheet to play with. What got me a bit riled up was the fact that our order took, oh by my best estimate, at least 25 minutes to come out. I'm not sure what the hold up was, but again, the place was not busy. A little assurance or update by the wait staff in regards to our order would have been appreciated. Anyway, the only cool thing going for this place are those mini-iPad type devices at every table where you can order appetizers, drinks, and pay your bill.

Then she did the same with the upgrade options for for my sons sweet potato fries without mentioning that it cost extra (I learned this from our eventual bill).   When I gave the server a $3 coupon at the end, she came back with my new bill...but it wasn't even mine and it was $20 more, rather than $3 less than my bill.  Then they still wanted me to pay with their table top payment machine.  Their machine wouldn't  just accept my card until I swiped a loyalty card (which I don't have).  This all took a good 20 minutes.   Just not impressed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=140

I did not like the sandwich at all. It was a grilled chicken breast on ciabatta bread with pesto mayo topped with alternating slices of tomato and mozzarella. This should have been a win. The chicken breast was very bland and very uneven in size.  And there was just something about the pesto mayo. Now I love pesto, but they went overkill with the basil. It just wasn't a good sandwich.

I ordered the black & bleu burger which is part of their new promotion for America's finest burgers or something. Super overpriced for what it is. The burger is 14.29 without tax, and I asked to sub their regular fries for their new herbed garlic fries, and got charged an additional $.99 even though my friend made the same sub (albeit on a different burger) and did not get charged for it. The burger was just okay, nothing special especially when I'm paying for what's supposed to be one of their ""premium"" burgers. Tried their raspberry cream soda (not bottomless) and they didn't even top up the glass with the soda all the way. Their version of the cream soda just seemed like regular raspberry Italian soda with whipped cream on top that you're supposed to stir in. For a drink that's almost $4 and not bottomless, I at least expect my glass to be topped up. Just my check was $20+ not including tip. For that price I would have rather gone to BJs, or better yet saved myself $12 and gone to chipotle. Splitting checks for 10 was super easy though so props to that.

After about 3 minutes of her Red Robin exercise routine we were seated. My Mom ordered some fish burger and I ordered a chicken burger. Now these burgers were listed as between $9.99 and $12.99 on the menu, so I was expecting these gigantic burgers. Boy were we disappointed. Both burgers had no taste to them at all, but at least the fries were good.  This was after it took 30 minutes for us to receive our order.

Our server was quick with refills for our drinks which is always a plus, however, toward the end of our meal the service started to fade.  Strong start but poor finish.  We had to ask several times for a box before we finally got one.  We ended up waiting 15-20 minutes for our server to finish up the whole process of getting us our bill, taking our money, and giving us a togo box.  Normally, this wouldn't be a problem but the place wasn't very busy.  Perhaps they are understaffed? Either way, customer service shouldn't be overlooked, especially in today's economy with the amount of choices each patron has. My advice, get your food togo, or else you will wait an unusually long time for mediocre service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=200

We Sat In The Bar Area, It Was Nice Inside And Our Server Was Polite. We Ordered The Pretzel Bites, Wings, Balsamic Salad, And Two Burgers. The Appetizers Came Out: Pretzels Bites Were Over Cooked And Cheese Sauce Tasted Rancid It Had Chunks Of What Looked To Be Lettuce Or Petrified Onions And Tasted Horrible I Asked For A Side Of Ranch For Dip But By The Time It Came The Bites Were Hard And Cold. The Wings Were Decent, Hot And Sauce Was Good No Complaints But By No Means Memorable. The Salad: Great Looking Lettuce, Croutons Were Delicious, Cucumber Slices Were Crispy But The Dressing Tasted No Where Near Like Balsamic Vinaigrette... Maybe A Low Quality Store Bought Italian. The ""Gourmet Burgers"" Were More Like 9 Month Old Frozen Patties They Had No Flavor, Not Even A Hint Of Seasoning. One Bite And I Was Reaching For A Napkin To Spit It Out. My Fiancés Burger Was Burnt To A Crisp When He Asked For Medium Well. I Had Asked For Well Done And Mine Was No Where Near As Black As His. I Would Love To Know Where The Owners Of This Place Get The Nerve To Even Place ""Gourmet Burgers"" In Their Company Name. I Make Better Burgers At Home. Cheap Meat? No Seasoning? Lack Of Experience In The Kitchen? This Place Needs A Serious Reality Check The Quality Of Food. Next Time I Would Definitely Wait The :30 Mins For Somewhere Else.

Thankfully, they did not disappoint; the fries came out warm and perfectly seasoned (though a bit late, and the sweet potato fries were incredibly subpar). Like many other reviewers of this location, I felt that the quality of service did not match the excellent quality of the food, but the server certainly redeemed himself by being much more attentive later in the experience (we even got more fries without asking) and his demeanor seemed became more relaxed. Overall, the service did not interfere so much with the quality of the food that I felt the need to drop the rating anything below 4 stars.

We wait another 15 minutes and still nothing. So we finally track down our waitress to politely ask about our meal and why parties after us were served before us, she snapped ""well it's Saturday and I put their orders in first"" and shrugs her shoulders.  Upset we decided to give it a few more minuted,30 minutes go by and we decided enough was enough. We gathered our things and began exiting our table. Just as we were getting ready to walk away the manager lazily came up to us with a tray of food that looked as if it had been sitting on the counter for an hour,forgotten, and ran through a microwave in an attempt to reheat.  By that time my family and I were extremely upset, and had no desire to continue our horrible dining experience.  Both the manager and waitress were condescending and tried their best to be little my family and I.

The waitress was unavailable and ignored our table for a long time.  We ordered two burgers, each with the GF buns.  It took over 20 minutes for our burgers to come out (in no world does it take this long to grill a burger to Med Rare) and when they did, they were COLD.  We complained and sent them back.  It took 10 minutes to get a second burger and when we did, they were terrible.  The burger tasted like it had been microwaved and the bacon on it was underdone and cold, so it just tasted like grease.  For a place where burgers are supposed to be the specialty, this is unacceptable.  Our waitress was never around and we had to go find someone to help us. The reason for two stars instead of just one is that the kitchen manager tried very hard to make good on this.  There was no charge for our lunch and the manager even gave us a gift card for a future visit.  I doubt I will ever return to a Red Robin after this experience and will give the gift card to a friend who might use it on her many road trips with the kids' soccer team.

I was looking at all the empty tables wondering what the hold up was, but finally we were seated. The host and hostesses that we dealt with seemed pretty short, and not very friendly. Our waiter arrived and took our order and I could not find in the menu the buffalo wings that I used to love. I was assured by the waiter that they still served them, so placed a full order, and my son ordered chicken strips and fries from the children's menu. About 15 minutes later our food came out and I was surprised at the small serving size presented to my son. There was 2 small chicken strips and a handful of fries. The wings that I had ordered were NOT what I remembered, and the taste was very off. They were also very fatty and soaked in grease. I asked the waiter if these were indeed buffalo wings, as they were not what I thought I was getting. He then informed me that there was recent recipe changes and that they now go with this recipe where regular wings were tossed in a ""zing"" sauce. The sauce was oil based and not very tasty. He then offered to bring me out a side of the sauce. I have a feeling they have encountered this complaint numerous times.

She never forgot about us though, but one thing I noticed was that we had to ask for our refills (fries and sodas) instead of her automatically bringing the refills out to us. But we were in no rush, so we had nothing to complain about. When our waitress gave us the check, she offered us the Red Robin Royalty card which is basically a rewards card.

My burger was flatter then McDonalds and it looked like it was ran over a million times and it was burnt. I had them take it back because it was so nasty. And i did not order anything else. When we asked why the soup and chili was not at our table yet the server replied saying "" Well i cant touch the food until its on tray"" ( at that point everyone was done eating and that person had not received there food) she then came back with refills before his food. When we asked why the burgers cant be cooked with some pink left she replied with "" its because we dont cook steak. "" i know you dont cook steaks i dont go to red robin for the steaks. Duhhh. Very rude waitress. I them went over what happened with both of the managers and they did comp us for what happened, but i will never go back. And shouldve known not to go somewhere that has that little of stars. DO NOT GO HERE. rant over. If i could give -5 stars i could.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=240

B. W.,"Fairfield, CA",0,15,11,1.0,12/28/2014,"If you don't  mind being ignored  when you walk in , given dirty silverware, waiting forever to be waited on and given food prepared not the way you wanted it and served cold.This is the place for  you. Ordered  tortilla soup that had no tortilla strips. Soup wasn't  even hot when I got it mention that my soup didn't  have the totilla strips to server she said she would bring some 7 minutes  later she brings  them to me at this point soup was cold .  Service only started picking up when my mother in law said I should ask for a new soup. At this point I was so done with the whole thing that I made the comment, ""It's  not my tip I just want to leave."" Then all of the sudden  our server became very attentive. Go figure.  Needless  to say this is not the first time we received  horrible service  here. One time we went in @11am  when they first  opened and nobody was in there, our server was more interested  in chatting  with the other employees  then helping us. She seem as if she preferred  us to use the table pads to order our food then do her job. Brought our drinks but didn't  bother to check if we wanted  refills  until we finished  our meal. From now on will only go to the Red Robin in mall the services in my opinion is far better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=240
Jenny B.,"Vacaville, CA",40,17,5,2.0,8/13/2013,"This is not the Red Robin of my youth or even the one in Fairfield.  Service was super slow, yes, I know in this economy that there's less servers to save money but 45 minutes is pushing it. Our burgers looked like anorexic hockey pucks.  My son's chicken strips were more of chicken strip and a half.  No worth the price. BUT, get the campfire dip for your fries.  That's tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=240

Shanelle D.,"Dublin, CA",1,12,29,1.0,10/4/2014,"This review is based on customer service. First off let me say I like Red Robin, so when we decided to stop at this location, I was expecting the same awesome customer service. Boy was I wrong!!! When we first walked in, the hostess rudely ignored us. We stood there for at least a minute or two before she said how many? Then she proceeded to tell us there would be a 10 to 15 minute wait, which wouldn't have been an issue if they were super busy. But they weren't. So anyway we finally got seated at an empty table that had been empty the whole time. Shortly after a waitress rushingly says ""I'll be right with you"" as she walks on by. Then about 5 minutes later (probably a little longer), I guess the manager comes by (only because I said something loud enough for her to hear as she walked by) and says ""oh your waitress will be with you shortly. But in the meantime can I take your drink orders"" So I proceed to order our drinks. She brings them pretty quickly. Still haven't seen or met our waitress. The manager then saw me looking at the order tablet at the table and said ""did your waitress explain this to you?"" I said ""no we don't even know which one she is."" The manager or assistant manager (the same woman) then asks to take our food orders. We order. We have been there about 25 mins or so still waiting. Still haven't met our waitress even though everyone around us is being served and taken care of. Then at the hostess station the phone starts ringing. It literally rang for about 15 minutes. The hostess and another higher up both continued to ignore the ringing phone even though they could clearly hear it. Finally someone answers the phone. Annoying. Still have no idea who or where our waitress is. Suddenly after staring her down, low and behold I guess it was our waitress as she walked by she asked ""what kind of drink did you have?"" I'm thinking to myself, um and who are you? She never said hi, sorry I missed you or sorry for taking so long or even telling us her name. At that point I had it with the poor customer service. I get it that the manager was trying to help her but for whoever our waitress was supposed to be, to not ever even introduce her self at all or say anything to us ever is just rude. When you feel like your being treated poorly you lose your appetite. We asked to cancel the orders and said we would pay for the drinks we already drank. The manager was nice and said don't worry about it and sorry that we had a bad experience (something like that). Anyway we weren't the only ones that had walked out, several families walked out before even being seated. This is my own experience, but an honest opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=240
S S.,"Sacramento, CA",1,23,11,3.0,1/2/2015,"We went to Red Robin Vacaville location for the first time, to have a burger. Was happy to see they have a Red Robin!  The burger was okay. Over done and a lot of mushy onions. It was still tasty, plus service was good... so 3 stars.  The surprising part about the place was how unclean it was and it was only noon on New Years Day.  There was mashed food and wooden skewer next to our booth on the floor. Service people walking over it back and forth.  The wood wall dividers dusty and pieces of debris. The drink menu had spatter and was sticky.  Didn't order a drink. The Ladies bathroom was disgusting.  Stuff on the tile walls, dirty floors, and 3 empty TP rolls and none attached in the holder (the most sanitary way) in the handicap stall.  The other stalls had no TP. The paper towel waste bin was overflowing onto the floor. The thing is... that this did not happen all in the morning and it was not that busy yet.  It has to be an ongoing period of neglect.  It is a turn off and what about food drink prep and kitchen conditions and regulations?  It can't be good. We have experienced unsanitary conditions in two other restaurants over the years in shopping trips to Vacaville... not sure what the deal is? I hope they can clean it up as I really like the chain for 'a chain.' Just trying to make you guys aware so you can improve things.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=240
Dave J.,"Folsom, CA",33,83,13,2.0,2/11/2013,"Service is pretty pathetic here. The food is standard Red Robin (a step up from fast food). Still, this is Vacaville and there are not a ton of GOOD chain restaurants available (there ARE a ton of chain restaurants here--just not good ones). This makes Red Robin one of the better chain restaurants in Vacaville that I've been to. (Olive Garden is another.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=240

Julianne B.,"Vacaville, CA",4,17,,1.0,7/31/2014,"I took my Mom for her birthday on July 23rd. We view RR as a good go to place which has always been consistently good. This time, not so much. We were lead to two tables which were dirty. The third table was least dirty so we were sat there. The ""ziosk"" electronic order/pay thing was sitting askew on the table and it looked like all the days crumbs had been pushed under there. Disgusting. I was hoping my Mom did not notice. The server arrived promptly and was nice. Our drinks came and we ordered. Then we waited. We never saw anyone that looked like a manager and our server didn't come back for a very long time. When the food arrived it was dry, cool and had the appearance of sitting under a heat lamp. The server nervously giggled and advised there were some large parties up front. Clearly she meant, the large parties took priority over us! The server came back once after that first bite and then disappeared. My Mom wanted more fries, never happened. I would've liked new fries as mine were cold and wilty! I paid the bill via the ziosk thing but my mom wanted a box. I hit the server call button and the server finally came so I could ask for a box. She dropped the check which I informed her I already paid. The next day I received a request to complete a survey. I filled it out and asked to be contacted by someone from the company. Still waiting for that call!! Clearly I would not recommend this Red Robin to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vacaville-3?start=240
