Michelle F.,"Studio City, CA",28,139,161,5.0,12/24/2017,Immediately greeted. Small amount of guest already for Christmas Eve at 11 am.  Our waitress Jess (jessica) on the receipt provided phenomenal service. We have a 10 month old baby. She assisted and provided high chair. She asked what we like to drink. We ordered water and coffee and Jess offered us baby water. Thank you for thinking of the baby. Ordered our food and we ordered a side turkey patty for the baby which Jess brought that out a short time later before our food and it was appreciated. Jess was attentive to us & provided excellent customer service with a smile. Thank you Highly recommend this place & ask for Jess. Just noticed $1.99 entertainment fee. I am assuming that tablet on the table which we didn't use.  Not really sure what that is but I will call after Christmas.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura
Stephanie K.,"Ventura, CA",4,39,,2.0,10/10/2017,"The last time I went here, about a month ago, I was shocked. We went in and made our way to the hostess. 3 girls stood looking at us and then 2 walked away and the 3rd ignored us like we were invisible. Still standing there, patiently waiting. Waiting, waiting.....Suddenly the 3rd girl asks us if we had been helped!!!!!! What! You were standing right in front of us, ignoring us and pretend not to know we were not helped? This is totally unacceptable. My hubs looks straight at her and says ,"" you stood right there and ignored us as though we didn't exist, I will spend my hard earned money elsewhere! ""We quickly walked out and went to always dependable Yolanda's.  Really people? What has happened to customer service? We did complain to their headquarters. They said they would handle it. Of course they had to say they were sorry. A meaningless sorry. Our complaint fell on deaf ears. We never heard a peep from anyone at Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura
Mikey C.,"San Buenaventura, CA",145,297,3874,4.0,12/7/2016,"Even though I have lived nearby for over ten years, this was my first time trying a Red Robin.  I love their commercials and every time I see one I tell my wife, ""Maybe we should try that place."" She always says, ""You know you're not going to like it.  It's not your kind of place.""  She has a valid point.  This is definitely not my kind of restaurant.  They probably have 40 or 50 different varieties of hamburgers on the menu and none of them appeal to me.  I don't need a lot of weird stuff on my burger and if there's going to be sauce added, I want to be the one applying it. Yeah, I know they have a straight up hamburger with none of the extraneous toppings.  OK, that might work.  But hold up, what is the fries situation here? Steak fries?  Oh hell no.  Not with a burger!  With a steak, maybe.  We'll talk.  But steak fries don't work for me in a burger situation. OK, maybe my wife is right (she always is). At first glance, it's not my kind of place. But then I discover that Red Robin has a customer loyalty program, and they give you a free burger on your birthday.   I thought to myself, ""Hey, I have a birthday!  I bet I could qualify for one of those free burgers!""   Suddenly Red Robin is becoming more and more like my kind of place.  I went to their website and signed up lickety split! Then, while I'm on their website, I check out their menu.  Pages and pages and pages of the most beautiful hamburgers imaginable.  Beautiful, I'll admit,  but to me, unappealing.  I was almost ready to give up.  But then I noticed they serve patty melts.  I love patty melts!  And what's this? They have French Onion soup, too?  Hey, I now I'm getting into this. So I drop by today to enjoy my free birthday patty melt.  I requested a booth and Dolores, the hostess, led me to the back of the restaurant where they have small two person booths.  I'm only five foot one, but I was a little cramped in that tiny booth.  I asked for a table change and Dolores cheerfully accommodated my request. My waitress, Monica, was at my table moments later.  I mentioned it was my first visit to Red Robin and she explained what I needed to know and answered all my questions.  After my meal was delivered she kept an eye on my table, ready to bring anything I needed. I started with a cup of French Onion soup, because I love the stuff!  As it does everywhere, it came with a cheese topped crouton and that had been passed under a broiler.  The crouton here was very good.  Toasted and buttered on each side, it's covered with just the right amount of bubbly melted cheese.  The crouton was the best part of the soup.  That's not optimal, of course.  But it is not surprising, either.  In restaurants that don't specialize in French Onion soup, its's quite common.  Not necessarily a deal breaker.. As for the soup itself, the broth was good.  But the onions in the soup were wayyy undercooked.  You would expect them to be so limp they almost melt into the broth.  These onions still had the same shape they did when they were cut. I couldn't tell if I had a bowl of C's or U's. Undercooked onions in French Onion soup?  That's a deal breaker. But, did I mention the broth was tasty?  Yes, because check this out: right when I finished off the delicious crouton, the hostess brings over an additional two slices of toasted bread.   OK, I was just about to give up on the soup.  But with back up bread I was able to take care of all that broth.  Still had to work around the undercooked onion pieces to get at the broth, but it was worth it. I have to say I liked the patty melt, despite the fact that it was totally over cooked. Monica asked if I wanted it a little pink, and of course I said Yes!  So, I was a little disappointed, but it was still hella tasty.  The grilled onions were undercooked (again? WTH?) and you can barely taste the rye in the marble rye the sandwich is served on.  Nevertheless, it was still a tasty sandwich.  Did I finish it off?  Pretty close! I ordered my steak fries well done.  That was stupid.  I should have just left them alone.  You live, you learn.  LOL. Washed it all down with a Strawberry Lemonade.  OK, first time trying one of these and I liked it.  I liked it a lot!  Polished off one, they brought me another.  God bless this country! Will I go back to Red Robin?  Definitely!  I'm scheduled for another birthday next year. I kid, I kid.  Of course I'm coming back.  I just found out they have bottomless root beer floats.   I almost wish I hadn't found out about that!   I accept your challenge, Red Robin!  (evil laugh) I'll tell you what: this is a fun place to eat, and I had great, really great service.  The employees clearly take pride in their jobs.   Mikey C says: thank you for the free birthday burger, Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura
Luis G.,"Goleta, CA",26,7,1,5.0,12/10/2017,"First time trying Red Robin So I went in looking at the menú they gave me and asked for a burnin love without cheese and chipotle mayo, the time was perfect but when they brought me my hamburger it had cheese in it I was kinda sad and told the lady it had cheese so they took the burger and the manager came out to apologize and tell me ""there making your burger right now "" ...right away they gave me another hamburger without the cheese but the fact that the manager took his time to talk to me I was happy , little words can mean so much",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura
Crystal C.,"Oxnard, CA",3,58,64,4.0,7/25/2017,I visit this Red Robin very often. My favorite dish is the buzzard wings which are on a special menu for $5! I am a buffalo wing fanatic and can truly say these are some great wings ! Their burgers are always what the picture depicts which is usually rare. The only downfall I have seen with visiting this place is the amount of fries they give you with a bottomless fries order. I have on most occasions gotten less than half of a basket full of fries. I would appreciate more fries since they are bottomless. Otherwise the service is great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura

Mitch M.,"Oak View, CA",0,15,,5.0,11/6/2017,"We ate at the Santa Clara location. ( near Levi Stadium).  We ate there twice in our 2 day stay.  I had fish and chips( 1st) meal my son had the burger  with bacon and egg on it. He said it was delicious. It was huuuge. Bottomless fries way cool   We also had the ""Tower of Onion ringsThat would have been a meal in itself.  The next evening we both had the French onion soup It was  Excellent!   Service was superb both evenings.  Definitely a positive experience.

Andrew M.,"Ventura, CA",23,45,2,1.0,12/13/2016,"Been to this Red Robin a few times. I usually order take out. This time they gave me not even half an order of fries. Can't believe I paid $20 for this. I won't be back anytime soon, feel ripped off. Unfortunately I didn't get to see this until I opened the box at home. I ordered 2 sides of the special ketchup for my fries, which costs me .75 cents each. I didn't even get to use the extra ketchup.  Pepper & Smoke Burger was good though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura
Heather K.,"Camarillo, CA",260,264,1648,2.0,3/18/2016,"Pretty disappointed at this visit. I'm a semi regular here and am usually NEVER disappointed. Steak fries? YEA! Royal Red Robin? You bet. But this visit was SAAAAAAAAD.  Came in at 3:30. Not busy at all. We were seated right away and then the server took our drink orders. Drinks took FOREVER, and we only had a few sodas and a few kids lemonades. and that's it. The bar wasn't busy to warrant the length of time before we got our drinks. It was over 10 min easy.  Ordered the Whisky River burger well-done. This burger was ICE COLD when it was served to us. If I requested it WELL DONE, how could it have been sitting under the heat lamp for so long? Shouldn't it have been cooked TO ORDER? The bun was stale and as hard as a rock. It was as if someone ordered this exact burger 2 hours earlier, changed their mind, it was put under the heat lamp, then served to us. I wasn't going to say anything but the sever came by and asked so I told her the deal. She took it back and said she'd bring another. Even before serving us a COLD burger, our server was grouchy. Didn't crack a smile, nothing. Sure we had kids in our party but you work at RR. It's what you do! Her attitude was SO STARKLY different than the host who was climbing all over himself asking us if the location our booth was OK. He said he ""wanted to make sure his customers were happy"".  The manager then brought out our NEW COOKED burger. I had to request fresh hot fries because our fries were cold with said burger. Surprised the manager didn't even acknowledge the cold burger, since SHE was the one who brought the HOT one to us. This is the manager with short hair (female) and wears the trendy eyeglasses. Just a pretty cruddy visit all around.  Positive note: The kids liked their meals, the fish & chips were served very hot! Just wish the rest of our food had been.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura
Lene N.,"East Bay, CA",1432,853,4297,4.0,12/10/2015,"When I told my hubby that I have never had Red Robin, he looked at me all sideways. He then went on to say how amazing the food was and reminisced on all the memories he had when coming to a Red Robin throughout High School and as a child. With this said, I said...why the hell not, let's go there for dinner...which was perfect because we went right after the gym.  RR is located on the west side of the Pacific View Mall (next to CPK) with entrances from the parking lot and or the mall itself. The hostesses put your name and party count into their iPad and then the waiting begins; we waited about 15 minutes-which wasn't too bad because there was already a line when we arrived.  We were seated next to the FULL BAR which was nice because there were multiple TVs playing the football game, plus we were seated away from all the parties with smaller (rowdy) children. Our server, Amy ""Christine"" was fine. She always seemed busy but still had time/remembered to attend to us. They have these iPad looking things at each table. Using this mini iPads you can order appe's, dessert, and non-alcoholic drinks. At the end of your meal, you can also pay your bill using these iPads on the table. After ordering our food was out within 15-20 minutes or so. Feel free to check out /like my pics from tonight's dinner. The burgers are pretty big and juicy. Highly recommend getting your bigger with some pink (medium cooked) and ask for shredded lettuce. I had the Fiery Ghost Burger, which was not spicy at all. It was fresh and had deep fried jalapeños inside. My hubs order the BBQ burger. His was just as juicy and messy to eat, all very tasty good stuff. Best thing about our dinner was the bottomless, thick cut fries. Okay, so what you do is...when the fresh fries arrive... You grab the RR Red Seasoning and just shake it all over your fries and Boom. Delish!  #BottomlessFries =Unlimited Fries ...mhmmmm. As my first visit, I would to say this place is not that bad for being part of a corporate chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura
Carol G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,17,20,4.0,8/28/2017,Stopped at red Robin today for dinner. We always enjoy the California burger and a small order of onion rings. Misha was our server and made our meal very special with her personality and conversation. We were very disappointed in the remodelling going on in the restaurant. It no longer has the happy go lucky fun pictures on the wall. The wine bottles hanging by a string  over the bar is extremely tacky. Removing the carrousel horse is losing the whole atmosphere of the restaurant. Don't know what someone was thinking to make any of these changes!

Rachel W.,"Ventura, CA",669,482,1479,3.0,6/11/2015,"Reeeed Robinnn... I've got the jingle in my head right now.  Somethings seriously wrong with the amount of useless information I have stored in my brain. Red Robin is your standard Chain Restaurant, flashy and colorful when you enter, somewhere between a 50's malt shop and full fledged bar. The hamburgers are loaded and juicy, my favorite has always been the Whiskey River BBQ burger with the onion straws, it's a messy burger to eat, but so good. You can request a wheat bun if you so desire, and they will specialize your order and I've never had to send anything back as yet. No diet food here, everything is loaded with mucho fat grams so may the force be with you. Whomever does the hiring, has a great eye and picking personable people because in the time I've gone to Red Robin I've always been greeted with courtesy and a smile.

Ashley L.,"Santa Paula, CA",0,30,24,2.0,10/19/2016,"I was doing some shopping at the mall so me and my son stopped in for lunch. My son is 5 years old so I was a little disappointed that the menu wasn't paper with crayons like most restaurants. Our waitress was very friendly, I ordered the guacamole bacon burger and my son ordered the kids macaroni and cheese. The burger was good except I expected more guacamole it barely had any to the point I couldn't even taste it. My son liked the macaroni but the side mandarin oranges were disgusting. They were soaked in a sort of syrup and just tasted bad. My French fries were cold and overcooked and just tasted like frozen fries you throw into the oven. My son had a milkshake which was pretty good but overall I don't think I will be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura
J.R W.,"Port Hueneme, CA",0,56,19,3.0,12/15/2016,"Popped in to the Pacific View Malls, ""Red Robin"", lunchtime, December 13. I was greeted at the door by a bubbly Samantha, who recommended any of the great burgers. After being seated and having made my selection, all I need now is my server. Molly passed by the table and stated; ""she would be right there"". She wasn't. She eventually returned and took my order.  Gourmet Burger and salad. Balsamic dressing. The food arrived with a different server who informed me there's no Balsamic dressing and was gone. Molly dropped by my booth and asked if everything was good? I informed her there was no Balsamic dressing for my salad, to which she replied, ""Oh yeah, we're out"".  It should be noted, the booth behind me, and in front of me, had four people in each. Molly regularly checked in these booths to see if everything was OK. She never came back to my booth again. Samantha was correct, the burger was great, I left the naked salad. Overall I enjoyed my visit and would return. The burgers are really good , the service however, was very poor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura

Chelly P.,"Ventura, CA",1,51,47,3.0,3/20/2017,"Really bummed about this as I've always LOVED RR. However my most recent visit was a complete and total let down. Although our server was polite she wasn't as attentive as what we've become accustomed to at RR, especially at this location. She constantly forgot requested items and seemed to be distracted. Totally get that we all have bad days, and her service is only a tiny bit of why I've updated with a lower rating. Join receiving our meals we all sort of looked at each other wondering what happened to the burgers and fries we've grown to love. Burgers were sloppy looking, and significantly smaller. And worse off all the fries were all over cooked hard ends. All 7 of the fries on my plate. Ordered another batch and yet again, burnt, ends and again only about 7 in the basket. Now for a place that offers bottomless fries I don't get why they're being so stingy with them, or why they're all burnt ends. Maybe to cut costs?  Not sure, but I'm hoping this gets fixed ASAP!!!  I'd like to keep RR as my ""go to"" place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=20

Hooper C.,"Antioch, CA",17,6,4,2.0,9/6/2016,"I haven't been here in 4 years, sad to say service is just as bad as I remember it.  Went in on Sunday, during a rush, which is understandable why service is a stretch. But it seems that this chain, which when it first opened was fun and roomy, became a money crunching machine. Four years ago, the atmosphere was hectic, you're lucky to get one refill of fries or a drink.  Going back to my experience on Sunday, wait time to be seated was around 10 minutes, no issue there.  We were sat at a two person booth, given our menus and told our hostess would be with us in a minute.  She came sniffling and rubbing her nose with the back of her arm, careful to not be too obvious that she was obviously sick.  She took our order, but it felt rushed, in the end we ordered a drink that they didn't have an ingredient for and while we were deciding she told us to order on the little screen on the table. Which by the way, are both a interesting and impersonal device. But we didn't finish our order, and when we told her what else we wanted she picked up the screen and told us if we wanted anything else to order on the screen.  I didn't think much of that at the moment, I was enjoying myself with my partner and we were conversing and playing a game, which goes back to how the little screen was interesting. At 1.99, if you want to have a few rounds with your friends it's a great idea. But it is an impersonal way to order drinks and food, which we wished there was an option to take it easy on the ice, we felt that this took away the appeal of a fun funky atmosphere into just a glorified fast food joint, where you don't really need a host to really take an order, and might as well go to the front to get your food.  We got our drinks, mine a freckled lemonade was filled to the top with ice. Which made it taste like lemon water, and my partners drink was also to the brim with ice, and with a small swirl of whip cream to make your own orange cream drink.  Bad drinks were not a big deal, on occasion drinks can be pretty off so we just requested low ice on the refills. We ordered the Poutine, but were given no cutlery besides two knives and napkins. It was pretty bothersome to have to request forks and wait even after we were served our appetizer and left without being asked if we needed anything. The Poutine was pretty good, we requested no gravy, the mushrooms were soft and well seasoned, fries are regular house fries, and the sauce had a nice low spice to it.  We got our meals, I ordered the waffle bun and my partner ordered the Mac and cheese burger.  We both shared half of our burgers since we were curious about the new meals.  The waffle burger was this sticky mushy sloppy mess of a thing. It tasted like orange chicken, and reeked of honey, it mushed together and fell apart easily. It was probably the most unenjoyable burger I have ever had. While the chicken was perfectly cooked, the smell was so distracting you couldn't enjoy the taste of the burger. The waffle bun was nonexistent, smashed, soggy, and really was a disappointing waste. The thing that I wished was changed was the red pepper syrup, it just wasn't appealing and really made the burger turn into a mess.  The Mac and cheese burger was lazy and underwhelming. The Mac and cheese had a bitter mellow taste, really nothing special there, it also spilled out and wasn't properly set. The meat was meat, normally I don't eat red meat, but I couldn't taste anything complex about it. It wasn't seasoned, unless the char on it is considered seasoning.  Other than that nothing about our meal was particularly good, we are members of red robin, and we ate at a few locations- and this was by far the worst location I have ever been to. But maybe it's the lack of hands that really throws this location off, they need more people. They need to be a bit more personal. I did tip the girl $5 which was more so than the suggested amount.  I didn't mind it since she didn't bring us our food while she was sick, I figure if your sick and working you must need the money. And I'm not employed right now, so I know how it is. She tried her hardest, and her service was more an issue with how the restaurant is ran rather than her personal work ethic.  If you want to try this place out avoid rush hour or dinner, unless you're absolutely craving it of course.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=20

Debbie G.,"Oxnard, CA",75,21,10,1.0,7/23/2016,"We are regulars at Red Robin, not just this location but whenever we travel outside of town. To start we were seated quickly by the hostess and told our server would be with us shortly.. Uh yeah almost 10 minutes later no one came by to even introduce themselves or get our drink order.. Finally our server came and to start she is not in the right line of work, she seemed lost and out of place. Well 5-7 minutes passed no drinks and no server, we had been sitting there for at least 15-20 minutes at this point from when we first arrived and we were all starving and had not even placed or been asked for our food order! I pushed the ""call server"" button on the table kiosk so we could order our food, it took her another 5 minutes to come and still no drinks. Finally another server came by to drop our drinks off at our table, we didn't even have water at this point. I'm not sure if our server was new or just not a good day for her as I could see other tables around us getting served and attended too before us with other servers. Anyway our food finally came and at that point not once did our server come back to check on us, nothing I again had to push the call server button to get a refill on the bottomless fries as well as I placed my own drink order via the kiosk (since she never came back) she passed quickly glanced over and didn't stop! At this point we (table of 6) were practically done with our food and had not received not even one refill the so called bottomless fries! We waited and waited and at this point I was timing it, it took her 14 minutes to finally come to our table after I pushed the call server button! We were all done with our food by the time she brought more fries.. Horrible service! I'm not one to complain as I know it's a hard job I get it, I have worked in customer service over 20 years but we looked and counted and timed and to be honest she had at most 3 tables, and she would disappear into the back, kitchen area for what? I don't know but looking around the other servers had no problem keeping up with their tables and customers we saw them constantly rushing and hustling back and forth when ours was no where to be found!  What was to be a great family dinner at one of our favorite spots totally ruined our night plans, in at 5:45 and didn't get out till after 8 way too long due to bad service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=20

With so many other restaurant options, it will be simple to choose an establishment that values it's customers. I ordered the Simply Grilled Chicken Salad, which is essentially a garden salad with a few quartered cucumbers and a sliced grilled chicken patty. I usually like this salad, but the size keeps shrinking. It went from being served in a bowl to being served on a plate. Hardly an entree salad and at its current size is not worth the entree price.

How is that even possible? It turned into a hysterical joke eventually, and I finally gave up.  Our sweet potato fries were old, shriveled, and cold - when we asked for new ones, they simply threw them back in the dryer to heat them up, giving us back warm, old, shriveled fries. Their microwave bacon is so stretchy, I tied it in an ACTUAL knot. Burger patties were so dry and withered, they made Burger King look appetizing. Finally, their voodoo fries - Ewwwwww! They were the most catastrophic, hideous ""fries"" I've ever had the displeasure of eating. The manager did comp our entire meal, which was fitting for the situation and much appreciated (since I never did get to eat ).  I'll say the one star could go towards our poor waitress and the manager, since they were both really nice.  Other than that, I'd rate this restaurant -5 Stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=40

PROs-  Food is great.  Good menu selection.  Burgers are good and the fish-and-chips are great.  Great dessert menu, and the Blue Moon milkshake is unique and a great idea.  Nice, tall, cold beer available...and a bar too.  Plenty of TVs to watch the games.  Location is good too.  It's inside the Pacific View Mall so you can go shopping afterwards.  The kids menu and food was good too, it was cooked in haste, and tasted fine.  Good lemonade with endless refills.  Bottomless fries too for certain meals.   CONs--No Tabasco sauce.  They used to have it, but no longer.  Takes away a lot of flavor I'm used to.  While they do have TVs, some are small, and hard to see the game and score.  (I know, if I want to see the game stay home...I get that, but sometimes it's fun to watch a game over a nice dinner out).  Waitresses are hit-and-miss, with some wanting you to hurry up, finish, and leave.  For a restaurant that big, you have to have another restroom stall.  One ain't gonna cut it.  Also, the fish and chips are good, but now you only get two deep fried fish....used to be 3. Overall, would I go back?  Yes.  The good outweigh the bad, and my wife really likes the place.  I enjoy the location and atmosphere.  Even though they got chincy with the fish and chips......I still like them with a nice tall beer!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=40

But it's reliable and dependable, and you do get those fries that keep on coming.

When we initially walked in, I asked for the booth that's right next to the huge carousel horse (for picture purposes - yes, I am a picture freak), but they gave me this complicated story as to why we couldn't be seated there blah blah blah. I didn't see what the big deal was, the table was BOTH vacant and clean. That was kinda weird. Oh, well! I tried not to take that personally though. OK, now for the FOOOOOOD... We ordered the towering onion rings   - yummy and very crispy! It is the thing to get here b/c it was EVERYWHERE!! The table next to us had it, the table behind us had it, the table across from us had it, well... you get the idea! Description: 13 rings in all ~ Sweet yellow onions -- breaded & crisply fried. Served with tangy Campfire Sauce and ranch dressing for dippin'. By the way, the campfire sauce was like music to my taste buds! I got the spicy BURNIN' LOVE burger b/c a fellow Yelper recently posted a review about this particular burger, and it seem to have my name all over it - I thrive on anything HOT & SPICY. It did not disappoint. Here's the description: crisply fried jalapeño coins, tangy salsa and spicy Pepper-Jack cheese layered on top of our cayenne-seasoned burger, served on a jalapeño-cornmeal kaiser roll with chipotle mayo My spouse ordered a chicken sandwich. I thought that was not such a good choice b/c this place is mainly known for their gourmet beef burgers. When in doubt, order the thing that dominates the menu (beef burgers in this case).  My 9 year old boy got an item from the kids menu - a pretty plain cheeseburger. I'm still waiting for the day when he'll eat a burger with more than just the meat, cheese and bun! I ordered the new salted caramel shake (available for a limited time) and that was a yum within a yum Mmmm. The sweet & salty combination made for a nice caramel shake. I love the shakes here. Service was good overall. We had like 3 waitresses (including the hostess), so I could not really tell who the main server was. One of the girls (hostess) brought some complimentary apple slices for my son... funny how my boy was craving their apple slices when he won't even bother to eat the organic apples I have at home! Anyway, the hostess and all the others were very nice and attentive.

Whenever sandy did come to our table she brought a very big attitude, and major unnecessary sarcasm.

To top off our bad experience at RR a few of us were almost immediately sick with vomiting etc. called to report to management and they could of cared less, putting blame else where, we were not asking for any handouts or compensation but the manager kept shining us on, they could of at least acted like they cared and noted the incident.

R C.,"Oxnard, CA",1,2,,1.0,10/30/2015,MUST READ!!! Today 10/30/15 about 3pm I went to Red robin in Ventura at the pacific view mall along with 5 other family members. Our sever name was Sandy n she was a terrible waiter!(btw I was going to leave her name out but this is unacceptable) We waited about 25 mins just for our drinks n when we finally did get to place our drink orders it wasn't even Sandy our waiter who took them down it was another lady! Sandy our waitress seemed to be helping everyone else but us it wasn't that busy either for us to be waiting so long just to place our DRINK orders! It was almost like she was avoiding our table! When she finally came to get our food order she had a bad attitude with us for no reason. We asked for napkins probably about 3 other times n each time she brought us about 4 napkins we were a group of 6 really?! Everytime we asked for something she made it seem as if we were bugging I'm sorry we are a big group we do need stuff. So once we got home 4 out of 6 of us got really sick from the food we were all throwing up. We called and complain to talk to a manger n we were told it takes 24hrs for Bactria to get to your system so it couldn't have been them who had made us sick! Basically saying they didn't care! We have all had red robin plenty of times n have never had this reaction before so we have reason to believe our waiter put something in our food! I WILL NEVER EVER EAT HERE AGAIN! N I will let everyone know my experience here! So thank you Sandy!

The service was definitely not an issue, and she did everything in her power to make things as good as she could for us. But unfortunately, what's going on back in the kitchen is another story... One of the main issues we had, is that I ordered a burger, and substituted a vegan patty in place of the meat patty, and then obviously ordered it with no bacon. I knew what I wanted, the waitress knew what I wanted (she repeated our order to us as she was taking it), but for some reason, the kitchen staff didn't get it. Why on earth would they think that I would want a vegan patty on my burger WITH BACON?!?! The waitress was super apologetic, and took it back to have it remade right away, but unfortunately it took them so long to make a replacement, that by the time mine came out, my husbands food was getting cold and soggy. Aside from that, everything was completely drenched in grease. I always get the garlic fries at every Red Robin I go to, and yes, they are always a little on the greasy side, but these were just ridiculous! We also ordered the fried pickles, which were so super salty we were both chugging water all day, and they were actually dripping with grease! Both my husband and I felt super sick for hours after eating there, just because we're not accustomed to eating that much grease. Once again, nothing against the serving staff (which is why I gave two stars instead of just one), but the kitchen needs to get it together!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=80

Lesley H.,"Elk Grove, CA",270,161,65,1.0,9/14/2012,"Red Robin Breakdown: THE FOOD: Red Robin is a chain and has pretty much standardized its food.  It's very heavy burgers with steak fries.  Mine were greasier than usual though at this location. THE VALUE:  About $8-10/burger, $3-7 drinks THE EXPERIENCE:  I moved to Ventura about two months ago.  I used to frequent the Red Robin in Santa Clara in NorCal.   **However,  at this location I had a terrible server.  Her name was SANDY.  She was rude and actually made fun of me.  We were seated at the booths near the bar.  I ordered a turkey burger and made sure there was no cheese on it (I can't eat cheese) and a rootbeer float.  When she came to take the order, I was reading the nutrition facts (this information will become relevant later). Sandy went to the bar to ask for my rootbeer float.  While there, she chatted with the bartender (another girl).  She mocked me and said ""I'll have a turkey burger, with no cheese, sauce on the side, and no bun....make it really healthy and then order a FATTENING rootbeer float.""  She was so loud and laughed, while having the audacity to call me ""stupid"" and ""picky."" I was really appalled by this behavior and lack of respect.  I understand the irony of ordering a healthier choice and adding a rootbeer float, but I feel that it is my five-ten extra minutes of cardio that I have the right to decide on.  It is certainly not appropriate to mock or openly complain about customers, especially with them present. For the record, I have enjoyed Red Robin in the past at other locations.  This was my first time at this location.  I enjoy the atmosphere and most of the food.  I might return to this location, but I'd be sure to request any server OTHER THAN SANDY.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=100

The server was really nice, so that made up for it a little bit. When I came back about three weeks later, I ordered the onion ring tower and a basket of zucchini sticks and mozzarella sticks. The zucchini sticks were sub par, I'd say, since they were really watery, and the batter kept falling off. Meh. The mozzarella sticks were standard, pretty good. And the onion rings, yum.

Amy B.,"San Buenaventura (Ventura), CA",11,9,8,1.0,9/17/2015,"We have been loyal customers and neighbors to the Pacific View mall for many years and have always enjoyed eating at Red Robin.  Most the time the food is great, service is never over the top and typically mediocre, but doable.  This week we came in with a party of 11 for my daughters birthday and over half of that party were children in the family.  The meal was good and the service was the same as always, mediocre.  The strange part came toward the end of our meal when we were paying our bills and the kids were enjoying time together.  The mamas and one grandmother were also enjoying some much needed conversation too.  The manager (didn't get his name) came up to us and asked if he could ""bribe"" us over to the back table with all the children because they needed to clean the table.  We happened to be in the middle of a conversation and he completely interrupted us and asked us to move 6 children.  I asked him to please respect our conversation and let him know that it would be too hard to move 6 children to the back of the establishment and that we were paying customers who had the same opportunity as everyone else to sit as long as we wanted at the table we paid to eat at.  To give him a little grace, he did apologize to us and told us he wasn't kicking us out (lol) but it was so awkward at that point we stopped our conversation and left.  It was such a rude way to end a wonderful Bday for my 9 year old.  He was super awkward.  We were disappointed.  The kids played with balloons together outside.  The end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=120

Garrett M.,"Camarillo, CA",70,52,1,3.0,12/1/2011,"A couple friends and I went in last night for dinner around 6:00. We were seated but no drink orders were taken. We waited about 5 minutes then a server came and asked if we were ready to order! We hadn't even gotten a drink order in yet but because of that time we were indeed ready to  order. He seemed new, like we were the first table he had ever waited on and we could see it, so I decided to be nice and clear and give him a good customer experience so he can get some more practice. After he fumbled to get our order down and awkwardly offered us specials, my friend told me that he had been in 2 months prior and this guy hadn't improved! Two months, at least, and he still comes off as a beginning server! Not good. Either he doesn't get it or he is playing some sort of ""if I look new they tip better"" king of thing but we weren't buying it.  One of my friends ordered a salad with his meal. So he came back about 5 minutes later with our drinks, no salad. I  knew that when he wrote ""salad"" at the bottom of his ticket that it wouldn't come out first...remember folks, drinks, apps, salads go on top of the ticket! So we sat, no salad, no fries to get us started.  Then our server spent some time talking to what looked like his family at another table, then we watched him scramble around and finally 20 minutes later our food came out, salad included. Now, here's a simple concept. Salad is cold, burger is hot. Generally people like to eat their salad BEFORE their burger. This way the burger doesn't get COLD sitting on the table while someone eats their salad. Well, the salad came with the burgers and my friend ate probably three bites of his salad before moving to the rapidly cooling burger.  Did I mention we still had no place settings? Right, no place settings. We had to ask a very hard working busser for settings, which he got swiftly....a few minutes later our server brings settings.... It was not great. The food was good for what it is and I love the concept of bottomless fries but the service was really lacking. Little care, little training, not attentive enough. I have been here before and had a much better experience but not 4 star worthy, I am afraid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=120
Martin J.,"Irvine, CA",149,106,44,3.0,12/27/2011,"Have to admit that I was impressed by Red Robin. Normally, chain restaurants inside malls are bland and boring for all the flare they try to convey. Although this restaurant reminds me of the one in the movie Office Space, this Red Robin had some delicious hamburgers. I ordered the Sautéed 'Shroom Burger that was juicy with tender meat, and my girlfriend ordered the Guacamole Bacon Burger and she loved it. We both enjoyed the bottomless fries that were warm and crispy.  My only complaint is on the service. We were sitting at the bar that had two other people. The restaurant was busy but not full and the bar area could fit upwards of 11 people. The bartenders were friendly and cheerful but they would take FOREVER to get me my first beer. The bartenders were walking right by us time after time without asking what I wanted to drink. When they finally took my order they took another eternity to get my drink. I was kind of annoyed because my hamburger arrived with my first beer and I like to have a drink before the food arrives while I'm conversing.  The food was great, but the bar service is quite slow. They were friendly, but maybe it was an off night. I'll be returning in the near future and hopefully I have a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=120
Gil A.,"Oxnard, CA",17,13,1,4.0,11/19/2011,"My friend and I were looking for a place that had happy hour past the usual 3-7pm or 4-7pm and we found Red Robin's. Their happy hour is from 3-6pm and 8pm-closing and that is why we went there because it was already 8pm. We are greeted as soon as we get in there, which was good because some other restaurants do not greet. We are told that we can be seated asap because even though there are a lot of people waiting outside, but that was because they were big parties and we declined because we were looking to go for their happy hour and decide to go to their bar. The thing I did not like about the bar was that it was just sitting at the bar, they did not have tables specifically for the bar because it was used for dining. Other restaurants do have specific bar sections with tables, but this place did not so that was something I disliked. After seeing this, we decide we want to be seated at a booth somewhere. We go back to the hosts and ask to be seated instead. We were seated quickly. We were served quickly and our server was very friendly and helpful. I'd give her a 10 out of 10 for being a great server. Their happy hour was a good deal. My friend and I both ordered pints of Blue Moon, which was really good. I then ordered a rum with coke, which happened to taste like nothing but coke. There was hardly any rum. I would have preferred a Blue Moon again because I definitely enjoyed that more than the rum and coke.  Overall, great hosts, server, and environment for a Friday night. I would definitely go back there for probably the only happy hour around here that starts at 8pm.  One more thing, they need to put better bathroom deodorants or something because it sure smelled bad, tis why I held my pee till I got home because I did not want to go back in there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=120

She returned with a receipt and said you get 20% off. I was glad and ordered a little more than usual, because, why not, I had 20% off.  At the end of the meal, rat weasel, aka the manager approached my table and said how was everything. I replied good. He continued to say""  what is that slip of paper on your table is it okay if I look at it."" Of course I agreed, and then he continued to say you can only use this at lunch time. I responded that I asked the waitress prior to placing my order and she said that I had a 20% off. Rat weasel decided to just run off into the kitchen with plates  which is probably a better position for him as a busboy than a manager seeing as he has zero customer service skills.

Mikey M.,"Ventura, CA",26,26,18,3.0,11/16/2014,"Hit or miss. Just like the Tale of Two Cities,  it was the best of times,  it was the worst of times. Sometimes the customer service is exceptionally horrible as other times it can be remarkably satisfying.  Sometimes the food comes out all together as other times it will take a while for each item.  Therefore some dinners will eat and be done with their food before the others receive theirs. The bartending has slumped over the last year. Tasting watered down mixed drinks or missing two inches of beer is unsettling.  In addition to seeing your drink waiting to be brought to you as your thirst increases as the drink continues to get warm, the food temperature sometimes feels as if it might fall into the danager zone. The overall consistency is less than one would expect and often will leave someone with the question ""is it really worth dinning here"".

Brandon S.,"Olympia, WA",243,479,258,4.0,9/18/2007,"Red Robin was one of my favorite restaurants growing up , but for a period of a few years there, it seemed like it was starting to go downhill rapidly.  The classics were still there, but the quality was starting to slip and the menu had grown stale and uninteresting.  But they have made a concerted effort to improve and it shows.  I have been really impressed with my meals on my last few visits.  The quality of the ingredients is back and better than ever and they have added some truly innovative burgers and sandwiches to their menu including a turkey burger that has pickled onions and goat cheese with avocado on it that looked very good.  You don't see that combination in chains too often.  I had the Burger Parmigiana - a burger on ciabatta bread with  onions and peppers, a fried mozzarella round (basically a round cheese stick) topped with marinara sauce - and it was delicious.  I've never seen fried cheese on a burger before but I wish I could see it more often.  It was also served with their steak fries covered in garlic and parmesan, as if their steak fries needed any improvement.   My wife had my long time favorite, the California Chicken Burger - chicken, guacamole, bacon, lettuce, tomato - and it was fresh and good as always.     Now if only they would work on updating their decorations a bit.  The Ventura location looks particularly old and it doesn't help that this is one huge, totally open restaurant while a lot of the other ones are a bit more cozy.   Also, they close at 9:00 and we came in at 8:00 and were made to feel weird about it.  The staff was obviously in cleanup and go home mode instead of service mode.  There ended up being five or six groups including a family of eight that came in after us.   I guess they jinxed themselves, serves them right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=140

Arnold W.,"Irvine, CA",709,1580,989,3.0,4/16/2008,"I loved this place in the OC because of the bottomless fries. So I excitedly invited my family to eat here at Pac View Mall. It was just okay for me. My family wasn't very impressed. Just average, nothing special here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=160
Arlene A.,"Santa Barbara, CA",66,3,,4.0,1/13/2013,"I love the buzzard wings that Red Robin makes, the wing sauce is delicious, I like to dip my fries in ranch followed by the wing sauce. The only reason that it is four stars instead of five is that sometimes the waiters/waitresses take a long time to bring dips, refills, etc. even when it's not super busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=160
Laurie L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",68,185,242,3.0,4/14/2008,"Lunch at the Red Robin yesterday seemed like a good plan after some dreaded mall shopping..... We were instantly seated at a booth situated directly in front of the entrance, this didn't seem like a bad place to sit at the time.........Every person that entered the doorway after us had to wait a very long time before being noticed, sometimes people would stack up in pairs and peer in with angry expressions making it kind of uncomfortable (I've seen hungry people do crazy things before) The worse part was that this was a slow period for them and they clearly were staffed properly, it was poor management! One time the manager breezed right pass two waiting couples to go say hi to someone, leaving the waiting customers standing there 5 more minutes until the hostess wandered out to seat them. Our server was nice but really blew it twice, we asked if they had sliders? (even explained what they were) His response: No, but when I worked at Marie Calender's they had them there (nice, but we're not there are we?) OK, no big deal, we placed our order and waited......... While waiting for our order I noticed a huge banner placed pretty high up on the wall promoting their new SLIDERS in fact as I looked around there were little promos everywhere!!!! LOL, we had a good laugh and decided to not even mention it. I ordered the Cobb salad, my sister ordered the soup and salad combo and for the sake of being a little bad, we decided to split an order of their steak fries smothered in Red Robin salt.   After 35 minutes had passed and just being served beverages we started peering around with angry expressions too(after all it's really just salads so what's the hold up?). Our server finally appeared at our table to inform us that he messed up and has now sent our order to the kitchen and he will, ""throw rocks at them to make them move faster"" what? After another 20 minutes our food arrives but the waiter forgets the fries and after being reminded brings them last.   The food was good, we enjoyed it, but the service is part of the package and it really could have been so much better. Lastly, the restroom was filthy, it smelled absolutely horrible, and to make matters worse they were out of seat liners and hand towels which BTW were all over the floor. When was the last time anyone cleaned the bathrooms??? No excuse for sloth, ever! Minus 3 stars for really poor management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=160
Brian S.,"Camarillo, CA",168,234,74,4.0,2/9/2008,"Red Robin is a national, family-friendly, chain specializing in everything a typical Red Blooded American could want: Lots of fatty foods and carbs to make you feel fat and happy at the end of the meal.  Many varieties of hamburgers, fries and shakes grace the two page menu allowing people to eat more calories in one meal than many people in third world countries will eat in their lifetime. Souring you on the obesity potential of this restaurant is not what I want to do though. They do have lighter fare on the menu too, but if that's too healthy for you, they can fatten them up by adding real bacon bits or even slices of fried chicken, not to mention the salad dressings.   In health-conscious California you would think that this chain wouldn't be doing too well, but apparently Ventura residents like their Red Robin. I do too actually. It's a great family place, with a good kids menu and healthy options for everyone... if you know how to order correctly. Today the kids split a fish and chips and my wife and I split the cobb salad with dressing on the side. We all shared everything though. Sure, I've been here and ordered one of the special burgers with onion rings and a strawberry shake, but once I turned 30 my metabolism slowed to a tricycle speed. I'd have to run a hundred miles to burn off that many calories now. To be healthy when you order, make sure to ask how things are made and if there are any healthy options, like the garden burger mentioned in other reviews. The waitress we had was very accommodating with our requests (dressing on the side and splitting entrees) . So go and have a burger every once in a while, but if you can't handle the fat or the carbs, they can help you out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=160
Kristie S.,"Ventura, CA",33,203,23,4.0,1/24/2008,"Red Robin is one of my family's favorite restaurants.  When we're all bickering because everybody wants something different, we go to Red Robin and everyone's happy.  Even my picky daughter.  My favorite thing at RR is the seasoned fries.  Mmmmmm.  And I like that I can order any burger with a gardenburger instead of meat.  The servers are always friendly and helpful.  And how cool is it to be able to drink a couple beers and then go shopping in the mall?!?  Makes my crappy little mall a bit more enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=160
