Carrisa S.,"North York, Toronto, Canada",0,10,9,5.0,9/11/2017,I ordered the whisky river BBQ beef burger and it was perfect! It was fully cooked and the meat was tender.

Mister C.,"Victoria, Canada",0,37,,2.0,1/5/2018,"I really like Red Robin, growing up I had a lot of friends who worked at a different location so I've been a lot. I have also visited this location quite a few times in recent times and have been pretty satisfied. However this past visit was a bit disappointing, there must have been no manager present or something during a slow time. Food took forever and was wrong, poutine was tiny. Basic drinks were never filled, ever. Expediter brought food and the waitress never really checked on us after. Staff were chatting like crazy in the back instead. If I hadn't had good experiences here before I would have given one star. I've worked as a bartender and server before so I have a general expectation of service, this didn't even come close. A very disappointing experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria
Cathryn M.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",123,15,1,2.0,11/1/2017,"Came here for my husbands birthday... sadly disappointing.  Food was good but service was lacking.  We were sat after just a few minutes but once sat had to wait 20 + minutes (20 minutes was from the time I started timing it).  Our server finally got to our table (probably just came from dinner himself) and seemed very hurried.  Our order was simple ... kids corn dogs with oranges ... burger for my husband and I.  Drinks came out and we waited another 15 minutes for food.  By the time the food came the drinks were gone... no refills.  The server also put in the wrong order and our daughter got fries instead of the oranges she ordered.  After getting our food, we didn't see our server for a good ten minutes as we sat patiently waiting for refills and napkins.   Not sure why, but the server seemed very preoccupied and seemed to forget us over in the corner.  We finally complained... and our bill came quickly after.  Did I mention it was my husbands birthday?  They sang happy birthday to two other tables but not the sad corner table....  We usually get good service here but something was off ... maybe next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria

Helia S.,"Downtown, Victoria, Canada",14,1,,1.0,8/31/2017,"Really Poor service and rude staff . They texted us wrong twice ,when we got back they told us to wait for another 20-40minutes.

Jana B.,"Richmond, Canada",2,118,39,2.0,3/20/2017,"March 20 2016. I came here with my family of 5 because my seven year old daughter loves Red Robin and since we are in Victoria on for vacation, I thought it would be a nice surprise for her. The wait to be seated was fairly quick considering it was 6 pm. The server who was assigned to us was flustered, absent minded and would later become abrupt and rude. The adults ordered first and then the kids, both ordered a kids' meal. My oldest daughter hadn't finished placing her order when she moved on to my other kid. When the food came the server forgot the dip for the carrots and the kids drinks. Instead of saying something diplomatic, she said they never ordered drinks, then asked them what they wanted. Both kids specified no ice and both drinks came back with what looked like extra ice. My kids speak English and were very clear, so that wasn't the problem. During our meal the server comes in with the bill, we are still eating dinner, she does not ask them about what sundae they want or if us adults want dessert. Annoyed I asked her if they still have dessert included in the kids meal. The kids ordered the same sundae and my husband asked if they want different flavours. The server cuts in and says ""I heard them, they both want chocolate"". I hate tension and I don't consider myself or my family difficult customers, but I could feel the tension from the moment the server took our orders, it was uncomfortable. Didn't tip and won't be coming back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria
Rachel C.,"Ottawa, Canada",0,5,7,1.0,12/21/2016,It was okay but the patty tasted like cardboard and the salad was dripping with dressing. The only good thing was the gluten free bun. We won't be going back. I prefer places like bin 4 or original Joe's. Their quality is spot on.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria
Rose P.,"Victoria, Canada",9,1,,4.0,6/17/2017,I love this place and the people are very friendly and they make you feel great on your birthday and the free dinner and ice cream is awesome.

Rasheed B.,"Vancouver, Canada",117,104,328,4.0,12/15/2015,"One of my daughter's favourite places to visit as a family.  Other than having to wait sometimes before getting seated, the service is always fast & the food tasty.  Can't go wrong with any of their burgers and they also have a large selection of adult drinks. With bottomless fries (yam one's too) and unlimited refills on selected refreshments this is a go to place after some afternoon shopping in the area.  Excellent choices for the kiddos!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria

Stephanie D.,"Victoria, Canada",108,142,330,4.0,7/25/2016,"Always enjoy coming here for some tasty burgers. They've also got some of the best bottomless coffee in my opinion! Nutritionally, these burgers are not your friend, however if you use the online nutritional calculator you can customize your burger so you won't feel as guilty by the end of your meal. I got the chicken teriyaki on whole wheat, minus the mayo, provolone instead of swiss, and added guac. It was by no means mind blowing, but definitely delicious for when you're out and wanting a burger made to order! Do NOT omit the grilled pineapples... they ARE the burger!!!!! Delicious and juicy. The service here is what amazes me most. Mike was our server and he was super friendly, personable, attentive, and made our time here really memorable! In all, burgers are good, price is fair, atmosphere is kid-friendly, and you'll have a good time. The biggest perk is the bottomless coffee and fries along with the nutritional calculator you won't get if eating somewhere that isn't franchised like red robins.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria
Josh V.,"Victoria, Canada",44,48,13,2.0,3/27/2016,"I like Red Robin as much as the next guy, but their newly renovated decor is A-W-F-U-L.  They took this nice big, bright open space and closed it off with walls and tinted glass; turning it into a dark, grey, and blood red moody nightmare. The whole area is depressing and awkward.  It's trying to be something it's not, and is almost reminiscent of the decor at Browns in Langford (but more closed off). They took what was unique and fun (and kid friendly) about Red Robins and utterly killed it.  Wouldn't be surprised if it hurt their business. I certainly won't be back as much. There are much nicer environments close by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria
Robb T.,"Victoria, Canada",0,22,,2.0,11/15/2016,"I used to enjoy this location of Red Robin.  My last two visits have had the worst service I've experienced in Victoria lately so I won't be going back again.  Bottomless sides are meaningless if your server never checks back.  Drinks also sat empty.  Server ACTIVELY AVOIDED eye contact with me.  Long wait to place order, receive food, and get check.  Hostess was stupider than a potted plant.  I guess this is what minimum wage gets you in Victoria now?  Let me know when you fire your management and get some qualified staff in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria
Tasa M.,"Victoria, Canada",0,11,2,1.0,1/11/2017,"Got food posining from here. On top of it, they didn't really handle with it when I told them. They said 'it happens sometimes'. Which is true. I have heard a lot of people getting food posining from here. Mine was from an uncooked ground beef burger. My friend had her food poisoning from chicken. This place needs to be inspected!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria
Jenna J.,"Victoria, Canada",8,20,1,2.0,10/18/2014,"Took the kiddos to Red Robin tonight for the first time in over a year.  Things have changed!  I watched as servers pushed hard to flip their tables, no one was clearing their own dishes in our section (a guy with a bus bin came and cleared each heaping mess once the guests were gone) and our server in particular seemed extra keen on getting us out. Not one coffee refill offered, but she was in a mad rush to drop the kids' sundaes off while they were still eating their mains and dropping the bill then waving the debit machine in my face.  The machine itself automatically gave the tip options of 15/20/40(?!)percent or 'Other'.  A little presumptuous, Red Robin?   I know volume is high but I've never before felt like a head in a herd of cattle being led in and out like tonight. Oh, and my burger was thin and scorched, but It wasn't the worst thing I've ever had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria
Nick C.,"Richmond, Canada",1,38,68,4.0,4/15/2013,"Red Robin is a burger chain restaurant. I suppose they have other things besides burgers, but the main attraction are the burgers. I find Red Robin solid and tasty. It might never be your favourite place, but it's convenient, consistent and average price. You're looking at about $12-14 for a burger/fries meal. The fries are ""bottomless"" although I'm usually full after the burger and first order of fries. They have many different things you can add to your burger as well as replacing the bun with lettuce. (warning: that will make it even more messy). My favourite and the reason that I seem to go back is the fried egg. I wish more places gave the option of an egg in our burger. They really go well together. Some people really like their onion rings, but I find them too bready for me. Service is usually pretty good. Friendly and polite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria
JeanMarc C.,"Winnipeg, Canada",3,3,2,1.0,8/23/2016,"Our food was awful. Our service was awful. I would never recommend this place to anyone.  The food didn't look anything like the menu. I asked for extra lettuce with my burger. It had almost none. I had to ask for extra lettuce. When my burger came out it had like 8 fries. It's supposed to come with unlimited fries. I don't want to have to ask for fries every 2 minutes. My wife's meal was missing salsa and taco chips. It couldn't of been any worse. We wanted more coke, so we left our glasses at the end of the table. She asked us if we wanted more after we were finished dinner. What a joke. It's like they were trying to save on their over head. This place desperately needs better management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria
Warren E.,"Capital Regional District, Canada",0,30,,4.0,4/28/2015,"This is still my Goto place for a burger craving.  While I occasionally try something different it is usually the Whiskey River Beef Burger for me.  The sauce is perfect and it always hits the spot.  I still think they should have a choice of different type of fries at a burger speciality place but the volume of business they do here shows they don't need to.  This particular location is always consistent great quality and service with plenty of free refills on your drinks.  Get a couple extra napkins, not a neat meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria?start=20
Sergey A.,"Toronto, Canada",0,16,2,2.0,12/24/2015,"The service is good, but the food is below average.

Diana L.,"Victoria, Canada",12,231,33,3.0,10/27/2013,"Red Robin is always a sure place for a burger and fries . . . .  For the past 20 years I've enjoyed stopping in on the way to something, and I always order the Whiskey River BBQ chicken burger and French fries.   The burger is yummy and big.  The onion straws, and lettuce and tomato make it ""big"".  Not as big as it used to be years ago, but still filling.  The bun is always fresh. The ad pictures never show it rightly - it looks bigger on the menu and in the ads.  But it is prepared as taste expected. The fries are Beefeater.  Not my favourite size, because they are always too soft fried for my preference.   Seasoning salt available on the table is a good idea.   Filling - and even though they are bottomless, I have never needed to ask for a second serving.   Good to know you can ask if you are still hungry. Excellent value, price wise.  Great service on this visit. Usually a line up, so the secret is - ask to be seated at the bar and you will get in near instant.  Not at the bar, but at a table in that area, with the tall seats and tall table, otherwise perfectly fine if you are OK without a booth and don't have kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria?start=20
John B.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,12,6,4.0,9/5/2013,Since leaving this review a member of the Red Robin's team has contacted me to resolve the issue.

Leanne A.,"Indio, CA",10,5,,4.0,7/11/2016,great food - fantastic waiter - don't bother ordering the $16.50 smoke and pepper burger.. not much different from the regular $10.99 burger... patty was identical... not worth the $5.00 up charge!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria?start=20
Jen S.,"Montreal, Canada",0,3,,4.0,1/8/2015,"I agree with Nancy A...good gluten free burgers!  The server was super friendly and knowledgeable about gluten free eating.  I ordered a burger with guacamole and she immediately knew the spice mix in the guac had wheat, and offered to substitute with sliced avacado.  They even have gluten free beer to go with your burger!  I would recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria?start=20
Mark M.,"Victoria, Canada",7,128,1,4.0,2/18/2014,"While the food here is middle of the road, where it excels is as a kid friendly place.

Rich B.,"Vancouver, Canada",31,195,42,3.0,1/3/2012,"If you have read any of my other reviews, you will be familiar with my appreciation for Red Robin. It goes as far as acknowledging that, in general, they make tasty burgers and serve them before my kids have time to lose patience and start destroying the place (their first target typically being the sanity of fellow diners). The fact that they do this in locations as diverse as Vancouver, North Vancouver, Coquitlam and now Victoria, is a bonus. But it just about stops there. My only experience of this particular branch was not a great one. Unfortunately we picked the table with the novice wait staff so service was either frustratingly erratic or charmingly eclectic depending on the pink your spectacles are. To give them credit, though, the food was consistently adequate. At the end of it all the somewhat fraught-looking manager did give us a hefty discount for the inconvenience so I feel that were I to return I could reasonably expect a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria?start=20
Nancy A.,"Victoria, Canada",0,25,,4.0,9/12/2014,Red Robin has the best gluten-free burgers in town.  (if not the hemisphere).  They have super safe practices so you can be sure that you won't be poisoned by gluten.  This place is super for children and families.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victoria?start=20
K W.,"Victoria, Canada",0,21,8,4.0,8/5/2011,"Red Robin is a generic chain restaurant that specializes in burgers and it's a good thing because their burgers are quite good. I ordered a Red Robin version of a cheese burger and it arrived with fresh toppings and a red relish that was sweet and delicious. The fries were wide cut, plain and possibly frozen. They were good, but nothing special. There was a spice shaker at the table for those that like their fries spicy - I didn't try it. They were bottomless - good if you like the fries. I went with a friend's family so there were kids. Everyone enjoyed their food. The kids et al had fancy tootie frutti drinks and shakes. The shakes were large and the left overs came home with us.

Laurel G.,"Shawnigan Lake, Canada",15,4,5,5.0,8/1/2011,"Let me start by saying I will definitely come back!!!  I am a VERY picky eater and unfortunately cannot find very many restaurants on the Island that I enjoy eating at. In fact I will drive from the Cowichan Valley to either Nanaimo or Victoria to find somewhere to eat. A friend of mine always raves about the burgers so we decided to try it as the the restaurant we had originally planned to go to was closed.  PROS:  Unlimited fries come with your burger  You can customize your burger's toppings and bun and even go bun-less and have it wrapped in lettuce  I had the Blackened chicken Burger with extra Buzzard sauce and wrapped in lettuce and made my fries poutine and my husband got the Red's Chili Chili Burger and went back for seconds on his fries. Both of us were very satisfied with our selection, though I wish I had more room for seconds on the poutine. When my husband's second fries came out there were perfectly crisp and hot - obviously made to order. The waitress was pleasant and came back several times to check on us (fully deserving the nice tip we left). When we needed refills of pop and weren't able to catch the eye of our waitress, another one came by and refilled them. Also, the busboy was so efficient that our table was cleared of our plates within a few minutes of finishing our meal - which was nice being at a small table for 2.  All in all, I was thoroughly satisfied with our happenstance visit to Red Robin and look forward to trying other burgers on future visits.

The response was oh sorry; and she started to leave. I asked her to pass my concern along. When I heard nothing I asked what the response was. I was told they said they would try not to do it again.

There's nothing fancy or special about eating at Red Robin's - it's just casual, family dining but they do that reasonably well. I've eaten tonnes of burgers that were better and tonnes of burgers that were worse, Red Robin's is right in the middle and does a nice job satisfying a craving with solid service. They would get a 4 if they added a pole in the middle of the place and added some dancers.
