Not cool because we are definitely frequent customers. (That's why I'm taking a Star away) Love the happy hour wings! Burgers are great and beer is always a plus.

Willy O.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",12,67,,3.0,9/3/2016,"Went there last night for a meal as I was in the area taking care of some business. Got seated within 10 minutes. Christina was the waitress. Very pleasant woman and eager to make sure everything was ok. Placed the drink order. Got a serving of fries while waiting and placed the food order. Food came out after a bit. I got the Chili Chili Cheese Burger. I was a bit disappointed in the burger. There was some chili on it, but nothing as claimed on the menu. I hate to say it, but I've had better chili cheese burgers at some off beat places like Apollo Burger. The fries at RR are always good. I like the larger thicker cut fries. I also like to add the Red Robin seasoning to my fries. The drink was great. It was the raspberry cream. Christina even made sure that I got one to go.  Gave a 3 star based on Christina, the fries and the drink. If it weren't for those 3, I would have left something far less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville?start=20

Kenneth P.,"Hesperia, CA",5,44,44,2.0,10/23/2015,"I've been to plenty of Red Robin's and even this one several times. It's normally a pretty decent experience aside from the fact that you are grossly overpaying for burgers and fries. Tonight however was not a good experience. Our server didn't know what he was doing, that was obvious from the get go. We had to ask for everything, even napkins and utensils.       So I order the chili chili cheese burger as I often do. Now, keep in mind, they have the nerve to say chili twice in the name, like you're actually going to get a scoop of chili on your burger at the very least, not to mention this is a $11 burger. The menu also says ""served open face with chili piled high."" Like I said, I've been to plenty of Red Robin's and order this often and that's normally what you get. Tonight my burger was almost void of chili at all. The wife and I also ordered 2 of the most expensive drinks on the menu, only to be duped into buying  $16 worth of ice.        I'll be back to Red Robin, but probably not this one for a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville?start=20

Miguel B.,"CA, CA",310,19,3,1.0,4/23/2016,"The only redeeming portion of our meal was the server Stephanie. She went out of her way to fix the screw ups of the mental giant & Michelin rated cook working the grill. I state this as she had to send the burger we ordered back twice as apparently the company doesn't provide training as to what ""medium rare"" is. Both times the burger was cooked to death and had the mouth feel of going down on a corpse.  After 2 fails she went out her way to apologize for the situation which was not her fault, and comped the entrée. It was a sad situation that she did this on her own, given this was a text book situation for the manager to handle however, management must have been busy handling all 14 customers in the entire restaurant at that time.

Went straight to the bar area and my friend and I seated ourselves.  We were greeted quickly and our drinks were brought to us in about a minute.  We knew what we wanted and ordered without menus. The meals were brought to us in about 6 minutes. Very fast. I asked for BBQ sauce and the waitress brought me the BBQ sauce and ranch dressing. So glad she read my mind because I'm an idiot, I meant to order ranch not BBQ sauce. She kept our drinks full and checked on us just the right amount of times. We finished our food and drinks, but stayed an extra hour catching up because we hadn't seen each other in a while. Staff was super friendly and didn't try to push us out. Absolutely loved it and will definitely return soon.  Food was great. I ordered the BBQ chicken wrap with endless fries. One serving of fries was enough though.  Join the rewards club.

Rick C.,"Los Angeles, CA",87,25,71,4.0,8/5/2014,Yesterday visited the Victorville location as Red Robin indicates it can accommodate food allergies such as Celiac.   This location along with the Apple Valley one are far from this.   1) when asking for an allergy menu they provided a business card with a bar code that must be scanned for the menu 2) the potential food with allergy is supposed to be cooked and prepared separately to avoid cross contamination.  The food came out on the same service as other food with cross contamination 3) the manager is supposed to bring out the food which did not happen Service was barely knowledgable and did not do a great job.  We waited 24 minutes for drinks from the bar.  The lunch was also slow.    Will not come back as my wife did become glutenized. 8/5 update.    After contacting Red Robin they have helped restore trust by taking immediate customer action. I have spoken with a Regional Manager and he has spoken to the local sites.   He was understanding and thoughtful.  While it maybe a bit before we are back I am impressed at the corporate customer service.  Confidence renewed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville?start=40
Alvina H.,"Adelanto, CA",15,80,42,3.0,7/31/2014,"Since moving to the mall location, service and food has been hit and miss.  Servers always seem rushed or stressed or something.  Can't quite pinpoint it.  None of the old wait staff transferred to the new location.  Unfortunate because they had several great waiters/waitresses. Most of the time the food is served up correctly and at the proper temperature.  If they feel that you've been waiting too long and appear irritated, they'll off you a basket of fries. ? During the summer, sitting alongside the windows that open inward is a nice touch.  We generally sit in the bar because one can feel forgotten when sitting in the main restaurant area.  I do like the addition of the all-you-can-eat broccoli.  Kudos for this.   Entrance/Exit by the bar is a bit awkward as it's one pathway for both.  Someone needs to check on the ADA requirements of that.   p.s.

There wasn't the normal 4 or 5 like other restaurants, there was about 8 or 9 , enough to share with my friends. The burger was very tastey, you can't go wrong with a bacon cheeseburger!

Katherine V.,"Victorville, CA",2,9,1,1.0,7/31/2015,To start my review off Lalo the front door greeter that takes names completely ignored us as we walked in and 2 other parties walked in after us he literally ignored us told them there wait would be 5 minutes and told us our wait would be 10 to 15 minutes how? When we were ahead of them! I hope the food is good or else Lalo might just make red robin lose our business I might just have to make a trip to fudgeruckers in Ontario.

John M.,"Victorville, CA",8,4,,1.0,9/2/2015,Why has every Red Robin become a Sports Bar? Why must they 'push' booze? Why do they lead us to the 'bar' area without asking?

William W.,"Adelanto, CA",0,8,,3.0,10/12/2015,"Nothing has ever tasted ""badly"", but nothing is ever too far above ""average"", and if it weren't for bottomless fries (If/when they are a fresh, generous portion) there are far better places to eat the same type of food for the money. For burgers, as this is the namesake: Stick to the ""Reds Tavern Burger"", or Reds Tavern Double"" as its the same taste and fills you up just as much as the so called ""gourmet"" burgers, but for a few dollars less. Skip the overpriced soft drinks and appetizers, and don't bother with the cheap tasting salads.   If you're dying for a good salad for dinner, swing by Dennys (not joking)...They have a prime rib (or chicken) salad with spring mix (can be subbed for romaine, which Red Robin doesn't offer), and generous portions of toppings for around $9 or $10 bucks and less expensive drinks. The Red Robin salads don't even measure up. Please don't waste time and money in this area of the menu. Spend $10 or less on your entree, be sure your meal comes with bottomless fries,  and you most likely will get your dollars worth. Service is acceptable, but like the food, can be very inconsistent... Once I was seated, with my party of 3 and weren't addressed at all for over 20 minutes (not really busy, and many servers walking by).  Needless to say. We left. Other times I've been met with friendly, attentive staff who seem to know their menu, but have hesitated to ""recommend"" anything, commenting that it's hard to do so knowing how much certain items cost.

Ian L.,"Apple Valley, CA",196,20,1,1.0,3/23/2016,"I arrived there wanting my usual endless root beer float. The waitress informed me that she couldn't make it because her ice cream machine was broken. She can't make anything with ice cream. In fact, it's been broken for over two weeks and she doubts it will ever be fixed. She told me that every time it is used, metal shavings go into the ice cream. Fine, ice cream maker is on the fritz, I get it. Then why is it that she was able to make 3 ice cream sundaes and serve them to tables around me? She was also the worst. She brought out my pretzels, forgot the cheese. By the time she gave me the small tub of cheese, the pretzels were cold. The cheese was coagulated. I never got my fries, even when my burger was served. For some reason unknown to me, my fries came after the burger was served. I never got a refill on my glass of water.

He took the kids orders first and did a great job of getting it in.  However, their drinks came out separately.  Some came from a drink station (first), the rest came from the bar.  This gap was separated by at least 10 mins.  Made for unhappy kids (""why did she get hers first..."").  He came back and took the adults orders and drinks.  Most RR would bring out the fries first (since they are bottomless)...we didn't get our fries til after our entrees came out.  When the kids food came out, there were a few mistakes.  NO big deal though.  Biggest deal was the delay between food (since he was the only guy bringing it out).  I can't blame him for our experience, but I expected more from RR.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville?start=40
Jason E.,"Victorville, CA",7,118,284,3.0,1/30/2015,"Got together with friends for my wife's birthday here last night. I've never been a big fan of Red Robin. They change their menu too often (always eliminating my favorite dishes). Most of the menu is now burgers. My wife loves their guacamole bacon burger and seemed to enjoy it greatly. I got a ""black & bleu"" burger, which is one of their ""premium"" burgers. Not impressed. The amount of bleu cheese was minimal and was overshadowed by the pile of grilled onions and mushrooms (anytime bleu cheese plays third fiddle on a dish with bleu in the title, its a bad sign). My daughter had one of the eight actual dinners on the menu; riblets with mac 'n' cheese. She liked it, but didn't love it.  Service was excellent, and there was no wait to seat our party of eight on a Friday evening (you can draw your own conclusions about that). Altogether, the dinner was average for a premium price (if you're charging $15+ for a burger and fries, it needs to be special) and I'm still not a big fan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville?start=40

Dale P.,"Highland, CA",113,83,18,3.0,7/24/2017,"Came here to meet someone. I was in the mood for a decent burger and Red Robin always had a decent burger. Well, that was until tonight. I don't know what it was but the burger I had was sub par. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't what I'm used too getting at Red Robin. I ordered the pepper something or other burger. When the waitress, who did a good job by the way, set it in front of me the very first impression was that the meat looked pale. Unappetizing. RR burgers are a more charbroiled color normally. Nothing else on the burger was appetizing either. I can't put my finger on why, it just was. The taste was ok, but not what I'm used too getting from them. Everything else was ok. Service was good and the place was clean. I would go back and give them another chance. It wasn't a bad experience. More like a little let down. Especially since I chose there to meet because I was in the mood for a decent burger. And for whatever reason I didn't get that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville

Being on a fixed income that was a lot of money wasted.. I'm sorry but won't be going back,  too expensive to eat less than supposedly gourmet food.  Shame on the cook and the management that allowed food to be served that they knew was not  cooked fresh and certainly not up to Red Robin standards.  With all the new restaurants opening,  Red Robin this is not the time to revert to making crap and passing it off as gourmet.   Really wish I had my $55.00 dollars back :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville

Shannon B.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,128,48,1.0,12/28/2016,"If I could give it one star I would. My husband and I were driving from Las Vegas to California so we decided to order take out from here and avoid fast food. I called just as we were leaving Barstow and it said 30 mins on the gps to reach this location. I called and placed the order and the man said it would be ready in about 20-25 mins. I thought perfect. I ordered a salad so even if it sits there for 10 mins it will still be fine. When I arrived I went to the take out section and let the bartender know I had placed an order. He called over another lady who then printed me receipt. I explain I was paying with an E-gift card and she looked at me like she had never heard of such a thing. I explained to her how it works and she left to go process the transaction. She returned 10 minutes later and said one gift card wouldn't work. Finally when the payments went through she left again for another 5 or so minutes only to return to hand me the bag that's been sitting behind the bar the whole time. She starts to walk away forgetting that I ordered drinks. The whole time she is processing my payment and wandering around the bartender is standing there. He could have easily filled the drinks. As she starts filling them slowly they strike up a conversation on how excited they are to have the next 2 days off work and blah blah blah. Look, I've worked in customer service. It's exhausting I get it. But you really aren't busting your ass. Your location was dead when I was there and it took you 15 mins to process my payment and fill 2 drinks. So there conversations in front of a customer was just rude in my opinion. When we finally got on the road I opened up the food boxes and our ""extra order if fries"" was maybe 7 fries in total. Not even a whole potato. I am very disappointed in this visit so unfortunately I will never be back. We make the trip to and from California every other month so this would have been a great stop to fuel up on the drive but it appears we need to find another restaurant. I already posted my experience on social media so my friends who also make this trip regularly know to avoid it if they want a quick experience through the order out menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville

Since I had a gift card, I landed here. Decided to take home the NachosOMG from the bar menu and they didn't disappoint. Plenty of chips, cheese, chili, guacamole, sour cream, salsa, etc. But what was also impressive was the way the to-go-order was put together. Packaged in a nice container, put in a plastic bag with plenty of napkins, plastic forks, spoons and extra salsa.

The decor here is way different than other Red Robins, this one is newer but went for a vintage look with old movie posters and the old logo, not really feeling it. The whole place feels cold and there are so many too small booths, even though I doubt this place really fills up. We went for Jim day since my husbands middle name in James, he got a free Jim Beam burger. It didn't come with any sides, so he ordered the pound of spuds app which turned out to be just a basket of fries, I should have known but was expecting something better. He also got the california chicken sandwich but asked for it fried. The burger was ok, the chicken not so  much. I split two kids meals with my son, the veggie and the boca burgers, since both of those on the kids menu cost the same as the exact same thing on the adult menu. Both were gross, I have had boca and gardenburgers before but these tasted raw and stale, with no flavor whatsoever. The service was pretty much lacking, we had to flag her down for a refill and didn't even bother to ask for a second one. Same with the fries, I asked for a refill twice just to get one basket with about 5 fries for the 3 of us when we were finished eating follwed by the question if we are saving room for dessert, no, well heres your check.

Lorraine A.,"Barstow, CA",5,41,17,3.0,3/8/2014,"My boyfriend and I chose to eat at this location because our friends kept telling us that it was delicious.  They were right about the food.  It was delicious, but the service was HORRIBLE.  We went on a Friday night, which we expected it to be busy.  We got a table under 10 minutes.  The waitress was friendly, but her service was like I said, horrible.  We ordered, received our food and she asked us if we needed anything.  I had asked for another container of ranch, but before I could ask her for silverware, she took off.  We sat there for a good while before she came back - WITHOUT my ranch!  I saw her getting drinks for a few other tables.  I tried to get her attention and was ready to flag down another waitress, but she was busy as well.  FINALLY our waitress comes back and asks if we were ok.  I told her that she forgot my ranch and that we needed to silverware.  We sat there for about 20 minutes without silverware while our food was getting cold.  She never came back to see if we wanted anything else, which we had ordered fries....(Those ohh sooo good fries!)  She however did come back right before we were done to ask if we wanted a refill on our drink.  THEN, she comes back with our bill - which took her another 15-20 min to pick up.  I ALWAYS leave  a big tip because I know how hard waitress/servers work.  I didn't leave her one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville?start=80
Jennifer B.,"Hesperia, CA",24,23,17,1.0,4/19/2014,This place used to have such good service--then they moved across the freeway....They are always crowded nowadays and the restaurant is really cramped.  I feel that the location is pretty but it lost a lot of its original charm..  This last visit we ordered an appetizer and food.  We were sat in a corner and ignored--the upside was that we had a great view of the kitchen and could see our chips and salsa hanging out under hot lights...for 15 minutes...how hard is it to bring out chips and salsa?  That is like a no brainer fast appetizer.  Then our food was placed under said lamps as well.  My husband got up and went into the kitchen area to address the issue with a manager.  Our food was brought out and we were asked if we still wanted our chips and salsa?  What was the point?  The manager explained about a staffing issue and comped our meal as well as gave a gift card for a return visit.  While I appreciate the gesture we haven't been back since.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville?start=80
Samantha S.,"Hesperia, CA",101,70,20,1.0,7/11/2011,"I AM NOT GIVING ALL RED ROBINS THIS ONE STAR RATING, JUST THIS ONE LOCATION. I went here a week ago with my fiance. It was about an hour till closing when we walked in to eat. We stood waiting for someone to seat us for a good 5-10 mins. Finally we are seated in the bar area and observed one waitress at the bar. She took about 10 mins to even greet us and ask for drinks. We waited for 15 more minutes before leaving out the door. She was hanging out letting some other chick grab on her and tell her how much she loves her. Her friends were loud and obnoxious and distracting her from her job. She never brought our drinks after being there for almost a half an hour. Very disappointed and was really craving some of those delicious steak fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville?start=80
Cee M.,"Victorville, CA",4,21,,4.0,4/30/2010,"Always a fan of Red Robin. Love a burger every now and then; they have promotions and if you register online, you'll receive coupons. I got a free burger for my birthday. Servers are really nice. There's a hostess who kinda reminds me of Taylor Swift.  Burgers - most are good depending on your craving  Chipotle chicken salad - good  Fries - order extra crispy, dip in ranch dressing",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville?start=80

T M.,"Hesperia, CA",3,31,13,4.0,10/8/2013,"Red Robin is our 'go-to' place for just a good get together sit down relaxed place :) Very kid friendly a huge plus for our 5 kids :) They even give one free refill on the kids mac n cheese! Bottomless fries, bottomless garlic fries (which was good for my husband since I ate is LOL), bottomless drinks on several different ones. A lot of refills on different foods! Just ask your server its apparently a little known thing with a lot of the foods. I love the fact you can substitute a veggie burger for the regular burgers, I just wish they had a few more Vegetarian options (they used to have a stirfry, but it disappeared off the menu??) Their seasoning is addicting but im sure horrible for you. The atmosphere is fun and lively, tvs on sports, lots of fun stuff to look at on the walls :) A little over stimulating sometimes if your not ready for it lol The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because their burgers are a bit pricey and im holding out that 5th star til they had some more healthy vegetarian options :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville?start=80
Julia E.,"New York, NY",156,24,2,2.0,1/4/2015,"I will not be trying this location next time I'm in California. These two stars are for the nice corporate determined decor and a pleasant host. Key points: do not serve browned, day-old guacamole to three Mexican guests, we are definitely going to send that back in a heart beat. I'd expect an apology at least and move on but our waitress didn't seem to have it in her. Next up, my cousin-in-law (?) ordered a well done bacon cheeseburger ordered that came out with no bacon and rare at best. When she, assuming the best, asked our waitress if it may belong to another table, our waitress responded: ""I put the order in right."" Rude.  Her side of Mac and cheese came out as noodles with a top layer of cheese, nothing delicious to see here. Our wait staff was extremely unapologetic and the manager decided to make up for it by comping my drink (even though my main dish and sides came out just fine) and by showing us the order ticket that had gone to the kitchen to prove that the order was placed correctly. This seemed like a moot point given how the burger actually came out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville?start=80
Kat L.,"Fort Bragg, NC",0,17,4,4.0,11/7/2011,"The food was great...I had the Oktoberfest Burger (which I'm pretty sure is just a seasonal item), and I absolutely loved it.

Ida P.,"Colton, CA",1,13,11,1.0,7/24/2012,"I've been to several Red Robins, but this one is the worst thus far. Not only was their gluten-free menu outdated by several months, but the servers had no idea what requirements are necessary for prepping a gluten-free meal. I ordered a burger without a bun, but my burger came with the bun intact. When I sent it back, instead of receiving a new order, the bun had simply been removed. I could tell because there were traces of bread stuck to the lettuce. Normally I would have returned it a second time, but because of time constraints and hunger, I took off the outer layers of lettuce and ate the ill-prepared burger. Needless to say, I became ill almost immediately after and for several days following that meal. I wish I could say the service was so poor because it was packed, but there was hardly anyone else in the restaurant; we went on a Thursday around 3 in the afternoon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville?start=80
Eric N.,"Orange, CA",34,113,136,3.0,7/24/2007,"Not Bad, But Try Something Else This is another one of those restaurants that I used to visit on a regular basis.  However, everything that applied to my review of the Olive Garden applies here as well.  There are just better places in the same area.  Places where the food is more flavorful, the service is friendlier, and the prices are similar. Now, I normally like the food at Red Robin restaurants, but I had to dock a couple of stars for the last meal I had at this particular branch.  The burger was undercooked and still rather pink the in middle and the waitress got my friend's order completely wrong. While the mistakes would normally be forgivable anywhere else, with more competition in the Mall area, Red Robin really has to step up its game.  Needless to say, I don't plan on eating at this Red Robin again when there are newer, better burger joints nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville?start=100
Dori M.,"Norwalk, CA",0,3,,5.0,4/8/2013,"We showed up (with a reservation of course) with 30+ people. Girls soccer team with 14 teenage girls and parents and siblings in tow.  We were seated almost immediately. Based on experience of going to dinner with this group at other restaurants we prepared for a disaster. We received the complete opposite. They had an area already set up for us and provided two servers Carey and Melinda were awesome. they had us seated and drink orders taken before I could even think about it. Menu's where already on the table and as we were receiving our drinks the two waitresses were half way done taking orders. Our food was good and we got it fairly quick considering the size of our group. They also allowed us to do separate checks with each person on each check at different tables, with no incidents.  which does not ever happen, at least were we have gone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-victorville?start=100
