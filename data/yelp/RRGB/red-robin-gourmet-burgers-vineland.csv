Fernanda L.,"Vineland, NJ",31,46,56,3.0,1/11/2018,"So; I did try again... 2 signature sandwiches for $45 bucks!! All right!! The ""crunchy chicken "" was more like  mushy old cheap nuggets. Fries with hers was great. The buns were greasy. My burger had no seasoning at all... ordered some add one on both; and both came without lettuce and tomatoes  I believe they forgot. I was excited when Jonh the attendant came over to my car and gave me a small fries for the road. But when I got home ... so disappointed!!! Ended up throwing away both buns; the barbecue sauce was way too much and didn't help the mushy chicken....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vineland
Will B.,"Cedarville, NJ",95,20,17,4.0,4/30/2017,"The burgers here are good, not gourmet. Regardless of how many times it's in the menu remember the statement above. This being said, the burgers here are good and so is most of the food. I've read other reviews and it seems like people have no idea what they're ordering. The tavern burgers are thin patties, it's literally in the menu. Service has improved since they opened but could still use improvement. Sometimes it takes a bit to get your order during high volume times. I've been here a bunch of times and in general it's a nice experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vineland
Jared R.,"Rosemead, CA",48,3,1,1.0,3/5/2017,This place hands down has the worst service. Every time I come here I always have an issue. My last visit to this location was the worst. I will never be back and won't recommend this place to anyone I know. On my last visit; I Sat down with my family and waited 15 minutes for the server to take our drink order. There were only 3 other tables occupied in our section. Placed a very simple order and they still managed to screw it up. Had to ask the server several times for drink refills and when she brought them to our table; they were the wrong drinks. My wife asked for fried onions and they charged .75 extra for them. I didn't have a problem with the price except when the burger arrived; there were literally 3 slivers of onions on it. ridiculous!!! Management really needs to do a better job of training their staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vineland
Wayne W.,"Fort Worth, TX",632,482,88,1.0,5/5/2017,"Sorry to say I will never come back to Red Robin again. I am not sure if it is chain change or an individual store change but never again.... while the service was not the worst I had I was very disappointed in the fact that the waitress came over and literally ordered everything on our tablet instead of the old fashion writing it down because honestly for that I could have done it and save my tip. When it comes to the food however this takes the cake.  First they no longer cook burgers to order it's basically medium or above nothing with pink. Second and I kid you not they tasted like frozen patties you can get from the store and not at all like authentic beef that you would expect from a ""burger restaurant"". Beyond that the rest of the food was equally as disappointing.  The shake was very sub par the fries were decent, but honestly they could have been stepped up a notch. I will never come back to Red Robin again and it makes me sad to say so. If I am wrong or if this is just one restaurant out of the chain please let me know as they used to be good and I don't want to give up prematurely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vineland
Mike F.,"Millville, NJ",0,7,,2.0,11/3/2017,"Everything on the table was greesy and nasty, to include the table, seats, condiments, and the wall had food stuffs all over it. The floor was covered as well to the point where your feet would slide all over. Had to be careful getting up to go to tje greesy bathroom. They up charhe everything. Botomless fries are sipposed to make you feel like you are getting a good deal with a $15.00 hamburger. Service was great though!

Lisa K.,"Bridgeton, NJ",62,8,3,1.0,8/2/2017,Very disappointed in our meal my daughter found a hair in her hamburger they charged me for sweet potato fries the waiter told me that it was included in my meal and they originally were trying to charge me for the avocado which ended up being the exact same price that they charge me for the sweet potatoes after they told me that they were going to take it off at the end of the check however they snuck in The price be a sweet potato fries I don't like sneaks!!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vineland
Caitlin N.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,3,1,3.0,12/22/2016,"Hostess was very friendly and informed us of a 10 minute wait which was fine. It was 2:30 on a Thursday and the place wasn't particularly busy.  Our server was very friendly, however extremely inattentive. I had to flag down another waiter, who was standing in the entrance of the kitchen looking around the restaurant extremely bored, and asked him for a 2nd order of fries and a water refill. 20 mins later our assigned waitress came by and we again asked about the fries and she said they would come out asap. 5 mins later they came out, but at that point we were done with our food. The endless fries is what attracted us to Red Robin, however, when the waiters are MIA, there is no way to take full advantage of this. I'm very disappointed with my experience here.  Red Robin is nothing more than a catchy jingle to me, as I would never personally think to go here unless someone else suggested it. There are much better places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vineland
Misty N.,"Vineland, NJ",64,22,,3.0,9/19/2017,It's good for what it is. The burgers are decent. The bar is ok but overpriced. The menu pricing is fair. The staff is friendly but sometimes slow.

Alfredo L.,"Egg Harbor City, NJ",0,6,1,1.0,4/9/2017,"I ordered curbside service at 7:37 pm from a Starbucks within visual distance and was told 15 minutes and to call the number at the slot when we got there so I did at 7:55 and was told by a woman that it wasn't ready yet but when it was they'd bring it right out. I finally called at 8:30 and spoke to a gentleman answered and I explained this to him and he told me that it was ready if I had called the other number and I told him yes and he told me that he didn't get that call and I told him that it was a women earlier. I told him that it was probably cold by now and his response was, ""Well you don't have to take it"" so I didn't.

Robert O.,"Millville, NJ",53,577,284,2.0,8/27/2015,"It's tough when a new restaurant opens around here.  The area is bereft of decent places to dine so the new place is inundated.  We left the first time we arrived as the wait was too long.  We went back a couple days later at lunch.  Even then, the place was jumping. I hope it was just growing pains, but service was lacking.  The waiter was not particularly attentive to our table.  He also confused us as to what we had to order via an electronic device.  We can see the future of when there will be no waiters, only food runners as orders are placed through electronic means. Red Robin is a chain.  We received chain food.  I had the Prime Chophouse burger.  It was fine.  The rest of the party had food that was okay, although my wife wasn't wild about her sandwich.   There isn't much room between the tables.  Service lacked.  That is a familiar theme in this area.  We will give it another try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vineland
Terri C.,"Vineland, NJ",0,5,1,3.0,7/9/2017,"We took the grandkids here for dinner on a Friday night at 4 pm. The hostess brought us to a booth to seat us and the cushion had a foot and a half rip in it that was open at least two inches. Needless to say we asked for a different table. It was quite the ordeal even though there were many empty spots. The hostess gave the impression we were bothering her and said "" they don't want to sit here because they say the seat is ripped."" She never affirmed that the seat was ripped or apologized. The meal was good as always. The only thing was I really wanted a salad and every option had meat. It's really hard for vegetarians or vegans to find decent options when eating out. We went with the veggie burgers which is our best option at this eatery. Our waitress was attentive and the food was good. After a rocky start we had a good meal and a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vineland
Smeagel B.,"Pitman, NJ",3,2,,2.0,4/10/2016,"Disappointed with the service. We ordered dessert, when we told out server it was missing the toppings(whip and cherry) he brought it back with a ridiculous amount of whip all over the plate. I find it plain defying and disrespectful as to saying: ""oh yeah, here's your whip, dick"". It's not my fault someone missed the boat at adding topping to the dessert before running it to the table... Everything else was fine.

I have been back several times with no issues at all. We had dinner in the bar last night to try the Ramen Burger. I had the new Berserker burger. Both burgers were awesome. Our server Danielle S. was fantastic. I have had no issue with servers here at any visit. Danielle was enthusiastic and took care of us well.

Stacy Z.,"Bridgeton, NJ",45,224,2,4.0,2/6/2016,"Food was good and came out as ordered. Got my birthday burger!    It was a standard Red Robin.  I don't love the tablet system because it makes it seem a little more impersonal and I found our server visited our table a lot less.

Mich E.,"Millville, NJ",23,2,,1.0,8/19/2016,My boyfriend and I decided to go here for a lunch date. The place was not busy and we were seated right away. The first table we were brought to had food stuck all over both booth seats. It had obviously not been cleaned. Not to mention there was old food crumbs stuck in the crevices of the seats that have been there quite a while. The hostess brought us to a second table which also had not been cleaned. Completely unacceptable for a sit down restaurant. We walked out and went to Taco Bell.. and even they had cleaner seats.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vineland

When our food arrived, it was barely warm, which to me meant it was sitting there a while.  We asked for it to be addressed and when it was brought back the bun was soggy and felt like the entire thing had just been stuck in a microwave.  I might go back in a few months to see if they have worked out their just opened kinks but...

E F.,"Monroeville, NJ",2,47,9,2.0,9/4/2015,"Came here for lunch last week and the experience was just OK.  Food is your basic run-of-the-mill chain restaurant burgers.  This is pretty much just Chili's/Applebee's/Bennigan's, except it's more annoying and burgers are more expensive.  Waitress explained to us in detail about using the digital ordering screen more than once which I felt was a complete waste of my time and hers.  Didn't appreciate being lectured on how to use the stupid thing.. just let me order my food.   Food was prompt.  I had the patty melt well done on marble rye with their regular fries which were good.  My friend got a plain burger which she enjoyed but she chose to upgrade her regular fries to the sweet potatoe fries which were cold and bland.  These aren't 'gourmet burgers'... they are decent burgers that have fancy toppings and gourmet prices.    We also decided to try the lemon speckle cake they have for desert and that was pretty good.  I noticed they had a lot of different beers/drinks, but I can't imagine going to the bar here as the whole place is pretty small let alone the bar area.  Place was really loud with sports bar decor and big TVs.

We walked in and it was pretty busy, we had to wait 20 mins for a table. The first thing I noticed was how unorganized the hostess staff was, the 2nd thing I noticed was how dirty the place was! It's a dump and it hasn't even been open very long! We were seated and both ordered a burger- mine just didn't taste right and about half way into it I felt extremely sick. I went to the ladies room... There was a sign on the door ""light broken, enter at your own risk""... Seriously? How unprofessional. Fix the light in the bathroom! I work in the food industry and we would never do that where I work. It would be fixed immediately. So I had to fumble around in the dark.

H S.,"Scotch Plains, NJ",0,9,1,4.0,1/21/2016,"I'm surprised that the ratings here are so bad. This is just your run of the mill Red-Robin--loud as heck (I've never been in a quiet Red Robin), with greasy burgers and terribly named cocktails that are embarrassing to order (Sand in Your Shorts? Really?) If that's not your kind of place, well, alright, I guess other people's expectations are much higher than mine. I think it's good for what it is. I'll say that I usually get the Boca patty, and as they probably cook like one Boca a day at most Red Robins, it's very common for the chefs to either burn it to an utter crisp or serve it practically frozen. I haven't had that issue at this Red Robin, so that automatically makes this place pretty good for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vineland?start=20

More chips and celery than anything. The shakes, however, made up for it.

Briana R.,"Millville, NJ",3,9,,2.0,10/5/2015,"So I been up since 7am, went car shopping with dad and went to lunch after his big purchase. I ordered a burger at red robin.. Not only did we not have a designated waitress.. The service was the shittiest I've ever had. I ordered a black and blue burger. It had crumbled blue cheese and fried onions.. And they charged us $14.99 For a burger with fries... I will never go to this location again. One thing that pisses me off the most is when you go to a restaurant and the employees are in the same booths as the customers goofing off. Either on there break, or they supposilvy had nothing to do. Very disappointed and I'm sure they will not last long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vineland?start=20

Their fish and chips are full of flavor and I can see myself coming back for more. My only complaint is about the drinks. We ordered margaritas and I don't believe there was an ounce of alcohol in them. They were also chock full of ice. They tasted like watered down fruit juice. This doesn't seem the place to go for a happy hour drink but the food was good. The tower of onion rings appetizer was also delicious.

Ayanna M.,"Buffalo, NY",309,3,,1.0,4/24/2016,"Ordered burger to go. Wanted well done with no pink. Was right on the receipt. Got home, sat down ready to enjoy my burger, cut it and it was still all pink inside. Yuck.. Lost my appetite. Had to pack my child up, get back into my car to get refund. Bartender/ server was apologetic he called over the manager I believe Mary was her name. She refunded my money but barely mumbled two words. Here is my problem: I understand mistakes happened but customer service is everything. You would think think the manager would have did a little more than just refund my money considering my dinner was ruined and I had to drive back there. Something as simple as a refund AND a coupon or voucher for a free appetizer or $5 off a next purchase would have been more appropriate. Offering just a refund is the bare minimum and says ""We made a mistake."" Offering a little more says ""We made a mistake. We are sorry our mistake caused you to be inconvenienced AND we appreciate your time and your business.""

We received prompt, friendly service from the bartender. Our food came out relatively quickly, but they skimped on napkins, we could have used more than one per person. Also, I felt sorry for anyone who ordered a milkshake that day, because the girl making them had no idea what she was doing.  When she did make one successfully, it looked half-assed and messy.  She was slow as hell, but she didn't impact our meal at all, so I still give our experience 4 stars.

We were sat right away or server, Lauren, took our drink and appetizer order almost immediately and then we were left to decide what burger to choose.

Eileen B.,"Vineland, NJ",1,11,,5.0,8/17/2015,Great burger! I had chop house and my husband had fire burger. Both cooked perfectly (some pink). The food come quickly. Anthony was our server And was outstanding. Friendly but not over bearing. He must read Yelp because we got plenty of napkins. :). One thing I would say is seems to have too many tables. You almost feel like your sitting on top of the guests next to you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vineland?start=40
Amanda N.,"Newfield, NJ",0,2,,2.0,1/14/2016,The waitress was very pleasant when she was actually at our table. It took 15min before she even came to take our drink order. The food actually came out in a decent amount of time and was good. Waitress never came back to check for refills on our drinks. And it took forever to get a slice of cake to go and pay our bill. They were not even busy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vineland?start=40
Shawn P.,"Mt Laurel, NJ",0,9,,2.0,10/22/2015,"The Food is consistent and on par with other locations I have patronized. (Cherry Hill,Deptford) I don't not like how much they push the ziosk. To require appetizers to be ordered via the ziosk,seems a bit draconian of a policy. Why even place a order with a server if I MUST order my appetizer from the ziosk? It seems like Red Robin wants to phase out the server. Based on the demeanor and overall experience with their servers, I would be ok with that. I love Red Robin's food and drink selection. I can't stand the usual village idiot taking half my order and still not getting it right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vineland?start=40
Harold M.,"Bridgeton, NJ",1,10,3,2.0,11/24/2015,"The onion ring tower is great, they have some local beers which is cool, but their burgers really aren't any better than a fast food joint. I got the big tavern and it was a thin piece of meat with no texture. If I got this burger from the McDonald's drive through at 2AM after a night of drinking, I would have been highly disappointed. It really tasted like biting into a marshmallow. I didn't know when I had gotten through the bun to the rest of the toppings or patty. My wife hated the boneless ""buzz"" wings. We sat at one of the high tops near the bar and the waiter was really stretched thin. It seemed like he had a huge area of responsibility. We figured out how to order our apps on the tablet before he even came with our drinks. We visited twice when the place first opened and figured their shortfalls were just growing pains but this third time sealed the deal... Sorry Red Robin, we wish it could have worked out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vineland?start=40
Bob C.,"Vineland, NJ",26,43,,5.0,11/10/2015,"First of all I have to say I've been to Red Robin's elsewhere and knew what to expect. The first visit didn't seem to turn out very well overall, and I chalk it up to being halloween evening and we were seated at the bar area. But hats off to the Manager Mr. Vince for making sure that we came back again. And we returned last Sunday and everything was as good as I remember Red Robin to be. Emily was a fantastic server- Very nice and sweet and helpful. Food can get a little pricey depending on what you order- But that is no different than any other place. I will definitely return as the burgers are top-notch, servers are nice and friendly, and management is there to address any concerns. My hats off to Mr. Vince and Ms Emily. And yes- the bar side is SO loud that one cannot hear conversations much less relax. My only real ""complaint"" is the prices of sodas and other soft drinks. But that's just me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vineland?start=40
