Ashley M.,"Norfolk, VA",14,48,230,4.0,1/6/2018,"Live nowhere near a RR so we only get to go to one whem we are doing stuff in the area. I love me some steak fries and RR seasoning! While my hubby rotates around the menu, I stick to my fav guac burger with some tweaks to fit me. All orders came out as ordered, even mine.  Ordered some yummy pretzel bites. Nice share size but comes with a tiny side of cheese so if you have a dip hog with you ask for more.  Mini man got the kids meal which came with 6 large pieces of chicken, bottomless fries, and a bottomless drink..... For $5!! What?!?!  We were the first ones there at opening so didn't get busy until we were leaving. Loved the extra attention. Waitress stayed on top of our drinks, plates, and food. Only annoyance was none of the entertainment devices were up and running at all. Not even when we left. Too bad so sad for my mini man.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach
Kris D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",193,208,169,4.0,10/16/2017,"My family has always been a fan of Red Robin.   By family, I mean the kids!  I can't eat these kinda carbs and calories on a regular basis!   But ya have to live it up sometimes and break away from the health foods.  When I do, Red Robin is the place.  Pros:  This location is always rocket-fast at lunchtime when they need to be, and the staff is all super friendly. How than the staff be this happy all the time?  Makes me want to work here. :-D Also, the quality of the burgers is always great, as is the pricing.  You can get a great burger for as low as $6.99.  That beats just about any place out there, but better quality here.  Only thing that I cannot bring myself to ever do is buy Onion Rings here.  The ""tower"" looks cool, sure, but my mathematical brain says ""You only get 13 onion Rings! ...and the ones at the top are smaller!  ...and it costs 8 dollars!  And if you are in a party of 5, how do you divide up 13!...""   ...But other than the overpriced onion ring tower, Red Robin is awesome, and this location in particular is always well staffed with great folks :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach
Jeni E.,"Virginia Beach, VA",8,50,268,2.0,7/27/2017,"I prefer giving props and positives, but got to be honest. 2.5 for today's one-hour visit. Daughter name-dropped Red Robin prior to dinnertime, so we obliged.  Walked in and there was a certain smell in the air...kinda like dirty mop water. Ignorable since the smell didn't follow us as my family was led to the seating area in the back of the restaurant. However, makes me a little wary given 1. my fam is there to eat and 2. the kitchen is nearby the hostess stand and clearly along the path of the lingering smell. Just makes you wonder.  Fairly slow Thursday evening.  Server was friendly. Daughters asked for an extra tabletop game system, so they each could have their own to play on as we waited, and our waitress happily provided another (as always done during our previous visits). Food arrived rather quickly. Enjoyed my gourmet burger and fries, and husband ate up his Tavern Burger. Daughters found the mozzarella sticks appetizer tasty and seemed to enjoy their meals just the same. No complaints on the corn nuggets and kids burger. Children just wished that when they asked for a refill that they received the same original beverage.  2 out of 3 stalls in the women's restroom were functional. 1 out of 3 sinks in the ladies restroom was not either a) clogged with paper towels or b) filled with bubbly water that wouldn't seem to drain.  One surprise came when we received the bill. Apparently, since the last time we ate at Red Robin, there's a $1.99 entertainment fee for the extra tabletop game unit request. Ummmm...okay then. Good to know for next time. Maybe I should have let my children play while eating their meal?.? Wish we were told about that fee ahead of time. Or maybe I wish that we held off on our prompt bill payment cause the game units shut off immediately afterwards. Felt like a ""polite"" way of saying ""time to leave, people.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach
Tami C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",476,235,1815,2.0,7/27/2017,"2.5 today Ugh. I was disappointed this last visit. I've never, in the many years I've been coming to Red Robin, had a Freckled Lemonade taste so bad and so off. It's one of the things I look forward to when I eat at RR. So when I ask to have my first glass exchanged for a better one because it tasted flat and watered down, I expect to get a banging glass of some Freckled lemonade! But when you get the new one and it tastes exactly the same as the first, I turn into an irritated little bunny. I was not a happy camper and didn't even want to ask for another one so I sucked it up and sipped it ever so hesitantly.  Service was a little slow and it wasn't even busy. I have one gift card here that i need to burn but after that, I doubt I'll be returning anytime soon. There's just way too many other options in the area, which is a shame because once upon a time, I loved Red Robin and would drive further than I really should for their food. But, the continuous strong smell of dirty wash rags in the air was a complete turn off, for one. Sticky, wobbly tables made eating feel like a juggling act in a circus. And of course, the tip of the iceberg was bad Freckled Lemonade twice. Tsk Tsk",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach
Jackie G.,"Falls Church, VA",125,74,218,4.0,7/18/2017,"Nothing exciting about this restaurant. It's a just a regular restaurant to get some quick food and go.  The only thing exciting is the bottomless fries. The one complaint is the judgement when you tell them more fries to the waiters or waitresses. I mean it called ""bottomless fries"" for a reason. So ignore the rolled eyes or sigh and ask for more fries, either way your paying for you meal.

Monica M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",335,77,111,4.0,5/8/2017,"Went in for a quick lunch yesterday. Not typically a fan of chain restaurants and I've only been to Red Robin maybe three times in my life, but I had a pretty good experience. Ordered the guacamole bacon burger and it was fantastic, SO ordered the Banzai burger and was also pleased. Pretty good cheese curds and fried zucchini, too!  The only thing I really did not like was that it was decently slow in the restaurant and our server and other server sat in a booth next to our table gossiping...took away from the experience for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach
Sarou C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",208,144,99,3.0,2/21/2017,I haven't been in a Red Robbins in such a long time that I actually forgot how the food was. So we haven't had a good burger in awhile so the hubs suggested that we head here for dinner. A friend of mine always raves about how good the food is so I was pretty stoked.  We were seated in a cramped little table next to a wall. The service was fine. They got our drinks fast and came to order pretty quickly.  I decided to order the bacon cheeseburger. The food came out on a red platter. Kind of reminded me of food that you got in a cafeteria. The fries were bottomless which ment you could eat as much as you wanted. They were pretty good fries. Nice and hot. Let's move on to the burger though. It was so blah.. The patty didn't taste seasoned. It needed to be seasoned. Lol. It was so bland and dry. I let my hubby eat half of my burger and he agreed that was not good.    Next time I'll try their chicken sandwich. Maybe that would be better :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach
Sandra M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,31,44,1.0,10/2/2017,"Edit: For the heck of it, I swung by Hardee's to compare last night's shameful burger to one of theirs.  Twice the size and cheaper! Ordered for pick up.  Should've gone to Hardee's.  I can't believe they charge so much for these little burgers!!  We ordered ours on a lettuce wrap instead of a bun.  Had to search for the actual burger!!  My husband asked me if they were kid burgers!  How dare they charge $9 for something smaller than a quarter pounder at McDonald's!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach
Chelsea R.,"Virginia Beach, VA",86,184,112,4.0,4/17/2017,"So this place has changed quite a bit since the last time I visited roughly over 10 years ago. My memory of this location is children everywhere but this time was different. We sat at a high top at the bar and though it did take some time for a server to get to us, they were pleasant. I ordered the California Chicken sandwich and it was SO. DANG. GOOD! it was juicy, the bacon the cooked right, the toppings were fresh and those fries...I had no idea they were endless but I could have eaten them all day!  They use the tablets at the table to let you reorder drinks, pay your check and to play games but sometimes it's better to be face to face with your server when you need something. All in all I had a good experience and there were no screaming children as I remembered. Their decor is still funky and I appreciate the patriotic-ness!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach
Nicole K.,"Virginia Beach, VA",46,369,3481,4.0,10/6/2016,"Either no busboys or insufficient busboys today. Long waits for large parties due to dirty tables. Thankfully I only needed a table for one. I did not request a booth because I knew they were having issues. But I usually dislike the high top tables. Today it was ok, a decent experience. Great: Waitress was very nice. I feel that she gave me honest advice based in her personal experience when I inquired about specific menu items. Her advice turned out to be pretty solid although I was not as excited about the ""new"" mac & cheese recipe as she was. Great: The chicken ""burger"" that I enjoyed was messy perfection! Sweet heat! Practically divine. Relish & honey down my chin. Red Robin you did good! ""The Bees Knees Burger"" is only available for a limited time. I think it will be gone by Thanksgiving so I'm very happy that I got a chance to try it. Not so great: Single Bathroom dispenser out of soap. Needs to be refilled. The lady after me looked confused. We both remarked about needing clean hands before we started our meals. Thankfully we both got a little half squirt of soap. Over an hour later I went back to the restroom before leaving. Still no hand soap. This little girl was there shaking the hand soap dispenser turning it upside down struggling trying to get a little piece of soap out, she looked defeated. So on my way out I found a manager and I let her know that the ladies room was out of hand soap and she said ""Thank you I will take care of that immediately!""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach
Se C.,"Annandale, VA",190,322,458,3.0,7/19/2016,"The burger was good and the fries were good too, but service was so so. One girl came to give us our refill of fries and was so rude. She said something like, ""take it, it's free refill anyways"" she was really annoyed of working here or something was up with her that day.  The inside is clean, cool, and they have few TVs and a full bar. I like the window seats. The seats were comfy and the height of the table was just right. Although it would be better if the tables were bigger because a friend of mine spilled his drink trying to move things out of the way.  Our main server came by and asked if everything was okay and just left as she was saying it. I missed several chances to tell her I need napkins or more fries because she would just leave before we even had a chance to tell her anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach

Granted im wearing a maxie dress so i tend to be more sensitive when my dress reaches the ground, but theres no excuse to have a stream of fluids reaching to the drain in the center of a 3 stall. In addition 1 of them were out of order and based on the condition of the restroom i can assume its been out of order a while it doesn't looked as if anyone has cleaned it for days. In addition to the floor filth the toilet seat was either needing to be wipe or replaced it was heavily stained. And the toilet seat covers container was empty. The manager came over and asked if i was ok and i told him of my experience and moments later an attendant went in the restroom. No i didn't ck back. Service here was good nothing over the top though. Its a tues and not busy at all today rather empty. The food was pretty good i love the selection in the menu.

Red Robin sends their phone  phone orders to a call center which I found out later. The order was never placed. I showed up and the restaurant was very casual about it. Like it was no big deal or that maybe I had ordered it to the wrong store. They kept putting me on hold ""to go check if they got an order"".

We got a short stack of onion rings as an appetizer.  Onion rings were thick and huge.  There were also two sauces to go along with it. I ordered the limited item, Wild Pacific crab cake burger.  Tasty big crab cake, and that's all that needs to be said about that. Wife ordered the smoke and pepper burger.  She ordered it some pink and it was on point when they served it. Bottomless fries with the meals.  I ordered the bottomless root beer.  The meal was so filling that my belly wouldn't let me order refills on either. Despite that, Lindsey gave me a root beer float to go!  Wasn't able to drink much of it, but it's the gesture that counted.

Jason P.,"Virginia Beach, VA",53,66,263,3.0,5/28/2016,"Red Robin - I've passed by it almost daily for quite a while now.  The other day I thought to myself, ""self, shouldn't you go buy yourself a burger because you legitimately deserve it?"" The answer of course, was yes.  That's when the trouble started... I visited with a friend of mine that was combat wounded - in fact, he suggested we go.  I mention this because of what happened as we entered.  The host, a young man probably still in his teens, welcomed us and began showing us to a table.  My buddy has a cane and walks with extreme difficulty - we passed through the entire restaurant to the very back before being seated.  The problem was the amount of empty, obviously non-reserved tables we walked by before getting to ours.  My buddy's obvious impairment didn't factor in to our table selection.  Bad call host. We sat below arguably the world's coldest vent while we waited to order.  The waitress was pleasant and well-versed in the menu and recommendations.  Though the kitchen might not have been quite so versed as it took 23 minutes to make some chicken-tenders, fries, and a medium-rare burger.  They weren't busy or packed by any means so it seemed a bit slow.  Add the fact that my food was dropped on the floor and well, you can see the downward trend. Our meals were actually good when they finally came out.  The standard frozen and warmed tenders were decent with an almost spicy ""ghost pepper"" coating.  My buddy's burger looked tempting enough to steal it.  Our beers were almost as cold as the AC! So how to rate this place... It's an ok spot to dine (this was my first time, and I'll go back to try again).  The front of house staff needs some ""accessibility training"" and some ""how-to-warn-people-about-cold-air training"".  The kitchen may want to prioritize their cooking procedures a bit as well.  The 3-Stars are based mainly on those two things.  The food was standard-to-great and the atmosphere was what you'd expect from a family/community centric pseudo sports-bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach?start=20

The server was quite possibly the rudest I've ever experienced. She had a bad attitude the entire time serving us, and spoke to us in a condescending tone about everything. If you asked for something by name she acted like you were dumb and talked to you like a child(ex. Whiskey river burger = looking at us like we were stupid and ""the bbq one?"" Tavern sauce = same rude face and ""thousand island?"") We were hungry so we put up with it. Upon ordering a milkshake to go, I was presented with a child's cup barely half full and told that was the size of a full milkshake.

He ended up being the one to sweep, but he did a half-done job. Are you serious? Then, our waitress who serviced us only offered the ""bottomless"" fries once we were two bites away from finishing our meal.

Of course, the fries at RR are bottomless and I ordered at least two refills. That my table mate might have snagged one or two fries is probably not worth mentioning. The burger was decent (medium rare is as light as they will cook it) with the proper amount of messiness. Avocado and bacon were excellent. Lots of choices in burgers here.

This restaurant is 13 miles from my home which is a BIG deal when driving an extra 10 miles each way for hopefully better food/service.) **It is with great sadness that I have to write this review. I gave a different RR in another city a try and when it just didn't work out I that's when I drove out to the county. My 12 year old was immediately pleased with this place as soon as we walked up the sidewalk. When we stepped in, the roar of the guests and the hustle of the servers were a change of pace from the RR we were use to. After a moment we were seated pleasantly by Renee the manager. She was glowing pregnant and prideful of her baby bump :-) She was the sweetest and most professional  woman I had run across all day so far. Josh sat us, he was amazing! He was funny, personable and sat is with pose and professionalism. He listened to me and waited for my party to be seated before placing the menus down. So crazy lady, why the 1 star review if everything was so great? Well, I'm so glad you asked!! My 4 children and I specifically came to RR after my long day at work. We were celebrating my first day at work AND a couple twin girls 10th birthday but guess what? There wasn't any celebrating! The kids wanted endless Mac and cheese and I was exhausted so I was happy to oblige. Well, after all 4 kids happily placed their Mac and Cheese order the waitress told them ""did you know we changed our menu and your Mac and cheese is no longer bottomless? But the quality is better and you'll get bigger portions and better quality."" That was SO disappointing but we stayed bc the waitress said ""bigger portions, better quality, spiral noodles...etc"" Mac and Cheese came to the table...you guessed it, same old dish as before, no new ingredients but this time it's in a square bowl....oohhhh weeee! This was not new, not improved, not bigger, not better and I asked to speak to a manger. Here comes Renee. She pretty much said ""there is no way I can give you anymore Mac and cheese. I can't even ring it up, my hands are tied (and in a snotty tone) she said ""what do you want me to do? I can't do anything for you!""  OMG I'd rather have been talking to the floor because she was 1. Not nice 2. Not accommodating 3. Rude!  I never asked Renee for more Mac and cheese, I just asked ""why am I paying the same price for the same quality but told it's better quality and not being allowed endless?"" I made sure to say ""I'm not mad at you I'm just frustrated because I didn't sleep last night in preparation for my first day at work, I'm tired, and when we leave here I will have to go home and make food for the kids because this is not how I planned my celebration dinner."" And I'm not going to lie, I cried because I'm a tired frustrated baby getting now where at this crappy place. She replied ""didn't the server tell you in the beginning that the Mac and cheese wasn't endless?"" I said ""that's not the point! You're not listening! It was after the kids ordered happily and we're excited, what was I suppose to do, say ""no thanks come on kids even though I'm exhausted and the server promised it was better quality we should leave?"" Renee replied in a rude manner ""I am not going to do anything for you."" I said ""can I have my Check please?"" She said ""sure"" and walked away. I never got my check. My server came back to the table 7 minutes later and said ""fry refills?"" And placed the fries on the table"" OMG my frustration was building!! Renee comes back to my table about 10 mins later with 4 bowls of Mac and cheese and said ""this is it. Don't ask for anything else. I am going to make a note on your account about this."" I said ""I DIDNT ASK YOU FOR THIS! I just wanted you to listen to me."" She said ""you have this now, is there anything else I can do for you?""

The one that reminds me that there's is still good burgers out there.  Bleu Ribbon: got this because I was in the mood for bleu cheese & their crispy onion straws. I added an egg to this and it was everything I could ask for.  ***Ask for their classic sauces: they are free of charge! -My fave was the Campfire (creamy BBQ) -Secret tavern tasted like a tangy creamy sauce  -Sweet n Spicy Ketchup was good too -Honey Mustard was different from what I've had other places. It's more of a neon yellow with black pepper in it, and it has subtle on the mustardiness to it, complimented by a sweet kiss of honey. I'm getting this everytime.

The waitress was friendly and engaging so we ordered the pretzel bite appetizers and 2 alcoholic drinks. The pretzel bites were great! A little too salty bc we were both sucking down our drinks since we opted for no waters. That was definitely a mistake on our part. I really enjoyed how think the cheese sauce was. Yum!  I got the smoke and pepper burger cooker ""with some pink"", I dont like how I couldn't order exactly how I wanted bc the choices were some pink or no pink. I like medium rare so I opted for some pink. It came out medium well to more well done. Oh well. It was very tasty with their smokey ketchup sauce. My boyfriend got the ""name that chicken"" sandwhich and it was delicious. Really good flavor sauces.  All in all I was highly impressed.

Even the bottomless root beer and fries where attended to.  Unfortunately, I had asked for a medium rare burger and it was more medium well.  But the salad was a bigger problem.   A 10.99 salsa had not too fresh liking avocado and flavorless chicken.  Simply put, it was a pretty sad salad.  See the photos.

Xavier C.,"Chesapeake, VA",228,182,37,1.0,2/17/2015,"Well, this proves it to me that each of these places really does have its own entity.  Went here after the Polar Plunge and was beyond disappointed.  The only thing I think they got right was the fact that they looked like the other Red Robins' in the area. First the seating.  When they attempted to sit us down, the table wasn't even clean.  A busboy walked by and noticed they gave us the bench seat and went ""whoa"".. and then cleaned our area.   Upon sitting down our waitress did the usual (drinks, appetizers) and there were 5 of us in total - two kids and 3 adults.  We all placed our orders and here is where the chaos started to happen.   Since I've come to accept the fact that Red Robin no longer gives you fries before the meal, I asked for an extra set to come w/ the meal (didn't come btw).  The boys ordered a freckle drink and when they drank through it, she gave them the wrong refill (more on this in a bit).  Boys, being boys, they went ahead and drank it thinking that was the refill anyway.  Pressing forward the food came and was just not up to par of what I've come to expect from the better RR's.  The fries had sat around awhile, the burgers were ""meh"" and it took FOREVER to get extra fries.  The best part - when we DID get fries, you could actually count 10 fries.  Ten would be rather gracious considering some of them were less than 1"" long.  It made me wonder if this was their new quantity control thing going on. Aside from the food be ""meh"", refills were distant, and to top it off, they got my check wrong.  Remember that wrong refill?  They added that drink onto my check and the boys drink on our friends check (basically charged us twice).  All of this btw - was done by EVERYONE else BUT our server.  Isn't that crazy?  She came to us so infrequently, we had to get the other servers to tell someone to give us a refill, get the manager to give us fries, then a different manager corrected our check.   This visit was a joke of a Red Robin.  The best part?  While the waitress was prudent enough to ask me for my Red Robin card information - she failed to put it as a part of my tab so I never received the credit for my order.  Classy.

The service was less than mediocre and made the experience not the best for the group I came with. I ordered the Red Robin Gourmet burger and  bottomless root beer float and fries. We mainly came for the bottomless fries, but after we got our order our waitress failed to come in and check on us to make sure we were ok and wanted more fries and another milkshake. It was a solid 15 minutes until we got asked for anything. If I had a suggestion for this place it would be to work on the promptness of the wait staff.

Karrisa N.,"Cape Charles, VA",134,4,1,1.0,1/14/2017,"What. In. The. World? I went here with my fiancé, my mother and my father. We have always loved Red Robin and can normally have a nice family dinner without any issues, tonight Red Robin was dead set on ensuring that wasn't the case. Before we even decided what we wanted to eat we noticed the dishes were a dirty, not scratched, dirty. The dishes had old food stuck on them, whatever I'm not a complainer, but I do have standards. I brought this to our servers attention (a cranky woman by the name of Teresa) and she stated that all the silverware would be in the same condition, when I pointed out the food on it she said okay she'll get some more but to just leave that there for now. Okay, cool. We went on having a conversation and placed our orders, among them the towering onion rings. We saw our waitress bring the onion rings to another table, and then after they said no that's not ours she brought them back to the kitchen and carried on. We flagged her down and she told us to wait, and brushed us off. When she came back we confronted her about the onion rings, the silverware that was still sitting on the edge of the table, and her attitude and requested to speak to the manager. A few minutes passed and another waitress came over and said that she would be our server for the remainder of the night. So we told her about the onion rings, the silverware, and that we would still like to speak to the manager. She said okay, and carried on with whatever she was doing before, not addressing any of our concerns. The manager (Jeff) finally came over and asked what the issues were, we told him our quarrels and his response was ""well you got your food now, what else can I do for you?"". We literally just told him. We. Just. Told. Him. He was clearly not listening to a word we said and when we told him AGAIN after that that we wanted silverware, our onion rings, and an apology. We all got up and left our food as is (I was the only one that had a small bite because, guess what, we still had no silverware) and proceeded to walk out of the establishment when my father asked the manager for the store number and to contact his boss. These people were not concerned with customer service or satisfaction. My father kindly tried to tell Jeff what really set us over the edge, and he told him it was his comment that discredited everything we said and made us feel like they didn't care at all.

Katie M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",1,8,,2.0,8/22/2016,"I am disappointed to have to update my review, but I just had a not-so-great experience at the same Red Robin. Ever since I joined the Red Robin Royalty Rewards, I have been irrationally excited to get my free birthday burger. My husband and I went up tonight to get a couple of burgers, including my free one. I have never ordered a well done burger at this location, but I had to tonight. It was just their gourmet cheeseburger, well done. When I received the burger, I cut it in half and there was pink everywhere; it was definitely not well done. I showed the waitress, who was very apologetic, and she told me she would have the kitchen make a new one. After quite a long wait (which would have been fine if the burger was cooked properly), the manager brought me my burger. It was cut in half to show that the inside was done, so I thanked him and began to eat it. When I cut the burger into smaller pieces, though, I saw that the inside was still pink. I was shocked! When the waitress returned, I told her that the burger still wasn't well done, and that we would like to leave. She told us that she would have the manager take the burger off our bill, which she did. As my husband and I were leaving, the manager came over to let us know that he had taken the burger off of our bill and that ""it looked done when he cut it in half."" I agreed with him but told him that the rest of the inside was still pink. Red Robin is a burger restaurant and one that sells to a lot of children on a regular basis. I find it very unnerving to realize that the kitchen at this particular restaurant doesn't know how to cook burgers to specific temperatures. Ground beef has a higher risk than other meat (like steak) of being infected with e.coli and other bacteria. Any restaurant, but especially a burger-centric restaurant that caters to families, should be MUCH better about training their cooks to properly prepare food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach?start=40

I had the Grilled Chicken Alla Caprese entree.   WOW!   I never expected fast food like this to taste so great!   The platter consists of a seared chicken breast with balsamic cream sauce (not overpowering, not too much either), romaine salad w/ black olives and crispy pepperoni strips with ranch dressing (the type of ranch mostly found on a salad bar - Yes, the kind that I really like, and can't seem to find anywhere else but on a salad bar!), and 3 thick slices of mozzarella cheese lightly drizzled with the balsamic cream sauce.  There was an 'authentic' bruschetta over the mozz. cheese & chicken breast.

Overall, we both had great meals for under $10 each.  We will be back next year for MY birthday!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach?start=80
Tundra D.,"Dacula, GA",8,71,12,3.0,3/6/2011,"I've eaten here numerous times and it normally fills the void my body was missing. I'm a sucker for a great burger with avocado or guacamole on it.

My favorite order is the chicken caprese sandwich with bottomless fries : ) The burgers are fantastic- so is the freckled lemonade! My daughter orders the grilled cheese or the chicken tenders- you just can't go wrong! The servers are always friendly & on it. Been here numerous times and have never had a bad experience.

Chris A.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,1,,1.0,11/13/2012,"Do not eat here. I've been multiple times and the manager there is quite rude. I believe her name is Tracey. I have watched as she scolds employees, loudly, in the middle of the store. She's seemed completely ticked off when she's stopped by our table before. While the food and service is great here, I refuse to spend my money with this company, knowing it is going to support a woman like that's salary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach?start=80

I start a timer to see how long it takes to get service. At a bar, 3 or minutes is golden depending on the time. 8 minutes is simply unacceptable. The whole time I was there felt like I was invisible.  I had the chili and the pepper and smoke burger. Both were delicious and I would come back for it.

Tracey T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",10,12,,1.0,8/12/2014,"Met a friend for BOCA burgers after a long day at work.  I haven't been to Red Robin in a while and thankfully so.  This place has gone WAY downhill.  It appeared to be dirty upon entering and the table was sticky.  We ordered Whiskey River BOCA burgers because we're vegetarians.  The burgers came with ZERO BBQ sauce on them and the fries were cold.  The waitress was concerned and happily brought us fresh, warm fries and a cup of sauce.  Being engrossed in conversation we didn't notice until nearly finished that instead of a vegan BOCA burger, we were served turkey burgers.  This was disappointing since one of the reason I enjoyed RR in the past is that I could have a tasty vegetarian burger while my kids could eat beef. I approached the manager, Carlos, about the issues with our meal.  He basically shrugged and said that they were having ""lots of problems.""   My suggestion?  Maybe the District Manager should remedy these ""lots of problems"" or close the doors before anyone else spends their hard earned money on a disgusting meal in a filthy restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach?start=60

Now, I went there for the first time in years. The service was odd it seemed like once dinner rush started coming in the kitchen had a bad time transitioning because I watched numerous waitresses/waiters standing around the open kitchen area waiting on food. It took longer than usual to receive our food, and the place seemed a little loud. My pizza didn't come with extra cheese so it was mediocre, I used to get tons of cheese and not have to ask for extra, now I ask for extra and it has hardly any cheese at all! On top of that, the two other people I was with had hot  fries, but mine were cold.

Mike M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,5,5,1.0,12/30/2015,"On Monday 12/28/15 at 7pm, me and my wife decided to go the Red Robin in Red Mill after getting a gift card at Christmas. Ashley the bartender wasn't very attentive to her customers at the bar whatsoever. Frankly she talked more and joked around with the server staff that were coming to the bar acting like little kids. She was tasting almost every drink she made and had a childish demeanor. A customer at the bar had to walk down the bar and get his own ketchup. After slamming it into the bar because of his frustrations, the bartender Ashley asked him if he was making a mess over there with no apology after he had told her that he had to go get his own ketchup. She stated that she was using wrong glassware for certain drinks and even had servers telling her how to make certain drinks. So unprofessional and personally unacceptable being in the restaurant industry. Hopefully I will never have to deal with her again. On top of everything, me and my wife were never greeted walking in or had anything said to us as we left with our to-go food after the manager looked us right in the face. Horrible experience!!! Don't know if we will be back. No receipt, no napkins....being a local, I will be telling my friends about this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-virginia-beach?start=60

Maryann R.,"San Jose, CA",56,87,263,2.0,5/10/2014,I give two stars for the food and that's the only thing that deserves any stars. When I got there we waited for a hostess to come up to seat us and it took about 3 mins for anyone to come. There wasn't a wait to get seated by a crowed or anything there was just lack of service. Then it didn't stop there our waitress wasn't around to fill our drinks or ask us if we'd like anymore salad or fries since it's bottomless. She wasn't even the one to give us our food. Another server did and when I asked her are the blk beans on the side she didn't know anything about it so the communication amongst the staff isn't good. If our waitress just served us instead of missing in action it would of been avoided with the confusion of my order. Then my friend and I have been done waiting for our check for about 10mins and she still hasn't come around to check on us so we had to go up to her when we saw her behind the bad to ask for our bill. Yes you read right we got up to catch her to ask for our bill.

Our waitress only came to the table to take our drink order, our food order and to bring our food. I have never waited to long for food in a restaurant in my life. I have waited tables, so I'm generally pretty understanding of being busy, BUT if food is taking a long time to come out, a waitress should take care of her customers the ways she can. At least come and check to see if anyone needs drink refills! The manager was also no where to be found.
