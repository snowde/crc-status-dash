Jessica B.,"Woodinville, WA",16,65,81,3.0,8/25/2013,"I picked up our clinic's lunch from here while I was working in Yakima; the doctor wanted a caesar salad, and this place was very close to our location. The doctor's Simply Grilled Chicken salad (with caesar dressing) looked beautiful and was generously sized; while he didn't actually comment on it, he made a point of eating it all. My Tavern Double didn't survive the to-go treatment nearly as well; when I opened it, it was upside down, mushed, and messy.  It actually tasted pretty good though.  The fries were really not very good, but I think that steak fries just don't age in a to-go box very well; unlike the narrow McD-style fries, these sort of steam themselves and get all floppy.  Some to-go ketchup would probably have helped them out; I suppose I should have asked for that. Not bad, though, by any means--I'll probably just do a wrap or something next time, that might travel better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee?start=20
Veronica A.,"Wenatchee, WA",17,10,1,2.0,9/16/2015,"Great service, good food. However, the restaurant is currently being remodeled inside and it stinks of paint. This cannot be safe for customers.

Dana G.,"Seaside, OR",53,140,106,3.0,4/28/2014,"Early dinner in the bar at Red Robin sounds more like a sporting event in a huge arena with only three people in the crowd. Concrete floors, blaring televisions, scraping chairs and excessive noise makes it an uncomfortable place to try to have a conversation.  I know we were in the bar so I take some responsibility for the noise level but the rest of the restaurant was pretty much the same.  The food was okay, burger was cooked properly but the fries tasted old and were a little limp.  Servers were dressing the part as needed for their jobs in blue jeans and black shirt and hats but the effect was lost on me and the two male servers that actually delivered our food looked unkempt.  Overall, it was a barely adequate experience made worse by the companies policy of requiring the ""trendy"" uniforms.

Peggy R.,"Lynnwood, WA",256,420,93,5.0,11/20/2013,"""Red Robin, yummmmmm!"" This particular restaurant definitely lives up to its theme song. Great food, stellar service and awesome company made our visit as close to perfect as can be!! We had a rather large party, and we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The service was fast and friendly, and the waiter had an amazing sense of humor. We were served our drinks quickly, and the staff was so patient with the indecision that I always get when I go to Red Robin. There are so many wonderful choices, but I decided to get the Whiskey River Chicken Wrap and the tortilla soup. The wrap was PHE-friggin-NOMINAL, wonderful flavor and texture with nice and tender chicken. I found the sandwich filled me up, so I wasn't really able to eat too much soup. But, the soup was rich and flavorful with the dollop of sour cream creating the perfect creamy mellowness to compliment the zestiness of the soup.  My iced tea was never empty, and they kept our water glass full. All in all our experience was one of the best I can remember at Red Robin. The next time we're in Wenatchee, we will definitely consider Red Robin as an option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee?start=20

Nick T.,"Everett, WA",13,168,16,2.0,8/6/2015,THE LEAST KID FRIENDLY RED ROBIN EXPERIENCE EVER - SERVICE WAS PRETTY BAD TOO - We (3 adults 4 kids) arrived around 1pm. For some reason the hostess tried to cram us all in a table that fits 4 adults rights next to another table. Well with 4 little ones that was not gonna happen. Should have been common sense but nope. So I spoke to a waitress and asked if it would be okay to move to another table maybe ten feet away. After sitting there for about 15 minutes with not one person coming by I had to ask a busser to try to track down a server for us. After 3-4 waitresses had a lil discussion over who was gonna take us we finally got one. By now the kids are going nuts and asked the server if we could get a couple baskets of fries to help settle them down to start. We ended up with one tiny little basket of ridiculously hot fries. Our waitress was clearly not happy to serve us and seemed incredibly irritated with the children. Our food was good when we finally got it even though the order was not correct. All in all the food was good but the experience was so bad that we will never return. I would discourage anyone from going to this red robin with kids.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee?start=20
Deanna N.,"Moses Lake, WA",1,3,,2.0,3/29/2014,"In my experience, Red Robin has had a high standard for quality.  Yesterday's experience was not good. Our visit was around 1:30 PM. I had a petite cheeseburger and asked for no onion.  I cut my burger in 1/2 and found it had onion on it.  I asked for a new one, but the waitress took it to the back, had the onion removed and brought the same burger back, which was now cold.  In the women's bathroom 2 of 3 stalls were completely out of toilet paper and the restroom needed a bit of cleaning. I hope the manager reads this review and makes the appropriate changes. Red Robin is one of my favorite restaurants.  I don't want to see it go into decline.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee?start=20

Sarah L.,"Seattle, WA",154,111,30,3.0,1/26/2013,Ok they have the best burgers. The whiskey river bbq is my favorite and the strawberry lemonade is delicious...mmm and those fries with some ranch. But the customer service could be A LOT better. I encounter either extremely snotty and rude teenage girls or servers who are slow and not helpful at all.  If you order to go you might have to wait about fifteen minutes to actually collect your food from the bartenders because they're so busy serving those at the bar. The food usually takes a while to arrive and the service is normally slow.

Ismael S.,"Wenatchee, WA",10,51,12,3.0,5/31/2012,"I never imagined I'd return to THIS Red Robin. Yep, anyone with any common sense would clearly avoid an ex's workplace. Otherwise, it can have a powerful effect on you. Normally, I'd never bring up an ex, but today I'll make an exception. Unlike my ex, who was a solid ten, Red Robin's reputable for cute waitresses. Of course, the service is phenomenal too, but bear with me guys. As for the ladies, bare with me anytime! Anyway, so you're feelin' hungry, but you can't decide what to order? Go with your gut feeling, dummy. From experience, it's important to build a healthy relationship with your food. After every meal, I feel very much alive. My secret, cheating. Actually, the only cheating I ever do is on my diet. It's wrong, but feels oh-so good! Yeah, the bad boy in me is a sucka for burgers with bottomless fries! And nothin' like a bottomless Root Beer Float after day one on my P90X schedule. Alas, 'cause the more I continue writing, the more I think about my ex, visit Red Robin on your birthday.

Cammelle C.,"Roy, WA",0,17,28,3.0,10/14/2017,"We love Red Robins, but this one was a bit of a disappointment.   Don't get me wrong, the food is FABULOUS!   And to be fair, it is Oktoberfest weekend, so I know they're busy, but when we went to check in with the hostess she said she would text us five minutes before our table would be ready.  We left, came back early, in just a few minutes, we thought we would be gone longer, but weren't.   We were waiting in the lobby when our name was called, NOT TEXT, we didn't need to be text messaged.  So the hostess called us and we followed her through the restaurant,  where she said, and I quote, with my minor child right there, ""Oh shit, it ain't ready, go back to the lobby.""  Then we went back to the lobby, where the other girl  said ""What's wrong? ""  The first girl said ""It's still dirty.""  Then the girl still at reception suggests another table, and the girl seating us says ""Well SHIT, follow me ,here, now!""   Really demanding and commanding and very rude.  The hostess / reception staff are aweful!   And swear in front of all the children!  We went to the table, we had the new double taco burger, it was amazing,  we also had the Ai pepper , and the black and blue,  great food.  The food IS AMAZING, the waitstaff are mediocre,  the host staff are awful ! When the waitress,  (who never shows up to take the order, the assistant hostess ends up taking our drink orders, and then later our main order) does deliver our order,  she doesn't even stick around long enough for us to ask for sauce, but the poor bus boy sees, and puts aside his work to get us our sauces we were screaming after the waitress to get.  The poor young man was so embarrassed,  yet gracious,  he needs to be a server, his talent is wasted as a busboy, I want to acknowledge him, he took the initiative to say, I'm so sorry that doesn't usually happen, can I get you what you need, he really saved the day.   Everything else was so disorganized!   My baby sister, who I raised, started as an Applebee's waitress, and is now an advanced Sommelier, has been the waitress,  moved to the manager , to a wine critic,  staffer and far beyond , she has taught me what to expect in food service, and she is an advanced som now in Sonoma Valley, she knows food and drink.   And has taught me what to expect from basic service.  This was adequate, but not basic service.

Caleb K.,"Fort Lewis, WA",0,4,,1.0,12/25/2017,"It seems like every time I go to s Red Robin in any city I'm always disappointed .  But this one takes the cake.  The waitress was friendly but the service was unacceptable.   First was the drink order.  I ordered some water with lemon for my wife and I,  and a regular water for my son.  We did not receive any lemons.  Strike one.  They did not give us a kids menus for our 16 mo old son we had to specifically ask not that big of a deal but should be obvious no? Strike two.  Then when we ordered our food we asked for a side of the bottomless fries because we both ordered a salad.  The side of fries never came when the food was delivered.  A different waitress delivered our food so I asked that waitress about our side.  It never came.  Strike 3.  My soup and salad combo was a bottomless salad.  The waitress came to inform me of that and offered to bring me another salad.  I accepted the offer.  But the salad never came.  And last but not least,  The salad mix they use for their salad for my wife and my salad smelled and tasted like bagged salad that sat in the fridge just 1 day too long.  Not too off that it was un eatable but not all that pleasant either.  Just had to pick out a few wilted leaves.  Anyway.  I will not be going to another red ribbon anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee
Zach D.,"Wenatchee, WA",0,1,,1.0,12/4/2016,"So an additional review: we went there today, it was rather busy so we sat at a booth in the bar. We sat for a solid 15 minutes without even an acknowledgement from a server. Several walked past, checking on the tables on either side of us, but literally looking away from us as they walked by. It was impossible to get anyone's attention. We even pressed the call server button on their pos POS system multiple times. They were busy but not That busy, so absolutely no excuse. Eventually walked out and went to McGlinns and got prompt service, I strongly recommend you go there instead.  Old review: Disappointed again. We come here once a year or so when we forget why we said we'd never come back the last time.  - The food gives you a chemical OD feeling after eating.  - The service since getting that stupid tablet payment system is horrendous. The servers seem to think once they drop the food their job is done. They never check to see if it's any good.  - This last time I ordered off of the seasonal menu a cheezy brat that was terribly bland. When the server finally came back about 15 minutes later I told her it wasn't any good. I was offered something else to eat, but since we had onion rings before I was no longer hungry. I was not offered anything comped, just basically, ""sorry that's what you get when you try new things."" RR is again on our blacklist. Next time before we think about going I'll read this review again and choose somewhere (anywhere) else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee

Aaron E.,"Manson, WA",6,17,,2.0,2/7/2017,"This is easily the worst Red Robin I have ever visited, and it has been that way consistently over a number of meals. My wife and I were ready to give up on this location, but we returned because our kids love the mac and cheese. Even they have given up because the mac and cheese was served cold three visits in a row.  They brag about bottomless fries which is technically true, but they make them harder to get than a home loan after bankruptcy. On my last visit they brought me five fries (not a guess, not a joke, literally five fries) with my burger in the little silver ring. The waiter was absent for a time before I could ask for more. The fries didn't get to the table until we were completely done, the meal paid for and the table bussed.  You should also be aware that they will charge you for playing the tablets on the table. Definitely keep those away from you children.

But as health conscious as I am I looked up the calories and to my amazement it's over 1200 calories. What a disappointment. So, I only ate half. My sweet potato fries came burnt to a crisp. I asked for new fries and my server agreed and brought new ones apologetically.  It did take about 10-15 minutes to get our order taken (even for drinks).

Sierra C.,"Wenatchee, WA",68,3,,2.0,7/18/2017,"Ill just start by saying ive lived in the area most of my life and ive been coming to this red robin for as long as I can remember. At one point I lived behind the restaurant and ate there once or twice a week. I'm not sure if there is just new management at the facility or what. But in the last year the service as well as the food has just turned to crap. On the last 10 visits even if its very slow we have struggled to find our server for more than the initial order and bringing the check. Today was the final straw though and we will not be returning. My husband and I both decided to try the big boss bbq burger, sounded delicious. Mine was overcooked and just meh. His came out missing the bbq sauce and the pork for the burger. How does that even happen when its the same burger on the same ticket!!?! Took forever for our server to come check on it and get a new one ordered. Manager came out and apologized said they were making him a new one. Server brought us our check and said the burger was taken off our bill and apologized again. It wasn't until after I paid that I realized it was in fact still on our bill and when I brought it to the attention of our waitress all I got was a oh no I'm sorry I have no idea how that happened.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee

Charles H.,"Okanogan, WA",50,21,4,1.0,4/12/2016,"I'll admit that it's been years since I've eaten here, and if they've since improved then more power to them. But it was this Red Robin that has soured me on the whole chain. On four different occasions, in four different years, with four equally indifferent waitresses my dining experience here was less than deplorable. On none of those occasions was the place anywhere near 1/3 capacity and yet we were made to sit and wait and wait and wait for our order to be taken. We then had to watch our food get back to very near room temperature as it wasted away under the heat lamps within sight of us as wait staff was nowhere in sight. In short, this is the one restaurant in Wenatchee that I refuse to try again. As you drive down the Ave just look in the windows and see who has more traffic: this peculiar Red Robin or the Applebee's next door. That alone ought to tell potential customers who should get their patronage. And again: if they've since improved more power to them.

Gen F.,"Kent, WA",1,2,,1.0,12/28/2016,"I am giving 1 star because our server did an okay job and the food was ok. That being said I am extremely disappointed in the other staff that works there. I came in to eat after traveling and realized my son's diaper leaked through and his clothes were wet. My husband ended up running across the parking lot to Old Navy and getting him some dry clothes to wear. While he was gone I ordered for our family and when he returned I changed my son in the bathroom. I was pretty stressed out and distracted by the situation and ending up leaving my handbag under the table. We left and visited family and I realized I left my bag there. We were there from about 2:30-3:30 and I came to this realization around 6:00. I called and they said it had not been turned in and I described where I was and said that I would be coming to check for myself. I got there and the bag was gone and the table and floor were obviously clean. One of the hostesses told me my bag was found but the other two said they checked their safe and it wasn't in there. I asked them to ask around and check one more time because I live 2.5 hours away from this location. Reluctantly I left empty handed. I thought about it and I knew that the busser had to have picked it up. I had two small kids who make a mess and I know that the table would have been cleaned right after we left. I called back and said I was calling the police because I knew that it had to have been found by an employee and I would press theft charges and get an attorney as well because the contents and the bag were valued at over $1,500 and there were other items that were irreplaceable that my mother had given to me. Miraculously, the manager Cassidy said it had been found and they were unsure of how to contact me which was untrue because I called and I came in and left my name & number and made it clear that I was distraught. I also found it strange that one of the girls said it was found and the others said it wasn't. The manager's excuse was that they change shifts at around 3. I would think that they would have had it together enough to know where it was a couple hours after the shift change. I let them know my mother in law would be picking my bag up for me today. When she got there, she was told it wasn't found and then all of a sudden it was in their safe. So is it in a safe or in an imaginary safe or what? The staff is either unorganized, liars, thieves, or all of the above. I am so disappointed in this and I will never again eat at this location. Yes - I should not have forgotten my bag but to have to threaten police involvement and charges to get it back and the way I was jerked around is despicable. I am glad my mother in law was able to get my bag for me and that I have my keepsakes back but the way this was handled was ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee
Nicole S.,"East Wenatchee, WA",72,11,55,3.0,1/27/2016,Red Robin is a great place to go with the family.  My kids love the mac n' cheese and chicken-on-a-stick.  Burger for me.  The fries are the best here.   I love the updated presentation and rectangular-shaped plates too.  The entire dining area got a remodel and the clear panel of glass does a lot to soften the noise level in the room.  I also like their effort to lighten up their iconic décor while still keeping the classics.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee
Leyna S.,"Edmonds, WA",72,57,62,3.0,11/25/2015,"Just what you'd expect. OK service, very crowded, sometimes the food is soggy, and they push you to use their stupid space-taking digital ordering system.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee
Tia M.,"Mukilteo, WA",562,287,216,5.0,8/22/2015,Great service... quick and easy. It's red robin food... not gourmet if that's what you are expecting.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee
Ruth B.,"Seattle, WA",41,31,15,1.0,3/8/2016,Very disappointing. There was nothing gourmet about the 14 dollar southern charm burger. Meat tasted like it was previously frozen and was burnt. The bun was soggy and the lettuce was limp and mostly the spine of the lettuce. The bacon was chewy and not good eats. The garlic fries were a disgrace...tasted frozen and were completely soggy. I dont understand the good reviews on here...must be a lot of people with low standards. The dishes were dirty and wet. Gross...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee

Angela S.,"Seattle, WA",63,173,68,4.0,12/3/2008,"I've decided that the next time I come back, it will be around 8pm on a Wednesday evening. Granted, I like people, but not crowds of people... During peak lunch and dinner hours they are packed... packed to the point where you have to wait... I don't have patience when I'm hungry!!  I like to hear my conversations when I'm eating and during the those peak times.. it gets quite hectic, but the waitstaff sure do know what they are doing even with times like that! There were only a handful of people tonight... 5 occupied tables at the most when my friend and I came here to eat dinner.  Customer service is always great here, they sure know how to be people friendly, food is always good too! No complaints from me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee?start=40
Diamond D.,"Wenatchee, WA",0,5,,1.0,1/22/2016,Went to Red Robin last night for a date night out with my husband never been to this one . It was really loud when we got there . Never been to a restaurant that had tablets on the tables you could order on it play games call the waiter or waitress ect. I started playing with it before are meal came playing games not realizing we were being charged to play them and nothing to let us know that if you did start you were going be charged I should of known nothings for free now days ha ha . Meal was very expensive for a place like this a burger place you wouldn't think it would cost 50 dollars for both of us to eat but it did if we would of known how expensive this place was we would of went to Buzz Inn on the east Wenatchee side  and got a steak good food and more of it for the cost. Drinks were high way robbery are drinks alone were five dollars and over for each  I had a strawberry lemonade and he had a beer that's over the top for drinks most restaurants are high on drinks but not that high .Meal was okay but nothing exceptional my husband had something that was hot on his burger thank God it didn't make him sick. Meal ticket was given to us from that tablet it had charged us for playing games on it 2.00 I know it doesn't sound like a lot but it all adds up and that is so ridicules I couldn't believe it. And then wanted us to give a 9 dollar tip on top of a very expensive meal that wasn't  that great and he almost couldn't get it off the tablet to make it less . All in all needles to say food was not that good very noisy place to eat and prices are over rated there are much better places to eat here in Wenatchee then here. In saying this I won't be back and I sure won't recommend this place for sure because of high prices and hidden fees and If you do decide to eat here God for Bid don't touch that tablet what ever you do let the waiter or waitress do it for you then check it out when it's all said and done so that you don't have hidden fees I hope this helps some one out there looking to eat at this restaurant.

Andrew S.,"Woodinville, WA",141,149,11,5.0,9/11/2010,"This Red Robin is probably one of, if not the best Red Robin I've been to.  I came here with 19, yes, one-nine, other college students, at about 12:30, and we were seated within five minutes of getting there. That's impressive, honestly.  The waitress was entirely cool, and did a great job following through with our very complicated, hold-that, extra-this orders. We started out with drinks, I got the Oreo milkshake, which came out perfectly; it was cold, it was tasty, and it was fresh!  Then we got some baskets of fries to munch on, and the waitress was great about bringing us multiple containers of ranch, and really whatever else we needed. She also was sure to refill our drinks if they even looked like they were getting empty.  I ordered the fish and chips, and it came out hot, and pretty tasty. The tartar was good, and from what I could tell, this wasn't frozen-put-in-the-fryer stuff, it was freshly made.  Then, they had an extra burger and fries that they made, and announced to the entire restaurant, the burger and fries were free to anyone who wanted it! I've never seen that before, but it was awesome! In accordance with the doctor's advice, I didn't get dessert, but I could imagine it'd be pretty good.  Overall, a great restaurant, and I'd highly recommend a visit! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee?start=40
bill w.,"East Wenatchee, WA",21,34,7,2.0,11/8/2012,"An operational nightmare.....this place has struggled to be ran properly since it opened.    Having each entree timed so they are both at least warm.....  Thinking that maybe the appetizers might actually come before the entrees..  Or even hoping that those little details like tartar sauce would be brought with the order,,,,,rather than having to spend half your meal waiting for your ""server"" to come check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wenatchee?start=40
