T S.,"Springfield, MA",149,56,35,4.0,1/29/2015,After reading all the negative reviews I wanted to post about my POSITIVE experience at this restaurant!  I had a fabulous server and she was very attentive to my experience the whole time!   The fries I was served were very crispy and cooked fresh. I saw this because I was seated right by the kitchen. For my entree I had the Av.o.cobb.o salad which was so delicious! Fresh chicken and avocado! I had a very nice experience here and can't wait to go back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham
Jennifer R.,"Brimfield, MA",60,79,74,3.0,5/23/2017,"Our experience here usually isn't too bad. Typical chain restaurant quality food. There's plenty of options for burgers and I'd definitely suggest the ""burnin love"" if you like spicy. Also, if you order a burger, you get bottomless fries delivered to your table before the meal comes (although I've found at most Red Robin's you actually have to ask for this). I'd also recommend asking for campfire sauce for dipping fries!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham
Amuse B.,"Northampton, MA",549,1981,2327,5.0,6/12/2017,"I'm not usually compelled to review chain restaurants but Andrew was so excellent that I had to. He was beyond friendly and conversational and really made our experience great. Our food was great too, I got the mad love burger on a lettuce wrap. What I love about Red Robin is that they're friendly to low carb and keto peeps. Any burger can happen on a lettuce wrap and you can get broccoli with a side of garlic aioli (sooooo good) instead of fries. But this review goes out to Andrew who was the archetype of an awesome waiter. I don't know if he was the manager but if not he should be!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham
Tara B.,"Indian Orchard, MA",2,8,6,2.0,10/7/2016,"ALWAYS stingy with their fries. I ordered to-go. In my order, I asked for extra fries. When I picked up my order, I asked again about my extra fries. The server politely smiled and said, ""yes I put your extra fries in here.""  I got home to find just a few extra fries in the box. Why are they so stingy with their fries when the offer unending fries?!?!?!?!? The picture is what we got for ""extra fries."" Why bother?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham
Kim H.,"Wilbraham, MA",15,7,,1.0,4/15/2017,"First off I am 61, and I had to show my ID to get a beer. Secondly it took 38 min to get me my burger that was wrong. I would recommend going to the one in Holyoke instead",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham
Eileen K.,"Ludlow, MA",0,60,48,1.0,3/3/2017,"A group of us went to Red Robin last week.  There were many empty tables yet the guy who seats people had to make us wait while he went into the bar to look around.  No one else was waiting.  The server was polite yet somewhat odd.  He stood at our table making small talk while we were eating.  He was telling us a story that none of us cared to hear, we just wanted him to leave us alone and maybe go get us some fries. The tables were sticky and dirty. They advertise bottomless fries yet they are reluctant to actually give fries when ordered.  For 4 of us, they gave a small basket with enough fries for one small child,  our party consisted of all adults.  We asked for more fries and after waiting 25 minutes for our meals, our fries still hadn't arrived.  He asked if we still wanted them and we all said yes. He never brought any extra fries.  He didn't refill our drinks. The food was mediocre and not worth the price.  Next time we will go to one of the local pubs for much better burgers.   Our biggest complaint was the filthy tables, chairs and floors as well as the slow, odd service.  The following was my review from 2 years ago. This place has really gone down hill! 9/13/2014 Red Robin is good if you are just looking for a burger and fries.   Ashlee was our waitress today.  Because of her I gave 4 stars rather than 3.  She is one of the best waitresses we have ever had.  She is aways happy, helpful, and pleasant.  She seems to really like serving people.   Red Robin is lucky to have her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham

Desiree C.,"Hampden, MA",0,11,3,1.0,1/28/2017,My son and I had lunch here yesterday and boy was  that a mistake.Our server was lazy and slow I watched her stand at the counter for 5 minutes holding my side of mayo while she talked with the guys cooking the food.My burger was gross and had a Strange almost rotten meat smell the fries were soggy and cold.

Elle V.,"Granby, MA",6,77,27,2.0,1/9/2016,Red Robin is for burgers and fries and that's what we got. Fries were cold but burgers ok - how do you forget the guacamole on a bacon guacamole burger?

Steve R.,"Springfield, MA",33,21,1,2.0,2/29/2016,"Normally this location is ok to good. However this past Saturday, the service was poor, our utensils and flatware were filthy! They gave us drinks with no straws. Also we ordered an app and they never brought it out, yet charged us for it. And anything that was fried had the aftertaste of seafood. With so many other options in the area we may not be back. Too bad. We like Red Robin. Also the fries all had a greenish twinge to them which we found odd. Also, my better half took 2 bites out of her burger and said something isn't right with that! And lost her appetite!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham
Wayne D.,"West Springfield, MA",0,33,,4.0,5/31/2016,"IT's a decent chain restaurant that offers all you can eat fries.  How can you beat that?  The food is good and they usually get it right.  It's reasonably priced, service is good.  It's a chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham
Nate B.,"Southwick, MA",0,18,,2.0,7/8/2016,Seating takes a while. Even on dead days. There was at least 50 empty settings yet we were 6th in line to be seated and waited over 12 minutes. Lol it's a joke. After being seated service is well but the hostess on both occasions need to be taught organization skills.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham
Dan B.,"Brimfield, MA",0,5,1,1.0,1/25/2016,"The service was horrible.  I walked in during lunch, when they were not busy at all and stood at the front area ""waiting to be seated"".  I walked into the bar area and sat at the bar thinking I would be greeted there, but instead was asked if I was ""picking up"". I told them I was here to eat and they walked away and no one came by again.  After 5 more minutes, I walked out.  People saw me, associates were laughing in the back but no one was concerned about the people waiting.....  Never again will I eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham
Scott P.,"Springfield, MA",46,380,1544,2.0,10/11/2014,"Do yourself a favor and spend your money at the other more upscale burger joints in the area. Red Robin with its clichéd wall art is at the lower end of burger joints and even restaurants. My only reason for eating here was a $25 gift card I had to use. Ordered the boneless buffalo wings for an appetizer. They were dry, hard, and overcooked. They lacked any of the sauce we asked for and were the worst we've ever had. The servers were stressed, confused, and short staffed. Leading to our burgers coming out while we were still eating our appetizer. The burgers were mediocre, and weren't even in the same league as a Luxe, Plan B or Max Burger. The beef patty was very thin and flavorless, and was not worth the $10-13 price tag they're charging. Sure the gimmicky bottomless fries and free refills are cool, but don't think for a second you're not paying for them in the high burger prices. Red Robin is a childish teenage nightmare catering to the unsophisticated palates of the blissfully ignorant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham
Jim V.,"Germanton, NC",0,22,6,4.0,7/27/2015,"I would give them a 5 star rating but the coke was flat and the Mac and cheese was cold.  The redeeming factor was that the staff responded immediately to both complaints, replacing the soda and having a new order of Mac & cheese made quickly.  BTW, the Blue Haze is exceptional and the DOH for dessert was very sweet but very good.  If the issues had not arisen, this would be a 5 without question.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham

Joanna F.,"Stoneham, MA",215,725,,3.0,1/21/2013,"It is exactly as I thought it would be.  Having never been to a Red Robin, my husband and I decided to try it since it's down the street from my parents' house.  Decor is kind of a cheesy, 50s-ish diner feel and it's definitely super family oriented. Our waitress was really personable and nice once she actually showed up, but it took her about 10-15 minutes to greet us.  They have a pretty good beer list for a chain restaurant and a lot of wine and cocktails also.  I stuck with a Steel Rail while my husband went crazy and ordered a Guinness milkshake (ice cream, Guinness and whiskey).  The shake was ludicrously delicious (probably the best thing we had the entire time there). On to the food.  In an attempt to be healthy, I got the California Chicken sandwich without mayo or bacon.  I thought the guac on top would provide more than enough moisture and the provolone sounded delicious.  I also got steamed broccoli on the side.  The chicken ended up being very good but the guac was almost nonexistent and definitely not fresh (unsurprisingly) so my sandwich ended up being pretty dry.  The steamed broccoli was not covered in butter or oil, which I really liked. My husband got the ""Royal Red Robin"" (burger with cheese, bacon, and an egg over easy).  The egg was definitely over hard and not runny at all, which was kind of disappointing, but overall it seemed fine. One comment - I'm not really complaining, but I was kind of surprised by the portions.  They were reasonable, but I thought the side of fries with my husband's burger would be massive, but it was actually pretty small.  If you're STARVING, you may be a bit disappointed. Overall, I may come back, but I think I would rather go to Friendly's down the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilbraham
D N.,"Three Rivers, MA",0,3,,2.0,6/6/2012,Service was O.K. food was blha...

Paul M.,"Ludlow, MA",2,25,8,1.0,9/24/2014,"Extremely disappointed! We will not be back to this location. Ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, terrible it came to the table in a small soup cup that has been microwaved. The buns on the burgers tasted like they were three days old and definitely not fresh. The fries were cold as if its been sitting there waiting to be served for to long. The waitress put a check on the table before we even had a third bite of our burgers. Used to be a good location when it was new, now terrible food, terrible service, and overpriced. Skip this place if you're looking for a good burger and service! The only reason I'm giving it one because I don't have the option to give it no star.

Tom M.,"Amherst, MA",28,69,43,5.0,7/6/2011,"Two years of constant RR visits and I continue to love the chain, the service and the prices. I visit once every two, three weeks. The big difference? Now, I've tried the Banzai Burger. It changed my life. For anyone that's afraid of a burger with pineapple on it, don't be. It's mindblowing. This seems like a limited time menu item, but if they still have it, get the Apple Pie Bites. They taste so much better than they look, and they look great.

When ordering they quoted 15 minutes she knew it wouldn't be ready that quick got there 20 mins - when she arrived they told her they were waiting on the fries. She waited an additional 25 minutes. When she got home we opened all our orders 2 burgers 2 chicken sandwiches. We each had maybe 6 French fries.. I know it's take out but my god could you be any cheaper for unlimited steak fries...

Chris M.,"Springfield, MA",171,143,91,3.0,5/18/2012,"I like RR for the most part. The novelty of the place has worn off for my family though. We've eaten here and other locations numerous times. Every now and then you end up getting a server that is useless (there have been a few occasions where we had to remind the manager we were still there.) If you get a veteran server you should be all set. If someone in your party has a dietary or allergy concern be sure to spell it out clearly and have them repeat it back to you, no matter how busy they are. We have had a handful of goof ups that likely came from the kitchen but could have been averted by a waitress who was on the ball. Of course the practice of having 'anyone' available bring your food to you without being able to check it doesn't help. The Blue Ribbon burger is good as is the BBQ burger. We've also enjoyed the onion rings. Based on burger purity I prefer 5 Guys as a chain.

Diane R.,"Springfield, MA",0,1,,1.0,1/17/2016,"My husband and I went a couple weeks ago and the service was awful. No attention at all. Dirty dishes left in front of us. Went back yesterday and it was actually worse. We got seated right away and our drink order taken but it was downhill from there. I was seated so that I could see the kitchen and the food up on the warmer. I could see our food sitting there for a good 15 minutes. Also after the waiter brought our drinks we didn't see him again until the end. Finally a different waitress brought us our food, dropped it and left. My burger and fries were really cold and my husbands Mac and cheese wasn't much better. No one ever came by us so I ate the burger finally the waiter comes over and says ""everything good?"" I said no everything is cold he said he would get me more fries about 15 minutes later a different person dropped some fries in front of me. There is no management at all in this place, no one asking how things are just a bunch of waiters and waitresses left to do their own thing.

Danielle M.,"Springfield, MA",9,34,4,2.0,9/23/2012,"We gave up meat recently, but prior to our dietary changes, we loved us some burgers!  Unfortunately, this location is very hit-or-miss with servers. We've had great servers once or twice, but we usually end up with a high school kid who doesn't care too much about their tip. It seems like they're often working there to hangout with their friends who also work there. That may seem a bit harsh, but I'm pretty sure we witnessed something like that when we went a few months ago. The burgers are usually pretty decent, but a little on the pricey side for what it is. The endless fries usually made up for it, though.  Ask your server to start you off with a basket of fries when you put your order in.
