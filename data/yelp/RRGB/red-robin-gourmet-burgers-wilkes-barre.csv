Mark F.,"Wilkes-Barre, PA",0,73,24,4.0,10/5/2015,"UPDATE: It appears they have new managers and have really turned it around.  Had a very pleasant dinner with the family last night and everything was perfect. I have been enjoying red robin for over 10 years at other locations. This location however is HORRIBLE! After several attempts to give this location chances to get it right, I don't think I'll return again. The management is horrible and should be fired. Kitchen staff is inexperienced and sloppy. Waitresses are inexperienced and ditzy. Sloppy wet burgers, freezing cold establishment, slanted and wobbly tables, cold soggy fries, no kids cups, vacuuming the floor next to table while I eat, etc, etc. I could keep going on, but you get the point. It's a dame shame that there's no good employees in the Wilkes barre area for most establishments.  Red robin is a good concept but it just doesn't work here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilkes-barre?start=20

Bri R.,"Berwick, PA",0,47,3,1.0,8/24/2016,This place was horrible. Took 10 minutes for a server to come to our table to take our drink order. Food was okay and came out pretty fast although it was 9 PM. Burger definitely not worth $10.95!! Service just sucked altogether. It was only 72 degrees out side and this place was freezing. I actually had to put the heat on when i went back out to my car! I think ill avoid this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilkes-barre?start=20

Penny D.,"Mountain Top, PA",0,1,,1.0,7/30/2016,Went on a Friday afternoon with my Grandson at around 2:30.  We were seated right away.

Anne L.,"Ellicott City, MD",1,23,,1.0,7/24/2014,"We love our Red Robin at home, and our food at this location came out both fast tasty. Great! Problem? Arrived to a cold blast of AC.  Commented, ""It's cold in here."" Two women who were leaving affirmed our comment.  Asked Lori, the hostess, ""Is the whole restaurant this cold?"" Lori: a curt, ""No."" Then seated us under an air vent.  We spoke to the manager who said they had just adjusted the temp. Cold air continued to blow.  We ordered our (fast and yummy) dinner.  I walked to the bar area and felt the noticeable difference. We were moved. (Yay!!) BTW, I had a fleece jacket. My usually ever-warm husband had goose bumps.  Dear RR Mgmt, Open kitchen plus wait staff working in pants at a fast pace should not be how the temp is determined.

Anthony R.,"Pittston, PA",2,66,16,1.0,4/21/2014,"I love Red Robin Burgers.  What do I love more than steak fries?  Unlimited steak fries!!! So why the 1 star rating?  The management oversight of this Red Robin is about as bad as you can find in a franchise.  The work ethic is damn-near Walmartesque.  I've been here about five times since they opened.  About 18 months ago, my family and I went to the restaurant.  We were seated.  25 minutes later we walked out.  From the moment our butts hit the seat, to the moment we walked out not one Red Robin employee took the time to even say hi, much less take an order.   I complained to Red Robin corporate and got a phone call from the manager.  He was polite, but at the end of the day we agreed that as a customer, it's not my job to beg someone to wait on me.  He offered to discount or pay for our next visit (I can't remember which).  I explained that I'll happily pay for my burger, they just need someone to wait on me. Fast forward to a month or two ago.  We went on a weeknight.  It's not exactly the ""busy"" time.  This time our waitress was quick to come to our table.  45-50 minutes after taking our order, one of the managers asked how our visit was going.  We basically said that for a Saturday night in a packed restaurant, knocking on the door of an hour wait is understood.  In the middle of the week, it's unacceptable.  This manager immediately gave us a gift card because she said that we were correct.  Keep in mind, our food didn't come out while the manager was talking with us.  There was still more time wait. Since I don't have hours to wait for burgers and fries, I gave the gift card to a friend.  He said that they were very attentive when he gave them the card.  But why should you have to do that?  I'm not looking for a free meal.  I just wish that this Red Robin was run like, well, ANY other Red Robin I've been to.  And I get that a good burger in Wilkes-Barre is about impossible to find (why, I have no idea), but take the drive to Dickson City and go to 5 Guys or Red Robin.  The drive to Dickson City is still shorter than the time wasted here. Update: July 2016. Five Guys added a store less than a mile from this Red Robin.  You'd be well-served to go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilkes-barre?start=20

I tried their mac & cheese side once and it was... meh.  I love spicy food so I had their jalapeno burger and it was probably the worst thing I've ever tasted. The bun was a strange texture (cornbread, I think), and the flavor wasn't something I would describe as ""tasty"". I didn't finish it.

Aaron K.,"Orlando, FL",12,115,65,3.0,7/13/2013,"This place was the destination after we walked out of the Wilkes-Barre Perkins.  It did the trick.  Huge burger selection, full bar.  They keep it freezing inside there probably as to keep people from hanging out at their table for hours on end.  Burgers were tasty.  If you are so inclined, the burgers come with unlimited fries but one order was enough for us.  Ziosk stations at each table let you order apps, drinks, desserts, and you can pay your bill without having to wait for anyone.   Pro-tip:  If you do pay your bill using that Ziosk thing, make sure you have gotten everything you might need from the waitress (left over containers, refills, etc) cuz once you pay on that thing, the waitress won't be coming by your table for anything unless you are able to tackle her in passing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilkes-barre?start=20

Michael J.,"Albany, NY",17,246,129,3.0,12/16/2012,"This is my first experience here and it was an interesting one. Let me paint the picture for you. An almost empty resturaunt with more employees than patron. We are seated and all of the tables around us are empty and we are placed in this tiny table. This annoyed me but I digress, the waitress takes about 8 mins to get to us and asks us what we want to drink.  She returns and takes our orders. Two burgers and cheese sticks app. Thirty minutes later the manager arrives with the burgers and I ask him about the appetizer. He apologizes and the waiter forgot to put them in.  The hamburgers were delicious but the bottomless steakfries were laughable. I got about 8-9 in my basket and was never Asked if I wanted more. What annoyed me even more was the tiny table and lack of space for our meal.  So when the appetizer showed up the space problem was there.  If the manager had not caught and corrected the problem ( free appetizer) and apologized I would have given this one or two stars for slowness and lack of attention to detail. The food was superb though. Reccomend if you like a good Burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilkes-barre?start=20

Ate there on a Saturday in the early afternoon.  After the hostess seated the bad of what looked like soccer hooligans, I waited at the hostess stand for a good 10 minutes before I was acknowledged.  Then, as the hostess was about to ask how many were in my party, she took a phone call and completely ignored me.  I guess I needed more tattoos or teenagers rolling their eyes in my party. The server who did take care of me gave me a menu and then came back 30 seconds later expecting me to know what to order.  I don't know, I'm not a Red Robin regular, maybe give me 5 minutes to look at the menu?  I already waited 10 minutes to get seated, what is another 5?  Ordered the salted caramel milkshake and the basic burger.  The milkshake was a bit uneven, salty on the top and caramel on the bottom, as if they missed the basic tenet of ""milk shake"".  The burger was competent. And seriously, what does someone have to do to get some napkins in this joint?  Should I wipe my hands on my shirt like many of the others in the place?  I know some folks in there were down with grease stains on their shirt, but not me.  Heck, the lady with bad David Bowie in Labyrinth tattoo was totally down with that along with liberally picking her nose.  Perhaps a napkin could have helped there?  I mean, you are right next to Dunder-Mifflin, maybe you could convince them to produce some napkins from their paper stock?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilkes-barre
