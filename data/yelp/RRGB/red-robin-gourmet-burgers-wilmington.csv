Heather W.,"Wilmington, NC",61,91,55,3.0,11/3/2015,"Went here today for lunch at about 1:30, i thought it'd be busy but it wasn't. With that being said they had what looked to be only 2 people taking orders. Our waitress hardly spoke to us but maybe 3 times and we had to ask for silverware after  waiting a while. Not impressed with the slowness of service and lack of staff. But there was a very kind guy that I can only assume was the manager and was extremely helpful with information I was asking about and they have toned down the inside, its geared more for adults now than kids. The bar area was a bit dark and could use extra lighting, not everyone has 20/20 vision! All in all, not somewhere I go on a regular basis, only go when others choose.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilmington?start=20

Jessica B.,"Sneads Ferry, NC",42,10,3,2.0,11/5/2016,Dirty! Smeared crusty sauces on the wood around the booth. The bathroom was gross. Each toilet seat was a hover situation. Really slow service at 3 in the afternoon. The lava cake dessert tasted like a packaged cheap cosmic brownie with ice cream on top. So sad. Really loved Red Robin.

Good Eat M.,"Wilmington, NC",0,7,1,1.0,8/12/2016,Long time waiting for food and when it came out food was cold and waitress never came back to table and the endless fries never happen also after I pay the bill and getting ready to leave our waitress came over and asked if everything was ok ????

Cola M.,"Irmo, SC",24,39,8,1.0,7/25/2015,"After informing our waitress, Natalie, of my way over cooked and microwaved French dip, she took it personally and from that point neglected our table to the point that we had to send for her. Upon her return we were greeted with rolling eyes and an attitude to to go with it. Oh and this was after two of the four dishes were sent out wrong. Although, I'm personally not a fan of this chain my party is so I went along and for the fifth visit to two locations in two years, I'm again unimpressed. Oh a side note, as many chains do, this location is undergoing a cosmetic overhaul which would be fine if it didn't reek of paint smell.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilmington?start=20
Craig H.,"Wilmington, NC",0,2,,3.0,5/31/2014,"I had dinner at the Rad Robin tonight.  THE FOOD: I ordered their grilled chicken sandwich on a wheat bun with only lettuce with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was correctly made and very tasty, the chicken was tender & juicy. The fries were decent, but I could tell that they had been sitting out for a while before being served to me.   I was told that the fries were ""bottomless"" and I could refill them, but I was full after one serving. I'm surprised that they are allowed to use the term bottomless in a restaurant with children.  THE BATHROOMS: The men's room had 2 sinks, 2 stalls and a urinal. They were clean, which surprised me because of all the rambunctious kids running around the place. THE WAITRESSES: Our waitress was average looking with no personality. From what I saw you could only call one of the waitresses ""hot."" One waitress's body actually looked like a Tetris block.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilmington?start=20

The fries were decent. You get unlimited fries, but my order was sufficient to the meal. I would never really suggest going to Red Robin unless I see one and we are looking for a quick bite to eat. The ambiance was nice and clean. It is a sit down restaurant. I always thought Red Robin was fast food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilmington?start=20
Carly A.,"Wilmington, NC",7,50,13,4.0,8/25/2014,So glad to see some healthier options on the menu these days! I got a very tasty teriyaki chicken sandwhich on whole wheat with a side salad. I know burger joints are not a mecca of health food but being able to customize my options makes me feel more comfortable splurging here. The staff were friendly and the food came promptly.It is fairly quiet but I have been here when it has been beastly loud as well.

Then the food is barely warm. Great taste. I told the bartender."" Are they going to clone you?"" She was taking orders fixing drinks and serving the entire area. We were there before two other couples and our order came after theirs and all we got was soup and sandwich and it was cold.

Seriously, this place is WAY too loud at night, I have heard that lunch is MUCH better, as they don't give out two year olds at lunch.  $10 for a BURGER, in a plastic basket, are they mad! They got me in here with a $6.99 burger they are promoting, which was actually really good, maybe a little too much in the way of toppings, but good.  I would have to say that the 10 (TEN) happy birthday cheers per hour take away a star all by itself. Mercifully, they make it a short one, but dear God, is a free burger on your birthday worth the doushe-chills? Lastly, I know the fat content of these burgers is off the charts, but the sodium content was the real shocker...all four of us became camels upon arriving home, each of us downing 3-4 full glasses of water.  I think it might have been the queso, which was not very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilmington?start=20

Ellen B.,"Hampstead, NC",0,3,,2.0,11/25/2015,Our second time there in a month and very disappointed in the use of their Kiosk. Why??? A joke. The waitress came twice to take our order and drinks and got them wrong. Then we pay through a kiosk on the table asking for a 20% tip...I don't think so.

Carol E.,"Wilmington, NC",0,13,2,2.0,9/17/2013,"The boca burgers are good.  The new tavern burgers at $6.99 are a good deal.  But if you don't get there before noon, expect a three ring circus of activity and noise.  We usually choose to sit in the bar to avoid the noise of out of control children, but then you have to deal with a waiter who has apparently not learned the art of restraint in the consumption of triple shot macchiatos and whose personality is a cross of game show host/car salesman/ politician.  Not to mention people waiting for tables or take out are allowed to bring their children into the bar to sit in bar stools. (huh?!?) But I am actually thankful for their crappy atmosphere...keeps me away from the place so I can avoid destroying my diet! And on a further note...their Red Robin rewards card requires that you register it on line which also requires that you not only put in all your info (address, phone, e-mail) but you also have to agree to receive advertisements and specials from them via all of those three channels....why can't you just sign up without strings attached?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilmington?start=20

I disagreed and preferred my $ to go to my great server William and not a game that I didn't approve of. I'm only making such a stink on line because I don't want to support a business who's manager was a total asshole to me as I walked out the door. This isn't the way it should have been handled.

I signed up for their Red Robin Royalty Rewards program, so I had a couple of rewards on my account. One of them was for s free burger, which was honestly the only reason I went in. I told the server that I had a reward, so she took my card to verify the rewards before she started, which was great. She stated that I had multiple rewards, and they had to be used in the order in which they were listed, and the free burger was not on top. I asked to speak to the manager, and he did some research. The manager said that if I logged into my account from a phone or something, then I could rearrange the order.

Chuck B.,"Wilmington, NC",11,58,16,3.0,12/30/2007,Their service is fast/friendly and the food is good but the drink and food prices are ridiculous. This is basically a fast food restaurant where adults can get a beer or glass of wine to go alone with their kids happy meal. Well technically speaking this place is a big step up from that other fast food place in that your order is taken at a table by wait staff but it still has the crazy noise level of a fast food joint. The food is also quite a bit better and there are more healthy choices as well. I had the Fish and Chips with the chips replaced by salad (I know my sister would cry 'healthy?' and knock me on the side of my head - the fish is fried) but at least its an attempt. My  biggest complaint is the price of the drinks. We ordered children's (my son never finishes an adult size shake) milkshakes thinking they would be maybe a $1.00 or a $1.50 but oh no hold on to your shorts they were $3.00 each and they were really dinky (as in really small in size). My kid and his friend  loved it though as there were video games for them to play while they waited for me to finish my beer (head knock...again).,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wilmington?start=40
