Koree Z.,"Bath Beach, Brooklyn, NY",37,12,3,4.0,11/20/2017,"This was my first time eating at Red Robin and it was indeed a great experience. I make a lot of burgers and consider myself unmatched, but they Red Robin stole the show. I ordered an A1 burger and subbed the cheddar for Mozzarella and added sliced pickles and raw onions. That made for a hefty burger accompanied by delicious endless fries. The burger was cooked medium well as requested and was still warm when served. I was tempted to eat another one but the endless fries hit the spot. Fries are the potato fries that look like wedges from Popeyes (unseasoned) except these were baked or cooked hot and very soft.  Although the food was great, the service was more impressionable. I was served by MEGAN. Please do remember that name because it was her service that will ensure I drive back to NJ from NY to eat at this place and the reason you want to head out to this place. Megan makes one mean Margarita! Had 2 and it snuck up on me very quickly (and these were house drinks at $5.50 if memory serves me right). She serves you the way she would want to be served and her consistent follow-up and attention to detail was unmatched (not to mention she was very forward and open to conversation with a smile every time and even shared personal life experience when I made conversation).  Definitely a place I would say the score does not reflect the experience I recently had. My only grief was the fries are small in quantity when they first come out. But, since they're endless I didn't mind. Then again, I'm a person with big a big appetite, it is possible the serving was proportional and I'm just glutinous.

Kevin K.,"South Orange, NJ",182,4,,2.0,1/14/2018,"I came here with my boyfriend on a Sunday. We enter from within the mall, and it looks fairly busy. Here, you have to walk through the entire restaurant to the other entrance in order to be seated by the staff. Weird but okay. We're seated at a booth, and the waiter took our order. We ordered an appetizer and two burgers. We waited about 30-45 min for our food, with our burgers coming out first. I was a bit peeved off by this cause I was hungry. We were about to cancel the appetizer when the waiter apologized and offered the appetizer we ordered on the house. That was okay with us (Hey, free food basically). Burgers were okay (a bit subpar), but the fried were good. Last, we ordered two milkshakes - a mint brownie one and an Oreo cookie crumble one. AND IT WAS THE MOST DISAPPOINTING MILKSHAKE WE'VE EVER HAD. Like, the people in the back didn't even try. The mint brownie one didn't even have brownies in it and didn't taste like mint; it was just food dyed green. The Oreo one tasted like a cup of milk that someone put Hershey's chocolate syrup in and that's it. No oreos whatsoever.  The service from our waiter was excellent with the amount of work he had and the volume of the place during our stay. His name is Anthony Ca. He's probably the only reason I kinda liked being here.  Overall, would not recommend this place to anyone.  Ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge
Ana C.,"Union, NJ",209,119,241,4.0,11/20/2017,"This is the only Red Robin I've ever been to so I can't compare them to other locations. I first came here soon after they opened and have eaten here like 2-3 times a year. They have an extensive menu with lots of ways to customize your order. They have burgers, salads, and entrees along with appetizers and dessert. There's a full bar with many of their own special drinks with a variety of non alcoholic beverages as well such as milkshakes and flavored lemonades. I've had some of their drinks and never had a bad one. If you're trying to eat healthy they actually have a page in the menu with suggestions such as eating it open faced or ""wedgie style"" (wrapped in lettuce) if you wanna cut carlories. There's different breads you can ask for and they also have a veggie burger that you can substitute with. All burgers come with unlimited fries that you can substitute with cole slaw or a salad at no additional charge. There's a bunch of other options that I can't recall at the moment. If you're in the area and in the mood for a burger and  the fries your heart desires, I'd say it's worth giving them a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge
Shanika G.,"Burlington Township, NJ",66,94,65,1.0,2/19/2017,"I don't think I would ever come to this location again. Unless they hired cooks who actually understand the importance of chicken being thoroughly cooked. My husband ordered boneless wings as an appetizer (see image). Two of the wings were not cooked entirely. My children and I had meals that were cooked thoroughly, but when my husband's entree came out, his food was overly cooked.

When we walked in my family waited for awhile to be seated.  Then once we already annoyed but really hungry a worker in the back yells ""there is a booth back here "" so we walk back and get seated in the booth. We pick what we want on the menu but nobody ever comes to our table asking for our orders. Instead all the workers are fighting over which one of them is going to serve us. After waiting for too long my family and the family sitting in the booth next to us decided to leave. We told the workers that this is bad service. Only after we say this is when one of the workers says he will serve if we stay. We said no thanks and left.

Kim F.,"Rahway, NJ",0,56,4,2.0,11/26/2017,"Nothing too memorable about this place. Food was typical of a chain restaurant. I ordered the Black and Blue burger, but it came with no blue cheese on it. It just had blue cheese 'sauce', which was very watered down. The garlic fries looked like someone literally scooped a chunk of minced garlic out of a jar and threw it on top. It was not mixed together at all. The service was good and so was the Guinness, but overall I would rather go to another chain like Applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge

Mark H.,"Monroe Township, NJ",2,54,,5.0,5/21/2017,"The burgers here are delicious.  And, the Tavern Burgers are a great deal at $6.99 including unlimited fries.  The fries can be substituted for coleslaw, steamed broccoli, side salad or black beans at no additional charge.  There are many substitutions for an up-charge including mac and cheese, sweet potato fries, onion rings, chili and soup. There are a few places I go to to have a burger on a gluten free bun - Cheeburger Cheeburger, Fridays, Smashburger and here.  The GF buns at Fridays and here are the tastiest.  I like the burgers here and at Smashburger (which is really overpriced).  And Red Robin is the only one of these four to have fries that are genuinely gluten free (they use a dedicated fryer). Plus, the fries are unlimited! For taste and value, if you are looking for a Gluten Free burger and fries, there is just no comparison to Red Robin.  It is the best by far.  If I was still able to eat gluten, this would still be my first choice for a great tasting burger and fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge

John D.,"Old Bridge Township, NJ",60,68,13,1.0,2/18/2016,"The worst Red Robin, by far. I'm normally a fan of their burgers, so I have occasionally visited this location. Don't do it. The service is HORRIBLE! For our last visit, we arrived around 11:30AM. There were a couple of tables taken, and the rest of the place was empty. We stood at the mall entrance door, waiting to be seated, as the sign requests...and waited some more. I finally walked into the middle of the restaurant to find the hostess just standing there. I asked ""Are you open?"", to which I got ""Sure, where would you like to sit."". I then walked back to get the rest of my group and we sat ourselves. Eventually a server came over to take our drink orders. She may have gone to the grocery store across town to fill them. She then disappeared for a bit and came back for our food order.  The onion ring tower was actually good, albeit overpriced at almost $1 per onion ring. The burgers were certainly nothing to brag about, and not the masterpieces one would expect after the kitchen took as long as they did to make them. I ordered a Guacamole Bacon burger that came to me with more mayo than Guac. There was a slight spread of what I'm assuming was guacamole holding some shredded lettuce to the top bun. This also came with a whopping 2 slices of the thinnest cut bacon of all time.  The fries tasted like they had been sitting...HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE when they had just opened for the day??? After we ate we paid using the table kiosk. The receipt would not print as they didn't bother to load it with paper. We waited around to get a receipt from the server, but she did not return, so we just left. There are other burger places around, and even better Red Robins to visit. Don't bother with this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge

Benson Y.,"New York, NY",370,1191,874,4.0,1/4/2015,"I've never been to a Red Robin before this visit.  I had heard the ads on the radio and TV before with their familiar jingle, but I always chalked it up to one of those places I'd never get to experience in real life. Not too long ago, a steakhouse in Woodbridge mall closed, and in its place?  A Red Robin.  After passing it for several months, I finally decided to check it out. Red Robin seems to have a fondness for 80's to 90's pop culture.  The walls had tons of retro posters on the wall (including classics like ""Back to the Future"" and ""Indiana Jones"").  The tables and booths all have a wood, almost ""Hollywood Western"" motif.  It's welcoming the way a sports bar is welcoming.  It looks like a place you can just kind of hang out and relax. The service was good, but the young ladies who were running the place have a lot of floor space to cover.  The hostess seemed a tad frazzled when my girlfriend and I entered, but our waitress was very nice and on point.  We were offered refills of our drinks and requests for extra sauces were happily filled after our food arrived. I tried the D.G.B. burger which the menu describes as: ""Oven-roasted tomatoes, savory roasted garlic aioli and fresh arugula tossed in citrus olive oil dressing on a toasted ciabatta bun.""  The burger was absolutely delicious.  Most, with a roll that my knife cut into without a problem (this burger you see, was a knife and for burger).  The burger had a nice grilled char flavor while the other ingredients offered some brightness into the mix.   We also tried the Tower of Onion Rings.  That is exactly what it sounds like - a tower of onion rings on a giant metal ring.  These were big rings and not uniform like the Burger King ones.  No, these are like the ones you get in a good diner and they were crispy and delicious.  They came with two dipping sauces that were both sweet and savory at the same time.  It was with great effort we did not demolish the entire tower in one sitting. I enjoyed Red Robin, but man, it is greasy food and I can't do it very often!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge?start=20
Laura G.,"Staten Island, NY",0,39,,5.0,5/21/2017,"Went there yesterday for lunch,it was my first visit it won't be my last.

I ordered the Southern Burger,with candied bacon,caramelized onions,and cheese. The burger came medium rare and off the roll as I requested. It was cooked perfectly. The steak fries were very well seasoned. My friend had grilled chicken,which she was was moist and tasty.  I couldn't believe they give you bottomless fries,or will allow some substitutions. And the bottomless drink refill amazing. I also used the ladies room and was very impressed that it was clean,and they even had 2 sinks one which was lower so a wheelchair bound person could actually use it!!

Sean M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,41,13,4.0,5/1/2016,"Had an issue a few years ago where a previous manager was extremely rude - I called head management and they were very friendly and apologized for his behavior. I decided to give it another try after a few years. It seems, not surprisingly, the old manager has been replaced. This recent visit the service was friendly, but slow. The service was so slow that the food went cold. This, because it sat waiting to be delivered for 20 minutes, despite the restaurant only being about half full. The new manager firmly warned the wait staff to not let the food sit until it is cold, apologized, and had new food cooked for us. It took about 15 - 20 minutes sitting at the table waiting before we even saw our server. We also sat with empty drinks for about 30 minutes before we asked someone other than our server for drinks. However, that being said, the food is actually very good. The burgers are cooked correctly and as requested, with quality beef. There are some interesting specialty burgers as well. Another benefit it the ability to see into the kitchen. The chefs are high energy and the kitchen looks clean. Overall, I recommend it for a burger restaurant.

Jeff D.,"Jersey City, NJ",295,651,263,1.0,11/8/2014,"Now I've never been to Red Robin. Until recently I had never lived close to one and never really had much desire to make a trip out of going.  At the same time, I'd consider myself to be a burger guru and the fact that I now work practically across the street from this location made it seem like I should just give in and come here. Sadly, I should've stayed away. We walked in on a rainy Thursday afternoon with barely anyone in the restaurant, yet were told that there would be a short wait. I usually don't mind waiting but I did find this a bit odd. Anyway we were sat within a few minutes. As we were walked to our table, we could make out a view of the onion ring tower sitting on the kitchen counter where the chefs put the orders. I should note that part of our visit revolved around ordering these onion rings.  The menu here is extensive. Tons of burgers to choose from and most of them sound pretty great. Our server, who was also the bartender, came to take our order, only to return just a few minutes later with our onion ring tower, the same onion ring tower that was sitting on the counter when we first walked in! Not only were the rings, not warm, they were completely cold. We flagged down our server who apologized and brought us a fresh batch.  As far as the burger goes, I was disappointed. I ordered the Peppercorn Burger medium rare, which ended up being medium well. The ingredients, which included bacon, peppercorns, cheddar, and onion straws barely made up for tasteless burger. It was just a very uninspired burger. The steak fries (which are bottomless) did prove to be pretty good.  Furthermore, we had to flag down our waitress for drink refills and sauce for my buddy's burger, which he originally ordered. He also ordered sweet potato fries and after asking for another order was served steak fries. Our waitress's only saving grace was that she was nice and apologetic but severely lacking in attentiveness.  With so many strikes, I would've figured that some menu items could've been taken off the bill, especially the onion rings, but no such offer was made. I would say that next time I will complain more, but there won't be a next time anytime soon. I ended up dropping around $20 for lunch, which could've been put to so many, no, any use.  Please save yourself the money, time and calories and stay away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge?start=20

Meridith Z.,"Union Beach, NJ",85,145,46,2.0,9/1/2014,":sigh: I knew what I was getting myself into, but I was really in the mood for a burger on an onion roll.  The hostess sat us right away. The front door is bashed in and has some construction sign. Id love to hear that story.  Sat us at the legit smallest booth ever in the world. Fine. Told our server would be Alexis. I wish it had been, because we got a goon named Chris and it was downhill from there.  He greeted us within 30 seconds, my brother and I hadn't even opened our menus and he was in our faces talking a mile a minute. He joked that he would bring us the onion tower with our drinks. I'm not laughing.  This is a place where they try to memorize your meal as to not write down your order. Reciting it back he had already messed up and didn't even go away yet.  We had been given two napkins and no silverware.  I ran to the bathroom which was DISGUSTING.  Food came quickly and was delivered by a really nice girl. I saw she was someone else's waitress and was jealous. ""Chris"" was chatting with other staff, breaking glasses, and avoiding our table. I needed a knife and napkins and the nice girl brought it for us.  ""Chris"" comes speed walking past, tossing a ""everything good?"" As he kept walking. Sure Chris.  He didn't ask if we needed refills. Ran by a little later and dropped off our check. Sorry we didn't spend a lot of money on our late lunch. Guess he thought he wouldn't be getting a big tip and treated us like crap. I saw him bringing stuff to other tables who had alcohol and appetizers.  Also: the tables never got bussed. We were there for an hour and the same tables had dirty dishes on it. When ""Chris"" cleared our dishes, he simply put them on the clean table next to us.  I'll make my own burgers.

Jav D.,"Elizabeth, NJ",554,50,406,1.0,7/26/2015,"Well let me start by saying the place felt like a cafeteria not a restaurant. Ordered a burger with an ice tea. The ice tea should have been called warm tea, I was so thirsty I wanted something cold to quench my thirst but didn't get that. After waiting for like 25 my burger finally came. The meat wasn't hot tasted like it was sitting there waiting to be picked up. The restaurant wasn't packed so I don't know why it took so long . The bread was the main issue. I don't know if the bread was old or that's how it is. How do you eat a burger when the bead falls apart in your hands. Every time I picked up the burger it apart. At one point I ended up with just the burger and toppings on my hands. I was so hungry too.  I noticed the table next to us left a pile of bread and left unhappy saying they had rice and beans at home.  Now to come back again that's not happening again not throwing my money away like that again. I rather eat White Castle burgers than from this place . At least the bread stays together.  I would not recommend this place to friends or strangers.  Their jingle should be "" red robin blah"". Instead of yum . I forgot I ordered a strawberry lemonade to replace my warm ice tea, how about using fresh strawberries not strawberries from a jar sitting in preservatives. The strawberries looked old and soggy not bright red and firm like a fresh strawberry should look like. Good thing I left and not ordered desert .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge?start=40

We were seated at a booth in the bar area and although the service was a touch on the slower side, the waitress was also the bartender.  She was friendly and tried hard to be where she needed to be.  The food came out exactly as ordered, the waitress even checked back twice to see if we wanted more bottomless fries.  The hamburger and fries were satisfying. I had some kind of specialty ghost burger that was spicy. I really enjoyed it.  Drinks were good.  We tried the blue moon summer tea, interesting and refreshing but 1 was enough.  We both then had a mixed drink for $7 each and they were also good.

James D.,"Hazlet, NJ",0,2,,1.0,12/29/2015,I went there for dinner yesterday with my two children. We went at about 5pm before the dinner rush. The place seemed to be maybe 20% full at most. There were empty tables everywhere. We entered into the area to wait to be seated and no one greeted us. We waited for quite a while. I had never been there so my daughter said she thinks we were supposed to seat ourselves. I grabbed 3 menus and we found a table. We waited again quite a while and were told we needed to go up front and wait to be seated. We left and walked the mall a bit but returned about a half hour later to try again. I guess that waiting part soured my expectations slightly. I just thought the food was just OK. For one adult and two children with no appetizers the bill with tip was over $50. I had no appetizers a blue cheese burger and a lemonade. My daughter had a blue cheese burger and a small milkshake. My son ordered off the children menu and got a milkshake and mac and cheese. The portions were VERY small. My son ate his mac and cheese in about 30 seconds. It was about half a coffee cup full of mac and cheese and some mandarin oranges. I ate my burger very quickly and had the tiniest bit of French fries. Maybe 8 medium sized fries in a small cylinder. I thought the sign said unlimited fries but I was never offered any more and only saw my waiter once when he brought the food. You pay yourself with some computer thing on the table. It wasn't terrible food but I thought it was a poor value and poor customer service. It wasn't any kind of dining experience and I would NOT recommend it to a family. For under $50 I could have easily just went to McDonalds.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge?start=60

Well, here, they have your special menu that you order from and they serve your food separately from the rest of the tables and call it the allergy order - which is a little weird, but hey, at least i am fairly confident that it isn't going to kill me.

Kevin S.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",2,14,3,1.0,12/22/2013,"First of all,this place has poorly trained staff all around, from servers to bartenders. At times, I couldn't tell how many bartenders there were, if any at all. There was no one in site!  Second of all, let me state that as a bartender in a busy restaurant myself, staff should be expected to serve and bartend in tandem! NOT TO MENTION, this place was not even busy at this time! My friends and I wanted to just sit at the bar, have a drink and grab a quick snack while watching football. Let me tell you what a major fail this ended up being. We sat down and weren't greeted at all for about 10 min and then finally a bartender came around to get us a drink. We ordered the Irish beer milkshake or something like that. It took about another 15-20 min to make and serve it. ( I don't think you should be making these kinds of drinks if they're gonna take that long to make )  After being served our drinks, all we wanted to order were fries, which took about 30 to 45 min to arrive. That's a poor effort on whomever is running the kitchen. Poor kitchen management for sure.  Whilst I was sitting at the bar, I only noticed one bartender taking orders and working the service bar. There was another girl doing just about nothing to help the other bartender out. She sat at a table and watched the other bartender work countless amounts of tickets. Finally, the only competent bartender became  frustrated enough to speak up. And here's the real kicker, the girl comes up to the service window and says ..."" I can't do this, I'm about to just throw these tickets out I can't deal with these milk shakes and drinks, this is crazy"" Ummm hello !!! You're a bartender in a busy restaurant, you have to work the window once in a while. Get up off your bottom and help out your fellow bartender.  Now, I was ok with the bartender until we asked to pay using three cards. We asked for the check and she never gave it to us! After 15 minutes, we asked again to split it and she goes, ""Oh come on, really?!?!"" That was unexpected and not how you want to treat your guests. We should feel free to pay any way we want. So I ended up paying the whole bill and tipping her 20% because I felt bad that she was working all alone.  In conclusion... Get your ish together and work on hospitality! Also, it would be nice to scrub down the restaurant-- it was gross with flies everywhere! My advice- have more than one or two bartenders working. I don't know how this place runs with their bartenders as is. Also, management needs to step there ish up as well, be more attentive to your failing bar and poor servers.

I asked her for a table and she just said it's a 25 min wait. She didn't even ask for our names. Then my friend had a doubt and went in and she said oh I didn't know you wanted a table. And she took our names down. Fine  Then my friend asked how long for a booth and she said the same time and we said we would wait for it. She calls us in and gives us a normal table. I asked her how much longer for a booth and she literally started raising her voice giving me some explanation that this is open table so it just means someone has to get up and then we can sit and she even motioned for me to look around that it's Full? Wtf? She should know the estimated time?! Like is someone is nearing the end of the meal. There was even an empty booth right in front of us but apparently that specific server wasn't available. Moreover she was still like yelling ?  Another waiter saw her yelling at us and tried to intervene but she snapped at him saying there is no issue. He apologized to us saying he ""tried to solve the issue but she isn't listening"" the manager I assume came in and told her he will take care of us instead and she had the NERVE to tell him that we don't deserve to be seated in a booth?! How unprofessional. Other waiters offered to take care of us but she told them to stop creating a scene. Wtf.

Alyssa M.,"New York, NY",232,246,78,4.0,9/4/2012,"Red Robin has changed so much since I first started going; I love how many options they give you for toppings, sides, buns, and protein choice. Surprisingly enough, this is a perfect place for vegetarians (they have both Morningstar and Boca Vegan patties!). This location is brand new, very clean, and huuuge. Tons of seating and very open considering there are two entrances (one from the street, the other from inside the mall). Sweet, accommodating service. They also have a system where they put your phone number into an automated waiting list and text you when your table is ready. Pretty neat! Most of all I really enjoyed my meal; I ordered the Veggie--Morningstar patty with grilled zucchini, caramelized onions, tomatoes, and a balsamic cream sauce. I also asked for it bunless, instead opting for a lettuce wrap. What a great choice! They cut the lettuce so it basically forms a ginormous bun around your patty. While it's completely impossible to eat unless you have the mouth of a giant, it's easy to peel away and craft the size you like. The modification went perfect with my veggie burger as well.  I don't frequent chain restaurants often, but I definitely wouldn't mind coming here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge?start=60

Niyant S.,"Collegeville, PA",29,162,96,3.0,8/19/2012,"A group of us came to this brand new Red Robin after my fiance got an offer to go for their ""soft opening""/""training"" dinner. Basically, they offerred a free appetizer for the table and free entrees so their cooks and servers could get the opportunity to train and prepare. It was a pretty cool experience getting to go for this, plus it gives me a chance to be the first person to review them on Yelp! Upon seating, we looked around and liked the vibe in the place. Our waitress came over promptly and took our drink orders (had to pay for these, but no big deal). She did a good job with this, got a few drink descriptions mixed up, but gotta expect some sort of learning curve. Our drinks did also take a while to come out, but they were also fairly busy so we'll let it pass. At first I got the Blue Moon pumpkin (yes, they already started their Octoberfest line!), and the glass had brown sugar on the rim! The drink was great, and much needed for the end of the week. We also got one free smoothie/shake for the table, which my fiance took advantage of (got some fruity drink that I thought tasted like a mix between pepto and robitussin). We got the chips with salsa and guacamole, which was great and came out timely (the chips were even hot). For dinner, I was torn between a few different options, but ended up getting the Royal Red Robin, a burger topped with bacon, lettuce tomatoe, cheese, and a fried egg. My few critiques on this, it wasn't really medium, the bacon wasn't crispy enough, and it was lacking a sauce. The latter issue was fixed by asking for chipotle mayo, but the others I'll let slide again since they are still training (hey, it was a free meal so I can't complain much. If not, I would have made this a lot lower stars...). The fries were great though and definitely on point with their signature seasoning mix. All in all, everyone enjoyed their meal, and in the end, we were very pleased to see our $75 bill come down to almost nothing! They do have a little work to do to get up to par with other gourmet burger joints, so in the future if I have to pay for a meal here I'll expect a better burger.

My husband ordered a burger, my daughter chicken fingers, and myself a salad. Our meal literally took 1 hour after placing an order to get to our table.

My problem is with their horrible service.  The last two times I ate here I called in to order my food to go about twenty minutes before arriving to the restaurant. When I show up to pick up my burger and salad, the restaurant was completely chaotic. It took a few minutes to be acknowleged but eventually the person in charge of takeout looks at the order sitting on the counter, checks the ticket, and tells me that it isn't mine and to wait a few more minutes for my food to be ready. So I sit and wait. 20 minutes go by, meanwhile other people are picking up their orders and leaving, getting seated to eat, and having drinks while I wait for my take out that I now ordered more than 40 minutes ago...... Growing more and more impatient and hungry, I ask the waitress where my food is. She looks at the ticket of the SAME bag that has been sitting there this whole time, and says ""oh this is yours."" ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?? What the hell were you reading before when you didn't realize it was my burger 20 minutes ago?

Evan R.,"Beach Haven, NJ",0,4,,1.0,12/23/2013,"I had been introduced to Red Robin maybe 3 years ago, at the location in Clifton. Place was great and I fell in love with the Bleu Ribbon Burger.  Well, after moving back down to Central NJ, and not having my delicious love of a burger in quite some time, I was excited for the opening of the Woodbridge location. However, my excitement was met with only disappointment. Just about every time I've been there, my order has been messed up, the kitchen is out of something, or the service just downright sucks. I have two noteworthy experiences to share. I came to this location maybe 2 months ago to the day with my girlfriend and my father. After being seated, we had to wait about 20 minutes before even being asked for our drink orders. I didn't mind at first, it looked like they were understaffed, and I knew how that could be having worked in a restaurant/bar for over a year.  When our drinks came back, we attempted to order. I wanted to order their Bleu Ribbon burger, however the kitchen was out of bleu cheese. I figured, what the hell, I'll take the opportunity to try something new, so I ordered the bacon-guacomole burger instead. But, oh hey, they were out of guacomole as well. I settled for a regular bacon cheeseburger, as did my girlfriend. She specifically requested no lettuce or tomato, as she is allergic to the latter.  Well, about half an hour passes before we see our server again, drinks had been completely empty for about 10. The food comes out and lo-and-behold, there's tomatoes on her burger. She made the complaint, and the burger came back looking like things had just been scraped off.  At this point I was extremely frustrated so I confronted the manager. She was shocked and took many of the items off of our bill, as well as gave us a gift card. She was very courteous and understanding. Next More recently, this past Monday, I met a few friends here for happy hour. We sat in the bar area. No food involved this time, I was pretty distraught from my last experience. We put in our beer orders, while there were 2 other people in this area. Bartender was taking a while so I looked over to the taps, and there's our beers just sitting there. They sat there for 15 minutes. My beer tasted flat by the time it got to me, so I complained, and she went to refill it. She filled it with the wrong order. Took 3 tries to get a simple beer order correct, friends food came out cold and we were largely ignored for service. Do yourself a favor and go to a different location if you want Red Robin. I wont be returning until they restaff or make improvements. .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge?start=80

The burger was soooo greasy with maybe a teaspoon of guacamole on it and no bacon (which it is supposed to have), fries were literally cold.

V V.,"Edison, NJ",1,38,,1.0,8/31/2013,"Very disgusted with this place.  Our server did not hesitate to tell us that it was supposed to be his day off and that someone called out (as if the customer really cares that you, the worker, are inconvenienced by having to be at your job). He really seemed out of it as he took each of our orders (party of 6). Even when I ordered my mother's drink while she was away (a simple water), he gave me a hard time about getting it because he wanted to wait for her to be back for her to order the same thing. I mean really? Our waiter did not even bother to check in on us after taking our orders no less.  Not only did our appetizer come out cold (spinach & artichoke dip), but ALL of our dinner orders came out cold (burgers, sandwiches, fries, everything), with one of our orders being completely wrong. All after waiting over an hour for our food. This is unacceptable, especially since the place hardly seemed understaffed and that there weren't too many customers there to begin with.  We let our inconvenienced waiter know of this and he gave us a hard time about getting the manager, who was more interested in counting her change than helping the customers. Eventually we got our waiter to track her down, and she did apologize profusely as did the waiter, but still this level of service and incompetence is unacceptable for any establishment. Fortunately it was 'on the house', but all six of us left hungry and very dissatisfied, as none of us ate our undercooked food.  Needs a complete rehaul. Needs tougher management that know how to run a restaurant and definitely needs to retrain the waitstaff, all who seem to be a bunch of teenagers/college kids who care more about socializing with one another than to run a business.   Totally unacceptable, I will never return to this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge?start=80

Jayson G.,"Keasbey, NJ",1,8,,1.0,3/18/2013,"This place was more worse then eating out of a dumpster.the food was bland, I had the ribs and macaroni pasta. The macaroni pasta that comes with the little boney 3 pieces of ribs, was just heavy cream with a bunch of salt thrown on top, and pieces of cheddar cheese. The ribs were cat food if even. In all i think Id rather die then eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge?start=100
Dave C.,"Roselle, NJ",0,17,,1.0,12/14/2014,"I have no idea what went wrong with this place, but the past few months has been horrible.  Service is horrible, food is late if not wrong.  Drinks takes forever to be refilled.

Christopher O.,"Fords, NJ",128,75,14,3.0,9/17/2012,"First time ever eating at this chain. there is one about 10 mins from me in south plainfield, but never went. The food is pretty good.I had the burning love burger which is a burger seasoned with cayenne topped with salsa,beer battered jalepeno slices,pepperjack cheese on a jalepeno kaiser   was delicious.spicy but not overpowering  I subbed the steak fries for sweet potato fries. my only complaint was the fries was cold and soggy, they must of thrown on some leftover stuff, but I'll cut the place some slack.they just opened and are working out the kinks still.I know how it is.

Kimberly G.,"Hillside, NJ",5,66,3,5.0,2/17/2013,"I love Red Robin and was excited to visit this one since I frequent Woodbridge Mall. This restaurant did not disappoint! Our server Lisa L. was amazing. She was very friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. I had the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger which was cooked to perfection and was very flavorful. It was without a doubt one of the best burgers I've ever had, which is saying a lot since I LOVE a good cheeseburger! I will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge?start=100
Jennifer L.,"South River, NJ",4,7,,1.0,10/23/2014,"Our burgers were so burnt they were almost on the same level of a hockey puck. We both took only one bite, no one even asked us why we didn't touch our food. Mind you we were the only ones in there (can't imagine why) next time I give this place a chance I hope the cooks are trained and the people care more. Thanks again for a 61 dollar meal that I did not get anything out of. Oh and the onion rings were over done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge?start=100
Steven C.,"Asbury Park, NJ",204,56,,4.0,8/22/2012,"I came for their soft opening, having already been to another nearby Red Robin location previously in the past. Red Robin is delicious! They have a large variety of burgers, and their fries / drinks are bottomless so if you still manage to be hungry after your gigantic entree keep the refills coming! Their trademark spice container gives a good kick to your food too, I usually put it on my fries but not on the burger as much because I feel like it detracts from the true taste of the burger. Getting to their burgers, which is the main entree of Red Robin, they are absolutely delicious. Lots of varieties. You can also substitute Chicken or Turkey pattys for any of the burgers on the menu. My favorite part of the burgers is that they have less of a commercialized, chain restaurant feel (even though this is a chain restaurant) and more of a fresh off the grill taste, as if you were getting a burger at a diner or a burger joint. Instead of steak fries, you can substitute for their other sides such as mac and cheese. If you get the fries, be sure to try some of the sauces they may have in the kitchen if you are interested (I usually get a side of campfire sauce when I order fries, delicious!). Also try their freckled lemonade, its delicious and also bottomless. Or their giant tower of onion rings. It is way too early for me to review on the service of this location, mostly because it has just opened a few days ago. But based on my first experience here, I highly recommend trying it out and I will sure be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge?start=100

Stephanie M.,"New York, NY",4,160,183,3.0,3/30/2014,"Wasn't happy with this red robin, I've been to others and they were great. This place has a 30-45 min wait, but most tables are empty. When asked, they say ""the kitchen is behind so there's no point for you to sit and wait at a table"". The kitchen, with the view I had, was so dirty. Food all over the floor, hamburgers thrown around on the counter and containers. Once we sat, 40 mins later, we were able to order right away, got our drinks early and the food unexpectedly came out within 15-20 mins. Even though we were warned it would be a long time. A lot of the people that walked in, heard the wait time and left to go to Applebee's. It's within walking distance, keep in mind. Another thing I noticed was that they left the tables dirty for quite some time with so many waiting. I heard the wait staff actually laughing and say, "" well if they aren't picking the stuff up, neither am I"" and they left it. Another staff member was sweeping next to us while we were eating, I'm sure that's not allowed. And majority of the staff stands in groups chit chatting. They should probably have half of them in the kitchen to speed up the process. I give three stars because 1 it's red robin, 2 food came out faster than expected, and 3 location is good since attached to the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge?start=100
Stan V.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",3,12,,1.0,1/4/2014,"This place has the worst customer service anywhere. I placed my order, and after over 20 minutes, the food finally showed up, only my order was wrong. When the waitress asked if everything was OK, she vanished before I could turn and say no. I asked another waitress to call her for me, and after over 10 minutes, she finally showed up, went to the table next to me, and vanished again. I asked for her again, and after another 10 minutes, she showed up. I told her my order was wrong, so she took the food, and then vanished for another 20 minutes. She finally walked by and told me my meal would be out in a second. 10 minutes later I went looking for her and told her to forget the order, and that I wanted to talk to the manager. After another 10 minutes, the manager finally showed up, and was kind enough to not charge me for my meal!  WHAT MEAL? I then went to write the Red Robin customer service on the internet, and no surprise. After taking the time to fill out the form, and clicking send, the went to a strange page and froze. I tried it again with the same result.  NO MORE RED ROBIN FOR ME. It's not Red Robin, yummmm. It's more like Red Robin YUCHHH!!!!! This is the worst service I have ever had anywhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge?start=100
Julia M.,"East Brunswick, NJ",0,8,,4.0,8/13/2013,I have been to this location several times now and never had any issues mentioned below.  Yesterday I had a particularly good experience.  The staff was friendly and very helpful. I have recently developed a peanut allergy which has made eating out particularly difficult. I asked if they used peanut oil and she replied no. The girl then retrieved a special menu just for food allergies. In my limited experience with my food restrictions this was the first time anyone ever done that for me. My burger was fantastic and my boyfriend said his berserker burger one of the best he's ever had.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge?start=100
J T.,"Beachwood, NJ",2,39,,1.0,11/16/2012,"We've eaten at many Red Robins and usually they are great but the one in Woodbridge Center has some issues.  We were seated right away since there were a lot of open tables but our table was filthy.  We looked around and noticed that all the empty tables were dirty.  They came and cleaned the table when asked but don't understand why the tables aren't cleaned before they seat you.  Service was very slow and again, the place was not packed.  The children's macaroni and cheese was barely warm and I asked for fruit instead of fries but got fries.  No spoons on the table and had to chase someone down to get one.  Dishes brought for appetizers were not clean.  The burgers were very rare even though we asked for ""a little pink"" and the plates sat under the warming lights for a very long time before they were brought to the table.  The fruit salad was horrible-those frozen mushy strawberries in a very sugary sauce with some tiny apple chunks.  For desert, we wanted the apple cake, but they were out of apples.  The only bright side to the meal was the humus platter which was very good.   Red Robin has a great menu and they really need to clean up better and pay more attention to service if they want people to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodbridge?start=100

Shauna D.,"Clark, NJ",8,16,,1.0,3/19/2013,Went there Sunday.  Was less then impressed with it.  The waitress was terrible!!!   They drop the food at the table.. 2 burgers and fries.. when I went to reach over for the ketchup there was none.. So I wait for our waitress to come back.. 10 mins later she came back ask it everything was okay... I said I'd like ketchup for there was none.. and we'd like a choc milkshake as well.. Well she went to the computer I'm guessing to add the milk shake to the order.. and then left.. never came back with ketchup....  So then a while later she came back with the shake .. and I said again could I have ketchup.. and she said she had forgotten.. and got me some.. by then my fries and burger were cold..  I was by the door and I could see what looked like to be the manager bsing at the door with staff..  5 or 6 of them there hanging out!!  I would never go back there again!!
