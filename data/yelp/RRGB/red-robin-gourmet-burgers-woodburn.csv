Matt S.,"Salem, OR",60,12,,5.0,1/2/2018,"Red Robin is a good place if you haven't had it in awhile. The best thing so far I had was the wegie burger and the bottomless salad.

Traycie S.,"Honolulu, HI",18,19,66,1.0,9/13/2017,"This was probably my worst experience.  Let's start of with how long it actually took them to take our order.  My order was a boca burger with grilled onions, mushrooms and provolone cheese on. Jalapeño bun.  What I got was a turkey burger on a sesame seed bun with pickles and raw onions.  Oh yeah I ordered garlic fries and got steak wedge fries.  Can you say total mess up?   Now the catcher is the ""manager"" was the one that took our order.  Maybe my order was a bit complicated??   After he took my plate away and insist that it was a Boca burger he return and asked if everyone's order was ok.  There's was ok.   Now I understand the low rating for this place.  Total chaos and lack of customer service.  I believe this is my very first 1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn
Dan Z.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",1,33,,2.0,8/4/2017,One of the smallest Red robins I have been too. Service was okay.  restaurant was very dirty. They don't keep the floors up as the day progresses. Dirty tables are not cleared right away. Give a little eye sore to those waiting for food. Food was pretty poor compared to other red robins. I would avoid this place until its improved.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn
Swepna M.,"Portland, OR",51,59,111,1.0,7/31/2017,"This is is our second visit to red robin during our woodburn outlet mall visit for lunch. We had very good experience the first time, hence decided to come here again. However, we regretted our decision as food was really pathetic,  Ordered dishes: Southwest sombrero - salad was totally filled up with lettuce with hardly any fried jalepanos, avocados and other veggies that usually come with and not so nice dressing. Had good taste the first time around but this time felt total waste. wouldn't recommend this at all. Garden burger with garlic herbed bottomless fries - pathetic, burger came out really cold and tasted very soggy. Totally felt not worth getting it. first serving fries was crispy and hot while next serving was soggy and cold.  Bruschetta chicken with bottomless fries - decent burger with similar experience on fries.  Sear-ious salmon - decent. coleslaw salad was good. Overall, worst ever experience in this restaurant, never come again and won't recommend to others.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn
Sarah S.,"Gresham, OR",0,26,,1.0,11/22/2017,Not sure why I even gave it one star. Very dirty. BLTA was awful! That's my favorite meal there. Bottomless fries weren't that great either.

Tom W.,"Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",17,249,307,4.0,12/15/2016,"Maybe it was the all day travel, maybe it was the warmth on a cold damp day, but I thoroughly enjoyed the soup and burger today. The tortilla soup was full of flavor and hot! The burger was well cooked and fires with their special seasonings with the smokey BBQ sauce. My server suggested it and i also recommend it.  My server was very attentive and helpful with suggestions.  This experience renewed my faith in Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn
Jacqui A.,"Anaheim, CA",206,47,10,5.0,10/1/2017,What can be said about Red Robin? It's been a favorite since childhood. We still eat here about 1x month and I still get my favorite Grilled Cheese with avocado. This is my comfort food heaven. Love my classic FRENCH fries with seasoning and love my sweet potato fries.

Raedetta C.,"Clatskanie, OR",2,12,4,1.0,5/20/2017,"Walked in to a crowded lobby, which is often typical for Red Robin. We checked in with the hostess and asked to sit in the bar, to which she replied that all the tables were on the waitlist and we'd have to get on the list. We put our names on the list and was told a 10-15 minute wait, which wasn't bad considering it was just about 5:15 pm on a Saturday. The hostess (no name tag, big hair) actually appeared annoyed that people were coming in.  We actually waited over 20 minutes to be seated and during that time we counted at least 4 two-tops, 2 four-tops, and a six-top open.   We were seated at a two-top that had been open the entire time we were waiting. The served did come over promptly and get our drink order. When drinks were delivered we ordered our appetizer at the same time as our meals.   The server put the app order in the table tablet (That wasn't at the table) and wrote down our orders.  Our appetizer just arrived and it was missing the sauce and we finally got appetizer plates after they were taken to another table that already had some. Our orders came out, the other person was missing the dipping sauce and had a full bun when she asked for half.  The food was typical for Red Robin.  When it came time to pay, even though we could have split the check, the server split it for us on the machine, which we had to redo so we could enter a rewards number.  When it was time for the second person to pay, we had to call the server  (actually flag him down) to get some help so we could enter a different rewards number. He went in the back to reset it, but we still couldn't pay and had to wave him down again to ask him to take cash.  Hands down the worst Red Robin experience both of us have ever had and we are avid Red Robin fans.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn
Sarah R.,"Portland, OR",196,26,23,3.0,8/22/2017,"I would rate my service 3 stars because the manager at this location honestly knows how to be a good manager and try and solve the problem with a smile on his face and great customer service!!! Now for the other part of my visit I would only give one stars too.. we arrived at 5:50pm on a Tuesday, I checked the clock as we sat down. We waited... and waited around 6:18pm we were finally greeted. By this time we obviously knew exactly what we wanted. We ordered two burgers and two appetizers and two waters. About 15 minutes after ordering we received burnt appetizers and literally no drinks yet. We found this very odd but we were very thirsty. After 40 minutes waiting we got our food finally but still no water! We asked three different waitresses in that time to also get us water which they agreed to do but never returned. The hostess and the manager were the best things... we had to go find the manager to explain what's has been going on and to finally get something to drink! He took very good care of us after the visit that would be the only reason I would return!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn
Shannon H.,"Seaside, OR",29,35,9,1.0,9/11/2016,"We used to be so excited about this place opening much closer to us now we are regularly disappointed. Since they have opened we have always used the to-go service and every time something has been wrong. Granted we have used this a total of 4 times now but this was the straw that broke the camels back. After getting home (approximately 10 mins away) I went to get things out so we could eat as a family, low and behold we were missing an entire order, not like an appetizer, salad, or side which has happened previously. No, this time a whole order (kids Mac n cheese with carrots). So I called about this as it was now after 11 and that is about when they close. They ever so graciously offering to mail a gift card as a resolution to this issue. I began to explain how this has always happened and now my child shouldn't eat?!  Needless to say I spent 20 mins round trip a second time to pick up Mac n cheese, I was given 2 free appetizer coupons which can ONLY be used at this terrible Woodburn location and ate cold food because of this issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn
Jaime C.,"Diamond Bar, CA",0,1,,1.0,7/6/2017,"Let me start by saying we did not get a chance to walk in the door, the hostess told us there was a 2 hour wait for a party of 15, ridiculous.  There were 6 people in the lobby waiting.  No greeting, just rudeness.  We turned around and walked into Elmer's and what a world of difference.  The management at Red Robbin should walk over to Elmer's and take a few lessons in customer satisfaction from the Elmer's staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn
Jason M.,"Happy Valley, OR",47,2,,1.0,4/26/2017,"Let me be clear to start. I love Red Robin Burgers. But I literally just walked out of this Red Robin right after being seated because of the absolute rudeness of the hostess. We asked if there was open seating in the Bar and we were told she has to seat us and if a high top was ok. We said yes and when we got to the bar all the seating available was in the center of the room and quite crowded, we noticed there were two booths in the bar area against the back bar wall and asked if we could sit there. Her response was ""I guess, but I'd prefer you sit at a table to keep the servers area tight"". Uh what? I'm not sure, A) why you would convey this to a customer, making them feel uncomfortable for asking for a booth, B) complain about seating a customer literally 3 feet away from the original table and C) trying to force customers into a crowded area that would add to server congestion.  The hostess, after seating us, then proceeds to walk over to the bartender less the 2 feet from us and complain about us asking to sit in the booth. To the bartenders credit he didn't seem to understand what the big deal was, but she continued for a good minute to rant on about us, right in front of us.  That's when we made the decision to leave.  I will enjoy Red Robin Burgers in the future, just never again at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn
Andy C.,"Newark, CA",83,15,11,1.0,6/19/2017,"Came here for lunch with my kids for a party of 5 on a Monday.  The place is nearly empty with plenty of tables for 4 but the hostess made us wait 30 minutes for a table.  We left because the host did not offer any solution even when we were discussing about leaving.  Instead he just let us leave the restaurant.   Then we went over to Elmer's and be seated almost immediately, even the restaurant is nearly full.  Red Robin need to learn customers service and train their hostesses and server to better assist their hungry customers.  I am sure I am not the only person who feel this way because ALL Red Robins are almost the same.  I will not return until they improve on seating their guest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn

Loretta F.,"Eugene, OR",35,95,34,3.0,4/2/2016,"We made a lunch stop today at Red Robin before our shopping trip at the outlet. It is definitely smaller than most of the other Red Robins I have been in, but we were very impressed by the newer and trendier interior design.  One of the best things about being over 21 is that you get to sit at the bar area (whether you choose to drink or not) - which is always less busy than the general area. We ordered beer and limeade, then our burgers. I have always ordered bunless as a lighter option, lettuce wrap bunless burger is just as good as any other burger!  I only said ""bunless"" Banzai burger - which was a terrible mistake. My burger came in with no buns, and no lettuce wrap either... That never happened before. I regret not  telling our server that I really meant I wanted lettuce wrap, but was too embarrassed to do so, thinking it could be something new. I enjoyed our food regardless, and service was so-so, I won't say I am impressed enough to come back again, but it's not a bad option if you just need to grab a bite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn

Dani - another server in the bar area, just stood there for ten minutes talking to her friend sitting at the bar. She was talking for ten minutes, totally ignoring all her guests!

Tom R.,"Littleton, CO",0,3,1,1.0,7/5/2017,"Worst service ever I travel a lot and I also have a Red Robin near my house in Colorado that has excellent service This location in woodburn Oregon is terrible I ate at the bar because there was a long wait for a table in the dining room I had to ask for service the whole way through my experience there . I sat at the bar and there was only 1 other person sitting at the bar. I sit there for 5 minutes and realized the waitress/barmaid wasn't coming over so I finally asked her for a rag to clean the counter (it was filthy), she leaned over and cleaned the counter...sort of  As she was cleaning I asked for a drink After the drink came I sit there at least another 5 minutes until I finally got her attention to ask for a menu. This is the best part... after I closed the menu , it's obvious I'm ready to order, she's talking to someone it appears she knows and completely ignores me. After 12 minuets and I'm not exaggerating another waitress was making drinks in front of where I was sitting so I asked her for a salad. Only once during the meal did the second waitress ever come over to ask how I was. I paid the bill and asked for the manger on my way out, I told him the whole story and all he could say was , who and oh I'm sorry Don't go to this location!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn?start=20

Kelsey M.,"Beaverton, OR",0,14,,2.0,5/14/2017,"Normally visiting a Red Robin is a pretty enjoyable experience. No, the food isn't stellar, but it's good and reasonably priced. This is the third time visiting this particular location and by far my worse experience at any of their locations ever. We were five people seated at a four top, but we made it work. We weren't given enough silverware or napkins, even after asking. Thankfully we had food we could eat with our hands. We had an AWFUL waitress, Meg? May? Something like that. I'm not sure because she only mumbled it once and didn't have a name tag on. Anyway, she was CLEARLY uninterested in serving anyone and did not seem to give two shits about her job. When taking our drink orders she didn't ask if we wanted appetizers or if we were ready to order food. We tried to tell her we wanted an appetizer but she simply walked away after the last drink order. When she came back with the drinks we mentioned wanting onion rings. She ROLLED HER EYES and said, ""Well do it on that."" and pointed to the little tabletop tablet thing. At first, we didn't hear her clearly so we asked ""what?"" to try and clarify. She once again rolled her eye and audibly sighed. She the picked up the tablet thingy and placed the onion ring order for us, then slammed the tablet back down, walking away without saying anything else. When the onion rings came out we were not given plates, so we sort of made makeshift plates on our napkins. Yes, we asked for them, twice, but never got them. When she returned to take our orders, she didn't ask if we wanted any dipping sauces for our fries (sort of a staple of RR), nor offered to bring refills on drinks until we asked. Also, not a huge deal, but I've noticed at every other RR I've been to they offer to bring fries out early (if you've ordered something with the bottomless fries), but of course she didn't. We were too scared to ask. Our food finally came out, delivered by two different waiters. It was fine, but not great. My fish and chips were soggy and greasy, my brother's burger was over cooked and dry, and my dad's plate had about 4 French fries. Whatever, we moved on. When a third waiter stopped to ask if we needed anything I requested ranch for my fries, since we didn't get any offered before. He brought that pretty promptly. About 1/3 of the way through our meal Happy May/Meg returned and said, ""I'm going on break. I can either cash you out now or hand you to another server."" We opted to cash out and asked her to split the bill. She once again huffed through that process on the tabletop tablet (which we could have done ourselves when we were ready to pay at the end of our meal but she was determined to have us do it right then). All in all, it was an underwhelming experience thanks to the waitstaff. Probably will avoid this location again due to that.

Food took forever and couldn't really go anywhere else due to my sister's dietary needs. Otherwise I would have left- it was that bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn?start=40
Elizabeth C.,"Chicago, IL",50,26,4,3.0,10/22/2015,"Red Robin Woodburn doesn't seem to be up to their normal quality. It might be because they are new but there is no wifi (and I think it's because they are trying to sell you video games on their computers at the tables) also no happy hour specials and service is slow. My husband likes to go out to watch the game and I usually bring my iPad to watch shows or play, but not at red robin...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn?start=40
Brian F.,"Sherwood, OR",122,113,161,2.0,9/19/2015,"Got there and had 30 min wait which was fine for a party of 8.  After we were seated got good intro service.  I had family visiting from Australia so thought this would be a good place to visit.  They served 2 of us 10 min before our guests got served so me and my wife waited for them to get there food.  By that time my burger was cold.  Ask for fries several times and it took 5-10 min to get them, endless fries should be a pretty fast thing to refill.  At the end my guests wanted 1 more things of fries waitress told us 1.5 min and they will be out 10 min later we left with no fries for them..  Disappointing experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn?start=40
Nikee W.,"Woodburn, OR",62,346,57,4.0,10/3/2015,"As locals, we are so excited to have another kid friendly dining option nearby! Red Robin is one of the few places that has healthy kid menu options like grilled chicken, steamed broccoli and fresh fruit. They also have salads and burgers and everything in between so generally the whole family is happy when we come here.  Since it's opened, we have been here twice. The first time we went in for the soft opening with our toddler and had a great meal. Our waitress was awesome, the food and drinks were perfect and we had a great time. I would give it 5 stars if not for the super confused and slightly rude hostess we encountered when we first came in. Our second visit was very much the same. We came in on a busy Saturday, crazy we know but that's what everyone wanted. We were told it was a 35 minute wait, I said ok! The hostess looked at me for a few seconds then asked, so do you still want to eat here? I was a little surprised, and said yes of course! That's why I am here! She put our name down, then told me it would be 25 minutes. I sat down ready to wait 35 minutes when I got a text telling me our table was ready! It had only been a few minutes so I went up thinking it may have been an error. The hostess ignored me but a waitress explained that our table was being cleaned. In another minute we were seated! The place was packed but we got our food quickly and even my sister in laws complex special request instructions were followed to a T! I hope they keep being awesome, so we can keep feeling awesome about giving them our business!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn?start=40
Tabetha B.,"Mill City, OR",31,5,,1.0,7/17/2016,"We waited 35 minutes to be seat. We expected this on a busy Saturday night. We were seated on the tables with the bench on one side and chairs on the other. However, when I asked for the open booth that was actively being cleaned off, due to my son with Autism trying to run away multiple times, I was told that wasn't my table and we would have to go back on the list in order to get a booth. You wouldn't deny a person in a wheelchair an open spot, as you shouldn't reasonably accommodate our request to keep our son safe. Come on, we just wanted to move over so that we were able to focus on dinner. I'm disappointed in the lack of compassion and rudeness from this lady. It's hard enough raising a special needs child. I just wanted to enjoy my meal out with my family which is a rarity for special needs families. We left. It's very difficult to chase a child who doesn't understand he can't run out the door and eat dinner. I will encourage my special needs families and all others to avoid this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn?start=40
Tom L.,"Woodburn, OR",0,28,2,4.0,10/8/2015,"Sat in the bar area on all 3 visits so far, very busy most times, staff was attentive and helpful.  Woodburn lacks diversity in sit-down dining options, so this was sorely needed.  Standard RR food menu, good happy hour choices.  Nice shiny new decor with old (beloved) RR iconic touches.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn?start=40
Dana S.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,11,3,2.0,6/22/2016,"Very disappointed at this location. Server was great, food was good, but restaurant had excessive flies. I'm talking 4 to 5 flying around our booth located just outside kitchen. They need to close for a day for deep cleaning and a pest specialist. Flies are symptomatic of a much larger problem than being just being annoying. They can cause food bourne illness if they carry pathogens on their bodies that transfer to food they land on. Cleanliness and proper air flow can combat this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn?start=40
Tracey L.,"Gervais, OR",20,41,3,4.0,9/15/2015,"Waiters were polite, service was quick, food was decent. I probably wouldn't order the seafood platter again as I found it a little too salty and the pumpkin shake was a little gritty, but I enjoyed my fries and peppercorn burger. The berry limeade and freckled lemonade were delicious and the Fruffles were pretty good. Maybe a little heavy on the sea salt. I'd come here again though since Woodburn doesn't really have any other decent restaurant to compare to. Good location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn?start=40
Jordan D.,"Fremont, CA",13,147,36,4.0,9/14/2015,"Never been to a Red Robin before, we spent few hours at the Outlet mall next to it and when we were gone it was close to 8PM, there isn't much close by so we went into this one. We sat down and waitress told us they just open today, they didn't even have any signs outside! Anyways, our waitress Britney was very nice, few details on the menu she didn't know and she got the answers right away. We got Royal and Banzai, burgers came pretty quick, a little disappointing on the size of the burger, it's best if you order appetizers. Another issue I saw was the restroom, super tiny with only 2 toilets, one standing and one sitting, this might be barely enough for building code but for a big restaurant like this they should have at least 2 standing, they had a big closet, management I'm gonna say you need to replace it with a standing stall. Overall good experience, cream soda sucks, their happy hour all day beer is not bad, 22 oz for $4.50 all day(domestic), will probably visit again next time we stop by this outlet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn?start=40

K W.,"St Paul, OR",0,22,,3.0,9/11/2015,"I and my wife were invited to the pre-opening practice run.  We went for lunch on the very first practice day.  The place was busy, and everything seemed to be running smoothly.  Service was friendly and great.  Food was well prepared, served quickly, and tasted good. We were seated in the bar area on stools at one of the tiny high tables  Very noisy in there due to the small space and proximity to the kitchen.  Virtually impossible to carry on any conversation.  Even the wait staff had to raise their voices to be understood.  Definitely not the place to enjoy a meal due to the noise, and constant foot traffic by our table.  I and my wife were getting bumped by everyone going by. Still way better than the Red Robin in Salem over by Lancaster Mall.  Lousy food and service at that one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn?start=40

Chris C.,"Scappoose, OR",0,34,16,1.0,12/17/2015,"It pains me to write this review as my family and I love Red Robin however my attempt at addressing our recent experience has been less then desirable. Our waitress handed all the drinks and food to one of us at the table and had him hand out the food and drinks. Then when she began cleaning the table she spilled the plates and cups on one of our kids. Not one apology. And worse of all she tried to act like it didn't happen. It wasn't till I asked for a manager that she informed her supervisor. Then the manager comes out and still no apology. All she cared about was a lawsuit and asked our kid if he was going to be a ""tough guy"" and hoping he doesn't go to the hospital. So I wrote a letter to the corporate office where all I got was a simple ""where sorry and hope you come back"" response. We won't be coming back to the one in woodburn! I waited a few weeks to see if they would address my concerns before I wrote this review. Very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodburn?start=40
