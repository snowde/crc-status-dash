Paul F.,"Redmond, WA",54,3,1,4.0,1/3/2018,"Tonight I took my kids to the Red Robin in Woodinville.  We frequent other Red Robin restaurants.  My son is a lover of fries and most of the time it's a challenge to get even two baskets during a meal. The Woodinville Red Robin has been consistently good at keeping him topped off with fries.  While the burgers are pretty great, I typically order the grilled chicken salad.  The chicken is always tender and everything is fresh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville
Michelle B.,"Enumclaw, WA",14,113,231,1.0,11/6/2017,"Not a great experience last night at the Woodinville Red Robin.  We arrived and went into the bar.  It was busy but there were a few open seats here and there.  We didn't order anything elaborate or crazy.  2 waters,  a cup of french onion soup and a BLTA Croissant.  Not sure what happened but the three different parties that came in after us all got served their food before us.  We had ordered at about 612 pm and decided to leave 35 minutes later after the 3rd party got their food delivered and we still didn't have ours. Our water got refilled but never saw our food.   I think the bartender meant well,  especially when he dropped off a basket of fries to the 2nd party who arrived and ordered after us. He dropped the basket and said something to the effect,  ""Here's some  fries while you wait for your order.""  Oh, I almost forgot...  the couple who sat there prior to this 2nd couple had to point out to the bartender that we were waiting to be acknowledged  and wanted to order.  The bartender cane over and took our order. That couple left, the table got cleaned and the 2nd party came in and sat down.   It appears our order got lost and the bartender didn't even realize it because there was never any apology, obligatory basket of fries or explanation as to why it was taking so long. I don't mind the wait if it's busy and we all are waiting,  but when the 3rd party after us gets their food before us there is clearly an issue.  Oh, and the BLTA I ordered was given to one of the other three parties. Bummer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville
Jimmy B.,"Bellevue, WA",19,312,125,1.0,11/5/2017,"11/5.  New Update... After watching three other tables get served food that were seated after us AFTER we placed our order, WE WALKED OUT.    I won't be back.    Update:   Better service, probably due to a very attentive bartender.  Food was just ""okay"" again, with fries being undercooked.     I had stopped going to Red Robin for a months because of poor overall experience at many locations, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOUTH CENTER (awesome through and through).   Not sure why, but the new lie seems to be the norm.    I did receive a request from customer service on my last review here requesting my contact info to ""discuss my experience"" but never heard back.  I guess I'll just write off all the locations except South Center, and treat Red Robin as a single location restaurant.   Oh well",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville
Michael W.,"Lake Stevens, WA",81,32,57,4.0,7/9/2017,First impression  is everything.  On my entrance  I was not greeted. There were also other people standing  around basically  waiting  for some one to say hi and find some seats for them.    I chose the bar. Little did I know this would make up 10 fold for the distasteful  1st impression. The staff was fast and respectful. The young lady serving my table was fast on the drink refills  and very on point when it came for check out.    The food was nothing  extraordinary  it was what you expect  from red robin. It was good and filling. Price is a bit high for what you get but not a deal breaker. The quality  I like the most here was the service.  Hands down good.  Would I recommend  eating  here? Yes.

David A.,"Lynnwood, WA",48,22,6,4.0,12/4/2017,Just as you would expect from a Red Robin. We didn't have to wait long at all and the staff was very nice.

Charles M.,"Renton, WA",0,70,162,2.0,6/1/2017,"Had never been to this location. Came in on Thursday for dinner about 6pm. It was kind of busy so we had to wait about 10 minutes to get a booth.   Took some time for our server.  Ordered fish and chips with garlic fries and side of chipolte sauce for the wife and i got Royal Red Robin burger with regular fries. Still put off by fact the chain raised the wedge salad from 3 bucks to five so we decided to forgo it this time.   Seemed to take forever to get our food...over 30 mins.  People who were seated after us and ordered later git their food before we did. Food was ok but server forgot the chilpolte sauce for my wife......7 minutes later he brings it.  I had to ask for refill even though our server walked by several times and looked at our table. So he comes back with garlic fries for my wife after 10 minutes.....and says to me the regular fries are coning.  I had to wait 25 minutes for regular fries and server only brohht them after he wqlked by a 5th time and saw my angry look. WTF? If you have garlic fries why wouldn't you have regular fores that take less time to make?  The manager was walking around like a chicken with his head cut off. He saw me looking angry but didnt come over. Instead he calls the server to the drink station and talks to him.....shortly after my fries showed up but half the serving size my wife received. They were broken pieces and hard....like what was left over but given to put something in front of me so as not to complain.  Wife wanted to get another refill as did I, but I didn't want to wait anotjer 25 minutes  Quality of food makes a rating of 2 otherwise service would have only gotten 1.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville
Kristin W.,"Kirkland, WA",97,947,185,4.0,3/21/2017,"You know, I've been here a few times (well, maybe different locations), and I don't remember much of the food. However, I came for dinner on my husband's birthday with him and my one-year old daughter. It's a great place if you have kids cause it's so loud, you don't feel bad if your kid is screaming, LOL. The wait was about 15 minutes or so on Thursday evening.  My husband and I shared the chicken wings and a Big Tavern Burger. The chicken wings were decent sized (sometimes meat on wings is skimpy, but not here). The flavor was amazing. We got the buffalo sauce I believe and there were cheese crumbles as well. Very satisfying. The Big Tavern Burger sauce was so good! I was supposed to share it w/the hubby, uhhh, but I didn't LOL. Whoopsie! I mopped that right up. I don't like big fries, but they're good for my daughter and she seemed to enjoy them.  Service was great. Things came out quickly despite them being so busy. Our server was friendly, efficient and gave good suggestions. I would definitely return if the wait isn't too long.

Holly T.,"Seattle, WA",146,144,17,5.0,3/7/2017,"Had a great experience here with my friend!  We came during dinner hour on a Thursday and sat in the bar area. When we asked for some a basket of fries to snack on before our food came.  They actually brought us out two individual little baskets for each of us, and with a good amount of fries!  The last few times I've been to a Red Robin, the fries never make it out before the meal &/or they only give you a handful. We both got burgers and they were delicious, our server was great, and the little screen payment method made it quick and easy!  We really enjoyed our time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville
Rebecca I.,"Swedesboro, NJ",8,152,115,2.0,7/2/2017,"Eh. So-so. I've visited 4 or 5 different Red Robin's and this was my least favorite. Interior isn't kept up. Our chairs had holes in the upholstery and were pretty uncomfortable. We were seated at a table with too few chairs for members in our party, and we had to fetch chairs on our own. Our table was *way* too small for the 7 of us, and there were a lot of empty tables to spare. We were sat with 3 menus to share among 7 of us. We had to wait at least 10 minutes for a server to show up, just to place a drink order. The restaurant wasn't very busy, so these are all odd things to happen in a lull. Our server was peppy and quick with drink refills once we got going. We had some dirty silverware at the table, and we had to track someone down to get a spoon. My food was VERY so-so. It looked okay, but the fries were served cold and the bread on my sandwich was really hard. Nobody was super impressed.

Mandy G.,"Lynnwood, WA",11,93,77,4.0,11/13/2016,"This is one of the better Red Robin locations in my opinion. My party of three went there for lunch last week and our server Alan was excellent! He was personable and friendly, and also worked hard to make sure we were happy. He brought two rounds of fries to the table without us asking before our food came and after our food arrived, he still came by many times to fill up on water and fries.

Ben K.,"Snohomish, WA",0,1,,1.0,11/26/2017,I've been here three times in the last 6 months at different times of the day and each time it is at least a 20 minute wait to be seated.  I would understand if the dining area is full but each time it's only half full.  I think this Woodinville location needs to hire more people.  Also I would rather sit at a table and wait longer for service than stand in an small overcrowded waiting room.  This long wait has irritated me and given me enough time to write this review.  I suggest going to other locations.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville
Darin B.,"Bellevue, WA",68,260,12,3.0,5/7/2017,"Went to this one for a special occasion - 8 of us in all.  It was busy and we didn't mind the 30 minute wait.  Orders were taken quickly and everything seemed great, but... Our orders arrived mostly.  The burgers and salads did anyway - anything fried didn't.  And our appetizers showed up after our entrees.  And then came the fries - when most were done or nearing done. The server blamed the kitchen - of course.   So here is my math to arrive at 3 (generous) stars today... 1 star for the expediter in the kitchen who needs to manage the kitchen to get out apps, then full entrees - in that order.  This is not new and the kitchen, servers and me expect it. 2 stars for the server who should have done less blaming and more managing the backward operation.  And if you're not gong to manage it, then expect to comp something or get a less-than-great tip.  Today, you got the latter - but then, you earned it and now you know how to earn a bigger tip (and more stars) next time. 4 stars for the food.  It's Red Robin and the food is just good.

Jennifer K.,"Bothell, WA",52,58,44,3.0,8/20/2017,"We have been coming to this location for 6 years. It has always been hit or miss. You either get a 5* experience or a 1* experience, hence the 3* rating. I think the food is ok, but my kids love this place and will both sit there with perfect behavior and eat every bite so I will keep coming back. Tonight, they ""ran out of ice"" which is why we couldn't get drink refills...this was resolved at the end of our meal but everyone was quite thirsty given the salty food and 80+ degree temp. If you plan to frequent RR you should sign up for the loyalty program, it is something like buy 10 burgers get 1 free. With the typical wait to be seated, I finally read their sign with the origin story and had no idea RR was founded in Seattle in the U dist originally as Sam's Red Robin (named after some college quartet), which I thought was interesting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville
Alex G.,"Redmond, WA",105,76,8,4.0,5/27/2016,"Definitely my favorite Red Robin in the area. We tend to end up here around 8pm on weekdays and just roll into the bar. Tables are always clean, and the staff acknowledges you super quickly. Shoutout to Chris in the bar for being an awesome, attentive server and for being hilarious. They have Angry Orchard on draft, which is awesome because I can get a giant one to wash down my clucks and fries with (yup, still ordering the same thing since I was 12). Husband's margaritas were strong and still tasty. Our food came out quickly, was hot, and had a good amount of fries to go with. This pretty much covers everything you want/need out of a Red Robin.

Erik P.,"Shoreline, WA",21,171,186,2.0,4/17/2016,I find it harder and harder to find a good red robin. Service was slow and we where ignored most of the time. Had to call a server for refills. You son liked the cluks and fries so they get a star for that I ordered the pick 2 sampler with cheese sticks and mushrooms. The cheese sticks where luke warm and the mushrooms where soggy. I also ordered the tavern fries. I can't say if they where bad or good as I never got them and had to have them removed from the bill.

Danica O.,"Lynnwood, WA",26,53,3,2.0,3/7/2017,"I went here for lunch with my friend for her birthday burger last week. Our server was friendly but forgot to refill my friends root beer float. We asked her many times. Why is it refillable for $5 but you only get one?  They did not sing to my friend for her birthday.  I had to wait 20 minutes to get a refill on my coke but by then we were leaving.  The food was great, I got the teriyaki chicken burger and it was so moist!  The main thing I'm upset about is what they didn't do. We shouldn't have to ask more than twice for a beverage refill.  And I thought this was just a one time thing but a month ago I came here with friends and we sat in the bar. My tennis shoes slid under the table with all the grease!! It sickened me to know I was eating in a food establishment that doesn't mop their floors!! The same thing happened, across the restaurant - I'm beyond disgusted and won't be returning.

The lettuce wrapped burger simply had one ice berg leaf on the top and one on the bottom.  Looked really bad.  Second burger had a hair in it.  The waiter forgot our sweet potato fries.  Then later forgot to refill them.  Charged us for five burgers, so even with the comp'd burger (because of the hair) we were overcharged.  Had to wait over 15 minutes to get that straightened out.

Wendy W.,"Woodinville, WA",238,243,230,2.0,7/13/2016,Parking is great.  food is okay but not great. Menu is extensive with options of hamburgers it gets a little overwhelming.  Bottomless fries is always awesome.  Price is great.  SERVICE SUCKS!!! Staff at this location is not the most helpful. You ask to sit in a certain empty booth and they say no. Its silly. If you are coming with a fussy baby you want to sit as far away from other guests so you don't disturb them.  Next visit again there is practically an empty restaurant but the hostess wants to seat us at the booth directly next to an occupied booth. Its like getting on an empty airplane and the flight attendant demanding you sit in the middle seat between 2 people when the rest of the plane is empty. Really where is the common sense. Management is not focusing on customer service here.  Another time the hostess did not greet us. We did not seat ourselves so we waited patiently not saying anything to see if she would acknowledge us. It got to the point it was a joke between my husband and a game to see how long she would ignore us and keep walking by before saying hello or realizing we wanted a seat. She saw us walk in. She looked up from her booth. She grabbed menus and arranged them in the stack. She walked past my husband and I 4 times as we stood in the lobby. It was not until she walked past us again to wipe down windows with windex that my husband finally spoke up. 14 minutes. She tried to seat us in the bar and we said we don't feel comfortable there we don't drink and she rolled her eyes as she led us to a table in the restaurant.  Only reason we did not leave was it was the only place still open with hamburgers after 9pm. And we were killing time before going to the movies.  Customer service is horrible but the food is fairly inexpensive and they are open late so that is the only reason why we go. We will consciously make an effort to never return and instead use that Hawaiian themed burger joint in town but they close at 9:30.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=20

When the waiter left and I turned around to look at her, she immediately went to the table behind us and asked how they were doing. She did not once come over to our table to see if everything was okay after that, and pretty much wrote us off.

This particular Red Robin matches the level of quality in food, decor, service, and cleanliness of nearly every other Red Robin I've ever been to in the past 20+ years. What I particularly like about this location is the bar area. By no means the largest or fanciest Red Robin bar I've ever been in, it does the requisite job of filtering out the kids.

Knoreen B.,"Woodinville, WA",55,16,7,1.0,12/5/2015,"First of all I have been to this location literally a hundred times. We always find it a fun and family friendly place... That is until tonight. We went to my friends daughters jr. High play and as a group of seven decided to grab a bite to eat after. We had four adults and three kids. We put our name in at the front and asked how long the wait was. We were told ten to fifteen min, okay no problem. We waited about ten min and then I asked the host if it would be faster if we separated into two different groups. He told me yes they could seat us faster that way and took us back to two open booths. The kids (13,12, and 7) at one table and the adults at another.   After waiting a few minutes the host then came back and informed us he was going to grab our drink order because our server was busy, we were more than okay with that.  He then returned about ten min later without our drinks and said our server was still too busy to see us so he was also going to take our food orders, okay still totally cool with us. At this point we had already been at the restaurant about 45min and we're getting hungry. We asked if the host could grab us some frys to tide us over till our food was ready, he said no prob... We finally got our drinks and then everyone disappeared. We spotted the host off in the back with his shirt untucked so I can only assume at that point he must have ended his shift. We were left with no frys, no food and no server... We waited for probably another fifteen minutes with no word from anyone when I decided to ask to speak with a manager.  At this point the manager came up and copped a huge attitude with me. When I told him we had no server he told me they were busy and should have just left our party in the waiting area... I took that as extremely rude and unnecessary especially because we were being very understanding and at no point ever demanded to be sat! He was defensive and very pissy. I have worked in a number of restaurants in my day and I can tell you that is not the kind of attitude I expect in a manager. Especially when I was not rude or demanding in the slightest bit.   After our conversation the manager brought some frys to our table and must have told a server to come see us because then she showed up.

Erica P.,"Seattle, WA",88,184,994,3.0,1/19/2015,"Red Robin is a place we frequent because we have young kids & because my husband has fond memories of going there as a kid himself. This location is such a hit and miss in regards to service. The last time we stopped in, we were very well taken care of by Chris, but on the two previous visits were largely ignored by the servers.  The food is pretty standard. The kids menu features the usual suspects of burgers, nuggets, and bottomless mac & cheese of the Kraft variety, which my kids love.  The adult menu has a good selection of burgers & sandwiches. I had a side of mac & cheese and was not impressed with what appeared to be buttered noodles mixed with cheddar cheese. The kid's mac was much better than the grown up version. It's a noisy family spot, so definitely don't plan on any long drawn out conversations.

Kelly P.,"Kirkland, WA",70,12,,1.0,10/11/2015,"This used to be a fun place for our family to come, but it has changed, and not in a good way.  This was our go-to place to take the kids for a fun treat. They would beg to go. We were fine with that since we could grab a beer and alter the food to fit our preferences. The serving staff was typically attentive and gracious, and would engage with the boys. The server we had yesterday was lovely and did nothing that contributed to our poor experience. She was great. It was the overall atmosphere that really sealed the determination that we will not be back.  Three of our four orders came to us wrong. My older son noticed that his chicken strips were smaller than they used to be and there were only 2 rather than the 3 pictured in his menu. My younger son ordered a corn dog, as he always does; rather than 1 regular sized corn dog, he got a number of what seemed to be Vienna sausages dipped in corn batter, eww! My husband ordered the royal red robin burger with an extra patty, extra pickles, and no bun; the egg looked scorched and there were hardly any pickles. I ordered my guacamole bacon burger lettuce wrapped, and it arrived with no bun or wrap; no big deal there, but annoying.  They also seem to be slowly lessoning the wait staff, as each table now has a ridiculous screen for ordering appetizers, reordering drinks, and playing games and such. You also use it to pay your bill. It added a cold air of detachment to the experience, as if they can no longer be bothered to check on tables as frequently as before, although our server did make us a priority.  After the meal, we let the boys spend a few quarters in the game area, which was sad. The machines are obviously not being replenished, and I'm sure will be removed at some point in the near future, as Red Robin is moving toward an atmosphere of the sports bar and grill (of which there are already plenty and better establishments). When we got to the car, we realized our little guy had left his play glasses in the both, so I went back in for them. The hostess made a show to find them, but came back saying they weren't there. I had to tell 2 other people about them before they were finally found by someone who could be bothered to actually look.  Don't bother patronizing this or any Red Robin. There are better places for a burger; in Woodinville there are much better places for a beer, and families should definitely pass, as they obviously no longer want kids here (which I find silly as kids are future patrons themselves).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=20

Bad call.  Let me start by pointing out we were there before 5 p.m., so it wasn't busy at all. The waitress was nice enough, but never once came back to check on us. And that was a big problem for several reasons. 1.) My wife didn't get the sweet potato fries she ordered (still got charged the $1.50) 2.) Our toddler dropped her spoon. I tracked down another waiter who reluctantly offered to help. When he entered the kitchen I overheard him say, in a condescending tone , ""I love babies."" 3.) No drink or fry refills were offered until well after we'd finished our meals. 4.) When we spoke to the manager, he asked if we wanted anything (free dessert). We aren't the kind of people who complain to get free stuff, so we declined. All we asked for was our bill. That took another 10-15 minutes to show.

Michael M.,"Woodinville, WA",0,2,,1.0,7/17/2016,"I know I already reviewed this place before... but... I feel I would be remiss if I did not share a certain-- *cough* shall we say-- ""experience"" I had there recently... It all started when I was trying to find a restaurant that was accommodating with regards to dairy allergies. Some places did alright, while other failed miserably. When I went to Red Robin, I was CERTAIN they would pass with flying colors... BOY was I in for a surprise... For my order, I asked for a Burnin' Love Burger with mayo on the side, and cucumber slices with the non-dairy breading used for the onion rings. The waiter confidently took my order... then, as he was walking away, I tugged on his sleeve. ""By the way,"" I said nonchalantly as he turned to look at me, ""I'll need you to file an allergy alert for dairy along with my order."" (Should be simple enough), I thought to myself, scratching my chin. (After all, Red Robin's allergy alert system is ingenious. I've ordered burgers without cheese from them before, so why should this challenge be any different?) All that was left was to steeple my fingers and wait. The ball was in the Robin's court. Some time later, my meal arrived. As the waiter turned to leave, I tugged his sleeve again to stop him. ""A test,"" I said, holding up my finger. He watched, frowning as I lifted the bun off the burger. So far, so good... I deftly flipped through the lettuce, jalapeno rings, tomatoes, and the patty... no cheese on either side of any of them. The mayo was in a little cup to the side, just as I had asked-- a perfect solution had I been allergic to eggs, and had I been accompanied by someone else who wanted extra mayo. I cracked my knuckles-- time to step it up a notch. The waiter began to speak, but I shushed him. I would NOT be distracted. Lifting a cucumber stick to my lips slowly, I ran it from side to side, tasting the breading carefully for any trace of dairy. ""It's clean,"" I announced with a sigh of relief. ""That is all, waiter. You may go."" As he slowly turned to walk away, I grabbed his sleeve again. ""Wait!"" I said, grabbing the burger. ""There's something I forgot!"" ""I examined its insides thoroughly for any sign of cheese, and found not a trace. However, what of the bun?"" I slowly traced my fingertip across the top of the bun, and confirmed my suspicion, I slowly lifted the bun to my mouth and licked it carefully, gathering evidence of the restaurant's mistake. ""Butter!"" I shouted. ""You put butter on the buns, thinking I wouldn't notice, thinking that my allergies would flare up sometime later, and that I would blame them on something else! Well, you won't get a fast one past me... not only did your little trap fail my test, but I'm not even allergic to dairy! CHECKMATE!"" This rather disillusioning experience was dragged out a while longer, but I won't bore you with the details. Suffice it to say, avoid the Robin if you have a severe dairy allergy. They might have a handle on the basics of allergy alerts, but they're a far cry from going pro...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=40
Lee A.,"Kirkland, WA",84,71,81,4.0,8/21/2015,"The thing about Red Robin is that you know what you're going to get. Or at least you know what to expect. You can expect a great selection of delicious burgers and and ever-changing menu as they try to keep the options exciting and bring new tastes to us. So really, it comes down to the service which makes or breaks each location. Overall we had a good experience at this location. There were 5 adults and 3 kids - all under 5. We were seated with ample room for all of us (kids require bringing so much 'stuff' along with you) and everyone, including our server, was friendly and helpful. The one complaint I have is that our server mostly sensitive the fact that we had kids. She brought us the crayons and stuff for them and even took their orders first (good to get in right away). However there was a lag between when she took their orders and then came back for ours, which means the kids get and finish their meals well before the adults are remotely done. It ended up working out OK as we continued to stuff our kids full of fries while we finished our meals (kind kidding) but would be something to bring up in training about how to best meet the needs of families with young kids.

Rebecca F.,"Cary, NC",64,468,347,3.0,11/3/2012,"Obviously a chain restaurant and you pretty much get what you expect here. It's worthy of a review only because of the customer service here -- which is surprisingly.... tolerant!  I was really surprised at just how crowded this location was when we stepped in (our original lunch option was closed and this was our back-up option). Perhaps because so many other places nearby are a bit more pricey (thinking of Big Fish Grill, Teddy's Bigger Burgers, etc.) more people flock to RR. Whatever the reason, it definitely was crowded with a wait at the door and a rather packed restaurant! Our dining experience was as expected with no problems or issues. The staff seemed very friendly despite dealing with various issues that were popping up around us though. At a nearby table one customer was just complaining constantly and management came to discuss the problem with them and they were so patient and even able to maintain their composure for something that seemed rather trivial to us at our table. The customer with the complaint wouldn't calm down, but the staff at RR handled it beautifully. This RR definitely does a good job with their staff from the greeters to waiters all the way up to their management. They also stay true to what is expected of the RR experience. Well done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=60

Newly decorated, busy, with an airplane theme. Service is brisk and prompt, menu is impossible to read with the dim lights (use your cellphone flashlight). Drinks are large and easily replenished.  The real kicker - I ordered my food, it came out different than I ordered (they were busy). The MANAGER came and asked how it was, took my order back and I had a replacement plate within five minutes (plus a whole new batch of fries).

I think both times somehow that one ~$4 beer has gotten me a little tipsier than I'd like to be after one beer. Oops. (Last time around I had a Stella.) The servers have been consistently cheerful and friendly. Kind of what I generally expect at a RR. Last time around I was slightly hungry when I was there, but not for anything I could find on the menu. I ended up asking about the cost of an order of their fries... and found out it was only $1.99. I'm not sure if they were bottomless or not because I only needed/wanted that one round, but I was pretty satisfied with what I got for the price. Over all it's... Red Robin. It's consistent and good for what it is, but not what I'd consider to be a great option for food / burgers now that I've explored more of what restaurants in the Seattle area have to offer.... and especially now that I've discovered happy hour (which is something that RR does not have).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=80

After waiting for 40 minutes, our waiter came by our table and said he'd check on our order as it still hadn't arrived.  Once he checked, our meals arrived.  Cold.  Without eating utensils or napkins.  And I had emptied my drink.  I flagged down another waiter, and asked if she could please give us some napkins and eating utensils and a drink refill.  Twenty minutes later, another server stops by our table and says another server asked the manager to drop off our requests, but he was busy and so was the original server so now he's dropping them off (what?!?).  We then ate our now legitimately cold meals (sans refills).  The manager stopped by to say ""sorry, but your waiter has a large party to tend to"" (because that's a legitimate reason to ignore our table of two apparently).  Another fifteen minutes pass by and our waiter comes by and says he's so sorry, but he had a big party to tend to (yes, really) and just forgot about us and the utensils and refills, etc, etc.  At this point, we ask for the check and leave.

JoAnn A.,"Bellevue, WA",80,319,32,3.0,3/7/2012,"I've been here twice over the last six months. The one thing I certainly don't like about this place (and it probably goes for all locations I'm guessing) is they told us they don't take reservations. So for the first time I came here, we had a party of maybe 8-9, and since reservations weren't allowed, we had to wait a very long time to be seated because I guess whoever had a large party was just sitting there. I get it, after you eat and pay you wanna talk a little more, that's fine, I've done it before too. I think if a reservation option was available, we wouldn't have had to wait as long because we'd already have seats for us, instead of having to stand around hungry for longer than we expected. The more recent time I came here, the wait for a table of about the same size was about ten minutes or less!

Chris O.,"Kirkland, WA",13,306,1,2.0,7/27/2011,"I like Red Robin in general.  They have interesting blue-collar food that I enjoy once in awhile.  My visit tonight (Wed) however missed on most cylinders. It was half-full so we got seated right away, with crayons, a balloon and a booster for the 4yo kiddo.  We were asked for a drink order and they arrived soon.  So far, so good.  Our food order was taken at 7:00. My wife's salad came out at 7:10.  Then we waited, with no food, until 7:25.  Then my wife and I received our entrees (which were lukewarm), but nothing for the kid.  Also 1 set of napkin/silverware.  Any my BBQ burger had no BBQ sauce.  After a few minutes someone returned with BBQ sauce and 1 (!) additional set of silverware.  I guess the kid didn't need any. At 7:35 my kid got her pizza.  It was doughy and mushy as if it had been microwaved.  It was supposed to come with raw broccoli/dip and fries... but it arrived with cooked broccoli only.  We asked and about 5 minutes later got fresh broccoli and dip, and at 7:45, when we were all pretty much done, my kid got fries that had to cool down. The waitress was nice and apologized for a couple of the misses, but took nothing off the bill.  Plus, when I gave her my credit card she came back having charged a different table's bill.  Which she then corrected. On a Saturday when RR is crazy, it's not too hard to forgive a few mistakes.  But on a Wednesday, when your kid normally goes to bed at 8 and you're stretching it a bit and there are plenty of employees standing around with not enough to do, this is not ok. RR mistakes will happen, but when you've clearly goofed up 2+ times on one table, get the manager involved to straighten everything out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=100

My mac n cheese was delicious, but still.. my hot wings were cold. My dad loved his dinner. He got a salad and a bunless burger.

My wife and I went out for a fish sandwich, salad, and onion rings...  Here's the chronology... NCAA tournament is on, time was around 8 PM.  Restaurant was fairly busy, but we were seated right away.   Server apologized for the delay (he was busy) - we understood :) Ordered drinks and our Onion rings and asked for them to be served first before our meal.  At the same time we also ordered a fish sandwich, salad, and fries.  We asked for the fish sandwich order to be put in after the o-rings so we could enjoy a hot meal. The o-rings came out cold, we requested replacement.  The server took them back and the ""manager"" stopped by and apologized and gave us replacement rings.  Hot this time - they also removed them from our bill.  That was nice. 10 minutes later our fish sandwich arrived with fries and a side salad.  The fish was COLD and soggy, the fries were cold...  They were delivered by another server.  We asked for refills on our water...  No water refills came... After already raising a concern about the cold onion rings...  We looked and the manager was busy talking with his staff in the bar and in the back.  He was nowhere in sight to greet customers, or to follow-up. Disappointed...  We ended up eating a cold soggy fish sandwich with cold fries with a salad.  Several minutes later our server stopped by - we again asked for waters, he did return with refills.  Clearly he was ""busy"", but that is expected at RR...  It did not seem like he was any busier than a typical evening at RR.

We came in on Easter Sunday while running an errand in Woodinville. First off, props to all the suckers who either volunteered for working or didn't get a choice. It was a gorgeous day, like the first 70 degree day of the year, so everybody wanted to sit outside. (and by everybody means like 10 tables.. it wasn't crowded, but crowded enough that it was a lot of tables for one person). Ashley seriously stepped it up. She was bubbly, friendly, very attentive and super nice. She was on top of her game, especially for it being hot out and she was the only one out there. I'm pretty sure she also mentioned she was preggo. She brought out fries for us to snack on before our burgers without us even having to ask. She constantly refilled our beverages. When I told her I had an allergy she made extra notes to have them cook it on a separate surface! I didn't even know RR did that. Nobody else has ever offered that when I say I'm extremely allergic to gluten..My order came out wrong and she noticed before she even sat it on the table. She brought me more fries while I waited for a replacement, and took it off my tab for the inconvenience.  She made our experience ultra enjoyable. Thank you!!

It came out without salsa or jalapenos on it, so it was sent back. 2. Both our burgers and fries were luke warm when we got them. 3. Everything took forever. Drinks weren't refilled. We didn't get a refill of fries until the very end and they weren't even the garlic ones we had paid extra for. 4.

And that was just within range, it was LOUD here! Every time either of us said anything, we both had to lean over the table and talk in a very loud voice. Not a great place for a conversation.

Julia Z.,"Bellevue, WA",561,589,586,4.0,5/13/2006,"Wow, I can't believe I'm the first Yelper to review this restaurant as it's nearly ALWAYS busy or even packed.  LOCATION. It's convenient. In fact, living 1.5 miles away, with a 6 year old and an 11 year old, you could say that this is our avoid-McDonald's path of least resistance. We eat here at least twice a month. The Woodinville location is in the middle of a retail complex incuding Target, Top Food, Barnes & Noble, a pet store, and a movie theater, among many other, smaller stores.  AMBIENCE. It's annoyingly loud and color-saturated. Red Robins are fairly cookie-cutter from one location to another, all having lots of Americana including pseudo-old carousel horses, baseball mementos, and the like. The music is too loud. The place is usually busy enough and people end up speaking loudly to be heard. And it seems like there's at least one birthday celebrated just to torture us each time we're there. Tell me again why we go?  PRICES. They're pretty reasonable even though they've gone up a few times in the past few years.  FOOD. Something for most, good stuff for the kids, and a broad range of salads and burgers mean that most people will find an item or two that they like. Many foods have soy protein ingredients, including the french-fry seasoning, so if you're allergic or avoiding the hormonal implications of soy, be aware. They will bring you ""naked"" fries if you ask. I especially like their flavorful and healthier turkey burger; they'll substitute the turkey patty for a beef patty on any of their burgers. Right now, I'm a fan of the BBQ burger with a turkey patty and bacon added. You can tell that I'm not low maintenance... which brings me to....  SERVICE. Hit or miss. Dayna is the best waitress at this location; ask for her if you'd like a smile and accurate food delivery. She always remembers the lime for my Diet Coke and doesn't mind my crazy burger requests. She's nice to the kids and easy on the eyes. At other times, including today at lunchtime on the sunny patio, waiters have ranged from indifferent to completely inept. I always feel like I can't expect too much out of these teenagers (most of them are under 25 in any case) but I do get pushy if they completely forget us, and especially if they are not busy, the tip meter ticks all the way down to 25 cents if they ignore us for too long.  The desserts, by the way, are insanely huge and surprisingly bland. Don't bother. On the other hand, their flavored lemonades and other homemade non-alcoholic drinks are quite good. The kids especially enjoy them, and the glasses they come in are festive, brightening the table up nicely (in case you feel the place is too dull).  Finally, the pinball machine in the lobby is a good one. But don't kick our high scores out... JAZ and DIO. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=120
Dave F.,"Cedar Park, TX",56,93,12,1.0,3/18/2010,"UPDATE:  My wife and I have returned to give Red Robin another chance after not going there for over a year. (See old review below.) Our first time back, I had really good Tortilla Soup and my wife enjoyed her sandwich. Good service. Our second time back we only ordered deserts. Both of our deserts came on EXTREMELY dirty plates. It was as if no one had washed the plates from some earlier greasy meal. They had visible grease TOP and BOTTOM. The smeared grease on these plates was visible to the naked eye. (Keep in mind, this is ice cream and mud pie we've ordered, not onion soup.) My plate of ice cream had bits of parsely from a previous meal on it. No, not baked on -- the parsely was just clinging loosely to the grease on my plate. I can't imagine how this could stick to a plate thru any kind of washing (machine or hand).  The wait staff and manager were both very good about it. They immediately replated our deserts. And in the end, the manager didn't charge us for the deserts, only the coffee. I DO appreciate that. But the facts are the facts and they deserve to be reviewed as such. OLD REVIEW: I used to very much enjoy this Red Robin. But after being away for 3 years, I came back w/ my new wife from South America and it turned ugly. We NEVER go back now. They refused to allow my wife to sit at the bar -- even though we weren't ordering alcohol. She was 27 y.o. at the time and was carrying at least 3 forms of ID, including a valid current MT driver's license with recent photo. The manager simply refused to honor the license and claimed that her passport and green card were not valid forms of ID in WA. They made us get up from the bar and move to a table at the back. Meanwhile, we missed what little was left of the World Series -- the only reason we had gone there in the fist place.

Brianna F.,"Woodinville, WA",0,3,,1.0,1/19/2013,"I've been going to Red Robins since I was a little girl! Therefore I have been to many different Red Robin franchises. I moved to Woodinville less than two years ago, so this became the Red Robin of choice if we ever wanted Red Robin. It is probably the dirtiest Red Robin I have ever been in. The floors and the molding along the floor and the wall has quite the buildup of dirt. Gross. I always have to wipe my booth off before siting down unless I want to sit on the person's food from before me.  Other than this, the food was always the same as the other Red Robins, which is a good thing. Until.....I ordered my 10month old a side of their mandarin oranges (like .90 cents) and as I am feeding her, there is cheddar cheese mixed throughout the oranges. Sick. Obviously I flagged the waitress down and told her. She asked us if she could get us more and I said no thanks and she was about to walk away with out even removing the dish from our table. I actually had to say wait and hand it to her. Then she shows up a bit later with a new dish of oranges...even though we said no. Whatever. We get the bill and needless to say the oranges are still on the bill. I know its just .90 cents but come one, it's the principle of the matter! I asked her to remove it from our bill and she yelled across the room to the manager to ask him to take it off. Terrible service.  The very next time we come back, maybe about a month later, I order a diet coke and after drinking about half of it there is something in my glass!! I fish it out with my straw and it is a DIRTY STRING. Wow. Asked for the manager and her exact words were ""I am sorry, there is not much more I can do than say I am sorry."" Are you kidding me!? My husband and I just stared at each other like wtf. How about comp our bill? Or maybe, just maybe, take the diet coke off.... I worked as a host, server and manager in the restaurant business when I was younger. I know good service and good management. This place has neither...not even a good bus boy.

Wampa C.,"Woodinville, WA",0,55,,3.0,8/8/2012,"We go to this Red Robin weekly and sometimes multiple times a week.  Although it is the worst Red Robin we go to - it is the most convenient one near our house.  They mess up our food about 25% of the time we go here - it always seems to be a problem with the cooks/kitchen.  Once I ordered a BBQ chicken wrap - after the first bite I knew something was different but didn't figure it out until I was halfway done - IT DIDNT HAVE ANY BBQ SAUCE IN IT!  Seems odd to leave out the BBQ Sauce in a BBQ Chicken Wrap.  I told the waitress who just said ""oh I will go get you some""  she arrived with a small cup of the barbecue sauce that I had to disassemble the wrap and apply myself - we didn't get any credit for the meal.  This is only one of the typical things that go wrong.  Since we go here enough we know that we should never order a cocktail unless we see a Bartender on duty - leaving this up to the general servers will always result in a bad drink.   Always make sure they give you napkins before you bit into your juicy burger and have it dripping down your hand - about half the time they forget to give us napkins or utensils with salads.  We have found that in the past 6 months they have some new staff that really make a difference.   The guy running the bar most days makes great drinks and is fun to talk to.  They have some servers too that seem to be more friendly and knowledgeable than the ones in the past.  They also extended the bar area (which in the past only included 2 person tables - which was horrible for happy hour if you had a group of more than 2) - now the bar booths can accommodate groups up to 6.  I am happy to see the Woodinville Red Robin improving and hope it continues into the kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=140
Benni M.,"Redmond, WA",18,96,1,4.0,9/19/2007,"This place is so yummy. I like it a lot because it has what I call comfort class. It isn't like a diner or a place where you feel rushed or a snotty top of the line place. It is a place where you can relax during your meal unless it is noisy hour. It is best to go for lunch when all the other people are working and there are no crying babies. I like the fact that for a picky person like me they can remember to hold the mayo, tomatoes and no pink in my meat. The burgers are so yummy. I mean really yummy. I will get a craving once in a while. I love the whiskey river as well as the mushroom and cheese one, I forget what they call it but, it is damn good. It is near the movies so it is good and bad, good if you want to eat before a movie, bad if you just want to eat and it is crowded with movie goers.  Never, EVER go when something like Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean or especially a kid's movie recently has come out. It will be crowded as %$&@!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=140
Patrick L.,"Redmond, WA",8,33,5,4.0,1/29/2011,Friendly. good for the kids. so far so good with the burgers (as they are cooked to my specification ... medium rare do mean medium rare). So far saturday afternoons and weekday nights are very good to us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=140
Shawn T.,"Seattle, WA",6,4,,1.0,6/3/2013,"I would rate it one star, but that wasn't an option. I generally enjoy my visits here. It's been my guilty pleasure until today. I waked in the door and there was no one there to greet or seat me. I stood for several minutes as no less than 7 employees, including the manager walked by and looked directly at me without even a nod or a hello. It wasn't until two more guests arrived and were standing nearby that the manager finally said ""three?"". The latter two told him I was first and he waled over to a table and dropped a menu there for me and went back to seat the others. A nice server came by and gor my drink order. He left my drink and went on his way. After sitting a few more minutes, I'd had it. I left.  The place wasn't even busy. I won't return to this location anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=140
Scott H.,"Kenmore, WA",0,62,5,4.0,9/19/2010,"I can't help it, I love red robin.  Great veggie burgers (I wish they still had the bayou burger) and the bottomless fries are great.  A grat value, great burger and decent beer selection for a chain. Our son loves the mac and cheese.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=140
Amber M.,"Browns Point, WA",2,27,,4.0,6/14/2010,"I've visited many Red Robin loacations over the years, and I have to say that this location is by far the most conistent. The food is always great, the waitstaff is nice... My only complaint is that it's always freezing in there! I bring a sweater whenever I dine there. Other than that, I have no complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=140
Howard S.,"Snohomish, WA",0,1,,5.0,3/5/2012,This restaurant is consistently great & the service is top notch.  We were there on a busy Friday night.  The wait staff was constantly checking with us to apologize for our food being slow when it was understandable the kitchen was inundated with orders.  The manager gave us a free appetizer while we waited. At this restaurant customer service is a priority.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=140
Eugene V.,"Woodinville, WA",0,18,,2.0,7/5/2011,"You get about the same here as you would expect at every other Red Robin.  A menu heavy on burgers, and an atmosphere heavy on noise.  The place is an echo chamber and all of the customers must think their dining partners are hard of hearing.  And the inevitable birthdays with that insipid birthday chant they do!  Bring ear plugs, prevent a headache.  And whatever you do, don't order coffee with your meal.  They will have to brew a new pot to bring your first cup, and you'll have to tackle someone to bring you a refill.  I only eat here when dragged, kicking and screaming, by people with lower standards and damaged eardrums.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=140
Patrick S.,"Bothell, WA",1,49,,4.0,9/24/2010,"This place gets 4 stars for the food being pretty good, but mostly for it being a good kid friendly restaurant. I had the Shrimp and Slaw. The shrimp had good flavor, but not extraordinary. The fries are awesome and are bottomless with all of the meals. The slaw was very good and came with a better serving than most places. I've had better food, but this restaurant is very good at what it does. The beer selection can use some work. My recommendation is to put a little more effort into supporting the awesome local breweries in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=140
Jim R.,"Woodinville, WA",0,2,,1.0,12/6/2011,"I saw from the RR website that Jim Beam burgers were free for anyone named ""Jim on Dec 5th, 2011.  Really?  Actually it was not free at all for this ""Jim"".  So, I go all the way to Red Robin to get a free Jim Beam burger.  First I'm told fries are not included - ok, I'll buy fries.  The waitress checks my I.D. and I place my order.  Then about 5 minutes later the waitress comes back to ask if I'm a ""royal member"".  I said I wasn't.  So she said my burger is not free unless I join and can activate my membership right then and there using my phone to access their website.  One problem - my phone does not have web access.  So she said my burger is not free.  Rather than succumb to big corporate dishonest gaming to try to get me to spend money instead of honoring their offer that they made public on their website - I left in disgust.  I went back and checked - I could not see the requirement that ""Jim"" had to be a ""royal member"".  I won't be patronizing this company again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=140
Matt E.,"Kirkland, WA",1,29,,5.0,7/21/2008,If I can pick one spot to go to lunch or dinner its Red Robbin.  The BBQ Chicken Whiskey River Chicken is my fav.  You can special order everything on your burger from low fat sauce to garlic mayo and jalapenos.  Reasonably priced.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodinville?start=140
