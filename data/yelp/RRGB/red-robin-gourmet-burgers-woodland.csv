Nicos B.,"Davis, CA",79,69,40,4.0,12/11/2017,"We stopped by for lunch because we wanted bottomless fries and their whiskey river BBQ chicken wrap. The wrap was fresh-tasting and good. The fries were hot and warm and we got a couple more baskets to eat. I think they purposely make the fries a little bland so that you season then yourself; they taste better with the seasoning on the table.  The service was okay. She wasn't the greatest, but also not the worst. Just almost average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodland
Kristy W.,"Eugene, OR",288,414,437,4.0,10/19/2017,"We stopped here on a Sunday night on our way home to Eugene, Or from a weekend of fun at Knott's Scary Farm. We were getting a little hangry, and didn't want the typical In n Out next door. Now don't get me wrong, once in a while I love it, since we don't have one. A good ole banzai burger sounded delicious, along with a cup of tortilla soup. There was a line out the door, but thankfully it wasn't too busy in the bar area so we were able to grab a table in the bar.  We were served pretty fast, and the food was good. The typical Red Robin food. I am one to like it, have for years. But there are times you go and they can mess up on your order, or the food is not cooked right. Not the case here, and that made me happy especially considering I was hangry and I wanted to get back on the road to get home. I had some fluffy puppy's waiting at home to see me.  We had our soup, burgers, my guy even ordered a shake and we were out in what seemed like a flash and we were back on the road back home with our bellies full. I would stop here again if I am back on a road trip. We have stopped in this area before a few times to eat on our road trips.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodland

Our server was nice but it took them a long time to get the food after we ordered it.

Rachelle S.,"Sacramento, CA",105,44,5,5.0,12/18/2017,"I'm basing my review on online orders only as that's all I've ever done there. But they are absolutely wonderful with online to-go orders if you need a quick pick up and good food for your office lunch whether it's just you or you and your co-workers.  My orders have always been on time and ready to go. It's super easy to order online and then when I go in, I just state I ordered online and they do my official ring up (that I've pre-paid and am picking up), gather my food and send me on my way. They even send you off with a to-go cup of fries. The woman who has checked me out both times is super friendly and makes sure she tells me my order and points everything out and sends me off with all that I need. I definitely recommend online to-go orders! They are quick and convenient with good food that'll hit the spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodland

Samm A.,"Benicia, CA",23,22,1,3.0,7/15/2017,"When I entered there was no one at the Host Station, finally a girl appears, hand me a menu then says to seat myself in the bar. I say I don't want to sit in the bar. So she replies then sit where you want and walks away. Yolanda comes and gets my drink order, then my meal order. I look around and 6-8 employees are eating, texting and just sitting there in the main room. Others stop by as they come out of serving area.  The server who brought my order wasn't Yolanda. But, it was the wrong burger. I brought it to her attention and she offered to redo it, but I was so hungry. I said no, then she offered to get me the grilled pineapple for the burger I had ordered. Soon, one of the male managers came by and offered more fries. Not a good first impression for a place I could be dining at often.

Bobbi P.,"Sacramento, CA",12,28,,5.0,7/14/2017,"Great Experience! We went in to grab a late lunch, early dinner yesterday and everything was amazing. The place was very clean, the staff was extremely friendly, the food was great, no complaints really. The waiter Josh was training with Katie and I think he did a fantastic job! He and Katie came over as soon as we were sat at our table, she helped him when needed, he knew the menu, was friendly, so I would say great job to them both!  We usually don't go to Red Robin because the food and service at the Elk Grove location has been terrible the past few times we went. But, my kiddos love Red Robin so I figured I would give the Woodland location a try and I'm glad I did.  Great job Josh, Katie, and BOH team you all rocked it yesterday!

J G.,"Yuba City, CA",11,51,14,1.0,4/29/2017,"Horrible service. Server after server would pass by me. No one came by for a good 10 mins. What gives. Red Robin in woodland cA is horrible.  My server, Brittany, finally came by.  Apologetic and all but in my humble opinion too little too late.  There is no excuse for that.  If I wanted to wait only to have someone come and get my drink (water) order, I would eat at home.  Ok, a little crazy.  Can't wait to get my food so I have the privilege to not leave this ""server"" a tip.  Service has always been a big deal for me. This is unacceptable.  I can probably understand if they were busy but it was very empty. So that tells me it is just a server that is not very attentive to their customers when they come in.  4/29- Update for the Yelp community:  contrary to RR's statement from 17 days ago- no one has reached out to me.

Larry H.,"Los Angeles, CA",119,352,32,2.0,7/18/2016,"I had to grab a quick lunch.  One word of warning to all......'DO NOT' touch or play the wireless screens on each table.  It will cost you money and they will not ask you, are you sure you want to do this.  Automatic bill on your bill.  Not a good way to get started.  Also, the printer on the tablet is cheap and does not work. So, we ordered food and drink.  The Mai Tai is over $8.00 filled in a very short round goblet that is 3/4 ice.  Can you say 'rip off'?  I can!!!! We ordered the bottomless fries with garlic.  I can see why it is called bottomless, I counted them, there were seven small pieces of garlic fries.  RIP OFF!!!  The Turkey Burger was not cooked as requested and had to be re-done and have the extra items brought to the table. I then watched them clean the tables with the 'GROOOOOSSSSSS' wet table cloth!!!!!  YUUUUUUCCCCH!!!!!  People, you are eating on a germ infested table.  Wipe it down before you put your hands down.  There is so much bacteria on those reused wet cloth rags and the tables are not wiped dry afterward!!!!!!!  Double GROSS!!!!!!  The Turkey burgers were just ok.  I should have used yelp to find a place I was not familiar with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodland
Greg H.,"Cottage Grove, OR",15,14,,3.0,1/2/2017,"I had the Black & Bleu Burger, with a side salad instead of fries. This was dinner time, approximately 7pm. It was near my motel and fit my needs for the evening. I was alone. The burger was pretty good - definitely the best part of the meal.  Unfortunately, the salad was crappy: about 99% iceberg lettuce and one or two chips of cucumber.  No exaggeration. They provide salad as one of the free substitutions for fries. I totally get trying to expand the margin; but, geez! The wait staff was competent; however, they appeared to be bored to death and conveyed that boredom to me by their actions - or, lack thereof. The greeter seemed particularly bored as she seated me. Clean, pleasant environment. Service was pretty quick for me. I wouldn't be opposed to returning in the future; although, I'd probably select something else first.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodland
Mel L.,"Sacramento, CA",610,579,3204,2.0,5/21/2016,"Not the greatest experience today. We came in for lunch and sat in the bar. We didn't have to wait for a seat which is a plus. Orders were taken promptly. I got the Southern Charm, one of their most expensive burgers that are supposed to be top of the line (for Red Robin). I ordered my burger bunless, with no cheese. When the food came out, my burger was in a bun and cheese oozing all over it. Whomp whomp. I had to send it back. Then they had to remake the burger so I had to wait and wait...everyone was just about done with their meal by the time my food came out. I also ordered a side of chili for $3 to eat with my fries, and the chili was lukewarm and bland. The portion I got wasn't worth the extra money I paid for it. Even the fries were just warm and not piping hot as they should have been. I left full, but not satisfied.  My friend lives here in Woodland and comes here all the time, and thankfully this experience isn't the norm.

Crystal C.,"Sacramento, CA",235,342,1245,2.0,4/30/2016,"What is gourmet about these burgers?!?  Frozen patties.  Hubs ordered his burger well done, it came out burnt and undercooked inside.  My burger was dry and tasteless.  The bacon on his burger was two measly thin McDonalds size see through strips.  Those were undercooked as well.  & it was an extra $1.60 add on. Ouch...adding insult to injury.   The fries were limp and tasteless.  My fruit salad was not fresh.  It looked and tasted like it could be pre packaged.   One bright side is that our waitress was awesome.   She was very kind and had a great upbeat attitude.  But she didn't offer to bring out a re-fill on  hub's fries.  Oh well.  The decor is fresh and clean.   Overall awful burgers at a price tag of $28 with 2 fountain drinks before tipping.  Next time we'll go to In and Out that's a few shopfronts over.  But reading the other reviews and looking at their photos, our experience seemed to not to be the norm.   Possibly they were short on help in the kitchen or experiencing new kitchen staff...whatever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodland?start=20
Jj L.,"Mid-City, San Diego, CA",0,21,,5.0,3/11/2017,"My family always goes out to eat at this restaurant. I love their burgers! They are not the best burgers in the world - I'm a big burger person and they're probably a B/B+. But for the price and convenience if you live in Woodland, they are terrific. This Red Robin is REALLY FAST. They get out food in a snap. BUT. Bottomless fries, it take 20 minutes to receive the second batch. This is unacceptable, and they should be able to get them out a little faster. It's fries after all! If McDonalds can whip out new ones in 8-10, a Gourmet restaurant should be able to. SOMETIMES the employees get a little lazy and don't bring out the food quick enough. It's warm and under the heat lamp. This is the managers fault for not properly training the employees, not the employees fault. This definitely could be fixed. I think the ""excuse"" was that the fries were too hot. Well, I go to a restaurant to receive a hot meal, bud. But overall I love this place. My family eats here all the time.

Unfortunately they used to give you your steak fries as soon as you ordered but they stopped doing this (probably because people were eating to many fries!) I also like that they have milkshakes, but in my opinion the shakes cost about $1 more than they should and they make you pay an extra dollar to get the tin of extra milkshake!

I went on Friday night, it was rainy day. This poor older middle-aged - older man fell flat on his face because the mat wasn't placed where it should have been (and it was soaked), so the floor was slippery (he was leaving) and he fell not because he was clumsy because he didn't walk fast or anything.. Literally, I think he should sue because they didn't do much to change that condition when he left. My roomie's friend is pre-med and he thankfully was there to see if the man was okay or not. He could repeat numbers, but not have them backwards..

The bartender/waitress was horrible.  She was rude, inattentive, and MIA most of our time there. When I asked where the tin to my milkshake was, she snapped that ""people have to ask""-no they don't actually. She didn't put an orange slice in my dad's Blue Moon, but did for other peoples, then again we weren't too concerned about it since she never washed her hands on her multiple trips in and out of the bar. She brought out my mom's meal as an appetizer. We asked for fries when we ordered which has never been a problem before, but we didn't get them until after our meals. My dad and I wanted to share the garlic fries, and when we finally got them, there was barely any in the basket-not even a dozen of them. They sucked anyways.  Also, another waitress appeared who helped just one table in the bar area, she spent the whole time flirting with the guys there instead of helping any of the other tables. Oh, also! The bartender messed up the order of the couple by us! She was very rude and confrontational about, saying there was a ""miscommunication"", when they had to send back food and didn't get things they ordered.  I think the bartenders name is Paige, it's the only name on the receipt. She is an outright incompetent bitch and should not be working with the public.

As I waited and watched patiently, little did I know, I would soon say the words ""I will never eat here again!""  Tiffany calls to get the cook's attention and he hands her to go bags. She quickly and flawlessly opens the box. She then picks up the burger in foil to examine it. Unsure of the burger, she opens the foil to look at the meat.

Tiffany's UNWASHED STICKY BAR AND CASH HANDLING FINGERS ARE ON THE BUNS OF MY BURGER!!!!!  I talked to manager, David,to inform him of what I saw. David was unmoved by my story.

Ashley C.,"Sacramento, CA",58,89,156,4.0,10/12/2015,"I have lived in Sacramento practically my entire life and had never stopped in Woodland, CA prior to this week and oddly enough those circumstances both landed me at this red robin with different people sharing the experience with me. The second visit was a better experience but the first wasn't horrible by any means. The first visit was on a Saturday at just about noon and the place seemed packed when we got there but my in-laws were able to get us a booth quickly. We were seated within probably two minutes and that was just because they had to clean our table. We were starving since we had been outside at football games all morning. Our server was very nice and was prompt at filling our drinks which was very nice since we were so thirsty after being out in the sun. The have amazing Dr. Pepper if you are a fan. We ordered quickly but seemed to wait a long time for our food. After about 30 min the 3 of us got our food. I ordered the river whiskey chicken sandwich on a gluten free bun as I always do and when I picked it up the bottom bun was hard. I know that gluten free items are often dry so don't get me wrong when I say I was shocked that I could tap it with my nail and it literally made a clinking sound which made us all chuckle. I flagged down someone and they got us our server. He was very apologetic and offered to take it back and have it remade and I told him it wasn't a big deal and if he could just get me another bottom bun I would be fine, no sense in remaking it. It took over 5 min to get a new bun. It was warm and toasted but they didn't bring me any of the condiments that originally came on my bun and since the gluten free bun runs dry it is necessary. Since it had already taken so long and my in laws were nearly done eating I opted to just take the rest of my mother in laws blue cheese sauce that came with hers. It was really good but wasn't exactly the best flavor combo for my sandwich. My mother in law had the mushroom blucheese burger on a roll and my father in law had a mushroom Swiss burger. They loved theirs and said they were juicy and flavorful. Second visit: My husband has been away for work for nearly a month now and asked me to meet him here with our little guy for an early dinner so we could all spend time together since he had the afternoon off. This trip was much better! Our server was again very nice and friendly. I ordered the same things and this time it was probably the best one I have had to date. The bun was soft and the chicken was incredibly juicy! Our son had the pepperoni pizza and mandarin oranges which he loved and my husband ordered a fried seafood platter which he seemed pleased with. It did take a whole for our food to come out even though they were pretty empty inside. Since we were spending time with my husband and trying to just take our time and enjoy each other's company before we had to split ways we decided to order desserts. My son and I started a monster size Nana Nana moo moo milk shake which was banana and chocolate. I wasn't a fan of it since I grew up on  banana, chocolate and peanut butter milo shakes with malt made from my papa I have pretty high standards, however big shocker our 7 year old had no problem drinking his half and then topping off mine. My husband ordered a fruit smoothie made with coconut cream and it was very tasty! We were thankful that the restaurant wasn't busy yet since we had gone early for dinner so the wait staff didn't have an issue with us hanging out once we were done to talk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodland?start=60

I had to be extra careful leaving my burger on the the plate or else my finger would take bread chunks out of them. It was the strangest thing ever.  I ordered the guacamole burger and disappointedly there was barely anything in there. Burgers and Brew Spicy Guacamole Burger is way better and they add a lot more.

Sheena T.,"Silicon Valley, CA",289,450,138,4.0,11/14/2012,"Love, love, love Red Robin. I've been here about 8 times, and its never failed me. I've always ordered the bottomless freckled strawberry lemonade (and occasionally, if I've been good with my diet and exercise regime, a root beer float) and as for the appetizers, sometimes the towering onion rings or the trio with the sweet potato fries. The onion rings, have always, without fail, been crispy and fried to perfection. As for the entrees, I usually alternate between a classic chicken sandwich, a southwest chicken pasta, or clucks and fries - all of which are plenty delish and delectable. The chicken sandwich puts McDonald's chicken sandwich to shame. I hate myself for even putting Red Robin's chicken sandwich in the same sentence as Mickey D's! I'm sorry, Red Robin. The service here has been always pretty consistent, attentive, and friendly with not too much of a wait time during the times I go, and its convenient they open until 11 or 12. It takes about 10-15 minutes maximum for the food to come out if the restaurant is fairly occupied, which is perfectly fine with me. Their bottomless fries and drinks have always been a favorite, and kept me coming back! There's a ""Royalty Card"" here now, and I believe if you register it and have ten meals on it, you get one meal free.

Samantha B.,"Vacaville, CA",0,5,,2.0,5/26/2016,"I've been in twice in the last 6 months and I'm still not sure what all the fanfare is about. The food was just ok in my opinion. Just because you put a half dozen toppings on your burger doesn't make it a great burger. It was just a reheated frozen patty disguised by all of the stuff on top. The appetizers were better, portions were good for a family and the wedge salad was surprisingly tasty. Even if the food had been 5 star quality my biggest complaint was seating. Both times we visited, we were seated at the exact same table: right next to the kitchen in a high traffic walkway, and backed right up to another table that is so close that when people are seated at both tables it leaves approximately 8"" of space to walk through. We have a baby who uses a high chair and because of the booth style seating on one side of our table, the only spot to put the high chair was directly in the walkway. Servers had to squeeze through with trays of food and drinks hovered over our heads, and it didn't happen just once or twice, it was constant. It was annoying and disruptive to have to duck or lean forward every time they needed to pass by, and of course I couldn't help worrying that something would accidentally fall on my daughter from one of the trays. I plan to give it another try but I would strongly recommend requesting a table that's out of the way, especially if you have a little one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodland?start=80

Melissa K.,"Woodland, CA",0,38,,3.0,11/29/2015,"Sort of ok for a chain restaurant. Had a great waiter ! He gave good service, unfortunately it is the corporate set up that failed. They require that food servers bring the food and deal with the kitchen, not your waiter. They do not care if you get the food cold or the wrong food as the waiter still has to give them a percentage of the bill. If you give the waiter a small tip or no tip, he still has to give a percentage of the total bill to the helper staff. Our waiter was great and attentive, unfortunately since he couldn't bring the food, the fries were stone cold, and two orders were wrong. The Whiskey River salad was served, but really was the regular chicken salad, no bbq or special veggies. When asked the delivery person brought a side a bbq sauce and said, just put that on! It took five minutes to replace the order of ""bottomless"" fries with some that were at least warm. Of course when we wanted more (we did pay extra for bottomless) they didn't arrive until we were done and paying. The chicken sandwich that was being promoted in their advertising stressed Arugula on it, but came with nothing. We were told the kitchen was out and could be replace by salad mix. We still tipped our waiter appropriately as not his fault, but not really happy with other service or food. We live one mile away, but will not be returning soon. This does not happen at the other burger place in town. Will definitely keep our business there. Update: four of the five people in our party got sick for the next 24 hours.

Maybe 5-6$. The portion is not big at all. My other problem is that there was ranch under the fries and the cheese curds were breaded! Not everything needs to be breaded and fried. I can overlook the mushrooms on top, as a matter fact, I kind of enjoyed them on there. I won't order these again, they were a nice change but once is enough. My wife ordered the uberburger and was not impressed either. It didn't taste at all like what she was expecting also the brat resembled and tasted like a lump of coal but that's our fault for not sending back. One more problem I have is that if there is more than one person ordering, don't bring the food out staggered. Bring everything together. I got my poutine so I figured the burgers for the wife and kid can't be far behind. I was wrong and it cost me a warm meal. Just please bring the entrees out all together, that's all.

Dr. S.,"Davis, CA",0,38,1,1.0,8/19/2013,"This restaurant doesn't seem to handle busy periods well. By busy periods, that must mean dinner time. After the third negative experience, they've earned the one star. I've been to other RR's where the wait for food is a pardonable 30 minutes during busy times. An hour is not acceptable. The waitress tried to help by saying at the 45 minute mark the the food is just about ready. One thing good about the wait: We were able to set up a peer-to-peer WIFI network between our smartphones, downloaded two games, and mastered the games by the time the food arrived. Some advice for the management: Look at your workflow. Why does an order take so long when you're busy? Is it the number of cooks? The efficiency of the food prep process? Is your building designed to seat more people than the kitchen can accommodate?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodland?start=140
Tiffany H.,"Davis, CA",146,75,20,4.0,11/12/2011,"Went here for a friend's 21'st birthday party. Although they did not take reservations a couple of days ahead (guess it gets too busy), they had no problem saving us a table (for 20) an hour before we said we would arrive. Thank goodness this place is huge. We had no wait!  Food. Bottomless pit of fries AND drinks? Holy crap, it was my kind of place! I would recommend either getting the garlic fries or the sweet potato fries. In my opinion, the steak fries were kind of bland. I was in the mood for a burger or sandwich and kind of hoped they had a seafood version, but everything seafood was breaded and fried. So, I went vegan and ordered the keep-it-simple burger sub w/ their vegan patty. It was.. expected. I could have just microwaved a BOCA patty at home and it would still taste the same. (Maybe I should have orded the mushroom burger..) On the other hand.. everyone's burgers looked pretty freaking good! My roommate had the turkey burger. Even though she had turkey for lunch, she still liked the turkey burger--she said it was super delicious! I was surprised she wasn't sick of it. I give one of the waiters that served us 5 stars (although he forgot my warm water, but it's understandable because we had soooo many people), while everyone else a 3. The waiter we got was SO nice and approachable! He was very responsive and always made sure we were taken care of. The waitresses seemed annoyed the whole time (didn't want to be there?). Everyone seemed stuffed and happy by the end of the night. No regrets coming here.

I usually order the Royal Red Robin and it tastes just like the ones I get from any other Red Robins I go to.  The campfire sauce tasted a bit off, but I figured that can improve as the service here matures. The service seemed pretty good, and at times a bit overstaffed.  We can't complain because we were always stocked with anything we wanted on the table, fries, and drinks were always replenished.

My friend ordered a pint Guinness beer from the happy hour menu. She brought out what we found out later to be a stein of beer. Her comment after I waved at her was sorry for leading my friend to a false conclusion on the beer size after she finished talking to a guest for a inordinate long amount of time. What?

(wink wink)  Coming to this Red Robin has made me realize something extremely fantabulous, GARLIC & PARMESAN STEAK FRIES are 'both' BOTTOMLESS and AT NO EXTRA COST!!!!! How fantabulous is that?! Now, pair that with a Double Mushroom Swiss Burger and perhaps a cold, rigorously-poured, foamy beer on the side, you'll be more-happy-in-your-tummy than a fat-kid-loves-fried-bacon. =]  I know a couple of these reviews have complained about the service, I don't really know what to say other than ""Give them a break, break off a piece of that KitKat bar for yourself."" They just opened barely a month, and they are extremely nice.  I know you want to get in and get out, but what happened to enjoying your lunch or dinner with time? Never hurts. Just stare at their funky artwork, or better yet, stare at the newly trained waiters and waitresses and count how many glasses and utensils they drop! Or, you can do what I do, I ask for a kid's menu and I sit there and color outside the lines. =]  Either way, enjoy your time at Red Robin. Also, don't forget to get a Red Royalty Card, it comes in handy. Once you get your card activated, you go back to Red Robin and get a free appetizer. A free appetizer definitely is the way to start a meal! Although you only get ONE free appetizer, the trick is to get a royalty card for everyone in your party, let's say in your first visit you went with 3 others. Well that's 4 cards all together and 4 free appetizers all together, so one week you use your card and the next time use someone else's for a free appetizer. Fun? I think so!  Well, that's my update.

Meat was cooked to about medium and fries were all hot.  SERVICE: Service was fine, we came earlier during lunch, so we didn't have to wait to get a seat, to order, or to pay. VALUE: Given the fries are endless, this would be a great value for stuffing your stomach. Even without the free burger in mind, this place is ok if you like variety in your burgers.

The first time I ordered my burger ""medium"" it was perfect. However, the second time I went, this time with my family--this past Saturday--all three of us ordered burgers. We all asked for medium, but all three burgers came out very well done. I would actually characterize them as crunchy. I only ate half of my burger before giving up. I wasn't going to say anything to the server, but she looked at my plate and asked if everything was okay. The manager-in-training, Josiah, ended up coming over, and I'm not sure why he is ""in training,"" because he did EXACTLY what a manager should do.  He was very apologetic, and since I didn't want anything taken off my bill, he gave my family a gift card that we could use in the future.

Jeff R.,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",47,134,59,2.0,7/10/2013,"I generally enjoy Red Robin and stopped into this location for the first time in almost 2 years.  I was trying to grab a quick burger for a late lunch and get on my way back to work.  It was late afternoon so the restaurant was almost completely empty; I decided to sit at the bar for what I hoped would be fast service since time was short.  I was greeted quickly by the bartender and offered a drink; I ordered a beverage and since I'm familiar with the menu immediately placed my food order.  I sipped on my drink as I watched the baseball game on the TV while being completely ignored by the bartender who was in the middle of re-organizing the bar and doing some cleaning and maintenance.  After about 10 minutes I looked over towards the kitchen and saw the cook place my burger on the counter, fully expecting the bartender to go grab my meal I waited patiently.  Another 5 minutes passed and 2 other customers came in and they were greeted and offered drinks which were served as I continued to wait for someone to bring my food out to me.  Finally the bartender walked out from behind the bar and headed towards the kitchen; unfortunately she didn't even go to the counter and get my food, instead briefly chatted with another server and then came back with some items she had grabbed from the server station.  She inquired with the other customers if they were ready to order and they both placed their food orders.  Bartender went back to tasking and another 5 minutes passed before she realized that maybe my food was ready.  She went over to the counter and grabbed my meal which had now been sitting under heat lamps for over 10 minutes.  The burgers are generally halfway decent and the bottomless fries are a bonus but my meal was lukewarm and I had only about 12 fries in my basket.  In a hurry I ate my meal and finished my drink before I was done; as I took my last bite I was asked if I wanted another beverage.  I politely declined and didn't dare ask for more fries as I didn't have 15-20 minutes to wait for what would have amounted to 10 more fries.  Considering how slow the place was I found this service to be a joke. Red Robin has great happy hour specials, a nice selection of appetizers, burgers, and other menu items so you can count on a pretty good meal.  Service was a big problem on this visit but I may be willing to give them another chance if I was eating in this area again.  If the service is the same as it was on this visit; I will never return!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodland?start=160

My mom ordered the fish n' chips so i had to try them, a little on the greasy side but very delicious cod(did not care to much for the tarter sauce) Red Robin has: Ok service,bottom less fries, TV'S built in to the floor(Neat) and is kid friendly.This place has the bar side about 1/4 of the restaurant (adults) and the kid side 3/4 of the restaurant Loud.

Hannah L.,"San Jose, CA",127,531,237,3.0,1/13/2013,"I honestly think majority of all Red Robins are the same. The same tasting burgers with the same unlimited steak fries. The only difference would probably be the level of service that is offered. Some Red Robins do an excellent job in delivering customer service, while others lack. This location was no different to the numerous ones I've been to. The service was pretty much average, but I did notice that this location is not as packed as the other ones I've been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-woodland?start=160
