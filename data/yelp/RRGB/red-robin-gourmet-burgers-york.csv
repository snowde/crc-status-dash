Danielle Z.,"North Brunswick, NJ",71,31,,4.0,7/31/2017,"The restaurant was not very busy, but it was a Sunday around 8. Our server was fabulous and attentive.  She was even willing to tell us about the area since we are looking to move out here. The prices were very reasonable.   We had the pretzel bites with cheese sauce for an appetizer. We loved the pretzel bites, wasn't too fond of the cheese sauce though.  For dinner my fiance had the mac and cheese burger. It was not bad, very messy since the mac and cheese is just spooned over the burger. But overall he liked it. I had the chilli burger. Very messy but was very tasty. Had a nice little kick to it.  Overall it was a good experience and I would go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york

James L.,"Lancaster, PA",147,15,23,3.0,5/13/2017,"Okay, so. Every time I drive past this place after I spend way too much money at the mall, I find myself singing the little jingle from the commercial and end up stopping for a burger and some onion rings. But when it comes down to it, Red Robin is just another chain restaurant with decent burgers (and really good onion rings). I typically always enjoy my visits, but it's nothing over-the-top.  Recently during a visit, my friend and I ordered the chips and salsa/guacamole, and the portion size was honestly miniscule. I don't advise ordering this if you plan on sharing -- I understand that the majority of Americans are overweight, but good lord. I suppose this is made up for with the concept of bottomless fries, if your server asks if you'd like more...but typically I forget that I can get more with no charge. Oh well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york
Michelle K.,"York, PA",29,21,8,1.0,1/22/2017,"At work and ordered for 3. Congratulations 0 outta 3 right. First went to pick up and was told to sit at the bar... once there I was asked if I wanted to place an order. No I am here to pick up, O OK then. Got back to work  1) onions, didn't ask for them, no ketchup, mustard or pickles which were ordered. 2) ordered American cheese got provolone, got sweet pickles that weren't ordered. Well done is pretty pink. 3) ordered well done also pretty pink.  I'm now left with the question of why are they still open???? Not going back and we work at the mall right next to it.  SMH",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york
Jeff K.,"Mount Wolf, PA",55,371,35,4.0,5/1/2016,"I've recently relocated to the area and tried out this Red Robin out the other day. I would mostly eat at the Towson location which is certainly hit or miss... THE GOOD... -found parking easily -restaurant appeared clean -much nicer inside vs other Red Robin's I've eaten at -David the server was friendly, attentive, accommodating and just an overall terrific waiter -order came out exactly right -as always, buzz sauce is my favorite -drinks were refilled without asking -refilled French fries which came out hot -bathroom was clean BAD... -upon first arrival it took hostesses a bit to acknowledge  -upon exiting restaurant none of the hostesses said anything Overall the meal and service was a nice change compared to previous experience at Towson location. Everything was pretty enjoyable with the exception of the hostess stand...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york
Mike B.,"York, PA",0,3,3,1.0,3/30/2017,"I don't yelp.  I don't write reviews.  I've wanted to, but I'm typically too full to write.  However, my most recent experience was so abysmal I have to do something.  They refused to sing for my daughters birthday.  The soup was so salty, my arteries hardened like i sucked face with Medusa herself.  Salad had no dressing.  Shrimp tasted canned.  Tequila in a Mai Tai... wha?  Esqueeze me?  Charged us for kids drinks 'cause the server chose to bring them out in big glasses to make her job easier. I pinched my arm in the crap tables.  Tomatoes on the burger which when it was requested not to.  Yumm?  Nope.  Glumm.  My daughter is still crying.  I haven't even begun to crap my food out... or whatever that was... cause that will be a show.  A disgrace to the franchise.  Our server should go into the kitchen and throat punch some mofos!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york
Dave B.,"York, PA",8,34,84,5.0,8/2/2017,"My family loves Red Robin! They are one of our more favorite dine-in establishments. I like the decor (for some I can't stop staring at their pics on the ceiling), & I like the dim lighting. It is a casual, relaxing atmosphere. The prices are reasonable for what you get. We always get the old reliable deep fried pickles & pretzel bites for appetizers. The tangy dipping sauce complements the pickles well. Their burgers run between $8.00-$15.00 with the majority over $10.00. You get bottomless fries with your burger. The burgers are juicy, with several types to choose from. I had some type of onion burger ( I am bad at remembering particular names of food dishes) with sautéed onions, cheese, lettuce, & a Parmesan garlic glaze which was tasty without being too overpowering. The fries are always nice & crispy with several dipping sauces to choose from. They also have premium dipping sauces you can get for $0.75 apiece. I tried some type of Thai sesame dipping sauce for my fries; it was just the right mixture of heat & sweet. I have enjoyed every burger I have tried at Red Robin's. Yum.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york
Rob F.,"Marietta, PA",5,6,,1.0,9/6/2016,For one there was hardly anyone in the place so we were sat right away and ordered our food 45 minutes later I asked the waitress if our 2 burgers were done and she brings them out and throws them on the table and walks away we only saw her maybe two times during the whole service and of course The fries were cold and burgers were cold  we grab the manager and informed him we were not eating and he said sorry and we left worst time ever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york
Alex W.,"Stewartstown, PA",8,59,,1.0,10/25/2015,"Last time we came here it was a mess. Food was cold, service was slow. We figured they were new and challenged a bit. It happens.  Flash forward over 8 months later... No better. Service is still horribly slow. Ordered a cup of soup with dinner at 07:00p. At 07:11p our burgers arrived. No soup. Waitress offered to get soup. It comes out... Cold.  Okay. Enough is enough. Manager comes out. Offers all sorts of comps. Not interested. Just get rid of the cold soup and call it a day. We are not here trying to get freebies. Just decent food and service.  The burgers are great. Too bad they can't seem to get their service act together.  Note: Not that packed. Plenty of open tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york
Tim H.,"Silver Spring, MD",151,419,187,4.0,8/25/2015,"Great service, good food and a clean bathroom.  The wings are tasty and the onion ring tower with dipping sauce is dynamite. I got the Royale burger. It has a sunny side egg on top and when you bite into it the yolk just oozes all over the burger. It sounds weird but it is awesome! If you've never had a burger with a fried egg on a burger you are missing out and you need to try it. I got my burger with a side salad. I had to have something healthy to balance out the wings, onion rings and the burger besides the diet coke right?  Thanks for reading my review. This review is based off of my personal experience and opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york
Corey B.,"York, PA",0,2,,1.0,5/14/2016,"This place is horrible. Most of the staff is standing around doing nothing while the restaurant is disgusting! I have been here 3 times. Two of them I walked out before eating and the other time the meal was sent back to the kitchen. To make matters worse, the managers have no idea what they are doing, how to manage staff, or deal with customers. Stay away!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york
Jenipher K.,"York, PA",6,23,1,3.0,4/27/2016,"My burger tasted burnt. The waitress wasn't very friendly, the few times she did come over she asked how everything was and the left right away, didn't even get a chance to ask for anything that I wanted. The dessert was delicious, I got the mountain high Mudd pie. I did notice trash between the booth and the wall that grossed me out, so they need to clean better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york
Julie S.,"York, PA",0,4,,2.0,11/30/2014,"The management and staff were very unorganized. When the hostess went to seat us, they took half of the table from guests already seated to provide us with seats despite several open tables. We then attempted to order an appetizer from our waitress who directed us to the on table tablet, which did not contain that item. We pressed the button to call her back, but she did not return despite stopping at our neighbor's table. The manager then had the hostess seating customers solely at the bar, hip to hip filling every seat. Again, with 4-5 open tables directly behind it.  We paid our bill on the tablet, as directed by the waitress, after which they came to clear the table although we had not finished eating.  The food was decent - what you would expect for Red Robin. However, their staff and management could use some help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york
Nina E.,"Berkeley, CA",129,15,5,3.0,2/9/2015,I was so excited to try this place-after years of seeing advertisements I was finally able to visit and it wasn't as great as I thought it would be.  I had the Royal Burger and it was so delicious--I ate this with unlimited waffle fries and beer cheese. It was so good! The other person I was with got the blue cheese burger and he did not enjoy it. They were kind enough to not charge us for the burger which was nice of them. The service was okay--not the best because they now have tablets at every table where you can order your food and have it sent straight to the kitchen. This resulted in a lack of personal service. The tablet is perfect for kids though...  Not only can you order from it you can play games on it. I would imagine this would be perfect to entertain the kids on a date night out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york
Stephanie H.,"Jacobus, PA",0,28,4,1.0,1/28/2015,"Waited for a table for about 20 min. Not bad Waited forever for drinks and even longer for napkins. Food tastes horrible.

Elizabeth L.,"Durham, NC",14,12,8,5.0,12/21/2014,"Really fantastic meal at Red Robin! Food was prompt, hot and delicious, and the new ZIOSK machines made it so easy to order appetizers and pay: fantastic innovation on the part of the owners. Our server Dave was excellent at handling detailed orders for our large party, and he kept the kids happy with drink refills; he could guess what we needed before we asked. Great environment, brightly-lit and family-friendly, with the more upscale adult bar area sectioned off. Highly recommended and will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york

Corrie H.,"York, PA",338,10,,1.0,10/17/2016,"This was the worst experience from a Red Robin that I have ever experienced.  We were seated in the bar area, a group of 6 of us, and it was about 10-15 minutes before we were even greeted by a staff member to take our drinks.  The funny thing about 6 or 7 staff members were crowded around a booth doing absolutely nothing.   We placed our order, and when the order came out 2 of the 6 orders were incorrect.   The one order was sent back because there were items on the burger that was requested to not be included.   It was not even 30 seconds and his new burger came back out, and it was just the same sandwich with everything he didn't want scraped off, i mean they left lettuce on it easy catch.  This was downright unacceptable as a customer and should not be allowed from the chain.  The manager brought the new platter finally, was not apologetic, and was very inexperienced as a manager.  Our second problem was the other parties, sandwich was way under cooked, I mean it was bright pink in the middle.  This establishment of this chain has not even been open 3 years and already has a poor rating, and continues to decline.   The manager needs to understand your staff cannot just sit around and do nothing, and you cannot be a manager who doesn't care about the customer, i hope he reads this or someone does because it is a great way to be put out of business.   A chain as high caliber of advertising should not be dead at 6pm in the evening.    I guess we should of thought about that before eating here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york
Debra F.,"Hanover, PA",0,10,,1.0,12/11/2015,"I was there last night with a friend. The service and food were not very good. The water for the tea was cool, the burger bun was cold. It took a long time to get hot water for the tea and a knife and spoon. a server told us that they ran out of knives of why it took so long. We had to ask for sugar lemon and cream for our teas,  Our original server sent over other staff to handle things.  They only took tea off bill. We should've gotten free meals. The only thing that was good were the onion rings.  We didn't leave a tip because the service was poor. Management is poor too.  I doubt I'll go back! My friend and I were very disappointed!

Kari K.,"Seven Valleys, PA",0,4,,1.0,8/23/2015,I don't want to give them a star but I hit it by accident and now it won't erase. The staff is slow. I got asked to leave by management because some woman complained about me taking my daughter to the restroom when she threw a temper tantrum. She threw her food on the floor.

Jeff T.,"York, PA",0,1,,3.0,3/7/2015,"Overall a good restaurant, but missing a few things to make it a great restaurant. Delicious burgers, love the chili fries, and an awesome environment. The only major downside is the wait staff. Being that it is a small place and always busy they sometimes rush you to bring another party in.

I ordered the mushroom & Swiss burger with fries and mac & cheese. However, i never received the mac & cheese and i had forgotten that i ordered it till i seen the bill. I talked to one of the managers that were walking around and told him about it and he was super nice and took it off the bill for me. My SO ordered the keep it simple burger with fries and a side of the ghost pepper sauce. He liked the burger and fries, but the sauce was not hot at all, sorta tasted like ketchup.

Kathy G.,"San Antonio, TX",3,16,,1.0,11/22/2014,"I've eaten at Red Robin's in the past with mixed reviews. Although this particular location just opened today, I'm already disgusted with it. My daughter and I stopped for lunch. First, the parking lot was a madhouse. There were cars pulling in, cars leaving, and cars trying to find a place to park. We attributed it to their grand opening, everyone wanting to try it. We assumed there would be a wait and were willing to, but that wasn't the case. The reason there were so many people/cars mulling around it that word was they were open, they were actually only open for those who happened to hear that you needed reservations. That's right, a Red Robin that required reservations. A manager told us that they advertised that fact in the newspaper (like anyone reads the newspaper since the onset of the internet) and they had (past tense) a sign out front. There was no sign when we were there. Red Robin is casual dining, nothing fancy about it. It would never cross ones mind that a place like that would require reservations at any time, never mind at a time when the entire city believes they are having their grand opening. Poor management? Lack of foresight? Or just a plain stupid idea. We were even there at the right time to witness a minor fender bender due to the poor planning and cluster*** in their parking lot.  Not a good beginning for a mediocre chain....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york?start=20
Ashleigh K.,"York, PA",0,2,,4.0,10/4/2015,"I went here for the first time last night after a late-night shopping trip. The food was pretty slow to get to the table, but my drink was enough to buzz me along. Our waitress was absolutely wonderful and accommodating, often asking us if we needed anything else/had any questions about the menu without reaching the territory of being annoying. My burger was solid and the sweet potato fries were just right, so I have nothing to complain about! I wasn't absolutely blown away, but I feel like this would be a solid spot for a dinner out (or at least for a round of drinks) provided it isn't too crowded.

John S.,"York, PA",0,84,,2.0,7/27/2015,"Have been here 2 times now, and not willing to give them a 3rd try.  First time, went with the family for burger night.  New place, thought we'd give it a try.  2 of the 4 of us ordered what they called ""bunless"" burgers in the menu (described as coming in a lettuce wrap).  Sounded interesting, so we ordered burgers that way.  Burgers arrived, and they were simply plopped on a plate.  The waitress dropped them off & took off so quickly I could not even catch her to ask about the ""bunless"" burgers.  Tried to catch our waitress to flag her down, but could not.  So after 5 minutes or so, finally had to get up, go looking for our waitress, but found a manager instead.  He came over to the table, agreed with me that ""bunless"" is supposed to be in a lettuce wrap, and took the 2 plates back to the kitchen.  About 5 minutes later, our waitress re-appears with the burgers now wrapped in lettuce, and proceeds to tell us that we did not order them properly.  She lectured us on the difference between bunless & lettuce wrapped.  I told her to check what the menu says, and left it at that.  Later, she came by to apologize, which I appreciated.  However, the service was really lousy - the wait staff was scarce, and nobody came around to check on beverages, bottomless fries, or anything.  We were not impressed.  But I did go back a second time, to give them another chance.  This time it was just me, so I went to the bar & had a beer.  While at the bar, ordered wings & another appetizer.  The food was fine.  The bartenders were very attentive (I'm sitting right in front of them, so hard not to be).  I really cannot complain about the service that I received on my second visit, but I did find out why the table service in the dining area is so bad - the waitstaff all hang out back by a servers station near the bar.  It's tucked out of sight of the dining area, near the kitchen, and there had to be 6-7 wait staff just hanging out talking about plans for the weekend, etc....  I wanted to walk over and tell them to go take care of their tables, but the manager did not seem to care as he walked by them, so why should I?  As a customer, I'll pass going to this place.  For the money, you can get better food & better service elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-york?start=20
