Ken S.,"Yokohama, Japan",212,121,638,4.0,3/20/2017,"T.G.I.Fridays in Japan are generally a good bet if you're craving something ""American"". That goes for taste, portion and atmosphere, and in the best possible way. This is based on quite a few trips to this branch in Minato Mirai/Sakuragicho in Yokohama. They have a great lunch menu during the weekday. My usual dishes are the Taco Rice, Friday's Lunch burger and the friend chicken salad option for lunch, but my all time favorite on their regular menu is their Chipotle Yucatan Chicken Salad. But that said, I'm pretty sure most things on their menu are pretty tasty. ---------------------------- Details Value: (4/5) Menu/selection: (5/5) Quality: (5/5) Service/staff: (5/5) Ambiance: (5/5) Value If you're looking for cheap grub, this ain't the place, but rest assured you'll get a good portion of good food. And the price isn't bad, it's fair for the quality you get.  Menu/selection Well-rounded selection of burgers as well as other staples of ""American"" bar/restaurant standards. Burgers, ribs, steaks, wings, tacos, ginormous salads, nacho supreme... Oops, scratch the nacho supreme. They're not on the menu, but should be considering they offer nachos with guacamole, not quite the same though, and I know I'm often craving some good nacho supreme with cheese, salsa, chili... You know what I'm talking about... Anyways, yeah, they should have it, but I'm not going to take away any stars, they do a decent job overall.  Quality Top notch quality food every time I've eaten there.  Chipotle Yucatan Chicken Salad is my fave but I think everything I've had here was always fresh and great tasting. And photogenic. ;) Service/staff The staff here (and other locations in Japan) always seem friendly, attentive, and friendly.  Always a pleasant experience dining at T.G.I. Fridays. Ambiance The atmosphere and energy of this restaurant screams "" 'Muricaaaa!"" to me, and I love it. Living in Japan, we often need a small slice of home.  So, if you're craving a satisfying meal in Japan, that reminds you of the good stuff back home (if you're from the U.S.A), you might want to check out T.G.I.Friday, any location and of course, not just Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-%E6%A8%AA%E6%B5%9C%E5%B8%82
