Willie W.,"Albany, NY",64,104,5,2.0,6/18/2010,"Familiarity breeds contempt. But then, after an awkward period, its OK again. That's kind of how it is with Fridays.  You do not walk into a chain restaurant expecting something different. Chances are you know what you're going to eat before you walk in. You expect things to be pretty much as they were the last time you were in a Fridays, it doesn't matter which one because they are all pretty much the same. The wife picked me up from work and wanted to get something quick to eat. We were going to go to the 99, but the traffic at the turn annoyed me so I drove passed and into Stuyvesant Plaza. We wanted something quick and easy, neither of us felt like thinking. Its easy, its quick, and you know exactly what to expect. They now have the calories listed for everything on the menu right next to the item. I understand the purpose, but I really cannot stand looking at it. I know when I am eating junk, do I really need to be reminded? I am going to get whatever I decided on as I was walking in, you don't need to make be feel bad about it. Its not doing either of us any good. Less than $20 per person, with a cocktail each. In and out in 40 minutes. And really, that's just about the limit you can spend in a place like this without getting a little stir crazy. As we were leaving I started to question my sanity going here on a Friday, the place is packed with people looking to enjoy some happy hour. I almost miss the days that I looked forward to such things... And I took a photo of the front of the building. Lets be honest, a photo of the greasy fried food isn't really making anyone happy. You know you're going to eat it anyway while you're there, just like seeing the calories on the menu, why remind me...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2?start=20

John H.,"Schenectady County, NY",12,2,,2.0,11/8/2013,"Not pleased...and I'm easy to please. 1/2 hour wait prior to being seated (no biggee), friendly service, and orders taken pretty quickly. First appetizer (mozzarella sticks) came quickly, but there was hardly any cheese inside the large rectangle of fried bread. Next appetizer - which took longer than the Mozzerella sticks by about 15 minutes - French onion soup, was actually burnt. The rim and surface of the cheese was charred black. A little over 45 minutes later, the entrees came. The stacked burger was okay, but not nearly as appetizing as advertised. The sirloin was similar. The kids didn't finish their meals - another (under done) burger, and chicken tenders. The only things I'd say were tasty were the fries. This is my second trip to TGI's in ten years, and at their prices I won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2?start=20

Jess P.,"Santa Cruz, CA",79,380,,1.0,2/20/2009,"My boyfriend's mother lives alone and doesn't really go out to eat. Yet for some reason, people (I'm guessing co-workers) are always giving her gift certificates to weird places like Friday's. She usually gives them to us and then we spend the bulk of them on drinks. I mean, really, what else is palatable here? This location seems particularly full of douche bags. The other night, I saw one of the best mullets I've ever seen. Seriously. That baby was long, black and curly. I was kind of in awe. There's also a plethora of what I would refer to as ""dudebros."" You know the type.  I haven't been to one of these places in a long time and I was amazed at just how much food you can serve fried. Fried ravoli filled with pulled pork? Fried mac n' cheese bites? Fried green beans? Wow. Does the TGIF company have a secret deal with Pfizer? I'm almost amazed they don't sell deep fried salad.  My boyfriend decided to try to chicken parm sliders and the aforementioned fried green beans, which he said weren't as bad as one might expect. That said, my Cobb salad was perfectly fine but I also think it would take a very unique brand of moron to screw up a Cobb salad. (Maybe some deep-fried croutons would have done the trick?) We also had two Lynchburg lemonades and two ""ultimate Long Island iced teas."" I'm not exactly sure what made them ultimate.  Bottom line: Go here if you're trying to kill yourself more quickly by way of clogged arteries - or if you're just really into masochism.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2?start=20

Albany C.,"Albany, NY",0,2,5,1.0,12/26/2017,"Positives:  Staff was friendly, cutlery was wrapped. Negatives: High chair had a broken safety belt,  bacon did not cover more than 2 bites of sandwich,  spoiled tasting mozzarella,  cutlery did not look clean,  chicken was over cooked and hard. This is not the 1st time I had poor quality food at this location and will normally avoid this restaurant because of it. For starters they had the cultery covered with a napkin which is always nice to see, because you know its clean.  But when opened, it did not look clean. Sometimes rinsing agents in dishwashing machines can do this, either way it is not appealing to use a fork that looks like this. The mozzarella tasted spoiled, and the chicken was way over cooked. On my sandwich there was a tiny amount of bacon. In a restaurant chain like this everything should be standardized with portion control down to how much bacon to put on a sandwich, and it should cover every bite of the sandwich. The staff solution to the food was to return it to the kitchen and just place a different order. We were charged the full price which is fine but most places try to add a positive when they made a mistake and created a negative. When a customer leaves with more negatives than positives it is unlikely that they will return. Complaints like this should always be brought to a manager's attention so that they can oversee how it is handled. Especially relating to something that tasted spoiled.  A manager should want to get some basic information in case the customer gets sick off of the spoiled food.  My experience with this T.G.I. Friday's has been below what I would consider standard for food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2
Thomas N.,"Albany, NY",110,64,19,4.0,6/12/2017,"I am so tired of places like TGI Friday's and other similar establishments getting a bad review. I always chalk it up as you are going to get what you are paying for, and also don't expect a fine dinning experience at a chain restaurant price. With that being said, here it goes...  Jughead and I went here on Saturday for an early dinner as we had plans later that evening. If you know anything about Jughead, you won't be surprised that this is the site (this exact location) of our first date back in 2012. Since then, we have come back a few times and have NEVER been disappointed. And honestly, for the way this place gets busy on most nights of the week, I am surprised that there are any bad reviews.  The Food: Well, we started with the Bavarian Pretzel with Beer Cheese, and was brought four ENORMOUS pretzel sticks that were pipping hot, and a delicious concoction of cheese, bacon and scallions to dip it in, how could it be bad? Well, it wasn't, actually a side was ordered to dip french fries/potatoes on later. Jughead got his usual, a cheeseburger because that boy lives on them. The waitstaff was very accommodating when he asked if there was any way possible he could switch from french fries to mashed potatoes as a side to his burger because he was in a mood for them. I went for their flat iron steak (with garlic parm butter) and half rack of BBQ ribs). Everything is always cooked to the request being made (rare for me/medium rare for Jug), and it always tastes good. The only thing I noticed was that the steamed broccoli (always good, never seems frozen) was 18000 degrees...  The Staff: We have always had the nicest servers when we go here. The only attitude that I have EVER seen was from the head hostess to her staff, and we all know that we can ALL be a little stressed at times. I believe our server on this occasion's name was Jillian, who was more than ready to help, give us an appropriate amount of time to ask how our food was from the time we received it, and was ready with refills before the glasses were even empty.  Like I said, are you going to be ordering pate frois gras here? Nope, you are going to get basic standard food, that I am sure you can get at their competitors as well, but here you have pretty great service, a well lit (except for one table) restaurant, and a decent amount of food for the price you pay. The only thing I would suggest avoiding, is the endless apps, and only because if you are getting those with food, you really don't do endless because the rest of the meal will fill you up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2

You know something is wrong when the protein portion of the meal, here chicken ,looks like a left over from last week and simply re hated in a microwave not even in a pan... Add to this old salad and canned mandarin orange slices  and cranberries that were also very old all stuck together...this probably was my mistake since the place is known for burgers and fries which is what everyone was gorging on but fried food and grease is not something I enjoy.

Seating was quick, however my husband and I was seated at a large round table which were unable to be social. We requested to be moved and we were to a more intimate seating setting. We both ordered the endless apps. Be AWARE theres a fine print... Yes you may order different apps but the first one you order is full and the rest are half size and they have to be ordered in 20 min increments according to our waiter. Don't try the fried pickles they are slimy and yucky. Our waiter tried his best to be attentive but he was definitely  having a bad evening. People behind us was cussing him out. Which resulted him forgetting about is it took 25 mins to get drinks and I'm unsure if mine had liquor in it which I did order the Long Island ice tea. If you decide to go to Fridays perhaps try Monday - Thursday. I was a bit disappointed and will never ever order endless app because I only had 1.5 orders they took long.

Nancy S.,"Cohoes, NY",188,183,79,1.0,12/8/2014,"Do yourself a favor and DON'T GO HERE unless you want to kill yourself with deep fried, dirty crap. I used to frequent this Fridays location as it used to be a spot that was always reliable and satisfying. My experience tonight totally changed that and I will never be back.  The meal started off promising, my sister and I ordered drinks and an appetizer, and that was fine. My sister then ordered the Jack Daniels chicken sandwich, and I ordered what I always do, the Parmesan crusted chicken which is always a safe and yummy choice. First off, the entrees took forever to even come to the table, which was no fault of the servers, but once it did is when everything went downhill for me. Another server brought out our meals, and I was perplexed at what was on my plate. The piece of chicken I got was probably 3 inches big, and was dark brown, almost looked like a baked potato rather than a moist piece of chicken. This chicken is typically coated in a marinade and coated in a parmesan ""crust"" as the name would suggest. This chicken was overcooked to the point that my fork couldn't puncture it without extreme pressure. The only parmesan on the chicken was a few sprinkles on the top of the chicken. I'm not usually one to complain, but I couldn't fathom actually paying to eat something that looked so pathetic. I brought my concerns to our servers attention, and he graciously took the dish back to the kitchen.  Shortly after, the manager came over to the table and asked ""so you didn't like your meal"". I was actually really annoyed that this was even a question. Had she actually looked at the dish, she should have noticed that serving something that looked so awful should be unacceptable. She asked if I wanted the same dish, and I said yes if it would be better. She couldn't make any promises. Right... Meanwhile, my sister has completely finished her meal, and about 20 minutes later, a new one comes for me. The chicken is somewhat better, but nothing to rave about. Acceptable. While I was eating, I also noticed how completely filthy the glass that my soda was in was. To the point where I think I may have gotten a dirty dish.  We received the bill, and I noticed that the disgusting meal was not removed. I was not going to make an ordeal out of it, since I wasn't looking for a handout. But, I just know I will never go back to Fridays again. At least not that location. The quality of the food and the ambiance is not worth it at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2

Jeff S.,"Bucks County, PA",569,1716,407,1.0,9/2/2014,"We decided to have a quick lunch here because it was easy for some of our party to get to. I saw the Yelp reviews beforehand but was outvoted, so...what can you do? First impression? Really dirty. Flies on the window. greasy/slippery floors, filthy high chair, and a very neglected baby changing station. So right off the bat, I'm hating this place.  Service was prompt and we got our food in about 10 minutes. I went with a lunch combo that included an avocado club sandwich, fries, and a Caesar salad. The sandwich was okay, at least the filling was anyway. The avocado and bacon were fresh but the roll was spongy. The fries were tasty but lukewarm when we got them, and the salad was an uninteresting throwaway which was 95% lettuce. Someone else picked up the tab for the lunch so I don't have to regretfully feel like I wasted money on crap. But still, the entire experience of sitting and eating at TGI Friday's completely sucked.

Katie M.,"Cohoes, NY",1,10,,2.0,10/11/2015,Have s tendency to frequent this place more than I like. Went for dinner with 4 other people. Food is what's expected typically only ever get a burger or chicken fingers. Apps are ok.  This outing I opted not to get a $12 drink that is basically grocery store mix and I hate that drinks aren't labeled with price too. Service wasn't awful but not great. I had to flag down waiter for a soda refill. After he'd been to table and my glass was empty. Also one in our party ordered endless apps and he was not so on top of that either.  The issue with this particular visit is people were leaving because there was so many empty tables but not being sat. My friend heard the host say that they couldn't sit people because didn't have staff to service tables. Umm that's not okay especially on a Saturday. You should staff your restaurant to accommodate the amount of tables you have. Luckily our wait was short because we met some friends who were extra early. There was at least 20 parties waiting to be seated. Unfortunately I'm sure I'll be back but it's never my choice to go there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2
Daniel B.,"Albany, NY",1471,793,1958,2.0,1/3/2010,"You walk into Friday's expecting it to be bad.  Then it turns out, it's not as bad as you had thought. It really makes me want to give it 3*.  Surely it deserves 2*.  But I'm starting to see the appeal of chain dining in this town. It is far less satisfying when you go to an independent restaurant expecting it to be good, and you get let down. For a restaurant with so many fried things on its menu, one would expect them to fry better. The fries and the onion rings were oily, and the fries were limp. Juicy Burger up the road, runs circles around Fridays in what they do wit potatoes and onions. The ribs were a bit under done.  The bone still came out clean, but the meat was difficult to cut with a knife.  The wife's steak was charred industrial meat, but cooked to the temperature ordered.  The kids pizza was dreadful, but he liked it. There was a surprising amount of fragrance used by the hostess and passing waitresses.  And that was uniquely unappetizing. I was encouraged to see that the restaurant now offers smaller portions of its gargantuan meals.  I was able to get a half rack of ribs, with lots of fried things on the side.  More than enough calories for a man of my size, I am sure. One last parting shot - the prices on wines by the glass are criminal. Overall, it was tasty. But I'm in no rush to get back there. Once every 15 years should do just fine.

Now, the place is a mess, the food is disgusting, the silverware is dirty and the management is terrible. The past few times I've been here, my food has been sub par, dry, tasteless and over priced. I dont know what theyre trying to do with their menu but its too expensive for some basic chain restaurant. Example; ""sizzling chicken and cheese"" costs 13-14 dollars. Why do two 3 inch chicken breasts, peppers, onions, mashed potatoes and a piece of american cheese thrown on top cost that much? I ordered this one time recently and had it sent back because it wasnt ""sizzling"" it was cold, and the cheese (which i found out is literally just a slice of american cheese thrown on top) wasnt even melted. i had chunks of warm cheese and the corners of the unmelted slice all over the plate. Dont waste your money ordering an alcoholic drink here either. 12 dollars for a drink that has maybe one shot of alcohol in it and the rest is juice. Id rather go to a local bar and get 3 drinks for that price. Even if the food was free I wouldn't come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-albany-2
