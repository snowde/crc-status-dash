Destiny P.,"Clinton, MD",0,12,5,1.0,4/8/2017,"Normally I come here and everything is great but their hosts are really not professional or attentive at all. We were told a wait of 40 minutes & it's been 40 minutes and when we asked how much longer for our table we were told  there were 2 people in front of us. So really our question was never answered. I'm pretty annoyed at this point because and the only reason I'm still here is because it took me 40 minutes to get here but honestly I would just not come here ever, it's not worth it I have half of mind just to go home because as the minutes go on I grow more frustrated with the lack of exceptional customer service.

Leonard F.,"Stafford, VA",0,1,,1.0,1/7/2017,The food came out warm. The drinks were not good. I've given this place multiple opportunities to redeem themselves. I'm convinced it's just bad.

Gregory M.,"Alexandria, VA",2,8,1,1.0,4/1/2017,"This place is very run down. Very slow service. The waitress was great once we got one but then our food came out at different times.   It's also very dirty with food on the walls and no apparent Manager on site.

Tables are dirty and stay that way, attitudes of employees are the worst part of the whole experience. Food was not well prepared, presented or flavorful. Fire alarms went off for 5-10 minutes.  Restrooms have received as much attention as the rest of the dining room. Awful...just like the other TGI Friday's locations I've been to across the country. The meal was free (Veteran's Day) but it wasn't worth the time or effort won't be back, free or otherwise. Poor display of appreciation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-5?start=40
Tyler A.,"Charlotte, NC",19,206,133,2.0,11/17/2015,"This Friday's is just meh. I would definitely not spend a dollar here.  In Charlotte (where I'm from), Friday's is the place to go. We never have issues. This location makes the chain look very bad.  Me and the boyfriend order two of their special drinks: one two punch rum and some apple whisky thing. They were amazing!!!! The food was pretty good too. Nothing to write home about but it wasn't bad either. The service is what really brings this place down. Our server had to be tracked down multiple times. We probably had to wait about 15 minutes before even placing our food order. We sat at a table in the bar area so there wasn't a lot of room on the table. We had plates from the two appetizers we received on the table for a while. The runners brought our food out and the busboys had to refill our drinks.

On Sunday afternoon my Girlfriend a I stopped by to have a drink and some appetizers.. we decided to have a seat at the bar, my experiences at the bar haven't been that Great to be honest.. on a slow shift I've waited like 20min for a drink or someone to bring me a menu! I had bartenders just look at me and go serve someone else just horrible! But, let me tell you, On Sunday we got 3 amazing bartenders Chaunte, Dylan (I didn't get the other bartender name) but they were just great .. Chaunte welcomed us with the biggest smile, she was very polite and honestly it made us feel welcome! Dylan came to check on us while Chaunte was with other guests and kept on asking if we need it anything. Great customer service!

Both times got there a little before noon, the place had maybe 2-3 other tables with people. Both times waited 15-20 minutes for waitstaff to take my order, and both times took 20 minutes to get my Cobb salad order. I will not be using my last 2 Groupons as the waiting time is really not worth the saving. 40 minutes for a salad, with maybe 6 other diners in the restaurant, I cant imagine how long cooked food takes?

Tom M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,1,,1.0,7/10/2017,"I have to say - I would be addicted to this place if the service was good. But it is absolutely the most horrific service I've ever seen anywhere in my whole life. I've sat at the bar and waited 25 minutes before I could even manage eye contact with a server. Two nights in a row! I wasn't alone. It was a disaster. Disaster. I then waited 50 minutes for my buffalo wings. The bar tender (who was all alone at a huge bar and apparently had to run all the food too) finally came around the corner with my wings and saw some friends and put the food down and walked over to her friends table and chatted for 10 minutes. Then when she came back to the bar she passes the place she out the wings down, completely forgetting they were there, walks by them straight to back behind the bar. I had to stand up and get the wings myself, then walk them to her and kindly ask: are these mine? They were. This is with every single customer in the place. It's unbelievable. And it's a pattern over many nights. I want to love this place so bad. I actually love the wings and see great potential - unbelievable!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-5?start=40

Dominique I.,"Northeast Washington, Washington, DC",57,33,198,3.0,8/18/2017,"Disclaimer: This review is about my dining experience on June 30th, 2017. I have came to this Friday numerous times and had great experiences. This is by far my favorite TGI Friday in the DMV area.  I always find a seat in the booths around the bar. I came around 6pm on a Friday. It was fairly busy, but I was able to immediately find a booth that was self-seating. Waited for about 3 minutes and a gentlemen asked had I had been help. Told him no he said he would be right back with me. Wasn't long til he came back with a menu and introduced himself as Sean. We were off to a good start.  I ordered buffalo wings and a side Caesar salad. To drink I tried the Peach Mango Slushie, which he told me was his favorite. My food came out in understand 10 minutes (++) . Must have been some miscommunication because I received a house salad with caesar dressing. Sean took it away and shortly brung me a Caesar salad.  My wing and salad was good! But how can you mess up on buffalo wing and a Caesar salad?!? Lol. Sean did come pass once to do a quality check but.. it after I had already finished the salad and half way through my wings. TGI Fridays don't know about the 2 minute / 2 Bite check back?! NOPE! My two friends and her son arrived about 15 minutes later. Sean came pass and ask was everything good to me and didn't even greet my friends. No eye contact or anything..like he didn't even see them. I said I'm good but my friends here may want something. What he thought they came to watch me eat? They order a kids chicken sandwich, Jack Daniels Chicken with Broccoli and Mash, and Garlic Parmesan Wings. For drinks they order the Strawberry Lemonade Slushie. We waited almost 15 minutes for NON-ALCOHOLIC drinks (--). We stopped Sean at Least three times asking about the drinks. He just kept telling us it gotta come from the bar. They had 3 bartenders and the manager back there, so I'm not understanding why crushed ice and strawberry syrup and lemonade is taking so long. After 15 minutes I approached the bar and asked the manager if he could get my friends drink immediately because their throats are parched. If it was going to take that long a good Server would have brung some water while they waited. NOT SEAN! The manager quickly brings us the drinks and let us know that it will be on the house.  Their food came out shortly after the drinks. I'm surprise the food ain't come out before the drinks. Everyone enjoyed their food. We asked for extra ranch multiple times. Sean would come back to check on us and we would have to ask again for ranch. Finally we would get it. Working in the restaurant industry, we kindly stacked our dirty plates to make it easier for him. He left them their and just kept passing by. I literally had to ask him can he remove the trash! (--) No Slushie refills. (--) The refills were free but Sean wasn't getting us any. One of my pet peeve... REFILLS ON DRINKS! So easy. We had to ask for another refill. The second round came out much faster the first. Which made me think homeboy just never put them in in the first place. We stacked more plates he allowed them to just sit on the table. I can't stand a dirty table.  The food was good, service was Awful. My food and service was good but my friend's service was TRASH. He started strong and completely loss me by the end of my night. Just dampened the entire experience. I would like to give a 2.5 star review but it's no half stars. I'm giving it three stars because I have had good service from other servers/ bartenders on other occasions.  Their cocktails are excellent. I always get the Long (Strong) Island or the Crown Apple Cooler. The Crown Apple Cooler is my bomb!!! But only at this location. I've been to the Fridays in DC and Suitland and hated them. They put too much syrup in theirs but not HERE! (++) Only other Fridays I ever considering going to is on King Street in Alexandria.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-5

While my girlfriend always makes fun of me for being such a huge fan of this restaurant chain, she can rest comfortably knowing that I'll never visit this location or any other in the future. We came in the other night and we're immediately sat in the bar area. We were passing by and sorting through the amazing amount chain restaurants along the highway. I of course being a fanatic of all things Fridays made a point to stop (much of the distain of my girlfriend). She was pretty hungry so gave into my request. We sat down, browsed the menu, decided upon what we wanted to eat and drink....and waited.....waited...and waited. We saw several tables getting served around us and in fact tried to get the attention of both servers and bar staff but of course to no avail.

The service is slow, they're always understaffed, tables are always dirty. It's just not worth the effort. They really had a great thing going for almost a year. Then... poof.  I appreciate that the chain has added a gluten free menu, and all day happy hour is AMAZING. The execution of it all has been spotty at best. I hope this place turns back around.

Most of the stars lost were due to extremely poor service.  Getting drinks and drink refills was a 10-15 min ordeal every time.  I actually got up from our table and got a refill from the bartender because the waitress has disappeared for a long time.   The time between the drink order getting our drinks and placing a food order was a solid half hour and getting our food  order to the table took another 30 mins.  I will say the food was warm and pretty much what we expected.   We made the movie in time but it was close.  My tip was 10% reflecting the service.  My family argued it should have been less but IMO the staff deserves something.  I truly don't know why our service was poor but there could have been a valid reason.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-5

(Seating time was normal) took another 15 minutes to receive a kid punch, kid apple juice & a sprite.  She asks us at the time if taking our drink orders if we want starters.  We'd had long enough to decide everything by then of course, given the wait.   No deluxe /complicated orders....  mozzarella sticks  Kid mac & cheese with salad, add on mandarin slices Kid chicken tenders & fries, add on fruit cup Rib eye, med. rare (came more rare) potatoes and broccoli.... simple enough....  We get our food, mines room temp, except the broccoli.... THEN we get our mozzarella sticks, cuz that's when we want our app... after our main courses...  We're ready to take things to go now, my 7 year old doesn't look so hot & upchucks his meal into his empty fruit dish, so we obviously didn't take the rest of his food home, he had about 2/3 remaining.   Felt completely fine after and Is in school as I type this, so I'm glad his body rejected it on the spot as opposed to a food poison filled weekend.   Waitress is aware, warned her when I covered his vomit with napkins so she'd be careful cause....ew.   Semi surprised to see his meal on the bill...   The ONLY thing the waitress was time effective on was retrieving payment, which I'd done on the app, which sounded like ""news"" to her.   Benefit of the doubt thoughts: someone in the kitchen called out and no replacement came in and that our server was new.

Paris B.,"Capitol Heights, MD",2,14,19,5.0,5/5/2016,This is my favorite Friday's.  Nearly everytime I come I get great service and the one time I did get bad service the manager made it right.  I guess my opinion is biases.  Yesterday around 3:15pm my son and I went here for a late lunch  and everything was delicious.  I got the $12 special a entrée with a drink.  My entrée of choice was the bacon crusted ribs with fries and a side of coleslaw. Those ribs were the truth.  They ever brought out a side of bbq sauce to put on top.  The drink I choice had been recommended by my server which was the peach long island which was worth every penny.  Just the right amount of alcohol.  I'm a light weight so it gave me a little buzz and what mom doesn't need a little buzz after a long day.   My son had the kids pasta with the marina sauce accompanied with mandarin oranges which he seem to enjoy.  He clean his bowls.   My experience was GREAT as it is everytime I come.  Thank you Friday's for always giving us a good experience,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-5?start=60

I showed my jump the line pass and was told that I would still have to wait, of that's the case then why send me a jump the line email like it matters. 2) we wait about 20 minutes it was 3 of us and we proceeded to the back of the restau6which was fine except it was like 5 empty tables there so I don't understand the wait. We ordered food and the server was great( can't remember her name) but she did a good job of greeting us and taking orders, we ordered apps and drinks and they arrived fairly decently the 1st round. Second round wasn't to good. We ordered more apps and drinks apps showed up but drinks never did.  The waitress comes back and says you all still haven't gotten your drinks yet. Nope so we order some food to take with us. I ordered my usually cajun chicken and shrimp pasta with no spice it comes spicy  ( didn't realize until I got home) but drinks came right as our food to go was ready.

Joanne V.,"Alexandria, VA",0,10,1,1.0,8/19/2017,"This Friday's has to be the WORST Fridays that I have ever been to. Came here with my mom tonight for dinner. We did not get any drinks or get introduced to our waiter until 45 minutes. When placing my order I let them know that I could go ahead and order desert for after dinner. Before our actual food was given to us, the first thing that came out to our table was my desert.. I told the woman that I did not get my food yet so why am I given the desert. Okay.... so at this point I should have been given a red flag. Another hour is gone by. My mother gets her order with the wrong sides. We told the waiter and she apologized and my mother was brought her sides AFTER she finished her food. At this point, my mother is done with her food and I still have not gotten my food. So it's been over 2 hours, my mother is done with her food. I was given desert but no food... after letting my waiter know 3 times that I was still waiting for my food, I still kept waiting and waiting. I then told them to go ahead and take it to go since my mother is already finished and has been sitting for at least 15 minutes. The waiter said she's so sorry and will have a manager come speak to me and apologize due to their kitchen being backed up... BACKED UP? How is it that tables after me were given their food but I haven't received mine. So no, they were not backed up. They just simply forgot my order. After all, waiting and waiting, a manager never came to speak to me though I never asked to speak to one. I was so tired and sleepy from waiting that I just wanted to pay and get out of there.

Waited for 10 minutes to be acknowledged by the bartender in front of me, only to have her look at me several times without saying a word. Eventually the guy next to me mentioned that I would have to flag someone down if I needed service because that's what he had to do. I had to ask another bartender to give me a menu and as he handed me the menu he asked the other bartender if she had me. He was friendly and cordial. But she did not speak to me after that either. She even cleared some used glasses from right in front of me and still didn't say a word. So this totaled about 10 minutes without her speaking to me. I left after that. I get it. I don't expect to go to Fridays and get pristine service. But of all the Fridays I've been to in the area this one has constantly and continues to be the absolute worst when it comes to basic customer service. It baffles me how other Fridays in the area seem to be fine but this one is consistently bad. It's tough because there are some good bartenders and waitresses there but the ones who are not good are so bad that they overshadow the decent folks and make you not want to come back.

Tiffy D.,"Washington, DC",46,88,153,1.0,1/23/2015,"Talk about an underwhelming experience. As someone who has an urban bias, I was hesitant to venture out into the suburbs, and especially for a TGI Fridays.! I let my co worker talk me into an after work happy hour here, and I was so disappointed.  Going in, I had low expectations. Let's face it, it's Friday's. I knew better than to go in requesting a Moscow Mule at the bar. Or to experience a perfectly cooked, succulent steak or burger. But when I saw a Strawberry Mule prominently featured as a new item on the menu, I couldn't help myself. I ordered it, and the bartender had no idea what I was talking about! Once he figured out that I wasn't making the drink up, he had to scramble to find the ingredients for the drink. They weren't even at the bar! About 5 minutes later, he finally made a passable drink.   I ordered a burger, which again, was passable. Will I ever go back here? Absolutely not.

Danielle M.,"Arlington, VA",96,8,,1.0,7/28/2015,"I went there with a friend on Monday night for their happy hour. I ordered a margarita and a soup and she ordered a cosmopolitan and an appetizer.  The margarita was disgusting. I'm usually not picky, but I couldn't even drink it. I told the waitress this and asked for a beer instead. The waitress promptly brought out my friends appetizer and I figured since I ordered soup, it would take a little longer to come out. About 35 minutes later the waitress asked if I got my soup and when I said no she said they ""must have forgot"" and brought out the soup a few minutes later.  Finally, without asking if we wanted anything else, she brought us out one check. As both of us wanted to order meals to go, we told her this and asked her if she could split the check. My friend ordered the same soup as I did and I ordered a burger. An hour and a half after we ordered our to-go meals they were finally brought out. When she did bring the separate checks over, she had still charged me for the margarita. At that point I didn't even bother saying anything because I just wanted to get out of there.  Don't waste your money. In theory, the happy hour prices are great but the drinks are disgusting and the service is terrible even when there are almost no other customers there.

Came here at noon and the place was nearly empty. Was seated right away. Waitress came within 5 minutes. She took our drink order and appetizer order. The mozzarella sticks were nice and hot and the shrimp and Cajun pasta was really good. I took two stars off because (1) the sprite tasted like carbonated water. There drinks should be checked before served to the customers and (2) the waiter was quite forgetful in terms of placing the correct number of plates on the table and not delivering food once in hand to current table she is serving and then proceeding to her other customers.

Aaron M.,"Alexandria, VA",444,144,9,3.0,4/17/2017,"With So Much Going On In the World...I could have used a little bit of Fridays....... Season 1, Episode 1 So, my kid won his T-Ball game. It was a tough match and I wanted to celebrate the win with him at a place that I thought would not only make him feel like he captured a victory, but a place where we could look back at the time when he spent a special moment with his dad. We decided on TGI Fridays. Now a few weeks earlier I came in late at night wanting French fries. I discovered that the bar tender was from my home town of Philadelphia and he treated me in a way that made me feel like I was Cliff or Norm in Cheers. I felt like it was my local hang out. I vowed to come back because who doesn't like to be remembered. I wanted my son to think that I would be remembered as well....and that is why we came. We both walked in and the hostess was very nice. She saw that we were headed to the bar area and told us to have a great time. My Son walked taller feeling that he would spend time at the Bar. Televisions screens displayed many sports. He was really enjoying the hockey fight, but hey, this wasn't a time for ruining our special time with Hockey drama. I ordered cheese sticks for an app and he just wanted Mac and Cheese. He insisted that it had to be Kraft. The waitress and I laughed at that. *Sigh* Kids.  We worked on our secret hand shake a bit more. Took some social media videos to let his mom know he was alright...and then...the strangest thing happened to our night. A bit of commotion......some attitudes being thrown back and forth from employees and one bar tender sat down with someone I could only assume was a manager who was typing on their phone and didn't accept an initial handshake from the bartender. *GASP* He got fired. Yup, it seemed that the employees and some customers were being dragged into the drama about a bartender who unknowingly served an older guest without checking ID. OH No! The Guest was a secret Shopper OH No! and voices were being raised...and some profanity laced in disbelief was heard. OH No! So my son is looking around at all the faces that were once happy...turning all of a sudden sour...with the façade of trying to keep up the once happy appearance.  The worst part is that since all the drama was spilling out on the floor...my cheese sticks were forgotten. Fridays has good food. No Doubt. But please understand...Most people don't come for the food. They come for the atmosphere and the PEOPLE. Firing people in the middle of dinner is not the best idea....especially since it affects the customers. My son asked me what was going on. I told him as simply as I could so that he would understand. ""See, that guy was just fired because of the in house rules of carding and he got a secret shopper, so instead of giving him more training, putting him on busboy duty or letting him go at the end of his shift, management made the poor decision to fire him without me getting my cheese sticks."" He said...""DAYUUUUM"" Just kidding...he did not say that. But please understand TGI Fridays. You work with people, for people, who come for other people. Try to take that into consideration. If I wanted drama...I'd eat at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-5?start=20

Shawn O.,"Alexandria, VA",0,6,,1.0,2/9/2017,After reading the last few reviews I guess I understand the 1 1/2 star average in 168 reviews...again 168 reviews. We had given up on here over a year ago after being at the very least there once a week. Prior to that there must've been a different management team as it was a far better run TGIF.  Well shame on us we went in....sat at the bar.....7 total in the bar....14 minutes for our order to be taken. Young lady was very nice w/personality.  She seemed to have regulars who were talked to and taken care of rather quickly.....as we waited. After ordering I watched her do everything else but make our drinks.....talk to regulars....check the computer 3 times....talk to her child seated just outside the bar.....after 10 mins of ordering we got our first drink.  I got another which was quicker. We did order two more which we never got. After 17 mins and her leaving the bar area coming back chewing food I went to her on the other side of the bar (where she was talking to someone who'd just walked in) to ask for our check...when she saw me she reached for glasses to which I said we were all set. All of this has to be attributed to training and management because she certainly had the personality to be very good. A mile down the street is Buffalo Wild Wings where the service far exceeds the food yet it's there where we went.

The hostess seated us quickly and the waiter brought drinks quickly. We ordered and waited over 30 minutes for our food. I ordered the steak skewers appetizer ,$7, for my lunch. Honestly it was the smallest appetizer. The 4 very small pieces of meat were tasty enough. The tiny amount of slaw was warm. I tasted it and it was warm and bland. Decided not to chance it so left it uneaten. My husband got the Pick Two for lunch. A bowel of chicken noodle soup and half a California club. The soup bowel was barely half full. The sandwich was fine and they included a handful of lukewarm fries.  Overall long wait for small portions of below average food.

Our experience today was nearly the same. It took over an hour to receive two drinks and two sandwiches.  I imagine my hamburger must have had to sit around waiting for the other order, as it arrived below room temperature. It also arrived not cooked to order and with tomatoes I asked to be omitted. It makes some sense that the service would be slow enough that my food cooled, but its surprising that they also got it wrong. It was, of course, not very good and not worth the wait/money, despite being a signature Jack Daniels dish.  My wife's experience in the bathroom was not something you want to see anywhere near food preparation. No toilet paper and a sink choked with paper towels.

Kat P.,"Alexandria, VA",17,19,,2.0,11/14/2014,"My friend and I decided to try TGI Fridays because we love watching football, and don't have NFL Network to watch the Thursday night games. Now to preface, we were totally aware we were going to a chain restaurant, and were not looking for gourmet food or stellar service. Well it's safe to say we weren't proven wrong. To start with, the main reason we went there was for the Thursday night NFL game which start around 8:30 pm. We got there around 8:05, and of the 10 or so TVs in the bar, none had the game on, not a huge deal as we didn't need to see the preshow. At about 8:20 we asked our server if the game was going to be turned on and got an ""of course the manger will be working on it"". 8:30 comes and goes with no football, by the time our server finally got the remote to turn one of the TVs to the game, 6 minutes of football game time were gone. They should get their act together if they tout their establishment as a place to watch the games, and there was literally no other sporting event on.  I had a $3 margarita, which was pretty terrible as it tasted just of bad bottled sour mix, and my friend's long island was no better. We switched to beer/cider pretty quick which were good (but hard to screw those up). Our food was good, not fantastic but as I said we weren't expecting gourmet. We had buffalo boneless wings, a Jack Daniels burger, and a brownie obsession for dessert; all 3 were clear plates by the end. Service was alright, our server was nice, but slow. I'm not sure if it was her or the bar but all 4 drinks took a while to get and it wasn't that busy. We had low standards for a chain restaurant, but definitely were turned off. Next time we are looking for a place to watch the game we will probably head to Chili's across the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-5?start=80

Patrick J. M.,"Alexandria, VA",645,12,45,1.0,3/19/2014,"AVOID THIS FRIDAY'S AT ALL COST!  Well, if you do go, you'll find out your 'cost' will be an absolute rip-off. This Friday's is located along the infamous 'Route One/Richmond Highway Corridor', so, that being said, people who live in this area don't usually find 'fine dining' anywhere on the strip, especially, though, at Friday's.   First of all, service at this Friday's is absolutely TERRIBLE!  We unfortunately dropped by the property on Tuesday evening, March 18, close to 9:30 pm. The restaurant part of Fridays was virtually empty, although the bar was somewhat full. Despite that fact, it seemed that they were somewhat overstaffed, with a lot of servers on the floor. Our server was completely and absolutely clueless, but she was polite. She seemed to be a bit 'out there', though, pensive, at best. We ordered boneless chicken wings, with barbeque sauce. The wings came out in a reasonable time, so there were no surprises there. But we both had ordered salads, which seemed as if Friday's might have had to go over to Outback or Chili's as they took almost 40 minutes to get to our table.  That said, both salads were AWFUL, and really not worth eating.  We both had chicken in our salads and it was overcooked, tough to chew, and lacked any flavor. The greens of both salads were okay, but they could or should have trimmed off a lot of stems.   By the way, the whole time we're eating dinner, in our plain view, were two servers playing grab ass with each other, one big guy with a slight beard, and one overweight server with tattoos. They couldn't keep their hands off of each other, with both of them passing by countless numbers of dirty tables probably from an earlier dinner rush.  Our overall experience at this mismanaged Friday's: WORST FRIDAY'S EVER! The lack of attention to detail makes me wonder why senior staff at corporate doesn't come in and fire everyone and retrain a new crew, or just shut the place down. As I mentioned, the management of this Friday's doesn't care about customers, and it shows. And, overall, corporate apparently doesn't care about this location, either.

William T.,"Alexandria, VA",1,139,,2.0,10/22/2015,"The cheap endless appetizers is a great deal! The burgers are pretty decent too. The food is good and is about 4 stars (as far as chain American casual restaurants go). However, service is lacking. My wife and I have eaten at this location a few times and never really had any issues. The last time we came here was several days ago. We were seated after a few minutes. The waitress was nice, but seemed to be overwhelmed. There was a group of people at the table behind us who kept complaining about the food and was constantly asking for things and just being loud. Our waitress decided to shift her attentions away from her other tables (include ours) to focus on pleasing the group. Of course this meant that my wife and I, and the couple of other tables around us were left with very slow service. We had to ask for refills, the check, more aps etc... whenever the waitress stopped by, and then these things took along time to arrive. Our main course took easily 45 minutes to arrive (we both ordered burgers), and another waitress kept coming to our table with other tables orders. weird. Our waitress was nice and apologetic for the slowness, but she did not improve and her service was slow to the end. She took forever to get the check, and  then took several minutes process it, and at one point I saw her (on the way towards our table with my check and card) stop and talk to the other servers for a few minutes. That got me a little angry, but I didn't say anything, just left the tip and went on our way.. So the meal was a mixed bag. On one hand the food was really good for this type of restaurant, and the endless apps were delicious, and the server was nice... but extremely slow. I will still come back here because the food is better than their nearby competitors, but they should improve their service.

N.R. M.,"Baltimore, MD",0,10,1,1.0,1/21/2014,"NO STARS!!!!!! I had had the worst experience of my life when I visited this Friday's yesterday. First the hostess finally acknowledge me and my S.O. standing inside the doorway, because she was talking to some guy standing against the wall behind her little desk.  I first thought he was her friend off the street or something the way he was dressed, but I noticed he had an earpiece (the kind the staff wears).  Anyway, not professional at all.  When she finally greeted us, she said the wait would be about 15 mins because they were behind on servers and getting the food out, so she gave us the option of sitting at the bar with the promise that we would be served and brought our food out very quickly.  Ok, so we find a seat at the bar at one of those tables, took damn near 15 mins before someone came over and said, have you been helped-ME, ummm, no.  I mean the place was moderatey full and there were several tables empty. The guy (who looked all of 15) asked did I need a menu?  I said, yes WE need menus.  He brings back one (1).  My so called server (some female) comes over and off the jump had an ATTITUDE. I wish I got her name so I could put her ass on BLAST, but since you're reading this you probably know who I'm talking about. She comes over to the table and immeadiately I see her chest with a tattoo across the top of it, she has on a black head wrap, fake eyelashes, and a JACKED UP attitude. Excuse me, this is your place of business, WHERE DEY DO DAT AT?  If you don't want to provide customer service, find a new line of work. She takes our drink order, 2 waters with lemon, one with mint and 1 raspberry tea.  How hard is that?  That took another 15 mins.  As she steadily serves and waits on everyone around us.  A third person finally brings the drinks over, minus the lemons and mint we asked for.  The raspberry tea was weak. We send the drinks back.  We sat there debating our next move.  We never got our water.  All the while we can see her over at the bar refilling other drinks and periodically glancing over near our table.  A third person (some other woman) finally comes over with the water, that still has no lemons.  My S.O. is pissed at this point.  Sent the drinks back, again.  Meanwhile, the young man, comes to take our food order.  He kept asking what sauces we wanted with the wings, and asking what else did we order,  because he (refused) to write the freaking order down. I hate when they do that, just write the shyt down already.   Sorry so long, but I needed to vent and get this review written.  Needless to say, we decided to leave and go over to Panera Bread.  We didn't even bother to tell them to cancel the order because no one ever came back to our table.   Go spend your money somewhere else because if you don't you'll be sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-5?start=140

Charlotte B.,"Alexandria, VA",10,67,2,1.0,4/4/2013,"This was my first and last time coming here. My boyfriend and I recently moved into the area and when we started looking for late night eats, we were pleased to find that with an incredibly short drive, we could have a sit down meal that came with service. We did get a meal, and service... sort of. When we first arrived the bar was full with customers, and there was no hostess to greet us. We flipped through the menu after five minutes of waiting to be acknowledged. We started to wonder if we were supposed to seat ourselves but the clipboard with seating charts suggested otherwise, so we continued to wait. Another five minutes passed, and we began discussing calling it a night when the hostess finally showed up.  We were seated off to the side and were told that our waitress would be with us shortly. What the hostess meant to say was - our waitress would be with us when she pleased (meaning, when she was done flirting with the four guys in the booth across from us). We each ordered a drink and then perused the menu.  Drinks came about ten minutes later while our waitress bounced back over to the guys who were taking advantage of the friends and family discount by ordering a continual stream of food. Finally we placed our orders, and after being asked to repeat the sides and how we wanted our steaks cooked (we were asked no less than three times as our waitress took our order by memory), we finally settled in and tasted our drinks. I ordered a ""specialty"" drink. A ""'punky"" cosmo that used cotton candy. The cotton candy did not completely mix in, so the drink was gritty, and had to be stirred often because otherwise it created a layer that tasted syrupy. I couldn't taste the pineapple or lime juice at all. Eventually, I diluted the drink by pouring it over a glass of ice water. Only then was I able to drink it.  My boyfriend's drink which was supposed to taste like lemonade, required a squeezed lemon to taste of anything but alcohol, and was not even on par with what you can purchase in a bottle. Neither of us finished our drinks.  When our steaks finally arrived, that was the last we saw of our waitress until she came to ask about desert and the check. Our steaks - 10oz ribeyes, were over cooked. We had asked for rare and medium rare, but they came out medium rare and medium. We decided that there was no point in asking to have them redone, and ate what we could. A third of his steak was fat and grissle, as was a quarter of mine. Sadly, the steak fries were the best part of the meal, followed by the slaw. The sweet potato fries and tomato salad weren't worth the effort. Suffice to say, neither of us were pleased with our meal or the service that we received. Including tip, we walked out the door $60 poorer, still hungry, and regretting our decision to not go grab a burger. I'm not sure what this place has going for it, but we wont be back.  Our search for a late night stop continues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-5?start=140

First time, in February, our waitress was slow in every respect; she took forever to show up to the table in the first place, then was very slow bringing drinks, taking the order, bringing the check... you know, all those waitressy things that in general are associated with good service and ultimately with a tip reflecting appreciation of same. Last night took it up a notch though. We were given our menus by the host and instructed to find a table we liked. This turned into searching for a table that wasn't littered with the previous diners' plates, napkins, and/or crumbs. Found a clean table, finally, then commenced to wait. No sign of a waitress anywhere. 15 minutes later the host walked by, avoiding eye contact, and when I gained his attention he said someone would ""be right with us"". 5 minutes later and nothing had yet happened so we walked out.

Got there, was told it was a ~30 min wait. Okay, sure. It's a little busy, and we were a party of six. No biggie. We ended up waiting for about 40 til one of my friends asked about our table, then they told us it'd be another 20. So, wait. You basically made us wait double what you initially told us? REALLY? Then, when we were FINALLY seated, it took us well over 20 minutes to even see someone that worked there wander close enough to our table (a manager) to ask why they haven't even swung by to take our drink orders yet.  As for my most recent experience, long wait time with plenty of open tables, server never came by, so my friends and I just left. Done with this place. It's a joke.

Not only have I worked in a restaurant, my sister has also managed many different TGI Fridays and the service here was absolutely terrible.  It all started with trying to get a drink. We ordered our drinks and it took the server at least 15 minutes for her to bring them to us. Then she walked away before we could order our food. It was another 10 minutes before she came back, that we were able to order. We ordered 3 appetizers and 3 entrees(2 for here and 1 to-go). The appetizers not only took 20 minutes to cook, they all came out separate, yet we ordered them all at the same time. When we received the appetizers, they were cold and we immediately sent them back. By the time the appetizers were finished being recooked, our food came out. There was another disaster in itself.  The waitress then only came out with one entree. She put it in front of us and walked away. The entree that came out was what we ordered, but the food was not prepared correctly. After waiting 10 more minutes, I finally flagged down the waitress, and let her know that the food was not what we ordered and we were still waiting on one other entree.  She said that she would fix the entree and check on the second one. She then came back to us and said that the kitchen is recooking the first entree and also stated that the second entree that we ordered, was no longer on the menu. At this point, I asked to speak with the manager. She came over and acted as though she did not care about the situation. So I told her to void everything on our check because we would not be paying for the food. The service was terrible and that we would not be coming back.

I also do appreciate a rotating menu, but sometimes their menu/specials rotate a little too much! Also, I don't know what was happening this one day (maybe a full moon?) but crazily the hostess was telling my party (there was three of us), we had to get on the wait list to sit in the bar area. Huh? Not a special holiday or weekend. So I get us on the wait list, twenty minutes later-still waiting, my friend thought maybe the hostess misheard us and assumed we wanted the dining room, so she decided to do what every chain allows, and go directly to the bar. She finds a bar table (no customers, but still had dirty dishes on it, she assumed someone must of JUST left) and sits down, then the manager comes to her and says that she was suppose to get on the wait list, but he's going to be nice to her and allow her to stay seated. So, given the dumb rule, she asks why is that set up that way? And his response was: well if you sit down without being on the wait list, then we don't know which tables to clean. Huh? So you don't normally clean the tables after people leave? Under his watch, nope! The entire time, our table had more dirty dishes than food on it. I think in his head, he really thought it was a good idea because as he elaborated: you might sit down at a table with dirty dishes on it and that table's waiter would assume they're yours even though he/she hasn't not waited on you within the hour (and common sense would not dictate that maybe you're a NEW customer) and because of those pesky dishes that should of been removed in the first place with or without someone sitting there, that waiter may not help you?

Unfortunately, on the Friday evening I went over, the only real action was a dine-and-dash group who skipped out by way of the emergency exit, thus tripping the alarm system.  But as I drank a delicious (and affordable!) Patron Cosmo Rita Shaker, I could tell that major shit had gone down here before.  Anyone could see that the staff had thousand-yard-stares and the security guards were ready for anything. The service here is brisk and efficient.  Depending on your level of sophistication, your enjoyment of the food may vary.  No matter who you  are, however, you will feel as though your presence really ""classens up the joint."" Be forewarned that the temperature here is meat locker cold - a technique which is typically used within the United States Prison System in an attempt to keep the inmates in a docile, sedated state.  You may want to bring a jacket no matter the season.  Also, you might be advised not to use the rest room alone.

So waiting longer outside with just my group this time waiting for a ""you kerrie"" a large group comes out the door and while they are walking out we hear this very loud hip hop music flow out of the doors. This group is only talking about how loud the music got and how they could not hear one another. Since I was down from New York to see friends and family on base we were going to dinner to catch up. Two people from our group went inside to see if the music was just loud around the bar and maybe the sitting area was a little farther away and you could hear yourself think. That was not the case. Keep in mind we are a group in our low 20s so for us to think the music was inappropriate (both in lyrics and volume) this should tell you something. We (very politely) asked the hostess if the music was going to stay this loud (or maybe it was just a requested song or something) the reply we got back went as follows ""uh yeah Saturday is dj night we don't turn that down"" I didn't know tgi Fridays had dj night!

Tigeristic T.,"Denver, CO",18,30,,2.0,2/23/2010,"I guess I should've gone on a Friday and not Sunday...but this had to be the worst Friday's I've ever been to. Now I don't hate Friday's as an establishment, they have pretty good drink specials in certain areas and the food isn't completely horrible...but this one could've been run by a one armed monkey and a rabid dog for a sidekick. I only stopped in here for drinks, as I walked in, the floor kept trying to claim my boots, there was seating available but I had to wait 5 minutes and throw out an ""excuse me"" to get help...oh and let's not forget the lady that kept starring at me and when I starred back, I got an eye roll...LOL! The bartenders were good at keeping the other guests entertained by flinging drinks in the air and across the bar...thanks for the beer shower! Oh and for some reason there was a wet popcorn smell...Still wanna go?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-5?start=180
marc c.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/13/2011,"This is the worst fridays I have ever been to. The service was terrible. Their staff is extremely rude with attitude and unprofessional.  While they are joking among themselves, your order is not being taking care. I would not recommend this place to anyone. In the end, I still ended up being overcharged twice on the same bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-5?start=180
JB B.,"Alexandria, VA",0,6,,1.0,3/25/2011,"Has anybody ever met the manager at this location?  I have been there many times and never seen him.  The service at this place is very slow.  Takes forever to get a drink, order food, get the food, and then get the check.  I tried to order to go just now but apparently the girl who answers the phone cannot figure out how to transfer a call to the bar.  White collar clientele will not feel comfortable at this place as it requires a security guard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-5?start=180
Joseph M.,"Northern, VA",28,238,3,2.0,2/18/2010,Not bad. Service was pretty good but the food was a little less then desirable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-5?start=180
Jodi P.,"Waldorf, MD",9,31,2,3.0,7/21/2009,Even at 12:30am on a Wednesday night (technically Thursday morning) me and the dh were able to catch a quick bite without any hassle. The server was cordial and attentive.  Ordered the California Turkey Burger which was okay...nothing special by far but filling nonetheless.  My dh had the Jack Daniel's Chicken (oddly reminiscent of Famous Dave's own Cajun Chicken sandwich); he was satisfied.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-5?start=180
Ray M.,"El Paso, TX",31,42,17,3.0,1/6/2009,"Yes, I know...it's Friday's and it's a chain, but I had a great dining experience here.  We showed up at 5:30pm, were promptly seated, and had a very attentive waiter.  The 5-cheese mac n cheese and cajun pasta were great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-5?start=180
Melissa G.,"Waldorf, MD",106,18,,4.0,4/19/2010,"I thought this was a great TGI Friday's! My husband and I went on Saturday for lunch. It wasn't busy. We were at Lowe's, got hungry, and stopped in to eat. The food is just like every other TGI Friday's. Personally I am not a huge fan but they have some decent items. The thing that made me want to write a review was the service. It was great! The server was informative,truthful and attentive. I asked her about their new chicken sandwich with green sauce and the Honey mustard chicken sandwich. She said her preferred the green sauce but the Honey mustard one was more flavorful and probably healthier. I went with the green saice just to check it out and she was right the other probably would have been more flavorful. The green sauce was more like cheese than a sauce but decent. They had run out of the texas toast the sandwich normally is served on and the manager came out and let  me know and offered a free dessert. The server followed behind to make sure we were aware and were ok orwanted something else, she too asked about dessert. I thought it was great that they apologized and offered solutions and made sure I was not dissapointed. GREAT service I will definitely be back. The service was much better than any other Friday's I had ever been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-alexandria-5?start=180
