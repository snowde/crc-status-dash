Larry M.,"Allentown, PA",0,12,,1.0,3/4/2017,"My step-daughter and three grandsons took me to TGI Friday's for lunch.  It was my first and last time there.  It took more than an hour from the time orders were placed until food began to arrive.  Several of the entrees were tepid or cold.  I had the Mahi-Mahi and Shrimp.  Both were dried out and tough.  Also everything had a peppery bite to it.  Is the pepper a distraction so one doesn't notice the other inadequacies of the food?  I now understand why, on a sunny but cold Saturday only about a quarter of the tables were occupied.  TGIF or otherwise, I won't return to the chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2?start=20

Gigi G.,"Germantown, MD",0,2,,1.0,8/1/2016,"terrible service!! i was in town on saturday, july 29th for a huge family trip to dorney park. we all drove down from md. After pouring all day we wanted food it was 13 of us waiting for a table. It took about 20 minutes. The first table we got was in a corner with no space to move, it was literally a box, the hostess didnt set up the table with menus, i did!! We were moved shortly after telling them there was no room. Finally, we get to a new table, it took our server 15 min to greet us with an attitude, he took our drink orders and we asked to put in our apps and he said no that he would come back so he could be organized. well he must of went on a smoke break because it took him 20 MINUTES TO RETURN WITH DRINKS!! we then got up and left. we spoke to the manager and he said ""well the drinks are there now!"" and didnt offer any service or anything!! the place is slow and horrible!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2?start=20

Stephanie K.,"Slatington, PA",18,71,39,3.0,1/23/2015,"This was my first time here in a while. I used the front of the line pass so we didn't have to wait for a table. I thought that was pretty neat. We decided to get a bar high top table. It worked out, my son (6) really enjoed the huge tvs and liked the big stools.  What I didn't like was the huge smudge/ sticky substance on my wine glass. I sent it back, they poured the same wine in a new glass. Came out just as dirty. (Pictures attached)  the appetizer was delicious, try the garlic bruschetta if possible. Prime rib sandwich was also very good. My son got the kids ribs and ate each of them. Our waitress never checked on us and that was very annoying. The restaurant was swamped though. I didn't understand why she had to take my phone to print off a coupon....

Food arrived barely warm. Pasta was too dried out and crunchy to eat. After attempting a few bites, I rearranged the slices of chicken on my plate and noticed the pink uncooked center.

She came over flustered as if we had been thrown on her (a table of five plus one infant.) Our drinks took another 15 minutes or more to arrive. It was like that all evening long.  She brought out chips and salsa a very long time after we were seated, an appetizer was completely forgotten, and the food came out cold.  The food was ok and our party seemed otherwise satisfied with it.

BD T.,"Germansville, PA",0,16,5,1.0,5/16/2017,"Was there Friday 5/12/17, place was packed. Got there at 7pm, After 15 minute wait(not bad), we were sat. Our server said the kitchen was jacked up tonight and expect a wait for food.  So we order a water and a iced tea.  After 15-20 minutes drinks came. Server then pointed out she try to get our food but, she said people are walking out, because the kitchen is still backed up. So we order sandwiches.  We see other tables getting appetizers brought with apologies. 7:45 still no sign of food and the restaurant is about 1/2 full. We ask whats up, server says trying to get our food, 8:00 pm I go to the hostess station to find 3 young ladies texting on their phones and having a good time. I ask to speak to the manager, she shows up 5 minutes later, I complain she apologizes but really doesn't seem concerned. Just total joke, by 8:15pm we leave in disgust. Definitely would not got back, maybe it was unique to that night, but when I emailed corporate, my return emails was....

Sharon C.,"Chicago, IL",426,382,29,3.0,8/23/2014,"The best part about this trip to Friday's was the unlimited appetizers, and that's about it. Our server was difficult to flag down and service, especially to start, was very slow, but she was good about replacing our waters and refilling our appetizers.  We ordered:  1. Potstickers: The sauce is sweet and interesting (definitely not Szechuan), but the potstickers themselves are bland with strange textures that definitely don't belong in a potsticker.  2. Loaded potato skins: I love these, but even I have to admit that we seemed to be getting a bad batch here. Excessively oily, and one of our potato skins had a huge black portion at the bottom (had it gone bad? I honestly don't know).  3. Boneless buffalo wings: these were particularly bad, even for T. G. I. Friday's - our second plate was half the normal size, and half shards of chicken encased in a completely disproportionate amount of breading.  Overall, if I go back, it will be because I'm starving and I'm planning to eat at least fifteen potato skins.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2?start=20

Vero C.,"Hamburg, PA",0,25,,1.0,3/17/2016,Disappointing... this place is just never consistent. I've been here 3 times in the last 6 months and only once could I say it was good.

No flavor of any kind, just grease. The prices are getting way outta hand too. Like $12 for an appetizer, $8 for dessert. The chicken and cheese which was always a safe bet, went up to $16.

Alex Z.,"Hamburg, PA",2,4,,1.0,2/18/2015,"I came here with several friends. I ordered a pecan chicken salad. Salad tasted just fine. A friend ordered the bruschetta chicken pasta which came dry. Girlfriend ordered the Jack Daniels ribs with a side of Mac n cheese. She got mashed potatoes instead of the Mac n cheese. We ordered an app which we never got. When telling the waitress about this, in a respectful manner, she rolled her eyes at us when walking away, thinking we wouldn't see it. When she came back, we asked for a manager. He gave us 50% off our order but didn't seem to care.  A lady who was the supervisor Saturday nights came to our table and asked how things were. We told here they were terrible. She seemed to care more than the manager and waitress about our terrible experience. The day after, I felt terrible, as well as our friend who also ordered chicken.

J. H.,"Allentown, PA",3,32,1,1.0,6/4/2014,"My friend and I went last Wednesday May 28th to this location at approx 2:15PM. We walked in and were greeted promptly and were seated immediately due to the time of day.  The restaurant was empty to the exception of a few tables. The greeter gave us menu's and told us the server would be right over.   I remember it was around 2:15 PM because my friend asked me what tie it was when we were seated.  We chose what we were wanting to eat and sat waiting for the server.  And waited.  And waited.   Time is now 2:25PM  Viewed a man looking around like he was searching for his server.  Flagged down greeter who sat us and asked her to find a server since we had been waiting. She said she would. During the entire time we were waiting we heard copious amounts of laughter and roughhousing in the kitchen area.  Time is now 2:30PM and we stood up and walked out the door.  SUMMERY : fifteen minutes of waiting for our server in a close to empty restaurant while listening to what seemed like a crazy gossip session going on in the kitchen area and watching another customer searching in vain for his server did not leave the favorable impression that Friday's wants in a Yelp review.  I noticed a decal on the door as we were walking in about reviewing our restaurant visit on Yelp.  Well here's my review Fridays, I'm sorry but you earned this bad a rating from me.

This location has a HUGE bar.  Even when they are busy I've been able to find a seat.  Drinks are okay (a little sweeter than I'd prefer), and the appetizers are large enough to share as a meal if you aren't starved (we often share potato skins & boneless wings).  I also like the club sandwich.  Bartenders are friendly but sometimes overworked (the huge bar normally isn't staffed as well as it should be).  Lots of TVs so easy to catch any game.  Don't forget to sign up for the Stripes program...who doesn't like a free item every once in a while!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2?start=40

After waiting for a table for 25 min and seeing plenty were available, I realized why we hadn't been there in awhile.  Our server was not much better. Took us 20 min to order food after being seated. I watched as she took two other tables orders went to the computer entered those and then got another table some drinks. We had two children w us. (4yr and 1yr old). Both were patient but our appetizer came out at the same time of our meals.  Our server never chked for drink refills and when we were finally done she came. I handed her the credit card and said just give me the bill. Not knowing the next time she would show up.  They gave us coupons for a free dessert next time, we had no desire to stick around for a comp dessert for the error w the appetizer.  We do not plan on returning.

Jana B.,"Reading, PA",20,22,,1.0,6/12/2016,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. Gave it one star because our waitress was very sweet and attentive and deserves a good word here but otherwise do not waste your money.   We started with the BBQ chicken flatbread appetizer - are you kidding me! Almost $11 for that? BBQ sauce with tiny pieces of chicken. I could've made that for a few dollars - bad. We ordered the Jack Daniels chicken sandwich - supposed to be basted in a special JD glaze. Well no - the glaze was on the side and there was maybe one onion straw on the sandwich and it was lukewarm. We also got the California chicken club. Also a poorly made sandwich - don't know where the yogurt aioli was. And nice try with the slab of Gouda on there all cold and gross.  The menu sure made things sound better than they actually are. And for as fast as everything came out, I'm quite sure it came out of a plastic bag and was microwaved to warm it up...barely. All that and fountain drinks for $42. Yep - $42 wasted. I used to love it at TGI Fridays but will never return. Oh - and not to mention the hostess who was very odd and annoying - she just made the visit even more umm interesting.

Everything went smoothly from start to finish and the server anticipated my needs every step of the way. I didn't really order anything special, just a standard Jack Daniels burger, so it was about what one would expect from the restaurant chain.

Alex S.,"Jersey City, NJ",177,394,49,2.0,8/22/2013,"Came here and was a little underwhelmed with the service. The only server who seemed to be on his game was a younger male bartender. We walked in at an odd time (I think it was around 4) and there were only about 7 or 8 tables full. One group walked in ahead of us, and needless to say the hostess panicked and was obviously overmatched. After waiting for a couple minutes twiddling our thumbs, we ended up just moving to the bar. It took forever to get our drink order and food order taken, but I won't hold it against this guy b/c he was the only one behind the bar and  about 60% of the patrons were there...so not only was he personally serving half of the restaurant, but he was making drinks for all the rest of them. Maybe he should give a few pointers to the chick who was overwhelmed by walking 2 sets of people to their seats. The middle-aged female bartender who came and started helping him later was rude. I was staring at a pile of to-go containers on the other side of the bar directly across from me. When I asked her for a container and motioned to them (she could have grabbed them with one hand, and without moving handed them to me...for a sum total of 3 seconds worth of work) she acted annoyed and told me ""hold on one minute,"" then proceeded to walk around and look busy doing a whole lot of nothing for the next 5 minutes before she just completely forgot. Needless to say, the dude who had made about 35 drinks in that time period ended up grabbing us the containers and our check.

Matt T.,"Chester, NJ",0,15,,1.0,11/25/2014,"If I could give zero stars - I would.  I so wish I had read the reviews on this place before we went in.  We were traveling through the area.  The TGIF near our house is consistent - decent food and pretty quick.  Overall what you expect from a chain. THIS PLACE WAS AWFUL.  One of the worst experiences I've had in a restaurant.  We sat for quite a while before anyone came over.  It was a quiet Sunday afternoon.  Drink order was not too much issue.  F We waited a loooooooong time for the food.  When it came, it was clear that the burger had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time.  The rock was literally solid.  The burger which had been ordered MR, was a hockey puck.  My wife's chicken salad was the same.  The chicken was rubber from being under the lamp and the lettuce was hot. The kids meals had about 6 fries on the plate.  It was amazing that any server would even think to put those things in front of a customer. We are not complainers - but this was ridiculous.  We sent both back - and the replacements were not too much better - but we just wanted to eat and get out.  The manager came over and apologized - but seemed like he had said the same words 1,000 times.  It was like he was going through the motions - it was clear that he didn't want to be there. Then I respond to the standard survey on the receipt - assuming I'd at least get an email from TGIF recognizing that they heard me.  Nothing.  If you're going to ask to hear from a customer - at least acknowledge what's communicated!

After taking our order she forgot to take the menus and did I say that we had 13 in our party.  I then handed the manager the menus and she did thank me for doing her job. To cut to the chase, orders came out at different times and drink refills were hard to come by.  The staff were having a wonderful conversation  near the bar.  I got up once to get someone to respond to our request.  They were all smiles without one apology.  Still it took forever to complete our dinner and again the staff was nowhere to be found.  Management stood in the front talking and did thank us for coming as we left.  A rather amateurishly run Friday's to say the least.

Brenda B.,"Whitehall, PA",19,11,,2.0,3/30/2014,We were excited to go to tgi Friday's as my husband and I love the Jack Daniels sauce. We got there and the hostesses were rude. There were three of them up front chatting. Why do you need three hostesses? Then they seat us and bring us a high chair. The high chair was filthy! I had to scrub it with baby wipes. We were seated by the hostesses so they watched me do this and didn't offer to clean it. I would have asked for a different one but the waitress already took 15 minutes to come and acknowledge us. The food was decent but overpriced. We had the Jack Daniels sampler as our appetizer and they didn't give us any plates! Our check was 58$ and it just wasn't worth it.

Jared F.,"Coplay, PA",17,201,57,2.0,12/29/2013,"I honestly haven't been to TGI Friday's in 3-4 years. First off I was surprised by how the prices went up! The average appetizer is $10, burger $13 and entree is $15. We arrived early on Saturday night, about 4:00pm. Most of the restaurant was empty and yet the hostess who was clearly confused went back and fourth with another employee as to where to seat us for about 2 minutes. We should've turned around there and left but we stuck it out and got seated. Our waiter who was nice, was also easily confused by us ordering their non-alcoholic slush drinks. When my fiance ordered he replied with ""those aren't free refills"". The menu states the slushes do have free refills. And we had to point that out to him. We ordered an appetizer, she got chicken fingers and I got a burger. The food was as expected and enjoyable. But sitting through my whole meal without a refill on my or her drink is quite ridiculous. For that reason alone, I won't be back. And now that we gave it a shot while we were in the area, and saw the escalated prices and poor service, we'll be taking our future business elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2?start=60
Tina B.,"Allentown, PA",0,35,1,4.0,2/11/2014,"We live near this location and have had good service and good food when we come during slow hours. Food is usually more consistent then the service. We did witness a shift change that got very catty when someone wanted to leave but her station wasn't checked. And she wanted to share it with the world. Drinks are good as well. And a plus, is if you join the rewards program, they give you chips and salsa every trip and it is pretty easy to earn rewards.

We were seated at a table that is right next to the kitchen/bathroom/server station. The waiter training the trainee was kind of rude and forgot my drink and didnt bother coming back until our appatizers arrived. The worst oart about him not coming back to check on us was he was sitting at a table 20 feet from us just staring into space. When the entrees came out my girlfriends sandwich was missing its onion straws and it had tomatos on it even though she asked for no tomatos. after dinner i wanted to order one of their drink specials (a mojito) but they did not have any mint. My girlfriend went to use the bathroom after dinner and when she came back out she told me there was no toilet paper.

Dory S.,"East Stroudsburg, PA",28,57,8,3.0,1/11/2018,"Originally I was only going to give 1 star. We ordered a nacho appetizer. It was terrible. There were a couple of beans thrown on it. The cheese was like they took white American sliced cheese and stuck it in a microwave. That was bad enough, but we didn't see the waitress again until after we finished the nachos (we finished them because we were starving). When she finally returned she asked if we were ready to put our order in for our meal. At this point we said just bring the check. The manager came over and asked how everything was. We told him everything that happend and he made it right by comping our meal if we would stay. (We did get charged for the nachos) but that was a fair deal. I ordered the bean and avacado burger.  I have to say it was very good. A bit stingy on the avacado.    I probably would not return only because in general it wasn't the best experience, but I commend the manager.

Dude that made eye contact with my husband came over, stated he was the general manager and took our drink order. He came back and took our food order. He then brought over a waitress stating ""this is my friend.... and she is going to take care of you."" After the GM left, she stated that ""sorry, this wasn't my table and proceeded to tell us that ""Last week, we had a big table in the corner that waited so long that they got up and left."" And then, ""we're not that busy, but food takes a really long time to get done."" She also stated ""The host is new, sorry."" I was a waitress for a few years. I wouldn't have ever commented on the staff or the food to a customer.  The food wasn't hot, the shrimp tasted hard and cold. Although the appetizer was free, it was less that good.

She disappeared for a while then came back to take our drink order but we also gave her the rest of the order. Came back with water and asked what the third drink we asked for was.... she came back with our appetizer after about 15 minutes. The wait seemed endless and she never stopped by to wonder where our food was. After about 50minutes ! I asked for a supervisor and our entrees were brought out as she left the table. All of the food was dry and it was obvious that it had died in the window.

Zachary P.,"Bethlehem, PA",6,15,1,2.0,7/1/2017,"After a rainy day at Dorney Park, we decided to come here for dinner. It ended up being 8 at night, so the restaurant wasn't crowded at all. So, we were seated, looked at the menu, and it probably took the waiter about 15 minutes just to come and take our drink orders, and by that time we already knew what we wanted to eat, so we just ordered the food too while the waiter was there. Both the food and drinks took a long time to come out. The only positive thing about this restaurant is that the food was actually really good and that they have a nice sized parking lot. It was also very cold inside since it was raining and we were all wet, but this TGI Fridays insisted on keeping their air conditioning on, even though most customers were soaked and already cold enough. From now on, I think I'll just stick to the TGI Fridays at the Southmont shopping center in Easton since I've been to that location many times and never had an experience like this there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2

Tara C.,"Tampa, FL",45,132,62,2.0,7/3/2015,"I will just say a few things about Friday's... 1. Probably the most depressing establishment I have been to in a long time. I felt like I was surrounded by zombies. It made me feel sad, and I wasn't sad.  2. We sat at the bar. When we finally attracted the attention of one of the two bartenders working the service bar it felt as if we were putting her out.  3. The floors were dirty...and there was no one there. If you can't be spotless when there is no one there, when can you be clean? 4. The food was, in my husband's words - ""not the worst I've ever had, it's edible"". Normally his standards are higher than mine. Not this time. I thought it was bad and it took way longer than it should have. We both split the pretzel appetizer. Incredibly buttery. I didn't finish mine and I ALWAYS finish pretzels. I'd eat pretzels until I pop. We also both got the Jack Daniel's burger. First the BBQ sauce was runny with chunks of something or other in it. The burger was unseasoned and at the same time had an odd taste. The bacon was rubbery. The bun stuck to my teeth. I finished less than half. Clearly it was not fresh. The sweet potato fries were the only bright spot. They were yummy.  I will not be back. This is one time where I actually agree with the ratings from fellow Lehigh Valley yelpers. I find they typically give much higher ratings than establishments deserve....2.5 stars is about right for this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-allentown-2
