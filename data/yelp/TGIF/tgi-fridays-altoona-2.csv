Kalyn B.,"Rossiter, PA",134,137,63,4.0,2/27/2016,"I can say that I consider myself a regular at his TGI Fridays. I've been here a number of times and I've gotten a variety of things from the menu.  Every time I've been here, weather it be for lunch, dinner, or late night food, I've always had good service here. If you come during the busy lunch or dinner hours expect service to a tad slower than normal...but I feel that's to be expected. As far as food is concerned, you really can't go wrong with any of the appetizers. They are all delicious. (Just leave your diet at the door!) one of my personal favorites are the pub pretzels and beer cheese. You can't go wrong with beer cheese!  There are a lot of really tasty entree options. The burgers are very good... They are one of my personal favorites. The steak is good as well. Don't hesitate to ask your server what he/she recommends!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-2
Greg W.,"Hollidaysburg, PA",0,3,1,5.0,3/10/2017,"We were in yesterday great service, clean and everyone in our group was happy w they got. No easy feat. They even had a party room. Definitely will consider using the party room in future.  Did I mention very friendly efficient service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-2
Family O.,"Lilly, PA",0,4,,2.0,4/1/2017,"Endless apps that you can't share? No Italian dressing? No ribs? No ribeye steaks? No mashed potatoes? The food was good but our service was horrible and the waitress kept offering her opinion about EVERYTHING!! No, my husband is not full! Please keep bringing his appetizer refills!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-2
Mare B.,"Cassville, PA",0,9,33,1.0,8/3/2016,"I agree with Jay. My sister and I stopped in at 1:30 there we 2 people at the bar and another at a table. Our waitress was NOT busy by any means, yet it took her awhile to get our drinks, then we placed our orders even got appetizers because we were hungry, 15 minutes later they show up and 5 minutes after our meal. The potatoes skins were burnt yet the cheese didn't even melt.  I enjoyed the jack Daniel chicken and my rice, but my sisters pasta was overcooked and the noodles mushy.  We still aren't clear if our waitress was ALSO the cook, that would explain the service.. that will be our last trip to TGIF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-2
Matthew B.,"Altoona, PA",0,43,1,2.0,8/28/2016,"Over priced burgers and not good at all worst in town I would say, apps are great but also a bit over priced every time I go here it seems slow but takes forever I won't be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-2
Jay D.,"Hesston, PA",0,2,,1.0,5/13/2016,Ate here 5 times between 1/1 and 5/12. Ate at bar around 2 pm each time . Maybe 2 others at bar and 2 tables in bar area. Bartender would disappear in 10 min blocks. When I did see her she was talking to guests at another table or spending time at register doing something with checks. Lots of empty glasses and guests looking at each other waiting to order. This was the case EVERY time. My recommendations to friends and business associates will not be favorable. Hard to be the worst in Altoona.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-2
Bobbie E.,"Palm Desert, CA",47,133,138,5.0,6/13/2016,"Crickit, was so awesome ! We are here visiting my Mother in law, she lives in Tyrone, who requested to go to Fridays for lunch. We come into this Friday's Every time we come to Tyrone, from California. I'm so glad to come to THIS FRIDAYS, Why ? You ask ? Because of all the Friday's I've ever been in, this is the friendliest, and the cleanest ! I love Pennsylvanians !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-2
Keith A.,"Spring, TX",0,22,1,4.0,5/4/2016,Good/average food.   Only place i got good service in this town.  Sat in bar area during lunch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-2
Brittany D.,"Johnstown, PA",0,32,25,4.0,7/3/2014,"A little bit disappointed that their menu changed a lot since the last time I was there.  I ordered the sirloin steak hibachi kebabs as my meal. I thought they'd be a little bigger...4 bite sized pieces of steak. It did taste like it just came off the grill and had soy sauce on it (that didn't taste like pure salt.) The pita bread was fluffy and bland where there wasn't any leftover sauce. The ginger lime slaw was also pretty boring.  But I ended my little meal with a nice big piece of ""to die for"" cheesecake so I can't complain too much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-2
Bob S.,"Bellefonte, PA",0,44,21,5.0,8/30/2014,"Not much into franchises, but, we stopped at the local TGIF's for dinner.   Promptly greeted and seated.  Our meals were very good and the service was excellent thanks to Danielle and the entire staff at TGIF's.  We're giving it five stars because it gave us everything we were expecting.  Will we be back? You bet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-2
Samantha L.,"Elmora, PA",7,54,,2.0,11/8/2014,"Stopped in for a late lunch today. The restaurant had a crowd, but it wasn't packed. Our waitress was not the best. I unfortunately did not catch her name (that's attributed to the amount of time she spent on us). Not only could she not be bothered to bring us refills, she didn't even bother to bring our meals out. I ordered the bacon cheddar burger and asked for it medium. When my food arrived, I cut my burger in half. She came over to ask how it was and before I could even separate my burger halves, she was gone. Had she stuck around, I could have told her it was over cooked but it was ok because I would eat it anyways. When we were done eating, she did show up with the check... Though I actually wanted to order dessert... Guess I wasn't allowed to? I dunno.  Wish we would have went elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-2
Mike J.,"St Peters, Saint Louis, MO",7,238,12,3.0,2/23/2014,Stopped in here passing through to lewisburg. Right off the highway. It wasn't very busy and had lots of open spots at bar. It took a little before the bartender got to me. After that service was good. Food came out quick and was good as Fridays always is.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-2
Julie C.,"Hollidaysburg, PA",0,20,2,2.0,10/20/2014,"Food is mediocre. Service is terrible. Only had a good waiter/waitress maybe once to every ten visits. They disappear for the majority of your meal and give attitude when you request another beverage, act like it's an inconvenience for them to be serving you. Bartenders are friendly at least. On a most recent visit, my dinner date found small pieces of glass in his potatoes. The manager made it right, but definitely a turn off for the rest of the meal. On a previous visit about two months ago, we never received our app from our ever-absent waitress, even after inquiring again before the meal arrived and she assured she'd check on it. Our meal was brought to us by someone other than our waitress and we didn't see her again for a good 20 mins. Our app was finally brought to our table as we were done with our entrees and waiting for our check by yet another individual (not our waitress). The table behind us had the same issue, except they received theirs during dessert. When the waitress finally reappeared and saw, she did send the manager over who plainly told us that our waitress never put the order in for our app. Will not be returning. Not worth it. Pay the same price and go elsewhere. Over priced drinks and apps (which you may or may not receive) and service by folks who clearly do not want to serve anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-altoona-2
