Adam M.,"Buffalo, NY",99,263,73,2.0,11/15/2015,"Overall this Friday's is one of the worse locally is not the worst! Never clean, service has got worse by the visit, and just not a friendly place to eat!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3?start=20
Jim L.,"Lockport, NY",2,9,,1.0,7/30/2016,"I had the $10 rack of ribs special for lunch.  Worst rack of ribs I've ever had.  I could go into detail but the bottom line is - if you're looking for ribs, go somewhere else.  Anywhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3?start=20
Roz G.,"Buffalo, NY",0,1,,2.0,1/10/2017,"This is not the Friday's I remember.  Service was very slow, the order was wrong,  the bathroom was nasty. This was on a Tuesday evening with many empty tables. No excuses!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3?start=20
Danielle C.,"Buffalo, NY",79,4,,5.0,6/6/2016,The food here is awesome. Love the Jack Daniels sauce. The cocktails are even better. Try the Peach Sangria. Seriously. Great service. Highly suggest sitting at the bar with Bonnie. She is bubbly and talkative and makes some bomb drinks!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3?start=20
Resatul I.,"Brooklyn, NY",69,4,,5.0,12/5/2015,"Was seated promptly, friendly staff. Food was hot and delicious (recommend the loaded potato skins and the chicken bbq flatbread). Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta was extraordinary - looks meh on menu, but fucking spectacular when out of the kitchen. Sauce is thicker than butter and flavorful - a bargain for its price. Tennessee whiskey cake for dessert - for the win.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3?start=20
Jeruen D.,"Berlin, Germany",35,1135,796,2.0,6/11/2012,"I always have low expectations for chain restaurants. And sure enough, on our latest visit to Friday's, my expectations matched the experience.  We went to Friday's because it was 11 PM and nothing else was open, and yet we were hungry. The place was almost empty, except for an occupied table or two. That being said, we waited almost 5 minutes to get a table, as no one was watching the front door. One would assume that since they are less busy, then there would be more hands to deal with customers, right? I ordered the French onion soup, while the accomplice ordered the strawberry fields salad. That's all we got, we were just a little hungry, not starving at all, it was clear that was all we wanted, so, why did the waiter give us a barrage of words, which later on I realized, were the names of their desserts? I didn't recognize it to be English until a few seconds later. Oh, and the French onion soup. It's supposed to have croutons, not a huge baguette slice. Do they expect me to use my knife to cut it in order to eat it? And why was the broth too salty? It almost tasted like they put soy sauce in it.  Oh well, you might ask, why were we here then? Well, only for the reason that they're open late and the rest are already closed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3?start=20
John B.,"Tonawanda, NY",55,97,13,1.0,6/9/2015,"Drink specials...... Yea with no liquor!!!! Ordered 10 oz steak medium. Came out very rare. Went back in came back out rare.

Angel C.,"North Buffalo, Buffalo, NY",3,13,1,2.0,7/14/2015,"Ordered pretzels for an appetizer. The hot cheese was cold and as I was eating the pretzels and noticed one of the pretzels was raw. I informed my waitress and she said ""just the one?"" As if that was a positive. My expectation was that none of my pretzels would be raw. Throughout the meal she mentioned it was only one a few times as if I was making a big deal out of nothing. The cost of the pretzels was $7.95 and at the end if the meal they took $5 off.  Honestly the way they handled the situation turned me off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3?start=20
Emily T.,"Franklin, KY",0,2,,1.0,12/17/2015,"I usually avoid Friday's bc of the fact that I am gluten free. However, some friends invited me this evening so I obliged. I ordered off their 'gluten free' menu the flat iron steak with mashed potatoes. I asked to add grilled shrimp as well. Steak was under cooked, potatoes were cold and service was awful (rushed). The worst part though is that the shrimp looked like it had breading on it. I asked the waitress and was informed that it was definitely gluten free. Two shrimp later, I knew there was no way. I stopped eating them immediately. Now I'm sitting at home, puking and am violently ill. Thanks Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3?start=20
Nicole J.,"Buffalo, NY",189,167,81,3.0,10/17/2013,"Eh, what can really be said about T.G.I. Friday's that hasn't already been encompassed by a thousand other reviews?  Some of my girlfriends and I will stop in here when we have an entree coupon or just need a little happy houring after work. Even though everything is standard T.G.I. Friday's fare, I do feel obligated to admit that, as far as sit-down chains go, Friday's is one of the better ones. The drinks are yummy, if nothing special, and the food is passable, even if the execution and individuality that is characteristic of local establishments is completely absent. The Jack Daniel's burger preceded by the warm pretzels with craft beer cheese appetizer is a nice combo.  Unless you're coming with a family or on an intimate date, I would recommend sitting at the bar. The service is just as good as sitting at a table and you can usually bypass the hefty wait time that seems to be a constant facet of this specific location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3?start=20
Jackie W.,"Buffalo, NY",3,21,21,2.0,10/18/2015,"My friend's and I biggest problem with this place was the service we received from our server Chelsea, she has short black hair and is light skin. The fact that they were out of three of four apps I wanted didn't help much. There's only like seven for the endless apps so doesn't leave you with much of a choice. Also they were out of the my two favorite martinis! The smorez and the cooler one. Even then I wasn't upset at all, I really could work with anything BUT bad service.  Chelsea literally came over took our order and never came back. I watched as she went to her other ONLY three tables, sat down with them, chatted, laughed, got them drinks, as my drink sat empty. I had to walk over to the BAR to actually get another drink. It was such a terrible experience. Our food took about 25-30 minutes to come out and that's the next time she made it even remotely close to our table. My partner and I are both servers and I know it gets busy so the fact that the food took long is not a problem. The fact that Chelsea took it upon her self to not check up on us for 25 minutes was the problem, she clearly saw me waving her down and didn't care. She'd rather go sit down with her other tables and continue her conversation. I don't know if it was my race or the fact that we are in our twenties and she thought she wasn't going to get tipped but the service was unacceptable. Therefore she lost out on an amazing tip! We know the life of a server, I've been doing this for six years,  no excuse Hun! The food was good for me but the service can either make it or break it, she broke it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3?start=20
Floyd B.,"La Grange, IL",81,46,111,1.0,2/21/2014,"We decided to visit this establishment rather than Chili's which was a mistake in itself. As a Professional Basketball Organization we called in advance to ensure we would have proper seating and was informed that proper accommodations would be met. NEEDLESS TO SAY,  but for the sake of filling in the character count, nothing was as it was supposed to be, then to top it off, they are withholding funds because of their own mistake, affecting the travel budgeting of our team.......The manager tried to insult our intelligence rather than own up and resolve the situation probably to make the day a record number because we fed 12 athletes and coaches.......we are in town 1 more day but have to.wait until Monday to.get funds???????

Was in tonight with Kate as our server. She was great, kept getting into conversation with us which i always like, and she was great with our one year old daughter which is an awesome selling point for me.

Ashley R.,"Ajax, Canada",0,7,2,4.0,9/9/2012,"This restaurant was absolutely great! I had visited T.G.I.'s before and it was so horrible that I vowed to never go back, but I had to go as it was a family dinner that I could not say no to. Wait times were a bit too long, but it was worth it for the dish that I got. Surprisingly, the portion was small, however, the taste of the food made me forget every negative thought about this place. I had ordered the Sizzling Shrimp and Chicken... Dessert was even better. I had the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS. All in all, this was a good location, and renewed my faith in T.G.I.!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3?start=20
Derrick C.,"Sacramento, CA",97,1246,126,4.0,10/15/2009,"I came here yesterday to redeem my Woody coupon for the free Jack Daniel's burger.  After realizing that the coupon specifically said ""dine-in only"", I asked if I could order it to-go and would just tip the waitress b/c I couldn't really see the difference.  Well, they made me order in the restaurant and wait 10 minutes for it but aside from that, Friday's was good to me.  I've noticed that not only at this one but the one I go to back at home in San Mateo that they always open the door for you and greet you.  The staff is very friendly and their food is always solid.  My burger was done medium and slathered in their patented Jack Daniel's sauce and came with some well seasoned fries.  TGI Friday's has always been a cut above the typical American chain restaurants and I've enjoyed the atmosphere and their food since I was a child and this one was no different.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3?start=20

The bathrooms are also very well kept and clean!The only thing is there a bit of a wait sometimes since it is in the mall shopping center. It tends to be a popular place to go, but it's worth the wait! They'll give you a timer and you can just browse the mall while you wait. They are also very accepting of coupons.

Patrick M.,"Tonawanda, NY",16,24,18,4.0,10/25/2017,"I haven't been to this location in several months, and it has been significantly renovated since I was last here.  The layout is more open and the seating was completely done over.  All these are a plus. As I have been to this location numerous times, I decided to try something new with their Mac and Cheese burger.  Now, with both my own burger and my wife's, they came out significantly overcooked and dried out.  We pointed this out to our server Chelsea who immediately apologized and put in our burgers to be remade.  They came out perfect the second time.  For the inconvenience Chelsea discounted our bill and gave us a coupon for a free appetizer/dessert on our next visit.  She went above and beyond which is why I am rating this four stars.  Things do happen, but this Friday's location, and our server in particular went out of her way to fix the problem.  Thumbs up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3

Lisa C.,"Grand Island, NY",22,33,,5.0,10/22/2017,This was my third visit to Friday's. The first one I went to was in Niagara Falls and it was horrible the second time we went we went to this one in Boulevard Mall. My husband ordered a hamburger medium well because he likes it a bit pink my daughter ordered chicken wings and I ordered steak and cheese medium rare. Our server was amazing he was quick friendly explain things however he apologized a bit too much for doing his job we gave him over a 20% tip because we really liked him. He was also the best server we ever had and hopefully if we ever go again will get him! Now to the food... my husband's medium burger was well well done dry but he ate it and did not complain because our server was so nice my daughters wings were perfect and so was her salad and my dinner though delicious was not medium rare it was more like a medium well. I know these are line cooks and not Chefs and I know that it's a chain restaurant too bad the kitchen doesn't match with the service! We only gave it five stars because of the server!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3

Zack R.,"Rochester, NY",160,93,63,2.0,12/16/2016,"This Friday's is not good.  Everytime I come here my waiter or waitress doesn't seem to be trained correctly. Today is a perfect example of this. Our waitress took about 15 minutes to even ask us for drinks and we were on a timed schedule so this was a bit disconcerting. The hostess had to tell the waitress that we were there. This has actually happened on at least two other occasions at this location. Once we got our waters our waitress failed to get us straws and took another 10 minutes to get drinks. Following this, the food as usual, was actually quite delicious. It always is. It's just a struggle getting there. It then took another half an hour before we had our checks given to us, after finishing and luckily the payment portion was relatively quick. Next time I may go to Bonefish Grill instead simply out of convenience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-amherst-3

Jason W.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,39,,4.0,1/25/2017,"As chains go I usually expect a similar experience each time with only minor changes. I enjoy what the Friday's chain has to offer.

Nothing is especially fresh or unique, but the food is good for what you pay.  This location is perfect for a quick drink before you hit the mall or for cheaper drinks later at night with affordable appetizers to match.

Bryan O.,"Escondido, CA",3,1,,2.0,5/28/2017,Went to this Friday's today for dinner. Ordered one of the steaks that come with mashed potatoes and broccoli. First of all the steak wasn't cooked to specification. Secondly the mashed potatoes came with sour cream on top of them.

The cheese on my wife's cheeseburger looked like it just came out of the fridge and wasn't melted what's so ever. The worst part is the manager came over and apologized and comped the meal but the food was so bad it wasn't worth the 1.5 hours we were there, mostly waiting. All I ordered was the endless apps and all I got was 7 boneless wings and gave up on the rest because I was still waiting. Instead of all the commercials they should hire more cooks or train the ones they have. Endless apps should refer to the endless time you need to wait for them.

America truly is the land of the free, I was free to decide how I wanted my burger cooked...and I chose PINK. And that was a good choice!!! Massive and juicy, the flavour rivaled that of 'gourmet' burger joints I've tried! Although everyone jokes about the massive portion sizes in the US, the amount of fries they gave was perfect. I also was able to try their homemade mac n cheese (which normally...if it's not KD I don't want anything to do with it) but this was a nice penne pasta with cheese and crumbs on top and it was really good!!

Our waiter, Mark, showed no attentiveness towards us and demonstrated poor service. His first words to us were ""The kitchen is out of everything"". It left a horrible impression and set the negative pace for the night. We were not given any silverware, plates or even a heads up that our food was running ridiculously late. Our wait for our FIRST round of appetizers ended up being 40-45 minutes. We weren't offered any refills on our water and our server neglected to offer us the usual chips and salsa while we waited. But maybe they ran out of that too? Overall, we were really disappointed with our experience.
