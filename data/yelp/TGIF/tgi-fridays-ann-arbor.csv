Allen S.,"Clinton, MI",258,5,,5.0,8/9/2013,The staff in this place is the best. Great drinks and Great food! I go here more then a few times a week due to my friends that work at the best buy right down the road from it. You have to love a food place you can go into a couple times and by like the 2nd or 3rd time people remember your name and give you a big smile when you go in. My only small complaint is that if you order things medium they are going to be more to the well done side =-) but no reason at all to take a star away from the great service and the food that still taste great. I have learned to just order my red meat one step down.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ann-arbor?start=40
Ted V.,"Milan, OH",0,6,,1.0,12/27/2012,Went for lunch.  Had endless soup and salad.  Didn't realize endless meant staying from lunch to dinner!  Worst Caesar salad I've every had.  Chicken noodle soup was poor canned soup quality at best.  15 minutes for a soup refill.  Asked for more salad but they didn't bring it.  This place sucks a big one.  Don't go there.  I wouldn't go back if it was free or even if the paid me to eat there.  One star is too high a rating.  It is time for TGIF to close their doors chain wide.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ann-arbor?start=40

Shannon B.,"Saline, MI",0,2,,1.0,12/20/2017,Poor service and endless apps we're terrible. Meatballs had tomatoes paste not sauce and chicken wings had no sauce. If you want something to wash it down with good luck can't get refills. Would stay away from this location. Young manager doesn't know how to run this location according to bar and off employees in the corner. Which is really sad because he was the only one who was doing anything.

C. R.,"Saline, MI",0,7,,1.0,10/22/2017,"Went in for the heavily advertised "" big rib deal "".  Sat at the bar, friendly bar/waitress.  The restaurant had the feel of the day after an animal house party.  Could have been cleaner. 2 orders of the ribs came very slowly... not waitress' fault.  Ribs were tough, (not fall off the bone), with not very much meat on each rib.  Hurt my teeth trying to eat them.  Slaw tasted watery and funny.  Fries were ok, but not real warm.  A 28 dollar bill came (had no drinks), and it was definitely a bust dinner night.  Don't get sucked in by the TV advertising.  Not worth it in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ann-arbor

Then, I was told about 20 minutes after we ordered our food that the kitchen was out of the item I had ordered - shouldn't they have known that right away?

Michael T.,"Saline, MI",8,90,40,2.0,4/21/2016,"This business is on its way out for good reasons: 1) Management, including the General Manager, has lost customer focus.    He rejected a corporate coupon specifying this particular location without looking at it.   I had to call him over and showed him the coupon, which he studied for a good couple of minutes and then said; ""yep, it's good."" I asked him why he rejected in the first place and he said he thought it was a different coupon (That's is why you read the coupon before rejecting or accepting).  No apology for delaying my order 15 minutes.  The place was dead at 7 pm on a Saturday and I knew why right at that moment. 2) Food is expensive and poorly prepared.  In spite of asking for tender ribs, we received ribs that were dry and lacking tenderness.  We had dry ribs here in the past, which is why we asked.  The ribs had little Jack Daniels sauce and a small 1/4 filled couple of Jd sauce on the side for some shrimp. When I asked for more sauce because the cup was almost empty right when brought out, the waiter said there is an up charge.   I told just told him to fill the little cup you gave me, which he did.   The ribs were a $26 item and they are going to up charge for an ounce of sauce for these dry ribs!  Geez! I should have sent these back but we were on track for a movie. 3) This place doesn't feel fun.  The lack of smiles, greetings, goodbyes and the general body language in this place just feels wrong for a food service business that is supposed to be a fun place.  Probably not the workers fault, but maybe management creating a ""bummer"" work environment.   Maybe everybody was feeling low because the place was dead? I still like all of the brick a brack on the walls so +1. I felt like I was at TGI Monday morning, so I won't be returning to this particular location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ann-arbor

Our kids hardly touched their pasta. Apparently their marinara for kids pasta is the same marinara as mozzarella sticks. It was gross. Bruschetta chicken pasta no longer is made with angel hair, now uses fetuccine which is used in a different pasta too--I'm noticing a cost-cutting theme. We all left hungry. Oh and it was empty for a Saturday lunch, not a good sign--and the food still took a loooong time.

The place was practically empty so I'm not sure what the wait was about. After sitting down we waited about 20 minutes to order and waited another 10-15 for drinks. We had a big party (about 10 people) but drinks shouldn't take that long. Once we all had ordered our food the waiter came back and told us they did not have jack daniel's chicken anymore (they are known for their jack daniels items, how did you run out)? The kids' food came out last and cold and many items were forgotten. After asking for boxes and the bill we waited literally another 15 minutes for our server to bring anything.

My friend ordered the sizzling chicken and cheese dinner. It arrived and smelled amazing! However she cute into it and half the chicken was RAW. Not even slightly undercooked but slimy raw. We called our waiter over and explained the situation. He looked at it and said, ""GROSS."" Exactly. Strike two.  I my food came out with hers so while waiting for her food to be recooked mine got cold. It was just soup so you'd think they'd ask if I would like to have mine put back until hers was ready.  The manager then came over and apologized for the raw chicken and walked away. Didn't seem very concerned. More just obligated to come over. Chicken then came out. It was delicious.  Bill came out- they changed us for everything! They couldn't even be bothered to comp us on a drink or a dessert or heaven forbid the chicken dinner that almost killed my friend! Like for real- she's doing chemo and that chicken could have legit killed her. Strike three.  The food was decent, but the customer service was sub-par. Disappointed. Frustrated.

Jill J.,"Belleville, MI",0,14,,1.0,3/10/2016,"Visited today with several co-workers and it took 30 minutes to get a waiter to pour us some water. It's not like the place was busy...just 10 occupied tables in the whole place. Now that I think about it, I'm not surprised, the service and quality of food prep has probably scared most locals away. Food came after 45 minutes and it was fine. A 'to-go' burger order was written 'rare' instead of 'well-done' , so my co-worker went to the serving window to get her burger recooked correctly. At this point, she saw a cook digging through cooked food (with his bare fingers) on a plate waiting to be taken to a customer. Several times he picked something out of it and flicked it off his finger and then wiped his hands on his pants. I think she was going to throw-up and then have a heart attack. We told the  scruffy-looking manager who said he would say something. However, looking back to many of these reviews, it looks like this is the culture of this location.

Beth L.,"Ann Arbor, MI",77,15,,2.0,7/22/2015,"Okay, so I try to avoid chain restaurants, but since I was with my teenage son who prefers to *not* put much thought into dining, I will occasionally go to places like a TGI Fridays when I'm with him.  So, the service was strangely off. Our server seemed nice, when we saw her that is. There were times she'd walk toward our table, and then turn around and waddle elsewhere. She almost seemed to avoid us? Very strange to me.  No silverware on the table, and it took 15 minutes to get that. Generally a place like TGI Fridays refills drinks before one asks, but this never happened. Fine, I'd rather not have my son drink much soda, but not a single refill was offered.  Our food took way too long to arrive at the table. Seemed like over 20 minutes? My chicken breast was like rubber in spots -- definitely over-cooked.  Flavor was pretty good though, considering. Oh, the mac & cheese is actually really good. Fattening, but good for a little comfort food treat.  Not a spot for a day when you're trying to keep your calories at or below 1200 for the day, so keep that in mind if you wish.  This experience was the worst I've had at this restaurant (at this location). I don't know if I'll go back. Not the worst experience I've ever had in my life, but it was below average for sure.

C T.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",1,28,,1.0,11/7/2014,"Never going back... We went on a Friday night for dinner.  The wait for a table was about 20 minutes, despite plenty of visible open tables.  We then waited another 35 minutes for water.  I ordered one of their new specialty mixed drinks, and it was filled with ice and no flavor, and was presented in a sticky glass. We ordered appetizers that took 45 minutes.  My meal came after an hour and a half, but they didn't have my husband's cooked yet.  Our waiter kept apologizing that his burger wasn't ready yet, but he didn't order a burger.  This happened at least 3 times.  I ate in front of him for 20 minutes before his food came out.  We agreed the food was average at best.  During dinner I ordered another mixed drink and it was flat and likely missing any alcohol. Our waiter said he would get the manager for us 2 times, but never did.  The waiter comp'ed half our meal.  The only reason we were ok with that was because we had a gift card, and we could use up all the money on it.  We didn't want to come back again to use the rest of the money.

Hillary A.,"Laingsburg, MI",0,11,1,1.0,7/21/2014,"This is for the Lohr Rd location. We came here when we moved to town because we hadn't had time to get groceries and hadn't even unpacked the kitchen yet. Just needed something quick and easy and this place is just a mile away from us. My boyfriend went to pick up our order and they had said he could have a seat at the bar to wait for it. He sat there for about 10 minutes and then realized there was some food sitting on the counter asked if it was his order and they said yes. It wasn't even warm by the time he had gotten home because they had left it sitting on the counter without telling him the order was ready.  We decided to give it a second try when our power went out. Got seated back by the kitchen which is no big deal. But had to wait at least 10 minutes before we even got a water to drink. It was a steady flow of servers walking by and I even saw the manager walk by a few times. Finally our servers came, yes plural because she was training someone. They were of course out of the one thing we both wanted...nachos. How do you run out of nachos? If you run out of something so easy to make go across the street to Meijer and get back up. We picked different items and ordered. Spinach dip came out warm. Not hot. And the rest of our food was less than mediocre. We both ended up just getting appetizers because none of the meals even sounded good. I know now that it wasn't just a bad time the first visit...it will always be like that.

I used to love TGI Friday's, but after they changed their menu, reduced the portion size, yet kept the prices the same, I had to rethink about my feelings for TGI Fridays. The Bar - they have happy hours and you can order the appetizers for 1/2 the price... your experience with the staff at the bar can be hit or miss... it all depends on who you get... and it seems like many of their friends come during the happy hour, so some of them are too busy chatting away with their buddies rather then taking care of the customers. The restaurant - the last time I was there, I got the Jack Daniel's sampler... the rib was overcooked and dry... I had to send it back, no amount of Jack Daniel sauce would cover up the dryness.  I guess I shouldn't have expected much for reheated ribs... but they could at least paid more attention... so I had to wait another 20 minutes for the new ribs to come back... this was my last visit to this establishment. Service - service when dining wasn't bad... the wait staff did come by often to check in on us.  Lot better service then at the bar.

Peggah G.,"Chicago, IL",261,439,84,2.0,5/11/2012,"I'm apart of the TGI Fridays rewards card thing, and I always think okay, let's go here, but every time it seems like a mistake. A horrible mistake. Once, my boyfriend and I went and we had an eccentric waiter. I know that in the past, their waitstaff was expected to be quirky, but recently I feel they've been going for a more toned down approach.  When the waiter came to our table, he said ""Hey guys"", and then went on to apologize about saying 'guys' when I, a lady, was at the table. I assured him that I didn't care, nor did I find it offensive.  When we placed our orders and they came up, the waiter handed my boyfriend his meal and said ""Here you go boss"".  !! That offended me, more than the 'guys'. How did this waiter think it was offensive to say guys, but then calling the man of the table 'boss' isn't offensive? Because of that experience it took a while to go back there. Then we went recently. Last week sometime. The line at McDonald's was too long, so we ended up going to TGI Fridays. They had a deal going on, where you eat an entree, an appetizer and dessert for $13 or $16, something like that. So we decided we wanted two entrees, two appetizers and one dessert. That should have been around $23, then with drinks, $30. Somehow it was not this, but we were so annoyed regardless that we just ended up paying it. We were sat at our table, and we waited almost 10 minutes before anyone came to us. We asked the maitre' d to get our waiter, and the manager ended up coming to our table to get our drink orders before our waitress. My boyfriend had wanted to leave after 5 minutes, but I really hate sitting down and then getting up to leave. It's so obnoxious. The boyfriend ordered pulled pork sandwich, which we told the waitress 3 times, and she confirmed it to us, yet somehow he got the wrong sandwich, but by that time we were both so hungry that we just ate it anyway.  Mind you, I like their food. I like the crispy green beans, the fried mozzarella, I love the parmesan crusted chicken with the tortellini. Their desserts are also really really good. It's just the poor wait staff, the loud obnoxious music that lately has made me rather eat at McDonald's or go to Meijer to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ann-arbor?start=20

Alice L.,"Ypsilanti, MI",3,12,15,1.0,10/25/2013,"First of all, this place is NOT on Waters Road. It is on Lohrs Road. Also, there should be an update on the street view photo since it's just a picture of the woods on Waters Road.  I don't usually feel the need to write reviews at all, so, this will be my first review. I came here for my birthday dinner tonight in a party of three. I'm actually a big fan of TGI Friday's, but this place is nothing like the ones I've experienced before.   We ordered the Jack Daniel's Sampler which I've had many times before in previous TGI Friday's. We waited about 20 minutes and when it came, it looked nothing like the picture. The plate was dirty, the short ribs seemed microwaved and it was stone cold in the center. The crispy cajun shrimp was undercooked and barely crispy. The chicken was cooked, but it seemed like someone had taken a bite out of one and tried to cover it up with the sauce. I don't understand why our appetizer even took that long since it wasn't even properly cooked.  For the meals two of us (including me) ordered The Jack Daniel's Black Angus Stirlon Steak & Shrimp dish while the other one had something else that I cannot seem to remember at the moment. When our meals finally came, my meal was missing the crispy cajun shrimp and my husband was given their seasoned fries instead of sweet potato fries. When I finally received the crispy cajun shrimp, it was cold and not crispy. I'm pretty sure they microwaved it like they did with the short ribs. My seasoned fries tasted old and stale. My black Angus steak was unevenly cooked. I asked for medium and it came medium rare, medium and medium well done. How hard is it to cook a damn steak evenly? Apparently, it must have been that difficult for them cooks in the back to cook almost everything properly. My mashed potatoes was pretty much the highlight of my meal;but, shouldn't EVERYTHING have been a highlight though?? In the end, I was charged extra for drinks that were suppose to be at a discount this night. If you try and complain, they will blame you. Once they get your money, the servers disappear as well. Ridiculous? YES. It seemed odd since the place wasn't busy at all and I saw the servers literally playing and messing around the entire time we were there.  So, don't waste your money and time coming here! The servers do not care about you! Next time, I'm definitely going to take the extra drive on back to the metro Detroit area to go to TGI's with no bitter disappointments!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ann-arbor?start=20
B H.,"Ann Arbor, MI",0,1,,1.0,6/29/2015,"Service was horrible. Our server did not come to us for a good twenty minutes for our drink orders and I had made eye contact with her as we sat down, without knowing she would be our server. It was not at all busy, our section was empty with only our table and one other. Food was mediocre. I was charged for my meal and another's, never told that she had to void a transaction upon returning my card, looked at my account and was surprised. Called the restaurant and the manager tried to use the ""she's new"" excuse and couldn't do much else for me. I rarely eat there to begin with and this experience validated never going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ann-arbor?start=20
Pete P.,"Milan, MI",57,329,22,4.0,4/1/2013,"Went to Friday's on Saturday for dinner and was pleasantly surprised by the meal! I haven't been to Friday's in years but we decided to give it a whirl. We got there about 7:30 and were seated immediately. I t wasn't really busy as the restaurant was about half full. We got seated in the bar area and it was nice and not overly loud at all. I ordered the Bleu & Bacon Sirloin steak medium-rare with parmesan potatoes and mozz-tomato salad. Also, the table ordered the pot stickers as an app. The pot stickers were very good. Service was excellent as our waiter was very attentive, refilling soda quickly and without us having to ask (a BIG plus in my book). My steak came out cooked perfectly and was very good. No complaints from anyone else at the table as J. Daniel shrimp & chicken and chicken alfredo were the other dishes selected. All-in-all a very good experience!! Dane was the name of our server and deserves mention because of the really good job he did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ann-arbor?start=20
Kevin S.,"Cathedral City, CA",398,372,136,2.0,1/31/2013,Our food was not served at the same time. Food was ok. I was charged $3 for two breadsticks....WTF!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ann-arbor?start=20
