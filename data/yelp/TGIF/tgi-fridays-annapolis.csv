Aubrey F.,"Baltimore, MD",29,191,220,4.0,9/13/2017,"Great service! Enjoyed a fun night out! Our waitress was awesome and very attentive. She checked on us often and was very friendly.  I did the $15 endless appetizer option since I could decide what to get and was in the mood for small plates. I had the BBQ flatbread, the pot stickers, the loaded potato skins, and the chicken quesadilla.  The BBQ flatbread and the pot stickers were really good and flavorful! The loaded potato skins were just okay. The chicken quesadilla was also really good and had a lot of flavor!  Perfect deal for someone who is indecisive about what they want!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-annapolis

My wife had the french dip sandwich, which had an odd after taste.  She loved the fries, though.  Soft drinks and iced tea were good.

Gary M.,"Annapolis, MD",19,27,27,5.0,6/23/2016,"My friends and I went to this location for lunch. The parking lot was great since there was plenty space. The moment we entered the lobby, we were greeted and seated by a host immediately. That was great except it was awkward to see our blonde host with a collar unbuttoned black shirt with a silver necklace, as if we were in the gay nightclub. Our waiter was accommodating and very awesome! Wish I knew his name, but he was the one with awesome dreadlocks and I would like to have him as a chillin' friend and playing video games. He took our orders efficiency and there was no awkward conversation between us. I ordered the Memphis BBQ wings and Jack Daniel's Burger. Our food arrived in about 10 minutes and that's very impressive. My food was perfectly cooked except there was a bit too much grease on my burger. However I loved their Jack Daniel's sauce and I loved dipping my fries in it. When we were done with our meals, I'm very impressed with our waiter's timing skills. I was also impressed by the fact he tried to communicate with me in gestures since he asked me if I wanted dessert. He signed ""thank you"" perfectly. He is totally awesome and he has my respect. If it wasn't for him, I would give this restaurant a 4 star due to our host's poor dress code and too much grease in my burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-annapolis

Jim M.,"Arnold, MD",2,60,115,4.0,12/31/2016,"My family and I enjoy the menu, but the service leaves something to be desired at this location. Unlike most restaurants where you get 1 person waiting on you, here in the bar area you may get five or more. I know the theory, they are trying to overlap servers to try and keep someone stopping by frequently, but it is not working. You ask person A for something, they pass it to person B to do and person C shows up with a straw or napkin for you and says they never got the message, but fear not they will get it for you. Then 10 min. Later person D shows up with that ketchup you originally asked person A for. Problem is now your fries are ice cold or you already ate them because you got tired of waiting.    Ok, let me tell you about this Smoke Stack Burger I tried. Man it sounded so good with sausage squeezed between two patties... well, lol, i guess thats what I got. I pulled the patties apart to see two small pieces of meet that put me to mind of 2 small pieces of diced ham.  Overall it had a good taste though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-annapolis
Courtney K.,"Annapolis, MD",357,1748,2174,2.0,6/29/2015,"Bottom Line:  Highly processed, unhealthy bar food but an ok place to get a drink before or after a movie. Ever since Office Space I find my disappointed that the T.G.I. Fridays staff no longer wear pieces of flair.  I also find T.G.I. Fridays, a chain restaurant with bar food, to be irrelevant in Annapolis because there are so many better choices. For me, the only purpose of this Fridays is either a cocktail before a menu or a night cap thereafter since this is the only place in Annapolis Harbour Center that serves alcohol.  If I'm drunk enough, some of the appetizers may seem appealing.  What I do like about Fridays is they do have a handful of items that are always considered to be on happy hour.  Service here is fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-annapolis

My husband and I came here for a round of endless appetizers (really the only reason to come here in my opinion). It took forever for our first round to come out, but it did improve after that. The Memphis BBQ wings are probably the best thing on that menu. The potstickers were also pretty tasty. Our waitress was just so-so. Didn't make an extra effort, but I don't have too much to complain about.

T Z.,"Oakton, VA",1,60,8,1.0,6/20/2011,"One of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant recently.  Got there and everything was good, but then the entire complex had a power outage, fine not their problem.  Then they started rushing people to pay and leave since they couldnt have people in the store without power. One guy at the bar had just ordered a drink and they kept telling him you have to finish it immediately or leave.  When he asked them if he could just leave and not pay for it the manager told him he had drank too much of it, so she wouldn't comp the drink.   I tried paying with cash, they said they couldnt give change and I would have to pay with credit card.  Finally they took a copy of the credit card because there was no power and after I left I realized that not only did they not discount us for not being able to finish our food, but they actually over charged us and I had to go back and complain",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-annapolis?start=40

This is from Veteran's Day 2011! :P Friday's was offering a special for veterans, and as my dad is a vet, we decided to partake. We got in RIGHT before the lunch rush, and ordered.  Dad had the hibachi chicken skewers and I had the Jack Daniels flat iron steak.  For the record, the flat iron steak is my go to meal at Fridays. You just can't go wrong with it!  Dad said he liked his skewers too.

Kevin M.,"Davidsonville, MD",0,9,,3.0,5/6/2014,"What can you expect? it's a TGI fridays..... Solid food, friendly service, big portions, if you're not very hungry I wouldn't suggest eating here. The two happy hours are nice, especially the one from 10 til close. they offer 4 dollar long island ice teas during this happy hour. Now, this is the only complaint I have... my long island tasted like straight sour mix with no liquor and it was pretty obvious our bartender did not know how to properly make this drink. But they were only four dollars so I had about 5 or 6 and caught a nice buzz. That's the only reason this review gets an extra star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-annapolis?start=40
Wayne W.,"Annapolis, MD",0,49,,3.0,8/17/2014,"2.5 star experience when I dined today. Suprisingly, this TGI Fridays usually is on point so today was an off day. Two issues today. First was they advertised on their board by the front door a Sunday special....half price appetizers. Awesome! I've gotten this special before at my table and it really is a great deal. Sadly, it seems they changed this special to a ""bar area only"" special. Except they advertised it in a non-bar area and did not mention anywhere on the board the special had limited seating areas in which this would be honored. So my table couldn't partake. I expressed my disappointment that my table was excluded but the table that was making eye contact with me an arm lengths away could, but to no avail. My waiter said we could move to the bar area, but that would require my party getting back in line to be seated. Really? And stand with our bar drinks (since they have no problem spreading THOSE bar items to any table in the building...did that sound snarky? Eh, I stand by it.) No, thank you. While my table remained friendly the entire time, I feel the waiter assumed we were going to be difficult and just found other places to be for most of our meal. So service was a negative today. Again, usually I have good experiences with the staff here.  Just an FYI that has nothing to do with my rating. The 2 for $12/$16 options have changed to a massacred, wimpy version of its former self. Gone are most of the good choices that made you go ""wow, that's a great deal"" or even ""wow, so many good sounding options."" Now, you'll probably check out the full, higher priced menu more carefully. That's not bad in itself, but may have Friday's lose some of the bang for your buck it had going for it. So 2.5 today and prior experiences being 4 stars, comes to a (possibly too low) 3 stars. I'll be back, but I may have to play 21 questions with the host to guarantee I am in a seat that has all of the options Friday's has to offer available to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-annapolis?start=40

I got the Jack Daniel's sirloin and shrimp and there was no shrimp on my plate so I had to give it back which was pretty annoying. I can say that the BBQ chicken flatbread was good but I was disappointed with the size of my sirloin and the small lump of french fries and one small piece of broccoli for my sides.

Sat at the bar and ordered something called shrimp and chicken pasta with cream sauce. I looked at it when the foodrunner dropped it off and thought it was a soup. Pasta was drowning in sauce. I was starving so I gave it a try and it was completely void of any taste. Funny thing is I told the bartender that I was not a fan of it and that I would like to order something else. He looked at me as though I had run over his puppy or something. ""What's the problem?"" he asked. I explained it to him and I got a nasty look.

To have to convince the waiter who says ""it is suppose to come crispy"". Maybe so but black and charred is way too crispy.  Also teach a bartender how to make a margarita  Adequate for a cheaper me The above was a few months - there new renovation has lead to them playing loud - very loud - rock music. Hard to carry on a conversation. I was in at 4:30 and when I complained was told ""it gets louder at night""  Stay away unless you like loud rock music!! Shame - I use to like this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-annapolis?start=20
Bangali A.,"Arnold, MD",30,33,221,4.0,1/8/2012,Had their 3/$12.99 deal. Service wasn't so good. Our waitress took forever to bring in our entree. Didn't even check on us to see if everything was okay. But she was quick to bring in our dessert and check. Food and drinks is always good. My daughter loved their chicken fingers with fruit cup. Definitely try their fruit cup as a dessert.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-annapolis?start=20
