Cheryl M.,"Birmingham, AL",138,367,532,3.0,12/29/2017,"Typical Friday's fare. This one is in the airport. Don't be deceived by the entrance to this place. It looks deceptively small so you might think you will never get a table but it is actually really large once you get past the front entrance.  The service was good. Fast and friendly. My server, Jasmine, was really good. I ordered a medium rare burger and she warned me that it would be very bloody so I took here advice and got medium instead. It was pink in the middle, just the way I like it. My burger was excellent. Really hit the spot.  I was also given the option of several different sides so I got broccoli. I always like when you can get something other than fries. Not that I don't like fries but I don't need to be eating them, if you know what I mean.  Would I come here again next time I'm in the ATL airport? Yes, I would!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10
Russell D.,"Simpsonville, SC",46,147,216,1.0,8/13/2017,They were out of most beers on the menu except for the standard mainstream crap.  Our food took way too long to arrive and we almost left without getting to eat it.

Meg W.,"Savannah, GA",344,180,323,4.0,8/1/2017,"I had a great experience at the airport TGI Fridays.  I was dreading my solo 3 hour layover in Atlanta, and I was even more worried about the food situation.  I wanted to sit down somewhere, grab a beer and not be rushed.  There was a line out the door at TGI Fridays, but I managed to find a seat at the bar. The woman behind the bar was absolutely phenomenal!  She was super sweet and welcoming, while also staying on top of all of the bar orders.  They have a good assortment of draft beers, and they are very decently priced.  For dinner, I had the Million Dollar Cobb salad with steak.  It was huge!  It included blue cheese, bacon, boiled egg, tomatoes, cucumber, and fresh avocado.  The steak was a delicious addition. Everyone at the bar was so friendly, and I was able to have nice conversations while watching sports on TGI Friday's large bar TVs.  I never felt rushed, and my layover flew by.  The food was wonderful for an airport stop.  I highly recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10
Hudson G.,"Atlanta, GA",45,100,30,3.0,1/11/2018,This location really seems to have gone downhill. They didn't open on time in the morning and there were dirty dishes and liquor bottles all out front. There was trash all over the floor as if they didn't clean the restaurant the night before. The employees that were cleaning were not very professionally dressed and were yelling across the bar to each other. Several of them were actually sitting at the bar watching tv while the bartender was trying to clean up the bar. This isn't my normal experience with this location so not sure what was going on during this visit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10
Charlotte H.,"West Chester Township, OH",33,106,13,2.0,7/23/2017,"Slow to get food. Burgers were way too cold and pink inside for ""medium"" and fries were completely limp and cold. No time to send stuff back. Server looked puzzled why we don't like the look of our meals and says he can bring some fresh fries if we want? Why not fresh fries to start?? Pretty much your biggest fear about eating at a sit down restaurant in an airport - everything looked gross and made you feel gross.  And our 3 burgers and cokes add to $47!!!  I've had beers at the bar on work trips - the service is better, but the area has a terrible stale smell.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10
Stephanie W.,"Madison, WI",28,182,41,3.0,10/4/2017,I've been to TGI Fridays a couple of times but for the first time at this location.I really like their daily soups such as tomato basil and their cocktails.

Selmy B.,"Sarasota, FL",38,335,357,1.0,7/11/2017,"Airport food is rarely good, and this was no exception. The one perk, is the few minutes you get to quietly catch up with your emails and chill before you need to get to your departing gate. There are no outlets, so no option of charging your phone while you wait. Food is not important at this location but service is even worst. The servers have no concept of travelers and their limited time to eat. You get seated and you have to wait easily 10 minutes before someone comes over and introduces themselves.  The food is dry and/or greasy. Kids chicken fingers are heavily breaded and dry. Meanwhile, the pretzel appetizer was so greasy that the bread was drenched in a greasy butter sauce that was soaked.  Ended up drinking my beer, at least that was cold and standing up by the exit with my cash to hunt down my server. Which by the way, Jasmine was hanging out in the kitchen for over 8 minutes. Will skip this location if ever in the Atlanta airport.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10

Kristea F.,"East Lyme, CT",41,141,290,3.0,9/12/2017,"I had a delay before my flight and had never flown out of the T terminal before. It does not seem to be as big as the other terminals, and does have limited options for restaurants, so I decided to go here so I could enjoy sitting down and have a drink with my meal. Something that I really appreciated about this location is that when I entered, the hostess asked if I had at least 45 minutes until my flight, because that was the expected amount of time to be served. While that is a long time to wait for food, I was not in a rush, but really appreciated being informed of this prior to being seated. I was given one of the high top tables in the bar area, and was brought a menu immediately after being seated. I ordered a beer and my entree and the beer was brought almost immediately and the meal was brought after about 25 minutes - even better than their estimated time! All of the staff were extremely helpful, and while the food was okay, it was not anything to go out of your way for. If you would like to receive good customer service while having a meal in the airport, I suggest coming here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10

I would give TGIF ribs a 4 star, as I love the fall of the bones and the kick to the sauce. This place at the airport was a three. It wasn't the normal falloff the bones saucey ribs I LOvE.

Except that i ordered a 10 oz ribeye steak but got a different and smaller cut. I was in a hurry so i did not return it. And like most TGI Friday's, this steak tasted different from other locations.

Airport food and or restaurants as a whole are more hit than miss and I get that and allow for cocessions. Even with those cocessions I can't in good conscience give this place more than 2 stars. 1 star as a handicap because, it's an airport. If anything is good and doesn't give you the poops then consider yourself lucky. 1 more star for an exceptionally friendly hostess station. Go here for the bar, beer and the tv.  My experience with the food and waitstaff was undesirable. Ordered a simple appetizer pick 3. Food came out 10 minutes before beverages. My potstickers looked anemic. Not sure if they fry them in a fryer or pan fry them but they appeared freezer burned and had a very strange white speckled look to the dough, not at all appetizing. Miso sauce on the boneless wings was cloying sweet and goopy. GARNISH  and celery LOOKED LIKE IT WAS OLD, DRY AND UNSANITARY.

Mojdeh S.,"Seattle, WA",301,735,899,2.0,12/10/2014,"How I heard of this place: We walked by, it was close to our gate and we were hungry, knowing a long flight was ahead and no meals would be served. Type of cuisine: American Grub. Everything from burgers and chicken wings to pasta, ribs, sandwhiches, salads, desserts and that's just the tip of the iceburg. Ambiance: The loud, neon-lit space, very reminiscent of a 1950s diner welcomes all weary travelers into its crowded ranks. Everything from black and white checkered wall print, to enlarged photographs of the Hollywood sign, and various signs from Las Vegas are colorfully collaged on the walls, from framed black and white photos of the ""Ghostbusters"" trio and Elvis Presley, to a motorized bike, pool balls in a triangle and one drum protruding from the walls. Brighly colored media prints of Marilyn Monroe, white bulbs connected to spell out the word KITCHEN, wood-paneled walls (where one can see them), and stars spangling the hanging ceiling lamps and the glass around our mini booth. What I ordered: Boneless Buffalo Wings ($11.43), topped with Classic Buffalo Sauce, served ith celery, ranch and Bleu cheese dressings, the New Steakhouse Bleu Cheese Burger ($10.89), crumbled bleu cheese, applewood-smoked bacon, caramelized onions and garlic maison butter served over a grilled 100% USDA choice Black Angus beef patty, all contained within a hearty brioche bun, topped with fresh lettuce, pickles, onion and vine-ripened tomatoes, and the California Club ($9.67), which included mesquite-smoked turkey breast, applewood-smoked bacon, ham and Monterey Jack cheese on toasted ciabatta bread with Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, avocado and mayo. Each of our meals came with a side of seasoned fries. What I loved: Boneless Buffalo-flavored Chicken Wings. The seasoned fries were a very close second. Why I loved it: While I am most accustomed to finding a quick grab-and-go snack at airports where I have a layover, Chris seems to know all of the best places to find a sit-down restaurant. When we travel together, there is almost no other option. Cost: Average ($9.67 - $10.89 per burger/sandwich)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10?start=20

The avocado slice was small, hard, and had black spots. The seasoned fries were cooked perfectly but OVERLY salted. I ordered some Jack Daniels Sauce and pretty much covered everything with it. This made things slightly better. Overall Entree 2.5 stars.  Would I return again? I don't think so.

I had a cheeseburger and a wedge salad instead of fries, and my server simply traded the salad for the fries, so it did not cost me any extra- most other places would of charged my for the salad!  My wife had a cheeseburger as well, our bill was only 20 bucks. But we had no alcoholic drinks.

Kerry M.,"Lubbock, TX",0,4,,1.0,4/17/2016,"This was the worst service we received while visiting Atlanta.  The server was initially very friendly.  I ordered a coke but she brought me a diet coke.  I very politely (with a smile on my face) asked for a regular coke and her expression was as though I had said something hateful to her.  Even my wife noticed her negative reaction.  The server then proceeded to wait on other tables and then disappeared for well over five minutes - ignoring my request.  I finally took my drink up to the bar to get a coke, and even the bartender ignored me.  Our server finally saw me standing at the bar and then rushed over to get me a coke.  After she served our food, we never saw her again.  I ate my meal and drank my one drink.  I guess she saw me ask another waitress for our check, because she came running from the back.  I'm usually a great tipper, and I always treat servers with respect. The up side is my burger was very good.  Too bad our server ruined the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10?start=80
Lisa G.,"Tampa, FL",66,252,80,1.0,7/3/2013,Mediocre at best. Lack of detail to service an airport restaurants need to be fast. Food was not good. The drowned both out salads. Burger was ok but I'd recommend going elsewhere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10?start=80
Frank R.,"Phoenix, AZ",1,90,3,1.0,11/4/2013,Consistently horrible bartenders.  Done with that place.  They need to hire and train people with the slightest awareness of customer service.  This would make a significant improvement.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10?start=80
Paris S.,"Monroe, LA",23,34,,3.0,12/15/2013,"The TGI Friday's in the Atlanta airport delivers everything a traveler needs: speed of service, competent food, and a good place to relax and decompress on a layover. The food, as I said, is competent but uninspired; typical TGI Friday's fare. The chicken tenders were well-prepared but I could have used a lot more honey-mustard sauce than provided; they were very chinchy on the condiments. All in all an above-average expenence and definitely reliable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10?start=100
Julie M.,"Philadelphia, PA",23,75,4,1.0,1/29/2013,"The food here was fine - nothing more or less than I'd expect from a TGI Friday's in the airport. However, I have a real problem with sitting down for a meal and hearing the staff chatting with each other loudly saying ""F this, F that."" That behavior is not acceptable and is the last thing I want to deal with when I am traveling. It is inappropriate and disrespectful. NEVER AGAIN.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10?start=100
Veronica D.,"Allen, TX",3205,262,788,1.0,1/24/2013,What a gross breakfast! My dog literally would not eat the food! (yes he travels with me) slow service and the waitress didn't care about helping waiting on us. It was terrible. It's an airport should be fast it's not like they really cook anything.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10?start=100
Kevin D.,"Saint Louis, MO",52,438,1164,1.0,8/20/2012,"Not great. Dirty plate, dirty glass, terrible salad. Super friendly service though. If you want bar food and beer, it's a fine choice. If you want food that tastes good, I'd recommend Cafe Intermezzo next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10?start=100
Spencer C.,"Glendale, CA",37,173,13,3.0,3/26/2012,"Food was decent for an airport restaurant (granted, someone at my table asked for garlic aioli for his fries... Be aware it's an American chain restaurant, not a gourmet burger bar). They need a bag check (or just more room between tables for your roll-aboard). Awful music.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10?start=100
Alan K.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,23,,1.0,12/15/2013,"There are thousands of these place everywhere, we were in the concourse B one. Absolutely terrible place--the food about the worst I've been served in any restaurant. Admittedly I was being a bit naive in ordering boneless chicken wings and not reading the fine print-if there was any fine print. These are not chicken wings, they are chunks of white chicken meat, fried and pasted overall with a foul tasting red sauce and served with an equally foul tasting and looking white dipping sauce. The celery was good. Green, crisp. Real celery. The rest was crap, expensive crap. Just in case there is any fine print anywhere in any of the tgifs I've now decided to avoid them all. Any place that can commit a culinary crime of this magnitude deserves a wide berth. Why won't they let you vote less that one I wonder?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-10?start=100
