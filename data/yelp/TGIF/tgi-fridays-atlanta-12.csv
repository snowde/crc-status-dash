Monte T.,"Magna, UT",10,3,,4.0,1/10/2018,Our server was really nice and was very fast with his service. We sat near the bar area in the 2 seated tall tables and our food was really good as well. I wish there was more fish for the fish and chips though! I love it that much! The only reason I didn't give all 5 stars was it was just a bit too crowded for my comfort. But if you're all into it then it's perfect for you!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12
Becky H.,"Atlanta, GA",1,60,120,2.0,11/20/2017,"Truly awful service. The restaurant was nearly empty and I still got barely any attention from wait staff. The waiter ignored me for a while. When my food came out, I still hadn't gotten my drink so I asked for it. The food was okay - nothing special. The salad was drenched in dressing - way too much!  When I was finished, the waiter took my plate and didn't bring my bill. I asked for it next time I saw him and he gave me the wrong check. This whole time he was organizing cutlery and stacking cups. They should really be doing this in the back of the restaurant, and servers shouldn't be doing this when there are customers. Not somewhere I'll go again at the airport.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12
Ashley B.,"Phoenix, AZ",60,10,17,3.0,1/1/2018,"I wasn't expecting fine dining at this airport location, but the food came out somewhat cold. My daughter had boneless wings and fries and I had the French dip. The fries were lukewarm and the wings were down right cold. My daughter didn't seem to mind, as she is not picky. No time to send things back when you have to make your flight, so we ate it and ran to make our connection. In the plus side, we had a nice view of the runway which my daughter enjoyed !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12
Bill B.,"Madison, AL",1939,478,1562,2.0,6/25/2017,"The hostess mad me wait even though there were empty tables. I hate that. My family was in the restaurant business and we would have fired employees for not quickly seating customers. Empty tables means no revenue. Once seated, the lazy waitress decided to talk to me and the table next to me at the same time. She wanted to save time and explain the menu and take drink orders only once. They were slow to seat everyone, now they are in a hurry to take orders? The couple at the table next to me and I just shook our heads once the waitress left. I ordered the chicken fingers and fries. It was just fried food, nothing special. The customer service was the primary issue during this visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12

Jennifer H.,"San Diego, CA",9,134,580,1.0,6/25/2017,"HORRIBLE!  I know this is an airport (Concourse E) but come on I need some edible food. I received one of the worst breakfasts of my life. My ""orange juice"" was yellow, not orange. I think it was instant and made from a powder. It didn't even taste like Tang or Sunny D. My food arrived on a chipped plate. The fruit was one wilted strawberry. The inside of my omelette was cold and had old looking broccoli.

I had a 3 hour delay for my next flight to Tampa, FL and I was starving! Luckily, I walked passed by TGIF's and I was like yes please! I was immediately sat down and I ordered a platter that had buffalo wings, baked potatoes, celery, and fries. It may not sound much, but it is extremely filling! Delicious every bite and every dip!

Keila K.,"Atlanta, GA",175,183,548,4.0,8/28/2017,"Although it's been a while since I've eaten  at TGI Friday's, I was pleasantly surprised at the level of service and the attentiveness of the staff especially at an airport! After running from the train to TSA then the airline counter and unfortunately missing my flight, I was in desperate need of food. The hostess asked if I wanted a high top table but since I was traveling solo, I opted for a seat at the bar. Rocky, the bartender, immediately greeted me and took my drink order. I ordered a Kona beer and the spicy Black Bean & Avocado Burger for my entree. Food didn't take long to come; maybe 15 minutes. The sandwich was actually pretty good. It was the right level of spice. The fries were average; nothing that a little ketchup or honey mustard couldn't fix. The only issue was the amount of times Rocky used ""sweetheart"" and ""love"" when greeting her guests. It can be a bit annoying when used excessively or when she'd acknowledge a guest 2 or 3x her age!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12

Would've been better off just ordering from Mickey d's and getting my beer elsewhere. The seats and tables were super sticky and the restaurant was super crowded. Actually saw some people jet once they got it because the place stunk.

Kate F.,"Decatur, GA",65,144,868,3.0,10/13/2016,Not bad food and beer selection.  The staff was not the most efficient and the bartender was rude.

Airport food can be so-so and while we just ordered an appetizer platter and iced tea, the food tasted fantastic. Airports can be stressful, but the service was very friendly and attentive!!!  The menu was the same as other Fridays locations and offered plenty of appetizers, salads, soups, burgers, steaks, chicken dishes and desserts. In addition to all the great food, they had a full bar!

Perle N.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",168,63,95,1.0,3/11/2017,"The last time I went to a Friday's was 7 years ago. The reason why I never returned is because the service was so terrible that I did not want to give it another shot. Years later, I come across one at the airport and decide to play nice. First, they take 5 minutes to plan where they were going to sit us when the restaurant was practically empty. We finally get a seated. I ordered a Henny strawberry and my boyfriend gets an ice tea. We were getting ready to order wings and they told us that they only had bone-less wings-- not my favorite. I said ok can we please have 2 more minutes. The waitress came back 15 MINUTES later. I did not even want to order anymore at this point considering the fact that we'd been traveling all day. Anyway, we nicely told our waitress that we were no longer interested. We get hit with a $15 bill for an ice tea and one alcoholic drink at TGI???? LOL. I am just over this place and will no longer give it a shot.

Joyce X.,"Columbus, OH",36,55,109,2.0,12/2/2015,"Stopped by for dinner on a 3-hour layover. Service: Both the hostess and waitress were very kind. I was seated immediately and asked for a drink order. Additionally, throughout my meal, the waitress came to check up on me frequently which was nice. Atmosphere: It was dark, the floor was sticky, and it smelled like dirty mop water everywhere. Food: I had a peach sangria, potstickers, and the pecan-crusted chicken salad. The sangria was good but very expensive ($12, but it's the airport so I'm not surprised). The potstickers themselves were tasty, but they gave me hardly any of the sauce at all (probably 1/2 a teaspoon's worth). Also the sauce was advertised as a ""Szechwan dipping sauce"". It's just soy sauce, don't kid yourself. The salad was probably the most disappointing of all. I asked for no cranberries or bleu cheese. Guess what it came with? Yep, you guessed it. Also, the chicken felt like it was destroyed in the microwave. I cut neither cut into it with my (plastic) knife, nor bite into it with my teeth. Anyways, I left the waitress a good tip for the service but there's nothing else I'd come back for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=40
Maya B.,"Sacramento, CA",3,90,25,1.0,5/20/2017,"LAKEA provided the worst customer service ever! Came in first thing in the am after a long delay for my flight and even though it was the start of her day she seemed miserable. After being seated which was immediate the restaurant had just opened and only 3tables filled including us. She seemed to give the manager some backchat regarding her placement of our seat. She had on a jacket and no name tag so I had to find out from another waitress whom actually had on a name tag and seemed ready and happy to be at work. In any event...no refill on our drinks, never came by to check and see if the food we received was to our liking, no smile no welcome she seemed tired and it's the beginning of her shift. Our food was delicious no complaints there and other waitresses seemed more than happy to be at work and glad to help where she fell short.

Nasha W.,"Sierra Vista, AZ",45,453,281,2.0,5/23/2015,"I have been to several airport TGI Friday's  and they haven't been bad at all. This one in particular was mediocre at best...but what can I say, we were hungry.  We received a warm welcome from the hostess and our waitress was also very friendly but the food was lacking. The restaurant itself had a funny smell and the floor was a bit dirty/messy.  So yea, back to the food. I ordered the pecan crusted chicken salad and my husband ordered the Jack Daniels chicken and shrimp with sweet potato fries. These are our usual go-to dishes but they were not that great here. The pecan crusted chicken tasted like it was fried (and at one point might have been crispy) and then nuked. Same goes for the Jack Daniels entree. The Jack Daniels shrimp were not crispy at all. The sweet potato fries were kind of limp and soggy and possibly undercooked.       Another thing is that if you really have to go to the bathroom you better make a run for it across the food court because there are no restrooms here. Really the highlight of our visit was the kindness of Cory, our waiter. He even asked if we wanted dessert (a big plus in a very busy establishment).  I doubt I'll return here for food but I'm thinking for drinks it wouldn't be too bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=40

I can not believe this.  The staff on Sunday Aug 28, 2016 needs to go through training on how to treat a customer.  Never will I eat at a Friday's again because of this location.  I would usually go to Friday's 3 times a week.  Now I never will go again due to the unprofessionalism of the  bar tender that treated me like dirt under her finger nail.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=40

We sat down, ordered right away, and we're out in 40 minutes. But we did tell our server that we needed to be rushed ahead of time. She was very helpful, I'm sure she's used to that.  The service was great, ours was so friendly and nice. Everyone around you is hustling and bustling but it's an airport.  The only complaint I had was in my food. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, and it was supposed to be served on multigrain bread. It came on a hamburger bun. Not the end of the world, just much unhealthier for me. But what the heck, I was still on vacation. It did taste delicious and my fries were great. My husband ate every last one I didn't finish.

One of the things I enjoy at some airport bars is when they have plugs to charge devices at the bar or when they have good room for your carry on bags to keep safe by you or hang.  Unfortunately they don't have any of these here.  It was also not very spacious, so I can see that if the restaurant was packed, that it could be a bit tight to fit your bags and other people's bags in safely while still having a comfortable amount of room to eat and drink in.   It's in a convenient place right at the entrance to the international terminal, and it's at least a better alternative to all the fast food restaurants in the food court across the hallway from it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=20

The service was downright bad. Our server was rude, never made eye contact, dropped our drinks, food & tickets at our table w/o looking at us at all as she walked by. Our ticket was actually tossed at our table. When we received our me we flagged our waitress down to ask for a real steak knife. She actually came towards our table, but not to it and spoke to us with a mouth full of food. Our steaks had a slab of frozen flavored butter on top, not melted at all... not even warm or soft; frozen solid. Obviously, the steak was cool barely warm. The broccoli was downright cold and the mashed potatoes were lukewarm. When we arrived at the restaurant we had an hour & 15 min to eat.

Johnny V.,"Aurora, IL",67,158,262,4.0,4/23/2016,"I think the fact that a business is located in an airport should be an important thing to take into consideration when reviewing; if I had had this exact experience OUTSIDE of the airport, I would have gone with three stars.  The truth is that I'm not a Fridays kind of guy; the food isn't terrible or anything, it's just okay, but if I'm going spend money on a meal I want better than okay; however, when I had several hours to waste and knew that I needed edible food and a drink, Fridays seemed perfect. What I've come to expect from an airport restaurant is pretty decent food, pretty expensive prices for both food and drink, long waits for food and drinks, and slow service; in THIS particular environment, Fridays has done better by me than pretty much any other airport restaurant.  Now I'm not really familiar with Fridays, so I can't really say anything about how the food here stacks up, but I'm pretty sure the menu was reduced; some pages in their menu only had a few items.  I ended up ordering a ribeye (which was actually cooked the way asked) with cheddar mashed potatoes and spinach, and I have to say that I enjoyed my meal.  Again, it wasn't anything spectacular, but it was better than I had expected, and a whole lot better than airport food can be.  The only other thing to note is that you're given a plastic fork to cut your steak, which obviously isn't ideal, but is something you simply have to accept--it's in an airport (although even at Ohare they'll give you a damn butter knife, which is better than a plastic one, but what can you do?). The whiskey and apple drink I had was also really good, but exactly what I remember from Fridays cocktails back when I used to drink at a nearby Fridays--they're very, very sugary.  I ordered a second one but couldn't finish it because it was too sugary, not because I was drunk, so maybe next time I'll order one cocktail and then switch to something else if I wan't another drink.  I also have to mention my server Nemari, who was awesome--she's a doll--she was friendly, professional, and attentive; I have never been checked up on as frequently, and with such great timing, in an airport--she almost made me forget I was in one!  By the time I was all done and settled up , a little more than an hour had passed since I had gone in, which to me was incredible; I took my time before ordering and ate rather lazily.  If I had been in a hurry I could easily have shaved twenty minutes off of that. My bill, for the steak and two 'signature' drinks, was a little more than forty bucks plus tip, which isn't much more than I spent at another airport restaurant for a glass of wine and two appetizers.  The service was great, and food came out quickly; what more could I ask from a restaurant in general, let alone one in an airport?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=20

Additionally our waitress was incredibly friendly and funny, which is always a perk at the end of a very long business trip.

Quite tasty tho. Also they have drink specials Monday-Thursday. Who doesn't like $3 drinks that won't kill you? Not this lush. Lol To recap: there's nothing great about this place, but there's also nothing that would stop me from going back either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=80
Gamaya L.,"Cedar Hill, TX",0,5,,5.0,6/30/2016,I think its pretty well understood that airport food is airport food. Standard fare but nothing spectacular. What really matters is service. Stopped in while waiting for a fellow traveler and ordered what I like to call a Coffee Supreme. Lexy greeted me with a warm smile and took my order right away.

NK N.,"Phoenix, AZ",253,217,145,4.0,8/20/2013,"This is a TOGO review.  As per my previous review, I had a layover here in ATL so I figured let me finish up my dinner otherwise it would be too late for my dinner time.  I pick up a pizza for my princess and I was heading back to my gate. As I was passing by, I noticed this place. It was packed so I thought it would take long for them to bring out my food. So I just stop by from the walkway and ask them how long it would take them to bring me the food? The lady said, fifteen minutes. I am happy man! Now comes the tough part, deciding on what to eat? I was handed a menu to look at and my first glance, I couldn't find anything vegetarian so I asked the lady, do you have anything vegetarian items and she suggested black bean burger with guac :) so I ordered it and paid for it. I went to drop off that pizza to my princess and came back to pick up my food. I had to wait few more mins so I decided to people watch!  This restaurant looked pretty neat and clean from the outside. I saw smiles on employes face which to me is a good sign that they are not going to mess up my order.  The lady came back and said my food is ready. I got my food, I checked and made sure  it was black bean burger. They gave me enough napkins, ketchup and they game me two wipes to clean after.  -1 for not having salt on the fries or giving couple of salt and pepper pouches.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=80

Scott D.,"Glendale, AZ",800,557,266,5.0,8/21/2012,"My wife and I had a great meal at the T.G.I. Friday's at the E terminal. We split a rack of ribs and substituted the sweet potato fries for the coleslaw and also had regular fries (the sweet potato fries were for the wife). She had a strawberry lemonade which was excellent; I can't recall tasting one any better.  The ribs were easy to cut up with the plastic knife. It took me awhile to figure out why the plastic knife then it hit me that the TSA was afraid restaurant customers would try to shank airline personnel once they're 30,000 miles above ground. So what's the justification for the metal fork? Enough of my rant.  The server cut our ribs in half and served it on two plates with the regular and sweet potato fries evenly split up. The BBQ Sauce was just right. The only problem is that my wife almost eat all of her ribs. I was a little off my game since I was tired from all of the running around on our trip to Atlanta. I finally said to her after she eat about half of her ribs that she hadn't touched her fries. This suggestion worked, because she started to eat her fries and couldn't finish the last rib. So this place will be my go to restaurant at Hartsfield. Terminal E is not crowded like the other terminals, I would say the foot traffic was about 10% of what the other terminals were experiencing. We tried to eat at some other restaurants in other terminals before we just decided to go to our terminal and see what was there.

We were there for breakfast and only when they came to take the order did they notify us that they were out of eggs and only had egg whites. Nearly everything on the breakfast menu depends on eggs. But we had already been here for 15 minutes and felt committed. In retrospect, we should have bailed out here. Roughly 20 minutes later, our food finally arrives. My pancakes were OK but my wife's egg white and toast was cold so it seems like the kitchen doesn't cook orders together.

We were promptly seated and even though the kitchen had closed about 20 minutes prior, they still served us. Our waitress was incredibly friendly, fast and accurate. The food, however, really leaves something to be desired. I ordered the gardenburger, which should be something that's not too difficult to screw up, right?! It's T.G.I. Friday's, for shit's sake. They just need to open some overly packaged container, stick it in a microwave, and serve it to me in a timely manner for the low price of $14. How difficult is that? Welp, apparently it's pretty difficult. The patty itself seemed really overcooked; it was dry, tasteless, and somewhat freezer burnt (I don't think a lot of people in Atlanta order gardenburgers). The bun for the burger was really dry as well, and extremely cold in the middle. Maybe the microwave was broken.

I was traveling with an ear infection and I wanted to be good and drunk on the plane in case my ear drum blew, I wanted the pain to be a bit numb. I was two beers shy of drinking a GALLON of beer. I missed the mark because my flight came due and not because they wanted to cut me off. They actually offered to get me within one but I didn't have the time to finish it off. The place was busy and popping but the service remained solid while I was there.  In general when I'm at Fridays, you have to get the pot stickers. They have the second best pot stickers on the planet. The best pot stickers on the planet (excluding Japan, because I haven't been there yet) are in J-Town in Paris.

Sparky T.,"Latham, NY",10,231,9,3.0,12/29/2012,TGIF is a decent choice for a restaurant chain. At this airport location it can get quite busy. Our recent visit was just OK. Service was slow (but we had time) and the steak my wife ordered 'rare' came to us 'raw'. They did provide a suitable replacement.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=120
Meg G.,"Washington, DC",146,450,66,3.0,5/12/2012,"Just how do you save a starved couple that has less than 30 minutes to board a flight?  Why, by standing outside of your restaurant and yelling (while smiling at the same time) for them to come on in and get a hot meal.  She was cute, bubbly and promised to have our food on the table in 15 minutes.  Fried green beans were nice & crispy, and I couldn't really ""taste"" anything else for shoving it down my throat.  The drinks were on par, and the food was piping hot!  Customer service was superb, and   the jog to the concourse was that much more fun...  Thanks Friday's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=120
Mustafa Z.,"Acworth, GA",2,4,,1.0,5/26/2013,Bad and slow service. Mixed up my card with someone else's bill! Never got my food on time and still had to pay for it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=120
Amanda E.,"Alexandria, VA",99,282,137,4.0,3/27/2010,"Four stars for an airport establishment, three stars for the restaurant itself. We were promptly seated and served at this busy ATL eatery. The restaurant has lots of food court options, but it was nice to sit down and be served. Very friendly service who checked back often - not always the norm at the airport. Food was as to be expected for a TGI Fridays, although fresher than I usually find at the airport. Some TGi's in airports have an extremely limited menu, however this one had most of the menu available.  No power outlets around most seating areas if that's what you need...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=120
Mark B.,"Atlanta, GA",24,149,,1.0,3/29/2010,"I only went here because the Sojourner bar down the concourse was serving beer in plastic cups. Sat down in the bar area, there were 3 guys that looked like employees milling around, I guess they are bartender/servers, one finally came over and had not so much as a smile, a welcome, a what can I get you, just a frown. Thats all we got from all three. Hey, I have bad days too, but really! I hate to be mean but there was also a female server in the area, who did not serve us but passed our table very often, who was wider than the aisles. What that meant was every couple of minutes we got slammed by her big hips.  All in all unpleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=120
Terriah P.,"Miami Beach, FL",0,36,2,3.0,1/5/2013,"Free WIFI! Are you kidding me. This is an oasis in ATL, (the only airport on earth not offering free wifi.... cheapskates)..... But not to worry TGI FRIDAY'S is here!!!!! For a review on the actual restraunt, truth is I hate this place. Really small, the bartenders aren't like at DCA (where they can make you any drink on the fly, even something you made up yourself). It makes me feel like I am being held prisoner with a bunch of other stressed out travelers. But now that I know they have wifi, I will be hanging out somewhere close by. Thanks for the public service TGIF, I will continue to frequent all of your other locations!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=120
Kelsey M.,"Centerville, OH",35,8,,3.0,3/4/2013,"Definitely the best airport meal I have had . Service was good - our guy Melvin may have forgotten to put in my drink when I ordered it because it took some time - but the Berri sour was fantastic . Food was prompt for the most part , and tasted good . No issues with this little stop on our way home .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-12?start=120
