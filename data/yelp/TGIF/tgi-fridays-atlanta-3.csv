Jennifer L.,"Chamblee, GA",248,64,3,3.0,8/24/2009,"As the saying goes it is what it is....and it's right around the corner for me at work, and convenient, and they have this promotion going on until 8/31 where each of you and your party get $5 off the meal.  (So you might be paying like $2-3 for a meal - don't you pay that at McD (minus the tip of course).  Their fried green beans with horseradish sauce is pretty tasty.  And they have this 5 cheese macaroni with chicken and bacon (oh so kosher) that won on some Food Network Challenge that is actually pretty good (especially when feeling that need for comfort food).  I've been fond of the their pecan crusted chicken salad as well.  Of course I am not a chain type of restaurant gal -but for what it is - i't's not all that bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-3
Ivan S.,"Atlanta, GA",243,617,666,1.0,9/8/2008,"Hating you has become such a cliché, Friday's, that I hesitate to do so.  But your food is so craptacular, your lunch service so damn slow, despite your claims to the contrary, that you make it so easy.  The last time I was there (about two years ago), I was eating with a group of co-workers.  Waiting on my order was like waiting on evolution. Our trisomy, unitasking waiter helped the matter exactly 0.0%.  I thought my co-workers were going to leap from their chairs and impale him on exactly 15 pieces of flair.  The manager tried to make good on our discontent by giving us free dessert coupons which necessitated us returning to this misbegotten place of misery and despair.  No thanks.  I'd rather suffer a thousand paper cuts on my balls then dip them in lemon juice than suffer the indignity of darkening their doorway again. Friday's the restaurant is less like Fridays the Movie and more like Jesus' Friday of the beatings and the stabbings and the crown of thorns.  And with about the same end result.  But forgive them Father, for they know not what they do...though it does earn them one star in the process. Praise be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-atlanta-3
