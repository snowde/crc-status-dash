Steven S H C.,"Denver, CO",747,647,1876,4.0,11/30/2012,"Last nights visit to this location was my 5th or 6th within 2 month time. Since I am in the quest for trying to find that perfect chicken wings, I did order and paid close attention to the flavor and such.  Well.. not much I can tell you about the oven baked ones..  you can't order crispy.. and its about the same Franks Original Red Hot Sauce flavor.    Why am I giving whopping 4 stars? 1.  very clean and new and lots of TVs at the bar area.  Lot better than Old Chicago or Chillis nearby. 2.  very very friendly waitress, bartender and the hostess.. and the usual 2 stars for just being there..  I m coming back to watch the games, try the cheap happy hour food menu (limited but still good) and enjoy the attention from the serving staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2
David B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",94,313,539,4.0,7/14/2014,This has to be one of the better TGI Fridays. They make an excellent selection of drinks the food specials are vast and always changing. We spent two nights trying out different drinks different snacks and they did a great job of working to maximize our club member benefits. The one negative that saved them from getting a five star rating was there poor job of greeting and welcoming guests to the restaurant. Both nights we had to walk in and find our own server to seat us and the manager who came by was far from welcoming. The one time we asked the manager for some help it looked like we were bothering the person more than being served by them as part of their duties as a manager. So if you stick to the waitresses and bartenders you'll have a phenomenal evening with terrific food and outstanding drinks. Just remember you're going to have to seat yourself my friend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2
Jason J.,"Centennial, CO",109,970,38,3.0,11/27/2011,"TGIF has never been one of my favorites, but came to this one near work for lunch the other day. It was at an off time so they weren't too busy. The server was fairly attentive, refilling the drinks when needed, altho it took forever to take our order. My well-done burger was actually cooked the way I like it, surprisingly, and the fries were okay.  I made the mistake of visiting the restroom on my way out, which was to my total dismay. The urinal was busted and 1 of the toilets looked like a stinky bomb went off. It was long enough after the lunch rush that someone should have cleaned that up long before I went in there. Disgusting!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2
Kenny C.,"Aurora, CO",3,9,7,5.0,7/30/2014,This tgif's is now closed. It closed on the 26th of July they didn't renew there lease I have no idea what is moving into its place. I loved coming here everyone was great!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2
Megan A.,"Parker, CO",9,106,9,2.0,4/14/2013,"The food was quite good but the service was awful. Our server came to get our order and when we asked if they had certain shakes available she didn't answer. She just started recommending appetizers. When we asked about other things on the menu, she still avoided answering our questions and gave us more recommendations for things we weren't interested in. When she brought the shake to me, it was not the one I ordered. She didn't acknowledge this at all. She didn't return for a long time and seemed really impatient and flighty. She would seem engaged talking to us and then all of a sudden would walk away. The food was good and we enjoyed that. We didn't get drink refills and had to keep stopping other servers to ask for things like extra napkins. The dish I ordered, I'd had many times in the past and it always comes with a side sauce. It wasn't brought out with that this time. I asked if they had a side sauce and the waitress said ""Yes, it usually comes with that. Do you want it?"" Of course I do, that's why I'm asking about it! If I can get the food to go, I will go back because the food was ok. Otherwise, I'll just make sure that I don't sit in this server's section if we go back. I doubt we will. At the end of the meal, she was complaining to us about how she doesn't have a car and has to walk to the bus station because she doesn't live in that city. She spent a bit of time telling us about her life, but didn't have time for us before that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2
Justin S.,"Aurora, CO",25,18,,4.0,7/26/2014,"Great atmosphere, not long of a wait, food was good other than the batter of the shrimp. Tasted very deep fried when eating them. Ultimate margarita was awesome! Definitely recommend that. I had the 6 oz sirloin which was cooked just as I asked and the dipping sauce was very yummy. All the staff I came in contract with were very nice and courteous. Would definitely go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2
Melanie S.,"Oakland, CA",45,150,1,3.0,6/26/2012,"About a million years ago, I used to work for a TGI Fridays. This was back when we had to wear at least 15 pieces of ""flair"" and I still have a bizarre collection of ridiculous buttons and tights from this experience. The restaurant deserves a star just for allowing their staff to dress somewhat normally now.  So I didn't eat at a Friday's for about 20 years. That's not completely true but the very few times I have eaten there in the last 20 years it's been under protest. But then I heard this rumor that Friday's wasn't too bad these days so one late afternoon after getting hot and dirty at the off leash dog park across the street, the family decided to give it a try.  You know what, Friday's isn't too bad these days. Their menu is still stupidly long - no one needs this many options and you know when a restaurant offers that much diversity it isn't going to do anything great. But they do have a few decent things. Their Jack Daniels grill is good and they've always done pasta fairly well. They seem to be able to cook meat to your requested temperature too which is a rarity for these types of restaurants. There is a good selection on the kid's menu and service is okay.  I would not recommend Fridays for a romantic evening out but for dinner or lunch with  the family, it's a decent choice. It is very inexpensive too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2

Travis S.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",0,28,5,5.0,7/22/2014,"Judi is awesome!  I like how she remembered my name immediately.  There are not many late night spots in Aurora, but if you're looking for one consider this Fridays.  If Judi is working, then don't hesitate!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2
Chuck L.,"Placentia, CA",378,207,45,4.0,4/18/2014,"Some of us family members went for some appetizers and drinks, and our server was excellent! The only ding on the night was that they didn't have the beer that I ordered which they thought they did because they switched out the tap to something else. It was fine. I substituted for the Sam Adams Seasonal beer and it was good too. We ordered the tostada nachos and the Jack Daniels Sampler. Between the 6 of us, it wasn't enough appetizers, so we ordered the potato skins. The potato skins need to be thinned out a bit more, because it was super thick with a lot of potato still left on the skin, but the older folks at the table seemed to like it, so another pass there. But more than anything, the server who served us made our night, because of her excellent service. I've been to a lot of different TGIF's in different states, but this was a great experience. I'll be back when I'm in town again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2
Tiffany B.,"Fort Collins, CO",178,11,7,3.0,5/13/2014,"Food was good, and my mango lemonade was awesome. I don't drink and it taste great.. Our server wasn't great though. She was in either in a bad mood or just didn't want to be there. She would drop something off without making eye contact and barley look at us. She pretty much avoided our table because she was so behind. Not sure if it was her fault but she did sit with the girls next to us and chat for awhile. Food was good and drinks. Service was horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2
Phung L.,"Aurora, CO",119,277,69,4.0,10/2/2013,Bar food is bar food and you don't come here expecting gourmet dishes. The reason why I like this place is because their happy hour menu has remained consistent while other places omit many of the popular items from theirs. Though not quite of a selection when it comes to beers to choose from on tap. Vanilla bean cheesecake is always amazing here and I simply cannot get enough of it!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2
Lisa H.,"Aurora, CO",0,4,1,1.0,9/19/2013,"The one star is for the food. I ordered the chicken strips and a ""signature margarita"" and am not happy.  Service was fast and good, but the chicken was chewy and my husbands steak was also less tab average. Overpriced food. This place is only good for a beer and appetizer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2
J C.,"Denver, CO",0,17,,2.0,7/5/2012,"This is the 2nd time we've eaten here and I won't be back.  The service is marginal, the kitchen took over 20 minutes to make a cobb salad, and the potato skins, a Friday's staple, were bitter.  The fudge on the brownie for desert was grainy.  No wonder this place was quiet during the dinner hour. For the same cost, you can go a mile up Parker Rd to Cornerstar and have much better meals at places like Cheddars or the Dusty Boot steak house.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2
Kristin W.,"Aurora, CO",138,42,9,3.0,4/24/2011,"I've been to this location a few times, more often for bingo than for anything else. I've been there for lunch/late night drinks a few times, but the most recent experiences have been for bingo. I much prefer this locations' bingo nights than the one out by the mall. I hear that the one out by Aurora mall has changed the bingo rules/layout since I decided not to go anymore, but I have yet to give them another chance. I prefer the crowd at this one. They are all 20-something middle classers, not the scary ghetto loud people I had to get used to with the other one. There's also a lot more people there to play bingo, so the odds are much tougher, but I would say it's worth it because of the atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2

Kim S.,"Aurora, CO",0,22,1,1.0,4/2/2009,"Ok, my husband and I first visited TGIF about a year ago, when the first Ultimate Recipe Challenge was being aired on the Food Network. We figured it would be interesting to get to try some of the recipes we'd seen. This was mistake number one. We got there, and stood around for something like eight or nine minutes before the hostess deemed us worthy to be seated. Then we sat. And sat. And sat. I am the impatient type, and would have walked out, but my husband (darn it. ;) ) is very patient, and tries to see things from the ""other side"". He pointed out that the restaurant was very busy, and maybe the server was getting to us. Sure enough, after about ten or fifteen minutes or so, our server shows up to take our order. I ordered the eggplant lasagna, Chris ordered some form or other of steak. While we waited another good twenty or thirty minutes for our food, I tried to absorb the rather garish ""decor."" Now, for the record, I am not a fan of diners anyway. I don't ""get"" the random splashing of nostalgia, or absolutely COVERING the walls, ceiling, and even sometimes the tables, in - well - crap. I am a minimalist by nature, and I sincerely dislike clutter, so it is a rather uncomfortable experience to me to be in such a (there's just no nice way to say this) tacky atmosphere. Obviously, this was not my night to choose where we ate. Now, having ranted about most diners I've ever seen, I must say, TGI was a step up in tacky. It was almost as though whoever thought of this chain tried to mix the ""diner"" feel with the ""mid-range restaurant"" feel, and clashed them together in some horrifying little entourage of nostalgia and modern. It hurts the eyes. But then our food came, and I was really hoping that the food would make up for the garish atmosphere. Nope. My fried eggplant slices were lukewarm at best, and EXTREMELY oily, and the little mini lasagna noodles were ice cold, and also seemed to have been sitting in a bowl of olive oil until they were served. I had to use several napkins to attempt to actually dab some of the grease and oil off the food. Not a great experience for the palate. Chris's meal was also rather shameful, even for ""diner food."" Also lukewarm, it was extremely dry, and he had to take at least two or three sips of his soda to try to wash each bite down. The waitress we had was fairly good, though, once the rush of people thinned out, and fortunately, the drinks never ran dry. The second time we visited (We always try to give a place two shots before we give up), we had a couple friends with us. The hostess actually sat us immediately, which almost gave me heart failure. This time, the place was not nearly so full; actually, we could only count four tables with people in it. We waited for a good twenty minutes for anyone to show up and take at least our drink orders.... Nothing. We'd seen not one but three servers pass us by without a second glance. By this time, I was ready to leave and patronize elsewhere, but once again, more generous hearts prevailed. Jeff, one of our friends out with us, sought out the hostess, and asked if we were ever going to be served. She promptly disappeared into the back area, and ten minutes later, a scruffy guy appeared, with a halfway attempted apology to the tune of ""Sorry, guys, I didn't know you were out here, no one told me you were my table."" Now, this was one of the three servers who'd passed us by without a glance, and the immediate surrounding tables were all ""his."" Shouldn't it follow, then, that we'd be his area?? But I bit my tongue. Knowing this was doomed to be a long night, I ordered the strongest drink I could find, which actually sounded pretty good - The ultimate margarita. Lots of liquor with a splash of fruity. Can't possibly screw that up... Right? Chris ordered a coke with no ice (he rarely drinks when we are out), Ashley ordered a beer, and Jeff ordered another soda. I noticed the waiter wasn't writing anything down, but didn't really dwell on it, as many of the best servers we've had never scribbled a word. So then we waited some more.... By this time, we've been there nearly forty-five minutes, and haven't gotten our drinks, but who's counting, right?? So then, our ""superstar"" waiter reappears with two sodas, and plunks them right down on the table, causing quite a bit of soda to come flying out all over the table. At this point, I'm a little irate, as Chris's soda does, in fact, have ice, which he's not supposed to have in his drinks (really sensitive teeth, hence the ""no ice"" specification). Then our darling server waltzes over to Ashley and plunks her beer down. Wrong kind of beer. At this point, he bleerily looks at me and goes, ""oh, sorry, what did you order again?"" OK, deep breaths, Kim. No going off. So this time I order a white zif, as this is impossible to screw up. Tell the bartender to pour a glass and be done. The night just went downhill from there. Save yourself some aggravation and don't bother.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-2
