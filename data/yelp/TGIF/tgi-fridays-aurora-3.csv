Jean T.,"Sedalia, CO",0,2,,1.0,11/26/2017,"This place was FILTHY!  Tables, Windows seats...disgusting. food was over cooked . Ordered med burger, came out wells done and dry. The chips and salsa we ordered were over fried and I think left over from the previous day..not fresh. Even the onion rings were over cooked and hard as rocks. Won't be back. Only good thing was the margarita.  Should have taken a clue that there were only 5 cars in the lot at lunchtime on a weekend. Lesson learned..wont be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=20
Reiner L.,"Denver, CO",0,4,3,3.0,10/4/2016,"We came on a weekday afternoon and it was pretty busy, but the staff was very friendly and helpful. While we were waiting for our order (it took about 10 min until the food came) we even got free chips and salsa! I ordered the ""Classic Cheese Burger"" ($8.40) without cheese, so basically a hamburger. As you can see on the photo, the Burger and Fries looked pretty normal, nothing spectacular. This is probably the best description for the taste, too. First of all, they didn't ask me how I wanted the patty and it came medium-well. It tasted pretty 'old' and dry, the buns were even drier. The veggies were pretty fresh and tasty though. All in all I'm giving 3/5 stars, since the Burger was only average, the price below other Burger places and the service pretty nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=20

David B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",94,313,539,5.0,11/9/2015,"Well as you can see from the photos wow did we have a blast. The food was from the service was extremely courteous and friendly from the managers to the waitresses to the bartenders everybody was fully engaged in ensuring a fun filled evening. We deeply enjoyed ourselves watching the game and drinking to our hearts content. Having been there a number of times I can speak to the consistent nature of the food the drinks pretty much an all-around perfect mix for your dollar.  Sitting at the bar you're engaged by regulars from the working retail in the area, other restaurants, and the like.  Moving to the booth gives you the privacy and yet engagement from the staff that you would expect at a good restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=20

Masha Z.,"Denver, CO",127,96,262,1.0,5/21/2016,Came in on a Saturday afternoon. The hostess looked like she had no clue what was going on. She stood there for a good few mins before she actually asked how many of us were there. Since it was only my boyfriend and I and nobody else standing in the door I politely said two. She then proceed to just stand there and organized the menu. All while the place only had few tables taken. After ten mins we were finally seated.  The waiter spoke quietly and I had to ask him a few time to repeat himself. (The music was cranked up)so My boyfriend and I ended up just playing in our phones for most of the time there since we didn't want to scream across the table during the whole meal.  We ordered the all American burger and the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta. Burger was good however the pasta tasted just like a frozen pasta dinner not worth the $14 bucks.

David T.,"Tucson, AZ",0,3,,3.0,7/5/2017,"So I got the 12 dollar unlimited appetizers which is great.  What they dont tell you is that to make up for the money they spend on the appetizers they charge exorbitant prices on their drinks.  $10 for a margarita, come one, thats just price gouging.  Plus they dont put the prices on the menu so make sure you ask before hand, or youll be stuck with a far higher bill than you expected like I was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=20
Shelley N.,"Englewood, CO",0,1,,2.0,3/12/2017,"We went to try the endless apps. While our waitress was friendly, the speed of service was very slow. They seemed unprepared for a Friday night. After 2 rounds of appetizers, we had to finally ask our server for napkins and silverware, maybe those only come if you order an entree to eat there. After that, our waitress seemed a bit cold towards us, and asked us if we were ready to leave before even making sure we were finished ordering more food. We had ordered 2 entrees to take home with us, but found out after getting home, that one order was incorrect. Add in to all of that, some very obnoxious outbursts from the greeting staff and between wait staff, and I would not recommend this location unless you had no other options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=20

So we did. Service was great in the bar, food as always was excellent, we love fridays. What I did notice is that the server in the bar had to alert to hostess that their were customers to seat.

Cristina R.,"Northeast, Denver, CO",0,6,1,1.0,4/22/2017,So first off we got here about 12:25pm. The place was almost empty. We waited 10 minutes for a table. Why? Idk if there were plenty open. Any how. 15 minutes pass without being asked what we wanted to drink. Another server comes and apologizes for our server and takes our drink order. 7 minutes until we get our drinks. Another 12 minutes to get our order taken. It's 2 pm and still no food. No apology for the wait nothing.... never coming back to this location. I submitted the first paragraph before we left so this is an update. We had finally received our food and we weren't given silverware until after our food sat at our table and became cold. I had to use a fork to cut through my meat. No knife. My daughter had a cheddar broccoli soup and they gave her fries. Our server did apologize for it and said they'd bring one out. Never came out! Not once did she come by our table to see if the soup had came out or to see how we were doing. Crappy service for OK food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=20
Sonja K.,"Aurora, CO",68,2,,1.0,2/25/2017,This is probably the worst restaurant in aurora. When we came in the door the hostess was a stressed out mess saying they were under staffed and that she would clean off some tables then when she came back she was saying where did those old people go. The couple had just seated themselves. When we finally ordered we had potstickers as appetizer and they brought us fries. When we got our potsticker they were cold. Meal was ok but not great. The only thing that was really outstanding was the vanilla bean cheesecake. This place was loud and out of control. The loudest was the hostess. We won't be coming back.

All three burgers were incorrect. And one of them was a completely different dish and it was supposed to be. Our server told us the manager was buying out lunch since it took to long.  I asked to speak to him in the server told her she had no clue where he was.

The endless mozzarella sticks came out cold so we sent them back and the sauce you could tell had been sitting under the heat lamps awhile.

Everyone is done eating and my food still has not came, the waitress is no where to be seen, doesn't offer any refills. I've waited an hr and a half and still have no food, my whole family is already done eating, my husband asks her for the check and she brings that, I never got my food, our appetizers or any refills. I talked to the manager he was very nice and gave me food to go. Although I did not get to eat or enjoy my food it was nice of him but the wait staff sucks there.

Savanna D.,"Aurora, CO",0,5,1,2.0,6/27/2017,"The only thing that saved this from being a 1-Star was the stellar waitress behind the bar who was holding everything together. I don't expect much from a chain like TGI Fridays, Chili's, etc. I expect someone to seat you, your food to be what you expected, and to leave full with a 3 star experience. Not too difficult. Came to this location on a Friday night (fairly early). There was a line of people waiting to speak to a hostess, which was never anywhere to be seen. We walked into the bar and asked if it was first come, first serve instead - yes. Tried to sit down twice while someone from behind the bar shouted ""someone's sitting there""...and ""someone is sitting there too"". Gee, thanks for your help. On the third try we find seats at the bar. We promptly get a beer and watch as fellow diners Dine n' Dash (like a**holes!), and another fellow diner orders ""the cheapest beer you have"" and a side of free orange she promptly scarfed as a meal instead of ordering food. There was basically zero interaction with staff. The fellow diners were...questionable. The restaurant ""ran out of onions"" and our food was served cold with no follow-up. Much less than I expected from this establishment. Annnnnd I won't be returning to a TGI Fridays. (I live in the area, but this crowd was rough.

The waiter came 3 times total to the table, service was super slow. I got the salmon and the spinach and even the spinach was super salted! My husband got a burger and the fries were cold...he asked for another side and it took over a half hour to get him a side of fries. By that time the burger was also cold. They were not busy at all, maybe 1/4 of the restaurant was full so it should not have been that slow. Even our drinks were terrible. I got the peach sangria and it tasted like simple syrup and then I got a Rita-shaker that tasted heavily salted also. Do these people not have freaking taste buds?!

Ali B.,"Cheyenne, WY",10,13,,2.0,3/18/2017,"I don't think I have ever had service this poor at a restaurant before. First off, they told us the wait would be 25 minutes (it's a Saturday night just before 630 pm) and told us we could go get drinks at the bar and wait for a table. We said we would do that. It took us forever to order drinks (they didn't have a beer on the menu I wanted and my friend was indecisive) so by the time we got our drinks we were wondering when my name would be called. We were halfway done with our drinks when my friend decides to check in with the hostess and see how much longer it would be. Apparently she had called my name and someone else took our table! Super rude. To be fair, they were busy so she probably didn't remember my face. They gave us the next table since someone took ours. They also carded us as we brought our drinks to the table with us even though the bartender carded us at the bar. We ordered the spinach and queso dip for an app. This probably took 45 minutes to come to our table. Our servers apologized profusely. The dip itself was good, as was the salsa and guac that came with it. They didn't give us enough chips and the servers cleared the app instead of asking if we wanted more chips (we finished the dip, but not the sides). We then ordered our entrees and my friend got another drink. I waited for a little bit before getting another drink. She got her drink (she asked for a strawberry mango margarita and got a mango margarita). After hers came out I ordered the same, but mine was served with a lime and significantly stronger than my friend's. We had probably been waiting on our entrees for 45 minutes at this point and finally my dinner was delivered. The manager came by after this and apologized for how long it had taken. He said he would comp my friend's food (buffalo wings- flats only) and would comp a portion of mine since I was supposed to have a tomato mozzarella salad with it and they offered me a garden salad instead. The server didn't ask what dressing I wanted and asked if ranch was okay. I said it was fine. A few minutes later a salad completely drenched in ranch came out and I had to dump it on my plate so I could see what was underneath the white sea of dressing. My friend had a bite of my Mac and cheese (enjoyable, but nothing spectacular) and ordered some for herself. I was darn near done my meal when my friend's wings (also enjoyable and all flats as requested) came out and they also served her a garden salad. They gave her no dressing with her salad or wings. Like me, silverware was delivered after the meal came out. It took another 5-10 minutes for her to get the ranch she had to request. Her Mac and cheese never came. After everything was said and done (we had been at the restaurant for 2 and a half hours), they made our bill $10. Not bad for a meal, 2 apps, and 4 drinks. However, when the bills came back (separate as requested) we both had to pay $10 which was not what the total bill said. I felt a little jipped, but I still paid way less than I would have otherwise so I didn't say anything. Our servers also asked us multiple times to come back and apologized for the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=40

The mashed potatoes seemed the same as they used to be. The Mac and cheese was missing the cheese part. It was just hard penne pasta. My wife ordered the potato skins, mozzarella sticks, and boneless chicken wings in the Memphis BBQ flavor. The wings were decent. The potato skins were missing the potato part.

Two bartenders, one had to come over to get our drink orders started while our server struggled, but Im not sure why.  Friday's now offers, ""Happy Hour all day, every day."" which means there are $5 and $6 drinks and (limited) apps all day...its really nothing special. Id rather have all the apps half priced a few hours a day.  Just in for a quick snack, we ordered two beers ($6/ea) and two apps: Jack Daniel's Chicken Strips (an old fav of mine), and mozz sticks ($5). They apps came out lukewarm, and both were better in my distant memory of liking this place. The mozz sticks were really creamy, they didnt taste like cheese, it just kind of felt like cheese and looked almost like cheese. I don't need to go back, they don't even have good happy hour, for it being ""all day.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=60

Vanessa F.,"Aurora, CO",0,3,3,2.0,7/4/2015,"We used to LOVE TGIF! We were weekly visitors at the Parker/Chambers location. We now have visited the Aurora Mall location and every single time we visit, we are sorely disappointed, not only with service but also the food.  We came on 4th of July around 10pm and it was empty because the fireworks display had just ended.  My Husband ordered: Ribeye and shrimp, with loaded mashed potatos and cesar salad. Salad never came. Ribeye was supposed to be medium rare, it was well-done. Mashed potatos were not supposed to have chives, as my Husband is allergic to them and we told our waitress this. We also asked for extra Jack Daniel's sauce and offered to pay extra. Well, mashed potatos came with chives and Jack Daniel's sauce didn't come as requested. In her defense, she did offer to replace his meal, but as we had already waited 30 mins and were starving, we decided to take it as is.  I ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp and asked for extra bruschetta. Instead of fresh, succulent tomatos, they splattered extra marinara all over.  The waitress said she would bring ice tea refills 3x...and never did. My Husband had to get up and go to the wait station where she was chatting and got it himself. Manager came by and saw this, he did not say one word at all.  They did comp the salad, so that was good. Overall, the experience was not what I expect from TGIF. Even our neighboring table complained. Their apps came out before drinks. Also, they asked the busser who brought out their apps for another round of potstickers. Busser said she would let server know. Server came about 7 mins later, they asked if their extra order was placed. Server said nobody told her.  At one point, a kitchen staff member with a hair net came to serve us. Clearly this restaurant has no communication within itself. Its staff is poorly trained at best and even management can't be bothered with customer concerns.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=60

Angel A.,"Aurora, CO",0,9,,1.0,5/24/2015,"Usually I take my kids to Chills every Saturday. This Saturday we wanted to try something different.   We always self seat at the bar so we can get half price apps, after we were already seated the host approached us and asked if everyone at the table was 21? It was obvious my kids 11 and 13 weren't. He was just being a smart ass and said there is sign that says they need to be 21, I told him I've never seen the sign so on our way to being escorted out he rudely pointed out the sign. I told him he didn't have to rub it in my face and he said i just want to make sure you see it this time. We were seated and waited about 5 mins before anyone came to get a drink order. There were about 7 other tables, 2 were wrapping it up. Once our food got to out to our table we had to wait another 5 minutes for silverware.  I ordered the pick 3 with pretzels, potato skins. NO BACON and mozzarella sticks. All came cold, sauces had skinned over. Pretzels were burnt, skins were full of bacon. I asked waitress if they looked burnt to her, she said nope. She took me back, they came back more burnt and with cheese sauce filled with bacon. She said this is what color they usually are. I told her to take a bite. She refused.

The bacon wasn't very crisp. The sandwich was over 1000 calories. Our waitress was nice and attentive but it took a while for our table to get served. We were seated in the bar area because the hostess said the wait for the main dining area was going to be very long (even though it looked like all tables except for 2 were empty).

My girl friend wanted fried cheese sticks and it turns out they were out. I understand it happens but I wish didn't take 30 mins to find about it once our other food came out. Don't know who's mistake it was the waiter or kitchen but someone dropped the ball. Our waiter wasn't very attentive. He also forgot to bring us napkins and silverware once our food did show up. It was a little busy but not to the point where every table was filled up. I think he could sense we weren't very happy with our service and begin to have an attitude with us and became very short. Once we asked for the check he returned with and just dropped it (not placed) it on the table and walked off without saying a word to any of us. We immediately went to locate a manager but I don't think he really understood what the situation. We weren't asking for anything to be free but he didn't do anything to improve the situation. So we just paid our bill and left.  I don't go to Fridays very often but I definitely won't return to this location EVER! I've worked in food before and know they live off tips.

Melanie L.,"Aurora, CO",0,3,,1.0,8/3/2015,"Worst experience ever! My husband and I went for Sunday lunch, restaurant wasn't very busy at all, however we were told the kitchen was ""backed up"", that's why it took more than 45 mins for the first order of Endless Apps to come out. But I'm jumping ahead. We were seated directly to the right upon entering the door, were told a specific waitress was assigned to us and then after what looked like some arguing amongst the servers we were finally assigned someone. Still took about 15 mins for out drink order to be taken. Then another 10 mins for the liquids to actually show up at our table. While we had plenty of time to wait we got a great show. 3 other tables surrounding us had major problems either with the kitchen or serving staff. We didn't want to fall into that category so we waited patiently. Unfortunately, we were sucked into the negative atmosphere because our first set of boneless wings came out w warm sauce covering cold pieces of chicken. We set it a side, finished the potato skins and placed our order for the next set of apps. Unfortunately this is where we were told the kitchen was behind. Again, looking around the place was not busy at all. 1 table asked for the manager who didn't show his face until 30-40 mins after they requested him, we had an opportunity to talk with them about there disservice. He then treated them to the nines and we still got the shaft. Even if you count the 2 sets of parties who left for lack of service. I'm pretty sure our server was scared to death of our entire area so we were included in her lacking our attention. The entire 2 1/2 hours we were there we only had 2 sets of apps and 3 refills. Tanay, our server could have made things so much better considering she only had 4 tables to attend to. She would disappear for such a long time we couldn't figure out where she went. She even asked me if I wanted my last refill, walked away for 20 mins, then walked straight towards our tablea grabbed my empty drink cup, walked away for a good 5-7 mIns and finally brought my drink.

The buffalo wings were alright, but not very spicy especially since the sauce we chose was second hottest. My steak is delicious; juicy and cooked right! My mom's baby back ribs were way too salty and she said they were giving her serious cottonmouth. My brother's chicken and shrimp Alfredo was good; my fiancé's was burger good.

In addition it was cold. The guacamole my wife ordered had hole chunks of avocado in it probably 1.5 the size of a marble.

Its more a lunch item but you can get it whenever. Its a grilled ham and cheese sandwich, its more grown up with white cheese, a semi-zesty sauce and a darker rye/grainy bread. A small bowl of soup, and it comes with fries, but they will sub veggies or a salad. I'm pretending to be on a diet so I get the salad. My man gets the sizzling chicken and cheese. WHATS with all the cheese I know I know, but remember again, who doesn't like cheese. It has a mexican flair with all these onions and peppers almost like fajita chicken but not quite. Its so good and the name says it all. Sizzling, gooey melty cheese that sticks to everything as it cools. It comes with garlic mashed potatoes.  I don't usually get dessert here. They seem to rotate their dessert menu all the time and I don't really like their basic options and everything they get something good its a limited time thing.

Kristin W.,"Aurora, CO",138,42,9,4.0,2/28/2011,"EDIT: Since this review was written, the idiot doing bingo was fired and apparently the situation has improved significantly. I haven't personally been in for bingo since then because of my schedule, but I do come in for lunch or dinner, and I am a big fan of that, so I have changed my rating for this restaurant based on my personal impression and the fact that doofus is gone from bingo nights. I know I already posted a review for this place, but I had such a negative experience recently that it warranted another review to warn people about this place.  Never. Ever. Play. Bingo. On. Saturday. Night. I used to be a bingo regular. Note the past tense. I was there every other Saturday (I have other commitments on the other Saturdays), and I used to have the time of my life. It was the highlight to my week. However, my last visit to Fridays was HORRENDOUS, and has caused me to vow never to step foot in there again. Here's why: bingo is RIGGED. I refuse to support a business that allows blatant cheating. Here's the story: my friend and I entered around ten, and settled at a round table by the windows because there wasn't room at the bar. There was a girl sitting at the bar who the bingo organizer kept coming up to to talk with. The body language between them made it obvious that there was something more than an employee/customer relationship there. Whatever, I dont care, as long as it doesn't interfere. Which it did. First bingo game was four corners. Four numbers were called, and the girl yells out bingo. Are you kidding me? I was hoping it was a joke until the bingo announcer said she had won and awarded her in thirty dollars worth of gift cards. Not. Right. My friend and I left immediately, and I am proud to say that I have not been back since, and am searching for a reputable place to play a fun game of bingo!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=100

Best appetizers so far would be the nachos and the pretzel sticks w/ cheese. During my most recent visit, yesterday, I found out that they have recently revamped their menu, so I tried something new. I think it was called ""Chicken Mushibi"". It was some kind of chicken skewers on a bed of rice with grilled zucchini and pita bread...mmmmm new favorite! Will be in soon for another visit.

Our server was friendly, the drinks were constantly filled and the food made it's way out in fairly decent time, especially given how busy they were.  They have certainly changed up their menu and presentation of the food since my last visit to one of their restaurants...and personally, I think it's for the better!  I had the black angus sirloin (6 ounce pre-cooked) with sweet potato fries and grilled mixed veggies, which was part of the ""three for $16.99"" promotion they have going on right now.  I shared my mozzarella sticks (appetizer) and my Oreo ice cream sandwich dessert with my daughters...I also shared my veggies and fries with them, but ate the steak on my own.  I asked for well done and it was well done but still VERY tender and moist with wonderful flavor!  My kids both had the chicken skewers (taken off the skewer for the half-pints) with pita bread and mashed potatoes and they both inhaled it.  My partner had some kind of Argentina inspired pesto with steak and although she said her food 'wasn't that great'....she certainly did down the whole thing! The only real complaint that I have is the table next to us with the obnoxious children (who looked to be around the same age as our twins...one about 5 and the other about 4 or so).  The kids were running up and down the aisle, screaming, getting in the way of the servers (the aisle was already narrow), bothering other patrons and...well...just being BRATS!   Yes, I can make comments about this type of behavior because not only do I have kids that age, but my kids KNOW better than to behave like that in a restaurant!  They know it's inappropriate and would get them into a lot of trouble.  My older two, who are now grown (newly grown, BTW) also knew better than to show out in a restaurant like that -- even with ADHD and even when the meds were low and/or they were tired.   It's a bad thing when your five year old kids look at the kids running around like screaming banshees, look at you and say, ""why are they being bad, Mommy?""  Good question...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora-3?start=100
