Anthony S.,"Naperville, IL",1,20,1,4.0,12/11/2017,Friday is Good but there steaks and chicken is small portions. The service is always good but food is hit or miss Manger is always great if any problems !!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora
Adriana S.,"Chicago, IL",1,23,,1.0,12/22/2017,"After a long day at work being short staffed I thought I would treat myself to some boneless wings. I was greeted at the door and told I could seat myself where I wanted to in the bar area. I proceeded to do so, I got my drink order taken. The young lady was kind enough to say my shift is over but so and so will be taken care of you. I looked over the menu and was ready to order. Well that didn't happen for 10-15 minutes! Mind you there's only 3 other people at the bar. Apparently the bartender knew the people sitting at the bar and took care of them. Didn't acknowledge us until they friends left. Talk about bad customer service. I don't think I'll be coming back late night hours service sucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora
Crystal C.,"Aurora, IL",45,13,,1.0,11/12/2017,I love TGI!! Yet I walk in it's not busy and I don't get seated after 10 min! I look around and see no one who looks like they work here.

Sara N.,"Yorkville, IL",0,7,,1.0,1/3/2018,"Awful service really need to work on marketing. Waiter starts off by telling us their special for the night was endless appetizers, then says the special use to be cheaper and their were more appetizers to choose from. The food took forever to cook we had to sit and wait for the longest time for our food. In hat time the tv were all switched to crappy channels and not like a basketball game or something sports related like you would normally find at a bar. After all that the food came out and it was horrendous. The chicken was dryer my skin in winter. The lettuce was soggy. The burgers were fine but they didn't get the order right. We told the waitress many times no pickles and what do we find, a pickle party going on on the bottom bun.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora
Thomas G.,"Aurora, IL",0,5,,1.0,11/12/2017,"I don't know why I even give this place another chance. Oh wait I do know why...it's because this is the only restaurant open past 10 on a weekday or Sunday. I think they know that they're service is trash and they take advantage of that by being one of the only sit down restaurants open past 10. You can stand there for however long you want and every worker can stare you down and you still won't get a table. I think they play a work game called, who can be the worst worker. Well it's a tie, because you're all horrible at your jobs. Food is decent, I'm not going to diss that because the TGI in Oswego actually serves you on time and provides a better service overall. The food there is good too. If you want TGI, go to the Oswego location instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora
Alan L.,"Naperville, IL",12,30,1,1.0,12/2/2017,"Service has really deteriorated over the last year particularly at the bar used to be that bartenders anticipated when you wanted to order, that happens no longer, even eye contact is rare so you have bartenders. Running around the bar looking busy but not making eye contact with their customers right in front of them why want to order.  Lipstick on wine glasses is a real turn off sorry ladies if your a guy the taste is not appealing particularly when I don't even know you.  Management is hardly ever to be seen in the bar area..  Update nothing has changed maybe even has gotten worse",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora
Junia N.,"Chicago, IL",54,18,20,3.0,11/24/2017,"What I like about chains is that there's some uniformity in their food. I usually order their steak but ordered the grilled salmon this time. I was disappointed cause the serving was so small! I finished 2 servings of rice and the salmon and I was still hungry. Felt like it was pretty pricey for the portion I got. Their Jack Daniels ribs are still the best though, and their blueberry long island (whatever that may be called) was very promising!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora
Katie W.,"Downers Grove, IL",158,2,,1.0,7/4/2017,"I've come here several times with my mom for a girls night, usually it's good.  However tonight I came in by myself and sat at the bar. I had an interesting experience. I was served by some girl she was extremely rude and had an attitude when I wanted to put in another app (the endless app deal).  I guess since I didn't tell her from the beginning and it was a problem. When she asked me for my check, I said I wanted to get another app.  She said ""Well I had no idea that's what you were doing."" She was all bent out of shape about it.  I told her just forget it.  It must be some big deal.  She said it wasn't.  However I didn't appreciate her tone, attitude, and lack of customer service.  I asked to speak to her manager, who was sitting behind me at a high top with another server who was eating.  She began to say, loudly so other people could hear, ""well I guess I have an attitude"" and complaining about me.  I said I can hear you, she said okay. The manager came over and apologized but it was a joke.  I could tell he didn't care.  The server then continued to say for the remaining time, ""well I have an attitude right?""  She was trying to taunt me and get a rise out of me. What a shame.  I work for another restaurant and would never treat a customer like that.  Too bad for her as well, I'm a kind customer that tips generously.  I'll take my money elsewhere.  After this experience, this place deserves less than 1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora
Perry P.,"Aurora, IL",0,8,1,1.0,11/17/2017,came here twice in the past two weeks. last weeks experience the site was down so they had to do call in orders rather than online ones. i called in ordering jack daniels chicken with a side of mashed potatoes (comes with two) then a jack daniels chicken strip appetizer. we came even a little late and they admitted they lost our food. they searched everywhere for it and finally came back with only the jack daniels chicken. i told them i'm missing the chicken strips and i had to wait another 20 minutes for those. overall had to wait 35-40 minutes for my call in order surrounded by staff that wouldn't stop complaining to me about their system. completely unprofessional. also when i came home there wasn't even sauce for the chicken. no offer for the wait or messed up order.  today i decided to get friday's for my birthday and get some steak. i ordered medium but when i cut down the middle it was clearly completely raw not even edible. it still had white stripes of fat along the nearly purple meat. get it together..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora
John L.,"Naperville, IL",33,14,,2.0,3/27/2017,"Not gonna lie, this is one of my favorite chain restaurants. Never disappointed by their steaks or burgers, and they have a fairly good selection of appetizers and cold drinks to choose from.  That all being said, the last 2 trips I've made here have been disappointing. The service is slow as hell. It went from a crawl to practically non-existent, even when we were there during slow business hours. What normally would have taken just under an hour for 2 guests with good, normal service, developed into a perplexing 2 hour meal and dessert.  I'm a relatively quick eater, and when I finally got my order, I was finished in about 9 minutes... leaving 1.5hours to flag our server down as she literally sprinted past us too quickly for us to grab. We reluctantly drank and ate our food, pacing ourselves knowing that we may not see our server for a while. Even then, she never came, all of this with no explanation from her. Suddenly, she ran past us with a tray of food to 3 tables over from us. Confident I could get her attention to refill our drinks, I sat near the aisle and prepared to speak loudly and clearly. Before I had finished clearing my throat, she sprinted past me into the kitchen.  My wife had endless appetizers, which became one appetizer for 30mins, then another for 30 mins. When the 2nd appetizer arrived, we made sure to ask about refilling our drinks... it was now or never.  In summary~ Food: 8/10, prepared well, but arrived late Drinks: 6/10, drinks watered down slightly Service: 2/10, didn't really feel like we had anyone looking out for or taking care of us",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora

There was nobody at the bar besides them, and me and my friend.   She made them leave, And said there was no specials during the week anymore. She shut the bar down at 12:15 when last call is 12:30 during the week.

M. P.,"Geneva, IL",0,12,1,1.0,10/29/2017,"Don't bother! Went on a Sat night and they were not staffed enough for even a slow night. Every single table was covered with dirty dishes. We had to sit at the bar as no tables were clean despite being empty. Another patron and I at the bar were served each other's drinks by mistake. He had touched his (mine) and started to wipe the glass. Because neither of us had taken a sip, the bartender simply switched them back. I don't think its very sanitary to serve someone an open beverage touched/wiped by another costumer. We waited a LONG time for our food and it tasted like it was nuked in the microwave. In addition to poor service, negative dining experience, and bad food, the bill was shockingly high. We will never to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora

Chris F.,"Henderson, NV",67,11,4,1.0,5/15/2017,"My wife and I came here on Saturday afternoon (5/13) during what appeared to be a DOWN time..The experience started off on the wrong foot the moment we stepped in the door. There was no one at the host desk. We took a peak into the bar area and decided we would sit one of the high tables. The hostess popped up out of nowhere and asked ""how many?"" We asked if we could have one of the tables in the bar area and she handed us menus and said ""you can seat yourselves."" Uhhhhhh, WHY ARE YOU EVEN HERE? So the tables on the right side of the area are set (utensils, condiments, etc) while the left side was NOT. There were about 10 people in the ENTIRE building and 6 of them were at 1 table. Our waitress came over while wielding a broom and dustpan and asked if we wanted something to drink. We ordered drinks and given my sightline to the bar I could see that the bartender was ON IT. She had the drinks made and ready in under a minute.HOWEVER, we didn't actually get the drinks for about 5 because our waitress was SO busy doing NOTHING..She was literally walking around and making noise with the dustpan on the floor like she was sweeping something yet every piece of paper/trash remained on the floor. In fact, all of the servers were doing ""busy work"". 1 girl walked over to the side we were sitting on where NONE of the tables were set with a handful of utensils wrapped in napkins and touched a table and walked away.  Food was ordered and literally an HOUR later a guy in regular clothes walks the plate out to our table (guessing he was the manager). The waitress comes over after about 10 minutes to ""check"" on us again with that DAMN broom in hand to ask ""how is everything?"" Well, we never got the wings we ordered. Just the sampler..An HOUR and we still couldn't get the order right. She says ""Boneless right?"" ""No, traditional"" ""With Bleu Cheese right?"" ""No it was RANCH"". She apologizes and says she's going to check on it. Apparently that meant AFTER she walked around the restaurant with the broom and had a conversation with coworkers. AGAIN, it IS NOT BUSY at all..She comes over and says she put a ""RUSH"" on it and that she didn't put it in  when we ordered it. YOU WROTE IT DOWN and there's NO ONE HERE. 30 minutes later the wings show up. I guess the RUSH meant AFTER they caught and killed the chickens themselves.  This was definitely our LAST time here. The service here is just TOO FAR off the mark to make it worth our time and money..We don't frequent this place often as it is, but the past 2 times have left a bad taste in my mouth literally and figuratively.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora
Nicole C.,"Willowbrook, IL",14,36,22,1.0,6/18/2017,"We sat down at 6:10, took 10 min to be acknowledged. Then the waitress said she'd be right back to take our order, but never came back, someone else took our order. After we placed our order, we waited 40 min before inquiring as to why our chicken sandwich and chicken tenders were taking so long. The manager came out and only could advise that the kitchen was backed up, and we were 4th in line (after we were just told by someone else we were 3rd in line). When I asked how much longer it would be, he had no idea. Needless to say, after an hour in the restaurant, and still no food, we got up and walked out. No one even addressed the fact that we were leaving. Horrible f-ing service! Will never be going back, I don't care how many rewards I have with them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora
Brandon N.,"Batavia, IL",126,1,,1.0,9/22/2017,"I had one of the WORST experiences at this TGI Friday's. Let me first start by saying: this Friday's is not the most convenient to me. I SPECIFICALLY go to this one because it's the only one I hadn't had an experience with wrong orders/ poor service. On top of that, I hadn't eaten since about 1:00 PM, so naturally I was already in an irritated state before even walking through the doors. With that being said, this is why I will never be eating or ordering food at this location again; I had made an order for pickup and it said it would be ready by 11:49 pm. I arrived about 5 minutes early so I expected my food to be out within the next 5-10 minutes. Cool right? Well, For starters, as soon as we got there and sat at the bar, the bartender walks past us to get refills for another couple at the bar, after she finally came over, I told her we had an order for pickup. She said she'd go see if it's ready, she then told us it was going to be a few minutes. (So I figured this meant 5 minutes or so. I waited for about 20 MINUTES. The food STILL hadn't come out. The bartender came by 1-2 times earlier and said it was going to be a few more minutes. The food was taking so long that I figured I should take advantage of the time and made a run to Meijer for a few things since I was right next to it. When I came back, the order was ready (and I was surprised that it was at this point, and I'm sure I wouldn't have been as nice as I was leaving if it hadn't been after nearly an HOUR.) when I got to the car I checked the food and one order was supposed to be Jack Daniels chicken. The chicken had BARELY any sauce on it, I'm talking like 4 of those weird jelly chunks.. (if you've eaten this you know exactly what I'm talking about.) AND THEY DIDN'T PUT EXTRA SAUCE IN THE BAG. Like it couldn't even be considered jack Daniels chicken. Which was the icing on top of my already dreadful experience here. Never going to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora

Eric H.,"Gilbert, AZ",8,80,20,1.0,12/29/2016,"This placed ruined my evening.... I was in Aurora on business and decided to have dinner in the bar. As I sat at the bar, the rancid smell from an unclean bar sink rose up and destroyed my nostrils..... even after I moved I couldn't get away from it. Dinner comes, potato skins and boneless chicken with some Asian inspired flavoring. The potato skins were totally unappealing and tasted super bland, I ate 1 of 4 small pieces. The boneless chicken was burnt and was really dry and flavorless as the seasoning covered far less than half of the chicken, I ate 1 small and 1 larger piece, horrible, burnt, flavorless. In all better than 90% of the food was not eaten. I still had to pay almost $9.00. Well, I'm there on business and I'm only allowed 1 paid dinner on the company so I had to come out of pocket to go to Boston Market next door on my personal credit card. Thanks for costing me $13.00 TGIF. This is my final visit to any TGI Friday's location. My last couple of visits were no good as well.

Parents and I were a little hesitant to go based on a negative experience at the Bolingbrook location (which has since closed), but we thought we'd give it a shot.  Get there during the dinner hour on a Friday- no wait and a lot of empty tables. Our server was very friendly-didn't rush us or push us to order extra drinks and apps. We order fairly quickly and wait for our food...for over an hour.  Again, the place was almost empty. Our waitress was very apologetic, but she didn't offer to comp an appetizer/dessert. Instead, we sat there. We get our food. My father's clam chowder is cold. I ordered a burger. My fries are lukewarm and bacon for burger is barely cooked. The cheese was still firm.

He did not ask me how I wanted my steak cooked when I ordered it. Some other girl brought out my sons Mac n cheese and put it right in front of him with the bowl scorching hot. Our server then stood at another table and talked to 2 girls for over 10 minutes rather than bringing out our food. The food was good, but the horrible service ruined it.

Brenden B.,"Chicago, IL",337,134,31,3.0,8/19/2014,"My wife and I decided to stop here for an early dinner while out running errands. I'm not sure why we decided to come here as there are much better options around, but we did.  It was around 5:00pm and the place was dead. The host brought us to our table but I noticed while walking there, the floors the entire way were sticky... We looked over the menu and it looked like they have a good variety of options. We weren't super hungry so we decided to get a couple of appetizers and share a plate.  For apps we got mozz sticks, boneless wings, and soft pretzels. The mozz sticks were good, nice and hot. It's pretty hard to mess something this simple up. The wings tasted like they were from Pizza hut...They were okay, nothing impressive though. The pretzel sticks were good, nicely salted but the cheese sauce was tasteless and watery.  We decided to share a plate of chicken fingers and fries as well as order a side of mashed potatoes with nothing on them for our almost 7 month old to taste. The fingers were okay. They tasted very oily and lacked any seasoning. Thank god there was honey mustard. The fries are your standard frozen to plate fries... again, nothing to write home about. The mashed potatoes, my daughter hated them. This is coming from a 7 month old who eats seriously every type of baby food we give her and enjoys it. We asked for no butter or salt or anything on them...they came out with cheese. Thanks for listening.  We also got to adult drinks, she got a Sam Adam's Seasonal and I got some Peach whiskey thing. Her beer tasted flat and had an off flavor...my drink was meh and WAY too expensive for what you get. The server was nice and friendly. She was prompt and attentive. You could tell though, behind her eyes she was bored out of her mind.  Next time we wont be so lazy and go to the closest restaurant. I'll take the extra time to go somewhere more satisfying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora?start=60
Katie T.,"Naperville, IL",1,34,,3.0,7/27/2015,"It's clear that TGI Friday's has been trying to change it's image and up the quality of their food. I can definitely see that from our last couple of visits.  The good:     - We ordered the Siracha Chicken potato skins and they were AMAZING! I could have eaten a couple more plates of those. The chicken was just hot enough and really tender and the balance between the potato and toppings was great. They've really done a good job improving the appetizers.    - My husband had one of the stacked burgers and he really enjoyed it! They definitely don't skimp on the meat or toppings with those.   - Beer selection is good for a casual chain restaurant The bad: (or why I only gave 3 stars...)   - I ordered the beer cheese burger. While the burger itself was really good, I only got the smallest bit of beer cheese actually on the burger. If that's the main selling point of the burger, I kind of expect it to be dripping with the sauce or at least covering the whole patty.   - Our appetizer took a while to come out from the kitchen and not 5 minutes after we received it, our entrees came. That is a huge pet peeve of mine with restaurants. If the appetizer is delayed for whatever reason, I get that, but then go ahead and delay the main course.

Louie A.,"Warrenville, IL",0,5,,1.0,2/2/2016,"This was actually the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I will never go back to this location, I'd rather go miles out of my way to a different TGI Fridays then ever go back to this one. The server was mediocre and rude and continuously judged myself and the two other girls I was with about how much food we had ordered (an appetizer and an entree each). The entire time we were there the server (who's name I can't remember because I didn't bother to after the experience I had) thought we were going to scam him or dine and dash treating us like we were of less importance than he was all because we asked If a coupon we had would be something we could use with an appetizer promotion they had going on at that time; something like endless apps for $12 a person. This server ended up ignoring us, not filling our drinks and only coming to our table to crack more arrogant jokes. After such terrible service the manager came to our table, not to apologize or ask how our food tasted but to again criticize my friends and I on our food choices; asking ""where all of our other guests were to eat this much food."" I don't understand if the manager thought he was funny or if he really was as ignorant as he seemed. It's a shame how awful of service this place provided because their food wasn't bad. I always enjoy the pretzels and cheese at TGI Firdays but I guess I can find better pretzels and service elsewhere. I wonder how this place would do if they were to get secret shopped and receive the attitude and ignorance that my group and myself did from two full grown men.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora?start=60
David B.,"Naperville, IL",26,17,3,3.0,12/20/2012,"I'm biased because I prefer Chili's. We go to Fridays because my brother uses his stripes membership for free chips and salsa and always has coupons. I am a huge fan of the Cajun Shrimp and Chicken Pasta and the Jack Daniels Sampler, but there is a lack of options for the regular sampler. The JD only has three items, but they are flexible with subbing other items. The main issue I have is the quality of their Three-for-all. I like getting samplers as my entree because of the variety, but theirs is lacking. The last time I visited I got chewy overcooked potato skins and bone dry boneless wings with no flavor. I fought through it because I hate complaining, but I tried to make the manager understand what the problem was. I didn't ask him for anything, I just wanted to provide feedback.  He looked like he was having a heart attack as I explained the low quality. The LOADED potato skins had burnt orange colored cheese product and 2 bits of bacon. He wouldn't even look at them as I was telling him about it. He just kept asking me if I wanted something else. This told me that this is the standard for them. Obviously they keep a ton of these items in the freezer and are made of the cheapest possible ingredients. The pretzels tasted like they were soaked in salt water for a week and there was grease dripping off of them that I couldn't wash off my hands. The boneless wings were buffalo sauce colored, but were dry and tasteless.  Don't order anything that comes out of a bag and is heated in the microwave. The waitstaff is friendly and helpful, but the management appears to be unprepared to deal with complaints. It's not hard. Listen, apologize, and offer a solution.

Deiniol M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",252,73,44,3.0,1/15/2007,"I'm not too sure what TGI Friday's is doing with themselves.  If you've seen any of the newer or newly renovated TGI Friday's with the ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" decor and signage, they seem to be trying desperately to stay relevant by reinventing themselves, eschewing what put them on the map in the first place. Gone are the long, peninsula-shaped wood bars; now the bar is off to one side, and its small.  And who doesn't long for the days of the suspenders covered in buttons- the trademarks lampooned in ""Office Space""?  Like it or not, they were conversation-starters, and for the vast majority of the staff, it reflected at least a part of their personality.   For the most part, the staff is still friendly, but now they are all wearing corporate-casual polo shirts that would be equally at home at a Target, especially given how small the logo is, I'm sure its a mistake that's been made more than once. In my experience, the food, drink, and service at TGI Friday's has always been consistently good, but where's the irreverence?  Where's the personality that imprinted itself on my psyche so many years ago?  How you you any different now, TGI Friday's, than Applebee's, Ruby Tuesday, Houlihan's (who, I think, hired the same designer as TGI Friday's to try to get the same look and feel, further blurring the line between the two), or any of the other chain ""bar and grills"" out there?  I want to believe in you, TGI Friday's, and I still have my GoldPoints card (not that its seen the light of day in ages)... give me a reason to come back...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora?start=60

This restaurant obviously has NO IDEA WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE means.  I was there on Saturday at 4pm (restaurant mostly empty) for my son's birthday and we had 10 people in our group.  We were told they were preparing a table for us and we waited for 15 minutes while several other groups came in and were sat right away.  We could see the hostess talking to several servers but no one was preparing a table.  I was about to confront her when she took us to the back and sat us all separate (1 booth and 2 tables) which had no utensils. So they were never preparing a table.  I noticed she didn't give us kids menus so I had to go back to the front to ask for them.  Then we waited another 10 minutes for our waiter to take our drink orders.  We've had him before so I knew he was slow.  We waited another 15 minutes to get our water then he walks away.  As we sat near the kitchen we noticed several servers around the one machine entering orders and processing payments and saw 2 useless managers just walking around.  I literally had to walk over to the servers to see if our waiter was ever coming back to take our order.  If it wasn't my sons birthday I would have spoken to the managers but they could tell I was irritated because he kept making eye contact with me.  Then I turned around and our waiter appeared an was taking the kids order.  All in all the staff and MANAGEMENT need to be retrained on efficiency and customer service.  This restaurant is in a populated area and should be able to run smoother and faster especially when only half full.  I would have been more patient if these were teens or twenty something employees but these were literally grown adults.  I understand the restaurant service industry is hard work but at this TGIFridays is nonexistent.  Go across the street to Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora?start=40

There are numerous restaurant possibilities on Route 59 and I strongly suggest you choose somewhere else with better fare and service - especially if you have limited time.

Then the spinach dip was your typical Friday's spinach dip but when we got to the tortilla chips that went along with it. I must admit that everything was going great for a while until I bit into a chip that tasted like a salt lick!!! It was so salty I had to spit it out and try not to go blind or die of dehydration. I know that's extreme but I want you to know how salty it was. So finally my entree. But oh lawd I thought I played it safe by ordering a grilled lobster and salmon with jasmine rice and Parmesan steak fries. The lobster and salmon were actually great. I can't complain about that. They were actually cooked to my liking and so was the jasmine rice but that so called Parmesan steak fries was just horrific. I don't know what was in it but it was not Parmesan. It looked gooey and crispy all at the same time. Ugh I just can't deal with this when it comes to my food... So sad to say I was disappointed with this location and my good because I expect better from them. I only gave a star because of my fish, lobster, rice and the waiter. He was nice and the manager didn't even stop by to ask how out experience was but yet I saw him walking around to everyone else's table and asking them.. Ummm hmmm ok!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora?start=40

Brittany V.,"Aurora, IL",157,3,1,5.0,6/5/2016,"So this gets 5 stars for all the bar employees!! You guys rock! I come in here all the time, literally nearly all the bartenders know me. Idk if that's a good thing or not haha, but I love the food and great drink specials! But what ultimately keeps me coming back is Dee and Jordan! They both are so nice and every time I go to Fridays their both always in a good mood and ready for a conversation. Today however, I called to see who was bartending to see who Id be chatting with and this guy named Jack answered and I asked him who was there and he literally replied with ""Uhm, I don't know"". Very snotty and I was really shocked by that response. I didn't even know what to say! I was just like ""oh okay well thanks, and he hung up."" Thought that wasn't very professional and if he's one of your hosts you should teach him some guest mannerisms because coming from a restaurant worker as well, if that's the first person I see walking in somewhere it really changes your mood overall. Just a heads up guys",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora?start=40
Timothy M.,"Naperville, IL",97,216,163,5.0,3/25/2014,"You know what to expect from a Fridays or any type of restaurant that plays in this arena. The big things you want to get are good food, service, price and atmosphere. Well Fridays is like Pizza Hut cause they deliver. Great specials daily and with Fridays points you can definitely get a good value at Fridays. What what",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora?start=40
John S.,"Aurora, IL",126,438,5,4.0,12/20/2013,We all know what to expect when it comes to the food here. The food is boxed and heated up. If you are expecting gourmet food you have come to the wrong place. The Appetizer and  Entree deal for $10 is a good buy otherwise the food here is over priced for what you get. The pick 2 however is a great deal and a lot to eat for $10. Drink specials are also good on Thursday night. The service at this location is MUCH better then other Friday's locations I have been to. Our waiter was a saint to wait for a couple of members of our party to show up that were very late. My food was also served hot so kudos to the service at this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora?start=40
Sam M.,"Warrenville, IL",32,139,185,4.0,4/25/2015,"The food was pretty average, but the staff is great! The manager is by the rules, but honors discounts (even though he thought it was fake, that was very kind of him!) there's a reason we keep coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora?start=40
Shawn R.,"Romeoville, IL",45,15,,5.0,1/21/2015,"The Jack Daniels shrimp and steak never disappoints here. For some reason, it always tastes better at this location. Also, the bartender that was working today was hot as hell. Holy shit!!! 5 stars. Will be back again for sureee",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora?start=40
Bre S.,"Naperville, IL",141,10,5,1.0,4/4/2016,Left the restaurant before we even got seated. There was not a hostess at the stand. Waited for about 5 minutes and no one came over. A waitress and bartender looked over but still did nothing about it. Won't be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-aurora?start=40
