Laura W.,"Fredericksburg, VA",9,73,27,2.0,7/10/2013,"After a 35 minute wait, we were escorted through a restaurant that was 3/4 empty. Er, what? Perhaps there's only one waiter? Nope, plenty of waiters. So why in the world were they only using 5 of the 30 tables? Our waitress was fine, but the guy who I'm guessing was the owner or manager was super awkward. He didn't acknowledge us, just refilled our waters and almost got his sleeves in mine. And when he spilled an ice cube on the floor, he, while still holding my water, slowly kicked the ice cube away, taking about a minute, and still holding onto my water, to kick the ice cube into a corner. What?! That was so weird and awkward and unprofessional.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin

They have a scam going where they doctor your receipt and charge you a bit extra, hoping that you won't notice. When this was brought to Oliver's attention absolutely no reparations were attempted. All he had was hoops and zero solutions. Friday's corporate has yet to get back with us.  BEWARE this Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin
May G.,"Houston, TX",3,165,8,2.0,4/23/2013,"When we sat at our table we noticed there were two quarters left behind. Maybe the last table forgot it? The patio is the ONLY reason why it gets two stars. You get a nice view of the river, and if you happen to be eating in the afternoon/evening you get a really nice view of all the bats coming out.  Our server was horrible. It took her 15 minutes to greet us, and  let's just say after a whole day's worth of walking around SXSW I was eager to get some H20.  When I asked her whether a certain dish was spicy, she responded ""Ummm i dont know.""  What do you mean you don't know? It's not like I asked you to list the ingredients alphabetically, I  just asked you if the dish was spicy.  I should have just told her to forget that I asked because she then wandered around aimlessly trying to figure out if the dish was spicy. Kind of like a fairy floating around the patio. When we finally got our food, it was def. below average food. I couldn't even finish it.  Needless to say our server never once came back to our table. I'm guessing she took some ********* and had no idea why she was at TGI Fridays.  Now I know why the last table left 50 cents .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin

They have a kickass patio, though, with a great view of the Congress Ave bridge, where the supposed bats are.  MmmHmmm.  After the disappointment of not seeing the bats we stopped in to 1) get our parking card validated, and 2) to grab a drink.  Our waiter was pretty slow, but then again we were in no hurry, so no biggie.  It was nice enojoying the weather and booze.  We stayed there until past 10pm and still never saw the bats.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin
Brice G.,"Austin, TX",275,13,1,1.0,10/17/2013,"The service was  awful. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, and working in the service industry it really takes a lot to make me dissatisfied.  I was staying at the attached hotel for a wedding in July so I came in a couple of times to get some drinks and some food.  My final experience was when I sat down and ordered a frozen margarita. After 10 minutes I was brought a frozen strawberry margarita. I said ""what's this?"" The answer: ""margarita"". ""A red margarita?"" I said. Yes. ""What's in it?"" I inquired.

John M.,"Richmond, CA",938,1197,1158,4.0,4/6/2010,"Having been to a few TGIF's, this one was really alright overall. Food & service actually do vary considerably from one TGIF to another. Yes, TGIF is a chain casual dining restaurant & as such, even at its best, the food isn't fabulously exceptional. The food at this TGIF in Austin was about as good as I've had at any TGIF & would be a 3 star rating, but a pair of other factors give it that extra star for me: service & convenience. During this last SXSW stint, I ordered food here to go a number of times, as well as had a few drinks at the bar & service was always friendly, conversational & attentive though the kitchen was a little slow at sending the food out. Since this TGIF is inside the hotel I stayed at for SXSW, it was extremely convenient to get food on the occasions that the girlfriend & I were too tired/ drunk/ exhausted/ ill to go out for something to eat. So this TGIF is better than the average TGIF with great service & can really be quite the blessing if you're staying in the building.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin

Ted R.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,3.0,1/30/2013,"I recently attended a business dinner at this TGI Fridays. I arrived early and secured a table on the ""Batio"" for me and my business associates to discuss the details of a recent business proposal. The weather was warm, but pretty perfect. I ordered a sweet tea and some chips and salsa (warning: the salsa is SPICY) while I waited for my business associates to arrive. When my associates arrived we all commented on the cool, ""funky"" vibe the restaurant has right down to the ""batio"". What a neat place. We ordered our food and were off to the races! As we ate, we discussed details about the different aspects of the business plan I was proposing. The food was top-notch. Sarah especially enjoyed her entree, Dan also enjoyed his dish, but commented on the spiciness a few times. My meal was also a tad spicy, but it was delicious too.

Andy P.,"Utica, NY",7,21,3,3.0,8/5/2012,"This evening a couple of my lady friends and I decided to play tourist in our own back yard.  So we went to TGIFridays to watch the bats while enjoying some beverages and snacks.   My three star rating is an 'average' for the chain restaurant experience.  The food was up to standard and consistency of the well know brand.  I have no gripe there what so ever...   And to be honest,  I have to say that is hard to find decent chicken wings... TGIFridays never disappoints!  For maintaining their brand standards I give them a 4 star. I give our server a 1.  After waiting SEVERAL minutes a server who clearly came over from another section asked us is we had been helped.  His name was Andrew and he was VERY friendly.   If we had been able to keep him as a server I think that our experience would have been ideal.  However, it was not his section and he was just being a team player.  Our server is nameless because he never introduced himself.  Of course they all wear name tags, and a name is usually on the guest check... however I was so unsettled from our bad experience that I had actually forgotten to put his name to memory.  Our server was constantly absent,  and it took him forever to bring items we may have requested.  We had to ask for water THREE times.  It took over five minutes to process our check.   If you read my blog and my reviews here, you know that I am NOT accustomed to write about my negative experiences.  Therefor I guess that I just could not be bothered to put his name to memory.  Fitting I suspect, as he just could not be bothered to do his job! The service was not up to standard for any establishment.   As a fellow server, I am embarrassed to have someone like this in my profession.  This kind of service gives the rest of us a bad rap, and he should be ashamed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin
Judith B.,"Austin, TX",48,11,3,1.0,8/27/2012,"This review is twofold.  First, I'll review the food and then the ""bat experience"". I love potato skins, and I've discovered over the years that it is very hard to mess these up. Well, TGIF's managed to do so.  All I could taste was the salt, and the ranch dressing I asked for was kind of blah.  I only ate them because I didn't want to waste the $10 spent on them.  Yes, $10 for potato skins! Now the bats. We only went to this TGIF because it was listed that you could see the bats as they left the bridge.  Maybe with binoculars.  They looked like a swarm of bees from our vantage point.  On top of that, they don't have any pest control on the patio, so if you're susceptible to bug bites, you won't be happy.  It was also hot and muggy, despite the misting fans they had on. Overall, an expensive lesson learned. If we want to see the bats, stand on the bridge for free and wait!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin
Sarah H.,"Manor, TX",0,6,,4.0,8/19/2012,"I've been to TGI Fridays in Illinois before, but I have to say this one here in Austin beats the other one by far. My husband ordered the steak and ribs and his steak was cooked to perfection. I ordered the Jack Daniels ribs and I fell in love. The spinach door app was great. Service was awesome, our waiter was very nice and very attentive especially since he had a big party along with our table. Drinks were great too. Long island ice tea was superb. I will definitely come back here. The only reason why I didn't rate it 5 stars was because it was really cold inside.  Oh and parking is free!

Roland F.,"Rancho Santa Fe, CA",1044,132,,2.0,11/9/2010,"This Fridays in the Radisson hotel by the lake downtown has a nice feel to it with cool tables outside overlooking the lake on a balcony and the typical centralized bar and surrounding seating that all Fridays seem to have. Service is decent and the food is okay. It's nothing to write home about, like all Fridays food, but also not horrible. I've had many of the dishes while stranded here during conferences and the salads and burgers seem to be the best bet in my experience. So, go for the view and have some drinks on the patio/balcony while trying to sneak a peek at the bats, but you'd be way better off to catch dinner somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin

We came on 4th of July and although they were booked for the patio for weeks in advance (for the bats AND the fireworks) we got a spot inside right next to the patio. We had the same exact view but were in the AC and not being eaten by mosquitoes.  Out server (Tiffany?) was super nice and funny. Really cute and bubbly but not annoying in the least.  The food was actually good. I am never impressed by TGIF's or most chain restaurants but that night was a success. Get the shrimp scampi and salmon.

Stephen T.,"Venice, CA",294,459,216,3.0,2/24/2011,"I really like the location. My only gripes are the standard ones for a chain of this ilk...they mix their margaritas with just a smidge of Tequila (for flavor?), and of course the menu can be a little tiresome. However, when every other restaurant in town is booked and you want a quiet place overlooking the river, you can certainly dig up enough good food on the menu to make it worthwhile. PS: Order your margaritas with a shot of tequila to sort out the liquor problem and everything else goes much more smoothly. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin?start=20
Nicole S.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,2.0,6/3/2013,"Ate dinner with my family at TGI Friday's two weekends ago, mostly because it was convenient.  While I was told a table was available and being cleaned off, it took 20 minutes before we were actually seated.   As for meals, most came out correctly, except for mine.  I specifically asked for the spinach and tomato pizza without red pepper flakes.  When it came out with red pepper flakes on it, the waitress said to me, those aren't peppers, those are tomatoes, and told me to try it.  Well, I tried it, and my mouth was on fire from the red pepper flakes.  The waitress took it back to be remade, and the second time around, it came out correctly without the red pepper flakes, but ALSO without tomatoes.  Oh well. Food was acceptable, but not the best I've had.  Also took a long while to get water glasses refilled.  Much better places to eat downtown than TGI Fridays",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin?start=20
George B.,"Austin, TX",83,21,4,1.0,8/27/2012,"My Wife, Preschooler and I have always heard about the ""Bats"" and there's a ton of reviews about how Great the View is, atmosphere and Food at This TGIF.  We called and were told how exciting it was and so we went.   Although all of the reviewers I've read here seem to be Tickled Pink, you can color me, UNIMPRESSED! First, the greeter made us believe that the bats actually came out from under the bridge next to the restaurant, however, when the bats did swarm they were about 1/4 mile to a 1/2 mile away and all you could see was the blurry formation.   So if you really want to experience the BATS TGIF's is not recommended... Let's talk about the service, once again, I couldn't feel colored by anything other then disappointment, we were seated a good 15 minutes before we even saw a server on the patio.  The service was very slow and when our beer was almost empty we asked for another round.  The server actually waited until we had completely finished the drink before he came out, took the glasses and told us he'd put the order in now.  Now for the food.  First of all, I'm a chef! I've a food show, My name has gotten shot out's on the Food Network.  So Trust me on this one... My wife ordered stuffed potato skins that came out near burnt and had so much salt on them you couldn't taste anything else (I commented that the Chef must have Palsy)! I order their Tuscan Spinach/Artichoke dip that came with blue and yellow tortillas.  I first noticed there were only yellow tortillas.  Next although the bowl was hot to the touch, the dip was luke warm to say the least (note to chef, heat the dip not just the bowl).  The Dip was tasteless and the spinach itself was from a can or a frozen box Certainly not worth the 8 dollars they charged for this.  I expect more from a TGIF especially if it's in a Radisson hotel in Downtown Austin.  From the Children's Menu we ordered Mac n Cheese and fries.  The fries were tasteless with very little salt (guess they used it all on the potato skins - confirming in my mind the Chef has Palsy).  The macaroni n cheese was obviously from a generic boxed Mac n Cheese Mix, you could actually taste the box, which was about all you could taste. They call the patio area ""Batio"" in reverence to the bats, I'd call it Sucko! In short, pompous, slow service, extremely high prices and marginal quality food.  Don't believe the reviews, save your money go some place else! We'll NEVER go back. Sorry but they should change their name from TGIF to WTF...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin?start=20
Glenda Raey V.,"Austin, TX",15,9,,4.0,10/18/2012,"Well me and Gregory do enjoy treating ourselves to a little bit of fine cuisine every second Friday of the month, and it just so happens that we have made it a special Friday night tradition to go to the T.G.I.Fridays (Thank Goodness It's Friday's) next to the Starbucks Raddison for the past 3 years or so. Me and Gregory like to start off with some delectable potato skins as an appetizer. Now I know what you're thinking, 'Glenda Raey Von. All that starch and dairy! are you bananas?' Well I may be. but, believe me, it's worth a little indigestion every once and a while! Then, me and my Gregory drink a couple cocktails, (ask for the Glenda Ravon. it's a special cocktail that Michael makes, the most adorable TGIF bartender!  It's two parts gin, one part cognac, and three splashes of grape flavored vodka with a cucumber slice garnish!) They really get Gregory in the mood if you know what I mean! After that, our recent favorite dish is the rib-eye steak (well done of course) with the sweet and savory Evan Williams sauce. After that we order two plates of spicy chicken wings and a couple more Glenda Ravons and sit on their amazing back patio and give each other sensual foot rubs as the sun sets. (so romantic!) My only issue is that I just found out a week ago Monday from my couples yoga students Mary and Jessie, that they sell their meal dishes at local grocery stores (in the frozen meals section!). I'm not one to complain, but the frozen appetizer meals  taste a little better out of our own microwave! However, the romantic ambiance, the wonderful bar tending (thanks Michael!), and the wonderful back porch seating keep me and Gregory coming back for seconds! If you're looking for a romantic afternoon with your sweetheart I definitely suggest going to TGI Friday's for a treat you won't forget!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin?start=20
Zafa R.,"Austin, TX",0,90,58,4.0,6/9/2010,"Date of First Visit: July 12, 2008 I saw a commercial a few days ago for T.G.I. Fridays about their ""Right Portion, Right Price"" offering, so I decided I wanted to go and check it out. With prices just going through the roof on everything, I figure it's worth a look. Yes, I know T.G.I. Fridays is just another one of those national chains, and while I am all about supporting local businesses and what not, I do like to go to chains now and again, too. Anyway, I went to the T.G.I. Fridays location within the Radisson at South Congress and Cesar Chavez. There's free parking as long as you get your ticket validated at the restaurant. I ordered the $5.99 entrée of Roasted Red Pepper Sausage & Chicken Penne. I went in during the lunch period on a Saturday, around 2:00pm, so there actually weren't that many patrons. I had a lovely view of Town Lake and the hotel's own swimming pool area. It took about 10 minutes before my order arrived. The dish was actually pretty good. For the price, the portion they gave was actually quite a lot, and the sausage/chicken to pasta ratio was pretty good. I loved the sauce that they used. The taste of the red peppers really came through and had just the tiniest hint of a spicy bite. I noticed on the receipt that if I called a special survey hotline and answer some questions, you're given a validation code which you write down on your receipt. Present the receipt the next time you're at T.G.I. Fridays, and you get a free appetizer up to $8.00. So, I did just that, and well, being that I am a bargain hunter, I went back to T.G.I. Fridays the next day, for lunch again, around the same time. I got the potstickers as the free appetizer, although there weren't really that many appetizers under $8.00, if I remember the menu prices correctly. The potstickers were standard and nothing to be excited about, certainly not on the same league, flavorwise, as the penne. I did order the penne again, but actually took it home to eat for dinner, as the potstickers were pretty filling. Anyway, all in all, a rather enjoyable dining experience. I actually have quite fond memories of T.G.I. Fridays. When I was living in Beijing, China, T.G.I. Fridays was the only place I could go to that served really good cheeseburgers, like how they are served here in the United States. It was my connection to American food. Though I don't go all that much, I'll always have fond memories of those cheeseburgers at the T.G.I. Fridays in Beijing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin?start=20

And there's a decently-sized patio with a great view of the lake and South Congress bridge, as well as an enticing dessert menu (judge me allllll you want). Those are the ONLY reasons I'd return here. They'll validate your parking stub from the Radisson for up to three hours. So that's nice. But the food? Mleh. The key-lime shrimp skewers were good, but the broccoli was inedible and (most likely) petrified. My ginormous Ultimate Hawaiian Volcano drink was expensive and nothing to write home about.

Where is this salad, you ask?  At TGI Friday's.  Yes, that overpriced, in-your-face, mega-giant-chain that provided the inspiration for ""37 pieces of flair.""  But this salad...it's just so perfect for me... So yeah - the pecan crusted chicken salad.  Huge.  Salad greens, pecan-crusted chicken, mandarin oranges, glazed pecans, celery, dried cranberries, and bleu cheese, all tossed in this really terrific balsamic vinaigrette.  Most people could probably get two meals out of this thing, but I'm a big eater, especially when something is super delicious, so I generally gobble mine down in one sitting. Did I just lose all of my ""Yelper's cred""?  Hey, at least it's better than Chili's.  Besides, the only reason I told you is because I care about you and I really wanted to be honest.

In theory, you can see the bats come out on the bridge but the few times that I've stopped by in the evening, the bats were on strike or something ( & didn't bother to come out until after the sun was long gone).  In any event, if you are into bat watching hang out on the desk at TGIF while having a few drinks - you might not see any bats but at least you'll enjoy a few good drinks.

I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I have been going to TGI Fridays FOREVER and maybe a little to do with the fact that I have always lived near one.  I have probably been to half the TGI Friday restaurants in the world, I always seem to stumble on them when traveling.  My addiction is so bad I actually have a first generation Gold Points/TGI Fridays card from like 2001.  I could probably fly around the world and back with my bonus points.  It's sad really. Anyway, on the restaurant.  The new decor sucks, I was a die hard fan of the old look and I miss the cheesy striped tables.  WORST part of it is they took out all of the booths except for TWO, WTF?  I HATE sitting in chairs, I need a booth.  What the hell were they thinking?   So good things, they validate your parking, they have a private garage, the service is good and if you have a complaint they will actually work to get it solved.  The food is pretty mediocre, it can be really hit or miss.  The menu options are decent but the quality of the food can be suspect sometimes.   Who cares about the food though, just pound some of the delectable drinks they have! The drinks are great, they have a well stocked bar and they are reasonably priced.  Good place to grab a cocktail during happy hour. Overall, the food is mediocre, the drinks awesome, the service above average and the location kicks ass. Just don't get addicted like me, then you will never be able to stop eating here and you will never be able to figure out why.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin?start=20
J H.,"Austin, TX",66,40,1,3.0,6/11/2008,"We went on a Sunday night after typical dinner time (9pm). We were seated outside and the sprinklers were still on. It was a hot night so I didn't mind the light spray.  We had a nice view of the river. The service was just ok but every table that didn't have diners at it was covered in plates, glasses, etc. I guess the busboy took a very long smoke break....it wasn't attractive. I got the California Club and a beer. The sandwich was much better than I expected and the fries were good as well. The price was ok (was expecting a little higher b/c they're attached to a hotel). It was ok for an ""oh my god I'm so tired but I don't really want to leave the hotel but don't want roomservice"" type of dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin?start=20
Matthew S.,"Austin, TX",0,7,,2.0,2/3/2012,"I see a lot of good reviews that's pretty cool. Iv'e came here 3 times. The first time..me and my gf were drunk so the server..thought ""ill charge them for the drink and charge them 11 for a tip."" Being the drink was 10 something with tax's in the first place.  We left a 5 dollar tip..not an 11 we were not that drunk. The 2nd time was pretty cool. The girl behind the bar made an awesome margarita for my gf that wasn't on the menu. The 3rd time..we arrived an our server Brandy..was..idk how to say it. A energy drain..a buzz kill..ya know if your having a bad day thats cool..i know ive been there..but her whole demeanor explained the events to come. So my Gf orders a cosmo. On the pic its a pinkish reddish color. When we got it..it was..almost clear..light pink and taste like shit. So when our server came back.. and asked if everything was ok as she attempted to quickly pass by we asked her about it..and she made the most guilty face like "" yeah you got me""..she shrugged her shoulders and said "" im sorry umm ill comp it for you what else do you want"". i said ""..what is the bartender new..or did you spill it""..she replied..""its a long story""..Ok..soo if we would have said ""yes the drink is good""..she would have no problem letting my gf drink that retarded cousin to the cosmo. Why is it a long story..I mean I can understand if..you spilled the drink..ran over to the closet by the bathrooms to grab a vacuum.. vacuumed the drink up ..opened the shaker..and poured it back in there..because thats what it taste like. But not having the required stuff to make it..or just not enough , you could come back outside and tell us..instead of giving us a half ass drink. And be careful of patio seating some people know they charge hidden cost for patio seating. But the menu they have outside has jacked up prices. I know 3 people that have worked at this TGIF. And they all say the same thing. So if you go back..watch out for brandy..and wanna sit out side grab a menu from the inside on your way out..if they say ""ohh we can't let you use that menu..the ones out side are laminated so they wont get damaged"" ..know your getting scammed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin?start=20
Bo T.,"Austin, TX",34,18,,4.0,4/11/2010,"TGIF indeed! My old navy buddies were in town for a very auspicious day. It was Zack's neices quinceañera and Vincenzo's little brother's bar mitvah! I wanted to take them out to celebrate this auspicious day. I made a bit of a fauxpass and had planned on taking them to Chuckie Cheeze (I can't believe how they have grown!) but of course they protested. Today they are adults and we should treat them as such. Well then if you are an adult you need to learn about ""TGIF"" because they will be working soon and next thing you know ""TGIF"" indeed! What better place than at Friday's! It can't always be Friday but you can pretend. The kids.... err... new adults loved it. The only downside is the place has a terrible bat problem! I am pretty sure I got guano in my margatini! I understand they live under that bridge. I thought once they gave the bridge to Ann Richards she would do something about those critters but no! Not even the former governor can get rid of the those pesky birds. Sorry I am ranting. Anyway consider this place for your next coming of age party, you will not regret it! TGIF!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin?start=20
Catherine D.,"Austin, TX",376,417,34,2.0,6/5/2008,"I like Friday's, I just don't like TGI Friday's. We went here the other night because it's the perfect location to watch the bats.  The food is pretty mediocre but the service we had was worse than mediocre. We ordered drinks and they arrived mid meal. My son ordered a strawberry smoothie but was accidentally brought a red bull drink. When I asked the waitress about it she said she guessed she could switch it like she was doing me a favor bringing the correct item.It took about 30 minutes for our food to arrive.  The waitress came to the table and said it always takes this long for the food and if she said anything the cooks would make it even longer.  Two stars because  we did get a great view of the bats, but if we want to do that again I think we'll get some sandwiches and sit beneath the bridge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-austin?start=20
