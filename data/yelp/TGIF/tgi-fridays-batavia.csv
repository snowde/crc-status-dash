Jeff E.,"Batavia, IL",1,6,,3.0,9/18/2017,"A tale of two restaurants. During the day during the week Jacquelyn is a great and attentive bartender/waitress. Constantly checking on you even when busy. Night time is a different story most of the staff seems like they don't want to be there. Tables sit unbiased , took forever to get food. Good is usually good or else I probably wouldn't come back at night but for convenience to the theater. We did have one great experience in the evening with Lily. She was attentive even when she seemed overwhelmed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia
Erin N.,"Columbia, MO",0,1,,1.0,1/2/2018,"It's very sad because I grew up in Geneva going to this TGI Fridays for every single one of my sister's birthday dinners. It was always her first pick and the whole family enjoyed it. About 10 years later I come back to visit and I brought a group of friends here just for old times sake and a cheaper, casual meal.  Our table of 8 was not approached for a good 25 minutes, until the manager came around telling us our server would be right over. Another 10 minutes go by, he introduces himself and immediately walks away. Another 10 minutes, he takes our drink order. 15 minutes go by and we finally receive them, though he forgot about 3 of our orders. Having been a waitress for many years, it seemed our waiter did not care at all. When the food finally arrived they got 4/8 of our orders wrong and completely forgot about one of us! I'm genuinely sad that this place has become so careless, it was my favorite as a kid. Sorry, but I hope this helps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia
Shevon R.,"Elburn, IL",81,91,108,2.0,8/3/2017,"My husband was working and my kids wanted to have a disgusting, artery clogging, all-you-can-eat appetizer bonanza.  So, in that aspect, TGI Fridays did not disappoint.  We decided to go with the appetizer all you can eat deal.  $10 per gluttonous participant.  The 3 of us did it.   Here are the rules: $10 per person eating ""Endless Appetizers"" deal, you can order any of the appetizers on a specified menu, you can change to different ones.  The appetizers are smaller portions of the normal appetizers.  Your choices currently are: Potato Skins, Mozzarella Sticks, Meatballs, Potstickers, Bacon Nachos, Chicken Quesadillas, Barbecue Chicken Flatbread, Boneless Wings (you choose the sauce Buffalo, Jack Daniels, or BBQ). My run down on how they were.  Remember, I am applying the chain food filter to these.  They are not delightful creations.  They are edible greasy bar food that tastes good, but makes you feel guilty for even putting it in your mouth. Potato Skins & Mozzarella Sticks: same as usual, can't go wrong Bacon Nachos: Yuck, soggy chips, fake bacon or fakin, something resembling sour cream on it, not sure what it was Potstickers: Not too bad, sauce just okay Chicken Quesadillas: pretty good BBQ Chicken Flatbread: Yuck, cardboard crust....I thought it was supposed to be flatbread? Boneless Wings: over breaded chicken nuggets disguised as boneless wings Meatballs: looked totally yummy in a little cast iron pan with sauce, melty cheese, and crostini...NOOOO, horrible gaggy meatballs and soggy crostini Anyway, you go home with your tummy and arteries full, but your brain full of guilt.  Enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia
Carol B.,"Florence, WI",8,1,,1.0,1/11/2018,I always try to give a restaurant time to get a server to my table. After waiting for 15 minutes and no one even came by with water I had to just get up and leave.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia
Josue O.,"Montgomery, IL",23,103,242,1.0,5/31/2017,"I've been to various TGI Fridays and generally have had positive experiences. My wife and I decided to hit up this location before we saw a movie next door. It was a Friday evening, so I understand having to wait for a table. However, we, along with about a dozen other parties, waited in excess of a half hour while several tables sat empty and unbussed. When we were finally seated, it took ten minutes before a server came to our table, and that was only because I asked if we had a server.  We finally ordered food (my wife ordered Jack Daniels chicken and a Caesar salad, I ordered Jack Daniels flat iron steak cooked medium). When the server brought out my wife's Caesar salad about fifteen minutes later, it was just a pile of limp lettuce and two croutons. No dressing. None at all. I mentioned this to the server and he said, ""Oh, well we're out of Caesar dressing,"" and then walked away. When I managed to flag him down again, I asked if I could get another dressing instead. He told me, ""Sure,"" and then tells me that he's sorry, because the restaurant is also out of Jack Daniels chicken (???), would we like something else? My wife asks for a burger. The dressing finally arrived WITH dinner, several minutes later. My wife's burger was fine, my steak was extremely undercooked, rare at best. Before we left, I asked to speak with a manager, who never materialized. We ended up being a few minutes late for our movie, as I had to do everything but pull teeth to get our check. This is one TGI Friday's we won't visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia

Mike M.,"Batavia, IL",1,10,1,2.0,5/23/2017,I stopped in last Saturday night for a quick bite and I think the bartender forgot to out in our order.

Cheryl B.,"Carol Stream, IL",0,6,,2.0,1/19/2017,"First time at this location.  Hostess brought us to a dirty table and had us stand there while she went and got a wet rag from somewhere to clean the table.  I proceeded to wipe it again with a couple of napkins after we sat down.  Then we had to wait for menus.  Then our server arrived, handed us our menus and literally asked if we were ready to order!  Um, no, we'd like to look at the menu first!  SLOW service, mediocre - warm, not hot, food.  Don't waste your time.  Plenty of other restaurants in the area!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia
David A.,"St. Charles, IL",0,3,,1.0,3/5/2017,"Like many recent reviews hint this location lacks customer service. Small waiting area crammed full of people waiting to be seated although I counted at least 2 booths, 1 small table and 2 larger tables empty. Hostesses not friendly at all. I watched them walk around numerous times pointing at empty tables but doing nothing about seating customers.  Many waiting had younger kids who were getting restless. Restaurant lacks technology as we were handed a laminated number and name written down in a book. Once our number was quietly called, hostess forgot how many were in our group. Arriving at the table, a chair was found dirty. When mentioned to hostess, she comes back with a plate of napkins and 4 hand wipe packages which she just sets down on the table in front of the dirty chair. Really? She wanted us to clean our own table and chairs? At least our server brought back a rag and wiped everything down for us. No apology and dirty looks from the hostess highlighted that experience. Service was fine although refills were very slow coming. I will have to say many of the empty tables were eventually used as soon after we were seated there was hardly anyone waiting. Overall we arrived before 6 pm and didn't leave until after 8:30 pm mostly due to slow service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia
Jenn F.,"Woodridge, IL",0,4,,3.0,10/11/2016,"This was our first visit to this location in which we waited for over 2 hours to complete our meal service.  Luckily our young children were very patient as this could have been a very frustrating night.  I am thinking that the kitchen staff was short as we weren't the only ones waiting that long.  The waitress was very apologetic and at the end they even had the manager discount our meal which was a great gesture.  Overall, good experience as the food was great ... just need to make sure that staffing is solid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia
Patrick C.,"North Aurora, IL",31,4,,1.0,4/7/2017,"Sat in the bar area about 4 in the afternoon on a Saturday.  Ordered drinks appetizers and entrees, drinks came out very slow, entrees came out before appetizers.  Also got the privilige of listening to the bartender complain about the other bartenders and working there.  It's a corporate place get it together people",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia
Chelsea J.,"Rochelle, IL",126,7,1,2.0,4/24/2016,"We got here at about 10pm and they told us the dining room was closed and to sit at the bar. Totally fine! We read the specials board that was dimly lit and it said sauza $4. When the first bartender came over he said his name was chase and that melissa would be our server but he would get us drinks.  My bofriend asked for the $4 margarita. It came out, and je liked it so ordered another. When the bill came we were charged $13 for both margaritas.  When he asked she simply said no thats a different day of the week. When we explained what the previous waiter had said and pointed out the board, she said well I guess you can get my manager if you dont want to pay... which wasnt the point. Sorry sir the margaritas are not 4 dollars today, from chase would have gone a long way. There are 7 people in here... We waited ten minutes for drinks, waited on waterr refills MULTIPLE times. And we were assured ten minutes ago we would speak to a manager.... and they are still not here.  Terrible service. And do not get the boneless wings. Theyre chicken nuggets. Melissa eventually resolved our issue but overall I would say she was really the most pleasant part of our experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia
Jeff M.,"Grand Forks, ND",0,53,4,3.0,7/27/2016,Went there last Friday night.  Bar was full so we waited a little.  Then a few seats opened up.  Sat down and had a few drinks.   Ordered food.   Drinks were very good.  Bartender was really great.  She was fast and never stopped.  Very busy.   Our pizza appetizer was good.  We ordered the ribeye.   I received a strip steak instead.   Steak was cooked wrong.  Way too well done.  Ribeye that my wife had was way overcomes and very poor quality. So a word of advice if you go here don't order a steak.  The other foods were very good.   Burgers looked great.  I think we just ordered the wrong menu item.   Overall average place to go. We had a coupon otherwise most likely would not have gone there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia

Dave S.,"Saint Charles, IL",0,8,,2.0,7/1/2016,"This is very, very average. Server training appears to be non-existent.  Greeters/ Hosts are very welcoming, set a good initial tone.  Often our server is new, doesn't know the menu, and brings food that obviously has been sitting for a while before being served. Sometimes it appears that it's been microwaved to warm it up (slightly burned edges).  Everyone is nice, but this is now quite a bit down the list for restaurant choices. Maybe another TGIF would yield a better result.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia

Tom K.,"Darien, IL",149,27,1,2.0,12/29/2012,"When we arrived at the restaurant, we had a brief wait (about 5 minutes) for a table.  This was on Saturday night at 7:30 pm.  When we were seated, we were given a menu and told that the Jack Daniels specials were highly recommended.  It took quite awhile for the waiter to arrive, so I started checking out the menu, and quickly noticed that about 80% of the menu was ""Jack Daniels"" specials.  JD ribs, JD chicken, JD steak, and yes, even JD dessert!  My recommendation - if you don't like Jack Daniels, then this restaurant probably isn't for you. I ordered the Jack Daniels chicken and shrimp.  It was average at best.  The service was below average.  We were never asked for drink refills, never had any water at our table, and our check was given to us before our dessert was delivered.  They waiter didn't even provide us with napkins for our dessert. This is pretty much what you can expect from a suburban chain restaurant.  Average food, below average service.  However, if you like Jack Daniels, this is the place to go!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia?start=40

Elizabeth J.,"Geneva, IL",1,28,3,2.0,1/13/2012,Service was deplorable.

George C.,"Aurora, IL",0,40,,4.0,11/13/2015,We had a guy server who would repeat our orders and came back as fast as he could (even with his other tables) i had the jack Daniels burger which was amazing. Appetizers came quick but the food took a while but it's food. Good food isn't gonna be rushed which i like so the guy made sure our needs were met with refills. First time at that location which in my opinion was better than the one on route 59 in Aurora. I work with food a bit myself so when someone at my table would say something that didn't make sense i would tell the server differently which i saw he gladly appreciated. I try to act professional at sit down restaurants than the real professionals who tend to act like very unprofessional babies (When they're grown *** people). But i do recommend this place.

Dave Y.,"Sycamore, IL",225,191,50,4.0,12/15/2014,"Glad we didn't read a lot of the reviews before coming. We went in on a Saturday for lunch. We were seated promptly and almost immediately a friendly waitress appeared to take our drink orders. We quickly looked at the menu and ordered a flatbread spinach appetizer. It was great. Don't really remember the sandwich my wife ordered, and I wish i did because she really liked it. I got a Bleu Cheese Burger that was not only excellent, but a fairly hearty size, and I am a big fairly big guy. The fries we both got were OK, however I am not a really big fan a fires so not the best judge anyway. The waitress checked on us just the right amount and my glass was never empty. We both got desserts, and were not disappointed. The portion were big and we started to regret ordering two desserts rather than splitting.

We asked for a booth, but were repeatedly told it wasn't allowed for fire safety bc we needed a high chair also. It took talking to the manager for this happen- apparently we simply needed to be moved across the restaurant where there was more aisle room. Why not offer a customer this begin with?! 2nd issue, why on earth would you give a preschooler mac and cheese in a ceramic dish that is scalding hot? It was so hot that even after sittting there 20 mins it still almost burned my mom putting it into a to-go container (bc of course he couldn't eat this incredibly HOT food).

We first started coming to this Friday's location for the trivia nights they had every friday. we would get a big group of people together and play. The trivia was a ton of fun! The actual food was not the best but not awful-just the average chain restaurant food. Now lets talk about the real reason why I just cant give this location any more then 3 stars...the wait staff. They are just terrible! Some of them have attitudes while others seem to have ADD and can forget they even have tables. We had one waitress  that had her new born child at a table and refused to help her tables! It was crazy... Next time you head up to this location, sit at the bar.

I wasn't going to review, however after having excellent service At the last 2 restaurants we've gone too, people deserve to know how bad it was!

Now I understand it's Saturday night at 7pm but there was at least 4 open tables that I could see in our section alone. Our entrees came out rather quickly, even before the salads (because we never got those). The food was brought out by another team member, our server never came back to the table until 835! When he arrived with the bill, we handed it right back to him with a coupon. He came back and dropped it off and told us to have a good night. He didn't even apply the coupon! We had to track down a manager bc he was no where to be found. The manager sent him over with 2 free dessert coupons and an adjusted bill. He said, ""you probably think I'm incompetent but I'm not, my manager wants to talk to you"" well needless to say, the manager never came and we didn't see him again.

Bob S.,"Geneva, IL",0,115,,2.0,8/21/2014,"I have not been to Fridays in several years, but the television ads made the ""new"" menu seem decent. We went on a weekday evening for dinner. The employees seem to be trying to implement whatever the corporate plan is, but it does not work. They seem to be going through the motions. For example, two staff members open one door for customers when entering and leaving. However, there are two doors, so customers have to open the other door anyway. The host pointlessly identifies himself, says to contact him for anything we need, moments before our waiter comes to the table. The waiter then asks if we have been to Fridays recently. We answer ""no"", and expect to hear about all the wonderful changes. Instead, we are told that there are now a lot of steaks on the menu and they are recommended. In addition, if you like Jack Daniels, there are a lot of dishes you will like. I tuned him out after this unhelpful waste of words. The food was somewhat disappointing. The cheese stick appetizer was very good. Potato skin appetizer was pretty awful. Instead of real cheese, they used some sort of cheese spread. French fries were cold and greasy. On one fish dish, the fries were inexcusably presented swimming in the juice from the fish. These were not only cold and greasy, but soggy too. Portions have been decreased to pretty small amounts, although entre prices are fairly high. All in, the service was forced friendly, but not genuine. Food was subpar, over priced, and not much of it. I do not see any reason to return. Whatever changes were made to the Fridays menu and dining experience did nothing for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batavia?start=20
