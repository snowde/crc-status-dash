Beki A.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",99,171,186,5.0,4/1/2016,Great lunch here using up some vouchers from EON rewards. Speedy service with a smile from the beginning!  Plumped for a bottomless coke and a hot dog with sweet potato chips- tasty!! Food came really quickly and was so tasty when it arrived! Only thing was I had to ask for a plate as it was served in a trendy bowl which I couldn't actually get my hot dog out of!  Pickles etc on top of the Hot dog were really great and didn't cost the earth.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bath
Jenni D.,"London, United Kingdom",53,591,510,3.0,1/22/2010,"I've been to this TGI Friday twice; each time not by choice. The first time we missed a showing at the Odeon Cinema next door and had a couple of hours to kill. The second time was for a work's Christmas party. Even though it is unashamedly tacky, and full of phoney Americana paraphernalia I have to admit that I've quite enjoyed the experience!  The food is a bit on the boring side, a bit limited for vegetarians like myself, but perfectly nice. And the cocktails are calorific but extremely yummy. This particular TGI's attracts a lot of families as it's an easy place to eat at before the cinema, so if you're not kiddie friendly it's not the place for you. But if you like friendly service, decent food and a noisy atmosphere - this is the place for you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bath
Craig H.,"Bristol, United Kingdom",3,539,565,3.0,2/27/2010,"No, no, no, I really don't like these pseudo American diners. For starters, American food is horrifically bad - calorie intensive, absolutely bland and served in such large portions that you can easiiy become a statistic within a week - so why the hell do they pop up all over England, with it's far superior food and European culinary influence? Money, it's sad to say. However, here's a way of cheating the Americans at their own game. What you do is go in and get a drink and a starter (right before a movie or something at the nearby Odeon, to get the juices going before your popcorn), then leave. That's it - you've just cost the company money, as I have it on good authority that you have to spend in the region of Â£12 before any such profit is made. Try it some day. They won't like it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bath
