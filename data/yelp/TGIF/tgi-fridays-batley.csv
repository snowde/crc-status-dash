Li F.,"Leeds, United Kingdom",13,509,387,5.0,2/20/2010,"Even after all this time I still love TGI Fridays. I love it's insistance on being red and white, and I love that the owners still require staff to wear the dorkiest of uniforms and expects everyone to keep a straight face, I love the booths, I love the drinks, I love the menu. I think TGI's ROCKS! It's a day or night place to enjoy, in the day it's good for families, they cater to kids, with a colouring pack and a kid's menu which is great, and it's the only place I've ever managed to get the drop dead gorgeous Jack Daniel's Chicken dishes. YUM! Order a soft drink and get free refills, whoop. If you've still got room left in your bellies, then the dirt pie is lovely and sticky and chocolatey and divine.  The only mortifying thing is when your friends drop you in it with the staff over your birthday and they come out as a pack, standing on chairs singing the birthday song, but if it's not happening to you it's hilarious.  Moving from day through to evening, TGI's has some of the most delicious cocktails, even if they are a bit hideously expensive, but the Barnamint Baileys is to die for, even if you indulge in the massive goldfish bowl size, you can't help but gulp it down.  Good atmosphere, open day through night, delicious food, deals to be had here too, and gorgeous drinks. It's still one of my favourite places to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batley
Andrew C.,"Dewsbury, United Kingdom",4,14,1,2.0,6/1/2011,"The problem with chains such as TGI Fridays, Frankie and Benny's, Chiquito's and all the other rather ordinary restaurants at Birstall Jn27 is that they clearly have the marketing and advertising perfected to such an extent that they are nearly always full despite the substandard quality of their food and the extortionate prices that they charge. Anyway, on with the review and the positives first..... Staff are friendly and as attentive as they can be but when the place is busy it can take a while to get noticed. My children like the food and adore the slush drinks that you get there. My eldest went for the Jumbo hot dog while my youngest went for the 4oz steak which was advertised on the menu as 'well done only' so I was really pleased when it arrived slightly pink! I want my son to learn to appreciate a steak that hasn't been burnt to a cinder! The negatives..... While the decor looks great the tables and chairs did not feel too clean and was quite sticky in places, probably due to the high turnover of customers and the limited time to clean tables in between services. I ordered the 8oz 21 day matured steak cooked rare. It arrived medium, which isn't really a problem for me if it is a good quality steak but what was all that blood oozing out of the steak?! A good quality and well matured steak should not have anything oozing out so I believe the claim of it being matured 21 days is wrong.  Furthermore, a good quality steak can also be measured by its tenderness and unfortunately this one was tough! Just as well I don't eat it well done!! I've read numerous reviews about this place and a lot of them mention the tasty Jack Daniel's glaze.  Yes, it is tasty but all that salt and sugar is needed otherwise you'll realise how bland the food really is. I will probably come here again - at the insistence of my children, but that's how I see this place, It's great for parties, children and anyone just wanting to have a load of beers with their food; but if you're looking for a restaurant that offers good value, good quality food, an intimate setting for a date perhaps, then steer well clear from all the restaurants in the Jn27 complex!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-batley
