Anne J.,"New York, NY",44,46,39,4.0,10/14/2013,I visit here often and really enjoy the appetizer menu. They have great burgers and the long Island I've teas are on the money.  This is not find dining but a cool alternative.  I also life the chicken brushetta pasta very tasty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne?start=60
Gabe C.,"Fort Myers, FL",14,1,,1.0,4/19/2013,"This location honestly gives all the other Friday's restaurants a bad rep. I've been to quite a few here and there. This one in particular is probably THE WORST one to go to. The service is horrible. The servers could care less about your needs and are extremely slow. First time going I got myself a rib rack. It was burnt to a crisp, to the point of being not edible. The second, and last time I will ever go there, I ordered a burger. It was very slow that day, so I was expecting to at least have my meal in a decent time. NOPE. The appetizer (nachos) still took about half an hour by itself. And the entree (burger) took another half hour after that. In that time, our server only came to us to bring the food. Never to see if we needed anything. Seeing as I sat for half an hour waiting for a plate of nachos to come out, I went through my drink before it had arrived. That said, the server didn't even ask if I wanted a refill. Just a quick plop of the plate on the table, and back to chatting to her coworkers she went. Needless to say, never again. Had to give one star because I can't go any lower..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne?start=60
Gamalier R.,"Jersey City, NJ",75,2,1,1.0,6/8/2015,"What happened to this place. As soon as I walked in the place had a smell like if they washed the floors with sewage water. Waited 10 minutes to see someone to take us to the table. I went to the bathroom and on front of the door there was a huge puddle of water, bathroom was dirty. I them sit and another 15 minutes to wait for service. The food horrible and ribs were and tasted like it was frozen and defrosted 20 hundred times. Oh and the utensiles were dirty dirty dirty.  Never again. I didnt return the food cause they might spit on it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne?start=60

Rebecca M.,"Jersey City, NJ",12,45,,5.0,1/7/2015,"Me and my boyfriend both love this place especially on Fridays during happy hours. If you are here to get a five star meal then this isn't the restaurant you want to go to. If you are in the mood for appetizers and dessert type foods then this is totally your place. I would highly suggest to go during happy hours because appetizers are half off. Their boneless wings, fries, spinach dip, and cheesecake are amazing. I never get any entrees here but if you are in the mood, I would suggest to get the boneless steak that is marinated with garlic, it's great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne?start=60
Joe A.,"Bayonne, NJ",12,19,5,3.0,10/4/2012,"I know it's a Fridays, and so I try to keep my expectations in check. I have to say, though, that the service was my main complaint. The food was good, but our waitress was fairly apathetic. We didn't get utensils with our food, and she vanished immediately after delivering it, forcing us to have to flag down another one. We didn't see her much again for the duration of our meal, and for some time after, even as we sat waiting to order dessert. When she came back, she seemed eager to give us the check, and surprised that we wanted to order more. With any luck, it was just a fluke, or a result of choosing to sit at a table in the noisy bar area rather than wait for one in the proper dining section. It won't stop me from going back, but with Houlihan's a short drive away, and Longhorn Steakhouse in the same plaza, I've certainly got other choices if I should be in the mood for a chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne?start=60
Lone R.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,2,,1.0,6/16/2015,"I do not normally go to TGI. However, at the request of a graduate, this restaurant was chosen. I was excited to order a meal that I haven't tried which was the Pecan Crusted Salad. It was noted in the menu that it was a favorite to other. So I felt relieved in ordering it. Now, the restaurant was empty and the waiter was very confident in his customer service which was refreshing. But that refreshing moment did not last. There were mistakes made. One being the wait time for the food was not right because no one was around. Second was the service checking in on the customers. Third was the food being mediocre and the pecan crusted chicken being cold. I asked for them to warm it up. Rather than warm and make it again, they warmed it in the microwave. Which made the chicken tougher than what it was and looked inedible. My company always says I have issues with restaurants but if you are paying for food that you aren't cooking, shouldn't it be good and you should be satisfied with it? This franchise needs to change to keep its locals coming back to the business...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne?start=60
Todd J.,"Hackensack, NJ",2,15,,1.0,1/21/2016,"I had to wait nearly 20 minutes simply to be greeted by a hostess and seated. That alone is a reason to give a low review, but when I got my meal it was about half the size of something that I could get in a better restaurant. I also got a dirty look from the waitress when I didn't leave a tip as a result of this bad experience.

Bill P.,"Bayonne, NJ",0,9,,1.0,10/24/2013,This place is ghetto !! The service sucks. Try hiring people who care and actually want to work.  Food is average. The worst TGIF that I have ever been to.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne?start=60
Helen D.,"Chicago, IL",23,61,284,1.0,7/16/2014,"This TGIF is one of the worst I have been to. It is generic chain food and the service is horrendous. I have been here on 4 occasions since it opened and I either leave here feeling 'meh' or disappointed.  Let me tell you about my last experience...  First, I only went because I had a gift card to use. My husband and I went on a Sunday evening and it was not busy at all. Usually there is a crowd of people waiting to be seated. When we walked in, the hostess was not at her station.  We stood there for literally 5 minutes. A girl walks over to the hostess station, doesn't even acknowledge us, & proceeds to refill the crayon bin. We awkwardly stand there for another few minutes just kind of looking at her. Finally I say, 'Excuse me, Are you the hostess'? and she nods. I hold up my hand and say, 'Two, please' and she says ...... 'I know.' ( WTF) and goes back to restocking the crayons. After she was done, she finally seated us.  The place was pretry empty, only a few tables and as we were being seated, I couldn't help but notice dirty tables throughout the entire restaurant - at least 5 with empty plates of food left on them. Disgusting.  When our waitress comes over, she takes our drink order... brings me my selzter right away but doesn't bring my husbands beer for 10 minutes. Another waiter came by, introduced himself, & also asked for our drink order. They had to figure out who was going to get our table. Our waitress kept grabbing our glasses by the rim of the cup (my husband pointed it out - pretty unsanitary).  The food was generic chain food - nothing that spectacular.   After my last experience,  I am pretty sure I will never be returning to this place (unless it is to visit the bar and eat unhealthy appetizers, which would be rare, but is probably all this place is good for if you fancy that type of stuff).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne?start=60
Jeremy S.,"Staten Island, NY",0,1,,2.0,6/22/2014,"Most places have complaints about the service or the quality of the food but my complaint is different.  I enjoyed the service, no problems with the staff.  While the food did taste good, the portions were ridiculously small. I was with a party of 4 who all ordered different meals and everyone of us agreed that our meals were extremely small. My bacon cheeseburger had once single slice of bacon on the enormous bun that was way to big for the tiny burger. After we ate we ordered dessert which came in a timely manner, but again it was the size of the quarter cent brownies you get at the corner store and it had a half of spoonful of ice cream on it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne?start=60
K C.,"Jersey City, NJ",20,15,15,1.0,9/8/2013,Second time I've come here and the food takes forever to get to my table. The portionsare very small to nonexistant. The waitress was nice and friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne?start=60
Chris A.,"Hoboken, NJ",8,33,,2.0,7/5/2013,"Not good, not completely and utterly terrible. but certainty not good. The entire setup of the restaurant is very awkward.

Mike K.,"Bayonne, NJ",131,3,,2.0,6/5/2013,When this place opened it was decent but has slowly gone downhill.  I really enjoy the cheap beers/food during happy hour and is probably the only time that I will come.  I find often that the bartenders try hard but I have waited on several occasions for over 10 minutes just to get a refill on my beer or to even get my order taken.  I have been to other fridays and this one isn't good quality.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne?start=60

Chris R.,"Jersey City, NJ",11,30,27,1.0,10/12/2015,"So it takes a lot for me to give a place anything less than a neutral 3 star rating. This place has gone down hill quicker than a fat kid on ice down a 80 degree slope. This is our go to spot when we are in Bayonne and want something to eat. Usually during their happy hour. When the place first opened up, it was on point. Refills came without being asked for, food was on point and staff was awesome. Nowadays, people walk around with just a tee shirt on, practicing juggling behind the bar with the fake bottle or just have you wondering where your waiter/waitress is.  We come in, hostess greets us and we ask to sit at the bar because of Happy Hour and half price apps and see tells us to choose our seat as usual and we do. So we sit down, utensils are on the table ready for use BUT the table was as sticky as the underside of a high school cafeteria table. There were still some leftovers from the previous patron as well and we were given no menus.  Beforehand, our waitress is walking past us as we are walking to our table to what I'm assuming is another one of her tables and I'm assuming they were either another pair of regulars like ourselves or friends. She was talking with them for over 15 minutes. I'm saying our waitress, because there was no one else waiting tables in that section and there were only 5 tables being used and about 5 people at the bar side with their drinks and food, but the bartender I know waits those there. We waited about 10 of those minutes cause we weren't in a rush as it was the end of our day, but we are thinking, man we haven't even been offered a menu let alone a glass of water! So I suggest we sit bar side, but guess what?! We hadn't seen the bartender since we came into the establishment either! So we contemplated what should we do for 5 minutes and my gf said eh let's give them 2 minutes before we just leave. I turned to her and said nope, we are leaving. We got up and started walking out and the same hostess sends us out with a thank you for coming, hope you had a good meal and we respond by telling her we would've had to been served first in order to have a meal first, let alone a good meal.  So we left and went to 5 Guys. Where they actually enjoy making money and pleasing their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne?start=20

We sat at the bar area not crowded service was slow, plates were not cleared. I witnessed people leaving because the service was so bad. It's Friday's for gods sakes shouldn't that be one if the busiest days and staffed correctly ? Apparently from other reviews it seems like the norm. This location is not staffed correctly and will continue to suffer.  The bartender is super sweet but she was making the drinks for the tables as well as the bar because the ""second bartender"" was pulled to help host a 20 person party ... whatever.

Dan F.,"Ringwood, NJ",0,63,11,3.0,4/12/2016,"Not bad happy hour prices. The unlimited apps are a steal at $12. Started off with a PBR tall boy. $4.10 isn't too bad. Ordered the first app, the Braised Beef Nachos (forget exactly what they're called, but they were essentially nachos). Came with 4 round crispy tortillas with meet, cheese, and slaw. Not bad, but not the best nachos I've ever had. Probably would not order these as a stand alone app. Moved on to the green been fries. I enjoyed these. Though I regret eating as many as I did by myself. The sauce on the side is alright (wasabi mayo?)... ended up going ketchup with extra pepper instead. Ordered my second beer - Lagunitas IPA (large). Not bad pricing, but definitely more expensive than the PBR. 3rd ap: Boneless wings. Tasted really good, maybe a little too salty and the memphis bbq was a little too sweet for my liking. The sriracha buffalo is a little more my speed (I've had these in the past at this location). Avoid the PBJ wings like the plague (again, something I had once ordered in the past at this location). And finally the 4th ap: The Tuscan Spinach dip. Really tasty, the dip at least. Some of the chips weren't crispy and were kind of oily as if they were cooked in oil that wasn't quite hot enough. At this point I wasn't hungry enough to ask for them to be replaced. I only ate about a 1/4 of this before I finished my meal. Overall, decent. You should understand that when you go to Friday's you're getting an upscale ""fast food"". I wouldn't be surprised if not a single one of these apps didn't go from frozen to the fryer to my plate. With that understanding, Friday's does a pretty good job of this, and for really reasonable prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne?start=20

I recently went to TGI Fridays, (about 15 minutes ago) me and my husband were seated, we sat for 10 minutes waiting to be asked to order drinks, forget about the food, we weren't even asked to order drinks. What made us leave was two things: 1) it's empty in the restaurant, so what's taking so long? 2) there were two guys who were seated 5 minutes after us, and at the 10th minute of us waiting, they received their drinks So we walked out. As we walked out, the hostess looked at us, didn't question us, didn't greet us or say good-bye, nothing.

I waited about 20 minutes before someone came to my rescue. I went there for a quick bite for lunch around 1 and I couldn't leave until 245 just because of how slow they are. I mean really the moment we sat down we knew what we wanted it just takes them forever. Also they'll have you waiting in the front until they figure out who's the host to sit us down. It's a joke .

Michelle L.,"Jersey City, NJ",878,163,737,5.0,7/28/2014,"Well, I went here tonight since the kids insisted (it's their favorite place). We had the unlimited appetizers for the first time ($10 for all you can eat of any one of 6 different appetizers). My son had the boneless chicken wings & was able to switch back & forth between the various flavors (bbq, jack daniels, buffalo) every time he asked for more. I had the mozzarella sticks & farnkly, there are only so many of those you can eat, so I'm not sure it was worth it for me. My little guy had his favorite of course - mac 'n cheese which he inhaled! The best part of the evening was our server, Q, who was professional, friendly, interacted with my kids, & even got me to order dessert (which I never do here since the food is so calorie laden to start with). My boys devoured the brownie sundae, but luckily I was able to taste one bite of the brownie - which for someone like me who LOVES chocolate, it was amazing. While the food is your regular chain food, the servers overall & specifically Q elevate this to a 5 star experience, particulary if you want to grab a quick bite with friends or if you're taking the kiddies out.  Overall, the unlimited appetizer deal is good if you order the boneless wings AND if others in your party also order this promo, so that you can all share.

Then when she brings our food to the table and leaves I realize my breadsticks didn't come. And I'm looking for her I don't see her for about 8min. She then comes to our table I say my breadsticks didn't come and she then says why didn't you tell me. Are you kidding me. I wanted to say to her excuse me first of all don't blame me for you not doing your second how can I tell you job if never come by and ask are you guys ok or is the food good.

She did it separately anyway so our table were all eating at different times, we asked her why this happened and she denied that we ever asked for it to be served that way. She served us and charged us for a meal that we canceled. She again denied that we canceled it. She didn't give us napkins, so we tried to get her attention, we hear yelling from behind the bar. Apparently our waitress and 3 others were back there telling some story, acting ghetto, and cursing. My mother walks back there and then she came acting like we were bothering her. She gave us attitude the whole time. Honestly I come to fridays only cuz of this deal but my stomach turns when I see that she's our server. Please fire her!

Without even giving us a chance to respond or ask for extra napkins, ketchup, etc. The food was also horrible. With the exception of the appetizer. I ordered a medium well steak, which came out well done. It was dry and flavorless. I didn't finish it. The only think that I liked about my meal were the sides -- mashed potatoes and vegetables.

Anyenid L.,"Jersey City, NJ",12,18,23,2.0,1/5/2017,"Bourbon Mahi Mahi. I wish I took a picture of when they first brought it out. Just white pale straight from the sea. The waitress was kind enough to bring it back, but with seasonings that look like they were thrown with no regards to where they landed. Bourbon Mahi Mahi- no good. Waitress was pleasant. Manager was kind enough to discount the plate. That was extremely comforting. Staff can be heard from the kitchen spewing profanity and laughing. Good for them that they're having a good time at work, but as a business where seats are so close to kitchen, decibels should be kept at a minimum. Overall, great customer appreciation, yet not to your food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne
Sam B.,"Bayonne, NJ",11,7,1,5.0,2/11/2017,Last visit to this place was a disaster!! Service was terrible food was not enjoyable at all! This time we sat at the bar for happy hour and the appetizers were great!! The drinks and the bartender were excellent!! Our server who brought out the food could of cared less and not pleasant at all and would not bring us plates to eat our appetizers on so we used napkins lol but besides that the boneless wings and green bean fries were really good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne
Howard R.,"Jersey City, NJ",48,9,,4.0,5/23/2017,"Wasn't as satisfied as I usually am. My Jack Daniels wings were delicious, my garlic parmesan wings weren't. Last time ordering those. Our waitress was super busy with lots of tables including some away from our section. She forgot some things, but once I saw how busy she was, it wasn't a problem for us. She was a sweetheart. Wife was happy, kids were happy. Best Long Island Ice Teas my wife and I had in a good while. Will be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne
Anna P.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,1,,1.0,9/16/2017,"This place is a dump. Sadly, no one cares about this establishment. It could've done well for this city if someone actually gave a damn! We literally vomited in our plates. Unsanitary place! Expired food & horrible management. We got food poisoning eating a bad burger with rancid cheese. The so called manager did NOTHING! Called corporate immediately twice! Two days of being ill. Do not chance it by eating here! NOT WORTH YOUR HEALTH!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne
Dave F.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,,1.0,4/1/2017,This place was empty and I go in with my family of 4 and sat at the table for 15 min without being asked our order pr drinks. I got up and walked out !!! Never going back there again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne
Kisha P.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,2,6,1.0,9/11/2016,"Beyond ridiculous, came to watch the giants game and was told I have to break my neck to watch it.  The Manger stated they have to acomidate other games, mind you the majority of people here are for the giants. Your food or service is not even that great. Just came here for the games now not even that. Thanks",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne
Ana S.,"Jersey City, NJ",474,8,4,1.0,2/25/2017,"Worst service ever. Late food, some of it never arrive. Poor customer service from the server, he look like he was high on some substance. No utensiles. Managers explanation was that the food would take longer. Not acceptable. Horrible. Will never come here again. I would had given them 0 stars but thats not an option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bayonne
