Tiannna S.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,,1.0,6/11/2017,"Customer service was horrible. We sat at our table for 25 minutes no one waited on us, no one came to ask if we needed water or anything. I had asked 3 diffrent people what was going on is someone coming they all just looked crazy. When they finally came she told us we had to automatically tip i told her no and to get the manager When he finally came he was being an asshole he told me to pretty much come correct to get what i want etc. And i did just that i told him politely i wasnt going to come at him in any way becuase it wasnt a need the way he came to the table was rude. I told him about the service and that i was not tipping a waiter or anyone for that matter 25 minute wait thats absurd.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bedford-park?start=20
Ali G.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,2,1.0,7/17/2016,"If I could give a worse rating than 1. Listing in bullet points would be a better delivery of the dismal service my friends and I received. 1. We were sitting at our table for more than 5 minuets before we were greeted by our server.  2. It took her more than 10 minuets before my friends and I received our waters. (We were parched from a long day of working in the sun.) 3. Then, after neglecting to put in our order in, she brought out our appetizer with our entree. 4. When my friend ordered a second beverage, spent definitely 5 min talking to her friends away from the bar. 5. She finally brought out her drink, then the check right after and neglected to bring the to go box we requested. 6.  On the check, she put a request for us to pick a tip percent. None of which we found fit. 7. Then as my friends and I are leaving, she had the audacity to come after us with a security guard and ACCUSED MY FRIENDS AND I OF SKIPPING ON THE CHECK! She said and I quote "" You didn't pay your tab, did you?"" 8. When explaining our horrible experience to the security guard, as our server was inside checking  the book we left visible on the table, he said ""I'm not surprised that's the service you got."" 9. Then to top it all off, she didn't have the stomach to apologize for the blatant disrespect. My friends and I are all in the service industry and we were completely appalled with our treatment in this particular TGI Fridays.  So thank you Paris, we had a blast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bedford-park?start=20

Johnny B.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,,2.0,5/2/2017,This TGI Fridays on 66th and Cicero was accommodating - the waiter - but the tibs were not good. They were stiff and almost cold. I didn't enjoy them at all.

Yolanda T.,"Bellwood, IL",118,108,71,3.0,2/3/2017,"We went out tonight to celebrate my daughter's academic achievements. She chose this restaurant to celebrate. TGI Friday's used to be better than this. I drove out of my way and avoided the Oak Park location because I though that I would get better service here. The service wasn't bad, but it could've been better. It was slow first of all. They need to hire more staff for busy nights. We didn't have to wait for a table. He (Bobbie) took forever to take our drink and food order. It took longer than average for the food to come out. I ordered the Jack Daniels Ribeye steak. I asked for it to be cooked done, not well done. The steak was definitely overcooked and it was also thin. I had mashed potatoes and Mac n cheese as sides. Of course the sides were small portions. He did apologize for our wait time, so I guess it was acceptable. It was also cold in the restaurant.

Madeleine A.,"Bedminster Township, NJ",0,7,,3.0,10/8/2017,"First and foremost I would like to give a heads up to all of you vegetarians out there: the options are quite limited for us. And by quite, I mean little to none. Seeing as I didn't want just leaves or soup for dinner, I ended up ordering the veggie burger out of these two options. Let me just throw out here as well, there is not one healthy option here on the menu. However, if you're like me and change it up a bit, then you're meal will not be too artery clogging as the rest. For one, you can order the burger green style (lettuce bun) which was great in my opinion. Anyway, our waiter was very nice and patient with my longer order listing what I didn't want with my burger and such. My meal came as expected, and I was very please with the quality and taste of it. Although, a little complaint of mine is that I ordered my salad without cheese, and it still was brought with it. Other than that, the experience was nice and while I most likely won't be eating here again unless a friend wants me to come along, I will say that TGI wasn't too bad at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bedford-park?start=20

Why are so many needed when only half greet you and other just stand there? The answer was short staff in the kitchen.  Waitress was nice and we ordered our food and strip chips. kids food came out food and so did our appetizers yet no chips. Finally chips came and our dinner. I ordered steak and my wife the sizzling chicken with shrimp. It wasn't sizzling nor was it made like before. the cheese was on the bottom and chicken and shrimp places on top. Looked very bland and we did send it back.

Our server Jesus was super nice and attentive with us. He made my dinner here great. We ordered 2 bruschetta chicken pastas .. as far as I remember from 3 years ago at another TGI the pasta is angel hair, with little to no tomato sauce because it's not a tomato pasta.. and the chicken is supposed to be nice and grilled ! I loved this dish. The food came out and yeah, i was pretty disappointed. So much tomato sauce, the chicken was almost raw I didn't eat it.

Kristian R.,"Oak Park, IL",139,42,,1.0,3/31/2017,"I visited this Friday's yesterday around 9PM. Sat at the bar with my friend had a salad and a cocktail. I ordered a Jack Daniel's medium Steak & Shrimp at first, however, it did not look like a steak it looked like processed meat and definitely wasn't medium, more like well done.  After sending that back ...  I ordered ""Sizzling Chicken & Shrimp"" - Hold the onions. After eating half the plate of food ... I had an extremely nauseous moment. I turned to look at my friend with my mouth covered and immediately ran towards the bathroom.  After about 20 steps ....I instantly threw up all the food near the kitchen entrance. Here's the best part ... 1. The manager never came to see if I was okay.  2. I had to call for the manager to come talk to me because they were still trying to charge me for the meal that I threw up.  3. Not only did she have terrible managerial skills ... She had the audacity to have a debate with me and tell me she wasn't going to refund my meal that I ""threw up"" since I finished nearly the whole plate.  4. I never finished the plate, plus, I threw the half that I had up on their floor. Long story short ... I ""loved"" TGI Friday's anyone can tell you that it was my go to spot. I even accumulated more then 2,000 reward points. So I ate their for free all the time. After threatening the manager with legal actions she eventually took the meal off my tab. I still paid for the salad and cocktail.  I haven't been to a TGI Friday's ever since, I don't plan on going anytime soon and definitely not back to this location.

I waited 20 minutes for a drink because the bartender was in the back. The manager actually asked me if there wasn't another staff member around to make it.

Damian P.,"Chicago, IL",607,701,1838,3.0,1/7/2013,"Unfortunately Hooters was full and this was the last resort, and can I stress that this was the LAST RESORT! Someone shoot me right now! What was I thinking?  Our waiter felt the need to pick up my phone because of its cover and said ""oh that's really cool"".  If this is any Indication to how this visit will be, ""OH LORD""!  Appetizers: hmmm cheese sticks seem burnt. I think it's the oil, but the green beans (fried) are not bad. Boneless chicken wings are pretty good and the sauces are decent. The only thing I didn't appreciate was the fact that I saw our waiter cleaning (pretending while he watched the Basketball game) and didn't care if he picked up food plates and still serve.  I do have to say that the customers seemed to of had a night off from Bellevue Mental Institution. I mean, I know no one knows one another, judging by the different themes that they are all bringing  to each table (but wow is there something in the water up in here). I refuse! These customers were really on something, and judging by the odor of THC (tetrahydracanabinol) I think its safe to say, its a definite hit.  The Black Bean burger tasted so much like a can of black beans, needed salt (and I NEVER salt my food), the fries were as limp as a gay man waiting to watch a bunch of woman streak the San Antonio Astrodome!  Seeing the workers all just doing their own thing and just watching the basketball game while ignoring customers was really disappointing. Not to mention the waiter putting us in a small 2 seat banquet. Just the most uncomfortable situation, but of course, we couldn't have a bigger table since it was just two of us. And mind you, I am far from being a size 30! Just not a good situation. I will not go on, but seeing as I asked a few people what their experiences were at the TGIF family, and many said the same thing, they lack a certain air of caring.

Phil M.,"Morelia, Mexico",0,3,,1.0,9/26/2016,"I have been to this location three times over the past few years. First time was great, second time was iffy, the third time was my last. When you walk into a place, and the first thing you see is a card on the table telling you the service is so excellent that after 10:00 pm they have to charge you an 18% gratuity, that tells me you don't want to be there for several reasons. I will only elaborate on two. The service and the food.  I was greeted at the door and offered seating at the bar or a high top. I asked for a regular table, and watched the hostess give whoever was at the door with her an eye roll. Minus five, right there. There were tables all over, and I had to be seated at a dirty two top... That never got wiped off. By the time my soup came with a spoon, I still had not been given a napkin or other silverware. I had to ask for it when my salad came.  I ordered a chicken club baguette to carry out and eat when I got back to my hotel room. I finished my soup and salad, and was brought my check along with the carry out box with my sandwich on a plate.  I was never asked if I wanted a refill on my soda. I was brought a check without the gratuity added, then another one with the gratuity added. I really should have asked to speak with the manager, but I try to be a little conscious of the fact that some folks might be having a bad day, so I didn't.  I also didn't appreciate hearing my waitress and a bus person complaining about another employee, and how she needed to go ""F"" herself.... An hour later the sandwich was inedible. It smelled bad, the bacon was undercooked, the chicken was dry and salty, the avocado was gross... I took one bite, started removing the nasty parts, and ended up with a low quality baguette. Needless to say, the garbage can got the whole mess. So... In closing... I realize that they probably have a tipping issue with their late night clientele, but regarding the imposed 18% gratuity, all I saw was an excuse for the waitstaff to slack off and get away with poor service.  I'll go somewhere else the next time I have to spend the night in the hotel next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bedford-park?start=40

Trinh D.,"Baton Rouge, LA",185,43,60,4.0,5/22/2015,Josh our server was very efficient! Checked on us very often! Very quick with our drinks! Friendly staff. Had the steak with mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese. Mashed potatoes were amazing! Asked for medium cooked steak but got more of a medium well (but had that in consideration when making the order... Seeing as how this isn't a steakhouse) wouldn't recommend getting the Mac and cheese.... Dry and not very tasteful at all. Also had the shrimp/chicken Alfredo... Not bad but not amazing. Satisfied about the atmosphere and service and food was great considering I was expecting so-so food (seeing as how i don't expect much from chained restaurants),https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bedford-park?start=40

Anthony U.,"Chicago, IL",759,262,2661,2.0,2/6/2014,I've eaten here a few times in the past year and this is likely to be my last. The location is easy to get to within the Midway Airport Hotel Center and parking is never an issue. Parking lot is patrolled by security and is well lit. This TGIFriday is my least liked of the 20+ I have visited. Here the associates always greet you as expected but that's where the smiles end. Wait staff are usually unhappy sour people and this evening our waiter even told us he was having a terrible day. It's always difficult to get drink refills here both alcohol and soft drinks and tonight I had to again flag down another waiter to finally get another beer. Food is average for a TGIFriday and plates are often hot and food dry from sitting under warming lamps too long.  Better to eat at the Asian place across the street on Cicero with great food and service even if the parking lot is small.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bedford-park?start=40

It was packed with tourists and fans alike so I was prepared to turn around until we were greeted as soon as we walked in and told it would be a 10 minute wait. We sat in the waiting area with other patrons and sure enough about 10 minutes later we were called and seated in the back quietly at a table. Our waitress was a kind lady with glasses that waited our table and got our drinks promptly water and cocktails. We placed our order for appetizers and entrees and two more drinks. The appetizers came out piping hot with the other drinks. The potato wedges were a bit dry but everything was great on our appetizer trio. Our food came and was hot as well, I ordered the parmasean crusted chicken with broccoli and mozzarella tomato salad. The chicken breast was small but well seasoned and the broccoli was okay. I was looking forward to the mozzarella and tomato salad but it had too many red onion and not enough mozzarella. All in all I was pleased with the service and food.

I ordered a beer and he left, so I started looking at the menu, I wasn't hungry for a big meal so I saw this ""NEW"" triple deck Reuben, the description said it had horseradish sauce on each of the layers along with the usual sauerkraut and swiss...that sounded interesting so when I finally got my beer I ordered the Reuben. I asked if I could get something else instead of fries since I am not into fried foods and I was told the only substitution would be chips, no salad or fruit. I took the chips. When my food arrived the chips were deep fried potato slices oozing grease and cold. The first bite of my Reuben was overwhelmed by the greasy buttery oil used to toast bread on a grill. There was no hint of Horseradish. I looked for my waiter and he was not to be found (the place wasn't busy at all) so I asked the busboy to get him. When he came, I asked him about the horseradish and he told me they were out so it wasn't on the sandwich (this was the primary reason I ordered it in the first place!) I asked for the manager and when he showed up I asked if my waiter was new, he wasn't. I told the manager about the length of time it took to get served and the lack of concern about the quality of food. I suggested that if the ingredients weren't available for an item the staff should know and it shouldn't be served. I suggested that retraining was in order and he told me he didn't think so! He dismissed me and walked away, then a few minutes later another beer showed up and I told my server I didn't order it and didn't want it (it was ""on the house"" to make up for the poor service and food. I didn't finish my meal as it was gross). I asked for the manager again and when he came over I asked if the restaurant was a franchise or corp unit and I asked for contact information. When my check arrived there was no charge and the phone number and contact name was written. There were no apologies, nothing. Because this restaurant has a ""captive audience"" and due to the lack of other eating places I guess they figure the quality of food and service doesn't matter because they are pretty much the only place and you get what they give you. I strongly recommend that if you stay in the Midway Hotel Complex, DON'T eat here. Go to the McDonald's a few blocks away. You'll get better food and service for sure!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bedford-park?start=100
Andrew C.,"Atlanta, GA",0,10,,3.0,6/19/2013,"Pretty standard, they have some good ""healthy"" choices on the menu. Had the dragon fire chicken, seemed fresh...good strong flavor on the mango salsa. Very small amount of broccoli, which left the plate half empty...rice pilaf was bland and flavorless. The chicken was cooked well and made up for the sides. Also, this was the loudest restaurant I have ever been in my life. The waitress had to lean right down to my mouth to hear my order.

DRINKS: The Beefeaters Martinis were good and made with optional blue cheese stuffed olives.  That's on the plus side. APPETIZER: Ordered boneless buffalo wings.  They were good, no complaints. MEAL: I ordered their top of the line Jack Daniels Rib Eye steak.  Mediocre at best.  It was tough, thin and flavorless.  One of the poorer steaks I have had on the road.  It came with two sides and I took two sides of broccoli.  The broccoli was nearly raw, maybe blanched but very difficult to eat.  I don't like it over done, that's worst, but 5 minutes in a steamer is about right.  I did not finish the meat or the broccoli. SERVICE: Sat at the bar and bartenders were attentive.  Service was prompt, everything was good. QUALITY: Meats are not up to par, next time I'll stick with the hamburger. ATMOSPHERE: On a Thursday night the place was busy and I like that.  I hate sitting in a restaurant with just 4-5 people.  This was okay, it's predictable Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bedford-park?start=100

I sent them back and asked for no charge on those (which I got). The italian chicken sandwhich was average.  Come to think of it, the TGIF menu in general is pretty bad.

It was supposed to have pepper jack, avocado,spicy onion strips, onions , and tomato. The worst were the spicy onion strips, because they were soggy and dripping with oil. The pepper jack cheese was just gross. all the other toppings were okay. The fries were are a very big sticking point for me for two reasons: the portion size and they were covered in salt and pepper. You get more fries in a small order at McDonald's, and they taste way better. not to mention the ridiculous amount of salt and pepper. The price was ridiculous 9.39 for a burger: i would at least expect for it to come with a drink, but no 3 dollars for a coke, i love coke but for three dollars c'mon that's just stupid expensive.
