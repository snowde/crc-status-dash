Apephanie P.,"Philadelphia, PA",120,156,567,4.0,12/19/2017,It's a roll of the dice whenever I come here sometimes it's perfect other times just okay. I guess it depends on who is working at the time. This time I came and sat at the bar. Ordered my drinks plus food. Drinks were OK. Ordered a Long Island and I wasn't thrilled on how it was made. Everyone can't make a Long Island. Only half of my food came out I had to ask for my side order which I'm assuming they forgot. I also ordered jack daniels ribs to go & can you believe they forgot the jack daniels sauce smh. Again coming here is like a roll of the dice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2
Mindy R.,"Bensalem, PA",0,1,,1.0,11/9/2017,"Women Be Warned! Don't complain or you will be given a token Appetizer card and then the Manager - Rob McKeeithan - will say ""So, am I forgiven? Give me a hug to prove it!"". He will then proceed to put his arms around you, chest to chest without waiting for a response.  Corporate has yet to respond since I reported this on 11/5.   Since this behavior seems acceptable as Friday's has chosen to ignore the issue, don't go there unless you want to be assaulted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2
Kelly P.,"Philadelphia, PA",15,68,5,1.0,11/1/2017,"This place is just...sad. We walked in behind another couple. The hostess was just taking them to their table, and asked another employee (who was sitting there near the entry) to take us to one. This employee snapped back about not clocking in for another few minutes. The hostess left with the other couple without saying anything back. But then the unprofessional one stood up, coughed all over without covering her mouth, and took us to a table anyway. I didn't even want to touch the menus at that point. A waitress came over promptly and was nice enough, but when we asked for another minute, she took 10 before returning. The food took forever, and arrived lukewarm at best. My husband's fries were cold. The 'crispy Brussels sprouts' I ordered were really salty and pretty much inedible. What I presume was cheese in my mashed potatoes had also started to solidify due to not being hot.  Our waitress had checked on us before we'd really gotten a bite in, so we didn't realize just how off the meal was. And then she vanished again. I had to wave her down from across the room for the check. At that point, we didn't want to wait 20 min for her to find a manager. The meal had already taken way longer than it should have. Ironically, we just got a $50 gift card to Fridays this week, and we don't even want to use it. That's how poor an impression this place has left on us. We're just going to give it away. After equally bad experiences with the Willow Grove Fridays, we were hoping that was an isolated issue and this one would be better. We we wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2
Jeff R.,"Wayne, PA",0,14,,2.0,1/10/2018,"I never expect much from this kind of restaurant.  We had Parmesan and Garlic wings and a Cobb Salad.  The wings were really, really good.  The Cobb Salad was okay.  Service was mediocre, but our waiter realized it and comped us dessert.  He gets high marks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2
Charlotte D.,"Philadelphia, PA",87,191,50,1.0,6/26/2017,"This place is just terrible. I sat at the bar and got endless apps. We sat here for close to ten minutes before the bartender appeared again. I watched 3 people send back their food and if I felt like complaining, I would have been the 4th. The bartender was clearly overworked and annoyed at the kitchen (as he should be).  The post stickers' outing was tough as if they weren't fully steamed; or freezer burnt....I'm honestly unsure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2
Stephen B.,"Philadelphia, PA",181,419,1036,1.0,9/7/2016,"So much has changed with TGI FRIDAYS... It's so disappointing, the best part of my visit was being seated a.s.a.p, Thats why only one start. Other then that I waited 15 min for my drink, then I placed my order that was another 30 min. Then when it did arrived, I was shocked by the fact that they don't give you many fries on the plate. And a freind of mind ask to substitute the reg fries for potato fries. The waitress says we don't sell potato fries anymore. Then he ask waitress for baked potato instead, she says we don't sell baked potatos anymore. I was somewhat speechless that a business this type don't even sell baked potatos anymore.  Then after was done eating I received my check. When I gave the girl the money I waited over 40 min just to receive my change.

Dalton D.,"Northeast Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA",0,7,7,3.0,9/17/2017,"Wasn't the best, but wasn't totally the worst. Got seated within minutes, but the service slowed down almost immediately after that. It was a good 5+ minutes before we even seen our waiter. Got the Endless Apps (Mozzarella Sticks, Chicken Quesadillas, and Pot Stickers) and BBQ'n Burger. Initially forgot the onion rings that go on the burger, which is part of the reason it's $12. Other than that, the food was a little above average. Again, nothing special. Probably won't be heading to this restaurant again in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2
Fany H.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,2,,1.0,11/5/2017,"Came in for lunch around 12pm and server with glasses, slender body and long black hair in braids, everything was fine until I questioned her on a breakdown of the bill. I was not debating the price but more of an explanation of how they came up with the amount. She become nasty & defensive, rolling her eyes, huffing & puffing (what are you a child) and had the damn nerve to say that I added the bill up wrong!! Who is the server, me or you?! I work as H.R in the restaurant field and if she was my employee would be sent home & lose 2 shifts!! Number one rule in the hospitality field is - NEVER ARGUE OR GO BACK & FORTH WITH A CUSTOMER!!  She must have missed the memo in training!! She needs a coaching & a redirect. The manager was a slightly older lady with short blonde hair in a ponytail she came to see what happened; but sadly the damage was already done.

Dan O.,"Philadelphia, PA",29,3,,1.0,11/10/2017,"I wish I could rate this a Zero. We came during happy hour and the bar was nearly empty. One bartender and no server at the bar. After a long wait we ordered mozzarella stick as an app, 4 pieces one of which was empty breading. One of our party ordered a chicken sandwich that came out looking like a hockey puck. We sent it back for one that would be correctly that took a half hour. We were here for over two hours.

Vince M.,"Feasterville-Trevose, PA",2,30,,1.0,2/19/2017,"The positives, they take reservations. I have been going to TGIFriday - Bensalem since it opened and thru all the incarnations.  Seated promptly with reservations, then waited 20 minutes for a server and another 15 for soft drinks. Tried all you can eat appetizers. They came out 5 minutes before the entree. Reordered app and that was out fairly quick. Se rver took some time to return and we had to wait for ketchup and mustard. An adjacent table was having some issues and it required manager, hostess and server while all the tables around them were ignored.  Will think long and hard about returning and especially since this location is directly next to a casino. The food was decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2

Since it was the middle of the day the restaurant was mostly empty yet our waiter was hard to find when we needed him.

Caitlin S.,"Philadelphia, PA",113,28,16,1.0,11/26/2016,"The worst service from all staff, front of house, and bartenders. Cold food! Even came back cold for a second time. Damn heat lamps! Salad, soup and burger pre-made.  The burger was like a hockey puck and forgot to bring my toppings. Fries were cold, brought a second order with no seasoning.  French onion was bland and not melted cheese. Caesar was soggy.  Cmon people. It's a burger soup and salad get it together. I do not recommend this place. The bartender just asked if I'd like another drink white her mouthful. Christine. The opposite of a delight. I'm watching the bartenders serve a man who is sleeping at the bar.

We were seated near both the kitchen entrance and the hostess stand, so we heard a good amount of personal (loud) conversation but if it's not too busy I can't blame them when there's so many staffed with what seems like not too much to do.

Tom G.,"Churchville, PA",1,6,6,1.0,6/22/2016,"We were returning from a day in Philadelphia to our homes in Buck county. It was dinner time so we agreed to look for a place to eat. We passed up a few other restaurants that had long wait times to be seated.  We spotted a TGIF Fridays and quickly decided to stop for a bite. To our parties amazement, we were quickly seated, and that's when the experience started to go downhill. The table was sticky and on further inspection so was the floor. Evidently an earlier patron spilled their beer. While gazing at the sticky stains I sized up the general cleanliness of my surroundings.  It looked as if they had not swept or washed the floors for who knows when. Trash and various pieces and parts off of the bussed plates were everywhere.  The waitress was obviously overworked and unsmiling.  She took our drink orders and reappeared in what seemed like 10-15 minutes. While waiting for her to return with our beverages, we collectively had ample time to take in the menu. I'll admit that it's been a while since I last visited a TGIF's... but WOW the prices were outrageous. This is definitely NOT a fine dining restaurant. We finally settled on some of the apps and smaller portion dinner entries.  The four of us were equally disappointed with the quality of our offerings, Which ranged from the Jack-sliders to the Chipotle Yucatan chicken salad, and two of the Bruschetta chicken pasta. The sliders contained questionable (mystery )meat and were over cooked. The salad was dry and flavorless, the chicken desert dry. The pasta was undercooked as well. If you spot a TGIF Friday's run, don't walk, as fast as your little legs can take you, in a direction far, far away from this nightmare.  You may thank God that it's Friday... you'll thank yourself for passing on this insult to dining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2

Rainy R.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,43,8,2.0,12/14/2016,"First time went with friends who were visiting from Britain and the food was ok, nothing special. Waitresses seemed unhappy to be there. Drinks were very watered down. I didn't care to go back, but another day a group of friends wanted to go and my husband and I agreed figuring maybe we'd gone on a bad night?  Nope. Worse service ever. Some of us were served while others waited long periods between being served. I was served last after everyone was finished eating. We all had to ask for silverware and the waitress only gave us 4 when there were 6 of us. She forgot our drinks repeatedly and we had to ask for napkins as well.

Courtney F.,"Philadelphia, PA",50,84,52,1.0,4/15/2017,"Absolutely terrible. This place went down hill fast!! I went here many times over the years, and had about a 5 year hiatus since this last visit. I'll stick to the facts- but everything they did (or didn't do) seemed to top the last disappointing thing.  We were sat right away, which was the only positive. We ordered a French onion soup to start, and a Bloody Mary. Both took well over 20 minutes. The soup, I can understand. The drink- the waitress had in her hand while chatting casually for 5+ minutes before dropping off to our table! Watered down by that point. The onion soup was embarrassing. No crusty cheese, just broth. We thought it was an error! But, no, they assured us this was their normal presentation. Cannot comment on taste as it was not appetizing enough to try. Skip to salad. Our salads not only came with wrong ingredients (red onions instead of green- big breath difference). Asked for tomatoes and got two measly cherry tomatoes. Also- dressing on the side? Never came! Told the waiter immediately upon delivery who apologized and said he would grab it. Fast forward 10 min, still no sight of waiter. I physically had to find a random worker to get our dressing.

Leslieann D.,"Churchville, PA",15,71,30,1.0,2/15/2017,"I've been to this establishment several times but by far this has been the worst"" I will not go back. Where should I start? I asked for a Gluten-Free menu when walking through the door as I did not need to wait since my party had already been seated. The hostess looked through the drawer and finally found an 'Allergy Free' menu. She handed it to me and I proceeded to my table. This is the worst, hard to read menu I've ever seen. Do not expect help from it. You need to have and rely on your on knowledge anyway. Long story short..... Asked for Margarita with NO salt, came back with salt and very weak, small glass, a lot of ice ( asked for little ice). So weak and small, drank it in less than 2 minutes. Waitress came by and said, "" OMG, is there a hole in that glass!"" ( how dare she) I said, ""It's so weak, all ice and I am not allowed to have salt!"" She went to get another one, same thing except no salt. This whole episode lasted 20 minutes. Mind you, place was almost empty at 1:00 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon.  She finally took our orders. My order, food runner messed up bc I asked for steamed spinach instead of Cole slaw due to food allergies, guess what came out!? Waitress caught it, waited 10 minutes for that. While waiting for that, other party waited 20 minutes for extra dressing for a dry salad. When she received it, I was finished my meal. Shame, I am usually a decent tipper, not this time. Poor service for an almost empty restaurant. Used to be okay, not now, not for lunch anyway!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2?start=20
George D.,"Asheville, NC",1,43,15,1.0,9/12/2016,"Sadly, since the inception of the new streamlined menu and the remodeling of this TGIF, the menu is more that of a burger bar and the options for sides has been greatly reduced. The broccoli that my wife and I ordered was so rubbery that it was not eatable. One pasta dish on the menu now and the steak and shrimp that we loved is now steak with shrimp as an added side. Lastly, there were new servers there on our last two visits. The one brought our appetizer to us after we were half way through our meal because she forgot about it and the server who took our complaint about the broccoli let us know that she didn't make it. Needless to say, TGIF is no longer on our list of places to dine at. There are far too many restaurants that will appreciate our business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2?start=20

Second time I went because I had to meet my boss there for a meeting .Same thing short staffed and bartender seemed to have a attitude problem he was nice for the most part maybe he was annoyed with something else but not professional.

Lisa G.,"Wildwood Crest, NJ",11,8,,1.0,8/14/2016,My family of 4 have been to this restaurant 3 times in the past two weeks. Each time we have purchased 1 meal and ordered two endless appetizers. ALL 3 times the managers explained that if no one was getting a meal then each person at the table would be charged $10 each for the endless apps. But if 1 meal was ordered then we would only be charged for two endless apps at $10 each.  Today we were told by the manager on duty that we couldn't do that. Every person would be charged $10 if they didn't get a meal ($40) even though we were only getting two apps ($20 value). My problem is the inconsistency with their policy and lack of communication with each other.

My family and I came here for dinner a few days ago.  From the moment we sat down to when we walked out the door we were shaking our heads.  In summary: I asked for a large beer.  Got a small glass of beer.  Ordered French onion soups.  Got bowls of someone's ""interpretation"" of French onion soup instead.  Namely, a small bowl of cold broth with a piece of cheese covered bread floating in it.  My family were served theirs, while I waited about five minutes for mine to eventually arrive.  My daughter's salad? Arrived few minutes after that.  Also, soups were brought with teaspoons, not soup spoons. Meals also arrived one at a time, many minutes apart.  All the while, we watched the wait staff standing around, talking to each other.  Most were giggling with one another, occasionally hugging one another like they were at a party or something.  They seemed ""put upon"" to go and take care of their tables. Our waitress? Never even asked us if we wanted dessert.  Or refills for our drinks.  Or if our we were happy with our meals.  She was VERY quick to bring us the check and get our payment though.  No doubt she was eager to get back to her conversation with another waitress she was chatting with by the kitchen entrance.  Shame on us for pulling her away! The only really positive part of the whole experience was watching the menagerie of staff when they managed to break away from their conversations and actually go take orders or serve food.  We gave them all names as they passed our table.  Here's a few: ""Tattoo Arm,"" ""Nose Ring,"" ""Hugs a Lot,"" ""Laughs too Much,"" ""Barely Legal,"" and ""Almost Dropped Everything."" Add one more ""used to be"" to the list.  Namely, we ""used to be"" here to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2?start=40
Ryan C.,"Boxford, Boxford, MA",125,2,,1.0,5/29/2017,I'm a huge fan of Friday's .. I used to go there at least a few times a night back home and I just moved here a couple weeks ago .. I've been to this fridays now about four times and it is absolutely the worst place you could possibly go ever... I'm still a fan of Friday's but this one is as bad as it could possibly get .. ordering drinks at the bar is a nightmare and I've sat about 15 to 30 Minutes in between drinks at least a few times now .. the food is good as always but good luck getting it in a reasonable time frame .. one word of advice never order the endless wings because by the time the second order comes out you'll be ready to leave ... also the worst thing about this place besides the extremely terrible service is the fruit flies .. there are everywhere ! Over your food your beer and constantly flying around it's bs! The worst part is I'm A huge fridays fan but this place has some serious issues.. I would assume it starts with management .

The service wasn't any better.  There was a special on a certain draft beer - making it the same price for two sizes of the beer.  The waitress brought us out the smaller size, twice, and told us that it was okay because it was the same price (even though we were getting a smaller glass).

Instead some other staff member talked to someone else on the phone right in front of 4 waiting guests.  #2: we waited 20 minutes outside for a table when there were maybe 1/4 open tables in the place. We did overhear an explanation from a hostess to another group of annoyed guests that they had a no-show and their manager couldn't make it in. Kind of crazy that two missing staff members would cripple a TGI Friday's on a Friday... #3: we were then seated and waited another 20 minutes while not 1 but 2 parties, one of four and one of eight, were both seated, greeted, and had their drinks brought to them while we sat completely forgotten by any staff.

Cindy N.,"University City, Philadelphia, PA",12,23,359,1.0,3/14/2015,"I am so disgusted with the service and professionalism of this location, if given the opportunity I don't think one star is even worth giving.  On March 13th 2015 my boy-friend and I decided to come to this establishment to celebrate his graduation night and all of his recent achievements. Before placing our appetizers my friend had ordered a House Long Island Ice Tea (LIIT). As our waitres brought out the appetizer my friend had ordered another LIIT. After sharing a few appetizers our entrees came out and that's when my friend had ordered another LIIT. Towards the end of our meal and before wanting to order desert our waitress had asked us if we needed anything else and my friend asked for another LIIT and she softly said let me ask if they will ""let"" you have another one, confused she walked away and within' a few minutes a man I'm assuming was the manager came with the check and asked us if we needed anything else.  We proceeded and told him that we had asked our waitess for another LIIT and didn't know what the problem was...and he proceeded to say how he couldn't serve us any more drinks due to the amount we have already ordered and left.  Now, being a business owner myself I understand that ""if"" there were a 3 limit drink in the companies policy then their decision this night is understandable. But that wasn't the case. If my friend had acted ill mannered due to his alcohol consumption such as speaking sluggish, not being able to walk or stand I would understand that limiting his drinks is in his best intrest but again that definitely wasn't the case. We are adults and would like to be treated with the respect that we are responsible enough to know our limits.  If there were any concern for my friend and his alcohol consumption they could of approached us more professionally. Such as, asking if my friend was driving or if he was okay. But both the waitress and manager fail to do so.  Overall, I feel very upset over this situation and will be taking it to corporate.

Staci F.,"Ringtown, PA",0,1,,1.0,3/29/2017,"For starters, I want to make it clear that I love TGI Fridays as a whole- I've been to several and have pretty much always enjoyed myself. With that being said, this is by far the worst TGI I've ever stepped foot in. I travel a lot for work and often stay in hotels so I'm always looking for a decent meal at a reasonable price. It wasn't incredibly busy- a semi-full restaurant on a Wednesday night. I asked for a seat at the bar and was told to seat myself but when I went up the bar was full. I walked back to the hostess and asked her for a table instead since there was no room at the bar and she told me I'd have to wait as she stood waiting to seat the couple that was walking up to the restaurant from outside. So I stood another 5 minutes waiting to be seated at any one of many open tables. Still not a big deal, until I sat at my table for 15 minutes before anyone approached me to take my drink order. When my waitress came up she was fairly rude, she just walked up to my table and stared at me without saying anything. Taking the hint that I wasnt even going to get a ""hello"" I went ahead and gave her my drink order and my food order for the Endless Apps right away. I then waited another 20 minutes for my drink as I sat eating my food. None of this would have been an issue if it weren't for the fact that 1) the weren't very busy as previously stated and 2) i watched my waitress stand around talking to coworkers with her back turned to me.

Now I get that if it was slammed packed he might say something like that. It wasn't packed to say the least. Well my wife and I waited for the 20 or do minutes.

They microwaved the heck out of the marinara sauce to the point of it being sticky and dry! I've never seen that before. We muddled through the app even though it was cold, hoping for a hot meal. My wife ordered a BBQ chicken salad, and I ordered a simple fried chicken sandwich. After another 5-10 minutes they showed up.

Andrew W.,"Blue Bell, PA",0,8,,1.0,8/29/2015,"So I know when you go here you get boxed/frozen food so the bar is low.  The problem is that this place was so far below the bar it isn't even funny.... The server took forever to get drinks to us or even acknowledge that we were there and I had to go get my own silverware.  Because she ran by without checking on us.  Next the food came out wrong, my buddy got the wrong wings, finally when the entrees came out sizzling chicken and cheese was far from sizzling in fact it was a slice of American cheese under a chewy gross chicken breast.  And the potatoes, well they had no taste and a bad texture.  From there no sign of the waitress until I asked for the manager and her response was lackluster and his was as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2?start=60
Jamie M.,"Conshohocken, PA",629,859,708,4.0,4/16/2011,"Came here with the boyfriend and his friends for a double date night. Nikki and I tried the Pink Punk Cosmo, which is a very interesting cocktail that requires the bartender to pour the liquor concoction into a cosmo glass filled with cotton candy. Pretty darn awesome if you ask me! Then we had our typical 3 for $12.99 dinners (with green bean fries, various entrees, and cheesecake) while his friends had fried shrimp and mashed potatoes. Luckily for us, his friend had a 20% off coupon for the table so it was a great deal cheaper than what it would have been (those drinks really add up!) All in all, it was pretty good service and pretty good food, I'd stop by again if I was in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2?start=60
Linsey J.,"Levittown, PA",142,5,5,5.0,7/19/2015,"I have been coming to Friday's for many years and never leave hungry! I like the atmosphere and speediness of the food. Unfortunately the drinks that come from the bar tend to take some time.  Our server was great. She was very friendly, explained the awesome endless apps, and gave us fantastic recommendations for entrée & dessert options. I am pretty sure her name is Kristen.   I see a lot of not so good reviews here with my fellow yelpers and that just disappoints me. This place always meets the standards that are expected from TGI Friday's. This location is in a great spot and it is always clean and I like the way to is set up. All the servers or runners or managers also seem to help each other which is nice to see opposed to a whole restaurant having tension so thick you could cut it with a chain saw.    That's always awkward, annoying, and unprofessional. And those are things that I do not witness here at Friday's. Thanks Kristen for the great service, professionalism, and yummy recommendations. Chase also introduced himself and was very helpful while running our food out to us. Great team work guys!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2?start=60

Because of the traffic I was in a crappy mood, so I came in with an edge. Anyway, I sat at the bar and got waited on right away - service was great.  Then I ordered the burger with the Jack Daniel's sauce - woah that stuff is good.  The burger itself is nothing special, however, the Jack Daniel's sauce is what makes it.  After all - it's a chain restaurant burger.  Long story short - it was a solid experience and for the top service I gotta give it 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2?start=80

R G.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,16,11,4.0,7/11/2013,We ate here over the weekend after we saw the Jack Daniel commercials. It is the closest Friday's to us. The restaurant is tucked away a bit so I thought is would be empty. But this place was bustling with people! The Hostesses were so nice and clean cut girls (opposed to some other restaurants we have been to) we sat at the bar until our table was ready and the drinks were great. I was so glad we went because the Jack Daniels burger was FABULOUS! My only bad comment would have to be the wait! This place was packed!

S A.,"Abington, PA",0,12,,3.0,7/5/2013,"We come here sometimes, but prefer to do take-out.  The service is kind of hit-or-miss, some were really nice, some were really rude.  The TGI Friday policy on coupons is always annoying but we don't push the issue or anything.  We've had ants on our tables twice, and the menu is always sticky.  Some of the food is good and some is just okay.  And the place is usually really loud.  But it's a nice place to just go out to and get a drink and some food.  The jack daniels bbq burger is delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2?start=80

What i don't like with TGI Friday's is the dessert selection. It's lame. And that's why I always skip the desset - it's not worth the money. They need to come up with better healthy and delicious dessert. And you don't have to ask 'would you care for dessert?' or How 'bout dessert?'",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2?start=80
DJ M.,"Feasterville-Trevose, PA",453,794,3722,3.0,10/20/2008,"Years ago I would have given Friday's 4-5 stars.  Other than your family owned restaurants, they were a new game in town!  They started a lot of things..  chains, cool new appetizers, a huge center bar, an American  menu with variety.  A great place to pick up or get picked up ;+} They own the claim to much, like their Potato Skins even though since then, we have had better.  Their Jack Daniel's grill items were and still are a huge hit. I used to love their burgers, but there are too many better burger places now.  I love their Tostados Nacho's,  a layered creation of ground beef, refried beans, chips, salsa, jalapenos and cheese,  served with guacamole and sour cream. Yum. The first Friday's was opened in NYC by a perfume salesman, in 1965 and used a chalkboard for it's menu.  The revenues for the first year totaled 1 million dollars! It took him five years to open his second restaurant in Memphis, Tn. Today it is a worldwide chain and 600 of them are in the United States.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2?start=80
Ben P.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,5,,3.0,4/13/2011,I still think its better than applebees for sure. The waitress was great and kept coming back to see if we were ok. The food was made well for a chain restaurant. Had a drink that was called a raspberry long island Ice tea with real raspberries in it.

Josi Coyote V.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,13,,3.0,1/11/2011,I've been going to TGI Friday's for quite a few years.  I do like their salads alot.  It's a clean restaurant and you never have to wait to long for service.  I don't eat chicken fingers much anymore but they do have very good ones here with different sauces you can get for them.  I rate this on the level of applebee's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2?start=80
Stephanie N.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,8,,1.0,10/13/2012,"I went here with my dad and it was a bad experience. It took ten min just to seat us and the place wasn't packed. After seating us, two waitresses came over because one was new and didn't know what to do. They took our orders but took forever to understand exactly what we wanted, we didn't even want anything complicated. The one waitress just couldnt understand the other, wtf. My dad ordered pasta that originally comes with chicken, but he doesnt eat meat so he asked for extra pasta instead of the chicken. I ordered moterzalla sticks and chicken fingers. His pasta was small and looked no where near like they had put extra pasta in it. So bascically we paid for a full dish but only got half. The moterzalla sticks were nasty, and tasted cold. The chicken fingers tasted horrible, like they weren't cooked all the way. We had also gotten fries that were cold. The waitresses didn't come back at all to check up on us, we had to flag them down to get our check. It was expensive for no reason,the food and service sucked. Don't bother eating here, you won't finish your food because of how cold it is, and you'll waste your money for nothing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2?start=80
Remmie F.,"Villanova, PA",2,11,,2.0,4/30/2008,"I would like to preface this review by saying, I love the fridays franchise.  The Fridays by the Cherry hill mall is one of my favorite places to stop before a movie.   On to the review:  My brother and I had some work to get done and were on a tight deadline so we decided to go to Fridays to get a quick bite and a drink to get our minds back on track.  Although my favorite new restaurant is right down the road (Toscana 52) it was around dinner time and the place is really busy and, like I said, we were in a hurry. We arrived at Fridays and squeezed in a place at the bar.  The bar was SMOKEY.  I say that as a warning, BUT I don't hold it against them since smoking is still allowed in restaurants in that area and to take any stars off for that would be unfair.  The bar was crowded, but lacked any kind of a warm feeling.  Unlike other Friday's I've been to, the ambiance was dark and uninviting. They had a full bar and the bar is BIG.  With a full bar they had 2 bar tenders and a barback(I think that's what they're called. A gopher type person).  We sat at the bar for about 20 minutes BEFORE the bartender took our order. His service sounded something like this, ""Want something to drink?"" Now, I understand that you can get busy and if I was at a bar in philly I wouldn't think twice about it. But seriously. It's a bar/restaurant and must be held to a higher standard.  I ordered a Sangria and my brother ordered a long island iced tea.  The sangria was watered down and tasted like cool aid. My brother had no complaints with his LIT. For entree's, we got the Fajita and the fish taco (fish taco for him obviously. If you've read any of my reviews, you know I hate fish). My fajita was sub par and it took around 45 minutes to get there.  My brother looked particularly green and was unable to finish his fish taco.  I assumed this was the case because it was a fish taco. I mean, come on. Does that even sound appetizing? But my brother assured me he had it at other Friday's and liked it.  In short, I reccomend you stop by your local Fridays for a quick bite, or a nice drink.  Just  so long as you don't live near this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bensalem-2?start=80
