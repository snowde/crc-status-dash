Rhonda C.,"Easton, PA",7,50,2,1.0,3/1/2014,"This place has no process. I've had iffy service when we ate in at this TGI's but on many occasions we have tried to place an order over the phone. Forget it, you get placed on hold and forgotten about. You would think it is the worlds busiest restaurant. I've given too many chances both eating in and taking out and I will not be back. Poor service over and over again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=40
T P.,"Belvidere, NJ",3,112,,3.0,2/12/2015,"i had my first tgi fridays experience a few nights ago. i ordered the full rack of ribs that came with fries and slaw. the ribs were tender enough, but they served the bbq sauce on the side. the ribs themselves had no ""smokey"" flavor. you'd think they would cook them with at least some sauce to give them a little flavor, but if they do, you sure can't tell. the fries had WAY too much seasoning on them for my liking. the slaw was a step or two (flavor wise) below what you'd get from your local deli and was served in a vat that could hold about 4 times the amount they give you, but being it didn't have hardly any flavor, i wasn't dissapointed. overall, i think i'll be back to try other menu items, but i'll skip the ribs next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=40
Lauren W.,"Easton, PA",17,115,5,3.0,9/6/2013,"When I started coming here about a year ago, I really liked the customer service. Doors are opened for you as you come inside. Sitting at the bar tables, the server clears away the menus, condiments, etc. with an able single swipe.  The food is quite good, and value priced. Especially if you are a points member and use the coupons in the newspaper. Happy hour specials are awesome, save $1 or more on beers, drinks, etc. It was heaven. Apps were half-priced. One time they gave out free wings. Why can't this happen every week on a designated night? My main problem, then, is that I love the mixed drinks. There's more ice than drink in my $8 mixer. And when you're mixing the liquor with multiple juices, there's no good reason to fill the cup with ice. I drink these in two sips. I have tried asking the servers for light ice, and I feel like a picky elderly person, and I'm really not either of those things.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=40
Jannice R.,"Easton, PA",0,4,,1.0,12/12/2014,"Terrible experience on all accounts.  Office Lunch- Party of 7 - Food problems: super dry ribs, soggy and cold pecan crusted chicken on a salad drenched with dressing, tough steak, dry mac & cheese, cold wings and unacceptable 100% frozen, cut from the freezer, cheesecake.  Service: Disaster - we had to get up 3 times to find our server and it was not even busy.  It is unbelievable to me that they cannot manage to serve even moderately well prepared, warm food and a basic, decent service.  On top of it all the bill was high and the next morning everyone came to work saying they felt  queasy that night because it was just plain old gross.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=40
Ben R.,"Los Angeles, CA",120,203,62,3.0,9/30/2011,"Built recently, this Friday's is slightly above average. High ceilings, large well positioned TVs at the bar, overall very clean.  We came here to catch football a few Sundays ago, the bar was uncrowded and food was quick and typical.  I tried both traditional and boneless wings, and traditional was a CLEAR winner.

Eric C.,"Bethlehem, PA",70,2,1,1.0,10/13/2012,"I went to the store in Bethlehem, PA for lunch, our server was absent most of the time but would make a very brief check on our table from time, staying long enough for us to hear what she said, then starting to walk away before we answered, on top of that we sat around for the first 5-10 minutes waiting to place our order, so when our server did come over she had little to no knowledge of the menu items, nor specials for the day, she did not even know the soup of the day! I placed my order and got the cherry limeade to drink, please note NONE of the non- alcoholic drinks had any kind of price next to them, then our cups of ice were brought to us, I say cups of ice because it was a cup full of ice with some liquid in it, I did not make a big deal of this, because I saw on the menu they give free refills, after finishing my first drink our server came around and asked if I'd like a refill I said ""Yes, Thanks"" when I should have asked ""Are you going to charge me for it?"" Because apparently only the limeades are an exception to their refill policy. That was all before we received any food, when our food did come out the soups were cold, my fries were luke warm, I didn't even bother to try my sandwich, because I was already disappointed enough. Other people in our group got a soup and salad which is supposed to come with breadstick""S"" we received one and after asking for more bread sticks our server brought out only one more. This is the 4th time I have gone to this store and I have never had a good experience there. The first time I had a bad meal and complained about it, the manager offered us a coupon for a free lunch, really it was a coupon for free, lukewarm, below mediocre food. I would never go to this particular store again and I am now skeptical to ever go to any TGI Friday's again. I would never suggest this store to any of my friends or family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=40
Candi K.,"Allentown, PA",290,709,53,2.0,5/1/2008,"This Friday's location is always packed.  I've never waited less than an hour on a weekend evening.

Parmjeet M.,"Hellertown, PA",6,19,2,5.0,9/21/2017,My wife and I stopped in to check out the menu as we are vegetarian we weren't sure if we could have anything or not. We took a look at the allergen menu and noticed almost all the food we wanted had egg in it. Just then we were about to leave but the manager John came over and sat with us and went over items that he could make for us. This manager was amazing he made us stuff that had no egg and made sure everything he brought out to us was delivered by himself. He went above and beyond for us and I really appreciate his kindness and understanding of our diet needs. John keep it up!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem
Gene G.,"Hempstead, NY",1,11,3,1.0,7/24/2017,"I only gave them one star because the drinks were decent. With that being said I can began to tell you about my terrible experience here. My family, girlfriend and I came to Pennsylvania because it was my birthday weekend and we were spending it together at dorney park. Saturday July 22nd the day before my birthday we decided to eat here after a fun day at the park. It started off bad because the restaurant was empty but for some reason we waited 45minutes for a table maybe because we were a party of 12 but anyway, We were seated and greeted by our server ""Amanda"". We ordered our food than began the longest wait for food ever !. Skipping forever and a day ahead our food finally comes and this is where the problems began. First off our appetizers and entrees came out together, they were giving wrong people the wrong meals and a few of the meals had some ""issues"" ill say. Me: ordered chicken fingers with a side of mashed and my chicken fingers were raw and had to be taken back to be re-cooked. My mom: ordered salmon and her side of spinach was still frozen. She didn't want to complain so she just decided not to eat it. My cousin: ordered a chicken sandwhich that came out over cooked. Our server was terrible disappeared for extended times often, we had to tell other servers to find her. I'll end my review with this, this was my worst experience at any restaurant EVER. I will never come back to this location ever!!! We constantly complained and no manager came to resolve our issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem

Sami L.,"Easton, PA",7,22,62,3.0,2/28/2017,"First time there last week. Was seated right away. Great waiter, he came by often. Made sure we ha plenty at the table. Lol. The manager came around  and checked on us. We got the $10 appetizers. They were fantastic. You have plenty of choices. So definitely worth it. I'd go back there again. Update. 4stars to 3.  Now went there a second time yesterday at 5. Got seated fairly quickly. Waitress was prompt at first. We ordered endless app again. The food looked tossed quickly together. Seems like the busier the less effort they put into it. Plus waited a long time in between.  If you decide to go. Do it closer to when they open. That way they put better effort into making the food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem
John S.,"Sciota, PA",0,18,,1.0,11/12/2017,This place reminded me why I don't go to franchises. Frozen food. Bad service. And very dirty. They don't care because they have a million people come in through.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem
Lorena S.,"Rochelle Park, NJ",55,74,116,5.0,12/17/2016,"So let me start off by saying, I had a wonderful experience at this TGIFs.  We were seated promptly and our server was very energetic and seemed to actually enjoy her job, which is rare especially in some franchises.   We ordered the flatbread pizza, Jack Daniels shrimp and chicken (which Is my favorite) and the kids pasta with a side of fruit.  The order took average time and was accurate when it got to our table.   Everything tasted delicious.  Not sure about all the other negative reviews, but I give it 5 stars in every TGIF category.   Oh and even the bathrooms were spotless!!!

Carl D.,"Wind Gap, PA",0,111,1,3.0,6/18/2017,"Not been to fridays in awhile. Menu changed since last visit with good choices and gluten free options too. I'd say 4 star food, 5 star waiter, but 1 star kitchen/management. We ordered potato skins (very good) which took awhile to get but when they showed up seemed like a small portion. 3 minutes later a much larger (full) portion arrived. Waiter apologized for initial 1/2 order which we ended up getting for free.  I ordered buffalo wing burger which was sloppily delicious!  Didn't come with a few wings as I expected and shown in the picture so I asked our friendly waiter who again apologized and went to the kitchen to fetch my wings. He returned explaining ""sometimes you have to fight for what you need"".  Waiter (Cory) was great. Food was pretty good. We'll go back.

Zachary P.,"Bethlehem, PA",6,15,1,5.0,8/2/2017,"Great dining experience at this TGI Fridays! Definitely much better than the other TGI Fridays location in Allentown by Dorney Park, which we tried just a month ago and had a terrible experience service wise even when the place wasn't crowded! Anyway, this location has speedy service and friendly servers. The food is excellent and the menu is large with many different options. Parking is great and surrounds the restaurant. The restaurant is also located in a prime spot, right off of Route 33 and just a few minutes away from Route 22. Endless Apps are also available here! If you're looking at reviews for TGI Fridays in the area and happen to be closer to the Allentown location by Dorney Park, take a few extra minutes to drive over to this location instead!

I'm not one to reorder, or send food back so I just let the waitress know. She day she would  tell the cook & manager. Ordered the rice pilaf and spinach as my sides. Rice too was dry and I told the waitress spinach and she bought me some melted  butter to put over everything.  Really not good. The strawberry ice tea was too watered down so I ordered less ice for second round. Worst meal at a TGIF at a In a while. Won't be returning to this one..

Bill W.,"Easton, PA",0,71,159,3.0,9/2/2016,"When I was a senior in high school, ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away,"" TGIF was a favorite hangout for senior high schoolers. A few years ago, I stopped in with my parents. We could barely stand how loud it was. Seriously, the inside of a jet engine at full thrust is quieter than TGIF. Maybe that's what today's high schoolers want. Now, it seems to have, or is trying to, become a sports bar. Also not my thing. But ... Since I'm older than eight years old and I don't have a bedtime, I sometimes need a place to go after 10:00 P.M. TGIF is about the only place in the Lehigh Valley where you can get food after 10:00 P.M. (The TGIF kitchen is open until 12:30 A.M. The bar is open until 2:00 A.M.) That late (i.e., after 10:00 P.M.), no surprise here in the LV A.K.A. Tinytown, even TGIF is nearly empty. They turn the noise down to just below deafening. I like the food here. It's not great, but typical chain restaurant, i.e., on par with Olive Garden, Red Robin, etc. Given the customer-to-server ratio late at night, the service is a little slow, but not terrible. The servers are very nice. Special Note to Single Men: You are NOT going to impress a woman (in a positive way) by bringing her here on a date, sitting at the bar, and using a discount coupon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem

Paige E.,"Emmaus, PA",206,3,4,1.0,3/12/2017,"Myself, two friends and our 4 kids came here for dinner after we were at FreeFall. Our server name was Kelly she seemed very attentive when greeting us but not so much after we got our drinks. We asked for mozzarella sticks and boneless wings &  for our 3 kids meals as the appetizer came out. Then another server brings out the boneless wings & there's no garlic parm or buffalo, all the sauce was on size & that's not what I ordered & he didn't bring out our motz sticks. Then Kelly comes asking if we'd like to order any more appetizers & I told her we never received our motz stick. Shortly after we get the motz sticks (all four of them) our entrees come out & our drinks are empty & our kids still haven't received their meals I did tell Kelly & she then finally brought them out. The chicken tenders were very salty & our little girl did not want to eat anything after that. I also did not enjoy the parm crusted chicken so we just sent our food back & ate only the appetizer. The manager did help & discount the price. I love T.G.I. Friday's I just will never go to this one again or recommend it to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem

Lindsay L.,"Boynton Beach, FL",245,9,12,2.0,4/22/2017,"Our experiences were just ""ok"". First time we went the server was friendly and manager checked on us. He gave us a free app/dessert card and checked on us through the entire night. The food was what was expected but a little pricey for corporate American cuisine. When we went back a second time, our server started off friendly but then when he saw we had a coupon he seemed to not care anymore probably thinking we were just there for a freebie. The parts that really bothered me are 1. I had two drinks. The first one was good, no issues but the second one was clearly way stronger. Being in hospitality for 13 years, consistency is huge for me. 2. The tomatoes that came with my mozzarella and tomato salad were frozen together.. literally. There was ice on them and completely grossed me out. For the price, there are way better quality restaurants in the area. I don't think we will be returning. Tomato popsicles aren't my thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem
Patrick L.,"Nazareth, PA",0,51,4,2.0,12/26/2016,"Stopped in here after taking kids shopping with gift cards. The experience started friendly and well but declined quickly.  Our waiter was friendly and accepted our jovial quips. However, after placing our drink order which was forgotten our experience declined to the unacceptable. With 6 at a table with kids it is a pretty easy order but 20 minutes to get a cherry coke is not going unnoticed. Then another bar drink forgot twice after being reminded. The food was order and came out at different times. The brought food to the table which wasn't ours and left a plate we didn't order at the table.  The food was acceptable but a little on the luke warm instead of hot. Our table was bussed only once with plates piling up. Over staff complain they had no glasses as they walked by our table which had 12 sitting on it.  Once our meal was finished the server returned and asked if we needed anything and started clearing the table which we asked for the check.  He returned the check and we placed out card inside. This is were a server should act promptly but it took 20 minutes which we finally asked the manager for help. He politely but unacceptable said give me a second and returned 5 minutes later. Which I was always told customers come first and should be answered quickly.

The sale was so small - what happened to the big wonderful salads?  Just so let down by what this chain has become.

Riza Jane B.,"Union, NJ",0,2,1,1.0,6/9/2016,"If there was a no star button I'll press it in a heartbeat. Before heading to this establishment two days ago, we were coming from a high school graduation and were extremely hungry. Upon entering the establishment and being greeted by the host, we told him we were a party of 15 and he unprofessionally rolled his eyes and let out a hugh sigh. Looking around the restaurant, it seemed there were a handful of customers and was not busy at all.  We were taken to our seats near the entrance and greeted by our waitress promptly and accordingly. It went completely downhill after that. After taking our orders (appetizers, entrees, soup, and salads) and receiving our drinks. The first plate that was brought out took 20 minutes after ordering, which was a french onion soup. The bowl was completely messy and appeared as if someone just threw it on the bowl without care. Another 20 minutes had passed and finally received our first appetizer and it was cold. The potstickers was dry and overcooked and the loaded potato skins had a miniscule amount of cheese and was dehydrated.  After waiting another 5-10 minutes, I finally went up to the host booth. The host seemed uninterested and was fiddling with his phone while on duty and told me he would check on it. The waitress finally came back knowing that we were complaining and angry. She kept apologizing and finally told us the food was running late after spending more than an hour waiting for the food. Mind you there were people that came after us and they already received their food and starting to leave. It wasn't crazy busy, but it was the right amount of customers to make you work a bit.  The manager finally appeared and looked disheveled. He didn't seem to care about the situation and said he will go check on the food. Once the food finally arrived, it was sloppily placed on the plates. Sizzling plates were no longer sizzling. The food was hard, burnt, and dry. And still we were missing one entree. The manager was extremely unprofessional. He was trying to seem apologetic, but felt no sincerity behind it. The manager stated that the plates were piling up and had no more counter space and that since we were a big party (basically putting the blame on us for coming there as a big group and making them suffer) it was difficult on the chef. But, looking at our orders it mostly consists of salads and appetizers. I've never been talked to in that manner by a manager and I was already livid. He kept asking me ""What more can I do for you?"" I responded back to him saying ""What more can you do?"" I am a paying customer, you don't ask a customer what to do. As a manager you troubleshoot and find solutions. His only solution was comping three of our plates and be on his way.  He also stated that the store hours were wrong on the website and that they were ""technically"" closed earlier then the 2 am time stated on the website. On top of that he wrote down the phone number to his general manager Chris Eppers. After handing me a piece of paper he turned around and never came back. But the number that was given to me was non-existent after trying to call multiple times the following day to file my complaint.  The manager I spoke to last night didn't even give me his name so I had to ask the waitress. Mr. Jake Swazdale (?) the way you handled yourself last night was a disgrace and it reflects to why the TGIF franchise is going downhill. This is a message to all the paying customers, be wary of this establishment and save your money and go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=20
Jess M.,"Easton, PA",0,4,,4.0,2/29/2016,"I've been to this TGIF many times ever since I moved to PA. I love their food and endless apps. Great price if you have a huge appetite. Bathroom is always clean and servers are quick and attentive. I love their stripes program. I've been disappointed once and annoyed once.  Disappointed because I had a coupon for ""buy one entree get one free"", both my fiancè and I ordered a steak entree with half a rib and I informed my server that I had a coupon for buy one get one. Once the bill came I told my server that the coupon didn't go through, that's when the manager came up to our table and said, ""the coupon doesn't work on steaks or ribs"" .... What?  It didn't say anywhere in the coupon that it did not accept steak or ribs! I don't have to write down how much the bill was because you can imagine how much steak costs there. But you live and you learn, next time I'll ask twice before ordering. Now I've been annoyed once because we've had this female serve, I always forget her name but whenever I go there with my partner and baby she only pays attention to my fiancè and gets a little TOO friendly. Like.. TOOOOO friendly to a point where my fiancè gets uncomfortable and I'm just there like, ""Yo, I'm right here.""  Now I'm not going to go all out and throw these hands but just respect a little.

Chelsea L.,"Bethlehem, PA",0,17,,1.0,6/8/2016,"This a popular destination after graduation because it's the only restaurant opened, but do not go here. My family has received the worst customer service at this location. My family arrived around 10pm but we weren't served our appetizer until 11:20pm. We were then served our courses 5 mins afterwards, but the food was over cooked, cold, and sloppily made.  My father's sizzling platter was no longer sizzling, but it was colder than Elsa releasing her blizzard. One of our orders wasn't even out as well, by the time it came out the bread was cold and hard. My aunt's pretzels were as black as coal. After complaining to the manager he just apologized and said they were ""swamped"" with all the other customers, and that the counters in the back were getting full with all the platters. Platters of our food just chilling there under the lamp. We were the first party to arrive and there were no customers before us, but all the other parties that came after us already got their food and they were leaving when we haven't got our appetizers yet. The waitress didn't even come to refill our waters. By the time we got our food none of my family was able to eat the food because the food wasn't edible. Yelp, Google, and the store hours say that the restaurant is open until 2am but the manager told us that it was untrue and that they actually close at midnight so the kitchen was closed at 11pm.  We asked for the number of the person above the manager and the manager who personally gave us the paper also gave us a wrong number.

Our server's name was Kevin. He always checked up on us and was a great server. Our food was good too, like always. The manager Teddy was walking around going from table to table asking everyone if everything was okay and if their server was taking care of them well. He asks us if everything was okay he's like my name is teddy i'm the manager. I said we actually met before. He said i do look familiar, but the family as a group he couldn't recognize. So then we're like our server wouldn't sing happy birthday to her, talking about my niece. He's like ooohhhh wow i remember now. He said that was not a good memory it never sat well with me and i felt so bad, he's like here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna take her meal off your bill her meal is on me. So then he walks away to the computer, he's looking back and forth thinking so he walks back to our table and says i did a little more then what i said i was gonna do. I was so shocked at what he did. I'm thinking he paid our whole bill, but still what he did was amazing and i pray that God blesses him for what he did for us. He said i took off 50% from your bill. He talked about how that night effected him, how it didn't sit right with him. He really felt bad about what happened to us, the horrible service we had from our last server. When he said that to us we were so thankful to him like wow what a gracious act that was. He apologized about what happened to us last time we were there. Teddy you really made our night, that was so amazing what you did for us. My whole family is grateful. Thank you Kevin our server& thank you Teddy the manager. We look forward to seeing you there again! Five stars*****",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=20
Warren R.,"Wind Gap, PA",918,254,1114,2.0,2/27/2016,"I gotta say this place was pretty cool. I loved the design and the decorations and the bar here. The ambiance of this place was very warm. I loved it! But please tell me why I had to wait dam near 10 minutes for a drink at the bar when there was only a few patrons sitting around at the bar. There was nobody sitting at the tables either. I finally got my drink and left. There was no reason I had to wait that long for two drinks. The lady behind the bar, I can't even call her a bar tender, was too busy talking to a co-worker and not serving us. Il probably never go back to that location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=20
Mackenzie M.,"Whitehall, PA",5,3,,2.0,6/10/2016,"I used to love this place. My husband and I hadn't been here in about a year and assumed it would be the same as ever, but we were completely wrong. Their prices have gone up and the portions seem smaller than they used to be. But more importantly, the quality of the food was somewhere between poor and mediocre. For example, I had been very excited to get some mashed potatoes, which I remembered as being creamy and delicious when we last ate here. Unfortunately this time what I ended up with was two small dry lumps of mashed potatoes that I couldn't even finish. My husband and I were so disappointed...this used to be our favorite chain restaurant. I don't think we'll be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=20
Rafael C.,"Whitehall, PA",0,3,,1.0,2/21/2016,"Let's start by saying that me and the wife waited for at least 5 minutes or more for them to clean a table, not sure why we couldn't sit at a table that was clean already. Once we sat down the table was never wipe down the food was not hot , they brought me a plate with a piece of letters that I couldn't  get out by scraping it and our waitress seem a little lost, before the end of the night the wife order a martini and I order a beer and got the beer and the check.  the waitress she kept on coming over and asking us if we were ready. Never got the martini and once she brought it over and the wife took a sip there were three large lipstick stains on the glass. Don't really care much for a discount but they didn't even offer a 5% discount on our meal out of courtesy for the nasty ass glass and the mediocre service. Needless to say I will never visit that place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=20
Ronnie B.,"Easton, PA",14,24,27,1.0,12/6/2015,"Just got back from tgi Fridays.  Let say.  I love how they up sell the endless apps (not).  U would think when u get a few of their apps that are on the list they would up sell you then.  But no.   Their food is nasty at this location.  Maybe it was a Sunday seems no care by the person pushing the button on the microwave.   Next time someone make the suggestion to go there, I'll pass.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=20
Brad D.,"Northampton, PA",0,57,,3.0,12/14/2015,"Staff friendly and courteous.  Food was average, nothing spectacular but not bad either.

Gabby G.,"Easton, PA",0,14,6,1.0,5/28/2015,"One of the worst places I have ever been, our waitress not only took forever to do any type of refills they also charged my card TWICE!! I called to get the issue fixed several times and always got ""I will call you back"" from the manager. Several times.  I have told so many people about this issue that they do not want to go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=20

Christopher C.,"Conshohocken, PA",168,1318,6419,1.0,8/2/2011,There is no better ingredient in cooking than plastic.  The kitchen staff at this Friday's knows this as they included part of the plastic bag that they microwave their rice in on top of my wife's pasta dish the last time we were there.   And even though it was in plain site no one in the kitchen or our server bothered to check the food and the entree with yummy plastic bag piece was served.  While that could be chalked up as an accident the fact that our server was only quasi-apologetic about it and chose to make jokes about it happening as opposed to apologizing or fixing/comping that part of the food order makes me doubt that we'll be back any time soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=20
Lisa L.,"Baltimore, MD",5,7,1,3.0,10/18/2014,Not impressed at all! Came in told it would be a 25 minute wait! That would have been fine but when there are more than a half a dozen tables! They blamed the kitchen staff for being behind and Instead of seating people in the empty tables and having people spend money on bar drinks they rather have them sit in the waiting area and get mad! But because of our server Alison she made our night! And the kitchen had our food out in no time at all! Food was great! So I truly blame bad management for this visit!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=20

E P.,"Phillipsburg, NJ",0,5,,1.0,8/21/2015,"Went there recently for the first time in a while. Horrible experience. Our server was not excited to serve us. He had a terrible attitude and wanted to go home, which he made obvious. My drink which was a sprite, the cup had a random lemon seed in it, which is disgusting since I had no lemon in my drink. And my food was okay, but the spinach had random pieces of mushrooms and onions in it , which clearly wasn't supposed to be in there. Gross. Our server kept asking us if we were finished with our food when we only ate a little bit of it, he made us feel like we should rush out. Overall it was not a good experience. I would not go again. Horrible service , and dirty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=20
Scott S.,"Wildwood, NJ",2,271,135,1.0,4/16/2014,As some have said this place is a hit or miss. Tonight was a miss and regretful we went and not to other ideas.  Starting with the host totally confused.   Table service was prompt and considerate.  Order appetizer and a meal. And all delivered at the same time. When waiter is serving and apologizing at the same time was good indication of problems with kitchen.  Her salad was nothing to write about. My burger was a burger.  And when leaving host was more concerned about baseball game then his customers. Next time will go with other ideas and not hit or miss,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=20
Steve S.,"Beverly Hills, FL",12,141,9,1.0,12/20/2012,We've been to this TGI Fridays for lunch at least 6 times.  It is a real hit or miss as to whether you'll get decent service or not.   We won't be going back after our most recent visit.  When 2 business people go in for lunch and it takes 15 minutes to get your order taken and then another 1/2 hour to get your food it really blows your lunch hour.  I ordered a chicken club sandwich and my friend ordered spinach ravioli with chicken (don't remember the exact name of the dish).  I think there was 5 or 6 of the little raviolis (it was not a lunch portion).   Poor value for the money plus lousy service.  Not a good combination.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=20
Kyle D.,"York, PA",0,28,,1.0,5/9/2015,"Very inconsistent food quality. Used to love going here, but have experienced issues during the last few visits, including hair in food (two separate occasions), cold fries, brown lettuce on sandwiches...overall just not what you expect to pay for. In addition, staff does little to take care of these issues. Too many better places to go in town now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bethlehem?start=20
