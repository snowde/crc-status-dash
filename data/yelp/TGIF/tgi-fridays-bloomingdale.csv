Jessica B.,"Lombard, IL",67,42,80,3.0,1/3/2018,"Good points: -service was pretty good tonight -Food was good (minus the sprouts) Some bad points: -bar area smelled bad like old mixers -bar top was pretty dirty -new brussel sprouts side was gross. I wouldn't order again -I ordered a draft Miller Lite but they were out After several very bad service experiences over our last few visits I had sworn I would not be coming back. It's always at the bar and always the same girl whose been there forever. She's really impressively bad at her job. Anyway, it was Christmas Day and it was the only place open so we had no choice unless we were going to go grocery shopping and cook last minute (not going to happen) so we decided to try one more time. It was super busy but we found a spot at the bar. We had 2 male bartenders and they were great even though they had to run there ass off to keep up.

Mike P.,"Glen Ellyn, IL",0,24,,1.0,11/30/2017,Let's just say their total disregard for customer service has cost them a customer. And as many of my friends that I can relate my experience to. And how about a decor update. At least fix the hole in the wall. Just an FYI it was the managers disrespect that precipitated this.

Brittnie M.,"Bartlett, IL",107,56,38,1.0,10/13/2017,"Where do I begin with the flaming f**king train wreck that is Bloomingdale's TGI Fridays? You know what.. Let's just bullet point the highlights of our dining experience tonight.. -dirty tables and floor -friend received wrong salad, never got the replacement -other friend received wrong order, they replaced it with another incorrect order.. Third try was also incorrect.. She never got her correct meal -the server SPILLED SALAD DRESSING ON MY FREND -2 friends ordered beer.. showed up AFTER the food -found bones in my salmon -vegan friend asked for no chicken in her pasta, there was chicken in her pasta  -after our meal the INITIAL replacement salad finally arrived and had a LONG BLACK HAIR in it  -ABSOLUTELY NOTHING on our bill was comped or discounted. We didn't even get an apology. I'm PISSED we had to pay for 100% for everything.  Our server avoided us for the rest of the night. I can sit here and bitch and plead for Friday's to get their act together, but let's face it.. They don't care. I'm waiting for everyone to get sick from food poisoning.

The waitresses have been awful a few times so today we got delivery through Grub Hub. Two of our sides were missing and our 'medium' steak was raw.

Definitely won't ever be back there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale
Christy M.,"Elgin, IL",18,2,,1.0,1/13/2018,"Don't waste your money. Food awful, service awful. Ordered from grub hub for first time and apparently they can't even read off an order ticket because the order ticket was correct we received, however none of the food was. When we called we were told the only way to fix was to come pick up new food (if I wanted to leave my house I wouldn't have ordered grub hub genius). We only received half our food and the sides werent right and they forgot the appetizers all together. I was only given the option of in store credit, as if I would eat at a place that can't read an order ticket. That screams food poisoning.

Jessie W.,"Schaumburg, IL",117,1,1,1.0,8/16/2017,"Worst service I've ever had in a restaurant. Scott Griffith was the worst manager, not only did he not try to correct the mistakes made by his training server, he also did not offer help on the floor for our party of 10. When confronted about our service, he told my friend to let him manage his own store. ""If we had a problem there was manager job available if we could do better."" Our whole party was in complete shock with how he interacted with our group. Even the tables next to us who were listening to the conversation were amazed that he said what he did. Will never return. Update: After all that had happened we payed our bills and were singing happy birthday to my friend, getting ready to leave. While we were singing the manager approached us again and proceeded to kick us out of the restaurant. We were so furious but left on his terms, as we were walking a different server jumped in and got in my face. When we got outside that same server followed us outside and proceeded to throw an entire cup of water into my face. I am appalled by this situation, never in my life have I seen such service.

Sue K.,"Chicago, IL",5,88,71,1.0,3/11/2017,"Update- TGIF changed burgers- they put a thousand island sauce on them!  My friend ordered a PLAIN burger nothing on it well done, I a hamburger medium- after 25 min mine had sauce and cheese on it and well done, my friend had sauce on it.  Also you can no longer substitute broccoli instead of fries at no charge.  The manager brought the one burger we sent back and saw me scraping off cheese on mine. There was no apologies or offer to comp any part of our lunch.   We come here often for drinks and appetizers.  Loved the all you can eat deal they had.  This new deal of $5.00 is not so great.  They are not full appetizers  .  Which I'm not sure why we thought they would be anyway.

Julia J.,"Columbus, OH",159,94,50,3.0,7/14/2017,"Came here for lunch and we were seated right away. My boyfriend and I shared a ribeye with a side of ribs. We also got a half portion of the cajun pasta. Everything was cooked well and seasoned nicely. Even though the pasta was a half portion, it had a generous amount of chicken and shrimp.  Our server was friendly and checked up on us frequently. Our waters and sodas were empty a couple times, but he did eventually notice it.  Overall, it was a nice casual place to dine. BUT, they didnt seem like they have a separate lunch menu, so lunch and dinner prices are the same.

Richard F.,"Glen Ellyn, IL",0,35,,1.0,11/11/2017,"As a veteran on Veteran's Day, I drove all the way up to TGIF restaurant in Bloomingdale based on their invitation for a complimentary veteran's meal. I arrived 5 minutes after 2pm and was informed I'm ineligible as the offer ended exactly at 2pm. The front desk lady said this was based on the manager's orders. What kind of recognition is that? They couldn't be flexible by a few minutes? I went next door to Chili's, where not only were they much more welcoming, but their complimentary meal is offered all day and evening. I was even invited to come back again for a free dinner.  I'm avoiding TGIF in the future for this unnecessary stinginess, and will now happily become a regular Chili's customer. TGIF seems to only honor veterans because they have to for public relations sake, not out of any real desire.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale

Aldo D.,"Schaumburg, IL",23,93,18,1.0,8/3/2017,"Probably the worst service I've ever received in years. The ""server"" (note the quotes) was arrogant and had a nasty attitude when I made a simple request for an extra side of sauce.

Chelsea S.,"Chicago, IL",12,40,6,2.0,11/17/2017,"Stopped in Friday's on a Friday to see if they had any namesake day of the week specials. They do not, and they only have a few options available for lunch portions which is a bummer when you're looking for adequate meal portions. There was only about a dozen people here around 1pm for lunch and unfortunately it was not great service. I only have an hour to kill for lunch and the majority of my time was spent waiting. Waiting to place the order, waiting for the food (took the longest especially when you're hungry) and then waiting for the check. The worst part was our waiter rang up our $7 meals for $9 dollars and then it seemed like he disappeared as we waited around to reconcile. We did not receive an itemized receipt when he rang us up so we had to ask for one of those first to figure out why our bill was so high. Thankfully upper management was very kind enough to let us pay the correct amount and the manger personally came over to apologize. Kudos to him!! I wish our waiter would have paid attention to us though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale

Keith E H.,"Elmhurst, IL",0,8,1,1.0,10/13/2017,"I figured I had been bad luck on previous visits. But I guess not. Service at this location has always been slow but it seems to have gotten slower some how. And there's no excuse when the restaurant is not busy. I guess this is one of those chains that has given up. One suggestion in the mean time, don't put people with no people skills in charge or in the position of hostess. If I was just grading them the place would get no stars. Sad to see. Most aren't as bad as this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale

We came here for dinner and drinks with friends a few weeks ago and the place was jumpin' on a Friday night. I had a fun Long Island that had tapioca balls in it, and the $10 endless apps deal which enabled me to enjoy the all American trio of wings, potato skins, and mozzarella sticks.

Natalie Z.,"Mount Prospect, IL",8,36,189,4.0,5/23/2017,"I love TGIF and I go to many locations. My usual ""go-to"" spot is the one in Rosemont but my friends and I decided to check this one out tonight. We came at around 9:30pm on a Tuesday. I ordered a smoothie and the southwestern BBQ salad (I think it's newer) and OMG I was pleasantly surprised. The smoothies are a little too sweet but still very refreshing and delicious. I've had bad experiences with salads (some I wouldn't even eat) from TGIF so I was hesitant but this one was amazing. I would highly recommend the southwestern BBQ salad for anyone who likes BBQ chicken and avocados. I tried the Mac and cheese and it was also very good. The service here took a little more time than anticipated but the server was extremely nice so we didn't really mind (she kept coming back making sure we had everything we needed- drinks, any sides, additional food, etc). Our (adult) drinks haha were also very good! This TGIF has a really large center bar which is really nice. It is clean and has a really fun, yet not too overwhelming, ambiance.

It's pretty much on the same level as a Chili's or Applebee's, but I find the quality of food is slightly better, the servers work harder, plus they have daily deals and the Stripes Rewards. If I'm looking for something above a fast food place but not a fancy sit-down either, this is where you'll find me. I like their steaks and I usually order a Mojito or a Mango Mai Tai.

Lukas S.,"Bartlett, IL",12,207,7,3.0,6/23/2015,"Went here for lunch one day as we had not been to Friday's in a long time! Our waiter was nice but I felt like he immediately was acting like a salesman rather than a waiter. I could tell he was on a mission to ""sell"" as much of the menu to us as he could. I realize there is probably pressure on him to do so, but it was kind of an immediate ""turn off."" We ordered the appetizer sampler which was good. I ordered the smothered chicken and spinach and my boyfriend got a jack daniel's chicken sandwich. My chicken was good but nothing too flavorful or exciting. My boyfriend liked his sandwich but you practically needed a microscope to see the chicken, it was so small! Again, our waiter came by to give us a sales pitch about dessert. Overall the experience was okay but I'd probably go to another chain next time versus Friday's.

Charlotte S.,"Addison, IL",156,140,180,3.0,1/16/2015,"Fridays is Fridays, so you can usually bank on it being consistent in delivery (for food, anyways). I've been coming here since I was a wee lass and am usually content with this location.     Service is usually average with the occasional meh server or great server (Daz. [I think that's the name] is usually really good).     Food is average, though I very much enjoy the chicken fingers and honey mustard. The seasoning on their fries used to be more which I liked but still, those are decent too. The sizzling chicken and shrimp is another good one, and the French onion is usually my go-to soup if I'm feeling soup.      Recent problem I've noticed: I don't know what is up with that girls bathroom (can't speak for the lads), but it's got quite the stank going. It kind of smells like a sewer issue, and was at first confined to the bathroom but I was actually starting to notice it by the tables nearby; however, last time I was in it smelled as if they were somehow trying to deal with it.     It's of course got the whole bar portion, mixed drinks can sometimes use some help but whatever. They've got all kinds of specials on drinks as well as food (including food/appetizer combos at a good price).     Hours are 11am-2am, so that is nice if you're looking for something later on. They've got their ""Stripes"" card which has some decent perks if you sign up.

Renita M.,"Lombard, IL",437,804,41,4.0,4/6/2011,"I don't know if I'm a fan, per se, but we had a good enough experience that I would feel guilty only giving three stars. We only came here because my brother, sweet guy that he is, sent me a TGI Friday's gift card for my birthday. It's the sort of place he likes to eat, and little ole Goshen, IN doesn't have a lot of choices, so in this case it really is the thought that counts. We were seated promptly but in our brief seconds standing in the entrance, there did seem to be a waiting area -- albeit not a big one -- so maybe they remodeled it slightly? In any case, I didn't make anyone uncomfortable by standing next to a diner's chair. They just introduced 20 new menu items and we were given a spiel about this promotion -- order one and get a card for $10 off your next visit. Well, in looking over the entrees, there were some appealing ones, so we both went that route. Also, their ""stripes"" frequent diner program offers, it turns out, free chips and salsa on every visit. Random, but hey, why not? We went for nachos, I got Mediterranean chicken skewers, and the husband got a burger. The nachos are served ""tostada style"" which is kind of funny, since this is how nachos were originally made: cheese and jalapeno on each chip. These also have beans on them, and are served with a pile of lettuce, salsa and guacamole. Pretty tasty, you can't screw these up too badly. My Mediterranean chicken skewers were a  nice find: two skewers of garlicky-lemony chicken chunks with onions, served over rice, with veggies (squash/zucchini), tzatziki sauce and pita.  The chicken was tender and flavorful, the rice was tasty and the pita was warm and soft. The tzatziki was not quite perfect, but it still tasted good.  I swear, the wait staff in this place must take happy pills or something, because everyone was exceptionally cheerful. Which is nice, if a little disconcerting. I know, they're paid to cheerlead their food, so good for them. Our waitress checked back plenty, got us refills promptly and was all around great.  So even though I would choose Anyway's (right next door) over Friday's about 95% of the time, I still have to give this place four stars, for doing what it did well and cheerfully.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=60

It's Friday's.  You should probably check out their new Yucatan chicken salad, it was pretty good. Use the lime they give you on it, it makes it. And you probably want to ask for extra avocado because I barely had any on my salad. Otherwise I typically order the dragon fire chicken, love the jasmine rice that comes with this.

When the server arrived with the Cajun pasta he told me the kitchen was out of soup and asked if I wanted to see the menu to order something else. That's ridiculous waiting so long to tell me that my order can't be filled - if I ordered something else my friend would be done by the time my order was ready.  Also the restaurant wasn't busy by any means and we were our server's only table and he was still super slow with refills.

Jennifer P.,"Addison, IL",385,946,2328,3.0,4/5/2014,"So, my +1 INSISTED on dining at either TGI Friday's or Chili's.  Being that this was the closer of the two, I begrudgingly obliged..   I was pretty shocked to see it so packed; then again, I think there was a game on AND they had $3 Long Islands.. As a pretty staunch ovo-pescetarian, I had a hard time finding seafood or veggie entrees on the menu.  That was pretty surprising to me that chains such as TGI's haven't caught up to the shift of the more health-conscious consumer. The only options that I could locate were seafood pasta or a Black Bean Burger, so I had the latter.  The burger was just OK - kind of flavorless. The burger itself crumbled apart, while the rest of the goop on top (sauce, pickles) slid off.  There was a point when half of my burger was so disassembled that I couldn't get it back together and resorted to eating it with a knife and fork.   Bleh. Our server, Brian, was nice and attentive, but seemed overwhelmed with the amount of tables he had to cover.  He did check on us while he was whizzing on by.  (And I hope my +1 gave him a good tip!)  I did have a gross green floater in my water glass, but he took care of it pretty promptly and apologized for it.  He was also good about getting refills to us without us having to ask.

Yu H.,"Hanover Park, IL",34,113,79,3.0,12/10/2013,"I normally prefer not to eat at chain restaurants what with all the unique offerings in illinois but I was in a hurry and wanted a steak and some french onion and the nearest place was this one. Here's what I got: French Onion (3.15): Good lord this bastard was salty. It looked really damn good (see picture) when I got it but when I uncovered the oozy cheese and crouton, there was this thick (and I mean maple syrup thick)  dark, syrupy substance in it with chunks of onion. It was basically a black gravy There is no way this is the standard recipe for tgi fridays. I probably got a rare f-up where they left a pot of french onion on and it condensed to this thick salty crap. It was WAY too salty, and this is coming from a guy that likes Ramen and olive garden. If you've had a similar experience, let me know so I can complain to their HQ.  I ended up using the soup as gravy for my mashed potatoes haha. It worked well.  Petite Steak: Cooked surprising well considering my appetizer, I asked for medium, I got a perfect pink medium. It comes with a dollop of this rich garlic butter. If you're into garlic, this little ball will make your meal. I even dipped my fries in it. I also asked for a side of Jack daniels sauce which I suspect has no Jack Daniels in it. It was very sweet and syrupy. (11.00) (See Picture) Comes with 2 sides:  I got the seasoned fries which were crispy and good, and the mashed potatoes which were also pretty darn good. Service was good, soup came in 15 minutes of sitting, Steak and sides came 15 minutes later.    Now unlike some chain hating snob faces on Yelp, I don't have some stupid bias against chain restaurants. I take them as they are: salty, consistent, and reasonably priced.  This was was no different with the weird exception of the soup. Would I come here again? Probably, but not unless I really had to.

Johnny A.,"Saint Charles, IL",74,223,39,3.0,9/16/2016,"Just another update since my last review - came with family week of Labor Day. Let me get the major complaint out of the way FIRST, and we do realize this may not be specifically with THIS Friday's alone. ** Friday's Nachos (regular nachos) have been 'discontinued'.  Major bummer.  The Friday's Nachos have basically been a regular staple of the restaurant since literally the late 80's.  We asked a manager about this and he had no idea why, but that it had been finalized earlier in the year.  We actually contacted corporate with this question and have yet to receive an answer (I doubt we will).  They now have - instead - some type of ""chicken nachos"" for about 12.99.  General rule of thumb:  You don't fix something that isn't broken after almost three decades.  Also, if for some reason the 'regular nachos' were no longer doing well, it's highly doubtful the chicken nachos will suddenly fair better. - Our overall service was actually fantastic.  Our waiter (Bryan? African American guy) was being trained and he was beyond attentive, as was his trainer.  A+ on service tonight. - Food was very good.  Prices have gone up a tad on just about everything, but I guess this is to be expected. - One final note:  Over the years, the restaurant has obviously been remodeled MULTIPLE times.  We noticed the 2nd floor section (back of restaurant) now seemed to be painted/wall-papered with some very dull, plain, boring beige-ish /green-ish paint or wall-paper.  It's hard to explain unless you see it.  It was never that way before so this must have been recently done.  Just no vibe to it and it actually takes away from the upbeat atmosphere of that section now, almost brings you down if you keep looking at it - it is just so DRAB.  Again hard to explain, but whoever decided on THIS made a bad decision. Overall:  Good food, great service this time around.  Removing a classic staple from the menu (again probably not relegated to this Friday's alone) was a BAD MOVE, and some of the remodeling with this restaurant just is out in left field...   We will be back, but as stated in my previous reviews we only get here maybe 1-2 times a year on average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=20

So instead I saved us the $20 and just ordered an appetizer... the potato skins. Man did they suck. No flavor at all. Tasted like cardboard.

This happened three times (not kidding). We saw mozzarella sticks, some kind of chicken wings, and some quesillias ... oh ya and some pot stickers .... Maybe other stuff I just stopped paying attention to the idiocy at that point. I followed up my order with the sizzling chicken and cheese. Once again ... a very bland dish. I was here a few weeks ago with another friend and my steak at the time tasted exactly like the chicken I had last night. How is that even possible? This place use to have excellent food. The prices have gone up and the quality is in the toilet. My guest had a coupon to use for a free burger but a point was made that the turkey burger was excluded from the coupon but the manager allowed the transaction anyway. Oh wow another rule ... like kindergarten? Management forces employees to repeat this ridiculousness to paying customers?  Two stars because our server was nice and part of his job is repeating these moronic guidelines, which he clearly felt were completely wack (you could tell by the look of shame he gave while explaining it) Food, stupid rules, and, micromanaging your customers (not your employees?) are going to be why this chain eventually disappears just like applebees and bakers square.

The Steak I ordered to be cooked well done was definitely not. I suspect that they don't even check their meats by temperature as they should and have had complaints in the past seeing as how the waitress who brought my food had to ask me to cut the steak and check it. I choked on the macaroni I ordered as a side because whatever they put on top was overly heated and was visibly burnt. I could have just scraped off the topping and eaten the macaroni but I would have probably chipped a tooth and choked on that as well. It's one thing that one macaroni side was in that condition but my wife's was as well. I would go on with what was wrong with the food but I feel that who ever reads this will get the point. Extremely disappointed and will never eat at a TGIF ever again. I suggest you take your money somewhere else. Old country buffet has better service and food than this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=80
Jennifer S.,"Bartlett, IL",361,677,2317,3.0,9/21/2013,"It's time to kick up TGI Fridays with a third star. They aren't phenomenal, but the staff seems to have gotten better. I like being treated to free food with their Stripes program so that's gotta count for something. For a chain restaurant, they are fine. Middle of the road - at least you know what you're gonna get - it could definitely be worse. I know this isn't a ringing endorsement, but the restaurant is clean, the food will fill you up and the staff was engaged on my last visit. If you're in the area and want a meal without any surprises, this might be a fine option for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=80
P J.,"Carol Stream, IL",0,18,,1.0,7/28/2013,"Lousy food, lousy service and a lousy attitude.  Three strikes and we will never return.  My sandwich was so overcooked that I could hardly chew it.  An order for a drink was forgotten, then forgotten again.  The young server, who had never checked on us to see how our food was, rolled his eyes at us indignantly when we complained.  Someone, who we think was a manager, came by to apologize and said in a thick accent that he would come back and give us a complimentary something (could not understand him).  Despite the fact that he walked past our table a few times later on, he never stopped to say a word to us.  The server dropped off our check (full price) without a word. We had not been here for a while and there is no reason to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=80
Jun K.,"Roselle, IL",40,111,62,4.0,12/10/2013,"Quick stop at 10pm since everywhere was closed.  Good ol' TGI never lets me down.  Waitress was excellent, seemed to be the only one working besides a manager maybe.  We were one of maybe three tables so I could understand.  Food I always seem to like, they got some new burgers in which i devoured, left a fatty tip and off to the freezing cold i went.  Thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=80
Jan B.,"Wheaton, IL",20,9,1,4.0,7/9/2011,"I've enjoyed Fridays since I was introduced to it when moving here from the Detroit area nearly 30 years ago.  Can it really be that long?  Anyway, my two favorite appetizers are the tostados nachos and the potstickers.  I LOVE their potstickers, and have to say that I think they are better than most I can get in any Chinese restaurant.   Service was prompt and cheerful -- ask for Zach if you go...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=80
Samantha J.,"Glendale Heights, IL",0,9,,4.0,1/28/2014,"Always good service, and good food. Never really had any problems other then the fact I had received the wrong drink (which was fixed instantly). Will go back often =]",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=80
Joy S.,"Naperville, IL",576,377,136,4.0,7/11/2011,"As far as Friday's go, this one is pretty average. Our service here this past Saturday evening was really good, though, so this 4 stars goes out to our waitress, Lauren. We had 6 adults and a 2yr old. Even though the restaurant was pretty full at 530p on a Saturday, they were able to seat us quickly. So the seating wasn't the best ever - they squished 2 small tables together by the bathrooms and the beverages. But at least there were less patrons around to get pegged by whatever my nephew felt like throwing (crayons, green bean fries, etc.) And it wasn't smelly like I expected that corner to be - which tells me they keep this location clean. And really, the service was great, between my family members' indecisiveness and my rambunctious nephew - our waitress handled us really really well. And the baby loved everyone singing Happy Birthday to Grandpa :) We also appreciated the benches outside in the shade while we let our stomachs rest before driving again. p.s. Can I have another Mandarin Dreamsicle Alcoholic Shake, please?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=80
Steve L.,"Galena, IL",0,4,,2.0,7/9/2013,Stopped in for lunch. I had the rather expensive Bacon Bleu steak with shrimp scampi and she had the bleu burger. All proteins were over cooked. Our server was decent but the food quality would keep us away.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=80
Samra M.,"Carol Stream, IL",89,154,107,4.0,12/17/2010,"I like how they changed their menu so that some things are cheaper. The environment is a barish type but also family friendly, so bring the kids to eat too! They have a variety of things on their menu that is sure to please anyone you're with. Parking is a little tight on the weekends, so get there early and you should be fine. I like the petite sirloin deal mmm steak",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=80
Grace M.,"Bartlett, IL",0,11,,3.0,8/12/2012,"This place is good, not extraordinary.  Portion sizes are pretty large, and the food is usually brought out relatively quickly once you're seated.  Tends to be very busy on Friday/Saturday night. This is a good place for kids, and they tend to be very accommodating to special requests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=80
Michael M.,"Toronto, Canada",8,14,,4.0,1/22/2012,"I love the passion fruit red bull drink, i usually have it along with the chicken & shrimp cajun pasta. Good stuff",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=80
Stephen N.,"Roselle, IL",3,93,16,4.0,2/25/2008,"I am in love with their Grilled Chicken and Shrimp.  Their steak is pretty good... and their ribs... My favorite of the ""brand name"" ""date"" restaurants. They have a smoking section, which puts me off. Staff is the standard teenage/early 20s crowd.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=80
Max K.,"Winfield, IL",0,2,,3.0,4/4/2012,Twice I went to this location and not once they included my order for my Stripes Rewards. Why advertise it if your waiters never bother to apply those points?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=80
Thelma s.,"Bloomingdale, IL",0,18,,3.0,6/17/2012,food was good but I ordered the chicken and scrimp but the waiter only brought me out the chicken and told me the scrimp would be comming right out however after nearly finishing my meal the waiter returned and said oh you still haven;t got your scrimp then finally they brought it to me after I had finished everything else not to happy with the service although the food was good which is why I'm giving it only 3 stars,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=80
che c.,"Chicago, IL",101,110,52,3.0,7/22/2009,Similar to the other TGIFs but I have noticed a more inexperienced waitstaff.   The last few times servers were in training and once the manager on duty brought us our food. Great place to get an after work drink and have a late night menu.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=80
Loki C.,"Addison, IL",0,34,,4.0,7/13/2011,"I will be the first to say I'm not the biggest fan of the Friday's menu.  However, we have friends who love to come here and are part of the Stripes program, so we go with them sometimes.  The servers make the experience.  Far from the ""30 pieces of flair"" from Office Space, they seem genuinely cool people, the kind you want to buy a drink for and sit around talking about life.  Every server I've had has been conscious of my food allergies, to the point of substituting amaretto for something else in the drink specials.  We usually have our baby with us, and there is no problem getting her a high chair or making room for her car seat carrier.  A lot of the menu choices aren't my favorites, but the steaks and drinks are pretty good.  Desserts could use a LOT of work but it's not their fault, it's corporate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=80
Cindy R.,"Chicago, IL",37,235,,4.0,3/23/2007,"I prefer Friday's to places like Applebee's and other similar competitors. I think their food is slightly better. This location (like others in the area) gets very crowded. There just aren't a huge amount of dinner restaurant choices in the Bloomingdale/Hanover Park area. Anyway, service is decent, I had a good experience, so I'd recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomingdale?start=80
