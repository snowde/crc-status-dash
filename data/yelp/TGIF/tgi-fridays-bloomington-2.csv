John G.,"Prattville, AL",22,10,,5.0,8/4/2015,We ate there Sunday evening and the food was great!! The server was Andrew and he was very nice and attentive.  I was able to joke around and Kidd with him and he joked back. We had a blast with him.. I don't know what the complaints are all about we saw nothing wrong. I think you people are being too picky.I bet nothing is right with anything for some of you. This Fridays is the best one we've ate at yet!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
Charcy L.,"Bloomington, IN",20,135,286,4.0,7/27/2015,"Food is ok here, and service is great! Very convenient place in college mall with lots of parking spots, traditional American foods with great selection of appetizers, I really like their appetizer combo which you could choose several appetizers to share in cheaper price^^",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
Tom H.,"Bloomington, IN",23,316,,2.0,12/1/2012,"TGI Fridays here is ok for drinks. Service was slow, confused, and mistakenly personal. Appetizers in the bar are half price after 9pm. Not much nourishment here, but they are kinda vegetarian friendly if there's one or more in your crowd. It's better than McDonalds, and only 2x as expensive.  We got too many colorful menus. The variety seems nice on the surface, but it's just tough to get excited about the food. I suppose the desserts looked ok, but the rest looked like the Best of the Sysco Food Service catalog.  I keep trying of things that were nice to give it another star, but couldn't come up with any. There's an MBA somewhere in a corporate office looking at this review trying to figure out why sales aren't so hot. I think the answer is: this place has no soul. There are albums on the wall, Jimi Hendrix posters, wall-mounted guitars. But no soul. Not a dram, not a microgram. It's tougher for chains to have soul, it's true, but it can happen. In a college town, after the home team wins a game, like today, the place oughta be packed with *somebody*, especially on a Saturday night. It oughta be hoppin, drinks, music, laughter, commotion, something.  Not here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
Robin K.,"New York, NY",332,376,437,3.0,6/9/2015,"Brr, it's chilly in here! Every time I have gone I have been offered a table in the bar area. The servers and bartenders are friendly. One time I received a dish that I was absolutely not pleased with and had to return it to the back (some Cajun chicken sandwich, I believe). Although that is an uncomfortable situation, they did not make me feel bad about it and I replaced it with some delicious soup!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
Neal S.,"Sheridan, IN",146,9,2,5.0,5/29/2015,"Absolutely outstanding. The rating on this restaurant is not at all accurate. For a Friday night, it must have been slow. Table of two, walked right in and was seated. Service was amazing, I had four drinks before leaving and I didn't have to ask. The food was perfection, from display to taste. The manager came by, which might have been the reason everyone was so on top of their game. But either way, a perfect night for a date.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
Yvonne M.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",39,190,115,2.0,1/28/2012,"I was disappointed with the Flat Iron steak I ordered which came out well done (should be medium well), hard to chew and bitter.  I like that they have raspberry tea and the sweet potato fries are pretty good. They tasted like a combination of crispy and seasoned.  Oh and the service is kinda slow too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
Peace P.,"Bloomington, IN",0,1,,1.0,8/26/2015,"Alex Everett! ""The owner"" as he calls himself! "" This is my restaurant like it or not"" as he yelled it out loud over and over in front of a parent in the presence of his kids!  Never ever in my 40 years and I'm sure i will never ever see as disrespectful and as rude as Alex Everett! A gang style unbelievable!  please someone tell him that he is not the owner nor this is his restaurant please specially if it took him minutes to turn every treasured memory we have as a family in several fridays restaurants around the states into PAIN!! a severe emotion pain. Please!  We love you fridays, and no one nor Alex Everett has the right to misrepresent you and hurt your loyal guests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
Mindy C.,"Seymour, IN",14,26,,4.0,5/31/2015,Food and service were good. Good specials. The server was attentive but not intrusive. There were 7 of us and no one had a bad meals.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
Hollywood H.,"Bloomington, IN",10,18,10,5.0,2/13/2015,Got some carry out tonight and drinks while we were waiting at the bar. Great service and great food as well. Our bartender and the manager went above and beyond to make sure we had an enjoyable dining experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
Jeff L.,"Bloomington, IN",105,174,650,2.0,7/20/2011,"I'm not a fan of TGI Friday's, mostly because the service always seems to be a bit beyond slow. . . it's SUPER slow.  The food is average, comparable to other similar paces, but nothing to write home about.  The new pizza offerings are pretty good, as are the burgers, but otherwise the menu just doesn't ever rise to the standards of the yummy pictures.  Generally speaking, in Bloomington, there are many better options for quick sit-down dining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
Jordan Z.,"Waynesville, MO",7,59,4,5.0,5/25/2014,I can always count on Fridays to be consistent across the USA. Always friendly and fast. Keep it up guys and gals!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
MsAnthro P.,"Bloomington, IN",49,246,879,1.0,12/9/2012,"I never want to be at the mall, especially during the holiday season, but sometimes a pair of glasses gets broken and you have to do what you have to do. In some cases you haven't eaten all day and you settle for the closest option while waiting for said glasses to be made. I'd never been to this chain before because I'd always guessed it would be mediocre or worse. I was right. Our server was friendly but we barely saw her. Our appetizer was served by someone else who didn't think to give us plates. This was pretty frustrating given that the table next to us was given appetizer plates right when they ordered appetizers and we watched them sit there unused the whole time we fruitlessly waited for someone to come to our table. We wound up just eating without plates. Messy, to say the least. While the appetizer was sort of okay, although only room temperature in spots, nothing else was. My BF's steak kebob was mostly chunks of fat. My Korean steak tacos were filled with undressed lettuce, barely any sauce or slaw and they were dry and flavorless as hell. The waitress brought me a refill of Sprite that had no flavoring syrup in it. Of course, I didn't complain because I feel I got what I deserved for coming here in the first place. I understand that things are busy at this time of year, but that means staff really needs to step it up and not move at a snail's pace. That said, judging from the look and attitude of the clientele there when we were, I'm sure the servers don't get tipped well enough on a regular basis to care. I wound up tipping 20% because it's Christmas season and I felt sorry for the server for having to work there. But neither the service nor the product warranted it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
Danielle B.,"Bloomington, IN",9,20,6,2.0,8/22/2014,"I want to like this place I really do, it's in close proximity to my place, has a ton of options and serves booze but I don't.  I've tried many things from the updated (really?!) Menu but have been disappointed and really just underwhelmed. Food is so so service is so so the whole package is just so so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
Cory B.,"Bloomington, IN",14,9,,2.0,11/9/2014,Drinks were good. Food toook foreverrrrrrr to come out. Was not properly explained the conditions of their 'Endless Appetizers'. A manager even came over to iron out the situation but offered us a expensive solution. Overall the experience was lacking and I won't be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
Pam C.,"Nashville, IN",4,8,26,3.0,6/28/2014,"I love the music here.  Food is variable; ranges from awesome to (yawn). My favorite used to be the bruschetta Chicken pasta, but they changed the recipe and now it's just so-so. Still the best place in the mall to wind down with a beer after some heavy duty shopping, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
Joe H.,"Bloomington, IN",32,4,1,5.0,6/25/2015,"My wife and I visited TGIFs today with our adult autistic son.  We were fortunate to find out favorite server and bartender, Kevin, working. As always, Kevin went out of his way to accommodate our son's special needs. We highly recommend TGIFs, and we highly value Kevin as a server.  In addition, the food was great, the salads were fresh, and everything was prepared exactly as requested. We will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
Franklin D.,"Indianapolis, IN",360,781,166,2.0,5/12/2013,"Been here a few times because my kids like it. I'm not real happy with the food. All I can think of is that part on the movie Office Space where the hyper flair kid is asking them if they want ""shooter, popper, extreme fajitas""... ugh NO.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
June B.,"Herndon, VA",0,23,,4.0,9/16/2012,"Yes, this is a chain restaurant. But the recent addition of their ""selected entree + appetizer or dessert for $10 or $15"" deals make it a surprisingly affordable option for a pleasant dinner out. My husband and I both took advantage of this deal -- he with the appetizer, I with the dessert -- and by sharing them, we both had a three-course meal for about $25. We weren't in any hurry that night, but we had no complaints about the service. Our waiter even brought us extra chips for the queso dip -- which earned him a nice tip. My tip to you: try the caramel cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
Cooper W.,"Bloomington, IN",0,2,,4.0,3/29/2011,I love that you can get a really good deal on some tasty food here. Not healthy but really delicious. Coupons always are accepted even when expired or accepted in groups even when specifically it says may not be used in conjunction with other offers. YOU the guest must always leave happy and that means you get whatever you want. Just don't be rude to the servers and bartenders and tip them 20% on what the value of the bill  WAS not what it is after the coupon/discounts.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
Sara S.,"Spencer, IN",10,1,,1.0,1/6/2013,"When we got their it was a bit busy but we didn't mind waiting. After about a 45 minute wait to get a table we sat there another half hour before we even had a waiter come to take our drink order. No joke, they totally forgot about us, we heard them whispering about not knowing who had our table. Finally when we were about to walk out my husband told the lady who seated us that we had no waiter. About 5 minutes later we were able to order. The waiter was nice but he still sort of did a sucky job. After we ordered it then took another good 45 minutes to get our order. It was ridiculous, we almost walked out again, but didn't cause we figured it would eventually come and we were starving. After we got our seats people started leaving so its not like it was crazy busy. My brother was going to buy a bunch of drinks but after his first one he changed his mind, too bad for them. He ordered a mixed drink and when he got it he said it was awful, he was sure they used way too much alcohol. Finally when we did get to eat, the majority of the food was pleasant but again they messed up my brothers. He ordered a steak medium rare (he would eat it raw if he could...gross). He ordered it like that because he likes how tender it is suppose to be. When he got this steak, the color looked right maybe a little too done but it was as hard as a brick. He was too proud to complain though, he just swore he'd never return to that restaurant again! Everyone ordered waters as well and it was hard for the waiter to keep our drinks full, which should have been easy to remember. We aren't too hard to please but they did a terrible job. At the least they could of offered us a free appetizer/dessert or something for the delay in service, but no.The table beside us who sat down a good 15 minutes after us was also waited on first. We had 5 adults and 2 kids, its not like it would have been easy to miss us. Needless to say I doubt any of us intend to eat there again any time soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bloomington-2
