Stephanie F.,"Boston, MA",0,4,1,1.0,3/24/2015,"If I could give this place negative stars, I definitely would. I am not a mean person, but this place made me cranky and I came home with an attitude problem. We probably ate for a total of 45 minutes, and spent the remaining 3 or 4 hours waiting for either a beer or an appetizer. It took approximately 2 hours to get the check totaled out correctly as well. We had to ask for a manager to help because it was that bad, and even she didn't apologize and didn't seem to be phased by how frustrated we all were. In conclusion. This place is sketchy. I don't trust them with my time and money, and that's sad. I'd rather go to the Mission next door. :/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=40

Young P.,"Boston, MA",224,348,388,3.0,8/30/2015,"All you can eat appetizer deal right now for $12. Came here with my wife on a random week night and although the service was super slow, we were happy with the fact that they didn't make both of us order the all you can eat app. We pretty much just shared apps and it was a great deal. Although you kind of get sick of the appetizers after a while, it is a great deal if you think about it! Plus, although the sign said you can't ask for a box to take the food home, our waiter didn't care and told us that we can pack everything home. I think they were more lenient though since we went there around night time (towards 10PM).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=40
Kevin O.,"Boston, MA",0,16,,2.0,1/23/2016,"Food was on par and our bartender, Samantha was very nice and attentive. On the downside, I witnessed one of the bartenders (short white girl with a red shirt) put her grimy troll hands into the ice and then into the drinks. Conveniently, she also had a band- aid on said troll hands. To top it off, she pulled one of her disgusting red/ blonde hairs out of one of the drinks and proceeded to serve it to an unsuspecting customer",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=40

Essence T.,"Big Pine Key, FL",1,10,12,2.0,3/19/2016,"Me & my boyfriend went there last night as a last minute cool off type of date from work. We mainly went for appetizers and a drink. When we walked in, around 10:30, it was packed but was told the wait would be 20 minutes so we decided to wait it out. We asked the host would it be okay to wait at the bar until we were called for a table. He said it was fine. Before we ordered drinks and an endless app, I asked the bartender would we be charged twice for the app once we got seated at a table. She said no we would just have to close our tab with her and tell our waiter that we already paid from the bar and that we should tell our waiter to let our manager know when we get our second receipt. After about 30 minutes at the bar, my boyfriend got up to see where were we in getting a table. The host said he already called our name. I never heard our name called. Granted it was busy but he may have said it to the waiting area but didn't come over to the bar side as other restaurants do. Nevertheless my boyfriend wasn't mad, he just asked that we be alerted for the next available one.  We closed our bar tab & finally get a table. The host leads us and my boyfriend brought up the endless app thing again just for clarity, he said what the bartender said. The wait for our food and drinks was extra long but again we were just there to wind down. When we got our check, it had our drinks okay but also an endless appetizer. My boyfriend kindly told our waitress that we already paid for it and was continuing to eat the same item. We told her what both the bartender and host said, she said she would ask her manager. She came back about 15 minutes later and said that the manager was very busy and couldn't come over at the moment. Well then. My boyfriend said well ask the bartender because he was not about to pay twice for an ENDLESS APPETIZER!! The bartender came over with an attitude and said well idk if y'all misunderstood but blah blah blah bullshit! My boyfriend took control of the situation and told her exactly what she told us and how she was wrong, trying to argue with us over $12 which we shouldn't have to pay. But she just continued to be aggressive, slammed our check on the table and walked away. My boyfriend ended up paying for it twice. Our waitress kept apologizing but we reinsured her it wasn't her fault and that they need new ppl or retrain the old ones on real customer service. I was furious. For her sake I'm glad my boyfriend took control bcus I would ripped her a new one. Won't be returning!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=40
Chris L.,"Boston, MA",546,356,153,3.0,5/19/2014,"My problem with this Friday's is that it is usually a hit or miss. I live up the street from the restaurant and frequent here when I'm feeling lazy; sometimes I'm rewarded for my laziness, and other times I'm left feeling disappointed in myself. Friday's is your typical chain restaurant, and this location is no different. They have some great weekly drink and food specials, and I should consider coming here during the best ones. My favorite dish (and they have yet to screw it up) is the tostado nachos! I could eat those suckers all day er-day. My actual meals, however, are always a gamble. I could order the same thing three times in three separate visits and eat something completely different each time. Their relatively good service makes up for what could have been two stars, though. They handle the constant crowd well, and they do it with loads of personality and (usually) good spirits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=40

Justina T.,"Newport Beach, CA",32,118,187,2.0,12/1/2013,"6:45pm - I arrived here with my two friends on a Friday evening. We waited for about 45 minutes (even though the hostess said it was a 20-30 minute wait) before we were seated.  7:30pm - We were seated and given menus. 7:50pm - The server came by to take our orders for drinks... we ordered our food as well because we didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for her to come back. 8:20pm - Our food came out (my friend and I ordered the Jack Daniel's Sampler ... which is a freaking appetizer!... my other friend ordered Jack Daniel's Chicken & Shrimp). We realized the table didn't have any silverware so we flagged down a server to give us utensils. 8:25pm - We received our forks and knives and ate the food. The Sampler was pretty decent... the chicken was drenched in the sauce and the ribs were tender. The shrimp was nothing special, but what do you expect. I was satisfied with the food. 8:50pm - (Yes, we are fast eaters) We asked our server for the bill. 9:00pm - The server came by and asked us if we were okay. We asked her again to give us our bill. 9:10pm - Our server gave us our bill. We had asked for separate checks, and my friend and I paid with cash whilst my other friend paid with a credit card. 9:20pm - Our server passed by us without picking up our bill even though I put it on the edge of the table.  9:30pm - Our server picked up the bill and asked if any of us paid in cash and if we needed change. I paid with a $20 bill and would have $6.10 in change, so I answered, ""Yes!"" 9:45pm - The server came back with our change and receipts and said, ""Next time you come here, ask for __(her name)__ and I'll be your server."" My friends and I had to contain our laughter until she walked away. I received my $6 in change, but no dime. My friend also should have received 10 cents as change, but there were no dimes. Our server stole our 20 cents!!! tl;dr the food is ok, but the service is hella lousy... we had to wait an hour to get our bill",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=40
Berthonya J.,"Malden, MA",148,1,2,1.0,11/21/2014,"If I could give this no stars I would. I ordered fridays to go. The phone attendant was rude but I got past that. I ordered chicken and shrimp pasta, with 2 sides, mashed potatoes and their sad excuse of macaroni. Also got an appetizer of potstickers which was the only good thing about this meal. Once I got back to the office I opened my box to see that there was just one Slab of chicken and a few pieces of fried shrimp. The mashed potatoes tasted as if they were made in a microwave.  The worst was their pathetic excuse for Mac and cheese. The pasta was barely cooked and the cheese was just tossed on top.  Never will I return to this restaurant.

Suely T.,"Dorchester Center, MA",0,5,2,1.0,1/3/2016,"I keep giving this place the benefit of the doubt and i dont know why or maybe its because its the closest one to home  I cant say the place sucks because there are some staff that know what theyre doing and theyre really pleasant. However at times the service is horrible. Today for example i came in with my boyfriend and while eating my sweet potato fries for appetizer there was a strand of hair in my plate i call it out to the waitress Erin's attention and she i quote said ""non of the chefs have hair"". Now im sorry was she accusing me of setting the hair on the plate myself ? No apologies not even a i can replace it nothing! Not to mention we ordered extra pasta for the rajun cajun and it only came with 3 pieces of shrimp. She was attentive to all her other tables around us but us. I asked the hostess to see a manager after having to ask her to bring me a side of mayo since Erin never got it for me and the manager never came!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=40
Cheryl N.,"Warwick, RI",0,7,4,1.0,9/19/2016,"Came in around 4:30 on a Sunday to a fairly empty restaurant after a hospital visit with family. Waited in the reception area at least 10 minutes without even being acknowledged then finally a man came and stood behind the podium and rudely just stood there as if we were bothering him. So I approached, and told him we were a party of 5. Was told about ten minutes. Which actually took 15. Then was told all he had was a high top in the bar area. This would have been ok for me except we had our elderly parents with us which was a bit uncomfortable for them but we were hungry so we took it. Finally seated, again never acknowledged by any wait staff for at least 20 minutes. Had to go to the bar and ask if we even had a waitress and was told she was coming right out. Well she did, except she went to a table that sat about ten minutes after we did. Finally got service after she placed and delivered their drink orders. Food came out as ordered pretty much within a somewhat reasonable amount of time. We frequently visit TGI when we are out of town since we kind of know we can expect decent food. I have to say that the entire staff in this particular place was the rudest I have ever seen! Too bad, they should all really go and find a job that they like and get out of the service business since they are very poor representatives of this one. Definitely will NEVER revisit here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=40

We were pretty disgusted by the dining room so we opted to sit at the bar which turned out to be no cleaner. The bar top was sticky and littered with dirty dishes and glasses. The bartender broke a glass over the ice well and didn't even melt the ice down and get out the broken glass! The silverware roll up he gave me had a human hair wrapped around it.

I opted for sweet potato fries for an extra $1 only because TGIF's has some of the best SPF's in the restaurant game!! I am never disappointed with them. If you get an entree I think they come as one of the side options with no extra charge.  The burger was juicy and delicious and the bun was perfectly soft.  Total was $10.20 without tax--minus 1 star because I think overall TGIF's is overpriced for their portion size.

Also, we went ahead and put my sons order and a app( bone in buff wings) with ranch and bleu cheese. 5 min later my son gets his slushy which he was excited about. 10 min later, our wings finally come out with bleu cheese only. I asked his service partner if we could have app plates and ranch. She then stated, "" I suppose you need napkins too?"" I said yes, that would be great! At this point, STILL NO MARGARITAS NOR WATERS with buffalo wings at the table! Anthony comes back says ""well, I'm waiting on the bartender!"" I didn't even bother to mention the waters to him!

I found out from a friend that they give VIP lunch cards where they put a hole in a card for each visit and after the fifth visit, lunch is free.  Neither the hostess nor the server told me about this during either visit.  I went to the Boston location and the hostess who was also there during my first visit started out by giving me a phony greeting because she thought I would be eating there.  I asked her about the lunch cards and she said that they would start to punch it on my next visit.  I told her that I should already have 2 holes and she did not tell me about it.  She said that she just started and did not know about it.  She went to a manager and he said that they just started the lunch cards last week and that he would give me one hole.  I didn't believe that and that response was inconsistent with what the hostess said about just starting there and not knowing about it.  I went to the Everett location and I asked an employee how long they have been doing the lunch cards.  He said for a long time.  I explained to him that the staff in Boston had been dishonest with me and I asked if he could give me another hole.  He said he would check with the manager.  He came back and said that they can't because they either need a receipt or it would have to be on the same day.  It would not have been a big deal for him to just add 1 hole and it was not worth losing a customer.  What's worse than losing a visit on the card is their dishonesty.  I tried calling the corporate office and I could not get through.  It prompted me to select 3 to speak with someone and the recording claimed not to understand. During my visits, I had to wait because they were understaffed and I usually didn't find anybody at the desk when I came in.  Some orders took too long to come.  The food is rather unhealthy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=20

For our group, we got boneless parmesan garlic wings, boneless buffalo wings, spinach and cheese dip, and mozzarella cheese sticks.  We ordered a total of 3 rounds and that was plenty of food.  As a tip, I suggest you put in the next order right when your food comes out and ask for them to come out as they are ready (instead of waiting for all of them to come out at the same time).  Doing this will expedite the rate at which you receive your food.  We were so full and couldn't finish our third round so we took a bunch of leftovers home.

Kristy C.,"Boston, MA",65,1,,1.0,1/10/2017,"Had the worst experience ever at a Friday's. We dined on a Monday night with a wait at 7:45pm. Ok, fine, the football game was about to begin and we were meeting up with friends, so no biggie....right? Finally was sat at a table, server didn't arrive until 5 minutes later. When taking our drinks and appetizer order, her cell phone goes off, takes it out of her apron, and I swear, she almost answered it. Seriously? Comes back with some drinks, I order a water in the meantime, and had to ask for a straw. My friend and I decide on a drink and place the order. Appetizer is delivered. Plates are there, but no utensils. Still no drink.  Still no straw. Apps are done.  Waiting, waiting, waiting. Dinner arrives, but we notice the bartender coming back into the restaurant with coffee. Jokingly, we note how are drinks will be made now (25 minutes later). Dinner is served. Drinks are served. Still no straw. This is the worst service I have ever encountered. People go out to eat because they want to be taken care of. There wasn't a manager present and all the staff were wearing coats, sweatshirts, etc.  You could only tell if a person was an employee with their lanyard hanging. Get it together!

The hostess at the front seems to just disappear and there have been friends of the employees loitering around the entrance and to-go register almost every time I've been here.

Anthony L.,"Boston, MA",159,221,75,3.0,2/17/2012,"This is a chain restaurant which means you should never get your hopes up. I went here on a Friday afternoon for lunch with some colleagues. I assumed since they are located in the Longwood Medical Area, they are used to people going there for a quick lunch (say, 45 - 60 minutes at the most).  We get there and we were told the wait will be 10 minutes. I was slightly confused since there were many open tables, but there's no use in arguing. 25 minutes later we were seated.  I'll give everyone the benefit of the doubt, maybe they were super busy the whole day. Perhaps they are understaffed. I don't know the reason, but it took forever for everything! 10-15 minutes after we place our drink order (all waters) we were finally ordering. About 30 minutes after ordering we finally got our food. And 5 minutes after we get the food we -finally- get cutlery.  Maybe I sound like a super complainer, but how long does it take to make 6 salads? I imagine a chef placed one piece of lettuce, ever so gingerly, on top of each other followed by the tomato, grilled chicken, and cheese. Seriously though, half-hour to make? Humph! On the upside, my salad was indeed delicious. I ordered the grilled chicken cobb salad with extra bleu cheese on the side and lemon-ginger ""splash"" (for less than $9! Bargain). Everything tasted fresh (hopefully it was) and the chicken was prepared perfectly.  Was the service sub-par? Yeah. Did it take forever to feed my hungry tummy? You bet. Was the food good?

My problem with that, is our bags. The bags that belong to the kids will be opened and closed multiple times (depending upon what the kids want from the bag) so it'll inevitably wind up in the aisle. We asked for a booth and after much debate over a booth in this or that section (she kept checking the seating arrangements - but all the booths were empty) we got the one right at the door.  Drinks were taken immediately, our server was quite pleasing and patient as our 6yr couldn't make up his mind. 5 minutes later we ordered our food. No apps, just entrees. So here's why 2 stars. 35 mins later we are still waiting for food. Normally not a problem to wait but the restaurant was maybe 35% capacity. My picky eater even noticed the food was taking a while. We asked the server and she said she'd check, her response was the kitchen was slow. Slow?? Most of the patrons when we entered were eating already. Since we were at the door we could tell how many people had come in, and maybe only 2 more parties had entered. 40 mins after ordering we were eating. The food was good and nothing wrong with our orders but the wait time was just not cool. Also I am a huge fan of ""Shantys"" (lemonade and beer) but the one they are offering was horrible.

But when you work in the LMA and need a sit-down lunch in a place that works for a large group, there aren't too many options, and while I greatly prefer the LMA Bertucci's over the LMA Friday's for this purpose, Friday's isn't the absolute worst restaurant I've ever been to.  It's a chain, with the usual cons: food is too processed and sickeningly bad for you, service is spotty, atmosphere makes you want to die a little inside. On the pro side, prices are relatively cheap and portion sizes are generous- although isn't this actually a con? (This is why we're fat, America- why can't the healthy stuff be cheap and abundant instead?) My department footed the bill for an administrator's appreciation lunch here the other day (can't complain much about a free lunch), and I got the Jack Daniel's salmon entree, which wasn't terrible- but it's Friday's, it's never going to be very good either. You know what you're getting into when you come here, and I'd say this location is no better or no worse than any other location/chain (my dining companions seemed to enjoy their food just fine).

My experience varies every time i come here. There have been times i get the same waiter/waitress. Some have been attentive while others aren't. Some look like they're in a rush all the time and don't always take the time to listen to what you're ordering or trying to tell them.  There are times when my orders are wrong - but it's usually not by much. There was only once where the steak was under cooked and once it was done too well. By the time they bring back the steak, i had finish the rest of my food.  In comparison to other chain restaurants such as TGIFridays, the price is reasonable. They have recently added other menu prices and items, as well as 3 course meal items that are a lot friendlier to the wallet.  The only thing that's somewhat annoying is it's very loud music and when someone has a birthday. It's very hard to try to carry a conversation. It doesn't matter the day, the music isn't great for restaurant food. the only time it's not as loud is during lunch time.  My experience with the managers has always been cordial. If there was an error, they always try to fix it.  Overall, the experience wasn't bad except for one, but i wasn't there to witness it. I had already left when the event took place. I went back to speak to the manager about it. she agreed the situation shouldn't have occurred and yet, i still see that same waitress in there.

I arrived at Fridays, the waitstaff at this location were friendly and on point.  This is more or less what I expected.  The first thing I ordered was the Skinny Margarita which was almost sickeningly sweet, definitely too much sour mix.  After that I ordered the 3 for 16.99 which consisted of Fried Mozzarella, Cheese Burger, and the Oreo Madness.   The Fried  Mozzarella was very tasty and what one would expect from fried cheese.  Weren't amazing but weren't bad. Next was my burger, and here is where things fell apart.  After taking off the buns and eating my side of mixed vegetables I start to eat the burger.  After I get about halfway through I notice a very unusual texture, something very gritty.  There was sandy-dirt on the lettuce in my burger.  To the dismay of my group I decided to bring this up to our waitress.  She apologized, and went to go check on it with the chefs.    When she returned she informed me that it was actually the spread they use on their bean burger, right...  From then out she apologized again and comped the burger for me as I would hope. Last was the Oreo madness which was yummy, an over sized Oreo cookie ice cream sandwich whats not to like? At the end of the meal I was less than impressed however I did feel that the service here was pretty good considering the sandy burger.  The checks were divided up without having to ask and the wait time was relatively short. Lastly I left feeling a tad uneasy because of the server's explanation.  Given I fancy myself quite the foodie, I am sure I can tell the difference between sandy dirt and a spread for another type of burger.  I must say in the end I was wondering what is the logic behind using sand as an ingredient in a spread.  However I didn't want to give them 1 star on what I would hope to be a fluke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=80

I, like many others I'm sure, used to frequent the Newbury Street location..I used to go to that one a fair bit, and then I left town. Anyway, it's close to the T at least and in a decent area, with Longwood and Brigham Circle being around and all. It's in a new-ish complex that has a Stop and Shop and a Walgreen's.  Ok, on to the actual food. I sat by the bar since there was a bit of a wait for tables and it made more sense since I was by myself. I had a couple Buds ($3) while watching some game on the TV. For an entree, I ordered my go-to, the Jack Daniel's Sirloin and Shrimp ($20.99). I always liked the Jack Daniel's stuff...that sauce is like crack cocaine for some reason. The steak was cooked to specification, medium well, but wasn't as tasty as some steaks I've had. It came with two sides, so I had the jasmine rice and garlic mashed potatoes. Nothing awful, but nothing mind blowing either. Overall vibe of the place would have to be a mash-up of the ""hood"" crowd, as someone else mentioned, and the college aged crowd. I wasn't too surprised by this considering its location...Roxbury, one of the ""hoods"", is like a good 5 minutes east on Tremont, and there's a bunch of colleges on Huntington Ave near Longwood and MFA. I enjoyed the contrast though...it was pretty interesting. Bill comes to around $30, which isn't bad. I enjoyed the service as a whole, so 18% seemed sufficient as a tip.  I enjoyed the overall experience...shall be back, I'm sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=80

Our server was very nice and super attentive. Our dinner went by quite quickly because she was so attentive! It was good that it went by quickly since this was the night of Game 6 for the Celtics and we were ready to eat and leave so we can catch the game.  This time my friend and I shared a Japanese hibachi chicken skewer, which I LOVED. It was so good! And for entrees I got a Cobb salad, which was also very good! And I got full off of it too, since it was a big salad. I also had a side of seasoned fries and iced mango peach lemonade. Everything we ordered was good and the bill came out to be very cheap as well.  We ate and left within an hour. Very satisfying!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=80

I was seated after a 5 min wait time and I ordered a jack Daniels Sampler for appetizer and a jack Daniel's 10oz rib eye and half a rack of ribs with a glass of red wine. It took 30 min or so because the place was soo busy but it was well worth the wait. The steak was really good and flavorful( ordered med rare) and the ribs were even better!

The hostess disappeared to the back when we was ready to be seated so we had to wait for someone else. The waiter seemed disconnected from the world because he had no emotion whatsoever! He did apologize though when the food took a while. I pretty much filled up on my drinks before the food got there. My friends burger was too pink to be well done so she didn't even bother eating it. I prefer to order out because I don't have to come in constant contact with anyone from this location. I have had some pretty bad experiences with take out as well.

Sidney L.,"San Francisco, CA",335,163,4,3.0,3/10/2013,"Three different social groups intersect in Mission Hill, and they all have their different bars in the area. There are the students (Flann's), the health care types (The Squealing Pig), and the local born-and-raised types, who seem to largely be the kinds of people that TGI serves. I have frequented this TGIs many times for lunch, dinner, mostly because it is one of the few sit-down establishments in the area, and this place is also a decent option for happy hour (half off certain appetizers). - The nice thing about restaurant chains is that you know what you're going to get, and TGI Friday's is no different. You'll get solid service and a reliable commercial menu, at reasonable (though by no means cheap) prices. - The bar is a good place to catch a sports game. They have a lot of TVs, so no matter where you are seated, you'll have one (or a few) screens to look at. It gets pretty rowdy come playoff time for Bruins and Celtics games. - You can get a pretty good deal on a meal if you do a 2 for $10/$12/$15 meal. There are also lots of ways to get coupons for a discount or free appetizer (signing up for the mailing list, filling out a survey, using their smartphone app). The ""endless lunch"" comes with all you can eat salad, breadsticks, soup, and soda, and that's a pretty good deal too. Note that their Caesar salad comes with a ""Caesar vinaigrette"" (whatever that is), not a creamy Caesar dressing. - TGI Friday's is not such a great place for vegetarians. There's not much on the menu for vegetarians, other than salads. I really struggled with the menu during a short vegetarian phase I went through. - The ribs, the chicken and shrimp pasta, and the the green beans fries (you can pretend like these are healthy) are a few dishes that stand out in my mind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=80

The one thing I don't like is that the regulars come in and grab all the service and your recieve little or no service at all, not to mention they're favored over other customers, which is understandable, but you're paying just as much perhaps more and you shouldn't be put on the backburner for service.  The food comes out pretty fast after you order and it's usually hot.

Nicole E.,"North Weymouth, MA",0,2,,1.0,12/22/2017,"If I could give zero stars I would. This was the worst service I have ever received. We arrived at Fridays and it was very slow, not many people in the dining room or the bar. We were seated but not given any menus. About ten minutes went by before a server came by and asked us if the hostess told us who our server was, we said no. He came back about five minutes later, said he would be our server, and gave us menus. We waited awhile for him to come over and take our drink order. When he finally came to take it, we ordered our food at the same time because we could see how slow the service was. We waited a very long time for our drinks. We were seated for at lease 45 minutes before we even received water, and we had to flag down a hostess to even receive that.  We finally got our drinks after being there an hour and then continued to wait another half hour for our food. When the food came, some was missing it was probably another fifteen minutes before that came.The server never came to check on the table and anytime we asked for anything he would disappear for 20 minutes.  We asked for the bill and take out boxes when the missing food came, because we knew it would take a long time. We finally asked to speak to the manager before paying the bill and the server never even apologized. He just started making excuses that they were busy...they weren't, and they were short staffed...didn't look like it to me.  The manager took about fifteen minutes to come over and talk to us and then made excuses that she was out back doing coupons. She only took a small amount off the bill and was not very apologetic. They must get these complaints all the time. I couldn't even enjoy the food because we were there on our lunch break, which was only supposed to be an hour. We ended up being there for two hours and probably spent about 110 minutes waiting and 10 minutes eating. I would recommend that you find someplace else in Brigham Circle, like The Mission or Penguin Pizza, if you want to eat. It is surprising that a restaurant in an area that is heavily trafficked by hospital workers and visitors, would have such slow and terrible service.  I will never eat at this TGI Fridays again.

Emmalee T.,"Boston, MA",113,9,,1.0,8/4/2017,"Hoo boy. Where do I even start? Probably by saying I've never had worse service at a restaurant. That in and of itself should tell you to stay away, but I'll get into the gory details so I can make it as clear to you as possible that you shouldn't eat here. But first, let me get out of the way the only two good things of the night: 1) We were seated quickly (on a Thursday night, the place wasn't busy. The fact that it wasn't busy only made the indignities to come seem worse). 2) The food tasted decent. Nothing stunning, but decent. You don't come to TGI Fridays for stunning food, though. If you walk in knowing what you signed up for, food-wise, you will get exactly what you expect. (Unless they leave out parts of your order.... but we'll get to that.) Now for the bad things. This is a much longer list. 1) We waited half an hour for our drinks, despite sitting right next to the bar, where we could see there was literally nothing going on. There wasn't even a bartender behind the bar for ten minutes, even though there were a few (a few) people sitting at said bar. This should have been a warning to us.  2) Our waitress waited till that half-hour had elapsed and she'd brought everyone else their drinks to tell me the bartenders had no idea how to make a michelada (basically beer, lime juice, and hot sauce), and could I order something else. I ordered a bourbon with seltzer and lime. I was brought a bourbon with seltzer and..... lemon. I drank it because a) lemon is also good and b) I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes, but I was confused - how do you mess up something so simple? 3) We ordered our food at the same time as our drinks. Five of us went for the endless apps, I (doing the low-carb thing at present) went for a green-style buffalo burger with a side salad. (With ranch. This'll be important later.) Over 45 minutes went by before any of us got any food, and then it was only me.  5) I immediately noticed my burger was missing the skewer of wings that it's supposed to come with, and my salad was missing the ranch.  6) Our waitress came by to inform us she'd delivered the first round of the apps to the (very confused) table next to us, and that was why we hadn't gotten them yet. No apology. Just sort of.... matter-of-factly told us, while bringing out (finally) some of the apps we had ordered - in half-portions. The first round of endless apps is supposed to be full portions. I know, cause I've been through this shindig before, in other, happier times. She vanished before I could ask about the wings or ranch. 7) Five minutes later, she brought me the skewer of wings without being prompted, but also without apology or explanation. I asked if I could please get the ranch my salad was supposed to come with, and she brought that too. Again, unapologetic. I began to wonder if I was in an alternate universe. Even at the dive-iest restaurants I've been to, if multiple things are missing from an order AND some of the food is delivered to the wrong table, someone has apologized about it. Doesn't even have to be sincere! I get that people are busy! Just... SOMETHING. Something to acknowledge that your customers are people and not just cardboard cutouts with food-holes. 8) Our second round of apps ALSO got delivered to the wrong table. Another 20 minutes later. A different waiter brought out the third round so we didn't have the same problem again. 9) By 10 pm (over 2 hours after we had arrived) my friends had gotten 3 rounds of half-portioned apps, and were ready to give up. I'd eaten my burger and salad, which wasn't bad, but definitely not worth putting myself through that experience. Frustrated, exhausted, and still kind of hungry, they asked for the check, which was brought to us with the district manager's card tucked inside, as though our waitress KNEW we had had a terrible time but wasn't going to say anything about it. We were about to pay it when we realized they'd charged me for the michelada I never got, as well as the drink they did make me. Funny enough, they knew how to spell michelada but not how to make it. We pointed this out and she took the check back to fix it. Again.... surprise, surprise.... no apology whatsoever. What a nightmare. I'm going to strongly discourage anyone I know from coming here again.

We're from Jamaica and back home they alter the seasoning and taste of the food to our tastebuds which makes it taste so good. The service is probably the same as the previous reviews of this TGI as well as all the other TGIF I looked up on yelp throughout the states. So the service experience wouldn't be new but surprising for being in the US. So we were prepared for anything. When we got here the place was pretty empty so we put in our name for a table and the hostess says 15-20 minute wait. I thought how what why? It's empty. Anyway we didn't complain cuz we expected it. 5-10 minutes later she said our table is ready. So they under promised and over delivered which was good. Then they seated us in a booth. I must say they could do a refurnishing of their both chairs. There was a big rip on booth seats in our booth and when I looked around other booths seamed to have them too. I guess this would be my only complaint of the night. Our waitress happened to be someone we knew through a friend so I'm not sure if this made the review rating higher for us but we got really good service even though we are acquaintances. Our orders were correct and the food came out within an appropriate time from ordering. So here's what we ordered: - The Potstickers for appetizers. It was my first time having potstickers. They were good. - The Jack Daniel Ribs (our reason for coming). We were a little disappointed by the size of the ribs cuz you know this America and everything comes large but this time it was the right portion to be honest. But it's ribs!! We want a nice 18in length rib! Haha but it was really good. The flavour was good and it was so soft and tender that the meat fell right off the bone as u bit it. - The Fried Shrimp. This was good too. It was seasoned well and the shrimp was still very soft and big from being fried.  Drinks: I ordered the Berry Sangria which I recommend and my boyfriend had the Tropical Long Island Tea but he didn't like it so much. It wasn't very strong with liquor for him but he did like the regular Long Island Tea. So we came here with low expectations and ended up getting a good experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston
Nicky F.,"New York, NY",257,141,462,2.0,6/4/2016,"Came here to try their new Brunch menu. The restaurant is generally pretty clean with waitresses who don't really seem to know what they're doing. They seemed busy all the time. The service is extremely slow and the waiter doesn't even offer us water once we sat down. The food is also prepared at an extremely slow rate - 45 minutes for waffles and fries. Around 15 minutes for a cup of bloody marry and some skewers. Our waiter, which I think his name was Tinto, was really nice though. I spilled my drink and he offered us another one without charging us. The nicest employee there. So for food: 1. Fried chicken waffles - It was good, the sauce is pretty unique (maple syrup with some spiciness in it)  2. Potato skins brunch - it was horrible, tasteless, we couldn't even finish it 3. Some boba pop drink - super sour, doesn't taste anything like coconut juice 4. Bloody marry + skewers- pretty cool presentation, drink was alright Overall, wouldn't come back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston

The place was pretty empty so we were promptly seated.

Ken S.,"Boston, MA",0,4,,1.0,10/16/2014,"I ordered the sirloin (with garlic butter) well done and double french fries. When my food arrived, it was apparently the Angus sirloin not the garlic butter sirloin. It came with a sauce I didn't want, which spilled on the fries. The steak was so burned that I thought it was coated with the sauce so I sent it back. The bartender brought the same steak back without the side of sauce, so I bit into the steak and it was too charred to eat. So I politely asked that they do it over. The bartender said in a friendly tone, ""Why don't you munch on the fries while we redo that for you."" I thought, ""Okay, that's nice, he's trying to make this a little better by giving me some fries while I wait."" I nibbled a little on the fries, but I really didn't just want a plate of fries without the steak, especially because they did not season the fries at all.  I would have asked them to just do the steak medium well, but I had just eaten here two nights earlier, ordered the same thing, and it was WONDERFUL. So I simply waited to see what would happen. When the bartender came back with just a piece of meat on an empty plate and no new fries to replace the ones that had gotten cold while I waited, I knew that it was time to give up on this experience altogether. I choked down the new piece of steak (which was still overcooked and bone dry because they still didn't include the garlic butter topping) and the cold french fries, and I left exactly a 15 percent tip (when I usually tip 20 to 25). No one asked me ""how was it?"" because as far as I could tell, no one gave a damn. I've been to this Fridays at least six times in the last year, and this was the worst visit I ever had.

I have been yelping & am starting to wonder if these restaurants look at these reviews. Next time I will ask them. Anyways, my friend invited me & my daughter (2 yrs old) out to dinner last night. I already knew what I wanted to drink. I wanted the Lemon Twist Martini...its a blue drink & very sweet, I love sweet drinks. Come to find out, they discontinued it and now only have the pink cotton candy. First off, I wanted a buzz and it tasted like straight juice. & not the good kind of drink that is sweet and juicy and sneaks up on you later on with a surprise!! NO, it was juice. Tre' disappointed. Anyways, the food made up for the sucky drink. We have stars and stripes card and got free chips and salsa for starters. I ordered the 3 course meal for 16.99 & it was a good deal. Our waiters name was Matt. He was very busy and a little disoriented. After I polished off my drink, i ordered a sprite and he took forever and a day to bring it to me, I was parched and sadly had to drink some of my daughters cranberry juice. I ordered the fried green beans & barely finished them. I was too busy snacking on my daughters chicken finger and fries kids meal. Meanwhile, im already full. I ordered the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta which was delish and surprisingly came with lots of meat & seafood, could barely finish it but its my lunch today. My friend even gave me her jalapeno cornbread and it complimented my spicy pasta even more, a great combo of sweet, savory, & spicy. I finally got my sprite towards the end of my meal & just had my dessert packed to go & still havent eaten it. But, for what is was worth it was a free meal. I got 24 points & I will be back.

Lenny B.,"Brookline, MA",0,2,,1.0,10/6/2011,"I came here earlier tonight with a few friends, and the experience was APPALLING.  The waitress (I would call her out, but I didn't get her name) came to get our orders, took a seat at an adjacent table, and looked in each person's direction as we were ordering. Fine, maybe she was tired...our orders were not complicated, and we ordered a sandwich to go, which we requested to be ready at the end of our meal. Simple enough...right?  About 10 minutes later, our food comes out. Two of my friends ordered burgers and both of them were incorrect. The first didn't have onion rings or peppers (as described in the menu), and the other had cheese on it, although my friend asked for no cheese. I ordered the cajun shrimp and cajun pasta, which I was under the impression was spicy (based on the waitress asking me, ""you like spicy, right?), but the sauce did not even have a hint of spice...it was almost an alfredo sauce. OK, whatever, not that big of a deal. My friends call the waitress, who all of a sudden has a major attitude. She takes the burgers back.....and in about 5 minutes, she returns. She literally slams a small plate of peppers onto the table (shouldn't they belong ON the burger?), hands my friend her cheese-less burger, and places another small plate of black rings onto the table.  Let's focus on the black rings...It took us a couple of seconds to figure out that these black rings were the onion rings that were supposed to come with the first burger. I am so shocked, I'm on the verge of walking out of the restaurant. How could they serve this at a restaurant? What an INSULT! We ask to speak to the manager, who when we show her the rings, has the audacity to say, ""oh, those are cajun onion rings....well, I guess they do look a little burnt."" WHAT?! CAJUN? Those rings weren't cajun...they were 100% burnt!  At this point, I've lost most of my appetite and I'm unable to finish my meal. The waitress does not return once to refill our glasses. She is rude and completely UNPROFESSIONAL. Worst service I've experienced in my 25 years of life....We quickly ask for our check, and of course, she takes her sweet time to return. Oh, and thankfully, she forgot about the to-go sandwich..... So, in summary, come here if you want horrible service and crappy, burnt food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=100

I tried to get ball head and dingy shirt's attention... ""hi excuse me"" in a pleasant tone and they both just looked up and kept moving. I asked to clean off the bar area in front of us and he came back minutes later, not with a damp towel, but with an ashy hand. Can you say gross. We ended up just going to the Cheesecake Factory where it was clean, the staff were friendly, welcoming and the food was delicious. I don't recommend this place at all, unless your seriously looking for a cheap bite and even still go to a different location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=100
Alex S.,"Portland, OR",93,139,13,3.0,12/13/2009,"Your going to one of those ""flare"" chains so your expectations have to be in line. If you are like me and ever worked in a chain like this you know that pretty much all the food was frozen 20 minutes before it arrived on your plate via the deep frier. That being understood, this place isn't half bad. The Fridays menu is relatively diverse. I have eaten there twice and both times there has been nothing wrong with the food. It has come out quick but not immediately and the servers have seemed accommodating and put a good effort into good service (both times they have brought out soft drink refills before we had to ask and always been near by when we needed something) This place is able to accommodate groups well and has surprisingly good beer deals ($2.50 for bud lights) so it is a good place to go for after work drinks with coworkers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=100
Ro P.,"Boston, MA",5,98,,4.0,2/16/2012,Lunch special is amazing value for money. Don't go here if you're trying to cut down on the calories. But for what it is...it's perfect.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=100
anne t.,"West Springfield, MA",0,22,1,5.0,7/21/2011,I wanted to give props to this chain restaurant. I had a great meal and service was phenomenal.. Thanks Alex !!! I like that they change their menu kid friendly and fun atmosphere,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=100
Jason R.,"Allston, MA",4,34,22,2.0,2/24/2011,"I love how there is some sort of mentality that screams chain restaurants are bad and should be avoided. This is not always the case; there are plenty of decent chains out there. This is not the case with TGI Fridays of Mission Hill. I for one feel that chain restaurants should offer some sort of consistency, and that is just what this restaurant offers, consistency. But is it the good kind? ""Eek, methinks not"". I am not sure what people are expecting when they come here. It isn't The Capitol Grill, yet some people try and treat it that way. Nevertheless, I for one,  will not be returning. I had been craving a Jack Daniels burger for some time. I had found myself in the area, so I decided to stop by for some lunch with my girlfriend. The hosted sat us immediately, and pointed out their new drink section of the menu and explained that our server would be over shortly. This is where the good experience ends.  After placing our drink order for soft drinks, we were given a few minutes to decide what we wanted to get.  I ordered the Jack Daniels burger, and my girlfriend ordered the Jack Daniels fried shrimp with sweet potato fries. We had an upcharge for them, but we didn't mind. We had been out looking at apartments all morning, and started to discuss everything that we had seen. While we were talking, a lady in the next booth over from us turned around and asked us if our waiter had been over yet. We answered yes, but then suddenly realized how long we had been talking for, about 20 minutes. So we had been waiting 20 minutes for fried shrimp and a burger. Keep in mind that this was lunch, with only a couple other occupied tables around us. Almost on cue, our waiter swung through and dropped off a silverware rollup for my girlfriend. But none for me. I supposed I don't need to use a napkin or anything while I eat lunch. I was just expecting to resort to my childhood habits of using the back of my hand. About a minute later, our food arrived. I immediately knew something was wrong when I looked at my burger. Wilted lettuce, dried cheese, and soggy fries. This is the telltale sign that something was left in a food window for a bit too long. To say I was put off would be an understatement. Why would you even present something like that to a guest at your restaurant and expect the situation to turn out ok. While I was examining my burger, another waitress walked by with a plethora of silverware rollups, which my girlfriend skillfully snagged one of. Her shrimp were crispy, and hot. Her sweet potato fries were crisp and warm. As far as presentation goes, well... they were all just tossed on the plate, there isn't much to it. I was able to grab the manager when she walked by and she offered to have my burger remade. Not a problem! This time around, it took about 5-7 minutes, and arrived just how it should have. I'll be honest with you, it actually looked like the picture in the menu. The frozen-burger-patty-turned-Med-Rare-meal was hot and juicy. The peperjack cheese was melty, and the bacon was smoky. I found the lettuce and pickles to be crisp. My fries were well seasoned, crispy and hot. The Jack Daniels sauce was sweet, with just a hint of that mellow, charcoal filtered goodness. On top of that, she comped both burgers off my bill so I wouldn't have to pay for my meal. I was very grateful and expressed my gratitude. I don't care if you are a chain or not, when you problems are recognized, it makes the world a better place.  All in all, I suppose I got the experience that I was expecting. The service lived up to it's notoriety, as being bad. You might get the impression that this is where someone would start their serving career, learning the ins and outs, along with the do's and don'ts. The food was just ""meh"". I have no idea why I was craving TGI Fridays so bad, but I can assure you that that craving has ceased, and will likely never return again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=100
John B.,"Boston, MA",0,5,,1.0,4/1/2011,"I phoned the restaurant at 5:35 to place an order to go. I was placed on hold for 5 minutes. Thinking that they had forgotten me, I hung up, and called again. I was once again placed on hold for an additional 15 minutes. I was very disappointed with the way that this occurred. I was expecting it to be busy at the restaurant when I got there, but much to my surprise, it was almost completely empty with 3 people standing at the front podium, cleaning and organizing the podium. This is very alarming and disturbing to me that the employees would rather waste someone's time and cell phone minutes leaving them on hold when there were numerous other people there that could be of assistance. The employee (Monica) was standing at the front door smoking and blocking one of the doors (because it was raining out) maybe this is why I had to be on hold for so long. I overheard the person in charge of the podium say to another associate that Monica was manning the take-out counter by herself, and if she needed help she would ask for it. This is very poor management and ignorant to the fact that she has no idea what is going on right in front of her own eyes. There were a total of 2 orders when I got there, and they tried to give me the incorrect order. It just seems like the employees there have no idea how to work as a unit, were not properly trained, and honestly do not care about the customers in general. I will not be re-visiting this restaurant in the future even though I live 2 mins away. I would rather drive half an hour out of my way then have these ignorant employees waste my time again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=100
Tom M.,"Roxbury, MA",8,52,,4.0,5/29/2009,"The food is greasy and the food really is not specatcular, but the beer is actually the cheepest on the hill, the staff is great and entertaining. They have the nfl sunday ticket so you can see your team play too. The one bartender (now manager...tear) Laura is hands down one of the best people in the service industry. She is trully the reason why I keep going back there, because she goes the extra length to make sure your Friday's experience is more than just going to Friday's. The rest of the staff is amazing too, just had to Yelp about how great LTB (Laura the bartender) is. I recommend hitting this place up, and giving it the title of second best resteraunt in bringham circle (Flann's is always my number 1, The Pig is third and Penguin is fourth) Dont let it just be ""Fridays"" fool you, this is better than your average Friday's.  Also they have outdoor seating when it is nice out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-boston?start=100
