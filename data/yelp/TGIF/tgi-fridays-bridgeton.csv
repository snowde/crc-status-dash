Kevin Y.,"Toronto, Canada",25,112,201,1.0,10/8/2017,"Absolute fail! Turned up at the Crowne Plaza due to a canceled flight and put up thereby the airline. Had a $15 voucher for dinner which the front desk took. I asked about the voucher for dinner to which the man behind the counter said ""just tell them you have that voucher from your airline (Even though I did not have the physical voucher). Bartender at TGIF said he'd check with the front desk and said everything seemed fine so he charged me for my meal minus the $15 to be absorbed by the airline. In the morning my complimentary room had a charge for $15 on the room bill!  I had to work this out with the front desk before rushing to the waiting shuttle.

Ritz L.,"Plano, TX",97,196,259,4.0,5/16/2017,"I was in St Louis on business and this restaurant was very close to where I was staying.  I don't necessarily like TGIF prior to this visit and I've only been to one near my residence couple of times and I wasn't very familiar with their menu before. I was able to take a good look at the menu this time and learned that there are so many things that I'm able to eat(I don't eat meat, but I eat certain type of fish occasionally). I ordered Black beans and Avocado(they were out of Avocado, so it was black bean burger)burger. I got a side Caesar salad instead of fries(I'm trying to be good!)I chose Strawberry and passion fruit tea for drink(very refreshing and lightly sweet with lemon wedge and slices of strawberries. My burger was good though kind of messy, LOL! It had mayo with Tabasco sauce and Jack Cheese, so it had the kick to it. My server was friendly and accommodating. It was a good dining experience. I think I will start going to TGIF to eat more often now that I have things I can eat there and the food is very decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton

Drinks ran out before we got our food and even had to ask for another drink. Food came out about 45 minutes later and was cold but didn't send back cause we figured it would be another hour before we got it. I don't care if they gave away food here, I wouldn't go.

Brian M.,"Houston, TX",111,416,5,2.0,12/13/2016,"Unlike others here, my experience with this TGI Fridays was that the service dragged the visit down so far that the food couldn't recover it. It started with my server. She was wearing a hoodie, T-shirt and jeans. I didn't even know she worked there -- she looked like she was headed out on a Walmart run. It wasn't until she asked me ""table for how many?"" that I put it together. I thought she was just saying hi to be friendly. The server came by to take orders, then disappeared. I had to flag someone down to get my check after about 10 minutes of waiting after I finished my meal.  The food was typical TGI Fridays -- solid, dependable, but nothing special to write home about. I knew what I was in for and I wasn't mat at the food. But servicewise, this is a definite two-star experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton

Austin S.,"Arvada, CO",107,477,1740,3.0,10/15/2016,"Not a lot of nearby food. Down the road a bit but in this area two or three things. Late night or until midnight most nights. But if you are driving and want food just keep going.  Service is fine. It's about as great as the nearby IHOP but I give this three stars because they have alcohol. Service greatly differs. Sitting at the bar you are likely to get better service. Definitely a step above Applebees but I think Chili's is king with Applebees at the bottom and TGI Friday's steadily holding down the middle. Distant from Chili's but certainly a great deal better than Crapplebees. (I digress) Hosts usually tell you it's a super long wait because they don't want to be bothered. Servers don't want to see you. Like I said sit at the bar and be polite. Tip well and leave. Can walk in from the Crowne Plaza lobby side but the parking lot, validate your parking while inside the restaurant, is adjacent the freeway.  Fries and a burger are what I generally get. Wish you had more fries. More flavor even. Burger is decent. Usually just get a bunch of cheap bud lights and dip. Meh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton

Rusty L.,"Cincinnati, OH",146,2,,1.0,4/12/2017,"1.

This was just looking at 2 of the 4 areas that I could see.  4. One of the two hostesses was not interested in doing her job as shown by her use of her personal cell phone at the hostess stand 5. People were seated out of order. Meaning on the list there was a 2 person party and a 3 person party. The 3 person party was on the list first, but the 2 person party was seated instead as they were friends with the hostess. The table sat 4 people.  6. A manager was asked for, but was informed that s/he wouldn't come to speak to me  7. I had to pay to park here and not be served or be able to eat.  8.

Mark B.,"Venice, FL",57,64,58,1.0,6/11/2017,"Like many of the other reviews here, on yelp, trip advisor, etc, this Friday's location suffers from neglectful oversight and management.  It is dirty, has slow service all around, and the food is mediocre.  It only has business as a result of being in the hotel so guests don't have other choices or they don't want to walk next to the Home Depot were there are other close by choices much better.  My advice is skip this location which does not meet the TGI Fridays standards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton
Harold S.,"Phoenix, AZ",4,262,189,2.0,3/1/2017,"So this is the problem with chains. Same menu and service is hit or miss depending on the staff. Tonight it's a miss and it seems to be a constant miss. The server takes my order as I yell it across the bar. The place is not super busy at all, however everyone is acting like they are in the weeds. Now the food, what should be hot is cold, and as usual, what is being offered is a majority of heat and eat. Also other orders are coming out wrong, so in general the other posts thy you read here are spot on.

Amanda G.,"Mauston, WI",58,1,,1.0,7/16/2016,"Was sat directly next to an open door leading to a cold pool area. It was extremely uncomfortable. When asked if we could move we were told it was ""crowded"" when we passed four tables that could have sat our party of 5. The solution was then to close the door which inconvenienced the staff who needed to frequently go in and out with food and it was extremely cold about every minute when they did so.  It's disappointing because as a customer who also is familiar with the food service industry it seemed as if the rotation was more important than our comfort.  Whether it was the manager or the hostess who made the decision to close the door and not move us to one of the several open tables, it was definitely not the right call.  Also everything we ordered that had sauce or dressing was insanely over dressed.  Overall extremely disappointing experience and will likely not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton

I didn't think it mattered so I hesitantly obliged, only to find that at this particular TGI Fridays ""bar area"" is apparently code for ""bad service area"". The waiter was really slow despite the fact that the restaurant was not busy, but what was more disturbing was the fact that he was just rude. Every request was treating like I was asking for the world. I ordered a Cesar salad to start and an entree, but they both arrived at the same time. I'm not sure who told them what they are serving is a Cesar salad, but they were wrong.

Brent W.,"Hazelwood, MO",7,12,10,1.0,5/21/2013,"I actually like TGI Friday's as a chain but this one is definitely the worst of the lot. I have come to this location probably about 5 times in the 8 years I've lived close to it and it has always been a terrible location. Everything about Friday's is off here. Usually a hostess greets you at the door, I have only seen a hostess here once. Usually they try to hit you right off the bat with an alcoholic drink upsell, nope, not here, the server will generally get to you after you been waiting 10-15 minutes and just ask you what you want. Since they take so long to get to you they usually just take your meal order then too. After I get my drink, I'll generally never see my waiter again (someone else always drops off the food) until he or she drops off the check. Seriously, it is a service industry, these people work for tips, why does this location have such terrible service? I've been to the Friday's in Creve Couer and St. Charles and neither of those locations suffer from this same lack of service. It is definitely the worst of the bunch and I hope it goes out of business even though it is the closest Friday's to me by about 20 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton?start=40

Waited an additional 10 minutes for drinks. 25 more minutes for cold food... Complained about food not being right or good. Sent back for a new rare burger some how that took 20 minutes... Burger came out fresh but covered in oil same with bun fries were old.. Food was terrible complained and the GM was rude and didn't have time to listen to me. He said he would take care of the bill we sat there for 5ish more minutes no one came by I went and found my waiter and tipped him. Then asked the lady at the front how to contact corporate she went back got the GM his first response was you still have to pay your check!! We assumed that everything was so crappy that he took care of the check.. He was rude and embarrassed us in front of other customers... We paid the bill and they still charged us for the burger then I showed my waiter he said he took the first one off and he had to get approval from the GM to take off a burger that we didn't even eat...  The GM (Story) said fine but she will have to wait as he went into the kitchen... I stood by the kitchen doors for 5 minutes then instead of refunding the difference they charged me again and voided the old ticket..... This place doesn't even disserve 1 star.....

BG N.,"Decatur, IL",4,38,,1.0,5/12/2013,"Save Yourself... Avoid this TGI Friday location! I usually leave reviews of the places I enjoy and just leave a bad experience behind me giving the benefit of the doubt to the Resturant that maybe it was simply an off day.  NOT this time!   Very poor service!

Jasmine C.,"Saint Louis, MO",15,3,,1.0,9/20/2013,"In all my years (24 lol), I have never gone to a restaurant where they forgot to put in my order!  I came to this location out of convenience, as I would normally visit the downtown location. When I arrived, we were seated in the back in a cramped, 2-seat booth, despite there being plenty of other tables available. Nonetheless, we ordered an appetizer, sirloin, ribs, and a burger (Stripes reward); I had plenty of questions regarding our meal options since I was redeeming Stripes rewards. After people who arrived after us were receiving their food, I started to wonder where our plates were since we already received the appetizer we ordered. The waitress came to our table to check on the appetizers, asked us if we wanted alcoholic drinks, etc. When I discovered they do not offer the $3 drinks like the other locations, we stuck with our already placed food order.  After 20 mins, she came back to our table empty handed asking whether we wanted to order something else or were we just ordering the appetizer. What?! I couldn't believe she was asking, and we told her we already placed our order. I asked her whether she put the order in and she stated yes (obviously lying), that she was just checking, which made no sense. After a few minutes, the manager comes and tells me he will give me a discount because she got preoccupied and didn't place my order. Can you believe we still waited on the order? I think I waited because I already had a free burger on the bill so everything else would have been pretty cheap lol. Even after they placed the order, it took them another 15 mins to bring the food out, and my steak was bloody on the plate, which I requested medium-well. Still being patient and level-headed surprisingly, I let them take the steak to be re-fired. After waiting another 10 minutes, I left $5.78 on the table, exact change for the appetizer with the discount, and walked out the door.

Christina P.,"Centralia, IL",1,13,22,1.0,1/19/2015,I would literally give this place zero stars if that were an option.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AT THIS LOCATION!!  My family usually loves TGI Fridays and was excited to see one close to our hotel when staying near the airport. First of all there is no convenient access and the parking ticket machine was having issues.  We go into the restaurant and wait 10 minutes. We were not greeted. My husband points out the table next to us had to hunt someone down to pay his bill. We then decided the service was going to be way too awful as we STILL had not been greeted.  I went to get my parking ticket stamped so I wouldn't have to pay for parking and found a manager. He was obviously working harder than his servers because he was bussing and cleaning tables.  I told him we were leaving because we had not been greeted in over 10 minutes. I've worked in a restaurant myself for 7 years and our policy was always the guest must be greeted within 1 minute.

My husband got up and saw our drinks sitting on the bar. Right after that, his beer was brought to the table, but not my cocktail. Again, the place was not packed so I don't think there was any reason not to be able to get our drinks to us in a timely matter.   Finally got the drinks squared away and ordered our food. I got the Korean tacos and my husband got a steak with potatoes and veggies. My tacos were pretty good but the tortilla shells were tough. Flavor was really good. My husbands steak was cooked more than medium, but it had a wonderful sauce and blue cheese on top, so the flavor helped. We had already been there long enough, we didn't want to complain about the food and have to wait longer.     I would say the experience wasn't awful, but we will try a different TGI Friday's location next time and see if it is better.

And where are the seasoned TGI Friday fries I remember being so good? I got a double order of cold, plain, and tasteless fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton?start=20
Dan M.,"Sioux Falls, SD",1,258,,1.0,9/29/2015,"Wow. Hard to know where to start. Probably with the horrible smell that hits the second you walk in. But that only sets the tone for the what's to come. The service here is horibble. The attitude of the bartenders is a complete buzz kill. While one bartender screwed up orders and ""refused"" to deliver food because it was not her job, the other one kept throwing away bottles of booze that were getting low and bragging about how her manager was going to be pissed. Followed by patron after patron complaining about their bills being incorrect. I'm not sure if TGI Friday's is having a contest to see which of their restaurants is the worst, but it would appear that the team at this location is really going for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton?start=20

Cory S.,"Saint Charles, MO",0,2,,1.0,2/1/2017,We went here for lunch on a sunday. They were not busy at all. It took them 30 min to seat the 6 of us even tho there was alot of open tables. The table they sat us at was dirty after all that time and on top of that the staff is rude as can be. Our server never once refilled our empty cups and it took them over 45 min to give us our food and ever brought out the appetizers after the food. It was terrible and i will never go back to this location. Do your self a favor and drove a few extra minutes to st charles or the one on s Lindbergh.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton?start=20
CK T.,"Saint Paul, MN",523,152,1673,2.0,4/13/2014,"Probably the worst TGI Friday's I've been to. Crap service. Crap food. Their mini appetizers are well... mini. A few bites and you're done with their $15 special. The only good thing about the place is the selection of IPA Beers.

Sam T.,"Rockledge, FL",0,22,26,2.0,2/26/2015,"The other poor reviews are spot here. This location was close to our hotel, so we tried it. The service was poor. 32 minutes went by between seating and being greeted by our server for a drink order. Even though everyone ordered simple entrees with no modifications, 3 of 6 orders came out with errors. We were one of two tables for our server, yet she frequently walked by us to converse with the other table, clearly friends of hers.  That said, food tasted good and was on par with other TGIFRIDAYS.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton?start=20
Theresa B.,"Brevard, FL",3,9,8,5.0,10/19/2016,"I was reluctant to eat here because of the reviews.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and the service. Our waitress Crystal, was phenomenal!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton?start=20
Nikki D.,"Saint Louis, MO",19,20,,1.0,7/16/2016,"came in and immediately the entire hostess staff was standing around chatting. the restaurant had a plethora of empty tables, and we were finally escorted to the very back, near an open door that led to a pool and fountain in the hotel. we passed several empty tables that could have sat our party of 5- and because it was so cold i asked our waitress if we could move to another table somewhere away from the door.  after being told that they were very crowded tonight, which wasn't true, she left and came back with the solution to close the door. which might have been useful if the entirety of the wait staff didn't have to come in and out of the door to serve the people that were out there. the wait staff was obviously aggravated by having to do this and at times it took two of them to even get in and out of the door.  every time the door opened, we were hit with a gust of freezing air. i had to ask for my side of ranch three times. when our appetizers and salad were served we weren't given any silverware or plates and had to wait, all of the food with sauce and dressing was soaked. the entirety of the experience was just awful and it felt like waiter rotation was more important than our comfort. i will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton?start=20
Courtney L.,"Saint Louis, MO",94,26,1,2.0,1/19/2015,"This is my second time coming to this location and I refuse to go back. Our first experience here we ended up taking our entire dinner home because of such bad service. Last night we tried this location again. First- I order a berry shaker alcoholic drink.. The first one didn't even come in the shaker? Second- we didn't get our appetizer plates until half way done with our appetizer. Third- my steak was supposed to be medium well.. It was definitely well done. Our server also spilt the plates on the table and it made a lot of noise. I'm a server myself, so I still tipped $10, which wasn't well deserved but I refuse to come back to this location and from now on I will drive the twenty minutes to the other one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton?start=20
Barbara W.,"Saint Ann, MO",22,26,1,1.0,3/11/2016,Went in last night for a dinner with the family.  Waited 10 minutes to be greeted.  Then another 10 minutes for her to come back with drinks.  After she dropped off the drinks she disappeared again and didn't take our order.  I told the host we needed to order. Our server walked around like she was on her own time and not once said anything about taking so long.  After we ordered we waited 20 minutes and then asked where our food was she said it would be another 15 minutes.   Needless to say we canceled our order and left.  This place wasn't that busy and I can't believe a manager didn't come over to apologize for our wait.   If I want Friday's I will drive the extra few miles to the one in creve couer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton?start=20
Kristine S.,"Pewaukee, WI",0,2,,2.0,11/4/2016,The server was very friendly but service was very slow.   Forgot to put in our order for an appetizer.   Food came and only got 3 out of 4 meals.  Had to wait for 4th meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton?start=20
Todd G.,"Montgomery, OH",0,2,,1.0,4/4/2016,"The service at this location is non existant. Especially considering the place was no more than a third full. Waited 15 minutes before a server came to my table Ordered a Flat  bread appetizer and waited 30 minutes for it. When it arrived, itwas barely cooked and flavorless. The entree salad was another 30 minutes and it was ok at best.  And waited another 20 minutes for our Check. I noticed other patrons looking around for their servers and one got up from her table to track her down.  An established chain restaurant such as Friday's should have its act together",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgeton?start=20
