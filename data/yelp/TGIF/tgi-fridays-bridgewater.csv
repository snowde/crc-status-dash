Nick M.,"Warren, NJ",3,46,15,5.0,3/27/2016,"Great place to go for drinks after work.  Went with a friend last Wednesday night at about 10:45 pm. Had some beer and wine and mozz sticks. Hung out till 12:30, they are open till 1am,  was a good place for quiet conversation and to be  left alone to talk in peace. Had a basketball  game on TV's so no one can hear your conversation, which is a plus... makes those after work nights fun, especially for folks in retail working till 9PM......LOL",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=20
Kristin R.,"Middlesex, NJ",11,96,44,2.0,8/12/2016,Update: this location is still gross! It's mid August and it felt as though they barely had their AC on because it was so stuffy where I sat.

Robbie P.,"Manville, NJ",23,33,3,4.0,4/1/2017,"I ate here this Friday for lunch, and it was an excellent meal. I came for endless apps with my girlfriend and our friend. Our waitress was very kind, and prompt with drinks, and refills. There have been a few times here I haven't been so lucky. I tried the three berry smoothie, it was delicious. The apps were mostly perfect. The chicken came out crunchy, and I got to try every flavor. The ""Jack Daniels"" bbq sauce is best on ribs which are not part of the endless deal. The mozzarella sticks were warm and flavorful (I think they changed their recipe because the motz of the last endless deal were terrible). The loaded potatos were good, but best saved for last due to their ability to fill you up, and they can be a little dry which makes them harder to finish. The flat breads were disappointing with only two small bits of chicken for the four pieces they gave, so two pieces had no chicken. Overall I was more than happy with the food, and our awesome waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=20

M C.,"Dayton, NJ",0,26,22,1.0,3/20/2016,"Friday night service was terrible. The waitresses could not care any less for being there or for serving the customers. They treated us as if we were getting in their way of whatever they were doing. The food was poorly prepared, the table settings were incomplete, and the glasses were all crusty. The Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta was too salty and the pasta was under cooked. But then again what was I trying to expect from a place like this.

S B.,"New York, NY",0,12,3,1.0,2/23/2016,"Long wait to be acknowledged, another 10 min for server to bring drinks (he had to reask what we ordered), we asked for extra sauce but it wasn't brought out until  after we were done with appetizer... All excusable, it happens.  When we ordered. I asked for the sauce on the side  for the burger (chow chow sauce?- what is that, anyway?) The kitchen brought it out twice with sauce on the burger. Twice.  When I told the server they put sauce on the burger again, he said, ""sh!@"" in front of me and my family (which included my 8 year old). At that point I thought a manager should know about the service / experience, but when I approached her, she was running her hands through a servers hair in the kitchen while her and another manager were laughing and joking!! I explained to her that while her dining room was falling apart she was in there fooling around, which she replied, ""I just got here"". She then came to my table and said ""there is no excuse why I had my hands on her hair, BUT I was telling her to pull her hair back""  Although she did try to make things right by comping our food, in all honesty, I would have rather paid for the service and food that was expected to begin with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=20

Jackie C.,"Kissimmee, FL",18,36,37,3.0,1/29/2015,It's sad because I used to love Fridays. So I have this childhood memory of amazing food and fun service that doesn't exsist at Fridays. If you are looking for some appetizers and a run of the mill meal u came to the right place. The portions are small the sides are bland(I had to ask for extra seasoning) and the beloved chicken fingers are a new recipe and they are very salty! As for dessert the desserts were lacking in sweetness. They were ok but not amazing just like the whole dining experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=20

The place wasn't packed for lunch either so i really don't understand. I ordered the Slizzing Chicken Cheese which I get all the time and sadly not slizzing when it came out. I assume the waiter put to he order in with the appetizer so it must've been sitting. Or just simply the lack of attentiveness. It also seems like they updated the menu or messed up my order because it came out with double mashed potatoes instead mashed potatoes and veggies. They do have a home made lemonade which was good for my lemonade loving self.  Overall I'm not excited about TGIF as a whole, it's a chain restaurant with just okay food.

Melissa S.,"Flemington, NJ",149,71,361,4.0,7/23/2017,"This Friday's has recently changed their happy hour specials to only apply to drinks. They took away the happy hour food options.  The only discounted food available was the endless apps option.  Even though they advertise the endless apps deal at $10 per person on television, this Friday's location charged $12 per person.  I sat at the bar.  The bar wasn't crowded and there were two bartenders on duty.  I ordered a $3 LIT and the endless apps for $12.  The pace for the endless apps was a bit slower than I preferred.  I felt like I had to chase down the bartenders to put in my next round and there was a lot of waiting in between. They used to give you a full app portion for Round 1 and then half portions for each refill, but this time even the first round was only a half portion.  I'm disappointed with the changes this location has made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater

Lauren W.,"Brooklyn, NY",77,224,77,2.0,5/15/2017,"Even though my order was wrong, the food here was good. I ordered the bourbon barrel salmon and received the grilled salmon. The grilled salmon, with rice pilaf and spinach, was tasty. My friend really enjoyed her parmesan-crusted chicken, with mac and cheese, and tomato and mozzarella salad. Entree serving sizes were appropriate for one person. We both ordered the Casamigos strawberry margarita, which was delicious. It was sweet and salty, and left you with a buzz after one glass.  Overall, I found pricing to be expensive.  Service was poor and extremely slow. Our waitress disappeared for long periods of time. We were not checked on. I had to get up and ask for cutlery after our food was served. Then, I had ask for plates to be cleared after they had been sitting in front of us empty for a long time.

Big mistake. There was no wait to be seated, but once again a long wait to be acknowledged.  Our server was pleasant enough but incompetent.  She ignored our empty glasses and plates, took forever to bring our food, and managed to take my fork and take her time replacing it.  As I write this it's been fifteen minutes since we asked for more pot stickers, and they just arrived.

Rico C.,"South Bound Brook, NJ",0,4,7,1.0,8/12/2017,I went here on Friday and it was absolutely terrible. I was seated right away but it took 30 minutes for someone to get to the table to ask if we wanted drinks. My friend and got our drinks 15 minutes after then we order endless apps and we got the first batch right away and then it took the sever 35 minutes before the server to get back and ask us if we wanted to put another set in but the entire time we waited we didn't get any refill on drinks. The next batch of endless apps didn't get to the table for another 30 minutes and by then it was 1 hour without any refill on drinks. When the server got to the table my friend asked for another beer and I asked for a water. The server returned fairly quickly but my glass of water had food that was on the glass. It was nasty at the at point we didn't eat any other food and just wanted the bill! It took the server 40 minutes to get back to the table so we could ask the server for the bill so we could pay and leave. This was the most terrible experience I've ever had! I wouldn't advise that your go here on a busy day because the servers here don't take care of you and it's so busy they can't wash the dishes right apparently!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater

Carefree and incompetent staff along with poor management skills! This location continues to decline and their lack of customer service makes it ever more so convincing.  Every time I palace a TOGO order it's always messed up! Today 2/22/17 I placed an order for lunch for my colleagues and I in the office around 2pm. First and foremost their online ordering was offline so we could not place an order online. I prefer this over calling in due to their lack of attention to details. Spoke with a guy who was at the bar Daniel? Who I had to repeatedly tell my order to as he was too incompetent to follow instructions or listen. Well you get what you deserve for attempting to give these idiots a 3rd chance. Got back to the office and everyone's lunch was in the bag EXCEPT for mine. I ordered a turkey burger, of course the bartender forgot to put my burger in the bag!!! When I called the response was ""I'm sorry, just come back in and grab it?"" Are you kidding me? This distasteful response was the same from the GM Tia, who lacks any proper management skills to handle the issue. The fact that these people are the ones chosen to run  this business, will end up running it into the ground.

We had a chicken dish and I had a turkey burger. The turkey burger was horrid, chewy and there were FAT pieces in the burger .. turkey burgers don't have fat pieces! I was annoyed at that (mind you that I'm already very hungry). The server never came back to check on us until we waved over the hostess to get our waiter!

It's a family place for people on a budget and who just want a fun time out where you can be loud and hang out. Nothing more, nothing less. The food and drinks there are both okay. Nothing special has ever made me feel good about the menu there, because it's just the regulars. They do have nice surprises on their menus, but the quality of the food always makes me shy away from having anything. Once I found out about how the food is prepared and comes frozen (which is typical for a franchise/chain) it just doesn't feel or taste great.  If you want a fun time and to just go out real quick, this obviously is a pretty cool place for that, but food wise, don't expect quality or quantity. Which if that's not your style or way you're looking for, then that's okay. No quality place does unlimited food for $10 lol But, enjoy.

It was upset slow tons of open tables). A hostess came and said she'd be right with us then vanished. Fast forward 10 minutes to when a manager came to seat us and we were told to ""hold on while he decided where to seat us"". Sit down took another solid 10-15 for waitress to come over at which point she just said she'd be with us soon (again not busy at allllll), a good half hour after we entered the door she finally got our drinks. (All in all she was lovely and NOT the problem). I told her I'm deathly allergic to fish/shellfish even if cross contaminated. And allergic to dairy. To which she said she'd get a manager (which I believe was the proper thing for her to do). It took 35 MINUTES for this manager to pay attention long enough to find things I could eat. Myself and my friend MULTIPLE times told him how bad my allergies are and he disappeared for a bit then came back and informed us he had spoken to the GM who was by the bar....so a GENERAL MANAGER doesn't feel the need to come handle this situation? I asked for rice and grilled chicken deciding that would be safest. Was told by the manager no to rice because they'd ""have to wash a pan"" are you freakin kidding me?!?!?  Food took another half hour to come out.

Andrew Lee H.,"Newark, NJ",23,46,38,4.0,9/8/2009,"Damn it feels good to go to a franchise everyone can agree on, especially if its just only me and that childhood friend who isn't solely to blame for our infrequent meetings.  We didn't need to go to some fancy Thai restaurant that happened to be closed between 3 and 5; we had spent enough time jerking-off over the girlies at the local mall, which had to be done to death a million times in our past lives and will never actually ever really die... it didn't matter that I devoured plenty of steaks, burgers, and hot dogs the previous day on Labor Day Saturday... and he didn't seem to be in too much of a rush with either mommy, wifey, or mpc-2000 begging him to come back home.  I think we were both trying to stay sober the whole day, but we indulged and made TGIF's fancier than that Thai restaurant with the help of some teenage-American waitressinging.  Well, I suppose this was just one of those medium-rare times you just chill-ax in and let the hi-hats ride out nicely... If there will ever be a time for me to recall having a good meal, I would not mind waiting for this one-hear beat to fade very, very slowlee.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=60
Brandon M.,"Somerville, NJ",0,53,,3.0,6/3/2010,"Not very good service, but their mozzarella sticks are the best I've ever had.  They make them flat, not round, so breading surface area is high relative to the amount of cheese - they're not too cheesy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=60

Amy M.,"Bethlehem, PA",2,96,28,5.0,9/19/2015,"TGIFs has done a great job of making great offerings and promos! Had the boneless buffalo and garlic parm chicken bites as part of their appy promo. Flavourful and meaty.  Hubby has the NY cheddar & bacon cheeseburger. Great quality, great tastes...very fresh! I had once again the Jack Daniel sliders...hey once you have a ""find"" you stick to it!  Lots will be going home to enjoy yet again. All was fresh because the staff were knowledgeable and quick!  Pat at the bar knew his product and really assisted us in our selection. Chelsea, with her friendly face, was very accomodating, steering us in the right direction, and delivered our libations. She went out of her way to make sure all our selections met our expections.  Danielle efficiently brought out our food order which we enjoyed thoroughly.

Laura S.,"Bedminster, NJ",1,41,,1.0,12/30/2014,"Went for my brothers Birthday for dinner. I ordered a steak with Langostino Lobster topping. The Steak came out and tasted and smelled like bad fish. My family also agreed with me the lobster was bad. The manager came out and said it came out of the freezer SUNDAY, and it's WEDNESDAY! He told me it was still fresh. NO WAY IS THAT FRESH! He was very cold, and not very friendly. My vegetables tasted awful. Everything was just awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=40
Jen F.,"Capitol Hill/Southeast, Washington, DC",0,4,,1.0,2/28/2016,"Sad place. Tables and walls are beat up, food in the floor under our table, straw wrappers wadded up in the menu. The choices on the menu are meh. Only the drinks and desserts look appetizing unless you want a burger.  My hubby had a burger, he said it was good but the small portion of fries were cold. I had a lunch salad which came with two tiny strips of chicken.  This used to be a good place for a decent quick lunch but I won't go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=40

Dan E.,"Branchburg, NJ",56,861,26,3.0,8/4/2013,I would have definitely thought I'd written a review for this place but I guess not.  I probably stop in a handful of times a year to grab some beers.  I'm not a huge fan of the food at Friday's so I usually just stick to the drinks.  I actually think this place has a pretty nice bar area.  Plenty of seating and there are a bunch of TV's to catch the game or whatever's on.  Bartenders are pretty attentive and friendly so you're rarely just sitting there waiting. This particular TGI Friday's has about 15 beers on tap which is a pretty good selection.  I'm pretty sure they have happy hour every day from 4-7 and that includes $2.50 Yuenglings so that makes me a pretty happy dude.  The beer is always ice cold so that's a plus.  I'll continue to stop in when I have a chance.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=40

Alexa F.,"Warren, NJ",0,3,,1.0,3/8/2015,"What a tragedy. I was a very strong fan of TGIF's but this particular location was terrible. The service is extemely unorganized and my family and I were very uncomfortable with the cleanness. Money is never an issue and neither is good food, but when the restaurant itself is disgusting than that is unacceptable. For example, tables should not be sticky when a family sits down. They should be cleaned properly or just don't clean it at all. The waitors, hostesses, and chefs should all be on the same page. There is no reason for situations like this to happen, especially in a very wealthy area. If there is going to be trashy people serving the people in the Bridgewater area, than I assure you they will not be in business for long. Reviews and the internet are a very powerful thing. Hopefully this is taken into consideration and there is a new staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=40
Karen S.,"Flemington, NJ",0,25,,2.0,11/7/2014,"Fridays has changed the menu again and not for the better.  Portions are much smaller and prices are higher.  Is this something new, that restaurants are cutting back on portions?  It will discourage dining out as you feel abused.  The food is not any better than McDonalds food and the portions are smaller. I had chicken/shrimp plate and my husband had steak/spinach --- very ordinary, bland food and small portions. Service was good; very nice waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=40
Jay B.,"Bridgewater, NJ",1,21,5,1.0,9/30/2013,"Beer that is on tap is always sub par, they definitely have unclean lines for them. Food quality is terrible at this TGIF location.

Johnnie M.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,26,,1.0,3/11/2015,"This place is the biggest p.o.s. ever, and it's too bad, it's right by our house. Food sucks, comes out cold, bartenders do not know how to make a drink, have no personality, but when their buddies show up, they get great service. This is for 20 year old airheads, all I heard was ""Oh my God"", and the word ""like"" over and over, ad nauseum. Kids today are stupid aholes. Place is dirty, no one gives a damn about service. I will write to the regional manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=40
Pete B.,"Hillsborough, NJ",1,26,,1.0,8/14/2012,"This place sucks so bad (and I used to work there!  and am by no means bitter - I liked working there!)... but I'll be honest.  The food is horrible quality.  I've given it multiple chances since my employement there (which was over a decade ago), with my family, and I've hated it every single time.  The only fairly safe bets are the appetizers (Jack Daniels tower, if they still have it), and maybe the burgers.  Actual dinner entrees though have always been cooked horribly and tasted horribly.  If you want to go to a mid-tier chain restaurant, check out Applebees - not sure about the one in Bridgewater, but the one down 206 in Hillsborough has gotten better and I wouldn't hesitate to try any of their entrees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=40
Jodi S.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",0,1,,5.0,3/21/2015,Bartenders are fantastic.  I always get great service with a smile.  They always start up a conversation with me showing that they care how I feel and how my day is going.  They care about their guests.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=40

Jessica C.,"Midlothian, VA",214,113,61,3.0,10/21/2010,"Look, it's a chain and it's affordable. You get what you pay for. They have awesome cocktail specials. Currently, they have a triple berry mojito that I could drink all day, every day (too bad there's no non-alcoholic version, as I'm not a big drinker.) The food is mediocre, but surely affordable. My favorite dish is the bruschetta chicken pasta, it has a balsamic glaze reduction drizzled on it that I absolutely love. I always get extra. I have not had good experiences with any of the steaks, the shrimp or the fajitas though. If I want fajitas, I'll go to Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=40

Colene B.,"Annandale, NJ",44,13,,1.0,1/29/2013,"This review is for FLEMINGTON My Daughter  and I went to Fridays in Flemington tonight, we sat on the couches for a drink and appetizer. Nobody came to take our order as promised so i went to the bar. Upon returning, i found lip marks on my glass, so I walked it back up. It happens. The bar tender placed the wine to the side and poured me a new one. I thought it was odd that she didnt dump the wine, and continued to watch. When I got back to the seat, we found pink lips on my daughers soda glass, so back up I went. The bar tender was talking to friends and didnt see me.. I saw her tho.. she wiped the lips from my old glass and placed it in the service bar area. When she came over, the manager was walking by, I told him what I saw, she overheard and quickly dumped the wine and denied it. Im not sure what was going on, but I will tell you, Im not going back to that filthy place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bridgewater?start=40
