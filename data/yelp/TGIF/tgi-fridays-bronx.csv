jin p.,"Flushing, NY",0,45,27,1.0,11/17/2017,Worst tgi Friday location ever. We ordered 2 lunch special pasta dishes (1 for 10.50. Other for 12.50) We waited 15 minutes for food and We finished our pasta in 20 seconds. Why?? The portion was crazy small amount. We complaint about portion and they said it is lunch portion. This restaurant management is gonna shut down soon. No one would come here for food and service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx
Jasmine L.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,2,1,1.0,10/20/2017,"I had to create an account just to explain how TERRIBLE the food quality is. I'm sitting at the table writing this review. I'm disgusted! Don't not come here. My wings were uncooked. The ""manager"" took them back and brought me back the same COLD, UNcooked food. This is after waiting 45 minutes. My sister and I ordered at 6:52pm. My cold and frozen food came at 7:20pm. All I got was wings and fries at this point her food has not arrived. She ordered the jack daniels chicken and shrimp. Yes. That should take a little longer. No one wants food poisoning.  Her food arrives at 8:15pm and it was wrong. This arrives after I went to the manager...directly. The same manager who brought me the uncooked food. She is trying to hush me at this point because I asked her if she even watched them give me a NEW order of food or just tossed it around in a hot pan. She looked at me like I had 5 heads and she was caught.  She gave me a half ass apology and said that she would go check on my sister's order and asks if I did the endless wings; I told her yes and are they going to be endlessly uncooked? She didn't go check on my sister's order.  As a matter of fact, she walked passed my table back and forth and didnt say didn't 1 word.  My server brings me MORE cold wings and a new  order for my sister its 8:30pm. The shrimp are RAW. HOW!? I been here since before 7pm. I should have walked right out the door. I am now and leaving this nasty ass food RIGHT here.   Oh. And they just ran out of glasses. I just saw a server dump the contents into a sink and refill it. He didn't even rise it. Shut this place. D O W N! I've been in food service my self and am qualified by NYS. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!  PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx

This restaurant was out literally everything we ordered and the items they DID have were disgusting! We all know this is no gourmet meal but who doesn't love a good fried green bean or artichoke dip but NOPE they were all out. Fine, I'll settle for some wings and potstickers...absolutely disgusting!

Alexsis A.,"Bronx, NY",114,53,27,2.0,11/26/2017,"This place has truly taken a long roll downhill. The service, food, and drinks are horrible. My last encounter at the Gun Hill location was extremely disappointing.  The server was amazing. He took our order and even gave a few suggestions. Next thing you know, someone brought the food out and he informed my table as well as the table directly next to us that he was no longer our server. The manager asked him to clock out early. We were so shocked and disgusted that we called her over to inquire. It was very unprofessional and such the interruption to our meals. But the problem stemmed from the kitchen not preparing our meals properly. The server attempted to resolve this issue with kitchen staff. And things spiraled out of control. The sad part is that the young man was completely courteous and committed to givingus the best experience. As a result, we left our food and paid the bill right away to ensure he received the tips.  The food was sub par and the drinks were watered down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx

Paula M.,"Bronx, NY",195,310,172,1.0,8/23/2016,"Wow. Horrible. Let's begin with the hostess. Didn't greet us at all, took us straight to the back, dropped the menus and walked away. Our waitress took 8mins to come over and greet us and take our order. My date ordered a beer and she had no clue what he was talking about so she told him to order something else lol. The food took 33-35mins to arrive, SWEAR and it was empty in this place!!!! There was 2 other tables across from us and they too had been waiting and making comments. One table seemed to be receiving the wrong items because they kept returning the food. Our waitress was all over the place, she seemed so overwhelmed with the 3 tables.

Tiffany L.,"Bronx, NY",9,23,6,1.0,7/10/2017,"Came here for the unlimited appetizers, and immediately ended up regretting it.  I ordered flatbread to start, and my boyfriend ordered some food off the menu. About 20 or so minutes later, his food came, but not my flatbread. So I asked the waitress, ""where's my flatbread?"" She then told me, ""oh, the kitchen just told me they ran out of flatbread."" So I'm like ii lemme get the mozzarella sticks and pot stickers. She comes out and is like, ""we don't have anymore pot stickers.""  By now, I'm just hangry as fuck, so I'm like, ""well, what do you have then?"" She goes, ""Mozzarella sticks and potato skins."" So I got that. An hour wasted already.  So after I FINALLY got my food, I ordered some wings, cause I was still hungry. The waitress came and cleared the table, taking away the dishes and my fork. How the hell am I supposed to eat with no fork? With my hands? We're not savages here, miss. Anyways, the bill came and to my surprise, I was charged $12 for food that I did not order nor eat. So I had to flag down the waitress, and wait 10 extra minutes for everything to be sorted out.  I learned my lesson. Never again. Not even for unlimited appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx
Dawn P.,"Ossining, NY",0,10,3,1.0,11/18/2017,"This is the worst Friday's ever!!! We went there last night and had the worst experience ever. We ordered drinks, never got straws. Took almost 20 minutes until the waitress came back to take our food order and give us some straws. We ordered an appetizer and then our entrees. The appetizer came out and we were pleased (chicken quesadillas) From the time the appetizer came out until the time my food came out we waited almost an hour! To make it worse my food had a HAIR in it and my fiancé's food never even came out. The waitress said at first his lobster tail was still on the grill and needed 4 more minutes. Then she came over to us 15 min later and said to be honest your food is ready but the steak looks really dry so I don't think you will want it. At that point my fiancé said keep the food, we will pay for our drinks and go somewhere else to eat. We were there for an hour and a half just to have a drink and appetizer. We will definitely not be returning to that location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx
Lissandra M.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,2,4,1.0,11/29/2017,"TGI Friday's was far off when it came to customer service and terrible food. The Chefs had put no Love with the menu items I have chosen. I have ordered an: Onion Soup (overly salty) I gave back the soup and was still charged for the soup as well, Jack Daniels Burger (served old lettuce), Mash Potato (overly salty). On top of the environment experience was okay. I have waited a decent amount of time to catch the waiter attentions for assistance. On top of that, receiving just a glass of water took over 20 to 30 minutes. I was really disappointed with this experience and on top of that I was dissatisfied with my food !

Stephanie M.,"Brooklyn, NY",108,42,80,1.0,5/6/2017,"""I'M SO SICK OF THIS SHIT!"" Don't worry, I'll explain later.  If I could give zero stars, I would. Mind you, I don't expect much from franchise restaurants. Just satisfy my cravings (on the rare occasions that I wind up craving franchise food) and give me decent service, and we're good. Which is why the experience I JUST had was unbearable. It took 45+ minutes to be seated when a table that would've fit my family of 7 was readily available. Our waitress started off great - took our entire order in one shot and went about her business.  But then started the shouting from the kitchen which started off with two girls yelling at the top of their lungs to NOT yell at each other. My grandsons' kids meals came out before the appetizers, but I thought that was a good thing so they wouldn't have to wait. Until my 19 year old stepsons food came out before the apps too. And then I was just confused.  ""Sorry, kitchen is really backed up tonight."" Oh, alright.  About 25 minutes later our appetizers finally came out, but we had no plates to eat them on. Flagging someone down was impossible, so we wound up eating on napkins.  Then came a random employee screaming ""I AM SO SICK OF THIS SHIT I SWEAR YO! I'M SICK OF THIS SHIT!!"" Yeah, us too.  We canceled the rest of our meals and quickly peaced out. I don't know what happened at this location, they USED to be alright.  Close this place down and open another random ass store if you have to. But the service here is absolutely gutter rat trash, and I don't say that often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx

Ruthy P.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",33,5,1,1.0,11/1/2017,"Probably the worst experience I've ever had the potato skins tasted as if the were not completely done and were very mealy the mozzarella sticks were just a gooey mess I finally said ok maybe the appetizer are just prepared before the meal that's why they just aren't great and just sitting there so I decided to order a burger figured it would be hot being that it does have to be cooked to order .. I didn't even get a bite in it was cold and greasy I picked it up the bottom was wet like it had been sitting there I finally called the manager over his attitude was less than impressive I'm a manager at a hotel in midtown, I'm all about the service/ empathy I felt bad for the server it seemed she was handling more than she could the managers response was ok I will take it off it just wasn't genuine I can't blame the server she's only picking up what she is being exposed to by her manager she apologized but in the end the bill was still 69.00 when I questioned it he seemed defensive never again paid the bill and ran don't mean to be too paranoid but I distinctly smelled something like a floor cleaner in my glass after I complained and when I was leaving I smelled it as they cleaned at the bar never ever again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx

Then he came and told us that someone stole our table and that the manager told home that he couldn't make them get up....

But service was excellent especially with the caring, attentive and very, very personable ""Stefvone"" our waiter! He was the epitome of a great server!  He would be great as a service team trainer or future manager because his happy, positive disposition will infect his staff! Also his attention to details were impeccable!  The food was very good as well, with entrees of juicy savory French dip beef sandwich and off the charts steak fajitas! A whole juicy seasoned steak with onions and peppers with mounds of rice, and black beans. Another dish of salsa, sour cream, and guacamole made this dish not only delicious but a great value at only $16.99!

But in the middle of the dinner crowd the general manager screams in the dining area all servers proceed to the back. I love TGIF's but today's experience was the worst. GM Christopher Bowen called his team together in front of the whole restaurant and was yelling at them loud enough to make the whole restaurant quiet and pay attention. He was complaining about endless menu items and not giving people to go food from it. However he started yelling about how they need to make sales and pay the light bill mentioning the amount that needs to be paid. He mentioned they need to pay 46k for the light bill! This is an outrage of spreading company business and treating your employees this way! I felt embarrassed for his team and not only did we feel uncomfortable but the customers around us were complaining and asking for his name to call corporate. I will be coming back but if I see him here or see this behavior again I will not stay or return. When we asked him to come over so we can let him know how we felt about our water down drinks and cold food because the time he took yelling at the team,  He was so unprofessional about it.

Sam D.,"Charlotte, NC",23,192,123,2.0,12/25/2014,"What else does one do on Christmas evening when the movie theater is packed & your movie is sold out? TGI Fridays of course lol. Started with the Appetizer Platter which was good & hot excluding the dried out potato skins with a burnt pieces of bacon on. Snailed it's way out of the kitchen but overall good. My partner & I ordered 2 LIT's from the bar which tasted like Kool Aide flavors but at half price I won't complain.  For our entree we ordered Med Rib Eyes with Lobster tails. Once again snailed it's way out of the kitchen, maybe a 35-40 min wait but great company and an attentive server made the wait less jarring. The rib was cooked well with this not being a steakhouse, the seasonal veggies were hard unsteamed & lack luster. A few of our sides were placed incorrectly on our plates. Steak was the star of this meal. Our Server was good for the most part. Very polite, partially attentive but looked overly spreaded btw tables. Could have visited a few extra times but overall nice waiter. I have to call him out on the fact he brought over 2 empty bottles of A1 sauce which was hilarious to me & my partner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx?start=40

The crazy part is, the place was pretty much empty.  Waiting 90 minutes for drinks is absolutely ridiculous. Waiting over an hour to order entrees is just unacceptable.

Suwanee S.,"Kingsbridge, Bronx, NY",0,1,,1.0,3/6/2016,"The only reason why I gave it 1 star is because without giving it at least 1 star it would not have allowed me to write a review. In other words, this deserves NO STARS. I have been working in the restaurant industry for more than 10 years and this restaurant should be ashamed of themselves as it was an absolute disgrace to the Food and Hospitality world.  We were greeted and seated in a timely manner. The hostess walked quickly in front of us and departed without a single word. The menus were broken. Yes broken. The are held together just like a book, but with some short of staples? The pages were holding on at the top corner and the pages would come apart at the top edge like a used magazine. We then waited about 15 mins and yet still no greeting by a waiter. As I stepped aside to go use the bathroom, I told my grandmother that if our waiter comes as I am in the bathroom, to go ahead and order drinks and apps. I opened the door to the bathroom and I stopped in my tracks. As I panned the bathroom, I saw toilet paper ALL OVER the bathroom, soap ALL OVER the sink, unflushed  toilets in every single stall, broken stalls where there was no locks. The bathroom even had a disgusting odor. My urges to  use the bathroom disappeared.  I then walked back to my table and asked my grandmother if our waiter has come and she said no. It was been almost 20 mins and yet not even a ""Hello how are you, I'll be right with you"" My grandmother is 75 years old and I refused to wait any longer. I got up, spoke to the manager that looked a host after gossiping at the front desk about my issue and just said in the most sarcastic way ""Oh I am sorry to hear that."" Without even bothering to fix the problem or wonder who my waiter was. I was not looking for free stuff or have top service, I was helping THEM out by telling them this is bad for their business. And not only that, this is your work place, the place you are when you are not home. You make our work place your 2nd home and you live in this conditions? I can't imagine how the kitchen is. I work in a restaurant and I always want to take pride in where I work. It is a reflection of myself as a worker.  Please do not to THIS LOCATION.

Rob B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",82,11,3,2.0,2/28/2016,"I set my timer for 20 minutes the minute I sat down because I could immediately tell nobody gave a fuck about working there and I was kind of in a hurry. After 18 minutes I see 5 occupied tables in the dining room everyone staring at their menus. Nobody is being taken care of and there is a lot of ratchetness echoing from the kitchen- loud yelling and singing and screwing around- pans clashing together and dropping on the floor. It sounds like a mix of a rap concert, a broke ass opera, and a severe thunderstorm  in there.  I hope all that stuff being dropped on the floor is getting washed. As far as the behavior, I'm Not surprised- I just wanted to get here before the rush to eliminate that as the reason for it taking forever. 18 minutes later someone came over and she was very nice and professional- just running her ass off because everyone else that works there is fucking off not doing anything. Knowing this, I didn't even so much as utter a word of my frustration. I decided to not leave because after all, I'd probably just end up going somewhere else in the area and waiting 20 minutes there too.  It's been well over an hour and a half - the same 13 people at 5 tables are here, plus another 5 that just came in. I hope they're from here and know what they're up against.  After an hour and a half of the kitchen staff's awkward behavior, I hear a stern voice say ""you're scaring our guests"". Great timing. I'm  fashionably late, but the food just got here and looks cooked...hopefully nobody tried to make music with it by dropping it on the floor or throwing it at the wall.  writing this really helped kill the time.

We sit down and decide to take advantage of the ""Endless Appetizers."" The Endless Apps were STARTLESS. We ordered our meal the same time we ordered the app thinking it would come out first like it does at any other FUNCTIONAL restaurant. Our meals came BEFORE the app an HOUR LATER. The USELESS manager comes over and tells us that the reason why the apps didn't come out when they should is because ""there's like two people in the fry area and like tons of tickets."" IDGAF! You offer a promotion, MAKE IT HAPPEN! I ordered the pecan crusted chicken salad with an avocado dressing. The chicken was COLD, the lettuce tasted like it just came out of the ground and was UNWASHED, and the dressing tasted like all they did was open a bottle of VINEGAR and pour it all over the salad. I sent it back and just ordered a burger.  The manager walks by the table saying ""we put the order in for your burger, she told me about your salad."" Now you would think, and we even asked for the burger to come quick since my guests were half way through their meal and I had sent back that TERRIBLE salad. This wasn't the case. 40 minutes went by, still no burger. By this time my friend was HEATED and she let that USELESS manager, Cliff (a mid to late 20s African American guy) the reason I described him is because he didn't have a visible name tag on and he hesitated to tell us his name. This FOOL comes back to the table and tries to turn it around and put it on my friend and lecture her about voicing her opinion! He has the burger on the plate and is shaking he is so upset. He says ""we do take care of our customers. we do care for our customers. You shouldn't raise your voice or use profanity."" She said shit ONE time, then apologized for that. Then this fool comes back to the table trying to lecture her like he's her father. NO BUENO! Now she is really pissed, but calmly told this SAD EXAMPLE of a manager that what he is focusing on is minuscule and not to lecture her. He failed us as a manager in many ways. First, the app didn't come out and he sits down and gives excuses about the kitchen and offers to pay for ONE order of fried green beans that were initially ordered as an ENDLESS APP. Second, he didn't stay on top of the kitchen to make sure my burger was made immediately and correctly. Third, he tried to make a scene at the table telling my friend that she shouldn't raise her voice or use profanity, ONE cuss word that she immediately apologized for, and trying to make sure that everyone else in close proximity of our table heard that ""we care for our customers, we take care of our customers"" with a CRAZY PATHETIC attitude. Never ever ever EVER will I visit this SLOW, POORLY SERVICED, HORRIBLY MANAGED restaurant. I will make sure my friends know not to go here as well.

Margaret A.,"Astoria, NY",69,108,228,3.0,4/10/2013,"This rate is based on the two times I been here.  The last time, the wait wasn't that long, like 5 minutes but as soon as we sat down there was about 20-30 waited to be seated.  We instantly knew what we wanted to drink.  The server came by our table twice to tell us she would be right back to take our order.  About 10 minutes into us being seated we were asked what we wanted to drink and at the point we even knew what we wanted to eat.  We ordered 2 strawberry lemonades, fried mozzarella and 2 bacon cheeseburgers; one with French fries and the other with mashed potato.  The appetizer came out right away but she forgot our drinks and also plates.  We waited another 10 minutes for our drinks, plates and napkins.  And then we waited 40 MINUTES (no joke) for our burgers.  The worst part was that the bacon was raw.  I almost threw up in my mouth.  At that point I was just fed up, called over the waitress and asked to speak to the manager.  Another 5 minutes went by and no sign of her.  Then maybe another 5 minutes later, the manager shows up and I told her the situation at large and all she could say was and I quote ""I'll take 5 off for the bacon.""  Like seriously? We been here over an hour and were served raw bacon ... and you want to give us $5 off our bill? I guess you don't want us coming back because we ain't!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx?start=120
Corey S.,"Bronx, NY",0,1,,3.0,10/2/2011,"It's ok; the location is good if you drive by car. I went there with my girlfriend we got served pretty quickly.  I got the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta the portion looked so small when it came out, but surprisingly it filled me up. One thing I didn't like they only had 2 small pieces of shrimp in the whole pasta.  I order the ultimate Mojito to drink didn't taste all that good to me hardly any alcohol in it. My girl got the ribs and lobster combo she loved it.  I also told them that I was using a coupon, heads up you have to remind them of that at the end or they'll charge you full price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx?start=120

Daniele R.,"Bronx, NY",55,23,12,5.0,5/7/2010,"Wow I'm sorry to read people had bad experiences here because honestly, I think this place is great. I went to the one I believe on 34th street before and it was horrible, totally put me off Fridays. But this one opened and my cousin convinced me to go. Its a really nice setting, the food is as good as Fridays food is gonna get and okay the surrounding area isn't great (Chuckee Cheese anyone?) but the service is unbeatable. I recently went with a bunch of co workers and forgot to mention we needed separate checks. No worries, our awesome waitress already separated the orders from the beginning. Most places wont split your check if you wait until the end of the meal (Dallas BBQ). I'm not giving this 5 stars because its the BEST restaurant ever, but it is the best Fridays Ive ever been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx?start=120

Melanie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,43,3,1.0,8/22/2011,"I've eaten at this location many times and I'm a Give Me More Stripes cardholder, so I get discounts. Everytime I've come here, it's been a problem and last night was the final straw. I had an $8 rewards coupon for accumulating points (from eating at their restaurants) and on the coupon it does say "" not valid with any other discounts."" Ok cool. So I was with two dining companions and I purposely ordered a full-price dinner so that my coupon would be eligible. One of my dining companions ordered  the ""3 for 16.99"" deal. When it came time to pay, the waitress told me that I couldn't use the coupon (even though it was in MY name and from MY stripes card) because one of the people I was dining with ordered a discounted meal....WHAT?! So I asked for the manager because that didn't make sense to me! The manager comes over and CONFIRMS it! Tells me that the coupon applies to the whole table, not just my meal but NOWHERE on that coupon does it say ""discount applies to whole table"" and who I am anyway to tell my friend what he/she can or cannot order because I have a coupon!!!!??? Ugh! So I asked to split the check then...and again I was refused because he said we are still sitting at the same table!!! So basically, I would have to dine alone (who does that?!) or sit separately from my friends to use the coupon!!! Assinine! So this morning I call corporate, complain to them, and I'm told that since it's a FRANCHISE, management at that location is able to make up their own rules and regulations concerning coupons....REALLY??!!! So they can treat their customers any ole kinda way, using the Fridays Trademarked name, and Fridays corporate won't do anything about it! CRAZY! They are SO many places to dine in the Bronx and in NYC, do they not realize how easy it is for me to go somewhere else? I will no longer eat any ANY Fridays restuarant and I'm urging everyone I know not to eat there either, until they start realizing the value of good customer service!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx?start=120
T B.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,,4.0,6/2/2013,"I highly recommend this location. I love the food and I find the staff to be friendly, informative and our wait time for food is never long.  Ask for Deanna, she is a fantastic server! I have only gone there to eat on the weekends for lunch, so the a Friday or Saturday night experience could be different, but I've had anything but a positive experience with this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx?start=120
James R.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,,1.0,1/25/2012,"This place has really gone downhill quick.  We were there today (wednesday 1/25/12 @ 4:30 pm)  and it started off bad from the beginning.  the hostess sat us at a visibly dirty table (there were pieces of food that she brushed off when she put the menus on the tables).  After it became quickly obvious that she wasn't going to clean it, I asked for another table.  She sits us at a 6 person table, then walks away.  Then she returns a minute or so later saying we couldn't sit there since we were only a party of 3.  So, they had someone clean our original table and we sat back there.  Then the waitress had a major attitude problem.  My sons kids pizza was horrible (soggy crusted microwavable).  We're DONE with this dump.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx?start=120
Luis H.,"Toronto, Canada",102,501,77,4.0,11/14/2011,"Located in a shopping plaza that also is home to a Chuck E. Cheese and Duane Reade, TGIF is a nice place to escape, have a few drinks and enjoy good food without breaking your budget. Located in the Eastchester/Co-op City area of the Bronx, the place is always busy on weekends. The frozen drinks are always good, especially during a hot summer day and the meals are good for a chain restaurant. There aren't too many sit-down chain restaurants in this part of the Bronx, so when this place opened up it provided residents and shoppers from the neighboring Bay Plaza Shopping Center another choice besides Red Lobster and Applebee's.  Make sure to sign up for their loyalty program to earn 'stripes' for your next visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx?start=120
Alan S.,"Bronx, NY",1,49,,4.0,5/18/2012,"I have never actually been satisfied with a TGI Friday's until this one. I've been to plenty in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn where the food was terrible and overpriced. While I still like the taste of Applebee's food better, the overally atmosphere and better and more efficient service make this a much better option if you're debating between the two. The drinks and food all came very fast. I will dare say this is the best TGI Friday's I've been to, but since to date this is the only TGI Friday's I've ever liked, I'm not so sure if it's that bold a statement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx?start=120
Fashionist A.,"New York, NY",2,60,3,1.0,8/5/2010,"This was the WORST dining experience I've EVER had (so far)! The food & service was absolutely horrible. I should've known there was something wrong when I called beforehand to ask what time lunch ended, and the girl who answered said,""Uhhhh... you mean happy hour.... uhhhh...."" I was like like, ""Um, no... lunch, like food...?"" What an idiot!  Anyway, I went there with my friend, her 2 kids, & my sister for lunch a few weeks ago. I ordered the ""ultimate salad"", my sister ordered some shrimp thing with a side of broccoli, and my friend ordered some ""carribean"" chicken & rice dish. Well, my salad was supposed to be tossed with honey mustard but I asked the waitress to also give me a side of ranch too. Well, it came out with just a side of ranch with no honey mustard. So I started to eat it with the ranch while the waitress went to get me the honey mustard.... it was SO NASTY! How can anyone get ranch dressing wrong?! It was bitter. The salad itself was bitter as well for some reason. Then my sister's broccoli was soaked in lime so she got sweet potato fries which came out seasoned & very salted. How do you get that wrong?! Just fry some damn sweet potatoes & serve! Also the service was EXTREMELY slow. We were there for about 1 1/2- 2 hours and the place was virtually empty. When the check came we were over charged $10-15... the dumb waitress charged us non-lunch meals, my sister's replaced side, and a dessert (the red velvet & the won ton thing were SO awful as well). She corrected it, but I think she was trying to get over on us. Oh, and to top it all off, my friend got her phone stolen- probably by someone who worked there because there were more staff than patrons at the time we were there! Basically, DO NOT go to this place... you will regret it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-bronx?start=120
