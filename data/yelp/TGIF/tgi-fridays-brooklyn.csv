Bei T.,"Brooklyn, NY",76,129,148,2.0,7/20/2015,"Not the best place to go to especially if you have a large group. I came here multiple times and each were unpleasant. Wait time can be as long as an hour especially if it's dinner time. After a horrific long wait you still have to wait forever for a Staff to come take your order and bring you the food. Normally I'm a fast eater and prefer things to be quick especially dinner time. By quick I mean in and be done with dinner within an hour or a bit more. When I come here,I lose about 3 hours of my life waiting for service and food itself which actually  gives you a lot of time to think of something to talk about and catch up with friends. Not saying catching up is bad but I prefer to do that somewhere else afterwards like a dessert place, a cafe, bar or something. Servers took a while to flag down so that frustrated most of the people in my group. For it's price , it's pretty expensive for the quality of the  service and flavor of the food .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=180
Lori S.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,20,2,4.0,1/13/2016,"Since my last review there have been a few improvements as far as food is concerned. I am so glad to have this spot back to a better status. The Jack Daniels menu is always a perfect go-to if feeling indecisive.  The bartenders can get pretty busy and could take a few mins to get to you, but the drinks are  yummy, if you don't mind waiting 10 mins. On popular nights it can be a wait of up to an hour, particularly weekends. But i hate to wait especially when I'm hungry so I prefer weekdays for this place. The patio is open for dining so I look forward to the warmer months sitting outside looking at the boats in the bay. The staff is still inattentive and blah. The bathrooms always look like a hurricane hit. I find myself wondering if the staff was held at gunpoint to apply for work here, that is the only explanation my husband and I could come up with to explain why they all look so miserable. Ugh but if you're okay with the wait and the neglect, the food is great! Might have to ask a few times for forks and napkins, but at least you'll have food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=180

My waitress got everything wrong. It took her about 15 minutes to put the orders in, then when she did it, she neglected to mention that their menu had changed and they no longer serve things they way we may remember it. I never got my pineapple juice that I ordered and instead got a drink that I didn't order. She was slow returning to the tables when she said she would be back. We had to request straws, and utensils because they weren't there, AND we placed out whole order before she realized that we didn't have menus. It was horrible.

Alicia J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,10,,1.0,6/2/2014,"My boyfriend and I went to the restaurant the first week they reopened since Hurricane Sandy.  Service was horrible. We heard a lot of people complaining about their service but we gave our server the benefit of the doubt even though she had a few customers complaining about her service as well. Long story short, she was the worst waitress I ever had at any restaurant. She was slow and didn't want to work. The waitress complained that no one was helping her with only 4 tables. Realyy?!! 4 tables and two were vacant. We complained to management and was told that they hired a lot of new staff. The food took forever to come out that we were thinking about leaving. Also, the food was cold.  Tip for management: hire experienced workers or ensure your staff are trained!!!!

Our entrees took Almost two hours to come and then we were about to walk out n she brought them out mines still wasn't ready even after two hrs of wait all my friends n boyfriend food was cold dry n nasty. It was the worst we ask to speak to the manager we kept waiting no body ever came n then I even waited for them to give me my card back... unbelieveable!!

Robert F.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,21,12,1.0,5/26/2014,"I worked at TGI Fridays in the 80's - 90's in Florida.  Training was intense back then.  Apparently, now there is no training. 355 Brittany was our waitress. 45 minutes after we sat down, we were able to put in our drink order.  Told us she was sorry, but she had to put in a bunch of orders.  She had one other table.  I asked for a Michelob Ultra.  She said what?  I said Michelob Ultra.  She asked me to spell that.  So, I asked if they had it.  She said; if it's on the menu we have it.  25 minutes later, guess what?  They don't have it.  So, got a But Lt.  Keeping track of times now because of the original 45 minute wait. About another 45 minutes go by, and she says sorry, again, would you like to order.  So we ordered the Spinach Dip, and Pretzels with some kind of a dip.  While waiting for our Apps, some worker streaked by, dropped chips and salsa, and ran off like he was being chased by the cops.  355 Brittany saw that, and asked us why he dropped that off there?  I said; damn good question.  So, she took it away, and who knows where that went. Apps, finally come, but with no dipping sauce for the pretzels.  So, we asked for some, and she said; oh would you like to order some.  We said, no it's supposed to come with it, look at the menu.  So, she said; oh, okay.  I'll order you some.  (IF YOU'VE FORGOTTEN ABOUT OUR DRINKS, IT'S ONLY YOU AND 355 BRITTANY.)  So, after about 15 minutes of waiting for the sauce, we asked AGAIN for the sauce, and our drinks.  She said; oh, your drinks are at the bar.  She brought those, but still no sauce.  Finally, we asked for the check and told her to forget the sauce. I blame TFI Fridays for this, cause when I worked there, 355 Brittany would not be able to run her own tables unless she was FULLY trained.   WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS ONE IN MY LIFE!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=180
Boris C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,,3.0,2/7/2015,"Food ""ok"". Good atmosphere. It took for ever to serve, and to bring the food out. Asked for a check it took 15min.  Then they apologized said they are testing their new tablet system.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=180
Dan D.,"Cocoa, FL",0,30,2,1.0,7/17/2016,"Probably the worst TGIF anywhere.  I struggled to find anything to like, and I tried because there's a great view of the bay and the place has potential.  However, servers are untrained and service is dismal.

Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,2,1.0,5/4/2014,"Recently reopened, I ventured out on a Saturday night to eat before seeing a movie with friends. The service was slow, the servers themselves seemed to have no idea what they were doing or what was even on the menu and my beer order was screwed up twice. The food, however was still on par. Thinking this was a just due to a busy Saturday night, I simply let it pass.  However, as I type this, I am back today with my family. And there is no mistake, these servers have no idea how to be professional. They were all standing around watching a basketball game, it took 20 minutes just to get two beers and a seltzer. We asked the waitress for a ginger ale, only to find out 30 minutes later there is no ginger ale. We asked if they had juice, orange to be specific. The waitress tried to offer us a lemonade or Cherry coke. We just wanted orange juice. Simple. Another waitress finally got us our OJ.  Now the food, the wings are still good and there is no way to screw up a salad. But the burgers were doused in salt and undercooked. And the chicken was charred and as hard as a Hockey Puck. The waitress  just admitted that the cooks are ""still learning in the kitchen."" How can you get a job as a cook if you don't know how cook!? Atleast they didn't screw up my beer order.

I arrived at Fridays 30 after the order and still on hold, I kept the line open. I was told that my order was never put it. It was written but never entered. I asked to speak to the manager, the funny thing is that one manager finally gets on the phone to assist me another is there standing with me in the restaurant.  I informed the manger that I was in the location already after being on hold for over 30 minutes. They felt embarrassed. To make a long, bad experience short...they said they wouldn't rush my order....I stayed there another 40 minutes.  One manger told me because it was Fathers's Day and it was busy that why this happened.  If I came on a Monday, my experience would have been great.

Starting off with the waiter, although he was very nice and tried to accommodate us, he seemed a little bit confused at times.  Perhaps it was his first few days working, but whatever the case is... it is unexusable to forget to order our drinks from the bar when we ordered them as soon as we got our first drink. He also failed to inform us that they were currently out of shrimp,  which was in our main course. We ordered the jack daniels sampler where the chicken and ribs were both very dry.

The host wasn't at the door so we had to wait until somebody finally came over to us. We are seated, and I order the ribs, shrimp & 2 sides. I asked for sweet potato FFs and the waitress says that's an additional $1.00, no problem. A different waiter comes over to bring us our food, he says ""we are out of sweet potato FF, would you like regular FFs instead?"" Again no problem, BUT .. Why wait until you bring me the food to tell me? Now I'm almost finished with my food when my original waitress comes to me to finally ask if everything is ok, I let her know that I never received my FFs. She apologizes and says she's going to bring them to me, I tell her to put them to go because I already finished my food. She comes back like 20 minutes later, with my bill. Still no FFs! At this point I don't even care I just want to leave so I check the bill and I'm still being charged an extra dollar for sweet potato FFs when I never even received a damn Ff! Now I'm just annoyed, I wait for her to come around and she takes forever, the manager comes over to my table because she can see that I'm waiting to pay, I let her know what happened and she tells me she's going to take care of it. Another 10 minutes pass, my waitress finally comes to my table with a dollar discounted off of my bill, she doesn't apologize or anything. Thank God I had a coupon (buy one entree, get one free) i hand it to her with my card and she leaves, another 10 minutes pass by, I see her walking around with my card like a lost puppy. She comes back to my table and I see I got about $20 dollars off of my bill (the best part of the horrid experience!) The coupon I used was a 3 in 1 coupon, meaning you could use it up to 3 times. You think she handed it back to me? Of course not. So at this point I don't even care, I gave her a lousy tip for the lousy service and I leave WITHOUT my coupon.

I asked for the check, and went to the bathroom to wash my hands... A kitchen employee uses the urinal and rinses his hands WITHOUT USING SOAP.  That is a big problem to me.  I go to tell the manager and he just laughs it off.  I'm sorry but I don't find it funny that an employee that prepares food has just touched his penis and hasn't washed his hands.

We got there and saw people waiting outside so you know its going to be a busy night with a long wait. Went inside, left our name and waited to be called.  I have never seen such poor service at a restaurant. (I'm assuming) they were short staffed that night so the manager had to bust tables. The waiters were slow, the floors were wet, the hostess looked and acted like it was her first night working there, two workers were actually sitting at the tables eating and talking.  Workers arguing at the front of the restaurant while customers watched. One customer actually went to the hostess asking for the check because they were waiting so long for their waiter to pass their table. We finally got seated and realized that half the restaurant was empty. As in they had people waiting out front with more than enough tables available to accommodate them.  The food we waited so long for was subpar. The mac and cheese looked microwaved, the burger dry and the fries were cold when it arrived. The portions were so small and disappointing we had to add mozzarella sticks to our order.  Not a fan of Fridays but I rather go home hungry than return to this one.

Theresa M.,"East Moriches, NY",0,25,,1.0,10/9/2017,"We were a party of four and the restaurant was pretty quiet for a Sunday afternoon.  We ordered two Berry Mojitos that were quite tart and tasted nothing like a mojito.  We then ordered the loaded nachos, which had about two tablespoons of cheese, and undercooked bacon, which we sent back. I ordered the grilled salmon with rice and spinach.  The salmon was good and tasty, the spinach had no flavor and the rice was definitely left over from Saturday.  Two people ordered the onion soup and stated that they threw a piece of processed cheese over the top, and called it French onion soup.  After we received our main course, the server brings back the loaded nachos, bacon was cooked, but there still was only about two tablespoons of cheese on it.  We didn't eat it.  They served sweet potato fries cold, so my wife returned it, they came back double fried and over cooked, she returned it again.  I wanted to speak with the manager on duty, but he looked very unprofessional, and un groomed, so I figured discussing all of the food issues would not be addressed accordingly, so we paid the bill and left.  This is not the first time we have had problems here, but everyone has bad days, well TGIF in Brooklyn, you have run out of chances.  We will never eat at this establishment again, nor will our friends, and hopefully their friends as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=20

Not luke warm but ice cold. The food was sitting in the kitchen so long the melted cheese was already hard and stale. Instead of apologizing or even asking about our food the waitress just sent her manager. Mind you we were very pleasant about the horrible service.  The only good part about the whole meal was the manager Greg.  He apologized profusely, got us new food in 10 mins and comped the whole entire meal after seeing the inedible food. He even comped the ""cup of dirt"" desert we ordered after the fact cause we promised our 3 y/o for behaving so long. All in all we walked out at 4pm. The waitress could care less. Never once checked in on us, never offred a refill and shrugged when the terrible food was served. This place needs more Greg's.

Definitely one of the better looking Fridays that I've been to.  However, with all of that being said it doesn't matter because the service is absolutely atrocious. It took 20 minutes for a menu to come my way. That's because I had to call a waitress over. Staff members passed by my table 10 times and I wasn't acknowledged.  Of course I didn't just sit there helplessly. I've tried calling whoever passed by over but to no avail. I guess they couldn't tend to me because I wasn't apart of their section.  I enjoyed the sizzling chicken and shrimp with a substitute of mac & cheese instead of mashed potatoes. I also had their house Long Island special.

My chicken was drier than a desert and my shrimp was super over fried.  They gave me like 9 fries that were cold.  My sister ordered the Cajun pasta and that was overcooked to death and cold.  They switched it for a ribeye steak and ask for medium rare and got super dry well done.  I waited forever to get the check but they did comp us two out of the three meals.  This is probably the worst service I have ever experienced.

Gail C.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",220,363,70,3.0,7/30/2017,"I haven't been here since pre-hurricane Sandy and I must say that the renovations were a total upgrade. It feels more spacious. If the waitress seats you around the window area, the view of the bay is really cool. And you become convinced of wanting to try some water activities after seeing people canoeing/kayaking. The decor speaks English/Irish pub style with lots of wood (tables and bar), leather (I think it's real) booths and of course, they have a few specialty beers. Not a beer connoisseur so I can't tell you what they had. My date was pregnant; I didn't want my homegirl to feel anyway so I skipped out on ordering alcoholic beverages. We both ordered turkey burgers along with mozzerella sticks for appetizer. For drinks, I ordered a virgin mudslide and she got lemonade. Honestly, the mudslide did not bring a smile on my face. It was missing an ingredient. I shrugged and kept drinking, though. I don't really like to send anything back unless it's horrific. I decided to keep it.  My girlfriend enjoyed her turkey burger but I didn't. It tasted weird to me. I took one bite and I was done. The three mozzerella sticks that I ate was enough to fufill me until I got home so I can eat it again. Service was cool. We had a very nice waitress.  TGIF is right in front of the movie theater so it's very convenient to get a quick bite and have some drinks. Don't expect meals to be five star rating but it serves the purpose.

Raymond R.,"Woodhaven, NY",16,12,1,1.0,12/28/2017,"Asked how long the wait was and they answered 20 minutes(there were about 15-20 people in the waiting area(not together apparently)). But saw the bar was half empty so I opted for that. Once I sat down I noticed that there were about 6 tables empty but figured it was a staffing issue(strike one).  Only 2 employees behind the bar with about 12 people seated. Found a menu that was laying by and chose a drink, funny enough there were no prices on the menu for cocktails(strike 2, Fridays where the big ballers go who dont need price tags lol). Took a while to get the attention to put order in(about 5 with a few ""be with you in a second""). When the employee came(server: 778 ryan according to receipt) I was told that my choice from the ""Here's To Livin' Light"" menu was only for online/take out orders(It doesnt say that on that menu, will add picture of menu later). Took our drink orders and came back a little on the long side of 5 minutes again(with a few ""be with you in a second""). Drinks were good but was starting to get a little light headed from drinking on an empty stomachs for 15 minutes. I normally dont like to bother people and be ""that guy"" that complains to the waiter but after ANOTHER 15 minutes I decided to stare a hole into the waiter. I guess it worked cuz he nodded a table waitress over to me and she came over and all of us knew something was off about the food not being here yet. She came up to us and said she'll check up on the food(she could probably tell the look on our faces of ""wtf?"") Strike 3. After some yelling in some other language from the bartender to the kitchen area it was something about not having that side and to choose another. My friend ended up blaring out just put anything on the plate so we can eat already. We got our food and it tasted good but then again after 45 minutes from sitting down and watching other people eat their food and leave I'm guessing anything might taste good. BTW they mixed up the sides (that were available to us), I got one of hers and she got none of the sides she wanted but we just shared plates at that point(just insult on top of the injury lol)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn

Taheefa S.,"Canarsie, Brooklyn, NY",61,121,171,1.0,7/24/2017,"Every visit the customer service and rating continues to decline. I am not sure what's happening with the management and employee service here but it is certainly horrible. I went here on a Friday afternoon in the middle of the day at 2:30pm. There was no rush nor was the restaurant crowded...and were seated around 2:45pm even though the place was empty. The reasoning for this was because a female manager came out and said she has to give her workers and kitchen staff time to catch up so she'll seat us in about 15 mins. I am not sure of her name but her role in this dining experience gets better. While waiting in the entrance to be seated... she's telling the hostess that she doesn't know what's going with the kitchen staff and that another waitress can't even handle the tables she has now, so don't seat anyone. This is unprofessional and ill-mannered. The whole conversation was just uncomfortable to make any customer leave or go home. I didn't leave because my guests and I were hungry and we knew the food here wouldn't disappoint. We were wrong... we eye say shortly after. The same female ""morning manager"" as she called herself told us ""To be honest with you you put in your order now and I don't know when your food is going to come out I have no idea what they're doing back there but I suggest you put something in quick"". Right away my guests and I asked her her role here she said she's a Morning manager and she would go see what's going on in the back (the kitchen). She had no work ethic whatsoever. Our server came about 15 mins after (please remember there is no rush in this place whatsoever) she takes our drinks order and our endless apps order. Fifteen minutes later my order for apps comes out and my guests are still waiting. No drinks came out not even glasses of water were offered. We didn't see our server to complain about waiting so long for our drinks and other apps to come out. She came when we first Ordered our apps and then I asked her for water. She brought out the water about 10 minutes later saying the bar was making our drinks.... whenever we looked over at the bar she was with a couple socializing and tending to Their every need whilst a table Next to mines and ours waited on her. The drinks that ""the bar was making"" came Out about 20 minutes later. We complained about our apps not being refilled or the the first round not coming out. Finally the two missing orders of apps came out we had to call over our server to place our entree orders. She took the order and whisked away again to be at the bar with friends still a table Next to mine was trying to get her attention. Our food came out after 4:00pm and please note the time we came in. I have never had such a horrible dining experience in my life. I didn't like that she kept lying to us about a burger not being cooked yet and the chicken not being ready. Her excuses were just used To excuse her horrible service. The friends she had at the bar, came in after we did and left before we did. I will never come back to this Fridays again. Ever. Absolutely disgusting the customer service is horrible the attitude of the workers are unprofessional and the management is just as bad.

Evan C.,"Shirley, NY",1564,481,3496,1.0,4/19/2017,"If you know Brooklyn well then you know the beauty of Sheepshead Bay. It's by the water and is up and coming. So any business lucky enough to be in this area will benefit from the large crowds that flock here to enjoy the view. So if I was running a world famous franchise such as ""TGI Friday's"" in this area, it would be the best, well run business in the area, right? Well the only positive I can give them is the view, other then that let me explain why. I came here for the first time with my Girlfriend and her three friends. They like coming here because of that view I mentioned before. Once we walked in we waited to be seated. But the wait was longer then our dining experience there. A hour into our wait we asked the hostess or waiter, whoever it was because he didn't say, what was the hold up. He replied they don't have the staff to accommodate all the guest. I thought this was interesting because it would have made sense and it could be possible if the place was packed. It wasn't. It was empty and there were seats available. You mean to tell me, we couldn't be seated and offered drinks until a waiter could come serve us? The guest behind us told us to pay attention because they were seating people before us that came later. I wanted to say it was because of the size of our party but again they had plenty of available seats. This place wasn't being managed at all. The guest that spoke to us finally decided enough is enough and left. We waited this long we wanted to see this thing to the bitter end. After about a hour and a half we were seated. The waiter took our order and we waited for the food. At this point I was starving, so I knew it wasn't going to be pretty once the food came. I have eaten at ""TGI Friday's"" before, but I must say I was so disappointed. I'm not going to go into a lengthy discussion on the food except to describe want I noticed. I can't really explain the taste of the food, so let me tell you how it looked.  This was the first time my food looked sad. It looked as if it was mistreated before they cooked it and it wasn't proud to be a burger. I couldn't even believe they sent it out like that to me with three strips of tiny bacon and some skimpy french fries. This was not what I expected from ""TGI Friday's"". This part of Brooklyn should be a priority for the company because it's so busy. If this place was run correctly it could be a recommended tourist attraction.

Order drinks as soon as we sat down, our drinks came after our disgusting  appetizers, my husband drinks (rum and Coke) was flat.  My sons chicken fingers must have been cooked in the same oil they cooked something garlicky  I will NEVER come here again.

Paul T.,"New York, NY",99,118,158,2.0,6/5/2017,"Don't waste your time,  I'm sure you can find a better option in the area. Went here on a Saturday evening with a group of 5. We weren't seated for over an hour in a restaurant that was not that busy and I could see many open tables.  Their reasoning... they didn't have a server for that area. How do you have too few of servers on a Saturday? Isn't that the busiest night for all restaurants in America?  We did notice a lot of groups of 2 and 4 being seated; some that came after us. Their other reason, they only had square tables for 4. Solution: get more round tables that can accommodate odd numbered groups if needed.  I will say our server was pleasant... when we saw her. Since we got squeezed in a random corner we weren't attended to often. It even took 35 minutes to settle the check [1 credit card] I took advantage of their unlimited appetizer special ($10) and topped it off with 2 watered down house Long island iced teas. The other entrees ordered at the table looked very delicious, so food wise, we were satisfied.  I regretted agreeing to travel to the ends of the earth (deepest corner of Brooklyn) from the moment we waited more than 30 minutes for our table.

After storm sandy hit and they renovated, it's been pure garbage. I've been here 5 times in the past 3 years, walked out twice. Service is just as bad as the food. The last straw was Game 5 past week, cleveland vs golden state, they were at 20% capacity, how am I going to sit at a bar and wait 15 mins for a drink, while the bartenders are chilling around. 4 girls walk in and get attention right away from one of the bartenders, they have turned this place into their own playground.

Very rainy night.  Thirty five minutes later, the server brought out one drink, and it was partially empty and my drink never showed up.  She kept saying they were making it (nothing fancy).  We gave up and I cancelled.  When the rest of the party showed up, they tried to put us in a booth made for 4, but there were 6 of us.  We had to wait for a table.  We waited 30 minutes for someone to take drink orders. We only ordered soft drinks and tea since the bar (3 bar tenders) was too slow. We finally got a server who was very good and the evening got better. We were very generous with gratuities.  After, I tried to get my car from Valet Parking, in the pouring rain, but there were no attendants (at 9PM).  Turns out he was sleeping in a car and never saw me trying to find him and I was soaked. Someone from the restaurant came out and was flashing lights at him to get his attention. He had left my car open door and my front seat was flooded.  Made no attempt to help and didn't bother to bring the car where I was waiting in front of the restaurant.  He put his hand out for a tip and I had to ride home sitting in a puddle on my leather seats.

Could she have been helping the others clean tables for the mounting number of guests coming through the door? I guess not..     Finally after a 35 min wait, we were seated. Our waitress was nice and she apologized for our wait. When we asked her what was going on, she said there were only 4 waiters/waitresses and ONE BUSBOY! I was shocked when she said that.. Granted it was a Monday night but still..  That's ridiculous. She said that the staff kept getting double and triple shifts, so I guess they decided to go on strike or something..

Come on....not cool. 3 - Overworked staff. They have the waitress bussing tables and sweeping and collecting orders and taking food to the tables. - TGI Fridays - I see a serious labor issue there.

Donna R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,,1.0,2/28/2015,"Let's get this straight from the get-go, you come here for the food. Not the greatest food, but the food you saw on a commercial last night and said, ""Gosh darn it, that looks scrumdiliumcious.""  Now, it's TGI Fridays in the boondocks of Brooklyn, and the food is, well, edible. To be quite honest, I'm unsure of why I keep coming here. Perhaps it's because of those persuasive endless appetizers and their Jack Daniels everything, but that's probably about it.  Their service? Well, no one stands at the host(ess) stand, so you're pretty much in famished limbo until the TGI Dude(tte) finally delivers you to what seems to be your savory salvation. Finally, you get to sit down, do the whole ""what should I get? Oh, that looks good!"" bit, and then you wait for your sever. And wait. And wait. Wait some more. Call over the manager. Wait some more. Oh, look, there they are! Finally they take down your order, give you an attitude, and try to (horrendously) up-sell you.  If you want water, you need to call the manager over so they can tell your server to do their job.  If you want your bill, you might as well take that 20-minute catnap while you wait.  In general, if you want anything, well, good luck with that. I hate tipping poorly, but man, they are just that bad.

I ended up missing my table call twice because it was that disorganized. When I was finally seated, the waitress chardonnay decided it wasn't necessary to give us utensils to eat our food. How do you bring me plates with no fork or knife first? I also did not like how the waitress kept rushing me to do my next refill for the endless apps, I felt pressured which makes no sense for this deal. She also did not bring us lemons for our waters in time, we were done with our drinks by the time she brought it, that's how long she took. I also don't appreciate her bringing us the check when we didn't even ask for it. I definetly would like to add that none of the employees smile, they all look miserable and don't have great social skills, my waitress had no enthusiasm and was very cold, the hostess was not happy either. I would also LOVE to know which bartender had the nerve to hit on my boyfriend who simply asked for change of a $20, you shouldn't be flirting with any of your customers that is not professional. To top it off, the bathroom was filthy, there are no staff or attendants there to maintain them. I don't appreciate seeing 0 toilet seat covers in stock. The food remains mediocre and probably microwaved. At least valet was nice, that's the only good thing I can say about this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=140
V W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,,1.0,12/9/2016,Its my 7 year old twin nieces' birthday and they wanted to go to TGIF. We waited almost an hour to be seated after being told that the wait would be 15 minutes because the seated another party before us. After we were seated we waited another 25 minutes while the servers agrued with the manager about who would take our table. It took the concierge to take our drink order and even that was an issue as it was duplicated when they finally got someone to serve us. She promptly explained that she did not want to be our server because they only asked her after we had been waiting this long. To tell the truth I don't even know what the food tasted like. The service was that bad.  If not for those two little ladies who really wanted to draw on their menus I would have left. Thankfully they were only concerned that their food took so long. For me... never again.  This place is for the birds!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=140

Dick M.,"Brooklyn, NY",125,114,1,3.0,9/1/2016,"Let me start by saying I am not a fan of the TGIF chain. This location is on the water and they leverage the view with an outside deck.  The interior is much nicer than every other TGIF I have visited the past three decades. You'd probably be as surprised as me when you walk inside. There is adequate staffing and every person we encountered was efficient, cheerful, and helpful.  In fact, they are collectively the best staff I have ever encountered at any TGIF (any restaurant?).  The manager of this place should be proud of the staff that's been assembled. This leaves the food.  Well, it's TGIF so it is adequate.  It's the same food as every other TGIF.  That said:  it's time for the chain to improve their gluten-free options.  My daughter has Celiac Disease, so we dine gluten-free, and TGIF is lagging way behind the competition in providing alternatives.  We were presented with menus and a separate ""menu"" listing all the allergens.  So, it's a noble effort, if cumbersome, but the upshot is that there are very few GF options.

Okay we didn't have any problem with that but time passed by and we were getting seated we look around a whole section of tables was empty. The waitress was trying to do too many tables at once that she had to back and fourth. We place our order right away because we knew what we wanted. Only one app arrived and my girlfriends app didn't arrive. So we waited about 30 minutes until my girlfriend decided to open her utensils when she opened it she found a fly in it. Mind you my girlfriend is a germ freak so immediately we got it replaced for another one. She opened it and it was worse then the first one so we showed her and the waitress just took it and brought us 3 different set. Two wrapped up and one plastic one and my girlfriend decided on the plastic ones. 45 minutes passed and the food finally came I was already planning on leaving just paying for my one app and two drinks until we decided to taste the food the food was dry it didn't have flavor I didn't like it my fries were cold and I called the manager. He arrived and I told him about the food not to take it out of the bill but so he can notify his staff about the food. He ended taking it off the bill with no problem giving the impression a lot of people do it. One of the most annoying thing about whole place is the fire alarm kept going on every five minutes and they didn't tell us what was going on so we paid and ran from that place never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=60

Melinda B.,"Brooklyn, NY",120,82,48,3.0,5/22/2016,"As much as I used to hate this place, I have to say they're doing a lot to make it a better place to eat.  Before Sandy it was disgusting in here. Fruit flies and gnats everywhere, the food was nasty and it was just not good at every turn.  Fast forward to 2016. Their menu has many more options, the service is much better and they are out to make the customer happy. For instance, on two separate occasions I came in and ordered something that I really didn't like. Not their fault, it just wasn't my thing. Both times, they took the dish off my bill without me saying a word about it. That's great customer service.  I give three stars mainly because for one, they advertise on their menu having my favorite beer and they actually don't have it. And two because the bruschetta chicken pasta which used to be so so good made with angel hair pasta and just a hint of sauce is now made with fettuccine pasta and slathered in so much sauce it can't be enjoyed at all because it's all you taste, instead of a nice blend of the chicken, pasta and sauce. Also, the spinach dip has gotta go. Or at least change the cheeses. The mixture of those two particular cheeses just doesn't work. I thoroughly enjoyed the jack Daniels sampler platter and the miso wings though, so I'm glad that's one of their signature ""things"".

Imagine D.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,27,,5.0,3/23/2015,"I decided to give this specific location a try about 4 times before I wrote this review. Yes I still decided to give this place a try although I saw that it had extremely poor ratings across, Yelp, Google and its counterparts for reviews - I know, I know, only a loon would do that, right? Well I am a little nuts....about Brooklyn anyway! So because I didn't want to lose hope in my native borough and not believe the saying that all good food & entertainment is across the water in Manhattan.      The first time I went with my Fiance and son. I didn't feel like cooking so I thought it would be a great chance to go there for dinner. This was about 8-ish. We had a waitress that was very friendly, helpful and quick with pushing food out of the kitchen. She made sure our cups stayed full and she suggested drinks and appetizers when we were a little indecisive. This was before the endless apps craze so we wanted something shareable and we were not disappointed with the potato skins. We were so happy with her service we gave a generous tip and vowed to return.     The second visit was with my fiance only and it was a spot we chose to try again for lunch. We figured that since it was a Thursday afternoon and we both were free until our son's dismissal at school it was a great opportunity to see how lunch service was. We arrived about 12-ish and was seated immediately because it was a ghost town in there, aside from a few elderly members who probably seeped out from the neighboring retirement complex a block over for some afternoon coffee or soup and one or two fathers out with their little girls for a daddy & daughter lunch which I thought to be too adorable. At this time the endless apps had started and our waitress told us about what our choices were so we settled on two apps and some sort of rum concoction cause we figured 12pm equals 5pm somewhere. Anyway the food came out quick but the drinks took forever to come witch I don't understand when the bar population including the bartender was 2. We had a birds eye view of the bar and it was empty! We asked about our drink and the space cadet said ""Oh I didnt bring your drink? I know it was made. OOOhh there it goes *points at bar* I left it over there. I knew I had them. I'll make you fresh ones""....smh She got $1 tip from us. No way should we have sat down in the 12th hour and not leave after 3. Despite that we returned cause We didnt want to count this place out because of one dingle berry.  Since that visit^^^^^^^ management has changed, they've hired a slew of new people and service had in fact improved. Ive gone a lot of times since the afternoon disaster including the time where management tried to end the endless app which we complained to the new manager about and he apologized and removed a few bucks to sooth our unhappiness cause in fact thats what we drove down there for - the apps special! The last time I have been here was two weeks ago and I observe how well then staff works together, service is better than ever, food always come from the kitchen hot, Im not seeing revolving wait staff like the first few times so I hope thats indication management is much better this time around. I do recommend this place. I dont understand the poor ratings. I have had only good service here except that afternoon ding bat. Otherwise its been good. I give it 5 stars.

Tammy W.,"Brooklyn, NY",118,408,162,3.0,7/19/2014,"Came here before my movie around 12pm on a Saturday.  We weren't seated immediately because the person was seating someone else, so we waited like 5 minutes?  The place looks so different from before, it's nice.  We sat by the giant windows where we could see the water and the boats.  The booth was very small, but fits 2 people.  As soon as we sat down, the waitress told us some of the specials super quick and jetted off.  We had some time to look at the menu and then she came back to take our order.  The appetizers came super quick and hot, so that's good.  The entrees came almost right after we finished our appetizers so that was good too.  We didn't have contact with the waitress except when taking our order and getting the bill.  There aren't too many waiters and waitresses so that might be why service is poor but I saw them training a bunch of new workers.  I think I got lucky during this visit because there weren't too many people at the restaurant, maybe because I was early.  Overall, it was ok - just like any other Friday's.  The food is good, so it always has me coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=280

Tayler S.,"Brooklyn, NY",42,67,17,3.0,6/12/2014,"If there's any chain restaurant I enjoy, it's this one. TGIF serves up some dishes that are a lot tastier than their competitors in my opinion (i.e. Applebee's, Chili's, etc). This location reopened recently after being closed for over a year due to Hurricane Sandy and I just tried it out the other day. Unlike most other users' reviews, I thought the service was great (most likely because I came during lunch hours when the crowd wasn't nearly as busy as dinnertime). The food, however, was very MEH. Not as yummy as it used to be. I ordered an appetizer of the fried green beans with a wasabi sauce, and while the green beans were good, it tasted like they were sitting out for awhile. The breading was soggy and overall disappointing. For my main course I ordered the chicken fingers which were tasty, but dry. I had to drench them in the honey mustard to make them more tolerable. The side of fries weren't great either, as they were overcooked. I'll come back to this place again, I'm sure, but the other TGIF locations serve up much better food than this one.

We finally ordered and our food took a while to come as well. When it did, the portions were average. I ordered the French dip. It was good but too small and there wasn't much fries that came with it. I wasn't satisfied so I went to order desert and the only desert they had was called the Tennessee Whiskey Cake. I didn't want it so we asked for the check instead. She mixed up our receipts with someone else's. It was just too much going on.

I have had very attentive waiters and waitresses previous times, but I felt like my most recent waiter was not great at all. Just kept walking by without checking in on us, or sometimes, even walking by at all! Honestly, the service is a hit or miss.... The food as well.

My food finally came out yay, not to bad its warm and was once again my waiter was MIA. I ate my cold food, then i decided too compliant to the manager about my experience and he didnt even care at all and just left and did something else. I WILL NEVER EVER EAT HERE AGAIN!

A lady stopped by, unsure if she was owner, manager or what, but asked if we were ok. My shrimp was rock hard and cold..husband's steak was lukewarm and overcooked. Son in laws burger looked like the best bet. Although fries were sparce. Better than my three parmasian fries though! Then another ""suit"" came by, we sat without drinks for awhile, guess he might have been a general manager, we ordered another round and waited a few minutes. Oh, had to ask for clean silverware..my set was dirty, finally grabbed my sil's fork so I could eat. We were never offered or brought water.. ""suits"" were in kitchen yelling at chef, waitress was very short normally were are about a 6 round drinks with lunch..was lucky to get 3 in.

You get fewer selections if you chose the $13.  I would recommend the Broccoli Cheese Soup (very good but a little too salty), Fried Mozzerella, Cajun Shrimp Pasta, and the Oreo Madness. I tried the White Chocolate Cheesecake. It was okay but too creamy that you can't taste the original flavor of the cheesecake.

Anyhow after my fist time, I thought i would give them a second chance before i can create a full opinion, I went there again this winter and it confirmed my first impression to NEVER GO THERE. The only good thing there are the french fries and the burgers are ok. The portions have become so small, the appetizers are dry, the fried shrimp is all bread. I would never go back.

Ariela B.,"Brooklyn, NY",88,294,591,3.0,11/13/2007,"I'm really surprised this place doesn't have a listing yet, considering how popular it is. But oh well. *makes one* :) For out-of-towners and Brooklynites who don't know the area, this particular Fridays is located right by the popular United Artists theater across the street on Harkness Avenue. There isn't much else in that vicinity aside from Red Lobster, a Cold Stone Creamery, and the docks. (And several sleazy hourly-hotels on the Emmons Avenue strip, but we don't talk about those.) Anyway, back to Fridays. THE FOOD Honestly? It's the same menu everywhere, so it's pretty much just like any other Fridays, with top notch, delicious dishes and great mixed drinks.  THE SERVICE Oh Fridays, how I wish you would get your act together when it comes to your ""servers"". This is the main (and maybe only) reason I don't give this place 5 stars. I would, but the table service is atrocious (and yes, it's bad enough to knock it down 2 stars). Even on a quiet night, nobody seems to know their heads from their asses as far as who's handling what table, and about 5 different people end up coming by to introduce themselves as ""your server for the evening."" The best part though? After any of them actually introduces his/herself as a server, they just DISAPPEAR for the rest of the night, never to be seen again, except maybe from a distance, blabbing to a coworker about something unimportant. Almost every time I've been there (and that number is quite high), we've literally had to flag down three people to ask when someone will actually come to take our order.  Once we FINALLY lasso a ""server"", there's more waiting for the food. This is the reason for the second star down, because I've been exponentially frustrated at seeing dozens of people get seated AFTER me and served before my food even came out - even if they ordered the same dish I did! There doesn't seem to be a concept of fairness or service order in that place, despite the ""servers"" being so grossly obsequious when you actually do flag one down. (And as a side note, they also seem to come by to incessantly bother you at the worst moments, like if you're sitting there sobbing to your boyfriend, or you're in the middle of a screaming match on the phone with someone (just examples I've witnessed), they'll be like, ""Would you like anything else? ^________^"" and just stand there over you. Great courtesy, guys.) It takes forever to get the check too, so make sure you give yourself ample time if you're eating dinner before a movie. Otherwise the check will make you late. Because of the theater, on big movie nights the volume patrons is VERY high. On opening weekends and summertime Friday/Saturday nights, it's almost impossible to get seats. You'd end up waiting an hour or more if you don't have a prior reservation, (which is almost as bad as Midtown Manhattan restaurant wait times). Even WITH a reservation, I highly doubt you'd get any faster service with such a disorganized staff. Despite the crappy service, I'd still go back time and again. Their Jack Daniels Flat Iron Steak is just too good to miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=340

They sit you down and you literally wait 20 minutes for someone to even introduce themselves as your waiter.  Ordering drinks takes another 20 minutes. This isn't a place to go to if you have a certain amount of time to eat. We've waited so long that when we ask for our food they bring it out freezing cold.  Then the ATTITUDE they have when you ask the for the FIFTEENTH time for a glass of water with lemon is absolutely ridiculous. Like I said. I only come because of convenience and certain cravings.

Nate S.,"New York, NY",368,302,221,3.0,1/13/2015,"3.5 stars.. Back in the day I used to frequent this spot after every first date to the Sheepshead Bay UA movies. And while I visited this Friday's for the first time since then I was expecting the same subpar service, inconsistency of food, and weak alcoholic drinks. This visit somewhat exceeded my expectations. Came here on a Friday night around midnight with a party of four, told that wait time was about 20 mins, but was seated within 10. #winning. Waitress was very nice (Zenath), very busy, poor soul looked like she was managing 3/4ths of the whole spot, but was very attentive. Decor of the spot upgraded from a former-hole in the wall to a more modern lay out. I was so impressed I forgot that I was at Friday's. But then the food reminded me where I was. I mooched off of my friend's appetizers, and no matter what they ordered the salt intake was borderline hypertensive crisis, everything was fried to the bone, and the alcoholic drinks counteracted the saltiness by giving you diabetes with their sweetness. Regardless, still a nice hangout spot, and as long as your blood pressure and glucose levels can hang, you can deal with the food and drinks. Drinks: The Island Rum Punch is better than the other Rum punch option (it's less sweet as a juice and more Rum-tasting), the berry drink was also good. Food: There were these beef skewers that were the bizzznass! The sauce, the juiciness of the skewers, and even with the bucket of salt on it still made it a winner in my book.

I asked how much longer it would be because we had to go and she said to hang on. After ten more minutes she did not come back.

Some people went out there with their drinks to sit and chat. I also liked how you can see the open kitchen Our waitress was nice and attentive. Everyone was walking around with these tablets to take your order. I guess that makes everything quicker b/c our apps and the kids food came out fairly quick, so did our drinks. The entrees also came out in moderation and everything was cooked well and piping hot.  I think most of the crowd was probably from the movie theater right across the street.

Sindy M.,"SAINT ALBANS, NY",39,11,9,1.0,10/11/2015,"Tonight was absolutely horrifying that a corporate franchise can be so unfriendly, uncaring, no customer service, lack of integrity and no respect for the customers needs. 1. No plates for our five people eating appetizers. We were treated like wolves. We eventually got plates 15 minutes after everything was cold. 2. Explaining you need a glass of ice water that you have to beg another waiter for is unacceptable. A simple thing like water? 3. Our waitress whom name was Asha refused to comply during our time there. I've never seen a waitress not care to the point where we sat in booth for over 2-3 hours ...  4. Waiting on a waitress and management to say ""Hey are you ok?"" After asking guy with headset to get a manager. He spoke into his headset. This was pretend because now after waiting 40 mins extra. We had to hunt down a manager whom said ""he doesn't wear a headset."" 5. Male Manager said ""I'll be right with you"" and takes another 30 minutes to even speak to us. A female manager came over and listened to our complaints and concerns (this lady came over because we had to ask Steve a waiter to beg a manager to come speak with us). Then after, the male manager showed up and now we continued to complain to both managers. I was confused because nobody should ever spend 3 hours at TGIF.  6. Our food was cold. So being there for 3 hours we was still starving when we left. So not only did we get the worst service of our lives. We left starving because the food served to us was freezing cold. One order was totally incorrect. Asha was uninterested, she could of checked on us like we were actual customers and realized the food was wrong. She went to get mashed potatoes that we never received and had a big attitude.  7. On a positive note, who ever put in a lot of money to renovate, did a fabulous job! Also, there is a waiter named Steve who was not our waiter. I was dying of thirst. I'm diabetic and I guess having a ambulance pick me off TGIF floor would have been a better solution. Steve, who was not our waiter was gracious enough to stop. He didn't have a attitude or neglect our needs as consumers. He brought over 3 ice waters and cleared our cluttered table. After which he asked if we needed anything. Steve was not our waiter however he treated us like actual paying consumers.  In conclusion this list is going to corporate and if management doesn't clean up the crew, they will go down with the ship. The only person who gets a life preserver is Steve. I will be in contact to find out what happened with Steve because he has been working there for 14 years and he is apparently the only person that try's to improve the service that TGIF has at this location. We usually go to the TGIF on sunrise highway and the staff is friendly, respectful and represent the company with high standards.  This bottom feeding frenzy, where it's seems like management and waiters are good friends so screw over customers is not good. The new renovations are a waste of time if you think ignoring consumers and comping food is going to stop complaints. Your in the wrong business. Customer service, hot food, friendly service and integrity is needed at a corporate chain. I usually tip waiters double the tax or at least 20$.. Couldn't bring myself to leave anything. Especially after sitting at a table for 3 hours being ignored by everyone but Steve..... (We tipped Steve) Wait till I resend this to corporate. Good luck because i will never ever set foot in this TGIF in my life again.  Last but not least, the same two managers had to go to the next table who had the same waitress and listen to more people complain. Sad part is Asha actually look like she was paying attention to their table and those people was still unhappy.  One star is only for Steve who probably saved my life with the glass of ice water.

I have allergies to food items and so it concerns me when restaurants do not pay attention when I order something a specific way. The first attempt at my burger was completely wrong - I asked for mashed potatoes and coleslaw with no pickle, onion or tomato. I got all the garnish on the burger with mashed potatoes and fries. I told the waitress it was entirely wrong and the mayo on the bun looked congealed. Three minutes later (which is not enough time to remake my order), my burger came back with just the lettuce, onion and tomato removed, on a different bun - same burger, because the same pickle was still hanging out. I told the waitress this is unacceptable and I wanted my burger remade. She came out with a burger that was stolen from a different table, severely hockey-puck overcooked and none of my sides.  She offered me other foods from different stations, and I told her I was done and wanted to see a manager. When I spoke to the manager, he seemed unconcerned, but offered us desserts to appease us.   This is not the first time I've had problems with this specific Fridays, and this was my last attempt at trying. They don't care enough to keep me as a customer, obviously, and I suggest not one going there if you care that your food comes the way you order it.

Julian L.,"New York, NY",197,6,7,4.0,5/5/2014,"Ahh at last our local TGIFriday is back up and running after about a year and a half since hurricane sandy destroyed nearly the whole sheepshead Bay Area. But as usual there will be pros and cons to a restaurant.  Let's start off with the pros shall we? First the entrance to the place was a warm welcome with a red carpet rolled out and many greeters at the door. Maybe it's due to the grand reopening? I'll be back updating things in a few weeks. As you walk in bathroom is to the right and a little more forward you will see a newly designed bar. And if you just turn your head to the left of the bar you will see the kitchen or part of it through the window. Been seeing this in many tgifridays now, maybe new design for all to update to? The overall design is very modern and up to date. Anyways let's move onto the goodies the FOOOOOD. Ever since my last time there the food was quite the same maybe just a bit smaller portion. Starting with apps we choose the combo with crispy green bean fries, potato skins with cheese and bacon, and buffalo chicken wings. Small plate but surprisingly filling already. Should feed about 3-4 people max. Moving onto entrees I ordered the Jack Daniel Combo and that's were we ran into trouble but later to be mentioned. In the combo I choose the chicken and 6oz sirloin which will fill you up if you had the apps and this together. Now other people on my table ordered the 2 for $16/$12 combo where you choose an app and entree. Your choices are limited but it will still fill you. But now to the cons. Sadly to say on the day that I went (5/5) they had to 86 all ribs on the menu due to a party that morning that sold out the ribs. I was looking forward to it but until next time. Another con is that it took forever to be seated though they try to squish 7 people into a 5 people booth which I think it wasn't smart and we waited for another table to be opened. ALWAYS CALL AHEAD OF TIME BEFOFE GOING THERE TO RESERVE SEATS!  Lastly shoutouts to the terrific staff that made our meal enjoyable. First with the seating, they asked if we liked it first and when we didn't they would go look for another one. Secondly throughout the whole  meal not only out server asked how it was going; others like manager and other servers asked as well. Which I think it was something I haven't seen in many restaurants.  Though this is still a new restaurant; things may change and the review may not be accurate as the opening past.

I really wish that you can put zero stars but because of the food it made a star. Where do I begin... The hostess wasn't ready for her position because a table for two shouldn't be waiting for more than an hour and the fact that she was really confusing people who were on and weren't on the waiting list. I overheard the new hostess was bashing her fellow employee. The hostess was carrying on and on, I finally got fed up asked how much longer is my wait. I was told that ""There are mad people ahead of you."" The way she spoke was very unprofessionally and her attitude wasn't professional at all. I believe if I heard her name correctly it was Jasmine. After waiting even longer we were finally seated and meet our waiter Mike. I was felt kinda bad for the Mike only because it's opening week and things seem to be hectic. We order our drinks and appetizers right away. We were waiting for 30 minutes just for our drinks. During that time we were waiting for the drinks I was told the drinks are coming soon that they punch into the machine.  Another employee came up to us while we were waiting for our drinks asked us if we needed service.  Not to mention after we had gotten our drinks, our appetizers come out 40 minutes later. Our drinks consist of a ridiculous amount of ice. You were able to sip a small amount and not really enjoy it only because of the amount of ice. Once our appetizers were cleared, I asked our waiter for water. And as time passed I notice the table next to me wasn't having a good time either. I overheard the gentlemen complaining about his plate isn't what he ordered. 45 minutes later our entrees come out followed by the two,glasses of water I order 45 minutes ago..I have to say that the food was very good. However I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible just because waiting to eat for two hours really tick me off  and the service was AWFUL.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=320
Derrick B.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,5,,1.0,7/20/2014,"The bartenders need to go back to bar tending school...The worst mojito I ever had..I gave it back and he suggested doctoring my drink up by adding strawberry flavoring and then brought me a glass with simple syrup and had me fix my own drink...The worst service ever..to add injury to insult the jack Daniels sampler came out with dried up ribs, chicken nuggets hard as rocks and rubbery textured fried shrimp..I was too disgusted. ..I miss the old Fridays before Hurricane Sandy",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=320
Winnie S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,5,,2.0,5/25/2014,Was always a TGIF fans but not anymore. This place reopened up with bad service. ORDERS WERE SCREW UP. WAITED 2 HRS FOR THE FOOD. Manager has management skills. Waited an hr to be seated and received these kind of service. I am very disappointed. I would suggest outback steak house than TGIF. The food was all burn. I ask for medium rare rib eye not well done. The waiters or waitresses are dreaming. They have no idea what is going on. This place needs to have a management plan where different people do different job and not let the server did everything.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=320
Jerry S.,"Mill Basin, Brooklyn, NY",2,2,5,4.0,5/3/2014,We went last night and it was totally remodeled. Place looks great. Long wait though. Food was good,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=320
Louis B.,"Staten Island, NY",6,44,2,1.0,6/27/2014,Avoid this place.  Long wait for lackluster service and mediocre food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=320
Touro T.,"Brooklyn, NY",90,79,42,4.0,12/11/2009,This is by far the best TGIF's around. I like this one because it's directly across from the Sheepshead Bay Movie Theatre.  If your lucky enough to sit by the window; you can gaze out at bay it's so beautiful! My favorite dish is the Jack Daniels chicken and ribs. It's mmmgood!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=320
Anin G.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,171,810,1.0,3/25/2015,"this place is not worthy of a star. there is no negative sign. why would you have valet for a place that couldnt and wouldnt give 2 craps about you. the night that i went here it wasnt even busy. we got seated right away but ddddaaammmnnn...i dont have enough curse words for how many times our table was ignored.  every time we tried to flag down a waiter they ran away. we gave them a good 25 mins to even look at our table (most would have left after 5 mins). no one took drinks orders, cared if we wanted appetizers...nada..nothing. there were other patrons who were being ignored but decided to wait it out. finally we couldnt take it anymore. as we were leaving we ask to speak to management. the hostess didnt give a hoot about our wait. the person forgot that they had seated us. when the ""manager"" approached us it looked like they didnt understand a word of what we were saying. honest to god it looked like the ""manager"" was pulled from dishwashing duties just so the host wouldnt get in trouble. well that ""F"" in TGIF must stand for ""thank god i forgot""...shheesshh...the ""F"" is the grade this place deserves. never ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=320
Lusi L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,,1.0,9/26/2015,"i decied to try this fridays 1 more time since our first time was not great. The first time around the service was poor and everything was slow from start to finish. This time around we didn't even get to sit. I decide to take my family, we went on a saturday night . We knew there would be a wait, but to my surprise my wait was extended more then it had to. After checking in, they took my phone number down. I started to realized that other partys that came after me were being seated. i checked with the hostess to double check my number,  5 mins passed and a party that just came in got seated before me . I questioned the hostess and she had no explaination but to say that they were a party of 5, so i guess my party of 4 couldnt fit in that table.  She didn't have any resolution to the problem, She then gave me the number to the GM, which I called and got no answer, and to top it off this must be the only GM without a answering service so I couldn't leave a message .  We left the place discussed , angry and very disappointed. I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.............",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=320
Giovanni B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,,1.0,9/19/2014,"This place used to be good with a great staff and good food but after the flood they should of attemped to keep some thing good like the staff . I gave it 4 attempts walked out twice 1 hour for ice cold appetizers that were wrong  I asked them to get me the correct one they said another hour , the white  manager there is clueless and arragant . i told him the tall skinny white guy was touching his shoes then squeezing limes and lemons  he said their alowed to not wash their hands ... only get bottled beer if u see this guy ...The second time waited 45 minutes for drinks . The 3rd and 4th ice cold food and always terrible service.. maybe they should of condemned the building ... just stay away .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=320
Marianne r.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,12,,5.0,1/17/2012,"mariann r. This place was great and very affordable!! We live in the neighborhood, and we finally tried it last night. The place was very crowded, but we only waited 10 minutes for a table. The service was wonderful, and the food delicious. We had burgers, ribs, and shrimp. All entrees were very generous portions, and came with sides. My family and I will definitely be going back there!!  The atmosphere is geared for young people. For me it was a little too dark in there, and the music was a little too loud. But a great neighborhood place!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=320

Janal L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,3,1.0,8/24/2015,"I visited this Friday and oh boy. By far the worst Restsurant I have been to. First off the waiter was horrible. She was extremely slow with her service. We ordered  the appetizer sampler and the jack Daniels ribs and steak. The server put the food in any came to tell us That we could not choose two type of wings for the sampler. We said okay and chaired it. She then said ""good that's what I out anyway. The food and the appetizer came out at the same time. The potatoes skins had a block of cheese thrown on it. It wasn't even melted. We sent that back. Then my steak was cold along with he Parmesan fries. They were ice cold. I then asked be for a manager. I explained to him about he food. I have to give it to him. He was very nice and offerd to replace everything. He also discounted the bill. By he time the food came out again I was annoyed and ready to leave. I then had to wait another 15 minutes for the sever to bring the bill. I was so disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=320

Jay Are E.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,1,,1.0,7/30/2011,"I really cant stand people who dont wanna do their job. I was driving there getting off the exit my wife called and asked the wait. They said 20-25 min wait. We pull up as my wife hangs up the wait is now 35-40 min. Then they give us a little piece of paper with an number 7 scribbled on it. We wait outside with their number board. 40 mins later the 7 comes we come in side they say we have to wait a few mins more because they called us and we didnt come. WTF? the last time the girl came outside cuz their number board sucked. She said ""3 or 4""... We even joked ""7?"" she snarled ""NO"" then we came in and the sat us at the tightest table possible. And they took forever to bring everything!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-brooklyn?start=320
Jaclyn C.,"Brooklyn, NY",1086,702,1051,4.0,6/7/2010,"I really have to say this location has made a complete 180 degree turn around for the absolute better!  I remember when this place first opened and it was all ""ohhh"" and ""ahhh"", but then got really crappy and then it was more ""ehhh"" and ""ewww."" My friends, I'm back to ""ohhh"" and ""ahhh""-ing here again!  Totally revamped - from the decor to the food to the service.  Prices are awesome compared to rip-off Manhattan and they always have specials going on - so ask!
