Damara G.,"Mission Viejo, CA",169,7,,4.0,11/22/2017,"Date of Visit: November 21, 2017 We came into here because our feet were hurting bad and we were starving after a full day at the park.  The place wasn't crowded at all.  Our Waitress, Natalie, was amazing. She was super attentive to my 6 yo old daughter's requests, and kept our drinks coming. Super attentive, friendly, a great attitude and generally overall, a lovely person.  I only take away a star because the food was significantly more expensive then it should have been. It tasted good, but I don't think they should be so expensive. I guess its the theme park pricing.  I am only really leaving a review because we received such great service from Natalie. Give that girl a raise. She deserves it! Thank you!  Happy Mama",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park
Eric C.,"Tustin, CA",89,6,2,1.0,12/28/2017,"Waited an hour for food.  Sesame jack strips had pieces of charred chicken. Cajun chicken pasta had oil sitting at the bottom of the plate. Signs that it's been sitting since before I walked in. Fries were cold and soft as a side. I love Fridays, they just were not on their game. Waitress was awesome though. Would most likely wait until I got closer to home next time though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park
Michelle B.,"Bakersfield, CA",2,5,,1.0,12/9/2017,"Just had the absolutely worst service we have ever had. order drinks the waitress brings one drink says ice tea is brewing, don't see her again for 20mins. Order food and I think the waitress went home cuz we Never seen her again,  we wait & wait & wait for food. Finally 50 min later our food comes out one by one and about 5 to 10  minutes between.  There's 7 of us. Then 2 orders never come after we were told they are right behind. Maddys fish and and fries came out cold. I get up to find a manager, I'm told one will be right out. 10 min later one shows up and ask what he can help with? Where do I start, better service, hot food, and our entire order at once. So what is the issue with your service? He was literally speechless with a dumbfounded look, no I'm sorry or an explanation. So we are told he will bring Maddy fresh fish and fries and find out where our other 2 orders are. They bring out the fries but no fish....WtF.  John has him take his whole untouched plate back as it was cold because he waits to eat until everyone has their food..... well we Never got our full order. Then another lady comes out with the bill rather fast without even asking. Says we took 40% off plus the fish,  rib dinner and drinks. So the bill came out to $15.34 which was still too much. Still never seen our waitress either.  The table next to us sat down after us, ordered after us, got their food, ate and left and we still didn't have our full order.  Oh and in the course of all this Kim ask Kait hey does Ronan have a green and red cup? Kait says yea with pj mask on it why? Well a waitress just walked by with it. (The cup was in the stroller) kait has to chase down a waitress to ask about it and is told in she probably took it to the back to rinse off. WYD why it was in MY stroller. Yea not a great experience there. Told them they need to go back to customer service and waitress 101 school. Made me give at least 1 star, they need negative rating because it waa that bad",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park
Steve F.,"San Diego, CA",916,1167,5947,3.0,8/26/2017,"Date of visit: August 19. 2017 It had been a very long time since my girlfriend and I had been to a TGI Fridays - especially in my case, as the two closest ones in my neighborhood of San Diego had closed.  Since we were making our way out of Knott's Berry Farm, we saw this Fridays location, figured, ""Why not?,"" and made our way inside for dinner. We chose to sit at the bar area, seeing how there were a number of people waiting, and shortly after placed our orders: My order - the French Dip sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes.  The sandwich actually was pretty good; the beef inside was cooked just right, and the au jus not only wasn't too salty, the onions inside boosted the flavor.  The mashed potatoes didn't even need gravy - they were just the right amount of firm but creamy.  (That is, once I got a chance to eat them, as you'll see in a bit.) My girlfriend's order - the Mediterranean Shrimp Naan with a side salad.  We were both surprised that the naan worked well as a wrap instead of the usual flatbread, and the shrimp and greens melded nicely with the cucumber yogurt sauce.  Kathy also liked her salad (eventually)... I also had a Newcastle Brown Ale; very good stuff and helped round out the meal.  However, while the staff was pretty quick with bringing out our orders, it took them ten minutes to give us some forks and napkins!  (Not good especially with the mashed potatoes cooling down quickly.)  By the time we did get the forks and napkins, we were halfway through our main dishes. Also, when looking through the menu, not only did it seem like this particular Fridays location had less items on it than other ones, I'm not sure if they offer the Endless Apps promotion here as well.  Something to ask about for next time. Overall, not TOO bad, but maybe Mrs. Knott's will be a better option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park
Lupe R.,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",6,53,46,2.0,12/29/2017,"Hubby and I celebrated our 23 rd Wedding Anniversary on December 15. Since we are also Gold passholder we thought dinner and a stroll through the park would be an affordable date night. We chose to sit in the bar area at a half booth. It was not crowed, there was about five other occupied tables and people at the bar. Mike came over to us and introduced himself and asked if we were ready to order or did we need a little time. We asked for more time please. About 15 minutes later he came back and asked us if we wanted to order drinks. We asked for a strawberry lemonade and an ice tea. We were brought an ice tea and some sort of mixed drink. Although it was not what my hubby ordered, he took a sip of it and liked it, so he kept it. After dropping off our drinks he went back behind the bar to socialize with the customers at the bar, he was having a blast. We waited for about another 15 minutes before we stopped someone else to let them know we were more than ready to order. A group of four young men came into the bar at that same time he was made aware that we wanted to order. He helped the group first and then came to take our order and promptly went back behind the bar to submit our order and then went back to chatting up the group of young men. By this time my tea is gone and I'm in much need of a refill. We tried to flag our waiter by waving our hand but it went unnoticed. We tried stopping a female wait staff who was in a rush to get to the back, she quickly came back out but it was clear by the full plates in her arms that she would not be able to help. Another waiter quickly walked by and did not hear my husband say excuse me. Now my hubby is pretty mad. He has to get up from our table to approach the bar to ask for a refill. He is two feet from the group of guys that have our waiter so entertained and about six feet from the other waiter that just walked by. He stood there for a few seconds when he realized they both ""didn't"" notice him. He had to say excuse me several times and each one a little louder before the second waiter turned around and asked how he could help. Can you believe we actually had to get up and chase down a waiter to refill an ice tea! All the time our waiter never missed a beat with his new found buddies. The food can out fairly quickly and was delicious. We once again had to flag down a young lady to let her know we needed another refill. Our waiter, not any wait staff, never checked on us to see how we were doing or if we needed anything else. We finished our dinner and I realized how much of a Funk I am now in because of the lack of good customer service. This is not our first time doing the TGIFRIDAY and then walk it off at Knotts thing. We have been passholder for almost 10 years now. TGIFRIDAY is my favorite restaurant, so ever since it has been there, we have eaten there. So I was highly disappointed with the lack of customer service we received. We waited for about 10 minutes after we had finished eating for someone to notice, take the dishes away, ask us if we would like dessert and bring is the check. All the while our waiter is about 10 feet from us, facing us but is still busy with the same group to notice us. I stacked all the plates at the end of the table, hoping this would catch his or anyone's attention. Almost another 10 minutes go by and we are both so annoyed by now that my hubby jumped in front of the first person that crossed our table, it just happened to be the other gentleman that had helped us earlier. My hubby told him we just needed our check. He went behind the bar and walked by our waiter and told him we wanted our bill and went to the register to print it out for us. In the mean time our waiter proceeds to tell the group of guys, who are now very buzzed after having several shots and a few mixed drinks, that we are pissed because we had to wait on our bill. Hey Jackass, I'm less than ten feet from you! I can HEAR you! One of the guys comments, fuck them, I'll order more drinks and they can wait a little longer. They are all laughing and talking crap with our waiter. I said very loudly to my husband that the waiter and the group are talking crap about us because we asked for our check. I know I said it loud enough for them to hear me. The group left as the other waiter brought us our check. There was a charge on our ticket for a cup of coffee, neither of us have ever drank coffee. I let the waiter know this was a miss charge and to please correct it and I wanted to provide my rewards number for points credit. He took this over to our original waiter and asked him to fix it. When he brought us the corrected ticket he was so kind and polite, bullshit, too late! I know we were in the bar, I know we did not order drinks (even though we ended up with one anyway), but we are still paying customers who deserve to be treated just as well as your drinking and drunk customers! This will not stop me from doing our date night thing. But this was our Anniversary!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park
Ryane O.,"Fullerton, CA",196,237,418,2.0,7/31/2017,"Our waitress was nice enough and the proximity to Knott's was good but thats about where the positive stuff ends. This location is operated by Knott's and the pricing definitely reflects that. Whatever specials that you see or hear in advertisements arent going on over here. Also the menu is limited and condensed and doesnt offer a wide variety of options as your standard TGIFridays. My biggest gripe was that there was a small hair on a piece of cucumber in my little side salad. I didnt notice it until about halfway through. I informed our waitress, and they replaced my salad with a new one which looked 10x better which was cool I guess but I was just apprehensive about finding more mystery hairs. And I dont even like cucumber to begin with. They offer a 10%-20% discount for Knott's passholders (depending on what pass you have). That was actually really handy because again, the pricing here is a little above what other locations use.  They are literally right next to the Knott's theme park, so we ate here because it was on the way out to our cars. So yeah the closeness is convenient but in retrospect I'm not sure that overspending $100 on mediocre food was really worth it. Oh, their AC is really good too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park
Rita C.,"Lawndale, CA",0,16,3,1.0,11/10/2017,Unacceptable. Waited an hour for our food. My salad arrived 15 minutes before my boyfriends meal. I also had to ask twice for my breadstick.

Sohee X.,"Irvine, CA",61,24,3,4.0,12/23/2017,"This is a good location with good vibes and decoration. The serves and bartenders are friendly but doesn't really approach you unless you ask. The problem is management. There are empty tables everywhere but still a line and a wait. They need more servers or servers who will take on more tables. They need to be more efficient about this bc how can a location be empty with a wait on the day before Christmas eve located IN Knotts Berry Farm. It should be PACKED with a wait, not empty with the wait. The food is on a the good side, definitely not bad.

Juan M.,"Montclair, CA",111,302,214,3.0,4/11/2017,"I'll admit that I haven't been to a TGI Fridays in while, but I think the prices are marked up here by a few bucks because Knott's owns this one. I've seen a lot of one and two star reviews here, and I'm a little shocked. Okay, not too shocked, but I honestly don't know what people expect from a chain restaurant owned by a theme park, that, duh, is obviously outside of a theme park. I think that maybe, people are expecting too much, and should have been prepared for some of the main points that people have been hitting on like drink prices, seating, and wait times. We went this past Thursday, and here is what I have concluded: 1) Appetizers are overpriced for sure. Almost $20 for the wings, cheese stick and potato boat sampler. Split between 4 of us, it equaled one item from each for each of us, with the exception of the boneless buffalo wings, which were somewhere between the size of popcorn shrimp and a chicken nugget. I will admit that the wings were moist and actually had some flavor, that the cheese sticks were good as were the potato boat things. HOWEVER, they must've been baby potatoes, because they were small! LOL. 2) My bacon cheeseburger was actually outstanding (thick and cooked the way I wanted it), BUT, the cheese was a little weird. Not sure if it was imitation or something, but it was melted, but the cheese and the oil were actually like separated and kind of reminded me of the way candle wax looks when it is melted and drips all over the place. Half liquid, half waxy? I don't know but it was certainly a thing that made me go hmmmmmmmmmm. 3) Rosemary was a decent server. Replaced my Sprite right away because it tasted like Alka Seltzer, and got us everything we needed when we flagged her down for it. 4) If you are Knott's season pass holder, you rate a 10% discount so make sure you mention it. 5) They didn't offer the $10 AYCE appetizers......... : ( Overall, ours wasn't a bad dining experience, but that is probably because we knew what to expect. If you don't feel like eating inside the park, this is a very doable option, so long as you don't go in expecting too much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park

Daisy G.,"Moreno Valley, CA",1,24,4,2.0,11/4/2017,"We just left this location, and I have to say I was very disappointed with the staff. When we walked in the hosts and two other employees were just standing around and talking and goofing.  Didn't even greet us at all, one of the employees was drinking something out of a clear bottle.  We sat down and the rude hosts informed us they didn't have any kids menu, Okay no biggie at all.  We were finally greeted by CHRIS, my boys were sitting down playing on the table, and he seemed very annoyed that they were touching the sugars. And he even told me to not let them touch it. I told him that I would fix the sugars and that they wouldn't open them, and that he didn't have to worry.  He gave me an ugly look and walked Away. He finally came back and we were ordering and again he was rude, talked to us like we were beneath him. The place wasn't busy at all, but yet it took 30 min to get our kids pasta.  Not once did he ask if we wanted more water etc.  He isn't a good waiter at all, he gives short answers, and makes faces. Doesn't seem to like children at all, which is fine, but if you're going to be a waiter at a family restaurant, you need to be friendly towards kids. We had to ask a bus boy if he would give us to go boxes, since our server was lost for about 35 minutes.  When we left the host and the same guy that was drinking from the clear bottle were at it again, talking and goofing off, they didn't even acknowledge us. Other than that the food was great! But sadly we're giving 2 stars because of the way the staff acted as soon as we walked through the door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park

The thing about Fridays is, Its a chain. And we all know chain food is inconsistent and never looks like the picture.  Call me spoiled but I have perfected chicken and steak in my kitchen.  I am usually disappointed when I order it off a menu because I can do better. This, was no exception, to the food tonight either.  I am also not a big drinker  so the extended faucets of booze here never entice me at TGIF. Service was attentive tonight. Our waitress was sweet and delivered our meal to our table quickly and was on top of our drink refills. She had her area packed with a few large parties, and she never forgot us little folk. Price wise, dinner for 2, without any appetizers was about $40. Which to me is kind of pricey for what I had. My chicken and cheese was about $17.00 and cost about $3.00 to make. My thin pieces of chicken were dry and unflavored, cheese was burnt on the skillet and the mashed potatoes were instant. It was just okay. The Rueban the hubsters said was decent, but could of used more meat. His sweet potato fries were frozen to the fryer and not very crispy. Parking here is a major Pain in the Bootie. You have to rely on the traffic guards to let you enter the lot at Knotts and you have watch for the zillion million tourists that flock in the lot, who don't pay attention where they walk. Lalalalalala. The restaurant  does not validate, but your receipt is proof enough for the gate keepers, and then its free to park for a couple of hours. TGIF, is just okay. Maybe its another story during Happy Hour. If you have a large party they can accommodate you easily. I am not a fan of Fridays.

Abby W.,"San Diego, CA",1489,972,759,2.0,4/19/2015,"Well this is an occasion that I wish I had taken the time to read the Yelp reviews before deciding to leave Knotts for a bite across the street at TGI Friday's. Yelp says it's a 2 star experience and I have to agree. The main reason we chose to leave Knotts was that we wanted to find a cheaper beer than the $11 option in the park. We did succeed on this part of the mission as the beers were cheaper at TGI Friday's. Unfortunately, the food was very mediocre. We ordered the beer cheese pretzels and two side salads. The salads were quite tiny and topped with a few tomatoes, cucumbers and croutons. The salad dressing was drizzled across the top and I had to ask for an extra side of ranch, which was just okay in flavor. At first we thought we had ordered the dinner salads, which were priced at $8 and we were super disappointed but when the bill came it turns out we had side salads at $4 instead so it wasn't quite as bad. We forgot to order the beer cheese pretzels without the bacon topping (my guy is a vegetarian and I don't eat pig) so we had to scoop that bacon off the top. Not sure if the slight bacon flavor tainted our experience with the cheese dip or if it just has a strange smoky flavor to begin with but we weren't very impressed. The quantity is also lacking and we ran out of dip before finishing our pretzels.  Basically, I'd only return here for drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=40
Lupe D.,"Huntington Park, CA",0,13,2,1.0,6/19/2017,Won't come back here. I think McDonalds tops it better. The server all cared about was to count his tips and left us waiting for 5-8 min. So I got up to use the restroom came back and still ignore me. He said I'll be with you in a minute. I had to get another server because it's just not all there. No wonder this location doesn't have good stars. Cocktails suck. Just syrup with water and overpriced. Ruined my first day of vacation.

Lynnette Z.,"Torrance, CA",47,14,7,2.0,10/30/2016,"We came to TGIF before we went to haunt thinking it would be easier to have dinner and walk towards the entrance afterwards . I think if we could do it again , we would definitely prefer eating elsewhere and driving to the park. The line was insanely long just to get your name on the list. Luckily people in our party got there early and didn't have to wait. Just to get in , it was completely disorganized people were just standing around blocking the walkway and not letting people in or out. Just completely crowded and the hostesses just looked frazzled. Anywho, we were a larger party, a group of 9 and had one server. We ordered 2 appetizers, a round of water and drinks. Half of us got water, the other half waited around for about another 20 mins for their water and the rest of us were done with our waters and don't get refills. Our drinks took about 30 minutes to get to us, along with our appetizers. Our drink order was wrong and we didn't even get all the drinks at the same time. Different people came by to give us or drinks and we repeatedly asked for more water, at this point we just asked if we could get a pitcher for the table, and for the missing beverages. Finally, everyone had a drink, their correct drink at that and we got to order our food.  The food itself was good. 3 people in my group got old fries, which were replaced. Our waiter oscar, ehh, was mediocre at best! Very dry, not personable and definitely not attentive. Justin who wasn't even assigned to us was more efficient that oscar. Really seemed like he didn't even want to be bothered by us. Justin is the one who brought us the pitcher of water, plates for our appetizers and napkins. Go Justin! We literally got our appetizers and didn't get plates for like 5 mins . We all had started eating on napkins  . Our utensils that we're given to us alll had lipstick on them. All 9 of them. We mentioned it to a server and they just kind of brushed it off and we asked for new napkins. However, my drink was delicious.  a big shout out to the bartender that made awesome drinks! They toook fooreveerrr  but they were really good. I had a jack and ginger and it was delicious! A member from our group had a frozen strawberry margarita and it was amazing as well. So that increased stars for me . However, the prices for drinks are ridiculously much higher than any other TGIF. All in all, I see why this place only has a 2 star rating . We should of yelped this place before going . We thought we couldn't go wrong with Friday's but I guess the location matters. Won't be returning due to bad customer service. There are good people that work there but overall it wasn't anything special that makes me want to come back to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=40

Took a long time to get water.  They did not have clean utensils and told us we had to wait until they washed some.  Our food was delivered but only 3 out of 6 of us had forks to eat.  20 minutes after our food came, we got more forks.  I ordered the shrimp and chicken pasta but not a single shrimp to be food.  They took the plate to ""remake"" it but honestly it was bought back 15 minutes later cold with 3 shrimp.  My husband hated his food and returned it to the waitress.  The manager never came to ask about it. Over all it took 60 minutes to get all the food.  Of course nobody ate at the same time because we didn't all have forks or the food wasn't right.  Plus we got 1 refill of water after 45 minutes and she couldn't remember whose glass was whose so she just gave them out randomly.  It was $98 for horrible food, bad service and no damn forks!

Any specials you see advertised on TV will never be available here. Endless apps? Nope. But you can order boneless buffalo wings for $13. Long Island ice tea? $13. A regular burger? $17. My fiancé and I had a drink each, I ordered buffalo wings and he had a burger and the bill came out to $59. With tip, because our server was very good, it ended up being $71 in total. I don't care about the tip because she very well deserved it, but $13 for boneless wings that were nothing special (I mean it's chicken nuggets tossed in buffalo sauce) is outrageous. I was livid. You might as well go down the street to Outback. Much better food for a better deal. Needless to say, although this TGI is so close to us, we will NEVER go here again.

Captain B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,5,4,1.0,9/29/2016,"We had lunch here on 9-22-16, 1pm. Only 4 tables taken ( including the bar), The Orange and CM locations are usually packed. This was a bad sign.      The food was low-quality, poor value, unhealthy and expensive for what is served. We had 2 different entree's of shrimp, at $17.59 each. I got 10 small, heavily battered, over cooked ( hard) shrimp that was loaded/packed with salt, served with salty fries. Highest level of sodium in shrimp I've had. The other tasted a little better, also heavily salted. We tossed the leftovers in the trash when we got home.       My cocktail was weak, probably 1/2 the strength of a normal drink, filled with ice for only $9.00, and a coke was $4.29. The menu is smaller here, and less cocktails offered than other TGIF locations.       Some of the windows and wall displays were smeared with food, drink, sticky hand prints ( check the bat mobile photo on the corner wall- it can hardly be seen). Restroom door sticky and gross. Actual restroom was clean and well designed, which is how they earned 1 star. I over tipped the waitress, service was ok/good. Would never go here again unless I needed a drink while at knott's or the haunt.      We went to TGIF twice this month to get the Tiki Drinks/Mugs summer promotions. Neither the Orange or BP locations were participating! So we spent over $90.00 to get no tiki's at all.

I still smiled and said that's my daughter's name without a ""p""! I was given a receipt after I ordered corona extra because it's cheapest $8/bottle I called the manager Mirium and she gave me the regular speech from Knotts trainers: that is our company policy to give bar customers who sit on the rim the receipts immediately after drinks were delivered beside a lot of customers just walked out without paying I said: just because 10% or 30% of your customers did that so you treated all of us like that? Why that popular newest restaurant across street didn't have the same practice?"" Mirium: ""I'll let the management know."" I: "" once you gave me those words such as policy, management, customers will not help you any more."" The only happy server was that raisin bread clerk who asked, ""do you need me to cut this bread for you?"" You, the public, be the judge, is Knotts service better than that popular amusement park in Anaheim or not? It's my home town so I kept my tax dollars here. Shall I go across the street?  After I finished my review, I noticed that there's no straw provided. I had to ask 2nd server to give me a straw. Does a new customer deserve this kind of treatment?

You will see that I don't really give bad ones I only let people know about the good ones but this place deserves a negative rating. 1- star is too much. I'm the easiest and kindest most respectful customer to a restaurant because I own one and I know how it goes.  First, they sat us on a table that was dirty and was not even cleared all the way.  It took the server 15min to clean it up and it was a 4- seater. She took our drink order and rushed to leave. It was slow by the way... Then came back to take our order 20min later. She forgot the 1- beer we ordered but remembered the waters that where served in a dirty glass. Our food was sent out scattered and still no silver ware or plates for us to dig in. I was there with my sister my 5- year old son and 9 year old nephew. Every one of us where starving. My son watched his already cold Mac and cheese get colder and we did the same on everything else. The spinach dip came out with dry crust around the edges like it was sitting there for an hour or so. I sent that back and said just give me the bill. I had to ask 3-4 other waitresses to assist because ours never came by.  52 bucks later with only 3-appetizer ordered and 1-1/2 wait I was just so mad but stayed calm.  There is more but I'm getting pist off just thinking about it.  Service sucked, Food sucked,  Place was dirty,  And way too expensive and I'm a spender when I want to eat. I did not order food because the appetizers took wayyyyy toooo looong to come out.  I assure you I will never enter this TGIF or any other location.

Janine P.,"Whittier, CA",0,13,,1.0,8/29/2016,"We've been to this location a few times. It has a limited menu compared to other TGI Fridays and is usually slow (ie few customers). We like TGI Fridays and this one is located right down the street, so we really wanted to like this one, but after our last experience we're not going back.  We sat in the bar area. There were 5 sometimes 6 employees in the bar area, but only 1 actually serving. I've worked in a restaurant, I realize not anyone can or should just take your order, but they have to realize it looks pretty bad when there are that many employees around and literally no one is helping or paying any attention to customers. There was one other table and no one sitting at the bar. We waited for about 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. It truly was kind of bizarre as it's an open area and we can very clearly see all of them and they can very clearly see us. Our server, who had been present in the bar area the whole time, finally told us he'd be right with us... but he lied. Instead he messed around behind the bar for a little longer (not making drinks or anything), chatted with a female co-worker for a minute, and then went over and chatted with the other table. And I don't mean he just checked on them, made brief small talk, and came to us. I mean he hung out, leaned against the other booth, and talked casually for several minutes. When he finally did head over to us, my boyfriend joked to me that he should make a joke about it being busy (place was dead), but didn't actually have a chance to because our server actually, seriously, used the excuse that he was busy and blamed it on the fact that he was the only one serving (in the bar, not the whole restaurant). I wonder if he thought we couldn't see him the whole time we'd been sitting there? Because we could.  We ordered two beers, waters, and an appetizer. He asked if we wanted to order anything else. We told him we would order when the appetizer came because we wanted that first. He then explained to us that the purpose of an appetizer was that it came first (thank you, kind sir, for defining the term for us), and assured us we could order everything at once. We orderd that way because of the last time we were there; my boyfriend wanted to order the appetizer first and then our meal to make sure it didn't come at once, but I assured him that they would, in fact, know the definition of ""appetizer"" and would bring it first. I was wrong. It all came at once. So this time, we ordered separate.   We got our beers. Mine tasted dirty. I don't know if it was the glass or their taps, but it tasted dirty. He didn't bring waters. Someone brought us our appetizer. I love spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer and convinced my boyfriend to get it even though it isn't something he normally likes. It kinda sucked. It was too salty and was served with salted tortilla chips. $12 for a small bowl of dip and a handful of tortilla chips. What we got I would expect to maybe be $6-7, it was kinda ridiculous. Then came the fun of trying to get our server's attention so we could order our sandwich. But he ignored us. He knew we had our appetizer and knew we wanted order when it came. I'm not sure if he thought he was making a point about the appetizer thing? Again, he wasn't helping anyone else, still no one there but the one other table and he wasn't helping them either. At one point he was standing about 10 feet from us behind the bar, facing our direction, so we tried to get his attention by waving and calling out to him. He turned and walked the other direction. There is no way he didn't hear us. It was quiet. The one table at the other end of the room probably heard us. One of his co-workers even looked at him weird and then looked over at us, and back at him as he walked away.  We were never rude to him, we hadn't complained about anything, we hadn't even bothered with our passive aggressive joke about being busy.   We eventually got our sandwich. Which is where we finally complained. We got the chicken club (lettuce, tomato, cheese, chicken, avocado & bacon on a baguette). For the meat, one half of the sandwich had two very small slices of a chicken breast and a half piece of bacon. Pretty skimpy, covered slightly more than half the bread, but could be tolerable. The other half had one single thin slice of chicken that covered maybe 1/4 of the bread, and a few bacon bits. After trying unsuccessfully to get our servers attention, we flagged down the closest person, showed her the sandwich, and asked for her help. She got a manager who then brought us more chicken in a bowl. $15 for a sandwich and it was served with half a chicken breast (and that's being generous). Our server was behind the bar not helping people this whole time but seemed unconcerned.  We asked for water again, finally got it and one glass was dirty. A different server offered and got my boyfriend a second beer while our server, as usual, stood behind the bar. Our bill was $60.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=80

I don't mind paying for a good meal, so if the food was good, the prices wouldn't have bothered me. But the food was TERRIBLE! My French fries tasted old, and I asked for the sauce on my burger on the side. When they brought it to me, it had a crust on the top. Gross. When we ordered our kids drinks, we ordered them from the drinks that aren't included in the kids meal because the menu is deceiving!  And when we asked our waitress for new drinks and told her we had made a mistake, she had an attitude. The service was bad as well. We waited forever for our food and our experience was so terrible that we wanted to get out, but our check took forever as well!

Joshua H.,"Villa Park, CA",184,5,,1.0,2/11/2016,"Wow. Where do I start? Let me first say this is my 2nd (possibly 3rd review) in the many, many years that I use Yelp. I have one policy when it comes to reviews: the experience has to be so rare that it deserves mentioning. It can be good, but in this case it is most certainly bad. Let us start with the service or severe lack thereof. We came at around 2 PM on a Saturday while at Knotts. We wanted something with more substance (ha!) and the 3 hostesses showed us to our table. It took 25+ minutes for the server to arrive at our table. My friend had to tell the waiter we were here first when he went to the table next to ours.  About 45 minutes into our experience, we finally order. I received my food (Jack Daniels Sliders) about 5 minutes after ordering. It was cold and the quality was very low. I have never in my life asked for food to be taken back. It was that bad. That evening I got severely ill. I cannot necessarily blame this on the food as I did go on roller coasters afterwards, but I am an experienced theme park visitor and have never encountered this issue. The only thing different about the typical day - TGI's ""food."" At the end of the day, I ended up splitting the bill with 3 other friends and paying $40 for 2 beers. I hate this place.

DannyJackie H.,"Winchester, CA",66,2,,1.0,10/2/2017,Went to dinner before hitting knotts scary farm. We got there around 5. Hostess told us about 10 min wait. We waited about 25 mins. Our waitress didnt come till almost 545... Was not friendly at all. Didnt get our drinks til almost 615.. At this time we were all very annoyed because we had to leave by 7. We watched her walked by many times. Not once did she asked if we needed refills or anything else. We finally got up to talk to a manager. She came by around 645 and we told her we wanted to cancel our order and just get our bill. She told us even if we did cancel our order and didnt eat she would still charge us for the food. She said they were very busy. There wasnt that many people even in the restaurant. I have worked in the food industry and that was NOT busy at all. Our food came about 6:55. Soup was cold. Chicken on salads was cold. She brought the bill . Didnt give us our discount for being pass holders. When we told her she got mad and told us why didnt we remind her and now she would have to go back and re do our bill and get my card authorized. Like it was such a HASSLE for her... Didnt even bother to do a discount for the wait. Nothing. Very rude . I will not be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=60

BIG Mistake! We sat at the bar since there were seats available & we didn't want to wait an hour to be seated in the dining area. It took at least 20 mins to get menus. When the bartender came over we all asked for water, silverware & napkins. We got the water, but no silverware/napkins. Once we ordered, the food came out fairly quickly, but the Jack Daniels chicken sandwich was tough & the BBQ chicken flatbread pizza barely had any toppings- very dry. We again had to ask for silverware/napkins, as well as ranch which we never received... not to mention, the bartender never once  asked if we needed refills on our water. We ended up asking another employee who happened to be ringing up another parties bill to refill our glasses, which she kindly did.  We've eaten at our local TGIF many times- the food & service has always been great! Don't think we'll be visiting the Knott's location again.

So for me to give this place a low rating is difficult but this place makes it very easy for me to rate them a low rating. First of all, this place is EXPENSIVE. Since it's on the Knott's Berry Farm property, it gives them the right to UP their prices up, which I was open for. Besides me and some other guy siting at the bar, there was no one else ordering anything from the bar. I ordered a drink and it took them a few minutes for them to bring me a drink. Heck, my appetizers came out faster than my drink. The bartenders seemed to be a bit distracted but remained friendly. Only cool thing about this Friday's location is that they have a cool decor set up. I racked up a $50 bill just for a few drinks which I would of payed half of that at my regular TGIF location with tip included but oh well. Overall experience was alright. Would I be back? Sure.

We were so dissatisfied with his effort that we decided not to leave a tip.

The steak was super fatty and bland in flavor considering the price was $25 half the steak was well done the other half medium.  The steak tasted like ground hamburger meat with no seasoning.

He regretted ordering it but drank anyways. I mentioned to waitress half way through his drink, and she was willing to bring something else out. She was a total doll her name was Gina. But, bro settled for a water.  We ordered the green fingers aka ""Crispy Green Bean Fries."" The green fingers were too oily for me. We ordered two appetizer bbq chicken pizzas without chicken. A lovely big fat hamburger for bestie that came with a huge side of fries. All I can say is my bbq chicken pizza without meat was bomb. I shared one slice with bestie and the rest was gobbled. I loved that it was thin crust, the combo of the bbq flavor, cheese, onions, and cilantro was insane.  I loved loved loved the interior decor. They played 80s best! The service was super friendly.

When we got our food I saw that their  salad had more chicken than lettuce. There was tons of dressing and it was served on a small plate. I just wanted a fresh salad. It wasn't that great. My mom ordered a steak lunch and wasn't that excited about it either. My niece didn't complain she enjoyed her fries.  Overall, I thought the service was excellent but the food was  :/ .

Mia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,354,319,2.0,10/27/2016,"Soda is $4.29! Plus this steep price is absent on the menu. Refills only on iced tea. My friends have a season pass to Knotts Berry Farm and get a 10% discount here. But our server, who we later found out was new, did not ask if we have a season pass. We were inconvenienced in coming back later for the discount. Being new is no excuse.  Overall service was ok. I was only one in party who needed more time to decide. Our waiter said he'd come back for me. We had to ask for him to come back. However, he did check in with us on our food twice. Kids meals - 2 cheese burgers are like mini sliders, with a huge serving of fries, enough for 2 people. Fries were good, not too salty. But the fries and huge turkey burger on the kids' menu made me wonder if TGIF aims to promote childhood obesity.   The chicken fingers and fries, and deep fried shrimp with fries entrees looked standard. The shrimp were heavily battered.   I wish they had a lite menu like BJ's other similar franchise restaurants. A ""healthier"" salad option had about 660 calories. Prices are high for what you get although I did like my parmesan crusted chicken breast. Moist with mozzarella and cherry tomato fresh basil and purple onion salad. It came with a big side of mac and cheese, topped with bread crumbs. But I think my meal upset my stomach in evening. This is a nice place to eat in, with walls decorated cool w rock album covers in entrance and miscalaneous pop culture stuff on the walls. Definitely better looking than Red Robin. The A/C was on too high. Clean bathroom. Nice looking bar. Cool display of walk of spirits as you walk to the restrooms.  I think I'd rate this place and my experience 2 stars. 3 if not for the pricey soda with no refills and the inconvenience of going back for our significant $12 discount. Good thing the bill adjustment didn't take long cuz otherwise we would have left.

I was very specific in telling my waitress Surena how I wanted my Cheeseburger WELL DONE, no blood. I don't like blood in my meat. Give it back to the farm if there is going to be blood in the meat (for ME). It REALLY UPSETS ME when there is blood in my (meat) BEEF when I tell the server NO BLOOD. The chef must not have intaked my request. It was 70/30 with blood and well-done. I told Surena of my dissatisfaction of my lunch. She was EXCELLENT with serving the consumers during my time here. The alcoholic beverages were alright; average.... I asked for my 'Gin & Juice' strong and light on the rocks. The bar tender (s) needs improvement. Overall, this is not a TGI Fridays I would recommend to consumers whom are familiar with the brand.

Barely any refill or attention from our waitress.  The food got there all cold like it's been sitting for a while. And you can tell it had been bc the avocado was turning brown. The buns were stale and overly toasted. My cousin ordered a tea and the outside of the cup was slimy and it slipped off her hand and got everywhere. Which will probably stain her clothes. I would expect for the 80 dollars we spent we could at least get our waitress to clean the cups, make sure that our food is warm, etc. Bad experience!!

We left and check the transaction of the gift card and you could see that she charged it. Thankfully the manager (which was kinda careless) got the refund back but it was just 3 hours off our life that we could have had a better experience at a McDonald's .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=20

A 22 Oz blue moon draft is 12.60 dollars plus tax and with tip?? About 15 bucks for just a beer. Ridiculous. Corona light bottle 12 ounce is 8 bucks plus tax and fees.

Bottom line:  we would NEVER eat at this place again.  The service reminds me of The Hard Rock Cafe in Hollywood, nothing special because they know most of these people won't be back until the next time they're in town on vacation.  If they come back, at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=160

Amber S.,"Lakewood, CA",9,29,44,1.0,10/17/2015,"I would give 0 stars if I could. Absolutely everything about this location is ridiculous. First of all their phone number was busy everytime I tried to call before I got there to ask about the wait. Me and my boyfriend were attending the Halloween haunt at Knotts tonight and we wanted some food and drinks before so we came here (I was celebrating my birthday). We put our name down and eventually found a spot in the corner of the bar and sat there and asked for menus and they cleaned our table- never brought menus and waitress never came back for at least 5-10 minutes. I asked the front desk for menus instead. Then with still no service we found a spot at the actual bartop after some people left and moved there. We noticed the food prices were much higher than our local TGI Fridays (at the long beach towne center). We regretted not going to the one by our house instead. Also there is no happy hour at this location. Their price gouging was not the only turn off, but also the service we were getting at the bartop. The bartender asked for our IDs and then saw we had menus and asked immediately for a debit or credit card to open a tab for us even though we hadn't ordered anything yet. I asked him if I could see an additional drink menu (besides those listed on the food menu) and something that might have prices and he replied with unnecessary sass and said ""restaurants do not ever have prices for drinks listed"". And I thought that was strange because I work at a restaurant in Lakewood, CA and we definitely have all drink prices listed on our menu. Also the over TGI Fridays location has a booklet of drinks and at the end there is a list of prices. My boyfriend ordered an Oktoberfest Sam Adams and the bartender said it would be over $13!!! We told him nevermind. ((It was cheaper to buy that same beer inside the actual theme park, Knotts berry farm!!)) The waitor then responded with ""well you guys are at a theme park on a busy Friday night during an event."" Which I thought was rude and condescending. I understand it's a busy night and Im next to a theme park but I do not understand the attitude and lacking of attentive staff in the bar.  I can't believe anyone actually eats at this TGI Fridays. My boyfriend and I ended up walking to Claim Jumper and had a delicious dinner and awesome happy hour priced drinks and some appetizers.  Overall extremely disappointed with this service at this TGI Fridays and will NEVER be returning- definitely sticking to my local location and staff back at home.

I came to this location years ago when they first opened and it was great. I had a second visit a few years ago, and it was still pretty good except for the service. I guess that's why I hadn't come back until 9/15/2014. The hubs and I came in for a bite after catching a movie, since we had some gift cards left over from Christmas that we still hadn't spent. I should have known to turn and walk away immediately after entering because the place was dead. There were a few people who were obviously tourists, but it was just dead. The service was okay, nothing spectacular (though you think it would be given that we were some of the ONLY customers, but whatever).  My big issue is with the food. The menu is super limited in comparison to other TGI Friday's locations, and they jack up the prices big time. I ordered one of the cheaper items on the menu: a French dip sandwich for $12.50. It came with a small (and I mean small) salad on the side, which was the best part of the whole thing. The sandwich itself was just nasty. The au jus was just salt and no flavor, the meat was dry and crappy (though they claim it's prime rib). It was just....blah. The hubs got some burger that he said was ""just okay"" which came with the tiniest portion of fries ever. Our bill was about $35. In retrospect, it would have been better just to stay around the mall and grab food at one of the establishments there, because then I would have at least gotten my money's worth.

He was SO nice, said the patio is quiet, and they would even turn the music down for me! The girl  who seated me was super sweet too. My server was wonderful and attentive, and even another server came out several times to see if I needed anything. Then to top it all off, I left my Kindle tablet there and didn't realize it. The manager emailed me to let me know she had it and would keep it in the safe until I could come get it. Customer for life!

Waited another 10 min. The 2 next to us had already asked if they could order something and didn't get acknowledged.  They left.   Finally someone else walked up to us and puts napkins down on the bar, asks us if we wanted menus which we did, then she nonchalantly walks over to get the menus, hands them to us and then walks away!!! Ummmm why did you put napkins down if you weren't going to take our drink order?!  Mind you, yes this is on a Friday night and all the tables were pretty full. But a little acknowledgement goes a long way.  I get it, it's cold season, maybe they had call outs, maybe..... whatever.  I am trying to give them the benefit of the doubt but seriously.  Ridiculous.  We walked out.

Our service was horrible from the start, not to mention the ridiculously high priced food at this TGIF. The food was skimpy and lacking freshness and menu options seem like they have only a few items for lunch and dinner that are priced double the regular TGIF price. The nachos my husband and I ordered were 5 mini tostadas with dried black beans and pico de gallo I was so embarrassed for this place. We also didn't get silverware and napkins till we were done eating. Don't waste your money or time going here it's a rip off and you'll be disappointed.

I actually went to an area at the bar to get my own water when a female employee showed up and she was nice and helped me. Like many have said food is ridiculously over priced. It is a tourist area and expensive is expected but this should be illegal. They will place a surcharge on appetizers if that is what you chose for your meal. I noticed a lot of California club sandwiches coming out, mainly because at 13 bucks its one of the cheapest things on the menu. And like my experience here this sandwich also sucked. I sh it you not these things were exactly like the kind of food I got at the park for free when I was a kid. Also reminds me of jail food (dont ask).

The servers made up for it (kinda) by providing us with a free large fry, but...also prices are wayyy higher than a typical TGI Fridays and we left the park to go there expecting cheaper prices than the restaurants in the park. Turns out it's owned by Knotts and is still just as much money!! Oh well.

For the sampler we chose boneless wings, pot stickers and (loaded) potato skins. What we received was NOT worth $20 dollars. The pot stickers were the best thing about the sampler while the potato skins were overly fried fries with dried out cheese and bacon (how is that loaded?) The boneless wings were umf, very small pieces of chicken. We also had two drinks, the first one was incorrect and when we pointed it out they took it back. Instead of waste it, wouldn't they just offer it as gesture of their mistake? Everyone was correct who pointed out the terrible service. The guy started out as pleasant but that quickly faded as we waited 5 minutes for a beer on tap, ten minutes for my cocktail and then having to explain the beer was wrong.

Ok we get seated. We're waiting for our server to come take our drink orders....almost 20 minutes later and I go to the host stand to ask for our server to come take our order. In the meantime I hear the table behind us mention no one has been to take their order either. Well finally a hostess comes over and gets our drink order, however she is not 21 so she can not bring us our beer. Now some male server comes and apologies for the inconvenience that our server went on break and he would take care of us....huh...Ok if our server went to break why would you seat us in that section?!? We put our order in. Get our beers (Sam Adams Cold Snap) and they do not taste like Cold snap. We drink it pretty often. We ordered an app to Start with the Pretzels with beer cheese, now mind you again I work for TGI Fridays and have eaten the pretzels many times, the beer cheese....omg smh was HORRIBLE. Absolutely disturbing. It was BROWN and chunky and tasted like it had been sitting for 2 days or more. In the mean time waiting for our food we've gone through 3 different servers plus a host. We mention the pretzels cheese to the server who tells the manager and they offer us a dessert which we decline. Now the server who should have been our server in the first place that was on break and they sat us in her section while she was on break comes to our table to let us know she was going to be taking care of us and if we needed anything, yes the check please. $85.00 later and no tip for any of the 4/5 different servers/host who came to our table, never ever will we eat there again.

I ordered the bourbon chicken to share with my toddler. I asked for an extra plate but never got one.

This location clearly doesn't care about their negative reviews bc they are right outside of Knott's and people will still go to their restaurant. A formal complaint to corporate is coming though.... We had a large group. Have gone every year. It's tradition. Left the park at about 2:00pm to put in our 6:30 pm reservation like we've done every year. Was told ""we take RSVP's 24 hrs in advance"". Really? I was given the option to put my name in and wait outside the restaurant for 2 hours. Made absolutely NO SENSE! Told them it was a group of 17 to give them the courtesy of having time to set things up and it was like they immediately didn't even want to deal with us. Asked to speak to a manager. The nervous male host went and talked to a manager and she didn't even have the professionalism to come talk to us. She sent this poor kid back up to tell us. I asked for the managers name and the dark skinned female host laughed like it was a joke. Note to you sweetheart- good way to start a conflict that you clearly can't handle.  Keep your smirks to yourself. So to whatever manager was working ""Miriam"" or ""Alaina"" your managing skills are lacking and you really should look into more training or a different profession!

I assume something happened where my card was dropped or something. The check came, I gave him my card, I received two receipts with no card in the card holder.

I had the spicy beer burger and it was okay the spicy was a few jalapenos , and my girl had a salad .  It was a run of the mill chain restaurant meal .

Eugene S.,"Anaheim, CA",25,154,18,1.0,7/31/2012,"Well, this place certainly sucks. Actually, I already knew that from a previous visit. However, I found (yes, literally FOUND) a $25 gift card and since this place is around the corner from my home, I thought we would try again. Arrived at 5:30 on a Monday night, found very close parking, no wait, got a seat immediately. So far, so good. Screaming children at every table, it seemed... but that's not the restaurant's fault. I ordered a burger & fries. Fries had been sitting for a long time somewhere, as they were shriveled and served at room temperature. Burger was nothing special either.  My partner ordered some sort of salad with breaded chicken, but apparently they mean DREADED chicken... the chicken in the salad was hard, dry and really not edible. He picked around it and ate the greens in the salad.  Both meals were crap. I would NEVER let that type of thing leave my kitchen if this were my place. I can see no one here gives a damn about what they're serving. I would have pushed the issue and complained if I had not had that free gift card. The tip we left for  service was earned by our server by being nice, but food like that should be free to all, like the government cheese program, or the food you get while in prison.

Dede W.,"Anaheim, CA",0,40,1,1.0,1/23/2015,"ARE YOU KIDDING ME? $81 for two small dinners, and 4 beers!  There are too many great places you can go to for much less! Like The Ranch in Anaheim, or Walt's Wharf in Seal Beach! Anywhere but here, especially if you're local and know the area. I don't mind paying, but don't want to be abused as I'm giving my business to someone! After seeing the recent commercials on TV, my husband and I thought we'd head to TGIFriday's last night. I asked the server about the specials we'd seen and he informed us that this particular location doesn't honor or offer any of the specials. We decided to stay regardless. I asked about a couple of the rib eye plates they offered. Our server said he thought the sirloin items were better. We order and had a really good dinner, very flavorful. If anything the portions were a bit smaller than I'd expected, but that was fine, as it was really good. We paid $20 each for our plates (which is the advertised $10 special we went in for). My husband had two draft beers (Coors light) and I had two Miller lights. We were absolutely floored when we got our bill... $81 and change! They charged $21 and change for two coors on draft, and $13 and change for two bottles of Miller. AMAZING! $34 for 4 beers at TGIFriday's... are you kidding me? To say they over-charge is an understatement. As a local, with this place under 2 miles from me, it could be decent place to grab dinner. But no. I can't imagine charging the prices they do!  You might be saying we should have noticed the price of the beer. We honestly didn't look. Because WHO WOULD THINK they would charge the exorbitant prices they do? NOT ME!  Big. fat. FAIL!  I asked why the beer was so expensive and was told that Knott's franchises with TGIFriday and so Knott's sets the prices, and doesn't honor (or opts out of) the chain specials.  No wonder this place is empty! Needless to say we won't be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=300

His exact words were, ""I made this one extra strong since I almost killed you."" Then we asked if he shook the martini with the same ice and he reluctantly said yes and asked if we wanted another but we ordered a beer instead. Worse part was that this bartender didn't start to clean out the well until after we mentioned the martini. A manager never came over to see us, she merely comped the martini and charged us for everything else. No one in the bar seemed to be surprised that there was an issue with our drinks nor did the manager seem fazed by the situation. I've never had any kind of problems with any other Friday's.

We were the first people in the restaurant and everyone else received their food first. Oscar was extremely forgetful, we asked him 3 times for extra fries.

Several mins later the spaghetti came which is their specialty as you will see.  So even after waiting forever for our food, the waitress never refilled our drinks.  Where was the ranch dressing for our now cold fries?  Well it arrived after my kids finished their fries, needless to say.   OK so back to the spaghetti. So I began cutting the noodles so my daughter could manage the spaghetti...As I lifted some spaghetti from her bowl, my other daughter screams"" Oh my God their is blonde hair in your spaghetti!""  Fortunately, the other customers heard it and responded with similar disgust.  Yes! nasty as can be! a long, thin blonde hair stretched out about six inches from the fork to the bowl.  Clinging to the hair and making it visible to see in the poor lighting were tomato sauce and little bits of spaghetti. Keep in mind everyone at our table has dark brown to black thick hair so TGI could not say it was ours. So of course no waitress ...so I approached the hostess and told her that I needed to the manager regarding the blonde hair in my daughters spaghetti. So,  she said she would get the manager, and walked away.  20 mins later she walked up to me asked if the manager spoke to me.  Needless to say the answer was NO.   She  disappeared ...again. 20 Mins later  the manager showed up .  This is also when the ranch dressing showed up for the fries that were delivered 40 ins. ago..  We told her about her cooks blonde hair in the angel hair spaghetti.  She apologized and stated she would replace the spaghetti...yes another 20 mins. to arrive.

Koco N.,"Los Angeles, CA",102,24,95,1.0,10/20/2013,"The next rant, or review, will cover first the experience of past three years, and then last night (4th experience). FYI, we always got to TGI around 5-530pm.  What better way to go into scary mazes and face horrifying creatures, clowns of doom and stuff creating nightmares than being a little.. Giggly? heehee. As long as one pregames/parties responsibly and safely, everyone involved will have a good time.  For the last three years, something always went wrong at Fridays.. Food and/or alcohol related. We ordered beer.. THAT had more alcohol content than a Long Island! Im afraid to order a shot of hard liquor in the case its watered down!! That's pretty concerning. If one is ordering food with large fat/calorie content, there should be enough alcohol in the ordered drink. Also FYI this location doesn't offer or accept coupons/specials/etc that are affiliated with TGI Fridays, because it's owned and franchised by the theme park. Also, drink costs are more expensive during Scary Farm season. Beer is a tad cheaper.  My friends and I have been going consistently to Knotts Scary farm for the last three years. We always went to TGI's prior to entering the park because of the alcoholic stuff they provided.. No risking driving intoxicated and getting a DUI or OMG a crash or death prior to a theme park!  Yesterday was our fourth. Will write a review about Knotts right after this..  Our first year, the place was packed so we got seated at a table in the bar. The girls and I ordered margaritas, which they provided to us with shaker cups, which we thought was pretty cool. Until my bestie's shaker pretty much sprayed all of us with sweet alcohol and we smelled drunk before we started drinking.. But we were able to get a replacement. Second year, again we were seated in the bar. Drinks had almost no alcohol content, and the waiter hardly checked on us. We had to wait 20min after being seated to order food! On top of that, my friend's ""medium rare"" steak was cooked super super rare -- toasted on the sides, blood literally oozing out when sliced. We sent it back, came back the same. Did the cooks even see the plate? Was it bothered to be even taken back to the kitchen? That we will never know. Last and third year, we were seated in the dining area, in a booth. Table was still filthy with ketchup/aioli stains, cup water marks and dropped fries from the prior customers. Isn't it procedure to wipe down the table before seating people?? With our prior experience with the steak, we decided to keep it safe and order pasta, salad, and a burger. At this time, I ordered a lettuce wrapped burger... How can a burger go wrong, right? Well.. They gave me a different TYPE of burger from what I ordered. And the toppings were not fresh. Meaning the lettuce hidden under the top layers were starting to wilt and the tomatoes had white and green patches. Sent back, and received a .. Better looking, and correct, burger. My friend's salad also had the same ""freshness"" problem. The portions smothered in the salad dressing were visibly wilted. What's going on in the kitchen?? Did delivery of fresh produce skip a day or something??  Finally, last night's review. Sorry for the long rant but reviewing back the last three visits can be pretty long.  The wait was not long at all. 20-25minutes or so for a party of six, compared to nearly an hour wait for the last three years. We were seated and almost immediately a server came (she was covering for our 'real' server's break) and took our drink orders, which came 10min later. Drinks came in, not in the cool looking shaker glasses, rocks glasses or even margarita glasses we were used to, but in clear green plastic ""SOLO"" type cups. Cutting down on costs much?? Three of the five drinks we ordered had none or very minimal alcoholic content, which we had to flag down a manager and had alcohol added.   Food was.. Acceptable. Came About 15-20min after we placed order. I ordered a burger, but with the meat patty on the side... Which did not happen haha. (Sent back). My friend's pasta dish was cold to the touch, and when the pasta was tasted, it had a slight rubbery texture that comes with stale cold pasta. It was obvious it may have been sitting out for more than 10min. Isn't it supposed to be fresh? Sent back.. And then returned in 3 min. Server said it was heated back up. Since when does a restaurant kitchen have a microwave to heat ""fresh"" meals???  Everyone else seemed to either accept or truly enjoy their meals...  I don't know if this will happen again next year. Only time will tell.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=340
Joel C.,"Carlsbad, CA",11,90,16,2.0,3/30/2015,"Not a good TGI Fridays. The menu is different from ones in the San Diego area, very different I would say and worse too. Prices seemed the same if not less, but the portions were very small for the price. I went here with a group of 5 other people after going to Knotts. The restaurant was not crowded at all. We had who we thought was our waiter come by and ask us if we were ready to order our food; at that time we were only ready to ask for waters. I asked that waiter about drink prices when he came back and how much a Moscow Mule would cost (a drink not on the menu). I asked how much it would cost with New Amsterdam and then how much it would be if I wanted Grey Goose instead. He wasn't sure and said he would ask (He wasn't even sure if they had New Amsterdam but I could see it when we walked in). At this point he asked me for my ID which was fine. A second waiter greeted us and said, ""I'm your real server"" which I thought was odd. I mentioned to him that I asked about drink prices and he brought over a 3rd waiter. This waiter said it would be $9 for a Moscow Mule, no matter what vodka I chose to go in it. That means it would have been $9 for a New Amsterdam Moscow Mule and the same price for a Grey Goose Moscow Mule which is ridiculous. I just decided to order it with Grey Goose of course. In addition, the 3rd waiter asked for my ID again even though I already showed it to the first waiter. During our stay, none of the 3 waiters bothered to check up on us when we needed water, more food, and another drink. None of us got a fair amount of food for the prices we paid. The only way I would recommend this place is if you absolutely don't want to eat at Knotts. Service is bad and unorganized.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=340

Paula R.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",13,126,20,1.0,2/28/2015,"Worst Birthday dinner EVER!!! We visited the evening of February 15th. We didn't have to wait too long for our table. Once seated we waited about 10 minutes before someone came and took our drink order. We ordered our drinks and an appetizer. There were 3 of us, myself, my husband and my 5yo son. Our drinks were delivered first then came our appetizer. Our waitress, Samantha delivered only 1 plate. Perhaps she thought only one of us needed to eat. At the time our appetizer was delivered we ordered our meals. I ordered the 3 for $20 which are like appetizers and they're meant to share. The waitress asked if I wanted that as my entrée and I told her I did. So I'm thinking she knows that I wanted my food to come with my family's food.. I mean anyone in their right mind would think the same, right? Well apparently not Samantha but I will get into that in a sec. As Samantha is leaving our table, the table next to us stops her and asks if they can order as they are trying to get back to Knotts Berry Farm. We were seated about 10-15 minutes before this family of 3 adults and 2 children.  Twenty minutes passes and here comes Samantha with my dinner. I'm the only one that gets their food. We wait and wait, after all, we would like to eat together! The family of 5 next to us gets their food about 5minutes after my food arrives. Where is our food you ask? Yeah, we were wondering the same dang thing. I think Miss Samantha was smitten with the sweet talking (and good looking) gentleman that expressed his desire to get back to Knotts Berry Farm before they closed. I think their order was placed ahead of ours. The rest of our food arrives about 15min later and what do ya know, my food is cold! I had the waitress take my food away. While the manager took the price of my food off the bill it doesn't make up for such an horrible experience.

We were sat right away and out drink order was taken not far after. She had the Pink Punk Rocker, or whatever it's called, and I had the Hendrick's Cooler. Our server convinced me that the drink was good and I ordered it. Considering she was an avid gin hater, as am I, I took her word for it and was rewarded with a delicious and refreshing drink. I will absolutely be ordering this again. My friend wasn't a huge fan of her drink. It was crazy sweet and not as strong as she likes. We split potstickers as an appetizer, like we always do, and they were really good as usual. We both ordered burgers for lunch. I, the New York Cheddar and Bacon burger, and she, the All American Stacked. Both burgers were very good.

Now that we have the con's out of the way, let me say tell you about the positive things about this joint.  You have a nice clean and friendly restaurant that services up some good food. The menu does seem to change on a regular basis and does keep it ""fresh"". Nice alcoholic drink section and the waiters seem knowledgeable on what really does taste delightful and doesn't.  I have read that some of the waiters take forever bringing the food or asking if everything is fine, but you have to consider that this place does have a lot of business. Being bugged every five minutes irritates me, but seem people like the attention, so I guess they have to make a big fuss about it.  My conclusion about this place is that you should come here if you are not in a hurry and are in the mood for a zingy environment. The bar area does seem to have quicker service than the restaurant area.

Marc B.,"Tucson, AZ",137,22,1,2.0,10/17/2015,"We don't normally go to chain restaurants and if you've eaten at one TGI Fridays you've been here.  We decided to eat here because we were staying at Knott's Berry Farm Hotel and had to walk past here anyway ( no car). We did end up here two times on our vacation because I was pretty sure I left my hat here the first night and I was looking for it.  Food: The food is pretty good, again if you've eaten at any location it is about the same as any other location. Staff: The hostess that walks with a cane is super nice and our server the first visit was fairly nice but slow. The server on the second visit was just slow. The bar: How long does it take to pour a beer or mix a drink? I'm pretty sure that drinks should be out within 3 minutes. The perfect time is when the server comes back to take our dinner order. Not at TGI Friday's. On both of our visits the drinks came when our food had been delivered and halfway consumed. Here is a tip Friday's, if you want to make more money get the drinks out faster. I would never, ever order a second drink at that speed. In fact I hate having to rush my drink because my dinner is almost over and I am ready to head back to the hotel so I can go swimming.

Joshua M.,"Pomona, CA",22,2,,1.0,1/2/2016,"Let me tell you about the only decent experience I had at TGIFriday's, and that was the music. Other than that, this place is horrible. My wife and I come in, and ask to sit at the bar to avoid waiting for a table. Luckily the hostess let us know there was an available booth in the bar. We thought we scored, boy were we wrong. It probably took 5-10 minutes for a server to notice us. Once she did, she told us she'd help us in a moment. A moment turned into another 5-10 mintues. Our server finally came to our table and asked us if we were ready to order, in which we weren't because we wanted a full menu. She didn't even ask us if we wanted to start off with something to drink. Then she walked over to the hostess table and picked up two menus for us. She then told us that she would give us a few minutes, but we were ready to order our drinks. After we ordered our drinks, it took about 10 mintues to get it out to us. We finally ordered after receiving our drinks. We thought after having our drinks, maybe things would go a little more smoothly, and we were wrong yet again. We started to see more customers flow into the bar dining area, and that's when the waiting game started. Other customers began ordering their meals, while my wife and I were still waiting on our appetizers. After about 20 minutes, we noticed the other customers who arrived after us were getting their appetizers and meals. We normally don't care about that, but after waiting so long, we were pretty annoyed. I felt that the waitress had seen my wife and I look over at the customers who received their meals before us because she came up to our table and told us our food would be out, but they were just backed up because of the other side. I would have believed her bologna, but customers on our side were receiving their food on good time. But because we don't like to make a big deal about things, we let it slide again. Our appetizers finally came out, and that was okay. Probably only because my wife and I were practically starving. While we were eating our appetizers, they brought out one side salad and our Jack Daniel's burger that we were going to share. Please note we had ordered 2 side salads. One with balsamic dressing and the other with italian dressing. I had to tell the food runner we ordered 2 side salads. She then asked what type of dressings for both, which we proceeded to tell her one balsamic and one italian. She then told me they didn't have italian and balsamic would be the closest in dressing. The Italian dressing was for my wife which she was fine with, but we were wondering why our server didnt tell us. Now let me tell you about our so called Jack Daniel's burger. One, the fries were cold. My wife had to try one because she was in disbelief. Then I pick my half of the burger and had to immediately put it down because it was cold. I had to touch the center to feel some kind of heat, which was nonexistant. It's like our burger had just been sitting on the counter in the kitchen. I was also looking for the Jack Daniel's sauce the burger was supppose to have. My wife had asked me if  she should speak to the manager and luckily I happened to see the manager walking by. So my wife called out to her and told her our burger and fries were cold. The manager was very apologetic and nice, and offered to remake the burger which we were happy about. The manager ended up returning with a new burger in less than 5 minutes and we were pleased about that. The manager once again apologized and asked if there was anything else she could do. In my mind, a new server, but out loud, nothing. I think after we had talked to the manager, our server began acting rude towards us. At that point, we didn't even care. We just wanted our check and to leave this horrible place. Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone. I should have read the reviews about this place and gone to Claim Jumper's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=280
Grace C.,"Anaheim, CA",50,843,1158,1.0,1/6/2013,"You know the song where Rebecca Black sings ""Friday""?  And how it's so annoying and BAD?  That basically describes this TGI Friday's.  Which seat should I take?....Don't take any of them. Because of our experience, the bf and I will now forever check Yelp reviews before entering ANY establishment. We went into the building, unawares of the health hell that we were about to traverse into.  No lines, no crowds, few people in the dining room....oh woe is us to not see the danger signs.   Issue 1: When we walked in, there were two girls there, folding menus.  They did not greet us immediately.  Instead, they went on with their folding.  They were fully aware that we were there, but they wanted to go on with their tedious and pointless task of folding menus and recording down how many menus they already made and such.  When they were done writing down how many menus they made, they finally looked up and greeted us.  However, they can't find their seating map because it's buried underneath all of their menus, and they more or less just go into one of the dining rooms, look around, see a table that is still being currently cleaned and take us over there.  We walk over there, the busboy is still cleaning, but the hostess basically shoos him away so that we can sit.  But he wasn't done cleaning, and it is obvious he wasn't done cleaning. Issue 2:  Because the table was actually still dirty, she seated us, and covered a nice fat piece of lettuce with the menu, thinking that we wouldn't see it.  I made a point of removing the menu, flicking off the piece of lettuce from the table, and then sat down.  Sorry, missy, but I'm not stupid; you try and cover stuff like that, and it will be pointed out.   Our waitress eventually came by, and we ordered two waters.  Which moves to Issue 3: the water tasted of more chlorine than the Big Foot Rapids water at Knott's.  I mean, I understand that most of the time the water you order is tap water.  But there's a point in time where the taste and hygiene coming from the tap water either needs to be sanitized or some filter needs to be replaced.   We eventually order our entrees.  I get the shrimp and chicken fettucine, while the bf got the sirloin steak and shrimp scampi.  This launches us to Issue 4 and 5: they gave me a plastic fork and knife in a wrapper while the bf got a dirty-ass steak knife and stainless steel fork. It's a restaurant...is it weird that I assumed that there'd be actual silverware, not plastic stuff.  The only good thing about my stuff being plastic is that we could somewhat safely assume that the plastic utensils were sanitary.  However, for Issue 5, the bf's silverware were disgusting.  The knife was still grimy, it was not clean, and there were plenty of stains on there that I could not move with a napkin and friction.  Now, I love my bf, and we are prone to getting food-poisoned as much as everybody else.  Didn't want the risk of a food poisoning, so the bf decided to take my plastic knife so that he would have something a bit more sanitary to cut the steak with.   Got the food promptly, so that was good...right?  Issues 6 to Montezuma's Revenge. - My chicken tasted old and cold.  It tasted as if they had originally cooked it a few days ago, put it in the fridge or freezer, and then ""cooked"" on a George Foreman grill when I put in my order.  The pasta was hard and cold, as if it was either out for awhile, or they had made the pasta in the morning, no one ordered any, and it was sitting where ever it was sitting for half an hour or so.  The sauce itself was warm.  But, everything was definitely less than 160 degrees, and probably a mediocre 135-145 degrees when I had the food.  Major food code violation. - The bf ordered the steak medium, but it came out from well done to raw.  As in, he would slice into one portion and it was medium, but then he'd slice into another portion and it was raw, and then he'd slice into another portion and it was well done.  His plate looked like a horrible murder scene after awhile.  The shrimp was okay, the mashed potatoes were like cardboard, and the veggies was soggy.  A few minutes after we were ""done"" with our meal, the bf already felt sick.  The food basically slipped right through his stomach and into his ass because it was so coated with oil that it launched right through digestion like the Mountain Log ride.  Had to run home after that.... Our check was ridiculous.  Two meals and it was basically $50 with tip.  If it was good food, then I would have been happy to pay for it.  But it wasn't, and it sucked, and the bf got sick.  Fuck you, TGI Friday's.  Not very Friday-like of you at all. So, the next time you're near Knott's, and you're hungry?  DON'T COME HERE.  Standing in line is better than the bullshit that we saw and ate.  Bleh.   Only thing that was okay was that our waitress(es) were nice.  We'll see if that changes and I somehow get a bank statement of them adding a bigger tip than what I put in..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=280

Anthony A.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",778,1013,99,1.0,10/12/2012,"Reviewer bias/preface: Friday's fucking sucks.  I equate eating here with someone telling me bad news, like I'm going to have to spend the next 48 hours watching Whoopi Goldberg films. So, why did I eat here? Easy: the guys in our group for Knott's Scary Farm wanted to get drinks beforehand, and this is really the best place to do that.  Unfortunately, it also means that if you didn't think to eat ahead of time, you'll probably be tempted to crack open a menu.  FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST, DO NOT DO THIS.  For starters, they have instituted a new policy that limits food ordering at the bar to a small menu during Halloween season. I get that you don't want to back the kitchen up with 82 orders from half-drunken assholes waiting to enter the park, but gauge accordingly, guys. All this new policy managed to do was piss off my group since we were all hungry, and getting a table didn't sound like a fun idea. But we did it because we had to.  I cautiously opened the menu, quickly scanning past every caloric behemoth to find something that wouldn't shave years off my life. I settled on the Jack Daniels chicken, with mashed potatoes & vegetable medley.  That can't be all that bad, right? WRONG. My ""chicken"" (I feel I need to use the term loosely here) seemed... off. It was like someone had ground up all the parts of the chicken, then compressed them together into the form of what resembles a breast. I eat A LOT of chicken, and this did not seem like a fresh breast of it. The sides were absolute garbage. The potatoes were - naturally! - covered in a congealed, slimy mess of ""cheese"". The spuds underneath were so stiff someone must have mixed Cialis into the batch. My ""vegetable medley"" was just zucchini and squash. It was also so overcooked that each piece was just a limp, sloppy, sad slice of what could have been a decent gourd.  Everything about this place - from the garish decor right on down to the painted-on smiles each shit-shoveling server brings to the table - makes me want to wretch. Vile establishments like this are why you're so fat, America. They pander to the LCD, with zero regard for quality, health, standards, or otherwise.  Next time, I'm making the guys eat anywhere but here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=200

I only chose to go here because I wanted to grab a quick drink and appetizer before I went into Knott's Berry Farm. So we go in there and order our drinks at the bar and the manager is playing with, scowling and being very rude saying that my boyfriend's ID is fake. Mind you, he is 25 years old... like most people in the US, he got his drivers licence at 16 years old so yes the picture looks slightly different but she wouldn't give us our drinks because she swore that the ID was fake. He clearly looks his age (25) so WTF. I finally went on my Facebook and pulled up old high school photos just to prove to this ignorant person that that is his ID is real. In the end, we finally got our drinks. Then we ordered some boneless wings, among a couple appetizers, I believe some Jack Daniels thing? DISGUSTING.. everything is overly fried and not in a way that even tastes good. I felt like I got a box of chicken wings out of the frozen food aisle in a grocery store. Not restaurant quality at all!! I've been to other TGIF locations that actually have food that is up to restaurant quality... Ok so there's more. The bartender and a waitress were talking very close by where we were sitting and we could hear every word of them bashing their customers and saying rude things about other people that work there. The food and staff quality left a terrible taste in my mouth. I will never go back there. I do, however, highly recommend the Claim Jumper and Black Angus down the street.

My family and I go to Knotts quite often as we have annual passes. So of course when this particular TGI Fridays opened up we had to give it a try. What a disaster it was. I have been there two times. The first time the place was brand new. The decor is like any other typical Fridays establishment. The food on the other hand was pure filth. The food was like pig slop. I ordered the chicken fettuccine and it was soupy and not even close to being hot. The server was a complete ding bat. After trying to let her know that my plate was a huge pile of slop with no success we decided to just get out of there. The second time we went there (I know it seems I am a glutton for punishment) we had received a gift card. It had been a year or so since we had gone there the first time. The second time was no different from the first. I ordered chicken and cheese and wow it was terrible. I would not even serve what they served to me to Al-Qaeda. It was a mess. This particular Fridays must be ran by some pretty moronic people. Look at all the negative reviews for this particular Fridays. It reflects on the management. They must not care.

Kim N.,"South Bay, CA",2945,9798,55739,4.0,8/31/2006,"I went to a wedding held at the Bride's uncle's huge-mungous house in Buena Park. Now she's Mexican and the Groom is Indian so there was this full on Catholic meets Hindu ceremony  that basically went on for 8 hours. After numerous bottles of Syrah and the conclusion of the formal festivities, a group of us where looking for the next level of partying. Unfortunately, Buena Park ain't a party town and the only thing there besides hotels/motels is Knott's Berry Farm. Someone found out that there was a TGIF there and figuring that there was a full bar and munchies, it would do.   To our discovery, the bar was full of other people looking to rage, and who also figured this to be the only game in town. Lot's of twenty-somethings, a mix of locals/tourists,  and now  a dozen or so raucous (but nicely dressed) wedding participants. I was actually surprised to see a number of cute girls (well it is still the greater LA area) and find that the wait staff was going to be equally as out of hand.  So we ordered a spread of appetizers and burgers to fill our post wedding hunger pangs.   As the waited for the food the Guinness, shots, and other fine TGIF libations started flowing. Some of the girls in our party agreed to partake in one of the bartender's ""LA Dirty Water"" mixoramas, which had Midori, Blue Curacao, and a number of other liquids that gave it a greenish-brown hue. They gave it a thumbs up and several rounds were to follow. The food was typical TGIF, mozzarella sticks, potato skins, cheeseburgers; nothing fancy but  good enough to fulfill the wedding/alcohol marathon binge. One of the amusing things of the night was the cocktail sign printed in giant letters with a ceiling lamp obscuring ""tail"". So from where we were sitting, the sign read: ""ULTIMATE COCK"" and we tried to get a picture of one of the male employees giving the Groom a lap dance under said sign, but neither party was going for it. So we continued to eat, drink and closed the place down.   I totally forgot how fun a chain place like TGIF could actually be when you're with the right people and everyone else around you is just looking to have a good time (and it's not someone's frickin' bday). As we were leaving, we noticed that there was a joint down the street called ""Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant"". In front of this place was a 7-8 foot tall statue of a rooster.

It's the safe, reliable place to get appetizers, drinks, and when you're feeling bold, the Jack Daniels Flat Iron Steak. THIS Friday's however, is one of the saddest restaurants I've ever been to. The service was extremely slow, which was appalling considering it was Monday @ 4:00. There were maybe 5 other tables of customers.

We were halfway through the dish when she finally reappeared with 2 glasses of water (there were 3 people in our party). I ordered the spinach dip and was charged an extra .99 when I asked for more chips. REALLY? You're going to charge me for extra chips?! It's not my fault there were only 15 chips on the plate to begin with. When the waitress told me, I thought she was kidding. But no, she was dead serious. I've never run into this practice at any of the other Friday's locations (Costa Mesa, Cerritos, Orange). I can justify giving this place one star because the waitress carded my mother, thereby making her day. The fact that she refused to serve my mom alcohol after she explained that she didn't bring an id was hilarious. She pointed out that I was her child and that she had the C-section scar to prove it, but the waitress wasn't buying it. So in the end I showed my id and ordered mom some booze.

Food was ""meh"".

We've only gone in there once or twice for appetizers before going into the park so we figured why not have dinner there. We sat at the bar wasn't packed so we found seats easy. The waitress wasn't really friendly from the start which should have been our first sign. I ordered a strawberry daiquiri and my husband had an Octoberfest. My strawberry daiquiri was weak but I don't like sending back orders. We ordered 2 burgers with fries. The food was ok. Honestly a fast food joint probably would have been better. Mind you we never saw our waitress again and had to ask someone else for our check. Our bill came up to $75. I understand it's at a theme park and your going to pay a little more but come on 2 drinks and 2 burgers. My strawberry daiquiri was $14 DOLLARS!!!  I will never come back here.

We were seated next to the register, so all the servers would come over to put in their orders and cash out their customers. This one girl in particular came over to that register a lot and actually made a recommendation while we were in the middle of ordering. It so turned out that it was a great recommendation...thus earning a 4th star. However, a short while later, she and another server (male) arrived at the register at about the same time, and she turned and snapped at him ""CAN'T YOU SEE I AM USING THIS?

Silverware, napkins & drink refills had to be requested, not once were we asked.  Food was served another 30 minutes later, two of the four of us ordered Jack Daniels shrimp.  When served we were told that the jack Daniels sauce would be there any minute.  10 minutes later we had to again request the sauce, another 10 minutes and the sauce finally makes an appearance.  By then I had filled up on the french fries.  My 3 year old grand daughter was antsy with all of the waiting so my daughter stepped outside with her, while my husband & I requested & waited for the bill.  Bill came, we paid cash including a 15% tip that clearly was not deserved, but because my daughter use to be a waitress, we gave the minimum.  My husband then went to the bathroom while I stepped outside with my daughter.  The manager stopped my husband on his way out and accused my family of  not paying the bill.  Seriously???  Maybe they thought that we dinned and dashed because of the way we all rushed out of the restaurant after being trapped with zero service for over 2 hours.  Where was he when the service was so bad?  Evidently, he only appears when there is an issue with the bill and doesn't check on his customers and the lack of service that they had received.  Needless to say we will never be back to that awful restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=440

My company had their holiday party here, and I just knew it was NEAR knotts, but I didn't realize you actually drive into Knott's parking area.  Once I finally got there, I was pretty impressed with the location. It's surrounded by other little restaurants on Grand ave, right outside the theme park. Also right outside of the Patio area is the ride Ghost Rider. You can see the ppl on the ride, hear them screaming, its kinda neat- you feel like you get to be apart of all the action!!  I'm reviewing this place mainly on location.  Food here is decent.  TGIF's Jack Daniels sauce is their specialty which is pretty good!!  This time I tried their honey pecan salmon, probably should have stuck w/ usual Jack Daniels steak/shrimp or chicken. Salmon was a little dry, and sides were just rice and broccoli...pretty bland and boring.   So basically if you feel like eating at TGIF, maybe try this location for something different!

Now I love to karaoke, I'm Filipino, but  the volume was too high. It was difficult to sit in the bar area and have a conversation with my friend. I requested to be moved to the farthest table they had. I asked to be outside in the patio. This is where the 2nd complaint comes in...they weren't doing service outside for some reason. Why have tables outside if you aren't going to use it! So instead, we were moved to a table in a far corner of the restaurant.  Third complaint,  no Happy Hour. Don't all Fridays have Happy Hour??? Why is this one different?Isn't this a bar? Fourth, they close at 11, unlike other Fridays that close midnight and beyond.

Our waitress seemed so sweet at first then all things went down hill once our drink order arrived at the table. My husband's beer wasn't really cold and had a strange after taste to it . We asked how fresh the keg was ? They didn't give us it straight answer so my husband ask for a different brand beer and it was cold and tasted better . We placed our order it took 30 mins the kids food came out first my son order cheese fries the fries had no cheese. After waiting 10 mins still no food for us adults . I made eye contact with our waitress I saw her face when she noticed we didn't have our food yet and rushed to the kitchen area. Another 10mins later our food arrived ! As I ate my burger I thought how strange I didn't order a BBQ burger and told my husband he then noticed he also had the wrong burger! We asked for a menu to double check and we were right we had different burgers then what we ordered but they weren't even accidentally switched they were not our burgers at all we couldn't even find the burgers on the menu with the condiments that were added to ours! We told the waitress she said ""sorry"" as if it happens a lot there. I couldn't believe it . She then said ""ok I will talk to my boss I will be back"" whatever that meant we so hungry we just ate our creative cook burgers . The waitress came back and said I can give you a free dessert if you want one ? I just wanted to leave but the kids order an Oreo ice cream sandwich . When the dessert arrive it was so frozen that we couldn't cut it it had probably been in freezer for years. We waited for it to thaw it and it won't so just left it there I wonder if it ever melted?? It's sad that this location has bad service and bad food since it's part of knotts and at a great location . There were so many host, waitresses , managers just stand around not doing anything they could have walked around checked on customers . We had to keep trying to look for someone to refill or drinks , ask for ketchup or dipping sauce as the workers just huddle behind a drink station in the middle of the restaurant chatting .

The wait was short considering the mad rush at the park and the crazy line at Mrs. Knott's. We really lucked out and seated ourselves at the bar. Our first waiter was quick with the waters. We must have really needed them because we downed them before he could come back with the menus. After that, we got another server. This was annoying because the wait staff kept changing throughout the entire meal and we had no idea who to flag down for what we needed and none of them could remember what we had asked for and what had already been brought out. Ugh. We finally placed our orders and yet another person brought the food. I ordered a salad to stay somewhat healthy since I had already had my fair share of amusement park junk. The salad was good but not great. It was a chipotle chicken mix with avocados. I love avocados and wish there were more but alas I only saw a few pieces. :( Overall, the experience was very unprofessional. It would have been nice to just have one consistent server/waiter throughout the entire meal. We were only there for an hour, business was slow, so it didn't make sense for all the rotations and confusion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=260

I really wanted to go in to detail and tell you just how BAD this place is but I just don't feel like it. All I want to say is that the people that own and run this place simply don't care about what their customers have to say. If they did they would read all the bad reviews and see that they have alot in common and learn what they are doing wrong. I asked the manager why they don't read the reviews and make change and he said that they don't feel the reviews are accurate. Something like that. I told him about my bad experiance and he did nothing for me. This TGIF is the worst location I've been to and I've been to several.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=260

Food is Friday's mediocrity.  It always looks so much better on the menu (and the commercials).    Our server was awesome though, and she made the evening a lot of fun.  Until last call at 10:40!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=320

Another reason why we came here was to use coupons for this new ""rewards"" program called ""Give Me More Stripes"" - you can earn points when you eat to get free food and they also give coupons for discounted food, free desserts/appetizers, etc.  So we had a printout of coupons that said an appetizer for one cent with drink purchase and one dollar for an entree when you purchase another - our waiter walked by and said they don't acknowledge any of the TGI Friday's coupons.  Uhm...what? Apparently, this TGI Friday's is owned by Knott's and they don't have to follow what the other chains do.  They'd probably get even more customers if they did - I've noticed a drop in customers lately.  So yeah...we were not happy about this.  I am disgruntled.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=420

Knott's Chicken Restaurant was too long even at 3 pm.  The service was okay; were greeted upon entering, seated in just a couple of minutes and the waiter took our beverage orders fairly quickly even tho the restaurant was also packed; I guess because they serve the Knotts crowd. The reason for only 2 stars is because of their food!  We ordered their 3 for $17 appetizers (2 orders of pot stickers and 1 order of boneless buffalo wings). Whatever you order, do NOT order the potstickers!!! These have to be THE worst potstickers I've EVER had!!! They were SO bad, even I couldn't duplicate them at home if I tried.  The potsticker skins were crumbling when we attempted to pick them up with our forks or try to cut them in half! (We had children so we wanted to cut them up smaller for bite size.) It was as if the potstickers had been frozen for MONTHS then thawed in the microwave before they pan-fried them; it's the only explanation for their condition and texture.  I should know cuz I've seen it done and that's exactly what happens!  Their children's Mac n cheese was too lumpy, like it sat out, my drench dip had a weird meat consistency that's hard to explain, like they tenderized it too much...and it took too long to get an extra order of ranch dressing.  Like the other reviews the prices were definitely on the higher end than other TGIF's.

It's hard for me to come here without getting the potato skins...mmm!! The fish and chips is great, too. I think they give too much, though, and taking home the leftovers is almost always necessary. The cheap $5 menu items are great as well; I got a Jack Daniel's Chicken Sandwich, which is extremely filling and delicious! If you like pasta or cheese (or both!) you will love the Gourmet Mac 'n Five Cheese, which is indescribable...definitely NOT Kraft mac 'n cheese, that's for sure! They used to have a really good dessert that was like an oreo ice cream sandwich...not sure if they still have it, though. The prices are decent, especially with the $5 menu items, and the atmosphere never fails to keep me entertained. This review is mostly about TGIF in general, not really the location....this one basically has less than impressive food and service, so any other location would be great.

Our waiter, although limited in personality (or just intimidated by our group), didn't miss a beat.  Even when he went on his California-mandated break, the server that covered our table was spot-on.  The portions, interestingly enough, were far larger than what was portrayed in the pictorial menu.  I mean, when does that happen?  I couldn't even finish my Cobb salad.

Linda C.,"Buena Park, CA",64,124,61,2.0,9/23/2011,"ive only been here during the weekday, the staff isnt as personable as other spots there happy hour is kind of sad, other spots seem more lively like at the long beach towne center or cerritos, more kids here then not and older people, our more recent visit gave us a ditzy waitreess or she just had an off day. she didnt give the correct changed she shorted us and she wasnt attentive. the food was okay.parking can be validated remmber your ticket",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=420
salvador j.,"Arcadia, CA",0,14,1,1.0,10/19/2013,the worst restaurant i've ever been.. the place is so crappy u would see the gathering dust on their decors which i think is already more than 2 decades.. this place is a shame compared to the TGIF restaurants back east where i stayed for many years.. yeah the service maybe a little bit ok but the food is something i won't even feed my dog.. u have to ask for silverwares (because they think u are not eating there?) and they are so dirty i wont even use them to scratch my itchy foot.. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE THEY CALL RESTAURANT!!!!!.. u would feel better throwing ur money in the trash can than spending it here..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=420
Tony K.,"Anaheim, CA",3,23,1,1.0,2/11/2009,"I usually have bad experiences whenever I go to Fridays, and this one does not disappoint. I keep going back because it's borderline entertaining. I worked in food service for a long time and it's fun seeing how terrible some restaurants can get. If you're into that, and you don't mind drinking beer from a glass that smells and tastes of sanitizer, this is the place to be. Otherwise, that $15 cheeseburger combo from Knott's isn't THAT bad an idea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=420
Stephanie W.,"La Mirada, CA",83,11,3,1.0,1/18/2012,"this has to be the WORST dining experience I have ever had! It started with unwrapping my silverware and seeing food stuck to my fork and knife. My family unwrapped theirs and their silverware was also dirty. The napkins were actually black with dirt! I took them to the manager and he acted like it was no big deal. I asked for new sets of silverware and he said he couldnt guarantee that they would be clean so did i want plastic forks and knives! I should have gathered my family and ran out of this place, but I gave them a chance... which I totally regret! Our waiter came to the table and we all swear he was cracked out! He was fidgeting and rushing us to order and talking all fast. So we order our food and this is what we got: cold broccoli cheese soup, uncarbonated soda, chicken breast that was so small I cut it into 4 pieces (it was probably 1.5oz of meat), overcooked steak (ordered medium, received well) rubbery shrimp, and soggy fries. The food was so disgusting! I could not even eat it. My husband complained again and all they did was take off 19 dollars from an $89 tab and there was only 5 of us and no alcohol was ordered! I literally get a stomach ache every time I think of this horrible experience! DO NOT EVER GO TO THIS PLACE!! If I could rate it accurately, it would be a -5",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=420
Nelly F.,"Laguna Hills, CA",0,8,,1.0,8/19/2013,"What can I say about this place. Food is ok and the service is bad. My family and I went to Knott's and decided to have lunch here. We were seated and ordered food. Great. We were hungry...15 minutes passed...Ok its busy...20 minutes passed...No problem, the place looks busy, I get it....25 minutes passed...I asked our waitress and she said ""Your order is almost done. It will be coming out shortly""...30 minutes passed and still no sign of our lunch. By this time I was sucking the air through my straw because the water in my glass was finished. Our waitress was nowhere in sight and getting help from someone else was replied with ""I'll get your waiteress"". Nearly 45 minutes later our food came out. Oh and what did we order in a group of 6 people 2 pasta dishes and a fish dish. Nothing too complicated. After asking what took so long our waitress replies that the kitchen was short staffed. It would have been nice to know that bit of information before we placed our order. Maybe our waitress was having a bad day and didn't care for us, I don't know, but she should have been professional and friendlly enough to remind us of the delay. This place should train their staff in better customer service. In the end we will not return and I will never recommend this place to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=420
Ay V.,"Long Beach, CA",2,13,9,1.0,6/9/2010,"I gave this place 1 star, yet I feel it doesn't even deserve 1 that's how bad the place is. So my boyfriend and I went to Knott's and we decided to eat @ TGIF's  which ended up being the worst decision we've ever made. The food was disgusting, the service was terrible. It was a monday, the place was empty yet we weren't able to get our orders in until 15 minutes later. Our waiter Ron is a retard everytime we would try getting him to attend us, he would ignore us. But not just him, everyone there did. So we got our nasty food 30 minutes later. I didn't eat any of it. I wanted to just pay and leave but of course, our mindless waiter was at the back chatting with other fellow lazy co-workers. I got up went to the back and told him we were ready for the check. I believe it took me a total of 20 minutes for me just to pay. Total time we wasted eating at this place: over an hour. This was my first and last time going to this place. Next time I'll just eat inside theme park. In the end, this is the worst restaurant I've ever been to. They should just fire everyone and close it down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buena-park?start=420
