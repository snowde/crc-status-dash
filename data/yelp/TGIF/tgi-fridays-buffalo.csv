The food was very good. We had the JD ribs with fries and the shrimp with chicken dish. Everything is excellent.

Aaron R.,"Lockport, NY",44,30,99,1.0,1/5/2018,"My friends and I went here to have dinner before the Buffalo Bandits Home Opener, as it is close to the train station so we can ride down to the arena. This has been our place to go for a decent dinner and off to the game. I believe this will be our last time. To start off we were greeted the host who said they would have us out in time before the game, and this was the beginning of the end. There were 4 of us total, but our one friend was running behind but gave us his order so that we could get it in to save time. The 3 of us ordered the endless apps(Mozzarella Sticks,Boneless Wings,Pot-Stickers), and my other friend ordered the Jack Daniel's Chicken Sandwich. The first round of apps took around 15-20 minutes to come out, which was 4 mozzarella sticks. A couple minutes later the pot-stickers came out, but no sign of the boneless wings or the Jack Daniels Chicken Sandwich. We ate what was brought to us, ordered another round when they were dropped off, and we received another round of 4 mozzarella sticks, and pot-stickers. After being there for about 45 minutes the sandwich was inquired about, and then it was brought out with another order of boneless wings. We spoke with the waitress to explain that we were headed to the game, as we were dressed in Bandits gear, and that we needed to catch the train. My friend had to basically shove the sandwich in his mouth, we waited for the bill (she did take off one of the endless apps which was nice of her) but then disappeared with the bill and credit card for another 10 minutes.  We were not impressed with the service, and we barely made it to the game on time, in the future we will find another place to go for dinner before the game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buffalo
Paul S.,"Hamburg, NY",0,19,,1.0,1/13/2018,"This place is pretty awful.  I've been here twice.  The first time the service was very subpar (they had mistakenly given our food to another table...who then apparently ate it).   The second time, today, we were non-greeted by a hostess who let us stand and wait while she conducted a personal conversation for a minute or two.  She then acted bothered when we asked for a table by the window...despite it being not busy at all at 430pm.  Then a few minutes after being seated and came back and asked us if we'd mind moving ""to the back"".  After saying that yes, we would mind, she insisted we move.  After telling her we'll just leave instead (which we did), I asked for her name, to which she replied ""it's not important"".  After asking to speak with a manager we were told ""they're all busy"".  It is safe to say that we will not be going back here, ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buffalo
Stephanie P.,"Buffalo, NY",5,68,16,1.0,6/28/2017,"We ended up here Sunday night because there wasn't much open on a Sunday night at 10:30. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants but I consider Friday's to be one of the better ones.  To start off, we waited a few minutes to be seated. At 10:30 on a Sunday night. My friend actually called the restaurant's number while we stood there and asked them to seat us (Haaa)! We kept it simple and ordered endless apps and a few drinks. The BBQ chicken flatbread was cold and our first order of mozzarella sticks were too. The second batch was much better.  We ordered BBQ boneless wings as well as Buffalo chicken; the first order was fine but the Buffalo batch came out cold. What the heck?! It's not like they cook it from scratch; how hard is it to reheat food? My Sangria was pretty blah... and it was ten freaking dollars. It was watered down with barely any fruit in the glass. Let's just say I was pretty disappointed. On the plus side, our waitress was very nice and personable. I'm usually underwhelmed when I come to this location.  In my opinion, the restaurant on Walden is much, much better.

It took 20 minutes before having the chance to order drinks and only gave our order after waving down another waitress because ours appeared to have forgotten we were even there.

Zen Z.,"Buffalo, NY",0,1,,1.0,10/9/2016,"Prior to entering the restaurant, I asked the hostess if it were okay to eat outside food and order drinks. She advised that is was ok. Tameka, the waitress agreed. After being seated for 20 minutes or so, Tameka came over & snickered you're not even suppose to be eating that here under her breath at me. Here she was giving me an attitude over the very thing that 20 minutes prior she was ok with. After receiving menacing stares & being approached several times over the very thing that was okayed from the beginning; I asked for my bill.  It was at that point that Sarah's (manager) mannerism became less ornery. I called Bob to explain my experience & he apologized. At this point I was content. Then a week later I get a call from an April Mckenzie (op mgr) who was a nasty condescending female. After berating me for 3-4 mins, she offered a $15 gift card. She claimed it would be emailed to me. Of course it wasn't. And from her tone and her choice of words I already knew she wasn't sending anything. She told me that they did me a favor letting me eat there disregarding that they made me uncomfortable doing so. And that people were staring not b/c of the commotion from the staff making a scene, but that I brought it on myself bringing food in the restaurant. She said people were wondering why someone would have the audacity to bring food & eat it there. Then she asked me if I ever took a business class b/c if I had I'd know that when you allow 1 person to do something then everyone follows. I have no idea what she had to lower herself to do to gain her position, but I highly doubt she took the ""ivy"" route. I vowed to tell all of my colleagues about my experiences at this location in very little likelihood of this place ever being mentioned for happy hr or the likes.

I came back later in the day, because some friends decided to go (and were already) there. Four out of the five us of had our orders screwed up: items missing that were ordered, items added that we asked to be struck, two steaks ordered the same way (medium) where one came back rare and the other well done.

Kat F.,"Toronto, Canada",423,996,2387,4.0,7/28/2009,"Sunday, July 12 is the new 'day that will live in infamy.' It's the day I learned that T.G.I. Friday's removed Fried Mac & Cheese from their apps menu. Let me regale you with stories of the tears that were shed that day. Two friends and I trekked it to Buffalo to catch a show at the Town Hall on Main Street -- the show ended up being cancelled and our only joy in life that day would be a seasonal trip to Friday's and a pitstop at Target to pick up absurd amounts of rare Vitamin Water.  Our server, Erika, was very pleasant and friendly - she is definitely in the right industry. She, too, was astounded by the removal of fried mac and cheese from the menu (she said it happened a few months ago) but pointed to the rest of the menu for replacement options. People, this menu is a textbook - it is COLOSSAL. Just when you think you know what you want, you muster up the strength to turn the page (it's a workout) and are greeted with more food options. I settled on the ""Cedar-Seared Salmon Pasta"" (I don't know what's up with my fish dabbling lately) and it was terrific, but the portion was far too Americanized, even for me, and I can throw back a kaiser-sized amount of food.  Goodbye, T.G.I. Friday's. Our love affair was short but sweet.

Alex K.,"Buffalo, NY",108,169,220,4.0,2/17/2014,"This place.  Heh.  This place.  I'm not much of a fan of chains, but I've done quite a bit of traveling, spent far too long at too many airports, acquainted myself with enough airports to know that T.G.I. Friday's is a safe bet.  The food ain't much to sniff at.  It's replacement level.  It's the measuring stick to which I compare any other similarly priced chain or local joint.  Food-wise, drinks-wise, this place measures up.  It hits that three-star mark pretty squarely.  Ever been to a T.G.I. Friday's?  Then you know exactly what to expect. There is exactly one distinctive thing about this T.G.I. Friday's that does actually raise it up a notch, that being the physical space it occupies.  On the ground level of a fair-sized hotel that I suspect used to be something else, the interior doesn't resemble that of any of its normally suburban peers.  Sure, it has tables and a few booths, but the key feature is a four-sided bar in the center of the space on each side of which large TVs have been carefully positioned to provide bar patrons comfortable access to whatever's showing (usually sports of some sort).  The sheer configuration here numbers it among the top five venues to presently watch sports of any type.  That the leather stools are both wide and plushy dramatically increases the comfort.  If I want to spend a Sunday afternoon watching football all day, this is a pretty fair spot to do so. Thanks to the amount of time they've inhabited their space, the operators have grown accustomed to the staffing demands of given times, but it is possible to catch them betting on the ""under"" of patron demand.  Although normally about as efficient as T.G.I. Friday's staffs are anywhere (not really a compliment), any increase can stress them and turn the whole place into a clusterfuck.  On the other hand, they can be quite solicitous off peak, and it does seem that they recognize regulars. 3 stars for food  3 stars for drinks  3 stars for food  5 stars for layout 3.5 stars overall (rounding up)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buffalo?start=20

Anyway today I had the pick 3 for a appetizer. I chose buffalo wings, mozzarella sticks and pretzels with beer cheese sauce. It was all delicious! The wings were hot and crispy and the sauce was addicting. The mozzarella sticks were ooey gooey and crispy with a lot of flavor. I wasn't crazy about the beer cheese sauce that accompanied the soft pretzel sticks( which were fab on their own!)  because it had bacon on top, and I am not a huge fan of bacon flavor ( I know, right!?)...I thought the sauce overpowered the pretzel flavor but to each their own...Next I had a chicken Caesar salad- which is near the top of my favorite salads list. Unfortunately this time it wasn't up to par. Very little cheese, slightly bitter lettuce and the chicken was over cooked and on the dry side. That's okay because I still enjoyed everything else.

Erin B.,"North Tonawanda, NY",38,76,48,4.0,11/1/2014,"I frequent this TGIFriday's more than I'd like to admit... I definitely have chain restaurant guilt.  There are so many good restaurants and bars in downtown Buffalo, so why would this be our go-to location before Sabres games? First, after 5pm, there is ample free street parking around the area, so after dinner we take the train down to the arena (and then back after the game).  Very convenient, especially now that the trains are back to full-service.  Second, there is rarely ever a wait for a table, even when they are busy before the game.  Third, this location offers 2-for-1 drinks ALL THE TIME.  House wines, margaritas, Long Island Iced Teas, and I believe there are beer specials as well.  Makes for a very economical evening if you are trying to avoid the $8 midget beers in the arena. Note that not all TGIFriday's offer this special. Fourth, the service is always good.  We've really never had a bad server, and oftentimes they are really good!  The manager can always be seen walking around, asking how your meal is, and if there's anything he can do to make it better.  Fifth, the food is pretty damn good for a chain, and there's a large selection of things for everyone.  Like someone else said, stick to your ""bar-type"" food like appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, etc, and you will not be disappointed. OK there it is, I finally admitted it and came out of my TGIFriday's closet.  I'm ready to profess my love publicly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buffalo?start=20

Erica was our waitress and I think everyone in customer service should be more like her! I was truly impressed! She would go above and beyond her job! While me and my coworkers were deciding what to order, she brought out chips and salsa. We come here maybe every other week, but have never had these. And they were warm and delicious!! She was very nice when taking our order, she voiced her opinion when my coworker wasn't sure what to get. He ordered what she suggested and he was very happy with the meal!

Most everything is sub par with the exception of thier burgers which are average. Yes it is cheaper than most places downtown but one gets what one pays for! It is passable for a beer or two...but why not head up Chippewa a couple blocks and fare far better with far fairer fare from a local business? So much to choose from....expand your horizons a wee bit..can't you?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buffalo?start=20
Adler M.,"Buffalo, NY",0,3,,1.0,5/7/2016,"had the worst restaurant experience I've ever had tonight . Server repeatedly brought the wrong items , ignored our requests after 1.5 hours (literally) and not getting our meal we requested the manager . She was kind and only required we pay our drink bill and we left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buffalo?start=20
karen z.,"Hammond, IN",0,10,2,2.0,3/24/2015,Not easy to find the parking spot down there! And I was standing there for 20-25 minutes to get a table! Foods were ok! Services were ok too!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buffalo?start=20
Dana G.,"Hamilton, Canada",1,138,4,1.0,11/11/2014,"Was there recently and was very disappointed.  The place was a mess! Bathroom is disorder the floor had food and napkins on it.  The place looked like a storm had blown through.  The entire experience was disappointing but the worst part was when I wrote in to inform TGI Fridays of the experience I got back at "" I will check on that"" wow....they lost this customer and as someone who often goes over to Sabres games I will find somewhere else to go for my happy hours! When we have so many different restaurant options customer service is one of the most important ways to keep your guests coming back they have definitely failed on that front.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buffalo?start=20
Nonie B.,"Calabasas Highlands, CA",0,31,3,1.0,4/17/2013,"Gross! This place is for you if you dont mind filthy sticky menus, sticky tables, sticky bar. Dont get me started on the food, service. Stay home and eat paper. Ugh",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-buffalo?start=20
