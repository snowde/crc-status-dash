Karen C.,"Osseo, MN",0,13,,5.0,1/12/2016,"Grant was a great bartender! Had wine, beer and appetizers! He directed us to the bar specials and was great throughout the entire time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville?start=20
Joe F.,"Burnsville, MN",1,10,5,2.0,5/2/2015,The service is really going down hill. This is one of my daughter's favorite places. We had a really easy two burgers and a kid's spaghetti.  We also ordered a spinach artichoke dip to start. The two tables by us who ordered after got there food first and we never got our appetizer. She said she forgot to enter it. We won't be back anytime soon,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville?start=20
Samuel W.,"St Paul, MN",155,147,228,1.0,5/1/2013,"I know. It's Friday's. It's a huge shitty chain that's interchangeable with about five other restaurants. That being said, I went into the ordeal wholeheartedly anticipating mediocrity; instead, I learned that there's no way you can guarantee a decoupaged turd is thoroughly cooked. More on that important life lesson later. I do a weekend job with people that have disabilities. There's one guy in particular that has Down's Syndrome. He has to participate in regular huge spend downs (he has a legitimate job--for now--that brings in an assload of money and the government will cut off his already minimal funding if his account gets too high... this will be a real problem if he's forced into early retirement which happens regularly) so I'm often taking him out shopping. He loves places like this and mentioned that he was in the mood for Applebee's. Being that this place is the same damn thing, I took him here because we were close. Damn me. Damn my decisions. Experiencing less than favorable service when I take him out is not an uncommon thing as sad as that sounds. I think a lot of people see him and assume that he doesn't deserve decency or won't notice poor quality. But he does and so do I. Our waitress came over to us and instantly fell to her knees by the table, crouched awkwardly and asked what we wanted to drink. Apparently, standing was hard because this theme continued. He got a coke and I opted for a cherry lime crush. I won't bore to death with the details, but it took me about twenty minutes to get my drink. During this time, she was busy half-ass bussing the empty tables around us and actively ignoring that we were ready to order. Finally, she came back. We started with the pick three option--green bean fries, boneless rum wings and cheese sticks--and Tom chose the Korean steak tacos. I got a small steak with a couple of blah sides that I can't even recall. She wandered off back to the kitchen. And the waiting commenced.  Tom asked me a couple times if she didn't like us because everyone else seemed to be getting serviced. But, you know, he doesn't notice things like that. Our app came out. I started splitting the portions in half and we both had a cheese stick. It seemed lukewarm but it was edible enough. The green bean fries were all right. I went to take a bite of the chicken and thought something tasted off. It was slathered in sauce so I made a clean cut on another piece to check it out. It was so fucking raw that it was craning its neck to eat the green beans next to it. I instantly chucked all the pieces onto the larger platter and we both proceeded to feel grossed out. The waitress walked by us a couple times, saw me trying to get her attention out of the corner of her eye and suddenly changed her path. I noticed Tom kept looking back and forth between the platter of salmonella and I. He reached over, grabbed a corner of the plate, started wiggling it back and forth and craned his head to emit the most glorious 'Bock bock BOOOCK' noise I've ever heard. I'm not an unreasonable person. I know that it wasn't the fault of the waitress; there's no way she could've known it was raw and she didn't cook it. But when I finally was able to get her to the table her reaction was the biggest ""I don't give a shit"" parade sans the confetti that I've ever seen. *insert uninterested voice* ""Oh... yeah, I guess it's raw. Sorry 'bout that."" They brought out more chicken. The lady that came out flopped it down and also handed out a half-assed 'sorry' before wandering off. It was cooked the second time. I will give them that much. Our entrees slowly made their way to the table. Tom nibbled on his tacos but seemed underwhelmed (which is unusual for him, to say the least). When my steak came with a cattle prod and knife rolled up in a napkin, I knew something was up. It was raw. Not medium rare... not even rare. I had to shock it with the prod to stop it from galloping off. Once again, I had to try and flag down the waitress. Her response was even more lukewarm and she asked if I wanted them to throw it back on the grill/microwave. I declined and asked for the check and a box since Tom was done by the time I got her to the table. It took -forever- to get the bill and even longer for the box.  So much was wrong with the dinner that a 57 dollar bill got knocked down to 17 bucks. At no point did a manager approach me and I never saw one walking around. It was pretty dead in the restaurant (Sunday and 6pm) and by the time the dinner was done, both of us were ready to run as fast as we could in the opposite direction. When we were in the car, Tom made the comment, ""that was shitty and I don't want to go back"". I concur, Tom. I concur.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville?start=20
Jason A.,"Rosemount, MN",36,22,2,2.0,2/19/2015,Food was ok at best had to send a steak back. Was child's birthday didn't ask for dessert but they brought him ice cream thought that was nice. Then I got the bill and they charged us for it? Lame. Never asked for it don't bring it next time.

Dave L.,"Burnsville, MN",3,36,,2.0,12/4/2014,"Nothing special here about this place. Carry on, carry on my friends. Food is just your average chow. I'd go to apple bees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville?start=20
Lisa K.,"Burnsville, MN",26,58,9,4.0,11/23/2014,"Last time we visited, our food was perfect.  And, despite it being busy, we were done in under 30 minutes, so we were able to get to the movies on time.  The only downside was that the drinks were a tad pricey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville?start=20
Corey A.,"New Prague, MN",0,4,1,2.0,6/1/2014,"Yet another underwhelming meal at TGI Fridays. When you walk in the place has a stink about it...sort of urinal like. The service is slower than turtle shit and the food is unimpressive. We got our appetizer (deep fried pretzels and grainy cheesy dip) before our drinks! The best part of the visit was the Berry Mojito, however I did pitch the shriveled fruit garnish. Chopped salad was OK. Probably won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville?start=20
Sunny S.,"Waynesville, MO",0,2,8,1.0,12/23/2015,"Horrible service. Messed up two of our orders, did not get refills on drinks, and one of our meals never came corrected. The manager did not come to apologize, we had to ask for the manager. The manager did not seem to care about our concerns. We had to wait twenty minutes for our ticket after we were done eating. I will not be returning to the restaurant again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville?start=20
Lori S.,"Burnsville, MN",0,4,,1.0,7/31/2014,"We will never ever go the Friday's on Buck Hill Rd again. We waited and waited for service, had to send back the cold food. Treated as an unwelcomed guest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville?start=20
Taylor H.,"Savage, MN",21,10,,2.0,7/20/2012,"Disappointed here last Monday night.  Horribly slow kitchen service and grossly inaccurate bill ( more than $20 over) are the first things that come to mind.  At least the manager took care of my wife's entree...loaded down with overcooked steak and sriracha.  Hadn't been to a TGIFs in a long time, might be a long time before we go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville?start=20
heather s.,"Shakopee, MN",0,50,,1.0,9/11/2014,"Never again.  3 of us went today mostly because we really like the bar but decided to eat too.  Drinks were awesome however not when we saw the bill. $33 for 3 margaritas?!?!? ""New and improved"" mozzarella sticks were completely inedible.  Most of the menu has something to do with a jack Daniels sauce or glaze or whatever which non of us were into.   I asked if they had plain chicken tenders without the jacks glaze he said yes than brought me ones with the glaze.   I ate my fries and a couple bites of chicken.   Our waiter was attentive and friendly but TGI Fridays is just not a good place to eat anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville?start=20
Denise B.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,3,,1.0,11/1/2013,"I just had the worst Rib Eye steak ever!  I had been craving a steak for 3 weeks and Rib Eye's my favorite.  I was a little taken back when the waiter suggested that I should order rare instead of medium rare because it was a thinner steak and cooks faster but continued on.  When the waitress brought the steak and demanded that I slice into it to make sure it was to my taste, I got irritated, I would like to eat my food at  my leisure.  The steak was awful, no taste, 1/4 inch thick, couldn't cut it with the knife,ect.  The waiter was kind enough to take it off the bill but I was just plain disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville?start=20

Heidi C.,"Burnsville, MN",0,3,,5.0,6/20/2013,"Love this place, we're here probably at least every other week. Food is amazing, service is always great. My usual favorite is the 2 for $15 deal, I love the potstickers but with rice instead of the lettuce and the Korean tacos, so yummy. The other night I had the dragonfire salmon with the vegetable medley and mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious as usual but the mashed potatoes were seriously the best potatoes I have ever had in my life, no joke. The cajun chicken pasta is also absolutely delectable, I like to add mushrooms to mine but that's just me. For dessert I'd suggest the whiskey cake. I've only been there late at night so we usually sit at the bar but Cory, Amy and Marcus are our usual favorites. Definitely one of our favorite places!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville?start=20

Walid S.,"Davenport, FL",86,125,698,2.0,10/14/2016,"The Classic Cheeseburger was OK. Everything else? though slightly better than the other option(s) was not OK. In fact it was close to horrible. I have not eaten this badly prepared food in a national chain since ... i can't remember when. The staff was nice but that was all the positivity I could muster. Please people for the sake of the red and white stripes and the semi-carnie-dressed servers get your act back in-line.  The nerve to even remove popular items from the ""discount or deals"" offerings..... I am getting the same vibes I got from Chi-Chi's before they unpredictably hit ground bottom. Next time I am going to try another place .... even a fast food s@#t hole would probably fare better. Oh! the Chicken Nacho like dish was OK too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville
Vanessa B.,"Burnsville, MN",136,16,19,4.0,4/23/2017,"Very good service today! A Sunday. Our service was quick to help us get seated, despite she was the Bartender and serving the whole bar section.

Mohammad H.,"Lakeville, MN",124,80,215,3.0,11/23/2016,"I have been to this place many times before. This time I came here on a friday...get it ""Friday"" on Friday. Little pun ;) I had my twins with and we choose this place since it was right by the Movie theater we were going to watch ""Fantastic Beasts"". We were sit immediately since it wasn't busy yet. The server came immediately to get our drinks, so he said he will come back. Kids had some crayons to draw with and knew what they wanted right away. For me I was torn between Steak and Fish. I decided to go with the Mahi Mahi. Our server was great and he was very prompt. I also decided to get a featured drink.  Kids enjoyed their food. But my food took some time to come and I was little disappointed with blandness and way it was cooked. It came on a plank, but the fish was way overcooked. I did love the Jasmin rice and tomato mozzarella salad. I didn't send it back since we were on a tight timeline.  I had their steaks many times and they are good also their appetizers are highly recommended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville
May L.,"Paris, France",14,5,18,3.0,12/16/2017,"Went here after the movies. Shared appetizer platter (boneless wings, mozzarella, potato skins) and dumplings with my husband. Potato skins were super dry and tough. Couldn't eat it. Dumplings weren't fresh. Tasted like it came out of the freezer and was microwaved.  Service was good. She was attentive and refilled our drinks without us having to ask.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville
Granny C.,"Waterloo, IA",0,16,,1.0,3/9/2017,Had a miserable experience with myself and five other diners. Service started slow but took an hour to get food.     Appetizers were cold. Spinach artichoke dip was dry and not creamy. Potato skins were cold and really empty looking with a couple bacon bits. Boneless wings were cold and dry.      Childs sliders were so burned they were inedible. This was a birthday celebration so I was really disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville
Eliot D.,"Reno, NV",24,4,,2.0,12/5/2016,"This is one of the least pleasant Fridays I have been to. It is no fault of  the employees (that I can tell). I sat at the bar and got great service from the bartender. The floor manager checked on me and was very nice. The drinks were less than adequate (i watched the bartender measure everything to a formula so its clearly a systemic issue, not isolated to his abilities).  The food was uninspired.  i used to look forward to getting late night food at another location, years ago. When i went recently everything was updated,  but incredibly bland and overpriced. They are attempting to do stuff thay  is out  of their league. They need to accept the fact that they do mediocre food and just make the best of it. Dont put less food on a plate and try to make it look worthy of top chef when its bland and lacking basic skill.  Additionally, the bar stinks of old floor mats and bleach (or some other strong cleaner). Not a pleasant odor while trying to eat and drink.  Just to re iterate, I wanna say that the staff is very pleasant and accomodating. This location suffers from the insistence of doing things beyond its skill level. Everything on the menus seem to under deliver. This is a problem at the GM and corporate level.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville

Beth N.,"Shakopee, MN",6,31,32,1.0,10/8/2016,"Last Sunday took my family here. Unfortunately, my daughter left my Rayban sunglasses at the table and we didn't realize it until the next morning. Made several calls to the restaurant throughout the next day eventually talking with Jim the manager asking if they had been turned in. Of course they hadn't been and Jim had no intention of asking the servers or the bussers if they had found anything. He was not helpful at all and actually pretty rude. I asked him to take my number and call if they found them. Obviously, haven't heard anything. I know it's our fault for leaving them but it's pretty disappointing about the dishonesty of the TGIF employee who found them and kept them. We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville
Sage D.,"Minneapolis, MN",63,5,1,2.0,5/22/2017,"Just left Friday's with my sister. Food was good and our server was good but the manager on duty was not at all pleasant. I watched him as he made his rounds to ask people how their food was. Although our food had not made it to the table yet, he got close to our table and turned his head up. Almost like in disgust. So our food made it and since the place was not that busy I expected for him to see how we were doing and our food. Nothing. We even made eye contact a couple of times. Still no courtesy or hospitality. Very unprofessional if you don't like blacks. That's your problem not mine. If you step up into a position of importance treat everybody equally. That's all I ask. Have a nice night!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville
Shay F.,"Saint Paul, MN",85,16,2,3.0,10/6/2016,"Same as always , cheap food that is delivered to your table fast. My alternative for fast food.

Dee N.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,13,,1.0,2/25/2016,"As a regular customer, I always enjoyed every time coming here, but not anymore last night.  I was kicked out from the restaurant by Cassie for just having a cup ice coffee. Cassie took the order, brought the food and then later noticed that I was drinking a Burger King ice mocha coffee.  They don't sell ice mocha coffee here. And I was willing to pay $20 for an ice mocha coffee if there was available here.  She wanted me to give up my ice mocha coffee. Instead, I gave up the meal and continued enjoying my coffee inside my car in the parking lot as she wished. My sister decided to give up the meal also. What the heck of the deal!, it was just a glass of a ice mocha coffee. I argued with my sister not to pay for the order we have not touched any yet. She insisted and fooled me to unlock the car to grab her purse and ran into the restaurant to pay for the food she ordered any way. What a looser Cassie, you took her payment. May I remind you this.  You are working in hospitality industrial. You don't know how much effort and money your management put into the promotion & advertisement to draw in both new and repeat businesses. And then a loser like you are chasing them away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-burnsville

I do not understand how this place is still open.  We only ordered two appetizers, nothing complicated.  The food was poor quality.  Our plates were dirty and when we asked for new ones,  our waitress said ""oh ok"".  An apology of some sort would have been the proper way to respond for those of us who understand the basic concept of customer service.    The meal ended with less than half of the food being consumed.  To end it all my husband pointed at something above us.  I looked up to see the dirtiest dust lined wall I've ever seen except in a condemned home.  I'm sure some of those dust bunnies ended up on our table.

Kathleen K.,"Farmington, MN",24,293,5,2.0,5/4/2013,"I know better, really I do. But my brother picked the restaurant. His burger came out and while they agreed to cook it medium, it was well-done. I ordered the langostino covered salmon and it was over-cooked with few langostinos. In all fairness our server offered to replace the food but we refused. And the manager came by later to offer s free dessert. Service was excellent. Friday's used to be great about 20 years ago and I am not sure why the food has suffered so much over the past 10 years.
