Kathe K.,"Carlsbad, CA",169,197,54,3.0,5/11/2015,"I went there to meet a business associate at 3pm on a Monday.  We had drinks and discussion. I thought that the wait staff were perfect in the amount of times they came to the table.  They were not obtrusive, yet when we needed refills they were there. They also did not make us feel guilty that we did not order any food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3
Theresa N.,"San Diego, CA",628,410,813,1.0,8/25/2015,"I remember the times while in college,  my friends and I were big fans of TGIF. Alas, their glory days appear to be setting into to a dismal sunset. We went here to try to catch some happy hour after shopping at the outlets.  (FYI - they are the only ones in that little center that have happy hour on Sundays...  3-6pm yo).  We were seated promptly and ordered a couple of drinks and a few HH food items... So...the one star in this review is for our server.  He was a sweetheart and genuinely offered good service, to the best of his ability. The food though,  I have yet to figure out what the heck was up with it.  I ordered a baked potato, which was great with the sour cream and chives. The drinks (Zombies) were good too, and priced well at $7. But the shrimp cocktails...we struggled to finish them!  I've ordered it at TGIF before,  but this time they tasted old and defrosted (kinda rubbery) and the ahi chips were old too... stale chips and fishy tasting ahi (oxymoron, I know).  It was terrible.  My fiancé and I felt sick until the next morning!  Definitely a final nail in the coffin for me and my TGIF days.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3
Heidi I.,"Oceanside, CA",373,515,1161,3.0,4/11/2015,"It's a TGI Fridays, I was not expecting the most fabulous dining experience of my life.  We were ""camping"" down the street overnight and rode our bikes up for a late dinner.  We thought we'd hit Fridays since they advertise a Late Night Happy Hour.  We got there a bit after 9pm.  That Late Night HH starts at 10pm. Was sort of disappointed in the service in general to start out, it got better by the end of the night, maybe because I got buzzed and stopped caring.  But the first bartender was kind of....bitchy?  Maybe just trying to be ""sassy"" and it came off wrong.  The other one was nicer.   We ordered wings....traditional.  Off the bar menu.  Would have been super sweet for them to NOT hide the ""endless appetizer"" menus from us...because had we known, we'd have gotten the boneless wings rather than the traditional ones, which would have been a way better deal, as we could have gotten a few more of them and skipped one of the other things we ended up ordering later. And when my boyfriend (who does not pay as much attention to these things as I do) goes to order a beer at 9:55pm, how about be cool and say, hey, wait 5 minutes and it'll be on Happy Hour!  Just kind of lame, on top of the not giving us the other menu for the wings...seemed like they were steering us away from the offered deals, to get a higher check total...well that doesn't guarantee a bigger tip.  It actually guarantees an average tip.  Because if you were trying to be helpful and cool and point us in the right direction to save a few bucks, then you'd have gotten a better than average tip.   The food is consistent, they have a full bar, etc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3
Christina L.,"Fallbrook, CA",45,25,21,1.0,3/8/2015,"I want to start this review by saying TGI Friday's is my absolute favorite restaurant and I begged my date to take me here. With that being said I want to explain my one star review.  Honestly, if zero stars was an option I would have easily given them zero. My date and I ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer, petite sirloin (medium rare) as his and Jack Daniels chicken as mine. We were there over 45 minutes, and only saw our waitress once (who didn't tell us her name), before we got our food. Which 45 minutes for the main course is fine but we never received our chips and salsa or silverware. His ""medium rare"" sirloin came and he poked it and it started gushing blood. Don't know why he poked it but he did. He had his food for maybe a minute and the waitress was already out of sight so he eats his side's, which were ok. Waitress finally comes back and he shows her that the food is not medium rare and asks for it to be cooked longer. Comes back 10 minutes later and it is solid brown. Also not medium rare... Chips were stale. Salsa was fine.  My chicken was dry but my salad and potatoes were fine. Side note: the couple beside us ordered endless appetizers as her meal and he ordered a salad and a Jack Daniels burger. She (same waitress) brings out his burger and he told her to take the salad off the bill since he never received it.  Another side note: there was a blonde (long hair pulled back in a pony tail with curl to it), skinny waitress working the same section we were in (sadly not our waitress) who was working her butt off, making sure her customers were happy and attended to. Not gonna lie, she made me jealous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3
Spencer P.,"Vista, CA",0,2,1,1.0,12/21/2014,"So I went here on a Sunday afternoon after helping my friend move and I wanted to relax with my friends and have a beer. We saw the great happy hour deals online and said, lezzz gooo.  Soo I really don't feel like writing a long review, but to sum it up, we went in, tried to get a $4 domestic beer and wanted to split the appetizer sampler (both on special menu). It turned out that, even though on the menu it saids the beer is made in Colorado, that it was not technically domestic, and that I choose one of the appetizer that wasn't on the special. So at the point I realized these specials weren't very special. It seemed like you were paying so much just for the environment, so I looked on yelp for somewhere else and found this gem tip top meats.  Tip top meats is right across the street and is one of the best places I've been to. Its an underrated hole in the wall with cheap beer, and huge serving of German meats and sides for under $10. I got roast beef cooked in pork with a salad, French fries, potato salad, a dinner roll and a third of a pitcher of beer for about $13. It was so much I couldn't finish and that's not like me at all. And my god was the meat so so good. Ahh it was amazing. I got the Holsteiner Schnitzel and let's just say it was soo good I decided to write my first yelp review.  Anyways I'm getting bored of typing, but TGIF is over priced and your paying for the atmosphere where you can get basically just as good atmosphere and amazing food form a non-chain delicious hole in the wall right across the street. Thanks for reading. -Spencer",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3
Ashley M.,"Phoenix, AZ",311,121,78,2.0,1/29/2016,"Not the Friday's experience that I hoped for. Yes the food was good but this place was so depressing I couldn't get out fast enough. Typical Friday's menu, steak was great. I never order anything without the delicious JackDaniels sauce.  This is located in the Carlsbad by the Sea Resort. If the atmosphere in the hotel is anything like this restaurant, I wouldn't recommend that either.  On a Friday night this place was a ghost town. No hostess, and the employees were just there to get by. No smiles, hardly any music. It was all just bland and depressing.  They either need to relocate or remodel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3
Mike K.,"San Diego, CA",105,34,5,1.0,10/1/2016,No I know why this place has 2.5 stars terrible service not our waiter but the fact the management can't schedule enough staff for a large party!

Dimples C.,"Carlsbad, CA",2,18,25,2.0,10/2/2015,"I've been here weekends, weeknights, lunch, dinner, happy hour, etc... you name it. Service has always been crappy! They take forever to send a waiter to greet you and even longer to bring your drinks and food out. Even when the restaurant is empty service is horrible! I can think of one time I got a great waitress. Food is bland and almost always over cooked. No flavor and burnt equals no fun! Happy hour drinks barely have any alcohol and too much ice! What the hell?! After a few being sent back, I got tired of telling them what was wrong. Tables are dirty, sticky and so are the seats. I always feel I have to clean them myself before I sit down.  Why do I keep coming back you ask? The Jack Daniels sauce! Thus the 2 stars. This is the only restaurant that I know serves it and I love it! LOL This used to be my happy hour spot with the girls since we love our JD's sauce but after giving them PLENTY of chances to improve, we're moving on. For the price of their food and drinks there are plenty of other restaurants that have better quality food and great service.  Btw, since my last visit there's a new manager and let's just say she's something that rhymes with ""witch!"" I can see why her employees don't seem to care about customer service.

Elvis T.,"Long Beach, CA",105,185,198,1.0,9/17/2015,"So we decided to come in tonight. No one in the front to welcome or seat us, and I remembered them having a sign to seat ourselves one time so we did. Made eye contact with one of the servers while we selected a booth so we sat and waited for our menus. He never said ""Hi"" or smiled at us. 10 minutes go by and we never got out menus while he's walking around and talking to his coworker. Seeing that, we upped and walked out to go where customers were welcomed. If you decide to come to this place, go during the day.. maybe there will be more welcoming and positive servers then. After seeing the reviews and experiencing the rude staff. I suggest this place to undergo new management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3
D B.,"Oceanside, CA",2,110,7,2.0,7/26/2015,"Ate here during happy hour yesterday. We were seated right away, and the place was almost empty. Ashley was our server. I ordered A Dos XX and double shot of Grand Mariner neat. My fiancé ordered a mixed drink which also has GM in it. She brought me my beer and informed me they were out of GM and offered to get me something else. I declined, so she left and came back after she discovered the drink my fiancé ordered could not be made because they were out of GM. So she ordered something else.   I noticed they were offering Cuervo Gold shots for $3ea so I ordered 2 of them. She said she didn't think I could order that because it was happy hour, and should get a well drink instead. I asked what she meant by that.....again she had to go ask. So I asked when I could order the $3 shots. She asked me to show here where I saw that price. I pointed to the huge poster on their wall advertising it. So she went to talk to the bar tender and returned saying the offer is good all day whether or not its happy hour. So I ordered them, and she delivered them with a male with some limes.  She was nice, checked on us often, but not knowledgeable about the bar and promotions.  I had a rib eye steak(I like Filet Migon, but is not on the menu) and it was chewy. The mashed potatoes and seasoned fries were good. Fiance had a chicken dish and she liked it.  All in all, we probably wont be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3

Richard M.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",4,66,6,1.0,7/28/2015,"Haven't been here in a few years, and dinner tonight made me remember why. Saw the TV add for $10 all you can eat appetizers. Which we found out you pick one and have to stay with that. Or $12 and you could pick from 5 things and switch off whenever you want. It was me and my girl, so we each got an appetizer, The food they brought us after 15-20 min of waiting was wrong, no problem we were hungry and planning to get one of everything anyways. Second round some random waitress brought us some wrong wings, ended up being for a different table, 20 min later finally got the right food. 3rd round was the correct food also but had to wait another 15-20 min to get it. Out of everything the only thing I thought was good was the cheese sticks. Waitress wasn't the best service I've ever had but she was nice and despite disappearing a few times wasn't too bad.  We went on a Monday night at like 8pm I could understand the wait time if it was the weekend but seriously on a Monday? Won't be going back For the same price I would have been much happier at BJs or Karl Strauss which are a very very short drive from tgi.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3
Teri R.,"Marina del Rey, CA",124,91,28,2.0,9/7/2015,"Initially I was going to give this place one star.   All because of the manager (FW/40 heavy set with red hair in a bun).  She was so rude. We had a party of six and told us the wait would be 25-30 min.  We asked if we could sit at the bar and she said no.  In LA kids can sit at the bar with their parents & I understand that Carlsbad has different rules.  But as I walked away she gave me the dirtiest look.  We walked outside to see if everyone wanted to wait.   I walked back in and told her we would wait.  This was at 7:45pm.  8:15pm another member of our party asked how long it would be and she told him at 8:30.  Before it was 25-30 min now it's exactly at 8:30,, 45 min.  How could they know for the table would be ready exactly at 8:30? I didn't mention how empty the restaurant was or how people after us had been seated before us.  The other member of our party told them we would split our party but of course our table was ready.  When she seated us we saw an elderly couple that had come in after Us was seated in a booth for 8 people.  That's when I knew the manager was being an AH.  Our server was a really nice girl who did a great job with juggling tables and the bar.  The food was ok.  The steak seemed as if they were preheated.   The manager is suppose to be the rock of an organization but instead she was the problem.  Maybe you should invest more into your managers so employees can have a better example.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3
Cathy N.,"Long Beach, CA",507,499,148,1.0,3/30/2014,"My family and I came here on Saturday night while in town for vacation. We understood there would be a wait, and were quoted at a 20-25 minutes for a table (party of 8). After waiting about 40 minutes, we checked in with the hostess and were told it would be another 15-20 minutes. They told us that the kitchen was backed up, and even if they sat us in 20 minutes though, we wouldn't get our food for at least another hour. ARE YOU F-ING KIDDING?? 2 hours for food after being told 20-25??? We were swindled and robbed of our time. We had 6 hungry adults and 2 starving children.  It was a terrible mess, and a complete waste. Needless to say, we told them to forget it and we went down the street to eat at In-n-Out. Had we known service would be so terrible at TGI Friday's, we never would have stepped foot inside. Not recommended, will never be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3

Kitty C.,"Encinitas, CA",42,164,669,3.0,7/24/2015,"Went here for my anniversary because I wanted to try the endless apps. Husband got the fish and chips, it was $11.99 but it was alright. No coleslaw was given, just cod fish and fries with tartar sauce. It was good when it first came out but once it got cold, the fish was no longer good and it tasted like it came from a freezer. I am a appetizer addict and was super excited to try endless apps. It's $12 for all you can eat but the selection is limited. I would prefer to come during happy hour than try endless apps again. The app selection is mozzarella sticks, potstickers, flatbread chicken, loaded baked potato skins and boneless wings and that's it. You can only order one app at a time. Happy hour is a lot better because the selection is more and I believe it's half off. Overall, the potato skins were definitely better than usual and the food was decent for the price. Will probably come back, but during happy hour pricing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3

Our waiter was great, positive personality, really helpful, attentive and overall a pleasure to have at our table - but the food was way below our expectations. The spinach dip tasted like it  was diluted with water, wings were tiny and hard as if they had been in the deep freeze for years. Sliders were a decent size, but size isn't the same as quality. The flat bread topped with pesto and tomatoes was HORRIBLE. I can't believe they let these leave the kitchen.

Nancy J.,"Lynwood, CA",22,10,,1.0,10/29/2014,"This place is the WORST! They don't deserve this one star at all. My family and I stopped here while visiting Legoland for my nieces and daughters birthday. We were seated quickly and after about 10-15 minutes someone came to get our drink order. Mind you, this place was a ghost town, so i'm not really sure what took so long. After getting our drinks we waited almost 20-25 minutes before our hostess took our order.  After another 25-30 mins went by and we asked about our food as our host passed our table and she looked confused ... like, when did you people get here?! The food was barely warm when it arrived and they forgot some of our plates. We asked for 2 birthday sundaes and they forgot one and only sang Happy Birthday to one of the two birthday girls. Our kids were falling asleep at the table so I didn't even ask that they bring another sundae in fear that we might be waiting all night. When we finished we waited around for a check and ONE to-go box... literally looking for anyone to flag down but they were no where in sight. I really think they were all back there drinking. After another 20 mins the hostess came back with a half ass apology and excuse about how busy she was. (reminder... there is about 2 other small groups in there with us). The to-go box came 10 mins later after our hostess gave ours away to the next table, who had just sat down to order lol. This place was ridiculous!!

Also, the man had a near sh!t fit when we got dirty share plates with the appetizer.  They looked like they came out of a bus boy's dirty dish tub, so I don't blame him for raising a stink.  The server handed us a new set of plates over the bar area, but didn't seem too remorseful over giving dirty stuff out... so not only is the back of the house negligent, the front seems a bit apathetic.

We met our waiter and he gladly moved us to our preferred location. He was super nice and accommodating.  He too was a little funky, he seemed to be high energized and quick.

Erich C.,"Oceanside, CA",542,487,1437,2.0,9/1/2013,"The windmill that sits perched above the I-5 freeway at the Palomar Airport Road exit is one of the iconic symbols of Carlsbad.  It's a landmark that symbolizes the fact the Flower Fields, Premium Outlets and Legoland are nearby as well as the miles of sandy beaches.  Unfortunately, the TGI Friday's that's connected to this windmill is a tourist trap chain restaurant that's full of wife-beater clad families and crying babies.  Honestly I've never seen a restaurant with more whaling babies and birthday celebrations (I heard at least five while we were there) as this one. I've come here a few times since I live in Carlsbad but this last time was the last time.  I knew it was going to be rough when we sat down on a completely wet booth seat.   Clearly they wiped it down but it was soaking wet.  We only had one set of utensils.  I had to steal some from another table. We decided to go balls-to-the-wall and order steak, lobster, ribs, pizza, and a burger for our family of four.  The food (at over $20 each for the steak/lobster/ribs) was over-cooked, bland and tiny.  I could barely scrape any meat from the lobster tail.  The rib-eye I ordered was puny and tasteless.  I could get a one-pounder at Stater Bros. for $4.99 and cook it myself in half the time it took for the food to come out.  I don't get it.   The drinks were over $8 each and lacked much alcohol.  I would have even taken  the rubbing alcohol version we've heard about in the news if given the choice but no such luck. The bright spot was our waiter.  I can't remember his name (he was a young african-american guy) but he was very nice, had a great attitude and was very attentive.  It's a shame he has to work in this dump. He should move next door to BJ's.  We tipped him well despite the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=20

Monica D.,"Orange County, CA",751,678,46,2.0,1/7/2013,"I absolutely HATE giving any TGIF's such a mediocre (at best) rating, but our experience here deserves nothing more. I adore the TGIF franchise; having been a patron ever since I can remember, my family and I have enjoyed consistently great service at every one we've encountered. This location is a sad exception. The FK and I did come in a bit early, I must say, but apparently SO early that we could not be seated at a barside table. Fair enough. We understood and decided to sit at the bar itself. When our bartender/server was around, she was very friendly and okay on efficiency -- but I did notice a lot of extracurricular socializing with other employees. Now, I get it, I used to work in the biz and I know that opening can be a total downer. But when it comes at the expense of serving customers -- it's a huge no-no. Both the FK and I had to wait at different times to request different things, which made it even MORE awkward because we essentially were the only people in here. To make matters even worse, we saw other patrons seated at the barside tables shortly after our arrival. There wasn't even any attempt by that vapid cute little hostess to address us after the fact. Ugh. I hate that. To sum it up for you all: even a decently priced all-day happy hour (on Sundays) is not worth the grief coming in here. The entire place is suffering from complacency, riding the coattails of being a TGIF and also receiving automatic clientele from an attached hotel. The whole experience is just awkward and meh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=20

Drinks: Orange Creamsicle in mason jar= Delicious!               Chocolate coffee = Delicious! Ask to have chocolate drizzled on the bottom of the cup and add cream. Best fast food coffee Food seemed as though it was brought out as soon as it came off the grill. Piping hot steak (Medium rare to perfection) and burger.

I do like TGIF I really do although it has not always been a convience near by so I usually will go to its competitors such as Applebees or Chillis etc....Anyhow on Veteran's Day just like a lot of places they had a special going.  Buy one get one free for Retired and Active Duty.  Being a military brat and now a spouse of an active duty member I know these kind of deals are great but expect a wait.  We had no problem waiting 2 hours for a meal it was the staff that was the problem.... When we arrived we were told it would take 20-25 mintues for us to be seated....a lie.....We knew in our heads this will at least be an hour to two hour wait no problem.  We sat and chit chatted while waited to be seated.  After an hour passed we were still fine waiting but the hostess decided to cut in our conversation and tell us she thinks we should leave because it is going to be another two hour wait plus and additonal hour and a half to get served.  We were shocked since we were not complaining and minding our own business relaxing,  Why she was so rude and wanting to kick us out?  We go offended and left upset.  I also want to not the hostess did this to several other people as we were waiting. I think the object should of been to maintain costumers not boot them out the door especially after an hour of waiting... Anyhow, The next day I called the manager and he was also upset about what happended.  The only reason why I am giving this place 3 stars is because he totally made it up to us.  We able to come in the next day and receive a complimentary dinner on the house with the works.  kudos for the manager thumbs down for the hostess.  Our service the second night was great! And I was glad the manager made sure we were taken care of and went out of his way to see smiles.   We also noticed other customers were receiving this great treatment as well.  I think this experience on this particular day was a growing one for the location and it will help them improve thier staff.  So would I go here again yes....was it pleasant the first time no but hey everyone deserves a second chance and I am glad we took them up on the offer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=60

We all ordered something different.  1 item from the children's menu...I'll start with that.  My son actually asked ""how big is the burger?""  He was VERY hungry and would have ordered off the adult menu if the waitress didn't assure him that the childrens cheese burgers were ""HUGE"" and it would fill him up.  He is small for his size and age (11) but I told her he has a larger appetite than he looks.  Again, she assured us the burger would be enough.  It wasn't even close.  It was plain and she rolled her eyes when he asked for ketchup...ayfkm?  He cleaned his plate and ate most of my veggies...and we will wrap back to those in a moment.   My husband ordered a Reuben sandwich...now there are 3 - arguably 5- things that make a Reuben a Reuben.  Corned beef, thousand island and sauerkraut -rye bread and provolone cheese..but whatever.  His came out with zero sauerkraut....but a TON of grilled onions.  Not that big of a deal...but he WANTED the kraut.  So he asked for some on the side.  10 freaking minuets later they let us know that they were completely OUT.  He was pissed.  So he sent it back.  The manager came over and said the kitchen was upset that he didn't like it but that he had started to eat it.  (he took 2 bites)..how many freaking people inspect to make sure their order is correct?  Yeah, that is dumb.   At this point the rest of the food had finally come out...yeah, it came out one plate at a time.   He ordered an app and said he wasn't happy with the Reuben and wouldn't be paying for it.   My father in law's pasta was cold...and not just sitting on the side waiting to come out cold...like freaking frozen in the middle COLD.  My mother in laws steak was over cooked so she sent it back...they cooked it through...she just ate it.  My older sons ribs were UNDER cooked and we sent those back.  I am just going to skip my salmon...but you get the idea.   The manager convinced us to order cheesecake.  I asked how big they were...here we go again...I'd prefer for the children to share.  But she insisted the slices were tiny...so they both got their own...they are HUGE.  ha of course.  I did have a bite as well as my husband and the cheesecake was very good...the only thing that was.     NOW for the check...they had the wine they were out of on there...claiming I had a glass.  HAHAHHA no - I didn't...I had water, not wine.  The Reuben was on there as well as the app and cheese cake...nothing was comped.  All the problems we had and sending so much back and they didn't even comp us the cheesecake the manager said we would.....My husband now was LIVID...and still hungry.  The manager came over and took the check.  We had to negotiate the damned check.  wine (that they were OUT OF !!!) should come off, Reuben OFF, and at least 1 cheesecake.  She wasn't happy but she ended taking all that off and my husbands app.  Well, thanks.  At this point that little gesture is meaningless.   We couldn't get home soon enough...guess what now...that app, the only thing my husband actually ate...came right back up.  We had to pull over 3 times for him to vomit.  Awesome.   Stay away from this place...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=60

It wasnt busy at all which was great but the people that were here that day was a pretty quiet crowd. Generally when you sit at the bar you expect to have some small conversations with some cool/weird people...who knows! Maybe youll find your next gf here haha. Well when I was there I was being stared at from across the bar by some weird couple, I kept checking my face to see if it was really that ugly but that wasnt the case. So I stared back at them (stare contest began) and I held my ground until my eyes dried out then I looked down at my empty beer lol.  I like the fact that they have two options of cup size, one is 16 and the other is 22oz. I would recommend you take advantage of the 22oz deal since the cost for it is only 2-$3 more!! I cant say much but the fact that the people that do go here is families and older people (50+) but I will update my review next time I come back, but for now 3 stars because it didnt really wow me in any way and plus I was at the bar so I pretty much serviced myself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=60

It was a little unexpected but it was pretty entertaining and funny to watch.  I got the Cobb Salad which basically had the standard cobb salad fixings; bacon, egg, blue cheese, grilled chicken, avocado, cheddar chese, etc but they add olives to theirs which I asked to remove. The cobb salad was pretty good and got no complaints from me.  The hubby got the turkey club with french fries - no complaints there either.

Upon being seated and served, the service was incredibly slow and inattentive, the whole ordeal took over two hours. Being from the service industry I always leave a tip, but I genuinely could not tip because we had such a terrible experience.  Then again, I should have known to not go there.

Jesse Q.,"Escondido, CA",23,80,7,1.0,3/18/2013,"Absolute worst experience! Last Saturday I go for a bike ride and afterwards I was feeling a bit hungry so made plans and girl and I head out to TGI Fridays. Have been to the place once or twice before (that location) but not had food as I was meeting friends for drinks before. Upon arriving we get greeted and give them our name for seating. As usual I prefer seating in a booth so we wait for our booth and once they are ready we walk through the bar to go grab our booth. We get dragged to the last booth right before getting to the kitchen and we are asked if that's fine; having  just passed a booth that wasn't as close to the kitchen we choose that one and step back to it and sit. We get seated and menus on the table. A couple of minutes go by and the server comes and takes our drink order, asks if we are ready for our food order, we weren't, and goes and gets our drinks. Could notice this server was in training but no big deal, you expect the same service anyway. We get our drinks and we order our food, they have a 2 for $20 deal so we order though that: - Cheeseburger (medium rare) with sweet potato fries, no onions (upcharge of $1.79 for sweet potatoes without being told about it) - Chicken pasta - Spinach Florentine Flatbread Server advises us we get another appetizer through this promo so we order the second appetizer, Mozzarella sticks. After we order we wait for our food now. I had ordered a diet coke with no ice, and I received my diet coke with ice...no surprise there. The beverage was also not sufficiently carbonated which I assume it's a matter of bad/old equipment. The restaurant is in an old building so it makes sense. After a few minutes I see the server come by and notices there's nothing on the table yet, does not say anything just walks back. Forgot to put the order in? Yup! We get the appetizers in two rounds, first the mozzarella sticks and later the flatbread. I assume we got the mozzarella sticks first as they take less time to prepare. A few minutes later we receive the flatbread which in my taste didn't cook properly, it was not crispy as expected, but the taste was ok. Entree time and our food arrives, a smallish burger that came frozen no doubt and the pasta with chicken that was actually tasty. The burger sat in the food warmers for a while, the lettuce was starting to cook (black color) and was warm to the touch. The burger was cooked well and the fries were a pittance! I did not complain at all as I imagined it was ordered as part of a ""value menu"" as well as not knowing about the upcharge on the fries. Everything went well, during dinner, food was not worth writing home about but it was within expectations. Nothing to report during dinner other than my cup of diet coke kept getting more ice with every refill. But then came the check... The check came to be much higher than I expected to begin with and that's when I started getting annoyed... Take 1: Call the server (trainer) who gave us the check and told him about the mistake, every entree and appetizer was put on as a ""regular"" not as a ""Promo."" He promptly takes the check and comes back about 10 minutes later with the revised check. Take 2: The revised check comes but charges for the second appetizer...I call the server (trainer) again and he explains that only one appetizer is included. I replied that only one appetizer was ordered until we were told that another appetizer was included. Goes back and another 10 minutes go by for the revised check. Finally get the last check with a comped appetizer (regardless at $7.99 for the mozzarella sticks, it's highway robbery!) and I square it off! Got to thinking after I left the restaurant that there were no potatoes in my plate but...too late. The server was in training but that should not have made a difference. At that point we check the yelp reviews and...no wonder! In short: Value in food was bad. Quality of service was bad, ambiance was also mediocre (kept hearing the kitchen all night).

I say this because we can't figure out how they managed to mis-time our meals by so much that my boyfriend's food was cold when it arrived at the table. It was so cold that he had to return it to the kitchen, which left me to eat my meal alone before it got cold too. My food was very good though. I ordered the 10 oz. sirloin and had mashed potatoes and french fries (what can I say? I'm a potato-lovin girl!) on the side. Once my boyfriend's food arrived hot, it was tasty too.

Adri M.,"Glendale, AZ",136,12,1,1.0,3/10/2012,"Unfortunately this wasn't the best location of TGIF i have been to. Before i get to the bad parts, the caesar salad was good and they have the most amazing breadsticks! The part that wasn't great was the chicken bruschetta pasta, which looked amazing. The pasta came out about cold and and it was not anywhere close to amazing. Definitely a let down. The service was also a little slow. Cheap menu but not worth it. Not this location..I also would like to point out that when we couldn't find the drink menu the waitress didn't know where it was, so she named a few beers they had but forgot the rest on the menu. When we did receive our drinks she accidentally spilled the water on my menu/table. not cool! -_- (Now i am editing my review after i just finished.) Turns out i had just got a call from my boyfriend who paid for our dinner last night. TGIF charged $260.00 on his card for this $26.00 meal. Looks like now i definitely will not be coming back here. Really poor service for a place that wasn't even busy. These waiters need to pay attention to these kind of things.. Not acceptable and i will be lowering the 2 stars to 1 now. :/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=120

Glenn M.,"Oceanside, CA",0,12,,1.0,11/14/2014,"I had read all of the reviews talking about the bad service and figured they had to be wrong. No place can be that bad.  Well, I am reporting that they were all wrong! This place is even worse than everybody says!  It started by not even being able to find the restaurant.  It is buried on the side of a hotel and there is no sign outside to indicate the entrance to the restaurant. It is crazy. Once inside, we waiting for about 10 minutes for someone to come over to the check-in desk. The restaurant was almost empty, but the two servers they had were running in circles.  When someone came over they asked if they could take my name. I asked why they needed to take my name when nobody was there and there were tons of open tables. They said ""we needed to wait for a table.""  It was very strange, but we finally got seated. Once we sat down we waited another 10 minutes to get menus and then another 10 minutes to even get a glass of water.  We went for the ""endless appetizers"" and one kids meal. It took 45 minutes for the food to come out. When we asked for another round of apps, it took another 30 minutes to get them.  After being there for more than an hour and half, we had received two rounds of appetizers. One of the apps we ordered were the Ahi Tuna Crisps. They put three on the plate and each is the size of a tortilla chip, so we ate these pretty quickly, but we couldn't wait another 30 minutes to get three more crisps.   We has also ordered the potato skins, but these tasted sour so we wanted to send them back.  The waitress said we ""weren't allowed to swap out the appetizer."" We said that we didn't like it and it was bad. After some back and forth, she allowed us to get something else. The waitress told us that they other server was taking the food that was meant for our table, so she had to put our orders back in. The place was empty!  This made no sense at all. I am not sure how Friday's corporate office can let this location stay open. It is a joke and makes us never want to go to another Fridays.  We were told that they would take one app and the kids meal off the bill. When the bill came we were still charged for the two apps. They said they took off the potato skins that we didn't eat.  I pushed back and they finally adjusted the check. If you are in the area, PLEASE avoid this place. All of the reviews that talked about the bad service were actually being kind. It is worse than you can ever imagine.

The server we had was new and it showed. Although she was incredibly sweet, she was slow and inattentive. She passed our table several times without asking if everything was ok or even to ask if we needed refills on our drinks. It took over 30 minutes just to get our appetizers and we were there for the unlimited appetizer deal they have going on. When were finishing our last appetizer I found a strawberry in our flatbread bbq pizza which DID NOT include strawberries at all. My sister is highly allergic to strawberries. Nothing we ordered contained strawberries nor should it have been around anything that contained strawberries. We went to the manager immediately and told him what was going on and he proceeded to tell us that we should have informed our server of any food allergies. We didn't think to notify them because after all we ordered wings and pizza, none of which contain strawberries. He then told us that it was our fault. After going back and forth with him for a few minutes he agreed to give us discount. The discount was not our intention at all. After we received our final receipt we noticed that he had only taken off our drinks. A whole $5 worth. He was rude and and completely unapologetic. He told us that it was our fault for not informing our server and that all of the same utensils and knives are used to prepare ALL the dishes. Needless to say we will never be back to this location. Their lack of courtesy and sympathy was felt and definitely made us uncomfortable.

Back in late December, we were coming back from a San Diego Chargers game and took a exit where we thought there would be some casual sit-down places.  There was not much around except for this Friday's.  Friday's would not be our first choice, but we wanted to just eat and get going. This Friday's was a little different (at least from the outside).  It was attached to a Days Inn.  Not a standard Days Inn either.  It had a house-like structure at the front entrance--almost like a bed and breakfast.  The decor was your standard Friday's. We ordered a half order of potato skins, which was a decent portion size.  The potato skins were topped with cheese and bacon.  Sour cream on the side.  The potato skins were nicely crisp and not too greasy.  The portion of cheese and bacon was what you would expect at a Friday's.  Some skins were evenly topped while some skins were only half covered with cheese. Most of us had the Jack Daniel's flat iron steak, and it was surprisingly good.  The steak was a good cut of meat.  It was tender and flavorful and cooked a perfect medium rare.  The Jack Daniel's thin sauce on the side was nicely sweet.  The loaded mashed potatoes came stuffed with cheddar cheese, green onions and bacon.  The mashed potatoes were okay.  The menu announced the calorie count on most of the dishes to tell you what kind of trouble you were getting yourself into.  There was also a portion of steamed broccoli that (while nothing special) at least added some vegetables and something green to the plate. Service was quick enough and dining there was comfortable.  Near the exit, there was a bell with a rope attached to it that you are supposed to ring if you had a good time.  Many were ringing it.  I gave it a ring too.  For what it was, this Friday's was not that bad and better than what I expected.

Jameson W.,"Overland Park, KS",1,11,,1.0,3/1/2013,"Its no wonder why my wife and I stopped coming here. Every instance is a disappointment. It doesn't matter if it's busy or not and as I draft this, it is not that busy at all. We sat down at 7:20, ordered our drinks and they came at 7:45. We ordered our food at that time and it finally arrived at 8:30. We ordered steak and ribs. The ribs were tough and dry and barely had any meat on them. Possibly cooked off? Her steak was fine as she ordered it well done, but I'm willing to bet that's how all steaks are cooked here because I ordered mine medium rare and it also arrived well done. They were both lukewarm as well. Our server never came by to ask us how our food was, but if he did, I would have sent the steak back and asked them to keep it. I'm not waiting 45 minutes for another one and who knows what they'll do to it.  I can only assume, but I believe this place is under bad management. Its too bad because we thoroughly enjoyed other Fridays locations in the past.  Contact me if this place ever gets better.

Jen C.,"Oceanside, CA",173,16,5,1.0,5/13/2013,"OH MY was this place TERRIBLE!!!  I've been here a few times trying to give them the benefit of the doubt that it was ""x, y, or z"" that made it terrible. I give up...they're just terrible.  So this last trip there was 6 in our party, it was a Saturday night at 10pm and the place was all but dead. 1. The waitress spilled water all over me and didn't apologize or offer to get me a napkin--she did however clean up the table.  2. They were out of not 1, not 2 but 3 things that I tried to order 3. The drink I wanted to order had to be purchased WITH a souvenir glass. I didn't want the glass--just the drink. Apparently they can't do that.  4. It took more than 1 hour to get our food after ordering it...REALLY?!? ...for 6 people at 10pm when the place had 3 other people in it? 5. 4 of their staff were outside on patio smoking almost the entire time we were there...no wonder our food took so long--no one works there.  6. They served everyone their dinner except one person because ""it wasn't ready yet""....who serves a meal to guests separately? Ramsey would be pissed! By the time we were done eating, the last meal came out of the kitchen.  7. The waitress kept forgetting our orders and had to ask multiple times what we ordered.  8. I'm pretty sure the waitress was stoned...I'm not against that IF she could do her job while stoned because in that event its none of my business...but DANG lady you spilled water on me, forgot our orders, forgot that there was food to be served an hour later, and then forgot to bring us our check after we asked for it twice. Lay off the refer!  Overall it was pretty unbelievable.

From the moment we walked in we found out why. This place looked like it was last remodeled in 1992 when the place first opened. It looked very outdated.  Our server only came around periodically and on several occasions we had to flag her down to get some service and this was before the dinner crowd showed up. For being a night of Monday Night Football, the crowd did not seem any larger than a typical week night crowd, yet the staff seemed unprepared. The only reason I'm giving this 1 star was the food was at least decent. We've been to several TGI Fridays before and have enjoyed the food and service but this one is clearly below the mark.

People used to drive out of the way into Carlsbad just for the soup. You could spot it mile away as the location sports a giant windmill.

Mandy D.,"Carlsbad, CA",115,30,,3.0,2/4/2010,"So we had a coupon for buy one get one. We ordered a Jack Daniels flat iron steak and steak fajitas. Without the coupon the bill would have been $35 for both plus two sodas. Luckily the coupon brought it down to $22 and change. Considering the size of the flat iron, it was overpriced. The fajitas had enough food that I was stuffed by the time my stomach settled on the drive home. But my dad was still hungry and he opted to eat dessert at home since the one he wanted at the restaurant was over 1400 calories. He enjoyed the steak and thought it was very good but there were few french fries on the plate and the baked beans we very soupy and too sweet. The steak for fajitas was tender and very good but the onion/pepper combo was overly greasy (my guess the majority of the 1600+ calories in the meal) and the beans, once again, soupy. The rice looked misplaced for tex-mex food seeing as it was yellow (my guess saffron) and looked more like rice you'd eat at a Persian restaurant. There could have been more cheese on the sides plate but it wasn't a big deal. Overall, it was tasty and I did finish it but for $15 it was a bit underwhelming. Can't expect much more from a chain trying to appeal to vast demographics throughout the country (which is why I think the baked beans were more suited to the palate of Southerners). The service was pretty fast but our waitress seemed frazzled, almost like they were understaffed for servers. We probably won't eat there unless we have another BOGO just because it has gotten so expensive and there are plenty of mom and pop places that cost the same without a coupon and more food to take home. The quality was eh, something I expected from a chain restaurant. Major props to our server who did the best she could and was very nice. It's nice that Friday's puts the calorie count on each item but it would be nice for fat and sodium numbers. Granted I hadn't eaten all day so splurging a lot for dinner wasn't a big deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=200

I knew this was the beginning of a horrible night with bad service, and I was right.  Food was forgotten and never brought out, drinks were not filled.  My nephew is 3 and he never got his food,.  We asked for it and it finally came out while we were eating desert... after we had canceled the order with the waitress.  The server didn't know it was my husband's birthday so I had to ask them to sing happy birthday to him.  All of this was discussed when I made reservations.   We had the bill split up from the beginning and when we got the bill there were items that were on the wrong ticket.  I then gave the waitress my rewards number so I can get the points put onto my card.  I checked my rewards a few days later and the points were never added.  At the end of our visit I complained to the manager.  He was very apologetic and said the waitress is in college.  I'm a mother, I work full time and I go to school.  This is not an excuse to give horrible customer service at work.  I didn't buy that excuse.  So the manager gave us a discount.. which I already had a coupon for a discount, and gave me some coupons to come back. I called a few days later after I noticed I didn't get my rewards.  I got the run around and the manager Paublo never called me back.  I gave up.  T.G.I Fridays has lost my business.   My husbands birthday was a disaster and he did not have as great of a time as he would have liked with his family there.  I was so embarrassed in front of his family since I am the one that planned this surprise party.

After a long wait we ordered and waited an even longer time to receive our meals. My meal was wrong so I had to send it back. My fiance was basically done with his meal by the time mine came. The manager gave me my meal for free and was very apologetic.  Our second visit, today for dinner, went at the same slow pace. We were seated right away, typical for a Monday night, but our waiter was very slow in taking down our drink order. There were three other parties seated around us, two of the parties had to flag someone down to ask for a server. I overheard the server two of the parties they were out of something, and we were told as well they were out of an appetizer. Luckily we were in no hurry for both occasions so the slow service wasn't too big of an inconvenience to us. What topped our disappointing visit was that we gave our waiter our gift card and enough cash to cover the rest of the bill that we owed. He took about 10 minutes to run our gift card and process our payment, so we thought he was doing. He handed us the bill back along with the gift card and cash and thanked us for coming. Not sure if he got us confused with another table, or didn't even run the card. This server should be thankful that my fiance and I are honest people. I could easily see someone taking the cash and gift card back and just walking out.

Pickings are pretty slim in this part of the North County, so luckily there's TGIF. Food is usually better than I'd expect, and so are the drinks. The best draw for this location is its hours.  There really isn't anything else around that's open to 2 am. I find waiting staff to be too young and inexperienced, but not too badly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=220
Sarah S.,"San Marcos, CA",1,6,,1.0,11/27/2011,"Terrible!  We are a family of five whom all ordered at the same time.  Three entrees show up about 20 minutes after we ordered and all included steaks, two were perfect the other however ended up back in the kitchen.  The other two entrees came 30 minutes after the other entrees were served.  One entree was a steak and the other a kid's chicken tenders.  Yes, my two year old was served his chicken tenders last.  A huge no no when a family is out for a decent meal or at least that was the intention.  The last steak entree was cooked to perfection but the vegetables weren't cooked or seasoned.  I was so ticked off at this point, I just wanted to leave.  I ate my steak and mashed potatoes however left the veggies.  My two year old ate his dinner and the steak that was sent back to the kitchen returned only to still be messed up.  Dessert was served to two at the table while the rest finished up what they had left of their dinner.  The bill was around $110...I will NEVER return to TGI Friday's.  There are much better establishments that are well worth the money.  This definitely is not one of them!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=220
Tim W.,"Buena Park, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/26/2013,"After spending the day at Legoland, we wanted find a nearby and family friendly place to eat.  A friend suggested T.G.I. Fridays, since they already had McDonald's for breakfast and In N Out for lunch which also are nearby this location.  We were seated quickly since the restaurant was mainly empty.  They did have wide benches that seated our group of 4 adults and 4 children well.  We made our selection of food items and made a few changes to the order.  The waiter was quick to say that he got it when I asked him to review.  When the food came, two of the children's meals had the side dishes swapped and a salad was not delivered.  Half the beverages came at the beginning and the other half during the middle of the meal.  The number of cutlery sets was short, but was finally brought after the food was half finished.  The food was pretty standard.  However, I feel the service was lacking.  Any service adjustment had to be prodded out of the waiter.  The missing salad was brought out and not charged, but they charged for fixing the side dishes.  I ask to them to reverse the charge which they did.  The gratuity was included automatically which we paid.  The children had a great time at Legoland and we will go again, but we won't be stopping here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=220
Kelli P.,"Ventura, CA",38,43,12,3.0,2/15/2010,my bf and my mom and I went here for dinner for valentines. It was great! my bf got the flat iron steak and they cooked it med  the way he asked. I got the top serlin steak and asked for them to cook it med as well but they cooked it well almost to much it was kinda rubbery... you'd think they'd pay attention to one of the things that is the most pricey on the menu. so for that thats why i gave them 3 stars... . . I have been going to this location for years now and this was the first time this has happend. so maybe they just had a new cook on board.. but for valentines day i would expect more.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=220
Brandon K.,"Encinitas, CA",1,27,,1.0,8/7/2009,"Ever week I am bombarded with clever TGI Friday's coupons where I think I'm getting the greatest deal in the world. Ex. Free Appetizer, 1cent entree, bring a friend and save deal. But thats it, they will do anything to get you in.  From the last two visits I would have to say its not worth the 5-8 Dollars you spent on the 15-20 overmarked dish or over 8 dollar small drink they serve. The atmosphere is also filled with other cheapskates like yourself that doesn't add to the sense of value you think you are getting. The waiter was ofcourse rushed and over worked but I thought it was really lousy when he knew we were trying to leave and pay that he just sat with the cute hostess probably trying to get first dibbs at her phone number.  T-try G-going I- Italian instead, there are better coupons for what you will spend at a fancy restaurant than this. Unless you really are a cheapskate and want them to sing you a birthday song.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=220
Alejandra L.,"Oceanside, CA",0,5,,5.0,3/18/2012,"I Totally Recommend this restaurant. the food was good, the service was excellent and everyone there is really friendly and fast. I will defitnetly go back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=220
Carlos Q.,"Oceanside, CA",250,87,6,1.0,7/11/2011,"Initially I gave this place more stars but after the weekend I will NEVER come here again. In recent visits I have had good service and enjoyed myself.  I came here after eating at a neighboring restaraunt. We saw the rear patio opened and helped ourselves to some seats. After speaking to a party outside about the waiter/waitress we came to the conclusion that nobody was serving outside. We proceeded to ask a hostesses to get service she treated us HOSTILE. She questioned where we came from and why we entered through the rear. We were caught off guard because regaurdless we thought they would apreciate our business. Instead we brushed it off and headed to the bar to get some drinks. We sat down and the bar tender asked us what to drink and before we could finish our first round he cut off us off to head to the back. He came back two minutes later to let us know that he would not be serving us!!! WTF!!! How can you make that determination in less than five minutes. We did not argue, and left immediately. I dont want to call it racial profiling but it did feel that way. I did call the management the next day to get explanationi but have yet to receive an explanation for this behavior. So In short I hope this place closes down and i will never go here again nor speak of it. The END",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=220

Kyle J.,"Vista, CA",168,48,6,1.0,10/6/2009,"This place sucks.  The only thing that was good here was the beer...and that is very hard to mess up.  The service was horrible.  The waitress brought our appetizer out after 20 min and didnt even bring silverware or plates, we had to walk to the bar and get our own plates!  I would give this place 0 stars if possible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=220
Marco B.,"Eastvale, CA",94,20,7,2.0,9/30/2009,I went with my a group of 15. It took 20 minutes for them to seat us and another 20 to take our drink orders. Our waitress was a real itch!! Service was very poor but the food was good. Background music was playing too loud we had to yell when we were talking. Very sad experience I won't be coming back to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=220
Alissa K.,"Carlsbad, CA",18,119,15,1.0,8/16/2009,"With so many good restaurants in the area I usually avoid this one. Occasionally I get suckered into visiting this location, and always do not enjoy it. My last trip was the worst. The food is always sub-par and everything is pre-made (including the drinks, which are too sugary). A guest in my group asked for a quesadilla without sausage, and she was told they couldn't remove the sausage because the item came pre-made. Another person in my group ordered a drink that is promoted at another T.G.I.F's and no one in the bar could figure out how to make it, nor did they even attempt. Our waiter was really erratic and had to come back several times to confirm our orders. By the time the music started blaring at a deafening level, we could not wait to get out of there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=220
Jackson W.,"Arcadia, CA",1,11,,3.0,3/13/2009,Buy one get one free coupon. Might as well eat there. The Jack Daniels sauce is great. The ribs are better than you would expect.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=220
Tiana H.,"Austin, TX",1021,568,255,4.0,7/15/2007,"Even after bad experiences at other TGI Friday locations, a few things on the menu, draw me back time after time. For example: The Tostada Nachos (Appetizers) and The Jack Daniels Burger (make sure you pour on that yummy Jack Daniel's Sauce). YUM!! Order either of these two and I guarantee you will not be disappointed.  The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because I ordered my burger with no onions and I still found 2 onions on the burger. Also I ordered my nachos with the jalapenos on the side but instead the didn't bring them at all. -1 star. The food was delicious though, and A+ service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-carlsbad-3?start=220
Ry N.,"Saint Louis, MO",12,258,75,4.0,12/12/2007,"I went here quite a few times and never really had a bad experience. I never had to wait to be seated, and the food was usually on point and prompt.
