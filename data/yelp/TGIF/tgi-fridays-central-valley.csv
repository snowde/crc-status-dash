Taneesha H.,"San Gabriel, CA",15,77,18,5.0,11/21/2017,"The service was great, the food was good just like i remember. Not sure why the bad reviews. The food tasted like it always has. The prices were not too expensive. The wine was a heavy pour and tasted good.  Jack Daniel sauce was amazing. Love that sauce on anything. I make it at home. But never can I get it to taste like Friday's. I would come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley
Lisa P.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",65,9,,1.0,9/21/2017,"Hello. I would like to formally complain about the terrible dinner we had at this location tonight. We went to celebrate our co-worker who is going to get married and this was ruined by a family that should have been kicked out. Today we ate dinner at TGIF and was APPALLED by the customer that came in and sat at a table near us. First off the customer, started berating the server, who did nothing! The customer proceeded to call our waitress 'fat, told her to get a life' and many other egregious terms. The store manager decided it was more important to appease this rude customer rather than telling them to leave. Around 6:30 PM, the customer started screaming at the server calling her a 'c*nt, a bitch' and so all of us (5 people) decided that if the manager wasn't going to make them leave, then we would leave. We did not finish our last round of drinks or the food we had because at this point we were so upset and no longer wanted to be in this environment. Also, because our server was CRYING, the service was not good. We tipped her well regardless because she was treated so horrible. You can run the cameras and see that the customer was out of control. The tables nearby had children! Ourselves and the other customers told the irate customer that she cannot use that language in front of all these people. It is a shame that the NICE customers, had to leave because it was so uncomfortable. What was supposed to be a fun evening out, turned into a terrible, anxiety ridden dinner. I hope that none of your servers are ever treated like this again. We hope that none of your customers have to PAY to eat dinner in such a hostile environment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley
Matt M.,"Oceanside, CA",1,5,,1.0,1/9/2018,Restaurant had a strange smell upon walking in. As we're waiting to be seated a staff member rushed past us from outside wreaking of cigarette smoke that even the manager noticed. We were seated and waited for our server and guess who was our server? Still wreaking of cigarettes and now breathing it onto all of us solidified our decision to leave without eating there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley
Alyssa C.,"Oceanside, CA",47,21,2,1.0,1/9/2018,"Ended up not even eating here. Inside was filthy and the waiter reeked of cigarettes. The smell made us sick, our party of 6 chose to leave.

Suzanne V.,"Monroe, NY",0,17,2,1.0,9/9/2017,"Seriously?  Your waitress last night called my daughter a bi*ch as she threw their receipt on the table??  My daughters reaction was ""excuse me?"" as she was shocked and had never been spoken to like that by someone and your server responded with ""yeah you hear me right and then told her and her friends that no one wants to wait on high schoolers tables regardless of the fact that they tip them well"".  Good information to know Friday's, that you are discriminating against a multi racial group of seniors who aren't out partying, aren't out doing drugs but are simply gathering for a meal on a Friday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley

Arianna C.,"Waldorf, MD",30,25,36,1.0,11/6/2017,"last night around 10:30pm myself and a few coworkers decided to stop by TGI Fridays for a quick bite to eat however, we came to notice that when we walked in we were greeted by a bartender who attempted to give us menu's followed by we don't have any food. When we asked why not the bartender stated that they sent the entire kitchen staff home already two hours early, so 30 minutes prior to us arriving and it was not even last call yet. Now imagine my surprise as a former TGI Fridays Employee and current TGI Fridays regular how frustrating that is when you have a group of hungry individuals coming to a restaurant expecting to spend money and eat greeted by ""we sent the kitchen home at around 10"" which is two hours early. This is not standard Friday's Procedure, it never has been. Especially on a Sunday when you are the only restaurant people depend on because you are still open. I would definitely like to speak to management about this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley
James D.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",0,1,,1.0,5/28/2017,"STAY AWAY STAY AWAY , One of the worst experience ever. My fiancee and I went here for a quick lunch and upon walking inside the host and hostess were having a full blown conversation. We were ignored until they finished their personal conversation and then seated. We sat there for a few and our waitress appeared. She had NO personality and seemed a little angry or pissed off. Never introduced herself or smiled. Just lacked enthusiasm and any sort of personality. We took two waters and when she came back my fiancee asked her what flavors they had for the wings and her response is ""it's on the next page"".....she couldn't even tell us the flavors?? Ok so we give her the appetizer order and when she returned I gave her my main order which she wrote down and walked away not even acknowledging or confirming the order back. I asked for medium and I get well done burger. The oil was all over the plate that we couldn't even pick it up to eat and had to leave the bottom bun on plate! Our non friendly waitress didn't even check on us the only thing she did was walk by snatched the cup to refill water. Once we got our check we gave what we thought was the right tip for crappy service, crappy food and lack of personality. If I was up to me I would've left nothing but a note to tell her why she was getting nothing. So as we were walking out hear comes this waitress all angry chasing after us slapping the stack of money against the check. ""Nice, very nice guys..., next time you come back ask for me"" she said angrily  so my fiancee responds back ""yeah we will  because you were very friendly right.."" hahahahaha it made my day! Liste. don't go after your customers if you rightfully get a crappy tip. Start by asking yourself what did you do wrong...if you don't know you shouldn't be in this business. I would recommend people to STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley
Frank G.,"Carmel, NY",0,28,,1.0,2/3/2017,"As TGI locations go this one is a tiny bit above average.  Pros:  you can find a bar spot on a Friday after 8pm usually because it's a very large bar.  The food is almost always warm and fresh.  The selection of craft beers is large.  Cons:  some bar tenders can be rude, slow, and may not get your order right.  The steaks are tough. Cost is higher then other chains nearby. Update: Well we tried the non bar service and it was abysmal.  Waitress mostly ignored us and they were not very busy.  If the bar is busy pick another place.  Good was ok though.  Nothing to write home about. Update: Food is still above average however today's visit made me remove a star.  Waited 10 minutes for service and the bar tender was a little rude, acting like she was doing us a favor by asking us what we wanted.  Very slow service with a near empty bar.  Not a good thing and we will take some time off from this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley

After the waitress finally came to our table, we ordered only a single appetizer which the kitchen messed up. In turn, we had to wait an additional 10 minutes for them to remake it leaving us with barely any time to enjoy our lunch break. We asked to speak with the manager.

We have an hour for lunch.  25 minutes before the nachos hit the table.  I tell our waitress, Tatiana, that we're only on a lunch break and have to get back so, please bring out the food as soon as it's ready. Two people sit down at the table next to us 30 minutes after we arrive.  Waiting, waiting, waiting... our empty plate of nachos has been sitting there for ten minutes. Tatiana comes back and I tell her that we're out of time and to please pack up what we ordered and bring us the check. She then proceeds to bring out the food that took ten minutes to make, to the table next to us.  We STILL haven't seen our lunch. That was just beyond bullshit. Ten minutes for our neighbors but, couldn't get our burgers out in 45 minutes. She never packed up my salad and my two friends and I left pretty pissed off. We scarfed it down back at work and all had stomach aches and such from it, for the rest of the day. A bill of $56 for a whole lot of nothing and getting sick. Stellar. Never again will we go there for lunch.

I can't tell you his name because I don't know it. He came over 7 mins after we arrived and took our drink order. We almost got up and left after 5 mins sitting ungreeted. He messed up our appetizer so we waited longer. He brought our meals with no napkins, no ketchup for fries and acted like we were nothing him for asking for them. I would like to flip the table and leave but my boyfriend is eating. I left a complaint online and someone from corporate called me back, told me the manager of the location would get in touch. That was almost 20 days ago. She finally got in touch, left me a VM and I called her back within less than a minute. Didn't hear my phone ring. Was on hold for over 5 and was asked by the hostess to call back in a half hour. NO. You make time for things that are important. Absolutely not.

The staff seemed unmotivated and could not be bothered. This restaurant is suffering and should have the kitchen inspected for Health reasons. When the front and the back of a restaurant has all the signs of neglect you can imagine what the kitchen is like. We stopped ordering after the appetizers where served .

Originally I wanted to search for good restaurants around Woodbury, however the wifi in my hotel wasn't working. Seeing how this is the only plaza I know aside from the outlet mall itself, I decided to give it a shot. In terms of expectations, they weren't set very high. However, the first thing I noticed was the free wifi sticker. Yay, wifi! Can't argue with that. As for everything inside...meh. Our server was okay, but he seemed rather uninterested in us after he realized we were only here for a small dinner meal (our family of 4 only ordered three items).  We had the cajun shrimp and chicken pasta, the pick three-for-all, and the chicken flatbread. The flatbread and the pick 3 (boneless + fried mozzarella, potato skins) were both quite good, however the pasta was a bit on the disappointing side as the ""cajun"" was really the chef spamming black peppers on the food.

During the wait I noted spitballs still on the ceiling tiles from the night that should have ejected several Monroe Woodbury high school jocks who were loud, joking, blowing spitballs on the ceiling months ago (see my rating from that date) there is still graffiti carved into the wooden walls beside a few booths , worn paint etc. basically this location is showing signs that no one cares.  It seems the server talent all left to work at other venues ( saw several at a new diner 4 miles away ). Well after the 13 minute wait we left, still had no contact with anyone but the host who greeted us.  I did spy a bartender bringing food to another table but he didn't acknowledge us either.  We drove 10 miles  to the friendly's restaurant in goshen and had a nice family meal. Service at friendly's was much much better that at this Friday's ! My recommendation is to avoid this Friday's until they close it and offer a better venue , perhaps a street vendor selling three day old soft pretzels heated over charcoal in a shopping cart.  Stay far away, corporate doesn't care either !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley?start=20

We were kind of far from home so we had to google search a nearby TGI to eat at. Google lead us to this restaurant which was less than 5 minutes from the Outlets. When we got there, there was no host in sight. So we looked around and waited about 5 minutes for her to finally appear which is the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. Our waitress was so jolly, happy and smiling, you could tell she loves her job (or at least acts like it), which made me feel at ease. We both ordered pot stickers as an appetizer (it was so delicious!) and as an entrée we both got steak with fried shrimp and a half rack of BBQ ribs and broccoli. My friend asked for her steak to be well done and I asked for mine to be medium well. We both got what we asked for. I don't know if I was just a little bit too hungry but that was the best darn steak I ever had in my life lol. It was cooked perfectly and flowed with juices...very succulent. The ribs were pretty good too and so were the shrimp. I got the mango peach slush as a drink and it was free refills. The waitress let me take a full cup home with me. She was an amazing waitress, you don't find a lot of that these days. She let us eat our food in peace and didn't bother us too much with checking up on us which was nice. She came by our table probably every 15-20 minutes to see if we were ok. The AC was cranked up a little too high though but I had a jacket on. My friend was freezing even though she had a sweater on. Other than that it was a good experience. I went home very happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley?start=40
Liz T.,"Irving, TX",99,282,217,4.0,10/14/2011,"Ok, I usually don't eat chain food, and, if I have to, I go Chilies. My impression of TGI Fridays is that they are terribad.  My sis and I were up in Highland Falls the night before my wedding. They place is pretty dead, especially after 8, and it was 9 at night and we hadn't had dinner and were starving. We asked the hotel to find the nearest chain place, since they would be the only ones open, and this is what she came up with.  I have to say, I was very impressed for a chain. Service was great, drinks were good, and the ""value meals"" -- we did the app and entree for $10--were very flavorful, and not too oily (which is my complaint with most chains). I deduct one star for being crazy salty--but then all of these chains are.  Best experience I have had in a chain in years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley?start=40
Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2432,1659,195,3.0,1/10/2012,"A pretty standard TGI Friday's in the middle of a large shopping plaza not too far from Newburgh. Not the most time-efficient pitstop on a Saturday night, but it beat the 45-minute wait at Outback and Chili's.  The service was very friendly, though good intentions exceeded execution. The walls were decorated with a mix of nonsensical curios that are well familiar at this chain and its brethren. The food was pretty decent--chicken skewers with teriyaki sauce and a Kansas City BBQ burger. I washed it down with a Saranac ale, which was a nice local addition. And you can't argue with the value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley?start=40
Lee S.,"Nanuet, NY",1,47,1,1.0,10/18/2015,2.5 hour wait!  This is not a Times Square location! I didn't bother and neither should anyone else. That is clearly a sign of being understaffed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley?start=40
Mike K.,"Asbury Park, NJ",3,1,,1.0,1/1/2014,"To those who must be gluten free, be aware that there are little GF choices. The management is flexible and will help out as much as they can, however, many of the items are pre made and cannot be altered. For example, you cannot order some chicken dishes without the sauce.  Besides that, fun place to stop with friends for a few drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley?start=40
Angie H.,"Chandler, AZ",6,12,,1.0,10/12/2014,"Terrible service.  We waited 15 minutes for drinks.  It took forever to get refills.  Our food was mediocre.  Our kids ordered the pudding cups and it took over 30 minutes.  No apologies, only excuses.  He said they had to make the desserts from scratch?!  Hello, it's pudding in a cup with crushed Oreos on top.  Lame.  Trust the other bad reviews.  Skip this place and go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley?start=40

Mark F.,"Santa Barbara, CA",819,882,3995,2.0,7/13/2010,"Everything's the same at Friday's. I find myself at TGI's when I'm on the road and staying on small towns on the East Coast. There always seems to be one welcoming me into a bar filled with a mix of people pumped with loud music and a blaze with flat screens. I give in after a long day knowing the I'll be taken care of. I lied, two things that seem to constantly change are the shirts of flair the kids behind the bar wear and the layout of the menu. Not necessarily the food in the menu, just the order and styling. In Central Valley, most lunch patrons are here for the Woodbury Common Outlet Mall and it seems late night are locals looking for a good time. There's not much around other than a Chili's and UNO. This bar is a party scene.   ""Well what about the food?"" you might ask. Please refer to the fist line in the review. The service is the same. Nothing great but nothing poor. Same ol same ol. And for that, Friday's gets the deuce. Will I be back? Sure. The next time my choice is between fast food drive through, a Green Burrito Bomb from AM PM or the pleasing red & white of TGI Friday's. I'll look forward to your new uniforms.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-central-valley?start=40
Kevin S.,"Hopewell Junction, NY",7,23,3,3.0,8/11/2014,Average experience overall. Bar service was very slow. Waitress had to be asked several times to clear empty glasses and plates from our table.

Not to mention $7 for a beer???? WHAT??!! are you insane? I nearly fainted! No wonder they don't put their prices of beer on the menu, no one would order it!
