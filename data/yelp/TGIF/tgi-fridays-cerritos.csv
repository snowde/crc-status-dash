Krishna C.,"Fullerton, CA",1,512,3270,4.0,12/10/2017,"This TGI Fridays is nostalgia for me. When we lived in Cerritos, this was a regular dining spot on the weekend for us. I have had at least couple of dozen LA Water's cocktail here. That remains to date one of the strongest drinks I have had at any restaurants.  This restaurant is very spacious. It has seating inside as well as outside. There are a lot of things to do at the Cerritos Towne Center. Walmart, Ross and several dining options. TGI is the best place to grab tasty food at this shopping plaza after some shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos
Rai J.,"Tustin, CA",0,56,9,2.0,10/30/2017,"How long is this place going to stay at this location, taking up good space? I was disappointed with my food.  They charge almost $20 for a tiny salmon (go to BJ's instead for their Atlantic Salmon) and their Cajun Pasta was pretty BLAND (also nearly $20) with no flavor, swimming in sauce, tiny pieces of shrimp and chicken, no vegetables in it at all. I doubt I'll be going to another TGI Friday's again and wouldn't be surprised if the company goes out of business soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos
Caroline P.,"Norwalk, CA",146,536,2733,5.0,9/19/2017,"I greatly enjoyed my most recent visit at TGI's. I haven't visited since they renovated everything and I definitely like to new look. The moment I walked in, I noticed how bright and welcoming the place was. Not some dumpy old school restaurant. kudos on design! I was surprised to see that on a Saturday night around 730pm, there was no wait and no long line (9/16/17). We ""called ahead"" since they do not take reservations and was seated promptly after our party arrived. Lisa was our server and was very attentive with all our orders, refills and service. If there was any delay in order delivery, she would give us a heads up which was awesome. My brother in law had to leave for a brief period of time (unsure if he would end up joining us for dinner) she she had the manager remove the coke we ordered for him without us asking. When he informed us he would be back and we could order his food and drink, she got the order in for us again. When his burger was ready and sitting at his place at the table, she came back 5 mins after to offer to place it under a heat lamp to prevent the burger from getting cold. This is what I call great service. Thinking of step ahead and always on top of things. Before we left, she even offered to have our leftover drinks placed in a to go cup if we chose to.  Thank you again Lisa for a great night!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos
Kenny G.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",299,1010,964,2.0,6/9/2017,"Amber: ""Like, was I the ONLY one listening? I thought it reeked""? Cher: ""I believe that's your designer imposter perfume."" Amber: ""Whuuuteverrr!!!"" ______________________  Two decades after its release this 90's coming of age saga featuring Alicia Silverstone and Stacey Dash proves to be all the more relevant. Not in terms of my personal life.  Ohhh no, hunny. I'm far too old for high school drama, but as it appears, chain restaurants rarely ever outgrow the stigmatisms that are affordability............. by way of mediocrity. In advance know that yes, I drove from frikkin' DTLA to Cerritos in anticipation of an above par experience here. Consider this review an epilogue of ""buyer's remorse"". Bypassing the Fridays location in Ladera simply because it's out of the way and/or the additionally nearby location in Compton........ FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, I resorted to Yelp whilst observing 1.5 stars to be the rough average for NINE of the franchise's locations, within their entirety. I thought they declared peace in the Middle East. No bueno. Pulled up and while the area this eatery rest within is lovely, upon walking in was I stricken with an epiphany towards why it's been eons since my last visit here. - We were NOT GREETED. - The sticky, debris filled floors were an absolute abomination and Heaven help us..... - The food at this place is something out of a damned concentration camp.  With Anne Frank nowhere in sight I thought perhaps by concentrating things would take a turn for the better. Ahhh,...... no such luck as when the food and beverages arrived (2 orders of buffalo wings, an order of fries, a slider, artichoke dip and a shrimp cocktail......I felt like quite the heifer), to be ""frank"", NOTHING WAS WORTH THE BRAIN STORM! The wings were rubbery.  Think,.... that yellow chicken that Johnny Carson used to keep behind his desk for gag relief.  Was this a joke??? Did I stumble into some bad lighting??? No seriously. EVERYTHING we were served was either lukewarm or seemed to be someone else's reheated leftovers​. The artichoke dip was more evocative of hummus and the chips were stale. To further it, you know THE STRUGGLE IS REAL when the shrimp cocktail is the WARMEST portion of your entire damned meal!!!! With this derived a discussion. AS IT APPEARS, SERVING LUKEWARM, LACKLUSTER PROVENDER IS THE COMMON DENOMINATOR BETWEEN ALL OF THE TGI FRIDAY'S LOCATIONS I'VE EVER VISITED! From Ladera throughout Rancho Cucamonga and San Bernardino, it's as if employees are trained to stand idly while text messaging and scratching their asses to allow one's food time enough to chill and congeal, prior to popping out of hibernation just in time enough to present it to guests prior to their having collapsed from undeniably preventable starvation. Note: THE ONLY REASON WHY this joint is receiving 2 stars as opposed to the bare minimum is because I believe in reviewing fairly and our server, Donnie, proved to be the ""Baldwin"" of this booze brothel as he scurried to and fro throughout our session of dining, in a semi-bionic manner while serving EVERY table within the bar portion of the ENTIRE establishment. * Simply put, THIS GUY DESERVES A DAMNED RAISE! Upon receiving it, I'd recommend he quit. Donnie take my advice, accept the pay increase, leave and do something good for humanity! At the end of the day, $12 endless apps and/or late night ""Happy Hour"" or not, it all just as easily boils down to one inevitable conclusion: ___________________________ Cher:  ""TGI Friday's is a full-on Monet."" Tai:  ""What's a monet?"" Cher: ""It's like a painting, see? From far away, it's OK, but up close, it's a BIG OLE' MESS!"" ____________________________ Verdict: [---- I will never....... repeat NEVERRRR patronize another gaht' damned, God forsaken TGI Friday's as long as the fart stenched Southern California air continues to pollute my already 2nd hand nicotine exposed lungs!----] Why you ask? . . . Well isn't it obvious?  TGI FRIDAY'S IS TOTALLY CLUELESS!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos

Matt C.,"Bellflower, CA",308,229,324,4.0,5/16/2017,"We come to this Friday's sometimes and go to the one in Long Beach Towne Center as well. My Reviews for Friday's are...good. The food, service, and cleanliness are typically good. Not great but good, across the board. Friday's is our new ""Go-To"" Place for Happy Hour. Check it out, cheaper food and $6 for a NINE ounce glass of wine. And not from a short list, but any wine on the list is 6 bucks a glass for nine ounces. That is the bomb!! So first we went to the one in Long Beach Towne Center and they were out of my wife's favorite wine (Second time) and because it was Mother's Day we decided to go to Cerritos. How Serendipitous!! Jasmine was our waiter. We had the Fried Mozzarella Appetizer to start. This was a REALLY good example on how to do fried cheese right. It was hot, fresh and crispy. The cheese was melty and gooey and tasty.The marinara had a nice flavor as well. Next we had the Nachos. They were good. I would order them again. There was plenty of cheese and toppings. We asked for extra jalapeños and they were pretty generous with those. So Nachos were good too. But today was different. Jasmine we our waiter! Jasmine was the best waiter we have ever had in a Friday's - and many other places for that matter. She was friendly, genuine, caring and prompt. She looked at you in the eyes and smiled and paid attention. She checked back regularly and had conversation with us - unlike some of the ""Service Robots."" The service on this day was AWESOME. I even spoke to the Manager on Duty to compliment Jasmine. Having been a restaurant manager in one of my previous lives I know most of the time you get called to a table it is not for pleasant news. This time was different. Thank you, Jasmine, for a GREAT Friday's Experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos

As empty as it was when we arrived, it should NOT have taken that long to receive our food. Then we finally get our appetizer and entree and it's cold. :-/  You can imagine our disappointment.

Puja K.,"Stanton, CA",0,6,1,1.0,12/31/2017,Not one to write bad about any business but guys the food was just not good at all especially for the price. The food looked unappetizing and the taste was equally bland. Service was as just okay.  Just checked out the reviews which I should have done before going in. I noticed most of the one star reviews being moved to not recommended reviews. Will be on lookout for mine though.  A huge mistake coming here.

There were no utensils on the table and I didn't notice til I got my food, I had to wait 10-15 mins for the waitress to come out of the back area to ask her for some.

He made sure everything was right with our large order,  for a party of 2 people. He found out I was from New Orleans and mentioned New Orleans East(where I was born and raised) so I'll never forget that.

Nachos shouldn't be nachos if cheese is limited.  Cheese is limited here. Beer selection is good enough for local franchise, but the food could use some help. Nachos were soooooooooooooooo salty.

Steak was actually better than expected. Lobster came without any offer of butter.  My wife had a small cup of tomato soup. It was half full. The bill came and it was $6.50!!!!

Tori K.,"Ontario, CA",0,31,11,2.0,12/23/2017,"Our family of 3 will never return to this location. This was our first & last visit here. Last night we had a family date night with my husband & daughter, starting off with dinner at this location. It took 10 minutes before the waitress took our drink order, another 17 minutes for her to return to take our food order. So 27 minutes of sitting at the table BEFORE ordering! I can't tell u her name because none of them were wearing a name tag. She was nice, but very slow with everything & disheveled in every task. She would forget something, then take forever to bring it because she was so disoriented with her job. There would be long periods where we couldn't find her, this was especially annoying when we just wanted to pay our check & get the hell outta there. We tried using the tablet device on the table, but the pay feature didn't work. When she finally came to give us the check, we WISH we had perfect change, but nope we again had to wait & wait. We noticed another table behind us that was SO PISSED OFF, 3 of their people got up & went to sit in the car while the other two waited to dispute something. Let me note that it was not super busy at all, there were only 4 tables occupied on the side of the restaurant we were seated in. The only saving grace for this place was my food was great, my husband & daughters was ok.

Deseree F.,"Cypress, CA",0,3,,1.0,9/10/2017,"This was my first time at this location, and unfortunately my last.  We came in for dinner & drinks before our movie on Friday & it was a HUGE mistake.  Thank god I only ordered fries, but my cousin & his girlfriend both ordered steak with lobster/salmon. The steak was 100% ROTTEN. Reason why we know, it smelled as if the meat had been sitting out in the heat for hours. The seafood had obviously been sitting out far too long along with their veggies due to their cold, dry, shriveled up appearance. I've worked in the food industry for almost 8 years as a server/bartender, and I have NEVER smelled food that was served to a customer like that. We notified the manager and our server after they finally appeared. The moment they both smelled the steaks they disappeared into the kitchen with the food for what seemed like an eternity. We had to ask ANOTHER server to please get them to comp those plates so we can make it to our movie, and even then they made us wait. We were halfway out of the door completely over it when the server chased us down with our bills. Of course all of our drinks that we never received were still on the bill. So we waited, again. Meanwhile my family is in the parking lot immediately starting to feel sick. The manager was very apologetic but honestly these things should never happen if your managing correctly. Did any of the cooking staff go through the food handlers education? I really hope the rest of the management sees this review and goes through their meat and poultry thoroughly prior to allowing it to be served to customers. Thank God my cousin and his girlfriend knew right away that something was wrong with that food. Sadly they both got sick right before our movie on our way in and didn't even have a chance to get dinner that night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=20

Keep in mind that there were CHILDREN in the restaurant. And literally no one said anything, no one thought to change the channel, nothing.  We kindly asked our waiter to change the channel after about 20 minutes and they did it right away.

We ordered a few appetizers, a basket of fries, and speciality drinks. The happy hour is awesome: half off appetizers, and drinks are cheap.  The outdoor patio is also considered the ""bar"" area during happy hour so it was awesome. When it started to get a little cooler, someone came out and turned on all the heat lamps and it felt amazing.  The only things I didn't really like were the nachos appetizer and the ranch that we asked for with our basket of fries. The quality of everything tasted so cheap and generic... Just so bland! But why am I surprised considering it is a generic chain restaurant? I've had much better nachos at other places. & the ranch tasted almost like mayo. It tasted like the cheapest store brand of ranch anyone could buy. I was not impressed. All in all, another classic example of why I try to stay away from chain restaurants, particularly because of the generic food produced.

Ben L.,"Long Beach, CA",855,313,3470,4.0,12/17/2015,"I don't think I've set foot in a TGI Friday's for years. They got my attention though with $12 endless appetizers. We started with the boneless wings, buffalo flavor. They were out of traditional bone-in wings - bummer. There's an indescribable, natural flavor to bone-in wings that boneless chicken just doesn't possess. The boneless wings were good, but not as good as bone-in. All in all we had the wings, potato skins, mozzarella sticks, spinach dip, and pot stickers. The best items were the spinach dip and mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks were crispy and cheesy, and the accompanying marinara sauce was good. The spinach dip was surprisingly delicious. It was fresh, hearty, and had a nice salty flavor. The chips were crunchy and provided a nice textural contrast to the soft dip. For $12 unlimited refills, this was a pretty good deal. Our server Mike was very friendly and constantly ready to refill our next app request. The only downside was that the strawberry lemonade was mostly ice and they charged 49 cents per refill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=20

Eric A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,9,2,1.0,12/11/2016,"Just last night I thought i would have a great dinner.  My food was great !  JD CHICKEN w/ that excellent glaze YUMM MY GIRLFRIEND ON THE OTHER HAND, gets the shrim pasta w/ a side of sautéed mushrooms.  Now, when the order came my girlfriend noticed upon mixing the mushrooms with the pasta ( an odd texture to the mushrooms ) I was like no way ask for them to change them.  Are waiter, kind young lady did so rite away.  She was not the problem, I still left her a tip.  Anywho, we thought the problem was resolved, the waiter said she specifically told the cook that the other mushrooms were dry. We got the same out come,  Same dry stale, not even hot, no steam coming from the """" fresh plate """" As I told my girlfriend , being a great cook that I am, i know that was from the same batch that the cook has on the side that's been lying in the kitchen if not for 1-3 hours to make him life easier when those small orders come in.  THATS A GREAT QUALITY RITE ??????  Wow discussed me.  Being the friendly person my girlfriend is she didn't want to start a scene.  So i of course got a bit angered by that but I knew she would then get mad at me if I started a scene. So i then said to myself, we could've fixed it verbally with the manager with no problem not wanting nothing in exchange. Instead here goes this yelp review.  get some better quality cooks, God even Mexican independent joints have better quality.  For the price of the food at TGI , nobody should even have to complain about stuff like that.  Moral of the story.  - Sautéed mushrooms were stale like grilled chicken being left out for a day , texture is like a piece of thin flexible wood.  - Asked for a new batch ( SAME SH*T ) - means cook had those laying around for hours.  ( stale, crushable , no grease signs, no steam from heat )",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=40

Ordered up a Pineapple Mojito, had a few sips didn't like it.  Tried to give it another go but nope, asked my date to try and was really sweet.  Told our server it was too sweet and no good and would prefer to just order up a Guinness.    He shortly came back to tell us the manager said she wouldn't take the drink off the tab because we drank half, but they already took my drink so I wasn't really left with much of an option. I'd suggest if you can deny taking the drink off the tab, leave it on the table before you make that decision.  And if the manager is the one to make that decision, he or she should be the one to explain it to the patrons and not relay it to the server. The two stars is for the manager on duty or maybe the policy and or process concerning drinks that are subjectively undesirable, not the server by any means.   The food was okay, not anything to crave over, the dozen or so fries was a good portion.  But props to the chicken quesadilla, that was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=40

Jason W.,"Cerritos, CA",401,39,73,1.0,1/28/2017,"If I could give a 0, I would. Well, a one is deserving, because for the most part, the staff was nice, although they did forget a number of our orders and we ended up having to ask for them multiple times. This place used to be one of favorites to go to, but today simply upset me. They seemed to re-brand recently, which pretty much means, higher prices. For the same meal, you're paying a lot more and the quality of the food isn't even good across the board. Part of this re-branding came with a new menu (looks great) and the like. As I looked through the photos, I saw a picture of some fries that looked seasoned. It got my tasted buds going and so I ordered them (SEASONED fries). When the fries came out, there was nothing on them and twice, I was assured that was the SEASONED fries. Supposedly, the seasoning is plain salt (or possibly sea salt), but no special seasoning of any sort and nothing like what was on the menu. Sure a picture in a menu doesn't show you what your actual meal is going to look like, but clearly, this was misleading. I was upset the rest of the evening. Our appetizers came out after some of the meal, they forgot drinks, the table was sticky and the clam chowder was not good at all. For the price, I could have gone to a much fancier restaurant. Sadly, this is where we ended up. It's hard for me to write this, because the servers were nice, but ultimately, it is corporate that needs to look at this. I'll choose the fancy place down the street. When about to get the bill, my brother asked to use one of his rewards. It was such a hassle compared to the previous times that he used his rewards and the server even asked him to write down the information and left (I don't think this was an issue, but he didn't ask if it was okay, it was just like ... here, do this). At the end of the night, they gave us the wrong bill and eventually had to track down the new one.  Am I bickering? Maybe a bit, but it does take a lot to get a bad review from me and this was one of those moments. Unless you're looking for regular fries, don't be mislead by the SEASONED fries and don't let the re-branding fool you, you're paying more for the same food, which isn't so great anyway. There needs to be more than a new menu and new (higher) prices when you re-brand and this one definitely fell very, very short.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=40

The chicken wings were plain Bland, no Ranch, no blue cheese nothing came with it.

We asked how much longer it would be but were consistently told ambiguously answers i.e. ""There are two large parties ahead of you... Just 10-15 more minutes."" We weren't allowed to sit at the tables near the bar either because we had a couple underage folks with us. Long story short, we had to wait another hour; total of 2 hours. I understand it gets busy or if they're understaffed, but they should have been honest or given us a better wait-time estimate. Don't lie just to keep our business cause then you get pissed off customers.

Erik J.,"Lakewood, CA",265,32,15,1.0,10/26/2016,"Well, I guess there is always room for a new low. The manager, John, needs to rethink what he does for a living, outside of the service industry, and being support for his staff, as he isn't good at either. It seems there was a bit of a glitch in the monitor in the kitchen, or some such thing, that prevented them from seeing the complete order. That is a bummer, but it happens. John, the manager delivered the food to our table of 5, in a virtually empty restaurant (Assuming 15-20% capacity) When he brought out the food for the other 4 at the table, I mentioned to him that there was a plate missing. Ten minutes, or so go by before anyone came back by, and still no missing plate. John, the excellent manager that he is, never came back by to say a single word about the missing meal, knowing good and well, that there was an issue, first hand. He'd rather have the waiter deal with it. After, no exaggeration, a half hour goes by, I asked the waiter to be sure the manager brings out the missing plate of food whenever it is finally ready. Finally, he shows up with the mediocre plate of chicken and broccoli that took 30 minutes to prepare. I mentioned to him, my disappointment, and asked why he hadn't stopped by sooner to help his waiter with the issue of an unhappy table. He had the gall to say that ""we have the waiters handle their own table and take ownership of them"". I was a little surprised by this, especially with him knowing first hand that there was an issue of a missing plate, and let him know I thought it was his responsibility to handle these types of situations for the wait staff. His response was, ""well, this is how we roll"". SERIOUSLY?! Well, John, good luck with that manager position. I recommend you find something a bit more suited to you, like bar-back, or keeping the trash receptacles empty. Save your money, and get some Subway. They have better management, and service.

I don't really blame the waiter, because he was by himself for the most part and had a few tables! But I think that it is more of the responsibility of manager/restaurant to fix that issue! The rice pilaf also smelled like it was old, it tasted ok, but it didn't smell right, so we did not continue eating it! I got the pilaf with some salmon which was good! It was cooked well done, just how I like it! And the jack Daniels sauce brought a nice sweetness to it! Also, unfortunately I don't think that the waiter could hear my brothers order, so he ended getting mashed potatoes instead of vegetables!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=60

They sat us outside because there was no wait time. The waitress looked annoyed that a party this big came in. You would think she would be excited.

The whole time we ate, she never bussed the empty appetizer plates off our table. Come to think of it....nothing was bussed off our table.

The manager  was no help, and she was very condesending.  She informed us that the hamburger was removed from the bill, but we would need to pay the 20 dollars for 4 potstickers and 4 cold mozarella sticks.  She was very matter of fact and offered free dessert as a consolation prize.  I kindly rejected her offer and paid the bill.  This restaurant has lost a valued customer.  I usually frequent your restaurant at least once a week.   Your managers lack of concern regarding the poor service I received was very disheartening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=100
Carlos F.,"Azusa, CA",80,294,99,1.0,5/19/2015,"So let's start with a disclaimer: this is my first time eating at TGI Friday's, and with a party of 16, I'm sorry to say that it turned ugly much faster than I thought. First shocker was that they DO NOT have bottomless fries. $3.99 for a small plate of fries, you would think they would match the competition with the endless refills. Not the case. Next were drinks. I always start off with a water, no ice. I don't usually make a big fuss about ice being in it, but this not only had a ton of ice, it was disgusting ice to boot. I'm not sure what their ice maker looks like, but I think they should check it, and the water lines that lead to it.  And another big note: when you don't have free refills on a drink like a strawberry lemonade (competition wins again), please don't fill it to the brim with crushed ice before adding the drink, forcing you to pay $0.49 for another drink in a few minutes.  On to the food:  Mozzarella sticks were too salty, and the marinara tasted like a funky jar of Ragu sauce.  The burger that I ordered was to be medium rare (which I figured to come out as true medium), really came in as a slightly charred medium well. It went back to the kitchen. Another order had a BLT that didn't have any guacamole. ALL 5 of the smoke stacked burgers were missing the bacon. Nobody wanted to make any deal of it. I also noticed that they were to have 2 patties, but each patty looked to be about half a normal patty. I personally have a problem when restaurants do that. A steak that was ordered medium was med-well going on well. Chicken something pasta was horribly overcooked and mushy, and just on the other side of over-salted. So, aside from my no-ice mishap, everything with the service was standard.  Are all Friday's this horrible? I don't know, but I don't think I'll ever find out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=100

Denise F.,"Whittier, CA",2,16,8,1.0,2/19/2017,"2/4/17 We went to Cerritos TGIF Fridays on a Saturday early evening. There was a short wait but nothing ridiculous, after a few minutes we sat at a table in the bar area which was first come first serve. Our waiter never introduced himself, He cleared the table brought put menu in the table and walked away saying nothing. I know I shouldn't assume but I just thought to myself he was just the one bussing tables. After about 20 minutes of no awknowledgment we stopped that same man when he went by asked for a kids menu that was not offered and he got it and left, no drinks, no offer of appetizers nothing. 10 minutes later he said are you ready. We ordered our appetizers and decided it best to get the whole order going. Drinks appetizers and dinner. He took the order didn't ask what dipping sauce we wanted didn't give us a chance to ask and brought what he felt we should have. We stopped him asked for blue cheese for our appetizer platter and he brought it and walked away. Not even a anything else I can get you, when he took our order he didnt know the menu, asked us for sides that didnt even cone with what we ordered. still my thought was maybe hes new, overwhelned, or just not personable. Thats ok. Then my boyfriend took a bite of one if the hot wings I got a potato skin that was still on the frozen/refrigerated side. And we both looked at each other mine is really cold I told him he said but at least its not raw. The wing was completely reddish pink and sorry to gross you all out bloody. Every one already had one on their plate kids didn't pay attention being they covered it in blue cheese and had eaten it. We told them not to eat it and called over our waiter and his response was yea its a little bit raw but its ok. I said NO its not ok. I want you to take this platter away and let them know they are serving raw potentially dangerous chicken. He took the platter said nothing else to us and walked away, no offer of something else, no I will take it off your bill, I will have a word with the manager and cook, NOTHING. He proceeded to bring our dinner. We let the older kids order from the adult menu and the waiter set down one of the kids steak and shrimp and I said I'm sorry that shrimp is burnt, again nothing he ignored me, I said it again and his response yeah a littke bit. I said it shouldn't be burnt at all. He did nothing, set down the rest of the plates, one kid ordered ribs again adult menu, there were 4 small ribs on the huge plate they served it on with a sprinkling of frenchbfries and the coleslaw we said we didn't want. My boyfriend and I ordered the fajitas 2 meat combo to share since we tbought we would be eating appetizers as well. There had to be about 5 strips of chicken amnd the equivalent if not less of steak. I was done I stood up ask him if he said anything to anyone about yhe chicken he said yes I think and that was it I said call a manager he which he did she came over I explained the problems we had and stated we didn't eat anything, im5not paying for anything we are done. I asked her how they can charge $17 dollars for a plate of 4 ribs with a few fries and whatever the steak and burnt shrimp costs and be ok with what they put in front of us. She had no answer except to say well you can't leave until you pay for that beer, my boyfriend had almost entirely drank. She didn't ask if we had paid for it already which he did after our 20 minute then 10 minute wait for a drink order. He walked up to the bar ordered and paid. She just assumed we were trying to get it by. We would have pd ith pleasure for a satisfactory service ans meal, neither of which we got. No I'm sorry how can I fix this, let me make this right, NOTHING. So I guess if the person supervising the staff, our waiter is subpar then you need to expect that thenpeople under them would be too. We usually go to the Brea location and will from now on only go to the Brea location. Do they not understand that they not only had poor service, poor judgement, poor food and food presentation but they could have made one or all of use extremely sick? Good Lucknif you eat here, I don't recommend the chicken in anyvway, shape, or form. Order from the kids menu its the same portion apparently but cheaper. And this whole unlimited appetizer hype is crap. You have to get the same appetizer and you can't share it with your table because they will charge you for another order. Think that advertisment needs to be stated a bit more clearly. Also don't advertise on your website for Cerritos in big letters and pictures that its Happy Hour all day everyday, if its not. I showed the server what it stated on my phone on their website and he said no it says that but its not happy hour, I'm sorry I thought I was there on a day considered any day and during the hour of all day. Ridiculous I asked for clarification as to why thats advertised and not honored and got a deer in headlights look with no response.

Jen P.,"Rowland Heights, CA",0,23,5,4.0,9/4/2016,The only reason I'm giving 4 and not 5 stars is because we waited a bit more than expected for our appetizer to come out.

Jessica M.,"Puyallup, WA",5,39,13,2.0,11/16/2015,"I went here around midnight with my cousin and her boyfriend. As soon as we entered, we waited 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us, even as workers passed by us several times. Then the host finally tells us to either sit at the bar (which was full and had no open spots for us unless we wait 10 more minutes while the DJ cleans up) or sit in the dining area but expect really slow service because there's only one waitress. Great choices!  We decide to wait for the DJ because at least appetizers will be half off in the bar. She did not mention to the DJ that we were waiting so he was taking a very long time, chatting with randoms. I blame the host for that, she could have at least given him a heads up. She told us as soon as he leaves we could sit down and after all that waiting, the table was cluttered with filth. At that moment I see busser cleaning off one of the larger tables and dash towards it. Finally, a seat!  Another 10 minutes go by as we wait to order our delicious tap water and an appetizer that is clearly half the order they normally give, it's literally ""half off!"" Apparently she thinks this is all we are ordering because she has someone else drop it off and doesn't come back to us until we are finally able to flag her down 15 minutes later. We order cheeseburger sliders and a sizzling chicken and cheese.  The sliders were alright, no big complaints. The sizzling chicken and cheese was depressing. It was barely sizzling, the mashed potatoes were almost a liquid, and the cheese was unmelted sliced cheese thrown on. I get this entree fairly often, probably at least once or twice a month because it's semi Atkins friendly. This is NOT what it normally comes out looking/tasting like.  Maybe they are better during the day, but they need more people with better training at night. Don't be a late night restaurant/bar if you aren't equipped for it.  Last bit of advice: Go to the TGIFridays in Brea if you go this late. It's a bit of a drive, but worth it. It's the one I normally go to, but didn't this time since my cousin lived nearby the Cerritos one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=120

It came with a lot of very spicy jalapeño peppers, which wasn't mentioned in the menu description.  When the check came, I had to ask her to take off the free chips, so I wouldn't be charged for them.

Judy M.,"Cerritos, CA",1,8,,2.0,4/6/2016,"First of all, the place is not busy and that should've been a clue. Prices are a little high so you expect a little more during your visit. I wouldn't even consider this average. Our department went for lunch at 1pm. My friend got the appetizer sampler that turned out pretty good. However, my other friends and I got two soups, two half-sandwiches and fries. The soup was clam chowder and it was VERY diluted with water. Not much flavor or density to the broth AT ALL. When the fries came out, they were cold. The half sandwiches were BLTs with avocado. Have you ever been to a fast food restaurant that's all bun and no beef? That's what the sandwich was. It was cold, a thin-thin tomato, a thin-thin piece of bacon, and lettuce, with a very thin slices of avocado. Are you really tasted (and got) was bread. We watched a couple stand at the door waiting to be seated for a very long time as other employees would look at them and walk past. There are no occupied seats, there's nobody to wait on, so seat them!  Waitress was nice and brought us new fries. But I will not be back. Nor will my friends. The value just isn't here.

The mozzarella sticks were nice and crispy and the cheese was delicious. The buffalo sauce for the wings tasted fresh. The pretzel sticks were very warm, nicely salted, and omg that enticing smell when you break it open   I ordered the Sedona Black Bean Burger (subbed the chipotle mayo with regular mayo, and the pepper jack cheese and cheddar for only Swiss ) First of all, it's supposed to be a healthy burger :/ And then they add those two things above plus balsamic onions When I received my burger it was already falling apart. The bottom bun was not toasted at all and it had a HUGE amount of mayo. The patty was alright, but wasn't nearly as good as the black bean burger I  had at Knott's. Overall, I'd give it a 2.5/5 My boyfriend ordered the Original Cheeseburger.

The new batch of wings came out but they were half buffalo half bbq. So I told the bartender that we ordered only buffalo and didn't want bbq. She apologized and said she'll have the order corrected.  I then see me new wings come out drenched in Buffalo sauce which would normally have enjoyed if not for the fact that the cook simply drenched the bbq wings in Buffalo sauce and sent them back out. Let's just say the bite I took was pretty gross.  I notified the bartender about the wings and told her I was no longer interested in new wings since I lost my appetite. The bartender immediately informed the manager who comped the wing's and gave me a coupon for a free appetizer on my next visit...

He didn't really even try to pretend. Observing the rest of the employees, most of them didn't smile at all either. What a drab looking group of people! This kind of sucked because we had great service at the long beach location recently. Overall service wise I would not return to this location again, which is a shame because Cerritos is a nice city. Food wise, the boneless buffalo wings are delicious. The only other acceptable appetizer from the $12 unlimited menu is the mozzarella sticks and the loaded potato skins (if they aren't burnt). Sadly, even though I ordered a plain fettuccini Alfredo, it was pretty lacking in flavor in both the pasta and the sauce. I didn't expect it to be extravagant, but I really do cook better pasta at home.

Felicia M.,"Hacienda Heights, CA",604,270,848,4.0,1/30/2014,"It's Friday, you ain't got no job and you don't have sh*t to do! Oh wait, it was Wednesday and I was on my lunch break...oh well... This restaurant is supposed to give you the feeling that every day is Friday. For a split second I did.  This location is in the beautiful city of Cerritos in the huge shopping center off of Town Center by Wal-Mart. Location is great, the patio is nicely shaded by beautiful tress and the inside is pretty big.  We caught a late lunch and I have to say for close to 2PM it was pretty poppin' for a weekday. That being said we didn't have to wait which was nice. The service was top notch, not too much not ignored, ya' know what I mean. Our server recognized that we were on break and served us with no delay. Great place to come on a work lunch break. I ordered the dragonfly salmon with rice pilaf and broccoli. The fish was cooked nicely with a crispy crust just the way I like it. It was actually a very generous size and had a honey glaze and topped with a mango salsa. It was mouthwatering good. The rice was a little sog but the broccoli was great so I didn't mind at all.  Now for the item that kicked my rating from a solid 3 stars to a healthy 4.... THE ULTIMATE BROWNIE!!!!!!!! OMG, I am not a dessert person so when my coworker said ""let's share"" I told her I would pass. When the server brought it to the table and plopped down two spoons I picked one up before my friend. Picture this: Warm freshly baked Ghirardelli chocolate brownie still warm, chocolate syrup poured on top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream toped with walnuts and caramel drizzle. WTH!!! Couldn't pass it up. All in all it was a really good lunch. They have a large menu with something for everyone including dieters, Vegheads and kids. Very clean and the refills came without asking.

Why even come here you ask? I do not come here by choice. It's either someone's birthday or it wasn't my turn to pick where to eat. Chicken is never a good choice here. It always comes out dry no matter what dish you pick. So dry in fact that it becomes a rubbery texture. It's so over priced for the quality that they give. The only good thing about this place is their happy hour. I ordered the Jack Daniel's chicken burger with fries and my fries were stale like it had been sitting out for too long.

I had this one server taking care of the patio area. Given we were a large party, Food can take its time to come but what was unacceptable is that she took one of my friends' orders wrong, and so it took a longer time. On top of that, she charges us for the wrong item and when I spoke to the manager and she got called out, she had the nerve to say that she did right!

Elizabeth C.,"West Covina, CA",254,40,36,2.0,4/8/2015,"Okay so I give this place a two star rating because this is my second time going there during LUNCH and I did not have a great experience. The first I went to this location I was seated but I seated 10 mins in and please keep in mind during my lunch break there were no customers there so I did not understand why it took someone 10 mins to seat me. The waitress was nice don't get me wrong but she hardly checked up on me I was the one always having to flag her down for something and it was just slow service and I did not understand why when there wasn't really any customers during that time. The second time I went which was today 4/8/15 I figured since I was running late I decided to order my food in advance so that when I got there it would be ready and I could just eat. Tell me why when I get there I state to the gentleman who took my order that I was the person who phoned in and he stated oh yes let me go put that order in for you and I am thinking in head really bro that is why I phoned in advance so that I wouldn't have to wait long then he leaves to place my order and no one wants to seat me servers are walking by hearing me jingle my keys and I finally decided to seat myself down at the bar when I had told the waitress that I placed in a phone order and was upset that no one could sit me down she didn't even want to hear me out and went straight to the manager. Then when the other gentleman came back with my bill I noticed my bill was higher than usually when I looked at the menu I noticed he had placed in the wrong order and from there I just told the manager everything that happened she was sorry and got everything corrected right away.  The only thing that sucks is that it took almost the rest of my lunch to get my food. I had to eat really fast and couldn't really enjoy my lunch day. When asking for my bill I guess the manager felt really bad for all the inconveniences she gave me a free meal, but my thing is this place is the closet to me for a decent lunch I didn't care if I had to pay all I ask is to get my order right and have it ready when I call and get there so that way I can enjoy my lunch especially if its a slow lunch time and there really isn't any customers there should be no reason for screw ups. If we can just get the customer service corrected then I can consider giving this place a higher rating and the management should consider reading these because it seems I am not the only one upset about the customer services.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=240

Joshua K.,"Norwalk, CA",220,22,,1.0,5/18/2013,"Just for clarification, this event happened last year but I forgot that I had rated this place so highly at one point in time.  My boyfriend's cousin came to town from Mexico and she is 25. She's a pretty young college aged girl like you and me except she's from Mexico. Well, we ordered a round of drinks and the waiter checks for her I.D.; fair enough. She gives her passport to the waiter who sees that it's from Mexico and then swiftly declines her order for alcohol based on what? That they don't take passports as a form of I.D.  Let me just make a few things clear here:  1) Many tourists eat at this restaurant because there is a reputable Sheraton across the street as well as the fact that it's in a reputable plaza like the Cerritos Towne Center. I have been in TGI Fridays enough at this location (I used to go once a week) to see people from Australia, England, and other general places from Europe get carded only to see them serve a passport as I.D. and the waiters all see this as permissible.  2) There is a sign in the front of the establishment which states that they take passports as a form of I.D.  So there's something going on here. Either the manager at the time was racist or just had a completely different standard for where the passports come from...which means he's racist. I don't even know how else to explain it.  Then, when we called the manager over and pointed this out, he laughed at us and said it was okay just this once as if we were burdening him.  Then, as the night drew on, the waiter was increasingly more rude, not very adamant about serving us anymore and he messed up our order. That was the night we decided not to come back.  Let me tell you though that we were building up to that point. As management changed, so did the waiters and some of the male waiters there have made it very clear that they are not comfortable with serving a same sex couple (remember I said boyfriend at the beginning of this review?) and several of my friends have complained and not wanted to come back because certain waiters have always been colder to us than others and steadily avoided serving our table for very long. I don't really want to write a novel here, but that's basically it. We won't go back because we don't feel welcome and it seems that the management at the time (I don't know if he's still around) was very narrow minded and openly discriminated against certain people.  A disclaimer: The manager did attempt to contact me after I contacted corporate and he left a short message. I tried to get back to him once and he wasn't there (obviously he can't be there 24/7) so I just let it go. There's no point in talking to that man when we've had these problems before and don't intend on going back to hold his hand and resolve them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=260
Steven C.,"Corona, CA",16,8,,1.0,9/11/2016,"Can i do 1/4 of a star? Just because I actually like their food? Their jack daniels menu is awesome... half off appetizers all day on Sunday is great.. but.... OMG!! This location is better off being a Fast Food restaurant!! Customer service is completely non-existant! Never coming back! It's a joke. Me and my family waited for 20 minutes for an open table, even though there were 4 open tables.. we waited 10 minutes for the hostess to come out of the back of the restaurant. Then another 10 minutes for them to figure out their life, before we got sat to a table that was open the whole time we were waiting!! A busser came to us and attempted to seat us, but when we said that we were being helped by the hostess, he said ""well that's just how it is.."" then gave my wife an ugly look and stood there for 2 minutes looking irritated like we spoke French to him or asked for his kidney.. I get that this may be your part time job, but if you don't like it.. QUIT! Then we waited another 15 minutes and finally a server came to  take our drink order. And the only reason someone came was because my wife had to stand up and raise her hand! We were there to celebrate my son's bday.. so if it wasn't for him we would have left! By the time we got our food we were already there for an hour and 15 mins. We got there at 8:45pm. We got our food around 10:30pm.. the dining area was almost empty but the bar area was maybe half full.. I saw at least 6 servers and almost everyone had their food already. 2 of the servers were busy chatting up a couple of girls while the other servers were nowhere to be found. We got our food and ate in like 15 minutes. Then asked for the check and to go boxes. They had dropped off the check and took another 15 minutes to even see the server come out of the back. But by then I had had enough and was walking with the check and my credit card to find anybody I can to give it to so I can pay. Staff were walking right past me like I didn't exist! Finally my server came running from the back with one box and a bag. ""I told her nevermind I don't need a to go box and I just wanted to pay and leave."" So we did and left, and will never be back again! I have worked in customer service since I was 15 years old. First at McDonalds, then at a hotel and now as a nurse! Never have I ran into such disregard for customer service and hospitality. As a customer I felt unwelcomed, under appreciated and I have never been treated so low like me and my family were a Burden to them.

At one point there was a line of 4 groups waiting to put there name down for atleast 4-5 minutes all while the group of employees stood around and chatted and finally had to interrupt the gossiping and received a cold attitude.  Also,  the fact that the manager walked around with an arrogant attitude barking out orders without even caring about his surroundings or doing the unthinkable of perhaps helping his team, all while having ATLEAST 7-10 empty tables.

PRETZELS WITH CRAFT BEER CHEESE: - Thick, warm pretzels served with our creamy craft beer-cheese dipping sauce made with regionally crafted beer, garnished with crispy bacon and green onions. - slightly crispy on the inside and super soft on the inside - probably the best appetizer - I didn't actually try the cheese part but the actual pretzel was money BBQ CHICKEN FLATBREAD: - Crispy flatbread topped with tender pulled chicken breast in a chipotle barbecue sauce and baked with Monterey Jack cheese, cheddar, cilantro and hand-cut red peppers and red onion. - very disappointing - the flatbread was so tough that I think it had been sitting out for a while - would NOT recommend We also got the POTATO SKINS and the MOZZARELLA STICKS. SERVICE: Happy Hour is only available in the bar area but we had a party of 8. So fortunately the service people noticed we were disappointed and offered to have us sit at the main dining room but get Happy Hour prices. Our waitress was very kind and checked up on us quite often. In the end if you have a large party they automatically charge gratuity.  ENVIRONMENT: can be quite loud depending on the crowd. The tables have the trademark white and red stripes. There is also an outside patio area that is part of the bar. The outside patio area is prime for 2nd hand smoking.  Overall, decent place for late night drinks and to hang out. The food is pretty horrible but it's all about the drinks anyway. The prices are reasonable at happy hour.

Anyways, my dad and I ordered the 2 for $20 (drinks not included). It's a pretty good because you do get a sufficient amount of food. You can always get more premium stuff such as steak or seafood for a surcharge of 3 or 5 dollars, but we stuck with the basic 10/10. So overall, the quality is decent. It doesn't have the home cooked fresh taste so don't come here if you're looking for that. If you are looking for a good vibed place and bar food, then this is the place. I got the ""Friday's Shrimp"" with a side of Macaroni and Cheese. It originally came with fries but you can swap it out. The best part about this entree was the Mac and Cheese, maybe because I love Mac and Cheese. The shrimp was better than I expected! It was crispy and the batter had flavor! Enough about my meal though. My dad got the ""Balsamic Chicken Caesar Salad"". It's everything that the name says. Just balsamic, chicken, and Caesar. My dad found it mediocre at best. It was just a bowl of Caesar with some chicken. The chicken had a drizzle of balsamic and was a bit dry. Before our entrees we got the friend green beans, they're pretty crispy and when you dunk it in ranch, even better. The sauce that comes with these little beans is a mix between a horseradish kick and ranch. Service is a bit slow, but that's what expected when the restraint is packed and on a Friday. The atmosphere is nice though. It can be a family type place (away from the bar) or a good hangout spot with friends.

The salad on the side taste like its been out of refrigeration and already premade with the sauce. However the baby back rib tasted alright. I'm giving this a 3 stars because TGI still has potential.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE BASED ON CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. they must have forgot that the customers are why they are here, without them you will not be in business.

But we were quite surprised to find out the wait would be one hour. During our wait, I noticed several servers just standing around and maybe about six parties were served before us. After asking the host how much longer our wait would be they informed us they were waiting on a particular party to finish with their table so we could be seated and they stated they couldn't seat us elsewhere due to the amount of servers on this shift. I understand if they are short staffed and everyone in my party continued to give this Friday's the benefit of the doubt since we've previously received great service at this location. I ordered the endless appetizers & my loaded potato skins came out disgustingly crispy and dry. Our server Nicholes was sweet and seemed like he was doing the best he could so I'm not complaining about him at all (especially because he seemed new & I know very well it can take a while to get the hang of a new job). But, we were there for over three hours, maybe for about 40 minutes that the people in my party were actually consuming food.

My boyfriend and I ordered to go, like we've done millions of times over the past 6 years, but this time was just an absolute waste of time, money, and energy.    I ordered: Friday's three for all: sesame Jack chicken strips, loaded potato skins and the green bean fries. Boyfriend ordered a BBQ pulled pork sandwich and that's when she began to repeat my order....I mentioned the sandwich comes with a side and she said ""oh yea...."" So I just blurted out veggies to make it simple cause I could tell the three for all was still processing.  Pick up time is in 20 minutes, cool. The boyfriend leaves and a few minutes later he calls me. They told him they called me 3 times to tell me that they can't do the three for all with the options I chose, so I would have to order them all separately. I said ""WWHHAAT?! We order the same thing EVERYTIME!!! And NO ONE called me!! Not once!"" He told her that but she insisted that she couldn't do it so I said FINE order the TWO for all then!  2 minutes later I get another phone call ""Ok, I guess they CAN do it, they're gonna make your 3 for all now.""        So, he's waiting there and 10 minutes later I get a text ""Just got the food, they forgot to give us our sauces. They're getting them now."" Got the food home, the sauce they put in the box was ONE ranch and ONE wasabi ranch.....no Jack daniel's sauce for the chicken, no sour cream for the potato skins, no BBQ sauce for the sandwich. Which wouldn't be so bad if the potato skins weren't over salted, the pulled pork wasn't already lacking BBQ sauce, and the chicken wasn't mostly dry chicken jerky. Needless to say, I have had better food for way cheaper.    Oh, and they had the nerve to turn down our $5 off coupon even after the whole fiasco of making him wait for the 3 for all (and lying about calling me...tsk tsk). No good TGI, it's no wonder you guys are going downhill fast. Step it up in your kitchen. And hire some customer friendly hostesses.

Hostess, wearing those patterned black nylons (not the ""I'm a stripper"" fishnets or ""I'm""m classy"" plain black) seated me in the second small table to the left of the hostess podium.  Server arrived (Julianna) took my drink order (iced tea).  While I was waiting, I counted six tables that hadn't been bussed; understandable if its the lunch or dinner rush, but it took the staff (which appeared to be more than adequate for mid-day) 20 minutes to clear tables.  The last one, the booth on my left, got cleared just before I received my bill. I think my server got assigned to another section, as the hostess gal came back to take my order (the Salmon Langostino).  Salmon was fine; cooked properly.  The lobster pieces (all six of them) were disappointing.  Unlike most menus you've seen at other restaurants, what you see here is definitely what you get.  Veggies were either over- or undercooked; carrots were crunchy, while the broccoli was barely holding together.  I also opted for those Parmesan fries, which the hostess told me ""there's an up charge for those"".  While I saw calorie count info for the sides, I honestly didn't see such an up charge on the menu.  You also get a whole six (that's 6) wedges, drizzled in melted butter with a dash of grated Parmesan cheese and a dusting of parsley.  It might have been the size of a small or medium potato if you reassembled it. Iced tea refill were handled by no less that four servers (Julianna, the hostess, a cute gal with red carnation in her hair and a random server); this doesn't come as any surprise as I was seated in a main thoroughfare area. The real kicker is the bill; this gets interesting.  The ticket I had just listed the Salmon Langostino with steak fries and veggies for $18.99.  The iced tea wasn't listed.  Subtotal $18.99, tax $1.66, total $20.65.  Put my card in the sleeve along with my $8 (haha, this still cracks me up) gift certificate.  Julianna comes back, with the new adjusted total of $15.79. Hmmm, let's do some math. According to the receipt I was presented, they should have removed $8 from the price of the entree, then compute tax and total...18.99 - 8.00 = 10.99 x .0875 = .96.  Total = 10.55.  The ticket I received after they returned my card was for $15.79.  So, lesse...I got online to look up their menu, but prices aren't listed.  I'm under the impression that they forgot to add my iced tea (let's call it $2 for the sake of example) ... 18.99 + 2 = 20.99 - $8 disc = 12.99 + 1.14 tax = 14.33.  Hmm, still not right.  I won't bore you with more examples, but I kept adjusting the cost of the iced tea, minus the $8 discount and figured 8.75% tax.  The closest result I came up with (without performing stupid amounts of mental gymnastics) was $15.74 (their total was $15.79...I'll deal with a nickel slippage).  This would mean my ice tea was $3.49 (accounting for standard $xx.99 pricing).   The thing that really bothers me is that they don't itemize your order; I can imagine if people did that ""2 for $20"" nonsense and the servers just ring it up like a normal order.  They also don't show you how they compute a discount; I just got a bill for $15.79 with the ubiquitous blanks for tip and total.  I gave the standard 15% ($2.37...since they got on my bad side) for a new, adjusted grand total of $18.16. Won't be back because: 1.  Lackluster service 2.  Lackluster appearance of restaurant (bus your tables!) 3.  Lackluster appearance, flavor and overpriced food 4.  Location (Long Beach to Cerritos?  No thanks) Sending feedback to their corporate office, mostly to question their billing issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=280

Lee A.,"Paramount, CA",133,165,42,2.0,12/3/2011,"Walked into a slightly busy Friday night to not be greeted by the four employees at the front desk. I was asked for my name and number in my party and told the wait would be 10 minutes and that they're ready now. What? After a few confusing minutes, my friend and I were placed at the table nearest the restroom. And informed as such, that we'd be near the restroom. The waiter was a great person, though. The only saving grace for the evening. He even informed all the people in his section that he was going on his lunch break and would leave another waitress in his place, with her in tow to introduce her to his tables. After a few minutes of perusing the ""affordable"" menu where nothing fell below $15, we happened upon the 2 Entrees for $20 special and decided upon that. The waiter placed our order, brought our drink orders and proceeded with his break. The appetizer was okay as usual. Nothing special there. The table next to us, who were seated after us and ordered after us got their meals before we did. Not good, considering we ordered similar entrees. When our meals finally did arrive, my chicken bruschetta pasta was flavorless angel hair pasta with generous amounts of cold bruschetta and rather dry strips of chicken placed on top and minute amounts of Parmesan cheese. It lacked significant flavor, but being hungry, I consumed most of it. The chicken couldn't be made palatable.  My friend's boyfriend joined us shortly into our meal. He failed to be acknowledged by any of the wait staff. No one asked if he wanted a drink or wanted to order a meal. When our dessert to be shared arrived, it arrived with two spoons and not three. No one even offered him a glass of water. The dessert was a single slice of pie to be shared amongst two people, presented on a large plate with a drizzle of chocolate sauce. It was disappointing at best. While they were attentive with refilling my friend's soda, I had to ask three times for a refill of hot water for my tea. We paid our bill and exited, not receiving any form of thank you or acknowledgment from the five workers near the front desk, including the two workers holding open the inner front doors.

Maxine H.,"Fullerton, CA",192,410,29,1.0,1/6/2011,"OH MY GOSH!! Now normally I'm a fan of TGIF happy hour. 1/2 off appetizers, $5 daily drink specials, and somewhat cheap drafts. I mean who can complain with that kind of line up, right? Well let me say, this time around it was such a horrible mistake. Showed up for happy hour of course around 10 on a Wednesday night. They started this new karaoke night on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. Sounds cool right? WRONG!! Normally I love karaoke (I'm Asian, of course I would) but when people start singing songs in languages you can't understand and are totally off, that's a sign you should get up and leave..IMMEDIATELY!! If you think you can handle the ""singing"" I applaud you b/c that's going to take some balls.  On to the food now I suppose, I mean it is restaurant. The food used to be much better. My party and I ordered spinach dip, boneless buffalo wings, and sliders. First of all the buffalo wings were SALTY and tasted like grocery store freezer section nuggets. BLEH!!! At least the celery was good (you would hope because its just celery). The spinach dip was all right. Portion wise there seemed to be more than before so that's a plus. Sliders were decent nothing amazing though. I guess you can't expect too much for happy hour, but come on TGIF, I've had better at bars...BARS!!

First of all, the flatbread was soft, like someone had microwaved it. I've had these flatbreads at other TGI's, they're supposed to be crunchy!

I've even gone here a couple of times for late night happy hours and hung out at the patio. I do admit that this is one of the older Friday's in the area, but I hear it's also the most popular despite so many people hatin' and debatin' here. I do wish that the bar section was larger and able to accommodate more people. They should also update their televisions to really nice flat screen LCDs to help make it more attractive to sports watchers, for example. I don't know if it's just here, but this Friday's should serve more variety when it comes to beers. I actually think that Friday's should really strive to have as wide a variety as the Yard House, seeing how they aren't a microbrewery or carry exclusive lines of beer. Honestly, I thought the food was good and reasonably priced. There used to be a chicken sandwich they served here up until recently that was pretty good. I used to have that every time I visited. If this Friday's steps up and remodels their patio, which I heard was in the works and design phase, and they update and expand their bar, I believe that people's opinions of this place would slowly turn around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=340

First of all he needs some customer service skills because the way he came off was so RUDE! telling us to have patience after waiting 45 minutes for drinks! How about apologize for the wait and say you'll check on it instead of saying ""you guys have to be patience"" and put his hands up!!! Never again stepping foot in this place! My family won't be stepping foot in a TGIF for a long while! Smh! Very disappointed!! Calling corporate tomorrow because this was horrible!!

Kellee N.,"Cypress, CA",114,393,227,2.0,3/22/2011,"Worst service and most mediocre food EVER. I'd never come here if it was my own decision, but this seems to be a top choice for meeting up for happy hour or eating late at night.  The food all tastes the same, like ""TGI Fridays."" The only thing that's even bearable for me to eat is the buffalo chicken sandwich, which is still really boring. How does that happen when something is smothered in spicy, buffalo wing sauce? It's CHICKEN. HOW DO YOU MESS UP A CHICKEN SANDWICH? Many times I've come here with friends at midnight when there's no one in the restaurant part and it takes two hours to get out of there. No thanks. Oh, and my dad loves strawberry lemonade, and one time we were here and had a waiter who was like, ""You can get as many refills as you want on this."" My dad SPECIFICALLY asked, ""for free?"" and the kid replied, ""yes."" My dad, of course, was like, ""yay"" and had six of them.  That waiter had gone on break or went home, and when our replacement waiter brought the bill, my dad was indeed charged for all six of them. My dad brought it up to the guy and said he asked if they were free and the other waiter said yes, so he went back and took the refills off, which was VERY nice of him.

It was more along the lines of...feels more like a local bar, decent service, average food, and generous drinks. 10PM kicks off their happy hour prices (especially on a Tuesday). Which I ordered for my favorite Cerritos Baristas and company: Drinks -1 Glass of Water -1 Jack and Coke -1 Black and Sam-Schooner -1 Blue Moon-Schooner -1 Gin and Tonic Appetizers -1 order of Nachos Grande The nachos we're average honestly, I could make better nachos. They only served as a filler to go with the abundance of alcohol. My friends enjoyed their schnooners while I enjoyed the Gin and Tonic/Jack and Coke combination as a kickback to end the night. Blasting Karaoke Classics from Michael Jackson, Blink 182, and Journey made the cut for the locals who braved their fear of the mic under (or non) intoxication. $36.00 later (tax and tip), exchange of drunk stories and several smoke breaks was a fine way to end the night. Service was prompt, bathrooms were sanitary and Albert the bartender sure had his trick mixology arsenal on the deck that night. Beware of drunk driving (with entrapment set by the Cerritos policy for safety). As a friend said earlier that day...  ""You can't go to TGI Friday's on a Tuesday.""

Really???!!!!! Wow I have never waited so long for food and my bf's food came out fine but mine not even close. I received a well done steak when I asked for a medium steak I got chicken that was disgustingly dry when I asked for shrimp and then I got mashed potatoes instead of a baked potato.  The waitress gave me so much attitude for her mistake.

So mix those patterns together and make it vertically striped, which creates a dizzying effect of a restaurant named TGIF.  Also, I don't feel like it's a Friday inside a TGIF. It feels like a Monday, which creates more tension inside me, and add that to the boisterous laughter of the group next booth yonder...and I'm more annoyed.

I'd done this before a few months ago and was very happy with my order.  This time, not so much. It was lunchtime on a weekday, and while the place wasn't very busy, there was only one shy hostess seating people.  She barely made eye contact with anyone and didn't seem to know what she was doing. It took quite some time for her to sort the line of people at the hostess stand.  There was one other customer also waiting for takeout, and the hostess brought both orders out together. She and a manager just stood there and fumbled around for a few minutes and I had to ask for my food, which was sitting right there. I'd already paid for it, so I don't know why neither of them thought to hand it to me.  The meal itself was very disappointing.  As I stated earlier, I'd had the same burger before and it was YUMMY, so I was excited about my food. Unfortunately, the burger was not made as I'd asked (I wanted medium-well and it was still pink). I didn't have time to go back, since I was at work. The fries were totally soggy and so was the bun (even without condiments). The lettuce was bitter and the tomato wasn't fresh and they put the wrong cheese on it.

I love their patio section, it's not like the one at the block where it's seated rite in the crowd, very few outside tables but normally when we get there around 8pm on a friday or so, there's always seatings.  When I first came here back in 2007, I thought the service was wayyy too slow, and it was, this tgif wasn't as crowded when we came back then, but I decided to come on here today to give them a rating because we got very excellent treatment when we were there on 12/19/09 around 5:30 pm for happy hour time. This alone is a rating on their service not food, since tgif food is the same everywhere.  We got there and wanted to sit in the patio area, but it was full and all reserved, so we stood waiting, told for wait about 15-20 mn, we stood there for about 5 minutes, the lady waitress that was working patio section saw that we wanted to sit there, instead took us over to a small booth next to the bar area and seated us.  She was very nice to notice us and was super friendly to us. As we were super hungry, she totally helped and it was so wonderful of her. She didn't have to do that but she did, and to me that is beyond excellent service!!

I went back to my table and after 5 more minutes I was finally able to get the attention of a waitress. We told her we wanted to eat and I had to take matters into my own hands to get drinks. She explained the shortage of waiters and I replied to her "" I understand it's not your fault and maybe you should ask your manager to get someone to help you"". She said she would have her manager talk to us. On arrival her manager LAUREN asked if we had a problem, to which I replied, not any more, but I had to get my own drinks after waiting 15 minutes of no service. She was then accompanied by manager NICOLE. LAUREN then proceeded to tell me that ""there is no cussing when in TGIF"", Which shocked me because I had not said or used any foul language. LAUREN said someone had over herd cussing from our direction. From then on they, LAUREN and NICOLE, made the experience seem like we were some sort of low class, not belonging scum that should not be in their place of business. We actually kindly excused our selves and asked that our order be cancelled. I have been to this TGIF almost every other Friday for years.  I'm a Stripes Member #0287000032295199, and will never set foot in the Cerritos TGIF again. $11 on drinks to what we were hopping would be a nice dinner, to now having a sour feeling in our empty stomachs as we left.

Allison L.,"Dallas, TX",801,544,408,1.0,9/11/2009,"Welcome, pull up a chair and take a load off. This ones a real keeper of a review. Bookmark it, save it...whatever.  I was in Cerritos on business and for lunch my co-workers wanted to go here. Ugh. Ok, I said.  First off, its the start of the lunch hour so I'm expecting it to be quite busy, however when we walked in maybe 20 people or so were in the restaurant (and you know how big these places are). The hostess was no where to be seen. We waited...and waited...and waited. Finally about 5 minutes later the hostess goes ""have you been helped"" I looked at her and said ""are we sitting at a table?"". She nodded and grabbed some menus. We sat outside cause I mean, come on? It's SO CAL! We waited about 10 minutes for our waitress to even come to our table....no waters, no silverware...no joke. She finally finds time to come and take our order. Food came...wasn't bad. I ate and was ready to leave. I asked for the check. The check came to $29.32 (there were three of us). Sounds great for a lunch. Hmm? I paid and left a $5 tip (against my better judgement) and went back to work.  Fast forward 4 days later. I get home to Big D. Decide to check my credit card statement...hmmm there's a strange charge on here for, wait for it...wait....$87.66...where....FRIDAY'S IN CERRITOS!!! You have got to me f*ing kidding me here. So I called the restaurant and asked to speak with a manager. When he gets on the phone I explain the situation. I told him I didn't understand how the waitress was able to close out for the day UNAWARE that she received a $58.34 tip for LUNCH!! FROM ONE TABLE!!! Was she dumb? Apparently. He just said, well sometimes they don't tip out until the end of the day...what? I just said that... It's almost like stealing too....how the hell did she come up with that #?  It doesn't even make sense with my original total...??? I asked him to refund the difference of what I had actually signed off on and refund to my CC. He said he would look into it to see what went wrong (and if I was lying, I'm sure) and call me back. About 2 hours later he calls me back telling me I was right...we know this already, keep going. He asked me to come in so we can refund. I explained that I lived 3 states over and that I am unable at this time to come into your horrid establishment. He says he can't refund my CC without the actual card...what? For serious? No...really...what? Since when did Friday's make the CC rules? So he said he was going to send me a check from the corporate off for the difference. Ok, fine I'm too irritated to argue.  Two days later I receive a FedEx from said Friday's. Open it. *insert scream*. CASH! The MF sent CASH! I mean everyone likes cash, but I much rathered it go back on my CC...cause now I still have to pay for it.  Check would have been a little better, I would have just deposited.  You wish I deposited cash.  Oh and he sent coupons. Why is it I ALWAYS get coupons when things go wrong? Is that just what people do? I feel like I'm a coupon queen. Anycoupon...there was also a note in there...the a*hole I spoke to was the BAR Manager...not the GM like I had asked. They didn't even say if the GM was in...they just passed me to the BAR Manager. He wrote a lovely little note with stupid coupons. Done.  My REAL question is that...did this waitress get to keep her $58.34 tip? Did they make her pay it back with that cash? I wrote the corporate office for Friday's and explained what had happened. Twice. No response.

Beer prices are pretty cheap during happy hour too but you're pretty much limited to domestic AKA beer pong beer. There's also an outdoor patio that is nice for chillin on late night drinks/snacks and karaoke sometimes if you're into that.  Giving it 2 stars because I can barely swallow the food.

Happy with these!) and Jack Daniels chicken strips (way overdone to the point of not being able to distinguish hard fried batter and hard fried chicken, Yuk!).  They serve ice cold 22 oz draft beers for $3. Their 2 for $20 deal is meh. Nothing spectacular really stands out on their offerings.

The slider, fries, and mozzarella were good--nothing spectacular. But my friend didn't like her flatbread at all. I had the orange dreamsicle ($6) which I enjoyed. Another friend had the electric lemonade (also $6) which she liked. They also had beer bottles. My friend had a Bud Light Platinum ($?). The website had some particular three dollar drinks deals which we asked the waitress about, but the manager said they're a franchisee so they don't necessarily do everything that's on the website which sucks. Our waitress actually kinda sucked in that it felt like she was avoiding us and was never near our direction for her to flag her down. But I had a good time because of the people I was with.

Please bring more than one set of napkins to a table... our whole table (8 people) had finger food and everyone only had one sheet of napkin each 3. a mistake was made on my check and i brought it to the waitress' attention. when she gave me the new check, she did not give me an  itemized receipt. now i can not get points for my $130 meal. i call back the following night and they say they can't look up my itemized receipt because I didn't have an itemized receipt.....

This was our first time here.  We are regulars at the long beach location!!  When the hostess sat us at the table, it was dirty. We didn't want to wait much longer so we wiped it off with our baby's baby whipes.  As soon as our server got to the tablet and greeted himself as Bryantt with a huge smile and offered us drinks. Once we got our drinks, we ordered 3 endless appetizers which took about 25 minutes to come to our table. They didn't even last 5minutes before they were finished so we waited for our server to appear to order a refill. He was no where to be found. About 10minutes later, we asked him for a refill and he said he had already ordered one, which was odd because we didn't let him know what kind of sauce we wanted for our boneless wings. So we requested a sauce. And he rushed to leave, we didnt even get to order our entrees .Our refills took another 15 minutes, and we were missing one. When he came , I had ordered a petite sirloin for here and a shrimp Friday for my husband who was being impatient because the food was taking too long. Again he rushed off, I had to call him several times, but he did not respond.we figured he might have been busy with other tables, but once we looked around it was pretty empty in the section we sat in. I wanted to let him know I wanted to change my plate for the rib trio. So I had to get up and look for him. Once I told him I let him know what I wanted he seemed a bit disturbed and annoyed. My rib trio came about 5 minutes after which was very strange because our appetizers took almost half an hour. Our shrimp Fridays to go took for ever to come out so I asked another server for the check since our's was nowhere to be found again.  Once he came with our bill, I noticed he never ordered our Friday s shrimp to go. We were so fed up with the service and the delays I didnt bother to let them know it was my husband s birthday since he was already mad that the food took forever. I was eager to speak to a manager about our situation, but my sister was also annoyed she wanted to get up and leave. I have been a server since I was 18, I am now 26 and I know this is not a way to deliver customer service.

Ray A.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,1/16/2014,"I recently came to TGI Fridays for the first time.  I will never go back.  Upon entry, we were given the option to sit in the dining area or the bar and informed happy hour prices would be in effect in ""a few minutes,"" for the bar side only.  Thinking we were primarily spending on food, rather than drinks, I initially opted for the dining side.  However, after seeing the happy hour prices included half-off on appetizers, we asked to be switched to the bar area a few minutes later. Upon getting our bill, we noticed we had not been given any happy hour prices.  The server was very polite and apologetic, but said it was because we had initially sat in the dining area and placed the first part of our order there.  She offered to let us speak to the manager, which I accepted.  This is where I became irritated. The managed declined to oblige my request to speak with him.  He hid in back and made the server deal with us.  She returned to say he refused to honor the happy hour prices because they were placed moments before happy hour began.  The first part of the order was placed 9 mins prior to happy hour.  The second part was two minutes prior.  I had assumed when we were initially happy hour would begin in ""a few minutes,"" they would not be that strict to the minute, and if so, kindly advise us to wait a few more minutes since we had relocated specifically to get the discount. Irritated the manager didn't even have the courtesy to come speak to me, the server apologized again and asked if she should make a second request for him to come speak to us.  I declined and told her I wouldn't ever return to the restaurant.  She relayed this message to the manager and even still he blew off speaking to us.  So we were informed of their special discounts, relocated to the bar for nothing, paid full price on appetizers we thought would be discounted and never even got blown off in our request to speak to the manager.  It's these kinds of draconian business practices, focusing entirely on opting for a few extra dollars at the expense of customer satisfaction, that leads chains like this to a poor reputation.  This is my only experience with this company and it was once too many.  Truly awful (mis)management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=360

Yes of course I know the food is over priced for its quality, yes I know the hosts suck balls, and yes I even know that the service is slower than your great aunt Mary. I know, so what's with the 4 stars? Well, let's be real here. Why do you go to Friday's: To have a great meal? To have a romantic date? To celebrate your Birthday? To be treated like a princess? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you're an idiot and in serious need of a reality check.  Friday's is not that kind of place. I barely consider this place a restaurant. If you look and treat this place like a bar, it's pretty damn good. My friends and I always go when we're not in the bar mood but could use a couple of beers or we're broke (happy hour most appetizers & beers are half off) or it's too late to go anywhere else (closes at 2am). I recommend going in small groups during happy hour and sit either at the bar or in the outdoor patio. The patio isn't too big but I always find a table or two empty for us to take. Though one time I went with a huge party that literally took up the entire patio.. It was pretty hilarious to see people get all pissed when they came out to the patio and there were no more seats because our group took them all.  Overall, the place sucks as a restaurant but change your mindset and you'll have a good time. This place is actually my go-to on Sunday's.

True story, I met the manager (not sure if he's still the manager) of this particular TGIFridays at a different TGIFridays (The Block) for a World of Warcraft Deathwing Realm meet and greet 3 years ago.  Apparently, a perk of being a TGIFridays manager is that everyone you eat with at any TGIFridays doesn't have to pay for food.  BEST COINCIDENCE EVER, since we had no idea who would show up to begin with.

D L.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",47,98,56,2.0,9/15/2011,"This is my review of a $5.99 Chicken Bruchetta Pasta I had for lunch. Service: Service was fairly good.  I was promptly seated at my to a table of my choosing the moment I walked in.  The host was nice and the waitress took my drink order right away.  They didn't really take any time explaining the lunch specials or getting to know me. Food: At $5.99 for a sit down restaurant it's a decent deal.  Despite it's presentation, the flavor and composition has much to be desired.  I wouldn't even say it's aspiration.  It's more like the high fashion section at a Walmart than a Coach store in a fancy shopping mall, which is what I expect at a sit down restaurant.  The dish artfully arranged angel hair pasta topped with pieces of grilled chicken with some dark colored sauce and sprinkles of tiny pieces of parmigiana, parsley, and small hints of diced tomato.  Although it looks good, it has that feeling of being cheaply put together.  The sauce has no texture, doesn't tie in at all besides adding a hint of sweet and salt.  I prefer something a bit more thick and creamy that really coats the pasta.  Something that feels like a skin of a young woman as your bring her in close, that certain something that brings it all together and makes it a blissful experience.  It's more like an middle aged madam, and you can't help but ask, ""Do you have some prettier girls in the back?""  The grilled pieces of chicken were ok.  Well salted, a little crispy but not burnt.  At this point it's like putting a condom on a bad experience. Drink: The reason I'm giving it a 2 is a simple unsweetened ice tea cost me $2.87.  That's like 1/2 the price of my lunch.  It's like I felt for the ""But, wait, there's more"" of a cheap infomercial.  Sounds cool to get that extra, then you realize the shipping and handling has screwed you over 1/2 the price of the product.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=420

This is not a single stalled restroom.  This one had several stalls that men and women were supposed to use. I believe this is against the law. I will be reporting this to the state of california.

Me and my two friends wanted a drink and late night meal.

So we get seated order off the happy hour menu... order more drinks ( thinking they would be $5 each) and are having a nice time... Then the server tells us that we can't have the happy hour special because we are not at the bar, but she will see what she can do. Um excuse me but we were told we were getting the 1/2 off that is why we only ordered items that were under that menu. So she never comes back to tell us ""what she can do."" A while passes we don't have the waters we ordered (it took 30 minutes to get water....) then my meal comes.. I start to eat, me and my friends are having a good time and the waitress comes up and takes our food ( my friends were done, but I still had half my meal).. I was not done, nor did she ask if I was done! She just took my plate with fries and 1/3 a burger on it... I do cover my food in ketchup but that is the way I like to eat it.... I don't think it would have been that hard to ask are you done with this since there was still 1/2 a meal on the plate! Then she brought our bill...We weren't given any discount. So we asked for a manager... none ever came but the hostess fixed the bill a bit... Then we gave our cards... and our more stripes card... well they lost our more stripes card... and the manager was supposed to come out but never did... This place will never get my money again.

Onion Soup - After trying all the TIGF soups, I recommend the Onion Soup, it is quite yummy. It would be hard to choose between this Onion Soup or the one at Mimi's Cafe. Jack Daniel Rib and Shrimp w/ fries - switched the fries for onion rings. The Shrimp was good but, the ribs tasted a little bit dry and not as soft and falling right off the bone as I would like.  The JD sauce did help. My Favorite: My favorite plate is the Blackened Chicken Alfredo (extra blackened).  I think the tomatoes and green onions add to the flavor!  Beware, it is a big serving so maybe split with someone else or take the rest to go. Obviously not a very health conscience choice but, yummy! Tropicana: basically a pina colada with strawberries, by far my favorite...maybe typical girl drink. But, great dessert!

The actual server is not bad, but so so slow. Even the hosting is slow, needs more training.  How many people does it take, to take a name when there is no line. And yet there was a wait list (took us 10 minutes to be seated after getting our name taken). Either the business that that bad so they're really understaffed, or someone doesn't care anymore. The last time I went there seemed to be 2 hostess? and maybe 3-4 servers just as servers, not in the bar area. And there plenty of empty tables. It took over 5 minutes to get the server to come over to ask for drinks. Another long while to get the drinks. But that's is still okay waiting time for me. After my order was taken, I find out my ice water was foul. It was really bad water, the tap tasted like the dentist. And it wasn't some faint aftertaste, it was really strong... My brother who was with me didn't believe me until I told him to drink it.  What he said was, ""WOW,"" So I thought maybe I'll get some lemon. Waited more time to get the server's attention and ask for it. Didn't get the lemons for awhile, so when he came around again I just asked for an order of lemonade then. He came with lemonade and said it was on the house, and that there had been complaints about the water and such... The lemonade had the same aftertaste as the water, but it was more bearable. The food probably took 25+ minutes to get to our table. Which is a long time for a sandwich. And guess what... my burger and fries were luke-warm. The fries must have been at least 10 minutes old, and I would know. I love fries and work at a store that sells it.  It was at least 10 minutes old. And my burger was luke-warm but still good. But everything else was pretty disappointing. And I dislike TGIF's onion rings. It's looks like a wet battered onion ring, but whoever fries it... does a really bad job.

We get a big table outside and put a whole bunch of chairs around it. We get great service and hard drinks. We act a fool, get loud and crazy, make friends outside, and have a blast. What more can you ask for? One thing though. I wish I would stop running into people I knew from back in the day here. UGH! Can't people go somewhere else? hahaha... all good though. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=440
Ken C.,"Westminster, CA",0,3,,4.0,10/3/2009,Better than average Friday's.  These guys have happy hour all day Sunday with NFL ticket ... yeah!!! Love football with half price app's.  Karaoke on Tuesday nites outside is a lot of fun and it would be better if they would have happy hour all day on Tuesdays as well.  Happy hour starts at 10PM and the Karaoke starts at 9:00 and that sucks ... wasted hour.

I thought about it for awhile.. what would be the place that would take my yelp review virginity? *snaps fingers* TGI Fridayyyys!!! I know I know, wtf her favorite place is TGIF's?! but to me its not just the food, it's the memories~  Sure the service sucks and I have been tempted to leave a jalepeno as a tip numerous times, but the reason TGI's will always top my list of fav places to eat..is ""the perfect meal."" When I was in high school my friend and I would come here almost on a weekly basis and order the same thing which we named "" the perfect meal"" .. it consisted of the blackened chicken alfredo, jack daniel's sesame chicken strips, a side salad with honey mustard dressing and an extra breadstick so we could each get our own, oh and always always ""can we get some jalepenos please?"" JUST TRY IT. This meal is so good, it will change your life.. k maybe not ur life, but I guarantee it will make your day so much better. Back in the day after this meal we would walk our fat a$$es to Helen grace and get 1 meltaway ( and 1 free chocolate) hahahah  but helen grace isn't there anymore so you'll have to go elsewhere for dessert.. =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=440

Tomas L.,"Norwalk, CA",16,37,2,1.0,8/3/2014,HORRIBLE SERVICE. we get seated and wait for literally 10 minutes before anyone comes to our table. The The male waiter finally comes to take our drink order. We order appetizers. I got the boneless wings and my girlfriend got the mozzarella sticks. I specifically asked for ranch to be delivered with my wings. During this time we got no refills. (Which is very frustrating seems how it was 20 minutes before our food came out). Then the appetizers come out and I don't have ranch and so it takes another 10 minutes to flag down our waiter for ranch!!!!! R U KIDDING ME! So here comes our entrees now and they drop it off and walk away (still no refills). Now we do not have silverware to eat with either! So some lady comes and brings my girlfriends refill ( she has coke ans I have water)...and completely disregards my need for a refill! HORRIBLE SERVICE! I WI BE TELLIng EVERYONE ABOUT THIS PLACE! This is the last dime I spend here!!!!! So we waited an additional 23 minutes for the check (literally counted)..wow. The food was cold and The manager( black shirt and pants) was leaning against the reception stand the whole ti.e instead of helping servers. Will be calling corporate offices.

Eddy T.,"Los Angeles, CA",200,85,22,4.0,7/7/2010,"Being a regular here I have myself a stripes reward card as known as the 'frequent drinker card'. I always find myself asking this question why won't other bars offer competitive hh prices like TGIF and have hh every night at 10pm to close? And on Monday and Tuesdays, half off on all bottles of wine all day. Whose going to beat that? And karaoke and disco nights on Monday/Tuesday. And always cool waiter and waitress.

Daryl D.,"Cerritos, CA",4,8,17,5.0,9/12/2009,"Although we usually like the food here, what I really love is the service.  Everytime we've been here we've been very pleasantly surprised by the staff.  This last time we went was no different.  Our waiter Joe gave great service throughout our meal.  One of my kids really like cherrys and so Joe put about 8 cherrys on top of his smoothy.  When the bill came, he told us there was a special price on one our dishes and gave us a $5 discount on it.  As it turned out, we also had one of those fake coupons (we honestly didn't know it was) and even though it was posted on the front door as being such (which we didn't see, since they opened the door for us), the manager still gave us the Buy 1 Get 1 Free.  Because of our mistake, he decided to give us a free desert up to $8 (which is pretty much all of their fancy stuff). So in the end, we had a great meal, with great service, and got out with a really great price..

Erin N.,"Las Vegas, NV",1593,435,2521,1.0,6/7/2009,"for cinco de mayo they had this really cool deal going on-- it was like ""five cent appetizers with the purchase of a drink"". without having to be convinced any further, my friend and i were already in the car driving down to our local fridays.  as we walked through the door, the hostess just ignored us. we figured that we would just sit at the bar because it was around happy hour, but she didnt even acknowledge us or let us know if we can just sit anywhere. so we politely asked her if we just sit anywere, and she rudely replied back as if were were annoying her. we sat down, and waited. and waited, and waited-- finally a server comes up to our table, we asked him about the cinco de mayo special and he took our order. all seemed well i guess, until some of our food never showed up at our table-- so we told the server to just nevermind some of the food, we just want our check. he brings the check but he charged us for the food we never got. we let him know, and he hands us another check-- except this one is wrong too, he forgot the promotion and didnt charge us correctly because its happy hour-- so we give him back the check again. after the fourth try, we finally had the bill straightened out-- and i finally had my opinion about this TGIF straightened out too.  the worst service & they cant do the math! try another fridays-- like LB town center-- just not this one in cerritos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=440

Megan Y.,"Irvine, CA",21,126,,2.0,3/13/2012,"I really want to give this a better rating, but I just can't. I'm always torn when I go to TGIF because I've never come across really good food. Everything is usually mediocre. Though the sizzling parmesean chicken was actually not bad at all. Our waitress was also pretty awesome for having to take care of party of ~20.  Don't order drop shots from here. I ordered a jager bomb, and they poured the jager right into the red bull before giving it to me. I don't know why  they couldn't give me two glasses to do this shot properly. I was ordering it for the birthday boy, so I had to walk it from the bar back to the table. The reason jager bombs are good is when you drink it  the moment its mixed together. Not that big of a deal, but still annoying.  So what made this rating go down so much was because they flat-out lied. I ordered an all-american mojito, which instead of rum you have bourbon. When they came around with the drinks, they were here's a mojito. No one else at the table had ordered a mojito, so I said something, but I said I ordered an all-american. He was like this is it. I was like, but I didn't order a regular mojito. Regular mojitos are a greenish color, which this one was. Now, to my knowledge bourbon is a brownish color, so shouldn't the drink have been brownish? He kept insisting this was it, and I kept questioning how could it be. He took it back, but a minute later, a different waitress brought ""my"" drink, which I swear was the same one he just took back. She was like, this is the all-american. I asked, is there bourbon in here? She was like yes. I try it, no hint of bourbon at all and bourbon is a pretty distinct taste. I was about to complain, but my friend was like, ""dont worry about it,"" to the waitress. I was a little annoyed at him. He was like, ""they're stingy about their alcohol."" I was like, I would understand if it was weak, but they got the wrong drink! I like mojitos, but if I wanted a regular one then I wouldn't be ready to raise hell about it. Two of my other friends tried it too and confirmed that there was no bourbon. So I guess here at TGIF they think bourbon is clear.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=440

I asked him for menus. another 10 minutes passed by, still no menu. we were watching him the whole time and he was just going to every table (which was fine), talking to his co-workers, and  also watching the game. really, how hard is it to grab a menu and continue on with whatever you're doing? IT WAS NOT EVEN BUSY. so, I had to ask another server for the menu. tim didn't take our orders until we hunted him down which led on to another 15 minutes all because he was busy watching the game. the manager on the floor was not doing his job either!! he sat down with the group next to us. terrible, terrible, terrible... just terrible!! i really love this place for their happy hour but the fact that we were treated like that earlier just pissed me off. idk if it's because it was raining all day or what, but tgif's HR, please do some evaluation on your staff... maybe re-train them?

I put in our name and went to the first come first serve bar area to wait with my kids till they called. After 5 min a hostess came over and told me the seat I was in was reserved and I had to leave I told her this area is first come first serve and she said the booth I was sitting in was for two people and there was four of us. I told her it didn't matter there was no where else for us to sit and we were only sitting there till we were called. I didn't like how we were being treated so I walked out with my kids so mad not wanting to make a scene with my kids I told the hostess to cross off my name party of 9.

Pattie K.,"Los Angeles, CA",107,75,39,1.0,8/3/2009,"So, I really don't expect a whole lot from a Friday's.  But I guess the one in Compton has spoiled me so I expect the service and the food to be at least that good now. I have met friends and my hubby there for lunch 3 times in the past couple of  months.  The first time they got the order wrong on my friend's salad. For gosh sakes how do you get a salad order wrong?  But I chalked it up to new waitress or new cook. The next time I met Hubby there, they were remodeling.  They seated us right away then it took quite a while for them to take out order. I veered off my normal order and got some kind of pasta.  I couldn't even eat it, it tasted so bad.  But I sucked it up and wrote it off to me being picky.  I have their promotional ""Stripes"" card, but their machine was broken.  I thought fine, they're re-modeling, cut them some slack. Last time (and I mean really the last time for this TGIF*ed me over), I was seated and ordered drinks for all three in my party.  The other 2 showed up with in 10 minutes, maybe less, it was just after she set the drinks on the table.  Then we waited.  And Waited.  After 10 minutes of not seeing the waitress, we went up to the host/hostesses and asked if they could find her for us, we waited an ADDITIONAL 10 minutes with no one else checking on us.  She finally brought the table next to us their food and we let her know we were ready to order, she actually said, ""Just give me a sec."" and disappeared for another 3 minutes!  I was ready to go, but my friends didn't want fast food.  So we gave our order, the food was even worse than last time and the Stripes Card machine was still not working!  When we asked for a manager, we were told he was too busy could we wait about 5 minutes?  UNBELIEVABLE! On an up-note, Hubby and I just ate at the one in the Compton Gateway Center and the waitress was great, the food actually tasted like food and we were in and out in a reasonable amount of time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cerritos?start=440
