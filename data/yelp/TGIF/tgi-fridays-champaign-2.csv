Marshall H.,"Champaign, IL",34,10,2,1.0,7/25/2017,"This was my second visit to this restaurant with NO SERVICE.  The 1st visit I waited about 10-15 minutes with NO GREETING I left.  The 2nd visit, I waited , Bartender comes over, asks for my drink I say unsw IT, she leaves, comes back walks past me goes to the bar, says nothing to me, serves a 23oz beer to a customer, (svr was seated next to them), Another serve comes to the service bar, whistles at BT, she says wait, im still waiting (im on lunch so I am on a time crunch).  She prepares to serve him, I get up, say ""Thanks, but No Thanks.)  I tell the hostess , this is the 2nd time, and a complete failure.  I call guest relations, and let them no my disatisfaction, they say they will email me a $25 gift card (have yet to receive that) and I would here from the GM or the Rm, (have yet to hear from them).

Michaela K.,"Champaign, IL",108,54,8,2.0,5/21/2017,Just received delivery from here. My boyfriend ordered nachos for 10.99 and there were maybe 7 chips that came with the order. I ordered soup of the day and asked for tomato basil because there were two options. I asked for a breadstick and they could charge me for it. I also ordered a Ceaser salad and it said that the salad came with a breadstick. When I received the meal there was tomato soup and a Ceaser salad and then the small order of nachos. The only reason they get 2 stars is because I liked their soup and luckily I had a breadstick from another restaurant that I had left orders from. I will definitely not be a returning customer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-champaign-2
Dawn K.,"Urbana, IL",0,8,1,1.0,8/6/2017,"Been eating here fairly regularly over the past 2 years. Increasingly getting worse service, longer wait times, poor server and bartender  attitudes.  Last Friday night, I  met a friend here for Endless apps and some drinks. Poor greeting at the door, waited a long time to  order a cocktail.  Waited a long time to order. Ordered 2 apps at once to help out the kitchen?  Got the 1st, and a beer. Then a cocktail.  Ordered 3rd app and got it. Ordered another cocktail and asked about the missing apps. Nada. No food, no cocktail.  Got a bill, though. I guess it's endless when they stop waiting on you.  Everything was on the bill, we just didn't get OUR orders. We asked for no jalapeños.  We got jalapeños.  And meatballs that we didn't order.

I've always had an issue with the service at this particular TGI. The hosts aren't the most friendly, service is ALWAYS slow. Don't expect refills. They're often understaffed.

The waitress asked if we wanted our apps as an appetizer and if ee did it would bump the rest of the tables food. I guess the cook can't  fire apps and entrees at the same time?

The food was ""TGI Fridays quality,"" which is fine, but it certainly is not 5 star quality.  There is nothing to really add about the food.   But,  what stands out to me was the restaurant's ability to provide the appropriate seating, staffing, and handle our orders.   4 Stars for the great service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-champaign-2

It's not a bad restaurant/bar, it's just uninspired. I will say that this TGI Friday's makes very good drinks. My sister orders some sort of Grey Goose peach cocktail and it's always tasty. The food is again not amazing and usually overpriced for what is essentially meat and potatoes. Even as I type this I added a star for the drinks and the nice servers.

Matthew M.,"Fayetteville, NC",24,113,148,2.0,8/7/2014,"This TGI Friday's is not the greatest.  I sat at the bar, which almost wraps all the way around.  This seems to be a common down fall of TGI Friday's.  They have too big of a bar area and never enough servers /bartenders.  You can go neglected at the bar for quite a while.   The food is mediocre. I was hungry after a long day of travel,  so I ordered the Jack Daniel's steak with lobster tail.  The steak was cooked well and tasted ok,  but would not recommend the Jack Daniel's sirloin.  Is only cooked with that BBQ sauce and some on the side.  It's not worth the extra price.  Get the regular sirloin and maybe ask if you can get that BBQ sauce on the side.   Also,  do not get the lobster tail.  It was ridiculously small.  It had two bites of meat in it and they didn't even serve with melted butter.  NOT WORTH IT.  The macaroni and cheese was pretty good and works for a side.  The ""fresh"" broccoli was fresh out of the refrigerator.  It was still cold,  not cooked well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-champaign-2

My sliders was bland. The chicken  strawberry salad was way over dressed and the chicken was overcooked. The mixed drink Diddy on the Beach had no pineapple which was in the the posted advertisement ,when asked the waitress said they didn't have any. The parking lot had trash and a dirty diaper on it.

The decor is very nice and chic.  another thing I noticed was that it is not really loud inside like the old location.  At the old one I would have to yell in order to be heard.  it is all open and looks nothing like the Chevy's that used to be here. We ordered appetizers.  Some kind of chicken Asian skewers and loaded potato chips.  I loved the skewers.  They were made with cilantro and I love cilantro.  The Asian Cole slaw that came with the skewers was really good too. The loaded potatoes were OK.  My friend liked them.  I probably would not order them again but she would.

It arrived WELL-DONE. So it went back and was cooked properly the second try.

Sean F.,"Urbana, IL",225,73,76,4.0,7/12/2014,"My memories of Fridays center around suspenders and buttons, and forgettable food. I stopped going to Fridays years ago for lack of interest, boring food, and excessive prices. I've not wanted to party like it's 1989 for some time.  Well, I gave Fridays another shot, and I've not been disappointed. I went earlier this month. And it was so good that I returned a second time this month.  I have actually been impressed twice. The food was really great the first time. The service was really great this time. The manager immediately took care of a minor glitch on our latest visit.  I have to hand it to them. They really have moved past the era of the red and white stripes, ugly suspenders, and over the top buttons Their menu is better than it has ever been. All six people in my household want to go here, and that's saying something. I might even make it a threepeat this month.

As for the service, they were very busy for a Friday night.  But with so many tables, my wife, 2-year-old son and I were seated within 10 minutes of check-in.  The hostesses were very friendly and even talked to my son.  Our waitress was very friendly and checked up on us regularly.  However, other waitresses did seem frazzled and lost.  We had one stop by our table to ask to see the kids' menu. Our appetizer (chips and salsa) came out quickly with very fresh chips.  Shortly after the chips were gone, our food arrived and was very good.  My only complaint is my steak (ordered medium-rare) was slightly overdone but not to the point requiring it to be sent back. Overall, it was a great experience and we'll return soon.  Now they need to bring back the fried mac 'n cheese  and cherry limeade slushes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-champaign-2?start=40
Clydette W.,"Fisher, IL",7,28,19,1.0,3/13/2013,"Slow slow slow!!  There was four in our party and we were told the wait would be 40-50 minutes to be seated even though there were many empty tables. We told them we'd take any table, even in the bar area.  We were seated at a bar table in about 25 minutes.  Our waiter was very nice but not very organized.  It took over 10 minutes to get our drink order and another 10 minutes after that for him to take our food order.  One of the drinks had a long black hair in the glass so we had to send back.  Gross.  Our food came fairly quickly, however we were missing part of one order.  We notified the waiter and also asked for more napkins.  Neither the rest of the order nor napkins ever came.  There's no excuse for that.   The waiter also never came back after that to check on us. This was not a good experience and I probably won't go back.  I had high hopes when it was opened but sadly does not live up to expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-champaign-2?start=40
C L.,"Urbana, IL",0,5,,1.0,12/31/2012,"My friends and I visited this Fridays location around five thirty on 12/30/2012. This was perhaps one of the single most wretched dining experiences I have ever had.  I had been initially impressed by the renovation of the building, it looked quite nice inside. However, it  soon became clear that the staff was very very poorly trained. The waitress, though terribly sweet seemed lost in the menu. It took ages for the first wave of food to arrive at the table, and the kitchen sent out one entree ten minutes before the rest. Forcing one friend to either eat cold food, or eat before the rest of us. When the bulk of the food did finally arrive,  it turned out that the kitchen had forgotten to prepare two of the entrees. The traumatized seeming waitress apologized and scurried off to try and get the kitchen to prepare the rest of the food.  Flash forward twenty minutes later, and she brings *one* more entree to my friend and says ""OK! Have a nice meal""  It was at this point that we all realized that she has no idea that I had also still not received my meal.  She acted surprised, and then tried to act as if I hadn't actually ordered anything. Then when she reviewed her ticket she came to the realization that she had simply forgotten mine altogether. At this point, everyone else was finished with their food, and I was starving and exceedingly cranky.  She went back to the kitchen (Which is exposed to the dining area so everything they are doing at the food window can be seen. Especially when they are dramatically talking about a table that they are unhappy with) and waved her arms about angrily to the female manager in the pink sweater. About ten minute later the waitress finally produced my tepid food, slapped hastily onto a plate. Starving, I didn't bother to point out that they had not included one of my sides, but did ask to speak to the manager. This manager was in no way shape or form prepared to handle an upset customer. She arrived at the table combative and rude. The way to handle a customer who is rightfully upset with their treatment is not to then embarrass them for complaining and still not comp their meal or even bother to offer any sort of *genuine* apology.  Pink sweater manager on duty. Please report to corporate for proper training on how to both run your restaurant, and deal with the unhappy patrons you have tortured. I paid for my meal, and tipped the waitress twenty percent, as it was not her fault that the manager had not correctly trained her. However, I would suggest avoiding this location at all cost until it  receives further training intervention on the management level from corporate. Had the manager been polite, and handled the situation properly, this review would have been unnecessary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-champaign-2?start=40
