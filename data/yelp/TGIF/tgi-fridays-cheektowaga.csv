Sparkle P.,"Clarence, NY",14,40,40,1.0,7/18/2015,"Did I have to give 1 star...I wish there was a scale to place a negative in front of it... I don't really care for chains ..and had forgotten why this particular location was one I would AVOID patronizing. ..UNTIL... I stopped in the other day as we were out shopping and it was later than expected. .went in and my adult daughter said ""we haven't been here in YEARS"" We were seated near the bar, I advised him about my Give me more stripes and a 20% off coupon and if it would be able to be applied and he said ""yes, why not"" I had my kids and mother we decided to try the 2 for $16, I again advised the waiter we were using a coupon he said ""No problem"" , We ordered and got our appetizers Flatbread and Pot Stickers ... They were all COLD ...the waiter came and advised he would fix the problem. ..he returned the same food and had ""heated"" it up ...which in turn made the Flatbread Hard and the Pot Stickers hard to bite.  But by then the entrees were coming out.  Our waiter apparently smoked because the cigarette stench was all over our table EVERY TIME he brought something to the table or took something... When he brought the check it was $79.++ When I gave him my coupon he said ""That wouldn't qualify"" I then gave him another code that was emailed to me and he said ""Nope, no discount"" I asked if he could ask the manager and he said ""it isn't necessary"" I advised him that BEFORE ordering he said I could ...he said ""WELL YOU CAN'T ""  In an effort to avoid a problem I paid them bill BUT I will NEVER patronize the establishment again !! The check came after",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cheektowaga?start=20
Snappy E.,"East Amherst, NY",0,18,,1.0,12/28/2016,"Walked in to a half empty restaurant, still had to wait 20 minutes for a table. Obviously not enough servers working. Sat at bar though with 3 people working behind the bar still had to wait 10 minutes to get served.  No idea why I just didn't walk out, I should have.  Food was nothing of note, in fact my wife ordered her entry with no onions. The server must have heard double onions, of course she complained. To her credit the server did offer to have the kitchen fire another but by then we had waited a long time. Do yourself a favor and go someplace else.  Definitely NOT worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cheektowaga?start=20
Andy B.,"Depew, NY",3,1,,1.0,12/12/2015,Might be the worst and most over priced place in all of WNY. There is no quality to there food and its double the price.

James S.,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",5,8,4,3.0,6/27/2014,"First visit to Friday's since they've re-done the menu. Menu is now a fancy book with paper pages. Food was good quality but disappointing in places. They've reduced portion size on some dishes. The pretzel dish with beer-cheese dip now has about 50% less cheese than before which was a big let down as its a personal favourite They've added a few new cocktails, including shakers which were a nice addition to the menu. The service was excellent however, and made up for the issues with food. When we mentioned about the reduced size of the dip and second dip was brought out on the house. A good place to visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cheektowaga?start=20
Harrold R.,"Buffalo, NY",88,31,49,1.0,3/12/2016,"I don't think, in all the times I have gone here, was I ever treated as rudely and heard racist statements against my wife and I until this evening.  We sat for 27 minutes waiting for our apps before deciding enough was enough.  Not once did the waitress even stop by to give us updates on the status of our orders.    The night was slow and the 2 tables near us, we had heard as we were preparing to leave, had been issued refunds.  My wife and I don't like to support chain restaurants but always made a concession for here ironically enough for their service...  tonight, not even an apology from the server...  a co-worker of hers walking up behind her and grinding all up on her on the floor...  what a disgrace.  Then the fact that she seemed so unempathetic towards us only to say under her breath a racist remark.    Never ever will I go back here...  NEVER EVER and I'm sure they won't even care...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cheektowaga?start=20
Tiffany A.,"Sheffield Lake, OH",1,11,2,1.0,11/14/2015,The bar stinks horrifically. The smell nearly made me vomit. This place is on its last leg. Restrooms are gross and the food was bad. They microwaved my blackbean burger. The outside perimeter was like tree bark. I wish I had something nice to say.

Nana V.,"Bellingham, WA",2,47,,2.0,7/30/2013,Two stars is me being generous.  The fries were too salty and cold. The drink I ordered was so sweet it burnt my mouth.  The desert chocolate brownie was a thin crust with warm melted ice cream.  My coffee had a bright red lipstick ring on the mug.  But the servers were nice.  It was not worth my money.

Terence M.,"Silver Spring, MD",2,1,1,2.0,10/28/2013,Flight came in late so everything else was closed. Got the French onion soup and Cajun pasta. The soup was syrupy and the bread hard.

Theresa W.,"Buffalo, NY",0,15,,1.0,10/4/2014,"Service was terrible, my son had to go and look for the waitress. The prices were to much for the quality of the food. It took an hour for our food to arrive. I do not recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cheektowaga?start=20
Matt C.,"Depew, NY",2,21,3,2.0,1/3/2014,"I haven't been to this location in forever. Went actually due to someone giving me a gift card.  After being seated, it took a few minutes for the waitress to come around, but it wasn't that bad of a wait. She was nice, which excused the slight wait.  The food is decent, but not something that I have to go back for. I suggest the boneless wings if anything. Menu is a tad bit pricey, but acceptable.  The main problem with this place is that it definitely needs to be cleaned. The menus had food on them, and the booths were equally dirty. The TV in the booth (which is a nice touch, but some of the cable channels come in snowy), was very dirty. Looked as if no one cleaned them for a long while. Fingerprints and smears on them. This location definitely needs to step up their cleaning game. Maybe have the hostess that was just standing around doing nothing but watch the bar TV's do something productive?? Just a suggestion I guess..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cheektowaga?start=20
Connie P.,"South Buffalo, Buffalo, NY",34,197,294,3.0,7/30/2017,Usually good service and good food. Service was a bit sketchy.  In the beginning it was hood took our order and received our drinks and apps right away.  But our server was a bit over zealous and was cleaning plates really quick.  Once we were finished with our apps.  Waitress disappeared.  No drink refills no update on our where are food was.  About a half our later our dinner arrived.  And we had to ask for our waitress as she didn't deliver our food so we could have refills.   Our food was excellent as always but my son was missing the jack Daniels sauce and requested it.  He was almost finished his meal by the time it was given to him. Will be back hopefully with better service and a smile.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cheektowaga
Ally B.,"Buffalo, NY",57,49,23,3.0,12/20/2017,Overall better experience then I was expecting for a chain restaurant close to a mall around the holidays. We were seated right away and our waiter Brandon was excellent. The restaurant it self could've used a good cleaning. We ordered two French onion soups that were surprisingly really good (you don't know what chains sometimes). We also split a Mac and cheese burger. The burger was pretty good the fries weren't super great seemed a little cold and needed salt which I normally never add-just very bland. Over all was 34$ for two of us to eat,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cheektowaga

Markeita B.,"Buffalo, NY",13,144,88,2.0,8/11/2017,"A little late with this review as I have been busy enjoying the last few days of summer....last weekend my best friend popped in this TGIF location as we were having a girls nite out , we arrived a little after 6:30 pm happy that we had made it for happy hour and they currently have endless apps well when we got inside the hostess (an older lady) was talking to these 2 guys and she didn't find any urgency in greeting us , seating us  or acknowledging us at all!! Once we were finally seated she never asked us if we wanted a booth or table just took us to a very small round table when I asked if we could have a booth she stated that there was none available , so when out waitress came over she Just wanted to introduced her salt and come back but I objected and told her we needed to order right away because the hostess waited so long to seat us that now it was 5 to 7 and if she came back we would miss the 2 for 1 happy hour deal that was goin on  she understood and let us order after this the rest of our visit was fine but it did make a difference for us ordering had we been seated in a timely manner We both would have ordered at least 2 rounds of drinks verse 1 and our waitress was able to move us to a bigger table !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cheektowaga
Alain H.,"Buffalo, NY",26,4,,1.0,7/1/2017,"At 4p Sat on a holiday weekend the restaurant was nearly empty. I stood at the hostess podium waiting to be seated for over a minute while staff passed by me without any acknowledgement. The hostess finally showed up and then proceeded to take another minute plus, fussing with the menus and consulting her seating chart. I wouldn't have thought that was a difficult task as there were only 3 other occupied tables in the establishment. I sat and waited 12 minutes while 3 servers and the hostess passed by me several times. After 13 minutes waiting without any acknowledgement at all, I got up and walked out. It's no wonder the chain is in financial trouble.  Their customer service sucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cheektowaga
Paulman N.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,7,,1.0,5/25/2017,"Quite honestly the server was great and that was it. As a concept of a restaurant, the food was not only not worth it, but it was miniscule.

Paige C.,"Sanborn, NY",169,102,155,3.0,2/18/2016,"This place really caters to what everyone wants. They started offering a 4-7-6 deal so you could get half sized apps and entrees for half the price. With them being between $-$7.  This was great since I usually share a meal with someone anyways because the portions are crazzzy big. Food is ok. Obviously a chain, so I can't expect the buffalo mom and pop shop taste. Greasy. I shared a burger, picked it up and grease dripped down my hand.

Dennise R.,"Buffalo, NY",101,131,410,3.0,11/21/2014,"I have to say that this place has made a huge 180º. After having a few not-so-memorable experiences eating here I was very happy to see the improvement in food and menu quality... yes I said menu quality. I really like their new menu design look. I especially enjoy their choice of paper stock. My drink of choice for the night was The BFM, which is basically a Cadillac Margarita. It was very good. Since Friday's loves to do their 2-1 drink I decided to have 2. For appetizers I had the Bacon Mac & Cheese bites. I could have eaten 10 of those! But I had to console my self with only two, since I wasn't by myself and I guess Sharing is Caring.. blah, blah, blah.... Anyway, they were 4 delicious little balls of fried mac and cheese with bacon sitting in a plate of cheese and bacon sauce with a piece of fried bacon on top. .....Bacon As my main course I had the Craft Beer-Cheese Burger. I was craving a good burger and this did not disappoint. The burger comes with chipotle mayo but I ordered that on the side because my partner doesn't like mayo and again, sharing is caring so on the side it went. This burger besides having delicious beer-cheese it also had jalapeños and guacamole. It had the perfect kick. Hot but not, OMG my mouth is on fire hot! I also have to make a note about the service. Our server Daniel T. was perfect. Funny and attentive. Bravo Friday's keep up the good work!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cheektowaga
Nate S.,"Cheektowaga, NY",1,59,44,1.0,3/10/2017,"By far the worst experience I have had at a TGI's. Me and my girlfriend came here to order some apps and a few drinks so we sat at the bar. It wasn't too busy either as it was around 8:30-9:00pm. We sat their for almost an hour til we got a manager to complain about Danielle the bar tender. That whole time we sat there we tried to get the attention of this bartender and somehow she managed not to look in our direction the entire time we sat there after we got our initial drink. We then spoke to the manager which somewhat insulted me by offer coupons for free food or whatever. I told him no I didn't want them, I wasn't the guy looking for free food. We ended up going elsewhere for food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cheektowaga

Dave C.,"Tonawanda, NY",0,1,,5.0,7/9/2017,"The experience was fast and efficient, to say the least. Although the server was quick-paced, he treated us well and served promptly. We started with drinks, the long island ultimate iced tea and a corona, and they were both mixed just right, the even combination between sweet and bitter. I had the sizzling chicken and shrimp, and my significant other had the sizzling chicken and cheese, which were both delicious. These dishes were both hot and packed with flavor, and the chicken was moist in both, with the shrimp cooked and juicy with plenty of garlic style mashed potatoes. The combination of fast service, location not being too busy, and food/drink quality gave this experience a 5/5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cheektowaga
Samantha S.,"Huntington, NY",1286,982,738,2.0,1/18/2016,"If you're thinking about it, don't. Stopped in around 10:00 with some friends because it was the only restaurant that was open late on a Sunday other than Applebees. We were seated right away and the place was pretty vacant at this hour with the exception of a few people sitting around the bar. We were seated at a five person table which was odd considering we were four and a four person booth would have made a bit more sense to me. Nevertheless, the seating was fine and our server came over to take drink orders shortly after we were all seated. In all honesty, the service was really sloppy for lack of a better word. From the way he was dressed to his mannerisms, it was unprofessional from start to finish. Yes, Fridays has a casual atmosphere, but his shirt didn't look clean, it was a hanes t-shirt, he didn't stand up straight at the table, it was way way too casual of a demeanor and it was really evident. When I asked about the tuna tartare appetizer and if it was any good, his response was, ""Well I don't eat fish so."" Yeah, well I don't eat foie gras or anything with truffles, but if it's a hot seller (which the menu noted it was) you bet I'm going to tell a guest that it's very popular and then give a little description about the plate, none of that here. We had an array of waters, beers and speciality drinks at the table. My friend ordered a strawberry daiquiri and while it was too sweet for me, she really enjoyed it and was fairly strong. We started with the tuna tartare appetizer, my friends got soup and an ""Apps all around"" where you are able to choose a few different things. He chose the PB&J boneless wings, pot stickers and loaded potato skins (I think.) After our order had been placed for about 7 or 8 minutes, our server stopped by to clarify which kind of wings my friend got and said, ""Hey did you get Buffalo or BBQ wings?"" Well, he got neither, but again everything was so informal, too informal. The tuna tartare wasn't the smartest idea; not sure what I was thinking ordering raw fish at a Fridays. It wasn't bad, it was sliced tuna on top of crispy wontons with some avocado cream sauce and jalapeños, completely edible, just not great. There was too long of a gap in between our tuna appetizer and our entrees, way too long, it's Fridays, everything is frozen, there was no reason for the extended wait time at 10:45 on a Sunday night. My friends thought the boneless peanut butter and jelly wings were interesting, a little odd but that's the reason they chose them in the first place. The rest of their appetizer sampler seemed to be enjoyed for the most part. My boyfriend and I both went with the sizzling chicken and spinach dish which was advertised on the menu as being a ""healthy option"" under 500 calories. The presentation was slightly laughable; the skillet consisted of spinach that was tossed onto the plate haphazardly with a piece of chicken breast smothered in a sauce that tasted like soy sauce and sugar covering a few slices of yellow squash. The side dish was the best part of the meal, grape tomatoes with three teeny balls of mozzarella cheese. I thought that the sauce on the chicken was anything but healthy, and it had a very strange flavor, not enjoyable. The portion was very small and we left hungry. Have to keep in mind that this was a ""healthy option"" so I shouldn't be expecting a large quantity. With that being said, two coors lights, two chicken entrees and a tuna appetizer came to $50. $15 for each entree was FAR too overpriced for the quantity and quality; $9 max for that dish would be much more appropriate. To leave a restaurant hungry, $60 later with tip is a disappointment. Everything from the service to the food was underwhelming. Most likely would not come back here for the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cheektowaga
Mike S.,"Milton, Canada",0,3,1,5.0,6/2/2016,"Visited for lunch with my wife. After reading some of the reviews I was slightly concerned.... needlessly it seems... We were greeted immediately upon arrival and shown our choice of seating. The waitress was very knowledgeable on menu items and assisted with our questions all in a cheerful unrushed way. I had a truffle burger and fries with a tall draft Bud Light. My wife had a California Clubhouse with a salad.  The food arrived quickly, was hot and extremely tasty.  Overall I was impressed with the friendly staff and the quality of the food. I give it 5/5 stars...do give it a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cheektowaga
Jacob M.,"Clarence Center, NY",0,2,,1.0,4/28/2017,"Had to come to this location because the one closer to my house had recently closed. I ordered the Jack Daniels burger, my ""go-to"" from any fridays location. It arrived to the table pretty much already swimming in sauce and the bacon was the consistency of rubber.

It comes sizzling with fresh spinach, roasted yellow squash, grilled balsamic-glazed onions and roasted cremini mushrooms. Paired with fresh tomato mozzarella salad.
