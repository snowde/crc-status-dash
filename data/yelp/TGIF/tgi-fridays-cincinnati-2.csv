Sandra F.,"Cincinnati, OH",366,1347,4660,3.0,11/9/2011,"The only time I come here if I have a gift card or coupon.  The food does not taste all that great.   I do like the jack daniels selection which is their salmon.  But other than that, it's okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-2
Salonee M.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,59,23,3.0,8/11/2012,"Ordinary food, ok service, nothing to write about. Everything I don't like about chain restaurants.  Don't know why I came here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-2
Troy H.,"Cincinnati, OH",95,35,15,3.0,10/18/2011,Service a little slow for a slow night and very small portions for the price. (and I am not a big eater folks),https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-2
Josiah H.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,3,,2.0,9/5/2009,"First of all, Friday's food, in general, isn't great. A small (very very small) step above Applebee's in my mind (which is not saying much, since if it's up to me, I'll never enter an Applebee's again in my life). But I prefer it to Chili's or Texas Roadhouse or others in this tier. While the salad's generally should be avoided, they do a few things well. I love the Turkey Burger -- it's pretty well seasoned and the bun is generally well toasted and the fries are reliable and they've never showed up over-seasoned on my plate. I also like the Thai Chicken Wrap, which has a nice and not-too-spicy peanut sauce that pairs well with the cool, slightly pickled taste of the chicken. My gf generally goes with a burger or the pork chop, which she says vary from serviceable to solid. The ""Right Portion, Right Price"" menu is indeed cheap, but the dishes don't come with any sides and usually aren't quite enough for a dinner meal.  All of that being said...this location's service is AWFUL. I'm a forgiving person. I don't mind slow service when it's busy or when I can see effort being made. But I've only lived in Cincy since June, we've been here three or four times, and each time has been incredibly bad in terms of service (the food has been fine). There's a gentleman waiter, who seems dressed as a line cook, who is friendly enough but doesn't write anything down. That can be cool if you get things right, but he messed up several things (regular instead of diet Coke, bacon on a salad when it was requested to be left off, completely forgetting the appetizer we ordered).  Again, perhaps he was pulled off the line to wait, but that doesn't excuse that many of the same mistakes.  This past Thursday, we came in at 8pm, were seated quickly (there were not more than five tables taken), but it took literally over fifteen minutes before anyone came by (this was the first time I actually considered leaving a restaurant after being seated). When the waitress did show up, she again was friendly enough, but after taking our drink and food order (we were ready for both since we'd waited so long) she didn't show up until she brought the check! Someone else brought out our food, and when we asked her to refill the drinks she seemed surprised and a little put-off but obliged. We took about 45 minutes to eat and chat, and then our waitress made an appearance again with the check, friendly as ever and not explaining her invisibility during our meal. We tipped each one 20%, as is our standard since these people need the money, but I didn't feel right about it. It just seems like there are not high standards held at this location (other Friday's locations I've visited have been fine). So three stars for the food, one for the service, equals two for the Yelp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-2
Eric K.,"Lansing Charter Township, MI",257,2,,1.0,12/3/2011,"Went here with a group of friends this week.  I'm normally very forgiving of wait staff, since I know it's a thankless job, and I almost never send food back.  This experience was just too much, though. I ordered the steak and grilled shrimp, with mashed potatoes and slaw as my two sides.  My partner ordered the salad/breadsticks/soup special (Caesar salad and french onion soup), and a drink.  Other friends ordered burgers, etc. After 45 minutes of waiting (during which my diet coke was refilled with regular coke), the breadsticks came out.  Another table that had walked in 15 minutes after us had already gotten their food. When our food finally came out 15 minutes later, it was lukewarm, as if it had obviously been sitting out for several minutes.  My steak, which I'd ordered medium rare, was raw on the inside in some parts -- I had tried to choke it down, but it just got too red for me to eat, so I sent it back. At this point, a manager was trying to help the waiter for our table.  She brought out new burgers and fries for others, and said my order was on the way.  After yet another 20 minutes, she came back and apologized that she'd forgotten to put my order in, but that she had now, and asked if I would like it boxed up.  I told her to forget about it at this point. The waiter came out anyway, with my boxed up food.  When I got home, I realized that they'd forgotten my slaw.  At least they gave that to us for free, although they still charged us for the drinks.  I appreciate that they sort of tried to make things right, but the service seemed so incompetent that I don't see myself going here again anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-2
