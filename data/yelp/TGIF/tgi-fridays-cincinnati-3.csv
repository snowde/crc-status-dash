Parrish D.,"Cincinnati, OH",32,33,43,4.0,11/6/2015,Friday night at T.G.I.Friday's... the waiter is cool and the food is slamming. Jack Daniels Chicken and Shrimp is the main dish and BBQ Flatbread was the appetizer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=20
Brian G.,"Burgaw, NC",0,3,,1.0,6/21/2016,Overall bad experience from beginning to end for my family.  I am big fan of TGI Fridays but won't be at this one again.  Service was overbearing and rude.  When I think of TGI Fridays I think of their great specials and didn't have any on Monday when we asked.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=20
Krysten H.,"Cincinnati, OH",82,2,,1.0,5/15/2016,"Last night was the second time I had been there in probably a month, and both times the service was terrible. Our waitress the first time, can't recall her name, left me without a drink for almost 20 minutes. She came back to apologize and told me that my drink wouldn't be on the bill. And sure enough it was, the waitress didn't bring our food out, check on our food. As a server, I know the correct way to treat guests and she didn't know how to at all! Last night was the same story, our server forgot to grab both beers from the bar. Waited 20 minutes each time, ended up canceling the second beer because we were ready to go.

Chris F.,"Lawrenceburg, IN",0,1,,1.0,3/17/2016,My wife and I stopped by for a dinner and ended up with food poison the next day. I ordered the shrimp and ribs which they forgot to bring me the scrimp. I believe the food poisoning was due to the broccoli which tasted old and very rubbery. Never will go there again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=20
Cinnamon P.,"Downtown, Cincinnati, OH",10,34,77,4.0,1/14/2016,"I had a really great experience at this location.  The food was delicious, the service was great and the order was timely.   My work team ate here for lunch and the restaurant kept us on time and prepared a great meal.  Try the appetizer sampler and the Sedona black bean burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=20
Lauren D.,"Midland, OH",96,55,144,2.0,10/17/2014,"We stopped in here for a few drinks and appetizers because we remember seeing the unlimited apps commercial on tv. However the apps aren't as unlimited as we thought or all that great. They have a certain selection of apps to choose from (which is pretty understandable) the part that I didn't really like is once you pick one you have to stick with it you can't change it up even tho they are all the same price. Also the are ""unshareable"" unless everyone at your table gets an unlimited app. I got the spicy chicken tostada which was decent but nothing to go back for and J got the sriracha load potato skins which neither of us were fond of. The chicken had a weird taste to it, it wasn't spicy, and it was practically all potato.  However I did find a good gluten free beer while we were there called omission that would probably be the only thing I get again. The fantastic service we received and the beer were the only high lights of Friday's. I don't plan on going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=20

Cassidy H.,"Covington, KY",31,14,18,1.0,12/28/2015,"We stopped here for lunch today before shopping. We were hesitate based of the other terrible reviews. We probably should have just ate at the mall food court. We were sat at a dirty table, that we had to request to be cleaned. With two small children, we ordered soup, prior to the meal. Our waitress put it all in together. With apps. So we cancelled the soup. Everything just took way too long and was cold when it arrived! They were not even busy, on a Monday at lunch. Def will not be back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=20
William K.,"Cincinnati, OH",11,158,36,3.0,7/16/2014,Cookie cutter corporate fair.  The food is good but there are two things that make this place stand out from the crowd:  Brian and Michelle.  Fantastic bartenders!  Real pros that know how to mix a drink and serve food when the bar is full.  Always professional and personable.  You never walk away just feeling like another patron but like you've got a real friend behind the bar.  They are one of my all time favorite bartending tandems and they work together on Tuesdays here.  Any drink you order will be made the right way the first time every time. My favorite meals here are the sizzling chicken and cheese and the chicken and shrimp cajun pasta.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=20
Bob D.,"Cincinnati, OH",22,138,140,2.0,2/28/2015,"Same as all of the other locations, this place has gone down hill for me. Not a huge fan of the chain paces like this but it was my favorite on in the category for a long time. The service has been declining and the prices have been going up for some time. On a positive note the onion soup has stayed the same and is always good. I think a lot of the issues came on back when they did all of the renovations. Also if you are expecting to get what the picture on the menu looks like think again, food staging at its finest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=20
Brandi B.,"Cincinnati, OH",37,3,29,4.0,6/14/2014,Make sure you go on Tuesdays to see Brian the bartender.  Great spirit great hospitality sleays remember his favorite pattons specialties. He rocks.

Denise M.,"Cincinnati, OH",66,12,49,2.0,11/8/2014,"Hmmmm. Well, my second visit in the past month & half. What brought me back you ask. The salad of course. What will bring me back again now that's the question. Upon entering there were several people waiting. I walked up to the hostess. Who I might add never actually acknowledged me standing there. She finally said there would be a ten minute wait. Which ended up being more like twenty. I ordered the pecan crusted salad, again. The service was mediocre at best. Two stars is all I can give. Heh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=20
Jayne H.,"Cincinnati, OH",3,47,,4.0,3/16/2015,"Finally this TGI Fridays is improving.  We had lunch of beer cheese burger, sweet potatoe fries that we had to pay extra for..... do not understand this, an appetizer of pot stickers and a triple stacked reuben.  Tasty, good and warm.  Waitress was quite good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=20
Marissa M.,"Ashland, OH",22,11,1,1.0,7/30/2014,"Literally sitting here as I write this... My boyfriend and I were seated very pleasantly I might add. We had ample time to figure out what we wanted to eat drink and what we were doing every day for the rest of our lives basically. The waitress took 20 minutes to take our DRINK order then walked away, proceeded to take the booth behind ours drink order. Then walked away. We both had our menus sitting on the edge of the table when she took our drink order. Ridiculous but we adore TGI Fridays. Just not this one",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=20
Lori W.,"Cincinnati, OH",5,8,11,1.0,5/28/2014,"My husband and I came here for lunch on Sunday.  The restaurant was basically empty. We waited about 15 min for the waitress to come and take our drink order. Once we got our drinks they were not refilled but once. I ordered a steak ""medium"" and it was beyond well done. I couldn't even cut it. They took it off my bill for me. They offered to remake it, but it took so long to get our food I wasn't about to wait for another one.   Friday's is one of my favorite restaurants, but I will stick to my local one in CrestView Hills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=20
Willy K.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,21,,1.0,12/15/2015,This place has been going downhill.  Servers don't care how much time till they get to you and deliver their food.  The quality of the food is below average and they have cut down on the size of many appetizers.  Avoid this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=20
Michael L.,"Cincinnati, OH",27,4,4,3.0,8/6/2010,This is the closest Friday's to my house and my girlfriend and I have been a few times. The good thing about this Friday's is there is never a wait. Even on a weekend night you can walk right in. In general the food is consistent. When you are talking about a chain consistency is one of the benefits. Usually you will get decent and consistent food. Tonight we had a bad waiter. He only had 4 tables but couldn't seem to make single stop at our table after our food arrived. We ended up waiting 20 minutes after we were done eating to be able to ask for the bill. Since this is my on really bad experience here I am giving 3 stars. Most Fridays are better and busy. Kenwood is a very busy area and something isn't right when you can always just walk in this Fridays with no line.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=20
Denver L.,"Cincinnati, OH",44,98,13,3.0,2/12/2012,"So a final stop on our night out, this was where we went on the way home. After the freezing experience at MLT, this was a nice closing to the night. Beth and Erin are regulars here so the bartender knew there order before they sat down. Being the driver i just had tea.  There was a little wait for a table, but not to bad, We sat at the bar and had a few empty seats, after 8:30 it really opened up at the bar. I've never eaten at a fridays before but after looking and smelling what crossed my path, this is now of the list to try. I'm kinda anti chain places, but hey I'll try anything once.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=20
Derrick W.,"Lakewood, OH",2,33,5,3.0,11/8/2013,Standard fare. Waitress forgot to put our order in. That kinda sucked but we were in no real hurry. No harm no foul I suppose.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=40
Amber B.,"Cincinnati, OH",6,1,,1.0,4/27/2012,"Normally we don't eat at Friday's, but we had a few gift cards, so we decided to use them tonight.  Bad Move!  I haven't eaten at Friday's in a while, but the food has gotten terrible.  Everything had the same taste, way too much bacon and fried onions.  We had the pretzel appetizer with cheese...the cheese had more bacon than cheese ( gross!), which we didn't even think bacon was a part of the cheese.  I couldn't even finish eating the jack daniels chicken sandwich and my boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich, both of which were a soggy mess! Needless to say our stomachs hurt and we are regretting going for the free dinner tonight!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=40
Michael S.,"Tampa, FL",3,55,,3.0,6/20/2013,"The food here isn't really that great, but it's so close to our house that we go anyway. Don't get the burgers, they are awful. Go for the chicken instead. The service, on the other hand, has always been fantastic. I hate going to a place and having to spend any amount of time dealing with bad service, so I enjoy coming here, where I can always expect people to be friendly and competent. The rotating tap at the bar is pretty solid and I think they go out of their way to find some decent craft beers to offer. In the past I've had Stone IPA, Bell's Oberon, Bell's Two-Hearted, and Great Lakes Christmas Ale. The selection is unique to this Friday's and is better than I would expect from a chain restaurant.  This is an acceptable place to go have a beer and a sandwich. Very middle-of-the-road, but you're unlikely to have an awkward and unenjoyable experience there. You'll probably have a decent time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=40
Benjamin W.,"Hamilton, OH",55,180,13,4.0,4/22/2013,"TGI Friday's is pretty standard wherever you go. What differs is the servers. We dropped in spontaneously at this location for a late dinner one night, and we were reasonably happy with our service. It was a slow night for them apparently, so service had the opportunity to be top notch. We had no complaint with our food - the food was properly prepared, tasty, and fast. No real complaint with the server either - it just was not an outstanding experience. I will return to this location in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=40
Kevin C.,"Fullerton, CA",21,21,2,2.0,3/5/2012,"Been coming here with coworkers for a couple of months now, and it seems their endless lunch special keeps getting more stingy every time. First, they cut back some of the soups and salads offered (making you pay an extra $1 for the good ones), then they stopped including the soft drink. All we want is a good, simple, cheap lunch - nothing more. Now, it's nothing but cheap!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=40
Alan R.,"Glenview, IL",187,640,131,1.0,11/23/2006,"I wouldn't normally review a restaurant like Friday's, but our experience was so awful I felt compelled.  Where do I begin? My mother-in-law's friend had her dinner come after everyone else's, another friend ordered a steak without seasoning and it came with seasoning, my salad came after my sandwich and my wife ordered a slushy that never came.  If that wasn't bad enough, the brisket sandwich that I ordered came extremely dry. The fact that they comped the entire bill (for about 15 people) would be the only saving grace that I might give this location one more try.  Otherwise, I would never go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3?start=40
Zaria D.,"Cincinnati, OH",56,107,98,4.0,8/30/2017,"I went in for lunch. The hostess appeared to be new and uneasy. She sat me at a wet table. My waitress, Andrea, came and wiped out down while she greeted me. She was very friendly. Since I have the rewards card she immediately ordered my chips and salsa and drink. She then gave me the time needed to place order for meal. I had the sizzling chicken and cheese which is one of my favorites. It came out just as I finished my chips and salsa. The pan was so hot that all the cheese was burnt so just had chicken and potatos. The chicken was good just like the cheese with the meal. I also order the strawberry lemonade. It was not as favorful as I would have liked but I made it work. Also ordered chicken and shrimp cajun pasta to go which was good for the person trying it.  It was a good experience. Andrea was very good with following up and providing good customer service. The food could have been better but overall it was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3
Hailey W.,"Mason, OH",37,18,9,1.0,7/6/2017,It was 40 minutes before close and we tried to call in take out they told us they don't do it this late so we drove to location to eat in. They mostly seemed annoyed it was 20 min before close. They then tell us kitchen closes in 10 minutes and last call is in 20 I order one drink and she comes back 3 minutes later telling me last calls actually now  as well as the kitchen closing this is at 11:45 they close at 12:00. so if I want any other drinks to tell her now. They rushed us and it was very rude and unprofessional. The drink I did order  tasted like syrup and not alcohol the other drink tasted like how sunscreen smells. My boyfriend got a water and they didn't fill it up the whole time we were there.  Then when the check out and out comes a different server. On top all that the manager was walking around is street clothes on her phone.  On top of that are potatoes skins were a joke.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3
Jim H.,"Westerville, OH",26,336,45,3.0,10/6/2016,"While I'm not a big fan of ""chain restaurants"", TGI Fridays is a chain that I do like to patronize since it provides a level of consistency when traveling -- you pretty much always know what to expect.  I particularly like stopping at this Fridays since it's about midway between Columbus, OH and Louisville, KY - a route we travel frequently to visit family. Based on a number of visits to this Fridays, we've found that service is always very good, the restaurant is always very clean and the food is generally good.  On this visit, my wife ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs with breaded shrimp combo and I ordered the Jack Daniels chicken with the crispy shrimp combo.  The ribs, chicken and breaded shrimp with all very good.  The crispy shrimp, on the other hand, were indeed crispy but not all that good.  A little too crispy and a little too skimpy size-wise.  The weather was great and we enjoyed sitting out on the patio. The waiter was very good -- attentive without being intrusive - and we enjoyed the meal. This is a good choice when you looking for a good basic meal with good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3
Jay S.,"Indianapolis, IN",40,70,16,3.0,2/21/2017,"3 stars is generous, I feel. The only thing that brings me back ever is the Jack Daniels sauce for various menu items and the fact that the kiddo loves their chicken strips. I don't expect top notch service when I dine here, but things like refills, checking back, and accuracy are things I do expect. None of those were done when we dined here Monday. I feel like Friday's is one of those chain restaurants that will be shut down sooner than later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3
Tawnia L.,"Cincinnati, OH",27,7,2,1.0,3/5/2017,"This location is a complete and total joke. We arrived at 6:50 for a 7:00 reservation. In fairness I was told that we would be seated closer to 7. This is not an exaggeration when I say that nearly 3/4 of the tables were empty.  At 7:05 i asked when our table would be ready and I was told that it would be another 20-25 minutes. Are you kidding me? Had I been told this 15 minutes earlier I would have left. Clearly bad management! You should be full and turning over every table; that's how you make money. I'm going to guess that TGI Friday's will fall doom just as other ""once upon a time"" popular restaurants are folding.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3

Kerry. D.,"Cincinnati, OH",21,20,4,2.0,8/15/2016,"My wife and I went to Fridays this past weekend. We were seated immediately as it was about 8:30p in the evening. Our server had good timing and took our drink order as well as our food order right away. It took about five minutes to get our beverages and about 15 minutes to get our food.  My Turkey burger was hot and delicious. (Why I gave them 2 stars instead of 1) My wife ordered a salad but it had too much salad dressing on it. No big deal.    I wanted another beverage but our server never came back, nor did any other staff member.  Our server also did show up to ask us how our food was. I know she had a 10 to 12 person table in the restaurant but she totally forgot about us.    We realized that they were very understaffed as tables were not cleaned around us and when we initially entered the restaurant.  We have a feeling that the restaurant is not going to be open much longer since not much is changed at this location in quite a long time. I know that there are several Fridays restaurants in the area that of been closed in the past 12 to 24 months. It would not surprise me if this location were to close soon as well.   I doubt that we will go back to Fridays as it just doesn't seem like the Fridays it used to be.   Sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3

Amy C.,"Cincinnati, OH",261,130,140,2.0,7/16/2015,"The one thing I associate with TGI Friday's are their iconic, delicious potato skins. Not anymore. I'd seen the ""new"" version on commercials and wondered if the taste was as good...um, no. They're dry, freezer-burnt, have a Cheez Whiz like substance on them versus real, gooey, melted cheese & basically are inedible. I cannot understand why the chain would make this switch. The frozen type you can buy at the grocery store & bake at home taste fresher & have a better texture. I sent the ones on our appetizer sampler platter back, in hopes of better, ""fresher"" ones, but they were the same in taste & dry, old texture. We did try the new French onion soup wontons in the app sampler & they had great flavor; however the next week I saw commercials about this new app & they were covered in Swiss cheese. Mine didn't come with cheese at all. My husband loved the wings (also on the sampler) and his chicken skewer/rice dinner. Unfortunately, our appetizer & entrees arrived at the same time with everything lukewarm at best & his dinner without sauce. My French dip sandwich was good, flavorful & the fries well seasoned, though only barely warm. It was annoying to me to have a ton of food at one time & not much was hot, especially when I was really hungry & wanted to pace out what I was eating. This was a second try back at the location after ordering the exact same sandwich a year ago in which it was brought incorrectly to me twice. First with horseradish (can't really scrape that off), then ice cold. My very pregnant, starving friend had completely finished her app & sandwich by the third time I was served my lunch correctly. During this time, the manager came up oblivious after wrong/cold sandwich 2 & attempted to do a super quick, ""Everything's great here, right?"", which in itself isn't looking very proactively to help. Friday's used to be so much more. Such a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-cincinnati-3
