Justin M.,"Watervliet, NY",4,20,5,2.0,11/2/2017,"Been to a couple of Fridays restaurants and this one is by far the slowest service yet so far. Ordered a simple bacon cheese burger with a margarita (part of the happy hour) and a appetizer. The appetizer came out 25 minutes later and my burger which I ordered no tomatoes and rare came to me with very little fries, well done, and with tomatoes. I know this is no Red Robin with the bottomless fries but legit had maybe 20 or so. The house margarita had so much salt on the rim it was almost undrinkable. Second one came back with no salt and it was pretty good for a house margarita. Waitress was nice and no fault to her. The back of the house and bar staff needs to be retrained and or replaced. Just my 2¢.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park
Thomas N.,"Albany, NY",110,64,19,2.0,6/21/2017,"Sure, just a few weeks ago I was defending the hatred of places like TGI Friday's, Applebee's, 99's and Chili's and then I we came here.  On June 16th, 2017, we planned on seeing Wonder Woman at the Regal Clifton Park Stadium 10 & RPX for a 10:00 p.m. showing. Figuring we would want to grab a quick bite to eat, we hit up Friday's at 8:30 p.m.  The waitstaff was pleasant, and attentive at first, but that quickly feigned off, and later excusing that they were set a large party. Many mistakes were made later as well, and blamed on the kitchen.  Our waitress took our drink order, came back in an appropriate amount of time, and asked if we were ready to place our order for food. Out of the three of us, one person ordered an appetizer, the rest went with dinner consisting of chicken fingers, steak & shrimp and their ""Ultimate Cobb Salad"".  The app was brought out swiftly, and unlike the usual rush to get the next course out there was plenty of time for them to finish it, maybe this should have been our first clue. It took forever for her to come back and ask if we wanted any refills of beverages both alcoholic and non. And when they were brought, one of them was forgotten (the soda). She appeared again and said that they had misfired/read the Cobb Salad order and drenched the grilled chicken in BBQ sauce and was remaking it. She asked if I would like the salad, and then she would bring out the chicken when it was done, I said no as we are headed to the movies, and she said she would go get it now. Was it being redone or not? I couldn't WAIT to see what was coming my way.  The chicken fingers were what you would expected, the steak was done to the liking of my friend, however the add on shrimp were not brought with the meal, and she needed to be reminded, and the cobb salad was good, but the chicken portion was small. We went through our meal, and it seemed that she had disappeared once again, and we were starting to get concerned that we would not be able to make the movie (theater is 2 minutes away). When we were able to spy her walking by, (stating she had a large party as stated before), we asked for the check, and she said she could split it three ways. Well, TGI Friday's idea of splitting a check three ways is not everyone else's way. There was one check, but breaking down the order in three parts (making it difficult for three people paying with three credit cards). We figured it out by labeling the orders with the last four of our cards, and she was able to complete the transaction, however that also screwed the two of us out of any rewards points that would have been available.  So, after defending TGI Friday's I was let down, I guess it depends on the location you visit. I highly recommend the one in Stuyvesant Plaza in Albany, the customer service/kitchen is much more organized there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park
Kristen D.,"Boston, MA",60,127,62,1.0,2/26/2017,"I guess the only thing from here that was good was that we were seated in a booth. I really love a booth. I also really love attentive waitstaff and fried food, and both were lacking at this location of Fridays for a late lunch on a Saturday. My brother, mom and I stopped in here for a quick bite to eat while in the area and I wish we chose something different. The place seemed pretty dead, so we were promptly seated (outside the kitchen door, but still a booth), and we sat. And sat. And sat. Finally a waitress came over to take drink orders but we were ready to order meals by then, too. I went with chicken tenders and fries - how could that be bad, right? My brother got sizzling chicken and shrimp, and my mom got some mahi sandwich (was wrapped in naan) with a side salad. The winning dish: the side salad that came with mom's sandwich, because of the dressing (some kind of avocado thing). Chicken tenders contained no chicken, just fried batter. Fries were okay. My brother's chicken was full of chewy/stringy tendon pieces..? And shrimp were tiny and not many of them at all. The waitress also never came back to check on us or to refill our drinks, until we were ready for the check. Safe to say I am not in any hurry to come back for a sit down meal at Fridays. At best, this would be a good option for drinks and apps at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park
Matthew D.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,2,,1.0,8/3/2016,"Worst TGIF my family has ever been to. Took over an hour for the appetizers to come and they didn't even bring one of our meals. The food was cold and the waiter only came twice. Would not recommend for anyone unless you are willing to wait 3+ hours. Created an account just to post a review of this ""restaurant"". Save your time and money and go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park
Jason L.,"Mountain Top, PA",85,280,69,1.0,7/8/2015,"This is, hands down, the worst TGI Friday's service experience I've had in the country. That's not to say that the server went out of his way to do anything bad....he just didn't go out of his way  to do anything at all. My wife and I spent almost two hours at noon on a Saturday at this TGI Friday's location. Two hours for an appetizer (came out after about 50 minutes or so) and our main courses, a salad(!!) and a chicken sandwich. The place had about 5 other occupied tables at the time. The appetizer, the tostado nachos, seemed flimsy and poorly constructed by TGI Friday's standards and a result of which was a few parts of it ending up on my lap and the floor. Thank goodness for napkins!  Speaking of napkins, I asked our server for more. 20 minutes later, he came back with one. One more napkin. I know there's been a shortage of bacon...and eggs....and a few other things lately, but I didn't realize NAPKINS were a part of that, as well. Our entrees arrived about 15 minutes after we finished the appetizer. Once I realized that multitasking wasn't our server's strong-suit, I decided to forego another soda and just grab one at my next destination. The entrees were sub-standard (again, for TGI Friday's standards.)  With so many chain restaurant options available in the Clifton Park, NY area, please do yourself (and this waiter) a favor....go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park

Cee J.,"Albany, NY",164,53,15,2.0,5/19/2014,"I usually really enjoy Fridays but today my friend & I went in & we sat there for 20 minutes before she had to get up & ask for a server. Our server came over & he did get our food quick. But I ordered a chicken Cobb salad. C'mon nothing complicated. But it was soo bad. The tomatoes were gross, chicken was nasty, the ranch dressing tasted watered down. No good.  They never sent a manager or anyone over to apologize. I don't think they care about their customers. Idk how long before I go back there... :-/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park
Robbie M.,"Raymore, MO",3,116,35,2.0,1/17/2014,"As a change of pace I ate at the bar this time vice sitting at a table. This was also my first time taking advantage of their half prize appetizers which they do on Wednesdays. Frankly, this is how their apps should be priced, and this is where they really make their money since the margins on entrees are smaller. Once again, the food was fine, but the service kinda sucked. I thought maybe the bartenders, Sarah and Carol, were having an ""off"" night, but they seemed to be more interested in conversing with the regulars instead of serving everyone equally as a customer service-oriented person should. I definitely wouldn't consider myself a regular here since it's the fifth time I've eaten here in the 1.5 years I've lived in Clifton Park. What bothered me were the lack of standard procedures that one would expect most servers to follow. When I sat at the bar I was there for several minutes before I got my drink order taken (a single Miller Lite, no other beverages that night), and the bar wasn't busy. Including myself there were eight people, and everyone else appeared to not be in need of anything at the moment since they weren't ordering. Normally, servers will check on you in 5-10 minutes to see if you're ready to order your main food, but neither Sarah nor Carol did that. I had to flag them down to get my order taken. After my food arrived they didn't do the standard courtesy checkup like most servers do to ensure you're enjoying your meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park
Heather L.,"Boston, MA",0,4,,1.0,11/27/2015,If I could give zero stars I would.  The server was great but the food was neither terrible nor excpetional.  Our meals came out and had to be sent back due to over seasoning.  Even though it was a screw up we were only given half an apology and no credit towards our bill.  Will not be coming back to this location again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park
Noe H.,"Clifton Park, NY",0,3,,1.0,6/16/2015,"Even if u like tgif don't go to this Clifton Park NY location. Ordered a burger and it came on a very small cheap bun. Bottom of the bun was basically disintegrated mush. The meat was the bottom of sandwich. Complained and asked if they ran out of buns? Waitress sad no same bun as always. When she brought the burger back on the same kind of bun she apologized ""yes we did run out of buns sorry"". Me too, how could she not have known? Poorly managed location.  Stay clear!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park
Frank Z.,"Gaithersburg, MD",47,339,22,3.0,7/6/2012,"So... yeah... well, it's a TGI Friday's. You're not going to get much here that you can't get at another TGI Friday's, or any other general chain restaurant like this, for that matter. This particular location took some flak a few years ago regarding a snake head that popped up in a dude's salad, which probably turned a lot of people off from this particular TGI Friday's location. I don't know that I believe the guy's claim, and I haven't had a snake head pop up in my food yet, so I'm not really worried about that. But I digress. Yes, it's a standard TGI Friday's. I rank it higher than Ruby Tuesday, which used to be awesome but lost that status long ago. You're not going to get anything amazing here. The Jack Daniel's sauce is OK but overrated (a lot like Jack Daniel's in general). Appetizers are nothing special. Entrees are your standard not-great-but-reasonably-edible chain entrees. Pricing isn't terrible, but is a bit on the high side considering what you get. The one thing I dislike about this place (and other places with this same policy) is their policy on cooking beef. To reference the South Park Ski Instructor guy: If you like your burger rare or medium rare, you're gonna have a bad time. Friday's apparently has a policy against cooking less than medium well (at least this is how it's been explained to me at the TGI Fridays in both Clifton Park and Saratoga). Often times, they won't even advise you of the policy when you order. They'll just cook it medium well and bring it out to you without explanation. It's annoying, although sometimes you luck out and they'll cook it as requested for you. It's not a place that'd be among my first, second, or even third tier of choices, but when the options are limited, TGI Friday's is a decent enough place to go for some drinks and some pretty average food. Don't make the mistake of going to TGI Friday's (this one, or any other one) with high expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park
Nancy A.,"Albany, NY",3,17,,5.0,8/31/2015,"My friend (Miss Sky High Maintenance..lol) and I went here a couple of weeks ago. No wait. The endless appetizers promotion was happening. My friend ordered those and you can order different apps with each refill. I got a special that included an app and entree. I had chips and artichoke dip. The chips tasted very fresh. My friend knocked over the chips accidentally and they helped us clean it up and brought me new chips. They were very polite about it. The waitress was great. The food was fresh. The drinks were ok...as good as restaurant drink is. Tasty, skimping on the alcohol, it's to be expected. I used my stripes points and the next day lost 1121 points, which by the way is the dollar amount I've spent at Friday's, because it had been over a year since I used the stripes account. That's discouraging and obviously if I knew that I would have used them sooner. It definitely has discouraged me from visiting anytime soon, even though my experience was good. There are way too many options of good restaurants and I realized I subconsciously frequented (at another location) because of I was a stripes member and stacked my points. See in my mind if I am ever broke. I have Starbucks, dunkin donuts, subway, and stripes rewards hoarded up the wazoo should I ever go hungry. Let's face it, I can't be both. All in all I prefer this location and had a great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park
Renea P.,"West Linn, OR",27,25,1,1.0,2/7/2015,"Went there today and they had no water! We ordered a diet coke and it tasted like salt and soap combined. After ordering food, I found a piece of hard plastic in my 4 yr olds macaroni and cheese. The waitress was very nice and replaced the meal, but the manager never came over to say anything. The mac and cheese was taken off the bill, but the manager left his waitress out to dry. Will never go back for fear of eating something non-food like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park
JonMichael K.,"Hamburg, NY",0,2,,1.0,7/24/2014,If your looking for horrible bartenders please stop by this Friday's location.  I tried to stop in for a quick lunch and sit at the bar and wow the bartender working the lunch time shift was pitiful.

Debi N.,"Arlington, VA",68,348,147,4.0,3/3/2010,"I stopped here on my way up north. First, most TGI Friday's establishments are similar. Food, decor, whatever. You can't except much. Except this one particular visit made me change my mind. We decided to sit at the bar since we didn't want to wait for a table. The bartender, sorry I forgot his name, was the most courteous attentive fella. I usually come across folk who pretend to be busy, try to avoid you by standing on the other side, or make it seem like it's a hassle to get you your beer. Not this guy, he provided exceptional customer service, kind, and chatty. I ordered a steak (I know a steak from Fridays? Really?) medium rare. Well it came out well done. I wasn't expecting much from this place so it's whatever. However the bartender asked me how our meal was once we gotten our food. I jokingly admitted that the steak was too well done for me. Without me knowing he immediately went to his manager who came over and apologize to me. I was shocked. The manager insisted that they cook me another steak and let me keep the old one which I just gave to my boyfriend. A few minutes later the manager came with my new steak, cooked near to perfection. I mean, as good as it can get at Fridays He made sure I was satisfied and asked if I would like another side dish since my previous dish had gotten cold. Later the bartender came over and insisted we get a complimentary dessert courtesy of the manager. Heck yeah. That brownie obsession is an orgasm in every bite. Too bad I'll probably won't ever come back to Clifton Park, NY. But bravo to you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park
Eugene L.,"Mechanicville, NY",45,208,211,4.0,6/15/2011,"I know what you are saying why is this guy writing a review for a basic change restaurant, I know I am going to get rag on but here goes. Every time I go to Friday's I have never had a bad meal. The wait staff is always pleasant and the food it always hot. Every time I go I order the jack daniels flat iron steak and it comes out the way I like it every time. Their potatoes are always good and vegs are always fresh. So take it the way you will but Friday's is always a solid place to go in my book for some cheap change restaurant food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park
Ryan W.,"Troy, NY",0,39,,4.0,4/19/2011,"TGIs are by far my favorite of the ""casual American"" chains. Snobs everywhere go eeeek, whatever.  The jack daniels flat iron is always tender, beefy, and the sauce is great. I've paid more for worse cuts of meat at dedicated steakhouses...give it a try you might be surprised. One time it came and was kind of tough and fatty, and the manager immediately appeared, got a new one out in minutes(that was perfect), and got us a free dessert in apology. Service has always been great, never been disappointed with the food(I really feel their offerings are a step above typical family chain fare), and they always have some sort of 3-course deal going on.  I always skip the bar which is usually stuffed with obnoxious 30something businessmen yelling at football teams on tv. The decor is the typical cheezy yard sale crap, but I don't go to restaurants to eat the decor.  It's a reliable, consistent place to eat. Fancy night out? Hardly. A surprisingly decent steak for a couple bucks more than a big mac? Winner in my book.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park

Bob D.,"Mayfield, NY",0,14,,2.0,1/23/2012,"2 stars this time, because they can pour a proper Guinness. Now I realize its not a Michelin restaurant, but: If you deep fry the sesame chicken to a dark brown, its usually overcooked. If you forget the other appetizer, ""Oh, would you like me to order it up for you now?"" is usually a no.  Medium rare beef does in fact require a hint of color other than gray. I will say the manager did take the cost of the chicken app off the bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park
David J.,"Schenectady, NY",0,11,,1.0,6/28/2012,"A friend and I were out shopping last evening and stopped in TGI for a burger.  Started with a Sprite and an ice tea.  My Sprite arrived and had to be returned because there was a straw wrapper floating on the top.  Oh yes, that glass was washed.  On return, waitstaff disapperared.  In the glass was nothing more than carbonated water.  Unfortunately, I was thirsty and chose not to make a big deal out of it.  I ordered French Onion soup and a Kansas city burger cooked medium rare.  Seems the only phrase the female wait staff knew was ""sounds good""  and ""that's great"",  French onion soup consisted of beef broth with a cheese topped slice of bread on top.  And without any taste.  It is rare for me to have to salt French onion soup.  The burger that arrived was far from the menu description.  A well done burger topped with bacon and cheese, lettuce and tomato.  No ""chow chow relish"" and with a side of the worst BBQ I have ever tasted.  Ok....ketchup will work.  Sadly the bottle was empty on the table.  Meager amount of fried.  Total disaster.  I got a refill on the Sprite and explained the problem.  Response was ""oh, is the tank out again?""  Refill......CARBONATED WATER.  I left half the burger and half the fries to be trashed.  What a waste of time and  money!  Perhaps it was because we didn't go on a Friday?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park?start=20
Will P.,"Buffalo, NY",92,19,,3.0,3/23/2008,"Friday's is a nice place to go out to eat, especially when they're running their 3 course combo special.  It's an awesome deal.  The thing about this Friday's (and maybe others) is they no longer use the jtech buzzers to alert you when your table is ready.  They give you a number that you have to keep constantly checking a board for, so if you want to go out and lose yourself in a conversation amongst friends, it's very possible to miss your number as the hostesses sometimes won't even call you.  I saw a few people miss their tables because of it. Also, in past 3 months the wait staff has written down the wrong number and assigned it to us twice.  This stopped us from getting a table in any reasonable amount of time and it just really sucks to have that happen because they're not being careful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park?start=20
Raquel G.,"Bronx, NY",62,3,,4.0,9/8/2013,"Service for the most part is wonderful. The hostesses are friendly and wait time for seating is always quick, about 5 minutes or less. The servers are also friendly and even on full nights seating is always good. Even if you get a seat somewhere in the middle you will still feel as if  you have enough  privacy. I would recommend the Fridays shrimp it comes with a side of your choice, I just get the fries; You can also opt for a great combo meal with it that includes an appetizer of your choice. The sauce that comes with the shrimps  is fine, but I prefer Jack Daniels sauce. Per request the server brings unlimited supplies of the sauce at no extra cause. The rest of the meals are great too. I have been going to Fridays since I was a kid, as my meal preferences change and  I find something I especially like, I stick to it for years. I've been having the shrimps for about four years now.  Neither I or anyone I have gone with to this restaurant  had ever a meal that we did not fully enjoyed.

Christine F.,"Clifton Park, NY",27,2,,2.0,4/15/2013,"Went there yesterday for lunch. Have eaten there a few times and never had a bad meal or poor service. However, yesterday we were seated in the bar area which didn't bother us. But the ""waiter"" was also the bartender and seemed inconveiced that we were there. After ordering just a burger and potato skins (with no bacon), our food took quite awhile to come out.  Eventually the food did arrive and the potato skins were very dry and lacked enough cheese on the top.  When we picked apart the potato skins, the potato itself was black in color and very dry.  I asked our ""waiter"" to come over and told him they were not good. His manager came out and said he would figure out what was going on with the potato skins and offered to take them off our bill.  I appreciated it and the offer to get another meal. However, We just wanted to pay our bill and leave. However, our waiter, with no personality, just threw our bill down and seemed annoyed that I had a 20% coupon.  He didn't say anything when I handed him the cash to pay and then returned my cash back less .02 cents. No biggie but I had planned on giving him $4.00 tip (on a $10 meal) but when he just threw the money back on our table and walked away without saying anything or goodbye or thank you or I'm sorry your meal wasn't good.  Very rude. Would think twice before eating there again. Poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton-park?start=20
