Earl G.,"Clifton, NJ",7,102,422,4.0,1/5/2018,"We ate here on New Year's eve. I was surprised that it was not as crowded as I thought it would be. However that said, they were busy enough and the food this visit, because we had visited here several times before, was the best we've had yet!  We had the ribs we had one with the Jack Daniels sauce and the other one without. Both were great but I definitely recommend the Jack Daniels sauce! Our waitress that we had, was excellent. She was very attentive but not intrusive that we enjoyed our meal. In the many places that we've gone to have food this was one of the top five waitresses we had so far!  Our waitress told us about the dinner, appetizer and drink specials, but since we were going home to drink at New Year's we did not indulge in the drink specials.   Based on our past meals here and combined with our latest meal we are giving us four stars, but we may up it to five stars if the service continues as good as it did this latest visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton
Dominga R.,"Sayreville, NJ",0,4,5,1.0,10/1/2017,"The server was very good considering the amount of people in the restaurant  The atmosphere was ok but the TVs were too loud which makes a hard to have a conversation with who ever you are with  Cleanness of the place were pretty good  Food presentation awful, food were cold , stale , taste were not as a expected.  The drinks were pretty good but they should do better  The server at any moment came to us to find out wether we were satisfied with the service  The place is a bit too dark should be a bit more illuminated since is daytime  Overall will not recommend to anyone  There's too many other places you can spend your money and have a better service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton

Hannah V.,"Madison, NJ",113,125,145,3.0,6/8/2017,"Came here for lunch on a Wednesday. It was pretty empty. The lady in the front was nice and we got seated right away. Our waitress was not in a good mood because I saw her arguing maybe a supervisor or something, but she was nice to us. Besides not really smiling, she was polite when she spoke to us. They got my bf's drink wrong but she changed it right away. His mom's drink had practically all ice. She finished the drink in 5 sips. The spinach dip was good. I had the chicken bruschetta pasta which came out good.j",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton

Isaiah C.,"Paterson, NJ",61,7,6,1.0,4/20/2017,"Not my first time coming here. Just so happens that  there were a few issues. There were three of us today. We were seated almost right away. Our server was very nice although she seemed like she may just had a couple cups of coffee. Ordered wings, the lobster and steak and the finally the ribs and shrimp entree with various lemonade drink mixtures.  First issue is that one of my guest asked for wild rice which they didn't have and instead of checking she was given white rice. Wasn't much of a big deal at first. The second issue was the ribs and shrimp entree. I ended up getting just ribs with 2 sides. Upon asking if my ribs came with shrimp I was told they'd be right out. They were brought out 12 minutes 32 seconds later piping hot which I learnt upon attempting to try one. At. this point my meal was pretty much completed. Ended having to let them sit for a while before I could eat them.  Once the check came however I was charged separately for my meal. In the past if a server was going to do this they made sure to inform me. Usually I wouldn't be too bothered but considering that I stated both when I was ordering as well as after my meal came that I was expecting the entree that came with shrimp and not two separate orders I was more than a little upset. As a former server and a business owner anything that affects or changes the bill of the client is usually something you inform them about. Upon questioning about this I was told it's a common mistake and she didn't know which I wanted and that they couldn't do anything about it.  I think that statement in itself contradicts with good customer service. Assuming you have multiple things on the menu your job as a server is to clarify which and common practice to repeat the order. If I order wings you don't guess at which sauce I want it in. Used to be a regular but I might take a break for a while not sure if I'll be back but I work near the area often so we'll see.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton

Nicole S.,"East Orange, NJ",12,3,1,2.0,7/15/2017,"For a day that was not busy, they were really unorganized. The server would take our order and when the items came one thing was always missing. Ordered drink forget one, order entrée forget one.  Ordered a burger medium well, it was still mooing when they brought it to the table.  Waited 7 minutes  then was told it will take another 10 min. I just canceled the order because by time it gets there the rest of the party would have to wait for me to eat.  He still brings out and was like you sure you still don't want it.  Yes I'm sure that why I said to cancel it 10 min ago.  He did try to redeem himself by giving the kids desserts for free.

Stephanie W.,"Hartford, CT",105,14,10,1.0,5/20/2017,"This location used to be my favorite Friday night spot. So of course on a random night when looking for a last minute spot to connect with a friend I suggested this restaurant. The server was kind , event with the strong cigarette smoke permeating from his person, but the service was slow. We both ordered the app combo with wings, potato skins and pot stickers. The wings tasted and appearred  to have been reheated multiple times they were so dry, the skins were overcooked with little yo no cheese... I didnt even bother with the pot stickers. To make it worse, I couldn't even wash it down with my margarita as their was a hair floating in my beverage. I returned the drink and gave up on the food. Such a disappointing experience and a total waste of my funds. Won't make this mistake again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton
Destiny W.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,36,21,3.0,4/20/2017,Food was disgusting. Had the chicken bruschetta pasta. It took us literally about 45 minutes just for the food to come out. Once it came I had about to scoops. It was nasty. I'm honestly not a fan of Friday's food. I've literally tried everything in the menu and nothing ever is tasty to me. Our server was super nice and she gave me a Friday's gift card because I didn't like my food. That was really nice. Also had a drink it was tasty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton
Vienna B.,"Little Falls, NJ",206,7,1,2.0,10/1/2017,"I have been going to this TGI Fridays location for years, and it has always been one of my favorite go-to spots for my friends and I. The wings are a TGI Fridays staple and I usually order them with a meal and they're always good. I visited this location with my boyfriend today, and it was not the best experience. Once seated, we waited for over 20 minutes for a server to come to our table. Eventually a woman came over to our table (She looked like she may have been a manager, I'm not sure) to serve us. She was very nice, but not very attentive. However, I could see that the place was relatively understaffed, and having been a waitress myself for years, I understand the position that she was in (especially if she was a manager stepping in). We waited a very long time for our food to come out, and when we got our food, our wings were less than satisfactory. They were so over cooked that it was hard to even take a bite. A few of the wings were burnt down to the bone. The sauce was fine, but it could barely cover up the taste and texture of burnt, rubbery chicken. The bleu cheese was also quite warm, which indicated that the wings may have been sitting on a hot table for a long time. I'm not sure if I will be coming back to order wings anytime soon, because I can't be certain that they won't be burnt again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton
Reem I.,"Clifton, NJ",9,31,94,1.0,1/3/2016,"Its so rare that I have an aweful experience dining but this was one of them. I'm a frequent visitor of Fridays and I've always been a fan. But recently the service has been so bad. I'm not sure if there has been a change of management/kitchen staff/ wait staff but today's visit was a waste of time and money. The food was stale and underdone, the entrees were served way before the appetizers. When the apps finally came they were cold (soups) and the flat bread was stale.  The steak was more rare than medium well. The portion were dramatically smaller than usual.  The waiter brought my sizzling chicken and shrimp before they put the shrimp & mashes potatoes on it and just have me a plate of chicken. He then had to take it back and I had to wait some more.  And as expected, the receipt was all kinds of messed up. Should've went elsewhere, but at least the family spent time together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton

Barbara W.,"Clifton, NJ",0,5,,2.0,8/4/2017,"So disappointed in this place. Was here last night with two of my friends so we could have a girls night and catch up on life and the service could not have been worse. We sat down by the bar and waited till 10 to order drinks for happy hour, and I decided to get endless apps. I, was more than certain that when I order endless apps, the first thing I'd order would be a regular size portion and there after, whatever I put in to order would be half the size, or at least smaller portions. Fine. I was told to order two endless app dishes, thinking I'd get a whole quesadilla and a regular size portion of boneless bites. Guess what, I sure as hell didn't get that, in fact I got less than half the size portion of each dish I ordered....oh and it took about 25 minutes for the food to come out, so when it did, i take a bite out of my food. It's between cool and lukewarm at best. I was pissed. Both at the portion size and the temperature I got my food, but I kept my mouth shut, dealt with it and ate it. Our server (don't remember her name) was no freaking better. She probably came to check on our table a total of 5 times. Totally unacceptable. Oh and she didn't even clear the empty plates off the table when we finished with the first round of apps. Making us piles plates one on another. Definitely not okay. Our bill came up to $50 and guess what we left a $5 tip. Why? Service and attentiveness. I didn't even feel bad, I used to be a server too where I was paid $1.18 an hour and most times, my checks were void and my only income was tips. Since this was the case, when it came to service, I'd bust my ass to make that tip and make sure I was tipped. But also make sure my tables and the guests were happy with everything. To make sure all was how they wanted it. To make sure their glasses were filled..not half ass a job you don't give a shit about and magically hope that a table would leave you a 18-20% tip on shit service. Doesn't work like that unfortunately. All in all, this specific Friday's has gone to the dump and I won't be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton
Rita I.,"North Bergen, NJ",396,176,2342,3.0,9/15/2014,"Initially came here just to sit by the bar to watch the football games but the bar was packed and all the tables around. Since the games were on the hostess said they wouldn't even know when a table would be available, completely understanding.  For starters I ordered the strawberry lemonade which I highly recommend. (they charge you .75c after for every refill) I also got the clam chowder soup, not that great. It was okay but I would def not order it again.  One thing that really turned me off was their silverware. Water spots all over, looks pretty gross. I opened three other rolled up silverware until I found a decent one.  Again I know this should be expected obviously I'm not at a five star restaurant but at least keep the silverware somewhat decent looking.  For my meal I ordered the rib eye steak & lobster tail, with baked Potatoe and rice as my two sides. I ordered my steak medium well, and after eating my lobster I stared to cut up my steak and in the inside was still pretty pink (Huge turn off) I didn't say anything because it was not bleeding but it def should've been cooked better. I just continued to eat the rest of my food and decided to take the steak to go.  Our waiter was so nice and friendly, if he wouldn't have been so nice I would've prob complained about the silverware and my steak. I never went to be that person but sometimes it ruins your whole dining experience. The baked potatoe, rice and lobster were delicious which honestly I wouldn't expect it. Glad I went with that choice instead of a burger.   I can't say I would never come back, because I will but most likely only to have appetizers and drinks at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton

Loreana D.,"Middletown, NJ",0,14,,2.0,12/18/2015,"Just a tip- walking around the restaurant as a waitress stuffing your face with your hands and then continuing to work is not the best look. As a waitress of 10 years I know we all eat during our shift but please, girl, in front of customers? At least make it a point to wash your hands afterwards. Then she continued to yell at another waitress from across the room. I know my manager would be MORTIFIED if this was his place. The manager ought to spend a day here because he/she clearly doesn't.... The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because that class act of a girl was not our waitress (ours was wonderful) and because our appetizer was delicious; the burger that came without the avocado I ordered, not so much.

My wife and I entered this ""restaurant"" at 10:08pm on a Wed, it was fairly empty but despite the late mid day night lack thereof, the servers were busy staring at the ceiling and trying to figure out how to change the channel on one of the TVs awkwardly placed In the center of the restaurant. After about 15 minutes, a gentlemen came by and took our order. Here's a Madden break down.  Boneless wings: not bad, hard to screw up chicken drenched in sodium sauce and creamy cheese  Wedge salad: too simple to screw up  Flat iron steak: had an awkward aftertaste. Should change the name too awkward after taste steak.  Grilled chicken Cobb: as mediocre as Obamas first term. They didn't have the decency to mix the salad. It looked like someone sampled the salad bar at an old charlie Browns.  Mac and cheese: more like Mac and teeeeeeese.  Sweet potato fries: soggier than a roll of Toilet paper dropped in the toilet.  Dessert: yea ok, check please.  If you do decide to go here, I recc getting plenty of water to wash down the sodium infused high calorie dishes.

Sirloin, small lobster tail plus two sides.  While my husband's steak was good, mine was so chewy and mostly grizzle - it was inedible.    I know we are talking ""chain restaurant special"" but Outback runs the same type of sirloin at the same price that is a much better cut of meat.  The sides were good (I got the rice pilaf and spinach, hubby got Parmesan fries, these are very yummy ) which were good.  Our server Amanda was great,  hard working and professional.    When she came by to see if there was anything else we needed I told her the steak wad not good, she apologized and said she would tell the manager.  She dropped the check off and said the manager would be over, but he/she  never showed.  Oh well.  Fridays has a great loyalty program (Give me more Stripes) that awards points for dollars spent that can redeemed for free entrees and other free food)  They also send alot of coupons via email for Buy one/Get one free entrees.  Sometimes any entree , sometimes a rack of a ribs.  Which is what I am getting next time.  I love Friday's ribs especially the Jack Daniels basted ribs.  These are great.   Stick to what's good is always the best way to go.  Sometimes we get the White chocolate cheesecake for dessert but Hubby was in the mood for Cups so off we went.  Review to follow......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=20

Yuchen Z.,"Alexandria, VA",522,451,2209,3.0,7/29/2014,"TGIF is an alright place. It's one of those places that I can go for lunch but I usually choose not to because there are better places in the area for the same price. We found ourselves here with a party of 30 for their endless appetizers though so here I am after 10 years of not having TGIF.  The price is decorated nicely. the seats are comfy. I think overall the atmosphere is good. We had a group of 30 and that hard for them to fit....it was def. very crowded. They gave us a giant long table against a wall so basically people sitting inside against the wall couldn't get out. We were smart enough to cut the tables into smaller sets so people can slip out in the middle (Idk they didn't do that to start with). We ordered a ton of the appetizers. Lots of different deals. I appreciate their Happy Hour Prices - lots of 1/2 price stuff, endless appetizers for $10, and $1.50 things. Their sliders were good, wings were good with all the different sauces, potato skins were good too. Not a huge fan of the fried string beans (also don't think it's worth the price), or the mozz sticks. I liked the Gold Medalist Smoothie. One problem I have with TGIF is they don't list prices on half of their drinks menu. Like, what? When I asked the wait staff, they were unsure of the exact price and gave me estimates. ..... I don't understand why it's a thing to not list prices on the menu in your restaurant. I know people do it on their online menus but their real ones? Are you trying to tell me it's free? Or trying to trick me into getting something expensive? The wait staff was very nice and friendly. Alex was our waitress and she was really great-flexible with our orders and didn't get frustrated with our large group. They had like 2-3 waiters/waitresses for our entire group. That went well.  TGIF is an alright place. Average. 3 stars are about right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=20

The servers who bring out the food when you order are very nice an friendly.  My only complaint is that they downsized on the Jack Daniels Burger. They now give you half the fries they used to give an the burger seems a little smaller as well. The only thing that hasn't changed about it is the price.

Went here over the past weekend mostly because we hadn't been to this place in a long time and the last time it was pretty decent. As soon as we got in we were offered immediate seating by the bar which would also give us half priced drinks and half priced appetizers so we said why not. A couple minutes after we got seated the waiter arrived and took the order for our drinks and the appetizer. The drinks didn't show up for over 5 minutes and remember we are right by the bar. The appetizer was good enough and after a little while the entrées showed up. The food itself was fine, not bad just nothing to write home about. Then things started to go down hill fast, after waiting for a good couple minutes we were able to get the waiters attention for another drink which also took a minute to get there. When the waiter arrived with it i asked if i could have the remainder of my meal to go.  Guy disappears and doesn't come back until 10 minutes later when we try to get his attention to ask for the check. I ask again to have my food packaged up and he says fine then comes back 5-10 minutes later and drops a Styrofoam container on the table with a bag and the check. Kinda rude but at this point we just wanted to get the hell out of the there when we notice on the check that they charge full price for the drinks and appetizers so after getting this dude again we ask him to explain whats the big deal. He tells us that the offer we given at the door only covered select drinks and appetizers. I shouldn't have to deal with disclaimers when going out to eat damnit. We got the dude to fix the check...which took another unreasonably long period of time and then we had to wait another eternity for him to ring it up.  If it was busy I could kinda understand but there were quite a few empty tables and just a few people at the bar!

Brianne Y.,"Highlands, NJ",76,140,1,1.0,2/7/2011,"Eff you TGI Fridays. After eating at Zinburger (which was really good, by the way) with the hubby and a few friends we decided we wanted a few drinks. So instead of driving to the super depressing Yesterdays, we decided to make the short walk across the parking lot to Fridays. Bad decision. Apparently Fridays thought the UFC fight was a huge deal (nobody sent the memo to me or any of the other customers there). Every tv was tuned to the fight and it was super loud. Too loud to hear the little voices in my head =). The boys got a bucket of beer (a bucket of 5 bottles of beer, not just a big bucket of beer) and I got a glass of wine. It came in a really gross, obviously very dirty glass. Now, I'm not one to return food or drinks in restaurants. I've seen the movie Waiting and I've heard too many horror stories, so I just don't do it. But I couldn't drink out of this glass. So I politely ask for a new glass. The waitress says sure and takes it away. She comes back 2 minutes later with either the same dirty glass or an equally dirty glass. And I mean dirty...the stem (or whatever it's called) was sticky, there was stuff all over the glass and, get ready for it...there was still pink lipstick smudges on the rim. Now cmon, that's gross right?! One of the guys also asked for a glass with his beer and was told that they were all out of clean glasses. 1) what kind of a restaurant runs out of clean glasses? Aren't there enough non-english speakers (is that PC?) in the back to wash the dishes? and 2) it was then ok to give me a dirty wine glass?? I probably should have complained to the manager but I didn't want to make a big deal. And if it was up to me she would have gotten absolutely no tip, but the boys are nicer and gave her one anyway. I will never ever come back to this place. Or I'll have tp bring my own dishes next time. TGI Fridays...I curse you.

Mediocre food, that just happens to taste ok, and it's relatively cheap. My mother and I went there for dinner last night and if it wasn't for other experiences there being better, this review would have been one star. We arrive around 8PM, maybe a little before. We waited at the front desk, stand thingy for about 5 minutes before someone seated us, mind you the place was less than half full.

We order our meals (appetizers and entrees) and it takes about 25 minutes for our apps to come out. Now, I've dined at very high end places in my life and I know that perfection takes time (not that I was expecting perfection at a TGI Fridays, but you know what I mean) but i've still never waited more than 15 minutes for an appetizer (especially one that was probably premade and frozen). FInally the apps get to us. I forgot something in my car so I ran out and came back and my mom tells me that they had brought our entrees out and she sent them back considering we had only had our appetizers for all of 2 minutes. 10 minutes later our entrees come out cold of course. We were going to send them back but it wasn't even worth it. We ate some of our food, gave a pretty crappy tip and left. I can't even say that I won't be back here, because I probably will be.

Felix J.,"Congers, NY",8,54,70,1.0,5/16/2014,"Honestly the worse Fridays I've been too. I Live In New York, and came to this place with my girlfriend to grab a drink. First of all the bartenders are like grabbing each others asses and private parts in front of customers. Second of all there is this one bartender named Sarah she has blonde hair, sounds ditsy.  She got me a drink which was the captains cup which is suppose to be in the Fridays jars. As I got the drink it was in a shot glass which is filled with ice and fruits, with no alcohol. She knew I was annoyed with how the drink was made, and that was 10 bucks what a rip off. So I decided to get a guiness when I got the beer it was somewhat cold and somewhat warm. I don't know about anyone else but a beer should be cold. So I was not pleased with the service. So I paid for the bill which was 25.15 and I gave her 50.15 it took her 10 minutes to give me back my change. The reason was she was too busy flirting with some customer, or she didn't know how much to give back to me. All I know this place sucks I will definitely call corporate on her ass. Avoid Sarah very bad customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=100

Their ribs are to die for! Yummmy!! This is one of our favorite places to go out to grab a casual meal. I usually ask to come here on my birthday.   My only one complaint is that I once ordered the fried shrimp entree and in my opinion I didn't get enough shrimp. I usually wind up taking home leftovers because I'm a small person, but that time I had no leftovers to bring home and later that night I was hungry agian. But that was just that one thing on the menue. Everything else I've had was great and there is usually a lot.  I really like the atmospher too & the classic rock music they play in there.

Server came and asked us if anyone (I.e., the manager) had come by to explain what had happened.  Of course, answer to that was ""no"" and remained that way for the rest of the night. We did get comp'd for a bowl of soup for our inconvenience (and kudos to our server for making that happen). But yet, the manager never came by to apologize on behalf of TGI Friday for the order screw-up... could not spare two minutes of time out of the near two hours we were there to even give us a ""make-good"" line. It left me wondering: If the manager failed to take responsibility for the shortcomings of the staff members responsible for the screw-up, then what else is that same manager failing to take responsibility for in the service granted to the customer base of this establishment by the staff under that manager's watch?

We took my son-in law out for lunch after graduation around 1:30. The place was not busy at all the waitress we had only had 2 tables a 4 top and a 3 top. We had 4 adults and 1 baby in our group. First it took her ( an African american with short hair) 10 minutes to acknowledge us and how does she do it I'm coming what is that suppose to mean? It was 5 minutes after that she came back to the table didn't even tell us her name. We ordered appetizers and soup. I presented a twenty five percent off coupon because I am a stripes member and she said I'll get the information once you put in the whole order. Well our appetizers came (no free chips) and she still hadn't come back to our table to take our order. We were out of drinks and ran out of chips for the spinach dip and ate all the other appetizers before she even came back to take our dinner order. She acted surprise that we had finished our appetizers in the 30 minutes she has been gone so we finally put in our order ask for more chips (never got them) had to ask 3 times for our margarita. Food came my daughters steak was well done not med rare but we didn't dare send it back in fear that it would be another hour. During the time she took our order for appetizers and before she came back to take the order for our meal she walked by us 15 times and never said a word, and when she finally did it was those famous words I'm a coming I should have said yeah when. Then after we finish the dip with our forks she says 45 min later I guess you don't need the chips (really) half way through dinner again we said the margarita finally she brought it not so much frozen anymore.Then to top it off after the 2 hours we spent there the hostess and a waitress was sitting at a table next to the door talking and the waitress was painting her nails not a nice scent when your eating.

P F.,"Montclair, NJ",27,40,,2.0,12/18/2010,"Well...I do understand what they are talking about and I cringe at the idea of my hands being tied when I am with a group of ppl that have no issues with being treated badly for their money and feel forced to eat in this ""particular"" Fridays. First I want to say that my preferable Fridays Restaurant is in Essex green Shopping Center West Orange, New Jersey. When I go there and I do not have a new waiter or waitress I am treated like a Queen!! It all DOES MATTER how you appreciate the hand that butters your bread. Your customers. I DO NOT GET THAT AT THE CLIFTON RT. 3 FRIDAYS. Last night was approx my 5th time there. The 1st 3 being more than 2 1/2 years ago and the service was half decent, and 4th time was approx 6 months ago. About 6 months ago, I entered on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. We were offered seats on their Patio. We thought it would be exciting and it was. It smelled like horse manure and it was filthy and so windy and shaded we wondered why they offered that seating. We ran back inside. Once inside when I ordered their Electric Lemonade special drink..it tasted like a glass of water, literally. The others with me who NEVER want to make waves ( Go ahead and take their money and feed them air, they don't care) also said that my drink was like a glass of ice water. When I said this to the waitress she said that the bartender stated that he measures the drinks and can do nothing about it. I asked if he can make me another with half the ice, and he said no , he has to follow a recipe. I asked for a manager and a woman appeared from the back somewhere and looked as she she just got awakened from a nap off of a cot. Her hair was uncombed, and she looked a little looney. She said that they have a recipe and cannot alter it by adding enough liquor to make it taste as though you have bought an alcoholic tropical drink. She said I could change the drink but they will all be the same. I got very confused about this and left the premises and waited for the dumb ass other people in the car.  Well, last night I returned because it was too late to make it to the vicinity of the other Fridays in West Orange and I was 2 min from this one and wanted some wings and Happy Hour Stuff. They have happy hour in the lounge on Friday nights from 10 pm on. When entering I requested the lounge area and said I wanted some drinks and finger food. I was told I couldn't sit in the lounge booths because I had a teen daughter with me. Fair enough. I forgot to mention that the hostess had a crazy attitude from the door which I ignored, as though the customers were aggravating her for being there. then my teen daughter told me that she is a student in her HS...Okaaayyy!!!  Next she said we couldn't sit in the booths we requested in the regular dining area because someone had to clean them, as though that was a feat that could not be accomplished. I told her that we would wait. We were finally seated and a waiter with a really bad attitude came to serve us. I asked if He can find out from the manager if I could be courtesied the Happy Hour because I was told I couldn't sit in the lounge area due to my daughter being a teen, and I would like some cocktails and bar food. He immediately, nasty and bluntly said ""No, we can't do it"" I said well there is a ""basket of fries"" served in the lounge for $1.50. Can I have that with my wings? He said ""No!! That's just for the bar. NO!!"" Anyhow, I ordered a drink for $8. A Mango Mai Tai cocktail. it tasted like orange Hi-C..No taste or effect of liquor at all. I was almost holding in my question about the taste of the drink because the waiter was so evil. But then I decided to use my people skills from my sales, cust service, and advising careers to turn this joker around and I did. He finally began to open up and smile. he told me that the reason that the drink tasted like that  is because that is how they make it..Ummm Hmmm. Then I said ""That is how you make it???"" He said ""Yes, we are on a tight budget"". I was floored...Enuf said. The food tasted ok though I had to pay double because I wasn't allowed to sit where I desired, and the point that I am trying to make here is that they go by a strict regime whereas they are NOT INTERESTED IN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION within reason at all.  So since they do not value the customer, I really think that this is a very poor way to do business and it will prob be a matter of time before this establishment is shut down. Go at your own risk folks. The food is good, the drinks are literally water or soft drinks at an alcohol price.

For lunch we got the jack daniels grilled chicken sandwich and the triple stack ruben. My wife enjoyed her chicken sandwich and my ruben was okay it was more rye the corned beef but i should have know better being it was a triple stack that it would be more bread but it was still tasty. There are a few places in the area that make a better ruben so i would probably go with something else next visit. Just a question are you guys pre cooking your fries now ?

How I know this, bc I have been regular at this place since so many years.... lost the count. lol;)  Its like any other Food chain restaurant but it has bigger bar area then a normal restaurant/Bar. You have a choice to sit on the bar or if you come with many people then you can grab one of those high table in the corner. Most times there is no wait at the bar area tables...which is the best part of this TGIF- More space less Waite LoL ;).  I am a very picky person when it comes to restaurants and food. Well, I started going to the TGIF one on Rt17 b/c of my friend Brian.K  use to work as a bartender. He is a very sweet guy who is good at making drinks and best customer service. He is very friendly and talkative and customers are always up and enjoying some nice conversation with good food. Also, I go to TGIF on rt 3 b/c its near to group of friends I hangout with.... servers at rt3 TGIF are also very nice and respective. They will suggest good food and drinks to you if needed. Wait staff is very young and anxious.  I went there with few friends on the day of Sandy for dinner. we waited for long time as that place was flooded with people but when we were seated our serve brought food within 10 min. He made us some good delicious food on that cold and rainy night.  First of all, this place is very convenient to everyone as its right off Rt 3 by the small shopping mall in Clifton, NJ. Every experience that I had at this TGIF made me want to write something good about the place. second of all, I like this place b/c it has HAPPY HOURs on Sundays and after 10 pm everyday around bar area, BEST EVER!!!!!!!!!. Place where you can come and quench you alcohol thirst for less $. They have beers, margaritas, Sangrias, Electric lemonade (My Fav), etc... They also have half off appetizers which includes different kinds of wings!!!!.   The only thing that really bother me at this place is that....instead of having a big bar area they should also have some big screen TV's. There Tv's are too small to watch games on a football Sunday. Atleast one big screen TV around bar area and this place with always be flooded with people.

In either case, what I remember as being a pretty great place to eat in high school is now lower in quality than certain nearby diners (Tick Tock, I'm pointing at you). Seriously, for the prices here, the food should be so much better. The menu contents have hardly changed in the last 5 - 10 years either, which makes it boring on top of being not so tasty. Add to that the annoyance of a drink menu with almost no effing prices on it, and you get a big pile of meh. I was especially annoyed when I asked to substitute a garden salad for the fries with a sandwich I ordered. The result was a few leaves of bleached iceberg, a single cucumber slice, some croutons, and a dollop of blue cheese dressing that weighed more than the entire salad itself shoved into something slightly bigger than a monkey dish... about a quarter of the size of what one expect a house salad to be. I wouldn't have minded so much except that we were charged $1.99 for this ""substitution.""

Staff could care less about its customers.  Place doesn't get crowded anymore.  Food menu items are just strange And the food is seriously below decent.  Sorry but I think this place went downhill.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=80
Christopher H.,"Jersey City, NJ",45,60,3,2.0,1/25/2011,"It's usually standard service here in the end, food and drinks come in a reasonable time.  You could save a couple of bucks if you order the bucket of beers instead of ordering individually. The jumbo shrimp cocktail though isn't as jumbo as I thought it would be, they're about the size of those ones you get pre-cooked with the sauce at the market.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=80
Dana M.,"Belleville, NJ",6,37,24,1.0,5/26/2015,"This was my first time and my last time at Fridays, I had a gift card I wanted to use. What started off our bad experience was we got too our table it took us 15-20 for someone to notice that we were ready to order. Our drinks came out very quickly, then we ordered, we sat there what seemed like a half hour for our food to finally reach us. The was a party that was sitted after us and there food reached them before us. The food I have to say was very tasty, I cant remember the last time I was at a Fridays, but I did enjoy my meal. I think the management needs to retrain there employees here on customer service, because this business is seriously lacking in that department.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=60
Nelson B.,"Rutherford, NJ",0,33,,1.0,5/26/2014,"Typically, we all liked Fridays for one reason or another at one point in our lives. Last time I went there, a month ago. I said it like 3 times, I am allergic to the seasoning please do not put seasoning on my burger or fries. I also ordered my burger medium. Burger comes back. Fries have no seasoning-I can see that. The burger, I get half way through and, come the middle, I bite into a cluster of seasoning. It's all under the cheese. I send it back. The waiter is panicking. I told him, don't worry, I am not going to die, but I am sure to get pretty sick in a few hours. He brings me a new burger. Cool. No seasoning. Burger looks a little pinker than it should. The fries-have seasoning. I stopped eating. I did not get charged for the burger, but I got insanely sick that night. I am not going to sit here and say its because I had  a few bites of a seasoned burger. I am convinced I was served bad meat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=60

Jessie W.,"Denver, CO",182,161,4,4.0,11/30/2012,"You never know what you are going to get when you walk into a chain restaurant, but I have to say the service we received last night was excellent.  My boyfriend and I have been noticing the lack of customer service in general in most places that we go (I am not from the NY/NJ area and usually just blame the tri-state), but our waitress was above and beyond.  Quick, friendly, responded to our tweaks of the menu with cheer and really made what could have been an average dining experience a joy. The food was good, not outstanding, but we were certainly well fed and when another server noticed my boyfriend using the sauce from the ribs for his fries, he took it upon himself to bring a side of sauce!   Fridays, you're making great hires!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=60
Jay D.,"Lodi, NJ",3,60,1,2.0,9/6/2014,"First time in TGI Friday's.  Didn't expect much and that's what I got.  Not fair to compare it to an independent restaurant,   so I'll compare it to Applebee's which is better.  We had TGI Friday's French onion soup, and neither of us liked it.  Very weak  taste with a piece of bread in it covered with melted rubber which they passed off as cheese.  It wasn't even melted in the cup as French onion soup should be.  When the waitress asked us how everything was, we said we did not like the soup , which she saw we had pushed to the side without eating.  She did take it back and did not charge us for it.  Someone else asked for a hamburger and specifically said how to build it.  They forgot the mayonnaise. For an appetizer, I had meatballs with bruschetta which was good.  But my main meal arrived just as the rest of the table was finishing their meal. And it only came because we had to bring the error to someone's attention.  It was okay, but would have been enjoyed more if I had been able to eat it while the others at the table were eating instead of having them watch me eat because they had finished eating by the time my meal arrived. From today's experience, I would say that I am not a fan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=60
Melissa Z.,"Clifton, NJ",166,20,1,2.0,3/22/2015,"I honestly don't expect a 5 Star meal when I go to a chain restaurant but I do expect the food to be decent. The spinach dip tasted like it had just come out of the refrigerator, the mozzarella sticks were still cold in the middle & the cheese sauce was luke warm at best. My entree came out with mayonnaise after I was very specific in asking for my sandwich to  be mayonnaise free, the waitress was frustrated I wanted a new sandwich. I asked for ranch dressing for my sweet potato fries I had to ask for that 4 times before I finally got that. Really disappointed with everything and now I remember why it's been so long since I've been there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=60
Rennie J.,"Hawthorne, NJ",230,46,29,2.0,7/5/2015,Food is very inconsistent and the staff is hit or miss depending on the day. They also will not give you the all you can eat appetizer menu unless you ask for it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=60
Janet K.,"Fort Lee, NJ",2,5,,3.0,9/16/2015,What I like about TGIF is the consistency. I get their turkey burger and it's been good. I find the restaurant noisy especially when it's crowded and sports are in the television. My jury is out about the bar. Yes refills for sodas are available. I haven't found an alcoholic drink I like but my friend swears by their mojitos. Best dessert is the vanilla cheesecake. It's served with whipped cream and ice cream. Pass on the coffee. It's never fresh and they don't use a strong bean.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=60
Alexis A.,"Teaneck, NJ",21,78,34,1.0,4/6/2014,"Terrible experience. I went on a Sunday afternoon and it was quite busy, but to wait 20 minutes before even getting a waiter to my table and thirty minutes before even seeing a drink is a bit excessive and frustrating. The waiter was not apologetic at all. Didn't introduce himself and wasn't friendly at all. I ordered the jack Daniels chicken sandwich and I had to ask for jack Daniels sauce. Why? My friend ordered a steak and it was so black and burnt it was ridiculous. I wouldn't have even fed that to my nonexistent dog. Finally we ask for the check and of course it was split up incorrectly so that adds another half hour that we had to stay there and try to flag him down just to pay.

Troy G.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",1,33,24,3.0,4/10/2016,Okay time for my update review I went to TGI Fridays yesterday and I'm giving this review just three stars because of what happened so let me start off by saying that our server was very nice and it was very busy in the restaurant but however sadly you always have to do everything right so I ordered the $12 unlimited appetizers and surprisingly once again everything tasted great the only thing I can say is that the Memphis BBQ wings needed a little more sauce and that the peanut butter and jelly wings were surprisingly good as for the braised beef tostadas they were still very tasty and very good as well as the chicken pot stickers that were made fresh and yes I can tell they were they were pan-seared however some of my friends that received food we're not happy about the portion size and the fact that some of the food was cold so sadly that's a downgrade also I ordered a Cinnamon Toast Crunch shot however I guess in the shot glass it was hard to balance out the next year for the bartender because it did not taste like one but it was almost on the verge of tasting like it and it did take a while for just appetizers to come out however like I said it was busy so I might just let that pass overall when I come back? Yes only because I do believe they serve good food and sometimes the service can be a bit slow depending but all in all I've been to a lot worse places this really isn't that bad,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=60

Troy A.,"Union City, NJ",19,6,,1.0,2/27/2016,"Stay away. Place is garbage. Took my wife and son here for a late lunch on 1/30/16. The server was ok. Not overly attentive, but satisfactory. I cannot say the same about the food. The kitchen staff should be cast for the next season of Food Network's Americas worst cooks. We started with mozz sticks, boneless wings, pot stickers and soup. Everything was borderline cold and tasting of refrigerator. The entrees were horrendously bad. I got 1/2 rack and fried shrimp. The ribs were flavorless and cold. I'd say borderline gross. The shrimp were also cold and tasted like cardboard bits with breading. My wife had surf and turf. She had to send it back. The steak was a cold hockey puck and the lobster tail was a salty mess. My son had a chicken sandwich and had no complaints. I would have derived more satisfaction from taking a lit zippo to a hundred dollar bill. I've loved Friday's since I was a kid. This was without any doubt the worst experience I've ever had. This place is doo doo. I heard the Friday's in Hackensack is much better. This place will appeal to anyone who enjoys eating TV dinners without a microwave, directly out of a freezer. I'd give this place negative stars were it possible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=60

Maggy S.,"Nutley, NJ",0,8,2,1.0,4/2/2016,"Today I visited TGIFridays hoping to have a nice evening watching Villanova crush Oklahoma and make it to the championship game; however, what i was presented with was disappointment.  We arrived at the restaurant around 6pm and sat in the bar area.  We ordered 4 orders of the Endless Apps and proceeded to order drinks off the happy hour menu.  The menu listed $3.25 for 14oz domestic draughts and bottle beers and $4.25 for 20oz domestic draughts and we asked our waiter which beers from the menu this included and he said all of them.  So we proceeded to order 2-20 oz Angry Orchards, 1- 14 oz Blue Moon, 1- 20 oz Blue Moon, and 1- 14 oz Blue Moon . When the check came it was about $94 and we were surprised to see that they were all priced at $6.25+.  I asked our waiter about this and he stated that was the domestic draught beers only included Budweiser, Coors, etc.  I explained to him that the sign said domestic beers and all the beers we ordered were produced in America and therefore are domestic beers.  He sent over the manager to speak to us and she apologized and said she would remove 2 of the Endless Apps ($10 each) from the check so that the total would have been what we expected.  However, when she dropped off the new check it was for $86 and we realized that she had only removed $8.  After mentioning this to our waiter he apologized and said he would talk to the manager again and get them removed, so we gave him our credit card.  When he returned we saw that he had still charged the credit card for the full $86 rather than removing the items that the manager said she would remove.  Overall, I am very disappointed with the service I received and the damper it put on what should have been a celebratory night watching my Nova Wildcats make it to the NCAA championship game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-clifton?start=60
