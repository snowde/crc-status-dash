John S.,"Santa Clarita, CA",28,199,64,4.0,8/23/2017,Great menu and equally great service. I like to sit in the bar so that makes service hot and miss anyways but this bar was on it. Refilling drinks was a priority and for that alone it makes for a good experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia-3
Luke P.,"Columbia, MO",31,57,50,2.0,3/25/2017,Thank God we had a $45 gift card! This was the worst food we had had in a long time. We waited over 30 minutes for our order. And then the appetizers were cold. The food was not prepared properly and we sent some of it back.  Decent beer selection. Some local beers in town. Cannot give this place over 2 Stars. They should never have changed their menu!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia-3
Darryl W.,"Ashland, MO",25,82,168,2.0,3/26/2017,"This was our first trip to TGIF. With a good ad campaign and the new endless variety apps we came in for wings, and drinks. Met and quickly seated, the staff was attentive and friendly. New to the chain, I found the decor nice and trendy and the place was clean. It was about half empty and there were plenty of open seats, and we sat in the bar area where specials are a little better than in the dining room. Our table of 5 ordered 2 sets of endless apps for $10 ea (bbq chicken flat bread & fried pickles), a Spin Dip, and a single order of BBQ wings. The drink specials were nice. the $4 house long island tasted like lemonade however. A $5 Captain Morgan on special (Calls on Sunday special for $5) becomes $9 if you order a double. Way overpriced! A beer is $3 which is nice, but I don't drink beer. Food. The Spinach Dip came with chips....and salsa and guacamole? -which we found very odd. The dip was not assembled and mixed well, and had an odd, un-spin dip taste. In the middle we dug out a half bundle of un-chopped spinach. I mean a lot! If was not good...The endless apps took about 25 minutes to arrive and then our reorders took a half hour! I guess that's why they are $10, by the time you get them you have given up, no chance of losing money on the deal for them. The wings order was good, but meh. We got a huge order of fried pickles and they were good. The flatbread heavy on diced peppers and onions, little chicken...meh. Not wanting another bucket of pickles we reordered cheese sticks, and pot stickers.  Now, these were not good. They were we think under-cooked or just bad , and were not cheesy but broken in half like Parmesan cheese block would.  I gave the waitress the feedback and she asked if we wanted another order. Well....No! No offer to credit our check or other offer was made.  Overall this was very disappointing. Chain Bar Food Can Be Good People! Let's do better here! The food is way below what one expects from a developed large chain, and is several notches below the quality of the atmosphere. It probably deserves a 1 star...but I probably won't return to let it slip any further.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia-3
Greg M.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,3,,2.0,11/19/2017,"Delicious food,  poor service at the Lindbergh St. Louis location. I'm hoping Medina had an ""off"" day or sees this and makes efforts to improve.  She never refilled our drinks or our kid's empty drink cups. We had to ask. The kids sundae was not served with the pecans or cherry mentioned on the menu.  We had to clear and stack empty plates ourselves to make room when the sundaes came. She didn't even clear what we stacked after delivering the desserts. When the bill came she spilled milk on it, and while she was aware of the spill, my wife had to clean that up as well.  Didn't even apologize for the spill, just walked off.  This is one of the only times I've tipped less than 20% in my life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia-3
Nikki D.,"Dacula, GA",0,1,,1.0,10/28/2017,"Wings were not cooked properly. Told my server , Jasmine, She brought the manager and he wanted to argue and say that this is discoloration of the bone.

Shenique R.,"Bowie, MD",58,1,,1.0,11/3/2017,"I visited this Friday's Bowie Maryland location on 11/2/2017 around 7:30 pm, upon entering I asked the hostess how long the wait was for a party of five.I was told 15 minutes after about 20 minutes of waiting with the guest before me I went and asked how much longer we would have to wait to be seated as there were many tables and booths available for seating. I was then told it would be an additional 20 minutes, at this point I was livid trying to figure out why she's not not giving accurate estimated seating times. I came with my family and you can clearly see some of my party was no older than 3 years of age. She proceeds to tell me that here is only one waiter! One waiter for an entire evening shift just doesn't seem right to me, I stayed because my family really wanted Friday's and were using a groupon they had purchased. Once finally seated it still took about 15 minutes before we were even approached by the waiter for our drink orders, with all that time on our hands we had already figured out what we were going to eat and gave our full order. About 10 minutes after placing our order the manager came to see how our overall experience was I informed him that I was very dissatisfied at this point letting him know of my experience so far he offered me a free app or desert card. This wasn't want I wanted, I needed for him to correct this issue starting with the employees. After receiving my food I took about 5 bites asked for boxes and the bill. With how long we were waiting on our service we decided to leave the payment on the he table and leave. Shortly after getting everyone situated in the car we were approached by a bright light and sheriff being accused of skipping the bill! I thought they can't be serious this is hilarious to me went back in to say reading is a fundamental thing as we left the groupon which covered the cost of the meal and left a tip. And also realizing that the calculations for their gratuity was higher than the the 15% it supposedly showed on the bill all of the percentages were higher starting at an actual 18%. This restaurant is full of crooks. At I thought was hilarious was that their service all night was slow but as soon as you think someone skipped  the bill which I felt racially profiled you harassed me by by coming to my car, then after realizing their mistake tried to apologize. Keep your apology and just do your job properly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia-3
Rochelle K.,"Chillicothe, MO",67,73,2,5.0,8/4/2017,"Good food, clean dining area & restrooms and they happily & easily accommodated a large group!

Mike H.,"St Charles, MO",0,14,3,5.0,1/29/2017,"Great service, great meal, good clean TGI's The quality of the food is what do you expect at a TGI Fridays and no more or no less.

Denise C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,14,1,5.0,7/2/2017,"We were at this restaurant while driving cross country and stopping for the night.  We are a large party with many children so we can be intimidating when put in your station.  Out waiter was a young man named Gage. He was wonderful. The drinks were always full, he was polite and patient with the kids, and the food came quickly. Everything was hot and came out quickly. The rest of the staff helped serve the table and each one was very polite. You never know what you will get when traveling to a restaurant off a highway but I am glad we stopped here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia-3
Fred K.,"Columbia, MO",12,6,2,1.0,11/8/2016,Cajun pasta had at least a cup of nasty butter...no sauce...no cajun seasoning...very nasty food because of untalented cooks. However the waitress was very decent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia-3
Rob T.,"Toronto, Canada",0,2,1,1.0,3/7/2016,"Ordered the smoke stacked burger, found a giant piece of plastic inside. Almost choked on it.

Casey B.,"Colorado Springs, CO",13,44,,5.0,10/1/2015,This Friday's location is ideal for travellers checking in for the night at one of the surrounding hotels. It's within walking distance so we didn't have to drive the moving van with a vehicle in tow. Xavier was our server and he was friendly and very professional. My peach sangria was very well made and my steak was cooked perfectly. I had a lovely experience and can't wait to come back and visit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia-3
Brad P.,"Mexico, MO",2,11,7,4.0,12/22/2015,"Very pricey but I can honestly say the jack Daniels flat iron steak and ribs we're fantastic! The steak had a wonderful aged flavor and the ribs were fall of the bone tender. The jack Daniels sauce had a rich sweet flavor and was terrific, had the mac and cheese for a side and it was rich and cheesy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia-3
Amber C.,"Billings, MO",2,6,,1.0,2/25/2015,So I'm not a tgi fridays fan anyway but we were staying at the hotel next door after a long road trip so we decided to place a to go order. While the woman on the phone who took our order was really helpful and asked questions so I felt secure to not check our order which was my mistake. (Although it was quite a bit more pricy than I imagined) my moms steak was cooked wrong they also forgot the lobster tail and salad from our order. When I called about it the manager was really snobby about it and kinda insulting. Needless to say it will be our last time visiting them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia-3
Robert H.,"Columbia, MO",3,1,1,1.0,5/26/2015,"One of the worst displays of customer service I've experienced...everything from the appetizer to the dessert had an issue.  Ordered to pick up; my sauces were left out, I was missing a side from two different entrees, the shrimp that was supposed to be Cajun was just some Luke warm fried shrimp, JD chicken was over done, and there was something green found in my wife's ice cream!  Check your food before you leave the establishment, lesson learned.  Or just avoid TGIFridays all together. Very disappointing, usually have a good meal there.  Oh btw.  There was maybe 5 customers in the whole building!  Come on, have to do better than that.  Train up the newbies if that's the issue...oh and they forgot to add the stripes for my $50.00 worth of food to our stripes account.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia-3
Rachel S.,"Omaha, NE",135,179,261,3.0,8/8/2015,The experience was what I expected for a large chain restaurant-average. Our server was nice and did a good job of asking if we wanted another drink-a money maker for him so good job! The apps we got were ok. The wings were good. We got the pb&j and Sriracha and the sampler. I felt like the sampler really needed a veggie or two on it but it was quite delicious. My margarita came in a very tall glass with lots of ice so it was very cold. The website advertised they stay open til 1 am although last call was at 12. I expected more on a Friday night from TGI Fridays. But the location was perfect as we stayed right next door. And we were able I stumble back to our rooms and get a good nights rest. Would I go back-probably not but mostly because I am interested in exploring other local places and not the place next to my room.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia-3

Maqui M.,"Columbia, MO",2,62,41,2.0,7/2/2014,"Love the menu, waiter was perfect, but...the kitchen & hostess suffers from laziness.   ..French fries were tiny portion from bottom of warming pan....cold,  old, and card-boardy.. never should've been put on a dinner entre'.  waiter was happy to bring us new batch, but doesn't everbody hate asking?  I hereby authorize every future server to sample a fry from my order, and replace the old limp nasty fries as needed. I promise I don't mind waitin as long as a new batch takes...It's not like those ribs are gonna get any drier or colder. ..Ribs were ok because the sauce was good, but they were barely warm and dry & tuff, the standard for chain restaurant who cooks the ribs earlier in  the day, and spends the rest of the day drying them out .  ..Potstickers were tasty, but near-cold.  June-bugs are tasty too if you dip them in a  cute little bowl of soy sauce. ..brownie desert was delish.   ..Cole slaw was oxidized-old brown yucky, unedible (see picture!)  shoulda been thrown away days ago. ....Worst part, and I'm getting tired of this one....the college hostess is so anxious to get back to hanging with her guy friend waiter at the hostess station, or too lazy to walk more than four steps, she takes my party of three to the very first small round table table for two which is directly behind her, 6 steps away from front door, even though 90% of the tables & booths were vacant..don't they know that everyone hates the table right next to the hostess station, with all ingress & regress right up on you as they walk by?  It's like sitting at the small desk pulled up next to the teacher...this was a lazy hostess.  They keep it freezing in here to keep customers from lingering, sitting near the front door makes worse. Why do we always have to ask for anything but the very first small table she comes to.?  Cuz she wants to get back to leanin on the host podium and make googoo eyes at her young coworker.  I'm sick of service businesses being ran by young lazy college students. The waiter""s awesome service helped, still better than any fast food,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia-3
Jody K.,"Wichita, KS",0,3,,5.0,4/1/2016,I spent two nights at the Hotel next door so I enjoyed the short walk to this restaurant.

R M.,"Waukegan, IL",0,8,,1.0,10/6/2015,"I travel for business and often its chains like these that are only open late enough for dinner and a drink. Today was no different besides the service was amongst the worst I've ever had. Sat at the bar and it started out normal/ok. I get my order in and nurse a beer as I wait for my dinner. Nothing fancy, chicken fingers and fries. I got my order, no silverware or even napkins. Burned through the one sauce I had for the chicken and still wasn't asked how it was, given any napkins, or even asked for another drink let alone how it all was or if I needed anything else. The bartenders were more concerned with chatting up friends/co workers than legit customers. I guess their idea of earning tips is through cleavage and not actual customer service. Suffice to say, enjoy the $1 tip and I'll spend my money and time elsewhere. PS I shouldn't have even left that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-columbia-3?start=20
