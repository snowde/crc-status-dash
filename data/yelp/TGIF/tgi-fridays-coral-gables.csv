Ary M.,"Hialeah, FL",40,7,3,3.0,2/26/2017,"It was ok. Food was fine. Wouldn't order the potato skins again. Waitress kept flirting with my boyfriend. She never addressed me, she stared at him the whole time while asking if ""we"" wanted anything. She also started conversations with him, only him, about three times. That was annoying. Otherwise everything was fine. Oh, there was fresh gum on the floor and no one cleaned it up. When I went inside I stepped in it, I wasn't warned despite the line up of four servers at the front. Oh well. We won't be back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=40

Adry G.,"Miami, FL",243,247,243,1.0,6/17/2015,"Not one of my favorite TGI Fridays out of all of the franchises.

C L.,"Orlando, FL",0,18,,3.0,3/28/2016,"Food tasted great. But service is bad. I don't know if it's the college atmosphere but theses guys are definitely hating to serve you and are not shy about it.

Lindsay B.,"Lighthouse Point, FL",474,189,336,4.0,6/16/2014,"I had a truly pleasant experience at this location. I sat at the bar and had great service. The bartender I believe her name was Holly was very personable and knowledgable about the menu. I always am a little apprehensive about coming to chains like this, but my service here definitely exceeded my expectations.  Only con was that we stood at the hostess stand for a few minutes while a server was crouched down at the hostess stand on a personal phone call ignoring us. That is the reason we dined at the bar, unbelievable!  The food came out very hot and the drinks were good. Try the Parmesan fries as a side, they are DELISH!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=40

Don't get your hopes up at all.  Our good friend won bingo, they announced his win over the loudspeaker, and the grand prize to be given to him.  After half an hour of isolating him in the back of the restaurant, it was decided that he wasn't entitled to the $300. The manager then proceeded to ""apologize"" to us and handed our friend a $25 gift card to Fridays instead of the $300 supposedly ""promised"" to the winner.   We use to go every Wednesday. Never.

When walking into this TGI Fridays, my friends and I were hungry as can be and were eagerly anticipating the $12 Endless Apps, and yup, you guessed it! They f**cked it up.

The drink specials are not that great (grove has better ones and better ambiance)  But I think the absolute worst part of this Friday's establishment is the manager who you never see and frankly, CLEARLY does not care at all about customer service or satisfaction.

I am not a fan of the pub quiz there though, we were trying to watch the game and the only TV's are in the bar area. So we couldn't avoid the pub quiz and it wasn't a very fun one at that.

Sergio F.,"Miami, FL",765,1259,5162,3.0,3/13/2011,"I'm going to settle on 3 stars, because the vanilla bean cheesecake saved the day, and because they didn't charge autotip. I stopped by after running some errands in the South Miami and I'm a fan of their bruschetta chicken pasta. Since it was just me, I sat at the bar (besides the Heat was getting ready to dismantle Memphis). Backing up for a second, I headed to the bar since there was no hostess out front at the moment I walked in. The bartender was occupied in conversation and flirtation with two other clients and I once again had to do my polite cough to get service.  My dish was served after about a 15 minute wait, although it seemed uninspired and lacking in chicken and balsamic dressing as compared to the Friday's in The Falls a few months back.

Finally we got good service and had a great time. She constantly checked on us, our food and drinks came out quickly, yes she was on the ball. Spinach dip was very good, boneless buffalo wings good, potato skins, well I do not eat them but the rest of the party liked them.  Margarita's for $4, and they have alcohol in them.

Serena P.,"Weston, FL",150,122,246,4.0,1/22/2017,"Ok so I know what you are thinking....four stars for this chain restaurant. Let me start by saying I have been going to Friday's for many many years, so part of me loves the nostalgic feeling I get dining here. However, to be fair, the four stars I am giving were earned on my last visit.  I went with a group of girls from work during our lunch break so we were kind of in a rush. I didn't get a chance to order an appetizer and went straight to my entree. I am absolutely in love with the Jack Daniels chicken strips (on the starters menu). Very good portion size, especially for lunch. The tenders are crispy and tossed in a semi-sweet Jack Daniels glaze. Order with a side of fries to dip in the extra glaze and you have got a perfect meal!  Bummed I didn't have time to order dessert we asked the waiter for our checks. Considering the restaurant was dead he took a while to being them out, but I will let it go since we did ask to have the check split 5 ways.  Overall, service was good, as was food. Like I mentioned I have been many different locations and while they may not always be consistent I was very pleased with this visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables
Jazz J.,"North Miami, FL",19,103,40,1.0,5/26/2017,"This has got to ne the worst Fridays in MIA. The spinach dip was terrible, it's like they mixed the cheese and cream together and put it around the base of the bowl and just threw the spinach in the middle. The spinach was in long pieces (it wasn't even cut up). Terrible! I ordered the spicy burger with the 2 wings on top. It was just ok. Now for our waiter, he was awful, not only to our table but other tables he was serving, we had 2 get up and look for him for every thing we needed. We let him know that we were on lunch and that didn't help, needless to say my 1 hour lunch turned into 2 1/2 hours. Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables

April W.,"Miami, FL",64,151,351,4.0,8/17/2016,"So, hubs was off while I slaved away at work and he decided to pick me up for lunch in my area. How sweet :) The choices are rather limited in the near area and we ended up here.  Seating was readily available and it was not too crowded. The server seemed very attentive and checked in on us a few times before we were ready to decide, without being pushy or making us feel rushed.  The lunch specials are a decent value, and come with the choice of soup, house salad, Caesar salad, or mozzarella sticks as a side, and a small portion of fries. I ordered the spicy chicken sliders w/ fries, and chose the house salad as my side. Hubs ordered the spicy Cajun chicken pasta w/ fries, and mozzarella sticks as his side (the fries come automatically, in case you're thinking fries are a strange accompaniment with pasta). We ordered chicken fingers with mandarin oranges from the kids menu for my daughter.  Wait time for the food was rather slow (about 20 minutes) and I think this was the fault of the kitchen rather than the server. It was not that busy, so they must be cutting back on the cooking staff. Being on my lunch break, I was particularly aware of the wait time. Finally I decided to ask the waitress how much longer, and soon after the food arrived. Unfortunately, the kitchen had messed up my order and gave me mozzarella sticks instead of my salad (I know it was the kitchen's error because the order was correct on the bill). At that point I was in a hurry, and could not afford the time to ask for the correct side.  I enjoyed my food, as did my daughter. My sliders were decent, fries were well-seasoned, and the mozzarella sticks were good. My daughter liked her food too, and the portion was big (3 big tenders and a decent size dish of oranges). Hubby was the only one unpleased. He felt the pasta tasted charred, but was ok with the fries and mozzarella sticks. We ordered a brownie with ice cream for dessert and that was veryyyyyy good. Yummy, soft, and perfectly warmed.  Overall, I had a good experience and the menu had several yummy sounding items that I would be curious to try in the future.

Miami R.,"Miami, FL",116,77,32,1.0,1/1/2017,"So, where do I begin?  I had to debate which stars to give, because I've some good experiences here in the past. That said, I've had a bunch of less than good experiences. This last visit though has prompted me to give it the lower stars.  The restaurant is slipping and thus I can't forgive the bad because of the good they used to have.  My wife and I went in on Thursday (12/29/16)  We were greeted right away, and sat quickly. Not sure why Fridays makes the hostess tell the guest that they are their hostess, by name. But, neither here nor there.  Our server made her way pretty quickly, she was one of those servers that sits with guests as they take the order. I'm all for that, IF, you are a top server who has their job locked in. (She was not one of those)  Name on the receipt says michal but it sounded like she said knee-shawl (spelling phonetically) I ordered my Diet Coke, my wife ordered kettle with soda and a splash of cran, plus a glass of water. She came back a few minutes later with my soda, but no water for my wife while she waited for the bartender to get her drink ready. The receipt shows she rang in the drinks correctly, but the first drink came out just vodka and a splash of cran. That was when the drink finally came.  She came back to take our order. We went with an a sampler appetizer of pot stickers, pretzels and boneless wings. I ordered the ribs & ribeye combo, my wife ordered the black bean burger.  So, time goes by, and goes by, and goes by. Next thing we know, the entrees are here, but the app never showed up. I mentioned it, and the hostess went back to check on it. I pointed out to the server that the steak that was in the plate was a New York, not a ribeye. The hostess came back with appetizers I handed her my entree and said this will have to go back. She responded with, ""why?"" I said trust me, just take this to the kitchen please. She left the burger behind though.  We started eating the appetizer, wings were great, pretzel was good, pot stickers were cold. So, back the food went again to make everything hot.  Mind you, there weren't any sharing plates to eat the appetizer off of and no extra napkins.  I got the manager involved, Javier. I explained what was happening so far. He was understandably disappointed. He took away the app, and finally the black bean burger.  My wife at this point had been waiting for a refill on her drink, so Javier ordered one for her. This one came out correctly.  The hostess, who should have just quit while she was behind, after the why comment, came over and said you should make sure the manager discounts your bill. I said thanks, everything is being worked on. She patted my wife on the back and said, you have your hands filled with this one.  Javier brings back the sampler, and everything was hot and delicious.  While eating the sampler, someone came by to drop off my entree again, but we had just gotten the app, so he kept walking. I noticed though that he didn't have the burger, which I found out why a little later.  We finished the sampler and the server said you finished your burger right? My wife said no, they took that back too so we could eat our appetizer.  We were told my food was ready, they were just waiting for my wife's burger now.  Our entrees finally come out, ribs were good, ribeye was a little over cooked, but still good. Mashed potatoes were blah, coleslaw was fine. My wife enjoyed her black bean burger.  Javier came out to check on us and ordered my wife another drink, because her glass had been empty for a while again.  Towards the end Javier came back out to again offer his apology for the evening. He gave me 3 $10 gift cards. And then our server came back. She asked if we wanted any dessert, by this point it was almost 11:00 and we were really just done, so we said no. She brought the bill, I opened it curiously like I wonder what had been done to the bill. Last shock if the night.... nothing had been done to the bill. Not a comped app, not a drink, nothing. (Yes, I'm aware he gave me gift cards, but that's so it insures I come back another time to spend money) and it also helps not have to explain the next day why things he to be comped.  He seems to have tried to recover the bad experience, but the effort fell a little short. But he did try.  After just now reading the back of the cards, they can't be combined. So in order to use them, I'd have to come back three separate times. That's just made the situation worse. Fail!! There needs to be a lot of retraining in that location. There was an entire section that was just filled with dirty tables that were dirty when we sat and still dirty when we left.  I guess that wraps up my most recent experience.

We suggested that they can put two tables together. She said she couldn't do that because it could be a hazard to everyone. Then she said she couldn't really seat us because the kitchen is closing. What kind of business are they running here? When you close the kitchen 2 hours before they say they close. First time and last time we come here.

This sounds great, so my friends and I took advantage of these deals.  We came here on a Thursday night, the restaurant was not busy. There were plenty of seats available everywhere, but they still had us wait for a table. We waited about 5 minutes, which I felt was unnecessary, but oh well.  I ordered a mojito, and once I received it I found a curly hair in my drink. I do not have curly hair, so that wasn't mine. I immediately called the server to inform him, he apologized and I asked to get a beer instead.  The food is typical bar foods. We ordered cheese sticks, pot stickers, and buffalo wings. It was good. The pot stickers were the best part.  Our server was very attentive, funny and in a good mood.

Food orders were even slower, after 70 minutes 2 orders of chips and salsa came with an apology for poor service. After 90 minutes we complained to the manager. Food eventually started showing up however only those folks who complained to the manager. My burger was cold however it was cooked as ordered and tasty. I never did get my water. I again saw the manager because our checks were not arriving. He offered a 10% reduction as his way of making things better. I told him if the check was not in my hand in 10 minutes I was leaving and he could keep his discount. I will never set foot in another TGIF Fridays.

Abisai H.,"Miami, FL",670,166,692,1.0,8/8/2014,"This used to be one of our favorite places to go and just enjoy good food and drinks.  It's sad to say that after our visit today it has changed. To begin the service was not anywhere near what it used to be. The place has gone from friendly and helpful waiters to careless unprofessionals.  We sat and asked for drinks. The waiter recommended one of the new margaritas on the menu and my wife got a berry mojito shaker. When the drinks came, they had all the ingredients but the alcohol. The margaritas were pure sweet and sour mix with a bag of sugar added to them. The mojito tasted like water with a drop of raspberry juice. We sent the drinks back and when we received them again our waiter said that the recipe was done correctly. Apparently there is a new bartender in the house.  I ended up asking for another berry mojito with an extra shot. It came separate because the bartender refused to mix it.  Time for the food. Our waiter explained the new 10 dollar unlimited appetizer deal. When we decided to do it, he began to explain we couldn't order ten appetizers and that he was going to do an exception for us by letting us order up to four times. Seriously who orders more that 4 of the same appetizer at Fridays! I have to say we felt very uncomfortable with his recommendation and almost canceled the order.  The food arrived for everyone but myself. I had ordered the shrimp and chicken sizzler and it arrived after the rest of the table was finished. By this time I had lost my interest in my order and was even more disappointed when the plate was placed in front of me. Two very minuscule pieces of chicken breast and 4 small shrimp, over yellow cheese and a spoonful of mash potato.  What a disaster and horrific experience. What once used to be the place to enjoy in a Friday night has become anything but that. Definitely won't be stopping by for a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=20

I had to go all the way back, and as I walk in the employee turned around and handed me the bag of it claiming the man forgot to pack it. At this point, I am quite upset. Then I get home AGAIN to see the mashed potatoes had cheese in it. Ok so at this point I'm sure they don't know what the fuck they're doing. I'm not even considering walking back now, so I call them. I get on the phone with the manager and all she can do is tell me ""well it comes with cheese there's nothing we can do about that"". Now, why the fuck the employee didn't mention that before i don't know!!! The manager than proceeded to tell me I can return to receive another option.

Kearstin E.,"Denver, CO",599,442,368,1.0,5/18/2014,"Menus recently have been changed to mock a fancy restaurants- with high prices for the same food they had before and somehow also, the service quality has also plunged very low. *This part may be specific to this location* It all really happened!... -Our server waited 10 minutes to ask us for our beverage choices (before food) -He took it upon himself to decide what comes out- when; he brought out my  salad 10 minutes after serving my boyfriend what he ordered for his entree. -When I ordered my food, I read it off the menu and our waiter said ""Which one is that?"". I literally had to tell him the price of it because he had no idea what was on the menu.  -My ceasar salad came out dry so I had to ask for dressing. He came back and gave me Italian dressing- for my Ceasar salad O_o  -My chicken and fries came out COLD and STALE, I had to have it sent back. -I asked for a side of sauce THREE times. It came to the point my boyfriend had to get up and go to the kitchen himself. The waiter came and asked how the food was that I hadn't touched yet- and I had to remind him for the 4th time, I'm still waiting on my sauce.  -The waiter was saying sorry left and right to each table around us, and even asked someone at another table- ""Wait, what did you order again?"" -He decided he would give us 20% off (wonder why?)... when he brought us back our bill that totaled a little over $11.00, he deducted .60 cents- saying that this was the 20% off he so kindly granted us.

Jerry L.,"Miami, FL",1,17,,4.0,11/10/2016,My previous review of this Friday's location was anything but complimentary. Since that time my family and I have decided to give them the opportunity to show that improvements have been made. I am happy to report that my neighborhood Friday's restaurant has made immense improvement in both the food and service. I have now visited this store three times since my last review and I can say that the changes are like night and day.

Alexandre H.,"Miami, FL",257,253,121,3.0,5/22/2015,"I have been to several different TGIFs in the U.S., and usually the experience is about the same (except NY, where prices are absurdly high and service is..well.. it is NY after all). But unfortunately things are changing at TGIF, I clearly feel that the quality of the food and the service is going downhill. Last night we ordered ribs and the grilled chicken and shrimp. When the food came we all giggled.. the picture of the chicken and shrimp plate on the menu shows very different sizes (of both the chicken and the shrimp), but anyway, what else is new in this business? But the taste was good, everything was hot, in my opinion a 4* for a chain restaurant. What blew 1* off my rating is service. Although our waiter was nice and friendly, he was missing in action most of the time. Our drinks took forever (drinks = two glasses of draft beer, complicated?), arriving almost at the same time as the food, which by the way took very long too. Ordering the bill was another challenge in time travel, and then waiting for him to get my credit card to close it definitively signified a singularity in the time continuum black hole phenomena. One thing that really bothers me is the WATS (""waiters avoiding table service""), since the only job of a waiter is to ... wait tables! If he is always missing in action then he needs to change careers. Sorry. I'm paying... and tipping... I expect and deserve service, and I WILL knock off stars (and add stars too) for the quality of service I get. I hope TGIF fixes these issues, I like the concept and the food, but if I'm not 100% happy after spending my money I will start to look for other alternatives.

Lauren M.,"Denver, CO",120,401,592,3.0,9/2/2014,"I'm writing another review for a chain restaurant, and as usual, I'll rate it a 3. Nothing really stood out to me, but nothing was oh my god awful.  I definitely like having the TGIF Stripes rewards (very easy to sign up for this) because you get free chips and salsa as a starter. And studies have shown that it's in human nature to enjoy free appetizers. I think it might even be stated in the Bible, but in one of those lost books no one really knows about. Unfortunately, the drinks at this location were extremely weak, but I think this is true of most Friday's locations. The Blackberry Long Island Tea Shaker didn't even make my cheeks rosy, but it was still tasty and refreshing. I thought those drinks were supposed to be notoriously strong. And the strawberry daiquiri my family friend ordered was bubblegum pink, not the true reddish pink of a legit daiquiri - and it apparently tasted more like ice than strawberry. When we asked the server if they accidentally put in a virgin daiquiri order, she was very accommodating and said she'd ask the bartender to add more mix. When she came back, they definitely bumped up the alcohol level. So if you go to this location and your adult beverage tastes like it has zero alcohol, don't suffer in silence. They were very nice about fixing it. As for the food, it was fine. Burgers are always a safe bet. And the server let us try a side of the Jack Daniels sauce - I wasn't crazy about it, but I ordered the black bean burger. Not the best combination. All in all, TGI Friday's offers good discounts, good burgers, and the friendly staff clearly wants you to enjoy your experience there and come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=20
Saily L.,"Miami, FL",227,138,565,2.0,8/11/2014,"Coming to Fridays was one of the best parts of my teenage years! Sad to say, but things have changed and not for the good! Miami has become quite the foodie city, so the competition is huge! The Larger chained restaurants are competing with smaller businesses which offer better service and food.  Fridays totally stayed behind. To start off theybremodeled their location not so long ago and it's horrible! Extremely plain. I loved all the items they had hanging from the ceiling and on the walls! A very edgy and lively place to dine at. Not anymore :(  I know the crowd is young most of the time but that doesn't mean you can talk to your guests like they're family. There's got to be some sort of professionalism. Our waiter recommended us some drinks that when they came tasted more like sour mix than alcohol. I opted out and got a berry mojito, let's just say all I tasted were the berries. Extremely watered down berry juice.  Now, the only reason I gave them 2 stars is because I absolutely LOVE the fried green beans. They now have a deal that you pay $10 and get unlimited orders of it. It's a pretty good deal but I feel like they have to constantly do stuff like that to lure guests in.  But apparently unlimited was limited! He explained that we couldn't get 9 or 10 of them. I mean who gets 9 of the same appetizer, but if it's unlimited what IF I do want 10?   I usually get the Fridays shrimp for dinner, with regular fries. A dozen Fried shrimp. My husband got a sizzler which consisted of tiny chicken breasts and a few shrimp. Honestly, with what I paid here, we could've gone to any smaller restaurant and gotten better and bigger amounts of food. I'm sondisappointed with Fridays!

Those two go to: The waitress (not service), we happened to have a nice waitress who seemed like she may enjoy her job, and then the food which is always decent.  The atmosphere here is AWFUL. They sat us in the farthest booth, next to the bathrooms/ kitchen (gross) and no TVs were visible. The music was extremely weak and barely audible, and the yelling and dish noises overpowered it coming from the kitchen. We order drinks, then appetizers, and the appetizer comes out first. We give it a good 5-10 minutes and no drinks. I get up and go to the bar where I see our drinks sitting, and I have to ask a food runner to bring them over to us. NOT GOOD when a customer needs to ask where their are drinks at the bar. Trust me I'm a laid back person too. More yelling in Spanish coming from the kitchen throughout dinner. I ask my BF what they are saying (I don't speak Spanish ) and he says you don't want to know. Some guy with long, purple and pink hair that's shaved on the sides hanging out in the kitchen (view from my booth I can see everyone working back there) Where is the hair net?!!!!

He also didn't give my friends the Happy Hour special that was going on unless we sat on the other side of the wall that separated the bar from the dining room. It did not specify that anywhere! Also, my friends got their beers when I got my water. I was so disappointed sitting there because I used to go to that Fridays so many times when I was in high school. It was such a joke. I have never had such horrible service in my life. I do not recommend this Fridays at all! Oh and not to mention when they brought the manager over, he did nothing to fix the situation.

We were pretty agitated by this, but she apologized and all was forgiven. 'Til she disappeared for a half hour. And didn't bring our drinks. Flustered, I approached the hostess and asked for the manager. After speaking with the manager, my drinks were delivered a few minutes later. Lo and behold, I get the wrong friggin' drink. Oh hell naw. So I send it back and wait another 10 minutes to get the correct one. We ordered our meals when we finally got our drinks. The food took like 45 minutes to come out and was cold. Shortly after our food arrived, I needed to orchestrate a trip to the ladies room with 3 little people. I walk in the restroom and immediately am hit with the pungent aroma of vomit. The chorus that accompanies such smells, you know, awful, heaving, death throe sounds, was also present. And of course, they were in the large handicap stall that I need to use. F#~@! So I had to wait. I was embarrassed to have to wait and face this poor person, but I'd have been even more embarrassed by 3 kids leaving a trail throughout the dining room. At last, the infirm one emerges from the stall - and guess whooooo? - MY FRIGGIN' WAITRESS. OH HEEEEEEEELL NO! She gave me a sheepish grin and a nod, wiped her mouth with her sleeve, and was off. No handwashin', no nothin'. I was horrified. I did what I needed to do and hurried out of the restroom. I ran straight for the hostess again and politely, with a twinge of urgency, requested to speak with the manager once more. Manager came over, apologized, gave us our check (which I was charged for the improper drink AND the proper drink on - but she fixed it), and gave me a coupon for a free appetizer.  A free app? Why in the world would I ever go back? I'm praying the waitress was just pregnant with some morning sickness or something and wasn't contagious. But seriously, if you're vomiting and work in food service most especially, stay home please. Gonna be a long time before I step foot in a Fridays again, if ever. :\",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=80

After the hostess seated us, we saw our waitress after a 5 minute wait. Since it was late at night, we were not in the mood of eating an entree but we wanted to try some appetizers. As I perused the menu, I came across an item which read: Friday's Pick Three For All. You pick one appetizer from a list and two others from another list. We picked the boneless wings with Garlic Parmesan sauce, the loaded potato skins and pan seared pot stickers.  It was served very hot. There about 8 pieces of boneless chicken wings, 4 loaded potato skins and 4 pot stickers. Perfect for our appetite! We washed it down with hot tea and water to make our perfect evening!

Appetizer: we ordered the trio. We had boneless chicken, cheese sticks , and their famous potato skins (which have recently changed). This was probably the highlight of our visit. The cheese sticks were delicious and the new potato skins were great. The boneless chicken was covered in Jack Daniels sauce, which was probably the only thing that saved them.  Dinner: Honestly, I wish we could have ended the meal with our appetizers.  Instead we ordered some entrees. I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken, my cousin ordered the breaded shrimps.

There were plenty of open tables but we had to wait because there weren't enough servers to handle more tables. So we stood around with other parties waiting for about 10 minutes.

Another 5 minutes passes by and were still waiting for our 4 glasses of water and to place our order.  Now we finally place our order and the food eventually comes out. 3 orders come out together and then we wait another 5 minutes before the last dish came out. Thankfully the orders were right and this is the only reason they got two stars. Portions are good but the price doesn't exactly match the quality.  Once we finish our meal it's time to wait again for the check and pay. And as you guessed it took another 20 minutes. All in all it took us an hour and a half to have what should have been a quick dinner.  Overall, the service is crappy and the food isn't exactly worth the new menu prices.

Will N.,"Jupiter, FL",0,6,,5.0,3/30/2014,"This is truly Miami's hidden gem!  Where to begin? The food was all so fresh it had to have been fresh from the farm that morning. The salad my friend had was delicious. The lettuce didn't have that grunge taste that you find in other local restaurants. The toppings on her Cobb salad must have been organic - the flavors were too rich to be mass produced corporate farmed. Selena and I only had one things to say ""let us have more!"" I indulged in the divine French Onion Soup. The broth was perfectly seasoned and the onions succulent enough to where I asked ""is Julia Child in the kitchen whipping dis up?"" The provolone cheese, garnished with what I believe to be parsley, was golden brown protecting the bread underneath. Oh-my-god, the bread! The bread had to have been just sliced from a fresh french loaf. -- Now, I don't normally eat carbs, but for this I made an exception.  My main course was the Friday's Fried Shrimp. As a native to Florida, let me tell you: the only place to get good seafood in this state is the Coral Gables TGI Fridays. These must have been gumbo gulf shrimp delivered that morning (thank goodness the oil spill is a non issue, otherwise they'd have some god awful farm raised shrimp). The shrimp were perfectly fried golden brown - like pieces of the sun had fallen onto my plate. I can't even begin to describe the seasonings on them. Come to think of it, it may just have been salt, but who care? Salt them bad boys!  The side dishes where the (cream cheese) icing on this already too perfect of a cake. I got what could best be described as ""potato fritters."" They were slices of potatoes which were then fried and like the shrimp seasoned with some sort of heavenly spice (I could go either way with it being salt).  My other side was rice.  Selena and I skipped dessert. We moved over to the bar after dinner and had a few cocktails. I had the mint julep - Friday's unofficial specialty. Selena took several shots of 151. What can we say...she's a Bacardi Girl!  Selena drove us home. We live in the Keys so it was so nice getting out of all the hustle and bustle of Monroe County and enjoy the laid back atmosphere and hospitality of Miami.

I ordered a berry mojito, all to be brought (a long time later) a salt rimmed glass and berry margarita shaker. I sipped the drink, gagged, and after letting her know that it wasn't what I ordered, she didn't believe me (although I'm pretty sure any bartender would not salt a mojito glass). She brought it back to the bar to switch my order which the bartender immediately did. But I watched my berry mojito shaker sit at the bar, ready for pick up for a good five minutes.

I will not come back and urge others not to in hopes that they see a need to change their policies and their attitude towards customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=100
Joel M.,"Homestead, FL",13,28,13,3.0,3/2/2011,"This is a review on the service only, not the food. I came here with a few friends but didn't eat. The service was great, the waitress was very helpful and courteous even though we were quite a hand full... I asked around and everyone said their food was hot except their fries. The fries were just warm... Gregory N was right about their being a lot of cool things hung along the wall. They totally beat the other TGIs I've been to in the decor department.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=100
Genevieve G.,"Miami, FL",105,1,,1.0,6/20/2013,"Went out for the usual Happy Hour Deals - Thursdays at Friday. We usually sit at the bar... but tonight there was no openings so we grabbed a booth behind ""the happy hour wall."" Thirty minutes later we received our beers. The chips for a spinach dip came out so late that the dip was already cold. When we asked about our usual $2 dollar beer specials -- the waiter told us we had to be at the bar. When we asked if we could order at the bar... the waiter barked back no with such a disgusting attitude! The waiter failed to acknowledge our table the whole night -- never brought us water or asked if we would like more drinks. Felt completely ignored the whole night. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE SERVICE BEYOND THE HAPPY HOUR WALL!!! Manager came 30 minutes later and was completely unhelpful. Didn't even bother to correct the situation.  Terrible service. If you find yourself sitting down with Norberto ""Berto""  (MOHAWK DUDE) RUN THE OTHER WAY!!  WILL NOT BE ATTENDING THIS LOCATION AGAIN!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=100
Robert E.,"Miami, FL",0,4,,3.0,6/5/2011,"The endless soups & salads for $7 is a steal! Plus bread sticks and refills! Love the tomato & chicken tortilla soups best. I live and work near this TGIF location, but i have to say the vibe and atmosphere is better at the Falls location...prob cause everyone is in lighter spirits.... Looking for a kewl apptz? Try the fried green beans with the dip, different and quite good:-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=100
Alex S.,"Jacksonville, FL",51,79,,3.0,7/25/2012,"The bartenders kick ass and the happy hour specials are always super cheap. The food is your standard Friday's garbage, but it's pretty cheap as well.

Kristin N.,"Miami, FL",273,220,15,3.0,6/4/2009,"2.5-3 Stars I have to say I wasn't impressed with this location. The waitress was nice but I had to grab her attention for a few things. I ordered the Cobb Salad without blu cheese and with Ranch Dressing on the side. The cobb salad comes with black olives, avocado, lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese, hard boiled eggs and blu cheese. So I asked I got my salad without the blu cheese (GOOD), BUT NO Cheddar Cheese. I also go Honey Mustard on the side instead of Ranch. I let her know I needed Ranch dressing and then I noticed my salad had no cheese. So I asked her. I said ""Does this salad come with cheddar cheese""? I thought perhaps I read wrong. No, I was right, she replied ""Yes it comes with cheddar cheese"". As she's looking at my salad I had to still tell her well, my salad doesn't have any. Can I please get some cheese on the side? She brought the cheese and the ranch dressing. The lettuce wasn't fully fresh, but it wasn't bad. I had to then flag her down to get the check and then she walked away, so I had to flag her down again to pick up the check. Needless to say I got to work 4 minutes late. =/ Not bad, but I would have been on time, if I didn't have to flag her down and go back and forth so many times. I don't think I will be going back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=100
Michele P.,"Houston, TX",18,69,60,4.0,3/23/2012,"""Sometimes you want to go, where everybody knows your name."" Well I don't! Sometimes I want to go where only one person knows my name. And his name is BEN THE BARTENDER! Ben knows my name, my drink, and that I take my steak Medium. Then he leaves me alone to enjoy the silence of one hand clapping. LOL Each and every time I have come here BEN makes sure that my drink, my food are always right. Sometimes he provides light conversation just to see how I'm doing and how life is treating & vice versa. Outside of that, he keeps my glass filled until I give the hand signal that I'm done. Happy hour is the best. 2-4-1 drinks & 1/2 off a selected choice of appetizers. You can get your drink on & eat on without spending no more than $25. Now that is what I call a great deal. See you soon Ben.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=100
Drew H.,"Miami, FL",67,199,86,4.0,9/5/2011,TGI Fridays food is what it is. The part about this one that stands out that it is right across from UM and it has a 3-7 and a 9-Close Happy Hour menu. I guess it sucks for you if you want to eat and drink from 7-9. They have $2 drafts and $2 - $2.50 mixed drinks. Also some other drink specials. They also have 1/2 priced appetizer specials which is awesome. Only catch is there is no to-go orders.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=100

It's a very large restaurant so finding a seat in the reserved bar area was not that bad for a party of 30+. The service was okay but waiter took separate checks without an issue.

We can see that you've just concocted some wierd stuff and tried to tell us this is the cool yummy thing to eat but it's not working! We know better.  We know that eggplant doesn't go well with salad, We know that burgers shouldn't be bland, We know that cocktails should have some alcohol in them and  YES!

Decided to go again last night since my girlfriend and I were in the area,  worst restaurant visit EVER. Server was never anywhere to be found,  I think he checked on our table maybe two times? But he had no problem checking on the table next to us full of college girls. We had to get up from the table, and ask the HOSTESS to go check on our food and to get the manager so we could talk to her.  The food was average and not at all worth the trouble. The funny part? We would have left a WAY bigger tip then those living off their parents college girls, instead here's a tip: Stop ogling underage girls and DO YOUR JOB you creepy man.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=100
Emily V.,"Ellensburg, WA",210,347,109,3.0,7/1/2009,"I'm not a fan of Friday's. However, I am a fan of happy hour.  My friend and I fully took advantage of the late night happy hour and all it offered. It was $3 draft beer, $2 well drinks, and $4 wine. But why would you have wine at Friday's? Anyway, the appetizers were also half price, so guess what we ate?  We shared one of the Friday's Pick Three for All. It was ok. Again, not a fan of their food. We had the onion rings with the traditional wings and potato skins. None of which were great. Then we tried the spinach and artichoke dip with the nachos. THAT was way better.  The service was a bit lacking though. They took forever to come and sit us. Actually, had to go and look for someone to come and seat us. The waitress didn't come often enough. In fact, she had a MUCH larger table next to us and if it wouldn't have been for them she wouldn't have come to check on us.  My bill, including tip came out to a little over $11. It is the least amount of money I've spent on drinks and food EVER! It is also exactly the right amount of money that should be spent at Friday's any time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=100
Denise M.,"Miami, FL",35,31,8,2.0,11/10/2011,"Where do I start? Honestly, this Friday's has left me disappointed. The only reason why you're getting two stars it's because the manager came out when we asked. The food at this location was meh! For appetizers, I ordered the Fried Mozzarella. These tasted like if they we done early in the morning and then just reheated. Same went with my entree.  After we finished with our entrees and asked for our desserts to come, we had to wait 20 minutes. Mind you the restaurant was half empty. Anyways when ther server finally brought our desserts, he had them stacked one on top of the other. As he was handing out the forks for dessert (seriously, who uses a fork for dessert?), there was a strong smell of chlorine eminating from them. When we looked at our plates, they where still wet (and I'm not saying wet at the bottom of the plate, but with little puddles of water next to our desserts) and also smelled of chlorine; which caused me to gag and ask for a refill on my soda, and SURPRISE, the glass also smelled of chlorine. (I get it... You want your customers to know you use clean plates, but you shouldn't try and kill them with the smell of chlorine!) Let's see what else was wrong with dessert? Oh yeah, the other 4 people I was with ordered the Oreo Madness... Yeah I'd be mad to if my dessert came out melted! I wasn't able to really enjoy my Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, fearing that I might get poisoned from chlorine overdose..... One thing which to me was rude, was that they brought out the check before we even got our desserts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=100
Yadira P.,"Miami, FL",0,8,,4.0,3/28/2014,Last week I went with my daughter to have a mommy and me girl's night out and although a little disappointed that her steak was over cooked the manager surely made up for it.  She not only removed the item from the bill but also gave us some perks.  Nothing of which I had asked for because I know mistakes happen.  I have never been disappointed with this particular location which my family and I always go back too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=100
Mary e.,"Miami, FL",124,204,77,2.0,11/3/2010,"I visit this Fridays for lunch about once a month or so.  I've always been happy with the food but have some issues with the service.   Today, I wanted my usual salad, soup, drink, breadsticks meal.  However when I asked for French onion soup I was told that it was an extra $2. Say what?  Yup, I've been ordering this for months and today was the first time I was forced to choose either broccoli cheese or chicken tortilla soup.  I can't have those!  I'm lactose intolerant!   So, I had a bacon cheeseburger.  But they forgot the cheese!  Although the burger was good, it took 45 minutes to get to me.  In the meantime, my lunch date had her meal and finished way before I got mine.  Poor, poor kitchen service.  Our server was very nice and apologetic about it and she still got her 20% tip.  But I was pissed! Most of the patrons here work and barely have an hour for lunch.  On top of that, the place was nearly empty.  I'm very dissapointed.  If they don't get their act together and soon, there will be no more Fridays here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-coral-gables?start=100
