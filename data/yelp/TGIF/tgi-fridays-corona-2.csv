Jasmine S.,"Corona, CA",0,8,,2.0,9/24/2017,"Self seating, husband and I went and sat next to the bar in a tall booth.  -Table was dirty but no other tables available (that we could get happy hour) -Took some time for someone to come ask us what we would like to drink. -Really loud table near us (not tgif fault) but then the background music got turned way up. ( Husband and I were having to talk pretty loud to hear one another) -Menus are beat to hell, ripped,really dirty, pages falling out. Just all bad. -Happy hour drinks smallest amount of alcohol and watered down. -Portions are a lot smaller than other TGIF I've been too  For being in a busy spot in Dos Lagos  I would've thought it be a better experience, the waitress was nice and attentive though, didn't catch her name but she had a noticeable accent. (Saturday night ~10pm) Gotta say TYLER MALL LOCATION IS MUCH BETTER",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=20
Jamille T.,"Corona, CA",61,9,8,1.0,8/29/2017,I am not pleased at all with the service k received at this location. I get only an hour lunch and yesterday I called for pick up. I placed my order an hour before I was going to pick up which as at 11am and let them know I'd be there at noon. I get there 3 minutes after 12pm and my order was not ready. Mind you there was barely anyone there so they weren't busy at all. Then the lady at the front had to look for someone to run my card and it took forever!  She went to the back to get my food and that took a while only to come back and my payment was still not processed. After all this i only had about 15 minutes left to even eat my lunch by the time I got back to my office because they took so long even though I told them I'd be there at noon and they had an hour to have my order ready. It was ridiculous.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=20
Davy G.,"San Bernardino, CA",31,2,,1.0,9/17/2017,"I gotta say we've been to a couple of TGIF's and this one has always disappointed . First time our waiter was rude too our son and just had a bad attitude in general. We had only gotten our drinks so we paid for our drinks and canecelled the food and left. Second time around we didn't want to drive to riverside location so came back here. Again another waiter was just giving us the stink eye and the place was a ghost town. We ordered some drink s again, my beer was good but my wife's drink tasted funky, we took a closer look and the drink was filled with PAPER! We brought up to their attention and they took care of the charge for that drink. We are never going back there again save your gas and go to the riverside location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=20
Skyler S.,"Corona, CA",121,41,9,3.0,3/29/2017,"I'm giving 3 stars only because our server was attentive and great.  I had came here to meet up with an old co worker and his fiancé with my fiancé as well. We thought it would be cool since we had been seeing the $10 unlimited appetizers deal on commercial basically every day. So we decided to come check it out because it was a great deal.  Our wait was 20-25 minutes so I decided to grab a couple drinks from the bar before we got seated. Anyways it took about 15 just for the bartender Allyson to acknowledge us. Now at least SHE did acknowledged us because several of the other bartenders behind the bar didn't even notice we were there. The reason for the 3 stars is because not only did it take 15 minutes for us to even get a drink order in, but after that I waited for another 15 minutes just for the raspberry basil margarita as well as a mojito. Why does it take 15 minutes just to get a drink order placed & another 15 to get our drinks.  Meanwhile of course we had gotten sat, so my fiancé went to our table while I waited at the bar for our 2 drinks still. I couldn't believe I wasn't able to get a drink before we got sat with an estimated seating time of 25 mins max. I honestly would have been better off waiting to get drinks until we got sat because at that point it she was sitting alone & I was waiting at the bar alone.  The appetizers were okay, the wings i'd say is the best thing to get out of all of them, since we ended up trying everything. The wings are definitely the best bang for your buck. The potato skins were okay, and just because i felt like there was too much potato VS cheese/bacon bites. Sauce with them is a must. Overall pretty mediocre service & okay food. But I guess that is what you get for $10 unlimited appetizers, obviously didn't expect the BEST appetizers. The raspberry basil margarita was great tasting though to end on a more positive note!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=20
Nicolette D.,"Redlands, CA",2,10,39,1.0,4/2/2017,"I'm sure the manager of this restaurant was hoping this review wouldn't happen. Me and my friend decided to go to fridays after a long spa day. The waitress we had was very nice and very friendly. However, my experience was not well at all. Food was okay not the best. But I first noticed that my cup for my water wasn't very clean. Stuff was stuck to it. But I decided not to say anything. The waitress brought me another water and while I was sitting there I discovered a fingernail inside my water. yes FINGERNAIL. I was so nasty. But what really pissed me off was that the manager tried to Prove me wrong. She made so many excuses of what it could've been. She pretty much told me I'm wrong.

Rebecca J.,"Costa Mesa, CA",0,1,,1.0,11/19/2017,From the start the experience was bad. Server said he was either training or had someone he was training but that he couldn't remember her name but that we would meet her. We never met her.... and he only came to the table twice.  The food was horrible! My steak was over cooked. Server basically told me what sides I was getting instead of asking me which sides I would like. I had to tell him no and what I actually wanted. The mashed potatoes tasted like they were reheated and came from a bag and the broccoli was mushy. My whole plate of food was soaking in butter and oil. My husband got the fried shrimp dinner and it was a portion of a kids meal for $18.00 fries were rubbery and cold and the shrimp was way over cooked tasted like you were eating rubber bands. The server never gave us refills  on our waters and I asked for lemon and never got it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=20

Jay P.,"Riverside, CA",0,3,2,1.0,9/23/2017,We wanted to take our son out to dinner and a movie for doing well on tests in school. Our movie was at 8:40. We arrived at Friday's around 7:00pm and were told it would be a 15 minute wait. 40 minutes later we were seated. After being seated at 7:40 we waited 20 minutes before anyone came to our table. At 8:00pm a server came and took our drink order . We asked if we could order everything because we were seeing a movie at 8:40. She took our order but we didn't see her for another 20 minutes. At 8:20 I had to stop her and ask if we could at least get my sons drink (he ordered a slushy). She said it was at the bar and she would get it shortly. She then brought me my iced tea and 5 min later brought my son a melted slushy . At 8:35 we decided we had to leave . We hadn't received our appetizer or soups yet and we knew we wouldn't be able to eat and watch the movie . The server told us not to leave because our food was sitting on the slide. She then brought a bunch of food over none of which was ours . Turns out it was the table next to us who arrived a good 20-30 minutes after we had been seated. They ruined our night out and didn't even offer an apology. They made us pay for our drinks before we left. Horrible service . Would not recommend .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=20

Nicholas W.,"Miami, FL",0,7,,3.0,8/13/2017,My wife and I went there tonight for the $10 endless Apps they advertised . However when we arrived the price had changed to  $12 despite the fact that they are still advertised on TV for $10. The food was just ok but the service was decent.  The extra 2 bucks isn't going to break me but it smells distinctly like false advertising.  That alone gives me a bad taste in my mouth worse than the food.  BTW. That restaurant could use a serious house cleaning.  The hostess showed us to a table that still had bits of food crumbs from the previous tenant.  There was dust evident everywhere.  Especially with the late afternoon sunlight shining through the windows.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=20

Pisupo G.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,13,,2.0,10/17/2016,"Not impressed with service.  Serving was a lot smaller than was expected for the high price tag.  Unless I have a coupon or a discounted promotional entree offer, I will not be running to TGIF any time soon.  Food was not all that flavorful, to make it a 'must return'. Service was good, but waiter only checked up on us once. Literally had to create a scene to get waiter to get us a refill.  Then, when the bill finally came, it gave tip options of 18, 20 & higher percentages.  What happened to 15%?  I left a 15% tip, although I felt his service wasn't worth 5%.

Mickey M.,"Moreno Valley, CA",0,3,,4.0,8/25/2016,"I find it interesting and sad that several reviewers complained about the $10 TV special on the ribs. I went last night with friends. One order the 1/2 rack and the server said they were offering a full rack for $10. Deal! I got the same. Glad I did after reading the reviews about the salads. Ribs were very good, as was the service. Overall, I was very pleased with dinner. I do wish the ""specials"" (TV advertised or not) were listed somewhere at the table or in the menu. After reading other reviews, I won't be heading to this location for an advertised special that may or may not be honored. There needs to be some sort of a dress code for servers, too. Several looked like they should work at the circus ... that's OK if this was supposed to be a kids' restaurant  ... but one female server was dressed like a bouncer from some sleezy biker bar.

Mrs D.,"Corona, CA",0,7,21,2.0,4/11/2016,"I'm going out on a limb and giving them 2 stars. i purposefully visited twice to see if the hustle and bustle of a Friday night versus a less busy Sunday night would help improve my overall guest experience. It did, but not much.  There was a decent wait time of 45 minutes on Friday and no wait time on Sunday. The atmosphere is great on either night! It's TGIF, it's moderately loud, the bar area is packed and social with people laughing and watching tv and everyone appears happy and upbeat.   Friday night, the food was perfect and our drinks could have been better. We did return one drink to the bar for something different due to overall quality. Our server was another story. In his defense, he did say that he was new. It took more than 10 minutes to order for 4 people. He had a very hard time hearing our order and was unfamiliar with the menu. As we were bidding farewell to my niece and new husband, we celebrated by ordering a round of drinks and requested a shot as a side. Our shots were added into our drinks before arriving at the table. Admittedly, I am a little picky about this. I felt that the shots should have been separate as you are billed separate. To correct this, he offered to do it next time. There wasn't a next time. They're flight back to Guam was leaving at 4am from LAX and it was very late already. Sunday my daughters and I went after shopping. It was quieter but still a great atmosphere. Great server. Our potato skins arrived looking like over cooked taco shells with dried up cheese and not a bacon bit to be found.  The manager was very accommodating and resolved the issue quickly!

However, one night we asked if they were still promoting 'endless apps' and a bartender we've never seen before (not sure his name) seemed very let down, almost as if he instantly judged us for wanting to order the 'cheap promo'. I have worked in the industry for 8+ years, so I'm not a difficult table, and I tip on the amount the bill should be, not just the cheap promo price. He didn't seem to pay us any attention the rest of the night, regardless of the fact that we didn't order endless apps. My boyfriend requested steak sauce and napkins which were never brought to us either. Thankfully we haven't had this particular bartender wait on us again, and we've continued to have great service.

I ask Juan to double check at another terminal to see if it was his machine, Juan said that all the machines are the same. I told him that it's no way that three credit cards that are from three different banks could get denied. Juan ""Shrugged"" his shoulders and said we had to pay in cash. While talking to Juan my sister checked her balance on her card and she had plenty money on the card plus more. I knew both my cards had enough money on them to cover the bill, and after exiting Fridays I call both credit card company's and they concurred. Juan Martinez who's the manager ""lied"" about all three cards and purposely attempted to embarrass me and my family. I will write the VP of Fridays and request the termination of Juan Martinez!

In the case of this particular TGI Fridays, at lunchtime at least, the endless lunch combined with an exceptional, personable server -- in my case Suzy -- combined to make for a very good lunch experience.  For $6.95 how can you beat all the soup and salad you can eat WITH a drink? Your choice of two crisp, fresh salads (Ceasar or house) combined with your choice of five different hot soups, is an unbeatable deal. And this I believe is done corporate-wide at TGI Fridays. Normally I like to frequent individually owned establishments, if for nothing more than variety, and in the case of family-style restaurants, the daily specials that usually offer a great value. And I realize that the experience at chain establishments usually is fair at best. so when a ""food factory"" is hitting on all cylinders, as has been my experience with this TGI Fridays, it comes as something of a surprise. I think that this endless lunch special is an exceptional value, so much more so than Souplantation even though they include a pasta choice without much flavor and desserts, which IMHO, are almost uneatable. But again, it's the service that can make an OK meal very good and in my case, with Suzy at least, the service has been uniformly excellent. It's rare to find a server who knows exactly when to return to the table to check on things, but she comes back when I'm ready for another round.  If you visit this TGI Fridays, ask to be seated in Suzy's section. If you're on the management team at this location, Suzy should be training all of your serving staff.  Food is OK, probably a bit above three stars, but service and value (at lunch) rank five out of five stars, thus the overall rating of four stars out of five.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=180

He was hungry and we had already waited 30 min for food because they lost power on one of the mointors,( which rhey should have told us) we had to wait 15 more minutes just to eat... The manger came to the table and said ill take care of the tab and give u $10 off. I thought ok but when I got the bill she only took $5 dollars off... Now I been going to this resturant for over 7years and up until lastnight 10/28/15  have change my mind on going back...

My husband and I went in to grab a quick bite in the bar before our movie started (45 mins...plenty of time for the bar at 4 on a tuesday). We sat at the bar.   1st we were greated at our table my one of the waiters who starting talking crap to my husband about his tattoos on his arms.  Being that we were in a rush and the guy seemed ""off""...i kept my cool and we just went on, but i wanted to tell the guy to F off. Then i guess he was feeling really comfortable with us (how??) and started to make racist jokes against the black community.  This was WAY inappropriate for this guy to be saying this stuff, but once again...i let it go becuase i didnt want to make a scene.   We ordered some beers and 2 apps. It took 25 mins for the food to come out.  25 mins for some tacos and soup!  we all know that shit is prepackaged, so why so long, especially since the place was empty? While we were waiting for our food, we could have used another beer.  But the oh so awesome ass clown of a waiter was too busy texting and eating vegetation out of the drink mixing station. As soon as the guy brought our food, i asked for the bill, knowing it would take a while. I literally ate two bites out of my 3 ""Korean Style"" tacos and couldnt do anymore.  There were so gross. My god, i have had better out  of their dinners in the frozen section in my local grocery store.  And the soup....bland.  Whatever.  I was getting furious and this point and was going to ask for a manager, but we were already 5 mins late to our movie.

When I brought it up to the manager he looked at the bread and said that its pretty common unless you order your meat well done... Hummmm. Sooo if my meat is not burnt I am going to have soggy bread? To top it off there was no sauce on my burger at all! It comes with sauce! My burger also tasted burnt! No pink and I ordered medium! Then to make matters worse my sister in law ordered a strawberry Margarita and they brought her the wrong drink and the same douche bag brought it out with the biggest ugliest strawberry the size of Godzilla and he used the same glass with lemons still in it? Really? Trashy! Horrible! Awful! This place is a sh** hole. By the way our actual waitress in training was great! Super sweet! I hope that idiot that is training her doesn't rub off on her!

Debbie M.,"Perris, CA",18,3,,2.0,6/22/2014,"I haven't been to Friday's in a while, in the past have had them add drinks never ordered/consumed onto the bill between reviewing the bill and getting the credit card bill. New manager now so thought we would give it a try again, hopefully the overcharging has stopped.  Went in, many tables empty. Was told to wait five mins...turned into 15. Never asked our name, just kept pointing to 'those people' waiting for a table. Many open tables, hostesses standing around, scratching their hair, joking with each other. Finally got seated in a table that had been empty the entire time. I personally think the hostess in a restaurant should have ""front house"" appearance, not look like a shower hadn't been had in days. Anyways, food ordered and took quite some time since a huge table was seated right by us.  Although seated after us, only 2 in our party, they were actually served first. When my food came out, the potato had sour cream draped across it in a very sloppy manner just slopped on, no butter or chives, as ordered. Potato was barely cooked, needed a steak knife to cut it...completely inedible. Manager came out...unsolicited...to see if everything was ok, assume he came out because he knew it certainly was NOT ok. Offered a new potato, no money off the bill or anything. At this point we have already waited over 45 mins for our food so no, I just won't eat the undercooked potato. No apology other than we had the misfortune of coming when the kitchen was backed up. REALLY...you are a restaurant and the place is 1/2 empty!   To be honest, this is one of the worst run places I have ever been with no excuses offered for their pitiful service.   And the dirty appearance of the hostess, scratching her head constantly because it appeared so unkempt, will keep any normal person away from this establishment which is a shame, the food at Friday's is better than the Corona establishment leads you to believe.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=200

Never happened.  Then I mentioned this to our server and she didn't bring the chips.  The manager came by and without asking he wondered where the chips were.  The manager went to get the chips and brought out another dip as the original dip was getting cold.  Ok, so this was good that the manager was willing to fix this.  Next the entree's arrived and the portion's were notably smaller than usual.  The taste was fine but as the prices have not come down 50% it appears that the restaurant is trying to up their profitability by cutting back on the portion sizes.  The time came to leave and when looking at the check I noticed that the bill contained 2 charges for the dip!  Overall a very disappointing experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=200

As soon as tables were available, he went down his list with 3 parties before I had to speak up at the fact that he skipped us.  When we were finally seated, we ordered fairly quick. Too bad that was the only quick thing that happened all night. Our food took almost 40 minutes to come out of the kitchen. I ordered the ribeye steak and baked potato with veggies.

Jonny P.,"Temecula, CA",12,1,,1.0,9/14/2015,"Came in here on a Sunday afternoon. Business was moderate, yet our server didn't really pay much attention to us. First they told us they don't serve some drinks that are being advertised online. That didn't really bother me (I understand that not all franchises carry the same products). So we ordered some other drinks with some appetizers, the drinks came like 10 mins. No straws, no utensils, nothing. Another 10 mins then our appetizers came out, still no utensils.

Our waitress was Amazing (Devin) she came over several times refilling our drinks, she kept us updated on when our food would be out. She was very kid friendly. Our two children said how nice she was and we needed to tell the manager. (Which my kids have never said before) The food was very good with no complaints. I have to rate this 5 stars because of the moment we walked in and were greeted by the hostesses and host to the waitress and then the manager. I only wish we lived closer.

She was very rude!  We were shocked how rude she was about it. We walked to the front and told the very nice hostess what happened and we wanted to talk to the manager. She apologized and said she was not surprised. I walked back into the bar and told the bartender how rude she was and how she should have handled the situation. One of her regulars or whoever he was started yelling rude comments to me and my husband. The bartender just let him. Manager apologized and tried to get us to stay and even come back but we declined. Very disappointing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-corona-2?start=140

My stepdad ordered the French Dip Sandwich; it came out cold and it looked way smaller in proportion than it does on the menu. Speaking of portions I feel like you don't get very much food on your plate for the money you pay. I ordered the half rack of ribs and that was ok size however I only got a small handful of fries from what it looked like. The mashed potatoes were nothing spectacular but they were ok in quality. The time it took to serve us took a little long. There was probably less than 30 people in the restaurant but it took about 40 minutes to get our food. Even with that our waitress, Alexis was very friendly and attentive to us and with the other customers.

Party of six came in for a nice birthday celebration dinner before going to the movies and here is the experience we had ... 1. Drink order- Coors Light on draft - unable to get due to being out!! On a Saturday night at 7:30pm.. WTF.  2. Attempted to order the unlimited appetizers - was told that it stopped a few days ago due to the menu was changing.. well it's still listed on the website I told the waiter.. his response was ""There is a TGI Friday's in Riverside you guys can go to"" and "" I can transfer your bill"". - Nice thing for your waiter to say.. Great customer service.. makes me want to come back!!! 3. Food was ordered and waiter was told that there was a Birthday at the table.  4. Food came out but we were missing a complete entree with a salad.. Salad never came before her dinner .. as all of us were eating I asked for the manager ..  5. Manager came to the table and I explained to him what the issue was and he stated "" I will take care of it"". As we all finished our dinners and the missing entree and salad was still NOT brought to the table !! We told our waiter to forget the food and to take it off the bill!!  6. Manger finally came out with a salad and a bowl of 6 shrimp!! Which is NOT what was ordered!! We told him to take it back.  The waiter never came to us to let us know what was going with our food order or to see if anything else as needed like a drink refill but did come to ask if we were ready for the bill!  I told him to give the bill to the manager to pay!!   Birthday celebration- the waiter NEVER had anyone come to the table to sing !!!

The only reason why I'm leaving a review is because the food was not good. We've gone to other TGIs and the food was good but we were disappointed with the food here. I ordered a medium rare New York steak with shrimp and you could barely cut through the steak. It tasted like steak that was pre-cooked or boiled put away and then cooked again. I felt like I was eating microwaved leftovers. The shrimp looked like it was just reheated. They got my wife's sides wrong and promptly replaced them but did not even clean the plate.  My daughter's food was good and the dessert at the end saved the day. But I wish I could say I enjoyed my steak branded by NBA Spalding. If there was an ability to put a sad or crying emoji I would.

Well the prime rib I could swear was not prime rib, I know cause I had prime rib last week and since when is prime rib skinny flat piece of meat? My New York steak was like a flank steak and we did not order both steaks to be cooked Well Done. .Even Corkys serves a better piece of steak where it melts in your mouth. Our waitress Harly (sp?) was great, a little busy, but really nice and she tried to refill coffee but she had a few people to tend to. But just a lesson learned, You don't get anything free and if you do, won't be a free Prime Rib or New York Steak.

She greeted us she was nice..but no apologies. Got our drinks quickly.  Then Took awhile to take our order.  We watched the male manager (blue long sleeve shirt) talk to a bartender while she was eating out of a togo container then watched our server help herself to some of this same food as well while she was at the cash register. Crew should be eating in back not in front of guests. No washing of the hands.  Genevieve our server was just too busy.
