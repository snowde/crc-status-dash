Matt M.,"Florence, KY",26,234,4848,4.0,6/10/2017,"This was still a solid location with good service. I had heard about their $10 endless appetizers so lets check it out... Endless Appetizers  What Is It: As I said this was their $10 endless appetizers special. Options include meatballs,  fried pickles, boneless wings (I got the bbq and buffalo versions), potato skins with bacon and cheese (I got those too), bbq flatbread, potstickers, and mozzarella cheesesticks (and I got these.) Presentation: They bring these out one plate at a time (sometimes 2 but they prefer you get one at a time as not to waste.) Everything looked delicious and ready to devour.  8 out of 10 Taste/Final Analysis: This was all really good stuff. The two flavours of boneless wings were excellent. I think I liked the buffalo style a bit more than the bbq as it was a good, tasty sauce. The cheesesticks and potato skins were really good and about what you'd expect from each. This is definitely a good way to spend $10 as it can go a long way especially if   you're like me and have a big appetite.  8 out of 10",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crestview-hills
Amanda H.,"Cincinnati, OH",98,166,477,2.0,4/17/2017,"Let me preface by saying I love fridays. It's one of the few chain restaurants I visit. I've just always had less then stellar food at this particular location. When I worked in Kenwood I would eat it once a week and never had a problem. But the one in crestview I've been twice and haven't liked my meal both times. Today I went with my family and got the jack Daniels sliders. They were so over cooked they were well done. And the piece of cheese on it was so minuscule as well as the caramelized onions. I thought it was nowhere to be found so I had her bring out a side of it. And the potato skins looks like they were premade and were sitting out. The cheese and potato wasn't hot and had that oil look to it. The service was good as it was last time. We should've sent the food back but I didn't. So part of it was the fact that we didn't,  just really disappointed with the food again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crestview-hills
Lauren C.,"Florence, KY",61,51,1,2.0,9/18/2017,"There's a pretty solid reason I don't come to Friday's. The food is always disappointing. I came recently for their endless appetizers, thinking, you CAN'T screw up appetizers! If you can, however, that's a major problem. Unfortunately they can't even get those right. I understand it's a chain, so it's a little harder to review, but they just keep lower their standards. The mozzarella sticks were yummy, which is why I gave the two star rating. Mozzarella sticks are a staple in my life, so at least those were good! Otherwise, the appetizers aren't worth the price and they really aren't worth going for the endless amount. The waitress was also in an awful mood, which didn't help the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crestview-hills

Jeffrey S.,"Covington, KY",8,15,,2.0,12/5/2017,"We haven't been to Friday's in a couple of months and really had been craving it. We've never had a problem with the food here, slow service yea, but the food has always been delicious. Well it seems like they have completely changed their way of cooking everything. I always get the parmesan crusted chicken with mac n cheese and tomato mozzarella salad. The mac n cheese is completely different than it used to be and not in a good way, the chicken was barely crusted at all on top and none at the bottom and incredibly dry.  The tomatoes were like they'd been sitting in liquid too long. My wife ordered the same as she always gets which was the Bruschetta chicken pasta, which was always amazingly delicious. This time it tasted more like spaghetti and wasn't the same at all. Needless to say now this turns from one of our favorite restaurants to a restaurant we will think twice about returning to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crestview-hills

Mike D.,"Walton, KY",0,12,,1.0,3/5/2017,"I ordered the grilled chicken Caesar salad for lunch today. The salad was brown and wilted and the chicken had a rubbery texture like it had been thawed and frozen multiple times. While the meal was bad, it was the restaurants reaction that is prompting this review. I complained to my server and he shrugged his shoulders and said "" that's too bad"". I then complained to the manager and he asked me if I had said anything to my server. I responded that I had spoken to the server and the server did nothing to correct my meal. The manager replied ""that's good have a nice day."" I would never go to this restaurant again. If your meal is to your satisfaction everything is great, but if it is not you are on your own. I would recommend going to the Applebee's next-door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crestview-hills

I went to Friday's for lunch today and it was great because we didn't have to wait for a table at all.  Our waitress was very nice and had great patience with my daughter. She brought our drinks quickly and our food also came pretty fast.  I had the Jack Daniels chicken which was good. The mac and cheese was my favorite part of my lunch though.  All around I had great lunch and the service was very good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crestview-hills
Yank D.,"Florence, KY",0,12,1,1.0,3/2/2017,"Endless apps....Cold food that apparently sat in the kitchen for a while. Very bland.

Mikey M.,"Newport, KY",76,21,555,2.0,7/29/2015,"I didn't like it. I just didn't. The service was good, the spaghetti wasn't bad, but I'm still really disappointed. For starters, the drinks were awful, I don't know what the culprit to that is, but I tried a coke and a lemonade, it had to be the water line.  The noise was unbearable, the sound of people talking over more people added up.  Finally, while the spaghetti wasn't bad, the portion was laughably small. I ate it in 30 seconds, and it was 'spread out' over the plate to make it look larger. Plus it was $13... Again, the only real upshot here was that the service was pretty good... But that's not enough to make me go again...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crestview-hills
Robert S.,"Florence, KY",3,81,17,3.0,11/1/2016,Food is good. Service is ok. Don't eat outside if you are bothered by cigarette smoke. Can't believe any there are still restaurants that still allow it. No Smoking signs on the front door is misleading. We ask to sit outside to eat and were seated. After we sat down two gentlemen were smoking away. I ask the hostess if smoking was permitted. She said yes. Had to move inside. Server said we could move back when the smokers left. Didn't happen. Nobody smoked while we were by the window.  Friday's: Either you are a smoking restaurant or you aren't.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crestview-hills

Lisa M.,"Crescent Springs, KY",69,147,38,3.0,9/22/2015,"Used them for catering. Ordered Bruschetta pasta, Cajun pasta, ribs, and club sandwiches. I cooked a ton of food before and I am glad I did bc this food was just ok. I knew what to expect but was still bummed.  I told them not to have pasta ready in advance just sitting there, instead have it ready at pickup at 5pm on a Saturday. When I arrived at 5 pm the pasta was dry (bruschetta). The Cajun pasta was bland and boring. I asked if the pastas came in a shallow tray for chafing rack they said it did. I am glad I didn't trust them and bought my own. It came in the deep water pans used in chafing tray, although I'm not sure why bc the pasta only filled up 1/3 of the pan. I just transferred the pasta into the appropriate size tray and sat on water to keep warm. Moving on...Club sandwiches were ok and so were the ribs. My complaint with these two items is that I specifically asked for the ribs to be cut into two bone sections instead of their standard 4, and they did not do that even though they promised. I also asked for the sandwiches to be cut down into smaller bite size pieces and they did not do that, was still the normal standard catering size. Their menu prices are higher than was is advertised on their catering menu online and they do deliver but for a charge of 25 bucks which was a shock bc initially the woman on the catering end said that for anything over a $100 would be free delivery. Probably wouldn't use them again bc the pastas were sitting there for at least 45 minutes to an hour. Bummer",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crestview-hills
Angie R.,"Liberty, MO",0,26,3,3.0,1/21/2017,"Ordered the bourbon barrel chicken with macaroni n' cheese and tomatoes and mozzarella. While the chicken was tasty it was a REALLY small serving, my guess would be 3 oz. The mozzarella and tomato were served in a small cup with 3 small pieces of mozzarella and grape tomatoes. The mac n' cheese was the highlight of the entire meal. It was delicious, creamy and appropriately cheesy.  Not sure it was worth the $11.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crestview-hills
Evan H.,"Alexandria, KY",83,4,,1.0,3/12/2016,"I will start by saying I like TGI Fridays alot, normally... this location is a completely different story. I am a server myself and I know good service. I would give zero stars if I could. This is the second negative experience in a row I have had at this location. I promise I will NEVER be back. Not only was I treated disrespectfully by everyone except the hostess and the person who brought our food, but the food was also mediocre.  Walking in we are greeted immediately, not by the GM who was obviously standing there, who looked annoyed, but by a nice hostess. We are lead to not just one, but two dirty tables before being sat at a clean one.  Upon sitting, both my guest and I see a woman give us a dirty look. The same woman turns and says I will be with you in a minute, not a welcome, not her name, nothing. She then comes back and asks for a drink order, no upsell, no actual greet. She brings drinks and walks away. She brings a dessert to the table next to us and insults one of the kids sitting there, with a fake laugh at the end. The table didn't seem to be offended and it didn't even sound like she said it jokingly. It takes a lot for me to be surprised but I was actually shocked.  After several minutes, she comes back and asks if we are ready to order. She grabs the order and walks away quickly. Our dinner, which was all apps, took quite a while to come out. The restaurant was not busy enough to take 15 minutes for appetizers.  We finish relatively quickly and our server comes back and grabs the empty plates and says ""was everything ok?"" At this point I ask for a manager and she's ask why. I let her know that this is my second poor experience in a row and she surprisingly apologizes. She aggressively sits down the plates she picked up from us at the nearby side station and storms out on the patio to find a manager. We sit for almost five minutes waiting for a manager. Finally a guy named Jake or James or something came over and apologized about Ashley, our server. This is the first time I even hear of this girls name. He stood next to us for a while, while our server was no where in sight. He made excuse after excuse about why the service is bad (we had a 20000 dollar dinner rush, she was on a double, etc.) And after the excuses says not that any excuse explains this. He then sits down on a window sill next to us and continues to fake listen and let's us know he will have a talk with her, which I know was a lie. We then ask him how big the sections servers receive here was, just out of curiosity. He said they were down a few servers tonight and our server had a 10 table section... I actually laughed at the guy. He was obviously a BOH manager or something because he had no idea about front of house. Some of the best servers I know, would never even receive a 10 table section. Where was the General manager? Who knows, no where in sight. I asked for our checks from J and not only did he not offer to take anything off for our bad experience, but he didn't ask us to come back and give them another chance. I will be telling EVERYONE I know about this experience and will most likely contact corporate. I am far from difficult to please. I have worked in the restaurant industry for years and I can't comprehend how this can happen, with no remorse from anyone. I am legitimately sorry for the great employees at this location, that are outshined by the lackluster ones. I'm sure Applebee's would appreciate my business, lesson learned!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crestview-hills

Tiffany S.,"Florence, KY",0,19,1,3.0,5/18/2016,"I've been coming to this location for years. I love the food. However , I'm consistently annoyed with the inconsistency of the portion sizes. One day, you'll get a giant plate full of pasta. The next week , it's half that much. Also, takeout portions are generally smaller which is crap. It's the same price.  I noticed that management rotates frequently also. I've had no problems big enough to bring management in so I can't comment on that.  The drinks from the bar are always good. But the same bartenders have been there for years. So it's consistent.  Overall, good drinks. Clean environment. Good food when you get the correct amount. I think I will start complaining about portion sizes if it's not up to par. I don't think businesses look at Yelp.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crestview-hills
Dee W.,"Covington, KY",37,8,,1.0,7/18/2016,"I really miss Friday's. The days when you could sit with friends and eat great American food. Sadly, those days are over. The sandwich list is boring, the salads are gross, the hamburgers are rubber, and the appetizers are overpriced. Bring the old Friday's back.

Shayna E.,"Lexington, KY",46,57,17,3.0,4/6/2015,"I have no idea why this posted twice, darn Yelp.  I'm not into reviewing chains much, but I feel the need to. I've come here a few times and it's always been decent service and food. Our plans got changed last second so we decided to stop in last night. We waited at the door for a good 5 mins before anyone even acknowledged us, it was busy being a Friday and all but someone should always be there or come up the second they see you. We got sat right away luckily, our waitress was very attentive and made sure we got everything in a timely manner. Shortly after we put in our appetizer and drinks order a few bus boys decided to stand right behind my side of the booth and chit chat, loudly.. One of them (he has brown hair and was wearing a red bandana) kept slamming his arm down which resulted in my whole side of the booth shaking, after about 5 times I turned around and said something, they still sat there and talked.. Finally our waitress who was brining our drinks came back, we had let her know and she had asked them to move, they did and actually went and did their specified job... Aside from that our drinks and food was served in a timely manner and how we had asked, only thing not served how I had asked was my side Cesar salad, a few pieces of lettuce had large brown patches on them. Our waitress took it off my tab and the manager was willing to replace it or give me something else on him ( I declined). All in all not a horrible visit and service, but those bus boys really left a bad impression. We will be back, it's a chain it's not always gonna be perfect, but it wasn't enough for me to never return... Yet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crestview-hills?start=20

Several times we've walked in to an empty restaurant and waited over 15 minutes to just be seated or just gave up and left. The service is completely forgetful - most of the time some part of our order is incorrect. I used to just love the chicken tenders here, but the last few times I've gone, they've been dry and chewy and bland. And the last 3 times we've gone - they were completely out of at least two things we had ordered.

I loved their Chipotle Ranch salad dressing and they don't serve it anymore. I loved the breadsticks that came with the salads and they don't serve them anymore! See a pattern here? 2. They don't know how to make a salad. When I go out to eat I always get a salad. For some reason the people here don't know how to cut lettuce. There are always HUGE pieces of lettuce. Also, there is inconsistencies to what they put on the salad. I normally only come here if it's late (because it's the only place open) so maybe the night crew just isn't grooved into salad making.
