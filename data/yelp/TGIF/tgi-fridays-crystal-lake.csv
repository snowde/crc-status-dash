Adam L.,"Island Lake, IL",103,182,158,4.0,8/21/2011,It's a typical TGIF's.  You're not going to get anything special here than what you'd get at any other chain restaurant. Though it get's an extra star since they added the 3 for $12.99 with the vanilla bean cheesecake.  And the service at this one is generally pretty good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake
Erin D.,"Chicago, IL",87,373,7,2.0,2/13/2012,"Ohhhhhh nothing has changed here.  It's been awhile since I've been to Fridays and now I know why.  Its the same meh menu and way over priced if you don't get one of their 2-1 meals.   Service was ok.  Our server was a little snippy.  I get it they just opened but hey, I'm a paying customer. We ordered nachos, which came on half slabs of taco shells.  Nothing really to write home about.  Nothing looked fresh for just being open.     I had the kung pao chicken and it was shockingly not bad.   I guess this kinda Friday's isn't my thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake
Jeff V.,"Cary, IL",1,18,1,1.0,5/27/2012,"Waited for food for over an hour. Manager told us food would be ""right up"" twice. It never showed up. WE decided that we had waited long enough and went next door and ate at Portillos. We would usually go to Fridays a few times a month. Not anymore!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake
Taylor M.,"Wauconda, IL",13,97,,2.0,1/6/2013,Typical chain.  Bad tasting food that is also Bad for you.  Everything is over priced.  The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because the service isn't too bad.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere local like Dukes or The Cottage where the cooks actually care about what their cooking and all the food doesn't come from a freezer bag.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake
Karen S.,"Oakwood Hills, IL",16,23,,1.0,6/15/2013,"Been going to this Fridays for years.  Cooks are really slow, but liked the food.  Today we went and the service sucked, period.  Waited about 10 minutes for Ashley to ask what we wanted to drink.  The food took forever to come out.  Two sandwiches and soup took about 1/2 hour.  Than Ashley said she'd get me another pop, didn't ask my hubby if he wanted another iced tea.  She walked by us about 6 times before she finally got me another pop.  Than we were done eating and she asked my hubby if he wanted another iced tea.  When we were ready to leave, we had to wait forever for her to give us a check.  My hubby had to ask if we could have our check and she said ""I guess you don't want dessert""!!!!  Good grief, never going back to Fridays!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake
Mandi S.,"Chicago, IL",15,55,,5.0,12/23/2011,"friendly staff, quick delicious food. First time at a Fridays it was pretty good experience, I would go back again. The pink punk cosmo was served table side, a cup with cotton candy and than the liquor poured over it, fun demonstration and so yummy going down",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake
peter b.,"Crystal Lake, IL",25,5,,1.0,5/11/2013,Worst service we sit down and wait for the waitress we put in our drink order then we place our dinner order I order the pick two and Colleen orders an appetizer and chicken fingers and Ellie gets a burger well it takes forever for Colleen and me to get our appetizers when hers is just pretzel sticks and cheese and mine is a flat bread pizza well when we get the apps we don't get any appetizer plates so Ellie and Colleen are eating their appetizers off of napkins. This Fridays used to be awesome with service and food looks like its gone down in the quality of service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake
Alexis B.,"Las Vegas, NV",72,4,,2.0,12/3/2011,"A friend and I went in there one night at like ten thirty. The door said opened until one. We were like okay, plenty of time, that's pretty cool. When we got in there was a couple getting up, and us. That's it. The bartender was pretty rude, rushing us, kind of bothered by us almost. . My friend and I work at a restaurant, we know how it is, but he had zero patience. The only time he stopped to talk to us was when we initiated conversation. The food was great, the service makes the meal. I was highly disappointed in the service. Our job is tough, sometimes it gets boring, people get frustrating, but you will never see me without a smile on my face, and a great attitude in front of my guests. This is our job. Just sad to feel that rushed, and unwelcome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake
John M.,"McHenry, IL",13,10,,2.0,1/16/2012,"This was the 3rd time we have visited this place and it might be the last. The food was OK. We did like the different combo meals (3 for 12.99, 2 for 10.00). The drink my wife had was very good.     We arrived at 5:30pm with 4 people and they were no busy by any means, maybe 10-12 tables w/ people. It took about 5-10min for the server to greet us. It took another 5-10min to receive drinks and then they got mixed up. We were undecided about what to have so she said that she would be back in a couple minutes. Meanwhile she took another tables order and disappeared for 10-15 minutes. She came back took our order and disappeared again. I was thinking she would be back in a couple minutes with our salads but that took about 15min. Meanwhile the other table was served their dinner. About halfway thru our salads, the entrees arrived. As we ate dinner she brought refills and mixed them up again. Just before we were done eating the other table got up and left. We finished and she cleared the empties, then told my wife she would bring her dessert. That took another 10min to get a piece of cheesecake. It took a little while to get our check, pay and leave. So we ended up leaving at about 7:10pm. It took 1hr 40min for a dinner for 4 people that should not have taken more than an hour.    I am not sure if we will make it back, but the food was decent and the drink was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake
Franklin D.,"Indianapolis, IN",360,781,166,3.0,5/3/2007,"It's just what you think it is. The teen-aged waiter was smiling so hard tonight I thought he was going to pull a neck muscle. He was acting like every decision I made was just so darned important. Kinda made me chuckle. They have a ""smaller portion"" section of the menu that is not loaded with salt and grease. Unfortunately they also took out the flavor. I don't expect my steamed broccoli to taste like much more than all the vinegar I can douse it with (my favorite way to eat it) but I also asked for a side of rice...kinda dry and boring even though it was supposed to have some carrots and onion stir fried in with it. At least it wasn't soaked in oil. The broccoli and two skewers of shrimp were like $8 or $9 I think.  All the stuff on the walls kept the kids entertained while we waited for our food. Sometimes there is nowhere to park because there is a Portillo's next door and it's always crowded.  The bar is separated from the main dining area by  a big wall but it's open on both ends so it gets smoky in there sometimes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake
Diane T.,"Crystal Lake, IL",0,2,,4.0,3/11/2012,"Husband and I have been here 3 times and had consistently good food and service! Most recently had the the Mediterranean chicken kabob with cucumber tadzhiki sauce - delicious.  Came with rice with red peppers and parsley as well as moist PETA bread slices.  Husband ordered the Dragonfire salmon and enjoyed it a lot.  Great ultimate margherita, (although the $8 price is high), but my husband ordered the very reasonably priced $4/glass Barefoot Cabernet which evened out the cost.  We will definitely be back for another enjoyable meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-crystal-lake
