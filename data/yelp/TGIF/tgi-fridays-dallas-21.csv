John W.,"Marion, IA",27,106,168,5.0,11/10/2017,Great early morning breakfast choice after a way to early flight in from Waco. Beth was providing friendly and attentive service while taking care of the bar. My cup of coffee stayed filled. The steak and eggs with bacon were really good. Seasoned just right. No salt and pepper required. The whole grain toast was quite tasty too. The steak was cooked to my liking and hit the spot. The bacon was crispier than I prefer but not too crisp. Can't complain. I usually find TGI Fridays to be a safe food choice at airports but this one had outstanding customer service for an airport.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dallas-21
Jon C.,"Midway, GA",27,2,,1.0,11/12/2017,"25 minutes!!! That's how long I was sitting there and still NO sign of my server! Several other servers noticed me sitting there and asked if I'd ordered and it only took 10+ minutes for the manager to come by to take my drink order. At 15 min the squirrelly little server finally dropped off my drinks without ANY apology, without noticing how upset I was, and without taking my order. Another TEN MINUTES passed with me staring as my ""server"" waited at every other table - including people who were seated after me.  I am a frequent business traveler and USED to frequent this establishment but no more. I've deleted my Friday's app and will NOT be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dallas-21
Roxanne B.,"Airdrie, Canada",12,112,10,4.0,7/31/2017,"Being at DFW airport for a while before our flights we were in search of a decent place to eat and grab a glass of wine when we saw a listing for TGI Friday's. Yay! I haven't been to this restaurant since my Hub's and I were in Japan. I love the consistency of this chain!  Although super busy we didn't have to wait for a table. The service here was really efficient (I guess you would have to be at the airport) both our server and the food were quick. Unfortunately our server didn't have much of a personality, but that is ok when everything else is firing on all cylinders.  I had the Sirloin with Jack Daniel's glaze. The glaze was awful and all over everything! I asked our server for a side plate and managed to scrape the glaze off my steak and put it on the side plate. Our server walked by about 10 times and didn't ask or say anything. Then a Manager came walking by (must have noticed the multiple plates in front of me) and stopped to ask what was happening with my situation. I told her and she immediately apologized and replaced all the side items without the sauce.  I would totally go back next time we are at DFW, just wouldn't order the same thing.  P.S. There is only 1 TGIF's at the airport and many terminals. It takes no time at all to transfer terminals on the tram.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dallas-21

Jay B.,"El Paso, TX",66,221,325,4.0,11/8/2016,"I haven't been to a TGI Fridays in years; not since like, the early 2000s or something like that. Imagine my surprise to discover that...yes...they do indeed serve breakfast. And a pretty decent one, I might add. At first, I considered ordering the traditional scrambled egg breakfast. Then I thought, ""Screw it! Give me the artery clogging delectation known as the Ham & Bacon omelet! YOLO!"" (okay, I didn't actually say ""Yolo"" out loud, but I was thinking it pretty hard) The omelet had a presentation I'm not used to seeing. It was flat. Literally. Like...the omelet was possibly the flattest omelet I ever laid eyes on. And even though the omelet was flatter than the plate it was resting on, it definitely didn't TASTE flat! The eggs were surprisingly well seasoned with a buttery aftertaste. The reason I say surprisingly is because normally these types of chain restaurants are scared of putting any seasoning in their menu items. But this...was a refreshing change of pace. Also got a side of homefries and they were...alright. Typical for a casual pub such as this. Oh, ya know these guys serve alcohol in the morning? Ch'yeah! Right off the bat, the waitress wanted to get my colleague and I drunk apparently. It wasn't even 9:00am yet. Now, I'm not opposed to the occasional mimosa with my breakfast. I just thought it was funny and unexpected. Only complaint I have for this location is the pricing of food. Breakfast really shouldn't be all that expensive unless we're eating, like, Chef Ramsay style food here. To put it another way, my side of homefries was $3 and they were average. Not great, but not terrible either. I just don't see why sides here are $3. I estimate my colleague paid about a dollar per slice of bacon he had.  The coffee was decent enough for what it was. All in all, I was surprised at the quality of food I got. Not a bad spot to visit if you happen to have a long enough layover to facilitate extended casual dining. Hey, it beats fast food, amirite? I'm giving TGI Fridays' breakfast: Airport Edition...4 happy hour beverages before noon out of 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dallas-21
Madison M.,"Denver, CO",106,210,256,3.0,11/7/2016,"This is a Friday's in DFW Airport, Terminal B. Right by the Skylink exit. There are not a load of sit down food options in Terminal B since that Terminal is still under major construction in certain areas so this is a good option if you're looking to sit down for a bit. This location is clean and quick. The rating is 3* which I believe is just like Yelp says - A-OK and that's what Friday's is, A-OK. The service is fast and the food is hot. There are plenty of servers so your drink will never be empty.  It would be nice if the location has more power ports or places to charge phones.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dallas-21
Gilles B.,"Montreal, Canada",11,3,9,4.0,6/22/2017,Very good and efficient! I asked to have a table with access to a plug and it's been offered without any problem. Smiling and very fast service.

Alesha S.,"Lincoln, NE",313,117,495,2.0,1/10/2017,"I would give 4 stars for service, and 1 star for the food. I ordered the California Chicken Club sandwich, which was supposed to be grilled chicken, smoked Gouda, avocado, lettuce, bacon, aioli, and tomato on a baguette.  The sandwich smelled of bleach, and I narrowed it down to the bottom bun...it tasted weird and I ended up just removing it. I substituted truffle aioli for the normal one it was supposed to come with, and that was a mistake. The truffle aioli tasted strongly of chemicals...Anthony Bourdain would tell me it serves me right for ordering something with truffle oil in it (read Appetites...amazing!). The chicken was cold, and seemed old. It was crusted in some kind of red pepper flakes, and was rubbery and gross. The sandwich was topped with an unripe tomato and chopped romaine. The avocado was actually fine, and I scraped off the aioli and ate that with a fork. The bacon and Gouda were both cold.  I expected a freshly-grilled chicken breast with a melty slice of Gouda and warm crispy bacon, and I was super disappointed. If the menu indicated everything was cold, it wouldn't have been such a shock. Or the chef needs to actually cook things to order like a normal restaurant.  Super disappointing. But the waiter was attentive, and there's a Red Mango across the hall. So there ya go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dallas-21
Jennifer W.,"Plano, TX",590,1054,544,5.0,11/10/2016,"This place has more seats than most of the restaurants in the airport and it was comfortable to spend a couple of hours when my flight got delayed.

This place is a standard TGIF.  I had a tasty Jack Daniels burger with a side salad.  Overall, we spent about 40 minutes on our meal.  Not too bad before our flight and much better than waiting in the gate area.

Jessica H.,"Dallas, TX",300,224,491,5.0,7/7/2016,"I feel that when you rate a place you rate it compared to its equals - not a shack on the side of the road compared to a 5 star steak house.  That being said - this TGI Fridays was above and beyond my expectations. I arrived about 2 hours early for my flight like a good little girl and the security line looked line the line up for my hand in marriage - noneski. So I breezed through without even a pause in my step. First thing I see off the security area in B terminal is TGI Fridays. Ok why not .. I have nearly a hour and half to spare and have not had dinner. Jen in the bar is awesome. Super friendly and kept checking in on me during my meal. I started with a Sangria Rita which was strong but not to my taste because I don't care for red wine but still good. I did he sizzling chicken and cheese which was very moist and tender. The potatoes could have a bit of improvement as they looked kind of processed but still tasted good.  I then did the whiskey cake and peach sangria for dessert - I had a long time to wait, ok?! The sangria was delicious and whiskey cake was pretty good. Not as good as the one from the Restaurant, Whiskey Cake but still good.  Overall, great and friendly experience - Jen is awesome and food was really good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dallas-21

Vicki M.,"Claremont, CA",309,28,27,3.0,6/7/2017,"This TGI Fridays had decent food for an airport restaurant at an expectedly high price. I ordered the chicken caprese salad to-go and it was a sizable portion, but the quality wasn't amazing. It did satisfy me amidst a long day of travel, but in terms of the food itself, the chicken was pretty dry and old, and the flavors were not great. It was a decent variety of ingredients for a salad, unlike the unfortunate salads which basically only have lettuce, but nothing seemed super fresh. Overall, this was a quick, alright meal but nothing spectacular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dallas-21

Maggie X.,"Phoenix, AZ",121,384,4865,3.0,10/19/2014,"As far as chain-restaurants go, especially in airports, this location isn't too shabby.. but it is quintessentially still airport food. I had missed a connecting flight because the first flight was tardy and the second left early (argh AA!), so I had some time to kill before the next flight I was hoping to board left. Service was very efficient and friendly, with the manager even coming around to check on the food and service.  French toast (kid's size): ( ) The French toast here was surprisingly.. decent. It doesn't cross the border into some of the best I've had, but I've definitely had worse, and it came out piping hot with a good amount of egginess. Plus the kid's size was just right, both in pricing and in portion.  Veggie omelet with whole wheat toast: ( ) Maybe I shouldn't have opted for the veggie option, but I wasn't feeling too carnivorous after a red-eye, so I thought vegetables would settle more easily. My biggest gripe with the omelet was how much butter went into it and how in-your-face obvious the butter taste was. It was just too much to stomach, and I barely took a few bites before deeming it a lost cause. The vegetables inside were fine for the most part, except that I'd never had broccoli in a veggie omelet before and it was a little strange in texture. I probably would have just preferred some onions or tomatoes instead of the broccoli and bell peppers that dominated. The overall omelet definitely came off as more of a scramble.. or an interpretive art form version of an omelet.  To me, airport restaurants are in a sector of their own, and TGI Friday's earns a ""not bad"" in my book. At least the food was hot, the service friendly, and the prices not outrageous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dallas-21?start=20

Without missing a beat, she cheerfully offered ""I can make sure it is.""  Please understand that on the day of my visit, I had been awake since 4 AM. To be offered such inventive and welcome problem solving is nigh on a godsend.  For my appetizer, I elected the mozzarella sticks. The hot marinara really worked well with the sticks and I quickly drained my first tub. Again, without missing a beat, my server offered me a refill (which I initially rejected as I though I didn't want / need it). It was not 2 minutes later, but she saw me scooping out the remnants of my first serving. This time, she asked if I was sure (about not wanting more marinara). Despite my embarrassment, I relented and happily accepted a refill.  At every point during my meal, I felt well cared for (without ever being made to feel rushed or harried). Everyone takes the time to complain. I wanted very much to take the time and sing the high praise for this location and my saving grace: my server.

Allison P.,"Austin, TX",464,619,176,4.0,9/26/2012,"First off, totally weird that I am reviewing a TGI Friday's. Even weirder? That I am reviewing the TGIF Fridays in Concourse C of DFW airport. I wish I had my waiter's name, because he was easily the best waiter I've ever had in any airport ever! I sat down for lunch and a beer while waiting for a flight. When he approached me he asked where I was traveling; I replied with ""Nashville."" He then told I had about an hour until that flight boarded, just enough to eat and maybe have a beer or two (I opted for just one beer.) After taking my order, he greeted the table next to me and asked where they were traveling to. When they said, ""Boston,"" he knew exactly how much time they had to sit and eat until their flight boarded. Amaze-balls. I'm always surprised when eateries in the airport seem to have no idea that people could be in a hurry to get somewhere. *cough* Baltimore McDonald's *cough* So I give major kuddos to this waiter who has seemed to memorize all the flight schedules and helps passengers get on their way after eating and/or drinking.
