Bruce M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,4,,1.0,12/22/2016,"I was staying at the Residence Inn next to this restaurant and decided to have take out.  I ordered a burger and tomato with mozzarella cheese salad.  The order was sitting at the bar when I walked in.  Took it back to hotel (mind you, just steps away) and burger was cold and dry.  The tomato with mozzarella cheese salad was tasteless with two (2) small pieces of mozzarella.  Needless to say, beyond disappointed.  Won't return again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=20
E. M.,"Beverly, MA",37,54,10,2.0,7/9/2015,"One good part about my visit was the price of the food and the actual taste. The appetizers tasted really good. The sliders were so flavorful!  service was horrendous though. Took a good 10 minutes to be offered a drink or even a menu, which was pretty sad since we sat at the bar and about 2 feet away from the POS.  also, all the tv's are connected, which means that you can only broadcast 2 or 3 channels at a time, lame. Also, the tv's could use an upgrade. One was so damaged that it only showed a black and white picture.  I will probably try them again and sit out on the patio and give the service another chance. Oh and I went on a slow night where there was definitely enough staff coverage.  oh and the $5 citrus raspberry cooler was sooooo good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=20
Joshua C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,2,,5.0,1/25/2017,"Came here late at night, 11pm, with a couple of friends not expecting a whole lot...we were all pleasantly surprised! And we are honestly the most picky eaters ever. I ordered a fish steak sort of thing almost jokingly, to my suprise they delivered just about the best piece of fish I've ever had! Everyone was happy with what they got and that hasn't happened with us in awhile. We're literally always complaining about everything...so thanks fridays for the great food and decent drinks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=20
Dave M.,"Atlanta, GA",59,783,1866,4.0,6/6/2014,"it's really 3.5 stars b/c of the speed of service. but first with the positives. the place was very large and well designed. the hostess was very friendly but a little slow to respond but not a big problem. the flatbread florentine was very good and not salty like most places. it was part of the pick 2 for $10 deal. i got the basalmic chicken. it was good but the chicken breast was kind of small but it comes stacked with romaine lettuce. the strawberry chicken with clam chowder. both were really good as well. the pecan chicken ($11) and shrimp Fridays was good but the shrimp were slightly undercooked. the waitress was very friendly and helpful but a little slow to wait on us but it seemed like service was a little slow in general. the tables next to us remained unclean 15 mins after the party left and it wasn't busy at all. they seemed to have enough workers so i wasn't sure what the hold up was. the speed of service was my biggest complaint but the food was surprisingly good for a TGI Fridays. overall, if you're into chain restaurants this one is a safe bet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=20
Tracy B.,"Everett, MA",159,857,3017,3.0,3/5/2013,"Like Fridays.. .I mean you know what you are going to get when you go to Fridays...  But on this trip it was a litlte special (we were having an Anniversary Dinner) I mean yeah its Fridays we are not fine dining.. .But still..  We get there and the place was empty and I hate when they seat you next to the only other table of people in the restaurant, I know its for server conveinence but I cannot stand it...  The waitress comes over AND OMG... She might have been cracked out, drunk and had a serious ADD, OCD issue... She tried to be nice, but in the first 3 minutes I learned her whole life story (AND I DIDNT ASK)... she just kept over-doing it & it was to the point I wanted to tell her Ok, STFU...  The food was good, the drinks SUCKED... I usually drink wine & am mad I didnt just get some because all you can taste in the Fridays drinks lately is MIX... I hate that...  Will def continue to go to Fridays as its the BF's fave... Just wont go to this one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=20
Evan C.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,3,,1.0,3/14/2015,"Food was ok. Service was horrible though.

Cat D.,"New York, NY",123,279,1538,4.0,6/16/2014,"Came here for a late night, last minute thing.  It was 11:00p and we were desparate. They had quick and great service. No complaints. I had the mushroom bacon burger. Finished everything. Hit the spot. We had the sampler to begin with. Bf had a double pattied burger. He finished that as well. We had blue moon beer also.

Annmarie D.,"North Andover, MA",0,2,,1.0,3/6/2017,"I knew we should have left almost immediately after we put our name on the list (which is a joke, btw, they seat people when they decide to and definitely not the order of arrival). We used to enjoy coming here pretty regularly, but haven't been to this location in awhile. What a huge disappointment! As I said, we waited way too long to be seated even though there were so many empty tables in plain view and we were only 2 people (we could see at least 6 open tables of two) It was a Saturday night so there should be plenty of wait staff, but the hostess repeatedly left her station to bus tables! I asked if we would be seated soon and she said yes but she wanted to clear out some of the bigger parties in the waiting area first!!! (They arrived at least 15 min after we did and our table was clearly ready for us!!) Ok, so that was bad enough but things only got worse! The waiter never brought our water that we asked for twice, the drinks were terrible (all mixer), my husband's chicken clearly wasn't cooked enough, and they never entered the shrimp into the system, therefore, he never got the rest of his meal, nor did they offer to bring any. Their only redeeming act was that they took my husband's meal off the check (which was only appropriate since he could only eat the sides).  Needless to say, we will NOT be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=20
David P.,"Beverly, MA",11,50,15,2.0,12/8/2015,"Service is not attentive.    My friend & I wanted to watch the Pats, somewhere, with a couple of beers & food. He suggested this place. I'm not huge on chains, but didn't want to be one of those people, so we went.  I'd been to this location many times, but not for years. I had told my friend that it may be mobbed, so we'd better have a backup plan. I was surprised to find that, despite a Pats game being on, the place was not at all busy.   I guess now I know why, based on  my experience, plus prior reviews.  My experience was not that the service was rude (it wasn't): it just wasn't there! Slow, or non-existent from start to finish.  No menus were offered; my friend finally grabbed them from the table behind us. No drink refills offered: we had to track down a staff member. Ketchup, for fries, & requested water not provided.  I was having a Jack Daniels burger, & thought that a JD, straight up, would go nicely with it. There was just no one around to take my order. Sale lost! The food was just average, making that the BEST part of the experience. Overall, there is just no enthusiasm here by the staff, so why should anyone be enthused to be a customer?   I won't bother going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=20
Jaime L.,"Lynn, MA",78,18,16,1.0,10/20/2016,My fiance and I had never been to Friday's together we tried the Fridays on Newbury Street also known as Route 1..... and Peabody the staff was terrible the food was cold the steak was a little tiny steak paddy very expensive poor choice in sides to eat .....stressing how very overpriced I cannot express how extremely overpriced they were....bad quality....hungry still from the tiny expensive meal and no refills.... we sat for almost a half hour until the waiter came back and there were only two tables in the whole restaurant that had people sitting an empty restaurant and they did not cater to us being there very disappointed we will never go back.... when we go out to eat we usually have a doggy bag to take home some great food that we can heat up later on we had nothing to take home we were still hungry even after the expensive dessert the steak was so tiny I will never order food from there or dine in there again.... had to rate something and wanted a -1000000 but you have to hit something to make a review it stunk the whole experience was terrible....drink at the bar and watch tv....BUT DO IT HOME....this place is a ripoff,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=20
Andrew W.,"Wakefield, MA",4,17,4,4.0,5/23/2015,"[May 2015] This is actually pretty fairly close to a five. I like the welcome at the door, but the attention does tail off a bit after that.  We had four of us there.   Margarita shaker drink was very good. Appetizers: potstickers (yum!).  Memphis BBQ yum. Unique: Bacon-wrapped jalapeno poppers were great, and so were the warm pretzels with beer/cheese sauce.   Jack Daniels back ribs are totally wonderful - worth the extra. Join the 'stripes' club, it has occasional great deals.  Just make sure waiter/waitress properly credits you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=20
Adam K.,"Danvers, MA",0,7,,3.0,2/5/2015,"Uhh... it was ok. I much the prefer the Chili's Bar and Grill across the street, but this place wasn't terrible. It is definitely is good for families, and has a very nostalgic style. I usually get chicken fingers and french fries at restaurants, and here they were alright. I actually enjoyed the chicken compared to my feelings on the rest of the restaurant, it was rather tasty. It did have an arcade area, but it was closed when I was there or something, so I'm not sure if it's still there.  But anyways, it was an alright restaurant, I've been to much better, but I've also been to much worse. You can TRY it if your in the area, but I'd rather go to Chili's, or Kelly's Roast Beef or something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=20
Katherine K.,"Goffstown, NH",47,29,15,1.0,6/14/2016,"Our server Timmy was terrible. We waited with no menus in an empty restaurant for nearly 20 min before he even approached the table. When e finally came over to take our drink and appetizer order, he ignored half the table and brought our drinks out one at a time. We had to flag down another waitress to put in the rest of our appetizer order. Another 35 min went by in an empty restaurant and no sign of our Timmy. A young woman brought out on plate of apps and nothing else, we watched as Timmy wandered around and ignored us when we clearly had food burning under the heat lamps. We flagged him down again and requested the rest of our apps and some refills. At this point another 10 min went by and Timmy came out with half our lunch, no apps and no refills. 2 of us had no apps and no lunch plates while we all sat around with empty glasses. There were only 4 of us in a restaurant with only 5 other tables and 2 other servers. I'm not one for no tipping but he didn't deserve one, and yet my many years as a server still made me tip the little jerk 12 % when what he deserved was to be fired. He wasn't friendly or helpful. He neglected our table and all our food was either late or cold.

Sake B.,"Lynn, MA",30,43,97,2.0,12/28/2014,Been here a few times... Nothing extra or out of the ordinary. Wait staff are pleasant but not over the top to accommodate you. Food is okay for American cuisine. Drinks are the only thing that would keep me coming back... I find it odd we had to wait 25mins for a table when the place is somewhat empty...and the hostess would seat the larger group before our group of four.

And the staff were all hanging at the bar, having personal conversations and not paying attention to their tables.

Solmaria D.,"Salem, MA",17,14,2,1.0,5/4/2014,"I have gone to this restaurant almost every other weekend for the past few years with my husband. Great food everytime. However, I must agree with the other reviews here by saying the waitstaff is terrible. They take forever to check on you and all of the waitresses that I have had, were terrible. I had pne particular experience with an awful hostess. She was seating us, a family of 4, in a very tight space. I asked her if we could move somewhere else, and she caught the biggest attitude. She then said a few choice words under her breath (an f bomb, if anyone was wondering), and when my husband called her out on it she lied rather than apologizing. I got up with the kids and we left. Havent gone back since. I tweeted a complaint to the TGI Fridays account, and they had a CSR call me about the complaint and said the manager of this location would be contacting me, but not without me calling repeatedly asking to speak with him. Two weeks later I finally got to speak with him, at which point he made an excuse, that the hostess had an ""accent"", therefore I may have ""misheard"" what she said. I was shocked that he would try to justify her unprofessionalism, and told him I myself am bilingual, and familiar with quite a few accents, and I would not have made this such a huge deal if I wasnt sure of what she said. He said he would send us some gift certificates, and he did, but we went to a different location, which was 10x better than this one. My advice? Dont go to this Fridays, find another one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=20

The managers are always kind enough to make up for the rude, unhappy waitresses.  There is usually one or two waitresses that are upbeat and happy to do their job. I was there for my nieces bday and asked them if they could sing happy bday, they normally have a song and bring out a brownie. My waiter told me, ""sorry we can do that no more, it's not allowed, I'll get in big trouble, blah  blah.""

Laurie L.,"Richmond, VA",103,102,318,2.0,11/28/2017,"My family and I had stopped here Thanksgiving night because we had an early lunch with family members, therefore didn't have food for dinner since we were staying in a hotel. The waitress who served us was nice but you could tell she did not want to be at work. (I've worked Thanksgiving before, suck it up). She kind of ranted and looked miserable being there. If you work in the restaurant industry, at least TRY and look happy for a few short minutes and definitely don't show it in front of customers.  Food: Absolutely terrible. I had ordered the broccoli cheddar soup and a garden salad for a light dinner. The salad came with croutons, tomatoes, cucumber etc. The lettuce was droopy and not crunchy at all and the cucumber was so soft. It also was supposed to come with bread and they never brought it. Now my soup was the kicker. I feel like they literally just poured cheese into a bowl and added big fresh chunks of broccoli in it. Broccoli soup is supposed to have little SOFT pieces not huge hard chunks (I took pics too). My parents food they ordered weren't great either.

The service is just OK and the EDM music seemed out of place but my food was actually really good. I got the spicy chicken sliders on the lunch menu for 8.99 with a salad. The salad was a tad over dressed and the caesar dressing tasted a little different than what I was used to, but the sandwiches were the saving grace. Picture chicken and waffles on a sandwich. It sounds strange, but they were small sliders with chicken fingers, chipotle creme, and ghost pepper honey. I will say, it is a tad too spicy for me but the honey made it sweet just like syrup.

Andy R.,"Las Vegas, NV",4,35,9,1.0,12/5/2015,"Alright so i'm a huge fan of Friday's and hadn't been there for years, However after Yelp'ing this location i read the feedback from customers and figured instead of dining-in i'd place an order for pick-up thinking that i would somehow bypass the poor customer service etc. So i place my order at 1:15pm and pick it up at around 2pm. First things first, when i visit a restaurant i expect some level of acknowledgement or courtesy, it seems that in this particular Friday's location that is non-existent; I walked in and stood there right-next to the podium for a FULL 15-minutes meanwhile waiters/waitresses passed by me and none even approached me to ask if id been assisted. After getting fed-up i walk over to the bar and explain to the bartender that i'm coming to pickup an order and she happily assists me. After such unpleasant experience i had lost my appetite, When i get home i look at my order and see that i paid $15 for such an unusually small portion, the plate was literally twice the size and the cooks must've literally taken one scoop of pasta and placed it in the center of the  foam plate without any garnish or bread-stick, extras or etc. the chicken was overcooked and tasted charred and there were only 3 pieces of shrimp in the pasta (i counted).  Overall this place needs some serious management/staff changes or re-training, This entire experience has been upsetting to say the least - I gave it one star because the lady at the bar was very helpful and courteous other than that if i had the ability to do NO STARS i would.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers

I think my problem is that some locations do a great job and others not so good. Well this TGI Friday has won me over. The outer appearance is well kept and the inner decor will bowl you over with the loud red/white/black color scheme. I get the impression that Jack White of the White Stripes decorated for them. I will speak of what I know best, the bar area. The seats are comfortable and four flat screens have each side covered. It would be nice to hear the game or at least have the closed caption on. The beer is iced down and glassware is clean. Extremely important to have clean glasses cause you don't want to damage your beer. The bar maid did a great job of supplying me new glasses with each replacement beer. The food is surprisingly good. I had the Peruvian Chicken with Sweet Potatoes fries. It was more than I expected to fine from a chain and it was very tasty. I would highly recommend it so check it out sometime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=60
Alicia S.,"Boston, MA",61,589,27,4.0,5/24/2009,"Honestly, this fridays doesn't get enough credit. I have found that the outer appearance is very well kept while the host are extremely friendly and always open the door. I went there one day after 10pm and i was confused because they had changed the menu and made it smaller which makes more sense. I had a waitress name Katy who was absolutely fantastic anything you needed she would do. She was extremely friendly and always offered her advice so I suggest everyone go there and ask for her.

I explained that I had my id and could verify my card number of needed. Because I could give them a physical picture of my card. They said no. I called back 10 mins later because I had forgotten that I had the Friday's app and I had my card loaded on it. I called to make sure that location would  accept that method. They said I needed to speak to the manager  and then placed me on a 30 min hold. With in the 30 mins I called the Methuen location  and they  answered my question within 25 sec. I am extremely  appalled at that Friday's mgt team. I am a store manager myself  and I have never been treated with such disrespect from another business establishment.  I kept the calling going for 30 mins wondering how long they would actually  keep me then someone picked up and placed me back on hold. If this is how you treat your customers then you should feel ashamed because as a manager if I ever kept someone on hold for that long my district manager would write me up and I would deserve it. I know they don't care they lost a few customers (fyi it was a work dinner) but they should because it is downright wrong to put someone on hold for that long.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=60

We ordered the Spinach flatbread, potstickers and the green bean fries. 2 of the apps were perfectly fine but the flatbread was a bit cold and strange. We had never had it before and asked the waitress if it was supposed to be cold? Her reply was ""I am not sure I have never had it myself let me check.""

The hosts and wait staff are always cheerful and enthusiastic and the manager always comes out to say hello. Yes, it's obviously not five-star dining, but the food is satisfying. Their signature pitch is the ""Jack Daniels Grill"" which, in my opinion, is a fitting addition to the menu. I wish they sold the sauce by the bottle! Appetizers are always good, too. If you're with a group, try the pick three-for-all. Each appetizer you choose is well-represented on the plate so it should do the trick. As for the desserts, they're nothing to write home about but are still pretty good. My only complaints are the portions, as some of the entrees are small if your hungry. TGIF is best for lunch.

Rich G.,"Peabody, MA",0,13,,4.0,6/30/2009,"During 2 recent visits I've had very good food at great prices. The Mediterranean Sandwich is delicious and leaves you with just enough appetite for dessert. The Vanilla Bean Cheesecake was that dessert, and it arrives in a surprisingly upscale/classy/romantic presentation. If you aren't leaving room for dessert, then go for either the Sizzling Chicken and Shrimp or the BBQ Shrimp wrapped in Bacon. On both visits these items arrived nice and hot, which is such a rarity  - most restaurants seem to deliberately let food get lukewarm before serving it. I don't want my food lukewarm, so that by the end I am eating cold food in which foodborne pathogens have probably already started to multiply. Kudos to this Friday's for serving their food nice and hot, and a pox on the other reviewer who complained that his or her food was too hot. You can always let it cool a bit, but you can't do anything to make it hotter idiot! I am also bemused by the many reviewers here commenting on the exterior appearance of the restaurant. W.G.A.S.???  P.S. To really ratchet up the value, join Friday's Earn More Stripes Program - you'll get a free appetizer or dessert, plus email coupons good for one free entree with purchase of one, plus something in the mail after you've spent $100. It will take you awhile to spend that $100, though, because they keep giving you free entrees or appetizers. Oh, the music is too loud. Stick your head in and note the volume. If it seems too loud to you, too, ask to be seated someplace where the music isn't so loud = to the right, on the side where the Hardcover Restaurant is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-danvers?start=60

We arrived at 7pm and were seated fairly quickly, it was all downhill after that. We ordered the pretzels w/ beer cheese sauce for an app. When the pretzels came out we noticed that the container of cheese sauce looked like it was spilled or from a previous order because there was nothing but residue inside the cup. We told the girl who brought out the food & she said she would get us a new one. 10 minutes go by, & my boyfriend & I are staring at our pretzel appetizer waiting for this cheese sauce to come out. Our waiter, Jose, finally walked by so we grabbed him & told him about the cheese sauce. He said he would take care of it right away. Another 10 minutes go by, still no cheese sauce, & now our meals have arrived. He asked if we got our cheese sauce & we told him no. He never apologized, he just said let me go get it. We decided just to eat our meals because we didn't want them to get cold like our pretzels did. Finally the girl who ran our food came by & we asked her about the cheese sauce, she said she would go and get us some. We are almost done with our meals, still no cheese sauce & Jose did not come by once to ask us how our food was or if we needed refills on our drinks, which we did. Now our meals are done but our pretzel app is still sitting there uneaten without cheese sauce & we were just sitting there waiting for Jose to finally come back so we can get our check and leave. He finally comes back and asks us if we are all set & I told him that we never received our cheese sauce. He didn't apologize or offer to take the uneaten app off of our bill. I was going to ask for a manager but My boyfriend was so frustrated he just wanted to pay the bill and leave.

But, with a great friend of mine, the dining experience wasn't all too bad... not wonderful. But, just tolerable. As soon as I got to my seat, I pushed myself in and only felt this unknown substance on my chair. I have no idea what it was, nor did I really care. But, I rushed to the cleanish bathroom to wash off my hands.  The waiter was nice enough to give us a dance and a shake with his maracas for Cinco de Mayo.  I had the turkey club, and I wasn't at all impressed by the thick sliced Sara Lee turkey on my sandwich. But, it went well with the weak Long Island Iced tea.  Still, I don't have any idea why this whole chain hasn't gone down, and why the parking lot was full by the time I left. There's nothing spectacular, or any true value in what you pay for.

I've been trying to drop some weight, so I had to avoid my normal habit of picking something fried, cheesy, greasy and Yummy! I found some great options on the menu that were marked as under 750 calories.  My steak was perfectly cooked, with no need for any steak sauce as the seasoning was just right. The veggies were fine. Since I tend to drink more calories than I eat, I of course got a big mixed drink. It was delicious! Both of the people with me were very happy with their meals.

The prices of the appetizers are absurd (the prices of the buffalo fingers seem to increase by 10-15% every single year). The last two times I've gotten the Jack Daniel's chicken, it was been rubbery. Gross.  The burgers used to be great here, but the quality changed about 3-4 years ago in my opinion.

It's actually not the burger that is so good, its just the sauce they smother it in and give you on the side that makes me keep mowing down on it. The most recent time however, I decided to step outside the box a tad and order something new. A few of the pasta dishes sounded good but we went for lunch and I didn't want to get something that big and heavy cause it will ultimately put me into a food coma.  I finally narrowed it down to a turkey burger, and I was very letdown. The turkey burgers I've had in the past have been pretty delicious, but this one was not. The burger was WAY over seasoned. Hello chefs, its a turkey burger, not a poop burger, you do not need to empty the bottle of seasoning into the patty to mask the taste. Their fries are pretty crappy too when I don't have that sauce to dunk them in. Service is always ""eh"", nothing great, nothing horrible.
