Rebecca M.,"Tamarac, FL",77,93,316,3.0,7/15/2017,"Needed some to have dinner and drinks before going to the movies at Cinemark Paradise 24 and there weren't many options right in this area. TGI Fridays was right in front of the theater. We came in around 8:30 on a Friday night and it wasn't crowded, at all. My two friends and I parked ourselves at the bar to get fast(er) service. Got our drinks quickly and our food quickly as well. It was Happy Hour, so 6oz glasses of wine were $4 (can't complain about that!) and well drinks were $5. We shared the Chicken Quesadilla and TGI combo appetizers. The combo comes with mozzarella sticks, potato skins and boneless (or traditional) wings. All of which were decent, except the potato skins were a tad tough. The quesadillas were pretty good, better than the combo IMO. My friend got some special burger, can't remember the name - it had 2 chicken wings on the top - and he inhaled it...think he was starving though. To finish ourselves off, we got the Oreo Madness dessert to share, which was okay, but really sweet...a little TOO sweet for my taste. But not bad though. I've been to this chain (other locations) many times before. Service was good, and food was alright. All in all, not a bad spot for quick pre-movie dinner and drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie
Blvk H.,"Hialeah, FL",138,5,,1.0,10/11/2017,"The service here is terrible. They didn't even have a host. I waked up to the bartender and he didn't even greet me.  That's childish. If you're going to run a business, run it right. Simple.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie
Andrew P.,"Hialeah, FL",0,18,,1.0,8/14/2017,Zero stars! How do you not have Jack Daniels sauce! So any dish like the flat iron with jack Daniels or the jack Daniels chicken strips nope out of sauce. This location has been going downhill I don't know if it hits rock bottom yet. This place needs a major management overhaul.  Ps the front door sounds like it was falling apart.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie
Miriam R.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",3,14,6,2.0,1/6/2018,I mean I come here once in a while and the foods pretty good but the service really really sucks! They always take forever bringing out the food.

Geechy M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",101,12,4,1.0,12/30/2017,"Im not much of a fan of TGIF but it is the closes restaurant to Cinemark theatre so i stopped here before my movie started. I must say the service was terrible. I ordered a simple french onion soup and salad and after waiting for 30 minutes the server comes back to tell me that they dont have french onion soup which he could of found that out as soon as he put the order in. The server then asked me if i will like to order a different soup and i chose the broccoli cheddar soup. After waiting another 10 minutes I received my soup with no salad. Soup was terrible btw straight out of a can into a microwave kind of soup. I then ordered the salmon with broccoli and rice, in which the rice was under cooked and hard and with a side of spinach no broccoli. I had to send that back and i dislike having to do that. By the way my salad never came out and that was the first thing I ordered. I then ordered a bean avocado burger which was ok minus it had uncooked onions all over it and i cant stand raw onions it would of been nice if the manager would of asked me how did I want it prepared since she came over to apologize for the rice being uncooked. But i removed the onions myself and ate it anyways because i was starving. I needed to clean my hands and wipe my mouth as i eat and i had no napkins at my table. I attempted to use the ketchup but my table had a empty bottle. The waiter never checked on me the entire time i was there and the place was close to empty. At the end of the day i had to look for the waiter to ask for my check cause he was nowhere to be found. And i was surprise the they actually charged me for my meal after all i went thru. Worst TGIF i ever been to. Wont recommend this place to Trump.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie
Crystal S.,"New York, NY",273,5,,1.0,12/27/2017,"Wish I could give less than 1 Star, but here we are. This was the worst service I've ever received and I like to declare myself a restaurant pro. The waiter Nick was unhelpful, we got here first and was served last. And he kept getting even the drink orders wrong. Literally he brought back the wrong DRINK orders over 3 times.

Eryka R.,"Bradenton, FL",0,7,5,2.0,11/5/2017,"Good if you want a quick bite and don't care about slow/sloppy service and meager portions.  I haven't been to a TGIF in a few years- I can tell you they've fallen off a bit.  The water cup is a jug compared to the juice cups they bring you- I wouldn't mind if it was free refills but at almost 3$ I'll take some good ol' h2o. ( cups taper aggressively towards end and have a 1"" base at the bottom)  I ordered the sizzling chicken & shrimp which was just as tasty as I remember however it was so rationed that I didn't have enough cheese to cover the chicken or my shrimp, never mind the peppers ( onions were MIA ). My bf ordered the Broccoli soup, and he said it was tasty butt the broccoli was hard and there was maybe a cup worth of soup in his bowl. We ordered dessert ( I was still hungry ) the Oreo madness and it was plopped on the plate upside down no chocolate drizzle or garnish.. terrible delivery but it was good.  Our waiter wasn't very much help, inattentive but polite.  Dirty tables all around us, when someone did come by to clean they wiped all the table dirt onto the seats and left it there.  All in all the food itself was good, but the portions and the service were not up to par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie
Jennifer D.,"Clearwater, FL",11,72,157,3.0,2/19/2017,"We stopped in for a quick bite at this location and we were not impressed. The staff was pleasant, but they lack on customer service. There were five tables filled with dirty dishes from prior customers when we sat down; the ladies room was filthy and the staff didn't have timing down when serving guests. When we requested additional condiments and additional apps, the staff was side tracked and we ended up with additional items past a reasonable timeframe to enjoy our meal. We were forgiving, kind and understanding. Someone from corporate should pop in and give some customer service training and tips on keeping the restaurant cleaner. The staff should be concerned with the customers needs. Perhaps then, they would receive 20%tips.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie

Nico T.,"Weston, FL",0,2,3,1.0,9/22/2017,"It has been DECADES since I have been at a TGI Friday and based on today's experience, it just might be another few decades before I come back.  First, we are seated but we don't see anyone for the first 15 minutes. Finally we order. Eventually we get our drinks. In the meantime, several tables filled up around us and lo and behold, those tables get their food. They eat while we still wait.  Finally, the food arrives. Flat iron steak (decent taste, hopelessly over cooked). Caesar salad was OK, but the Barrel Salmon was an utter disappointment. Zero flavor, lukewarm (no surprise really, given how long we waited).  But the best part was the pretzel appetizer. You know, the one that never arrived.  So yeah, I'm pretty much done with this place. Cheers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie

Liza C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",37,115,103,4.0,8/7/2016,"I've never had a bad experience at this chain.   Came in on a Sunday evening and surprisingly was seated right away. I ordered the salmon with broccoli and spinach and it was seasoned, cooked and served perfectly. The only disappointment was with the top shelf margarita.  It came out missing the top of the shaker.  It was obviously not shaken at all and to top it off I asked for the top to shake myself and  they said ""oh I don't think we have one""...

We were the only 2 seated at the restaurant area and the bar had 2 people. Our waitress had a smug attitude from the get go! She brought our food and did not return...flirting with some guy behind the bar. Had to hunt some other waiter down to get dressing for my salad. I could not find ANYONE to give us the check!!! Finally saw one waiter and asked to speak with manager. AHHHH...the waitress finally appears with an attitude telling us that there were only 2 people working....NO APOLOGY!!!

Heather M.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",132,85,18,4.0,5/13/2017,"In reality, my experience was more of a 3.5 star one. However, due to this place getting a lower rating than I think it deserves, I've slightly inflated mine. After being turned away with my vertical ID, I swore to never step foot in a TGI Fridays again. I decided to get over it and get a horizontal ID. I was in need of some reasonably priced drinks and appetizers, and I found myself here. I walked over to the bar and sat down with my boyfriend. It took 5 minutes or so to get noticed, but that gave us time to peruse the cocktail menu. I decided on a Barbados Rum Punch and my boyfriend decided on a House Long Island. I also ordered 2 waters, and reminded him a 2nd time. We got the regular menu and decided on some apps. My boyfriend ordered the Jack Sliders but decided to cancel them in favor of some endless apps. When he put in the request for the order to be cancelled, our bartender disappeared for about 10 minutes and then returned saying he cancelled them. During the time he was gone, my potato skins came out but I still had no water, so I asked a different bartender and he got them to me quickly. My potato skins were good, and had lots of bacon. My boyfriend decided on the potstickers which were pretty good. My drink was good, and my boyfriend's house long island was surprisingly decent. We both ordered second drinks and appetizers- I got the Boba Long Island and Jack Daniels boneless wings, and he got a rum and diet coke and fried pickles. My long island was very good. The popping boba added a nice burst of flavor, and I liked the tall jar it was served in. My boneless wings were OK, didn't really care for them that much. The fried pickles looked like regular fries at first because they were so thin, but they ended up being really good. My boyfriend got a 3rd appetizer (mozzarella sticks) and I didn't taste them, but I think he said they were good. All in all, this was a very redeeming experience. It was the perfect restaurant to just sit and have apps and drinks in. I was able to relax and have good conversation after a long week. I've seen reviews that mention the cleanliness being an issue. I didn't experience that issue, but I didn't use the restroom here. I'm sure I'll come back, and hopefully it will be just as good as this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie

Ray L.,"San Diego, CA",107,122,46,2.0,8/9/2017,"Now I'm here on many different occasions and sometimes you get great service and some times it's terrible so I'll write this review on the average service. First off it's always crowded. At least twice I've come here and joined the waiting list and someone who comes in after me gets seated first. I'm sure we all know that frustration. I've come many time where the workers were to busy talking to each other to ice you attention. The food is average but bc it's so crowded and they want you in and out that they sometimes screw up your orders! For someone with severe allergies I can afford a messed up order. Plus side is there's plenty of parking and I've never had a bad drink here. When the bartender makes a wrong drink or to many I've had them bring out the extra drink to our table so that's sweet of them. Also if you come late at night on a weekday when it is not crowded, you usually won't come across these issues.

He made my little boy Leo's third birthday SO special! He brought us all the food we wanted with out messing up and he was right on time. He also sung our little boy HAPPY BIRTHDAY 4 times!

The sauce came on the side which was pretty disappointing. I prefer my bbq sauce cooked into my ribs. My boyfriend ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp which came at room temperature. I'm sure our food was sitting around because I watched the other tables sizzling chicken and shrimp come out 'sizzling' literally.

We were HANGRY So that didn't help that we had to wait so long for her to come back to even ask what we wanted for appetizer or anything . I had to call one of the other waiters to go get her . She came we ordered ...... Three tables who came after us got their food before we even got our appetizers .  We ordered a drink and that didn't come out til we were half way finish with our entree .... I think she forgot !  She barely checked on us ... We had to flag her down for everything .....  Our bill came out.... We gave her a big bill... She can back with the change in bills but ""forgot"" to give us the change with it ... Wth ? For example .... Just a random number .....If the bill is 41.45 you will bring out 58.55 right ? No she just brought out $58....it's only some change but still you have to bring out the correct amount regardless .....so I was like okay that's weird ???

Francis F.,"Herndon, VA",11,55,5,3.0,5/23/2016,"The food wasn't bad. Which is why they get 3 stars.  Full disclosure - I went in hungry. And I get grumpy when I'm hungry.  I sat at the bar and the bartender laid a menu down and told be he'd have to come back. But, he didn't take my drink order? Okay. That's alright. Maybe he was real busy. But, there was only one other person at the bar. And the bartender was over there chatting with him. Actually, not chatting. More like shooting the shit. Major espresso driven useless shit. As in does Captain America really fly or does he just jump real high?  In the meantime, I was starving and needing a drink. And I was waiting and being forced to have to listen to those two balloon heads talk. 10 minutes of listening to pure shit from Whoopie and Joy. I was ready to start barking like a dog who wanted to come in the house.  So, I got up and started to walk away. And he saw me walking and then started coming toward me as if he was ready to butt buddy me now. But, I just went to the front and the host sat me right away at a nice booth and I had a Coors Light within 90 seconds - saving me from certain dehydration.  I had a burger that tasted pretty good. And then the brownie fat boy thing for dessert - which was also pretty good.  And the whole time I was eating, I could see Oprah and Rosie over at the bar still having their summit meeting.

But tonight made me feel that I don't want to go back to this chain ever again! Service was so horrible, horrible!! Our server JAMES was an ASS! First, when we got seated and he asked what we want to drink.. it was 10 of us, 6 adults 3 kids and an infant (9months) which a total of 10. He was an ASS to tell us ""oh you guys said your 10 but only 9 of you.."" but we just ignore him.. we never like conflict in a restaurant, specially to the waiter who's preparing our food.. but after when the the apps came out (we ordered 2 sampler to share), he sarcastically asked us if we only need 4 plates.. I mean come on!!! Common sense!! How many of us in the table! I don't know if he is that stupid or he is just a pure ASS! He gave us 6 plates so my husband and my sister in law end up eating on a napkin! And when my sister in law asked if the sampler comes with chicken fingers because she got confused with chilis sampler, James told him ""NO that's your chicken right there"" pointing to the buffalo wings where his finger is too close to our food! It's like he almost touch it. It's like he think we're dumb and we don't know what chicken is!. so my husband have to move his hand from our food! Food was ok.. though my ribs came out burn on a side still never complain.. and before we leave the restaurant we ask for a next take out bag for our leftovers he told us ""oh I gave you one already!"" Common sense again. We're asking for extra! Were not gonna ask if we don't need it! He was just lucky because even he treat us like that my brother in law still give him 20%!!

I have come with large groups, couples night and even alone and they have never failed to give us a bad experience.

This was our spot before going to a movie premiere but after so many consistent issues we have decided not to go. I am only writing in hope of warning people to stay away.

This put a bad feeling on evening as this is a totally irrational policy and possibly illegal. Server was fine, just frustrating to have to deal with a totally arbitrary policy.

Alexii N.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,51,,1.0,4/2/2015,"Gross food, terrible managers, forgetful staff. AVOID THIS PLACE- THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER OPTIONS IN THE SAME PLAZA. The only reason this place remains open is because they get customers from the movie theater across the street. It is disgusting, the staff is inexperienced, and the management would rather be getting a root canal than actually doing their job.  I went here this past weekend with a good friend of mine for some drinks and appetizers after a movie. We were seated in the bar area at a high-top table.  To make a long story short, our server was never anywhere to be seen and was incompetent. The table behind us was clearly compromised of employees on their day off and she spend most of her time there flirting. It was very disturbing to watch. Our drinks would have remained empty for the entirety of the evening were it not for a nice bartender who got us new ones He even had to bring our check at the end of the night because we couldn't find her.  My friend even called the manager, (I think his name was Kurt)  over at one point to explain the situation and he basically didn't care. He might have said sorry, his time with us was so brief I don't remember. After telling him the server was never around, our food was missing, and so were the drinks we ordered he said he would ""go find our drinks"" and left. He clearly was miserable with his job and didn't want to be there. Judging by all of the other horrible reviews of this place, we were not the only ones to have a horrible experience here.

Shandi B.,"Davie, FL",70,218,133,2.0,11/21/2011,"I tried to check-in here last night - and to my surprise, this location wasn't listed on Yelp!  This Friday's has been here for at least three years, so I'm not sure why this hasn't been added.  Maybe it's due to a lack of yelpers in my hood?  Or maybe it's because this place is so mediocre it's not worth coming to?  Or maybe it just wasn't worth the effort of adding a business to Yelp? Probably a little bit of all three.  In terms of chain restaurants, Friday's sits pretty low on my list.  It's never a place I go to eat, more the type of place I end up at because the people I am meeting up with are there. This location is right across from the Cinemark theater, so it's a haven for high school kids wanting to sit around and sip on sodas and share one app for hours.  I can't really fault them for it - I used to do the same thing when I was in high school.  I think it's a sort of right of passage - going to mediocre chain restaurants is a just a part of growing up.  In terms of this location specifically - the service is slow. The food is typical Friday's food - it always tastes like it was frozen... I can't say I've ever had anything taste fresh here.  The saving grace is the Jack Daniels sauce - it makes almost anything edible. They have a deal where you get an app and an entree for $10, which if you like the food is a good deal.   Meh. I've experienced better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie?start=60

This is when the meal took a turn for the worst. The appetizers arrived! (DUN DUN DUN). Long not so long story shorter than normal, they sucked. The skewers looked like a 3 year old put them together and then nuked them after dunking them in sauce. And the Jack Daniels strips tasted like they were frozen and nuked.

This job requires a certain attentiveness and customer interaction which was missing. The silverware was dirty especially the forks which had dried chunk of foods on them.The cajun chicken pasta was good as always. The 3 create you own burgers all came out cold and well done. We specifically ordered them medium well. We returned one, and took one home. My father ate the other one due to him being a diabetic and needing to eat.

Jason K.,"Hialeah, FL",0,9,,1.0,5/17/2016,"Tonight with my family and friends I went to TGI Fridays off of Sheridan and 95. The time was 830 on a Tuesday night - 4/17/16....I had one request, being veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, it was to be seated in a corner or against a wall as to be able to enjoy dinner with my family. The host in the front tried to sit me in two different tables in the center of the restaurant which is not what I asked for. There were at least 10 to 15 available tables against the wall already set up for people to dine at not even 4 feet from the tables they offered me. When I asked for one of them they told me those sections were closed and they could not help me. Clearly because they had already cleaned the sections even though the restaurant was still open and they did not want the extra work of having to close more sections. Word of the day, HOSPITALITY!!!!!! Upon exiting the establishment because they could not cater to my needs I informed the host the reason I needed a table against the wall or in a corner was because I was a veteran and would not be able to relax. His response was ""sorry but they are closed."" I had a party of 6 people that would have spent a minimum of $200. That is revenue lost for their restaurant. I guess they need some good management in there to better train the staff. I will never go back. I will also inform all vets I know do the same from this day forward!!!!

Since it was her wish we took the turnpike and headed to this one.  It wasn't a problem, it is clean and not crowded.  Busy, but not crowded.   Once we were seated we decided to share a Berry flavored Margarita.  She got carded (of course) and the server failed to notice the date of birth... it was the day of her birthday.  Oh man... huge fail.  No attention to detail.  (The lady at another place the next day noticed that the previous day was her birthday and mentioned it..) As for the food, the appetizer my little one ordered was so-so, it was pretzel sticks which were good but the cheese dipping sauce wasn't.

I should have taken a picture but OMG that 8oz steak was way smaller than an iPhone 6. When I received my plate I was appalled. I understand the steak was pre-cut and measured raw but it looks like I got the short end of the last piece of the steak. I asked to speak to the manager (Kevin), not to get a free meal but to advise him that there was no way I was going to pay $20 for a small steak with cheesy mash and old brown stained broccoli on the side. The presentation was horrendous. And when asked to speak to the manager he had a blank face supposedly listening to what I had to say. There was no empathy at all. All he pretty much said there was nothing else he could do because it was prepped and measured before cooking. My husband and I and other family members were like WTF. Both my husband and I have worked in the customer service industry for many years and that was not how to treat a customer. Like no f's were given.

The worst. We asked to speak to a manager to why the horrible service on a wednesday at 7pm-9. The place was empty. He comped our drinks which was three beers. Nothing else. We paid for our food. I will not recommend this location or return. Very disappointing",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie?start=40
Beth F.,"Clearwater, FL",7,19,22,2.0,12/13/2014,"This place is okay.. They are obviously having some staffing issues and most likely have a rough kitchen. I'm a manager for a similar chain restaurant, and their Saturday night service was clearly having some issues. My server was either new, or completely over sat. The door was a tad frazzled, not awful, but you could tell they weren't the happiest. They were upset with having to sit a 7 top, when I walked in.  My food took a little while, and I'm assuming a single sell salad really shouldn't take too long, unless of course, your coldside is crashing.   Trust me, we have all had those nights in this industry. Unfortunately, not the best experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie?start=40
Arly J.,"Hollywood, FL",25,256,263,1.0,5/21/2012,we have visited this location several times on a Sunday afternoon after going to the movies and sat at the bar. Both the waitress and the bartendar never have a smile and it always takes us forever to get our drinks and food. It is not busy either when we have gone.  They have a great appetizer deal that runs after 3pm and we usually order a few items. This time it was our nephews birthday and we asked for the brownie obsession and for them to sing happy birthday. One waitress came set the item on the table said happy birthday and asked us if we wanted to sing with her. Very disappointing and the old TGIF atmosphere. I can only imagine how it is when they are full.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie?start=80
Marisela T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",52,22,43,1.0,4/19/2015,"Walk in. I go to washroom and I come back and my husband says that the waiter (Brian) handed him the squirt bottle to spray the table while he wipes?sitting here for 30 minutes. Never got the correct drink handed. After the 3rd try,  It was sitting on the bar for 7 min. My husband finally got up and picked it up himself. The neighbor in the next table he was also watching this and apparently had to whistle to get his bill and then looked at us and asked if we should  call ""Help Me Howard"" from channel 7. Waiter :Brian never even noticed or has checked on us since. Now 20 min and we watched the bartender with a beard leave a glass under the beer tap and walked away. Beer over pouring all over the bar for 10 minutes and then he notices with the apparent great waiter and we watch them laugh and take their time to throw paper towels on the floor.  Meanwhile the bar and the table next to us has plates of others that have left full of food. Filthy. Finally the food comes out and brought by a very nice man. We ask if we can have utensils.  The wonderful waiter comes by after half way throuh the meal and asks how is everything. I asked for napkins. He comes by and throws down a few napkins stretching his body as far as possible from our table. This is possibly the worst ever service I have ever ezperienced. Unreal. The only thing that came quick was our bill and  Brian never asked us if there was anything else.This may be why I haven't been here in at least 2 years. Now I know for sure it's my last. Had to give it 1 star just to post this.rediculous",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie?start=80
Dann D.,"Miami, FL",3,6,2,1.0,5/9/2015,"Worst Friday's experience ever. I'm originally from New England the Fridays up there Rock!

Ed B.,"Hollywood, FL",64,63,18,3.0,12/5/2013,"Food was decent, drink was actually pretty good...

Marcia B.,"Baltimore, MD",0,64,31,4.0,4/19/2013,Service is always fast and friendly. I'm not a fan of the recently updated decor but the food is consistently decent.

Arcy V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,9,,1.0,3/23/2014,"Let me just say that I live down the street from this Davie establishment.  We received coupons in the mail and decided to give it another try. We don't usually go to  TGI Fridays since time and again we've received terrible service there.  They did not fail us again. We sat for 10 mins. And no one acknowledged us, water was never brought to us and all the while we see 3 servers at the station next to our booth just talking and joking.  Not even when we think the waitress who brought food to the table next to ours was surely going to come to us now, nope she turned around and disappeared.   Nothing sucks more than when you're hungry and are ignored in a restaurant which is not even busy.  We asked to speak to the manager and told him the dilemma and even with his offering a free appetizer we just looked at him and said, ""no thanks"" turned around and walked out never to return again.  For their sake hope their service changes or they will not make it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie?start=80

Stephen C.,"Atlanta, GA",6,3,,3.0,12/1/2012,"Always a fan of Fridays. Not a place I would crave going to anymore, as I used to get quite drunk with my friends at a Fridays in Florida but now it has become a great fallback restaurant. I always know I can go here and sit at the bar with only a few people there and have some good drinks. Anything beyond the drinks and nostalgic feelings from the good ol days (half of which I don' t remember) I would try somewhere else, like Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie?start=80
David M.,"Hollywood, FL",2,9,,2.0,7/27/2014,"This was so delicious, I'm so happy we came here tonight, this food is great, I'm definitely coming here again!   That is a quick list of things I would never say while at Friday's.   I went with 3 other people to try the new endless appetizers deal.  4 different appetizers.  I realized I was in a Fridays restaurant so I tempered my expectations.  You will never be able to temper them enough to prepare yourself for the frozen meal ahead of you.  Mozzarella sticks, pot stickers, boneless wings, and bruschetta.  It would have been great if it hadn't been so awful.  The boneless wings were clearly microwaved.  This is probably a ridiculous request but if you're going to microwave my $10 appetizer at least make sure it's not cold when I get it.  Mozzarella sticks are just cheese with bread crumbs on them but they found a way to make those as bland as possible.  The pot stickers were okay but this is coming from the same guy who thinks H.R. Pufnstuf would make a good father.  I don't eat bruschetta.  My stylist tells me I should but last time I took his advice I wound up wearing the ugliest blazer to my uncle's birthday party.  Now he won't even look at me.  The napkins at the table were the same kind I have at home.  Now I have to get new napkins because every time I look at them I'm going to think of that bruschetta, then the blazer, then the party, next thing I know I'm sitting in the shower crying my eyes out...AGAIN!  Only this time my pen pal isn't just a phone call away to calm me down.  This meal tonight has taken a toll on me physically and emotionally and I don't think I'll ever go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-davie?start=80

Jason C.,"Hialeah, FL",7,7,,5.0,8/3/2014,"I absolutely love this place, I live in Miami and still make the extra effort to drive out to this TGI Friday's because the service is always spot on and the drinks are always nice and strong. You can't beat the Thursday specials $3 Long islands, Margaritas, and Mojitos, and on Wednesdays its $3 martini's and mudslides. I'm almost embarrassed to admit I've become a regular here because its not the most hip place, but you really can't beat the value and I love all the bartenders/servers, they really make you feel at home.
