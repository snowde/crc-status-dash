Virgilio F.,"Charlotte, NC",18,7,1,5.0,10/28/2017,"When you travel a lot, you will find some places that will match your needs! TGI Fridays is one of them. I was two day ago in another TGI Fridays next to Philadelphia and I got the same satisfaction. Wonderful ribs, good beer, faster service and sports TVs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-denver
Annette M.,"Denver, CO",119,447,602,1.0,1/12/2018,My daughter chose this spot on a mommy daughter lunch date.. she had looked at the menu online and knew just what she wanted.. My daughter ordered the loaded potato skins and I ordered the Cobb salad. Both were terrible. The potato skins were under cooked and hard like a raw potato.  The lettuce in the salad was wilted and slimy.  We only took a few bites and mentioned both issues to our waitress who was so overwhelmed that she said she would be right back and NEVER did. I asked another server for our waitress or our check... neither showed up in 10 minutes so we walked out and went to Wahoos for lunch. I hope this places closes soon and is replaced with a yummy and great service oriented restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-denver
Kaitlyn G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,9,4,1.0,9/24/2017,"If I could give less than a one star, I would. We went at 11am for an early lunch.  Two other tables (totaling six customers) were seated in this restaurant. Our waitress came over and we placed our drink order (water, she asked us if we wanted lemon--we said no lemon) and an order of mozzarella sticks. When she brought us our drinks, they had lemons--no biggie, we just pick them out. She then says, which appetizer did you want loaded potato skins or something else. We wanted neither, only the mozz sticks.  We had our menus closed, on the edge of the table for 10+ minutes. Our waitress went passed us to give another table their drinks and get their food order. She walked passed us again, spent 5+ minutes entering the info into the computer. She never came back to our table, so we left.  This kind of service educated me as to why the other Friday's have closed. I will not be back to this one, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-denver
Rich S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",24,69,48,1.0,7/26/2017,"Came in for lunch during work hours.  Arrive at 12:35.  Others seated after us and who ordered after us were served.  We were told 4 times our food would be out.  At 1:20 when we were told again it would be up soon, we said no and left.  Lunch at Del Taco was great.  Absolutely unacceptable.

Linnea A.,"Chino Hills, CA",199,4,,1.0,11/19/2017,"We visited at about 1:30 on a Sunday, where there is happy hour in the bar all day. It was about half capacity, and only one server was in the bar. It took 15 minutes to put our drink order in.  We ordered nachos and several appetizers with drinks, and unfortunately our nachos came out cold and soggy. There is a dip that I believe is supposed to be melted queso, but had more of the consistency of Campbell's mushroom soup straight from the can. The drinks were great, but I noticed a guest from another table had to chase down a server that was tossing towels in the air like it was a pizza instead of taking care of his guests to attain refills. You'd have better luck at the Del Taco right next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-denver
Steve A.,"Denver, CO",4,81,,3.0,5/13/2017,Location:  Good location right off of the road. Easy to get to and park.  Service:  I have only gotten carry out from here so not sure on the overall service but when I order at the bar the staff their has been nice and promote.  Food:  It's your topical restaurant chain food. Nothing special but nothing overwhelming great.   Cleanliness:  Again I have only gotten items to go so I have not stayed long.

Dee H.,"Brighton, CO",0,1,,1.0,12/11/2017,"We came in for desert and water.  This should have been an easy service and tip for our waitress but NO! TGI Friday's only had one job, cut a piece of cheesecake and cut a brownie. I'm not sure why I received warm brownie soup dough with Carmel and ice cream.  When my husband finally interrupted our waitress from chatting with her co-worker to take the mud-pie back, she indicated she ""didn't know"" what was on my plate. I asked for cheesecake instead and had to wait 20 minutes to get that. There were only 4 people in the restaurant so I'm sure they were ""slammed"" in the kitchen. Then TGI Friday's had the mitigated gall to charge me for the sludge with ice cream telling me that it was fine for me to eat!! Needless to say I didn't pay for that mess only the cheesecake we ordered. No tip for chatty Cathy either. Won't be back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-denver

Unbelievably the hostess would not give us a menu to look at while we waited ???Our server was nice but inexperienced. I'm currently writing this review while waiting for our meal, they are bringing out 2 meals every 5 minutes. Ended up being 20 minutes between the first and last meals being brought to table.

Bobby B.,"Brighton, MI",38,99,6,4.0,5/16/2017,"They must have seen all the horrible reviews on here and stepped up their game! I walked in here on a Monday around 5pm, had a really great experience! PROs: - My server thought that I was waiting too long and gave me an appetizer for free. I think I only waited for 5 min after being seated. - This appears to be a brand new restaurant, everything was clean and new. - Location is great! I am staying at the hotel across the street. I realize that not everyone is staying across the street, but the location overall seems very easy to get to.  - The beer was fresh, I can tell that they keep the keg lines clean. CONs: - I can't think of anything really looming for this place. I never really liked the menu for Fridays, it all seems really over priced for what it is.  - There is no local beer selection despite saying so on the menu. Summary:  This was a good experience. If I stayed at this hotel again, I would come here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-denver
Stacey M.,"Golden, CO",8,36,,2.0,1/23/2017,"It was seriously just meh...  Really no other way to explain it.  We found a table in the bar late on a Friday night.  Waitress stopped right away with menus....  Then gone for about 10 minutes.  So we ordered our drinks, appitizer and dinner all at once.  Waitress was very upfront about the lack of appearance with the meal my boyfriend wanted.  Drinks seem to take forever...  Not the bartenders fault.  Finally got our drinks and app....  Another 15-20 minutes before she stopped back to let us know our dinner would be up in a few minutes....  (This was the last time our waitress talked to us until after our meal.)  By then it had been 30+ minutes since we ordered... Yes they were a bit busy but seemed to have full staff....  5 or so minutes later here comes our measly looking meals...  Bourbon chicken...  looked just pathetic!  My burger was just ok.  Cooked just the way I requested.  Our waitress never stopped to see if we would like a refill..... NOTHING...   She wasn't rude but she sure wasn't pleasant.

Khayyam Q.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,26,3,2.0,7/2/2017,"The food is what you would expect from restaurants in this group/category.  What will make or break your experience will be the staff.  Some staff are very kind and helpful.  Others are rude and seem to hate their job.  I have had waiters that were very kind, helpful, joyful, etc.  I've also interacted with hostesses that have been friendly, even when clearly overworked.   With that said, other hostesses have been rude and indifferent.  Recently I called and was ignored.  The phone rang for several minutes.  Thinking they may just be busy, I tried several minutes later only to experience the same problem.  Internet third time calling I spoke with the front desk hostess.  She was rude from the very start.  Even her ""greeting"" was robotic, giving the impression she hated her job.  When asked a simple question her response was ""well you can come in and see.""  She didn't put in even the slightest effort.   While you can have a good experience, interactions like these will be common place and ruin your night.  When I'm paying for dinner out, I don't want to risk a hostess ruining my night.   I won't be going back to this location...but will to others locations with better service since I love the wings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-denver

Bella M.,"North, Denver, CO",30,144,312,1.0,7/8/2017,"The last time I was in here the 10$ unlimited appetizer deal has just been implemented and it seemed like the place was packed with everyone cashing in on the deal! Our waitress, the bartenders, other staff and most importantly the kitchen crew were apparently very overwhelmed and seemed to be running waaaay behind on orders the entire time!!! At one point we ordered drinks and didn't see our waitress again for 30 minutes before we could order food and our drinks still hadn't reached our table by the time she returned. She kept getting confused on who she had seen and who she hadn't and who needed what and who was at one point in their meal so she just gave up and went to the back and started going off to another waitress about the kitchen being so behind! It was a mess! By the end of our time she came over and was very apologetic about the display of chaos in the building and sent us out with 5 boxes of appetizers and the rest of our unfinished meals! It was nice that she was trying to make up for the poor service with food for free and not being charged the drinks on our bill but by then we were convinced that we shouldn't come back! This was the worst I've seen this location but it's just a fact that every time we came here the food was off and the service mediocre so all in all we tried to love you Friday's but it's just not working out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-denver
Danielle S.,"Commerce City, CO",32,4,,1.0,6/6/2017,"I will never go to Fridays at Northfield again!!  The last time I went here, the service was awful and SLOW! Gave it another shot tonight, and it was still ridiculously slow. We went early, and there were less than ten tables with customers. We ordered three salads and a cup of soup. After 50 minutes, we walked out when our server informed us the salads still were not ready. I find it comical that on their website they indicate that Friday's is a great place for a ""quick bite"", yet the majority of reviews complain about how long it takes to get service and/or food. Do NOT go to Fridays at Northfield unless you have unlimited time to wait for your food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-denver
Chance H.,"Denver, CO",424,172,1860,4.0,10/27/2016,"TGIF is Great for groups and has affordable Options for HH, a quick dinner and assortments of appetizers to share as a group. I usually come to this location with a large group of friends from about 7-15 people. It's a quick & affordable bite before a movie or even a quick meal before heading to the airport. We all live near Northfield so this is a convenient location with lots of parking. Service is often pretty good. They also have some quality drinks and cocktails. This is not my fave place to dine but it def is great for group dining and there is something for everyone. I usually get a steak and veggies or a salad. Tonight I tried to get something different and got their $7 pasta. They have an option for 474,  $4 appetizers, $7 entree (smaller portions), and $4 dessert options. I had the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta. It was good but nothing I'd crave.

Brianna B.,"Denver, CO",0,11,8,1.0,4/24/2017,"This restaurant needs to hire a new host ASAP. I walked in with a party of five and a newborn.. From the moment we walked in we were treated with disrespect. The young lady at the desk put her foot out to try and trip a child because they ran in.  Secondly we did not get greeted if she just stared at us and I told her we are here to eat. She looked at me and said ""for how many"" I told her just us pointing to my party she said ""well how many is that"" but she said it so freaking rude. Then She said well ""we're really busy right now there is no table for you guys"" I asked her how long is the wait, she replied ""I don't know, you really want me to sit you guys""? And she was very rude with that comment. I honestly feel like she was being rude for no reason. She didn't look around for seats she just told us it was going to be an hour. I'm not sure what the problem was here but the manager was just as a appalled as I was. She said they would take care of me on my next visit, I don't really care about that this place needs to have either better training or more friendly staff because the way we were treated was unfair and totally uncalled for I will not visit this place anymore. A little friendly customer service and perhaps someone more mature will help the situation. Not a 16 or 17-year-old girl with no manners and a disgusting attitude. PS.

He was cleaning and clearing his own tables to help those who were waiting but also kept his section full.  Which means more tips and money for him I spoke With Steve the manager and he was very receptive and listened.

They only had one server and one cook. We ordered the endless appetizers and when we FINALLY got them they were cold. We never got refills that we asked for several times.

Msi A.,"Aurora, CO",1,41,12,1.0,7/22/2017,"Do not recommend. We ordered the $10 endless appetizers. Some seriously delicious options! You can order one of each at a time. What a super deal after shopping all day in the mall area. I ordered pot stickers and meatballs. The other ladies ordered wings, mozzarella sticks, nachos and potato skins. The potstickers where good. The meatballs were cold. The boneless wings had an odd texture like gristle and fat combined. The nachos never came out and the potato skins where tough-unedible. We tried to make the best of it and order some other options. After 20 minutes of waiting our 2nd order come out. The potstickers this time were drenched in oil and the jack daniels wings were awful tasting. We enjoyed the company and the conversations so it wasnt a damper on our evening. We all decided this deal just wasn't for us and we will order from the menu next time. We asked to speak with the manager but he never came to our table. We settled up, paid out bill and went our way. I later noticed my account had been charged $60 over my bill. No big deal-just call and get an explanation. Everyone at my table but me paid in cash. I spoke with the manager Rob. He was horribly rude. I am glad he didnt come to our table with this awful attitude. His tone was impatient. He cut me off mid sentence to tell me 'thats a lie' because they haven't downloaded credit cards for the night. I was told it was a hold on my card thru my credit card company the issue wasn't with theirs. I explained it wasnt a 'pending' action it was an actual charge. He said he didnt know and couldn't help and hung up. It was his tone and the horrible manner in how he handled the situation that caused the entire evening to sour. The host and our waiter were fantastic. The food was horrible. The time frame it took to get our food. Horrible. We didn't receiver refills on our drinks despite asking several times. This all would warrant a 3 star or I would try the location on another day and time. However, the managers lack of tact, unprofessionalism, the disrespectful tone, and the disgusting customer service from THE MANAGER for the evening is the major reason I do NOT recommend this location and give a one star.

We had a group of about 12, with an advance reservation put in. While it was a Tuesday night, and business wasn't particularly busy, our service was very, very slow. From the time we sat down to getting orders placed to food on the table, I'd say it took about an hour. That's just sad.

Saajan B.,"Burbank, CA",601,4,,1.0,4/8/2017,"I rarely take the time to write reviews, but this location is quite the negative brand representation of TGIF. On April 8th, 2017, we arrived that the TGIF location in Stapleton, CO. We sat down at our table at 6:40pm. We waited patiently as 10 minutes passed. The restaurant was not busy, but we gave them the benefit of the doubt that something may have come up. At 6:50pm, we were a bit frustrated at the lack of service, and noticed another table of 4 ladies got so frustrated that they got up to leave. Finally, at 7:00pm, we got up to leave as well after waiting 20 minutes for a server to take our drink order. Allow me to remind you that the restaurant was not busy. We asked to speak with the manager to inform him of the poor service. He did not seem to care and appeared to be in favor of the ""poor service"" culture. We live next to this location and visit at least once a week. The service has always been bad, and that can be seen by the very low ratings on Yelp, Facebook and Google. However, this experience was the cherry on top, and we will no longer be visiting any TGIF location. The male manager with pierced ears was not genuine and did nothing to save the consumer relationship. If you happen to be here, and this manager is on duty, I would avoid speaking with him. When someone comes into your restaurant once a week, the least he could have done would have been to express sincere apology. I would encourage you to read the reviews for this location on Google and Yelp. The reviews are powerful and are clear that this location is not consistent with brand standard.  It is sad that this location will probably face no real consequences of how they treat loyal customers, but sharing this negative experience with you is worth a shot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-denver?start=20

The first time, everything was exceptional and A-Ok. We had the Macaroni & Cheese filled balls which were so exquisitely delicious. The service was lovely at first and we ended in good terms. The last time I dined here they had a late night atmosphere, where they obviously had most of the tables closed, but the bar was remained open. We took a seat next to the bar and we ordered some steaks. Julie was our server but she hardly attended us. No refill on our drinks, it was horrendous. She only gave us our food and even left. My goodness we had to hunt her down. The steak gave us food poisoning and the next day we reported this to their high up manager. Although we received a gift card, the service lacked justice.

Seriously, you're the manager, you should know. The restaurant was only half full. If you can't keep track of your workers and food times maybe you should install a digital clock to tell you how long an order has been waiting. After I explained the situation to the manager the food starts to come out. I tell the manager we no longer want the food, as my family has already walked out, and all he can say is sorry. He offers to comp the meal and I declined. I asked for the bill but it's only right we had a few drinks ($12). He tells the waitress to get our bill and she decides to walk to another table and start talking. Again, seriously!!! Now the bill was $12.60 total. I give her a $20 bill expecting to get $7.40 back. I went to public school but I think I got the math right. This reject brings me $6 and runs off. Wow, I guess she knew she wasn't getting a tip and decided to take her own. I call that theft TGIF.

Michelle S.,"Denver, CO",109,423,,1.0,12/26/2012,"I used to spend weekend nights at Friday's ever week when I was in high school (in the 90's)I suppose there must be a reason that in the past two years I've been to  Friday five times or less and after today I can say I will never be coming back.  Every time I've been here I have been less than impressed and today was the straw that broke the camels back. Walking into the restaurant was challenging because of the giant group that was seated at the front. I had to squeeze through and I am average sized and I still bumped into both chairs on either side of me. To me this is annoying and a huge safety issue if there were to be a problem inside it is single file lines out of the dining area. Yikes.  We get seated and I take a seat in a chair with my back to the ""aisle"" and within the first 5 minutes of sitting there my chair has been jostled no less then 10 times by people trying to get in and out. Absurd.  Service was the slowest thing ever. A freaking turtle could have brought me my beverage (sodas and iced teas at our table, nothing from the bar) 10 minutes is about 8 minutes too slow.  We all order the lunch special (unlimited soup, salad and bread sticks) Unlimited sounds nice, I usually like to indulge in two bowls of soup (gasp! I know) However we sat around at our table after finally ordering our food and we never saw our server again. It took at least 20 minutes to get said soups and salads to our table and then at least 10 minutes to finally track down our server to get our bill.

I had a side of macaroni and cheese and it was ok, pretty much microwaved cheese on top of a basic macaroni . There was barely any in the dish though.

The food was really, really good.  The disgustingly awesome cheesy bacon cheeseburger (forgive me if I got the name wrong) was like Heaven for me.  The drink I had was great too and I guess our only complaint was that the b/f's Sam Adams didn't have enough head on it.   It didn't really matter, but in response to someone else's review, I didn't find the music to be too loud at all.  Maybe they jack it up when the restaurant is more full?  All in all, we'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-denver?start=100

We were sat by the kitchen, so we could hear every word the servers and people on the line were saying. Our server was Heather, who was extremely friendly, courteous, and helpful. The food we ordered came fairly quickly, and my ribeye was cooked a perfect temp. With that being said, my problems came from ordering one of their slushy drinks, and recieving a small black bar straw that made it impossible to drink this particular drink. When I asked the female bartender if they had any normal sized straws and she looks at me like im crazy and simply says ""no"" I again asked her If they had any restaurant sized drinking straws to drink this with, again, the answer was simply no. Sorry. Now my problem was with her attitude, her lack of caring or sympathy for my problem, and her apparent lack of respect for me as a customer. No ""yes sir, no sir"" was used,  she talked as though I was annoying her and she couldnt be ""bothered"" by a customer since she was so ""busy"" talking to the male bartender and taking care of her empty bar. (Apparently she doesn't realize the turnover rates of rude bartenders) I said ok, walked over to the fast food place, and got a bigger straw.  Why is it that most kids working at restaurants these days have zero manners, no respect for customers, and look like they would rather be anywhere but at work.

If I didn't have a few friends who work there, I would have given the place one star. However, we all have our loyalties. No, you know what? Screw the pity star. We've downgraded to one. That's right. I went there. My personal experience(s) eating at the Northfield Friday's has been not so good. Slow service, food not cooked to order, and even my attempt at getting to-go food resulted in having to wait an inordinately long time before a waitress found the time to jot down that I wanted a sandwich and fries. And when I did get my food? Yeah, cold fries and no ranch on the side like I'd asked. They're a national chain. They should know better.  So, if you find yourself up at Northfield Stapleton and you're hungry and eating on a budget, skip Friday's and go to Heidi's Deli or Qdoba or hell, the food place in Target.

My son had a triple decker burger of some sort he said that the patties were the size of a McDonald's burger and even though he ordered them rare they came out hockey pucks. I had the parm chicken. It tasted boring. My son tried it and said it tasted like an old tire.  The mac and cheese was equally as bad. I poured salt on it to get some flavor. My son is very sensitive to salt and he tried it and said he didn't believe I had put any on it. We did have desert the Oreo cookie which was fairly good but came out with freezer burn on one side. The place hasn't changed much bad tasteless food. I think they lowered their prices cause it wasn't horribly expensive like the last time.

Karin J.,"Aurora, CO",43,10,,1.0,7/15/2016,"Most recent visit (today) is up there on my top 5 worst customer service experiences I've ever had, let alone at a restaurant. You would think on a Friday at lunch time, they would have staffed their A-team (God, I hope this wasn't their A-team), but it felt like their X, Y or Z team. My party showed up at 1:00pm, and was quickly seated, I was a little later arriving at about 1:10pm. When I sat down, my party (only 2 other adults besides me), had their water, and an appetizer came out shortly after. Great! Things were looking good. We all knew what we wanted pretty quickly after I got there, and made it obvious by setting our menus down and chatting with each other. 10 minutes later, nothing. So my friend told the waiter (who was at the computer directly behind us), ""Hey, we are ready to order when you get a chance."" The waiter, Christopher, said ""okay, just give me a second to drop off these tickets at a couple tables."" okay, no big deal, I get it.... he's busy. He then proceeded to chit chat with EVERY table in his section. Meanwhile, a manager comes by and asks every table around us how the service is.... but us. Okay, he'll be back, we'll talk to him them. We wait another 15 minutes, and he comes back to the computer and hears us say something about how I have to get back to work by 2, and he says ""I haven't forgotten about you, I promise."" He drops off ANOTHER ticket to a table, and comes back to get our order. I was a little short with him, as this is my lunch break, and I should be leaving to get back to work in 10-15 minutes.  Then we wait, and wait all the while he is chit chatting with all the other servers in a big group by the kitchen, the manager in there with them. Laughing, and not even checking for our order. My 15 minutes left on my lunch hour is gone by this point, and I pulled him aside (when he was just walking passed), and asked him to put my lunch in a to-go box and bring me the receipt, as I was already late. He says ""k"" and walks away. Then the food comes, but not my to go box for another 5 minutes. During those 5 minutes, NO ONE comes to see how the food is, if the orders are correct or even bring my party silverware. Unacceptable. I know you may be busy, but don't fool me into thinking you are too busy to show us even fair customer service, while you are chatting it up with every other table. Finally  get my food and as I'm walking away I hear someone from my party for dressing.... apparently that was forgotten too. So, now my food is in the fridge at work, meanwhile, I'm still hungry. TLDNR: Do not go on a lunch break if you have a strict time limit at your job.

We were sat right away and the hostess walked away then came back about 30 seconds later and asked for our drinks, so we thought maybe she wasn't the host and was going to be our server. We both got waters with lemon because it was 95+ degree day. We never got the lemons, so I asked again and the girl walked away. A couple minutes later another girl came up and offered to take our order, I ordered the small size of the potato skins and was even on the page for the miniature apps and pointed to it as well, then order my JD burger, I asked if I could have it Medium and she smiled and said yes. So then she leaves and it was about 10 minutes for our app, brought by someone else, we didn't have any silverware still, so I had to ask for that, then another 15 minutes go by and our burgers finally come brought by someone else again. They asked if we needed anything else and I asked for a box for the skins, and a refill on water since we haven't seen our waitress in the past 25 minutes. He takes our glasses, and I cut my burger in half and it is well done and dry as leather, I'm starving and didn't want to wait another 15 minutes for a new beef patty. So I finish one half of my burger and the guy still hasn't been back with our waters, ten minutes later or the box. Finally I see our waitress and say the guy never brought our waters back and she walks away without a word and brings us new waters with attitude as if we asked her to do 100 push ups. She never asked how anything was, and we just wanted to leave and I had to stop yet another person to get that box. Then I had to ask for the check. 5 minutes later I finally got it, and she had put the full size potato skins on the ticket and put my burger as ""no pink"" I thought it may have been the kitchen that just cooked it a little longer, but it was totally her fault, umm, excuse me, but medium has substantial pink to it. I asked her if she could switch the skins to the $4 ones and she acted surprised, Oh! You wanted the smaller ones?! So she just removed them. I gave her my card and a couple minutes go by and I finally got it back. It takes really bad bad service for me not to tip, but in this case I just couldn't. Our server practically didn't do anything for us. I shouldn't have to ask for everything twice, silverware, check, boxes, refills. Sorry but you earn your tip.

The staff quickly got him a gluten-free menu to browse and with that, we were lured in.  The options for my friend to eat were more than just a salad and burger-sans the bun, which was a great change than what we're used to seeing.  The staff was very friendly from the beginning, so immediately, we fell in love. Today was also the big Bronco/Raider game so they were busy, however the staff was very calm and collected instead of rushing around. The prices weren't too bad, typical prices for a chain restaurant, $8.50-$16 depending on your meal. The portions that they give you are big, in my personal opinion.  I couldn't finish my meal, but the quality of it was very good.  The tomato and mozzarella is definitely recommended as a side.
