Jessica M.,"Hope Mills, NC",0,3,,1.0,5/18/2017,"The service was slow. I understand it being toward the end of the night but it took a while just to get seated. I have been traveling all day and was STARVING!!! Servers just looked the other way while I waited to get sat at the hostess station. Took a lil longer than normal to get my initial drink to the point another waitress noticed my server was taking longer than expected.  I ordered a salad the chicken was over cooked, dry and crunchy I couldn't even cut into the chicken in some areas. The mixed greens were warm like they are kept out all day. Even though my salad specifically says it comes with kale. (No kale was involved). My server waited til was done eating to approach me and ask me how I was doing. Yes I still ate it because I was starving and was not about to try to order anything else.  Will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-detroit?start=20

Teresa L.,"New York, NY",250,408,259,2.0,1/12/2015,"During my last trip through Detroit airport, J and I had some time to squander, so we grabbed a quick bite at TGI Fridays since it had the Michigan game playing on its televisions. We were seated promptly, but our food took quite a while to come. I ordered a cream of broccoli soup, which I imagine is microwaved in the back kitchen, and J ordered a sandwich, which I imagine is mostly pre-packaged meats + bread being slapped together.  Our waitress didn't come around again until we desperately needed to grab the check and pay, or else we would have missed our flight. I understand that it's a restaurant in the middle of an airport, so I'll give this location the benefit of the doubt in terms of its food and service. Two stars, instead of one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-detroit?start=20
Mahmoud B.,"Dearborn Heights, MI",0,12,8,1.0,4/7/2016,"I love Fridays and while waiting for a delayed flight I decided I would eat here, and must say it was a horrible experience.  Takes for ever to get food out, which is not the waitress fault but specially when waiting for flights, shouldn't take over half hour to receive food let alone a salad. My waitress, Tracy, was also not the best waitress. Did not check on me once, seemed like every time I needed something I had to flag her down. Ordered a Diet Coke, there was something nasty inside my cup, asked for another one, took about five minutes to bring it, then brought me regular Coke, not diet. Then I had to ask again and she replaced it, but there was no sense of urgency and not once did she apologize for something being in my cup, or for bringing me a regular instead of a diet. I'm normally positive as can be, but I can say that based on this experience, I will never eat at this Friday's location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-detroit?start=20
Rosetta E.,"Sylvester, GA",63,3,9,1.0,7/18/2016,I spent $55 dollars for my food to arrive late because they forgot to put it in left off a salad I said I wanted 3x and when I got it it had BROWN lettuce. The two drinks I tried were watered down and only taste of simple syrup. I tried two different drinks and they both were NOT up to the TOP SHELF standards I expected them to be. Since I am in the restaurant industry I am empathetic but there is No excuse for how my service was done. In the end I felt like they ripped me off and I would really like to use that money NOW for a better experience elsewhere. Next time I'll get a cheap burger,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-detroit?start=20
Charlie H.,"Portland, OR",34,10,5,1.0,1/14/2015,The fries are mediocre at best. Taste like refried cardboard. The burger was charred beyond belief!! I think you call that BURNT!!! Service was okay.

Catherine O.,"Beverly Hills, MI",50,152,5,1.0,7/3/2014,"Even considering that this is airport food, the food here is BAD. My salad had at least a third of a cup of dressing on it and the chicken on top had a really moist (in a bad way) coating of pecans on it. I picked out as much un-drenched lettuce and as many mandarin oranges I could and ate the chicken, which I though was safe. It's 1.5 hours later now, and I have a terrible stomachache -- and I mean TERRIBLE. And I never get sick from food. Now I get to look forward to a super queasy and uncomfortable 2-hour flight. My husband's pulled pork sandwich was ""waaaaay too sweet"" but at least he's not nauseated.  The place is super cramped -- they don't have any extra room or designated space for bags or strollers (like other airport restaurants I've tried) so the place is a total fire hazard. The restaurant smells like bleach, which I guess is okay because that means they clean? Maybe? It's too bad because our waitress was very nice and our food came out quickly.

Mike I.,"Parker, CO",52,75,113,1.0,9/22/2014,"Been through the Detroit airport a few times and have stopped in this Fridays twice with both visits resulting in essentially the same lack of service.  The first time I did I made a vow to never come back.  I stood at the front waiting, and waiting, and waiting...  It was like they had closed and I was completely invisible.  Finally I asked to be seated and the hostess acted suprised to see me.  After being seated I had to go find a wait person to get my drink order.  That took about 10 minutes.  During this wait time I actually asked my wife to stay at the tablw while I looked for another place to eat.  Unfortunately they were all booked up so we went on and ordered food here.  The wait for the food wasn't as long as the wait for the drinks.  I wouldn't complain about the food, just had burgers and fries all of which were ok.  Had to find the wait person again to pay.

The picture I took clearly showed the presence of hair on the chicken. I feel disgusted after this episode. They let me leave without paying for it. But, I still feel disgusted ! Sheer negligence.

The service is always friendly, albeit slow at times due to under-staffing during ""rush hour"" but that's pretty common in airports.  Food quality is, well, ""chain store bar food"" - it's OK.  If you've never been to an airport TGI Friday's, it's a lot like Red Robin but with a much smaller menu.  Prices trend high - but when you do airports as often as I do, you just sign the slip and look the other way ....wink....  It is what it is.

The server struggled to locate items that several people ordered so she simply told the people that they did not have the item, even though it is on the menu. When she came by to tell me that my item was not available, she dropped the menu off and walked away. She did not return so that I could tell her my new order for about 5 or 6 minutes. This meant that my wife's meal came out well before my meal. This is an airport location but the staff don't seem to understand that concept. We were not in a hurry but there were other customers who were in a hurry and too many of them had to get up and hunt down their server to ask for the check.

He also served her, at her request, Bud Light with olives in it. The food is, well, TGI Friday's food. I recently had the spicy salmon and the fish was cooked within an inch of its former life, but it didn't kill me and it was basically as described on the menu.
