Val L.,"Naas, Republic of Ireland",71,206,312,3.0,8/12/2015,"Although this is a popular restaurant, it was my first time there. It reminded me of Captain American at Grafton Street ( I wonder which one opened first?) The dining area is huge and a  lovely waiter using lots of ''flares'' guided us to one of the table areas designed for small groups, so I believe. The decoration was really cool and I spent some time examining it. Some Marvel stuff + traditional Irish decoration, and little pieces and bits of small things hanging on the walls. The food menu was short but the drinks menu had way more options. Not easy to decide. We ordered nachos as a started (it was good and the portion was big enough).Prices are a bit high. The mains we ordered were... OK. My chicken was good but extremely greasy - cheese cheese cheese everywhere. My friend said his steak was chewing and tasteless.  Because of all the cheese I got full quickly and I couldn't eat up everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3
Riham B.,"San Francisco, CA",208,124,116,3.0,1/7/2015,"This place is okay. I liked TGI Fridays growing up back home, but with all the options available in Dublin, this isn't the first place I'd go. The food is okay, the proximity to the Dundrum shopping center is pretty cool, as you can have a bite to eat after shopping.  The service here is really, really slow. We were there pretty late, so the restaurant was a bit empty, and yet our food took forever to be ready. We also had to physically get up and call someone to give us the check, and even then, we had to go back and do this a second time. If there's other options open I'd go for them before heading here. If not, it's fine too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3
Erika G.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",315,201,646,1.0,11/14/2014,"Such a bad atmosphere was really cold inside and at 2pm on a weekday the place was empty!! Over priced, tastless food in tiny portions. Waiters pretend to be so happy in their silly uniforms and hats but they never once asked our table was everything ok, even when they returned to find plates still full of food. I was craving the buffalo boneless bites since I had them in TGI fridays in america..but they were nothing like I remembered. For 9 euro you get 6 tiny buffalo bites that are frozen chicken chunks with a tiny slab of sauce and some gone off celery on the side. Mine were also cold and dried up like they were lying there for a while. Id never return here again even if it was for free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3
Breda M.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",2,18,98,4.0,4/18/2016,St. Patrick's day 9.15pm they looked after us. Our waiter was a pure professional. We'd definitely go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3
Brendan W.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",23,13,2,1.0,9/25/2014,"Terrible!  We stopped in for dinner noting that neither of us had been in a few years and we're looking forward to particular dishes we remembered enjoying before. However, things seem to have changed!  Starter: The best starter IMO that they ever had was breaded, fried, stuffed jalapeños. They no longer do it. The started I did order was approx half the portion size it used to be.  Main course : I got the classic American burger. It was a processed patty, was not dressed with any lettuce as advertised and what tomato was on it was one heel of one tomato. Awful.  My GF ordered the most expensive (€25) version of the ribs as they are one her favourite dishes. Firstly, there was no ""ribs"", but instead just one rib which was supplemented with some chips but without the other advertised side(s)  - coleslaw being the one I recall.  We were initially served our food without being given any cuttlery. There was no condiments on the table - I had to ask the people at the next table if I could borrow theirs, etc.  All in all, an awful experience that came with a very punchy price tag.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3
Ronan M.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",12,49,,4.0,1/7/2013,"This review won't be too long. You only need to keep the following in mind: 1. The food is good, but not great. 2. The staff are good at what they do, but I wouldn't exactly call them attentive. 3. The food is expensive, but not overpriced. (Average cost is about €20 per person) 4. I would recommend this place for a bit of food and a few drinks before going out.  5. The Birthday song they sing is hilarious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3
Kevin A.,"Sparks Glencoe, MD",21,28,15,3.0,8/30/2014,Food is ok... Service is usually the issue here.  Full house or empty it takes ages to get served...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3
Rob M.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",60,353,120,2.0,10/9/2009,"I have to say I thought that TGI's would be an amazing dining experience. Burgers, beer...bliss. But of course, to every silver lining there is a cloud. Underneath all the wacky hats and kitschy charm of TGI's, is poor food, poor service and uncomfortable seating.  The only points TGI's earns in my eyes is that it has some cheap beer and cocktails offers but as many other similarly-themed restaurants and bars do the same kind of offers in these recessionary times, it doesn't really stand out.  Quite the disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3
Kate M.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",40,366,344,1.0,7/7/2009,"I can't stress enough how bad this place is.  I like the Stephesn green branch and even the one in Blackrock, so when the one in Dundrum opened (above the cinema), I went like a little eager beaver. But everything was so awful! The service was so slow - they make you wait for tables when there are lots free, but there isn't ever enough staff to accommodate the tables, so you have to wait until a table in a particular waiter's section comes free. SO annoying! Then when you do get a table the service is really slow and the food is awful. One particular time my sister found a gummy bear in her chicken salad, my chicken ciabatta was cold and we never got our side orders. The waiter was so apologetic and really nice, but there was nothing he could really do. I ended up feeling really sorry for him - it wasn't his fault, clearly the kitchen staff couldn't handled our EXTREMELY complicated order. Not! It's a fun place to go for cocktails - but be warned. They're 90% ice, especially the big fishbowl ones. Don't be fooled!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3
Aoife R.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",43,408,427,3.0,11/23/2009,"I don't think the food in TGI Fridays is going to feature on any doctor-approved diet in the near future. It is a feast of deep-frying and carbohydrate; most of the meat is breaded, either in crumb or bun, and most dishes come with melted mozzarella or the mysterious sounding Colby cheese. I particularly like the way TGIs has gone the extra yard to make things a little bit more unhealthy - as if a cheese burger and fries were not enough, it adds the extra ingredient of not love, but Jack Daniels, to give the meat a nice glaze.  ""Hmm, it needs a little something...""  ""Hard liquor?""  ""That's it!"" TGIs is also good place to bring kids - the waiters always appear delighted to see them, even though they are most probably crying inside at the thought of another little troll who is there to rub ketchup on the booth",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3
Dolores M.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",5,451,458,3.0,12/26/2009,"An expensive eddie rockets, thats what this place is! now i like eddie rocketsbutiwouldnt want to pay much more for it. the servers in here have that annoying american waiter thing going on where the fake enthusiasm and niceness is just annoying! and whats with all the badges? does more badges mean your better or something? im starting to sound like im no fun at all here!sorry! anyway, whats good about here, well i really like their veggie burger, its the type that have lots of diffrernt types of beans in them, yum! and their chips are nice too. whats great about here and it sets it apart from eddies is the fact that you can have a drink with your burger, i mean a drink drink not just a coke! this is a massive atraction for kids so its not a great place to go on a saturday lunch time or in the early evenings, your sure to have a squealing kid beside you i also agree with kates comment below, why oh why can i not sit on any of those free tables when i walk in why must i wait? to be honest i rarely wait when i do that its so infuriating!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3
Joshua R.,"Redwood City, CA",174,181,13,4.0,5/6/2010,"I have this general rule of thumb when I write reviews, whether of food, books, or movies, that makes my high falutin', snob-bein', toe-dippin intelleckshul friends cringe: I generally rate the experience based on what the thing is TRYING to be. Given that TGI Fridays is trying to be an over the top, American, big portion, drink-havin, kitschy quantity-over-quality place, this one does it right.  We almost never go in the US, but here the 15.95E 2-course menu and the cheap cocktails make it worth arriving before a movie and grabbing a bite. I've found that lunch on a weekday is D-E-A-D,so it's a nice quiet place to go with a book. When I was in recently for my traditional Cinco de Mayo Margarita lunch, the day was no exception.  But the manager, who seated me (Celine?  Selena? I think the tequila addled my brain) was very funny and chatty and we swapped travel abroad stories for a good 15 minutes before I remembered that I was there to eat lunch. Just about every time we've been there a manager has come over to see how our meal was, and the service has always been really good. I do think it's a bit on the high side, price wise, and I'll NEVER forgive them for taking Nachos off the menu, but if you take a look at the various specials you can do pretty well, value-wise.   Bottom Line: Give the server the old ""Tell the bartender to make it for real this time"" when you place your bar order and your drinks will always be right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3
Elisha C.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",58,150,314,2.0,9/25/2012,Meh. TGIs is just ok. Food isn't fresh though. Feels like its been sitting around a while and heated up. I used to really like it a few years back. not anymore though when there's so many quality places around to go to instead.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin-3
