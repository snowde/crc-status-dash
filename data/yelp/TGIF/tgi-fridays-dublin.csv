Galadrielle H.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",412,145,594,4.0,2/7/2015,"I am there for a smoothie... 1* For the place : I wanted somewhere quiet. As I came in the music was loud and I wasn't too sure. But then as I went dowstairs the music was not as loud. Awesome ! 1*For the music : only cool music  1* For the smoothie : As the waitress gave me the menu I was thinking I really wanted a smoothie. It looked like a burger place to me and I tried to convince myself to get some fries or something light. But then I saw the cocktail menu, there you go ! Smoothies are cocktails ;) 1* For the place : Loads of space here. Sitting next to me there is a hen party. They are very quiet though... Not sure what's going on. Wait it's not 5pm maybe that's why ! Minus 1* For the service : It took me a few minutes to choose what I wanted. Once I did I couldn't get the attention of a waitress. A staff who was cleaning table saw me and asked a waitress to come to me. Not cool.  I'll probably come back with friends as the smoothie was good. Please let me know what you thought of the place :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
Steven J.,"Manhattan, NY",2,2,,1.0,12/17/2017,Empty seats everywhere but 40mins wait and wouldn't do food at the bar. Total joke of a TGI's avoid,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
Rebecca F.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",49,79,143,2.0,2/13/2017,"Pretty average meal here. I wouldn't say quite as low as two stars, 2.5 more like. Stopped in because the toddler was in tow and he was cranky, I knew I had to go somewhere kid friendly so it fit the bill for that. He loved his burger and chips (can't go much wrong). Husband and I had pretty okay food but the cost was genuinely staggering, way too much money for what we got, way way too much. Likely won't be back. Shame as it's a great room/location and the woman who served us was really lovely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
Oanh P.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",82,53,8,4.0,7/10/2017,My experience about this place so far is not as bad as others. Nice staff and good atmosphere when I was there so I will definitely come back to check if they are still good. Love their 16 hours cooked rip and their jack Daniel's dipping sauce as well!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin

Aminah B.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",9,30,30,1.0,7/8/2014,"An absolute disgrace. I booked for my son's birthday as I knew they would pay a tiny bit of attention to him with a cake and candle. I had very low expectations due to a bad experience in a different branch a few years ago, however I held the candle of hope tightly that it wouldnt be a total wash-out. Firstly, the menu is huge. Apparently it was relaunched. Our waiter wasnt even sure about some of our questions regarding food. Does no-one realise that less is more? Then I was told I couldnt order a half-portion of nachos, only full-size. (Really??) The waiter asked was it ok to bring my son's food first. Yes of course I said. (Small fella was getting hungry and knarky). FORTY minutes later our food arrives. TOGETHER. My son inhaled his food without chewing he was so hungry. When I saw the ""nachos"" I nearly had a coronory. They were pathetic looking flat tortillas with a teaspoon size amount of chill-mince on them for €12. These are marked as suitable for ""3-4 people"". Please, go look at the picture. My sisters fries were cold. And my loaded fries were literally covered in cheap-grated cheese, chopped white onions, uncooked, and a squirt of mustard for good measure. And they were cold.  I called the Manager. I explained that this was unacceptable. Two dishes were cold, and one was a greasy flat tortilla masquerading as nachos. He was very apologetic and the only reason this place even gets one star. From where we were sitting my sister was able to see her burger had been left sitting under the lights for ages. I was disgusted. So the manager offers to take things off the bill. And free desserts. And free drinks.  He was very professional and apologetic and listened to my complaints. So we get these free desserts, mine is apple pie. Obviously from a box. Tasteless, squidgy and generic. Oh and the rim of the bowl was covered in greasy finger-prints. Nice. My sisters had sundaes. I'd say a half pint of more generic ice-cream went into those, with a few biscuits and a can of aerosol cream. They had to remove the 3 inch wad of cream before being able to eat anything else. The manager was decent. The food was not. Whoever owns this place has to cop  on and see they are competing with the likes of Thunder Road Cafe. Firstly, reduce your menu. Secondly, train your staff to handle the new menu. Thirdly, stop making food from a box, its disgusting.  I had a brief chat with the Manger as I left and thanked him for his understanding. He remarked the new menu was causing mayhem.  I genuinely appreciated his excellent customer service skills,but not in a million years would I return to ANY of their branches.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
Wesley W.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",86,685,957,1.0,2/13/2015,"I'll be honest, I habitually visit Fridays as after living in America for years I get a craving once and a while and stop in for a bit of food and some drinks.  But it would appear that is not something they encourage here at Fridays in Ireland anymore.  As I stopped in about half seven to have a cocktail and some dinner I was informed Fridays no longer lets you order food in the bar area.  Apparently the staff here unlike their counterparts in America, and I quote 'can not deal with food while serving drinks' so they have banned all food from the bar area.  This is quite disappointing as I usually pop in with work colleagues for drinks and some appetizers but, that's now gone.  It's odd if you and a male work colleague are forced to get a table or even worse, wait for a table just because you want drinks and nibbles.  Anyway, I won't be back.   Captain America's is a two minute walk down the road and they let you order at the bar without a big speech about why they are physically unable to do it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
Sinéad O.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",0,17,60,2.0,12/8/2014,"We got nachos between 3 as a starter,  which was grand,  I wouldn't really class them as nachos but tasty enough.   I got a burger which I enjoyed,  my friend got Diablo pasta but if she wanted chicken in it,  it was an extra €12, (it wasn't very spicey)  Our server was nice and helpful.   I ordered a long island ice tea,  which was mostly a glass of coke with lime in it :( my friend got a strawberry dajuri which was very nice seemed to be made with strawberries in stead of syrup.  And are other friend got a woohuu,  which was OK.  Would I come back here again,  probably yes but,  as a last resort",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
Emma C.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",16,17,5,2.0,12/9/2015,Went for lunch last week and was what you would expect from an American chain - fairly standard burgers and steak - nothing to write home about.  Far nicer places to eat in Dublin city but staff were friendly and food was ok.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
Sean O.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",2,17,,1.0,7/3/2014,"I've eaten here 4 times since I moved to Dublin and I have no idea why I keep coming back. Maybe I'm hoping that they will surprise me.  Last time I ate there was last week and I just wanted a quick lunch before heading to work. So I came in and asked to be seated away from the kids party that was there. I was assured they were leaving and was seated at an okay table. I noticed they had a refurbishment since I was last in and I really like it. However they must have some issues as the table I sat at had literally no light. I had to use the torch on my phone to see the menu.  Now the waiting staff are very nice here however they need to be able to see when someone just wants to eat and read. The guy took my order and I waited for my starters. The wings arrived and I have to say they were dreadful, I don't know how they prep them but there are many many places in Dublin that have far superior wings on offer. In the meantime I had asked a different server for a refill which she must have forgotten about as I had to ask another server before it arrived 20 minutes later.  My main arrived shortly after and the offering had gotten worse since last time. I had the striploin medium rare with fries and veg. The steak was fine and was cooked properly however the veg was overdone and the fries were lukewarm and under seasoned. The portion size has also really decreased and seeing as veg and potatoes are possibly the cheapest ingredients in restaurants this shouldn't really be an area where they cut costs. Getting the bill was the biggest error. I put my coat on packed my stuff and got my bags together and no one came near me, I eventually had to flag down a barman who brought the bill over to which I immediately placed the cash on the table, it then took a further 10 minutes before a server came over to take the money and get my change.  I ended up being in the restaurant for 85 minutes for a 2 course lunch. Overall they really need to work on most aspects of their service. I will most likely try them again but I think that will be the last time. As a chain they really need to get their basics right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
Mat M.,"Walker's Point, Milwaukee, WI",299,520,86,3.0,3/3/2014,"I must admit, I'm embarrassed to say that I ate here while in Dublin.  How quintessential American can I be? I sat alone at the bar, had a Heineken and some chicken strips.  Paid and left. Nothing special about the place - but a sure bet when you're hungry, don't know where to eat and just want something quick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
Alexandra M.,"Boston, MA",455,1359,2040,3.0,4/17/2011,"Had dinner here on a Saturday night and it was packed! Which is a bit surprising because of how expensive it is compared to other places in the area that I've been to, and compared to TGI Fridays in America. 20 Euro for burger? I hope it was good for those who got it....I got jalapeno poppers and those were delicious. No one complained about their food but no one raved about it either. The deserts looked amazing though and disappeared in a few seconds. Service was a bit slow but it was 7:30 on a Saturday. Oh, and they were playing Sherk on the TVs which was a bit weird..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
Hazel C.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",177,220,431,2.0,3/21/2013,"Food  is very vgood however it tastes just as good as Eddie Rockets... cocktails are awful!!!!!!!!! - they were watered down and in TINY glasses, I had three and didnt feel one bit tipsy... the staff are extremely friendly... and its vibrant.. this place is ideal for a girls night out or a work party or families with kids. essentially though  its a glorified eddie rockets with crap alcohol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
Conor W.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",0,2,,1.0,1/10/2015,"Worst TGI's I've been to by a long way.  Had a 45min wait for our main course which arrived cold. I'm normally not one for sending food back but in this case I had no choice.  Even after it was reheated the burger was still cold.  I have had better €10 burgers than the €18 Jack Daniel's Burger I ordered. It really seems that all TGI's (well this restaurant anyway) have been focused on raising prices while reducing quality, trying to pass off a refit of the restaurant as added value. I really struggle to see the justification in the high prices with their bad food, and very slow service. The quality of Dublin restaurants has come on leaps and bounds in the past few years while offering great value. They really has left TGI's behind on all fronts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
Chris S.,"Bray, Republic of Ireland",46,135,99,1.0,9/26/2012,"Entering the place I got overwhelmed of all the trinkets plastered over the walls, and ceiling. Together with the ""red-white"" colour pattern of the American theme (surely we have arrived in an American-style diner here)  gave me an headache already. To give the place the benefit of the doubt we opted to stay for food anyways.... Unfortunately all our menu choices were doomed to the same fate; the taste was hard to find if at all there except that everything had somehow a nasty spicy, almost vinegar taste.  As always in search for the best cheesecake in town we were very disappointed indeed here. It was very floury and tastes nothing like cheesecake at all. Sorry guys, but I give your menu minus stars if it would be possible.  The staff were all friendly, I give them that, and they all seem to like the film 'office space', as they all seem to collect  as much buttons on their suspenders as possible  .... For that fun element they get from me that one star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
Bridget R.,"West Chester, PA",56,454,718,3.0,2/12/2010,"To me it's still alien to think of American dining as exotic. I grew up being carted to tatty ""Uncle Mo"" style restaurants like this on a pretty regular basis - how can this now be destination dinertainment (I'm trademarking that right now)?  But here it is: an American restaurant trading on the fact that it's just that... and people love it! Or, American tourists afraid to eat in pubs, happy hour bankers, southside city teens and the like love it.  Everyone else goes to the DC Coffee next door. The food is chain-restaurant safe, the servers are on-brand friendly and there's always a few specials for the budget conscious... though a few beers and a menu-standard burger can get pricey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
Aoife O.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",10,249,221,2.0,7/24/2009,"There shouldn't be any surprises with TGI Fridays on the Green. It does what it says on the tin - American diner style, fun, fast food, colourful cocktails and giggles. Plenty of birthday parties and squealing make for a merry-ish atmosphere. It all feels a tad artificial however and if you're in the mood for margaritas and potato skins, I'd sooner opt for Captain Americas. I don't remember prices being exceptionally bad but it sure wasn't cheap, and what can you expect you're on the Green afterall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
Gary M.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",55,47,2,3.0,2/11/2010,"T.G.I Fridays as a brand is so well recognised that everybody already has an opinion on it, which makes this an easy review. T.G.I. Fridays have branches in Dundrum, , Blanchardstown, Blackrock and St. Stephen's Green with the latter been my local branch and the branch in which my review is based. Food and décor  of this branch are T.G.I standard so no big surprises in store when visiting. Promotions there are good with two course meals for 15euro. Cocktails are on the menu for 5euro and unlike most other establishments cocktails have a distinct alcohol taste giving you the feeling you are getting value for money. The staff here are friendly and all food is served fresh. Although it is worth a visit be advised that when been seated ensure that you get a table away from the pot plants as they sometimes attract flies which is never good!!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
Mark D.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",2,15,1,4.0,8/12/2012,"Love the food in here with the jack Daniels dips. The spicy buffalo wings are just addictive, but only if you can handle the heat! Desserts like brownies and apple pie with ice cream are just incredible. I would recommend this any day, it's a bit gimmicky and childish but overall it's has some great food when out for the day in the city.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
Melanie M.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",320,545,1718,4.0,8/15/2009,"This restaurant bar and grill began in New York in 1965 and has now become a global brand and there are many branches in Dublin. This branch on Stephen's Green is on of the better ones I feel. They have a dazzling array of burgers, salads, fajitas, pasta, and seafood. They have an excellent line of meats covered in delicious Jack Daniels sauces and ribs and really nice and spicy buffalo wings. The best thing is their happy hours and deals on their fabulous range of over 100 cocktails!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-dublin
