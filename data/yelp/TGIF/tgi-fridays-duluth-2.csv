Mohammad A.,"Lilburn, GA",3,29,26,1.0,11/10/2014,All we ask for is a booth and the man tells my family and I he can't for a very illegitimate reason then he rants about the server not being able to take care of us of you like poor customer service then come on in.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=80
Edward B.,"Stone Mountain, GA",23,4,2,4.0,3/30/2016,"Walked in and was greeting very pleasantly by hostess. Waitress was ok, ordered sweet tea and tasted like someone from New York brewed/mixed it (southern people will understand). This isn't somewhere that my wife and I will crave.

Ben M.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,1,,1.0,9/6/2015,"I live right around the corner and frequent this location. This is by far the worst TGI Friday's I have ever been to. I usually end up there when there is a long wait at other restaurants in the area. The service is TERRIBLE. On my most recent trip this week we encountered so many issues. First, our server took 10 min to first approach the table. Next, I received my food 15 min before my girlfriend received her food. When her food finally got to the table her avocado BLT was missing avocados. We would have sent the food back but our server failed to check on us after the food had arrived. When we were ready for the check our server totally disappeared. I had to stand up and walk over to another server to request our server bring our check. For the first time in my entire life, I did not leave a tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=80
Tiffany A.,"Atlanta, GA",230,77,81,5.0,12/28/2015,"When we walked in the hostess opened the door for us. I got the Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta. The food took awhile to come but it was well worth the wait (although they could add a little more chicken and shrimp to the pasta). I got the frozen strawberry lemonade and loved it. The manager even came to our table to check on us, which was really nice. When we were leaving, we asked for to go cups and the manger was super nice and gave us our frozen lemonade in our cups. I was very happy with my visit here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=80
Jennifer H.,"Atlanta, GA",216,89,572,3.0,1/14/2013,"My friends and I came here for a late lunch on a Monday afternoon. The place was certainly not busy or crowded because it was around 1:45 pm after the lunch crowd had left. The hostess was friendly and showed us our table right away. Not long afterwards, our waitress showed up to get our drink orders. She did not write anything down after we told her the drinks we needed. It took her a few minutes to get our drinks to us.  I started to walk around to check out the place and the hostess was wondering if we were leaving since we waited a while for our drinks to show up. I told her I was getting a little restless and I went back to our table but still had to wait a while on the waitress to get our orders. When she arrived, she promptly took orders and did not ""need"" to write anything down. We did not think much of it since the drink orders came back accurate for all four of us. We had 2 Friday's Pick 3 for All in the Appetizers section, a Grilled Chicken Cobb Salad and a Turkey Burger.                                                                     After a long wait, the food finally came out. For the appetizers, my friend had boneless wings, loaded potato skins and warm pretzels with beer-cheese dipping sauce. The other appetizer was basically the same. Boneless wings, warm pretzels with beer-cheese dipping sauce but with fried Mozzarella. The appetizers all came with 4 dipping sauces and celery sticks. My friends all enjoyed it. I had the Grilled Chicken Cobb Salad with Ranch dressing as my entree. It had Balsamic marinated chicken breast that was fire-grilled and drizzled with balsamic glaze. I enjoyed the romaine lettuce with sliced avocado, grape tomatoes, hard-boiled egg, applewood-smoked bacon and crumbled bleu cheese with my Ranch dressing. You can request any kind of dressing you like. The other friend had a classic Turkey Burger with the normal garnishes. The waitress was able to substitute the fries with some celery sticks for her. The only thing is that she had to request for some ranch dressing to come with her celery sticks. The kitchen did an excellent job with our food. When the bill came, we had to request for a redo because all the drinks were billed incorrectly. I guess the lesson here is to never rely totally on your memory. It would save the waitress some embarrassing moments to redo all the tickets. Overall, TGIF gets 3.5 stars. The food was good and the restaurant was clean. However, the wait is longer than we expected. The waitress apologized for the mixed up in the billing and corrected the situation. I could not imagine coming here when it is crowded especially on the weekends. Yelp 32/365",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=80
Jabari M.,"Stockbridge, GA",381,74,401,3.0,7/12/2014,I have never been a huge fan of chain restaurants and this place made me feel even stronger about my sentiments. The service was sub-par and the food was just okay. It was early in the day and the restaurant was at about 20% capacity but the service was still awful.  The food was decent. I had some unlimited boneless wings in garlic parmesan and buffalo flavors which were pretty ok. I would go back for those alone but unfortunately our waiter's lack of attention to detail will probably deter me from going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=80
Shaun W.,"Snellville, GA",38,7,8,1.0,7/7/2015,"The one star is a courtesy because there is no way to assign less. I was really looking forward to potstickers, potato skins and a burger but after sitting at the table for 15 minutes without so much as a ""we will be right you"" or a glass of water and another 10 minutes of waiting for the hostess to get the manager that we asked to speak to, we left!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=80

Shoshana F.,"Norcross, GA",107,9,2,2.0,9/19/2015,"The food was good, and the service was terrible. They brought out 2/3 people's orders, and no one came to check to see if our food was ok. We had to ask for our server to come see about the last order. It turns out it was sent to another table, so they had to make another. We asked to see a manager. They offered to send out another two appetizers (already paid for, the order was for endless apps). The server still did not check to see if our food was ok. We had to ask for refills on our waters. By the time the next round of apps came out, we were finished with the meal. We asked for to-go boxes and gave the server the credit card - we didn't want to wait for us to have to ask for the check. We asked for another manager to come. He gave us no real explanation or reason to return. We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=80
Knuckle H.,"Duluth, GA",0,3,,1.0,6/27/2015,"Popped in and tried the Smoke Stacked burger. First off, the burger, then the service. The burger was ok, not great. The meat patties closely resembled the patties from a McDonalds Big Mac, which is not what I expect on a nearly $13 hamburger. They try to dress it up with 2 sauces, cole slaw, bacon, and sausage, but you can only put so much lipstick on a pig. I would prefer to have a higher quality beef with enough flavor to stand on it's own and not need all the additional stuff. Sure, the other stuff is nice, but get the basics right first. And really, make some attempt at having the food in the menu pics look similar to the item that ends up on the table. Showing a picture of a Lamborghini and giving me a Kia is not a good way to do business. A good example of this is the sausage. In the picture there are sizeable chunks of sausage sticking out from underneath the bun. In reality, I had to search through the cheese and try to identify what the tiny chunks were. Some of them were onions, a few seemed to be sausage of some sort. Secondly, the service. Hostess was pleasant, the waitress was nice and had some personality. I'm not looking for a new best friend, but it's good when the wait staff acts like they want you to be there. The problem was that my aforementioned burger came out wrong. Like a completely different burger than what I ordered. No biggie, mistakes happen. They always seem to happen when I'm really, hungry, but hey... that's life. The second burger comes out and it's the right burger, but it's missing several ingredients. The waitress tells me she'll go get the missing ingredients. I'm hungry, so I give her about 20 seconds, and then I just start eating. So the manager comes back over, and without me saying a word about the situation which was entirely their fault, she says very snidely, ""Oh, I didn't know it was a race"" as I had nearly finished the burger by the time they brought out the missing ingredients. That kinda ticked me off. Thanks for insinuating I'm a pig for eating so quickly, and making it my fault that my burger was incomplete, even though I already gave you two chances to get it right and I was starving. I will not be back. I can get a much better burger cheaper at someplace like Ruby Tuesday. And while they occasionally make mistakes, they've always owned up to them and never got snotty. I will also add that it would have been nice for the TGIFriday manager to make some attempt to make me happy... knock a couple bucks off the bill, give me a coupon, a free dessert... something. She did *nothing*. Not even an apology for the mix ups. Sorry TGI Friday, there are tons of restaurants in this area. There's no reason for me to get poor quality food, poor service, and pay premium prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=80
Sherry G.,"Grayson, GA",13,20,15,2.0,6/11/2015,"ANTS, lots of them! First let me start by saying our waiter was great and the food was good. However, during our dinner, my daughter noticed ants on her leg and purse! They were all over the wall and on the seat of her booth going down to the floor. Not wanting to make a scene,  I very descretly told our server who then called over the manager. She apologized and moved us and our food to another table. When the bill came, we expected a discount or maybe our appetizer comped for the hassle, but no, the bill stayed the same. After we paid and were ready to leave, the server offered us a free dessert to go.

Angela S.,"Smyrna, GA",362,568,2415,3.0,6/17/2012,"After a long day of running errands with my brother, I asked him what he felt like eating for dinner.  He thought for a few minutes, we searched through the nearby restaurants on the Yelp app, and he told me he wanted to go to TGI Friday's.  Since I hadn't been there in probably at least year, I agreed that we would go there. We arrived around 5:30 pm on a Saturday evening.  Since it was still early for dinner, the restaurant wasn't too busy and there was no wait.  The hostess seated us at the right side of the restaurant by the wall. The first thing our server asked was if we were ""Give Me More Stripes"" card members.  I told her that I was.  She said that was great, and that she'd bring us complimentary ""Stripes"" chips and salsa since I had a Stripes card.  Sweet!  It had been so long since I had been to a TGI Friday's that I didn't know that they always provided free chips and salsa to Stripes members, but we happily welcomed this nice surprise.  They were decent for free chips and salsa, but they weren't anything special. My brother wanted a burger, and I wanted a pasta, but we also wanted to try each others' dishes.  So we agreed to just share both entrees!  This turned out to be perfect. We finished our first round of ""Stripes"" chips (rectangular, so literally shaped like stripes) fairly quickly, and we looked around for our server who had told us we could get unlimited refills.  She was no where in sight.  We sat and waited...  and waited...  and waited...  It felt like we were sitting and waiting for about 10 minutes with no one checking on us.  Finally, we flagged down one of the hostesses after she sat a new group at their table.  We told her that we simply wanted a refill of chips and salsa, and we asked if she could find our server.  She said she would request it for us. A few minutes later, our server brought our entrees over.  When she asked if we needed anything, we informed her that we had requested more chips and salsa, but we hadn't received it yet.  So she put in a ""rush order"" for more chips, and they were served to us in no time! * Jack Daniel's Burger ($9.69) - Since I hate raw onions and don't like pickles in my burger, we had asked for those items to be placed on the side and not inside the burger.  We had also requested for the burger to be cut in half, and for an extra Jack Daniel's sauce.  Unfortunately, the only request that was followed was the extra sauce.  I gave my brother the onions and pickles, and he cut the burger in half (which is a pain to do 'cuz it gets messy).  Fortunately, the burger itself was delicious!  Per the menu description, this burger consists of TGI Friday's ""Signature Jack Daniel's® sauce, applewood-smoked bacon and melted provolone cheese atop a fire-grilled Black Angus Beef Burger.""  The Angus beef patty was juicy and flavorful, the Jack Daniel's sauce was sweet and slightly tangy, and the bacon was thick and delicious.  The seasoned fries tasted fine but there wasn't much of it that came with the burger. * Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta ($13.69) - Our server had informed us that this pasta is spicy, but we really didn't think it would be.  It turned out to have a nice, slight heat to it!  The chicken was cooked slightly charred, deliciously sautéed with shrimp and red bell peppers, and tossed with fettuccine noodles and spicy Cajun Alfredo sauce.  It may not look very appetizing, but it was really good, and we were satisfied with the amount of shrimp and chicken in it.  I would definitely get this again. Overall, this TGI Friday's gets 3.5 stars because while the service wasn't so great, the food was very good!  Aside from the times we had to wait for our chips and again for the check to pay, we had an enjoyable dinner there.  I will definitely return to this TGI Friday's for its cleanliness and convenient location, but I hope they will work on their service - especially considering the fact that they weren't really busy the last time we were there.

Jerrel T.,"Atlanta, GA",72,64,,3.0,7/21/2015,"This place is okay. TGIFridays used to be my favorite place growing up. It has definitely changed over the years. Since this place is around the corner, it's quick and easy to come here to get some food when I don't feel like cooking or dressing up for dinner. The service is hit or miss. We have eaten at the bar area and had a table in the restaurant area, and each time the service can be on par or not. The food for the most part has been good to satisfactory. There are a few times where my order didn't come as ordered or there were long waits for items that were ordered. If I want to get a drink or a beer then sitting at the actual bar is better for quick service. When I go, I pretty much get my stabled items. They have remodeled this one, so I am still undecided if it's improved this restaurant or not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=80
Corey J.,"Roswell, GA",1,3,1,1.0,6/27/2016,"Horrible experience.  Concern 1: Ordered a steak ""twice"" medium rare and it still came back well done. Concern 2: Ordered the Chicken And Shrimp and received only a half piece of chicken.  The manager stated that is the size, but then came back to the table with a piece double the size. Concern 3: my meal had two sides.... Let's image how long it took to get my second side item. So my final assessment is that they did not care about our service at all which is sad.  He kitchen manager did visit the table at the beginning to confirm the order.  Will not return to this location or recommend it.

In a group of 4 women we all ordered drinks and food on this Friday. However, when I ordered the endless appetizers I was not satisfied with my potato skins with Kraft cheese or my boneless wings. I ordered mozzarella sticks just to try to be fair and not judge the restaurant on the lack of my liking and still pay for my bill. After being dissatisfied and not finishing ANY of my food I asked the waitress what could be done so everyone could be satisfied and the manager came to our table with a complete attitude. He had a lack of customer service and professionalism by raising his voice and putting his hands into my face. No longer even wanting to eat we asked for out ticket and to-go boxes and was given 7 miniature to-go boxes for an ENTIRE rack of ribs and watched management try to tell out waitress not to give us the correct to go containers. After the ordeal with the male management that was on staff we requested to speak to the other on shift manager just to diffuse the situation and find a resolution however she would not come to our table.

The girl at the bar was super friendly and very attentive after I ordered my drink.  I took advantage of the $5 crown apples and $4 fireball shots while I waited. The crown apple drink was sweet but good.  My wings came out in about 15 minutes and they were hot and delicious. The girl that brought them out asked that I look at them and make sure I was satisfied and that I didn't need anything else.  I took away a star because they tried to overcharge me for my drinks. They charged me for 3 shots when I had 2. The drinks were pretty decent and I was feeling good when I got the check but not that good. I still know how many drinks I had!

Rezwan R.,"Lawrenceville, GA",5,40,139,4.0,3/7/2016,"When you feel hungry go to TGI Fridays... Not really, maybe go there sometimes.  This is an American restaurant chain that serves good food and an ok service and pricey tags.  Well personally I like chain restaurants, but find a great deficiency of excitementment in such places. Same old menus over and over, TVs, lacking life, gloomy setting, I don't know, local restaurants  have a better flare or mojo so to speak. Anyways I don't know if anybody feels that way.  Enough of my ranting, but like I said experience and service was meh.  Food was good, I ordered the Sizzling Chicken and Shrimp ( 13.99$) and a side of fries.

Rose C.,"Atlanta, GA",116,8,5,1.0,3/8/2017,"Went for a late dinner and the place was not that busy.  So my friends and i were seated at a tall table, where there were still trash left on the table. The hostess cleaned it off as she seated us.  The waitress came about 5 minutes after to take our drink orders and the sweet tea took forever because they had to make it. (She could have told us that she's making it after she started brewing it) Then the margarita we ordered was waiting at the bar for a while.  We all ordered the endless app and those took forever to be served when we only ordered twice the whole sitting.  When we finally got our check she put incorrect amount on the check when we split the bill in 2 ways and that took another 15 miniutes to be revised.  When we complained to the manager, she said she understood and held her for good 5 minutes to talk to our waitress, when she could have just told her few things and let her do her job so she can get us taken care of. After the manager talked to the waitress, she did not say a word about being apologetic and whatnot and just silently gave us our checks and our cards back.

Chanel R.,"Atlanta, GA",5,31,121,1.0,1/19/2016,"I was doing late groceries, happened to pass by and decided to give it a try at T.G.I. Friday's. It took them quite sometime to notice us at the entrance and led us to our table.  I ordered shrimp pasta and Jack Daniel's steak with shrimps and sides. It took around 30 minutes for the food to be served. The shrimp pasta was extremely salty, almost as though half a bottle of salt poured in it. The pasta itself was overcooked, definitely not al dente. I would say a 1/10. As for the Jack Daniel's Steak, it came without shrimps. They missed out the shrimps and charged for the price of what I ordered. After clarifying with the waiter, he managed to get the sides but it took another 20 minutes of wait for it to be served, missing the point of having a side dish with entrée. The taste of the steak was overcooked, making it hard to chew, the sides of mac and cheese was ok, and as for the shrimps it came too late and it came straight right out from the kitchen so it was extremely hot, serving with the long wait steak. I give the steak rating of 3/10. While having the meal, the waiters were not attentive, no one noticed when I asked for water or even raised my hands to get their attention. It took them around another 10 minutes or so for them to realize there were actually customers sitting there and needed water.  When I asked for bill, again it took such a long time for them to come over and of course took them a long time to return the bill after paying. Definitely will not recommend anyone to patronage this restaurant. The price is expensive and not worth for the standards of the food and treatment of service they provided.

Andrea M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",531,1117,3672,3.0,10/9/2014,"Eh. The service was really good, but the food wasn't superb. My friend and I had their unlimited $10 appetizer deal. She had heard about it and wanted to try it out. Once you choose your choice of appetizer, you're committed to getting that item throughout the course. The first plate that's brought out is a full portion. The plates thereafter are half sized.  We ended up  getting the spicy chicken tostada and spinach dip. The tostada was pretty tasty. The spinach dip had too much spinach and not enough cheese. We also ordered a side of mozzarella sticks to satisfy our cheese crave (not part of the unlimited deal). That of course definitely hit the spot. :) Overall, the food was about average. The service from both the hostess and waitress was above average as both were genuine, friendly, and courteous. Parking was pretty plentiful. Even after 2  1/2 hours of being there, parking was still pretty available when we headed on out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=20
Fabia A.,"Conyers, GA",7,87,83,1.0,2/6/2016,Not a pleasant experience.  We entered and there were a lot of patrons waiting to be seated on a Saturday at 2p.  We were not greeted and the hostess seated another couple before us even though we were there first.  She was about to do it again when the people spoke up and said we were there first.  As we sat down the people in front of us and behind us were complaining about the wait time and asking for a manager. The wait was long but they brought us a complimentary order of chips and salsa.  The waitress was nice.   Our food was terrible not the Friday's quality I'm use to.  This chain has really gone down the tubes.  Some locations are better but this one has to be the worse.  Our Jack Daniels chicken and shrimp was dry and the shrimp was cooked until it had no life left (dry and chewy).

This is one of those leave well enough alone things.  We had the special which included adult drinks. The Long Island Peach tea was good. The special menu had limited food choices and we were feeling a bit adventurous so we had the bacon crusted ribs. The adventure was not worth the risk. I feel pigs would have been very disappointed with this mess of a menu item. Why Oh Why would someone do this to food? I must slap myself on the hand and say I got what I paid for.

Ashley M.,"Chicago, IL",15,53,19,3.0,4/9/2016,"Okay I haven't Yelped in a long time...but this time I just had to do it. With a chain as large as TGI Fridays, it's hard for these types of reviews to even matter, but maybe this will prevent anyone from coming here...if you have anything to do afterward.  Grab a cot, blanket and your tablet with movies loaded because you're going to spend a long time here.  My cousin and I went to TGI Fridays because they have great specials. We sat fairly quickly and waited...for a very long time. Maybe this was the self-serve location.  Waiter finally arrived but apparently wasn't aware we had been sitting there. No biggie. It wasn't that long in reality...but you've seen the Snickers commercials. It's real. I want food now!  Our waiter prepared us that the ""endless appetizer"" special would take a long time. He did. But $12 is $12. And endless is endless. And we were very hungry. So his warnings went unfortunately ignored.  He also didn't write down our orders. I should have known then that something was up. I asked for a straw from the waiter for my drink and he never came back. I hope he's okay.  A second waiter come over to take our order. Okay? Never met you, no introduction...but I suppose you're over here for a reason. He was nice though.  Turns out that the waiter at the table next to us never came back either. Maybe our waiters went off together and had a happily ever after. Wouldn't you watch that movie? I would...but I would also wonder about those girls that never got their food.  --- Meanwhile, while we were waiting on our food, someone turned the music up. I thought that I was going to both starve and go deaf. The last thing I'd ever hear is the croonings of Ursher.  --- Finally the food came. The food is the only thing saving this place. I suppose when the cooks have to go hunt the cow down to raise it, butcher it by hand, let it marinate for three full moons, and cook it, that the food would be good. That's how long it took.  Speaking of food, throughout the whole night servers kept coming up to the table with food that we didn't order. Stop. Too hungry for your temptations. Maybe use numbers for the tables. Seems like a nice and efficient method. Right now the orders must come out saying ""walk food to tables near the speakers--yell 'IS THIS YOURS?' as loudly as you can, and hope for the best.""  ---- After three fortnights, we were granted with our bill. But alas. Despite our trials and tribulations, the bill was incorrect. Didn't I say $12 is $12? I didn't say charge me for each appetizer I ate.  ||sidebar|| I love reading terms and conditions. Especially for coupons. I didn't break one rule. ||over|| The manager was helpful. He corrected the mishap and we were allowed to leave. Unfortunately our muscles had atrophied and molded into the chairs. We made it out though.  ...I'm still waiting on that straw.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=20

When we ordered dessert, we were given the whole instead of the reduced price half meal, and still ended up paying for half price. Amazeballs.  The check came out shortly after dessert without us asking. Whaaat? Lol. I was impressed.

Judy B.,"Lawrenceville, GA",91,4,1,1.0,10/13/2017,"Went here for a quick dinner only because it was convenient and two minutes away from my apartment. We were sat quickly and the waitress took our order promptly. Only reason why it deserves one star. I ordered the baby back ribs with the seasoned fries and coleslaw. Waitress brought the food out, but offered no utensils. So I started on my fries and lo' and behold, I found a hair in the food. Not wanting to cause a scene and because I was starving, I decided to put it to the side and address it later when our waitress came back. Found a second hair halfway through my fries (still no utensils by the way, and no waitress to be seen) and by this point, I felt sick. Told our waitress once she finally made it back to us that there were multiple hair found in my fries and instead of taking my entire plate back, she went and got me a smaller plate of fries to replace it. Didn't even bother to pick up the first plate back until we asked her. Gave them the benefit of the doubt AGAIN and halfway through my baby back ribs, I find another piece of hair. Asked the waitress for the manager and the manager took her sweet ol' time to sit down and talk to us. At this point, I just wanted to pay and leave. She didn't accept fault, told me that all her cooks in the back were men, nobody had the hair type that I had show her, and it's weird that I found hair in different places when I was trying to explain to her that they were all on one plate. Then she ended up taking my picture and told me that it was for filing claim purposes, but really she just wanted to send my picture out to other restaurants to see if it was some dine and ditch stunt. Since I clearly did not put hair in my own food, I happily obliged. The management here is terrible, and the only reason I did not want to cause a scene was because I was starving and exhausted from work. The least they could have done was apologized. In the end, we offered to pay for the drinks we finished and left. This place did not deserve how courteous we were tonight.

We waited at least 10 minutes after seating for our waiter to visit our table then another 10 minutes or so for our drink order. It wasn't like this was a busy time or day either. After taking our order it was another long wait. During that time, 2 other groups seated in our area got up and left in frustration due to the poor service. Our food was wrong when it was brought out. Sides and meats were mismatched and we had to sort this out ourselves. The steaks were much poorer quality than they used to be. Drink refills, when they finally arrived, were in dirty glasses. Then, while paying the check, the waiter disappeared with my credit card for 15 minutes. This is unacceptable and suspicious behavior. Now I'm going to have to monitor my accounts for several days to make sure it wasn't skimmed or something. Then, to top things off, the waiter dropped off the credit card receipt but didn't leave a pen before making a bee line to the back again.

There was 2 servers that walked pass us several times and never said a word. After 25 minutes of sitting and looking around my daughter, whose 2 by the way goes, ""Excuse Me!"" Really loud and toddler like, we were still ignored. Then finally one of those same servers that kept walking pass several times, tries to walk her rude behind up and greet? We said, ""No Thanks"", and literally went somewhere else. We were undeserving of that treatment when all we wanted was to eat peacefully as a family. On top of that, a week or two prior, we came in and this time my Dad came to visit for my bday, and we were served by the slowest server ever! I mean it literally took 10 minutes to get ranch!

Veda Z.,"Jacksonville, FL",2,93,171,1.0,5/10/2016,"In all my time in reviewing places, I have never given just one star, until now. First, we stood by the empty host stand for about 12 minutes before the host showed up. Next, we waited for our server to show up at our table. This took exactly 15 minutes. We ordered 1 Long Island, a lemonade, and a pick 3 appetizer. We saw the server ring in our order right away. That was about the only positive part of our experience.  Next, our drinks took 18 minutes to get to our table. Our appetizer arrived about 20 minutes after. In the meantime, the host stand that was right behind where we were seated, remained hostless.  In terms of atmosphere, it was very dull. All of the televisions were set to volley ball. When we asked if we can see the NBA playoffs on one tv, we were told that we could not.  Appetizers arrived with no side plates. We had to continuously search the room to gain the attention of our server. At the end, we told the server that we will look over the menu, and may order something else. After being left for about 20 more minutes, we asked for the check and paid right away. God only knows how long we would have had to wait for our server to come back if we didn't pay right away. Adding disgust to it all, I looked up and saw our server ""playing"" with her hair. I am big on hygiene, and have worked in food service before. I could only imagine the amount of germs that were transferred to us from the server.

Charlie H.,"Lawrenceville, GA",7,4,5,3.0,6/26/2015,"For my first review ever... YAY!! I will review the ""oh-so-famous"", and one of my personal favorites, TGI Friday's! This diner has been one of my favorite places to go every since I was child. Their food, service, and ambiance has always been great! Well, for me at least.  However, it was until recently that I have experienced a somewhat disappointment in this place. I would first like to compliment on the server I had that day for she was very kind and helpful to my table. She always had a smile on her face and she never once given attitude or any other negative energy that we customers sometimes get when eating in diners, or other restaurants similar to this. So as for her service, it was superb, I wish I remembered her name, but i just can't think of it... Moving on to the more juicy subjects. When dining at TGI Friday's, customers who have a Stripes Card are usually given complimentary chips and salsa, yum! However, it was not so yum as I expected. When the chips and salsa came out, the chips were STALE and COLD! Not a good way to start. However, what was more offensive was when we asked for more fresher and hotter chips and dip, for we partially ate this terrible batch and wanted a better batch, two other workers (not my initial server) came to us and gave us a look of ""these not good enough?"", and one of them actually had the audacity to try and put our practically empty salsa cup on our table, implying we should eat what was left in that cup with our new batch. That did not do, so I kindly told him to take it and give us a new salsa cup entirely. After this whole shinanigens... the chips and dip came out like it should have came out initially, hot and fresh! Moving onto entrees! Now, I am all for burgers, so when I ordered their popular Jack Daniel's burger, it was until after I ordered I realized that the server (yes, my kind server) did not ask me how I wanted the meat to be cooked (rare, medium, well-done, etc.). It turned out to be well-done, but luckily for her and their chef, I actually don't mind eating well-done meats (I usually prefer medium to well-done). The burger was to my liking, thankfully; however, they need to be more conscientious on things like this, for other customers who take these things seriously. The french fries were very good! No complaints on that! So overall I give them a three stars for our kind server and a good meal! I hope they improve on their overall service and food quality because I will be going back, but maybe I'll try a different location... Thanks for reading!

Yolanda D.,"Canton, GA",24,21,13,2.0,9/27/2015,"We've been to this location quite a few times with mediocre success but today supports all the recent poor ratings. There were 3 in our party, here to watch football and have a bite. They offer NO NFL package so the only games on were those shown on regular TV. My team wasn't one them.  We all ordered the endless appetizers, paying the $12 so we could sample multiple types. Each time an order came out we put the order in for the next one. It was 15-20 min before the next apps showed up- that's crazy. The bartender said its because with the endless, they usually come out slower than everything else. That probably should have been on the promotional flyer or told to us when we decided to do it, but I digress. My 2nd app, potstickers, were burnt. We found out later the person preparing them was in the midst of an argument with the manager and allowed them to burn. She was sent home, my husbands order came out perfectly for his 3rd round.  I can't say we will be back. The prices on the menu are over-inflated, probably to make up for all those that have shut down.

When he tried to get a beer for both he and his wife, he was told he couldn't buy two beers at once. That's cool. So he bought one and went back and bought another. On the second round the girl behind the bar insulted him by telling him he seemed suspicious. Not jokingly. We had placed another order for a round of appetizers and 30 minutes later still no appetizers. The order never got submitted. The waiter realized this as he was bringing us the bill, turned, ran back to the kitchen and placed the order. This location is seriously dysfunctional. Everyone appears to be more concerned with socializing with each other than servicing the patron. Shame on this location. You give a really bad rap for an otherwise good restaurant chain.

This place makes everyday feels like a Friday when you dine-in because of the food, which is definitely better than other chains similar to theirs.  I've been to this specific location about greater than 10 times within the past 4 years and several times at the one off Barrett Parkway. Only thing different is that service here tends to vary on who you get as a waiter/waitress.  I love the 3 course meal promotion for 1 person; two set prices based on quantity. I've been here recently for lunch so I don't know if they still have that promotion (usually for dinner  I believe), but they do have a 2 course meal for $10 (either appetizer or dessert and a main entree). My friend and I did this for lunch and we both got: 2 Appetizers = pot stickers and spicy beef queso with chips 2 Entrees = parmesan crusted flounder with rice and vegetables (zucchini and cucumbers) and bruschetta chicken pasta.

If I found out that he moved to a new restaurant, I would give up TGI Friday's as a whole.  His wisdom has proven to me that he truly understands his industry and a decision to leave the famed Friday's chain would be good enough for me to boycott the place.  I mean, that would indicate that there is something terribly wrong with this franchise as a whole.  Cheers to you Jacob.

Scott S.,"Atlanta, GA",174,91,143,1.0,1/5/2010,"Overly Commercialized Crap! Working in Alpharetta doesn't necessarily give you exactly the options to discover some decent dining, sure they are here and there. But being in the suburbs, your choices decrease in the dining category. This TGI Fridays is located off of NorthPoint Pkwy in the middle of mall hell. I guess when you have the financial backing of a large corporation, customer service and food quality aren't priorities, case in point TGI Fridays. You walk in to this place at it wreaks commercial. From the walls plastered with junk you can pick up at a garage sale to the tacky uniforms the servers wear. The exception is the hostess who seated us promptly and wasn't sporting some ridiculous outfit. This restaurant seems to be clean with nothing which stood out giving me any red lights. We sit down and the server takes our order. He seemed a little distracted, maybe he was hung over or something else. I know that waiting on people isn't the easiest thing to do, but try to get with the program. When he arrived with our drinks he proceeded to take our order. I ordered the Jack Daniels burger. I would have preferred if could have been cooked to order - medium. But he informed me it was cooked only one way which was medium well. Maybe they are being cautious because of the previous reports of people becoming sick of salmonella poisoning or worse. I'll accept the answer to that one and give it a pass. When the burger arrived, it didn't even come close to what the picture on the menu looked like. I have always been leery of restaurants having pictures of their dishes in menus. It seems to be a form of deceptive advertising.  The burger was dry and overcooked and everything else was a major let down. The fries were frozen of course, so there's nothing new there. The dish was not memorable and lacked any level of food quality or value. If you are in the middle of the suburbs and starving and the only place you see is TGI Friday's then go.

Kris H.,"Duluth, GA",2,61,,1.0,3/29/2013,"I will NEVER visit this restaurant again. My boyfriend is Mexican and has very basic English skills (he's learning).  I'm a mixed race woman primarily of black American descent.  We chose Fridays for dinner this past Tuesday because neither of us had ever been.  We were seated promptly by a cheerful hostess and our waitress (who was black) was right behind her.  She, however, was much less pleasant. She stared at the TV while greeting us, caught herself, apologized, and did her ""Welcome to Friday's"" shpeel over.  My boyfriend and I both speak Spanish and so that was how we communicated what we wanted to each other before I would tell the waitress or ask her questions.  Whether this started the attitude she had with us for the rest of the night or not, I don't know.  But what I do know was that she was much less attentive to our table than to the other couples (who were black).  She would ask how they were doing and laugh and joke to them about how she couldn't wait to get off so that she and the other employees could mix drinks at the bar. She passed our table four times without saying a word to finish her conversations with the other tables NEXT to ours.  When she finally came to collect our orders, I interpreted some questions that my boyfriend had about making substitutions of sauces for a pasta he wanted.  ""No,"" Before I could finish  the question.  ""No,"" again when he asked for added veggies.  Her tone of voice made it sound as if we ordered an item they would never sell and her expressions were less than professional.  My boyfriend's pasta came out within 20 minutes.  Not bad on the time, horrible on appearance. The pasta we'd ordered was supposed to be-or so we thought-covered in marinara sauce.  We barely saw any.  It had been heaped on his plate, topped with sliced chicken breast and everything was brown due to a sauce that had been poured on.  I tasted his pasta and it was almost as sweet as sugar!  He was going to try and eat it because he didn't ""want to upset her anymore than we already had,"" but I called her over to make sure that we had the right dish. I explained that the pasta hadn't come like we thought that it would.  ""You wanted spinach and mushrooms, pasta and chicken.  The marinara's right here.""  When I asked her about the brown sauce in his dish, she put her knee on a vacant chair at our table and a hand on her hip.  ""It's not sauce, it's balsamic,"" she said. ""And it's not in the pasta, it's on top.""  I asked the waitress to bring us a menu so that we could choose a different dish in case my boyfriend didn't like it.  She shrugged, grabbed a menu, DROPPED it on our table and walked off.  She came back in about 3 minutes and resumed her knee-in-chair, hand-on-hip position.  ""So, did you like it or do you want something else?""  My boyfriend asked me in Spanish why she was raising her voice and she looked down and made one of the nastiest faces I have ever seen in my life. At that point, I'd had enough.  I asked if I could speak to her manager (Jessica).  She nodded and zipped off.  Once I had explained the situation to Jessica, she, of course, apologized about the waitress's behavior, but tried to say that she was probably in a hurry and didn't mean to come off as brusque.  She offered to change our server and our menu choices and went off to have a talk with our waitress.  The waitress emerged from her ""talk"" with a smile and briskly walking towards the bar.  ""Yo,"" she was yelling to one of the male employees.  I've no doubt that she was talking about us..  Every time that she walked past our table for the rest of the night, she would burst out laughing or start talking loudly.  The only thing that kept me from leaving was how politely our new waiter Joseph served us.  He was all smiles, very attentive (he'd even taken a picture for some of the women he'd been waiting on) and an absolute professional.  Every time he passed our table-even though he was working 6 of them-he asked how we were doing.  He offered us dessert on the house as well.  We left him a hefty tip for being so accommodating.  The waitress that had been at our table before wished us a ""great night"" with a smirk on her face and let us know that we were ""welcome to come back any time."" Having worked in customer service for 10 years, I know what is and isn't acceptable behavior in the workplace.  The waitress would not have made it past the interview process if I were her super.  I have never been made feel how she made me feel with my boyfriend that night, and I will never eat here again.  If you do decide to go, the food is average at best.  If possible, ask for Joseph (tall, thin guy with glasses) and avoid the 5' 5-ish dark-skinned black waitress with red weave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=120

Arlynn W.,"Suwanee, GA",26,64,17,3.0,8/24/2009,"I said it in previous reviews - there just aren't many great lunch options near work. Luckily the local TGI Fridays is usually clean, quick & consistent - an ""A-OK"" lunch spot if you're in the area.  I usually prefer TGIFs over Ruby Tuesdays, Applebee's and definitely our local Chili's. The Jack Daniel's grill items are my fav - for instance, my most recent menu selection was the Jack Daniel's burger. Was it the best burger ever? No. But it was flavorful, with perfectly melted Provolone and the ideal amount of bacon, which greatly pleases the carnivore in me :-)  I was especially happy that I could substitute a side salad for the fries {attempting to be sort of low carb} for no additional $$$... nice. The salad was pretty expected, mostly iceberg & romaine lettuce topped with a few cherry tomatoes, slice of cucumber, shredded carrot & a few croutons - which I did skip, thankyouverymuch. I opted for the Asian ginger dressing and was pleased with that as well. A yummy sweet & tangy combo.  Best part about this meal is that it was only around $9; I did have water + lemon to drink. The service was super friendly, but not obtrusive & as usual it was quick. Something always appreciated for a weekday lunch!  Beware that smoking is allowed in the partitioned off bar, but there are two entrances to the bar, one of which is very close to tables, if you sit here, you will smell smoke every time someone goes in or out of those doors. I suggest you request to be seated nearer to the windows, to the right side of the restaurant.  I haven't been to a TGIFs for dinner in some time, but noticed their weekly drink specials, which may entice me to come with the Hubs for dinner - $3 Heineken's & Barefoot Chardonnay?!?

Before it was kinda dark and the booths were a lot more secluded than they are now. Now it's a lot brighter and more open. The renovation (to me) has drastically changed the ambiance. It also seems more ""kid-friendly"" to me and I'm not sure how I feel about that. I guess I don't think a sports bar-type restaurant should be kid-friendly... am I the only one who feels this way?? Well, besides all of that, the host was outstanding! Opened the door for us and EVERYTHING! Our waitress was great also. She was very nice and the food was great.

The Yelp reviews weren't the best but I was with a friend and was only interested in getting some quick drinks and food. The wait to be seated was about 15 minutes. Our server took our drink orders while we decided on a meal.  I ordered the Crown Apple Cooler. The drink was listed as a special and looked interesting. The first round was good. I later ordered a Sangria Rita and the taste was not good. I think the bartender may have been different.  For my entree I ordered the Bourbon Barrel Chicken. The prices were much higher than I remember. The entrees ranged in price from $13 to $25. Around 7:30 a DJ announced his presence and the manager went around advertising karaoke. The music was super loud. A little too loud. It almost reminded me of a club. Definitely not the atmosphere to have a conversation.

The staff wore their Halloween Costumes which added to the festive Halloween decoration hung. My Bartender!! She wore a Mermaid Costume that I absolutely loved along with her partner as a Unicorn.

Daniele X.,"Decatur, GA",57,54,13,2.0,7/3/2015,"Restaurant was almost empty... - 10 minutes before we even saw our server. - 30 minutes for drinks. - I asked to have the lemon and line juice left out of a drink, and both the server and the manager came to confirm.  - Manager made excuses about bad Yelp reviews. - Salad came out with the wrong dressing, and then with tomatoes that I requested left off. - The manager finally comped the meal, but it was too little, too late.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=60
Tracie R.,"Alpharetta, GA",311,3,,2.0,7/11/2016,"I love the food here, but the service is horrible. This is one of my favorite places to hang out for inexpensive drinks and good food. The service at this location is horrible.  I went by the restaurant this evening to have a bite to eat and a drink. When we walked in, it took 10 minutes for someone to greet us. Once we were greeted, they informed me that they were no longer serving food. I explained that was fine, but why would they walk by and not greet us or inform us of their policy. They stated they stop serving food an hour before they close?! I've never heard of that but I accept their rules. Just acknowledge your customers that are entering the establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=60
Tim A.,"Long Beach, MS",13,36,2,2.0,6/13/2015,"We ate here two years ago while playing in a baseball tournament. I have to say that it has fallen greatly. The service is not that good. It's very slow even when they're not busy.  The food quality is nothing to brag about. So, in summary, if you are staying next door at the Sonesta and need something quick, then go here. Otherwise, there is much better food and service just two blocks away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=60
Brittany B.,"Duluth, GA",119,124,92,2.0,5/22/2015,"Exactly what I expect from a TGIFriday's restaurant. Poor service, wait staff who can't get an order correct, bland, dry, undercooked bar food & watered down drinks. This location's food sucks. Potstickers were soggy, boneless wings were cold in the middle, and the potato skins were flavorless & as dry as sand paper. My mom loves this place, so sad to say I'll probably be returning despite the bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=60

Warren M.,"Atlanta, GA",0,15,6,2.0,4/5/2016,Arrived. Seared promptly. Waitress came out. Took drink order. Sons drink took a few minutes. He ordered an Arnold Palmer. Wasn't good. He then order an appetizer consisting of boneless wings. Wings came out bone in. I ordered some chips and salsa. It never arrived. I asked the waitress twice she replied they're coming out.  Got the check no chips or salsa. Manager never spoke as she came out in the area twice. Food was good. Just not good service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=60
Salmata S.,"Duluth, GA",302,5,1,1.0,6/25/2016,Called to make an order and was immediately placed on hold by Shauntel. I was placed on hold for 15 mins without anyone ever returning to the phone to let me know what was going on. I finally decided to hang up after 15 minutes and actually drive to the location. To my surprise the store was not busy at all. I was able to sit at the bar to order takeout without having to step over anyone. That was not the first time I've had an issue with poor customer service at this location. I've just come to expect poor customer service from associates there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=60
Kat A.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,1,,1.0,2/29/2016,"HORRIBLE service the hostess had an attitude and was going to put us on a wait when there was NO one there. And then our waitress went to visit us ONCE and kept going to the same table every single time and would turn her back to ours. Then she brings us our desert and the brownie was uncooked and the ice cream was melted it looked like a mess. she took a long time to come back for the check Waste of time , and MONEY do not go there to eat if ur looking for a good time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=60
Sandra Q.,"Sugar Hill, GA",1,17,5,2.0,10/24/2016,We waited over 10 mins to get our drinks. My Cajun pasta was like it was seated out for a while before it was served because it looked dry and not hot or warm. The service was so slow.  The restaurant was not at all busy so I don't understand the slow service. Our empty appetizer plates were not cleared when the entrees arrive. Don't think I will ever come back to this place,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=60

Jen L.,"Atlanta, GA",208,326,625,4.0,1/3/2014,"3 WORDS: Jack Daniels Menu! Perfection on a plate! The only reason I come to Fridays is for their Jack Daniels Chicken Sandwich, Jack Daniels Salmon, or Jack Daniels Chicken! The actual Jack Daniels sauce is a sweet and fruity blend, slightly hard to explain on paper. I usually dip all sides into the sauce including the mashed potatoes, fries, and even broccoli sometimes.  The drink menu isn't bad and their bar area is quite nice. I must say, I've been coming to Fridays for years (not necessarily this location) and it's always improving. Each server is quite different and they really make a difference in your experience there. Prices are pretty average and you do get what you pay for.  Yes, this is a chain restaurant and most of them are the same but if I were you, I'd definitely give them a try!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-duluth-2?start=60
