Kim M.,"Old Bridge Township, NJ",71,39,21,5.0,11/19/2017,"In between our girls soccer games today we needed to find a place to eat.   At 12:30 I called TGI Friday's and asked if they could accommodate 30 people at around 1:15.  I spoke to a very polite girl named Crystal who put me on a brief hold and returned to tell me they could and she would be our server. She said she would have a table ready with waters already poured and some nachos on the table. We arrived at 1:15 and she immediately greeted us and as promised she had a table set for 30 with waters, nachos and menus. The adults sat at one end and the kids at the other. When asked if we could do separate checks she did not hesitate and happily said yes. She took 9 separate family's checks, which was no easy task since everyone was scattered about. Most restaurants/servers will not to this. She was awesome. Our food came out not only as ordered but all of our checks were correct. Crystal was attentive and courteous. She catered to every single persons needs and wants in a timely manner. 30 people and not one complaint. I would say that is exceptional customer service!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eatontown-3
Sean C.,"College Point, Queens, NY",2,10,,3.0,2/22/2017,"The food at any Friday's restaurant is invariably fresh and delicious, as it was here when my family and I recently visited. Unfortunately, the service is significantly lacking and, by industry standards, just plain old sucks! We waited an inordinate amount of time to be seated, despite the fact that no other party was waiting and several unoccupied tables were within plain sight. The ""greeter"" was busy elsewhere within the restaurant and when hurriedly moving past us exclaimed in an inaudible manner something about taking care of us next. When he eventually came back to the front, he hastily seated us and said how he'd be back with our menus. I watched him seat a few subsequent parties and still neglected to provide us with menus. I finally summoned him and he said, ""Oh, I didn't give you the menus?""  After such a poor beginning to our dining experience, at least the quality of our food changed our downtrodden mood. We visited this Friday's primarily because it was right by the mall but, honestly, will never come here at anytime in the future. There is simply too much competition in the casual dining circuit for us to unjustifiably settle for substandard and utterly deficient customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eatontown-3
Mikey R.,"New York, NY",295,10,6,2.0,2/27/2016,"Bar area stinks like it hasn't been cleaned in a couple days. Rotten beer and trash scent isn't very appetizing. Dirty glasses and countertops. If it's always Friday in here, I'm looking forward to Monday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eatontown-3
Nancy D.,"Matawan, NJ",6,2,,5.0,3/22/2015,"Had Jordan as our server and he was the best, knew it all!!! So happy when we left it's nice to see this place under knew ownership",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eatontown-3
Debra W.,"Eatontown, NJ",0,5,,5.0,4/17/2015,Always stop by the bar for a meal after work at least once a week.  The bartenders are great.  Always going out of their way to make sure everything is great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eatontown-3
Cole V.,"Eatontown, NJ",0,2,,1.0,10/23/2014,Garbage service came once a while ago and said I'd never come back. Well I regret my recent decision to do otherwise.  You would think maybe one time you just get a bad bartender but I did three times all separate people.  The bar is empty and still took 15 solid minutes to even be greeted took 25 for my drinks and had to sit next to a drunken slob that should've been kicked out hours ago. Once I did get my drink it was wrong to top it off.    Servers are inexperienced and it shows greatly.  The place is dirty and someone sitting next to us that came 15 minutes after we ordered got their appetizers first.  Sorry but this is one of the worst restaurants / bars I've ever been to.  And its not just one time that I've dealt with this bad service. They don't even deserve 1 star.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eatontown-3
