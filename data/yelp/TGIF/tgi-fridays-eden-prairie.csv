Kelsey D.,"Minneapolis, MN",8,18,8,2.0,10/7/2010,"This dining experience was totally ""meh."" Unfortunately my grandma will go only here, Perkins, and Olive Garden, so I've been here a few times. I was looking for something relatively healthy and yet satisfying. Answer = chicken cobb salad DOS.  I got through the meal and was questioning why I wasn't feeling as satisfied as I thought I would've. Then it dawned on me... they had forgotten the chicken on my CHICKEN cobb salad. Whoops. Since I had already eaten what I was going to eat, I didn't complain, but it still really irked me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-eden-prairie
