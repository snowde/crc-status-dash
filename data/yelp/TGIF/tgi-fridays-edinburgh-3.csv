Sarah D.,"Westhill, United Kingdom",53,23,219,4.0,1/28/2016,"I realise TGI's only has one review and they definitely deserve more than one star.  I've been regularly to this restaurant at fort kinnaird as they do mon to fri deals with two courses. As I have a weakness for wings, that's pretty much the only starter I've ever had and it's great! Always hot, tasty, great portion size and the blue cheese dip is to die for  I then had the half rack of ribs and they were tender, falling off the bone. I asked for a side salad instead of chips and was present with a huge salad, really delicious! And don't even get me started on the sharing dessert, we shared a brownie with ice cream and it was heaven! The service here is always fantastic, staff are friendly and attentive and go that extra mile. I know TGI's work hard to train them that way and it shows. High five!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-edinburgh-3

Diana T.,United Kingdom,0,7,,1.0,9/24/2015,"To begin on the positive note, the stuff is amazing, really friendly, even though i could go without being called darling every time the waitress comes.  To skip the rest and go to why i didn't enjoy the restaurant - the starters first: i hated the curly fries. It's like biting into a piece of wood. I had the cheese dipping sauce, it had an awful taste.  For the main course we all ordered burgers and i was the only one to get a burned one. At first all i could taste was blend and bitter meat, when i looked inside the burger was completely black.  Inside were once again the dreaded wooden curly fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-edinburgh-3
