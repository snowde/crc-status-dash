Joey S.,"El Cajon, CA",99,6,,1.0,11/12/2017,"Place is full of shit. First of all, they dont accept passport cards...which is a government issued id. They said it was ""company policy"". The guy at the bar was rude af. He said a passport id didnt have a full description of you and that u cant drive with it. Last i check i didnt know your ability to drive had anything to do with your ability to drink! Plus he was being super condescending about the whole thing. If you're going to throwing facts about unacceptable ids, atleast get your facts straight and make some sense.    Acceptable Forms of ID - California A valid driver's license issued by federal, state, county, or municipal government. A valid passport. A valid passport card. An identification card issued by the Armed Forces of the United States that contains the name, date of birth, description, and picture of the person.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon
Adam R.,"San Diego, CA",0,3,,1.0,10/8/2017,"If i could give it 0 stars i would at least for this visit. Im a regular and understand when its busy and when its not. I've reviewed this place before since 1. Ive had a hair in my food. The manager was informed by the waitress and i didnt request free food or discount or anything (shit happens).  2. We had a fly in our salad still alive wings full of dressing so it couldn't fly. Again i didnt complain but the manager cam up and apologized and tried to give us free stuff basically. No need we denied. (Shit happens). The reason for the bad review today..... Im fair and give credit when service is great but also when its bad. I visited today and service when busy is usually kinda slow. Sat in the bar area in a booth. Service was extra slow. I usually have 3,4 , sometimes 5 beers. My first beer came about 20 mins after i ordered it. 2nd beer was served and sat at the bar for over 10 mins. My waitress walked passed it and got other drinks next to it. I HATE HOT BEER. i finally got up and asked if that was mine since it had a glass of limes next to it ( not a lot of people asking for 5 lime per beer) that's the how i knew it was mine. Now i fully understand that im not the only customer and Sunday happy hour can get hectic. Im not an a self center a hole that needs to have a personal waitress at his disposal. When i was half way done with my second beer i asked my waitress to go ahead and start the order for my 3rd thus giving them enough time while i finish my second beer. The bartender came this time and brought me my beer to my table slammed it and spilt some on my table, and kindly said ""hope it was fast enough for you this time"". I can deal with slow, flies , and hair in my food is inevitable. (Shit happens). Being a smartass with a customer about not wanting my beer to sit and get hot for 10 plus minutes is not good. Won't return to this location again. Love Fridays and willing to drive further for better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon
M R.,"La Mesa, CA",6,77,323,3.0,12/1/2017,"I had a good experience with my friends for happy hour and usually do. It can be hit and miss depending on the cook such as undercooked wings that are tough and potato skins that are tasteless. But, at times the food can be on point.

We asked for a quiet place to sit and we were given a booth in the back of the place close to a large party that was just finishing up and leaving. The waitress was nice and helpful. She told us about the half off appetizers so we ordered the beef sliders which were delicious. The one issue with our table was that there was no lighting. A bulb was missing from the light at the table and there was no overhead lighting. I actually had to use the flashlight on my phone to read the menu which also has small print.  If these issues could be fixed, I'd give it another try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon

Maritess C.,"Imperial Beach, CA",653,1127,4679,4.0,1/22/2017,"I came to TGIF for an early dinner. We had a buy one get one free coupon. I love a great steak so I got a 10 ounce steak, medium well with a baked potato with butter and chives, and rice pilaf. I got an iced water to drink since I was filled with soda earlier. The steak was delicious and cooked perfectly. The sides were good as well. The rice pilaf was thin rice rather than the dense rice. The baked potato was soft. A filling and delicious meal.  The service was excellent by our waitress. She refilled my water and checked up on us a couple of times. At the end, I received a birthday ice cream dessert which was a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate and caramel sauce with whipped cream topped with a cherry. It was great! I ate the dessert all by myself.  There's plenty of parking up front and waiting to be seated was fairly quick even though they were busy. They also have a bar area where you can just enjoy alcoholic drinks. A very chill place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon
Mansour S.,"Rancho San Diego, San Diego, CA",121,222,1022,5.0,2/3/2017,"I mostly sit on bar for happy hour and customer service is good , their food is pricy so i go only for happy hours ( i prefer casino buffets for seafood & steaks ) which the offer is 1/2 of appetizers $4.25 tall drafts $1.5 fries basket $5.5 3 cheese burger sliders ( used to be $4.5 ) Customer service on my first visit wasnt good after that its great nothing wrong ( i visited arround 9 times after that ) i live in the area and they offer best happy hour menu . The burger sliders are amazing the beef it self has this distinguished taste that confuses my taste buds and makes me happy lol , its the standard cheese burger with no othe sauces or dressings that will make the flavourless patty taste good .

Clover E.,"El Cajon, CA",71,33,72,4.0,5/31/2017,"Unlike many of the reviews here, we thought our food was great. We arrived on a Wednesday evening to support our local schools music program (TGIFridays donated 20% of the total bill to the program). We were seated within 15 minutes (the hostess said it would be 15-20 mins). We ordered the pot stickers appetizer, delicious! 3 main courses of Jack Daniels Ribs plate, wing burger (a cheeseburger with 2 chicken wings secured to the top bun with a skewer) & a chicken burger sandwich. The chicken dish looked a bit burnt & we were concerned, but I was told it was incredibly delicious & moist. Both the other two dishes were just as tasty. The mashed potatoes could've used a tad more love, but they were good plain as they were. The vanilla bean cheesecake was scrumptious & I'll definitely order that again!  Our waitress was exemplary, but clearly overworked in an understaffed restaurant. Completely not her fault, but there were delays on getting extra napkins/condiments & drink refills. Her great personality & direct acknowledgment of the delays with her apologies were sufficient in my book. We also didn't follow the rules & print out the flyer we needed for the school promotion & she  helped us with that too.  I'm only leaving out a star due to the delays. That could've easily been avoided had they been adequately staffed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon
Lin B.,"San Diego, CA",66,25,6,3.0,9/1/2017,I wanted to give a better rating since the steak and the alcoholic beverages were great however I have to make a comment about the lobster tail I received. I understand that this is not a seafood restaurant but the size of the lobster tail was almost as big as maybe a large butterfly shrimp! I was so disappointed! After it was cooked it shriveled up in size and literally was like a bite size taste of lobster. For the amount of money that's paid for in addition I would expect a little bit bigger. But I guess what was I expecting to get quality from a franchise restaurant. If I wanted better I should had went somewhere else!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon

But, its not the best for their food and service. Every time i go to tgi fridays there food is not cooked right or sometimes they're cold.

Joseph S.,"Alpine, CA",14,181,15,3.0,9/26/2017,"Wow! The reviews are tough. But, I certainly understand them. I loved this chain...I took my wife there (in New Orleans) just after I proposed. It was ""our spot"" so to speak. We've been there many times since we moved to SDiego, at Camino Del Rel (now closed) and we've tried this location in Rancho San Diego, but with sad results. The quality and quantity of the food was off-setting. Service was pretty good and the waitress was pleasant as well as attentive. No problem there. I guess we're going to have to find another ""spot"" to call our place because I don't see them lasting much longer either. Sorry to say that I was disappointed, because like I said, this chain has a special meaning for me. It would have been Popeyes Fried Chicken (my favorite) but she was dressed up too nice to take her there after the proposal, right?

John S.,"San Diego, CA",345,527,96,4.0,11/30/2016,"Happened to be in the area on a football Sunday and was looking for a place to watch the Chargers play. Friday's seemed like a safe bet for decent food and a guarantee that the game would be on. When I pulled up to the parking lot, there were so few cars around I wondered if the place was even open. Well, it was - just with two or three tables of customers. I was a little worried about seeing so few people in a large chain like this, but decided to give it a try anyway. Besides, I had my pick of bar tables and the best screen right in front of me. I checked out some previous reviews and most of the negative reviews seemed situational and didn't discourage me.  I ordered a simple breakfast burrito and a strawberry margarita ($6.50 happy hour price). My wife got steak and eggs and bottomless mimosas ($10). The breakfast burrito came with brown sugared bacon and hash browns (got them on the side) and I chose tater tots as my side dish. It was $8 for the burrito dish and was actually really good. The tots were perfect - not greasy, had decent flavor and had good crunchy texture.  My wife's steak was a bit bland but nothing to really complain about.  Also, they have Happy Hour all day on Sunday with a long list of specials in the bar (Sunday Social). So, despite the low ratings and this being a large chain - I'll be back for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon

Not how I wanted to spend my night, worse yet was we kept the whole house awake with all of our noise. I don't know that I have ever been so sick. My son weak as can be says "" dad I don't want to ever go back to fridays"". Really can't blame the poor guy, in bed no school the next day, myself as well.

Our server wasn't pleasant and her hospitality wasn't the greatest. The nice part was we were dine in and not seated at the bar but she still gave us the happy hour prices.

Manager does not inform her servers about new promotions before they start their shift. Not sure if it's laziness or a lack of communication on both ends.

Second I went to use the restroom and wow I couldn't believe how dirty and disgusting it was. All over the floor there was pee, the toilet was clogged and there was no wax paper to put on the toilet seat. The food is hit or miss. You'll never know if your going to get a delicious meal or an upset stomach. I got an upset stomach. My sister came in with her own water because she can't drink the water they serve because it causes her to get a reaction to her skin. The manager felt that she can't have that water and that she needs to confiscate it and spill it out but we told her that my sister will stop drinking her water from her bottle. Are you kidding me your worried about someone bringing in water from outside but your not worried about your dirty restroom or disgusting food. What a joke.

Tostadas tasted pretty good, except there was one tiny piece of beef on each tostada...no lie/exaggeration. The bbq chicken flatbread tasted like overly burnt thin crust dried out pizzas w literally 3 tiny pieces of chicken on the entire dish. Lol. The boneless wings were tasty...they couldn't skimp on the meats there. Would have given more stars if food looked more like the pictures (referring to beef tostadas etc.). Spinach dip & green bean fries were Ok. They tasted cold when they got to our table. Maybe we'll go back, but for real meals. We've been to other locations n usually food is good .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=100

Well, today had some papers to correct so I decided to kill two birds with one stone an have dinner and get some work done before I went home to RELAX.  I got a both with some light from a nearby window so I could see what I was doing. This place is just naturally dark, even in the middle of the day. The first couple of benches I passed had crumbs on them, so I passed on them but the third one was okay.  I ordered the Angus burger with cheese and the vanilla bean cheese cake for the $10 deal and a unlimited Iced Tea for $2.99. The burger was good and the Angus beef patty had good flavor. ( ) The bun however seemed a little on the old side. It was still edible but it did not have that fresh feeling. Overall, it was a good descent burger. Instead of fries, I had the mashed potatoes with cheese. ( ) The mashed potatoes were good. They were more on the lumpy side than silky. The cheese was very limited and I would not of known it was there if I did not see the few strands. The vanilla bean cheese cake was great for a chain. The presentation was actually pretty nice as well. ( )  The vanilla bean came through nicely and the graham cracker crust was super. I have to say, the cheese cake was the highlight of my meal.

But going back to the customer service. We are usually promptly seated and our drinks are ordered in no time. But after that, where does our waiter go? We actually had to track down another server to ask for our drinks. Anyway, 20 mins pass and we finally see our waiter and she apologizes since it's been really busy and they were short staffed. Ok forgiven so we order an appetizer, the all you can eat appetizer and my sons meal. 30 Mins later my sons meal is served but where's our other order? Or server says few more minutes and it should be out. Few minutes turned to an additional 30 where my son has already finished.  So I re-order another set of my all you can eat appetizer and that took another 15 mins.  We wanted to order dessert but considering how long of a wait we've been having, we opted out. We spent almost 2hrs there where it usually takes us 45mins to an hour.  And on top of the wait, we saw our waiter a total of 2 times. The rest were different servers. Maybe she went on break?

We went back on 2 more occasions (once to give them anther shot and once for an event) and were disappointed each time. The service at this location does not compare to any other location of this chain I have ever eaten at. They are either very pushy and make me feel rushed, or are never available making me feel abandoned.  I have had to send food back to the kitchen 2 out of 3 visits. Once due to kitchen error and once due to server error. I have always had to flag down a waiter to get a drink refill and this past time the waiter kept making grunting sounds when asked for a refill. This on top of having to remind him each time what I was drinking (because lemonade is so hard to distinguish from other drinks.) This is also the slowest location I have ever been too. It takes them 2x - 3x longer then the other locations within SD county and there is always an excuse, even when they are not busy. I love TGIF, but I do not like this location.

The waitress' attitude is so unbelievably horrible anyone who works in a restaurant environment knows that attitude is a big plus in this kind of job type actually any kind of job type you should always have a good attitude.

Remember treat other the way you would want to be treated and I know for a fact the waitress would not want this kind of customer service she is giving. She even had the nerve to ask the manager to come serve my table and not herself it's not like we had the attitude. Anyways, if it was up to me I would have rated this place zero stars but I do not have that option so that is why they are only getting one but like I said before it's so unfortunate that I will no longer be coming here anymore.

We had to ask her at least 3 times for a refill! She didn't check up With us in case we needed something!

Taylor S.,"San Ysidro, CA",59,1,,3.0,11/10/2015,"Came here tonight and the hostess at the door was rude. She asked if we wanted happy hour and had menus in her hands and we said yes and so she told us, ""you can only sit at the tables in the bar NOT the booths"" and gave us this dirty look trying to enforce the ""NOT the booths"". My friend and I looked at her like okay and my friend asked if we could sit at the booths not thinking she already said NO and she replies, ""no YOU canNOT sit there only at the TABLES"" and closed her eyes for a second and gave us another dirty, irritated look. So I asked, ""so I can't sit at the BAR? cus that is where I want to sit"" and she says, ""yeah"" and I walked away and sat at the bar and she didn't follow us she went elsewhere.  Oh and I ordered a salad and they forgot to bring it out. They were okay with taking it off my bill though.  Overall the hostess needs to be in a better mood when working. I read a previous review and I'm assuming they're speaking of the same hostess.  I'm new to the area and I don't see myself coming back here.

Louis L.,"El Cajon, CA",29,35,5,5.0,9/28/2015,We came in for appetizers mainly and got service that exceeded excellence. Our server Travis was really nice and checked up on us every two minutes. The food was really good and was amazing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=120
Ashley R.,"El Cajon, CA",0,8,,2.0,9/6/2016,"So to start out, usually my experience (I usually sit at the bar) is 4 - 5 stars. Now the reason for my 2 star review (only salvaged from a 1 star because of the wonderful Kevin and Hector from positive past experiences) is because of not one but 2 visits (in the last 4 days (yes that close together)).  The first visit was with my parents, we sat in the lounge area but not at the bar so that was our mistake. Our hostess served us more than our server that day. On average I'd say our server checked on us once every 20 - 30 minutes which would have been fine but our food took over 40 minutes and drinks didn't get refilled until the (third?) stop in by our server. It was really slow that day in the bar area...  The second visit (which is why I've given 2 stars despite coming in and having many positive experiences) was tonight and not only was I checked on infrequently (though not as bad as when I came in with my parents (I sat at the bar this time)) but I was also mis-charged. I believe part of it was because the bartender who was on was newer (I've never seen her bartending before) however the fact I was charged double for the food I ordered is why I'm posting this review. I don't know if this is going to be a norm for this restaurant as I was (up until this point) quite fond of coming here however the last two experiences are making me rethink if I ever want to come here again. I doubt management reads this however if they do I suggest looking over the training of your staff and following through with some type of test or random check to make sure they uphold standards because the standards here are more than slipping of late and at this point it is highly doubtful I will be back.  I'm sad to leave a review like this because honestly if I had posted 2 - 3 months ago it would be 4 - 5 star reviews across the board however the most recent visits have made me rethink where I spend my money. I won't say for sure I'll never be back (if only because of past experiences) but if I experience on more bad experience I can say I definitely won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=120

I ordered 3 sliders and a basket of fries.

The drinks took another 20 minutes to arrive.

The waitress was attentive to how quickly we went through our sodas, our food came out quickly, and our orders were correct.  The quality of the food was the problem. We ordered a smoked stacked burger, bourbon chicken, and chicken strips. The burger was bland and tasted like a frozen patty. The bourbon chicken had good flavor but the chicken was rubbery.

Wayne B.,"San Diego, CA",0,2,,1.0,7/22/2016,"Used to love this place. Good service, good food and a great atmosphere... Went in today, early evening, not too busy. One of the bartenders that we see fairly regularly is on, and greets with a welcome back. Then he gets busy talking to another couple and absently washing glasses as he talks. Another bartender takes our drink order, and then starts preparing drinks from the ticker. 10-15 minutes in. I get her attention and ask her to let the other bartender know that we're ready to order. She tells him, he says okay, and then continues his conversation with the couple he has been conversing with for now, the last 20 minutes. Again I get the other bartender's attention and ask for the check for my drink. She tells the asshole who's been ignoring us for, now 25 minutes. He walks to the register, prints the ticket, lays it on the bar in front of us and goes back to his conversation. Until today, I have never left less than 20% tip.

I like that they have a lot of Jack Daniels inspired burgers and sauces but I am not a huge bbq sauce fan.  We went in the early afternoon so the place wasn't very busy.

Upon entering we were greeted by a still standing but very sad looking Christmas tree - a week after Christmas.  I sat in the bar area. Right next to the bar chairs with the torn seats that should have been replaced long ago.  The whole place smelled like a wet dish rag.  I'm not kidding. I ordered Buffalo wings with bleu cheese dressing and celery sticks.  Waiter was fine, very polite.  The wings took a while to get but were very good.  The celery looked like it was old.  The TWO pieces I got were YELLOW with BROWN ends.  Yeah, TWO pieces!  Thanks!  I should have put them in the overflowing trash can by the front door.  Maybe that's why it's overflowing. The waiter finally checked on me when I had already finished the wings.  He saw that I didn't touch the celery and even commented on how bad they looked. He agreed that it never should have been served to me.  But that was it.  No offer to replace or fix, just laughed it off.  No discount offer, apologies, or anything.

And this white lady with blonde hair around 3:00 pm . tried to have us sit in the back corner table when we asked for one of the empty booths she said because we have a baby in a stroller we couldn't sit there except for the corner table next to the bathrooms and exit it was disgusting how they treated us only because we had a baby I will never go here again and I will tell everyone I know to not go to TGI fridays because of what happened here they are NOT KID FRIENDLY AT ALL and if you have a baby DO NOT GO HERE I witnessed 2 family's get told it was going to be a 20-25 min wait when the place was empty and they both went somewhere els just like we did didn't even try the food but from what I heard the food isn't good at all rubbery steak and cold food plus takes along time to get even the appetizers we went to Applebee's and they were a lot nicer and it was super good food plus kid friendly and really nice waitress don't ever go to TGI fridays you'll be a lot happier going to Applebee's I promise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=60
Anne M.,"Lemon Grove, CA",0,17,1,2.0,3/14/2017,"Don't order the mashed potatoes.  I told my server that I was disappointed to pay $25 a plate and have dehydrated potatoes. Potatoes are pretty cheap afterall. She told me they weren't dehydrated, but most people know that these potatoes have a distinct flavor and texture. The manager told me they are ""pouch potatoes."" The appetizers were excellent and the drinks were great. The food was ok. Also...check your bill. I brought in a coupon for a free entrée and they didn't deduct it. Also got charged full price for happy hour apps. Bill came out for two people (2 dinners, 2 non-alcoholic  drinks and 2 apps) to be $74. This was my birthday and I guess they don't even give a free scoup of ice cream or sing happy birthday anymore...but maybe it's because I asked about the potatoes...I guess I should have kept my mouth shut and just ate the cafeteria potaotes.

Excellent. Many of the tables were dirty. In fact we sat at a dirty table before realizing. Then decided to move to the clean table behind us. While there were only three in my party it was the only clean table that was in the area and not next to a larger rowdy group.  The hostess then returned a short while later asking us to move because she knows large parties will come in. Because she's worked there a while. She knows. But you don't have to move. But she could clean a table. It's not a big deal. Passive aggressive, right. It was 1047 when I left. Over half the bar tables were open. Too much to write here. But after the way she spoke to us it was clear they did not need my business. Clearly.  I will be calling Buddy, the GM tomorrow. I cannot believe the terrible guest service I received.

Sarah H.,"Spring Valley, CA",35,18,1,1.0,3/16/2017,"This place was a favorite of mine years back but as time has went on, it keeps getting worse and worse. The last 2 times we went with friends, we were there for almost 2 hours each time. Not by choice mind you. That's how long it took to feed 3-4 people who weren't ordering much. Knowing how slow they have been lately, my family and I showed up for dinner at 4pm hoping to eat by 4:45-5. We had a time crunch and prayed they could hurry up. The place was pretty dead when we arrived and we asked to be seated at the bar area so we could get happy hour prices on the sliders and fries. It was myself, my boyfriend, our 3 year old, and baby. The waitress didn't even get to our table for 15 minutes. Once she got there, she apologized and asked what our drinks were. I let her know we were there for the $10 endless apps that have been advertised heavily during the TV commercial lately. She said she could get the menu but that it was a separate menu. Now the commercials state they are ""here to stay"" which indicates a permanent part of the menu. Why are they not in the menu I was given while I sat down? Anyways, she then goes on to let us know that 1 of the 2 fryers is broken so all of the food on the Endless Apps menu is going to take 25 minutes EACH to come out. My boyfriend asks her to just put in 2 orders for each of us at a time, that way we aren't waiting an hour for 2 appetizers a piece. She says no they can't do that on the endless apps. I was floored. She actually thought I had time to wait that long for our food. Their fryers were broken and instead of making an exception to the rule since it was their problem, they would rather have customers walk out. My family and I wasted over 20 minutes to get no food and have to get dinner at the drive through because at this point there was no time. I won't ever come spend my money here again. I should have complained to the manager at the time but I was too hungry and shocked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=60

Nice enough to see there was a dirty one, asked to clean it for us and sat us down. We ordered the spinach dip and was pretty good. Although it was odd there were fries with the chips. We got burgers with fries and the buns were really dry. My bread fell apart after 2 bites.

At Fridays, the food has always been consistently good and in past experiences the service has been awesome too.  My first time at the Rancho San Diego location was last night before an 8 p.m. movie.  The food was still awesome (love the spicy queso dip appetizer) - but our server must have been new and needed additional training.  We arrived just before 7 and I was seated right away while BF went to buy movie tickets across the parking lot for an 8:00 show -- it took our assigned server quite awhile to show up at the table.  I ordered drinks for both of us (we were trying to get a jump start on drinks and food before the movie).  I was asked for ID and was told I could not order a drink for my guest until he showed up.  I am almost 52 and my BF is 48 so this was irritating in and of itself (I informed the server when producing my ID that my BF is close to my age but she was clearly not buying it).  Then, when my BF showed up and the the server was not sure if she could serve us when he could not produce an ID (I drove), we almost got up and walked out.  She relented and said it was ""OK"", but then asked if we wanted our drinks (Captain and Cokes) ""on the rocks"".  I guess I kind of giggled and had to ask ""as opposed to what?""  I was then given an education and told that ""well it's a matter of preference really, a lot of people order them straight up"" - really? A LOT of people order rum and coke straight up?  LOL.  At end of meal, we had to keep asking for our check and reminding her we were on our way to movie and then, as we were walking out (we left cash sufficient for tab and tip), the server actually stopped taking another customer's order to tell us she had not run our card yet -- we politely informed her we didn't use a card, and that there was cash on the table - I swear she was going to ask us to wait so she could check to see if we had actually paid.  Anyway, loss of stars for sub-standard service, but perhaps we will return to see if this location can redeem itself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=180

Corey H.,"El Cajon, CA",57,195,37,2.0,7/19/2011,"The food at TGI Fridays has always been decent to me. Its sort of an upscale version of greasy bar food... or at least their attempt....  This particular location is fun cause there is a movie theater next to it with lots of other shops in the mall. So location is a plus. The inside is pretty large as are most of the Fridays that I know of. The bar itself is double sided which allows for a good amount of people to sit at it. They have plenty of beers on tap (about 10) and they have a very extensive liquor collection. The menu its self offers a pretty large variety of things which I like. There wings are actually pretty good.  The big downside... is waiting at the bar when its not even close to being busy. I sat at this bar for dinner and drinks with a buddy. Every time I needed another beer or to order food I had to wait over 5 minutes with only a few people at the bar. I wasn't waiting because the bartenders were busy with other customers, they weren't cleaning, they weren't talking business or running science experiments to figure out the next BIG drink. NO! It was because the dumb bartenders were too busy throwing bottles in the air like they were Tom Cruise in Cocktail. They literally would sit there and toss and toss and toss while I'm sitting there with an empty beer and with a menu in my hand waiting to order.

Wanted to try more drinks. Oh btw first time going to any TGIF chain. I'm glad I heard good reviews of drinks here. We also got spinach aritchoke dip, chicken (I forgot what it was called but had an asian zing to it) and my go to french fries. Best artichoke dips hands down!

After that we decided to sit in the bar area there was 4 of us so we sat at the 5-6 person bar table . It was slow, and the table only had 5 chairs. As soon as we sat the hostess that had a  ""great"" comment before came and said, ""you guys are lucky it's slow or id ask you sit that the 4 seater"". Wow awesome attitude lady!!!  Any ways so we ordered our food from the ""waiter"", he came twice to take both drink and good order. We ended up ordering appetizers first after a sold 45 mins the waiter brings the food, still mind you we ordered drinks, only water was served. Right after we got our appitizers the waiter went on a smoke break I guess.... he came back in after no washing his hands or anything walked right up to us and asked what our drinks were again. I'm sorry but at that point I laughed out loud. I mean really anyways back to the food it was good no complaints there in the least and that where they actually get the stars.  We waited for  our drinks to come and then decided not to order actual entrees, due to the disgusting service. When the waiter can back to ask if we were gonna order a meal, he scoffed.

Neil T.,"San Diego, CA",626,70,206,3.0,8/8/2015,"I saw a commercial for TGIF and it had the unlimited appetizer special again for $10.  So the way it works is for $10 you can get unlimited appetizers from a special menu but the catch is you can only get the same thing that you ordered.  For $12 you can pick different appetizers each time so I think it's worth the extra $2. We tried: Buffalo, cider glaze, miso and Memphis bbq for the boneless wings.   I liked the Buffalo and bbq.  The cider glaze tasted like cinnamon toast crunch.  Miso was an Asian type of taste.  We also got mozzarella sticks,  loaded potato skins,  pan seared pot stickers, and bbq chicken Flatbread. The loaded potato skin was fried and not baked.  I personally didn't like it.  The bbq chicken Flatbread was pretty tough and I only ate one peice.  Overall, TGIF is ok.  If you have nowhere else to go, then head out here.  This is my 4th or 5th choice of places to go if everything else is closed or busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=40

He never once asked how our food was. Never brought us refills on drinks. Didn't even apologize for the nasty used butter he brought. Only reaction was ""oh, yea that happens sometime"". Haha really?! Then to top it off I tried to pay with a gift card and the manager came to the table saying there was a problem with their machine.

Dezarai G.,"San Diego, CA",41,28,,1.0,11/22/2015,"I hate giving bad reviews and actually this is my first bad review. I have always loved Fridays and been to many different locations and had great food and service...except for this location. We've been here a few times and have had good food but really terrible service. Every time it's worse than the last time. We went a few weeks ago for Monday night football and our waitress and a few others were to busy drinking and chatting with the bartender to provide any service. Tonight was the worst by far. It was 3:30 on a Sunday and the place was pretty empty. We walked in and told the hostess we would sit in the bar area. We sat in a booth in the bar area and a waitress came by to tell us that the booth is not open seating. She was going to check if someone was waiting. When she returned she told us next time we couldn't sit there because it's not self seating. Then she walked away. We left without ordering. It's one thing to get a lack of service, especially if the place is busy but to get reprimanded then ignored is not something I want to experience at a restaurant. If she had been nice or asked us to move we would have happily done so and continued our meal which I'm sure would have been great. I really hope they improve their service.

Amanda M.,"Las Vegas, NV",20,47,1,2.0,11/29/2011,"From some of the reviews, it seems they have a new manager who is trying to turn things around. Which is awesome, but they still need to do some work on their employees. Our server brought my friend the wrong drink, and didn't realize until later when somehow the bartender figured out the situation and made us the correct drink. Score free drink? Except my friend is sensitive to certain alcohols and the Whiskey in the drink instead of whatever she had ordered made for an unpleasant evening later on. From there in on out, the service continued to be late and lackluster...the waitress seemed to be putting on a fake act to try and get tips versus actually caring about our service and experience. It wasn't even a busy night or anything, and I saw a few of the wait staff kind of lounging around the wait station in between orders. Being in food service, I try to have more compassion, but I expect more from a chain that can afford to train their employees.  Oh, and the kicker? We should have realized we were in for trouble after we put our name in for a table (short wait, and the place died down before we got sat) and they LOST us. Two of our party were smokers and when we came back in to check on the status of our table they said they had no record of us, they must have 'lost the piece of paper that had our names.' Again, this is appalling service from a chain. Even the range I go to has a buzzer system for people waiting for lanes...for a national chain to rely on scraps of paper for a table to get seated seems ridiculous.  Our food was ok. Usual TGI Friday's stuff, got the 2 for 20 deal and loved the cheese cake / ability to swap out appetizers. The adult milkshakes is a brilliant idea. But the French Onion soup that I remembered so fondly from childhood paled in comparison to Hooleys' right down the way and I sort of wished I'd gone there instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=220

I went in with 3 of my friends last week, and unfortunately I had a waitress who sucked!! her name was Alisha, she was somewhat a short white girl with a snotty attitude. When I ordered an alcoholic drink she asked for my ID which I gladly gave it to her, than she tells me do I have another ID!! So I go digging in my purse for my PASSSPORT!! I didnt even want that to mess up my night so I was like what ever. She then brings my drink and I took a nice sip and what happens... it did not taste like there was any alcohol in it!! I know my drinks pretty well especially knew that drink very well because Ive had it so many times at other TGI Fridays. I then have to call her over and tell her about it, instead of saying sorry I can bring you another one she rudely says how Im wrong and that everything is measured out blahh blahh blahh, that she can add a shot to it which she will charge me!! To me this was complete bs, she was being so rude about it and basically calling me a lair. So I decide to order a different drink , this time the drink was perfect!! After that she seemed pist off that I told her about the drink, like as if she was the one who made the damn drink, which she is only a waitress so she should stay in her fkn line of serving!! Anywho, she then brings all of my friends their plates and of course she brings mine minutes later!! My food wasn't even warm when i got it!!! Not once did she stop by to check on us and see how we were doing.!! All in all this place sucks, because of the poorly way this waitress was to my friends and I. I do NOT recommend her service or this place!! save ur money and go elsewhere.

Honestly, the service is absolutely terrible. For the last 4 times I've been there, they've been awful. They're incredibly slow. Ridiculously slow. Oh yeah, did I mention they were slow? I've literally sat there for 2 1/2 hours when we only ordered an appetizer, a soup, and one meal. And the last time I went, I went with 3 other friends. We were taken to our table and then had to wait 25 min before our waitress took our drink orders, and then she rolled her eyes at us as she did it. We literally got up and walked out. What kind of crap is that? I mean, do you NOT want our business? None of us were rude or giving her a hard time, none of us even made weird comments. Nothing. I guess she just decided we were just an inconvenience. Never going back there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=220

My GF had a sampler platter with something that looked and tasted like chicken McNuggets, the tiniest ribs you""ve ever seen, a salad and a side.  Nothing special and about enough to feed a bird. We tipped the waitress well and thanked here for her service but came away with the feeling we got the shake-down.  I don't know about the other TGI's but for this one the manager should be fired.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=200

We finished the spinach dip and still no beer.  I ordered the nachos supreme and my wife ordered the wedge salad.  When the food came out I thought they brought out the wrong food because there was nothing supreme about the nachos. There was a total of 7 pieces of chicken all the size of a chocolate chip. When the waitress finally came to check on us I had to ask for my beer. She said she thought the runner would have brought it. She disappeared for a few minutes to come back and tell me they had to change the keg. Instead of changing my order and having to wait another 25 minutes for my beer I just left it as is. She finally brought the beer and just dropped it off and ran away. We didn't see her again until we were finished. She came to the table like she already new it was bad. She looked at wife brown and wilted lettuce and asked if she liked it. The answer was no.

Took 8 mins after being seated for someone to ask us if we were thirsty. Got our drinks and some girl introduced herself as our server and said she would be right back to take our order. By this time we were already ready to order and it was annoying that she didn't just take our order right then. I don't know how long after that but another server saw that we had been waiting forever so he just stepped in and took our order which she came over and seemed to get upset with him even though he was doing the right thing. She comes back in 5 mins and says ""your food will be right out"" 10 mins go by and still no food. So we got up and left. Think we were there for over 30 minutes and it wasn't busy at all and there was plenty of staff around 9pm. We went to apple bees down the street where we were greeted and given drinks the second we walked in. We were checked on every time our server walked by.

Aaron E.,"Oceanside, San Diego, CA",5,127,71,2.0,1/8/2015,"First, the reason I give this place 2 stars is because the service was good and attentive.  That means they earned stars from zero in my book.  I think one has be suspect when your waiter brings your steak and automatically brings you A1 sauce without asking for it.  Obviously this means there is no flavor, which was exactly right.  The broccoli wasn't even steamed fully, which oh well.  There was basically no one there when I got there, and it was a bit chilly inside (oh well I own a sweater) and it remained dead until I left.  It took 30 minutes to be seated, served, and receive my meal.  It only took me 6 minutes to leave.  Based on my experience, the vast majority of these reviews are accurate, they need to make some major management changes.  It's most likely a franchise and frankly the owner obviously doesn't seem to care what the general public thinks.  Being that it's attached to a hotel/convention site (which is dilapidated on its own) I doubt they're going to do much of anything to fix their business.  The pure lack of responses from a manager or owner shows just how little they care about their patrons.  The few 4 and 5 star reviews are, what I suspect without any proof, regular bar clients, which frankly don't fill seats.  That's my experieince, try it if you wish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=200

We said sure and the same appetizer, not a new order, came out warmed.

I was quite dissatisfied with the service that I did not receive from any of the staff at this location. There was not even the usual cheerful greeter welcoming us in.  Before I walked into the restaurant, I could see four employees huddled around on an empty table chit-chatting so I figured it was not busy.  The bar had several customers but it did not call for what I expected tonight. I sat myself and two other guests down in the bar hoping a waitress/waiter would eventually greet us. NO ONE did. Few minutes pass and employees walked by, not saying a single word to us. The bartender walked out of the bar to assist customers at a different table but simply glanced at us and looked away. Another particular employee, bald and tall with a mustache, walked past our table five times in the next five minutes ignoring us.  Not even a nod or a wave. Yet he asked the table next to us when he was serving them if they needed anything else.  I was hoping a manager was around but since the employees do not acknowledge their guests, why bother? My guests and I left with a digusted look on our faces. Was it because in this white dominant part of San Diego do they not treat their customers of different ethnicies equally?

Darrell H.,"San Diego, CA",9,151,21,2.0,3/13/2013,"Went to this location for dinner before a movie. At first the waitress seemed very attentive and took our drink orders and then our food orders. The appetizers came quickly and then followed by our food. The food itself is exactly what you would expect from a chain restaurant. It was nothing special, but it was not anything to write home about. Still good enough for me to take the left overs with me into the theater for 2nds. What was disappointing was the service we received once the food was delivered. We never say the waitress again until I was asking for a check. This meant we never received any refills and I was never asked how the food was. This is a big deal for me since I am paying close to $3 for a soda that never got refilled.

Warren W.,"Plano, TX",518,261,11,4.0,5/3/2007,"Surprising.  Surprisingly quiet.  Surprisingly friendly.  Surprisingly good food. Went there on a Sunday afternoon on the way home from church, and fully expected the place to be full of post-church families, especially since it's only a couple blocks away from a rather large local house of worship.  But as it turned out, there was hardly anybody there - just a couple parties who hardly put any strain on the wait staff.   I'm sure that helped put the staff in a good mood, and allowed them to do their jobs fully and attentively, but without being overbearing and pushing us to depart quickly. The food was, quite frankly, much better than I'd anticipated.  My Jack Daniels burger was amazingly good.  I took a taste of the Jack sauce, and found it to be much sweeter than the stuff I make at home.  Theirs has JD (obviously), something sweet that tasted like either molasses or maple syrup, and something smoky, like smoked bacon.  Pour that stuff on the burger and you've got a winner. My wife tried an item off their new ""smaller portion"" menu, which is supposed to be offerings that aren't huge heaps of food piled high and overflowing on oversized plates, like what most American restaurants now serve.  Well, if hers was smaller, I'd hate to see what full-size is!  She still had plenty to save half of it for a take-home box for a full meal later in the week.   I also tried their new ""skinny dippers"" appetizer, which is marketed as a variation on the classic Friday's potato skins.  It's like steakhouse fries with a bowl of nacho cheese dip, with bacon bits, green onion, and diced tomato on top.  It was worth a try, but not worth trying again.  I wasn't DISpleased with it, but it wasn't as good as I'd hoped.  It may grow in popularity, but I'm gonna stick with good old-fashioned potato skins next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=260

As we came closer to finishing our meal we had to reiterate once again that it we had a birthday girl in our party. Yet still no song and another birthday kid from across the room was serenaded by the staff. Finally by the end of desert we once again had to tell the waiter about the birthday and we finally had our one man halfhearted birthday announcement/song.

Also, we asked for a new one because ours had pecans on it which we specifically said NO PECANS due to my friend being allergic and they bring out the same half eaten brownie without the pecans and just drizzled it with chocolate thinking we wouldn't notice, and we found about 3 or 4 pecans still in it. By far worst experience, I do not recommend ANYONE to go there, save yourself the money and time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=240

Ryan C.,"La Mesa, CA",8,2,3,1.0,3/23/2014,"Ok so here we go, I've had a good experience here the last two trips with my family. This time how ever I walked in the door was greeted promptly and taken to a table. My wife asked for a booth (easiest w/two kids) the hostess said o we only have one available and its dirty. She offered to clean it and she told us to wait at the current table that she had lead us too before (Not return to the front to wait). I figured she would return quick and whipe it down so we could sit. Instead she returned and walked right by us. After waiting for few minutes standing there I asked a waitress passing by about the table and told her about what the hostess said. She replyed with a snot attitude well shes the only  hostess at the moment and she has to seat other customers (no one at the front of the place?). She then told me and my wife well I guess I can help her clean it if you wait a min (sounding annoyed). We then decide to just bounce out. So basically I like the food here, but service towards a paying family of four is not worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=240
Josh L.,"Santee, CA",1,14,2,1.0,1/15/2015,"Food was OK I would say a little to ""well done"". First they took 25 minutes to take our drink I order a Stella and my wife got her and my daughter a sprite. My daughter loves sprite and she tells me it's nasty I'm like what same thing my wife tells me .....so then I asked our waiter and she seem bothered cause in told her the drinks were flat. Not only that happen food took forever to be done and this was on a Sunday thinking it was going to be busy but no playoffs are happening and stuff this place was completely dead bartender and the cooker I quess were going back and fourth sitting at tables eating on the clock while people were in line or waiting for drinks I asked for a second drink and the waiter tells me that he is busy bs I seen him across our table eating and goofing off and this is very unprofessional but they were also drinking like wtf are you serious manager was ok with it never again will I ever bring my family here I don't recommend this place at all just bad service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=240
victor g.,"San Diego, CA",79,43,70,3.0,2/11/2010,"The happy hour isn't bad 5 domestic beers for 10 bucks or 5 mix beers for 15 i think... But I'll stick with bud-light especially if I'm going out with the boys and we are just getting a bunch of brews. The mix drinks are good but i think in any place you go it has a lot to do with the bartender.  I'll go again since it's probably the closest place from where live now. The food is what ever nothing extraordinary but nothing to complain about. Except the wait, i treated my fam to diner there was 4 of us and 2 kids... The kids started asking where the food was after 15 minutes. I really don't think with the amount of people there (not that many) our order should of taken that long...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=240
Ady G.,"Chula Vista, San Diego, CA",0,27,8,1.0,8/31/2013,"The service was HORRIBLE!  But we should've got the hint when it was slow on a Friday night.  We requested a booth but ended up sitting at a table, after the hostess told us it would take 10 minutes to clean off the table.  Mind you, the people that were occupying the table just left as she was informing us that the busser or server would be very slow at cleaning the table.  So, that's why we went with a table.  Our server was Jessica and her service was super slow!  It took us about 20 minutes to even get our drink orders but a table that arrived after us, and were seated at the table that we had requested, had their drinks and appetizers out before us.  We ordered appetizers and it took a good 20 to 25 minutes to get those.  She then came back to the table after waiting for another 15 minutes after having our drink orders taken and she acted like we were the ones taking forever to order.  We were ready when we ordered our appetizers but I guess she wanted to pay more attention to her other tables.  All in all, I'll make sure that I go somewhere else on a Friday night that has better service, busy or slow!  And I think that the $7 tip we left her was more than generous for the WORST service I've ever received!  Someone should have trained her better!  We FINALLY left 2 hrs after we were seated!  I always think a good server should take around 45 minutes to an hour to serve each of their tables.  Jessica obviously didn't care!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=240
evangi p.,"Jamul, CA",147,8,,1.0,7/11/2009,"Hmmm. Let me see..Where ever do I start?  Just like Charda B.,           ""The only reason I do like this one is because it's only minutes away from home."" But, whenever my boyfriend, two teen sons, and I go, we're just as disappointed as the last time we went. We figured, we'll give them another chance.  But regardless of what time we go, it's the same ol' sad story.  The food's overpriced and not very good at all.  The last time I went, I ordered the salmon on a bed of rice pilaf w/ veggies.  Man, the rice was all dried up and looked like was not microwaved enough or something. The salmon was dry as a well and the steamed veggies (broccoli) were half cold and half warm.  Ugh...Disgusting!   The burgers weren't that good, and the fries were stale.  It just seemed like our food had been sitting on the counter for awhile before the waiter came to pick them up.  I just didn't understand why he couldn't have served the food to us as soon as the cook placed it on the counter.           Service sucked...Had to ask to get a refill on my water and my kids sodas.  The waiter wasn't very friendly at all..  I don't even know why we even bothered going there. Never again! That was going to be the very last time we go there. So not worth it!  It used to be just aaiiiight and tolerable but not anymore.  I will definitely drive a little farther to get better service and better food for the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=240
Jen G.,"San Diego, CA",2,25,2,1.0,1/7/2011,"If I hadn't had a gift card for TGIFriday's I probably would have gone to Peter Piper Pizza next door. Does Peter Piper have beer? Anyway I had a $50 gift card to Friday's. Upon entering and hearing the obnoxiously lame (and loud) top 40 music, I worried about whether or not I was going to be able to burn through the whole thing and have to come here again. When I took a look at the menu that worry was put to rest... prices were much higher than I expected for this type of chain. Many drink prices were also misleading or just missing.  My bf got a Dos Equis, just because it said in the menu they were specially priced, but it turned out we didn't get that special price because there are two different sizes of beers. I got a Long Island iced tea because it said it was the daily special, but it didn't say the actual price. My boyfriend ordered another Dos Equis (still thinking he was getting the deal). The Long Island was absolutely disgusting (tasted like dirty dishwater) with very little alcohol. So afterward I ordered a glass of Widmer (which turned out to be pretty close in price to his Dos Equis, haha). I ended up ordering a fish sandwich and fries and my boyfriend got a burger. Service was pretty slow, and food took quite a while. It was pretty busy in the bar area, but I think most people were only drinking. When we did get our food it was very disappointing. The patty in my fish sandwich was gross. It tasted like some sort of chicken/fish hybrid. The bottom of my bun was soggy... almost wet, like the plate they had put it on hadn't dried. My bf's burger was undercooked and pinkish. We ordered their strawberry shortcake dessert thinking there was no way we could've ordered $50 worth of food yet. When it arrived it was basically just two scoops of ice cream, one slice of pound cake, two strawberries, some strawberry syrup, and a little whipped cream. For $6! When we finally got our bill I couldn't believe we had actually gone like $1 and some change over. But at least I don't have to go back there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=240
Yasmin C.,"San Diego, CA",12,14,2,1.0,3/19/2011,"Wow, what a disappointmemt, growing up I went to Fridays all the time, especially when we went on vacation and it was the best. Now that Im 31 something terrible has happened to their food! Its not fresh, everytime I go, no matter what Fridays I go to its always the same: it seems that some parts of the dish are fresh and others, like fries and shrimp, have been taken from someone elses plate and transferred on to mine. Even the consistency is different throughout the plate and it creeps me out. I wish I could have those Fridays days again like I did as a child but I think Ive finally given up. Never again Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=240
Sasha P.,"La Mesa, CA",3,2,5,1.0,12/25/2011,"We always start the waiters at 20%, but tonight's service issued our waiter a 0% tip. Slow service, wrong order, and a waiter who can't even refill drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=240
Bettye L.,"San Diego, CA",24,122,202,1.0,9/25/2010,"By far the WORST TGI Friday's I have EVER been to. It was slow for a friday. They had us wait...even though there were tables in the back. Service was slow. The hostess sat us down, and told us what there specials were...but we couldn't understand her since she was talking as fast as the micromachine man. The hostess sat us in a booth, next to a particularly trashy family. This family let their kids throw their placemats on the floor, scream at the top of their lungs (enough where my friend and I got goosebumps) and bang the damn plates with the silverware. No discipline whatsoever, and the wait staff could careless. I would have atleast thought they would have told the family to put a muzzle on their children. Our waiter was on break and his replacement was...well...pretty damn interesting. I would highly suggest this TGI Friday drug test all of their employees...for real.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-el-cajon?start=240
