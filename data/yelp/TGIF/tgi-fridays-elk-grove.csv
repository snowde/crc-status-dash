Kurt C.,"Sacramento, CA",694,407,2176,3.0,4/2/2015,"These red-striped canopies hold a certain type of expectation with its likes (Applebee's, Chili's, IHOP, etc.) and one shouldn't hope for any better. Having been a server for a few of these restaurants I can tell you first hand that there's nothing more annoying than a self-entitled, ""know-it-all"" demanding a well-done to taste exactly like a tender juicy authentic Wagyu rib eye...please, someone help this guy... Sit down, drink your beer, and be content with that 2 to 3-star meal your eating. You're in a chain. Rate or pay attention to other things like your hardworking server who's ever smiling even though she's drowning in a sea of irrationality and impatience, not to mention her tuition. You're in a chain. Just relax ~ what the heck are you looking for?? Caviar and truffles?! You...are in a freakin' chain.  I wanted to try their 3 for $15 since I couldn't decide: - Ahi Tuna Crisps - blackened Ahi Tuna slices on tortilla chips with house-made guacamole, jalapeños, Sriracha sauce and Avocado vinaigrette, drizzled with cucumber wasabi ranch (three to an order) - Corned Beef & Swiss Sliders - two deli sliders on a pretzel roll with caramelized onions, Dijon mustard and mayonnaise - Thai Pork Tacos - soft corn tortillas with Thai marinated pulled pork, Sriracha aioli, ginger-lime slaw and hoisin sauce (three to an order) The tuna crisps were good. The pork tacos were great. The pretzel buns on those sliders were my favorite part of the whole meal. Our server, I didn't catch her name, was awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove
Ashley C.,"Sacramento, CA",393,783,4211,4.0,4/1/2015,"From my past experiences, I would've given 2 or 3 stars for TGI Friday's. But this review is just for our most recent visit, and it was surprisingly not bad! We went on a Sunday evening and it wasn't crowded. Service was quick unlike other times I've eaten here. The only downside of this visit - it took a good few minutes for a host to even come to the front to seat us. No apology for the wait at all.  I ordered the appetizer combo plate with boneless garlic Parmesan wings, potato skins, and pretzels. The wings were bland and I only ate one. The potato skins were hot and yummy as always. But the winner was definitely the pretzel! It was soft and warm, and who doesn't love pretzels?!  Friday's still wouldn't be my first choice for dinner but I was pleasantly surprised on our last visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove

""Unfortunately we're not participating in that promotion. That's for corporate stores... more in the Bay Area"" The fact that you are a franchise and not a corporate store should be invisible to the public. You are TGI Friday's, correct???

Raheem A.,"The Pocket-Greenhaven, Sacramento, CA",220,147,192,3.0,12/22/2014,"I haven't been to this Friday's since it closed back in 2009. Prior to the closure, I remember the drinks being amazing, but the food was pretty lackluster.  Fast forward to 2014...I'm impressed by the food and customer service! I ordered the Sizzling Chicken & Cheese (garlic marinated chicken breats over melted cheese, onions, peppers, and mashed potatoes). They weren't kidding about the ""sizzling factor!"" The skillet was so hot that I had to wait 10 minutes before my order was safe to eat. These may be a reason to complain for some, but I'm accustomed to receiving food that is lukewarm (no complaints here). The waitress did a great job of making sure that I didn't burn myself (damn Mc Donald's coffee lawsuit), keeping our glasses' full, and ensuring that we were both satisfied with our meals.  Similar to Applebees, I don't think that these kind of places are meant to blow your mind away. If you want some consistently delicious food, go to Firestone Public House. However, I'm easy, so I have no complaints about TGIF...Happy Holiday's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove
An C.,"Sacramento, CA",40,108,141,1.0,3/17/2015,"I wish I can give no stars!!! My husband and I wanted to get something light to eat...  So, he suggested TGIF. We went on 3/13/15.We both order a shaker. Double berry mojito shaker and a patron Cosmo Rita shaker. At the same time we order our kid his meal first to come out. Since, all of us were hungry from a far travel from work.  As our drink arrives, I look puzzled. In my mind I'm thinking, ""Didn't it come with a shaker?"" Since, it was my third time coming here I wasn't sure and didn't want to feel stupid if I was wrong.. So I took the drink menu and look at the description again. My husband said, ""Where was the shaker?"" I said it was suppose to come with a shaker. The husband called back our server and asked her where's our shaker. Her reply was ""Um, the bartender must run out of shaker, but, the glass is the same amount"" I look ay my husband face and right away I sense bullshit. There was a table behind us that was looking into the same shaker drink as ours. I overheard the same server  who took our order mentioned that it came with a shaker to the table behind us. The funny part was we order our drinks first. So, how is it they're out???I felt because we are Asian our server wouldn't give a shit anyways like we too stupid to know the difference.  FYI. It doesn't take a smart ass to figure out. When you order a shaker you get a lil bit more.  Ask we took a sip of our drink. We gave each other WTF is this shit face expression. Is this premium liquor been swap out with a non premium liquor? I did not taste one bit of patron. Excuse me, bartender WTF did you put in my drink??? Need a ""operation swill"" for this place. So, husband complain to me. Another server passed by and overheard us saying how horrible the drink was. She was kind to help and let our server know that we didn't like the drinks. We order another drink. Same thing. The BFM I could not taste a hint of patron nor the grand mariner. Husband frozen ultimate margarita was in a F-ING beer/soft drink glassware. (Picture was posted.) Where is the traditional margarita glass?!! You gotta be kidding me. I don't want to make a scene. It wouldn't matter if we order again. Shit wouldn't get better. Husband was so pissed already. Asked if we want to keep our original drinks. I sarcastically smile and said no. That is how bad it was. It was undrinkable. I order a 10oz sirloin steak with broccoli and steak fries. Cooked to medium because hubby doesn't like too cook. I like mines med-well. as, I got my steak it was a size of a 8oz.i  wish I have a scale to weigh it. Damn, our steak was burnt, dry, and it was def not med cooked. Hard to cut. Not worth for $19.50. Broccoli look like mother fucker dropped it on the floor stepped on it and put it back on the plate. I on purposely, flipped it over on the empty plate to show how black it is (not sure if its mold or dirt) our appetizer is a joke. Very tiny size. I wanted to them to cook another steak again but, didn't want to wait another 30 mins. We were starving already. I will never ever return not with my family or friends. Co worker treats I still would not step another foot in there. Food was very awful and so was the drink. Appetizer was OK. But, for the portion and price is not worth it at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove
Ameenah M.,"Sacramento, CA",414,210,1517,4.0,12/22/2013,"Came in tonight with my sister because it's one of the only places around that opens late. We waited a bit for someone to greet us, probably because it's late and we only had about an hour and 45 mins until they closed. We decided to sit at the bar because it's happy hour.  The waitress was nice, and super friendly. I ordered wings, the BBQ and garlic parmesan. I didn't like it. Keep in mind I love wings. And I usually dig both of these flavors but at TGIF I don't really like them. My sister ordered her usual jack Daniels steak which was good. But my favorite was the spinach dip. When you order these make sure to get bread sticks because the two together are bomb. Overall the food was ok. But since I eat here often enough I know what to get to satisfy my appetite. Although I still always order the wings when they usually disappoint me lol. Service was good though. My sister loves this place for some reason so we'll always come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove
James B.,"Sacramento, CA",8,150,276,1.0,9/24/2014,"We decided to try this Friday's because of the commercial that stated ""Endless Appetizers"".

Ordered a blue moon, buffalo wings, green beans fried and chicken strips. The food was good and the staff was friendly.  Lots of parking spaces available and plenty of seating area at the bar.

Kai R.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",620,495,966,2.0,8/14/2014,"We were greeted at the door, actually the door was held open for us to enter (I was carrying an infant carseat containing a small cow), and perhaps she saw me struggling.  Seating was quick, and a carseat hammock was brought over.  I had requested a bar area booth since there were like 2 people on that side of the restaurant, while we could hear a few loud-mouth tables over on the dining side.  Not sure that was a good call, given the accuracy of service we DIDN'T received from the bartenders.  I asked our server about the ribeye since there were two on the menu.  One had their famous Jack Daniel's Sauce on it (sounded gross... and wouldn't that ruin the flavor of the ribeye?!?), so I ordered the one WITHOUT that sauce.  We had already ordered the Sesame Jack Chicken, and at some point I was going to be Jack Daniel'ed out!!  Enough with the JD.  So of course, she brings me the ribeye smothered in frickin' JD sauce!  And, yes, it was GROSS!!  I rarely allow restaurants to remake / reheat / refire anything of mine for fear of immature, angry employees' tampering, but I decided I was hungry enough to chance it.  Plus, I wasn't ABOUT to pay for something I hadn't ordered.   The ""corrected"" ribeye (ordered medium-well since I'm nursing) looked great with a mound of herb butter on top... but that was short-lived... I cut into it and the thing was still ALIVE in there!  I was like, I already have a small cow in this carseat, hah, now take this ""moo moo"" mess back to the barn & put it out of its misery!!  My side dishes:  the cheddar mac n cheese was bland as ever, and the parmesan steak fries lacked any substantial amount of the main selling point... PARMESAN!!  Overall, one star experience + one star for the JD Chicken because it was yummy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove

Karli D.,"Elk Grove, CA",91,343,782,3.0,8/9/2014,"I have visited this TGIF location less than a handful of times before if closed and then reopened a few years later. I stopped by here on a Friday afternoon during happy hour and the service was rather slow. There was only one waitress for the entire bar section which had at least 8 tables and about 4-5 booths. She was friendly and apologized for the wait but she definitely needed some assistance with a full bar of people waiting to order. It took me 15 minutes to get my first round of drinks and even longer than that to get my check and pay. I didn't try any of the appetizers or other menu items as I was already slightly frustrated with my wait time. After one drink, I left and went somewhere else with faster service. Don't know if I'll be coming back here again but I do like the option of reverse happy hour on the weekends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove

No fuufuu drinks with cotton candy or rock candy! I swear, people I thought you wanted a cocktail! This place stays packed on Friday and Saturday nights.  The age group on the weekend nights does range from teens to 30's plus.  I guess I would say this is one of Laguna's watering holes.

I ordered their cheeseburger, YEK! First of all, I do NOT like my burgers served cold & I'm sure that's not just me. Secondly, the burger was bland ....totally flavorless! I finished only a fourth of the burger and gave up.  Service was horrible; they took forever to push out our food.  Yeah, this place was packed but that should be no excuse for me to wait 40 minutes for a damn cheeseburger. I kept having to wave down the waitress to refill our drinks also.  For dessert, I ordered their $4 Oreo cookie dessert. Hmph; should have stopped by Bel Air's on the way home and got me a box of 6 for the same price instead!  As you can tell, this was defnitely an ungrateful experience.

Christin T.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,3,1,1.0,12/31/2014,"I've only been here one time but decided to try this place again. My fiance and I came on New Years Eve 2014 so we were expecting a huge wait but we surprised to see that there was only one other couple waiting for a table. But with that being said we still ended up waiting 15 minutes to get seated. Once we were escorted to our table I was expecting it to be pack with no open tables available because why else would they make us wait 15 minutes? But nope! From what I could see there were at least 4 clean open tables that were not being used but yet there was a crowd gathering at the front waiting to be seated. So I don't know what was up with that. After waiting 15 minutes to be seated we waited another 10 mins for our server to come. She only came because the lady at the front saw us sitting there and asked us if our waitress has helped us yet and we said no. If it had not been for her I bet we would had to wait longer. Once our waitress took our order it took her another 15 minutes just to bring our water...mind you the restaurant isn't even crowded. And we waited another 15 minutes for our food. My fiance ended up picking from the menu that allowed you to get 3 items for 15 dollars. I believe he got the Thai taco, these macaroni that were inside these little meatballs and another item that I can't really explain or remember what they were called. Anyways 10 mins into eating our food my fiance started feeling itchy. He started breaking out in hives and when we got home it got much worst. We have no idea what caused his hives and not once in his 26 years of existence has he gotten hives from eating anything.  Anyways I think it's safe to say that we will NEVER come back. Bad service, poor quality food, and over priced menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove
Daniel R.,"Galt, CA",32,11,2,1.0,10/11/2014,"Went to TGIF in Elk Grove once when they reopened. Decided to go again today. Absolutely a mistake. Host took 5 minutes to even get to the front, with the phone constantly ringing. Took our waiter another 5 to even show up and get our drinks, who clearly got off her break as she smelled like fresh smoke and cigarettes. Took awhile longer for the drinks to show and they even came with a new waitress. Ordered an appetizer. Figured the trio platter wouldn't be bad (Wings, potatoe skins, and beer pretzels with cheese). Nope. It took a good twenty minutes for it to show and we contemplated just leaving. Eventually it showed up, but lukewarm at best. Also, didn't even show with the cheese to dip the pretzels in.  Food showed up about 2 minutes after that. I informed him about the appetizer and the cold food. The manager stared at me and asked, ""Well what do you want me to do with that (appetizer)?"" I want you to take that nasty excuse back. He ended up comping the appetizer, but nobody once apologized or tried to fix it. The main meal itself was alright and nothing to praise. Nobody should ever go there with good expectations.  The service was a dismally terrible experience, the appetizer was atrocious and the whole experience was a disgrace. Mind you, this was at 2pm on Saturday where every other booth was available and they were nowhere near busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove

My first takeout from them.  My wife and I had hectic work shifts yesterday, so we wanted a nice and quiet meal that we wouldn't have to prepare ourselves.  We tried calling TGIF for over an hour to place our order, before I decided to just go ahead and visit them to order the meal instead.  I showed up and the parking lot was COMPLETELY packed.  I waited for another 5 minutes, before I could get a parking space, while trying to beat others to it.  I know that's common for dinner hours, but it just added to the frustration of the situation.   I went up to the receptionist guy and asked if I could order take out. He told me the take out waiter will be with me in a minute, but then he directed his attention to another party.  Another couple minutes went by, until I asked about the order again.  He THEN went to find the waiter.  While he was on his search, i noticed the front phone was missing from the charger.  The receptionist came back with the waiter and I ordered.  The waiter left  and I asked the receptionist about the phone.  I told him, I tried calling for a long time and he said, ""oh yeah, the takeout dude has it.""  He told me it would be a 15 minute wait, so I waited outside.   10 minutes went by and a man walked in the restaurant, walked right up to the waiter, and processed the finalization of a takeout order.  When the customer walked out, I asked him how he ordered his food. He said he called but it took him 30 minutes to get through to anybody.   After sitting outside for 25 minutes, I gave up my wait and decided to see what had happened with my meals.  The receptionist then gathered the waiter who said ""Oh crap, your order!"" He brought me 2 bags of food and opened them up for me.  I noticed that not only did I have a side missing, but out of the 2 meals, both had a part of the main dish missing as well.  He apologized and ran to the back and got the rest of my food.  When we finalized my order with him, I asked him about the missing phone and his winning answer was ""Uh, I don't know who has it.

We were immediately seated which was nice but then it took 10-15 minutes to even be greeted by our waitress. The food was mediocre as is typically expected at any TGI's and the service was decent. The waitress was ok at checking in on us but of course every time we needed her she never nearby.  I've come to not expect much more when it comes to chains like TGI's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=20
S. Jeff S.,"Stockton, CA",39,43,17,1.0,2/24/2014,"I would not recommend this restaurant if you are in a hurry or if you are really hungry. You'll be late for your next appointment and you'll starve to death before your food arrives. Had I read some of these reviews prior to going, I would have been more adamant with my friends that we not go here. We went during that time between lunch and dinner, you know, when it's not very busy at all. Yet when we entered the restaurant there was no one to greet us, and no one acknowledged us for a good 5 minutes. When we finally were seated, they sat us in a fairly cramped boot, despite our telling them that we had a party of 6 coming and despite one of our party members being quite tall. There was a corner circular booth available, but we were still given one of the smaller booths. A few minutes after we were seated, a party of 4 came in and was seated in that much larger booth. Not cool. Our server was Aaron. He definitely sets the gold standard for bad restaurant worker. I don't know if he was just having a bad day, if it was is first day, or if he just didn't like someone in our party, but his service was embarrassing. He hardly ever came to ask us if we needed anything, needed refills, or if everything was good. The few times he did come to get us refills, it took a good 10+ minutes to get a glass of water and lemonade, twice. Another time, he took my glass of water, and returned (after 10+ minutes) with lemonade, which wouldn't be so bad, except I already had one.  One of party members arrived late, when our server came over, he didn't ask if she wanted order, we had to ask for a menu for her. He then didn't return to our table for literally 15+ minutes. By the time our friend got her food, we had all been done with our food for quite a while, however, the plates from our entrees and appetizer remained on the table. We had to ask our server to take them away. The only thing our server was quick in doing was taking our payment. By that time we were no longer being discrete in our talking of the bad service. I think he heard us because he took the drinks off of our tickets. The gesture was too little too late. I'd rather pay for the drinks and have gotten them in a timely manner, and have been attended to in a timely matter, than have gotten free drinks, but been mostly ignored during our time there. 3 of the 6 persons in our party were experiencing TGI Fridays for the first time, needless to say, they will not be eager to return anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=20

Illyanna M.,"Oakland, CA",966,362,708,1.0,8/22/2011,"0 stars is more like it. It's sad to me that there's a type of person in this world that purposely seeks out this type of establishment in which to spend their hard earned money. And although I know they're sitting there shoveling the food in without any intention of nourishing their souls, they are actually enjoying the one note, hyper-seasoned and uncreative ""food"" that is placed in front of them. What's even sadder, is that I live in a bubble where I forget people like this are still out there.  6 pot stickers for $9. We're not talking about handmade, freshly ground pork, carefully packed into a delicate wonton wrapper. We're talking about straight off the Sysco truck and into the deep fryer. I could get a fucking package of 21 of these babies at Trader Joe's for half that price! And those are better. My mom got the Petite (EMPHASIS ON THE WORD PETITE) Sirloin and half rack of ribs, fries (shockingly cold) and vegetable medley. I've learned in culinary school that when the word ""medley"" is involved anywhere on the menu, tread lightly. In this case, medley meant nothing more than $0.15 worth of summer squash, cooked until they become mash. The steak was thinner than parchment paper that's been ran through a pasta roller. Tougher than prehistoric rocks strewn at the bottom of Park La Brea. The ribs had a centimeter of meat on the bone. $18.49. The Petite Sirloin and Salmon, french fries and summer green beans. My steak was cold, my fries the temperature of the Merced River's snow run off through Yosemite in spring, my green beans had taken on that gangrene colour of a toe that needed amputation and were so tough that I couldn't even cut through them with a fork. I couldn't cut through tender and delicate little summer green beans with a fork, people! My salmon was acceptable. $18.49. I've gotten faster service and bigger portions at a two-star Michelin restaurant where small portions are the regular. Something positive, you say? Sure. Our server was the highlight of the night. He was attentive, kind and when my mom said she had cold fries...we never saw his body move, just the Superman-esque light surge that was left in the place where he stood and returned. Hot and crispy fries on the table. Shout-out to Keenan! For the love of subdivision-Ed Hardy-MMA-Jersey Shore-retail chain plaza-god! People, there's a reason why this place closed down almost every location they owned. Let this chain die. Just as all the banks should have been left to go bankrupt, just as the credit card companies shouldn't have been bailed out, let TGI Fridays and its almost identical relatives (Outback, Chili's, Bubba Gump, Chevy's) die. Die a slow, tortuous and painful death...in which I can watch.  That will be worth the $54 gift card I spent at this hell hole.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=20

I'm speaking specifically about the steak fries. I couldn't even handle eating it to be honest. But everything else on my plate was excellent. I always get steak. Again, pretty bad customer service. I had to ask for my drink like three different times. I am pretty sure I got the wrong drink on a refill as well.

When I got home, my steak is COMPLETELY burnt (black), the ribs were dryer than dry, the mash potato was sloppy all over the box and it only came with 4 steak fries! The ribs was cooked with their Tennessee BBQ sauce which I wasn't a fan of when I ordered the JD sauce. So I called and told the manager what happened, he asked me to bring it back to get a new one. I'm not the one to get free food because I just want my food done right but to drive 15 mins back in a v8, he wasn't willing to do anything about it.

Nancy N.,"Sacramento, CA",183,111,29,2.0,10/25/2013,"I've never had such horrible service. Every time I come here, it's never a pleasant experience, but last night was one of the worst! I've never had a problem with my drink here, like ever.. Usually it's just the servers who only come by like twice: First to take your order and second to give you the check. Last night my drinks and my waitress was the problem. I ordered two drinks a signature mojito and a midori sour, I don't know if I came on a wrong night or got the wrong bartender, but both drinks tasted like virgin drinks. I know I ordered alcoholic drinks especially since I did have to pull out my id to show. At first I thought it was just weak because I did get the $3 signature mojito. (I'm not much of a drinker, one drink usually gets me going) So I ordered another drink, the midori sour, I downed it and still nothing. I was shocked and a bit upset. I was planning on asking my waitress,  but she was no where to be found. Now that I think of it, she didn't even greet us or tell us her name! A few minutes later I spotted who I believe was the manager and asked him about my drink, I asked how much alcohol there usually is in both drinks and I believe he said a shot each drink. If I knew I would have stuck to the happy hour.. but Ruben (who I think is the manager) was being helpful and gave us a free drink for the inconvenience. After we got our free drink we put the bill out and again where is our waitress? I would understand if it was busy and she couldn't get to us, but this was at 11pm so there wasn't constant customers coming in and out. Honestly I wasn't even upset with our waitress at that time, I was only upset with the drinks which came from the bartender. So I tipped our waitress anyways. This is the main reason why I was sooo upset that I'm writing this review. Not only did I tip, our waitress snatched the bill and walked away without greeting us. Horrible horrible service. I wish I grabbed back my receipt and crossed the tip out or tipped in cash so I can take it back. Two stars because Ruben tried to help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=80

I've been to this place probably 10 times and every time I go I tip $100 bill. I tried to explain to the lady that it took 5 minutes to get someone on the phone but she really wasn't trying to help me out so I asked to speak to the manager. Once the manager got on the phone he said its after 11:00 and there's nothing he could do. At that time it was 11:03. It's safe to say I'd never eat there again because being just a minute past 11:00 I think they could of taken my order. BJ's food and service is much better so I just ordered there and was treated like they actually wanted my business.

I own a series of restaurants and I would never hire this guy in my place or to even interact what so ever  with customers. This was the final straw. A few months ago I brought my in laws here for dinner and they screwed up 2 out of 4 orders. My wife ordered a pasta with shrimp, and the pasta was still brittle and powder tasting. how do you mess up pasta? well the lady manager they had at that time apologized and took care of us unlike the buffoon Ruben they have now. We forgave so we came back second time. Again, the order was screwed up, the quality was horrible and service greatly lagged. w asked for the check 3 times. So finally we just left money, more than we should have and went home. The final straw. Went a few days ago with our buddy that just completed military service and they screwed up his order. Why cant this place just get it right?! He ordered a steak, all he got was this burnt little square which he literally ate in 2 bites he was so hungry. Our portions were terrible, we left hungry and disappointed. Then they never brought out the 3rd appetizer we ordered but they still charged the combo meal price for it. My friends asked to see the manager and you can just see the disgust in Rubens face that he had to come deal with us. He walked over slammed a menu on the table in there face and tell us exactly what we ordered. Why is he telling us something we already knew? We asked him to fix the bill, he refused and told us what we ordered again and just did not seem to get it. Finally we did not want to deal with him anymore, just paid and said we will never return because of the bad service serving size and quality. Again, he did not care at all, he just walked away in a huff. But before that actually had to balls to say to my buddy that they do not support military discounts after he asked. That is insulting and disgraceful on many accounts. Because of you Ruben not making any effort, we will never be back and you have just cost TGI Fridays loyals to take their business elsewhere. we would rather support mom & pop restaurant anyway.

M C.,"Sacramento, CA",51,155,4,1.0,12/21/2014,"I'm writing this review from Outback Steakhouse, which is right next door. I didn't intend on coming to Outback, seeing as I don't eat beef, but TGIF left me with no choice. We arrived at TGIF at 4:55pm on Sunday 12/21. When we arrived there was a party of 4 waiting ahead of us, but no hostess. We waited until a few minutes after 5pm and were seriously wondering if we should just seat ourselves. At one point, a waitress from the bar came face to face with us waiting, then turned around and went the other way... then the same thing happened from the dining room. Finally, a hostess arrived from the back and seated the party of 4. She came back and told us that it would be 10 minutes longer before she could seat us because they only had ONE server working the entire restaurant and we she was waiting for another server. We asked if we could go to the bar and order a glass of wine while we waited and she said we could as long as we closed out our bill after we left the bar. We proceeded to the bar where there were two bartenders working. We stood there waiting for either of them to acknowledge us for about 10 minutes!  One of the bartenders had his elbow on the bar and was chit-chatting with a customer (who we assumed he knew based on their conversation), and he was about 6 feet from us! After 10 minutes of NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT from either bartender, we'd had enough. The rest of  our party proceeded to the car while I waited to speak with a manager. After explaining our experience to the manager (and explained WHY we were leaving), the manager only offered excuses. The first excuse was that it was ""shift change"", which I explained was no excuse for waiting so long without a hostess... ""shift change"" means nothing to a customer. BE PREPARED. If you have to step in, then do it! Then he told me that there was only one bartender on staff. Then why were there TWO men in TGIF uniforms behind the bar, both of whom completely ignored us???? We literally walked out and went to Outback. Guess what??? We had an awesome dinner there... I usually skip Outback because they are known for steak, but the dinner and service were great and I learned that they had more on their menu than steak... thanks TGIF for turning me on to your neighbor and competitor!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=80

Joyce W.,"Sacramento, CA",139,253,111,4.0,3/22/2009,"I think it maybe because the economy is in such dumps that I'm seeing restaurant coupons everywhere! My hubby and I enjoy eating out for the convenience, the ambiance, and of course the food (usually better than I can make and we usually order more complicated dishes that we wouldn't make ourselves at home).  In any case, in last month's coupon booklet (Clipper Magazine, I think it was) that comes in the mail each month, I saw a TGI Friday coupon for buy one lunch entrée get one lunch entrée free. So I used that coupon with my hubs last month and we really enjoyed the food (and the price was right!). He ordered the half rack baby back ribs (with a side of fries and a few onion rings on top) and I (after being extremely indecisive) ordered a burger (loaded, but I don't remember the name). His entrée was so yummy and I totally monopolized on it and so he *had* to share with me (hehe...) while I ""shared"" my burger with him even though he didn't really want it. Haha...  The service was pretty good and the place was nicely decorated (this branch only). The server was really nice about me using the coupon (sometimes restaurant people give attitudes when I use coupons/gift certificates). We went back again a couple of weeks later and used another one of those BOGO Free lunch entrée (only lunch available) and this time I got smarter and ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs entrée so I can have my own (the burger I ordered last time was a disappointment at best) and wouldn't have to deprive my hubs of his food, haha... The server wasn't as nice this 2nd time but she was ok about the usage of the coupon (hey, if that's how they're getting people to come through the door, then they should be nice about it). The 1/2 rack of ribs is on their $9.99 or less menu (that's constantly advertised on TV) so the 2 of us only spent like $15 or so including tax and tips b/c basically we only paid for one 1/2 rack of ribs. I LOVE BOGO free coupons! haha... That's why my mom gave me her coupon and that's why we could go twice! Sweet! Just got the new coupon booklet last week in the mail and this time is even sweeter! There are TWO coupons for BOGO lunch and BOGO dinner! Plus, my mom just gave me her two coupons so the hubs and I will be frequenting TGIF a lot from now through April... haha... Hey, we want to eat out, but in this economy, it pays to eat out intelligently (aka on the cheap). Despite all the bad things some people have told me about TGIF, this particular location has been good to us so far. Both the food and service have been good enough for me to give them 4 stars.

Another recent visit I was told the kitchen was ""backed up, and not taking food orders."" Other nights I have had great service here. When its on, its on, and when its off its definitely off. Guess it depends on who is managing or something. The food here is really good for a TGI Friday's. I have been to other locations and this one is great. I wish it was more consistent because I would eat here all the time. Lastly, one last annoying fact BEWARE!! they don't participate in the advertised specials on TV.

I think the most disturbing part was when the food came out.  I was the first to get my plate and I turned around to our server and expressed that we had been waiting for 55 minutes and found it to be ridiculous.  She continued to rest plates in the table, and said ""of course you were waiting and wondering where your food was"" as if she were speaking to a child.  She never looked at me while saying this so I am not sure she realized that what she said was rude and condescending due to her tone.  I wanted to get out of there so bad that I forgot to put my number down for stripes, not like it matters because I will never be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=40

Yvonne N.,"Sacramento, CA",1409,649,1562,3.0,12/9/2012,"So this was my first time eating an actual meal at TGIF in Sacramento instead of the usual appetizers and drinks during happy hour.  My mom had purchased 2 Sacramento Perks deals, which is the only reason why we were there. Ordered the Jack Daniels Rib Eye and Shrimp Scampi for about $22 and the 2 for $14.99 combo with a classic wedge salad and Bruschetta Chicken Pasta.  The steak, cooked medium because my dad likes it cooked, came out pretty tasty.  They sort of cut through the steak to give it more texture, gave it the disguise of being good quality meat.  However, I would rather order my steak elsewhere.  The Jack Daniels sauce was alright for me but my dad wasn't a fan of its sweetness.  Our waitress forgot the mashed potatoes and when it came out, it was very plain.  The Shrimp Scampi, on the other hand, was amazing!  It was seasoned so well and the shrimp were plump.  I'm a big fan of both steak and shrimp (oh gosh, what am I not a big fan of?) and this entree as a whole was just A-OK. As for my wedge salad, I ordered it with thousand island instead of blue cheese so it was drizzled with thousand island but topped with crumbled blue cheese, which was perfect.  The bacon bits finished this salad off so well, I really enjoyed my salad.  The pasta, again, was just A-OK.  The chicken was tender and I enjoyed the charbroiled taste.  The angel hair pasta definitely went better than regular spaghetti pasta.  However, for $14, I'd also rather get my pasta elsewhere! If it isn't for our second Perks deal, I probably won't be back for anything other than happy hour.  TGIF isn't one of my favorite franchises.  However, I am looking forward to using the second deal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=40
Siobhan B.,"El Dorado Hills, CA",15,11,,1.0,8/3/2014,"Horrible service!!! A few years ago, when it re-opened, my husband and I went here since we used to go with friends all the time before it closed, because the food and service WAS good, but after it reopened it was awful. We sat down and placed our order, at least 25 minutes went by and no food, finally asked the waiter where it was and he went to ""check"". Well 10 minutes later he came back and told us there was a kitchen fire that delayed the food. We were sitting next to the kitchen, there was no commotion of a fire and everyone else in the restaurant was getting their food. Our waiter forgot to enter our order before he went on break. I asked to talk to the manager, which I never have done before. He was a complete jerk and talked very rude and even yelled at me. I asked if he was going to comp a portion of our meal and he told us he could not at all it was against policy. I have worked in the food industry and I am not dumb. He forced us to pay for our drinks and we refused the food that finally came an hour later right after the manager and I finished talking. Now fast forward to today when we went with our two kids, thought we would give it another try since it's been a few years. Service was awful, not to mention the prices skyrocketed! Took the waitress at least 15 minutes to come to the table. Then didn't see her again for 30 minutes, asked for refills and that didn't happen, had to ask again when we could get her attention 10 minutes later then never saw her again.

It was a Thursday night and my friends and I decided to head to TGI Friday's for late night happy hour. We got there around 9:30 pm and happy hour didn't start until 10 so we chilled at Walgreen's for a bit. When it was HH time, we rushed in and the place was nearly packed. There was one table available, but wasn't cleaned. The server told us she will get right to us and take care of our needs. 10 minutes in and no one helped us. 15 minutes in and no one helped us. 20 MINUTES in and no one helped us. We got pretty frustrated around this time. Then 30 minutes struck and we just didn't care anymore... The server finally came to clean up our table and took our order. She said, ""sorry, we're short on staff, so it's going to take a little longer"". Uhm.. Okay, we understand.  The food part. We ordered potato skins, spinach dip, and 2 orders of buffalo wings. We also ordered 4 beers. It took about a 30 minute wait for our food to come out. The food have no flavor and tastes like frozen crap. Nothing is good here!!! Last but not least, OUR DRINKS NEVER CAME! Drinks should come out before anything yes? Well, it didn't. Our drinks were never even made. We told our server and she said she will get right on it for us. 10 minutes later... Still no drinks made... Angry and frustrated, we just wanted to leave. We went up to her to tell her we don't want our drinks anymore and give us our bill. Turns out she overcharged us for a 3rd order of buffalo wings. WTF? We told her and she took it off our bill.  Overall, this place is horrible. I don't even know why it re-opened. This place needs some serious changes. They need a better trained staff and new management.

I asked to see a manager, who told me the same story that the waiter did.  She offered to comp the appetizer, which made me feel a little better.   By the time we got our entrees, it was around 7:15.  Well over an hour after we were seated.  This would have been much less of a problem, and would have saved them comping part of our meal, if they would have just told us in the beginning that they were running late.  I don't like being ignored.  And leaving a hungry person sitting for 45 minutes before seeing a stitch of food on their table is unforgivable. Even with the comped appetizer, the bill was still almost 28 dollars.  This place used to be awesome, but since the reopening, their prices are higher, their service is slower, and the quality is lacking.  Gift cards do not make up for an hour and a half, lackluster meal.

Their crazy good late night specials are gone, along with the good customer service. We were seated outside on the patio, without any menus or waters. After asking for the second time we finally got them. Our drink orders were all messed up, either didn't bring the right amount of brought out the wrong drinks. Some drink orders were forgotten... so most of us gave up and ordered drinks directly from the bar. (Most of the time that works out better so you can just pay upfront and it's not reflected on the bill at the end of the night) As our waitress saw that 3 or 4 of us were at the bar inside, she said that we might DINE AND DASH and she needed to hold onto a credit card for the remainder of the night. Isn't that insulting, rude, and appalling? I would usually be outraged and livid if any establishment requested that from me, it's lucky that I wasn't there during that event. And one last impact of the night, another server brought out some drinks and had no idea what she was serving us... so we nor her knew who's they were. Just screams awful and terrible. It's sad what our former-favorite go to place has become.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=60

They took 6$ off our meal(Our waiter took half off the cheapest plate). I can not believe it was 75$ even after the disscount.  We left...very unhappy.

Jaime F.,"Sacramento, CA",265,79,,1.0,10/19/2011,"When I think of chain restaurants I think of over-priced, mediocre bullshit doused in salt and catering to the nation's morbidly obese.   I came here with my brother on a Sunday after a long discussion on where to go to watch football or whatever sporting event was taking place.  He was paying AND driving which means me being picky about the choice would make me, you know, a bitch.  I agreed on TGI Friday's since I hadn't been there ever, it was close to his house and there aren't a whole lot of options in Elk Grove.   That was me trying to justify going to TGI Friday's. Since eating at some really shitty places lately I feel like I've just been too damn generous with my fucking Yelp stars.  This place sucks, and one whole star is about fucking right.  We sat at a table at the bar and waited too long for our server to come over.  I'm not usually one to talk shit about servers on Yelp and I would never say that this girl was rude- she was just... really.... dumb.  The look in her eyes was vapid, like the wheels turning behind them were slow and in need of some maintenance.  It's like when you look in the eyes of Airdale Terriers or dogs that chase their tails until they die.  When she finally got around to taking our drink order I ordered a Michelob Ultra (I wasn't paying so I wanted to go cheap and domestic) after which she replied, ""a what?"" ""A Michelob Ultra."" I say again.  ""Is that, like, a drink?"" She asks.   ""Um, yeah, Michelob Ultra, the beer?"" Still confused, she writes something down.  Then she goes back to the difficult task of walking and breathing all at the same time. The menu at TGI Friday's is your typical chain food American fare only slightly more expensive.  At least ten bucks for everything even wilted salads and over salted appetizers.  They also have about four other giant plastic menu flaps inside the original menu offering gross, over priced dinner specials and brightly colored photos of the greasy, less than mediocre crap.  I hate when menus are large and complicated.  I hate when they're seven pages with three add on flaps and a flip book in the center with more crap.   Restaurants are best when the menu is simple, small and GOOD. After about 15 minutes we get our beers and our server is still just in a haze of retardation.  We order the nachos and the wings and another beer as by this time our server understands what a Michelob Ultra is.  The nachos are gross, the wings are classic frozen and the ambiance is filled with middle aged women on lunch dates and a black couple for some ethnic flair.   I could have copy and pasted my review for Chili's in here but then I would of had to leave all the tid bits about our overly intelligent server.

Ok, I understand its graduation season and its friday night and people want happy hour. But almost a hour wait to be seated? Problem 1. While we had been waiting to be seated for about 45 mins, a couple comes in after us and are promptly seated.  We were told they were seated first because that table could not accomodate a high chair. Sure. Problem 2.  It took almost another hour for the food to come out. Problem 3.  The strawberry lemonades tasted like water. Problem 4.  When the food came out, me and my mother received our plates but my dad did not. Turns out the waiter did not put in his order.  We waited ANOTHER 30 mins for his plate.  By this time, my toddler is screaming and my dad is pissed off.  I ask to speak to the manager. Manager comes out and says my dads meal will be free and that she will not remove the other two meals off the bill.  Look lady, I don't know about you..but when I go out to dinner I expect good service and ALL of my meals to come out TOGETHER.  The meals weren't all that great to begin with.   Problem 5.  That same table they told us that couldn't accomodate a high chair..guess what? There's a couple eating at it with their baby in a high chair!!! We got there at 8pm and didnt't leave until almost 11.  That's an unecessary 3 hours..mind you I had my 16 month old.  I told the manager we weren't paying and walked the hell out.  I don't pay for terrible service, bad food, and to eat separate meals.  My dad ended up eating mcdonalds!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=100

We went for dinner based on specials on the TGIF website none of which are available at this location. Our drinks took at least 10+ minutes as the bartender was to busy talking with other employees. While waiting a woman with two children sat at the booth next to us ( we were in the bar) her wine glass filled by the chatty bartender was large and very full. Not what the normal customers get.  Finally our drinks appeared we ordered a appetizer and dinner the appetizer was the only item that tasted good.  My salad with pecan crusted chicken was awful the chicken was so over cooked I could hardly swallow it. My husband steak and ribs well the steak tasted like it was cooked in fish oil. The ribs were not the same as before with good bbq sauce the new sauce is horrible. His mac and cheese was noodle with bread crumbs but no cheese. I ordered desert and the cake was so dry it tasted like it had been stored frozen for 10 years. We did complain to the waitress who did give us great service ( she can't help what they give her to serve) and then we talked to the manager on duty. She was good and listened and explained on going problems. She did credit our bill for the awful meal. But we will never go back. After two meals a year apart and they only got worse well there will not be a third time. Finally back to the woman with two kids. She was obviously a employee or good friend of the bartender. She had at least two of the fullest wine glasses I have every seen (they were big glasses) and appetizers. Plus she never paid a bill.

I did not really want to go but hey, it is his birthday and I did not want to dissapoint him. We arrived there and were seated promptly. One of the waiters made a joke about it was going to be a 45 minute wait even though the place was fairly empty. It was a joke appreciated. The waitress we had was amazing. She answered all the questions and did not seem to be mind that we were not ready with our orders by the time we received our appetizers. They even sung those generic happy birthday songs so we could embarrass our 12 year old nephew. It was all caught on camera. :)  Now, the reason for 3 stars. The lack of vegetarian items on the menu. What the heck TGIF? I had to request bruschetta pasta without the chickens. It was actually pretty good. I am sorry to say that I will not go back (unless I have to) because I did not see a sandwich or burger without meat in it. What happened to their garden burgers?

Venessa M.,"Elk Grove, CA",26,8,3,1.0,3/25/2015,"My family and I dined at TGIF to celebrate my son's 10th 10th birthday. He was looking forward to the ""all you can eat"" appetizers, unfortunately this  ""franchise"" didn't offer the unlimited appetizers as advertised. The service was good but the food was a complete disappointment, mediocre at best. We ordered the 5 appetizers for $23, their tiny portions were not worth the price. The tuna crisps (3 pieces served on 1/2 of a tortilla chip) were over cooked and not seared as the menu stated. The boneless wings were covered in hot sauce probably to hide the fact they were dry and over salted. The only reprise were the Mac n' cheese balls. I have great memories of the French onion soup from the TGIF on Howe Ave, they served it in a mini cast iron pot and draped in cheese. Thinking if this I ordered a bowl, needless to say it was one of the worst French onion soups I've ever had. The serving listed as a bowl was actually the size of a cup. This version was extremely salty and tasted like it was made from a dry soup mix in fact it tasted as if it weren't mixed throughly.  I would have preferred a packet Lipton onion soup to this concoction. My daughter ordered the kids marinara on penne pasta, however what she got was marinara and water on angel hair pasta. Not sure if the know what penne is. It was so water logged that I ended up pouring out 1/2 cup of water from her bowl before she could eat it. Perhaps they should drain the pasta before they serve it. I would NOT recommend going to eat here, I will probably not bring my family here again. Sadly, my son also did not get a birthday song.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=100

I was so excited when I heard it was re-opening. Biggest dissapointment ever! I also stood at the bar with my boyfriend and best friend for 10 mins before we were even acknowledged by the bartender (btw there were 3 other couples at the bar, all of whom already had drinks). She told us all about the HH specials and we ordered. I have always come here for the Ultimate Long Islands and this one was the worst one I have ever had! It tasted like straight Gin....YUCK! We were also told that they were $2 off for HH (it used to be $4 Ultimate Long Islands back in the day) but we were already there so no biggie. We went and sat outside and were also approached by 3 different waiters....weird. Aren't they supposed to have table assignments? We ordered appetizers anyways (it used to be half off all appetizers during HH) and only when the food was brought to us were we told that only certain appetizers were half off for HH. We ordered the jack chicken strips, the flatbread thing, the green bean fries and the fajita nachos. Everything was COLD, and I mean cold....not lukewarm...except for the green bean fries which obviously had to be deep fried. On top of all of that when we got our bill none of the drinks were at HH prices. Our waiter told us that the Ultimate Long Island wasn't on HH and I told him that the bartender had told us otherwise. He went in to talk to her but she had left already....so he was able to give a discount: $0.86. I swear the bill had 86 cents off of our drinks that were all priced at $9. The whole evening was just ridiculous! With the experience that I had I will NEVER be returning!!!! If you used to go to Friday's before it closed.....it is nothing like it used to be!

First time, I came in a group of 5 and sat inside near the bar. Had a dude waiter that was bald with a goatee? He was awesome. Very nice, fast and attentive. We ordered a couple appetizers for the table, my friends ordered beers and I have a long island. Prices of the long island rose btw. It used to be $4 n now it's $6 :/ everything is pretty good and I wouldve gave this visit 4 stars. Second time, I came with a group of 10. We sat outside on the patio since they couldn't accommodate our huge party inside by the bar. Understandable. They ran out of my favorite appetizer, the green bean fries. Boo. So my friend and I decided to try their spinach dip. It came out with a decent sized bowl of dip but as for the chips. They were all clumped together. That was interesting, so we asked the waitress for new chips. Second batch was much better. My other friends ordered the buffalo wings which were decent. We got extra celery on the side of course! We also got the jack Daniels chicken strips. I remembered them tasting better before. The sauce was sweet n delicious but the pieces of chicken were quite tiny and dry. My girls and I each ordered a mangoberry daiquiri which was pretty delicious. The worse part of this night was waiting for refills on water and our check. We were so close to just walking out without paying. That's how long it took. And after she dropped off our check we didn't wanna wait ANOTHER 25 minutes for her to pick up our payment so we just handed it to the first waiter we saw and left. Minus a star. This is a pretty decent and cheap place to come for happy hour since there's not that many options in elk grove. I would suggest coming in small party and sitting inside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=160
Shelly S.,"Sacramento, CA",0,20,,2.0,5/28/2014,"The reason why I am giving only two stars is because of the wait time to get our orders placed by the waitress.   When we told the waitress we were ready, she said she would be right with us, but then didn't come back.  30 minutes later, we had finished deciding what we were going to order and saw her at a different table.  We tried to flag her down but she said she was helping some other customers and would come back later.  At that point, we decided that we weren't going to get anywhere with our orders, so we decided to leave and not waste anymore time there and go somewhere else with better customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=160
Good Eats S.,"Sacramento, CA",26,67,54,5.0,4/4/2009,"As with jj's review, we also used a BOGO coupon. Although the coupon said not valid on specials, we were told that the coupon was also good on the $9.99 specials. We ordered the Flat Iron Steak and Bruschetta Chicken Pasta. It was a nice size portion for the price and we added a Caesar Salad and Clam Chowder for an additional $1.99 each. At first we were brought out one wrong dinner plate, and after asking our server, she took it back and the correct dinner came within a couple of minutes, very timely. Both dinners were served fresh and hot. In this economy where we have seen some restaurants cut staff back, it was not the case here. The place was busy, as expected for a Saturday night, but we were seated immediately, our meals brought out timely, and the service was excellent. The only drawback was the parking lot that is shared with Outback Restaurant tends to fill up quickly. Something that was quite noticeable was that there were many people there to greet and serve you, beginning with someone there to open the door and greet you as you arrive, and thank you again as you exit. We commented at how many places have cut the greeting staff out, but not at this TGIF. On a last note, as you may have noticed on a prior review, one of my peeve's is when a restaurant tried to nickel and dime a customer, especially by charging you tax on the free meal (see review on Todo Un Poco). At TGIF, of course due to being a chain and must keep everything on the up and up, charges tax only on your actual purchase. Now with taxes going up another percent, and even more in the near future, those restaurants that work the system benefit even more, at our expense. Consider, you could now be paying 9-10% tax on a supposedly free meal, with that money going to the business owner NOT forwarded to the gov't, unless you believe that the mom & pop business are actually reporting your free meal as taxable sales to Uncle Sam. Enough of my soap box. TGIF, gets our recommendation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=160
Dal C.,"Elk Grove, CA",121,22,1,1.0,1/28/2012,"I came here twice within a month and both times I had bad service.  I came for NYE and they were understandably busy but the hosts seated us without any silverware at all.  Our food also took a long time to come out which didn't make me happy at all but not enough for me to wait for a manager. The second time I came here was this past Friday.  I came in had my name on the wait list, and was told it would be 45 minutes so I waited.  45 minutes went by and I still hadn't been called up.  I go to the host to see what was the hold up and they were unable to find my list, which obviously angered me.  3 other hosts came to the post who took about 15 min to find my name.  So it took 4 people just to find a name on the wait list which is ridiculous and magically 2 min later a table appeared for me to be seated at.  This time I was seated with 1 set of silverware for 2 people.  This time I brought it to the attention of the manager.  Other than that service was good, however I don't see me going back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=160
S U.,"Sacramento, CA",0,2,,2.0,7/13/2012,"RECOMMENDED FOR PARTIES 5 OR LESS, if you want food in a more timely manner. I went for a birthday dinner with 15+ attending and I DID like that they gave us an area separate from the rest of the diners. The waiter was super friendly and kept a smile on his face even though he may be dead tired. We came in at 6:30 and were still waiting for more people to show up. We had a good 6+ people in and the waiter helped bring in extra utensils, napkins, plates, condiments and some fruit [to snack on, i guess] on a side table just in case we need them later.  The seating arrangement for our group is 4-5 tables lined together to be one REALLY long table. I sat at one end of the long table and I can barely tell what goes on at the other end. After the waiter came back to take more orders on drinks, our end of the table asked if we can order our food too. We wanted Mel to order her food first since she IS pregnant and the FIRST order should be FIRST made. She also requested to bring hers when its done instead of making everyones and bringing it all out together. Everyone's orders were taken around 7:30. A good while later (Forgot to look at my clock), the waiter came back and said he finally got the order in.. Most of the guys have gotten bored of waiting and decided to go outside to have a smoke/breather/play some games. We had a full table to only 5 who didn't want to go outside. Some of us started joking that we could have drove somewhere else, ordered, ate, and return back before out food would be served. The first 2 plates came out, neither were for Mel. The people who were still outside were called in so we know who those belong to. Few more plates were served and mine came but still not Mel's. It seems that they also served the wrong number of shots and 3 drinks tasted like its watered down to the other end of the table. Mel's food finally came out and 2 plates were still missing. The people still waiting decide to just cancel the order. ----------------------------------- We came in at 6:30. Ordered around 7:30pm and didn't get our food until after 9. Refills were not offered and no plates were taken away until after we decided to move it to a side table. The food was not served in the order it was placed(The order that was on the receipt or when the waiter took our orders.) When we came in, we were hungry and craving for food. By the time the food came, no one at our table really felt like eating anymore. Some friends even left their drinks so they would enjoy it with their meals could not. Their drinks were not cold anymore or separated from liquid density. My boyfriend and friend's plate didn't come at one point and was canceled. One was yet served and we still have to take it when he didn't want it anymore. We checked the items on the receipt and it seems that they overcharged us on the alcohol. So happens that they didnt keep track of how much we had either. ----------------------------- On the side note. I went to the bathroom 3 times. I've seen a party of 6 close to the kitchen and they've waited half as long as we have. We also seen a couple of tables getting their orders before we have and we ordered before them. The burger I ordered was warm and not as good as I've remembered it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=160

She didnt bring us water until we had been sitting for about 15-20 minutes and then she only brought 2 waters for a party of 9.  Then we asked for water and straws no fewer than 5 times. When the water finally came out, there were no straws. We never got a water refill until it was time to pay the bill and by then, it was too late.

As we prepared to take our seats, we were informed that we needed to go inside to check in to get seating.  Yes, at this point I had a feeling the evening was about to take a plunge.  I mean it makes no sense to make your paying customers walk inside to the host to let them know you were going to be sitting outside!  It was a waste of time.  Already a bit annoyed by this, I decided to continue on the night and hope our service would improve.  Thankfully to two of their employees in particular, the night was salvaged and a rating of 5 stars was restored! Our server was Jermaine, this guy gave us superior customer service, he was cool, funny and very attentive to our needs.  This made me forget all about the poor experience I had just minutes ago.  He set the expectations for how long our drinks were going to take and also provided excellent suggestions for what to eat.  We decided to order a few mojitos and long islands, the drinks were strong and did its job by making the evening more enjoyable.  We ordered their boneless buffalo wings, spinach dip, pot stickers, nachos and potatoe skins.  All in all, everything was delicious, particularly the spinach dip.  As good as the food was, the service was what really made the night for us.  Que, who I believe is another host made us feel welcomed and we will definitely be returning soon.  A successful grand re-opening that has once again earned itself loyal customers.  Congrats and welcome back to Elk Grove!  Eat Up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=140

At one point, he asked us what was in the drink we were trying to order because he had just turned 21 and didn't know much about mixed drinks. I'm not sure if he was trying to make conversation, but it seems very unprofessional to admit that to a patron who had JUST ordered that drink.  Our bill wasn't too bad, but they messed up our split check and ended up charging one credit card over $70. They fixed it, but it took a few days to go through. How does that even happen!? I'm not one to hold grudges...so a week later, the same group plus a few additional people are back at TGI. Our large group sits outside on the patio, in between two heat lamps that aren't working -__- our server is really sweet and friendly, but once again, very unprofessional. We asked for menus over three times, and by the time she finally remembered, some people were so frustrated they just didn't order any food. The waitress did not know the happy hour menu very well, so we were forced to change our drink orders to accommodate....no big deal, right? Well, another waitress brought some drinks over and when we asked her what they were, she said she didn't know. Instead of offering to check, she just said ""they just told me to bring these to your table..."" **EYE ROLL** After that, a few of us took turns going inside to the bar and ordering drinks directly from the bartender in hopes of speeding up the process and lessening the confusion. Our original waitress then comes out and sees half the table at the bar, and insists that they hold one of our credit cards to make sure we did not dine and dash since we were sitting out on the patio. REALLY?! I am positive they did not ask any of the other tables to hold their credit cards.  UGHHHH. Usually I wouldn't mind such terrible service as long as the servers were nice and the food was good, but the foood was terrrrrible (and honestly, I would prefer professionalism over ""nice"" any day when it comes to customer service). The chicken appetizers were weirdly flavored, the green beans come in a much smaller serving now, the flatbread is flavorless and not crunchy at all, the pasta is soggy and overdone, etc etc etc. Also, the happy hour drinks are not as cheap as they were before! No bueno.  I recommend you take your business somewhere else...anywhere else!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=140

Different servers kept coming to our table with another table's orders and I saw that other tables experienced the same as well as food being sent back. The pecan crusted chicken on my salad was pretty gross. Without the chicken on it.. it's much better.

I had a great time bc Nina, our server, told us about the wednesday happy hour as well as the regular happy hour. We definitely took advantage of it and ordered a whole bunch of the happy hour drinks and appetizers since they were half off! I have to give Nina an awesome review bc she took care of us the moment we sat down til all of our friends got there, took care of them, and even after we were done we stayed for a few hours and she checked on us multiple times and brought us water. We definitely appreciated her guest service bc we used those waters after we drank those long islands. All around. Great company, great deal, great time. Great server.

They get three stars for being so close to my friend's place and because he loves it there.  Favorite inebriation spot for him and fun servers.

We'd googled TGIF and there were only 3 in the Sacramento area and the closest one to where we were at, at that time was the one in Elk Grove, off of Bruceville and Laguna. We went this past Thursday night 09/12/13.  The moment we walked in, there was no host at the front to greet us. There were waitresses and bartenders working while we stood there. On top of that, they all SAW us too, but not one bothered to greet us / acknowledge that we were there. We were standing there for probably a good 5-10 minutes, contemplating if we should swing next door to Outback Steakhouse instead.  Then we were finally seated next to a large crowd and a medium sized crowd of families.  It took forever for the waitress to greet us, give us our drinks and even our food.  The husband ordered a burger, which by the time it got to us, was already COLD, and his fries were incredibly salty.  I ordered a 6 oz steak with some crab meat sauce (wasn't worth it)-- the steak wasn't worth even $5 to be honest. And my sweet potato fries were cold and stiff.  Most horrible part was that the manager was the one that served us our food-- his customer service given to us was just as bad as the waitress as well. But to the 2 crowd of families, next to us--- they were extremely catering to them. Maybe because both parties were Caucasian. No joke.

I did manage to go back a second time (different location) because there was no wait. I don't remember much about the service the first round, but the second time it was mediocre. Our server barely came to check up on us. We ordered a ton of food, but none of it was to die for or anything. NEVER ORDER STEAK at chain restaurants like Fridays, BJs, etc. They will just disappoint you once you've had REAL steak from a REAL steakhouse. edit: 4/6/08 3 star knocked down to 2 stars as of yesterday. Many employees walked by and probably saw us standing there by the door waiting to be seated. But only the gentlemen in the formal uniform acknowledged us as he was busy. It took 10 minutes for anyone to even come over to finally seat us. One employee was just at the TOGO area chatting away. WOW. And when she came in, she totally ignored us and went to do something else.  Another employee said she would be right with us, and although she walked by many times serving others, she never returned to us. It took 20 damn minutes before a guy came up and asked if we were ready to order. HELLO! We've BEEN waiting! My friend could barely drink the virgin pina colada cause he said it was so nasty. He had a large portioned appetizer which was alright. And I don't know why I chose to order the petite sirloin when I clearly said not to order steak at places other than steakhouses. But I guess it looked good on the menu and I was looking for a small portion. Too many spices on it, and TOO DRY on the outside, although surprisingly the inside was somewhat juicy. Yet, I wasn't surprised that my ""medium"" turned out to be ""super medium well"". The food took quite a while to come as well. Basically, the food was mediocre as I remembered.

R K.,"Sacramento, CA",0,4,,1.0,10/8/2011,"Let me start off by saying I actually like Friday's and our server was good.  BUT heaven forbid you have any sort of issue and have to deal with one of the ""managers"" by the name of KJ. He was obviously very young and extremely inexperienced. He lacks any sort of customer service skills and people skills in general and it astonishes me that any corporation would trust such a person with any kind of authority to run a restaurant.  The long story:  My coworkers decided to arrange a dinner for all of us to hang outside of work and we chose Friday's. One of our coworkers found a deal with Sacramento News & Review Sweet Deals (very similar to groupon or living social deals) for a $20 gift certificate for $10. The terms and conditions were very vague so we called Friday's to confirm BEFORE we bothered to purchase it. The person on the phone was very rude, but confirmed that even if we were in a large group we could each (only about 4 out of 10 of us ended up having them) use that gift certificate since we were all paying separately.  When we were finally sat we asked the server if we could get separate checks and she kindly replied that since we were in a large group she was unable to do so. We understood & were happy to pay the gratuity, but explained about the gift certificate BEFORE we ordered all of our drinks, appetizers and food. She said that since we called ahead and were told we could use them it would be fine. So that was that and we had a great time over dinner......  And then this manager with a very bad attitude comes up behind us and says, ""Uh yes, someone had a question here."" We all looked around at each other and said no because the mattered had been settled and we never requested to see a manager. It was very plain to see that he did not know what he was doing and told us we could not use the certificates. He was all about saying no, no, no and refused to take any responsibility, he got another manager and he was all about no, no, no......in the end they did precisely what they claimed they could not do. After all that, they should of at least made it look like it was the slightest bit of hassle to compromise with us, instead it just made them look like lazy liars.  Not to mention, they claimed that they could guarantee that SN&R would refund us for the certificates (which is absolutely false).... hmmm wouldn't SN&R like to hear about that o.O",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=180
Alyssa B.,"Sacramento, CA",2,14,2,2.0,8/22/2012,i have always loved tgif....i went hear on my birthday with about 10 of my friends to enjoy drinks and great food. my bf ordered the diddy up which i believe is vodka and red bull and as the waitress was handing it out she asked who it belonged to. my bf said him and she replyed oh how did i know this one belonged to u....really....cuz he was blk the DIDDY up named after p diddy had to belong to him. that made me mad.....this we were one of the only parties in there and 3 of the waitresses were just standing around in the front chatting it up while the one bald guy was trying to serve us all....rude and unprofessional. he messed up on my order but that was okay becuz he gave me a free appetizer card for next time. the manager was so concerned with closing and leaving that he or she never even came out to check on us but when there was a item under charged he or she made sure to point that out. serve was OK food great but it took a HOUR to get to us that i didn't even want it any more....needless to say i will NOT be going there again....shame on u,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=180
Dave A.,"Elk Grove, CA",14,10,,4.0,8/25/2011,"Great place, really. Staff was nice and friendly. They were pretty attentive.

Thaovy P.,"San Jose, CA",469,46,23,2.0,6/17/2013,"Me and my coworkers had a long day at work, we was thankful to see that this place was opened. I was excited to finally try TGI Friday's and when we got there, we sat around wandering if there was a host or so or if it was self seating? Well it was 8 of us so we didn't wanna be rearranging tables or anything. So we waited politely till someone saw us. We was excited to see the host because at this point, We were all so tired to be driving anywhere else so late at night. Well when she came up to us, she unfortunately told us the dinning section was closed, but we could sit at the bar area so we can get happy hour. We finally agreed to sit at the bar area because we were told that they still served everything on the menu and best of all we also got happy hour deals. So the host said we can go seat ourself but I was curious on how we would seat 8 people by ourselves.. I didn't wanna rearrange their furniture and have them all pissy yaknow? But as a server myself i figured I can just give it a try. I Found a few tables that were already put together but unfortunately it still had the previous food plates on all the tables. Great, another wait for them to clear it. Finally like 10 mins later, we finally sat down. At this point half of the party was half asleep. Well we sat ourselves down, looked through the menu and saw that they had some pretty good options so we all cheered up a bit. Then our server came, no welcoming, no introduction or anything. Alright, whatever, it was late, so ill let that pass but keep in mind you won't get acknowledgment if you did a good job because we don't even know your name. So after she came back with our drinks, she was ready to take our orders, but then she broke the bad news to us. They only served appetizers and no longer had entrees. Like seriously? We haven't ate all day and after we was excited for all the delicious options you tell us we can only get appetizers?! Ight. Whatever, we're just hungry. Appetizers came out, no utensils, napkins, plates, nothing. It's okay, we'll just be barbaric and eat with fingers and wipe on our shirts. Well food came out slowly one by one. SURPRISINGLY THE FOOD WAS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD, or maybe we were just tired and super hungry. Either or will work. But the food and the alcoholic beverages were the only thing that was good. Didn't order a sprite but our waitress mistaken it and brought it out. Didn't wanna give her a hard time and just took it in even though I gave up soda. Well couldn't even drink the soda cuhs it was just carbonated and delouted. No hint of sprite what so ever. Couldn't take more than 2 sips. Well food came out and it was good so we were happy with that. No refills on drinks so we kinda just passed whatever each other had left to whoever was thirsty. I just figured since our server would get gratuity regardless she didn't pay us ANY ATTENTION. OVERALL: FOOD AND MIXED ALCHY DRINKS ARE A GO.  Everything and everyone else just needs to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=120

Zoey L.,"Captain Cook, HI",0,16,9,2.0,11/24/2013,Great place to grab a quick bite with appetizers and a drink.  Love their fried green beans and boneless buffalo wings. Sit by the bar. But if you are hoping for a relaxing & yummy family dinner...forget it.

Omar C.,"Sacramento, CA",9,5,1,1.0,11/13/2014,"I can't even believe my husband are still sitting here, but we are not the type to walk out on our tab! We walk in and waited in the lobby to be sat.... well thank god we went to the bar otherwise we would have probably still been waiting there. Sat at the bar top and we're greeted pretty quickly.... but the bartender was either really preoccupied or having a bad day because she did not want to help us. She said hi and walked away...finally ordered two drinks, mine was a mojito and when I got it it was NOT a good one. The leaves were so dingy and brown.... gross!!! I switched to a margarita ... she rolled her eyes when I showed her the mint... sorry your mint is old!!! Instead of making my drink she decided to wash dishes.... I guess I'll wait since it was my fault that you served me a drink with old mint :/ it's been 20 minutes since I ordered food so let's see how long this takes :/  plus side the game was on and the kings lost!

Denise W.,"Elk Grove, CA",184,28,1,2.0,9/13/2011,"Fridays USED to be the kick it spot and no matter what was ordered it was great. Now, not so much.  The food was not good. I ordered the cajun chicken and shrimp pasta it was gray in color and there was at least 1/4th of a cup of extra grease in my bowl, and there was abolutely no flavor.  The sweet potato fries that came with one of the meals were good when they werent burnt. I would not order the oreo dessert it is equivalent to an oreo ice dream sandwich,  On the upside,the burgers that were ordered were delicious, the brownie and cheesecake were absolutely delicious.   The only reason they get 2 stars is because my server and the refrigerated and microwaved desserts were on point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=120
Mo K.,"Walnut Creek, CA",3,36,10,3.0,8/31/2011,"Not sure if they're just understaffed or if their employees just need more training.  I'm all about the customer service experience and it really wasnt there.  Every 15min we had a new person come by and tell us that they were our hostess...I think we went through 5 of them before the end of the night.  Food was so-so, service was very slow, and some items were left off the order.   On a good note, they actually had food this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=120
Ej S.,"Elk Grove, CA",3,29,1,1.0,12/7/2012,"Sorry but...worst of the worst in town and I don't even have that high of standards. The staff is immature, food is mediocre, and service is slow. One of the three times I'd gone, i saw a hostess and a male employee make fun of customers as they walked right by. If I heard it, way too loud. The other two times I went: slow service, asked for water three times which they kept forgetting, and again, immature and a very douche bag bunch of excuses for staff.

Kris F.,"Elk Grove, CA",20,21,,1.0,10/16/2011,"I guess if they were going to be bad, I can give them credit for being REALLY bad across the board.  Service was bad, food was cold (when I reported it the waiter asked me if I was sure), entree was horrible, and even the dessert sucked. I started laughing after the entree cause the whole situation was comical at that point. I had asked for the manager after being ignored initially. I was told that HE was on his way. It took me asking 2 more times before a WOMAN came over. She said  it was the hostesses fault for not communicating, AND she said that it was a change of shift that caused some problems. REally? Change of shift at 6? Pretty sure we won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=120
Curtis W.,"Sacramento, CA",6,31,,4.0,1/14/2012,"I went to TGIF Friday's tonight starving and to say I left full is a understatement. I had the Kansas BBQ Burger and enjoy every bite.  It was cooked to perfection, the onion rings were a very nice touch and the BBQ on the side had me sold(Dipping French Fries into BBQ sauce.....YES PLEASE!) The only thing I didn't like was that everything on the menu was overpriced, I hardly saw anything that was priced under 10 bucks, so come with lots of money.  And I don't know if this was a first time thing, but it seemed like some of the TGI Friday staffer didn't get along, it was the guy always insulting/arguing with someone, when my party was leaving it was him, a female coworker, and some customer. Not good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=120

Jenelle G.,"Rancho Cordova, CA",31,10,1,3.0,7/15/2013,"So the babe saw the commercial and wouldn't shut up about going so I looked up the closest one, knowing that our local Friday's had been closed down, and came across this one, which had slightly better reviews than the one in Roseville. I read across some of the reviews, not seeing anything intriguing let alone special about this place, but we headed out anyways.  The hostess was seating a couple as we walked in so we had to wait a couple minuets before we were seated. The decor? I loved it personally! Don't really know how to describe it but I loved it.  Anyway we were seated, given menu's and told our waitress would be with us shortly. We had time to go over every part of the menu and strike up a pretty awesome conversation. She finally showed and took our drink order. I was a bit confused because we had out menu's closed, and pretty much on the edge of the table, (which I thought was the universal sign for, ""I'm ready to order""). Anyways moving on, drinks ordered, which wasn't from the bar by the way, I ordered a Cherry-Lime Crush(something like that), and the babe a sprite. Took about 10mins to come out, which at that point I THOUGHT she would be taking out dinner order, NOPE WRONG, she walked away. So we sat, and watched her walk past our table 4 times (yup I counted). She finally came and took our order, ""are you ready to order?"" I laughed a bit before placing my order. I ordered the Sedona Black Bean Burger, and the honey ordered the full rack of Jack Daniel's ribs.  SEDONA BLACK BEAN BURGER: 1 word AMAZING!! 1st I would like to say I don't have much to compare it to except for the Costco black bean burger (which are pretty awesome), so with that said, It beat Costco!!. But no really, it was pretty darn yummy! FULL RACK RIBS: I asked the babe how his food was and he said, and i quote ""It's alright, I have had better"". So there ya go, we know men don't lie when it comes to food!!!.. I was gunna leave a 2 dollar tip because that all I thought our waitress deserved but the honey tacked on another 3 dollars. I started to take it back but, didn't feel like the ""you are so hard on waitresses"" argument in the car.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=120
Tami Y.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,7,,1.0,1/5/2015,TV ad advertised $10 meal the restaurant  menu did not  mention this. When asked the waitress she brought another menu and said the price was $12 because California was more expensive. The menu stated $10.vwe ordered and when the bill came it charged us $12 even though the menu stated $10 we asked to speak with the manager. The young gal said  that they menu was wrong and that the price was $12  and if we were worried about the $2 she would remove it and stomped off. Later she rudely dropped off the adjusted bill with no comment. She clearly was upset. This is false advertising and clearly bad customer service. I dont understand why she was so upset and rude. Will not return to this restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-elk-grove?start=120
Evan E.,"Sacramento, CA",40,26,16,2.0,10/11/2014,"Food was lukewarm at best. Mozzarella sticks were the best item. Rice with chicken entree skewer entree had a weird taste; too much salt or something was wrong with it. A replacement rice was brought but tasted similarly funky. My Caesar salad had tomato pieces in it, which is atypical and made me suspect that it was a regular house salad, but the server said this is how they make their Caesar salad. Well, that wasn't how they made the Caesar salad at another TGI Friday's location last month.
