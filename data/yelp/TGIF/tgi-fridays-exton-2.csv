Tim T.,"Bar Harbor, ME",1,40,63,3.0,11/4/2016,"you know what you're getting when eating at TGIF.  the good: - service was friendly and accurate  - burgers cooked as ordered and the bun held up.   - fries were hot and crispy. - blackened chicken/baby shrimp over rice pilaf was tasty.  would order it again.  the bad: - the ""chicken"" wings are more like pigeon wings.  they tasted OK, but they are extremely small.  one was inedible as it looked gross.  - we ordered a combo appetizer and they brought out our dinner before we were 1/2 way done with the appetizer.  they were not busy, so they weren't hurting for space.  - one plate was sticky - menus were sticky",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-exton-2
Taylor W.,"Downingtown, PA",24,7,2,1.0,4/8/2017,"To be honest, I am disappointed and didn't have a good time.  The Good: Jack Daniel boneless wings  The Bad: 1.Soggy, damp, and ripped menu???? It felt gross to even touch. The texture of the menu felt like a perfect breeding ground for harboring bacterial colonies.  2. The Pot Stickers were SO well done they were actually a bit burnt....Mind you they should have the consistency of pasta. Soooo....Idk what the problem was here but definitely way over cooked. I took A BITE and put it back.  3. For my main platter I order the Sizzling Chicken and Shrimp. I know that it's a bit hard because they serve it on a sizzling hot skillet but honestly, I rather just have it served to me on a normal plate if my ENTIRE dinner, expect for the mash potato clumps are going to be BURNT to the bottom of my plate.  4. It came with two pieces of chicken. One had grill marks on it which is fine, it was cooked. But the other chicken looked like chef just gave up and said ""fuck it"" and microwaved the remainder of my chicken. (Side note: I wish he/she would of done this with my cheese and vegetables instead of cooking them into a crisp, just saying.)  This experience may of all been a bit tolerable if the customer service was at least good. But it wasn't. And I can't even call it medicore because in all reality, it was non existent. The only reason I tipped 15% - or at all rather - was because I felt bad for our waiter whom appeared to hate his job.   And one more thing up for question, I also work in the service industry and we are NOT allowed to wear fake nails because of PA's Health Codes. So why in the hell did the women who brought us our food wearing fake nails???!!!!  All and all, I paid $55 dollars for this..... There is really good food, okay food, bad food, and food where you aren't sure you're going to be okay. I don't know if I'm going to be okay. Not feeling that well and definitely will not be back.

Michele L.,"Lykens, PA",36,3,,1.0,6/8/2017,"Very disheartened! We stopped at TGI Fridays today to have lunch After picking up our son from school! It's not often that we have both our children together at the same time due to them being adults. Upon entering we were not even greeted or acknowledged! Several staff members looked at us, walked by us, but kept going about their business! The phone rang several times at one point my daughter timed it, itrang four minutes straight and nobody even had the sense to pick the phone up! We gave them a good 15-20 min of our time before we left! To eat somewhere else where we could at least be acknowledged and treated decently! Worst part was they weren't even busy just ignorant staff! Unfortunately I feel most TGI Fridays have bad management!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-exton-2
Paul S.,"Downingtown, PA",24,1,,1.0,4/8/2017,"As you read this review, keep in mind; I have been to this restaurant on 3 different occasions over 2 years ago and the food was actually decent.  From the moment I entered the door, I knew that this visit was going to be trouble.  As my girlfriend and I approached the hostess stand we were subject to severe stinkface syndrome.  Not one but two hostesses were sitting down and hardly looked presentable.      After we were seated, we opened the menus to find that hers was soaked and smelled somethin' fierce.  Before deciding on a drink, we debated whether the hostess on the left was high on cocaine.  So we were stoked about endless apps, which we found out about online.  Funny, how those sections of the menu were missing until we asked about them.  We ordered our drinks - my $7.06 tall blue moon and my girlfriends tropical raspberry tea which tasted like absolute butthole.  The endless app we started with was the Jack Daniels boneless wings - which were not bad.  The food runner who delivered these boneless wings decided that it an acceptable practice to flaunt her acrylic nails while nearly dropping the plate on our table.  I asked her for some small plates and she then disappeared for the remainder of our visit.     After studying the menu, we both decided on the Sizzling Chicken and Shrimp entree.  Once these main courses arrived, we looked at each other confused, as they looked nothing like the pictures on the menu.  The discussion that followed touched on interesting topics like how on each entree plate, there was one cross-hatched burnt chicken breast and a second that looked like it was microwaved and pale (note: we assumed that the cook wanted each of us to have at least 1 cooked chicken breast).  How did we know this?  One plate was scorched, the cheese and vegetables were stuck to the skillet and impossible to consume.  The master chef intentionally swapped some of the burnt food onto the plate with the more edible cheese and vegetables. In addition, he decided to use a random dollop of salsa on the shrimp.  Why they decided to drown our shrimp in salsa is a complete mystery.  Looking back on this experience, we found this part hilarious.       After our 1st endless app, we were bold enough to try the pot stickers.  These came out after we surrendered the remaining portions of our gut wrenching entrees.  The pot stickers were rock hard, and at this point my girlfriend was feeling physically sick to her stomach.  I talked up the pot stickers thinking they would be delicious.  When she tried one she discreetly spit it into a napkin and put it back on the plate.  I too was feeling hot and nauseous at this point.  We asked for the check which was 56 dollars and an additional 8 for a tip.  We left a good tip because the waiter seemed nice but appeared to hate his job.     This was by far the worst experience my girlfriend and I ever had eating at a restaurant.  Its approximately 3 hours since we decided to leave and we both feel ill.  The night is still young and we feel like vomiting.  I would highly recommend going to Longhorn Steakhouse, or the Pour House nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-exton-2
Dustin H.,"West Chester, PA",53,95,148,1.0,1/22/2016,"Salmonella! BEWARE! It's such a shame too, because I liked this place, but I can't let food poisoning slide. We visited nearly a week ago and I got Jack Daniel's Chicken and Shrimp. That I night I woke up with extreme abdominal cramps, fever, and other explosive symptoms too vivid to describe. Then entire next day I couldn't even get out of bed. For the rest of the week, the abdominal cramps, dehydration, fatigue, and other ""vivid"" symptoms continued. I'm still recovering. I probably would have given this place 3 or 4 stars if their food didn't try to murder me for a week from the inside out. Unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-exton-2

But The chicken was BURNT. I mean black on the bottom. The waiter agreed with me. ""Cool"" Cool? ""Want me to replace the chicken or the whole dish?"" I foolishly opted for just the chicken that of course arrived as I finished the pasta; leaving the sauce. I asked for some bread, which apparently didn't come with my meal. Ok charge me 99cents.

Laura S.,"Downingtown, PA",60,4,,1.0,5/6/2017,"I wouldn't give it a star if that's possible. I went for Cinco de Mayo after work with friends and we ordered drinks and some food. First, my friend ordered something with broccoli and instead was given mixed vegetables. When he asked why, the waitress said California is in a terrible drought. Welp, I happen to be from California and all winter, my parents were sending me videos of the record setting rainfall. (Yes, we send videos of rain, it's rare). I digress. The waitress was unpleasant and when it was time to pay, she missed $70 worth of drinks and instead of assuming the restaurant should eat the cost, she ran my card and handed me the bill after I'd paid my initial bill. Instead of telling us what happened because mistakes happen, she just took liberties with my money. She couldn't keep track of her table and tried to just put it on my card like it was no big deal. Her excuse was, ""I thought you were paying for everything."" We were a table of 9 people and she just put everything on my tab without even asking. We ended up having the manager argue with us instead of acknowledging he hires idiots who can't do simple math but they eventually refunded me and ate the cost. At one point, he rudely asked if I was drunk because god forbid I get upset that my several drinks and NO food over a couple hrs becomes a $130 bill. It was awful. I've never had anyone just run card without asking me EXCEPT A THIEF. Will never go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-exton-2
Bethany S.,"Reading, PA",0,6,1,1.0,11/6/2016,"The worst service ever award goes to our waitress here tonight.  Never checked on us, waited over an hour for food, didn't get the orders right, asked for sauce and she said okay and we sat there and watched her take orders for a table of 7 while we waited and our food was getting cold.  I had to go ask other servers for things all night.  To top it off we asked in the very beginning for 2 separate checks but they came as 1, I then has to hunt her down again.  Food was great however except the dessert was comical, it was a quarter of a smashed up brownie with 2 tiny scoops of ice cream for $7.

Molly M.,"Philadelphia, PA",27,10,4,2.0,7/26/2015,"This place would have been a one star but the service wasn't bad. Ordered a draft lager and it tasted stale, and almost soapy. What is up with that? Also, what's up with the ratios? I got the Tuscan spinach dip and it was a huge massive bowl of dip with like six chips. I didn't even need to ask for more chips cause then my entree came out and filled me up. What a waste of dip. I got steak which was great with fries and tomato and caprese salad (aka like 30 tomatoes with 3, I exaggerate not, 3 pieces of cheese) I would've gladly traded half of the spinach dip that I didn't eat for like 2 more pieces of cheese. Ratio, tgi Fridays, Ratio.  We sat at the bar which could only be described as awkward and quiet. I think what sucks the most was that me and my boyfriend went mainly because of commercials we'd seen (kudos, marketing team) about endless apps. Endless apps only make sense if you've got like 3+ people. So that was disappointing. Whatever. We quickly picked up the check when the food was done and went to red star to continue drinking somewhere less awkward with better food and beer.

Greg S.,"West Chester, PA",0,7,,1.0,11/11/2013,"We last went there on a Saturday night . We were about 3 miles away and it was about 6:30 p.m. We were worried it might be busy so we called ahead. I was told on the phone by the manager there was no wait time. So we came over right away. Guess what? There was a wait line and it wasn't short.  I would have accepted the bit of a wait If the manager had told me the truth, however he decided to lie. We decided to stick around and got seated and got over the whole business. Incidently, there were several empty tables in the dining room, which was really weird. We hadn't eaten there in awhile and had a good appetite, my wife and I were both anxious to try out the food. To make a long story short, the food was only average, my steak tasted okay, but was tough and the salad had hardly anything in it other than lettuce. My wife's Caesar salad was basically just lettuce and dressing with nothing else in there. Service wasn't very good, but it wasn't overly terrible . BTW, do you really have to tell the server that you want your salad before the meal?  Really?   To top it off I don't like paying $5 for a small glass of domestic beer.  Also, the  dessert selection was very limited.  Why not add some dessert samplers as many other restaurants do? We have been here before, but my experience shows this place has really gone downhill. We will not be coming back, it's a shame because this place was once very good, but not now.  The service staff just didn't seem very qualified for the jobs they were meant to do.

Morton F.,"New Castle, DE",83,922,3709,4.0,8/26/2010,"This TGI Friday's is in a strip mall on the northeast corner of the Swedesford Road and Pottstown Pike intersection. However, they have their own section of the parking lot so parking should not be a problem, usually. As always, if you are not going to the bar, I recommend asking for a table on the non-bar section of the restaurant because it is quieter. In this TGI Friday's, the acoustics actually seem good enough to completely eliminate any noise from the bar area. This time, I ordered the Sizzling Chicken and Cheese. Not too exciting but I thought it was okay. My perennial concern with TGI Friday's is their prices seem a bit high for their portion sizes, so I'd definitely sign up for their mailing list for coupon discounts. Finally, I had no issues with the service on this visit. The dining area and restroom looked clean enough.
