Scott M.,"Fort Washington, MD",4,93,4,1.0,7/15/2014,"I wouldn't typically write a review for an established chain like TGI Fridays, everyone who hasn't been living under a rock for the last 30 years should know what to expect.  But my family had the ""pleasure"" of dining here.  That ""pleasure"" stuck around for the next full day as we all went through the same upset stomach and general GI uncomfortableness.  My thoughts are the soup, as that was the only thing the three of us had the same.   Steer clear.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn?start=20
Heather M.,"Fairborn, OH",43,53,,5.0,5/10/2015,"Again being from Wyoming we do not have this place back home lol and i wasnt thinking it would be any different then lets say chili's or applebees. but heck this place was pretty darn good. been there twice. nice staff and over all a very nice place to eat. both times it wasnt really that busy i mean like at 5pm there was like a total of like 6 people there eating, so makes me wonder why its never busy lol but over all i liked it and so did my kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn?start=20
Sharonheights D.,"Menlo Park, CA",0,6,,4.0,9/19/2014,We were in the area and picked this restaurant because of one of ones we knew. Did not expect much and that's when you get the surprise. We got cajan  shrimp and checked and sizzling chicken spinach. It was great and the coffees was good too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn?start=20
David E.,"Xenia, OH",0,3,,5.0,1/20/2016,"My brother and his wife slowly became Friday's Regulars- going now 3 to 5 nights a weekfor the last several years.  They primarily eat and drink at the bar. I can see why! Now I feel as though I'm a regular there too. I go more now too because of the good food, specials on drinks and the caring, attentive and fun bartenders. It's become somewhat of a Cheers atmosphere at this Friday's-because of its great employees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn?start=20
Neko C.,"Washington, DC",139,312,216,4.0,4/13/2013,"This place is decent food and service at a good price. My husband and I come here when we're feeling lazy and we always order the same things. My husband gets the Jack Daniel's Burger with onion straws because he loves the Jack Daniel's sauce- that stuff is tasty! I get the boneless buffalo wings infero-style. They are some of my favorite wings- definitely need several cups of ranch to enjoy them haha.  Service is usually nice and friendly. Nothing extraordinary but no complaints either. The best part is the price, though- our bill is usually around $30-35, depending on if we splurge on an appetizer.  That's a pretty damn good deal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn?start=20
Darin M.,"Beavercreek, OH",1,36,,4.0,2/18/2013,"Good food and good service.  Food is a little pricy, which is why we don't go here very often.   The Jack Daniels items on the grill are excellent.   Had the JD chicken and shrimp with the tomato and mozzarella salad.  Most delicious.  The Korean soft tacos are very tasty too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn?start=20
John S.,"Herndon, VA",0,118,,4.0,9/6/2015,"Friday's is my go to place when I don't know where else to go. It never disappoints.  Good food and good beers, ok wine, and very chirpy wait staff.  It's just what  you want late on a Sunday, when you've been driving for 4 hours on the I-70 through torrential thunderstorms and dense high speed traffic that's like flying in formation on a B-17 raid over Germany without the flak or fighters.  We were tired, but had a nice quick dinner and a very friendly, positive waiter who made the evening very pleasant.   Can't say I'll be back to Dayton ever, but if I do return, we'll stop here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn?start=20
Russell S.,"Beavercreek, OH",52,112,18,2.0,4/30/2014,Good food but that's normal for Fridays. The service has been less than stellar. My wife and I have gone a few times and the food is always slow and even came out cold last time. I love tgi Fridays as a chain but with so many other good restaurants around ill pass on this one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn?start=20
Sharon L.,"Fairborn, OH",0,11,,4.0,10/18/2013,"My husband and I had dinner at Friday's tonight.  It had been quite awhile since we had been there.  We had excellent service.  The host was friendly and accommodating and our server, whose name was Brian, was terrific.  He was so attentive without being overbearing.  He was what you want a server to be.  I hope management appreciates good workers like Brian.  Our food was delicious.  Appetizers were hot and fresh.  I had heard their ribs were good but had never ordered them.  They were so good! I am anxious to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn?start=20
Derek G.,"Longmont, CO",5,59,1,4.0,7/19/2012,Decent food. Service was decent as well... Dont know when I'll be back this way again... But i wouldnt hesitate to stop by,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn?start=20
Yuki S.,"Seattle, WA",0,24,,3.0,8/31/2012,"Just like other Friday's, food is good at a reasonable price. Service is not as good as food. Overall, this is an average chain restaurant, does not worth a special trip here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn?start=20
Stephanie B.,"Dayton, OH",0,2,,5.0,8/5/2017,"Awesome Restaurant, especially when you sit at the bar....... Bartenders and the Service make the Restaurant a great place to eat and drink!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Chantily R.,"Dayton, OH",136,39,75,5.0,1/16/2017,"Sometimes you want to go ""where everybody knows your name"". Cheers! This is by far one of my favorite T.G.I Fridays to dine at. From the awesome staff to the tasty bar food, I always leave satisfied. They have daily drink and food specials and a pretty solid menu to satisfy various taste buds. Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Jason K.,"Dayton, OH",39,31,370,3.0,2/19/2017,"Let me start out by saying, I hadn't been to a TGI Friday's in over a decade. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it didn't start out well. As soon as we entered there were 4 groups of people waiting to be seated. I was told it would be 20 minutes to get a table, while there were clearly more than a dozen empty tables for 4 or more. The wait was every bit of 30 minutes, while the hostess slowly decided if it was OK to seat someone. Once we were seated, the visit took a turn for the better, with the great service provided by our waitress. She was very accommodating, and promptly ordered refills for the endless appetizers, which she informed us, we could switch up. The potstickers and BBQ chicken flatbread were definitely the highlight of the night. If not for the food and service from our waitress, this would have easily been a 1 star review. Definitely check out the endless app specials when they are available. They are a great deal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Matt J.,"Aledo, TX",11,56,31,2.0,3/20/2017,"Haven't been to TGIF in years, family wanted to go. 4 of us, waited at door for a while. No one around, finally got seated but restaurant was barely half full. Server had brought waters to us, but never asked if I wanted anything else to drink, never told us about the any specials, asked if we wanted any appetizer. Just our order and couldn't get away fast enough. Checked on us once, and never asked if we wanted any desert.  Poor service, won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Jen F.,"Miamisburg, OH",1,9,,1.0,4/8/2017,"We went there today and had horrible experience! We went there around 2. Got seated fast. The waitress took our order for drinks and disappeared! !5/20 minutes go by and our drinks finally came. When we told her were ready to order, she said she is super busy and will come back. Uh ya, that didn't sit well with us! I got up and went to the hostess and asked them for a manager. She asked me what for, I told her our waitress was not up to par and I wanted to speak to him. She rolled her eyes and got him. I kid you not, this older man comes to our table and slammed, yes, slammed his hands down on the table and said what is wrong! I told him and he had the nerve to say that he had two larger parties and was too busy and he would get our waitress! So TGIF's only important guests are large parties, not the guests sitting all around the restaurant! Trust me, don't go here. The food is so/so. Half of the food comes out cold and the crew doesn't think your important unless you are in a large party! I have filled out their survey with a bad review and also contacted corporate! Spend your money somewhere else!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Jamie C.,"Middletown, OH",25,12,49,2.0,1/30/2017,"Got us is in quick is the only thing I can say about this place but I can see why they were not busy, went there for dinner while out of town ordered the 3 appetizers cheese sticks, green beans, and potato skins when the waitress finally came back we ordered boneless BBQ wings, wings came out before the appetizers which is weird so 10 more minutes go by and I finally asked about our appetizer was informed it takes longer for what we ordered needless to say we won't be back. Get it together TGIF!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Josie J.,"Cincinnati, OH",43,55,8,3.0,12/13/2016,"Good wasn't bad. Waited a long time to be seated when there was no one in front of me. Service wasn't bad, waitress was kinda of rude, yet the food was good which balanced it out for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Jed M.,"D'Iberville, MS",131,442,2017,4.0,3/3/2015,"Wow! I was pretty impressed with the Sizzling Sirloin & Spinach. True to its name, it was served on a sizzling cast-iron plate much like fajitas would be. The waitress poured the sauce on the steak and spinach before handing it to me. The plate was beautiful. Plenty of fresh spinach was steaming before my eyes, complimented with sautéed mushrooms, red onions, and freshly sliced squash. The steak was about 6 oz and cooked perfectly to order, nice and thick and juicy! I haven't had a better steak from a chain restaurant in quite a while. There was also a side dish consisting of halved baby tomatoes and mozzarella cheese balls, which was pretty refreshing. I was getting full toward the end and the plate is advertised as being only 410 calories! The service was good too. Plenty refilling of the drinks and several inquiries of whether we'd like anything else. There was a party of about 12 of us too.  Overall, a very positive experience. The food was also very reasonably priced for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Lisa L.,"Loveland, OH",121,246,196,1.0,5/13/2016,"I can't believe my son talked me into this place. He wanted their boneless chicken chunks so he got the 3 choice appetizer he got their chunks, mozzarella sticks and their rancid potato skins. The cheese was totally processed had a nasty texture,why can't they melt cheddar like other places do? The Tennessee bbq Sauce he said was gross. My order YUCK steak with lobster and alfredo ( which they forgot) wanted my steak med. Came out super rare, added on shrimp not fried, wasn't good tasting and mashed taters yuck and their Mac and cheese dry and definitely nothing to brag about! Worst 40.00 not including tip I have spent. What a letdown but looking at the parking lot I told my son no one's here and that's not a good sign!!! Well now I know why!!!! Will not be back. Service was ok, even the dessert wasn't all that great!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Carrie A.,"Fairborn, OH",43,103,178,3.0,8/8/2015,"I've gone to this Friday's many times.  Service is always good and food is always cooked well.  My usual is the Jack Daniel's Chicken with sweet potato fries and hubby likes the Jack Daniels ribs or salmon.  I've taken my parents a few times too.   My only problem with Friday's is my dairy problem. Almost everything is made with dairy.  Even the Jack Daniel's sauce contains dairy.  While I can handle the chicken because it is only glazed in the Jack Daniel's sauce, I would never suggest someone with a dairy allergy go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Robert N.,"Fairborn, OH",0,56,3,3.0,4/21/2016,"We go to this Friday's alot,always get seated right away. The staff is always friendly and quick, orders are correct. The food is good, always hot and has good taste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Jess H.,"Dayton, OH",82,240,283,3.0,3/30/2014,"Friday's, as I've experienced everywhere... are pretty hit or miss.  This one is consistently good, with only one exception to the handful of times I've eaten here. My servers have always been friendly, though. I really appreciate this, when it's late... often times I have just clocked off work myself. I usually end up ordering a Jack Daniel's sirloin with the two accompanying sides. Last time I was here, I ordered it as medium, and received it well done. This time, I ordered it as medium and received a medium rare, with spots of rare. I don't care for the inconsistency, but unless I'm eating at Fleming's, this happens everywhere. The food gets the job done nearly every time, but what I really appreciate about this place is the friendly service. My last server was Cameron, and he was more than accomodating. This is very much appreciated on late nights. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Mama D.,"Dayton, OH",24,65,23,2.0,6/22/2015,Well I can't say that I was impressed. We waited almost 10 minutes before a hostess came to take us to our table. Then it was almost another 10 minutes before our server ever got to us. The food was pretty good although my hot food was cool and my cold food was warm which makes me assume that it sat in the window for a while before it made it to our table. Once we did get the food it was pretty good. As for atmosphere the restaurant was clean. The TV was turned up way too loud though. They had some music playing but you really couldn't hear it over the of noxious Lee loud soccer game that was playing. I really could care less about hearing about the bartender's upcoming trip where he plans to get drunk. All in all it was an okay experience probably won't go back to this particular location but I'm willing to give TGI Friday's a second chance at another location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Mike S.,"Burkburnett, TX",0,3,,1.0,7/15/2016,My meal went well for the most part.   This place does not appreciate a single diner. As soon as I finished with my meal the waitress brought my ticket out and said to take my time.   She then started to come by my table literally by the minute asking if the ticket was ready to be picked up. The restaurant was not busy! I approached the manager who acted like I was the bad guy.   I don't recommend for single diners!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
He S.,"Cleveland, OH",0,39,13,3.0,10/16/2016,"Went with a group of 6 on a Saturday evening.  Not that crowded.  Hostess said 30 minute wait, ended up only 23.  Server was good, hustled on everything.  No one complained about any of their food.  Overall an efficient meal.  Bartender also prompt and nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Tracie F.,"Redondo Beach, Los Angeles, CA",352,690,57,4.0,9/22/2012,"We had a darn good experience here. We went kinda late and the restaurant was pretty empty. I am pretty sure that the waiter was ready to go home but ya know what? He didn't show it at all. He was friendly and cheerful and seemed like he genuinely wanted to be there (or he genuinely wanted a good tip). Service was fast! We did have a mishap when it came to ordering the appetizer. I asked for no cilantro in the dip and when it was served it was chock full of the disgusting stuff. I did think it was slightly crappy that the waiter made a mistake and didn't offer us another appetizer in its place. No biggie though, my husband enjoyed it.  Prices were pretty awesome and the food was quite tasty. Not sure why this place gets such mediocre reviews. I thought it was pretty great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Amanda Y.,"Fairborn, OH",63,8,1,5.0,1/10/2016,Love the bartenders. They are always so friendly and are all around good people. The drinks are delicious and their endless appetizers are fantastic. Not to mention they have one of the best rewards programs around.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Bob D.,"Beavercreek, OH",1,16,4,5.0,7/23/2015,Great spot! Kristie is the best!  Great suggestions and conversation without being overbearing.  I would definitely recommend and the food is consistent. I always stop when I'm in town.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Mannie S.,"El Paso, TX",11,125,109,2.0,11/24/2013,"TGIF is normally our safe choice when we go to a new city and did not research ahead what to eat. This one tho, is way below average TGI Friday quality. The waiters/waitresses are nice but not very efficient. The food quality is the lowest among the TGIF I have been to in more then 4 states and 2 countries. The appetizer crisp is not crispy, and the appetizer taco shell is soggy. My rib was lukewarm and stale.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
Tom S.,"Dayton, OH",74,112,2,4.0,11/11/2014,"Well, it is that time of year again -- Veteran'sDay 2014.  Many vets take advantage of the meal freebies. Friday's offered a list of items for free to vets.. I had the SPICY CRAFT BEER-CHEESE BURGER with fries.  Woo! That was spicy. There were fresh jalapenos on it and they were not the wimpy kind. It was good! The waiter and hostess were very friendly and attentive.  The restaurant was super busy and the bar area was full.  Overall, it was worth the trip and would recommend.  Caio!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairborn
