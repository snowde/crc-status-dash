Thomas A.,"San Diego, CA",126,2,,5.0,9/21/2017,Fred was an awesome server! Great customer service! Just visiting here but one of the best TGIFs I've been to.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2
Cynthia V.,"VA, VA",336,23,19,3.0,7/23/2017,"Came here last night around 10pm. There was a huge party there already and we were sat right next to them. Would've been nice to sit somewhere else but then after a second huge party was seated right next to us. The space was kind of tight.. I mean yeah I get it's easier for the servers but it would've been nice having some space from the other parties.  It did take a couple of minutes for someone to greet us. Once our server came, she was nice but she seemed bored and uninterested. We ordered the endless apps for $10 per person, which is a pretty good deal. However this is my second time ordering this I wish they could switch up the appetizers on the endless apps menu because I'm already getting bored of what's on there. The food came in a timely manner. The food was pretty good. I think my favorite on the menu is the mozzarella sticks. Their marinara sauce is great. Their meatballs are also very good and. I like how it comes with little slices of bread to pair with. I wish we were checked up more often. She did check up on us and we wouldn't be ready to order but she wouldn't come until another 15 minutes when we needed maybe 5 more minutes. Pretty average service. Probably would go to another chain restaurant where the service is more attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2
Sean M.,"Leesburg, VA",32,1,,1.0,10/31/2017,For the older woman training the young lady tonight. She basically used me as an example on when to cut people off for drinking too much. Except I only had two drinks! She said there is a time limit for asking for a 3rd drink and I go out to eat at least once a week and Fridays has been my favorite choice. Havent gone to this location much but still! Thanks to the lady using me as a training example and making me feel embarrassed with the other person in my party! Going to keep going to Springfield Fridays just not this one! Always have a good experience there. Dont remember her name but she was the lady dressed in purple with a spider on her face!(For halloween),https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2

Iulia G.,"Fairfax, VA",180,260,2007,4.0,7/6/2016,"My review is for the bar service only.  I've been to this location several times, both on weekdays and weekends. Weekend evenings are usually pretty busy, but it's manageable (weekend crowd is somewhat obnoxious). Whether we were seating at the hightop tables in the bar area or the bar itself, we were acknowledged promptly with a smile and a menu.  The last 2 times I went there with a friend, our bartender was Brandee. She was nice and friendly, checked on us regularly. My friend had the Blue Hawaiian and I had the Peach Sagria and Double Berry Mojito. The Blue Hawaiian was alright, sangria was too sweet for my taste but the mojito was just on point. Very refreshing - perfect on a sticky summer night. I also had the Jack Daniels chicken breast with sweet potato fries and mac n cheese - and I'm not sure if it's because I was pretty hungry, but it hit the spot! The chicken breast was cooked well, but it wasn't hard and the sweet potato fries were pretty yummy. The mac n cheese was a solid 3.3 :) I can see myself going back, but to the bar only since you can order anything of the regular menu there. I would recommend management keep up with their hostess stand since nobody was to be seen there the whole time I was at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2
Dette T.,"Fairfax, VA",58,129,77,4.0,1/13/2017,"Francine, the bar tender/waiter was by herself servicing 8 tables spread apart. She was nice and attentive and we appreciated that she tried her best to attend to our needs although we also tried not to ask for too much. She's a hard worker and didn't lose the smile on her face!

I miss the old Friday's.   Lively but separate bar; good food; and friendly professional service.

The booth in which we were seated had had soda spilled on it that was not cleaned up on the bench seat I sat at, so we had to switch booths.

LanChi N.,"Fairfax, VA",224,396,1586,3.0,12/26/2014,Fridays... your typical chain restaurant... however its been awhile since I've visited...So long that my stripes rewards expired...So They have revamped their look removing the cheese and upscaling to a modern twist. How did they do... well lets see... I was on a date... we decided to sit at the bar near the TV's. I dono why but the curved seats just seemed awkward to me I mean it did help when watching the TV's but still its just strange.  Anyway...So I opened the menu trying to find the 1/2 off appetizers well  of course  my menu happened to be missing the appetizer page... and lucky for us we asked our waitress about it. She then had to bring me a new menu. Oh and she did mention some of their happy hour specials... however she could've just told us its also listed on their specials menu which also happened to have the beers discounted and the  selection of half off appetizers. Instead she waited until we placed our order  to tell us that unfortunately the ones we choice were not half off only one was. At that rate we just decided that we would order 1 more appetizer to match the 3 for $15 or whatever it was. Appetizers ordered...  the usual spinach  artichoke dip... salty like usual... but it does have the big chunks of artichoke.(oh this was half off lol).   The ahi tuna crisp... basically a fried corn tortilla with a small slice of tuna topped with guacamole... rather prefer it be a plantain chip but hey its Fridays... not a  5 star quality joint. Less then mediocre... Rueben sliders... probably would've tasted good if we didn't wait to eat it last.... however it as just meh... needed an extra side of mustard... and more corned beef. the steak skewers... were kinda chewy... the slaw was good tho. And the pita point was okay. Overall.... its a decent place with variety. Pricey without discounts  but if you go for happy hour its usually pretty worth it. Just remember to order the half price items... oh and if I went earlier for happy hour the fried items might have appealed to me. Friday's might have left the cheese out... but food quality is the same...medicore at best and just a place to eat and drink.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2

Elvis L.,"Stone Ridge, VA",63,241,192,4.0,9/15/2014,Came here with a party of 7. And I would have to say the service was nice! Loved the out server. Her name was Maddie I believe and she kept checking up on us every now and them which was great.  The food was ok. And the drinks we ordered was alright too. The only one thing you gotta worry about is. DONT GET TOO WASTED. Haha had trouble walking to the bathroom because it was too dark in the restaurant.  Not 5 stars because the food is alright.

M. L.,"Fairfax, VA",3,142,176,4.0,7/1/2016,"I ordered take-out from here for lunch with a few co-workers. I ordered the  MEDITERRANEAN MAHI MAHI NAAN 'WICHGrilled Mahi Mahi drizzled with balsamic glaze on naan bread with cucumber yogurt sauce,balsamic-glazed onions, garlic, basil & Roma tomato bruschetta and mixed greens with kale. Soooo good! Mahi Mahi was cooked perfectly. Not overcooked at all. Perfect amount of bread. There was some sort of garlic mayo sauce that was really good and added a nice little kick. Would definitely order this again and again. I ordered the fries on the side. Fries were ok, but then again it was take-out. Fries are better when eaten at the restaurant. I did have the option to substitute fries with a salad, which is probably what I will do next time.  I think the low ratings on Yelp is mostly due to service. I've eaten here a few times and each time I've enjoyed my meals. My experience ordering over the phone was good. The lady that helped me got our order correct.

The only alcoholic drink we ordered was 99% ice. It took two slurps from the straw to clear it. It was $8.50 I ordered a steak cooked medium and it came out rare and bloody (picture below).

Kayla B.,"Centreville, VA",544,37,30,1.0,7/1/2016,"Wow, never thought I would give a place 1-star...but hey here it goes!  I came here with my family yesterday night, so a Tuesday. First of all, it took them forever to acknowledge us when we walked through the door; there was no host/hostess to help us whatsoever and literally no one even tried to come up and seat us...there was a LINE behind us! But hey, waiters and waitresses completely ignored us.  When we finally got seated, our waiter (who I shall not name) took forever to take our orders. We had to repeat our orders SEVERAL times because for some odd reason he couldn't hear us. Our food came out, but it all came out quite slowly. He came out empty-handed and tells us ""I swear I just had your salad in my hand!"" and RUNS BACK IN TO GET MY SALAD...HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE MY ORDER IN YOUR HAND? When he wasn't bringing out our food, he was mingling in the kitchen...how about you use your time to clean the 4+ tables around us that are dirty as heck? He barely came to check up on our table...maybe once and that's it. If you're wondering about the food, it was awful. Everything was very dry and didn't taste fresh at all...I got the cobb salad with grilled chicken and it was so bland.  So, check time. We try to look for our waiter so that he can bring us our check...guess what, he's nowhere to be found! Obviously, the manager (I'm assuming) noticed that we were struggling so she walked over and gave us the check herself. We try to look for our waiter again to give the check to so that we can just pay and leave, but again he's nowhere to be found. I had to walk up to ANOTHER waiter and hand her the check and she seemed so frustrated at our waiter. She had that kind of voice that just seems like she's used to our waiter's working habit...she said ""Wow of course...WHERE'S _____?"" to the other waiters, yet none of them knew where he was! She apologized to me and told me that it's not right for me to have to do this and give my check to another waiter and got very mad at our waiter. He FINALLY came out as we were leaving and apologized because he had to take an ""important phone call"". Overall, it was a nightmare. Never going here ever again...would rather drive all the way down to Tyson's and eat at the TGIF there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2?start=20
Kathy W.,"Springfield, VA",6,14,,1.0,4/13/2016,"I've had two rather horrible experiences at this Friday's: The first time I tried to eat there, we waited 15 minutes in the front for someone to seat us. The hostess came over and talked to the people in front of us, without even acknowledging that we were standing behind them, left and did not return. There was a line behind us and while people were waiting, most left to dine elsewhere. There were plenty of tables available and more than enough wait staff standing around. The waiters nearby just stared at us and did not help. When we finally asked a passing waiter if they could assist with seating us, he said to wait for the hostess. We left and went to the California Tortilla behind it - that place wasn't great either, but at least they served us (and a few people who were in line behind us at the Fridays)! The second time, My friend and I were actually able to get seated in the bar area.  It was very busy, and I would normally take that into consideration, but they had a lot of people standing around and so I will not let that excuse the bad service.  The only times that my waiter came to the table was to take the drink order, bring the drinks and take our order, a diff waiter/food runner brought our food, and then the waiter brought the check about 10 minutes after my friend and I both finished our meals.  We did not get checked up on at all during our meal by anyone and did not even get an offer of a drink refill. I will not go back to this Friday's, but will not rule out going to different locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2?start=20

Melissa D.,"Fairfax, VA",153,223,175,1.0,7/24/2015,"Wow...what a change indeed. This experience has totally put us off of Friday's; my friend and I were lured in by a commercial and living so close we decided this was the only logical place to eat..mistake. Firstly, we sit at the bar which is fairly empty for 7pm on a Thursday, obviously the happy hour crew found somewhere better to be. We're greeted right away- not with a smile or anything just ""hi, my name is...what can I get you"" .. no explanation of the appetizer deal, no specials (does Friday's do specials?). I end up order just 2 beers and my friend orders the Jack chicken strips- smothered in sauce their not difficult to make good and that it not where the problem came in for us. I ordered a cup of dirt..yes, the children's dessert with chocolate pudding, gummy worms, and crumbled oreos on top- 15 minutes after ordering it and it still not arriving, our bartender comes over and says it'll be right out and I say actually since it's been a while we're ready for our checks; she huffs about it and storms back to the kitchen to tell them to cancel the dessert- maybe had she put it in when it was ordered I wouldn't have cancelled it.  Anyways, we get out bill- singular- even though we said checkS..not a blink of her asking if we'd like it separated, luckily my friend covered for me because I only had my card and we decided if we tried to ask for it to be split a certain way it would've turned out wrong. After we sign the check..guess what shows up?! My cup of dirt...20+ minutes after I ordered..the male bartender asked who ordered it and I said oh I ordered that 20 minutes ago and cancelled it 10 minutes ago..instead of saying ""oh no I'm sorry for the wait, here you go anyways"" or anything productive.. he passes it off to a buss boy and says ""this is dead now"" in the most condescending tone- see ya, jerk. Last but not least..THE ANTS. Everywhere, all over the bar; we hadn't noticed because the plate was covering them but once the chicken dish was gone they were crawling all over. GROSS. I would say I'm sorry I won't be returning because this used to be my favorite after work place to hang but I know sorry wouldn't get me anywhere with the rude staff.

Devon J.,"Fairfax, VA",0,31,,1.0,8/9/2015,"We had just a HORRIBLE experience with this location the other night! A group of 9 of us came in to hang out and use the endless appetizers promotion that they are doing. All of us ordered an appetizer so we could share all 9 of them at the tables. Everyone had either alcohol or another drink - so we were giving them a fair amount of money. This isn't like a group coming in and trying to split one. We had to ask repeatedly to get some plates and silverware, because only 2 people had silverware at the table. The servers were nonexistent and after bringing a new round of the appetizers just stopped answering us or coming to our table. We had people wanting to buy more drinks and just couldn't get service. It was horrible, and I would't recommend it. There are other great places in town to hang out socially.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2?start=20

We were surprised when he got up and asked if we would like to be seated. Really?? How unprofessional. As if the experience couldn't be any worse, we were seated with a waitress who loudly announced ""please not my section"". The host ignored her request and sat us in her section anyway.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way....  I want to take a bath in the Jack Daniel's Glaze.  I dipped practically every morsel of food into that glorious sauce.  Half rack of overly dry ribs?  Miracles happened when I dipped the dry little bites into that sauce.  Underwhelming french fries became little potato vehicles to shove more of that glaze into my face.  Nubby little excuses for chicken tenders?  Splash them through some sauce and they sing to me in chorus!

Sincere M.,"Falls Church, VA",85,75,131,1.0,11/30/2015,"After walking in on a semi empty bar, I proceed to have a seat, as two bartenders and the GM (haidar) which I find very hard to grasp of how she's even a manager, let alone the GM. As I'm waiting to be acknowledged, as it's quite difficult not to spot a new customer sitting down, I go on to be completely ignored by all 3. So, as I'm sitting down coming up with excuses of why they wouldn't even greet me (I mean, even IF they were busy, a smile, and an ""I'll be right with you"" would've been appreciated) I am a regular at Fridays, but this is my first time here, I usually go to the one in Tysons, and this is how I know what the GM's name is, as she used to work there, and she wasn't any good then, so I'm not surprised of the unpleasant encounter. I grab a menu, to waste time, and to ensure that they saw me (I practically know everything on the menu by heart) but nope, no recognition is ANY sort. After 15 minutes I ask to see a manager, she comes around with her Northface jacket, and a hoodie on her head (extremely unprofessional) and as I was mentioning to her of the situation (certainly not complaining) but merely letting her know that they need to step it up. Her response was nothing short of incompetent and what I had expected of her from the what I have heard (never believed any of them, because I've never had an issue at the Tysons location) with her uneducated and unprofessional response, I ask to see the GM, when she affirms her role as the GM with a smirk (it does not get worse than this) implying that she is the boss, and if I had any further complaints that I should let corporate know, she then cuts the conversation and says that I am out of time as she is scheduled to clock out, and if I needed to still have this addresses, that she will have her ""other"" manager listen to me. UNREAL! Being a person that is in retail, customer service, and had started off in the restaurant business; she has failed in EVERY aspect to meet my expectation as a consumer-as if I am worthless, even though customers are the ones that make or break a business, and now I fully understand why everyone gave such shitty reviews about this particular location. NO EMPLOYEE should ever disregard and belittle a customer in the matter I was treated, let alone a GENERAL MANAGER.

The first beer took 20 mins without seeing our server (Cody? I forget), idk he mustve been hiding. We had another friend join so they moved us to a larger table where no server was covering, long story short...drink orders took 15-20 minutes EACH!, our food was dropped my our wonderful server, so after almost an HOUR of waiting(for 3 freakin burgers), they had to refire up the kitchen to remake our order. What a painful dinner night. I'm not sure if ill order from the same server again.  PS: servers should apologize (not disappear again out of humiliation) if they cant hold 3 burger plates and esp!

I hadn't been to a TGIF in quite a few months so I was anxious to check out the new ""less cheese"" I heard advertised on the radio. Well the cheese is gone but the staff at this particular restaurant needs a lot more training. When we first walk-in there is no hostess waiting at the front as I use to remember and no one came while we looked back and forth unsure of how to proceed.  We gave a shrug and decided to just head for the bar, usually better service anyways.... or so I thought. Sat down at one of the bar booths and the waitress is dull and not engaging at all. She tells us the specials and we order drinks and then some food. The drinks were rather quick but the waitress disappeared.... we finished our drinks and she still hadn't checked up on us, so we kept kind of looking around the small bar and she was no where to be seen. Luckily there was another waitress working some of the other tables and she brought us some waters. When our waitress finally shows up again its with our food and its barely lukewarm! Disappointment all around cause I love the fries here! UGH! We could tell she had let it sit and we were an after thought. She then promptly disappeared again (all the while we are watching the other red-headed waitress bustling around the bar) and we have to practically run her down to ask for a check to leave.  All I can say is, that as of right now I can't believe we got such bad service...

Victoria L.,"Herndon, VA",491,536,912,1.0,11/5/2013,"2 words- SH*T HOLE. It's my fault for stepping foot back in here because my little sister wanted to come but I should have said no. Whoever the manager is, NEEDS to go to McDonalds cleaning the floors, they must not give a flying wooha about their employees. They must have did a blind test and said whoever counts to 3 can get the job. Employees do not get trained whatsoever and you can tell. Let me tell you what happened on this ungrateful Tuesday (11/5/13) at 4pm.  I called this location around 3:45 to ask what happy hour specials they had and the lady said, ""We have half off appetizers at the bar"". I thought great saving me some money. So my sister and I get here at 4pm and walk straight to the bar area. Our bartender acknowledged us because we definitely made eye contact and there were about 10 people there so its not like he couldn't see us. We didn't even see the hostess until 5 minutes later so if we wanted to sit in the dining rooms we would have waited. So we sit there and hes giving people drinks whatever and 5 minutes pass by. I'm thinking you can't even come to get our drinks? I see the hostess and ask, ""Are the half price apps  only in the bar area?"" She said no they apply to the whole restaurant. I told great because the bartender is taking a very long time.  She sits us down in the dining room and theres about 2 other tables in the whole place thats being served to. She said sorry for the wait and I asked which apps are excluded from the half off appetizers? She said, I'm not sure but they should be $3 each ask your waiter. I said sure. I thought finally some damn service. Nope, waiters walk by and we don't get service for another 3-4 minutes. Some tall caucasian guy who looks homeless because he started no shave november a couple months ago comes to our table. So I asked him what apps are excluded? He tells me that's not our special tonight its the Jack Daniel's specials, and ""oh...but the bar has half price apps"". I told him I just freakin moved from there and the host told me its half price everywhere. He tells me with a f*kin smirk on his face and a shrug ""I'm sorry?!?!?!...but let me get your drinks"" I said no I'm leaving. What a douche. I look at the host as I'm leaving and she says ""you want to sit at the bar now?"" No bitch I don't want anything to do with you. Who hired her?!?! At least carry a damn cheat sheet if you don't know your stuff. So you're telling me I just wasted 15 minutes of my life sitting with a menu in front of me?! Goodness gracious. They act like its a crowded restaurant. I hope they get no customers and are forced to shut down.  I really would love for new management to take over at this location. I mean you can't expect the best service here but at least pretend to like people. I can't even tell you how bad I hate this place. It's a great place for people to kill time and have a drink. But for food and service you can just forget about it. I give this place negative stars. Actually they don't even deserve stars, they deserve the scum under my shoes.

I arrived last night and sat down in the bar area, the whole time a man who clearly had been over served was free styling at the top of his lungs screaming profanity and vulgar sexual acts in detail that no one, especially a lady should hear. The bartender Mike who immediately gave off the attitude of not wanting to be there stopped by after 5-10 minutes to get my drink order. To try and lighten the mood I asked him ""hey what's the deal with that guy screaming made up songs about killing and raping people over there, is he drunk or something?"" Mikes response was with a condescending attitude ""I don't know, why don't you ask him yourself"" no idea where managment was during this whole ordeal. I was waiting for my girlfriend at the time and if she arrived and he hadn't stopped yelling about how he was gonna ""kill you in your kitchen?"" I was going to ask him to stop myself. Instead of the staff of the building keeping the peace it would have been left up to me I guess. I didn't know that apparently I work at a TGI Friday's... and Tuesday nights are trap house nights at Friday's. Luckily Flavor Flav's doppleganger settled down and stopped screaming by the time my old lady showed up. But luckily our meal came with a show when I was then treated to the sight of him making clearly unwanted advances on any girl within arms reach. My fingers were crossed that he would stop by my table so I could try and instigate a fight with this little drunk man.

However, our server Par was super friendly, on point, and incredibly patient with our group. We were celebrating a monumentous week, so you can imagine we wanted to drink. She did her best. I wish she would have gotten more help from the bar... A few of us didn't want to overwhelm her so we went to the bar and the bartender gave us a look, told us to ask our waitress for drinks, and continued to lean against the bar and do absolutely nothing. Meanwhile our server was hustling around.... I'd say the establishment lost a good 100$ at least in alcohol sales simply because we didn't want to stress her out anymore and drinks were taking too long.

We stand around for about 5 mins to be seated, no one comes to say hi but they just keep looking at us and passing. Uh...okay. Way to make me feel welcomed!

She brings us menus and we ask for a couple of minutes to think. We are ready to order...our waiter is standing by her little stand just braiding her hair and texting. We waive...no...she decided she was mentally checked out of her job. Finally, about 15 minutes later, she comes to get our order. Never visits us again until the food arrives 25 mins later (we ordered 1 appetizer and a beer). We wait another 20 minutes...our waitress is still just chilling. She clearly wasn't busy because she was literally just walking around, wiping some tables near us...but she is clearly in no rush. Meanwhile, the other waitress who had the same floor as her had visited her table at least 5 times. We waive to get our bill.  Overall, it took us an hr and a half to get an appetizer and a drink.

Edward C.,"Los Angeles, CA",110,62,122,4.0,8/31/2011,"I get that a lot of people rate their neighborhood/local iteration of a particular franchise as so much better than the other stores of a franchise, probably because they are used to the servers, layout, etc... Rest assured that's not the case. Over the past 8 or 9-odd number of years, I've sporadically visited this T.G.I Friday's location. I never gave it much thought. It's a T.G.I. Fridays, and it's got the T.G.I. menu, the standard T.G.I specials, decor, food, and servers. And really, I never thought I'd be sitting at a computer writing a review for a T.G.I. Fridays, either. But when I went for a quick dinner tonight, it occurred to me: of all these visits to T.G.I. Fridays over the years, I have never left dissatisfied. And, especially for a chain restaurant, that says a lot! In fact, there are many things I like about the chain--the food is consistent, the service is always friendly (kudos to Michelle in the VIP section!), the specials last well past the hours where other places start charging full price, they have many specials on food and drink, and the menu is diverse and ever-changing. A few menu items even stick out in my mind: I really like their green bean fries as an appetizer, and their Jack Daniels sauce is good on just about anything--from burgers to ribs. The burgers are solid, desserts are tasty, and bartenders are always happy to pour you a drink. Oh, and don't forget their home-made potato chips: tasty! So, how is it overall? Let's be realistic: it's a national chain ""neighborhood"" restaurant. Having said that, I think it personally kicks the behind of Applebees, Chilis, or any other competitor, by offering a big changing menu, perks for ""VIP"" members, great specials, good food, great service, and a fun, clean atmosphere. I totally have no problem grabbing a meal here, and as I make my rounds through my usual list of places to grab a quick weeknight dinner or drink, T.G.I is always in consideration. Do I feel this way because I live close to this location specifically? Nope, of the few times I've been to the Tysons location, I actually think the food there is slightly better made. But is the Fairfax location ""worse"" by any means? Not at all.

After that, she gave us two other checkbooks back, but they were not ours, they belonged to the party next to us and we gave them their checkbooks and they were also aggravated that their credit cards were handed over to strangers. After that, we were waiting to get our checkbooks and waited approximately 20 minutes, and when Juliet came back she did not apologize, she in fact assumed that since we were the same race as the party next to us that we were all together.

Dave was our server and even though my friends are a pain in the butt sometimes, Dave was always nice and efficient. the food came out hot and it tasted very yummy. everything came out perfect as my friends and i celebrated our pre-thanksgiving get together (i know, not the best place to have a thanksgiving dinner, but we are not so picky). TIPS: if u want the specials sit at the bar. they are all good. try the mango lemonade shaker for a refreshing fruity drink. the wings are sometimes good and sometimes not so good.

Christa H.,"Falls Church, VA",48,21,3,2.0,9/29/2012,Over priced food and watered down drinks.  But it's TGI Friday's.  What were you expecting?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2?start=100
U.S. A.,"Herndon, VA",160,305,18,3.0,12/8/2013,"They've cleaned this place up and renovated.  Probably more of a 3.5 star joint, but I can't give it 4.   The food is pretty consistent and good to eat with caveats.  I get the cajun chicken pasta, but only having them go light on the sauce.  Regularly the sauce is waaay to overwhelming and gross.  Soft pretzels are good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2?start=100
Brittany M.,"Woodbridge, VA",2,2,,4.0,10/17/2013,My husband and I rarely get out since we have a baby so we were excited to embrace the rare opportunity to go out and enjoy an evening alone. We decided to go to TGI Fridays and catch the Dallas/Redskins game on a Sunday and grab a couple drinks. Everyone was accommodating and food was great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2?start=100
Carter K.,"Ashburn, VA",6,26,2,3.0,3/29/2011,"Food is phenomenal, desserts are top notch.  Get the rewards card and you'll receive coupons for half priced entrees or free appetizers. Extremely nice wait staff, but terrible hostess.  Go at least once a week and never greeted with a smile.  But their probably just paid hourly and just want to get the heck out of there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2?start=100
Velma E.,"Emery, SD",0,5,,1.0,6/4/2013,We love TGIF across America but this one was awful.  Waitress got in fight with another waiter to take our table then didn't bring the food out.  Waited an hour and called for manager to help us.  They compt the meal but it wasn't edible.  Never again to this one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2?start=100

Charlotte L.,"Aldie, VA",1,99,36,4.0,4/23/2014,The food is great. I ordered a salad and some tacos and they were delicious. And not to mention the salad is huge compared to most other places. It will definitely fill you up. Furthermore the server was awesome. She refilled our drinks plenty of times and alway stopped by to ask if we needed anything. I came here on my birthday and they even treated me with dessert. t's the perfect place to dine with family or friends.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2?start=100
sodia g.,"Herndon, VA",60,33,1,3.0,8/27/2011,"I like the dessert there but the food just okay not great the restaurant look  very dark the food price is reasonable but the drink a liltte bit pricy for the cocktail so total everything is OK for me , will return some time if i want a good dessert .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2?start=100
John P.,"Fairfax, VA",6,29,,3.0,3/24/2010,"I miss the old bartending crew from my immediate post college years...now they have a new crew that is so so, but they do not really detract from the Fridays experience.   Food is always iffy at any Fridays, and this one is no exception.  Do not come to this place expecting to cut calories.  Some advice, stick to the more popular apps and anything that has Jack Daniels in the name.   Great place to drink with friends, def gets crowded though.  Desserts are awesome as well. See you next friday, fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2?start=100
Miguel C.,"Fairfax, VA",20,63,5,4.0,5/2/2009,"Happy hour on Saturday night?  Are you kidding me?  This is the promised land. I was there last night and my waitress asked if we wanted to take advantage of the happy hour specials.  Appetizers were half off, drinks were dirt cheap, and they had some 5 dollar sandwich/salad special....  Rolling Subway style ! I went with the Chipotle Steak Sandwich and I have to say that it was good. This friday's has always been one of my favorites and service has always been friendly.  There is plenty of parking and it's in the middle of everything in Fairfax.  The bar area is the best place to hang out with friends.......  gotta love my Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2?start=100

R B.,"Fairfax, VA",26,51,2,3.0,11/22/2011,"My husband and I have gone to Friday's and we really like the food and food options. We avoid going there as regulars due to slow service and too much shtick. We just want good food, fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2?start=100
Ron U.,"Falls Church, VA",44,125,10,4.0,3/6/2011,"My issue with TGI Friday's in general is that almost any of them I've been to, I can never get good service.  This one broke the streak, as my friend and I were helped fairly quickly and the girls in the bar area took pretty good care of us for the evening we were there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fairfax-2?start=100
Jay D.,"Phoenix, AZ",33,165,18,3.0,1/4/2012,"I have been visiting this place sporadically for years.....at some point I thought the service at this place sucked.
