Samantha K.,"East Northport, NY",366,95,184,4.0,7/30/2017,"Went here with my family to celebrate birthdays- we're a 13-17 person group these days with kids, picky eaters, etc. My dad made reservations 24 hours before for 7pm and we all arrived at that time. We didn't end up getting to our table until 7:45, due to another large group that got there at 5pm that didn't want to leave. Whatever, I'm with my fam, so we're ok. As we got seated and took a glance at their drink/food menus, then manager brought over 4 chips and salsa platters on the house. Pretty sweet gesture for making us wait. I ordered the avocado black bean burger for my meal, which was super salty but still good. The bun was delicious, but I ended up throwing it to the side of my plate because it started to get mushy from the avocado/spicy mayo/black bean burger mess. Got a side of fries, which were warm and delicious. We got the Oreo madness dessert, which was so messy! Cookie crumbles went everywhere on the table as we were trying to cut the Oreo sandwich. The madness! Overall, the place was clean- they redid this place a few years ago and the place is now constantly packed. I knocked one star off for service. Our waitress was super sweet, but we ended up being there until almost 10pm, and we sat for 20 minutes waiting for the check after dessert. It was so crowded though, and there were people waiting to get into the restaurant when we were leaving!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville
Angelo P.,"Patchogue, NY",45,17,6,2.0,11/25/2017,I went there against my better judgement and regret the visit. My wife wanted to go so I appeased her. The appetizers were fair at best! I ordered a beer and that was warm. The bartender did offer to put some on ice for me and he was very accommodating.  The best was that an employee that just finished her shift sat next to me and was telling her friends how bad the tap beer was there. I'm not one to make a stink so we finished up and left. I will never visit this place again. I would go to Applebee's if I was in the mood for apps before going to a Friday's establishment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville

Kendra H.,"Bellport, NY",101,219,499,2.0,7/17/2017,"Mediocre food. Suggested to my boyfriend that we come here because we always frequent the same chain restaurants. I have never been a huge fan of Fridays in the past so mistake on my part. I ordered a turkey burger with fries and so did my boyfriend. The turkey burger was juicy, seasoned well and overall good but nothing out of this world.  The fries were soggy and lukewarm! Also when the waitress sat our food down there was no ketchup. We asked for it and it took her a good 5 minutes to bring a bottle back to the table. We also shared a mixed drink. Can't remember the name but it was like a pina colada mixed with cherry that was delicious! I think overall where Friday's lacks for me is a substantial menu with good items and customer service. Our waitress was very blah. I will not return!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville
Tina P.,"Selden, NY",0,1,,2.0,1/1/2018,"I love Friday's food, however on New Year's eve i went into this Friday's to pick up food, It was Busy and I was expecting it to be a bit slow. It took 45 minutes in order for me to get my food & then once I arrived to my destination, I received the wrong order of wings ( I ordered Jack Daniels and received buffalo) and my Cajun chicken pasta had Hair in it. I also asked for no shrimp in the pasta due to an allergy to the shrimp but they put the shrimp in anyway. I called to let the manager know because I couldn't make it back to the restaurant due to the fact I drove a half an hour away to my location. I called 2x and there was no answer and when I called back the next day (today) the manager hung up on me.

R R.,"Mount Sinai, NY",0,26,,2.0,11/20/2017,"Party of 4 sat at the bar for drinks and apps.i usually shy away from tap beer because these chain restaurants sometimes don't clean the lines as often as they should.Their bottle beer selection is lacking so I ordered a Stella on tap.I got a whiff of rotten egg on every sip.When I told the bartender she knew exactly  which beer I had before I told her(she didn't serve it to me).We had wings,mozz.stks,wonton and Brussels sprouts.3 out of 4 were ehh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville
Tara M.,"Setauket- East Setauket, NY",262,232,239,3.0,1/11/2017,3 stars for inconsistency  I come here from time to time for late night food with friends.  Sometimes the service good other nights it's absolutely horrible. I was sparked to write this review after a friend and I visited last night for late night endless apps.  The dining room was closed so we sat in the bar area and it seemed as if there was just one server for the entire area (plus the bartender.) It took us 30 minutes just to get our first beer and the apps were another 30 minutes.    We ended up staying there for almost 2 hours! Completely insane.  Like I stated though there have been other times where the service is great and my food (by fridays fast food chain restaurant style) has always been good and never messed up. They also have reasonably priced fun mixed drinks.  Probably won't be back though after the disaster last night. I'm kinda just over it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville

The food is so good (everything we have ever tried from the wings, burgers to the dinners)! This particular location has been beautifully updated and has such an inviting atmosphere! The staff is awesome too ...including our fun day time bartender we love ...and best of all, their rewards program is SO worth it! You have no idea how many meals or apps you get free just for coming after singing up!!! You always get chips n salsa as a start just for being a rewards member! And they are delicious! Definitely home made chips! They also have delicious Cab Sav and for only 8.99 for a 9 oz glass! SCORE! That's why I'm a regular at this location !!

There's a waiter named Brandon (sorry if I spell it wrong) but he's great! I was there last night and I got him as my waiter and he took care of us very very well! I also came a few nights ago and received him as well and recognized him and he's awesome. I requested if he was able to put on the basketball game and 10 minutes later the game was up.

Erik D.,"Medford, NY",229,131,20,2.0,3/25/2016,"I can tell you now. This ""new"" Fridays? they tried wayyyy to hard to be ""trendy"". That useless lounge... took away a great eating area. The mirrors everywhere? I sat down, instantly was like :whoa: ""who's that ugly chap?"" ended up just being me. This is Fridays... not The Brookhaven Fair Fun House.   Sort of disappointed on the whole service there too. Again.. These new iPads? I guess the good ole pen and paper is ""so yesterday"" ? In fact I felt like the waiter stared at it.. didn't make the ordering process pleasurable. Kinda felt like I was talking to someone sitting on their cellphone. I felt like I was suppose to sit on my phone and just SnapChat him my order. The wait for food was borderline tragic. YES the food was hot upon delivery... however I shouldn't be waiting 35mins for a few Pretzel sticks with Dipping Cheese. Rest of my party got boneless wings and the other got a burger. Shouldn't be that long I feel. It wasn't like we were ordering well done steaks or anything of the sort.  My friends and I were all disappointed actually. We like the place this used to be. We would have tho's meet up's here all the time before the renovation happened.

rich m.,"Riverhead, NY",1,4,,2.0,11/28/2017,"Fridays is usually a good bet for fast food in a sit down setting. But this location has gone way downhill.  Service is generally good, but the new manager is not with it. My biggest complaint involves the coupons they send to my house every few months, which entitle me to half off a second entree, or 20% off my entire check. Normally the staff would take the coupon and apply it, no questions asked. But this last visit, the waitress was new, so she brought the coupon to the manager. She came back and told me her manager said I couldn't use the coupon because I ordered from the lunch menu. Duh. It was 1:00 pm! I told her the manager was wrong. The manger did not come to the table. The meal came and I again told the waitress that the manager was in error. She took the coupon a second time, and came back saying the manager agreed to take off a dollar and change. This, after we had ordered two lunches and beverages for over twenty dollars. 20% would have been over $4.00; and half off an entree, even more. I complained once more. At no point did the manager come to the table. I was so miffed that I wrote to Fridays via their website. And you know what happened?Nothing. Not even a reply. Bad for Fridays in general. But this location is off my list from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville

The restaurant is clean and employees seem to perform tidies whenever not helping customers. I was attended immediately and served pretty quickly too. My server, Sammie, was professional and always checking in on me during my dinner/drinks. They have a nice set up with the tables, booth and bar.

YelpBoy Y.,"Long Island, NY",3,24,1,2.0,8/10/2015,"When you order food from a TGI Fridays, you pretty much know what you're getting and that's fine. It shouldn't be terrible and it shouldn't amaze you. Where things go wrong here, is when you order ANY draft beer. After multiple times at this location, and trying different beers nearly each time, I've given up. You will not get a good draft beer here. Every draft beer is semi-flat with a skunky aroma and sour taste...and after all this time there is only one real explanation why: the draft lines in this place most likely haven't been cleaned and properly maintained in years. Doing so now would be pointless and one can only hope they replace them entirely and then maintain them correctly going forward. Go across the street to Applebee's and order a draft beer from there and you'll experience a night-and-day difference in quality: all drafts there are crisp and fresh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=40

This location is very, very slow. I've been here a couple of times, and both times the wait to be seated was very long. The food is not the same quality as their other location.

Brandi P.,"Coram, NY",48,4,2,1.0,10/10/2015,"This was the 2nd most ridiculous dining experience I've had. I came here to enjoy endless appetizer with my boyfriend and an entree. I sat down and the first server that came to my table wasn't my server and took my drink order. The 2ND person who came to my table wasn't my server either but he informed me he took my actual server's card for their order tablet to make it seem like she was working all her tables. As we ordered the appetizer and told the server we were going to share we were informed we would be charged a total of $24 for them if we even dared to share them. The reason for this is because corporate has gotten very upset that people coming to their restaurant dare to share appetizers which last time I checked are something normally shared. So we just ordered the entrees because it's crazy that the appetizers add up to the cost of our entrees combined. My server finally came over and apologized for us not seeing her until then. We only so her twice after that, to give us the food and to then give us the check. To end our night my boyfriend went to the bathroom before we left and they don't even have a sink.

I ordered a simple cheese burger with a side of Mac n cheese and what I got in return was a unidentifiable piece of meat sandwiched between two round stale pieces of bread! The Mac n cheese came in this fancy dish that gave the impression that it was going to be the item that saves the day but once again TGIF does it again. The Mac n cheese was so burnt I had to use my knife to cut through it..And for my girlfriends she ordered a turkey burger that was so revolting it made eating a piece of dirt better...

Well we ordered the Tuscan flat bread, which was cold when it arrived at our table but we didn't complain about it. My son ordered  buffalo wings, they were so shriveled and dry that we sent them back. The new order came out and it was fine. When the check came, we were charged full price for the apps (You'd think that a restaurant the size of Friday's would have the half price deal in their system already). Anyway, we pointed it out to the server who apologized and took the check back. We then waited for another ten minutes before we finally got the corrected check.

Stevie G.,"Coram, NY",23,28,11,4.0,1/26/2013,"Not sure why everyone is leaving poor reviews, I have read them but don't see the issues discussed.  From the hostess greeting you at the door to the door being opened as you leave you are sure to have a great experience. The revamped menu is a nice change of pace, these type of places can be slow but if you have a time limit no matter where I have gone I always found it beneficial to let your server know that you are in a rush thus setting the expectation and more importantly giving the server the chance to suggest what you might order or not order along with the possible -everyone is out and it is going to be a long time- (like they ever say that).  Also if you are in that quick of a rush sit in or at the bar you will get served faster or so it always seems, plus you can watch something on the 8 or so TV's. The selection of beers on tap in my observations seems to satisfy the beer drinkers.  The bartenders know how to make all the latest drinks and old standards never witnessed them stumped. They have during happy hour, drink specials and 1/2 price appetizers.  The NEW BBQ Chicken Flatbread appetizer is awesome and almost a meal onto itself. The staff all appear to really like what they are doing and have a true desire to want to help you have a good time.  Management is very active on the floor and watching to make sure guests are being taken care of.  The bartenders are a great mix of people, friendly, fast and quick with conversation. As with these types of chains you get as my Yelper friend ""Beth L"" would say; YAMBAGS - that come in with expired coupons, asking for hot water to wash the utensils, taking forever and ever and ever to figure out what they want only to change it and on top of everything else complaining about some fictions issue just because they know these companies will ""satisfy"" the guest. Be assured go in, order up a drink and some food and you will find its not the ""horrible"" place its made out to be.  Oh and if you see Craig or Kensie the managers or you sit at the bar with Tom or Angela tell them that Stevie G said HI.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=40

Shannon H.,"East Meadow, NY",13,73,7,1.0,10/23/2014,Okay went to eat here as thinking it wouldn't take long since we had my boyfriends kids with us and it was pretty late on a Sunday. I would say we arrived around 7. Now I have never seen a place so unorganized. We get to the host & hostess which the gentleman told us there is no wait. Then about 5 min later tells us he will sit us after the waitress is done taking her order from her current table which had about 14 people at. Well that 5 minutes turned into about 15. He also stayed that he wanted to sit us with her because she complains she needs money. ( for the future that is not something a patron needs to know or wants to know). When i asked the other hostess how much longer till we were seated she got very nasty and was playing on her cell phone as well. (Sorry to interrupt your text messaging)  So we get seated and takes her about 10 minutes to come over. Then she takes our drink order and never even brought silverware or napkins for about 30 minutes. The soda was flat and the food took forever to come out. They had about 7 different people helping this one table of 14 people and everyone else was being ignored. Thank god we only ordered on trays and no appetizers because that took more than enough time to get to us. The kids were falling asleep by the time we left!!

Kojack ..,"Manhattan, NY",23,128,3,1.0,10/21/2011,"This particular Friday's has recently undergone an interior renovation and unfortunately it doesn't look very attractive.  The music blaring out of the sound system is very, very loud and distracting where you have to shout across the table to be heard.  This may explain why the average age of their customers is only 21 years old.     They seem to have plenty of servers on staff so getting good service was not a problem.   However, the food leaves a lot to be desired.  My sirloin steak must have been the toughest steak I've ever eaten.  The manger did apologize and offered another selection.  Their appetizers and desserts however are good.  I probably will not eat at this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=40

It was four of us...We spent $120 for endless apps and drinks. the apps look nothing like the ones on TV, the marinara is watered down, the boneless wings were tough and overcooked, the quesadillas were soggy. the portions were miniscule.. I know it's endless but who wants to wait 15 minutes only to receive a child's portion. My husband's drink was sugary and watered down as well. Never Again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=20
Brian G.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",136,332,30,2.0,5/26/2015,"Came here for a quick bite when the two other restaurants we went to were closed down. Seems this whole area is not doing very well. The service was okay. Our waitress apologized several times for the long waits. Our food was good, though. T.G.I. Friday's does make good burgers with a variety of topping combinations. The bun on mine was kinda squashed, but wasn't noticably stale. Our appetizer, the potstickers, was okay. Was not my choice. I always say don't get Italian at a diner and only get Asian-inspired food at Asian-inspired restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=20
K J.,"St. Albans, NY",1,12,2,5.0,12/3/2016,"The vibe was completely on a different level, the waiting/lounge area was great, the holiday lights were so inviting and the piano player set the tone. The waitress, Kayla was awesome. Drinks were on point. Found a new spot for my cousins since she just moved to the area. Very happy with the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=20
Gregg A.,"East Northport, NY",34,108,55,5.0,2/27/2016,"Totally recommend this place. It's the new FRIDAYS going forward and it's awesome!  Classy, comfy and trendy.  Live music, tasteful. Great service...  Now they just have to work on the food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=20
Gabby S.,"Patchogue, NY",0,1,,5.0,3/4/2017,"AMAZING! Your a crazy person if u don't go to Fridays! Amazing deals + Amazing food andd excellent service! They also do lip sync and blast music through out the restaurant. The people are great and so is the vibe. My experiences with Fridays are always great, if I could I would give them a 10 star review. LOVE IT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=20
Stefan W.,"Coram, NY",39,144,15,1.0,6/8/2016,"What a DUMP.   Crappy service,  poorly prepared food... just disgusting.   Hamburgers are dry hockey pucks.  Drinks are watered...  Just say no.  Choose the Burger King next door or the McDonald's across the street.   Both of those are cleaner,  have better service,  and unlike Friday's,  edible food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=20
Franco C.,"Oyster Bay, NY",828,2232,20,3.0,9/21/2014,"Casual chain. I am somewhat confused by the bad reviews on here as I thought the place was fine with a particularly good set of bartenders on Friday night - but maybe it was just the time and day I go there? It is a chain so I will not go into the food:  it is middle of the road and geared mainly towards uniformity  You are not going there for a mind blowing meal and they are not offering anything of that ilk anyway, so go for apps, burgers and drinks; in this, you will not be disappointed.   The decor is very nice - apparently it was renovated not too long ago and it is funky and cool - I liked it.   Aforementioned bartenders were very good with both making drinks, and being there enough when they were needed and not lingering when they were not. Give it a shot! Parking all around",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=20
Dan K.,"Southlake, TX",399,90,73,1.0,7/9/2014,"I am writing this scathing review while sitting on a hotel toilet and violently expelling whatever bacteria I just ate from my $30 ""steak and lobster"" meal from this Fridays. I feel sicker than the normal type of sickness one should feel from food poisoning, probably because the lobster I first bit into was not only raw, but at a room temperature that gave it a disgustingly fishy taste (the one everyone dreads), as if they forgot to cook it after thawing. And the steak (which looked worse than a Lean Cuisine) was served completely raw and uncooked on the inside. I cannot believe that a restaurant would be capable of this type of inexcusable culinary debauchery. Trust the other low star reviews here and do yourself a favor by going instead to the Taco Bell across the street. And yes I'm still on the toilet feeling like I just drank polluted septic water.   I'll post pics of the poison I just ate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=20
Ellyn K.,"Medford, NY",0,17,,2.0,8/27/2016,"There's less to be desired here. We don't come here often, but when we do, service is hit & miss. Seating in dinning area seems too crowded and crunched together in new set up. I get that people take advantage of their endless apps for $10, but the waitress we had recently didn't have to be downright rude when explaining we couldn't share one app plate... we understood, but didn't need the attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=20
Jamie I.,"Holtsville, NY",0,6,,3.0,1/6/2017,Food is always okay. Nothing super special. Last time I visited the service was terrible. It was not busy at all and our waitress spent most of her time chatting with friends.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=20
Britney S.,"Medford, NY",0,3,,4.0,1/31/2017,"I come here all the time all the bartenders are great at this location.

Rachel A.,"Charlotte, NC",0,4,,1.0,12/11/2016,"Service wasn't bad.

Michelle W.,"Farmingville, NY",1,34,4,3.0,2/18/2016,Very nice decor and vibe. Last time we went in January 2016 they food was great but the service was lacking. We didn't get drinks or silverware until asking numerous times. All the entrees came out at different times and it just kinda ruined the flow of our night. The manager was very nice and refunded the one dish that came out extremely late but in general they need to step up the service in the future to keep my business.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=20
Rohan B.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",7,105,131,1.0,3/17/2016,"What a horrible experience. It took 40 minutes for my food to come out (I was one of two tables). The waitress was rood, got mad when my friends and I shared food we paid for. She then got mad and said that she would charge us for the free refills on our soda. Horrible person, horrible service.

S V.,"Mount Sinai, NY",50,63,2,5.0,2/29/2016,This place is amazing. Yes a little pricey but well worth it. What staff is amazing and professional. I just wish they had half price apps after 10. Otherwise I definitely recommend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=20
Jessica J.,"Newport News, VA",0,8,,5.0,9/11/2016,I personally really like the feel of this new Friday's. It's a very classy feel and doesn't feel like you are in a chain restaurant. I sat at the bar and the service was really good for a Friday night. A lot of people that write the bad reviews don't like change but I personally think change is s good thing and an improvement.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=20
Ken W.,"Point Pleasant Beach, NJ",0,27,1,2.0,9/3/2015,"I know TGI Fridays is not fine dining by any stretch but you typically get good service and a decent meal at reasonable price.   Walked in sat at the bar, the bar top looked like someone had dumped a trash bag on it, I sat in front of this mess for about 10 minutes until one of the four bartenders finished their conversation and came over to ask me what I wanted.  I ordered a beer and had to ask him to wipe down the bar. Got my beer and menu and then sat for another 15/20 minutes while the bartenders chatted with each other. Finally ordered my meal, a 10oz fillet with broccoli and fries, my food arrived pretty quickly, the meat was OK but the fries were cold an soggy, the broccoli was ok. Just piss poor service and quality, take your business elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=20
Brett B.,"Ridge, NY",9,75,11,1.0,9/10/2012,Can you give 0 stars? Just stopped on my way home for wings and a drink. Sat at the bar...there were 3 bartenders...I noticed one spending a lot of time talking with a friend. Didn't think a lot of it because it wasn't so busy.  Well it did get a lot busier as I sat there. I had my wings and drink and waited for the bill...and waited and waited and waited. Then I got it about 15 minutes after I was well done with dinner. Then I just wanted to pay. It was 20 more minutes and I went to the host stand and asked to pay...they got my bill back to the bartenders. I am not sure of the guy that took my bill and processed it...but when he handed it to me he let me know I wasn't the only customer....really? And TGIF isn't the only place to eat. I go to a TGIF about 3-4 times a month....I will avoid this one for sure. No class - no customer service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-farmingville?start=60
