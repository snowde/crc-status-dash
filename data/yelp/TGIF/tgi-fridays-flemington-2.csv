Melissa S.,"Flemington, NJ",149,71,361,5.0,4/13/2017,"Stopped in for a quick drink during Happy Hour.  Paige, the bartender, made the perfect drink, the Pomegranate LIT!  It is a typical LIT, but instead of coke, a Pom syrup is added which makes the drink taste so good!! It is reasonably priced during Happy Hour (4-7pm) @ $6, and about $9.50 during regular hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2
Darren B.,"Lambertville, NJ",6,89,13,2.0,10/28/2017,Got the new 30% bigger ribs for 12.99. Man I'd be pissed if they were over 15 and can't imagine them 30% smaller. Subbed Brussels and was upset for the $3.00 dollar up charge. Web said 99 cents. Overall was not happy ribs did not have a lot of meat and I ate the whole rack and two sides. Disappointed. Wish I would have the ribs at more than Q in Lambertville. Rib are more than twice as big.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2
Stu L.,"Flagtown, NJ",0,10,,3.0,9/6/2017,"We had endless apps and the food was inconsistent, first was great second was not so great and even finished different.  This time service was terrible.  But I have been to this location before when it was all good.  I guess I got the bad chef and terrible waitress, double whammy",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2
John H.,"High Bridge, NJ",20,14,12,5.0,4/7/2017,Stopped in on a whim around 4pm and glad I did . The food was delicious  prepared just right.  I sat at the bar  and Virginia who was tending bar was very personal and knowledgeable about the menu.  The General Manager Ralph stopped by to  check on things and  introduce himself. He was excited to tell us about uo coming events at this location.  Definitely will be a returning customer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2
Keri M.,"Frenchtown, NJ",115,10,11,1.0,5/21/2017,"I never give one start reviews but this takes the cake.  I come here often enough and the food is standard for a chain restaurant like fridays. I went in with my siblings (5 of us total) one day around 3:30 and got sat at a round table and our server Kat came over to take our drink orders. We asked to get moved to a booth and it was like the end of the world, she cleared off a booth that the servers were using to sit at, I've worked in restaurants I get this can be annoying but in a mostly empty place I figured it wasn't that big of a deal. From there is was downhill, I've honestly never felt more unwelcome for NO reason. Kat went to a coworker and asked really loudly ""can you switch tables with me please?!"" And the answer was obviously no, she reluctantly came back to us. Three of us did the endless apps, one got just fries, and the last needed his meal to go but had to leave before it was ready and she had some rude comment to add about that; we just told her to leave it at the table and we will take it home. When I asked my brother if he'd like to try some wings for the next round of apps she said ""that's not allowed you can't share"" and i said oh well he's only going to have one, trying to be light and funny even though I was feeling shamed and like I should leave. I think we got two maybe three rounds of apps and we got out of there after 5. It took ridiculously long, Kat was so rude for no reason and avoided our table. Seriously, I have never been somewhere where I've felt like such a nuisance. Despite her horrible attitude towards us I left her 20% tip. The next time I came in I was told Kat would be my server and then we saw each other and suddenly Brandan as my server. Unbelievable!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2
Gilbert Johnson J.,"Clinton, NJ",0,5,,1.0,9/22/2017,"Fridays in Flemington is one of the poorest restaurants in business today.  The entire staff from waitress to bartender to manager are untrained and unskilled.  Food is low quality, stale, and poorly prepared.  This location used to do a good business but now it is dependent on the TGI brand.  Locals do not return to establishments this bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2
Jen G.,"Flemington, NJ",0,11,,3.0,7/9/2016,"Food was good (steak and lobster special was actually done very well) but the woman's bathroom was DISGUSTING. It may be the most disgusting bathroom  I have ever been in and that includes the Skellar and Phyrst in State College. I complained to the manager - hopefully he does something.

Terri F.,"Ringoes, NJ",54,7,,4.0,3/11/2017,"Great place to go have a beer & burger!  Its a chain so you get consistent food across locations...

Debbie K.,"Flemington, NJ",149,177,2588,3.0,7/27/2015,I come here a lot. The food is not always consistent but for the majority times that I have been here the food has been good. The service really depends on your server. During football season I like to come and sit in the bar area. The service is always good at the bar because obviously they're always standing around where you can call them. They have nice specials for drinks and appetizers depending on the day of the week.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2
Frederick B.,"Anaheim, CA",0,16,,1.0,3/7/2017,"Our family celebrated a Birthday Luncheon this past Sunday (3/5/2017).  We all ordered appetizers, entrees and drinks. Unfortunately, I ordered the Cobb Salad with Chicken. When my salad arrived, I couldn't believe how small the portion was! I've eaten these years back and have always found the portions to be generous. This is no longer the case at TGI Fridays. Secondly, my chicken was raw, not cooked. I chewed a piece and could not swallow it; I can only equate it to trying to chew a rubber band! I sent the salad back and ordered a Cobb Salad with beef. TGI Fridays did make good on the salad however, but this was my last visit. Portions have become smaller, while prices have of course, increased. So long TGI Fridays, you lost another customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2
The C.,"Flemington, NJ",0,6,,1.0,11/23/2016,Horrible Food and smell of stale smoke. Only reason we stopped was because we had a gift card.

Richard W.,"Flemington, NJ",0,7,,1.0,2/21/2015,"Yeah, it was that bad.  I ordered the clam chowder.  It came slightly warm.  I ate some of it, but when I bit into a potato chunk it was cold on the inside.  My wife told the waitress who said, ""we can't have that!""  After she walked away, I mocked her, ""Here, let me nuke that for you.""  That's exactly what they did.  The bowl was brought back -- it was the same bowl with some of the soup eaten -- and it was so f'ing hot  I had to wait until after I ate my mediocre entree to finish it. Let's face it, TGI Fridays is for teen date nights and happy hour beer swilling.  If you want a good meal, go to a real restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2
Jeff H.,"Whitehouse Station, NJ",73,54,,1.0,4/1/2016,"Stopped in for a a few after dinner drinks at the bar. Immediately stricken by the foul vomit bar mildew odor. Completely turned our stomachs.  I don't want to drink a cocktail and have a prolific wafting mildew odor in my nostrils. Can't they clean the bar and make it presentable for guests? Thought it was the Parmesan cheese dish the lady next to me ordered, or the fettuccini Alfredo that was left at the bar. Nope, it was the stale rotten cheesy smell from the bar beverage area.  If you visit, bring Vicks to rub under your nose. GROSS, need to puke now. Seriously, toe cheese is better than this putrid stank.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2
Randy T.,"Hackettstown, NJ",29,213,3,3.0,12/9/2015,"I've been here a couple of times. It's not the best Friday's as far as service is concerned, but the food quality is decent. It's a good stand by when nothing else seems good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2
Nicholas S.,"Ocean City, MD",0,27,1,3.0,1/29/2016,"I have been today Fridays several times. My most recent trip was a Thursday. And it didn't seem that busy but the staff was very slow. However do not let that fool you, their food is average for a chain place like this. It is somewhat expensive depending on what you get. When I go here I usually get ribs which I know will be pricey but it's one of the few places I do like ribs from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2
Victor F.,"Edison, NJ",0,14,1,3.0,10/26/2015,"Food was good but the service was sub par. Although this was true, we were treated nicely by the management and were able to watch the Giants game that was on at our request to change the TV channel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2
Alex R.,"New York, NY",74,29,3,1.0,3/29/2016,"Very poor wait staff- waited at least 10 minutes before we were even asked what drinks we would like (by a waiter who wasn't even managing our table).  Our waitress finally came to ask what drinks we would like, but we said another waiter took our order, she replied with a rude attitude, and asked for our meal order.  That was the last time she helped our table.  The waitress did not ask once if we were doing okay or needed anything.  We had to physically get out of the booth to ask her for the check because she continued to walk past us without offering it, when our plates were empty and my family were all on our phones waiting for her.  My drink was never filled once.  I presented the waitress with a poor tip as the only work she did for us was take our meal order, and I left a ""poor service"" note on the check.  The food was sub par, and my Caesar salad was a sad excuse of a vegetarian option (I took a risk ordering the salad instead of my normal veggie burger which is more than obviously a processed frozen patty).  Bad food and bad service, this is not the first time the wait staff has been awful.  We have decided only to return to Friday's for dessert, as it's quick and requires little to no effort from our waiter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2
Steve Y.,"Ellicott City, MD",6,19,,1.0,8/27/2014,This place is horrific. Service is horrible. Food is microwaved. Prices are steep.  This is a chain restaurant. Why are your prices so much when you buy your food in such large quantities?  $26 for a rack of ribs?  $25 for a strip steak that was frozen? At these prices I'd rather give my business to a local. Even if the food is just as bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2
J J.,"New York, NY",11,38,,4.0,11/20/2015,To be honest this is actually one of the better locations in the franchise. This Friday's has incorporated a lounge with pool tables and does different events nightly in the bar area. I've heard some decent local DJ's there. It's a townie crowd so make of that what you will. The staff is friendly and the food is what you would expect at a Friday's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2?start=20
Dan E.,"Branchburg, NJ",56,861,26,2.0,1/2/2015,"I'm between a 1 and a 2 for this place but I'll round up.  I hadn't been to this particular location in years so I stopped in with a few people the other day.  We entered and there was no host or hostess so we waited...and waited...and waited. Finally, someone appeared.  There were a ton of dirty tables (i.e. they had not yet been cleaned off from the previous diners).  We waited for the table to be cleared and had a seat.  Service was pretty spotty throughout the entire meal.  Our waitress did not check in on us too often.  Since it was happy hour, we ended up ordering a number of apps.  As you probably know, all Friday's menus are the same but they have these great pretzels that come with an awesome cheese dipping sauce.  They're my favorite app.  I was also a fan of the nachos we ordered.  I wasn't huge on the buffalo wings or the sliders.   Overall, it was just OK.  I don't love the food at Friday's but at least you know what you are getting.  This location seemed incredibly unorganized and the service was just OK.  Happy hour prices are great, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2?start=20
Diesel H.,"Milford, NJ",57,472,197,4.0,5/2/2012,"Oh my gosh. I am so sad this has horrible reviews!  This happens to be my husband and I's ""go to"" when we don't know what else to eat or don't feel like cooking! I love it here. Most the staff is super friendly and helpful with the menu. You really cannot beat the prices - half off apps all day sunday?! thats awesome!  I always get the green bean fries and the potstickers... both incredible. my husband normally just gets a burger and fries or sweet potato fries with a beer on tap. This is a regular casual dining experience which I strongly prefer over all the rest of them [chilis, applebess ect]. Sometimes my water tastes like the frenchtown roller rink but I just send it back and get fresh water and its all good.

Tyler H.,"Maple Shade Township, NJ",0,2,,1.0,1/20/2016,"I frequent many different Friday's locations for their various drink specials throughout the week.  This location doesn't participate in any of TGI Fridays normal specials or pricing. A Long Island ice tea is $4 all the time at any other location I've been to, but this location charges $7.50.  Double the price for the same drink at the same restaurant?

L S.,"Flemington, NJ",0,38,,2.0,8/25/2015,"Service and food was typical TGI Fridays.  My rating is low because the booth, table and menus felt gross to touch.  Touching the seats to get in was tacky, the table was sticky, as was the menus.  I had to go to the bathroom to grab a damp towel to wipe down my seat since there were crumbs on it.  I will avoid going there in the future unless I hear that the cleanliness gets better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2?start=20

Liz C.,"Flemington, NJ",17,1,,1.0,7/5/2015,"Today I was at Friday's I am a regular customer I go there very often but this particular day I was with a few friends and we went to eat and have a few beers. After getting 12 beers between 2 people within 5 hours we got told that they can no longer serve us alcohol. We were playing pool calmly and quietly while watching the game of USA vs Japan. The bartender John told us the manager had told him that we cannot be served anymore alcohol, but John had said said he had no issues with serving us more alcohol due to us not being a issue or causing a commotion. We asked the manager why the other group of people in front of us were still drinking if they were there even before we got there and they had already been drinking when we got there. We asked her if it was racism towards the color of our skin. We asked for the corporate number so we could make a complaint to this issue. She gave us a faulty number which lead to no where. We paid the bill and left. While waiting for the taxi to arrive to pick us up. The manager Maggie had called the police saying we were a threat to the property. The police had flashed me and my friends in the face with the flashlight. They asked why we were sitting outside of the property. We responded we were simply waiting for the taxi to pick us up. They said we cannot be in the property. These policemen approached us as if we were criminals doing something wrong when we were simply leaving because she said we can only stay to watch the t.v but we left instead . The police told us that we couldn't wait for the taxi at Friday's and that we had to wait at Dunkin donuts. The big issue is that we are a latino group of friends. We weren't making any noise while drinking we were just having fun. Yet we got told we couldn't have anymore alcohol even though the white group in front of us drank more than us and stayed longer and even laughed when Maggie said we couldn't drink anymore. I feel very offended to this and this shouldn't even be a issue in Friday's. We love the place and it's a great place to eat and drink and relax with friends.  One reason we love this place is also the great bartender John. He's very nice towards us and anyone who comes. But the manager Maggie is just something else and she offended us very much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2?start=20
Talia W.,"Highland Park, NJ",0,12,1,3.0,5/25/2013,"I just had dinner here; this was my first experience at a TGI Friday's at all and it was pretty good! I am a vegan, so this review is specifically about that aspect of the experience.  Summary in one line: they can be pretty accommodating to vegans and are willing to help with anything they can! I was initially hesitant about going to an American chain restaurant like this because of expectations of a very unfriendly environment for vegans and also having read the menu and not seeing much. However, I gave them a call in the morning to ask them about how accommodating they would be for special dietary constraints and the manager sounded very willing and helpful. So I figured... okay! I went with my friend and his parents on a Saturday evening. It was pretty packed, but after about a 7-10 minute wait the four of us were seated at a booth near the bar. The booth was a little noisy and at times I couldn't hear my friend talking right next to me, but that environment was entirely understandable, so no complaints there. Note: they don't take reservations, but they do take some sort of ""priority reservation""; that is, we called ahead and when we got there we had priority for the next open table over other walk-ins waiting. Since I had called ahead earlier in the day, I believe they recognized me pretty quickly. I asked them the typical vegan questions and they were very helpful and were able to make some adjustments. We got a bruschetta appetizer, sans parmesan, and it was loaded with tomatoes and very tasty. My friend got the sizzling chicken and shrimp, his dad got a rack of ribs, and his mom got salmon and shrimp. I got a black bean burger (they checked the ingredients and it IS vegan) with avocado, tomato, lettuce, onions, BBQ sauce, and broccoli on the side. They are also totally fine with cooking in anything you bring and give to them - I brought some of my own daiya cheese and they happily topped off my burger in melty cheesy goodness. It was all sandwiched together in some nice toasty rye bread. I really loved the meal and thought it was delicious! My friend also notes that the chicken was pretty standard fare, a little lacking in flavor and thus he was borrowing the Jack Daniels BBQ sauce from the other dishes, but the shrimp was good. We ended the meal with some fresh fruit and the whiskey cake with pecans and ice cream. For me, the most noteworthy thing about this place is the great and friendly service, how accommodating they are to new situations (they never dealt with a vegan like me but they were perfectly fine with deviating from the menu), and how helpful they are. That being said, it's still an American chain restaurant, and the food is greasy and doesn't have a whole lot of healthy options. But you don't go to TGI Friday's for that - so, for what it was, I think it was excellent!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-flemington-2?start=20
