Rozalino W.,"Alexandria, VA",0,5,,1.0,2/9/2017,"Terrible service, management and food! I will never return to this place again. Stay away from this location. They have no clue what quality customer service means.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville?start=40
Fidelia K.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,4,,1.0,1/19/2017,"I have been to other TGIFridays and never had a complaint but I'm warning anyone who's thinking about eating at this location, find another one because you may be extremely disappointed and truthfully if I had read these reviews I would've gone to another restaurant. My friend and I walked in almost 8pm on the dot!  We'll start w/the waitress who introduced herself as ""Diva"" ok yes! To me that name is synonymous with ""I'm in charge""!  I should've known that wouldn't be the case when I asked her about my favorite appetizer, spinach bruschetta which I couldn't recall the name at the time but when I described it to her as ""spinach on flatbread"" you would think she had a clue. Nope I had to look at the menu because all she kept coming up with was the spinach dip! She went to put in for my appetizer and gave us time to look at the menu.  I'm a vegetarian which I pointed out that I don't eat meat or fish and was actually hoping they'd have some options now because they need to cater to the vegetarian trend!  Of course the only suggestion she had was the veggie bean burger which has NO taste as far as I'm concerned.  I looked on the menu and was pleasantly surprised that it included  a new veggie addition or so I thought,  referred to as the ""Mediterranean Mahi Naan"" described on menu as ""grilled mahi mahi drizzled w/balsamic glaze on naan bread w/cucumber yogurt sauce, balsamic-glazed onions, garlic, basil & roma tomato bruschetta and mixed greens w/kale"".  Mind you I had no idea what ""mahi mahi"" was until later I found out that it's fish but asked miss ""diva"" specifically if there's any meat & her response was ""it's all vegetables"".  We got our drinks and waited for my appetizer.  30 mins later our meals were on the table and when I asked miss so-called diva where my appetizer was she responded ""they haven't brought that out yet...i'm sorry...you ordered what again...?"" I told her the only reason I'm even there was mainly to get the spinach bruschetta.  Another 15 minutes passed as she returned to find out if I had my appetizer. Needless to say it was almost an hour before it finally arrived w/the Manager who apologized profusely & at that time attempted to resolve that mishap by telling us the appetizer was on the house. Apart from my friend enjoying his turkey burger I had lost my appetite at that point and decided to take my course ""to go"".  This diva brought us our check and muttered something about our bill being ""half price""  and left to take care of another patron but I'm thinking the entire bill was half-price, come to find out she was really saying that the appetizer was half-price.  In other words she took it upon herself to give us that so-called discount as opposed to asking what the manager had decided.  My friend was so disgusted he left the restaurant and asked me to handle it. I directed ms diva to talk to the manager as he's the one who decided to exclude the appetizer from the bill due to their incompetency.  She again apologized for her mistake and told me she'll remove the $5.00 discrepancy.  I also was fed up at that point and knew that it wouldn't make or break my friend's pocket because it was frustrating and I wasn't going to spend another minute in that pathetic establishment.  Do not waste your time and money at this TGIFridays.  At least you were forewarned!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville?start=40
Big T.,"Temple Hills, MD",0,5,,2.0,2/23/2017,Went for lunch thinking 10 buck apps quick and easy...nope. Waitress was nice not attentive.

They should've just closed their doors for the night, but noooo, that would just be too much like right!

Robyn K.,"District Heights, MD",184,58,60,1.0,7/23/2016,"So let me say- giving one star feels like too much. We showed up at 7:05pm. We were told there would be a fifteen minute wait and asked if we were sure we wanted to wait that long. I looked around and there was only 7 other tables seats out of probably 20. I said we would wait. When I said that, the host immediately sat us at table. (confusing, right?). So we were seated by 7:10. The waitress acknowledged us at 7:36. She said she would be right back (again, we were really confused because there were only 8 tables seated, including us. And I counted 5 waitresses. The waitress came back at 7:58 and told us she was sorry that the kitchen was so backed up. We told her we hadn't ordered yet. She said 'Oh i know. I'm just letting you know. If you put in an order right now it will take at least another 30 minutes to cook."" So at this point, we didn't even have water or anything and we had been seated for over 50 minutes. So we just left. The waitress got angry and said ""Fine I didn't need your tip anyways."" We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville?start=40
Todd S.,"Shaw, Washington, DC",3,10,,1.0,4/29/2016,1.5 hour lunch experience in a somewhat empty restaurant. Well it was nearly empty when we started AND we saw a decent amount of turnover. A table arrived 15 minutes after we did and somehow finished their food and paid their bill 30 minutes before we got our food. The menus were different and 3 of us had the menus without the lunch specials. The nachos were cold. 6 chips total that tasted like microwave food. No silverware. Catsup bottle was empty when we finally got it.  If you have to eat there sit at the bar.  More attentive service.

Malik J.,"Clinton, MD",340,36,132,1.0,11/15/2015,"Man this place was God awful! I couldn't believe such things could happen at a restaurant! Staff was terrible! We stood at the entrance for at 3 minutes before getting the little help that we had received. And we only received that help because my friend walked up to them and asked them for help. Then when we get to the back to pick up our food, they want to catch an attitude! Like man, don't you know I'll ""set it off"" in this mother land!!! Better recognize sucker! Anyway, back to the matter at hand. The police officers were just starring at us like we were criminals too.

The customer service was terrible! Took 20mins for anyone to greet us. Server never checked up on us. Food was cold. Manager Jameel Spriggs had a terrible attitude when complaining about our service.

Princess W.,"Albany, GA",0,1,,1.0,7/3/2016,"This has probably the worst experience dining at any restuarant. I don't know where to begin, I guess let's talk about the attitudes. No one wants to be there, clearly by their disgusting attitudes when speaking to customers. Next issue was that we happened to be sitting at a table underneath the leaky ceilings. When brought to the manager's attention, his suggestion was that we scoot our table more to the left and a wet floor sign. The hell? After having water dripping on our table and items for a period of time, and multiple complaints, we were moved to the corner of the back of the restaurant. We got here at 4:35, and the children's food came out at 5:30. The adults' food came out 20 mins later with the exception of one person (who had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the wrong order). The waiter named Javon, for whatever reason had an atrocious attitude from the beginning, decided since we inconvenienced him by moving from the best seats in the house, he would no longer serve us or check on us. Finally, we had to chase down the manager to give us the incorrect check. Everything about this place was awful and I feel like this was a glimpse of how dining in hell would be.

I would hear so many stories about how ghetto it was, how the service wasn't up to par, and the drinks were watered down. Jump ahead a year or two later, finally get a chance to see what the hoopla was about. First time- iT was ok; nothing to holler about. I ordered a drink called the ""DC Tap Water"", not knowing it was straight alcohol with like 5% chase. I sent it back with no issue, until a manager came and told me that next time I had to know what I was ordering before making my selection because according to them, the liquor that is used is very expensive..... I shot her the ""Bitch, just take the drink back and quit it"" look. Ridiculous But overall, the service is ok; you get ppl who like their job (Cuz no one at this location can say they absolutely love it) and ppl who can give two rats asses.

Jeanna M.,"Washington, DC",5,40,93,2.0,3/22/2015,"My two cousins & I decided to hang out at this specific TGI Fridays simply for it's convenient location.  There was a 15 wait for seating in the bar area & a 40 minute wait for dining area. Take a guess at which one we chose. Once seated it was 6 minutes before the waiter arrived. We decided on the Endless Apps Special & ordered some drinks. Within 4 minutes a bartender( I think) came to our table to explain to me that by ordering a frozen margarita the alcohol would be thinned out. This woman went back & fourth with me until I switched my drink, I chose a double berry mojito. What I don't get is why provide the customer with the option of a  frozen or regular margarita if you can't or won't accommodate the proper alcohol measurements for the drink smh. The drinks took 10 minutes & the food took 15 minutes. We were never given any napkins or straws until requested. Once the drinks finally arrived, mine & my cousin's were mixed up. One of the drinks had waaay too much use of alcohol & was not properly garnished. When the check finally arrived we had to remind them to take of the two drinks that they ruined off smh. I do not recommend the load potatoes skins. Turns out they deep fry them. Meaning all you taste is crunchy thin skin & oil.

Matter fact, the music is dope and you can hear it from the dining area.  My SALAD took 45 minutes. We ordered 2 appetizers, only got ONE (she def forgot altogether, bc it wasn't on the check). My mai tai took 10 minutes. The silverware was dirty.  How dirty, you ask? I ate the first few bites with my fingers because it had what may have been old brownie residue, and I had to ask 2 diff servers to bring me a replacement.  The server was nice but that's all I can say about that. Maybe she was too busy? But honestly I just came to eat, not sympathize (let's be honest). She never came to refill water until we were basically done, and we got half a to-go box bc she kept walking past without bringing the top.  Salmon was well cooked but it took so long, I was chewing my fingers by the time it came.

Lee S.,"New York, NY",28,2,,1.0,4/10/2017,"This was the absolute worst dining experience I've had in life. I wish I could say I am exaggerating, but sadly I cannot.  Not only was there a sour smell lingering in the air around the bar, but we were told our waitress was new and would not be ready to service us for 10-15 minutes. We waited because we were hungry and excited about trying the new promo: $10 endless appetizers. Cheap food, doesn't have to mean low service expectations. Our waitress was sweet, at first, using a tablet to take down our order. But quickly began dropping the ball by not bringing us silverware, which we still didn't have by the END of our meal. Really disappointing. We spent most of our 2+ hour meal waiting for food (you'd think we'd have been able to at least get our appetizers replenished ONCE within a 45 minutes, but no) and repeating our request for utensils, napkins, side sauces, and refills on water.  Aside from her scratching her braids at the table, which I managed (somehow) to overlook, our waitress had very little follow through. While waiting for our second set of appetizers (45 min), she must've stopped by our table at least 4-5 times to tell us our food should be ready. I watched as surrounding tables were serviced (though also just as slowly and sporadically), and we couldn't even get refills on water or napkins to wipe our hands after the first set of food we'd eaten.  Talking to the manager proved to be even more of a waste of time as we explained that we'd been waiting for the essentials: water, utensils, and napkins. And he just looked at us as if he couldn't care less. As if we were an inconvenience or wasting his time. Not to mention when he came, he'd only brought 2 out of 3 of ordered dishes. Another manager had to be roped in to get us our checks and 3rd dish (this was all only a second order of appetizers).  Through the duration of our time there, the restaurant waiters seemed to be hovering in the back.

Before you ask, I knew this was Friday's so my expectations were minimal. It STILL disappointed. Hugely. The server, while sweet, was so uninformed about the menu that we basically had to walk HER thru it, pointing at pictures so she'd understand what we wanted.  The wine I ordered (and NEEDED by the time our food arrived) was not what I got. It took 20 minutes for that to be rectified. TWENTY MINUTES. By the time I got my drink, my wife (who I insisted start without me) was halfway done with hers. In fact, she actually had to get up and seek out the server twice to find out where the food and wine were.  I asked if they had tartar sauce 3x and each time was told 'we have cocktail sauce'. I now assume that meant no but at the time I honestly questioned whether she'd heard or understood me. Not exaggerating.  My broccoli was cold. Not room temp. ICE COLD. It took another 20 minutes for them to bring out the sweet potato fries i requested instead (bc I now had zero faith in their respect for vegetables). How do FRIES take 20 mins? If you're doing the math, by the time they arrived, our entire meal was done. W IN THE ENTIRE EFF!? And the most annoying part was that although our server was apologetic, she displayed ZERO urgency.

I look for the waiter to order, he makes eye contact then walks over, I open my mouth he says ""hold on"" and walks off....hmmm, ok. He comes back 4 or 5 mins later I give him my order, ask for extra sauces off top as not to be a bother later on he nods walks off again before I can even ask for a drink or glass of water. Food comes 15 mins later, no extra sauces so I ask again, and ask for water as well, he nods, no apologies, comes back with sauces, no water *sigh*. I wait for him to come back. he doesn't until its check time...so this whole time I've been without a beverage. Checks come, I pay mine separately with my card, the others pay in cash, we wait for the receipts....manager comes over and asks whose card # ends with ****, I say me, he proceeds to tell me that the entire bill had been accidentally charged to my card by the waiter because he hasn't learned how to split checks, but its really like a hold so the money PROBABLY wont come out of the account, it just wont be available for 48 to 72 hours....Whatttt? So I tell him that's an inconvience for me and ask how he plans to remedy the situation, he tells me with a straight face ""there's nothing I can really do""...Sir, you tried it! There is plenty you can do. You can comp my food, offer me food, beverages, give a certificate etc....there are options, I shouldn't have even had to ask a manager with great customer service would have offered to options to show they were sorry and wanted to make the situation better for the customer. He then goes on to say ""free food wont put the money back on your card"" *gasp* I had to clutch my pearls to keep from laying into his ass.

Michael G.,"Dayton, OH",0,1,,1.0,8/5/2014,"Worst TGIF location ever (5740 Silver Hill Rd. District Heights, MD), thank goodness we were only visiting the area DC.  We will never go back or recommend this location.  My wife, daughter and I arrived at about 10:15 pm. on Sunday the 3rd of August and waited about 50 minutes for a table.  Finally, after sitting at the table for 15 minutes with several servers walking by to include the waiter for our section. A waiter that we later found out was our waiter, stopped at the table right next to us and looked right at me but didn't bother stop by to say anything like ""someone will be right with you or would you like something to drink"".  I then witnessed what appeared to be an argument between the manager and the waiter about who was supposed to be serving us, after several more minutes passed with no one paying any attention to us I was done with this.  Had I known the area and it was not 11:30 at night we would have just left and ate elsewhere.  At this point I told my wife we would just place an order to go and eat on the bed in the hotel room. Which was something we were trying to avoid having to do. I walked up to the hostess and told her I was done waiting and was going to just place an order to go. She walked me back to where I needed to place the order and told two employees that I was upset with the lack of service I had received to this point.  After placing my order (Parmesan-Crusted Chicken, Triple Stack Reuben and Jack Daniel's Chicken Sandwich without bacon) one employee called the manager over and told him what had taken place and ask him to discount the bill. I continued to witness deplorable behavior of the employees, to include one waitress walking up to the food service window which was about 8 feet away and yelled at the cooks ""N**** I need my food now""  to which the manager simply turned his head and told her to stop.  I also got to witness firsthand waiters/waitress running around playing grab ass, throwing ice at each other and down the waitress shirts and dancing around like they are out on the town and not a place of business working for a pay check.  When the manager was done discounting my bill, he just walked away without even apologizing for what I overheard or my overall terrible experience.  This is something I place directly on the lack of management of this TGIF location. If all of this was not bad enough once we got back to the room my wife's Jack Daniel's Chicken Sandwich was wrong, they did leave the bacon off as I asked but forgot the Cajun-spiced fried onion strings and Jack Daniel's mayo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville?start=80

Every time I try to patron this establishment something always goes wrong.  Everyone in my household can vouch this place is not managed well at all.  How are they going to charge for extra condiments?  Excuse me I thought honey mustard and Jack Daniels sauce were complementary with the meal!  I wonder if the corporate office knows about this!  At any rate it doesn't matter if I'm placing a call in order or if I'm actually dining in the customer service is severely lacking.  This last visit I ""tried"" to dine in emphasis on tried!  The hostess kept calling others to be seated that had arrived much later than I.  Now I am generally a patient person, but dang I kept asking how much longer the hostess was like maybe ""5 more minutes"" so I waited and waited and you guessed it waited in all I waited 45 minutes.  Meanwhile people who came in after me got seated right away!  I was only a party of 2, so I don't get it!   And, to add insult to injury one of the waiters seated some customers that I know arrived much later than me.  It appeared he knew them, so laughingly he went ahead and seated them.  To hell with the wait list I guess.

M W.,"District Heights, MD",0,16,1,1.0,3/13/2013,"Our first visit was shortly after they opened and on New Years Day.  We waited for a table for 30 minutes and were then eventually seated at a table in the bar area -- that had been open and clean the entire time we waited.  After sitting at the table for an additional 15 minutes, with employees passing by us not even stopping to say ""someone will be right with you"", I had to go back to the ""hostess"" and ask for either a server OR a manager.  We were told that there was no manager on the premises (I called BS on that one immediately), but a server would be there within a minute.  After another 10 minutes sitting at the table with no server paying any attention to us, I yelled to the hostess ""IS THIS BECAUSE WE ARE WHITE AND GAY?!?!?""  Surprisingly, a manager appeared out of nowhere and was from one corner of the restaurant to our corner faster than I could blink!  Finally got to order a meal, it showed...but not what we ordered. We went back and forth with the server and manager just trying to get a meal and to give them a shot.  We never did get what we ordered and left with only a drink tab (the drinks were weak to boot!).  Fast forward 15 months and we decided to give them another shot.  I wanted a burger, bad, and we had received a coupon in the mail from them.  We showed up and, while they were busy, we were seated almost immediately.  Ironic as it was, it was the same table we were seated at on our prior visit.   Luckily, we ordered an appetizer platter of wings, cheese stick things and their new soft pretzels.  I only had the pretzels, but the partner cleared the platter of the wings and cheese rather quickly.  He was either hungry, or they were good.  The pretzels were OK (Smokey Bones are much, much, much better -- but these were edible).  The partner and I both ordered burgers, cooked medium.  While we waited and waited, I told my partner that I did not have a good feeling about the experience.  One thing was that one person took our drink order, another person brought it to us.  The first person took our appetizer order, someone else brought it to us.  First person took our food order and, well, you get the picture.  Our burgers finally arrived and they were way past well done and burnt.  ""Charred"" is one thing, burnt is another.  Our server zoomed past us at the speed of light, twice, to ask how the food was...but couldn't be bothered enough to wait for a response.  When she finally came back, to give us the check, we were told ""Oh, they won't cook any lower than medium well"". That's fine and dandy if that is their policy....BUT, tell me that when I order and I will make my own decision on that dish OR have the opportunity to order something else. I understand that TGIF is about fun, music, sports, etc. but maybe, just maybe, had they not been blaring music so loud that you cannot hear the person sitting across from you, dancing around, hugging each other and making balloon animals (yes, balloon animals!) -- you may be able to effectively provide decent service to your customers. Also, side note to the girl with the clipboard at the door:  You may think that your blue laser ring is ""cute"", but when it is periodically blinding people while you dance around to the music...not so cute. Don't even get me started on the parking lot!!  Let's just say ""ill conceived, tiny, and a little paint with arrows or lines would make it so that you have less accidents there"". (There were several while we were there). So, bottom line, if you have a hankering for T. G. I.

Mimi took her sweet fucking time getting the sauce for my wings. Even stopping to have a conversation with one of her coworkers after I asked for it. The side conversations she was having was obviously more important than bringing me what I asked for so I could enjoy my food. I also ordered the Long Island iced tea which they had a special on. However, that HARDLY had any liquor in it. All that would've been fine though had Mimi been coming back to our table to ask how the food and drinks were once she brought everything out.

I took the glass to the bar in hopes of quickly getting him some water. The bartender was chatting it up with some pretty ladies, too busy to tend to anyone else. There was another man pouring wine with another guy on the other side of the bar, I said ""excuse me sir"" like 4 times before he finally turned around to say ""I hear you ma'am I'll be with you in a minute"". I told him it was an emergency I needed water my husband had food go down the wrong way. He then grabbed a glass and ran water from the sink.  We never heard back from the the waiter we asked for water or our waitress,until she was ready to bring the check.

We each ordered a burger.  The menu stated that their buns are made fresh.  Pffft!  Like when?  Because our buns were like 3-days old.  Freshness had left the house!   We only ate like half of our burger.  The fries were the only thing that disappeared in my mouth. I ordered a refill of my drink.  This time, the shaker barely gave me 2 full drinks.   Speaking of drinks, our waiter was not consistent in coming by our table or refilling our drinks.  The place was so slow she stayed in the kitchen.  She only came to our table to take our order, to bring our drinks, to bring our food, and to bring the check.  Like, come out and do your rounds!  We had no ketchup.  My husband had to go to the bar to get salt and pepper. Nah.  We left disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville?start=20
B D.,"Temple Hills, MD",2,46,40,5.0,10/8/2016,"I have to say I was PLEASANTLY SURPRISED with both the service and quality of food received! I must admit that I ordered Take Out Online but when I arrived, my food was ready according to schedule and I had a pleasant interaction with the woman at the Take Out Area. When I got home I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of my food, everything was in the bag, and tasted amazing! I patronized the location on a Friday night. It was busy and, of course, loud but during my short wait, management appeared to be actively engaged in ensuring all orders were prepared properly and getting out in a timely fashion. Even though it was busy, a young man made sure he opened the door during my arrival and my departure. The only downside is that I was charged $0.50 for extra Jack Daniel sauce.  Maybe next time I will dine in....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville?start=20

Mind you I don't go to a place one time and write a review. I live a few miles from the restaurant and went about 3 times the most. Two out of three times I received extremely bad service. The waitresses have attitudes and had the nerve to get upset when I reminded them of my orders.  So I told myself why don't I just try to call in for takeouts. Those experiences were just as bad. I got hung up on numerous times, after being placed on hold.

One time my party tried to pay separately, and he told us that he couldn't split the check...but today he was somehow able to do that? Today my friend got the ribeye and was extremely disappointed when her ""ribeye"" came out. It was all fat, with hardly any edible meat. When this was brought up to the manager he asked, ""Oh? It's too fatty for you?"" Another friend of mine recieved onions and peppers on his order when he asked for them to not be there. He also brought this up and when his food was taken back, a waitress came out and asked, ""Are you allergic to onions or peppers?"" We all had a terrible experience and do not plan on ever returning.

I later discovered while I was in the restaurant that my phone was effected by the spill. I couldn't hear my phone calls anymore. When I told the manager, they handled it in a way as if I was lying about the situation. The manager Toni Baker told the other manager to say to me that it was nothing else they could do for me. Though they comped the bill,my 700$ phone is defected and I can barely hear on it.

Angel C.,"Washington, DC",67,3,,1.0,5/6/2016,Came in today to celebrate my aunts birthday. They gave us a newer server for a party of about 15. His name was Tyreek. As we were getting our food someone broke a glass. The glass stayed on the floor with four plus servers passing out food for 20-30 minutes. My mother being a server pulled Tyreek to the side and spoke with him letting him know that alot of ppl are done with their food and he should pre bus and pick up the glass. He picked it up with one hand and passed food with the other. You all may want to consider a safety training. They then got the so called manager Tony involved. He brushed it off and said he would see about doing something about the check. (Nothing major)  Once it was time to get the check that was going to be split Tyreek split the bill for us and never gave us a total bill. Now at this point ppl are giving cash left and right and leaving out the door. My mother and myself were the last to pay the bill. Once I was about to leave Tyreek told me that two entrees weren't paid for. My cousin went in because now the cops are at our vechiles. He ended up paying 141. Thats a big jump from two entrees. Plus a 20 tip. The cop said well the servers do mess up a lot here can you have everyone come back. So now ppl are coming back to tell them they paid. Tyreek was unsure about who paid what. He was very unorginazed. Tony had an attitude the entire time and very short with us. He didn't want to speak to any of the ladies. Only wanted to speak to my male cousin. Thats not cool. While all this is going on a 5 inch spider falls from the celling at another party and they kill it with a menu. Tony doesnt have ppl skills and you may want to reconsider his position there. I work for the Clydes Restaurant Group and we would never treat guess like that ask them to come back show receipts and only give 37 back out of 141. Thats what bad debt is for. The fact that they gave 37 lets you know Tyreek doesn't know who paid what. We had children yet glass is still on the floor. I live in Hyattsville and its well after midnight and I am just now getting my one year old in the house. This isn't the first BAD experience  here but this one takes the cake. You dont have to do anything but just know that what you are running on Silver Hill Rd is a degrace to the restaurant business. Never again hopefully I didnt eat baby spiders in my pasta.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville?start=60

Mercedes D.,"Washington, DC",2,18,12,1.0,1/15/2015,Came in on a Thursday night with my boyfriend. Football game was on everything was fine until we had to wait sooooo long for our drinks and even longer for our food. There were 2 heavyweight white girls who looked like they just rolled out of bed without washing their hind pots at the bar and ONE waitress on the floor for the bar tables. The drinks were horrible and I almost puked after witnessing one of the bartenders sneeze in her hand and wipe her nose with the same hand and continued to make drinks. I immediately sent my drink back and hightailed it out of there. So disgusting. I will never return again!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville?start=60

James P.,"Washington, DC",0,1,,2.0,9/13/2014,"After first going here 4 weeks ago with my woman who rarely goes out, I wanted a place I deemed safe. The hosts didn't seem to friendly but that was no big deal being greeted with a straight face. We ordered the stake dinners medium well and was served well done.. Hungary we ate them yet asked to speak with management. We were told that the cooks weren't to good at rare or medium well. We were also told because of the type of people in the area most people don't order medium well. Hmmm that's a bit strange yet again we were just to Hungary to send them back.....  The second time I went we sat and waited 10 min in a empty bar and wasn't greeted once...I thought that strange and we decided to go to Applebee's instead.....  The third time after sitting at the bar I was treated as if not there and after paying for the meal we tipped a $20 tip on a $40 plus dollar lunch and didn't even get so much as a grin......  The bottom line, server needs help.. Beer a little high a bit over 5 bucks and again services wasn't great...  Some of the staff are friendly but over all dry, high priced for the area and food is ok nothing great... Did stress our concerns to management...  Not a place I'd take my woman but a place for a beer or two... Well for us anyway !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville?start=60
Tisha S.,"Capitol Heights, MD",538,341,214,1.0,2/24/2015,"So we came here after my Bedroom Kandi party as we were starving! I arrived 1st at about 640 and was told after i told in front of the ""hostess"" for a few mins and watch him take others reservations before mine that the wait for 7 people was 40 to 60 mins. I said ok. He said he couldn't start the clock till 4 people get here...Normally they won't seat you till at least half are here. He said it with such a attitude i began to get annoyed. I sat down to wait and 4 of the party showed up. I went back to the ""hostess"" and told him that he could start the clock as we have 5 folks here. he gave me a kinda dismissive look and said ok. MInd you this is at 645. We didn't get seated till about 750pm after three of us went up there to ask what was going on. He stepped out once to call for a party and we got his attention and asked him how long the wait for Spencer is. He said ""I told you it was 45 to 60 mins"" We said, no we asked how long is the wait now. He looked at his ""clock"" and you have 39 mins"" with an attitude. At this point everyone was pissed with how he was talking to us. I watched as he told others how long the wait time was and when they walked out he had a look of disgust like ""we don't need your service anyway"". It took going up there, walking around seeing 4 booths open, talking to managers, and talking to him. he even tried to get into an argument with one of our party. This hostess needs to be fired. he had a Queen attitude and the head flipping and the way he spoke to people like he was better than folks is unwanted. He needs to understand he is the 1st thing that customers see when they come in. So after getting seated in the Bar (which the hostess didn't want to seat us there either, he kept acting like he didn't want to seat us at all. We had to tell him we didn't mind the two tables. He also said that you can't just sit in the bar area unless its the seats at the bar not surrounding the bar. MInd you after sat within about 15 mins another couple sat next to us without a hostess and later told the employee that told them the reason they weren't getting served was because they had to be seated, they told him, they were told they could sit there by someone up front.), we waited on the waitress. Her name was RaRa. it was very clear she was busy not only taking orders but also making all the drinks. She ordered my chips and salsa as i am a rewards member before taking a single drink or food order. It came out 30 mins later after another person's appetizer that was order 10 mins after the chips, and asking another manager for chips. This manager in a red shirt started bringing out our drinks about 10 mins after we ordered and all we asked for was water and two sodas. why was he bringing a glass here and there, maybe two glasses. the bar was two steps away. when we kept telling him we missing drinks, as he was acting like that was it each time, he responded ""they are coming, they coming"". Well after sitting for so long, we was getting upset and thirsty not to forget starving. so both appetizers came out, an we didn't have napkins, forks or anything. So i went tot he hostess stand to get some silverware and the the ""hostess"" was like ""uh huh, no ma'am you can't just come up here and take stuff"" I said, ""well we have been sitting over there for almost 45 mins and we haven't been giving anything"" He was like ""well you need to ask first"". I said I shouldn't have had to ask as they should have came with us when we were sat down. Mind you he did not even follow me or anything to bring us silverware. I went to the bar to our waitress and asked for some. When we got them they were all dirty and water stained. so we asked for plastic instead.  It was 8 o'clock before we received our main meals. At this point we had already begun to talk to a different manager, Rasheem (i think that how you spell it). he sat down and listened to everything we had to say and wasn't pleased. Especially since he is the hostess manager. As i was talking about the ""hostess"" he kept looking at me and making comments. I told the manager if i see him keep giving me side eyes glances we going to have a problem.  While we were talking Rara came up and told the manager to check our food as it didn't look right. So when it came out all the burgers were overcooked, one was missing onions, one had the sauce on the burger when requested on the side, fries were cold and one pasta wasn't even made with the cajun seasoning and wasn't a real alfredo sauce. oh yeah they were all reheated in the microwave. I didn't even eat my burger just the bacon. I had also order a drink to come with my food, never came, and we never got refills of waters or 2nd rounds of stuff.   In the end we had all our food comped, and asked to come back this friday on the hostess manager. I tend not to even come to this one as there tends to be a lot of kids/teenagers doing what",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-forestville?start=60

Hope L.,"Fort Washington, MD",494,284,847,4.0,7/11/2013,"OK so let's admit it. Yes, TGIF is a chain of restaurants but the quality of the food and the service can be a little hit or miss depending on location. So i stroll into this spot at basically the last minute. They closed at midnight I got there a little after 11pm. I had just finished chilling with my friends and needed a little something, something on my stomach before hitting the road to go home. I was starving like Marvin so I ordered a little of everything lol so here's the list; Seared Tuni Appetizer - oddly enough it was topped with a little guacomole and jalepeno pepper. I dont know what it was about that combination but it was pretty darn yummy and worth getting again. Meatballs Appetizer - oh these are just simply delicious! I get them every time I go to Fridays. They drench it in this yummy goodness marinara sauce with Parmesan cheese *drooling as I type* Mac N Cheese Bites - Appetizer - Aaaahhh one word AWESOME!! Fried perfectly on the outside, bite into a perfectly seasoned and cheesy mac and cheese - couldn't get any better than this!  Steak and Ribs Main Meal - The ribs were fall off tender and very tasty. I am VERY PICKY about my steak. I ordered it Medium and it was almost cooked well done. When I order medium I expect to see a little pink. Off the note the steak was ok.  Ultimate Margarita with Sugar Rim - good drink  Customer service was good. Our waiter was ok. Overall I would go here again.

I sat at the bar and the bartenders (with the exception of the gentleman) act as if it's a privilege to be served by them. No thanks! These bartenders feel entitled to treat their guests like this because they think they're better than those they serve. They need a reality check. I think this is becoming more prevalent because people in this neighborhood accept anything and they believe the ""(you know what) is right"" ideology. But hey, give somebody good happy hour specials (the reason for 2 stars and not one) and all is forgiven, including haughty service. Nope, I'm not a saint so I don't have to forgive!
