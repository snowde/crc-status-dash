JD H.,"Natick, MA",0,32,14,4.0,12/12/2017,"If you want to eat dinner at 10 pm in the metro-west, your options are limited.  TGI Fridays is the one place you can always count on to be open. There's never a wait at that time and we usually get a terrific wait person. The Manager, ""M"" really makes an effort to make sure you enjoy your meal.   No one rushes you to leave, which means conversation can continue. There's something for everyone in your party - good burgers, decent steaks and tasty appetizers.  It is a chain restaurant and it's not a foodie paradise, but it offers good food at reasonable prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham
Maggie P.,"Washington, DC",30,98,44,5.0,12/7/2017,"I was in the mood for junk chain food and cheap beer (don't judge) and TGI Fridays was the closest place around that fit the bill. We got there at 9:30 on Wednesday night, just as trivia was wrapping up. The place was nearly dead other than at the bar which is where Beau + big sis and I also sat. Bartender was GREAT! Super friendly, attentive even while extremely busy, and generally on point. Food was exxxxactly what I wanted and then some. *Pro tip: they have unwritten late night $5 appetizer specials - ask your bartender for specifics* $5 Pretzels were super hot, beer cheese that accompanied was amazing, and Beau couldn't get enough of the (also $5) spinach/cheese dip with freshly fried tortilla chips (impressive, Fridays!). My shrimp ""wrap"" on naan with balsamic tomatoes and tzatziki isn't your typical Fridays fare but the flavors melded wonderfully. Most impressive dish was Beau's cobb -- insanely fresh veggies and loaded with all the goodies restaurants usually skimp on (y'know: avocado, bacon strips, Bleu cheese). It was beautiful. Enough salad to easily feed two.  Bottom line: this Fridays did the chain proud! Kudos to the kitchen and the lovely bartender.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham

For starters, we walk in and no hostess for almost 5 min. The floors are sticky, except where they're slippery. My husband ordered a blue moon. No head whatsoever. Then he tasted it, and it is gross, tastes like dirty lines.  I asked for blue cheese and ranch for the wings for my daughter and I, alas, only blue cheese was brought out. The food was fine, we got an appetizer platter, my husband's burger was cooked as he asked. But a restaurant is more that just food.

Jamie was very friendly, helpful, and quick, and made my experience to this Friday's great. As did it being super clean, and having a brand new renovation..... Much more attractive than the old, old design used at my local TGI Fridays in Dedham. Lauren the manager is also amazing! Since there wasn't a survey on the receipt she offered to send me an equivalent coupon! That is what I call great customer service.  Food is delicious and the menu always has new items, while they always have some of my favorites constantly.  My suggestion is the classic cheeseburger. They are so flavorful, filling and delectable! I order them almost every time I go to Friday's, since they are just so good.  Definitely look forward to going back.  Highly suggested Friday's, don't let Olive Garden, Joe's, or any other dirty old joint fool you, THIS is the best place in Framingham, heck, maybe the best restaurant in the entire area!!

Bacon wrapped stuffed jalapenos were on the main menu, but they're no longer served. We ordered one of each app listed on the special menu which consisted of two flavors of boneless wings, potato skins, flatbread, fried pickles, meatballs and fried dumplings.  The first round went pretty quick, so we ordered a second round which is half sized apps.  A third round was ordered and that was enough. The meatballs, fried pickles and flatbread orders were tasty. The boneless wings had too much breading, potato skins were empty calories and fatty.  Our waitperson was young and attempted to address our needs.

Let me start from the beginning I ordered online went to the store to pick it up host was pleasant. I got home hungry and ready to full my tummy. I Got home out the boxes and notice my traditional wings were boneless. My Jake Daniel ribs smell fishy and taste like fish. So I called to request my order be replace. I was put on hold, I decided to drive over there while I was put on hold it took me 10 minutes to get there. which is about the same amount of time it took someone to answer my called. They agreed to fix my order no apologies,nothing. Stupid me did not look in the bag again before taking it home. I got open the bag and my traditional chicken wings was fine from what I can see but I was given a quarter of the ribs and it appeared it was eating with two dry bones in the bucket.

The place seemed a little disorganized upon entering. I asked for a booth. There was some discussion about where to seat us,but it was worked out and we were seated.  A few sodas an draft beer were served  very quickly,which we appreciated,since we were thirsty. I noticed the the specialty drinks menu had no prices on it and asked the waiter about it. He acted surprised ,and said he could ask somebody the price once I decided which cocktail I wanted.Why go to the effort to produce the slick attractive cocktail menu and then not include any prices? No cocktails for us.  The skins appetizer came out quickly.They were hot and tasty.We enjoyed them but wished for a bit more sour cream. The teeny cup that comes with them is not nearly enough for the big generous amount of skins.  The ribs were good,tender and hot, .My daughter had buffalo fingers. She ate them all but named two or three places where they are better. The french fries were okay but we all agreed they were not hot.

We had no previous knowledge of that. Would have just ordered one and saved myself $3. When my jack Daniel's chicken sandwich came out it was cold and disgusting. Tasted AWFUL. Fries were cold.  Our third round of Buffalo wings were cold also.  Worst experience. Never coming back here or any other TGI Fridays.

This particular waiter ( who served me many times) always have me a problem.  I would always order ""half rack of jack Daniels ribs with mash & fries"" she then told me I cannot order half rack ribs and that there will be an up charge for mash.

Lindsay Q.,"Rindge, NH",0,3,,1.0,2/25/2017,"I used to love Fridays, but this particular location had some of the worst service I've experienced in a while. My friend and I were there at 12:30 for lunch with our kids - one 11 year old and two 6 year olds. The six year olds ordered the kids meal chicken tenders. These were the only two meals done correctly. The 11 year old wanted an entree portion of the pasta on their menu, but with butter and Parmesan rather than marinara. After placing our order in the kitchen, our waitress came back, clearly agitated, saying, ""My manager treats me like such crap. He's asking if I'm just making up my own menu because of the pasta order."" This goes on and on. When it comes out, it's a kid sized portion with no cheese. They ended up putting another order in and that took 40 minutes for it to hit the table. My friend and I ordered two of the endless apps - potstickers and the BBQ flatbread. We only got one round of it. After the waitress put in for the next fill, it was 45 minutes and nothing came out. We ended up asking for our check. The waitress kept saying about how the manager treats her so unfairly....how she's quitting after her shift....I felt bad. I truly did. After we got the bill, it turns out that she put $10 of her own cash on our bill to take care of one of the apps! We asked to speak to the manager. He came over and while we were explaining our disappointment in the kitchen service and the turn around, he was looking at the 6 year olds, making faces, and laughing. Until they get someone who can manage a restaurant and respect his/her employees, I would avoid this Friday's...unless you can spare 2.5 hours for a mediocre lunch, that is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham?start=20
Dave M.,"Wayland, MA",8,1,,2.0,6/21/2014,"This visit was just kind of strange. We were feeling a little snacky before finishing up some shopping, so around 2pm we stopped in for some food and a drink. It was a very slow time for the restaurant, yet it was exceedingly cluttered with food and dishes at tables where the customers had long ago left; one large table in particular had still not been cleaned the entire time of our visit. The most concerning part was that there were a lot of people working at the time! A dirty, cluttered environment does not make for a very good first impression. From there, it was just a matter of the service, and the food. Our meal was decent: good prices for the items we got, and tasty, but the service was.. not great. Our waiter seemed to be having a wonderful time serving the table next to ours, but to us he was quite forgetful, slow, and made no effort to really be anything more than an obstacle in between us and our food/ beverages. When we had our beverages and were waiting to place our order, he simply walked up to our table and pulled out his pen and paper without saying a word.  I had meant to make this a shorter review, so I'll wrap it up.

We went there in May of 08 and the service, the food, the lack of return-contact after we tried to get the bad, bad, BAD situation rectified after the visit... everything was terrible. The place was not all that busy and they brought us ALL of the wrong items somehow, and it was all cold, the waiters were rude... the whole experience sent me home in agony from all of the stress and tension. We did try giving them a 2nd chance a few months later, and it was just a huge waste of money because it was more of the same.

Greta K.,"Worcester, MA",210,400,79,3.0,5/25/2009,"Let's say I have a secret shame, and that shame is that I actually like TGI Friday's and have eaten at their restaurants possibly over fifty times in my entire life.  This may sound sad to you, but I know it could be worse.   My friend wanted to order a salad on Saturday before we embarked on our shopping journey in Natick and she suggested Friday's.  This location was typical and all the old favorites were on the menu.  I love the Jack Daniel's entrees and EVERY appetizer they carry, but I was trying to restrain myself, so I ordered the Sante Fe chopped salad with no tortilla strips and honey cilantro lime dressing on the side.  My friend ordered the strawberry fields salad with chicken, which is very good.  I felt my salad was a bit mediocre and had a ton of iceberg lettuce in it, rather than toppings.  I was a little disappointed, considering the $7.50 price, but when we received the bill, the salad was only $5.00!  That was great.  So, even though Friday's food can be sub-par, you can usually get a really good price for it.   P.S. I didn't order them, but I was very happy that they feature a cupcake dish on the menu.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham?start=80

I used to consider TGI Friday's worthy of my five stars!  This was 3 years ago.  I forgot what I used to order, but whatever it was, it did the job every single time without any exception what so ever.  Flash forward three years.  What I normally got is no longer available due to the latest updates on their menu, and everything else just makes me sick.  This is like going to see a hot girl you haven't seen in years, only to discover now that she's gotten really chunky and unattractive over the years! Bad metaphor.  But on a negative not, the appetizers suck.  I don't like their nachos.  They're more like half a taco slathered in cheese, with sour cream and salsa on the side.  It's depressing, and you'll actually have to mathematically split the nachos with the table.  In the old days, there was a basket of tortilla chips, and the fastest eater and the one that skillfully picked the largest tortilla chips got the most.  I guess go with their potato skins which Friday's is known for, but I'm not a fan of that. And the entrees are just awful.  I've had to come here twice recently.  I ordered their steak twice.  For starters, the steak has its own ""unique sauce"" that you are basically obliged to pick (choice of four).  I've had the wild mushroom and the Argentinian rub, and I must say, I've never missed A1 so much in my whole life!  These had to be some of the worst steaks I've ever shoved down my gullet!  For an entree, stick with the Jack Daniels burger if you go.  It's probably the only real decent meal to get. For shame, Friday's.  Thank god it's Friday, now I can go spend my weekend eve at a real spot like Chili's or Ruby Tuesdays!  Yeah, that's right: Ruby Tuesdays, on a Friday!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham?start=80

We didn't see our bartender again until my husband put cash in the cup, showing we were ready to check out. Not one word from bartender. I was mad at my husband for leaving a 20 percent tip on what the full price of the meal would have been (apps are half price on Sundays)? We will never go back.

Nothing spectacular, but reasonable.  Well the TGI Friday's at Shopper's World in Framingham is anything but decent and far from reasonable. They have a serious problem with their staff's attitude and it shows both in their food and service.  A couple of months ago was the first time I went to this particular establishment. We were seated after a 10 minute wait, then the waitress passed us 4 times in 15 minutes without even acknowledging us. That was enough for me to get up and leave.  So the other night we gave this place a second chance. It was horrific. We waited 30 minutes for a table for 2, even though plenty of seats were available. The hostess was inattentive and more concerned with talking to her friends then seating people. When our waitress finally arrived she was as inattentive as the hostess and had a really nasty attitude. The food runner had a massive messy hair cut and a goat-tee that was nearly touching my food. The salads were horrible, huge chunks of cucumber, the bread crumbs were literally crumbs, the bottom half was floating in a blue cheese dressing that tasted like mayonnaise. My burger was supposed to be medium well. The bacon was almost raw, the cheese wasn't melted, the burger was illegally rare, the french fries were ice cold and covered in salt.  It was really the worst restaurant experience I've ever had and I eat out at least twice a week. The hostess and wait staff were completely unwelcoming and the food was the worst I've ever been served.

Charlotte H.,"Natick, MA",96,14,,1.0,12/14/2015,"It used to be great, but our last visit will probably be our last. On November 27, 2014, my son requested Fridays for his birthday dinner. The initial portion of the meal was more irritating than awful. Our waiter seemed very new, so we gave the benefit of the doubt on a few things, including our service being slow and our son's order being forgotten (never received an explanation of why his food came out much later, but it was clear the kitchen never made it, whether he didn't put it in or they didn't make it). I also had to speak to the manager and wait over 15 minutes for a drink because I was declared too young looking for my ID and they didn't have an operational ID scanner to confirm. The manager explained the concern about underage drinkers and college being out better than my server, who stated something about secondary ID, didn't explain what would suffice as secondary ID, and left the table.  The BAD part came when my son with multiple food allergies wanted dessert. Now Fridays started this for us years ago on their suggestion, since he can't have the Cup of Dirt dessert but can have the gummy worms they put on top, they usually bring him a plate of worms and sing to him. There has been some turnover, so the waitstaff we knew are gone. I asked the waiter nicely to do the same, and explained you can still sing to a kid with a plate of worms, even though there's no cake or candle. Plate of worms comes out, plunked on table, the end. Wouldn't have been so upsetting to my son or to me except that the little girl next to him was sung to, and he's nine. I have been trying to explain ever since why they would leave him out. I wrote to corporate on the 28th and they said I would receive a call from a GM or manager from the location, and as of 12/13/15 there was zero call, so here I am taking it public.

Our waitress was (to be kind) a little distracted. Though there weren't many full tables, she still forgot to bring our water, check on our table, or wipe the stray hair from our plated appetizer *gag*. I ordered the Cream of Broccoli Soup - which was surprisingly scrumptious, and our Fried Green Beans appetizer (the one sans stray hair garnish) was super yummy with Wasabi dipping sauce!

What we like:   (Remember, this is a chain restaurant) Good variety of food, apps & drinks. I can find anything I'm in the mood for - chicken, beef, fish - salads, sandwiches, entrees. Prices are affordable and pretty ok for what you get. Plenty of parking. Not so busy as to wait for a table or barstool (double edged sword though) What we didn't like: We like to eat at the bar and watch TV, and wanted to choose some drinks from the cocktail & specials menus. BUT - I really hate that there are no prices on the menu, which makes it hard to choose a drink. The bartender explained that ""some of these are around 8 or nine dollars.  The tequilas are more, maybe 10-12. ""  I want to know for sure, not ABOUT how much, since that could be most of our bill.  grrrr.  The specials menu, not available, they had little binders behind the bar but no longer available. huh? Drinks come with no straws, then you pick one from a bunch located on the bar top, that aren't wrapped, that kind of grossed me out. Children are allowed in the bar, and some were sitting right behind us at the long divider table. I just don't feel that's appropriate, and it made it kind of uncomfortable for me. They belong in the restaurant, not listening to me curse at sports! Apps came out fast and hot, but our food followed much too soon, so we had to juggle plates and rush through the apps. It was pretty obviously annoying, but we had plenty of room at the bar to take up the 2 spots on either side with our plates. Jack Daniels burger was ok, cooked medium as requested, but the bacon was one piece way overdone burnt, one piece almost raw-limp. Bun soaked through and hard to eat. Very small amount of fries. All in all, probably won't go again unless friends want to go, but no one ever suggests it. There are so many better places in the immediate area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham?start=40

Scott S.,"Waltham, MA",0,14,,1.0,7/2/2015,We definitely won't be back. We went on a Sunday night. The staff was friendly but the food was terrible!  My kids ordered the pasta with marinara sauce. It was mushy and looked like it had been been sitting around absorbing the sauce and then reheated. I ordered the turkey club. The pickle slices were put on top of the bread with toothpicks which made the bread soggy. The avocado was brownish in spots. The side salad was very small but otherwise ok. My husband ordered the chicken sandwich. It was greasy. The French fries were way too salty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham?start=40

Stephanie M.,"Medford, MA",27,149,60,1.0,5/1/2011,"After having a terrible experience at the Natick Mall, my friends and I decided to skip out on any food court/mall centered meal and head over to TGI Fridays. Figuring, hey, its got to be pretty standard, nothing too extraordinary but nothing too terrible, right? Completely wrong.  We got a booth on the bar side. There weren't too many people there and we were hoping to get served quickly.  The waitress came to take our drink orders, then asked if we knew what we wanted to order. We gave her a blank stare and she realized we didn't even have menus. That right there should have been the first signal.  I ordered the southwestern iceberg wedge, my one friend ordered the cobb salad while the other ordered shrimp and brocculi. Simple and healthy, mostly because we also ordered the appetizer sampler and figured we'd pig out on that, but not feel guilty and have some healthy options. Whatever gets us through the day, really.  My wedge came out first. Followed, 20 minutes later by the drinks we ordered. Then another 5 minutes by the cobb salad and the shrimp/broc. Mid way through eating, we realize we never got the appetizers. After we specifically requested them first.  We made mention to the waitress and she blamed it on the kitchen. 5 minutes later another girl comes out to tell us that it was never put in, that shes training our waitress, and she'd comp the appetizers for us. Ok, fine, just give us our food so we can eat and leave.  We get the appetizers, not what we ordered, we eat it anyways.  Check comes, nothing was comped. We had to fight to just get noticed again to get that taken care of.  Overall, it turned into well over an hour of an absolute shitshow. Not once did anyone apologize for such a perfect display of terrible customer service and attention to detail. The food wasn't even good enough to have put up with such a headache.  Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham?start=60
Tyler D.,"Auburn, MA",42,5,,2.0,3/8/2015,"After driving from Auburn to Natick for the sole reason of going to the Cheesecake Factory, I was ready to eat. However, the wait for the Cheesecake Factory (55-75 minutes) was so long, that my girlfriend and I decided to just buy some cheesecake and find somewhere else to eat dinner. For some reason however, everyone in the greater Boston area decided to go out to eat that night so it was impossible to find a place that had a wait less than a half an hour. Although it's true that we could have just went somewhere and waited, it seemed easier to drive aimlessly around looking for somewhere that could spare the room to quickly feed two hungry souls (the mind works in mysterious ways when you're food deprived). After driving down route 9 for what seemed like an eternity (about 10 minutes) a beacon of hope glimmered in the distance; a beacon of hope in the form of a Tgi Friday's sign. However, I like to eat food that's fresh and doesn't make me have to poop, so we kept driving. But eventually my girlfriend and I succumbed to the hunger and pulled into Tgi Friday's. We walked inside and were greeted with a 5 minute wait. The service was good and the waiter, Josh, was pretty good. He also looked like a celebrity but we couldn't figure out who and it will probably drive me crazy for many years to come. When the food finally came out, I was surprised. It tasted pretty good for food that was fresh out of the freezer. I was actually surprised at how not terrible the experience was. The bathrooms were a complete mess and there were poop stains in the toilets, but it's Tgi Friday's so honestly what do you expect (I also had s gift card so everything was free and I like free stuff). After we left and the night continued on, I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to run to the bathroom. But this morning came and I got what Was coming to me. Rip to my toilet. Overall summary, it's a Tgi Friday's that has pretty good service and ok food that won't make you have to poop right away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham?start=60

Meg N.,"Waltham, MA",14,14,,1.0,2/11/2013,"After the blizzard of 2013 the staff will play! My roommate and I went to this Fridays Sunday 2/10 around 6pm after the blizzard. We were seated by a decent host in the resturaunt section. We first sat around for about 20 minutes before even meeting a server of any kind. Our server Stacey checked the hostess booth finally to realize they we were seated in her section. She came up and seemed attentive after the whole ""I didn't know who was serving you guys"" mishap. By the time we had met Stacey we had our drinks, appetizers and meals all ready to order. So we ordered our entire meal right away, asking for our appetizers and wedge salads out first. The food came out in a decent time frame, although at this time a mother and daughter were seated after us and they ended up getting there meals and left before we even got our meals. Stacey took awhile getting back to our table it always seemed like she was busy and unavailable. I continued to give her the benefit of the doubt until our dessert came. My roommate got the brownie obsession and halfway through eating it pulled out a long brown hair. now my roommate has brown hair so she thought it was hers and let it slide until after we finished our dessert and noticed our lovely waitress Stacey standing in the KITCHEN playing with her hair while the food was being prepped. My roommate watched this waitress close to 20 minutes while she played and brushed her hair in the kitchen chit chatting it up with other waitresses while we waited over 20 minutes for our dessert to be taken away and our check to be given to us. In the additional 15 minutes it took for her to take our check and payment, we witnessed the hostesses and waitresses in front of the resturaunt slapping each others asses. GREAT professionalism ladies. I still left Stacey a 12$ tip on a 57$ bill because my roommate so nicely put it ""some people have bad days, like a bad hair day!"" With my 12$ Stacey, invest in a hairbrush so you don't track your hair in others food! Will be contacting a manager today as well and I WILL not be returning! customer service and fooling around on the job is one thing but hygiene and santitation is a completely other thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham?start=60

Alex H.,"Milton, MA",12,38,26,1.0,5/13/2010,"The WORST place I have EVER eaten in my ENTIRE life. THE WORST. 1. Horrible bar staff (Only care about you if you are a regular there) 2. Horrible wait staff (Constantly waiting for food and service) 3. High turnover kitchen staff with inexperienced cooks. 4. A menu where 90% of the meals have chicken in them. Chicken is the worst thing they serve. It's like their filler. When they don't know what to put in something, just add chicken. And the worst part is, it all tastes as if it were microwaved! And if it isn't, then they need to change chicken suppliers because that chicken is so processed that it makes me sick just thinking about it. 5. EVERYTIME I have come here, I have had a bad experience. I gave it a fair chance, but i will never return! First time I came here, I was meeting some people from work. I got there late, and just wanted an appetizer. I ordered the buffalo wings and a beer. I got my wings, cut into them, and the chicken was RAW! Only the breading on the outside was cooked. So I told the waiter ""this is raw I would like to swap these out for new ones"" The waiter was very apologetic and promptly took away the food and said she would take care of it. Or so I thought.... Waiter came back, and plopped THE SAME CHICKEN back on my table. The exact same chicken that was on my plate minutes ago. Only this time, cooked a slightly bit longer. The problem is that the outside was burnt and the inside was still slightly raw! I spoke to the manager and the manager was very apologetic and gave me 50 dollars in Friday's gift cards. I found this to be useless because I never eat at Friday's. So I was like ""ok whatever. Can I at least have a free basket of fries to go?"" Manager was like ""Sure!"" So he comes back with a basket of fries, I rush out of there because all my work buddies are leaving, and I take them to eat in my car. I get in my car, open it up to eat one, and they are ICE COLD!  ::shakes fist:: DAMN YOU FRIDAY'S!!! The next time that I had visited Friday's, they were doing some lame ass promotion where they rang a cowbell every 10 minutes, and had some stupid roulette wheel. Listen, this isn't Chucky Cheese. Can't a man have a beer in peace at the damn bar?? I eventually left out of aggravation. The final time I went there, I had worked late and wanted to grab some beers and watch the hockey game. During this time, I killed 6 beers. Now mind you, I had a full meal, and the beers were spaced out over a long period of time. But apparently, if you have around 5 beers or so, the bartenders start to ""'pretend they don't notice you"" as opposed to ""cutting you off"" It's the most bullshit move I have ever seen pulled in a bar. I wasn't close to being drunk, and I sure as hell didn't deserve to be treated like a child. Let me repeat, THE WORST place you could ever go for a drink or food. You are a masochist if you love this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham?start=60
Christopher C.,"Houston, TX",105,117,3,4.0,3/12/2011,"This TGI Friday's is really hit or miss depending on traffic, waiter, and menu. Over my four years in Massachusetts, I've been to this place with numerous parties. The service is always fast and warm. The food arrives within minutes. Up to that point, the experience is great. It's the first bite that decides it. 50/50, the burger is great or grossly overcooked.  Fortunately, when you express your concern to the waiters, they will do whatever possible to make the experience better. I've only complained twice out of twenty times. Each time, they replaced the burger or gave me a $10 coupon at the end. Basically, if you want an affordable meal that will provide you with a pleasant food coma for the rest of the night, TGI Friday will fill that quota/need/satisfaction/want/desire.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-framingham?start=60

Ben C.,"Manhattan, NY",219,19,,1.0,6/3/2010,"I am a person in need of good Karma, so I am about to do a very good deed for you - I am going to spare you from the suffering, the aggravation, and the horror placed on this earth by the devil himself, called T.G.I. Fridays.  I'm not a fan of Friday's to begin with, but let's focus on why this Friday's restaurant is particularly terrible: SERVICE IS HORRENDOUS!! Not only did our waitress never check in with us once during the meal, but she was also virtually impossible to find. If I felt like playing a game of ""Where's Waldo"" with the waitress I would have stayed home and just read a %@#$ing book.  We literally waited over 30 minutes just for her to walk by our table so we could remind her we had ordered deserts. Another 15 minutes passed with no desserts, so I actually went into the kitchen to find her - she had forgotten AGAIN!  Aside form the service, the food at this Friday's seems particularity awful. Its not just disappointing but actually very, VERY disgusting. The wings were burnt and dried out, the onion rings were soggy,  and the ribs were just fat and bone. I ordered the steak (if you can even call it steak), and WOW was I disappointed. It was dry and extremely tough, so much so that I actually had to spit out most bites after attempting to chew them. This made a disgusting mound of half-chewed fibrous meat on my plate. So much for impressing the girls I was with.  It is truly pathetic that this place gets any business. After being here once, why would anyone ever want to come back?!!?! Save yourself time and money and fry up a piece of dogshit and it'll probably be a more fulfilling meal.
