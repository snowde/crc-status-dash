Jen A.,"Alexandria, VA",114,6,1,1.0,12/31/2017,"Service was unbelievable and not in a good way! I can't believe how poor our service was! 30 minutes to get a drink,  45 to get an appetizer is rediculous. To top it off the bartender had the audacity to sit at the bar with her friends while I've not received my drink. Smh.

Danielle G.,"Fredericksburg, VA",43,96,16,3.0,5/5/2017,"TGI Fridays, especially this location, used to be the ""sure thing"" for Fburg dining in a hurry. You could *always* get seated immediately and get decent food. Unfortunately,  the past couple of times we've gone, we've had to wait a ridiculous amount of time,  the service was unacceptably slow, and the food wasn't good. The ""Endless Apps"" seems like a good deal, but all the appetizers we tried were greasy, flavorless and disappointing.

W B.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,24,,2.0,3/4/2017,"Family and I went here  Wednesday and had the endless apps. Potato skins were nice. The meatballs were watery and not much flavor. You can certainly tell they come frozen. Jack Daniels wings had nice flavor but we're cooked too long. The fried pickles were really good, cooked well. The pan seared pot stickers were not cooked very well the inside was chewy. And the last item we tried was BBQ chicken flatbread it was really delicious.

Renee L.,"Spotsylvania Courthouse, VA",23,13,,1.0,2/1/2017,"Awful experience.  The food was a resounding MEH, and worse, the waitress was extremely rude.  My husband was interested in the endless mozarella stick app, and when we asked about it, the first thing out of her mouth was, ""she can't have any!""  1. We knew that and 2. That was an incredibly rude and disrespectful way to say that!  Have a little tact.  There are way too many decent restaurants in the area to have to put up with that kind of behavior.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fredericksburg-2
Hailey N.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,6,,2.0,4/5/2017,"Went here a couple of days ago with the hubby and daughter. Had not been here in a couple of years due to the horrible food and service we got. I am happy about the 10 dollar appetizers, but wish they were made to share. at least look the other way because my child wanted to try some of mine and the waitress kept hovering near our table just to see if i shared with her!!!! Like really do you have nothing better to do! Shes a child  and kids like to eat whats on their parents plate. Yes the policy states that you cant share the apps which is ridiculous but the waitress is an asshole , but what made it worse was, she literally yelled out (you cant share your apps)) !!!! Also went back a couple of days later to the bar and it was 1 pm and bar had still not been set up yet. Horrible service and rude staff !!!

Stopped in (Wednesday) and sat at the bar. There were many customers, but it wasn't jam packed. Anyhow, poor Demetrius, the bartender, couldn't keep up very well. Service was slow, but very courteous. My Jack Daniels burger was pretty good. Nice bun. The bread for a burger is always very important. The sweet potato fries were okay. The Oreo dessert was just okay. Took way longer than I hoped it would so I could get right back on the road.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fredericksburg-2
Kerri E.,"Schofield Barracks, HI",3,44,17,4.0,9/20/2015,"I ordered the endless appetizers and everything was okay...I really wanted the spinach florentine but was informed they were out of it, I asked if anything was being offered in its place and was pretty rudely told no. (Not by our waiter). I also had a watermelon drink and it was very good. We were sat after about two minutes. The people sitting guests didn't seem to have a clue what was going on and a server sat us. Our server was absolutely wonderful!!!! One of the best I have ever had. He had my next order in and out before I had finished the first. Took off a star for the hostess and the fact they did not have  the sole thing I came for and were not offering anything in its place. FYI-- there is a a certain list of what you can order for the endless apps, it isn't any of their apps (which I was offered if there anything was being offered in its place) 1.  Cheese sticks- excellent, very large 2. Loaded potato skins- cheese and bacon served with a side of sour cream. More potato than anything. 3. Tostadas- neither me or my husband cared for these. 4. Bbq wings were nothing impressive. Probably not going to come back as there are so many other places around here to eat that I know will be awesome. Our amazing service was the highlight of the trip and the reason for four stars instead of two or three.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fredericksburg-2

Daniel C.,"Seaside, CA",0,6,1,1.0,5/7/2017,"Our fault, we should've looked at yelp before our visit. Before we could even walk through the double doors we had to wait for people to come through because the door on the right was locked. I'm pretty sure that's against some fire code. Then the host/hostess station...neither individual looked like they cared and one was leaning on the little podium like no one was gonna take it from him. They were a little chaotic in deciding where to seat our party of three and had to do a quick re-wipe of the table they chose. We sat there for about 7 minutes before the hostess that sat us came back to take our drink order. About 20 seconds after she left, our waitress came running up frazzled and asked us, ""did she just take your drink order?"" We said yes, she introduced herself then wanted to know what we ordered for drinks so she could input them into the little waiter tablet thing that wasn't working for her. It was comical to watch her swiping away back and forth with her card and it not work. She must have tried it thirty times before giving up and using a pen and a pad. We put in our order right then cause we had a feeling it was gonna be a rough dinner. Food came out about 15 mins later and right away I saw brown on the lettuce of my southern fried chicken sandwich. I opened it up, tore off half the leaf and saw that my three little pickle slices were stacked like poker chips. The kitchen has obviously zero attention to detail and management is not doing any QA. Wife ordered BBQ chicken salad and the chicken was raw in the center. Daughter ordered naked wings that came out fine so we were 1 for 3. There was no way we were sending anything back to that kitchen. Food tasted Meh. Waitress practically ignored us, not one refill, had to ask for silverware, she gave a look that made you felt bad for asking her for anything. Even noticed her glare at one of her co workers helping out one of her other tables.  Should've known better than to order dessert but we figured how could you mess that up, we were wrong. Could've made the dessert brownie in my microwave.  All in all it was one of the worst dining experiences we've ever had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fredericksburg-2
Alisa Olivia L.,"Queens, NY",198,111,57,4.0,1/24/2016,Food was good and the vibe was amazing! I came here in a group for my mothers graduation. We were accommodated without a reservation. The menu was typical Friday's but the service was great!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fredericksburg-2

Sam S.,"Stafford, VA",1,21,21,1.0,3/17/2017,"I am EXTREMELY disappointed with TGI Fridays!! The last couple of times I've gone to this location the food has been TERRIBLE! My most recent visit with my family (2 weeks ago) will most likely be our last! The bartender made a virgin strawberry daiquiri that was completely watered down (imagine a smoothie or juice that was frozen and thawed out and all of its consistency rises to the top of the glass! It was absolutely horrible! It was as though they let it sit in the glass for hours! A regular glass with no whipped cream or cute cocktail accessories.

Sarah S.,"Nazareth, PA",0,8,,1.0,1/17/2017,Went here today with my brother and my 18 month old at 1130 it was empty. First problem we were sat at a booth but then told that we couldn't have a high chair because it was a fire escape hazard.... soooo move us to where we can have a high chair obviously.... second the didn't have Bud Light..... not even bottled... they had three beers to offer and the waitress couldn't even remember what kind. So we left and as we left I saw they had a sign that said no guns.... so this is officially the most un-American place ever no bud light no guns!?!? Won't ever be back.

Michelle Lee H.,"Bayside, NY",162,39,45,1.0,4/3/2016,"I've been here twice in the last week, and today was the  nail in the coffin.  Last week the service was ok, my mother had to send her steak back twice. The steak came back mooing.  While I prefer it that way, my mother ordered it medium per the ""hot light pink center"" the menu suggested.  I tried to order one item only to find out they didn't have it.  I got the salmon Ceasars salad and the salmon was on point.  I decided that it was an overall ok experience. Today we went to celebrate my sister's birthday, only to be rudely greeted by the seating hostess.  She explained it would be an hour wait b/c we had a party of 8 and there were only 2 servers.  Two of the 8 were babies...so really a party of 6.  The restaurant was empty enough.  I get she may have been stress, but I truly can't believe how rude she was to my sister. She talked to her as if she was a child and was super disrespectful. Needless to say we didn't want spit in our food, so we opted out and rolled to Chili's where we are getting a 180 experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fredericksburg-2

I asked for a new roll of silverware. Again the knife some crusty yellow stuff on it. My girl gave her knife and it was nasty too. The server came back and I gave her the other two knives.

There were crowds ""hanging"" out in the parking lot (why on earth people would hang out in a parking lot is beyond me) and really uncomfortable to have to walk through.

The restaurant wasn't that crowded, probably because it was a sunday night - but service was fast. Stopped by with friends on our way back from a road trip. Two of us had the grilled chicken cobb salad, which had a balsamic glaze on the chicken. The avocado vinaigrette was delicious, though the salad was so flavorful it didn't even need the dressing.

James M.,"Fort Meade, MD",13,1,,1.0,3/23/2015,I normally don't write reviews but the long wait was just that bad. Granted we came in with a party of 34 for lunch today but there were only 5 other people in the restaurant with us. The appetizers took between 45 minutes to an hour to come out. As I'm writing this I realized that we have been sitting here for 1 hour and 45 minutes and my main meal just came out. If my presence wasn't required as a part of a work function I would have left a long time ago. Hopefully this establishment gets better but as of now I recommended that you pick another establishment in the area. The waiter Eian was nice but you can tell that he was new to waiting on a table this size. My burger wasn't hot but it wasn't cold either. My fries were cold to the touch. I should've sent them back but by this time I was completely done with this restaurant.

I ordered the sizzling chicken which was ok but the squash & spinach were so over cooked it was like eating baby food.I substituted the mozzarella salad for broccoli & it was so old it had a brown color all over the stems & tasted like dish water! Everybody else ordered the $12 appetizers & they kept getting the wrong ones & would have to wait even longer for the right ones.Mentioned this all to the waitress & she blamed it on having new cooks & the dirty silverware on the employees overloading the dishwasher.She told us they knew it was a problem but at the end of the night they have to wrap 60 silverware sets each & they are wrapping them dirty anyway WOW!

Bri W.,"Fredericksburg, VA",2,4,,1.0,6/25/2013,"My visit here tonight ranks in my top 3 worst experiences in a restaurant, possibly even #1. And that's not just because the bartender (Titus) sucked, but more so because the only thing the manager did was somehow *manage* to make things worse.  The bar was busy, so at first, my friend and I tried to be understanding of the fact that Titus was taking forever to greet us, would ask us what we wanted without stopping as he walked by (yah! For real!), and forgot to put in one of our appetizer orders (even though he made an excuse/lied saying ""they had to fry it"" when our other appetizer that was also fried came out at the expected time). Okay. But then when the bar nearly emptied, he was still ignoring us! But his tables with his regulars and/or friends got plenty of attention. The guy nearly spilled a drink off our table because he couldn't be bothered to stop for 2 seconds as he walked by. I had to grab it. He didnt even say sorry. Ugh! So my friend (who is also a bartender btw) grabbed the manager. This is where it went from ""bad"" to ""never coming here again."" Manager at first said the right things, 'I'll talk with him... He gets flustered when its busy and I just took over the bar and haven't had much time to work with him..."" Etc. ok. But then she saw someone she knew and just started chatting up w/that person, completely cutting off the conversation she was having with us. Rude. And then bartender, Titus, walks by, and she starts ""coaching"" him right in front of me and my friend. And her idea of fixing the problem, talking with her server, was to tell him to ""stop being mean to these ladies."" Right in front of us!! To make it even worse, he didn't even apologize but made excuses! ""What do you want me to do? I've got 10, 20, 30 tables!"" Really, guy? Really? Soooooo awkward. And my friend even said at this point the she was uncomfortable, and the manager tells her not to be and just keeps going. Neeeeever, in my years as a server or in the hundreds of times I've eaten at a restaurant, have I ever seen a manager correct one of his/her staff in front guests.  I've had crappy service at least twice before from this guy, but the manager being this incompetent was inexcusable. We should have turned around and left like we thought about doing when we saw who the bartender was. tl;dr, if you're out late in f'burg and want food and/or a drinks, go to Baileys. Under no circumstances go here. Bartender sucks, management sucks worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fredericksburg-2?start=40
Bailey Y.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,5,3,4.0,4/19/2014,We were at TGI fridays on a Saturday night and it was pretty crowded but didn't have a wait. Our waiter was good she was attentive and nice but not amazing. I got the chicken crusted parm and the chicken was great but I didn't really like the ravioli that came with it. We also got French dip sandwich that was really good (the horseradish sauce that came with it was amazing.) and the sizzling chicken and shrimp which was good but the pieces were small! I would come back I thought it was a pretty nice meal! ;),https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fredericksburg-2?start=40
Derrick M.,"Fredericksburg, VA",2,15,,1.0,1/15/2014,"Hate this location. Worst service. Took me 2 hours to get a salad. ""Sizzle plate"" came out ice cold with hard cheese that had cooled off for 20 minutes before the server brought the food out. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fredericksburg-2?start=40
Ryan M.,"Fredericksburg, VA",0,1,,1.0,12/25/2012,"I went here to have a Christmas dinner with my girlfriend. The experience was downright awful.  Our server could be categorized as above average in the service department, but unfortunately, that was the best thing about our visit. We started out with 2 waters, and the two for 15. I had the queso dip and a sirloin steak. She had shrimp pasta of some sort and pot stickers. After confirming that medium is a warm red center, I ordered my steak medium. It arrived literally half well done and half medium well. It was dry and extremely chewy. I was not impressed. The pasta came out with clumps of undone and/or dry, chewy noodles. It was inedible. After notifying the server, she took a second order for the sirloin steak. After mine arrived and was over cooked... my girlfriend purposely mentioned that my steak was overdone. We wanted a legitimate medium steak! After 15 minutes more her food arrived for the second time. After cutting into the steak, it was 100% well done. No pink at all. At this point we were getting irritated and decided we will get something to-go from elsewhere.  The manager said he would adjust our bill to compensate... but when it arrived, at 27 dollars and semod cents I felt completely ripped off.  I will never return to this restaurant in the future.... and I suggest avoiding it. Their kitchen staff is horrible and their grill cook cannot cook a steak to save his life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fredericksburg-2?start=40
Matthew Y.,"Fredericksburg, VA",8,25,3,2.0,2/24/2012,"My review system: I give 0-3 stars for food and 0-2 for experience (atmosphere, cleanliness, service, wait time etc.). My most recently visit to this TGIFridays was a monumental disappointment. Let's start with what truly sunk the experience: the service. From the time we ordered, it took a full fifty minutes to get our food; during which we saw our server for a refill ONCE. Completely unacceptable. The manager eventually realized that we had been waiting and offered his apology and tried to make things right. To his credit, he was very friendly and I appreciate him stepping up. 0 of 2 stars for service. Finally the manager brought us our food. I had my favorite dish, the sampler combo (buffalo wings, stuffed potato skins and fried mozerella with dipping sauses). My food was excellent. The wings were perfect with just the right amount of sauce, the skins were the perfect consistency; could have had a little more cheese, but otherwise very good. If it was just me, I would have given it all three stars for food. As it was, however, I was celebrating my birthday with my wife, father and step mother. My father enjoyed her food, but my step mother received the wrong dish, and my wife ordered a Steak cooked medium, which came out a extremely rare - dark red in the center. The manager quickly took it back (at this point he was personally taking care of us. Like I said, our waiter did an awful job, but the manager did everything I'd expect from a good GM), but when it came back it was now over-cooked and dry. My wife ate it without saying anything further because at that point we'd been there for over an hour and she was starving and just wanted to leave. 2 of 3 stars for food. Bottom line: I've had some really good experiences with this place, and despite this visit, I'll eat there again. But this particular visit was simply awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fredericksburg-2?start=40
Noel R.,"Bluffton, SC",20,41,4,1.0,8/22/2011,"Horrid. I did not expect excellence nor very good but I did expect edible. Unfortunately for me, I didn't get any of those things. What I did get was nostril flare from the horrid mildewy smell and a rash from where I had to peel my arm off the sticky table. Oh yeah, the service was equally bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fredericksburg-2?start=40
Mark B.,"Richmond, VA",0,12,7,3.0,6/29/2009,"Food was good. Atmosphere wasn't bad. But the air was on and, the place was ice cold. A request to turn the air down was of no affect.

Che' J.,"Washington, DC",0,1,,1.0,1/17/2012,Bad service and poor management!!!! After driving a long distance from Washington dc I decided to stop in for a night of drinks and a little chit chatting...first off we were seated right away but our waiting didn't greet my table for the first 10 minuets on a slow Monday night! Drinks were ordered and we specifically asked for a mango drink and it comes back and it's terrible what bartender mixes milk with acohol? 45 minuets Into waiting after placing our orders another group is seated waited on and are served their food... My fiance ordered boneless buffalo wings and I ordered sizzling chicken entree.. The wings were cold and my food wasn't sizzling and i had a glob of american cheese just thrown on the side and was cold and not melted.. I asked my server he said it was nothing that could be done... So I asked for the manager CHRIS WAS HIS NAME his comment wasn't that he could fix the problem but their not allowed to server patrons sizzling items bc they pop on u... Out of every experience at any TGIFRIDAYS I go to I order this meal and I get what I'm paying for and that's a sizzling entree! This was the worst experience in my life and I'll never return to this Fridays again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fredericksburg-2?start=40

Theresa S.,"Stafford, VA",1,4,,1.0,3/11/2014,"Our first time coming to this TGIF. This was the worst experience that we had and that was even before we sat down. We went around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. The place was not even crowded. There was a family of 3 waiting to be seated, a gentleman and then my family. The family was seated after a few moments. The man was asked how many people was in his party. He told the hostess and then sat down to wait to be seated. I waited at the hostess counter while my family sat down. I stood there for a few minutes until two ladies came inside. The hostess then welcomed them and preceded to ask how many were in their group. I informed the hostess that we were ahead of them. The hostess had the nerve to tell me that she was not taking names or counts for seating right now. Then why would you ask the man in line before me and then ask the ladies that came in after me how many people are in their party? Needless to say, I told my family to leave and went to Olive Garden down the street. Olive Garden gave us the greeting, seated us quickly and the excellent service! We will never go the this TGIF again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-fredericksburg-2?start=40
