Kevin S.,"Plano, TX",28,825,2,3.0,7/8/2010,"Waiting for a friend to arrive before we headed over to the ballpark for some Roughriders Baseball....decided to stop here. No problem parking, and no wait at 6:30 pm. Ordered the Cajun Shrimp and Chicken Pasta.  As well as a diet coke. Service was good, waiter thought he was auditioning for us....pseudo rapper?  I wasn't impressed.  Sorta looked like Mark Wahlberg....sorta. Anyways, the food was good, prices were ok.  An all around good experience.  Not great, just good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frisco
Phil G.,"McKinney, TX",14,5,64,1.0,8/21/2010,Burnt bun.  Request to bring a new bun as opposed to taking the fries away was not communicated from the waitperson to the manager.  Manager apologized for sub-standard quality and had it remade but it  seemed that making table visits like this were a pretty common exercise for him.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frisco
J.R. A.,"Gatesville, TX",151,53,29,3.0,12/29/2009,"As my wife and I were in the mood for a little ""Friday night"" on a Tuesday so we went to TGI Fridays for dinner. The staff was very friendly and colorful. Now, we did sit in the bar and you know how bartenders like to have fun. Our food was very good and a good value too, drinks and all, $30.00. Good job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frisco
Kerry O.,"Frisco, TX",158,395,155,3.0,7/16/2009,We always head this way when we can't agree.  They have this $10 dinner menu and I have to say the flat iron steak is pretty good. The pork chop is a little thin and so it is pretty dried out so I would stay away from that.  My daughter and her friend made a meal of two appetizers. Probably not the healthiest way to eat but it was only for that night. It is really hard to find a place in the area that has a selection of salads that you can make a meal from so when it is really hot out and we have a craving for a big salad this is where we go.  The wait staff could be better. You can always find them chatting up a storm instead of working their areas but that is management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frisco
Theresa C.,"Frisco, TX",1,26,,1.0,7/9/2009,"What has happened to TGI Friday's?  The food is awful, the service slow, the menu offerings are just terrible.....TGI's used to be sooooo good - we'd take the kids there, there used to be a great selection and the food was good.  Now, it is bad and a little expensive.  So sorry, I wont be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-frisco
