Brithany G.,"Dallas, TX",9,58,113,1.0,3/20/2016,"Came at 12:17AM for a quick bite and drink. Doors locked with servers inside. The sign on the door clearly has their hours and states last call, however, we were there well before the times. Very unfortunate that I saw the servers and they didn't even acknowledge us. No sign stating problems or why closing so early. Maybe need to update the hours? This would be the second time we try this location and first time was not great. Servers yelling at each other and very uncomfortable to sit at the bar and waiting 10 minutes to be greeted.  Very sad about TGIF as I was a frequent customer when we lived in Dallas and deff use their app and rewards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ft-worth?start=20
Dena H.,"Bedford, VA",49,1,,5.0,5/25/2017,Had a great time hanging out with my daughter at the bar. Keith took very good care of us with signature drinks and some good food. The manager came by to check on us. The other staff seemed to be having a good night at well.

Autumn H.,"Azle, TX",143,131,75,1.0,11/15/2015,"Usually love this place, today not so much. We were seated and 15 minutes later no one had even taken our drink order. We watched several of the wait staff walk by.... nada. When we walked out we told the hostesses.... all they could say is ""sorry bout that."" Not even a, hey let me find a waiter for you.  And judging from all the other reviewers who have had the same problem, i think it is safe to say this location is in some major need of new management.  I will never be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ft-worth?start=20

Carolyn J.,"Burleson, TX",0,1,,5.0,9/15/2016,"We can't say enough good things about our hometown TGI Friday's!

Jennifer Y.,"Sulphur Springs, TX",84,76,69,4.0,10/11/2015,"I'd never been to Friday's before as we don't have any in Hawaii. My assumption was that it would be as good as any other chain restaurant and my overall experience was satisfactory.  We were seated immediately and our waitress came to take our drink order fairly quickly. The strawberry passion tea was delicious. Pot stickers were ordered and they were fried perfectly-- They tasted better than my expectations. We ordered the 6 ounce petite sirloin steak, the classic cheeseburger, and the California club sandwich. The sandwich and burger were both good. The steak, however, was a little dry. I requested medium-rare and the steak arrived nearly medium-well and it had lost all its moisture due to sitting on the grill for too long. The taste itself was fine but I wouldn't order it again. Our waitress Tiffani was nice and although she seemed inexperienced because she couldn't answer our questions right away, she returned to our table with answers in a timely fashion.  Overall a fine experience from a mediocre chain restaurant but it's what I had expected. I appreciated the service more than the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ft-worth?start=20
Jennifer S.,"Sparks, NV",70,198,15,4.0,7/28/2015,I haven't been to TGI Fridays since the moved out of my hometown.  This one is just every bit as good as I remember it being!   My son and I came for a late lunch.  I ordered a BLT and he got a steak.  We also ordered the endless pot stickers. The food did not take long to come out and it was wonderful.  The pot stickers were great and we actually ended up getting six orders! The waitress was very nice and polite.  The only odd point during the meal was when the Manager brought our last order of pot stickers and told us that once he had a guy eat 25 pot stickers and then run to the bathroom to vomit.  Who says something like that to customers?  I don't know if he was serious and just didn't realize how gross and inappropriate that was or if he was trying to get us to stop ordering food.  Either way I'm knocking the review down one cause of him. I'd go back and tell the guy to hush it the second he approached my table.  I'm hip to his game now.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ft-worth?start=20
Jay C.,"Burleson, TX",51,2,,5.0,7/20/2016,Heath was the bartender and was very helpful and knowledgeable on the new menus. The new lettuce wraps and bugers were very good. I believe these new burgers are better especially the buns.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ft-worth?start=20
Brenda S.,"Glen Rose, TX",31,5,,2.0,5/17/2016,"Not going back. Third time we've been there. Service was great! I dont mind the prices, I mind when they over price mediocre food.

Mindy C.,"Fort Worth, TX",155,344,68,4.0,8/3/2014,"BEST vanilla bean cheesecake you can buy! Literally, I have tried cheesecake from so many places and this can't be topped.

Tara U.,"Crowley, TX",2,15,6,4.0,9/24/2014,I was impressed that my husband could sit and have a conversation with out saying what every other word. The music was at a nice level. My hamburger and my almost two year olds chicken very good. They gave a nice portion of fruit for her side. I'm giving 4 stars bc my husband was not impressed with the all American stack hamburger.

Paige D.,"Fort Worth, TX",49,142,16,3.0,4/30/2014,"The decor is very eclectic, I love it! They use lots of movie posters/memorabilia/current events props as their decor.  We came for an early Monday dinner so it was fairly empty. We are seated right away and the waitress was very attentive. I had the TGIF's grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and fries and my nephew had the kids meal chicken tenders. Everything came out fairly quickly and tasted good.  Nothing spectacular about the menu but it is fairly priced and the food is good. It's a good place to gather with friends or a cheap date. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ft-worth?start=20
Cody G.,"Kress, TX",53,21,15,4.0,8/27/2015,"Definitely a great TGI Fridays. I don't have many to compare it against, but this is a good restaurant regardless.

Theresa M.,"Fort Worth, TX",11,60,,4.0,9/5/2017,"I have been to this location many, many times and I must say the staff is great. They are always friendly and helpful. The main reason I go is the customer service and the strawberry fields salad! I would say the cocktails can be hit or miss depending on who is bartending but the food is usually very good. You can always depend on the ice cold beer! I enjoy the atmosphere, especially the music and décor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ft-worth

Pat K.,"Alvarado, TX",0,14,,1.0,1/9/2018,"Ok, I wasn't going to do a bad review, but have received no satisfaction from their corporate offices. So. Last Friday,  we decided to go here for the $12.99 ribs. Ok, you ask, what do you expect for $13.99. Better than what I got, that's for certain. When my Memphis style ribs came to the table, I could not cut them with my steak knife. They were thoroughly tough and inedible. Called the waitress over and she said they would ""cook them"" some more. Ok. Manager brought my ""recooked"" ribs back to the table and trotted off. Again, could not cut into them. Waitress came over. I explained the problem again. She said nothing. So, I took them home thinking I could throw them in the oven. Ha. Wrong. Still tough. My dogs ate good that night. No lie. Angry, yeah very!!! Never darken their doorstep again. Gag.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ft-worth
Allison K.,"Fort Worth, TX",22,72,256,5.0,5/10/2017,"This visit gets 5 stars. If I could give it 10, I would. I haven't been here in almost five years. Decided to give it another try and could not be more happy that I did. We started with the pretzels and queso and my tastebuds did a happy dance with every bite. They were lightly crisp on the outside and hot and fluffy inside - the queso dip came loaded with bacon and tomatoes and was a perfect accompaniment. I could've stopped there, but ordered the sizzling cheesy chicken skillet. Equally yummy. The sweet potatoes that came with it were maybe the best I've ever had. Seriously. The hub ordered the wingman buffalo burger. If you like buffalo wings, you will love this burger! Nicely seasoned and slightly spicy and very juicy. Everything we ordered was fresh, piping hot and perfectly cooked. Kudos to the kitchen staff!!  The staff was amazing as well. Our waitress was very friendly, and got our food out to us quick enough that the food burned my tongue. Perfect!! Shout out to the GM Robin for making sure our dining experience was everything it should be. Overall just a perfect experience!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ft-worth

Seated by some guy who walked in right behind us; dressed in blue jeans, shirt and hunting boots like he had just gotten back into town and wasn't supposed to work.  We had the Cobb salad with chicken and green goddess dressing. Chicken was fresh grilled which was surprising. The salad itself had crisp veggies. Service was really slow for refills and extra dressing took a while.

Our server, Trisha, was the sweetest and made sure my 2 children (under 4) received their food before me and my husband. Plus she made sure to ask if the food was the right temperature for them. (it was perfect)  I got the Million Dollar Cobb Salad and my husband got the Endless Appetizers. She was knowledgeable and helpful with the menu and our drinks were always full.  Seriously... I've been a server before and was very impressed with how attentive she was, even with a full section.  The manager was also very nice and professional.

The happy hour specials are definitely worth my time and attention, I mean $3 martinis on a Wednesday night after 6pm, how could one resist? Please don't sleep on TGI Fridays happy hour specials they are blowing any competition out of the water these deals. I also had the Jack Daniels wings, six bone in pieces for $5 and a side of seasoned fries for $2, WOWSERS! Let's not forget about my dessert, the Tennessee Whiskey Cake, it was super moist and delish!

Neither.  My husband ordered a beer and I ordered a water. She asked if I was sure I didn't want a beer too. I said yes. She asked what appetizers we would be ordering. We ordered one. She asked if we wanted to try the endless appetizer special they have going on right now? We said no. (that would have been $10/a person). She came back to our table and asked if we would be having the Jack Daniel's steaks. No. We ordered what we wanted. When we were about 1/2 done with our food she returned and asked if we would be eating the brownie or oreo dessert. No.  I understand upselling will increase her tip but OMG go away. 1 attempt per table is plenty. Before I was done with my meal I was annoyed with her. She might as well have simply asked us to give her money. That is what it felt like. We felt very uncomfortable.

You could tell the waiter had let the order just set there after it was cooked. They were not cooked med. The Manager came out and all he could say was I will cook you another one. We  said NO so he deducted one of the burgers. You could tell he did not care and the waiter did not care. Plus, they only had 3 table of people so it was not because they were busy.

Michael M.,"Burleson, TX",7,32,26,4.0,2/11/2013,"This is probably one of the nicest locations I have been.  Extremely friendly and energetic staff, management is actually involved in your experience!  I have been here many times with the family, just the wife and by myself.  Every time has been enjoyable.  The food is very well prepared, even custom ordering is handled without problem.  The SINGLE time an order came out a little off... it was immediately returned and replaced with the spot on order.  I am a rewards member (I suggest that for everyone) and rewards do have advantages.  Will and have returned and have recommended this place to everyone of my friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-ft-worth?start=40
