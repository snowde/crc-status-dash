Monica G.,"Glendale, AZ",31,11,4,3.0,12/29/2010,"The last time I went to TGI Friday's was about five years ago and it was great!  I went yesterday with my fiancée, his brother, sister and mom and I can definitely say...I've had better! I ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich and the first thing I noticed is that the chicken was extremely dry. If there is one thing I dislike it's dry chicken. I got past the fact that it was dry, but still wasn't very satisfied. The one thing that really got me mad was that my soon to be mother in-law ordered the pecan salmon and they were out. Now we were there at around 2pm ""lunch time"". Having worked in many kitchens, the one thing that's key is that you never want to run out of a featured item let alone at lunch time. Saying this..... it also means they will be out for dinner as well. She did choose another item off the menu but waited ten minutes after everyone else had already gotten their food.  Other than that the service was on par. The atmosphere was nice and the company was even better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear
Taylor M.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",30,20,4,1.0,5/24/2013,"This place is terrible.  Ordered two draft beers.. the sat at the bar for five minutes befor our server ever got around to bringing them to our table.  Ordered queso dip and chips, as well as flat bread.  All cold.  Our first clue this place was crappy was the hugh rip in the booth seat. ( and the huge rip in the booth seat in the next booth as well) This place is bacically a waffle house that serves beer.  Dont waste you time.  Walk across the street to Chili's and you'll feel like you've up graded to a 5 star restaurant compaired to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear
Jay M.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,4,2,2.0,1/14/2013,"We loved this place a few years ago, but great food is on the menu but exiting the kitchen. Both of us here and I eat alone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear
Tony K.,"Pleasant Hill, CA",4,288,224,5.0,1/16/2010,Our server Eddie is a Sharks fan so how can this be a bad meal.   We flew in for game and the sharks beat the Coyotes..... The food was great and they open till midnight.  Good times.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear
Caroline D.,"Surprise, AZ",20,78,38,4.0,10/26/2012,"This was the first time I had ever been to a T.G.I Friday's and it was excellent. The queso appetizer left something to be desired and could use a little more seasoning, My Jack Daniels burger was AMAZING it was juicy and fresh and just all around awesome especially with the sweet potato fries. Our server was awesome as well. Will definitely be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear
Ahmee J.,"Phoenix, AZ",28,9,,1.0,5/29/2012,Came here for dinner after not visiting this restaurant for all most over a year and now I know why I haven't . They ran out of ribs so I order the 10oz steak and it taste burnt and it was very tough! I didn't even finish half the steak ! The happy hour specials are great but there dinner entires  are horrible ! Also the men's restroom was a mess trash over flowing with dirty paper towels and the floor was covered in urine ! Probably won't be visiting T.G.I Friday's anytime soon!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear
Matt W.,"Goodyear, AZ",415,144,34,3.0,9/4/2011,"Went here due to the mailer we received for BOGO. We ordered the Jack Daniels ribs, steak and shrimp, and wings to start us off. The food was good and the service was acceptable. Nothing really stood out as excellent, and I don't see us returning anytime soon. I would agree with Scott that the service is at times ""lacking"", but we didn't choke on any steak so I think somewhere between 2-3 stars is right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear
Carlie W.,"Litchfield Park, AZ",131,44,124,1.0,10/7/2012,"I ordered two ribeye steaks, med-rare, baked potatoes.  The steaks were not rare, they were raw. The potatoes were not even cooked, hard as a rock. One potato was the size of a lemon, the other was a huge baker. The manager was not apologetic and flip, and advised we were free to drive back down to the restaurant to have it re-cooked. We had ordered it to go, so driving back to the restaurant I've miles at eight pm, didn't sound like a great plan.  The attitude from Jason the manager just added insult to injury.  The dessert and salad were great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear
Stephanie S.,"Mohave, AZ",35,28,3,1.0,7/16/2012,"The best part of the meal was our server, she was friendly and attentive.  The food was pathetic.  Ordered potato skins and each one had a few crumbs of bacon and a pinch of cheese, about the size of a quarter on each.   My  friend ordered the spinach dip and it was good, but I was still disappointed looking at my potato skins sitting there so lonely and naked...Sat near the window, big mistake, it was so hot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear
Joshua S.,"Las Vegas, NV",151,2,1,5.0,5/30/2010,"Having eaten at this restaurant twice this month I can say the food is absolutely delicious.  I had the Jack Daniel's Chicken both times and it contains two succulent boneless chicken breasts lathered in a flavorful Jack Daniel's marinade, with a side of the marinade for dipping, and two side dishes of your choice.  Service was great, keeping my iced tea filled consistently, and the cost for five people was totally reasonable. Great service, affordable prices, and always delicious food, why not choose T.G.I. Friday's?  If you do, you won't regret it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear
B P.,"Goodyear, AZ",0,6,3,2.0,3/24/2012,"After a late flight in, my wife and I wanted to get a quick bite and a drink before going home. We had 3 choices. Chili's was crowded, Applebee's was packed, so we went to Fridays that was not crowded at all. I now know why. Food took over 30 minutes, for 2 appetizers, TV's were playing the local news with no sound or CC (might as well had muted C-SPAN on), and all anyone working there wanted to do was closing clean up, even though they had 2 1/2 more hours to go till closing. Food was ok, service was sub-par. Needless to say we will not be going there again, unless there are no other options. Still would probably just go home hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear
Kelly A.,"Glendale, AZ",15,20,,1.0,8/30/2010,"went to this location a few months ago with the hubby and kiddos,when we walked in the hostess snubbed us since we came in an hour before closing Im guessing! But anyways I gave this place 1 star because I couldnt give it 0, My husband ordered a steak and it was so full of gristle, fat and nerves that on his second bite he started to choke,I totally freaked out and he tried to drink some water and it couldnt go down his throat so he threw it up all over his plate and food,now the steak slipped down a bit so he could breath but it was still lodged there so he was in alot of pain and he kept trowing up.anyways the waitresses were just standing around watching the whole time and after the worst was over they came over and were like are you ok? to my husband.....no im not ok and i need to go to the hospital! the waitress was like ok and she actually went and got our CHECK! like are you kidding me? we just got our food and took a few bites and my hubby chokes on the food you served him and now you want us to pay for it before we rush to the hospital? so the hubby and kids went to the car and I was so mad I just paid and ran out...no manager no nothing. got hubbs to the er and they had to give him some shot to let the steak pass through this throat...you could actually see the lump in his throat! needless to say we wrote a letter to the corporate office and what did they do? oh they sent us a letter saying sorry! will never go here again.......EVER!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-goodyear
