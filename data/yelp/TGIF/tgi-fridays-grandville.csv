Meghan M.,"Jenison, Jenison, MI",0,1,,2.0,1/4/2018,"I have worked in the mall for years and I've always enjoyed coming to Fridays for dinner with co-workers and such. My go-to meal is always the Chicken Crusted Parmesan.  I was sooo upset! They changed all of it! The biggest disappointment was the mac-n-cheese they served with it. It used to be penne pasta noodles with a white type of cheese with the parmesan crumbles on it. Now it is this awfully thick yellow mac-n-cheese that tastes like KFC and with no parmesan crumbles! Terrible! I went there with my fiance because I didn't want fast food. Well it tasted like fast food!  They even changed the chicken. They added this weird marinade to it that was a little spicier than normal. The tomato mozzarella salad that came with it was also different. The mozzarella balls were melted and there were too many tomatoes compared to the mozzarella balls.  It was not appetizing at all and I wanted a refund. They changed my favorite meal that was already delicious into something that I will never get again! So disappointed.  Not to mention I had to ask for new silverware because the set they gave me had food stuck to it! The next set was a tad cleaner, but still not clean enough to my liking. Disgusting! What the dish used to look like:  What it basically looks like now:  CHANGE IT BACK!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Farouk B.,"Grand Rapids, MI",15,42,10,1.0,10/16/2017,"One wonders which aspect of my dining was terrorized most.  My palate?  My wallet? My self respect?  Each were taken for a ride as the train of horror did not stop until the bill was signed and I fled from the lot. Being out of tortilla chips should have been the canary in the coal mine, but we ordered the pot stickers.  Montgomery, dismayed by the side options, requested broccoli instead.  In a rendition of an orphanage's ration, the entree dual sides were 3-4 pieces of flavorless broccoli.  What was that Arctic shredding sensation in my mouth? Ah yes, a frozen cucumber.  The cucumber on the entree salad was served up fresh from the industrial freezer burn factory from which it had been stored a mere months to years before my meal. But where were the pot stickers? Brought out in the midst of eating our entrees was the appetizer. Does timing and order matter?  Does it matter if I put my underwear on after my trousers, or put them on after work instead of before? Apparently not. The reason given for the appetizers late appearance? It reportedly had to THAW.  I wish I was merely joking.  One imagines the back kitchen a long lonely stairwell down to a subzero dungeon that even Father Winter would not dare enter. The waitress, though somewhat clueless, was nice and not to be faulted for the gastroblizzard. Friday's has historically been one of my favorite B&G chains, which is like saying Evan Williams is my favorite low shelf whiskey.  Suffice to say I may not be returning soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Anne D.,"San Francisco, CA",122,3,3,1.0,12/20/2017,"Hadn't been to a Fridays probably since middle school and a friend & I wanted a quick bite while at the mall. It was a slow tuesday and the hostess took 10 minutes to seat us because she was scrambling around doing something of the other. It took an additional 10 minutes for our waitress to mosy over and ask us what we wanted for drinks. She forgot our ranch with our appetizer, took 5 minutes to go get the ranch & our entrees were mediocre. Not to mention, i'm pretty sure I have food poisoning as I threw up last night & my stomach is still churning today. Quite the experience and now I remember why I haven't been there in 6 years",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Hilary R.,"Zeeland, MI",27,8,5,1.0,12/7/2017,Well I used to enjoy this restaurant but after a double charge mishap from November that they still haven't rectified I'm not a fan anymore.  My husband has called daily and either gets the run around or promises of a return calls that never happen. They definitely have a management problem over there. But if you enjoy paying double or dealing with incompetence then by all means dine there.  On a plus note the food is decent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Mike W.,"Traverse City, MI",2,23,1,1.0,7/7/2017,"The worst service you can possibly imagine. Ordered endless apps and it took 20mins between apps.  Ended up leaving hungry. A TOTAL ripoff!

Randy W.,"Jenison, MI",2,1,,1.0,10/30/2017,The WORST service in town. Don't waste your time with this restaurant.  You will sit there for an hour and never get your food. When you ask for a manager.  She will bring out what was suppose to be your food. But that will be wrong as well. This is the second time I have had terrible service. I've learn my lesson and I will never return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Rick S.,"Holland, MI",0,3,4,1.0,4/9/2017,"Visited for dinner and what an embarrassment this franchise has become. The food is below sub-par and I would have given the place zero stars. The people that said customer service is horrible are spot on. Waitress barely smiled, didn't check to see if food was OK after bringing it out....you get the picture.  I ordered the new fish and chips on the menu and what a joke. For the price you think you would get something better looking than Vandenkamp's grocery store looking fish fillets. Really disappointed! Girlfriend and her son ordered burgers but was told all they had was white cheese but when we ordered the potato wedges from the endless apps.....the cheese was yellow? Huh? The fried pickles from endless apps is a joke.....not wedges but something smaller than baby dills. Just really Disappointed and we won't be back.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Alison E.,"Grandville, MI",8,1,,1.0,11/6/2017,"This place is the WORST!!! We arrived at about 6:30 on a Monday night hoping to have a drink and an app before our 7:30 movie. The server took about 15 min to greet us. We ordered 4 draft beers and 2 apps at that time. At 7:00 our beers had not yet arrived. A few min later our food arrived but still no beers and not even water to drink. The green bean fries were burnt. The garlic parm wings were decent. Finally, at about 7:10 ( 25 min after ordering) our beers were brought out. Thank god we didn't order mixed drinks!! We had to chug our beers to get to our movie on time. There was a table near us where the customers actually had to go up to the bar to get their own drinks because they were sick of watching them sit there and not be delivered. It was terrible service, no one was friendly, and it wasn't even busy. I will never go back to this place, even if I'm already at the mall shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Andrew B.,"Byron Center, MI",0,3,,4.0,11/10/2017,"Got dinner here because I had to pick something up at the mall and had the kids, so thought it would be an inexpensive dinner. The server was great, although the rate at which the food came out was rather slow (took 30 minutes for a kids chicken finger basket). Food overall was excellent. The fried chicken the wife and kid got was mostly chicken and not a lot of batter. I got the ribs. Wow! Literally fall off the bone. I typically only post on Yelp if a place has really good food. I'm posting, so there ya go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Robbyn T.,"Phoenix, AZ",7,20,,1.0,3/23/2017,It'd be zero stars if that was allowed. Not only was I served raw chicken but they still tried to charge me for it! Ummm no. I complained about the chicken and declined a new piece of chicken and anything else bc at this point I'm disgusted. When I mentioned after receiving the bill that I didn't feel I should pay for that they only then took off a percentage of that dish. Wtf?! Charged me for the sides of my dish bc that part was edible. Like are you joking?! You must be right?! NOPE. I will NEVER come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Greg G.,"Jenison, Georgetown Township, MI",9,1,,1.0,4/19/2017,"Went for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. Service was awful, waiter was nonexistent. I will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Christen N.,"Wyoming, MI",0,6,,2.0,9/14/2016,"The one and only time I've ever had food poisoning was from this establishment. Steer clear of their shrimp.  Service is hit or miss. I have had really friendly, competent servers, and I've had some...not so.  I once ordered a 6 oz sirloin medium rare and it came to me butterflied (like, why?) and well done. When I spoke to the manager about it, her comment was that it's nearly impossible to cook a 6 oz cut of steak to that specific temperature. Unbeknownst to her, I was employed at a local steakhouse at that time and our kitchen was capable of selling perfect medium rare 6 oz filets and sirloins. So her explanation seemed a bit ridiculous to me.  Overall, a sad chain restaurant that has fallen in service and food quality in recent years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Ternce H.,"Washington, DC",202,4,1,2.0,2/4/2017,"This Friday's left quite an impression on me. However when my two guests entered we were greeted by a full host area and two hosts that seemed overwhelmed. Fighting through the chaos we found seats for three at the bar, the gentleman behind the bar greeted us with an eager smile, he let us know about the four dollar long islands which we had a round of. I saw not fault in this first round of drinks we ordered two jack Daniels glazed boneless wing and mozzarella sticks. We'd waiting for what felt like 20 min and when the food came out it was cold and one order of the wings had a hair in it. Our issue was resolved  by a manager, My second round of drinks were very slip shod, not very well put together. I was displeased by the quality of this visit and a more focused implementation on guest experience and customer service would suffice in making future visits successful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Kelley G.,"Grand Rapids, MI",1,8,2,1.0,8/1/2016,"Saturday 5 PM with a 6 and 7 year old- plan was to have an early dinner. Waited in line 15 minutes to get seated even though we were 3rd in line. Finally seated and the restaurant is about 40% full. Immediately placed drinks and appetizer order. Kids are very hungry. Waited and waited and waited- 30 minutes later we asked server about our appetizer. She went to go check while we waited and waited and waited. Checked watch- Seated for 50 minutes, restaurant is now at maybe 65% capacity. No waitress to be found, no food, no appetizer. No sign of any management. No option other than to simply walk out. Never again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Jenifer B.,"Grandville, MI",21,95,30,1.0,7/2/2015,Made the mistake of trying this place again. Ten minutes for drink. My daughter got a slush that was missing all its slush - basically syrup with some ice. Twenty minutes for the appetizer. This place is not crowded so I can't blame that for the slow service. My daughter - who could see the back of the restaurant - said all the waitresses are standing around talking.  I'm going with the two strikes and you're out instead of three. Update: Took forty minutes for our entrees. My daughter and I both felt sick after eating just half our food. I ended up with wicked GI issues - avoid the chicken salad sandwich for your own sake unless you want to lose weight quickly. My daughter made me pinkie promise we'd never eat there again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Mercedes D.,"Hamilton, MI",44,18,,5.0,12/7/2016,Went there for lunch after Christmas shopping and the food was good.  The waitress was really friendly.  The appetizers was really fantastic.  The cocktail that I had to drink was good but expensive.  Still a great service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Vicki K.,"Towson, MD",2,59,,3.0,7/14/2015,"We had a fantastic waitress yesterday for our server.  She recommended a couple of lunch options.  When our sandwiches arrived we could not believe how big they were for the 1/2 combo! Upon taking our first bites we knew something was wrong.  Our waitress continued to ask in the kitchen why the club sandwich was so spicy.  We finally found out our sandwiches had been cross contaminated by jalapeño peppers she finally brought us ice cream to cool down our mouths and stomach.  Beware if you have allergies, you may want to mention this to your waiter.  They did take care of us and not charge us for something we could not eat.   I was sick the rest of the day.  It maybe awhile before I come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Kayleigh W.,"Stow, OH",0,9,7,2.0,2/26/2017,"This was an interesting visit. We went in knowing full aware of having bad service, so that didn't a disappointment.  We did call ahead seating online and when we walked in, the hostesses seemed really panicked. After we were sat, I personally thought our waitresses was rude to begin with. She didn't smile or anything. I'm not saying waitresses have to smile and look pretty, but I work in a restaurant so I personally know the standards of at least being polite to your costumes. She mixed up my coke and root beer, but that's a common mistake. But instead of bringing me a coke, she brought me a diet, when I asked for regular. Not that big of a deal, but she told me I was wrong. I wasn't but okay. 4/5 people got the endless apps in my party. I got a burger. I don't remember if i forgot to tell her what cheese I wanted or she just made something up but I got a white cheese and I don't like white cheese on my burgers. Wasn't going to argue it though. It was a pretty juicy burger and I was happy with it. After our food was dropped off and my party wanted to order more apps, she seemed to have disappeared for at least 20 minutes and avoided our table. This happened every time they got their apps. We didn't giving up though and just waited. We were there for over 2 and a half hours!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Scott K.,"Saranac, MI",13,8,,5.0,2/20/2016,"Just finished lunch at Fridays in Rivertown Mall in Grandville, I had the Michigan Apple Salad with Chicken. Very good, portion size was perfect.  My daughter had the chicken tenders and an ice cream sundae.  She enjoyed both very much. The best part was the service by Ryleigh, she was extremely attentive and paid extra attention to my daughter.  Very happy and would come back and ask her for again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Lauren H.,"Hudsonville, MI",29,5,,1.0,12/26/2015,"Friday's is really going down the crapper. This particular location suffers from terrible customer service especially. It gets worse every time I go there, (once a year now...maybe) and there's no improvement, just new faces. I had a gift card so I figured I'd just use it, knowing full well what I was walking into, but hopeful it didn't still suck. Alas, exactly what I expected. Sat at the bar, ordered drinks, zero attention paid, drinks took forever...at the bar. Wanted to order food but waited for one of the three bartenders standing around, gossiping with each other, to ask if we wanted food, as if the closed and stacked menus were not enough of an indicator. Food was good, rarely disappoints, unlike the raging disappointment of the customer service. Wanted to order a dessert, waited 20 minutes until one of the bartenders noticed I was out of water. To top off the bad service, the dessert comes out, sadly, disappointed by the measly size of brownie and scoop of ice cream. My water never did get filled.  To top it off, one of the girls instructed the dishwasher kid to stack wet dishes on top of a rack of dry dishes they should have put away instead of stand around and chit chat. Gross. That's food safety 101 btw...every food service worker should know you don't stack wet dishes on top of dry dishes, clean or not. Because bacteria. Maybe I'm harsh, but I enjoy eating out. I don't have super high expectations and am a good tipper. I'm not a difficult guest either. But seriously, this Friday's service sucks. Bad.  In terms of Friday's as a chain goes, they have a menu not worthy of the prices, the portions are getting smaller, quality is going down, it's basically thawed and fried food. Overpriced food paired with terrible customer service...I do believe it's time we break up for good TGIFRiday's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville
Katie B.,"Grandville, MI",0,1,,1.0,11/22/2015,Been here 3 times within the last year. 1st experience was fine  2nd sat at the bar for 10 minutes without even being approached so got up and left. Talk about rude. 3rd sat at bar took about 20 minutes for drinks and about a hour for our food. Felt like I was gonna throw up on our way out of the mall. Got home and got sick right away.

Kayla D.,"Grand Rapids, MI",20,130,5,1.0,10/1/2013,"Eugh, I've had so much better.  I'm actually severely disappointed  in this one. When my family goes down to Cedar Point, we usually go to TGI out there once during the trip. It's great down there, so we figured it should be good back home too. And I have been to the one at Woodland, which is actually okay. Wrong. I went with a group of four. My boyfriend ordered steak, I got a burger, so did my sister. Our friend got chicken alfredo. We split an appetizer, that we waited 20 minutes for. It was okay, just cheese sticks from their freezer. Another 20 minutes after that, our food arrived. The steak was dry and bland, we gave up asking for it to be cooked medium well after the second try and just ate the VERY well done as it was. My burger was just plain gross. The meat was dry and overseasoned, the bun was soggy. I ate half, and ended up getting very sick that night. My sister got lucky, her burger was mediocre at best, she complained of stomach upset later. And the friend with the chicken, well, LUMPY alfredo and hardly any meat.  No one asked for a box for our leftovers, not that we could find a server to ask anyway. When our waitress finally came back, we had to ask her again for separate bills. It took her ten minutes to do that, and after we paid, she came back and told my little sister that her credit card had been denied. It was one of those Visa gift cards -- my sister had told her that there was $12 exact left on the card and she would pay the rest in cash. The waitress refused to run it again, so I took the card and paid for my sister.  The waitress acted so annoyed, because now she had to run the checks again from the same bill. That must have been difficult. I won't bother with this place again. Overpriced, bland, and noisy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grandville?start=20
Megan M.,"Kentwood, MI",2,19,12,1.0,12/30/2014,Worst service I've ever had here. Our waiter spent most of his time at the table next to us talking to two girls.

The place was fairly uncrowded so we figured 45 minutes to eat and get to the movie would be fine. We were wrong. Our waitress was odd, to say the least. It took her 15 minutes to just get our drinks. We understand Guinness beer does take some time to pour on draft, but it doesn't take that long.  We ordered a appetizer and a sandwich for our entrees, the fastest and easiest things to make right? Well it seems like they were the hardest for this place. The guys next to us who ordered after us got their Stroganoff and Grilled Chicken with Shrimp way before we got our food. Our waitress didn't even bring out our food, the waitress who was serving those guys brought it out. Our waitress was talking a couple through eating their cheesecake.

Nicole Leigh S.,"Tampa, FL",376,221,262,1.0,4/18/2007,"Alright, let me tell you.  I eat out- often, and I've hit about every type of restaurant I can find, but sometimes I crave something ""American"".  At one time I thought TGI Friday's would be the place.  I was mistaken.  Greatly mistaken. Now, I've worked in restaurants.  About every position that one can hold outside of management.  I've cooked, bussed, served, and even jumped behind the bar for a hot second when the circumstances called for such. I have never, in all of times out, in all the restaurants I've worked for (even the corporate, multi million dollar, widespread chains like Friday's) had worse service than I have here.  All three times that I've gone.  I'm not sure if it's this specific location, or if the training these servers and bartenders got was the worst in existence.   Though the food was acceptable, the atmosphere relatively comfortable, I found waiting for the server to visit the table for over twenty minutes at a time rather exhausting.  The worst part was that no matter how many times we asked other servers to find ours, she still neglected to check up.  It took her ten minutes plus to get me a water, and at least a half an hour after we ordered our food someone else delivered our  two appetizers without letting us know what had taken so long. Because I've worked that position it is a rare day for me to tip poorly, even when I can point out multiple things the server could have done better.  That night was an exception.  I did notify a manager, send an e-mail and am now posting this review.
