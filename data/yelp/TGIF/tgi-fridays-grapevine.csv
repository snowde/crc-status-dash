Carey A.,"Chicago, IL",11,111,23,3.0,9/5/2008,Don't like the fact they don't release their nutrition information but their food is good. Â The location is good and always to seem busy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grapevine
Preston B.,"Queens, NY",25,100,1,3.0,8/31/2006,"It's a chain, it's alright, i like the Jack Daniels platters, they all taste good. I had some kinda Talapia this last time, it was a last minute choice of resturants due to the other place taking too long to seat us. We also came when they had amature bartenders doing some kind of competition, so it was TOO loud and people screaming while I was trying to catch up with my friends. Ehh... 3 stars for no wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-grapevine
