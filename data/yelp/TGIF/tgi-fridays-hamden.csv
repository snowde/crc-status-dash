Kristina B.,"Wolcott, CT",235,67,47,3.0,8/27/2017,"I went to TGI Friday's with my family for lunch the other day. I had the black bean avocado burger and it was actually pretty good. The plating of the burger and fries was aesthetically pleasing and the burger itself was nice. One complaint I have is that the service was a bit slow. There weren't many tables but we found ourselves waiting a while. Additionally, there weren't a huge amount of vegetarian options on the menu, so while I was happy with my meal, I might not be back any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden
Kim S.,"Woodbridge, CT",22,2,,1.0,9/9/2017,I am not even going to give this a star.  I can not believe the board of health allows it to operate. I went a few months ago had terrible service and my steak was a hockey puck. After waiting forever they apologized  Gave us our meal free and a coupon and a lot of apologies. I decided to try it one more time months later I've been avoiding this location and decide to go with friends last night I want to a second chance with the same flat iron steak and unfortunately this time the steak was literally rancid and it smelled up the entire table I put a piece in my mouth and instantly spit it out I asked my friend to  Taste it to see if it was just me he couldn't even put it to his mouth because of the odor.  The manager came over and assured me that  Everything is prepped fresh in the morning. They took it away and another manager came over to me and asked what happened and I told him. He gave me the same paper coupon I got the last time. I am now going to contact the TGI Fridays corporate headquarters. Somebody needs look into that location in Hamden Connecticut. Our entire table should be given a free meal I had to wait again and then up taking my alternate meal home with me and threw it away out of fear. This review is minor of what really I should have done. This is not even worthy of a star it's not even worth being measured.  I have to give the start so it would post otherwise it would have gotten 0,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden
Manda L.,"Shelton, CT",22,17,,1.0,9/4/2017,"Oh God. How many synonyms of ""bad"" can there be? My boyfriend and I came Labor Day night at around 8:30. Not exactly a busy time. Keep that in mind. It's important.  So the host seats us. We wait about 10 minutes for a server who never came to take a drink order or so much as greet us. Finally, we flag down the host and ask her for water, and she took our order since there was no server in sight. Eventually our would-be server came by to tell us our food was put in. Yeah, thanks, the host is clearly more competent at your job.  We waited quite a while for our food, especially given the lack of business. When it came, my boyfriend remarked at the lack of fries given. He loved the burger though. Hello, one star. I got a salad and, although tasty, the lettuce was wilted. Speaking of lettuce, the menu says romaine and kale? Hah. No kale. Not one piece of kale.  Now, our over-achieving server doesn't come by to see how things are, so she wouldn't know that my boyfriend was in desperate need of napkins, as he was covered in burger juices.  All in all, this Fridays needs some real adjustments. We regretted not going to Wood n Tap down the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden
Al Gene A.,"Milford, CT",0,1,,1.0,8/25/2017,"Today's experience was terrible. I came with my father before his flight out of state.  I ordered off the Lunch Special - a Bruschetta Chicken Pasta with a side Caesar Salad. My father ordered a Medium Rib Eye Steak with Sauteed Shrimp.  10 minutes later, a different waitress came over and asked if someone ordered a side Caesar Salad. I took it but before I could ask anything, she hurried back into the kitchen. Our waitress never came by to ask how the salad was, if we got utensils, or update on our food.  The table near us ordered endless apps and they even put in an additional order that they received before we got anything. 40 minutes later, our waitress came by saying that there was an error with the computer and that our original order was never processed, but they put the order in now. I told her that I waited 30 minutes for her to come back to ask about utensils, but her lack of attention to us caused us to leave.  I think her dependency on the machine caused her unable to solve a problem. She didn't even apologize. She said her manager was going to come by to talk to us. But we waited enough and didn't get any update or attention from our waitress so we left.  Honestly if I could give 0 stars that'd be more fitting. But since 1 is the lowest, the Sprite with ice was very cold and tasted like Sprite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden

Scott K.,"Middletown, CT",1,21,2,1.0,10/18/2017,Waited an easy 15 minutes before the waitress came and took our drink order. Two sodas and a water. Another 5 minutes went by before we received our drinks. The waitress took our order. My girlfriend ordered the fried chicken sandwich. Her son ordered the 1/2 BBQ Ribs and I ordered the Jack Daniel's Chicken. The waitress returns to the table and tells my girlfriend that they ran out of fried chicken for her sandwich. Ok. She then chooses the Chicken and shrimp pasta. After about 20 minutes the meals get to the table. The chicken I ordered was cooked too long. The chicken and shrimp pasta was soupy and was not good. The BBQ Ribs were the only thing that was good. We ordered 2 desserts and then asked for the bill. $95 for the three of us and we didn't even have alcohol. What a ripoff....We will not return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden
Terry B.,"New Haven, CT",0,6,,2.0,8/4/2017,"Today i decided i wanted to have some TGIF, it been over 6 years to 8 since i had it , and i use to go with my friends  to the one in hamden, at the time which was great. until today, today i order Bruschetta Chicken Pasta, Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta, Loaded potato skins and the Caesar Salad with Breadstick with Caesar Dressing, Well, i will start off that i was only doing a take out order. (which took 40 mins instead of 15 mins to get) but i will admit the person who took my order was very nice and sweet.  very professional .   i will start with the Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta, and pasta,  when i first opening  it for my family it look good but when i tasted the chicken, it was a bit odd,  flavored was a bit weird, and the chicken tasted  over cooked but not the best..  but at least the food was hot when i got home. Bruschetta chicken and pasta, "" normally, i wouldn't mind how the food looks at first, but i felt like someone just threw pasta with a super small piece of chicken, that was thinly slice  into 4 strips,(as if they are trying to save chicken ) then one small chunk of chicken,  i was really highly disappointed not just that i order the full not the half serving  and still felt like, the person  who order the cajun shrimp still had the equal amount as i did with the full serving. the sauce was good at least, but  over all it wasn't something i would tell my other friends about. Now the bread sticks, i have to say the bread sticks was the best out of all of it.  so i didn't have to much to say   which is why i gave it two stars. potato skins, I would say i kinda enjoy the  potato skins but i felt like i got  more potato then bacon  and cheese,   even tho i did say i wanted broccoli on my potato skins but instead i got it on the side,  but i will add the broccoli came out very good tho. at the end i didn't mind eating it  the way it was a bit burnt but it didn't bother me that much.  Now i saved the best for last, the Ceasar salad, there so much i could say, but i will keep it short, the salad had nothing in it but 4 or 5 bread crumbs. nothing in it beside lettuce, and  a few flakes of cheese  you can tell that the person didn't put his heart into the food, or he seem to lost his passion..  I really hope fridays, change there ways, bring back the good food they use to. from years ago. i don't know what happen over the years. but i seriously hope you  guys talk it out or something. see whats going on in the kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden
J L.,"Durham, NC",0,8,,2.0,7/23/2017,"Not the greatest experience... The restaurant was fairly empty, but we still waited about 20 minutes before our server greeted us. We placed our orders (1 appetizer and 4 entrees). After another 30 minutes of waiting, we still didn't receive our appetizer. Wait staff other than our waitress came out to assure us that our food was coming right up. Less than 10 minutes later, a member from the kitchen staff and brought out one of the four entrees we ordered. We were confused how 1 meal came out without the other 3, and furthermore, why an entree came out before a meal. We were told that the other entrees would be out within the next couple of minutes. Another 15 minutes passed, and at this point, we cancelled the appetizer. Another 20 minutes passed, and the other 3 entrees came out.  Food arrived cold but we didn't complain because we were certain that it would be another 40 minutes before we got our food.

As TGI Fridays members we get free chip and salsa, there was a 2/ $12 special food and drinks the first drink made was overly strong for a Sangria so Samantha asked how it was I told her she took it back since I could not drink it and the replacement Coconut Ma Thai it was very good.

Alyssa M.,"Bay Shore, NY",0,1,,1.0,10/17/2017,"Me and my boyfriend were traveling back to Long Island and decided to stop here on our way home. Visually the restaurant looks nice, however, as our time spent there continued things just started getting worse. My boyfriend was given a styrofoam cup for his coffee because there were apparently no mugs. My fork that was wrapped in the napkin had caked on food on it, On the way to the bathroom there was butter on the floor that remained there for the entire hour that we were there with employees passing by not attempting to clean it. When receiving our food, the boneless wings had celery with it that was still noticeably dirty and looked to be not very fresh. Furthermore, a waiter across the booth from us looked at the tip he was given when the patrons had left and outwardly expressed that he was upset with what he received, going as far as calling them rude names out loud. All in all I could not wait to leave. I have never experienced anything like this and really feel as though somebody needed to know in case anybody became sick in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden

Ann Marie L.,"Wallingford, CT",36,13,,2.0,1/29/2016,"Alright, let me start with how badly I've wanted to come back here. I used to love Fridays years ago. Around 2 years ago I came with friends for trivia and happy hour and it was great. This time, however, was very different. I had a gift certificate so I wanted to go for dinner. I tried something new - the salmon and Langostino lobster. We waited over 40 minutes and when my food arrived, it was just salmon with a very small amount of some kind of cream sauce. It was supposed to come in an Alfredo sauce with mushrooms as well as the lobster. I was confused and asked my server, and he said it was his error when I ordered and that it was a lobster SAUCE. I shrugged and ate my food anyway thinking I had misread the description. It wasn't bad, but not what I had expected. Halfway through my meal I decided to look it up online - I was right. It said it came with sautéed lobster in an Alfredo sauce with mushrooms. So now I was annoyed.  On top of the entirely wrong order, I had a side of ""mac and cheese"" ... I use quotes because penne with cheese sprinkled on top is NOT Mac and cheese. It was also over cooked. Ew.  My boyfriend said his meal was good, but in my opinion it didn't look that great. It at least was not presented well, it looked like it was just slapped on the plate.  In my error, I really should've harassed the server about my meal more thoroughly. At least to get some of the price taken off - I paid for a meal with lobster and got only the salmon half. In the end I was too annoyed to bother him a second time when I was already almost finished with my meal.  So I will not go back. Food was less than ""eh"", way too long of a wait time, and errors with my meal. It is really disappointing as I had so many memories in that restaurant from years ago.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden

Jay O.,"Hamden, CT",78,277,27,2.0,10/23/2015,"Yikes.  This was a pretty bad experience.  Although very nice, the server struggled with getting our order right.  My sandwich wasn't even close to how it was described on the menu...it seemed like a make-shift combination of two other chicken sandwiches on the menu.  The soup was lukewarm.  The chicken in the salad was sketchy.  I definitely didn't go in expecting much (thank God) and left remembering why I never go there.  It's amazing to me that Chili's closed and this place is still chugging along.  I felt like Chili's executed much better as far as this type of chain goes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden

Juan M.,"Westport, CT",257,197,38,1.0,4/26/2014,"I went here this afternoon with a friend.  We ordered a pretzel appetizer, hamburgers and fries.  Our appetizers never came out, so After about 45 minutes, our main dishes came out,  I asked the server what happened to our appetizer.  She said ""Oh the kitchen is really busy so they did were not ready yet""  What??? did she not realize that she just brought out 2 salads and two hamburger, yet the kitchen could not get pretzels don't in over 45 minutes??? Furthermore, they were not even busy.  The waitress then proceeded to say she will take it off the bill.  Duh... if we did not get it did they expect us to pay for it?  I think what really ticked me off is the table right across from our ordered the same appetizer and it came out quickly and their main dishes came out in under 30 minutes. I also wanted to say when out hamburgers came out they were both cold, no doubt its because they were probably just sitting there.  Also I asked for a manager twice and of course no one ever came to the table.   Totally  give two thumbs down!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden?start=20

We can go here at night get more than enough food to share a few drinks and never spend more than $30.

Desiree D.,"New Haven, CT",172,421,581,1.0,3/19/2012,"Sorry if this is long, I am going to say sorry to start off..... OK. The break down is simple: If you like a nice cocktail / happy hour with your friends, and are on a budget, you should go here.  If you like to wait hours for useless service and no attentive staff, go here. OK this is the story: On a very NOT busy Sunday around 1 pm, myself and 4 other adults and one child went here to get some lunch. The place looked very understaffed, and they went to go seat us but told us to wait so they could put some tables together. Turns out they put the tables together, then never told us and we waited around for 10 minutes. Then some kid walks up to us and goes ""OH , your table is already set up""... Thanks. We sit down and have the worst service ever. It took the waitress 15 minutes to even come see us. As we sat down, a table with a small child and two adults said ""you should leave now, we have been here for 2 1/2 hours"" We should have listened. We ordered some cocktails from the menu and noticed quickly that the bar was empty. There were 2 bartenders, and it took almost 30 minutes for our drinks to arrive. At one point I became so irritated, I asked our waitress what the hold up was. She said that people called out and they were short staffed. NO...really? hmm.. So we ordered our food after patiently waiting for our food. We waited..and waited...it took over an hour to get our food. Remind you, the food for the baby was ordered, simple chicken fingers and fries, and ended up coming first , we were all so hungry we ate almost all of her food while we waited and waited for ours. What a horrible place this is, I can't even put it into words. LOL. Anyways, we finally get our food and my boyfriend has a HUGE hair in his burger...IN his burger. My food was cold and gross, and the others did not enjoy theirs either. This experience was so bad, I e-mailed them via their website, and the manager called me to ask me about what happened. He ended up saying TGI's was sending me a $50.00 voucher in the mail, and he was sending one personally too. ( I explained a million times to him this was not my intention, I just wanted to tell him that it was horrible and nobody with a baby should have to wait this long to eat).  He sent me one,but the ""corporate"" didn't. I never got it. The manager went on to explain that that day they were short staffed, and many people called out. He went on to say that he used my e-mail as a example of what ""not to do"" and had an immediate staff meeting regarding all of my issues. I will never eat here again.

Not sorry there's a dirty rag on your table. We ordered drinks a mango sangria and white peach sangria. Their menu is redesigned I guess to give the illusion of a higher end chain experience.. Not the case. We ordered the 3 for 25 apps hibachi chicken, Mac and cheese bites, and corned beef sliders. The chicken was an absolute joke, Mac and cheese bites average, and the sliders were decent.

Took forever for the food to come and when it did dinner and apps all came out at the sane time. The natchos were disappointing with liquid cheese.  But my wife says the drinks were good. Must be the bar that keeps it going.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden?start=20
Dani D.,"Anaheim, CA",4,33,4,4.0,8/2/2014,"My boyfriend and I come here for happy hour drink specials almost every week (Thursday nights - $3 bottled beers, half off appetizers, cheap margaritas!) and we've never been disappointed. The bar service is excellent, very attentive and quick to bring our drinks and food every time. Usually not overly busy so we get nice service, yummy drinks, and decent food for about $20 (a drink each plus two filling appetizers - a fun, mixed up dinner experience) so we like it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden?start=20

Then the guy he was patient def easier to talk to however no smile! Didn't ask me what kind of sauce do I want on my wings! Got me the wrong sauce and made me wait extra 20 min for the food!

Ocean F.,"New Haven, CT",3,6,1,1.0,1/23/2014,"I am not a fan of chain restaurant, though I do think they are good for consistency, decent food at a reasonable price. I have visited this Fridays about 5times now and have not yet been impressed by their food or hygiene.  This past visit with my girlfriend was the least impressive of visits. We went in during Happy Hour hoping for a great end of the week R&R happy hour. The slidders meat was as bad as jail food, when we got the mustard there was a thick aged mold growing on the cap. I took a picture of it to post but my girlfriend erased it off her phone. Thanks :) I know a group of gays guys that religiously go on thursdays to take advantage of the bad food and service just to be able to eat and drink on a ghetto budget.   That is not the kind of reputation I would want to have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden?start=40

David T.,"Lake Worth, FL",131,619,114,2.0,10/4/2013,We came here last night to eat a salad because we just got into town. Let me tell you bad. Service to get a table was every man for themselves.  No problem. It is what it is. But our waitress was snarky and nasty. My fiancé received multiple dirty looks and was told there was no feta cheese after the salad came out and was told there was feta cheese. Then again got a look like she was a moron. The waitress name was katelyn. Very rude! Especially on someone's bday! Run don't walk away,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden?start=40

Melissa H.,"Waterbury, CT",1,12,,4.0,5/3/2014,"Normally I do not write reviews on chain restaurants because I find them mediocre - nothing amazing or terrible about them. However, I was at Fridays in Hamden today and had such great service! We had a waiter named Chuck who was VERY attentive, checking on us multiple times to make sure everything was good, asking if we needed refills, etc. I heard if you downloaded the app and signed up for their Stripes program you got a free appetizer or dessert, so I gave it a try. He was more than happy to give me the offer and also explained we got free chips and salsa every time also. Our food also came out quick, hot and good! He also gave me extra sauce to take home with my food too, which was appreciated. Great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden?start=40
Chanel B.,"Hamden, CT",2,15,2,1.0,3/30/2014,"RUN. First off, this place is filthy. The floors are always dirty and outrageously sticky. The menus pages stick together because they are gross as well. What's a nasty floor and menu without a nasty table? I've been here a few times. It's convenient because it's close to where I live. I'm from long island and moved to hamden a little over a year ago. I've been to TGIF plenty of times where I'm from and never experienced on like this before. Maybe hamden natives are slobs or the managers here just don't give a crap and don't clean the place. But besides that, I literally just walked out of there half an hour ago. We were sat down at a disgusting table. The place was not crowded by ANY means and we were at our table for 15 minutes and no one had come by to even just take our drink orders. We just left and came across the street to Chili's which is spotless, and got served immediately. I'll never go back to that TGIF. I hope a manager or some head person sees this review and does something about that dump. Don't waste ur money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden?start=40

Paulina D.,"Berlin, CT",0,11,,1.0,6/1/2014,"Although I wasn't expecting anything too spectacular from a TGI Friday's, I was very disappointed in my last and final time there. I ordered a philly stacked burger expecting not too much could go wrong with a burger. Boy, was I wrong.  First, it took forever and a day to be waited on and for the food to come out of the kitchen, late night, on a Tuesday, with all of maybe 2 other tables there.  When my food finally came,  I took a couple bites of my burger before i bit into something questionable. I disassembled the burger to find something that resembled either pork or chicken. What worried me is that I am allergic to chicken. When the waitress finally came back, I asked her nicely to check to see if there was any other meat in the burger other than beef as well as vocalizing that it may be chicken and informing her of my allergy. Again she disappeared for a while, and when she finally came back she informed me that it must be just  a  mushroom,  she did not offer to replace my meal, she did not offer to comp it, she just walked off. Now, I saw the mushrooms in my now disassembled burger, and that did not look like mushrooms. I asked other's at my table, they concurred, this was not a mushroom. She didn't say a word and just left. When she came back to collect everyone's dishes she took the burger, which I had taken all of 2 bites out of and didn't say a word.  I was disgusted at how nonchalantly this issue was taken. It was late, I was tired and now concerned of how much of this ""mystery""product I had ingested and what it was, and I didn't feel like arguing it with a manager, and even though I should have. I paid for my burger, and since then I have not and will not step into another Friday's restaurant.  If I could give it less than one star, I would.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden?start=40

Steve W.,"New Haven, CT",0,3,,4.0,3/29/2012,"I am a regular of this establishment and I just wanted to defend this restaurant.  I have been coming here for years.  The food is usually piping hot and comes out correct.  If it doesn't, I send it back and it gets fixed.  No big deal.  Remember, nobody is perfect.   I get fantastic service on a consistent basis.   Oh, regarding the woman that came on the day they were understaffed... Obviously things take a long time if a restaurant is understaffed.  A restaurant isn't just allowed to close the doors.  The Show must go on.  Trust me, I used to own one.  No one forced you to stay when you waited 15 minutes to even see the waitress.  That's when you should leave, not after waiting 30 minutes for drinks or an hour for food.  Come on people! Use common sense.  One more thing.  If people leaving an establishment are telling you not to come in because they waited a long time that's a fairly good indicator that you shouldn't risk waiting if you have kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamden?start=40
Ariana M.,"Hamden, CT",2,15,,1.0,4/7/2012,"My fiancee has always liked this kind of food. Not a fan myself. Yesterday was his birthday, so I called to reserve a table for 12. No reservations. Ok, I will just come a little earlier to make sure the table is ready. I brought a lovely cake from Ashley's(5 stars btw) and some candles and handed them over to the hostess. It goes downhill from there. The waiter was awful. He was hardly ever around and when he was he only talked about the Yankees game that was playing. My fiancee's steak had been burned to death, the rice and veggies looked like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for the past hour. We would have sent it back, but again our waiter was no where to be found, even though they did not appear to be busy that night. After waiting for 30 minutes with no cake, no nothing. I asked for the check which he was happy to bring over. And he did bring, just the check. 20 minutes after that, when he came to pick up the check I told him to just bring out the cake with to go boxes. We ate my fiancee's cake out of styrofoam with the dirty remains of the entrees still all over the table. Happy Birthday baby! If you are going to be paying $15/entree why not just go somewhere with better service and fresh food- Cumin, Taste, Eli's.
