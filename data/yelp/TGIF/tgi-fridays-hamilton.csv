Georges S.,"Pennington, NJ",0,5,,5.0,11/29/2017,Great atmosphere! The bar is updated with its different décor than other Fridays. Service was impeccable and staff were very friendly. Will recommend...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton
Bill E.,"Woodstock, IL",1,3,,1.0,11/11/2017,Ok. Ha.  Seriously.  This place does not give a shit about the food.  Let's just rake in $ on our expensive overpriced foo-foo drinks.  Staying at hotel next door. So first night was the ribeye and lobster.  Waited 45 min for that.  Fine.  But when I got it  it was all cold.  Crunched in some noodles in he Mac n cheese also. (Not cooked. Cold). Oh and the lobster tail was cold. Everything was.  Anyways.  Came back tonight.  Second try.  Just a 10 oz ribeye with mashed.   BUT......they seemed to think I don't know the diff between a ribeye and a crappy piece of sirloin!!! Seriously. What bad luck I've had here.   Positive note- the waitresses are super busy and always moving. It's hard. It's busy.  Butt the chef (if that's what they're called here) knew the difference in ............screw it.  I'll never come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton
Laura H.,"Browns Mills, NJ",0,30,53,1.0,6/4/2017,"Went to dinner last night with a big group of friends and we were all dissapointed with the food quality.   I can honestly say the food was not what I expected.  I've been to Friday's several of times, but this one in particular was horrible. I ordered the JD Ribeye with shrimp.  Mind you it cost $25.00 for this dinner and it was  deceiving.  I asked for my steak to be medium well, it came out black and dehydrated looking.  It was so chewy it was like eating shoe leather.   My two ice cream scoop looking mashed potatoes were dried out from sitting in the window that they  had a crust on them.  It also had broccoli on the plate with a wedge of lemon.  The lemon that was on my plate looked like it was used to clean the grill and then put on my plate. Very disappointing..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton
Percy O.,"Cream Ridge, NJ",5,37,58,4.0,7/14/2017,TGI Friday's always will be Friday's! Awesome ambience! Great service Good food! Anyone is welcome to come! Good place,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton
Linda P.,"Portsmouth, NH",37,25,,1.0,3/5/2017,"So I know this is just a Fridays but it is literally in a parking lot of a hotel and easy business.  Maybe that is why it is so bad.  No effort needed. Order steak and instead of the mashed potato and butter broccoli I ordered the steamed spinach from the menu. Well the steamed spinach came out with cheese and butter on it.  So I asked for just plain vegetables, silly me thought steamed spinach meant steamed.  So the bartender offered me the vegetable medley, but then came back out and told me that also is covered with butter and garlic. So what the heck?  Friday's cannot do a simple vegetable?  He also told me that all of their vegetables are all premade and cannot be prepared just plain.  What? So I ordered just a plain salad. Oh no, this came with cheese and crotons.  Come on!!! Bartender was nice but come on Fridays!! Won't ever go to another Fridays again Good luck to those who do...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton

Ryan O.,"Millstone, NJ",119,20,22,3.0,3/17/2017,"Food: Absolutely delicious. After the first bite I was sold on the rib and shrimp combo. Also took a forkful of mashed potatoes and broccoli off my moms plate. Both great. I think these places are generally good and this food was above par. 5/5  Service: The service was average. We found ourselves looking for the waitress sometimes, but whenever we brought it up she showed up soon after. She was nice and good at her job, just wish she visited the table more frequently. 3/5 Location: This category has to be the reason why there are 3 stars missing from a perfect 5. This Fridays is in the parking lot of a hotel which makes it difficult to navigate the parking lot. 2/5 Total: 10/15",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton
David H.,"Trenton, NJ",128,928,673,4.0,1/17/2016,"I believe they have successfully reinvented themselves. Yes they've long been an established fast casual chain known more for their commercials on TV for 474 lunch deals, endless apps and other types of hype to bring in clientele. I can only remember them having greasy appetizers, weak overpriced drinks and not being vegetarian friendly. That has all changed. They were fined several years ago for watering down their alcohol and seem to have served their sentence. The drinks now are taller, stronger and tasty. During happy hour, they're even reasonable. While my wife had the raspberry margarita, I stuck to the beer. They even had some beer specials. Nice to see they have some craft beer on tap and in bottles. Such as Stone IPA, Laganitas on draft and Widmer Omission in bottles. Lots of TV's all over the place for watching sports, etc.  For dinner we started with the spinach and artichoke flatbread as an app. I had the Bourbon Barrel Chicken which was one of the lowest price and calorie on the menu. Served on a small wooden plank, you can taste the brown sugar they use and not so much the bourbon. For sides, I recommend the tomato and mozzarella salad which is made with chopped red onions similar to a caprese salad. The second side I chose the higher calorie cheddar mac & cheese.  We were only looking for a place to hang and watch the NFL playoff games where it wouldn't be too loud and rowdy. While I'm not a big fan of fast casual chains, I was impressed with their new menu, the great service and friendly atmosphere. They now have vegetarian options as well such as black bean burgers anyway you want them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton
SK K.,"Irvington, NY",46,21,2,1.0,6/27/2017,Ate here last night after a great day at 6flags. Only wish it had a better ending. I asked my family to personally shame me if we ever go to another Friday's. Cathy our server was the lobe bright spot. The food the menu and overpriced apps are ridiculous.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton
Rachel B.,"Trenton, NJ",204,33,39,3.0,12/20/2016,"This place is give or take. I always love the food, but sometimes the service is slow.

Skullrose R.,"South Amboy, NJ",27,6,,2.0,6/21/2017,"Gave it three tries! 1st attempt salad was rotted, 2nd attempt jd steak tasted like I imagine a shoe would and last but not least the 3rd and final attempt they ran out of burgers.

Shauna R.,"Buffalo, NY",16,84,167,5.0,1/9/2017,"Of course you know what to expect when stopping at TGIF, but this time we really had an exceptional visit. We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for a wedding weekend, basically took over the restaurant on a weekend night, and they responded amazing! We started with 13 people and increased to 20. The staff was amazing and our 1 (yes only 1) server, Karen, helped us ALL with an amazing positive attitude! The staff helped us add more tables and chairs and consistently checked in on our food and drinks. Karen recommended the endless appetizers which worked perfectly and she made sure to keep them coming with runners since we had such a large party. We were never waiting for service and everybody was happy with the food and drinks. So glad that they were able to accommodate our large, loud, party on a weekend even without accepting reservations. Great service and I recommend stopping by to anybody in the area!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton
Wayne D.,"Murfreesboro, TN",7,38,20,1.0,10/3/2017,"I thought that I'd try this place despite its low rating. It was close to the hotel and I wanted to watch the game. It was absolutely horrible!

Emily L.,"West Babylon, NY",13,1,,1.0,7/19/2017,"It took an hour for the food to come after we ordered. Waiter was very nice but place was extremely understaffed and very inconvenient considering it was 10:30 at night and they claimed it was just a ""busy night"" but the place was empty.  Had just finished day at six flags and the kids were very tired.

Ancient H.,"Easton, PA",45,3,,1.0,4/7/2017,Stopped by looking to get a decent meal. Food is over priced and I didn't see where the money went. This is probably the last time I'm gong to TGIF. They need up date their menu.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton
Kathy S.,"Pennington, NJ",36,3,,1.0,8/10/2017,Stood at the hostess booth for 10-15 mins.  Was never greeted by anyone.  Several servers walked by us and saw us waiting and didn't even acknowledge us.  So we left.  Probably won't return:(,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton
Steve S.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",1,22,6,2.0,8/20/2016,Food was what I expected. Decent and average priced. Service.  That was another story. I was dining alone and was seated and had to wait ten minutes before waitstaff came over. I almost left.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton
Pasadena S.,"Monmouth County, NJ",1,37,40,1.0,5/29/2017,"If you are starving, driving on rt 130 in Hamilton - KEEP GOING. DO NOT EAT HERE. We should have kept driving and ate cold cereal for dinner. I am so sorry I took my son here for a late dinner. We had to eat in the bar area because I was told they only have 5 servers. Half the tables were empty. So we sat at the tall table and waiting and waited some more. Finally after 15 minutes, the waitress stops by. She was clearly over worked & stressed. The first thing she did was tell me how busy they are and understaffed. Because we were seated during ""Happy Hour"" We ordered appetizers and two sodas. It took 35-40 minutes for the food to arrive. By this time my son had a headache and wanted to just leave. The table next to us was waiting also. She was told after her 25 minute wait that they ""ran out of hamburgers"" Seriously. So back to our issue: OUR food arrived medium warm at the most. The chicken bites were hard and appeared to be microwaved. I asked for the check and she dropped it off but disappeared again. She did not ring up our bill with Happy Hour appetizer prices.  After the aggravation we had, I was not going to argue the point. We just wanted to pay & leave and never return. I approached the bartender and asked her to ring up my bill. It was $45.69 and I had 3 twenty dollar bills. She replied - I will get your waitress. Hmm? WHY? SO the waitress finally returns and takes my $60 and returns with $14.00 - No change. Hmm? WHY? She explained that she has no change and only the bartender can give coins. So she rounded my change to just $14 no coins. Hmm? I have never heard of this policy. Must be nice to keep other peoples coins.....Note to self and others on YELP - Avoid this TGIF. Go home and eat cold cereal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton
Amanda G.,"Crum Lynne, PA",232,583,377,3.0,1/12/2014,"As with all chain restaurants, I ask, what do you expect? It is what it is.  The quesadilla was bland, bland, bland. It was on the menu as a ""southwest chicken"" quesadilla and described as ""spicy."" It was certainly not spicy at all, and I've had much better quesadillas from Wawa! The French fries were decent. The iced tea was different each time I got it. My first drink was OK, and when I got a refill it was like the iced tea was transparent. I drank it and it was not good; it tasted like water. To my surprise the waitress brought over another glass with darker iced tea in it and said that she noticed the color was off. The third glass was good.  Overall if you're in a bind for a food option, you'll be able to satiate yourself here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton

Kristen P.,"Ewing Township, NJ",0,1,2,1.0,11/1/2012,"Came in for a drink and a bite to eat. Bar was dirty and the bartender never cleaned it. Margarita tastes like sour candy.

Bob C.,"Riverside, NJ",0,2,,1.0,10/7/2012,"3 of us went to this place last night.  It's on 130 South near the Hamilton Marketplace adjacent to a Hilton hotel.  They weren't busy at all.  We sat at a high-top in the bar area and got this real spacey guy who was impersonating a server.  We ordered a couple of apps and they were not good at all.  ""Server-guy"" then took our order and didn't write it down. 25 minutes later, I'm asking where our food is and he seemed perplexed.....it didn't come out for another 10 or 15 minutes!  This guy must have never placed the order but wouldn't fess up. My girlfriend is allergic to red peppers and asked that her pasta dish did not include them but of course they did.  I ordered the ""sizzling"" fajitas and it was a lump of nasty sliced steak with zero sizzle - it was awful!  I've never had this experience at a Friday's before but rest assured I'll never go back to this one!  Terrible!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton?start=40
Shaniece P.,"South Brunswick Township, NJ",138,21,16,5.0,7/29/2016,Okay so I have to say ( Rachel ) is probably the best bartender. I recently wrote a bad review about the one in east Windsor and let me tell you revel did the job. Not only was she nice but my drink didn't taste like I ordered water.

Christina L.,"Englishtown, NJ",28,101,45,1.0,8/29/2016,"Went here with a couple of friends on a Saturday night and our experience was interesting to say the least. When we sat down no one came over to us for at least 15 minutes and when someone finally did come they came to say they were not our waiter and left. The next lady who came over told us she could only take our drink order because she was not our waitress either (even though we had our dinner orders ready). Then we heard the waitresses fighting over who was going to have to take our table!!! When our waitress finally did come over she was rude and not pleasant. We ordered all six of the endless apps that were on the menu and for some reason that was hard for her and we had to read the apps one at a time and each person had to order a specific one. The lemon I got in my water made the water taste like metal, we had no silver wear at the tables at first, and even though we were all mad with the circumstances our waitress continued to be rude.

Kieran M.,"Trenton, NJ",0,3,,1.0,8/14/2016,"Well, I can't give zero stars... Decided to go out to dinner tonight. We figured this TGI Fridays was closer and worth a shot. Never again! The only thing keeping this place alive is the bar. The mixed drinks were great! But that's it. Our server told us that they are always understaffed. That explains the amount of time we waited for our food, but not the exquisitely poor quality. We got our entrees before the appetizer and before the soup. Our app and soup came out moments later. It took 15 minutes to bring us silverware, AFTER our entire meal was served. The cheeseburger sliders were past well done; nearly inedible. The soup was ok, but really salty. My wife's meal was terrible. Steak was tough and chewy, potatoes were like glue, broccoli was sour and rubbery. My fajitas were bad. Steak was tough, rice was undercooked, pico de gallo was awful, and I got a TON of lettuce. We're never coming back. We are, however, handing the bartender $7 in singles (all we have) and telling him that he is the only reason we stayed for dinner. Two groups of patrons, that we witnessed, got up and left after being seated. Either because their server took so long to greet them and take their drink order, or because the food took so long to leave the kitchen. The group across from us had to remind their server THREE times that they were still waiting on their appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton?start=20
Mara S.,"Bordentown, NJ",1,9,,1.0,7/12/2016,"If I could give 0 stars I would. We live right by this Friday's, one time ago we went for dinner and I got a salad. I found a piece of the metal binding from the lettuce in it. But I had already eaten a lot so I was horrified. They gave me a new salad to take home.(I don't think I should have had to pay at all) Around 4am that night I was so sick throwing up, and it lasted all day. I got food poisoning probably from some sort of cross contamination because the kitchen clearly wasn't careful. Today we decided to try again for the first time in months and months. My boyfriend is now sick. I'm just glad my son didn't come with us because he's 3 and if he was sick like this it would really be a problem.

Samantha M.,"Hamilton Township, NJ",0,3,,3.0,9/16/2015,"Ok. For what it's worth? I do admit to eating here often. Sit in the bar area usually.  Good decent quick meals. Staff is usually friendly.  Young waitress there, not sure of her name (she's interning at a local school though). Very friendly and hustles her butt off.  Usually hope to get her, but she wasn't working last night.   However, a different story to be told regarding my experience there yesterday.   We were waited on by a young man who is there often.  Dark hair.  Pleasant.  Very patient and friendly. Working behind the bar area.  Did a really nice job BUT we had a question for another waitress there who was passing by our table while this young man was in the kitchen.   She cut us off mid question (just asking about what items were available on their Endless Apps menu) and walked away as we were talking to her.     Rude as can be.  Shameful really.  Manager needs to have a lil chat with this one!!  We were not complaining. We were friendly. No need to be rude.  Further she was talking about us to the table behind us. Needs an attitude adjustment.   Fast.  She's lucky I was not in a bad mood or I would have let her know what I thought of her crappy attitude.   Aside from this?

People were missing food. One of the drink glasses was completely cracked. The water tasted foul. We had to ask the manager for refills on drinks; no one checked up us.

Margaret G.,"Keansburg, NJ",0,1,,2.0,5/14/2014,"I has originally posted this on Facebook but my oldest son said I should post it here so here goes ... My son Dave, my sister in law Carol and I went to TGI Fridays for dinner and had the oddest experience. It must have been Carol's fault because .. Well, just because, LOL! Anyway, our waiter was a cute little Spanish guy named Sergio who may or may not have been new but was completely devoid of any charm or personality ... or sense of humor because he laughed at none of my jokes. Which would have been fine because the food was good and served in a timely fashion. But then dessert happened and another family came into his section and apparently, he had some sort of breakdown and I am imagining ran out through the kitchen screaming and they had to send a freakin posse to round him up and drag him back. Dave and I each ordered pb chocolate pie. We waited an eternity before a different waiter came with one tiny piece of pie and two forks. He then announced ""I have no idea where your waiter is!"" So we look around and pointed him out and Dave said, um, we ordered two pieces of pie, one each."" I mean seriously, I have posted pictures of myself and family on here. Do we LOOK like we share one tiny piece of pie? So I am waiting for my pie for another eternity. Dave was done, Carol was on her third beer. I was going to ask for a glass of water but since Sergio had disappeared, I just waited for the ice in my tea to melt. Finally my pie arrives. Like NOTHING EVER HAPPENED. Alrighty then. I asked Dave to ask for the check while we excused ourselves to the powder room, where Carol had no idea how to work the paper towel dispenser and thought she broke it because I can't take her anywhere without some odd thing happening. So we go back to the table, the bill is there and we are waiting for Sergio to come and settle up. I asked Dave if he remembered the line from Backdraft where the guy says, ""You see that flash of light in the corner of your eye? That's your career dissipation light. It just went into high gear."" Well, that was how I felt about the tip. Every tick it was getting smaller. We finally walked out to the hostess desk to pay and the other guy who brought the pie had a questioning look on his face. We asked if we could pay there and he said we had to pay our server. I said if you can find him, I will. So ... ... ... Finally he comes and takes the bill (LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED) and my card and it's over. I told him the tip was on the table. I left him $13 because I hope it's bad luck in his culture and that will teach him. I should have drawn an evil eye on the check. The food was really good, work on the service/waitstaff!

I had dinner there the other night and Lara was our server. She seemed either like she was high or just didn't care about her job (I couldn't figure out which). She kept forgetting things throughout the night, like we all ordered drinks and she never brought them. We eventually got them from another server, and she came over really confused that she hadn't written down our drink order. She brought out the wrong dessert and then charged us for it.

Nicholas C.,"Baltimore, MD",8,67,1,1.0,1/20/2010,"I haven't been to a TGI Friday's since your makeover. As a vegan (do not eat products from animals) I remember the restaurant having limited options, but options none the less (I believe it a pasta with veggies was the one lone item available on the menu). Turns out I made a big mistake going back. After the revamp, the ONLY item I could particularly have was a house salad, and only then by asking for no cheese. For a company and menu that is trying to very hard to rebrand itself and appeal to a health factor (the right size options), it is deplorable to see an utter lack of vegetarian/vegan options. They already have all the ingredients available for a grilled veggie pasta, etc. But apparently they utter lack of planning left anything off the menu. All I can say is the best thing about the visit was the music playing and the fact our bench had a coat hanger for our coats.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton?start=20
Megin T.,"Princeton, NJ",1,6,,3.0,5/22/2013,I had pot stickers and Korean steak tacos. The pot stickers were delicious and the tacos were lacking flavor. My slushy tasted fake and my Oreo ice cream dessert was packaged dessert at its greatest. Somehow it all hit the spot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton?start=20
Sandra S.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,5,,1.0,3/1/2015,If i was able to give zero stars I would. I went to TGI Fridays with my family for the reason being every restaurant was ridiculously packed and were desperate so figured Fridays would be a good choice. We thought so wrong. The wait for the table wasn't bad at all. We get seated and to be greeted took 10 minutes. I wish I remembered her name but short blonde hair looked extremely sloppy and not how a real server should present themselves. There is no service here at all. She was not attentive at all. We all needed to drinks and our server was no where to be found. Once we finally found her we didnt get our drinks for another 7-10 minutes!!! We had no silver ware what so ever after the food was brought out. Not to forget that they brought out everyones entree except for my dads waited another 10 minutes our food was cold by then. Then the salmon was extremely over cooked. Had to wait for a new one. The manger whoever the bald gentleman was not sincere i saw him make a face once walking towards the kitchen. This place is a shit hole. Running under awful management and awful staff we will never in our lifetime be ever returning to any TGI Fridays again. Plus all the food SUCKED! Sloppy presentations and tasteless not fresh food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hamilton?start=20
