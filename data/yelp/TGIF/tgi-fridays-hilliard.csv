Kathleen M.,"Atlanta, GA",2364,1627,1470,3.0,10/3/2009,"Yeeah.. when's the last time you were at a Friday's? Mmhmm, it's been longer for me. Seriously, I can't remember. But, our crew was in need of a bite (and a drink) for lunch before we headed out to Granville for a wedding, and we could walk here from our hotel, so... yeah. We were seated quickly and our friendly waiter ordered up our drinks. He then proceeded to bring them out... one at a time. Seriously. I know my ginormous pomegranate margarita (yeah, I know, but i take advantage of being with all of my girlfriends to order girlie drinks) takes some time to concoct, but a glass of wine? Really? Once we finally got all of the booze we needed, we were happy campers. My shanghai salad was impressively good, although the celery inclusion was weird... kind of threw me off there. The pomegranate margarita, while tasty and absolutely huuuuuge, had little to no alcohol. Bummer.  It took FOREVER to get our change back, but the waiter was nice enough to split our checks so it all washes out. And hey, it's a Friday's... pretty much the definition of solid mediocrity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hilliard
