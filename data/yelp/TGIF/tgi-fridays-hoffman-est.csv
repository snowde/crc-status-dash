Jennifer M.,"Schaumburg, IL",140,349,292,4.0,3/20/2015,"We came here for dinner a week ago and I'm still lingering over the Bruschetta Chicken Pasta: Multi-grain angel hair pasta is tossed in bruschetta marinara (sliced garlic, basil and roma tomatoes), topped with fire-grilled chicken breast, drizzled with balsamic glaze and sprinkled with parmesan shavings. If the ingredients intrigue you, then the photo of it in their menu will definitely entice you to place an order for one. It looks as good as the picture and tastes better than its description. What have you done to me? I went to Noodles & Co 4 days ago, ordered a pasta dish from Moretti's last night and I still want to eat the Bruschetta Chicken Pasta. I don't ever want to eat or actually consume this much carbohydrates!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est
Rob W.,"Oak Park, IL",194,819,11,3.0,12/13/2014,"I really should rank this place higher than three stars based solely on my visit, but I just can't. To me, TGIFriday's are the epitome of mediocrity if that's even possible. I went with co-leaders from the Care Center that I volunteer at. It was after 1PM on a Tuesday, so the restaurant wasn't busy. We were seated immediately. I was in the mood for a burger and after perusing the menu settled on a Jack Daniels burger - the draw with this is the Jack Daniels sauce. I liked how the waitress asked ""pink or not pink"" with reference to the cooking temperature. This actually generalizes it a little and makes it easier for the restaurant to cook it right and satisfy the guest. It actually came out REAL pink - at one point, I'd say nearly raw. Now, I don't mind that at all, but I would venture to say that a lot of customers would have had issues with that burger. Overall, the burger was OK, but there were two things I didn't care for. First, the bun was flat - nothing to it from the outset. Second, the sauce, while nicely flavored is quite thin and just runs right off the burger. Putting it on the bun or trying to dip the sandwich isn't an option due to my first issue - the flat, non-existent bun. Fries were OK, but not as plentiful as I would have liked. The waitress was pretty attentive - I thought she was about to ""strand us"" with our checks and payments waiting inside the books, but just when it was about to be a little too long to wait for her to pick them up, she did.  So that was pretty much it in a nutshell. A few of us did split a Brownie Obsession for dessert - that was pretty good. I might be back sometime in the coming decade, but it will likely be for a similar kind of lunch. I was just counting my blessings that we went there rather than Chili's across the street - that option is even lower in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est

Edward M.,"Schaumburg, IL",190,279,141,3.0,11/16/2014,"Service is decent, albeit a bit slow.  On a Saturday with half the place empty, it took them atleast 15 minutes to get us food.  I had the new cajun chicken and shrimp alfredo. I must say it was delicious, perfect noodles with a creamy spicy sauce, perfectly cooked natural (according to the menu) chicken and perfectly snappy shrimp.  I must say I was very impressed. I also sampled a pot sticker from my friend and I am impressed, very authentic, tastes like real chinese pot stickers, crispy outside with a perfectly textured inside.  I think the slowness and lack of unique foods is the reason I am not a super fan, but the food was very good. Much better than years back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est
Maggie M.,"Roselle, IL",29,33,282,4.0,12/31/2014,"Went to Fridays with my sis. Food was great. Just a little greasy. But I can understand, by eating the burger and fries. I had the classic cheeseburger. But asked to swap the American cheese for the sharp cheddar. They got that part right, but had bacon on it. Blah...not too fond of pork. So I gave it to my sister. She loves their bacon. Their Strawberry Slush Lemonade was awesome! I had to order a second. Portion size is average, not too much, but I believe it's a good amount for everyone to have. Service was pretty good. Overall, I would go back to this location. It seems like the people are friendly & the food is great!

Michelle F.,"Schaumburg, IL",174,722,1961,1.0,10/17/2011,"The service here has definitely gone downhill over the years.  I am WAY unimpressed. Last night, our family of four and the in-laws came here for dinner because my father-in-law was emailed a 20% off coupon.  So we got there and the place was half empty...they still told us it would be a 15 minute wait.  Strange, but ok.  After about 10 minutes, we were seated. Our waitress, Agne, was just NOT good in any way.  She was slow, incompetent, and didn't know the menu/coupons/kitchen/etc.  For example: 1. We ordered our drinks, and apple juice for the kids.  She came back and said they were out of juice--this was after about 10 minutes.  She also didn't ""know"" what cherry coke was?? 2. We showed her the coupon at the very beginning of the meal.  We ordered.  Since we were Stripes members, we got chips and salsa for free.  However, this took about 15 minutes to come out. 3.  Most of us ordered the 3 for 16.99 or 2 for 12.99 deals.  (Remember, she had the coupon at this point that said nothing about the fact we couldn't use it in conjunction).  We ordered mac n cheese for the kids.  With the deal came appetizers.  These took a very, very long time to come out.  They were good and hot, but it should NOT take over 20-25 minutes for these. 4. We had finished our appetizers and were waiting there for a good 10 minutes before she came back and said our food would be right up.  THEN she comes back and said ""the kitchen just told me we are out of mac n cheese"".  UMMMM, SERIOUSLY?!  We had ordered almost an hour before that, and it was JUST mentioned?!  Wow....  So we got them spaghetti instead. 5.  our food comes out, but the kids' don't...because it's not ready...so they eat off of our plates. The food was very bad.  I got the petite steak, and it was SO dry and charred even though I asked for it medium.  Nasty! 6.  The kids finally got their food and we asked for the bill.  SHE didn't come back, her MANAGER did.  Her manager (aka full-of-excuses) said that the 20% coupon wouldn't work in conjunction with the 3-for-meals we got...even though it didn't say it on there.  PLUS, we had given her the coupon before we even ordered. So through all of this, we got there before 5 pm on a Sunday, and we left at 7.  Ridiculous. I won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est
Joy S.,"Naperville, IL",576,377,136,2.0,6/5/2013,"Friday's has really gone down in portion size and quality, and gone UP in prices. I typically don't have a problem with chain restaurants, but I hadn't been to a Friday's in a while. My husband and I had our first date at this location 4 years ago, so we went for our first wedding anniversary dinner there. Mistake. Customer service is really lacking here. The phone was ringing for several minutes. I watched 3 different employees walk past and let it keep ringing. I was tempted to go answer it myself!  I was surprised when we ordered the peanut butter pie for dessert (that the waiter didn't offer - he offered our check, we had to ask about dessert) at the tiny, itty bitty slice of pie. We wanted to split it, because for $6, we expected a wider slice than 1 1/2 inches. It was smaller than what Bakers Square calls a half-slice.  The only redeeming quality of this meal was the Bacon Mac & Cheese Bites - though I would've liked more than 4 bites for the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est
John S.,"Aurora, IL",126,438,5,3.0,11/13/2013,Can honestly say if Fridays didn't have the entree and app for $10 deal there is no way I would eat here. The food at Fridays isn't fresh or even that good really. However the entree and app deal is pretty good for what you pay. If you order the sirloin don't expect steak house quality or you will be disappointed. The comfort food however is good and on par with other chain style restaurants. The service at this location was good. My friends steak was over cooked and they gave them a new one without any issues. The waitress knew right away the kitchen messed up and took care of it.

Roman L.,"Bartlett, IL",32,27,21,2.0,8/4/2013,I agree with everyone TGIF's has gone down. Even though the staff was very friendly the food portions are quite small good thing I ate my meal slow so I was not full but satisfied I ordered the dragonfire salmon. It came with broccoli and mango pico de gallo which I tasted the mango only in one bite. It also had like 4 mini mandarin wedges. And the sauce over the salmon was Kung pao sauce. I love salmon and its probably one of my favorite foods but this salmon seemed like it wasn't seasoned at all. It was more of the Kung pao sauce I could taste and there was only two pieces of broccoli.  At the end our waiter seemed like a nice person and I believe due to bad reviews they're trying to make up for it because at the end he encouraged us to go online and give him a rating of 9 or 10.

LJ D.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,25,285,2.0,8/11/2012,"Let me preface this by stating, I am giving this place 2 stars only because of our great waiter Nick.   We were met by 4 young ladies that were literally standing there with their backs toward the door laughing and gossiping.  We were then completely ignored while the guests after us were greeted.  After one of the ladies finally acknowledge us after we walk up to her 5 minutes later we tell them we had called Wednesday (we ate here on Friday 8/10)  and we were to have a table at 7:30 ready for 14.  She turns around and tell us that she will have to speak to the manager.  I kid you not, 15 minutes pass by and all 4 ""hostess"" are still up front - 1 is busy flirting with a young co-worker while 1 is sitting on the bench laughing with the other 2.  We go up and another young lady to ask if our table was ready.  She says ""I'm not sure."" So we ask her if she can go check.  She does.  Finally at 8 p.m. we are shuffled over.   We had the pleasure of being served by Nick which was an excellent waiter.  He was patient and made sure he got our order right along with one of the other waiters.  Our food was delicious and Nick was great.  Additionally, the manager was kind enough to turn down the air vent directly on top of us and came by to check the temp was ok.  Unfortunately the customer service in the front of the house was not professional at all.  Also Management please make sure your female wait staff washes their hands when they leave the bathroom.  I saw 3 go in and walked right past me into the stalls and go straight out the door.  I have no idea if they used the restroom or not, but still - if you walk in there wash your hands!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est
Peter K.,"Atlanta, GA",47,412,125,2.0,2/25/2012,"I came here for lunch ordering the bottomless soup that comes with salad and bread. What I Liked - The soup options on a Thursday were broccoli cheese and chicken noodle. Both soups were decent. My personal opinion is Progresso's Chicken Noodle Soup is the industry standard for good chicken noodle soup (I know several people that disagree but it's just my opinion). Their chicken noodle soup is right on par. It has some good pieces of chicken meat and the broth is solid. The broccoli cheese is on par with most broccoli cheese soup's I've had. What I Didn't Like - They didn't have thousand island dressing for the salad. - The service took forever to come out. The people that came with me got burgers and my salad came out at the same time as their burgers. I would have expected the salads to come out first. - The soup came out way after the salad and after wanting my second soup, it took 4-5 minutes to get my second soup. There was just too much wait time in between, especially in the time window that I wanted to get my second and third soup. I understand that the waitresses are super busy but still, I'd prefer to be able to get in touch with my waitress a bit quicker than 5 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est
Bob P.,"Streamwood, IL",5,45,,2.0,4/30/2012,"Been there on a regular basis for the soup and salad for lunch for the past year.  Service is always interesting. Parts excel, and then staff gets distracted at key points. Often service is over attentive until it comes time for the check and getting the receipt/credit card slip.  Tried their new Reuben sandwich. Lots of good corned beef. Onions were not caramelized yet, and sandwich was not fully warmed up. Spoke to manager and appears that new product is still getting practiced in the kitchen.  Stripes game (loyalty card) has a terrible time getting actual card, or even seeing rewards beyond the free chips and salsa (fresh chips, salsa is very canned tasting).  The Iced tea is in small glasses and is weak by the time it is served over ice. Order refills early.  In summary, a typical 'fern' bar that has ok food with a lot of couponing (watch the expiration dates) with a wide range of food that is all ok. Better then normal in small town, not the best in larger metro areas, but works well for a wide range of tastes and those wanting 'safe' food and environment (read boring for many with any adventure in dining options). Sound system is small number of Bose speakers that leave it a little under powered. The mix is better then most spanning 50 years in an enjoyable fashion of many patrons as not being to 'lame' or to aggressive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est

The waiter tasted one of them with a straw and took them away. A few minutes later the manager walked up. I was thinking it was to apologize. No, it was to tell us if we reordered the drink again it would taste the same and it tasted nothing like a Long Island because it contained their ""special"" sour mix.  Mind you the drink was called a Blackberry Long Island and not a 1/2 and 1/2. The response was very passive aggressive & when we said that it was fine to keep our original order, he actually BROUGHT OUR ORIGINAL DRINKS BACK that were taken away from the table.  I am sorry, isn't that unsanitary and probably against the rules? After the manager tasted one (he didn't seem phased when we told him that either). YUCK. We were a little in shock.

I can't stand dry burgers and this one was dry and the flavor was bad. Some of the other people I was with had their pasta and that was actually decent, the ribeye which was pretty meh, maybe a little below, and then we had the Oreo dessert which to me was the only thing I actually liked, I don't know if its because I love Oreos or what, but it wasn't too sweet and it was nice and cold and crumbly.

I never have room for dessert but they look pretty tasty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est?start=20
Sarah D.,"Elgin, IL",1,13,,5.0,5/20/2010,Customer Service here is outstanding. I always try new dishes when I go and I have yet to be disappointed. The Sante Fe Salad is one of my faves!! I also love the sangria and margaritas.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hoffman-est?start=20
