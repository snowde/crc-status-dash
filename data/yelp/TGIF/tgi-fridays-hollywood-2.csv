Rick H.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,22,,4.0,4/8/2017,I have eaten here several times. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Food is always great. The managers at the Ft.

Dani M.,"Dallas, TX",0,6,,4.0,8/15/2016,"I went expecting horrible service and a chaotic environment based on previous reviews. I'm glad we stopped in because it was a good experience. We were a party of 3 and were seated immediately. Shay was our server and she did a fantastic job. She didn't come right away but within 5 minutes she was there and was attentive the remainder of the time and always with a smile on her face! The people writing bad reviews about the loudness, crappy service, and long wait times, etc must be going during peak times and/or super late at night as they are open until 2am. We went on a Saturday night at around 7:30/8:00pm and there was no DJ. They even had a lady walking around making balloons for the kids for tips. She made my daughter a beautiful unicorn! Maybe it was our server that made the experience better so ask for Shay, if she is working!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=40
Leslie M.,"Dania Beach, FL",56,1,,1.0,3/6/2017,"NEVER use the bathroom in TGI Fridays in the Oakwood Plaza. I told the manager that the bathroom was dirty and had period blood on the toilet seats and it needed to be cleaned. She went in there with gloves on and some brown paper towels. She had NO cleaning supplies in her hand. This long blonde haired heifer (who is the manager with a nasty attitude might I add) dispensed the foam soap that is placed there for hand washing, onto the brown napkin and wiped the toilet down. Wheeeere was the bleach, the Lysol spray, the toilet disinfectant, something??????? She nasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=40
Jason M.,"Hollywood, FL",6,71,15,1.0,9/6/2015,Walked in at 10pm on Sunday night. Plenty of tables and at least a 30 minute wait. No self seating at bar table even tho 3 were open. Waited 10 min and got a bar table. Waited 10 min and still not served or clean bar. Left without any acknowledgement. Saw female manager wandering around without much sense of urgency or direction.

Nicole V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",416,431,1047,3.0,4/25/2015,"I haven't been to Fridays in ages but when a client wanted to meet here for lunch, who was I to argue? The 2 of us were seated in a large booth but the table was so close on either side of the seat we had to squeeze in. I moved the table practically all the way to my abs (or what are supposed to be abs!) just so she could get in.  She is much shorter than I, so her boobs touched the table. I didn't want to complain since it was only my 2nd meeting with her, so I think we both pretended we were perfectly comfortable.   Our waitress was friendly and attentive.  My client ordered off their lunch menu- soup and fried shrimp.  I  had the black bean burger with mac n cheese instead of fries. The burger was topped with onions and sliced avocado.  It was tasty and the mac n cheese wasn't bad either.  When the food was delivered they brought out 2 burgers but I only ordered 1 so they took it back.   Our waitress presented our check and I rarely look at my bill but when I saw the total was $30+ for 2 lunches and water, I was a little suspicious. I was charged for the 2 burgers. I brought it to her attention and it was quickly rectified. I don't think it was intentional just an oversight.  It was typical American fare but not worth rushing back for.  P.s. I managed to get out of the booth after eating!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=40
Joy L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1147,328,1776,3.0,1/23/2014,"Oh T.G.I. Friday`s you and fantastic memories go hand-in-hand like two giddy school girls in pigtails skipping towards their favorite ice cream shop:   Parties of 15+ early twenty some-thing's, BFF's chattering aspirations of future ventures...   Sharing hopes and dreams and good laughs.  Servers singing ""Happy Birthday"" off key and out of tune.  And everyone thinking it was a hoot! Who cared if the service wasn't stellar? We never thought this was Barton G's. Just a decent place to get some food before heading out to the movies.  Besides, we were having a party!  Coming to T.G.I. Friday's one should not expect the type of service that you would get at a boutique or  high-end restaurant. Thinking this way will only lead to a bad experience as certainly much rests on expectations. The servers are green just getting their foot in the door before they move on to better things.  The service can often be slow, or too fast, or too pushy- or not pushy enough.. not quite on the money, but never overwhelmingly upsetting.   They aren't rude or smell funky.  They mean well, and aren't ever offensive.   The food is for the most part a 5 on a scale of 1-10.  There isn't anything horribly or extra special, just middle of the pack.  But they are open late night, they have drink specials, offer meal deals, there's enough space for a baby cart, the bathrooms are pretty clean and they have enough space for large LOUD PARTIES!  Sure you can go to a swanky club at SoBe and drop 3K on your B'day, but that's not everyone's price point. Try the brownie with a shot of Bailey's - it's a pretty fantastic mix of sweet and scandal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=40
Ed H.,"Salem, OR",2,16,3,2.0,2/16/2015,"As a traveler, TGI Friday's has always been a ""safe haven"" - good atmosphere, service, and predictable food. Dropped by this one after arriving in Ft. Lauderdale, and finally had someone take notice after nearly 10 minutes at the bar.  One bartender was too busy hitting on the women in the other side of the bar (who arrived well after I did), kitchen help was behind the bar getting himself something to drink. When I was finally served (I got ribs), I had to ask for ketchup for my fries, and wet wipes for my fingers. Worst restaurant customer service experience I've had in years.  I think I'll skip TGI Fridays in the future and go to Chilis or something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=40
Ann P.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,45,10,3.0,2/9/2016,"Got an appetizer plate, 3 potato skins, 4 pot stickers and a bunch of boneless wings. Potato skins had very little piece of cheese and a small piece of bacon. Pot stickers were the bedt, the boneless wings had a very bland sauce.

Taylor W.,"Portland, OR",1,8,1,2.0,12/16/2014,Josh the bar tender is not  a nice person.  Completely rude and degrading.  I work right next to this place and probably will never go back just for the way Josh spoke to me and my friend.   He is no good at customer service and doesn't know how to take a joke.  Go to Friday's but avoid them at the bar if Josh is working. Even after weeks of avoiding.  One night I decided to go in. Of coarse the dreaded bar tender was there.   He made it a point to comment on my negative YELP review.  Guess what dude if you weren't rude and treated all your costumers equality you wouldn't have a bad yelp review.   Just saying.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=40
Madison B.,"Miami, FL",104,69,32,2.0,1/9/2015,"Wow, the service here is the worst. It never fails, every time I come here for lunch, I can bet on spending at least an hour in a half at this location. And I consider myself a fast eater!  The food is standard TGI Friday flare; consistent in terms of flavor and portion size with every other TGI Friday restaurant I've ever been to. But the experience is always overshadowed by the lack of service. The lack of urgency from the staff, especially during the workday lunch hour, is very disheartening.

Clarissa K.,"Hollywood, FL",2320,538,2075,2.0,12/30/2015,"It has been awhile since I was here last. On a positive note the inside is renovated again that opens up the bar area to the restaurant. As for the menu it is in a book which makes no sense to have such an extensive menu. I ordered potstickers app as a main course  my husband and step don shared the artichoke dip. For dinner my step son had a burger and my husband a French dip. Was the food exceptional or memorable no. It was just fast food served in a restaurant setting. My husband ordered a specialty Long Island ice tea asked the server if it was good but since he was in training he did not know. It didn't taste good so the drink was sent back and he had a bottled bud instead. The $8.50 was credited in check and I was surprised a domestic beer was $4.50 each. We probably will not return again as it was not great experience food was frozen,micro waved, and served.

M D.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",70,21,3,1.0,5/31/2014,"Unlike everyone else on here, I did get pretty good service. I was at the bar with my guy and we were well taken care of. HOWEVER...ROACHES. Sadly, after we ate, we saw a small roach on the bar. I ended up killing it. I looked over to my left and saw two more, larger ones. One was on someone's food and another was crawling on the bar. We promptly pointed out the critters, paid our bill and got the hell out of there.  I can deal with a lot of things service-wise and food-wise, but roaches are a no-go. Seriously, if you're like me and my guy and want to watch the NBA finals and enjoy good drinks, head across the parking lot to Dave & Buster's.

Dewey C.,"Hallandale Beach, FL",180,256,2126,3.0,12/3/2014,"This place brings back memories of my youth. I have been coming to this chain since they opened and developed a craving for the Jack Daniel's Sauce they put on the burger and ribs. They also keep up with the time and offer little deals allthetime, in fact, I had to bar them from an email address I got so many STRIPES OFFERS. The food is of the ""finger and toy "" variety, but that's OK for this kind of a joint. It's not as much fun at the bar as Big Daddy's and the food is not as good, but for what it is, I still like it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=40

I came with a large group of about 7-8 people, so I would understand if that made my order come a little slow. I only wanted one thing - a small order of wings with ranch. As everyone received their food and drinks, I had to resort to eating of my uncle's plate. Everyone else got appetizers and entrees, and all I wanted were the wings I've been waiting over an hour for. When the waitress came up with the bill, I told her I had not gotten my food at all. She went to check what happened and gave me some excuse I could care less to hear. Because of their mistake, they did not charge me for my wings. Now, here's the kicker...when I went home with my food (because everyone else was done eating by the time I received it), instead of flats with ranch, they gave me soggy boneles chicken with bleu cheese.

Ingrid B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,111,3,1.0,4/18/2014,I've been a longtime Fridays customer but regrettably have found that each visit gets a bit worse. Too bad.  To start the hostess selected a dark and inaccessible table - and one of our party was in a wheelchair. That merits a lousy table?  Fortunately we moved to a table near a window.  Waiter was very friendly but the food was cold. New plates took a long time to come out.  There's a real disconnect between the wait staff and the kitchen.

Brittany M.,"Plantation, FL",213,137,21,1.0,10/5/2013,"Woahhhh Fridays! What happened to you?! I'll admit, this is one of those restaurants we settle for, but it's never been this BAD. Let me explain why, shall I? 1. The appetizers. Oh, the appetizers.  I was starving so it was my idea to order the pick three whatever it's called. Pick three but you HAVE to pick boneless or traditional wings? We chose potstickers and loaded potato skins for the other two choices. I believe there are about five disappointing appetizers to chose from. The traditional wings were small. So were the potato skins. They were the children of Papa Potato! It seriously looked like they picked them before they were fully grown. The potstickers weren't small, but they were dry. There wasn't one winner on that awful plate. It was expensive too! 12 something!  2. The entrees.  I ordered the chicken and shrimp cajun pasta. Gross. The chicken was unacceptable. I felt sorry for that poor bird who had gone to waste. It didn't even taste like chicken. Maybe it wasn't? It had no flavor whatsoever but he pasta was covered in oil, of course. The only good thing about that dish were the 5 shrimps it came with.  Hubby ordered the bacon cheddar burger. The picture was enticing but looked nothing like it, unfortunately. The onion ring was shriveled up, the cheese looked dry, the bacon was burnt, and although the waitress asked ""pink or no pink"" and he clearly stated he wanted medium rare, that sucker was WELL WELL done. And the fries? Stale and flavorless. I wasn't surprised at this point.  3. The service.  This is a huge pet peeve of mine. Horrible waitresses that look like they not only hate their job, but life itself.  She had no personality, and looked annoyed to be taking our order. She hardly checked up on us and it took foreverrrrr to order!  Sorry, Fridays, but you are no longer one of our ""okay let's just settle for this"" restaurants. Bye bye PS... I wouldn't order Captain Morgan if you're in the mood for a drink. It was definitely NOT Captain...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=60
AE S.,"Harper Woods, MI",0,4,,1.0,8/2/2016,"My friend and I had just come home from a cruise and were starving.  We were seated right away and our waiter was quick to bring our pop.  The pop didn't taste right so the waiter exchanged it immediately.  This was the ONLY positive to our visit.  After ordering I was brought my meal first.  About 10 minutes later my friend, who was getting upset, called over the waiter who said her meal was on its way out.  We waited another 10 minutes before my friend got up and asked the hostess to get the manager. (The waiter never came back to the table to check on us.)  My friend explained that I had received my 20 minutes prior and she was still waiting, but she no longer wanted the food.  The manager apologized and went back and got her food.  Again, my friend explained how upset she was and that she didn't want her food.  The manager said her meal was on the house.  I asked for my check and a box for my food.  Our waiter came back, asked me if I wanted a take out drink, handed me my takeout box, and NEVER acknowledged my friend who was sitting there with an empty glass and no food.  He never apologized, just pretended as if she wasn't there.  The manager again came back to the table with my friends food in a take out container, apologized again and said she would take care of both our checks.  As I was packing up my food the waiter brought me my check.  REALLY???  Don't they talk.  This was a horrible experience and needless to say, we will not be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=60

Vick O.,"Hollywood, FL",135,51,153,1.0,5/27/2014,"I'm going to be brutally honest on this. First of all,  upon arrival, the host was no where to be found.  We waited a little long and all the servers or bartenders didn't even bother to welcome us let alone sit us down.  Just very poor management,  and lack of hospitality. The place had gone a new make over but I'm not feeling their new looks.  I prefer the way it was before.  When we were seated,  host told us the server will be right out shortly in a moody tone kind of brushing us off. He basically placed the menu and took off before we were even seated.  That's already several red flags and at this point we don't even feel like eating there anymore.   Server didn't come out shortly as promised.  We still had to wait longer. She took our drinks and also our food order since we use the time to figure out what we want.  Waiting time was decent.  When the food come,  I enjoyed it.  Surprisingly,  my steak came out the way I ordered.  Service wasn't that attentive though.  Plus,  my friend was waiting for a refill on his beverage which the server forgot after telling him she was going to get it.  Overall,  I was satisfied with everything BUT their poor customer service and bad management with the staff.  Especially the host.  If you're always in the back, how are you going to see and know when customers come. Unprofessional. Also if you're a host and wants to play with your phone texting your friends, at least do it in a slick manner. Don't have your phone out like you're on break. I will not be back.  I prefer ale house across the street.  Service is a lot  better there. In my opinion,  just a simple hi how are you is enough to acknowledge guests.  You won't get that kind of friendly service there.  At least with that particular host.  Vent done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=80

GK C.,"Hollywood, FL",0,9,,2.0,12/23/2015,"First of all, fast food? There was a long wait just to get food, of that quality. The restaurant was much nicer than a fast food restaurant, though. We went on Tuesday, when kids eat free (the other restaurant in the area was the same deal). I wouldn't have paid for the meal. The kids menu was much, much more limited than the regular one. I ordered some sliders and a side salad. The sliders were blackened around the outside, there was barely any cheese, and I almost lost a tooth on how hard it was. The salad looked and tasted premade. On the other hand, the adults in our party enjoyed their meals, and they were much better quality then ours. Well, it was food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=80

When we first walked in there was no host to greet us, we just stood there along with a whole bunch of ppl that were also waiting to be seated. Finally a waiter came up to us and said the host was in the back preparing tables and will be right with us, when she finally came she was not friendly at all. Her whole demeanor was as if she didn't wanna be there. Our waiter was a sweetheart BUT kept forgetting to bring us what he asked for, AND to make matters worst he really messed up on my order. I had to send it back, I ordered a burger with no pickles and tomatoes and he bought it to me with everything that I didn't want in it. He also bought my daughter honey mustard sauce for her chicken fingers after we told him BBQ, when we finally bought that up to his attention he kept walking pass our table attending to everyone else and still FORGOT to return back with the BBQ sauce. When the bill finally came I couldn't believe that they tried to CHARGE me TWICE for the same burger! They messed my order up and I sent it back but yet they wanted me to pay for it!

Steve N.,"Hollywood, FL",2,3,,1.0,2/15/2015,Fridays used to be the best but we were down to this location as the last good Fridays.  Today it joined the rest of them as substandard. I ordered takeout from there as we have many times in the past. When I got the food home the tostado nachos were completely charred black and just piled in the container on top of each other the condiment containers thrown in on top of the food. The mozzarella sticks were ice cold and the marinara sauce was cold too. When I drove all the way back to the restaurant to have them fix the order they apologized and brought a new order that again was just piled into a take out container.  I'm afraid that I will not be returning to TGI Friday's again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=80

Meli T.,"Pompano Beach, FL",35,5,,1.0,4/6/2015,"If I could give less than one star for this location, I would. I have been a customer of this particular location for over 12 years. I loved it so much to the point that even though I moved to Pompano Beach, I would still drive all the way to Hollywood for Fridays. My last 2 visits here were atrocious! Last night took the cake! I'd been celebrating my 30th birthday all weekend and wanted to end it with dinner at Fridays with my family. I should've left immediately after being seated. The Host(?) that seated us was awful. He did not speak a single word to us. When we were led to a table he simply pointed for us to sit. The table hadn't even been bused yet and the floor was covered with food underneath! He set our menus down (which is how we knew he REALLY was going to sit us there). My husband asked if he could please have someone clear the table and sweep the food off the floor. The guy rolled his eyes and moved us to a less dirty table. The prior patrons checks were still on the new table. The ""Host"" picked them up and we sat down. Luckily I keep some disinfectant wipes in my purse. No one cleaned the table so we did it ourselves. The waitress was inattentive. We had to ask for everything! Napkins, bleu cheese for our wings appetizers (we got the pick 3), utensils for my son, refill on my soda and water for my son, it was awful. When the plates came back for the appetizers, they actually had black, dirty water on them. My husband asked for new plates, which seemed to be an inconvenience. ""New"" plates came out, still slightly wet as if a rag had been passed over the top plate and had a particle of food on it. We asked another waitress passing by for new plates because these were still wet and dirty. This seemed like an inconvenience for her too. Again, the SAME plates were brought out. How do we know they were the same? Because the top plate had a distinct chip on it. It was the same chip in the same location all 3 times. The dinner was awful. My son had the chicken skewers with pita and broccoli (he LOVES broccoli). The chicken was somewhat edible. Broccoli was gross. It tasted very old. (When I saw my son wasn't enjoying his food like he usually does, my husband and I both tasted it) I had the JD ribeye with mashed potatoes and the tomato/mozzarella salad. The steak was tough and very salty, mashed potatoes were dry, and the tomatoes were waaayyyyyyyyyy over ripe. They were soft and wrinkled. I love caprese salad....this was gross. I took 3 bites of my steak, 2 bites of potatoes, 1 tomato,  and one mozzarella. I left most of my food on the plate. My husband had the JD full rack ribs. Let's just say he had to cover it in ketchup to be able to eat it! We asked for the manager and he removed the appetizer from our bill (the only  thing we actually ate!) We tipped because they have to make a living. We usually tip 20% or more depending on how happy we are with our service. They used to have a waitress named Andrea about 10 years ago who was amazing! We always tipped her 50% (on bills of $100+) because she was fantastic! The girl from last night got 13%....and that's only because it would round up our total to $60. I will never...EVER go to Fridays again. Not to ANY location! Food and service has deteriorated immensely!! Stay clear of them!!!!

Heck, go out and buy a lottery ticket because you must be one in a million.  I told the server the burger was horrible. His response was, ""Good to know.""  Duncan, I'm sorry you obviously don't care about your job and that's fine with me.  Can I have a different server then?  This was honestly the worst hamburger I've had. It's the type of hamburger that makes Burger King taste gourmet. My dinner companion took a bite and told me he thought it was ""disgusting.""  He said, ""It almost ruined burgers for me, completely.""  I could barely eat 1/2 of it.

We waited an hour for our server (Bradley) to even bring the food and when my French dip arrive I could have swore they just went to a 7/11, bought a little sand which, threw it in the microwave and served it to me. After waiting an hour for my food, I didn't want to reorder considering I would have to wait another hour to eat. Please avoid if you want to eat a decent meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=20
Kyle M.,"Miami, FL",230,207,3085,1.0,9/12/2015,"I hadn't been to a Fridays in a few years & this visit quickly reminded me why I had steered clear for so long. We walked in with a sizable party to celebrate a birthday so we waited while a table was ready. This wasn't peak hours, it was well after 10pm on a Thursday so the place wasn't packed or anything. Once we were seated, we waited... & waited... until eventually we flagged down a server. One of the guys in our party decided he was going to order to-go in the hopes he could get his food quicker. The waitress laughed & told him that it would make no difference as all of our orders were being placed at the same time.  Fast forward 25 minutes later when his food was given to him. He had ordered quite a bit of food & yet it was here & ready. We wait... & wait some more... one full hour after he had eaten his meal(he graciously shared with us as we sat starving) our food started to trickle in. With my luck, my order was wrong & I had to wait even longer for it to be replaced. After quite an extensive search, we were able to locate the manager on duty to explain the horrendous situation. We were told the order had been placed in the system wrong which caused the delay. I don't know whether this was the case but we took her word for it.  The manager brought a free dessert for our friends birthday & gave us a small break on the check which was a nice gesture. This is what a good manager is supposed to do when something like this occurs, I just wish she was easier to locate when everything was happening. Unfortunately, the damage was done. I don't think anyone in our party will ever return to a Fridays. This experience was a nightmare.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=20

Tessa M.,"Hollywood, FL",0,3,,5.0,8/28/2017,"I have always had the worst experience at this place. Please don't ask me why I kept coming back lol. But this time (August 28, 2017) was different! I mean, seriously, amazing service! Our server was Joseph and honestly for TGI Friday's he went above and beyond. Always smiling, never complaining, he gave us suggestions. He knew it was my moms birthday and got his crew to sing happy birthday anyway without us asking for it. Great customer service! This guy deserves great things! Thanks Joe! Hope you get to see this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=20
Andrea M.,"Alhambra, CA",65,6,2,2.0,3/8/2017,"I hate to complain. Friendly waitress and staff however not happy about the food and drinks... took a long time to get our waters. Asked for henny and strawberry, hardly any henny...if it was actually henny my sister couldn't tell. I got the French dip and the fries were barely warm, au jus broth was freezing cold. Only one small clump of bleu cheese on my sisters salad too. I always enjoyed tgifridays but I won't be visiting again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=20
Minie M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,23,22,1.0,9/4/2015,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE...STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION.  The bartender. Steven, had a bad attitude and even worse service. It took 20 minutes to get a glass of wine. The appetizer came out after the meal. The Manager, Heath Bloom, did a mumbled 'drive by' apology behind our back for Steven's bad service without even stopping. The rest of our meal was spent overhearing Steven tell other customers how bad the kitchen is. This location really needs to get it together. The chips were soggy (probably from sitting on the bar for a half hour), the steak fries were cold, the steak was over done (again probably from sitting around a while). The bathroom had paper towels everywhere on the cabinet and floor. EWE....This location has really take a dive. Judging from the other multiple one star reviews, they do not pay attention to their customers or social media!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=20
Joe L.,"Suwanee, GA",0,2,,2.0,5/16/2016,"Keep driving - wish I had.  Ordered boneless wings and a Cobb salad. Wings were only ok, but salad and lots of brown lettuce and was missing a few ingredients. When check came, wings were double what they should have been, special price not applied . Service was ok but not great by any stretch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=20

T P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",25,49,93,4.0,5/19/2016,Sometimes it's nice to see familiar restaurants when traveling.  We came here late after a tough day and with two active young boys we asked to be seated off the main dining room and they were able to accommodate and seat us right away.  Our server was patient and so helpful even with spilled milk.   My jack Daniels chicken was prepared as usual!

Karina L.,"East Side Costa Mesa, Costa Mesa, CA",69,1,,1.0,7/2/2017,Worst TGI Fridays I have ever been too!! The service was horrible! We were a party of 9 and all our food was cold! There was mistakes on our orders.  Our alcohol drinks had no alcohol (we ordered Mai Tais) they tasted like pineapple juice!  Coming from California her on vacation I have received a way better experience!! Did I mention one of us ordered the unlimited apps and it took 25 min to get the second one!!! Worst restaurant I have ever been too!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=20
Zo D.,"San Diego, CA",1,4,,1.0,6/2/2017,"Originally was told the wait was 20 mins after almost an hour we sat at a table. The waiter was nice and tried to be attentive but I'm not sure if he was very busy or just forgot about us at times. After we were seated we received our water 20 mins later because the restaurant ran out of clean dishes (???). Finally after another hour the food arrives...well at least most of our orders. Ranch dressing forgotten, seldom offers for drink refills...I am visiting this area but I will not be back to this Friday on any day. I'd like to order some type of dessert but with the services provided I'm not certain I'd get it before closing time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=20
Leya C.,"Queens Village, NY",1,34,50,3.0,4/7/2017,Came in last night for a take out order. After a night of studying was pretty hungry. I got back and was excited to eat but the half rack ribs that was suppose to come with my combo was missing. I called and the manager was of no help. She basically told me the kitchen was closed and nothing they can do. I went back tonight and Vinny was super helpful. I told him the issue and he took my receipt to head towards the back. In less than a minute he came out and said wait 10-15 minutes for your ribs. Within 10 minutes he saw I was waiting and automatically went to check. He then immediately came back out with my ribs and fries were now added. It was such an inconvenience to have to go back to Friday's but glad I was helped by Vinny. I would give less stars but the Jack Daniel's burger I also ordered last night was really good. Vinny thank you again and you deserve some type of recognition from Friday's! They are lucky to have you working here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-hollywood-2?start=20
