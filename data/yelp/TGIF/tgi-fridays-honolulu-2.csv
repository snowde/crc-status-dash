Linda M.,"Oakland, CA",3,113,8,5.0,5/22/2009,"I love TGI Fridays, I went nearly..... 3 years ago.... I had a chicken quesodilla, and it was amazing. I also had a cherry limeade and the people working there were really nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-honolulu-2
Ken G.,"San Francisco, CA",413,1652,37,1.0,11/17/2008,"Please avoid this spot...it's the epitome of overpriced, poor quality restaurants in Waikiki.  When my friends wanted to have lunch at this spot, I warned them that it was going to be awful and they didn't believe me...I enjoyed seeing their faces when we left since I could tell they left very unsatisfied with their meals.  We ordered a few different items: chicken strips with whiskey sauce, a chicken sandwich, sausage/chicken pasta and a burger...everything was really bad!  The chicken strips were dry and served at room temperature, the sandwich was served on very dry bread with even dryer chicken, the pasta dish was flavorless and the burger was nothing amazing.  To top it all off, the prices are dramatically higher than a typical TGI Fridays restaurant almost anywhere else. The staff was very nice and friendly, but the food was just way too awful...if you don't want to ruin your vacation, go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-honolulu-2
Brian H.,"Alexandria, VA",20,119,3,2.0,1/25/2007,This is sad.   I am actually the first person to admit to eating here...and I was here twice in one day. Does it sound better or worse to mention that my girlfriend and I spent more on alcohol here then food? How terrible.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-honolulu-2
