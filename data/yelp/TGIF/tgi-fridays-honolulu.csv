Teresa W.,"Los Angeles, CA",65,99,1,2.0,5/10/2007,"I was soo excited to come here b/c I've been wanting to come here for awhile but JW never wants to go with me. =(  I remember back during my college days...we used to go to TGIFriday's to drink and eat, and it was soo good back then.   Anyways I finally went the other week and was disappointed.  I ordered the French Onion soup and the Tuscan Portabello Melt sandwich; the soup was good but the sandwich was super oily.  It was so oily, I could not finish the whole sandwich.  My hands were soaked with oil, and my mouth and throat felt lined with oil.  Gross!  Besides my sandwich being nasty, the service was great! =)  The waiter was very attentive. Now I understand why JW doesn't want to go here...no need for me to come back anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-honolulu
