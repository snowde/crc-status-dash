Kathryn C.,"Houston, TX",48,177,204,2.0,3/8/2011,"Meh.  Went here with my husband.  The waitress took a lot longer than I'm used to to address our table (about 5/6 mins from sit down) and my drink didn't make it out until way after the soup was served (about 15 mins since sit down).  She didn't redeem herself either.  Not to mention, for the first 20 mins or so she visited our table twice, then was no where to be found in between, you know, while I was becoming impatient with the wait for my drink.  The potato soup and my chicken dish were decent but the experience left a sour taste in my mouth.  Maybe try takeout? *Edit:  After reading the previous reviewer, I remember that I too had to use a steak knife to cut my chicken, however, it wasn't nearly as dried out as his seemed to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-3
Dana C.,"Houston, TX",64,117,77,1.0,6/27/2011,"Restaurants like this scream suburbs to me. Incredibly mediocre, yet they still somehow keep enough people coming through their doors to stay in business. I've been here a number of times for various occasions and I've never been impressed. I've tried soups, hamburgers, the blackened chicken alfredo, and the smothered chicken - none of them being worthy of a rave review. I'm pretty sure they don't make anything from scratch here. This is just another Applebee's or Chili's with a different name on the building.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-3
Greg F.,"Houston, TX",549,327,48,2.0,5/23/2010,"Sunday late lunch, where to go, where to go:  Lets try TGI Fridays.  Ordered their special  5 cheese mac and cheese with ""juicy chicken breast"".  What arrives is something out of the Sahara Desert:  Dry chicken breast, with dried out pasta.  This was the only chicken breast I've ever had to use a steak knife on.  Pasta seemed to be ok, but ruined when they baked it - turned out dry on top, soggy on bottom.  Sadly, even though the server asked me how it was, and I said  Pathetic, she ""aww i'm sorry"".  WTF?  no chance to make it right, we'll toss in a desert, comp you an ice tea?  Nope.. off it went to the trash can where it deserves its final resting spot. Only savings was the music - a nice 80's mix of Phil Collins, REM and others - upbeat enough to help me forget this meal.  As if the place is already hard enough to get to , don't bother with it -- this place (at least for me) wasn't worth my time or money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-houston-3
