Kenneth S.,"TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY",46,59,,5.0,8/2/2016,Love this place.  Kids menu is great.  Jackie is awesome.  Jack Daniels steak is fairly priced and good.   Wine works.   Fun for the whole family!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station
Mary A.,"Amityville, NY",77,18,1,1.0,12/27/2016,"I wish I had read all of these horrible Yelp reviews before we tried to dine at this TGI Friday's yesterday. It was the day after Christmas and we had to make a return at Walt Whitman Mall. We were originally going to eat at a nicer restaurant, but had a craving for wings and opted for TGI Fridays instead. We usually love the endless apps and Jack Daniel's grill items. The restaurant seemed busy enough, but not slam packed like the mall. We waited a minute or two for other groups to be seated ahead of us, were led over to a table next to the kitchen that still had a spray bottle sitting on it from the quick wipe down. We asked for a different table and went upstairs. The decor is great and an interesting set up. This is where the compliments end, however. Our waitress Renee was very sweet and came over to introduce herself and take our drink orders. We received our teas promptly and placed an order for endless buffalo wings. We then put in an order for our entrees and waited. And waited. And waited. We looked at our watches to realize nearly an hour had passed since we walked into the restaurant. I could overhear the table behind us returning food to the kitchen for a third time due to an incorrect order. A few moments later, someone else asked the waitress for the manager. She walked over to ask us if we ever received our buffalo wings. We told her to go ahead and cancel our order since we'd probably receive it at the same time as our entrees and really wouldn't be able to take advantage of the ""endless"" portion of the deal. Maybe we ordered an endless wait instead? We couldn't find our server after that to let her know we weren't going to wait for our entrees any longer and left cash on the table to cover our drinks and a tip for her effort. I couldn't believe that no one thought to give us an update on our food being delayed or make anything but a half-hearted effort to excuse it. I usually love TGI Fridays, but now I'm not so sure I'll be returning- especially not to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station
Justin P.,"Wyandanch, NY",115,110,351,5.0,11/30/2015,"So I returned to this Friday's location and guess who was my server again? It was Jackie and once again she hit it out of the park. She just seems to be a naturally pleasant upbeat person. She represents the brand excellent. The food once again was good. You really can't go wrong with a jack Daniels burger or any of there appetizers. I ordered a mud slide once again and I have to tell you folks this was the best mudslide I have ever had at Friday's. Jack the bartender hooked me up. It's all in the hands. One person can make the same drink and yet when someone like Jack makes it, it turns out next level. This is still my favorite Friday's for food and if Jack keeps it up this will turn into the best Friday's bar.* All said and done this location has good food and great people. * Thank you Jackie and Jack for providing excellent costumer service keep up the excellent work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station
Brad B.,"San Diego, CA",4916,964,1518,3.0,4/6/2016,"""Hey, I have an idea. Let's go somewhere really Long Island."" - Ruggy's famous last words.  After this statement we ended up at TGI Friday's with a commitment to eat only the endless appetizers that they've been promoting on TV. We would not stray and we'd eat till we felt sick... literally.  The good: Ummmm... let's create another category as ""good"" simply does not apply. The alright: The boneless wings, undressed with sauce on the side. Surprisingly the PB&J was a nit with our group, with the ghost pepper coming in a close second for me. Not nearly hot enough but I suppose these mega-chains have to temper things like this for the average Joe. The bad: The potato skins. Remember these things? They were (and maybe still are) a signature item for the TGIF franchise. My buddy drew said it best: ""tasted like we popped into the supermarket, bought TGI Friday's microwavable meals and served them."" Dead on.  The ugly: The tostada should not be served to anyone or anything. Soggy and small with a flavor combo that was baffling. Simply put, disgusting. If you decide to jump into the endless app pool stay away from these suckers. Just a bad, bad, bad idea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station
Drew A.,"Hicksville, NY",4790,1076,5766,2.0,4/4/2016,"Some highs and lows at my first visit to Friday's in quite some time... Highs: * Our server was sweet and constantly put our orders in so we always had food at the table * Endless. Apps. $12. * Chicken fingers, fried green beans & potstickers Lows: * The rest of the food... tasted like we popped into the supermarket, bought TGI Friday's microwavable meals and served them. Stay away from the spinach dip (an old favorite), the mozz sticks (sad) and the skins (what happened here?). A serious warning for the tostada, don't eat it. It's... slimy.  * Most of the sauces had a film over them. Not great.  * Bathroom was unclean Could you have fun here during happy hour with cheap drinks and unlimited chicken fingers? Sure!

The server said he'd get us another order, we respectfully declined and went to a different restaurant.  Lesson learned, don't ever trust a restaurant is clean based off of its chain name.

Glenn K.,"Melville, NY",443,270,4971,1.0,12/14/2015,"Going to start by saying, chain restaurants are not my thing. I have not been in a TGIF in roughly 10 years... Now I remember! All this food is frozen, quickly thawed and thrown on a grill or microwaved, second worst steak I have ever eaten next to a Bob Evans in PA when no other restaurant was around for miles, but that is a different story.  Kali our server was very friendly, a transport from California, and most efficient with taking our order.  (Kali from Cali) very sweet, move on to something better.  This restaurant is missing customers, at 6pm there were 8 in the whole restaurant. The music was way to loud and the servers were dancing throughout the place with nothing else to do. I ordered a bottle of a Cabernet but Kali came back to say they were out, so settled on a Malbec that was fair... Bottle retails for 8.00, they sell for 25.00 Wouldn't be here, but I was greedy and received a buy one entree and get one free, so I went for it... Not again, these are processed foods with very high sodium contents and I'm sure abundance of GMO's. My fault, won't be falling for this again.

Ashley V.,"Hicksville, NY",0,5,3,1.0,12/27/2016,"Absolutely terrible experience at this Friday's location tonight.  It was so bad that while there I thought ""this is so bad, I'm going to check reviews maybe it's just an off night.""  Sure enough numerous negative reviews came up.  For starters,  we go to Friday's often, (Westbury or Levittown) so often that we got gift cards as a Christmas gift.  We figured we'd use one tonight and wow, what a mistake. Both the service and food were horrible.  We were standing there waiting to be seated not being acknowledged when it wasn't even busy.  Finally, we get acknowledged and she runs off to check the upstairs booths.  Then another angry woman comes over irritated to seat us.  We were not even greeted by her or spoken to!  Our waitress couldn't have been more unpleasant or less knowledgeable if she tried.  She was blatantly irritated to answer simple questions such as ""what kind of wing sauces are available?"" The sauce on the wings was not what we asked for.  The pot stickers were stiff and the BBQ flatbread was clearly burnt. This experience may turn us off from one of our favorite go to restaurants.  Save yourself the trip and money and do NOT go here!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station
Kona K.,"Huntington Station, NY",11,281,2,1.0,12/31/2015,"IF YOU ARE ON YOUR iPHONE RIGHT NOW AND THIS IS THE FIRST THING YOU ARE LOOKING UP -- DO NOT GO HERE (unless you are going for alcohol & then maybe an appetizer or 2.)            Applebee's & Ruby Tuesday are very close by- go there instead. There is also a White Castle up the road. And for just few dollars more --per person-- there is a Cheesecake Factory on the other side of the mall. IF YOU ARE A SMALL RODENT or SEAGULL do not even EAT OUT OF THE DUMPSTER of TGIF at this location! Go around to the Panera Bread dumpster on the other side of the mall.  ************************************************************************** I have not been here in YEARS. (This location OR any other TGIFs)  In the ""crap-chain"" restaurant race;  I have found-- Applebee's is the ""best"" (appetizers are excellent - sometimes) , with Ruby Tuesday as ""second best"" (their salad bar truly sucks however) and this .... TGIF ( That Gross Icky Food) rates DEAD last. (Well- with me. Obviously the ""gerbils of the Long Island dining society"" love this place-- always packed 24/7. WTF? Why? Was Olive Garden closed ? )   *  _______12:00 lunch / noon holiday season of 2015._____________ * With friends & family (it was THEIR choice to come here--not mine)  Ordered a convoluted chicken & shrimp combo. Now it was $16.00-- so I guess it was NOT the ""lunch menu"" but the regular dinner menu? ? ? ? Photo in menu was BIG & looked GREAT !  My co-eaters ordered ""light"" (always discomforting when YOU are STARVING and they aint) LOL.  Anyway....... The Chicken & Shrimp dish arrived to my place at the table....... You know that feeling you get when someone pees on your grave?  Yeah. That's how I felt. (I SO HOPE THE MANAGER IS READING THIS because that's one of my favorite jokes in my collection)  My  plate was huge and the ""food"" only took up about 35% of the plate area. LOTS OF EMPTY SPACE on the plate.  * If I was on a diet this would have been perfect!*  The ""shrimp"" were SMALL -- they were not-even one inch in diameter ones- (you know, the type that cost $6.99 for a giant bag at Target or Wal-Mart. ) They were in a marinara sauce & cheese on the bottom (why not on top ? One wonders). You could fit this portion of the dish in the PALM OF YOUR HAND and still have extra hand room!  The ""chicken"" portion was hard and rubberized. It was obvious that it was a chicken breast section that was frozen- then microwaved (WAY TOO MUCH) to defrost it- then grilled for 2 minutes to FOOL me. It was very very very hard to cut because it was so rubbery (sorry to use the ""rubber"" food texture cliche -- I'm late for work right now) . It was also SMALL- also would fit in the palm of your hand - with extra room in the said hand. It came with a SMALL side of mashed potatoes - tasted OK but for the love of God- why not pad out the too-small dish with LOTS of mashed potatoes?  Make the damn plate look good!  Make it look like I'm getting my money's worth!  I worked in a kitchen in the early 1980s. At the end of the evening - I always had a HUGE tray of mashed potatoes that went right into the garbage--so I know this is an expendable side dish (just like rice & pasta) . Again PAD THE F**KER OUT WITH SOMETHING -- ANYTHING to not make the dish look so f**king skimpy God Dammit !  I was sooooo going to send this back but I hate doing this;  1) out of courtesy to my dining partners. No need to make a happy table uncomfortable & pause for me to get my new food back . And 2) Who knows what they will spit up in my food ( the replacement meal). Not worth it. That's why God made Yelp.  Dinner ,     soda,    tax,    tip     (service was fine)      =     $23.00    (aprox.)

Brandie E.,"West Babylon, NY",93,62,5,1.0,5/5/2015,"We have been going to this particular location for pretty much as long as it has been open and have never encountered such poor management/lack of customer service by the manager (who refused to give me his name and last name multiple times).  All our entrees did not come out together and our waitress didn't tell us why and then forgot to go check on the food when she walked by our table and asked where the 3rd entree was while ours sat getting cold. One of my companions got up to try to find a manager and ended up having to ask a busboy to send him over. The manager arrived and the distaste for our inquiry about the food could not have been MORE apparent if he tried. He seemed like we were a complete inconvenience to be asking to speak to him and he could not have cared less that we were having an issue. We actually said to him that he just seemed to not care in the slightest bit, at which point he rattled off a list of possible solutions to us like he was reading out of a book.  At that point it wasn't even about the food, but about this man's attitude, which seriously needs readjusting. He needs to be send back to customer service class because he has zero regard for the needs of the customer, from his body language to his bored tone like you were lucky you were getting to speak to him. Thanks to his obnoxious attitude, we won't be returning to this location. You know the manager is useless and rude when even the guy opening the door and seating people apologizes for what has happened. Wow.  We also ended up with 3 servers for some reason - one who took over after our original waitress, and then another who dropped the check off to us while practically running past us . . . totally checked out staff who didn't care that we were having a poor experience. Thumbs down in a huge way. That said, so long as you don't have to deal with that guy and his attitude, the bacon mac n cheese bites are yummy. I still find it annoying that this location calls it a pick-three when wings are preselected for you and you only actually get to ""pick"" 2 items. It's not like this at all their locations and I wish they would change this. All the Jack Daniel's items are so yummy even if they are so unhealthy. It's a shame we didn't get to try the sizzling chicken after all that drama, nor did any of us finish our food since we lost our appetites with the attitude.

I asked for my steak to be cooked medium rare and of course, it came well done with cold mashed potatoes NO shrimp and no macaroni and cheese.

James B.,"Melville, NY",3,11,6,4.0,5/16/2014,"I really hate to admit it, but I think that this TGI Friday's in Huntington Station may have turned a corner.  It has improved immensely since we visited them over a year ago. However, now for the caveats.  First off, we ordered a ""premium"" entree.  Second, because we were TGIF members, we used a buy one get one free entrée promotional email coupon.  Third, this particular Friday's is located within an area that has experienced a huge growth in available casual dining options during the past eight or nine months.  The Walt Whitman Shopping Centre location now offers significantly more options than they had before.  Therefore, Friday's, as one of the original three casual dining establishments in the area, has had to step up their game else be crushed by the competition. That being said, I believe we hit the jackpot at this particular location.  Because we were card carrying members the TGIF club or whatever it is they call it, they gave us complimentary chips and salsa.  It wasn't an overly generous portion, but I tell you, these were no flimsy, salty, greasy, chips with catchup sweet salsa.  Oh no, my friends.  These were strips of chips that were thick enough to qualify as Tostitos Gold chips (see the photo).  The salsa was noticeably improved as well.  It was clean and fresh tasting and free of the sugar and corn syrup from the old concoction.  You could actually taste the onion in it too. For the entrees, we ordered Jack Daniels meals ... I ordered the Flat Iron Steak, my wife ordered the Shrimp and Chicken Breast.  The shrimp was meaty with a crunchy coating, the chicken was succulent and tasty.  This was clearly, not the chicken typically used in their Parmesan Chicken dish. The Flat Iron Steak was as close to the best I've ever eaten.  It had a great taste and was tender enough to cut with a fork.  The tomato and mozzarella salad had small crisp grape tomatoes and was actually quite tasty.  I had the standard fries as well and, while they were great tasting, they were slightly on the limp side. To sum up, it was an unexpected and pleasant surprise.  But, as I said before, it was a premium entry.  If anyone wants to roll the dice and try one of standard entrees, please do so and post your review as well.  I'm curious to see if you were as satisfied as I.   Take care!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station

It took at least 15 minutes for our drinks, which seems way too long considering half the place was empty, and there were only a few people at the bar.

Jon G.,"Huntington Station, NY",40,36,2,1.0,10/12/2015,We had went there with my mother-in-law and my son during the beginning we had one of my sons food to come out first when my food son arrived it was cold the bun was hard the fries were stale and the chicken was cold at which point we told the waiter she had taken it back to the kitchen 30 minutes later when our food had came out we're still waiting for my son's food in which case she asked oh you wanted another plate for him seeing as though he never eaten I suggested yes that would be a great idea.  My sons second round of food appeared to be the same food just set on the kitchen counter for another 30 minutes we had the manager come over and since there were three complaints at the same time both our table and two other tables next to us had our meal free of charge however we didn't eat we left and we went to a local restaurant beware of this restaurant the service is her horrible and the staffing is worse.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=20
Pat W.,"Medford, NY",4,31,17,3.0,4/17/2014,So at 7 pm on a saturday it was a 15-20 minute wait for 2 people..not bad. I liked the atmosphere and the decor is Americana...It can get kinda loud but i actually like that because i hate to whisper over dinner. I had the jack daniels chicken and cajun shrimp....i have to say i thought the serving size was the kids plate.. or the plate was massive and the 8 cajun shrimp and the tiny chicken breast  got lost in it. I ordered lime slaw but it came in a tiny dixie cup size container ..guess i expected more. Nothing blew me away and i was left wanting a bit more of the jack daniels sauce .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=20
Manny F.,"Oyster Bay, NY",1,4,1,1.0,12/21/2014,"Making a burger isn't supposed to be a challenge. Tonight, some coworkers and I decided to visit this restaurant. There were 8 of us and we all had simple orders. Nothing modified. It took about 30 minutes for appetizers to arrive and 15 minutes later the entrees showed up. I asked for a medium well burger and it arrived crispy and charred. The fries were cold. One of my colleagues didn't get to eat at all. The waitress should've had some help. The manager could've pitched in or done something. Nope. He didn't even bother to stop by and address our party after waiting an hour to eat overcooked and lukewarm food. Next time we'll be going to Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=20
Derek D.,"Stamford, CT",50,168,120,3.0,1/27/2014,"I'm reviewing a chain...okay then. Anyway, the only thing I REALLY like at TGI Friday's is the Jack Daniels menu (seriously, that sauce is addicting).  I ordered the steak and shrimp and it hit the spot. Washed it down with a Strawberry Daiquiri and all was well in the world.  I was trying to avoid Friday westbound traffic on the LIE so I went there pretty early to kill time...like 5:30pm or so. The crowd there was of the geriatric variety along with a few families.  Best of all, it didn't make my stomach sick after...a definite plus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=20
C K.,"Redwood City, CA",4,21,3,1.0,9/8/2013,"This place has become a joke. Slow service, mediocre food at best, sticky tables, and awful tasting draft beers.  Even my crackers for my soup were stale.  Hey look at that... just got my check and they charged me for an extra beer!  Yay!  There are plenty of places to eat in Huntington. Just go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=20
Catherine C.,"Huntington Station, NY",0,22,,1.0,9/25/2015,Food is poor quality and not fresh. Stopped going there a while ago. Typical restaurant chain food. Such crap food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=20
Grace L.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",1,3,2,1.0,7/11/2015,This place is horrible. The waiters are great but the food is really bad. Everything is burnt.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=20
Metzgie M.,"Islip Terrace, NY",19,59,,3.0,6/17/2013,"Business associate requested we meet there for lunch last Friday.  Sat at the bar - that is my modus operandi. I expect nothing more than eating at Friday's when I go to Friday's.  It is what it is.  Tough to disappoint me when I know what I am about to do to myself. But wait!  There is more!!  They have upgraded their taps, and now serve craft beer.  What a solid move.  Very easy way to get a guy like me to head over there for a quick lunch.  The same guys that distribute Bud and Coors distribute the good stuff - bully to Fridays for manning up and getting Dogfish Head.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=20
Lori M.,"Huntington Station, NY",17,56,,3.0,8/28/2015,Food was very good and I am pleased as a stripes members with the rewards they offer. However the SERVICE IS HORRENDOUS. The manager was very nice and apologized for the poor service. They need to get more experienced wait staff in there to make things better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=20
Scott R.,"Manhattan, NY",2,74,3,3.0,8/20/2013,"This place has seen better days at this location.  Food is average.  Price is average.  I feel like it is overall average.   The restaurant used to be in much better condition and used to be very crowded.  I am not sure that it is anymore, and that's for a reason.  There are better restaurants around to go to!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=20
Walter M.,"Huntington, NY",0,3,,2.0,10/11/2014,"A step above fast food.  Jack Daniels selections are good, as well as the tower of appetizers.  However, beer was served warmer than room temperature. Should have stuck with a soda at least it's served with ice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=20
Bobbylou R.,"Huntington Station, NY",0,3,,4.0,3/19/2015,"I have not been to TGi Fridays in so long.  We were there this past Sunday. I was having a bad day and we wanted to grab a drink and a quick bite to eat. To my surprise there was a DJ there!  He was playing awesome tunes from Rock to Pop!  He had the most awesome Motown Progressive mix! Apparently he is there on Fridays too.  The food was good, my margartia was great and DJ Moose turned my crappy day into a happy one.  I will definitely be back for the music.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=20
Franco C.,"Oyster Bay, NY",828,2232,20,3.0,10/21/2008,"Chain Restaurant. As Friday's go, this one is pretty decent.  This Fridays has been here for a long time- and it has always been packed out to the best of my memory - cha ching! Back when I used to work in the area, this was almost always the start of the Friday happy hour doings but these days I tend to go much less. They serve up the standard Fridays fare- you pretty much know the drill here. Big but not big enough parking lot on both sides.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-huntington-station?start=20
