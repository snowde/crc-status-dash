Jamie Y.,"South Bend, IN",37,87,780,4.0,11/19/2017,"For being your typical, franchisee location, it wasn't too bad. This is my first time visiting at TGI Fridays in years, probably over 10 years. We visited during the lunch hour and although their regular menu can be pricey for just lunch they do you have a limited lunch menu. This is what we ordered from, and although there are only two options you can get lunch for $8. This included your choice of either a side salad, Caesar salad, or mozzarella sticks and a half sandwich or macaroni and cheese. We also ordered the potato skins as an appetizer and these are pretty good. Although pricey for lunch at just a franchise but the customer service was pretty great, our waitress was attentive and super friendly. The kitchen staff who brought out the food was also very friendly and accommodating. The location is clean and updated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6
John F.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",20,12,1,1.0,8/8/2017,"Wow.... What can I say. The management needs replaced. The service was a clear reflection on the lack of leadership. I have never seen a place lock the doors because they were so slow to get people their meals and so backed up that a ""15min wait"" turned into 1 3/4 hours. The waitress was so upset and stressed that she couldn't get food out of the kitchen that she broke down into tears. How bad does a place need to be that the waitress is so embarrassed and frustrated that she ends up sobbing in the middle of the dining room. The food was under/over cooked. Out of 10 dishes zero.... Yes ZERO were correct. Management, even when requested wouldn't come to the table. I'm done with TGI Friday's (This Garbage Is Friday's)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6
Cherry J.,"Indianapolis, IN",1,60,206,4.0,8/30/2017,"We don't typically review chain restaurants but this one is an exception because of their location and outdoor seating with a good downtown view.

Jin S.,"Indianapolis, IN",1,59,1,3.0,11/22/2017,We went here for a work lunch a while ago. There aren't too many vegetarian options unfortunately. I asked for a quesadilla without chicken but was told that it couldn't be changed (it was premade I guess). I stuck to the blackbean burger which was delicious as were the seasoned fries. I want to give them 4 stars but was disappointed they couldn't accommodate someone with vegetarian needs.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6
Lee M.,"Goshen, IN",0,29,,1.0,12/2/2017,"Went to Winter Lights and was staying at the Marriot. Didn't want anything big so went with appetizers. First I thought prices were high but it's downtown so what do you expect.  Anyway ordered Brussel Sprouts .    I know your not a fan but I am.  Figured they would at least cook them. Came to me hard as rocks after 2.6 minutes in a deep fryer. I complained to the waitress but she just hemmed & hawed and didn't offer relieve. Too tried to get into it so I let it go.

Gary J.,"Rock Hill, SC",14,49,35,2.0,10/28/2017,Ok it's TGIF and I know what to expect but this was a bad TGIF. We got in early to Fairfield so decided to grab a bite here since it's beside hotel lobby. The bread was stale on my French Dip and the sandwich was very small. They brought out our sandwiches without the fries? The waitress advised us the fries would be about in a few minutes. Never had that happen before. I finished my sandwich by the time the fries got there. Very disappointed in a$12 French dip.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6
April K.,"Carmel, IN",140,159,116,3.0,7/9/2017,"So I'm reviewing my check ins and couldn't for the life of me remember going to TGI Fridays!  Was it that un-memorable?   But then I remembered, I walked over here after Pride and I reallllyyyyyy needed food and water if you know what I mean.  Sat in the bar and waited quite a bit for service. Maybe they were tired of the late night crowd but I was definitely ignored. When we finally received service, she was nice enough and recommended the all you can eat apps for $10.  What a deal!   We were able to get several apps that tasted decent at $10 each.   The only issue is that the service was soooo slow. Too slow for drinknrefills on drinks and getting the check.  It's so frustrating to wait for a check when you are ready to go.  For the food- the skins were fine but they clearly just use a slice of cheese- makes it look cheap. Pot stickers were tasty. Mozz sticks were ok but too thick.  Eh.

It was steps from my hotel so I figured ""why not?""  Unfortunately I haven't been missing much. The low prices are pretty remarkable. I don't recall paying any more than I did 10+ years ago despite inflation. However, the food is much worse than I remembered as a kid. Could be adult vs teenager standards?  Low prices? Absolutely.

The chicken was so shredded that it was like the consistency of canned crab.  They were just off.  This particular location is not really convenient in that it's in - or on the back side of the JW Mariott.  While there are a few expensive parking garages around and if you are lucky some metered street parking, it's a few blocks walk just to get to it.  I have to say I still love all of the kitsch on the walls, but honestly, there are other and better choices in the downtown area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6
Abby L.,"Warren, Indianapolis, IN",174,2,,1.0,10/1/2017,"By far one of the worst ""service"" experiences I have ever had. Our waitress only came to our table about two times our whole visit there... one of those times because we had to flag her down for refills. When they brought our table our food, they forgot to bring out my mom's meal... having to flag her down again to bring this to their attention, we sat a good 20 minutes and her meal still was not brought out. Tired of waiting (keep in mind our waitress still hasn't been around to check on anything) my dad got up and had to go find a manager. I would have been sympathetic for the waitress had the restaurant been busy because I know what it's like being a server, but the restaurant was fairly empty.

My Long Island was WAY to strong and out of balance - I powered through though! Other that not knowing the the price of the drinks, my service was good.

Nikki H.,"Snellville, GA",154,212,429,2.0,10/2/2015,"I really really love Fridays and I hate to give such a low rating, but I would hate for someone to come here and be disappointed like I was. If you're considering stopping at this Friday's, don't! Save your money and swing over to Scottys or Mass Ave for a better dining experience. When it comes to Friday's apps, burgers and that to-die-for Tennessee Whiskey cake I've never been disappointed. Honestly...never, but the service at this location was a little different since it's downtown. They don't do endless apps. They said the Yelp 10% off coupon was fraudulent (really? fraudulent?). The manager had terrible customer service. My sister's bun was hard. I don't know if it was hard stale or what, but it definitely wasn't edible. Our server asked if she wanted another bun...what? Where do they do that at? She wanted a freshly cooked burger. She only had a couple bites so it only seemed right to make another burger. The server got the manager who walked up to our table with no introduction or apology for the inconvenience and then stated that all bread is delivered daily. What does that mean? She snatched the plate and looked at me and said ""What's wrong with yours?"" I said nothing and she walked off whispering something to our server. She never came back. She didn't say what the resolution to the issue was. Nothing. Indianapolis has entirely too many restaurants to have to deal with mediocre service. I don't know why good service isn't part of the entire dining out experience. How do you expect people to come back? Maybe since it's a national brand in a good location they don't care because they know out of towners will drop in. Maybe this Friday's is just a To-Go spot. Whatever it is, I won't be back here. Unfortunately the location 5 min from me in Avon closed. I can still visit the W 38th St and Keystone at the Xing locations for my Friday's fix.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6
Jackson L.,"Greenwood, IN",24,83,36,4.0,4/27/2016,"A lot of people might be turned off by places like Friday's or Applebee's just because they're a cookie-cutter kind of chain. But this Friday's in particular is a favorite of mine simply because the bar tending staff is great.  I worked at an adjacent hotel for two years and came in regularly for a close lunch. I left 6 months ago and recently came back to the hotel for a week. I walked into Friday's and they all remembered me by name and it was like we were pals. It made me smile even though I (less than secretly) hate that I'm back at the hotel, even for a short period.  If you're in the mood for a decent local brew, they've always got a good couple of choices from Sun King on tap. If you're interested in maybe a combination you wouldn't have thought of, I love the Grey Goose Cooler. It's got basil in it, which seems shocking at first, but upon tasting is so refreshing and light, and the sweetness is on point.

Ian H.,"Indianapolis, IN",63,27,47,2.0,7/31/2017,"I visited here with a group of friends on Sunday for dinner while strolling around downtown. The location is superb, being very conveniently close to a lot of prime locations (the zoo, the state museum, the canal, victory field, etc). We walked in and were given the option to either sit in the bar or wait 45 minutes for a booth/table (because there were two large parties of 10+ each), so of course we all chose the bar. Each of us were given conflicting menu's, some of which were up-to-date with the current specials/prices and some weren't, so before ordering our waitress had to clarify. Our waitress took an extraordinarily long time to take orders, refill drinks, deliver food, and ultimately provide the checks. The food was average, the portions for some of the more expensive items ordered were not worth the money, and ultimately the service was pretty awful. It has been about 10 years since either of us had been to a TGI Fridays, and I think all of our group would agree it will be about 10 more years before we ever bother to come back. The selection, quantity, and quality of food, as well as the menu specials, simply don't compare to other similar restaurant options available.

Richard P.,"Indianapolis, IN",256,537,123,2.0,2/12/2015,"As I was leaving this downtown Indianapolis location of T.G.I. Friday's this afternoon after having joined a party of 9 other co-workers for a going away lunch for a peer, it occurred to me that perhaps my first mistake was visiting a T.G.I. Friday's on a Thursday.  This particular location has a built-in customer base being located in the midst of a cluster of Marriott hotel properties and within a block of several area museums, a baseball stadium, and other tourist attractions. As is true of nearly every T.G.I. Friday's I have ever been to, this particular location has the usual touristy/sports bar feeling to it with pop culture decorations and a number of televisions hung from ceilings around the restaurant. The usual T.G.I. Friday's decor remains in place here.  In terms of wheelchair friendliness, that entirely depends upon where you're coming from - if you're actually in one of the neighboring hotels, then the trip is relatively easy with well placed curb cuts. I will say that their two sets of glass doors are relatively heavy, and I was grateful for the employee who did arrive upon my entrance to help out.  If you're coming from anywhere other than the area hotels, you'll likely have to deal with sidewalks that are in a good condition but there's lots of heavy traffic around. So, it might be best to visit with a companion to ensure maximum safety.  One of my co-workers arrived at the restaurant early to make sure we got a table in a timely manner given that all of us were on our lunch hour. So, I will admit that when we all arrived several minutes later that I was a bit disappointed to see that no real effort had been made to arrange the tables appropriately. It only took a few more minutes, but it was an early indicator that the entire meal's pacing was going to be a tad off.  We all arrived and were seated at grouped together tables that accommodated us pretty well, though it was a bit chilly being near the front door. I did look around and noticed at least a couple areas of the restaurant that were clearly not wheelchair friendly, though I do give the staff credit for actually removing a chair for the spot my wheelchair needed. I ordered a classic cheeseburger that comes with seasoned fries. I ordered the burger medium-well and also ordered my usual unsweetened iced tea. They offer a few ""pairings"" offering lunch discounts, but none really struck my fancy.  Our drink orders were taken. They arrived a few minutes later. Again, it seemed a tad slow to me. The food arrived pretty much all at the same time, which I'm aware is practice but it seems to me backfired here.  What do I mean? The burger, which I'd say was medium rather than medium-well, was cold. I'm not kidding. It was actually cold, not even kind of warm. The bun, which had obviously been toasted, was also cold and bland tasting. I won't quite say it was all dreadful, but it was certainly massively disappointing. The lightly seasoned french fries would have likely been semi-decent if they hadn't also been right on the edge of being cold. The food tasted like they'd allowed it to sit out waiting while everyone else's meals were finishing up. I have no idea if that's what actually happened, but it sure tasted like it.  The iced tea was good, but they broke my cardinal rule by not offering a refill despite the fact that we clearly had down times and my glass was clearly empty. I always expect a refill offer, but that's especially true for a $2.99 drink. The process of getting the check also seemed to be just a tad slow. Jennifer, our server, was friendly but the whole atmosphere just seemed overly casual. You would think you'd be going for a decent tip with a group of 10, but our presence seemed like it was irrelevant.  Overall, I knocked off a star for the accessibility issues and I'm knocking off a star for the slower customer service and lack of an iced tea refill. The final star gets knocked off for serving up cold food. The final bill was just over $12 or so, and I definitely did not get my money's worth.  Indy's really growing in terms of quality restaurants, so unless you are stuck at the hotel with few dining options I can't think of a reason to venture over to this location of T.G.I. Friday's. I enjoyed spending the time with friends, but this won't be a place I plan to visit again unless I just happen to be in the area and am feeling too lazy to wheel a few blocks farther.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6?start=20
Christopher F.,"Indianapolis, IN",392,93,56,1.0,3/4/2016,"Pretty poor performance. Went on a Sunday night after seeing a couple ads on TV. Walked in to several parties waiting for tables while we saw 20+ empty clean tables and as many dirty. We grabbed a couple seats at the bar. Bartenders did a fine job. Speed of service was good. Did the 3 app option (this location doesn't do endless apps). Nice variety. Good. Cajun pasta and burger both good. Why the 1 star? The place was filthy. An hour after we arrived, the dirty table next to us covered in plates and glasses was still the same. Every empty table was full of dirty dishes. Never saw anyone trying to clean up.

Januarie Y.,"Indianapolis, IN",125,147,1073,2.0,9/23/2015,"Two stars....and the only reason it's not ONE star is because my sister didn't have the same problem as I did.  I don't like this place. Won't be back. The bread on my burger was old and they were in denial about it. I was offered new bread. And then I was offered nothing else. We were told our Yelp coupons were (and I quote) ""FRAUDULENT"" and were not to be used at that location because it was offered without their permission. The waitress also let us know this was an exclusive friday's location or something. I don't remember her describing word, but it was quite off. This is not an exclusive fridays and they don't deserve a capital ' f ', unless we're talking report cards. This place should be called ""Case of the Mondays"".  Because that's what it was. A big fat Monday with very old bread.  The manager was less than thrilled to address my concerns. Here's my thing:  If I'm paying you TWELVE DOLLARS to eat a cheeseburger (rather than purchasing my own hamburger and fixins for at home cooking), then I deserve for my bread not to feel like I could I break a concrete block with it. The bread was unnaturally hard on one side and soaked w/hamburger fixins-juice on the other. So I basically had what is usually an AMAZING cheeseburger served lukewarm (which I didn't even complain about) on half-n-half bread: Half soggy, half brick. The top bun was old as well. I know what old bread feels and tastes like. It has a different texture and thickness to it the older it gets (I""m speficially meaning hamburger buns). The bread also seemed much smaller than it usually is, or at least smaller than the buns I've had from ALL THE OTHER Friday's I've eaten this burger at. The fries were warm but not hot which meant they were cold and nasty quickly.  Clearly judging by how often I am checking in to a place to eat, I don't have a problem paying someone to cook for me. I do however have an issue w/serving me food that sucks and then looking at me like I should feel honored to eat it. When I told the manager the bread was the type of hard that signifies old bread, she looked at me straight faced and said 'that's not true, our bread is flown in from the South of France every morning'.  Ok I paraphrased it, but that might as well have been what she said and whatever stale face look you created in your head when you read that, is the stale face look she gave me. It reeked of 'I don't give a damn'. And she said that as if because they have bread come in the building daily, that means it can't be stale and old and hard. What reason do I have to spend my time playing with food? I came to eat, I did NOT come to complain, but I do want my food to be of quality.  I told her I didn't want it.  Her response: Ok. *Grabs plate and walks away*  And that was it. o.O ????  Yeah she comp'd the meal but no, she did not bother to say that. She didn't offer me a redo, which I was hungry enough to try it again. After all, I love Friday's and I love this particular burger. She just looked at me, grabbed the plate and walked off. The way she walked up to the table was the same nonchalantness of damns-not-given. I didn't know she was the manager and I definitely didn't think she was headed to our table w/such a lackadaisiscal demeanor. But she did...and as you can see, she stayed true to it.  Oh and how could I forget when I told the waitress my bread was hard as a brick, she asked if I wanted another bun. Another bun? A single bun? A single bottom piece of bun? LOL. No ma'am, I don't want a bun; I want a manager.  All in all, the best part of this trip was the knowledge that I will never again return to this place. It's quite dark and dreary inside and doesn't reflect all the work they put into beautifying the outside. So they can keep their Venice Italy-Flown In Brick Bread and their unconcerned management staff. Maybe they should take their mask off for Halloween and just be who they are: A Bad Case of the Mondays. I'm just way too snooty for this and that I can admit. * shrug *",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6?start=20
Kandice T.,"Indianapolis, IN",23,25,7,1.0,9/3/2016,"Went here last night for a late dinner with my daughter. This was probably not the best idea I've ever had because a bunch of young adults seemed to be there ""pre-gaming it""  for a night out on the town. The wait for a table was five minutes, which left me wondering why the host had quoted us twenty-five minutes and referred the couple in front of us to another nearby restaurant/bar SubZero. In the beginning, everything was going smoothly, but then the table next to us asked to speak with the manager. I'm not sure what their complaint was, but that combined with the fact that I'd sent something back that I didn't want after seeing it, was obviously too much for Alison (our waitress) to handle. She completely shut down. She stopped checking on us; and when I was able to wave her down, she sent someone else to fulfill our request. The manager seemed equally as nonchalant as she was, so I wasn't very surprised.

Stacy P.,"Indianapolis, IN",107,718,370,2.0,7/16/2014,"One thing going for this T.G.I. Friday's is its location. It is located on the Courtyard/ Fairfield Inn & Suites side in cluster of Marriott properties, and if your staying here or visiting the White River State Park or Canal and don't wish to walk a few blocks, it can be one of the cheaper options when compared to the restaurants in the JW. This Friday's is one the larger size and its crowd seems to vary based on the conventions and other events downtown. Service here can vary extremely. I have had some of the best and some of the worst service here.  In terms of menu, they have most of the typical Friday's options. On the regular menu, they do now list what items can be altered to be gluten free, but I would highly stress your dietary needs and concerns with your server, although you may find that there might be some confusion. I would also recommend to verify what sauces that they use, especially soy sauce.  Also, they do list the fries as being gluten free; however, they don't have a dedicated fryer, so depending on your sensitivity, you should take this into account. Also, like many other restaurants, Friday's is a shared kitchen environment and there is a chance for cross contamination.  In terms of GF food, the choices are limited and kind of pricey for the quality of what you get. If you do have a gluten allergy, I would just walk the 2.5 blocks for other options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6?start=40

That said, our experience at TGIF Indianapolis (the one adjoining to the JW Marriott complex) wasn't too bad at all.  My flat iron steak was competently cooked and reasonably seasoned, with creamy mashed potatoes.  But, while I typically love tomato-mozzarella salad, this one was simply not.  While tomatoes, onions, and a decent vinaigrette were present, there was not one single bit of mozzarella to be found on either mine or Brian's servings. Service at TGIF was similarly mediocre.  Our waiter was perfunctory, at best, and didn't offer to refill my drink throughout my meal.  He did his job; no more, no less, which isn't exactly a glowing review. We went here because it was convenient, and it was.  The food was decent, the service was okay, and the ambiance was the typical over-produced chain garbage.  To quote Othello, ""Speak of me as I am, nothing extenuate, nor set down aught in malice, of one that lov'd not wisely but too well.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6?start=40

I work for the Marriott and as an employee I get 20% discounts on food. I ordered a meal for full price and told them I worked for the Marriott. I even showed them my discount card, but the bartender just looked at me and said ""we don't give discounts anymore."" WTF!!!

The second time - I didn't feel like a huge mean, so I got the santa fe chicken salad which was supposed to have a mix of iceberg and romaine lettuces.  I tend to stay away from iceberg salads since there's usually not a ton of flavor in them.  This ""mix"" consisted of a few pieces of romaine in a mostly (95%) iceberg salad.  There were several pieces of lettuce that were wilty and the edges were brown.   If you're not willing to try some of the other great restaurants in the area or arrive late and need a bite to eat - this is a fair choice.  Otherwise, I'd eat somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-indianapolis-6?start=100

Instead of giving out a pager, the hostess asked for my cell number and said we would receive a text when our table was ready. The restaurant was busy but that was to be expected on a Friday evening. Our name was called pretty quickly -- I never did receive a text so I don't know if they only send a message if you don't respond when they call your name. I hadn't been to a Friday's in years so I was pleasantly surprised at the menu. I decided on an appetizer that was tagged as being under 750 calories while my fiance got the appetizer sampler. We were both pleased with our meals as well as the cost. Chain restaurants aren't my usual choice, especially downtown, but this is a great place in a pinch.

Joe T.,"Indianapolis, IN",134,31,55,1.0,2/19/2015,"We met friends staying at the attached hotel for dinner. If it were any warmer, we probably would've walked somewhere else. But, it was below zero, so Friday's it is. I bet that's how many people make the choice to eat here. It's not really a place where you say ""You know what? Let's go to Friday's tonight!"" It's a place you go because it's there and a better place isn't.  It was busy due to a nearby convention. That said, I'd give the staff some slack. But I can't give them enough slack for how awful it was. We arrived to no greeting and met our friends who were already seated (we arrived late because parking was kind of nonexistent. Every attached garage but one was blocked off). We then waited roughly 20 minutes for our server to arrive to take a drink order and give our friends a refill. We ordered everything while we had her there. About 15 minutes later two of our four drinks were brought to the table. The other two arrived shortly after. Then, probably a half hour after ordering, three of our four meals arrived, leaving one in our party to stare at us as we gently picked at ours, waiting, hoping his would come.  The food was less that mediocre. And the price was higher than many better downtown restaurants. My chicken breast was small and dry. It was an a-cup in comparison to the menu photo's ""Gentleman, please welcome to the stage Crystal"" (Warrant's Cherry Pie blaring at the chicken strip club full of sad, single roosters) breast.  When the final plate arrived, the steak was overcooked and the plate looked like it had been thrown together.

Blue cheese coated steak was very good.   The most noteable thing was the service, or lack thereof.  Because we were sitting in the bar area on the bar side, we had one of what looked like 4 bartenders as one of our servers.  One would think that on the weekend of the Brickyard 400 they would have had more staff on to handle more customers.  Poor planning.
