Jack I.,"Bay Shore, NY",1,1,,5.0,8/3/2013,"Just Came from this TGIF. The service was great. The manager Lorenzo was a gentleman & made me feel extremely comfortable there. The waitress, I think her name was Christina, my apologies if I'm wrong, was also great. Very attentive and friendly. The service was quick and I left feeling very satisfied. This will be my new TGIF.   Thanks again,    Jack I",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-islip?start=40
Ara A.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",61,33,,3.0,11/19/2011,"Good location near my law school. However, the staff always seems to have an attitude problem; most likely from being located in Central Islip, NY.  Good beers on tap, and for us students, that is all that matters at this joint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-islip?start=40
Manny F.,"Brentwood, NY",9,55,9,3.0,2/12/2011,"Pretty good food, the new menu has good choices. Try the chicken Picata if you like eating pasta because it's delicious. The service is a bit iffy but the waiters try to compensate by helping each other.

Omar M.,"Central Islip, NY",33,138,24,2.0,5/25/2015,If you're interested In an understaffed restaurant with a ghetto atmosphere than this is your place. The drinks were warm and it took almost 40 min to come out with the wingless buffalo wings. Only reason why I came here is bc it's around the block and the game was on.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-islip?start=20
Courtney M.,"Queen Creek, AZ",207,177,352,5.0,4/7/2016,"So, it's pretty surprising to me that I've never reviewed Friday's because of my intense, irrational love for Friday's. It's like, my go-to restaurant. I don't think I've ever been disappointed. Now I remember when Friday's was not the restaurant it is now and the menu was slightly simpler, the prices considerably less, and they had daily drink specials (except for on Fridays, of course) and despite not being crazy about all the alterations and the constantly changing menu, I still love it. ANYWAY, came here about two nights about with the fiancé, ordered the cajun chicken/shrimp pasta and the JD's flat iron with a side of crunchy shrimp, fries, and mac and cheese (gluttons, I know). It was really, really good. Steak was cooked just right, the pasta wasn't under-seasoned or incredibly spicy (it's always a toss up) but the mac and cheese is definitely lacking in the cheese department but for some reason, I don't mind. I also ordered a strawberry henny which I drank on an empty stomach and thoroughly enjoyed. I'm definitely here for all the new drinks. Service was standard, it was a little late and our waitress ended up going home after delivering our food so the bartender ended up taking our check. Obviously we tipped but as to who received the tip, that was a mystery. So, no complaints, had a great meal and thanks to my coupon from being a stripes member, I got the pasta for free so we didn't spend a whole bunch of money.

Adam H.,"Bay Shore, NY",53,24,226,2.0,10/5/2012,"Eh, idk. This place has it's good nights as well as it's bad. More of the latter. The food is very salty, the keep changing the menu (usually for the worse), and the took fajitas off the menu.      The drinks always need some fortification! Usually in the form of a nip i bring myself. The margaritas range from great to undrinkable depending on who is bartending as well as who made the sour mix that day. Even the great ones need an additional shot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-islip?start=20
Edward W.,"Milton, GA",218,850,246,3.0,9/24/2013,"3 stars.  That about sums it up.   Yes, the servers are fun, friendly and can flip those metal mixing cups over their heads, but the place seems a little dark, dated and dirty.  And I can get the majority of their menu at the supermarket and prepare it at home in my clean cucina.  I can't mix drinks like the Fridays 'tenders, tho, and that's maybe the reason to go to TGI's. I guess what I am saying is that when you go to Friday's you know what you're getting.  Seems they are all the same these days.  Right about 3 stars. Yup, that's it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-islip?start=20
Linda D.,"Hauppauge, NY",0,10,,3.0,11/28/2015,The place was hoping on Saturday. Hostess and waitress were cordial and efficient. Our food arrived before we could finish our appetizers. We were in a party of 5.  One hamburger came almost raw when It was ordered medium plus the food was cold.   The table was crooked and rocked back and further enough to make you sea sick.   The chicken tenders were good. The pecan chicken salad was very good but the chicken was not crisp and it was cold also. The waitress Nicole was awesome as was the hostess Kristie Marie.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-islip?start=20
Kyle D.,"Central Islip, NY",8,6,2,1.0,1/5/2014,"***IF I COULD RATE ZERO, I WOULD*** Worst managed TGI I've been to. Has advertisements clearly stating ""half off appetizers"" but excluded the one I ordered. I clearly asked the manager when I walked in if appetizers were half off today and she said yes. The menu I was given does not state the appetizer is excluded. The waitress takes my order (not saying it is excluded) and my bill comes with the full price. When I speak to the manager she has the nerve to tell me that it's my fault and I have to pay full price, meanwhile I wasn't told anything. Screwed out of my money.

Julienne M.,"Nesconset, NY",11,6,,3.0,2/13/2015,"Actually sitting in the restaurant right now and thought I'd throw up a review before I forget. So my brother and dad both ordered the same burger, one well, one rare. They realized the orders were mixed up after taking a few bites and were just going to switch. The manager popped out of idk where and offered to send out an all new burger. Great customer service. Our server was great.  Only reason for 3 stars is the food was so so. My burger came out not quite warm. The beer had a weird tang. But overall it was a good experience. I'd go back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-islip?start=20

Kevin B.,"Brooklyn, NY",262,28,1,1.0,6/12/2012,"Came here one time after picking a friend up at court. The meal was mediocre at best, the chicken on my salad basically inedible, the toast fairly stale. After they swiped my card but before I signed the check, I got to the bottom of the cup and there was a SHRIMP TAIL IN MY COFFEE.  I immediately called over a manager and asked if I could get the meal comped. Instead, he returned, and I had gotten the coffee free, and some appetizer cards. I told him I did not want the app cards, he's lucky I'm not allergic to shrimp and I would not pay for the meal. He said they had already swiped the card and there was nothing he could do.

Silma L.,"Brentwood, NY",0,14,,1.0,1/12/2014,"I wish I could rate this place with a negative star.  I love TGI Friday's, but this particular restaurant is the absolute worst. The service is horrible and the employees just the same. Everytime I dine here it takes forever to be served. My appetizers come with my meal and mind you that my meal takes about 20 minutes to arrive (no dramatization). The employees are too carefree and irresponsible. Everything about this place SCREAMS unprofessional. I live around the area and there are three other TGI Friday's by me, so I usually go to the others except on those rare occasions that I go to this particular restaurant.  Whats amazing though, is that everyone I know hates this place as well. Everyone has the same complaints. The management in this place needs some serious wake up calls, as a matter of fact this place needs needs to go under new management. Its such a shame really. Its one thing to have a bad waiter or just one bad experience, but when the entire restaurant fails- thats the embarrassing part.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-islip?start=20

Renee B.,"Central Islip, NY",174,314,3207,4.0,11/7/2017,"Here's the Scoop: Since this TGIF became part of this mall I never really liked it because service was eh and food never served fresh or hot. Well, today my daughter and I went shopping and was near this Friday's so I decided to give it another shot. The service was great and the upgraded decorations are on point. Love the new feel. Upon entering nice welcome from hostess and quick seating. Definitely like the upgrades. There's live  music on Friday's and Saturday's that I hear is great. Must come to check it out.

Paul A.,"Brentwood, NY",0,1,,1.0,12/29/2017,"Just about the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. Restaurant was half full, yet it took 2 minutes to seat my party, and even then, was at a table that wasn't set properly (no utensils or napkins) and had a perfectly fine booth sitting empty right next to it. Service was poor - server repeatedly ignored us, ticket times were atrocious (over 30 minutes), food was brought out and our table still did not have any utensils or napkins, and probably would've never gotten any of those ""basics"" had I not said anything. Server never asked to refill our drinks or any of the ""common courtesy"" tasks you expect of a server (try to offer you more food, advertise specials, etc.). My unsweetened tea couldn't be sweetened because, again, nothing was at my table except for an empty bottle of ketchup and salt and pepper grinders they bought at the nearby Target. Appetizer was served without extra plates, forcing our party to reach across the table to grab a mozzarella stick. Food portions were minuscule and was average, at best.

Kerri H.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,2,12,1.0,12/23/2017,"I had the WORST dining experience of my entire life last night at this Friday's location. My cocktail I ordered came out wrong twice. We ordered loaded nachos and the queso was so cold it was like paste. I had to send that back after only taking one bite. They did not offer a new plate until I asked. The new plate came out and it was so cold that i called the manager over and asked him to stick his finger in the queso so he can see for himself what had come to our table. Sent the nachos back and didn't ask for a third plate. I ordered the jack daniels sandwich with no lettuce or tomato. My sandwich came out with JUST A PIECE OF GRILLED CHICKEN. I told our server this is the wrong sandwich and he came back out with the exact same plate and just put some jack Daniels sauce on it. I told him I didn't even want my meal anymore. My sister and her husband both ordered meatballs for their unlimited apps and the plates came out completely different AND cold. One had just meatballs and cheese, the other plate had no cheese and Pico de Gallo on top with a side of toast. Their boneless wings had zero sauce. They were like nuggets.

Got an app, ended up not liking the dipping sauce so I was waiting for the waitress to come back so I could ask for ranch. She finally comes over 15 minutes later, then I asked her for a side of ranch and a brownie dessert. She says sure. 15 minutes later no ranch, then comes with the brownie and apologizes for the wait.. so I just said can I get that ranch so I can just eat my app at home since it's cold now... we finish the dessert and she asks if we want anything else, we say just the check. Then she drops the check off, my boyfriend decides to go to the bar thinking he would get change faster, obviously that was a mistake. The waitress comes over sees the open checkbook with no money and sees me writing an essay for school and goes oh are you paying cash or card? I'm like .. um my boyfriends getting change from the bar. Then she laughs, says okay and walks away. My boy friend comes back and she comes running over and literally stands there until he pays! He has his money and he's counting everything and she's just standing there, trying to make small talk. How was the rest of your day? Do anything special?

Although failure is likely imminent; I look forward to the challenge. As I mentioned, I got the black bean burger, for I am a vegetarian currently (but I do have occasional ""meat-cheat"" days). I also opted for the side of french fries, which were of course topped with spicy brown mustard.  The burger has corn and some other stuff inside - all deliciousness incarnate.  The atmosphere is pretty standard for TGIF's, friendly waitress that was attentive to her customers. No rush (then again there was no waiting line) even though I stayed for about 30 minutes after I finished my meal to wrap up some paperwork while on the road.
