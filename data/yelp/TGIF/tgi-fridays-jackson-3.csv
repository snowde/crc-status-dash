Matt V.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,28,9,4.0,2/18/2017,"Food: Food was hot and tasty, pretty happy with how well it was cooked. I had a California club that was near perfect.  Beer: menu says the beers I ordered were on tap, but they came in bottles and kinda warm. Wasn't happy about that.  Location: Lively crowd on a Friday night .  Service: very nice waitress who attended",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jackson-3
Lilia D.,"Chicago, IL",49,85,52,2.0,4/29/2017,"I went to TGI Fridays last night for drinks. The restaurant was full but not unbearably crowded. We waited for about 15 minutes before someone came to take our order. I asked for a Lagunitas IPA, which I was pleasantly surprised that they had it on menu. Our waitress informed me that they were out of Lagunitas. OK. So then I asked for another IPA. Then I was told that they were out of all pale ales. Obviously their management is doing poor inventory, because how are you going to sell out of an entire drink menu selection on a Friday night??? I settled for a mixed drink, all the while wishing I had gone to a real bar. Overall, the waitress was really nice, but the service was very subpar. And again, how are you going to sell out of beer on a Friday night?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jackson-3

Tammy R.,"Dexter, MO",0,16,111,3.0,5/6/2017,"The afternoon that I ate here, it was not busy. We had 5 in our party and she wanted us to sit at separate tables. There were many bigger empty tables for us to sit at so we requested one of those. The server had major attitude about it. Our food was okay. We got free apps because they told us about a way to sign up for their mailing list. The new server walked us through the process and we were very grateful. It wasn't as clean as I would have liked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jackson-3
Randall R.,"Nashville, TN",0,5,,2.0,8/23/2017,"On a whim, I stopped in on a Wednesday night. The place was pretty empty. I walked up to the hostess stand but didn't see anyone so I stepped into the bar area. I didn't see anyone there other than the bartender behind the bar. He was occupied with a couple of customers and with carrying on a conversation with his colleague. Still no one to be found at the hostess stand. I waited a couple more minutes before the bartender noticed and asked if I was being helped. I said not yet and he turned away. The phone began to ring and suddenly appeared a hostess. Finally noticing me she asked if I'd like to sit in the bar or dining room. I told her I didn't mind either but that a booth in the bar area was fine. She had to clean one since they had been left cluttered with dirty dishes from previous guests.  Once seated, I waited several more minutes (I counted 4 on my watch) before the bartender came over to take my order. I ordered the appetizer sampler with boneless wings in Jack Daniels sauce. A few minutes later the food arrived. The wings were spun in regular buffalo sauce. When I checked the receipt I found that the server had rung them up incorrectly - a result of not writing down the order. The food wasn't anything to write home about either. It tasted like it was prepared from frozen and just warmed for me.  Overall, I was definitely not impressed with the service or the food. Do yourself a favor and just go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jackson-3
Amber K.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,9,,1.0,6/19/2017,"Used to love TGI Fridays until the staff and manager last October proved to disgregard any pretense of customer service. I chaperoned a group of 10 kids from our church youth group to the restaurant. They mentioned that they always order some half-off chicken wing special. We ordered the special, and the server said the kids couldn't order that because we're weren't sitting at the bar. Mind you we're literally 2 feet away from the bar. I wasn't sure if he was saying the kids weren't allowed to sit in the bar (nor would high tops be safe or appropriate for a 3 year old). He just maintained that we couldn't order the meal from our seat despite my efforts to reason with him. Asked to speak to a manger to see if he/she could see why I wouldn't want to move 10 young children to a bar setting where we would have to sit at 3 different high top tables. No luck. I even asked if I could just order the wings at the bar and carry them to our family-friendly seats. Nope. Rather than leave the restaurant along with our business, we acquiesced and moved all 10 kids to bar stools so we couldn't even enjoy our meal together. Haven't went there since and don't plan on it. Horrendous way to treat customers. Not sure if the same manager is there but hopefully she or the new manager have learned flexibility since last fall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jackson-3
Tim B.,"St Charles, MO",0,14,2,1.0,6/25/2016,"Sat for 10 mins and watched numerous servers walk by us to many times to count. I had to go to the hostess stand to ask for a server.  Server took our order and I asked for the roast beef sand. She said, ""They took it off the menu"". I then showed her the French Dip on the menu. She replied, "" Is that what that is?""  She then explained that she thought it was French onion soup!! About 15 mins later someone else brought some of our food. We ate it, then our server returned another 15 mins later and asked if we wanted to go cups for our drinks. I explained we would like refills in glasses because we still haven't received the French dip.  She returned 5 mins later to tell us they were cooking fresh fries which is restaurant lingo for your sandwich was sitting in the window and now the fries need to be re-cooked.  About 5 mins later we received the sandwich. However, it had horseradish sauce on it which we specifically requested to not be on it. Also, the fries were disgustingly soggy.   Which means they needed fries on the fly so, they cooked them half as long as actually needed.  So, we sat for about 10 mins before the server finally returned. At that point we requested the sandwich be taken off our bill and we paid for what was eaten.  Besides the waitress being incompetent what bothered me the most was the other servers in the immediate area.   They watched us sit without being greeted. They also watched as we pushed the uneaten sandwich to the edge of the table. They all just walked by and then one server commented to me about our serving being new and not doing a good job.  However, none of the servers cared to get us a drink or even ask us if we needed anything.  Which shouldn't be surprising considering after our server had the manager take the sandwich off the bill the manager never bothered to stop by our table. In fact we never saw a manager the entire time we were in the restaurant.  Friday's is a far cry from what they used to be in the 80's and 90's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jackson-3
Mark W.,"Panama City Beach, FL",97,22,6,4.0,1/17/2016,"Good food. Need to add more speedy and kempt staff members  (male and female). Host staff was most friendly.  Servers seemed to be unwilling to help each other,  many standing around.  As far as servers and ordering, the bartenders seem to be best and most friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jackson-3
Madison C.,"Nashville, TN",0,1,,5.0,9/28/2016,"I love TGI Fridays! I love the food and the atmosphere. And for a chain restaurant it's got a real down home feel. This visit was particularly great specifically because of our server Angelica! We could see the girl who I presume is the hostess was clearly busy which wasn't a problem. We were still accommodated quickly by someone who wasn't a hostess and accidentally got me unsweet tea instead of sweet, which I would've happily drank with no problem. My company told Angelica this and I was promptly given a fantastic sweet tea. She continued to check on us several times and was very personable and helpful. Overall fantastic service! Really glad to have come in when we did to get such a great waitress!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jackson-3
David D.,"Brentwood, TN",0,2,,1.0,7/26/2016,"Wow, I can't tell you how bad the food was. I ordered the French dip "" a fridays favorite"". It was terrible!  Service was ok, they were short staffed and very unorganized!  I was warned, won't be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jackson-3
JC C.,"Beech Bluff, TN",0,88,21,5.0,4/28/2014,"Wait: Can be bad pending time of day, bar area usually has hightops. Menu: Has improved greatly, JMHO Service: Bar area on Evenings and Weekends is the bomb. If you get Swift, Megan, Jessica, or Grant it's going to be way better than average. Price: Gotta get a stripes account, points build up every visit and free stuff is what that's all about for us. Management: Gotten better, there is still one guy who needs better social interaction with customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jackson-3
Glenn S.,"Bellevue, WA",353,283,247,1.0,10/14/2010,Walked and the host was very polite and good. Menu was was covered in an out with sticky goods and sauces. Fried green beans came with someone else's hair. Fries was cold and burger was screwed up. Not sure how you can screw up a cheese burger without onions but they did. The server was funny and a good guy. I guess I'm just use to service in a big city. This does look like a good spot to have a drink if you are single and want to mingle in the bar by keep in mind the drinks in here are very weak. As I am not a drinker and I felt I was drinking a water down coke. I can pass on Fridays next time in town.  Along with the bathrooms being filthy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jackson-3

Stefanie M.,"Sugar Grove, IL",0,3,,1.0,1/31/2015,"I'm all for a fun work environment...until my customer service and meal suffers. My salad got to me when I was half way finished with my meal. the workers seemed to be more interested in the conversation in the back than serving us. poor customer service. very long wait. chicken meals were cold, we saw them sit under the lamp for 15 mins. lots of empty tables when there was a 40 minute wait. lots of workers standing around. only reason we stayed is because we are traveling and we were starving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jackson-3

Scott J.,"Jackson, TN",0,2,,1.0,8/10/2014,"Took my daughter at 4pm on Sunday.  As we were being seated by the hostess, noticed they were not busy at all, only counted 6 tables with guests on our side of the restaurant. Noticed floor was filthy with debris, booth and table had food crumbs. Waited for 15 mins and never had our wait person come to table. Had one person come by after first 7 mins to take our drink order, but he explained he was not out waiter. Never got any service after that. Noticed 4 waiters/waitresses conversing and hanging out at hostess station, three different times during out 15 min wait. Got up and left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-jackson-3
