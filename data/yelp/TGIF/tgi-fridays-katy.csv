TIffany W.,"Katy, TX",0,1,2,1.0,2/22/2017,"Enjoyed the service until I ordered my food to-go and got home only to discover hair in my rice. I called immediately and was told everyone wears a hair net and no one has long hair. She then went on to say she would credit the rice as if I would eat around the hair. Yucky place would never go back. Pictures are worth a thousand words, what a great way to end my Birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy?start=20

Rebecca S.,"Sealy, TX",23,3,2,1.0,7/28/2017,"We had perhaps the worst experience at a restaurant my family has ever had. While we were seated quickly, it took 15 minutes for a server to show up for our drink order. Since we had that extra time, we were ready to order our food as well. We ordered normal food off the menu and then the waiting started... it took about 10 minutes for our water to show up but only for some of us. Then we asked for our teas we had ordered and about 15 minutes later we asked again. About 45 minutes in our server said our food was coming. After an hour she said it was coming again. Finally the tea showed up (unsweet iced tea). At the 1 and a half mark the food came out - incorrect and only for some of us, burnt and cold. Another 15 minutes and a manager showed up saying oh - those two entrees you are waiting for were burnt and we threw them out but the reorder is almost ready. The server came back 10 minutes later and said that another server had taken the reorder... after two hours, two people received no food and the rest of us barely ate our poor excuse for dinner. No apologies from the staff. $108 and barely anyone fed! Ugh!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy?start=20
Asena O.,"Katy, TX",3,94,24,5.0,9/27/2015,"I'm not sure why they currently have 2.5 stars, but I always have a great time here! I visit this location frequently and have never had bad service or bad food. Normally I order French onion soup or potstickers, which are both delicious! This time I ordered the sizzling chicken and cheese, it was amazing! I didn't know that Friday's would have food this good to be honest. It's three chicken breasts on top of melted cheese and onion and peppers. You also get two big scoops of creamy mashed potatoes. I loved it! Each bite was better than the last.  I highly recommend this location along with the sizzling chicken and cheese.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy?start=20
C B.,"Houston, TX",4,42,173,3.0,6/24/2015,"We visited this location yesterday afternoon using a birthday gift card.   There were scarcely any cars in the parking.  As soon as you opened the door, there was a mild dirty mop or fishy smell that lingered in the air.  I couldn't smell it near our table towards the rear of the restaurant.  A couple of the waiters looked bored. I don't blame them.  Our waitress, Meghan, was friendly.   I was holding my breath for the food not knowing what to expect with a smell. There's no way I'd have paid for food that matched that odor.  The Jack Daniel's Burger and CA club and fries were tasty with a minimal wait.    I honestly won't be visiting again though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy?start=20

I normally visit the Friday's in Sugar Land (which always deserves 5 starts from me), but I was in the Katy area and was hungry- I also wanted to use my rewards points, which is why I didn't go to another restaurant. The waitress was friendly but overworked or ""busy"" - her words.  The food quality was mediocre, which is surprising because Friday's is my favorite restaurant.    Crack in the sauce cup for potstickers. Potstickers were overcooked.  Mushrooms served with dinner (allergic). Waitress forgot to put in our dessert.  The female manager was unapologetic.

We had a table of eight people five of our plates came out wrong not once but twice they still did not get it right and the third time they bring me the complete wrong plate of food and this was after I asked for a manager then the manager comped my meal just my meal also not any of the other people at the table even though their stuff was wrong as well and then the waiter brought me a ticket that was wrong.. This restaurant was not busy at all for a Friday night there was no reason we had to wait 30 minutes almost just to get our tickets we would ask for drinks it would take him 10 minutes or more to bring them to us absolutely ridiculous and the manager was not any help at all!!!

Aaron C.,"San Francisco, CA",63,3,,1.0,1/11/2018,"Gross!!! Food tastes frozen and microwaved.  Haven't been here since I was a youth and never will come back.

When I told the waitress it was gross she didn't even get an eye , she was too worried about the two neanderthals she was flirting with.

Shana H.,"Houston, TX",48,170,86,1.0,9/13/2016,"We came here after shopping a little at Katy mills mall. (Also, this is a smoking bar, eww) There was no wait, yet it took our server about 5 mins to come greet us. We sat in a section where one other family sat, the floors were filthy. The tables had been re-set, yet no one thought to sweep under them. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands before eating and one stall is out of order, the sinks are stopped up, trash coming out of the sanitary bins on the floor. No soap in one dispenser. I was actually in there with the host, and she saw the soap dispenser empty but decided to mind her business. Ok cool. My boyfriend went into the men's room, and reported the same exact conditions, especially with the sinks. Couldn't convince him to take pics haha.  Food: got it quickly, but my food was not hot. My steak was overcooked but I was scared to send it back. Our server was not friendly or enthusiastic at all. My son had an empty cup almost the entire time we were there but was never offered a refill. In fact, he only checked on us like twice, once after we had asked for more napkins. My husband actually got up and got them from the bar, when we mentioned this to the server, his reply was ""oh"". Nice. I did not finish my food, nor did I take it home. My son would not touch his sliders. We are actually fans of TGIF, but will never be back to this location. It left a bad taste in our mouths, literally. Also, there were several servers standing around watching the game instead of cleaning up an obvious mess. There was no manager to be seen, and even if he/she was there they must be been blind to not see this crap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy
Megan C.,"Katy, TX",183,118,659,1.0,8/12/2017,What a disappointment! Firs we were seated at a dirty table so my husband had to wipe it off. Then the server came and took our drink order. And things went even further south from that point. We ordered the highly publicized endless apps and were very excited.when our potato skins & boneless buffalo wins come they looked old and clearly reheated. We asked for small plates to eat off of but when they didn't show we dig in. But just when you take that first bite you are shocked to have a like warm skin and cold wing. We were so hungry we kept eating but when our second round of cheese sticks and quesadilla showed up with again still no plates I couldn't go pas one. If I wanted to eat Luke warm and obviously reheated food I would have hit the freezer section and kroger and gone home. When my salad and soup showed the disappointment continued. My soup was so cold I sent it back and the server said he would microwave it to make it hotter! MICROWAVE IT!!! Why is it not hot to start? The ranch on my salad tasted sour so I was then done with it all. My husband got a burger and ordered it medium. When he was finished she then said that was a well done burger but  he was so hungry he didn't want to wait for a new one to come out so he went with it. We told the server how disappointed we were with the food and he said he didn't cook it so he was sorry. Then about 30 minutes after leaving my husband and I were sick for the rest of the night. I hope a health inspector goes and checks the temp of the food in this place because they clearly are having issues! *** never going back*****,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy
Michelle L.,"Katy, TX",73,70,60,4.0,1/9/2017,"This place actually surprised me- the food was delicious. I haven't been to a TGI Fridays in years and never found this restaurant to be all that special or appealing. However, I went with a group of friends to visit our friend Amy, who is a hostess at this location. I ordered the Bourbon Barrel chicken and had steamed broccoli and their tomato and mozarella salad as my two sides. Which by the way, comes in at less than 500 calories for the entire meal. Score! Everything tasted fantastic and I'm quite pleased that TGIF has some healthier, lower cal menu items to choose from. Our waitress was also incredibly sweet.

The chicken and waffles caught my attention, right away...to make up for my ""go to"" place having taken it off of the menu. First off, the service we received was splendid. I can't recall the lady's name, but she had a very pleasant attitude, acted if she wanted to serve us, and was very informative - without being asked - when it came to the menu. Her cordiality made us want to stay for a while, which is hardly ever the case when we go to restaurants.  At any rate, the bulk of the order, between my girlfriend, my kiddo, and myself was...wait for it...wait for it...Chicken and Waffles! It came with chipotle maple syrup, which she described as having just a little kick and she opted to just give the kiddo the plain maple syrup, as a precaution.  When the food landed...the chicken strip, on top of the waffle, were prepared with my kind of fried. And when we added the chipotle maple syrup...Sirens! Sirens, baby!

The first thing we encounter when we walk through door is the hostess greets us with a look, then tells us to wait because she has to find a table but we have to go sit in the waiting area and not stand by the door. We wait for a clean table but to my surprise, the table we were seated at was quite dirty and was only swept where you could see.....ok that's gross.  So we proceed to order from our waitress, who actually tries to walk away without taking all of the orders and is not very communicative or pays very much attention to anything. The food takes over an hour to prepare, we never receive any drink refills or even a ""how is everyone doing"".  Once we receive our food, half of it is prepared incorrectly and unfinished.  The waitress comes to the table a total of 4 times throughout the God awful 2 1/2 hour time frame we were there, and then the ticket actually suggests an 18% tip...yeah, not gonna happen.  Don't waste your time or money, neither are worth it!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy

The waiter DJ served us and was helpful at first until we were ready to order. Then he didn't appear for 20 minutes, we had to ask another waiter where he was because we told him just 5 more minutes.... Anyways, he didnt even bring us our food, the other waiter did. All DJ did was take our order and that was pretty much it. When we went to pay, he had our cards for about 20 more minutes. I told my friends to check their bank accounts and one of them was charged 3 times for all of our checks that were split..... Then another was charged for two of the checks combined together and then her original check. So they were both overcharged 86 dollars!!!

I'm not exaggerating when I say it was the nastiest lemonade I have ever tasted and I am a lemonade lover. It is usually what I order in any restaurant. It was so sour it was unbearable. This lemonade just killed out whole experience their. I think it killed my taste buds because after the drink everything just seemed to taste bland.

The portion sizes are ridiculous - $12.00 for a chicken breast plate, ok that's fine, but they butterfly the chicken beforehand and take half of it off the plate.  So I'm basically getting half a chicken breast with some sauce and veggies for $12.00. Don't let Guy Fieri fool you - their barbecue is not anything to write home about.  The sauce isn't made fresh, it is shipped from across the country in bottles.  The meats are overcooked because the lawyers don't want to risk any food-borne sickness.  I'm sure Guy wishes he could take back those commercials he made when he sold his integrity. Also, the desserts aren't made fresh, they are shipped in boxes in refrigerated trucks.  I know most places do this, which is why I also avoid most desserts. Now, I have nothing against chain restaurants.  Some I think are actually pretty good.  This one, however, you can just tell that the place is run by accountants, not chefs.  2 stars, sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy?start=60
Tom O.,"Katy, TX",12,32,,2.0,1/23/2014,I stayed away for about a year due to 2 or 3 bad experiences but my wife and went back last night and sure enough it was still bad. I have never before ordered shrimp and the restaurant did not have tarter sauce. The blue cheese salad dressing was mayonnaise with sprinkles of blue cheese. The shrimp were undercooked but the water and ice were just fine.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy?start=60
Claude K.,"Houston, TX",12,75,27,2.0,5/28/2010,"Oh, another chain restaurant that disappoints. I actually visited this joint today with a few friends. The place was fairly busy, which was probably why the service was so ridiculously slow. The waiter was very courteous and seated us in a clean booth. My friend's potato skins were tasty, but nothing special. I had forgotten to ask the server to omit the bleu cheese in my Pecan Chicken salad with Honey Mustard, so I had to pick it out manually. This was my fault, so I won't hold it against the restaurant.  The chicken was mediocre- processed and dry. The crust was too thick and wasn't crunchy enough. The lettuce was fresh, which was pleasant. There was an excessive amount of cranberries and candied pecans in the salad, which is better than a lack thereof, but it caused the salad to be unbearably sweet. I felt guilty for eating it! All in all, a very so-so experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy?start=60
Elaine W.,"Katy, TX",890,127,2,1.0,5/20/2013,"What happened to the good 'ole days when TGIF was actually an awesome place to have dinner & drinks? Had dinner here over the weekend & sadly we were in utter disbelief on how bad the food was. After looking over the extensive dinner menu we decided to start off with loaded potatoes skins, fried mozzarella & boneless buffalo wings as an appetizer. Let me tell ya there was absolutely nothing loaded about the these potato skins. They looked like pieces of flat bread with melted cheese and a whole lot of sour cream. The mozzarella sticks were also deflated & served cold. The wings and celery sticks were honestly the best part of the entire appetizer.  Moving on, to the dinner portion of the meal. The pictures on the menu looked really good so we ordered from the Jack Daniels selection. Ohh man, was that another mistake. I ordered the JD grilled salmon and choose mashed potatoes and rice pilaf as my two sides. The salmon was flavorless and dry, dry, dry! Half of it stuck on the piping hot skillet it was served on. They gave me one scoop of mashed potatoes, the presentation looked like something you would get in prison. The rice pilaf was nothing more than old white rice with some dill mixed into it, that too was all stuck to the skillet. It was just soooo horrible. The best part of this $16 meal was the Jack Daniels sauce they served on the side. My husband ordered the JD grilled chicken & fried shrimp meal and again we couldn't believe what we were seeing before our eyes. An extra small dry and flavorless chicken breast served with dry zucchini and once again that unappealing scoop of mashed potatoes. The prices were outrageous and portions ridiculous. We left there paying $76 dollars. We felt robbed & sadly for me I had to come home and cook dinner after an hour or so. Stay far, far away from this place! $76 bucks is a lot of money to be wasted & disappointed when going out. Next time I'll buy 3 pounds of fresh salmon, chicken & shrimp and grill them all to perfection and have plenty of leftovers, thank you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy?start=60

Paul D.,"Austin, TX",148,407,2550,3.0,3/20/2013,"We were in Houston and was getting hungry for lunch.  I saw TGI Fridays and headed there. This place looked pretty much new so it was very clean inside and out. We sat in bar seating area and was quickly told they allow smoking in there after 2 pm. Since it was 12 noon we were fine, so we order our drinks and food off the menu.  I decided to have the chicken fingers and they were not bad.  It is kind of hard to screw up chicken fingers but I have seen it done.  Our server aka bartender kept our drinks full and provided us with great service. I enjoyed staring at all his flare. It kind of reminder of Office Space.  Well we had a good experience here and got back on the road back to Austin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy?start=40
Josh C.,"Richmond, TX",96,15,,2.0,5/19/2014,"Keeping in mind that this was a Monday evening, and simply not that busy, here is my review. I will not be going back. UNPROFESSIONAL. We were seated, with our three small children, in a busy intersection of the restaurant, so we took the liberty of moving 8 feet away for a more secluded table. When we saw the girl who seated us coming back with the high chair and booster seat, I said from a distance that we preferred to sit at this other table. The girl appeared to look at her friend and roll her eyes. SLOW. After sitting for about 6 minutes waiting for any type of contact from our server, the same girl who seated us came over and said that our server would be with us soon... Another 4 minutes, and he actually did come. It took 5 minutes to get three waters and another 3 or 4 minutes to get the two fountain drinks ordered at the same time. The waiter disappeared for 5-7 minutes twice before taking our food order, and after taking the order, we waited at least 20 minutes for the food to come. Then, he disappeared for 15 minutes, and I had to hunt him down, actually asking another server to tell him we needed our check. After waiting 5-6 more minutes for our check, I had to go to the bar area and find the dude. There I found him and two other employees huddled around the computer trying to figure out how to enter a coupon into the system. FOOD WAS MEDIOCRE. We had the Chicken and Shrimp Cajun Pasta, a full rack of baby back ribs, and a kids order of macaroni and cheese. The fries that came with the ribs and the cold and soggy, the ribs were dry and, at best bland, at worst, somewhat pasty tasting. i don't know how else to explain it. The cajun pasta was blah, not bad, but not good. Too hot, not flavorful enough. Two shrimp in the entire plate, not much more chicken. Avoid this place..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy?start=40
Heywood J.,"Katy, TX",0,38,1,1.0,3/2/2015,Does not deserve even one star. My wife and I went during lunch on a Friday and it was pretty much dead yet we still had to wait for the nonexistent host to seat us. After about 5 minutes we just went and sat at the bar which was gross so we sat at the cleanest table we could find. Roughly 25 minutes later an awkward and overworked bartender came over and asked us for drink orders. I asked for a rebel IPA and she got a margarita. The beer was flat and tasted like the tap hadn't been cleaned in months. I asked for a bottled beer instead. The bartender poured that into a dirty glass with a black sticky substance on the inside that got into my beer. We quickly stood up left our drinks on the bar and told the girl we were leaving. Never again will I go here. I typically avoid chains and this is why.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy?start=40
Mike S.,"Houston, TX",0,38,,5.0,10/25/2014,"The Food is typical for a Fridays. The bar area is the place to be at this store. I've been a regular for years. The bar staff is excellent, the service is great, and the mood in the bar area is enjoyable. Its fun but not obnoxious, social but not club-like, and there are regulars who are friendly but not cliquish or overt. The bar area serves full menu at the tables and the bar. The bar is kid friendly. The bar staff is much more conscientious about food quality, presentation, and service than the rest of the restaurant. Special compliments to bartender Christina.

I ordered potato skins and the skins arrived about 20 minutes later, and they were the worst tasting skins ever.   They did not taste like potato skins....they had to have been fried, not oven baked,. they were thick and cut in shapes that....(not the normal 1/2 potato shape),.....they had an oily, crispy, nasty taste, and I could not eat them.   I asked him if they changed the recipe, and of course, I didnt know how you could change it, but he said NO.  I said I could not eat them.  He charged me for them, and I left.....

Lauren N.,"Austin, TX",24,65,45,1.0,11/1/2015,"We walked in (a group of 5) and it was not busy AT ALL and our waiter, Zach,  took at least 10 minutes to come greet us. We got here at 3:15pm so it wasn't busy. Another family came in after us and they were served their drinks and food before us. From the time we walked in to the time we got our food was ONE HOUR. Then they didn't even bring us all of our food at the same time. The food sucked and there is nothing special about it at all. The hamburger was bland and tasteless and the fries were too salty. We asked for refills on our drinks and extra napkins which never came. I had to take silverware off another table just to use the napkin. Finally at the very end after we asked AGAIN we got refills. Such a waste of time. I'll NEVER go again. Sorry to say it but Zach was the worst. He had an excuse for everything that went wrong and he looked high and didn't even come check on how our meal was. It was obvious that he just didn't care at all. Overall, took 1 hour 30 min before we were able to leave. I've never been so happy to leave a restaurant.

( aren't, those appetizers a bit pricey? $10.60 for Jalapeño Poppers)- we just ordered entrees.  Food arrived in reasonable time delivered by an alternative server. Shrimps looked ok and my wife said they tasted ok too- but the fries were cool and over salted. By Sirloin Steak was cooked medium rare as requested- but it was pretty tough- not enough to send back but pretty close.  We finished meal, and waited and waited for our original server to bring our bill- another 10 mins wait- but the bill came quick from then on together with another apology that he 'don't have my head on today'.

Shanitra M.,"Houston, TX",0,41,2,2.0,9/3/2012,"We just ate there this evening. We were actually going back to Antonios to eat dinner but they were closed today :-(.  First of all when we walked in, the three girls up front were giggling and talking and did not even notice that we came inside. They normally open the door to greet you but not today. It was as though we interrupted them from their conversation. One girl said ""oh, we did not notice you"" They then assumed we were with the couple that came in the door after us. Anyway I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon and my husband ordered a steak and ribs plate. The corn was hard and the bbq sauce was gross. I requested that my burger be cooked well done with bacon and our server asked if i wanted pickled onion lettuce tomato. I told her i wanted pickle and onions. There was one single tiny onion on the burger and no pickles. I asked for ketchup because their was none on our table so she grabbed the empty bottle from the table across from us. I also asked for mustard and my husband asked for water., She brought them to the table and said ""mustard"" ""water"" with an attitude as though it was an inconvenience.  the burger was bland, it had lots of grill marks on it that were perfectly even so it is obvious that they buy the burger with the marks on it. No flavor. Dessert wasnt great.. an oreo ice cream desert and a brownie with ice cream. The brownie was burning hot  and extremely soft- i believe it was microwaved for too long.

Hostess: How are y'all? Me: Good. You? Hostess: I'm ready for Friday. Me: In here, isn't it always Friday? ::crickets chirping in the silence:: I know that is goes against all my instincts to love a chain restaurant but I can't fight my infatuation with Fridays.  The obsession is rooted in the Jack Daniels BBQ glaze. I ask for at least 3 sides of it not matter what meal I have ordered.  It goes well with EVERYTHING!  I also love their 3 for $12 deal.  If you are splitting the meal with a friend it makes this restaurant pretty affordable.  Otherwise, most dishes run between $10 and $15 which is a little steep for my taste. Parmesan crusted chicken, Jack Daniel flat iron steak, Oreo Madness, Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, sweet potato fries...I can't help myself.  Fridays is my foodie guilty pleasure. Drink prices can be a little steep so I usually try to order whatever cocktail is on special for the month (located inside the front drink cover).  Service is usually decent.  They lose 1 star for not having a regular happy hour for those of us that don't want to sit in the smokey bar section.  If they amended this, we would probably go back to having our weekly happy hour at TGI Fridays.  Until then, we will stick with practically free Chuys.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-katy?start=40
