Alina A.,"Kennesaw, GA",40,86,204,5.0,9/29/2017,You can't beat a $6 Long Island and endless apps.  This is a good place to just go chill and catch up with your people.

Terry J.,"Roswell, GA",3,62,5,3.0,11/6/2017,"The commercial was for a full rack of ribs for a special price. When the dish came I noticed that the length was a full rack however the width was a little smaller than other places. I got the BBQ sauce but they had a couple of other options available, including one with bacon. They weren't fall off the bone but not tough at all. Also the pit stop skins were delicious. The bacon was NOT bacon bits but freshly cut bacon. The server was busy but friendly and nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3
Jerica B.,"Cartersville, GA",55,7,8,3.0,11/19/2017,"I had gotten their new Mac n cheese burger and  would have to give them kudos. Once I received the burger, I was surprised that it actually look like the burger. The only thing I didn't like about it is, is that it was over cooked. I felt like it needed some sort of special sauce on it because it tasted a bit dry. Also, we ordered a spinach dip with chips and it was delicious but they should consider giving more chips then just half a hand full. Overall the service was great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3
Juanita C.,"Kennesaw, GA",14,33,1,5.0,12/29/2017,"Visited this restaurant today because of the recent TV ads for ribs.  I had the Big Ribs.  It was fall off the bone and there were several options for sauce.

Krista M.,"Saint Paul, MN",7,287,145,4.0,5/27/2017,"5/18 Our little boy, who seems to exist solely on ""chicken and fries"", announced that he wanted to go to Fridays for ""noodles.""  My husband and I were in such shock we couldn't argue so we found this one on our way out of Atlanta. I prefer to go places we don't have back home, but it was actually kind of fun to compare this Fridays to ours back home. I've been a Rewards member for ages and with that you get free chips and salsa.  At home, you get a tiny little cup of salsa that runs out after two chips.  Here in Kennesaw, we got a small bowl.  It was awesome.  Everyone got salsa for more than a single chip! :)   Our server was really friendly and attentive.  I got one of the new bacon burgers, kiddo got his noodles, and my Cajun-pasta-loving spouse switched it up on us and got a salad with strawberries and chicken.  The food was fantastic.  Exactly what we've come to expect from Friday's. The only real issue we had was that my husband wanted a beer and they were out of nearly everything and then they were switching the keg on one.  He finally ended up with something half way through his lunch.  To compensate, though, they only charged us for the smaller pint glass. It was a really nice atmosphere and had nice décor.  It was actually pretty nice to stick with something familiar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3
Elizabeth S.,"Dalton, GA",3,39,,1.0,4/1/2017,"I grew up in the area so over the course of approximately 10-12 years, I've spent over a $1000 dollars at this location - EASILY.  I moved out of state after grad school and met up with my family at this location a little over a month ago. It was the ABSOLUTE worst service I've ever experienced in this restaurant. One person in our party (of only four) ordered unlimited appetizers and it was slow getting them out to the table & even getting the order correct.  After asking for a booth, we were seated near the bar instead with a black female waitress whose attitude was atrocious. (I wish I could remember her name.) After all the Cajun Chicken and Shrimp I've ordered from Friday's, I will not be visiting this location anytime soon.  My advice is to wipe it all out and start over. TGIF's already seems to be going out of business more and more, and this one looks like it's on its way out.

I was very, very confused. She also got our order wrong, and all of the waiters and waitresses were just standing around not helping anyone, yet they were singing and having a good time while our food was still not out and our drinks were still not refilled! And our waitress who was never there I say again, had the nerve to ask us if we wanted our change back, we had at least $20 in change, did she really think she was going to get a $20 tip for her poor service??? The only good thing about it was the shrimp scampi pasta and the french fries were delicious. However the service here sucks.The waiters were also sitting around and ordering food and eating, I just didn't understand that because our table still didn't have food and I had to go to another table to get ketchup because our's was empty.

Nise F.,"Tennessee Ridge, TN",10,75,31,4.0,5/31/2016,"First let me say, I had not been into a TGIF in such a long time. Where I live, they closed it down so when I had the opportunity to come to this one in Kennesaw, I jumped right on it.  I am only giving this location a 4 star instead of a 3 star because of the experience I had. Me and my family were greeted by the best waiter. I can't remember his name but it started with a ""Z"" and it was not a common name. He said he had just turned 21. He is probably the only guy that works there with a name starting with a Z.   He smiled and attended to us just the right amount of times and you could tell that he enjoyed his job. Heck, if he didn't enjoy it, he fooled us. He was that good! You know you are good when you put smiles on a 12 year old's face.  This guy was super awesome.   The food was just okay. I was not impressed. It did not taste how it used to taste. I ordered a fried shrimp with fries and I've had better.

Tori B.,"Marietta, GA",47,69,110,1.0,3/29/2017,"By far the most disappointing TGI Friday's location I've ever been to. When we arrived, there were 4 people in the dining room. The hostess took us to a table and we asked if we could please have a booth instead. So she said ""I guess"" & took us to a half table half booth. Fine, although there were plenty of empty booths in the restaurant at the time. The table next to us had an issue with their food which was our first indication that this place wouldn't be the best. We ordered appetizers and entree, but I told the server I didn't want the entree until we were finished with our apps. They came out at the same time, of course. But, we managed, no big deal. We noticed how slowly kitchen items were coming out and we're surprised since the restaurant was so slow. At one point a police officer came in to ask some questions, and once he left you could hear a member of the staff shout ""Woohoo! I'm not going to jail today!"" Totally unprofessional, as was the table full of serving staff and a manager sitting around on their phones near the bar. Will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3

Chadwick D.,"Dallas, GA",4,11,,1.0,10/23/2012,"My mother and I have given this place more than enough chances, but after our most recent visit I can honestly say that they have no more chances; we're done with TGI Friday's. The food has been up and down there for years and my first visit there back when I was a kid should've been a sign of things to come; I asked for a burger well done and got the equivalent of a burnt piece of charcoal. We went back for the first time in many years a year or two ago and it was decent, so we thought they had gotten their act together; but alas, we were wrong again. But our most recent visit was easily one of the worst meals we've ever eaten. I had the korean steak tacos and my mom had the bruschetta chicken pasta. The pasta was overcooked, the sauce was weird, and the chicken was dried out and burnt; but the tacos took the cake. They came out with a bunch of stuff on them that wasn't on the menu listing and looked absolutely unappetizing; but they smelled even worse. The best way to describe the smell is rotten garbage and it made my stomach turn, but I decided to take at least one bite because sometimes things can smell bad but taste good; this however, was not one of those times. I spit the bite I took out faster than a bullet leaving the chamber of a gun; it was absolutely disgusting and made me instantly nauseous. And the rice that came as a side with it wasn't much better; it tasted like it was cooked in some sort of chemical solution. Sadly, I think the problem isn't just with this restaurant in particular; i think it's a problem with the company itself. Their food just doesn't cut it and I think they know it considering how they hired Guy Fieri to endorse their stuff (which lasted about a month and I'm betting it ended after he actually tried their food) and how they've used multiple food competition shows to come up with new menu items. It's sad to say, but I don't see the company lasting much longer with the quality of food their serving. In short, I can't recommend TGI Friday's to anyone, except someone I didn't overly like; but even then i would feel bad. Just avoid this craptastic chain and their sucky food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3?start=60

Both cooked well done. 30 minute wait til our food came out. My steak tasted good but it wasn't juicy. The Parmesan steak fries had like weird juice around it and on it.. I guess it's oil.

I ordered a vodka cran and my brother ordered a beer. our server came back with waters all around, and left. didnt see her for 30 min, and then our COLD appetizers came, which we sent back immediately. still no alcohol at the table 45 min later. my brother went to the EMPTY bar, ordered and paid for his beer there, and came back to the table.  our drinks then arrived with our entrees and remade apps, and our server asked where the beer came from, the apologized because the bar was 'very busy'. yea, except there was no customers at the bar and not a lot of tables in the restaurant. my drink was weak and tasted like cran, but at this point, i didnt care and just wanted to eat and leave.  half way through our meal, two bussers came with buckets and started picking things up off our table, asking us if we were done. I dont think so, we all still had more than half  our entrees!  we asked for to go boxes and left.  round two, a few months later we decided to try it again, but sat at the bar. bar tender took 10 min to make a long island in front of me. because he was too busy talking to his gf. me and my gf were the only other people there! our food took exceptionally long too, but at least it wasnt cold like last time.  Wont ever go back. shame, me and my gf used to go there every friday after work too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3?start=40

After walking up and asking a hostess for service, our waitress arrived. She took our drink order but we had to ask if she would go ahead and take our order (based on our wait and the fact that our menus were closed, she should have asked if we'd like to place our food order at the same time as our drink order). We ordered a tall Tanqueray and Tonic, emphasis on ""tall"". The drink came in a highball glass. We were charged for the extra tonic so have to blame that one on the bartender.  The manager came over and apologized for everything and promised us  a discount on our meal. Of course that didn't happen either.

Rose S.,"San Mateo, CA",0,109,10,5.0,7/10/2014,"I'm truly astonished by some of the unfavorable reviews this establishment has received as that has not been my experience at all and I drop by often.  This location serves a mixed crowd as does most of the Greater Atlanta area.  I've been there on Thursdays when they have a small band and it's not ""Ghetto"" as someone stated. I have to give props to Ken, the bartender who makes my favorite drink, Strawberry Shortcake consistently, delectably delicious each time I visit.  It's one of those drinks that, if you don't follow the recipe in the book, can turn out tasting a bit off.  Ken makes it perfect each time and I firmly believe that consistency is one of the signs of a great restaurant.  TGIF's may want to put the drink back on the regular menu as, when it came out, their female customers were asking me the name of the drink.  Some of us women do have a sweet tooth and hiding it away in the bartender's book limits the drink options for women.  We're usually lucky enough to get Erica as our server, who knows our favorite menu and drink items by heart and warmly greets us each time we visit.  She is very attentive to her customer's needs and quickly delivers the goods. TGIF has a great menu where you can drop by for a quick bite and drink, offering 3 appetizers for $15, all offerings very tasty, leaving you with a desire to return and order them again.  Their full menu is equally appealing. In closing, I just want to say that Ken and Erica's joy in their job is evident in the way in which they masterfully handle a multitude of tasks in a busy environment with a smile on their face and a care for the customer.  Exemplary!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3?start=40

Tricia B.,"Austell, GA",27,136,34,2.0,6/10/2012,"Had not been to a TGI Fridays in years and years...used to love them when I lived in VABeach.  Went at 2 in the afternoon, so getting a table was not a problem. Service was attentive and everyone was polite.  Was shocked at the prices on the menu...for a chain restaurant that doesn't really specialize in anything, they had the prices of a fine-dining steak place!  Appetizers ran around $10 and meals ran close to $20...for chain food??!??!  We decided to get appetizers as we didn't want to spend $50+ at a TGIFridays.  Co-foodie got the mozzarella sticks.  They were good and you got 6 of them...but they were $9. I just bought a box of them at Kroger (TGIFriday brand; exact same cheese sticks) for $5.  Not even any garnish...just a tiny amount of either marinara or honey mustard. They were hot and cheesy and tasty, just not $9 worth (plus tax and tip!).  I ordered the 3-dip appetizer.  You got a basket of tortilla strips and 3 dips...hummus, salsa, and cheese dip.  The chips were almost inedible...some were crispy, some were so chewy that you could not bite off a piece.  The salsa had a really good flavor, but was as thin as water so you really couldn't scoop it onto a chip.  I love hummus and hummus is NOT hard to make...but they had so much garlic (and don't get me wrong, I LOVE garlic) that you couldn't eat it. You couldn't taste lemon, you couldn't taste olive oil, you couldn't even taste chickpeas...all you could taste was garlic.  The cheese dip was barely room temperature, so I sent it back. It was returned slightly warm (still not hot). I didn't feel like sending it back again and couldn't eat the hummus and sure couldn't fill up on the runny salsa, so decided to eat it even though it was barely warm.  Then found out that it, also, was inedible...it was SWEET! What on earth do you put in a jalapeno cheese dip that is sweet?!?  Bizarre.  When the server came to clear the table and asked how everything was (my plate was still very obviously full), I told him how disappointed I was in mine and he just apologized...with no offer to comp it. Unusual since I had barely touched it...it's not like I had eaten it all and THEN complained...salsa, hummus, and cheese were all almost full.  I could have complained to the manager, but just didn't want the hassle.  The server should have offered (unless they are not allowed to).  All in all, will not be back.  For those prices, everything should have been way ABOVE good...the food should have been +++++++....but it didn't even come close.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3?start=80

Christy H.,"Marietta, GA",3,27,30,4.0,7/11/2014,"We came here around 2:30 and it wasn't very busy. They seat everyone in the middle so it appears to look crowded. The service was pretty slow. I only saw about 2 waitresses and they were running all over the place trying to maintain their customers. We didn't see much of our waitress but when she was around she was very nice and helpful.  I ordered the jack Daniels half rack of runs with fries and coleslaw. We waited about 20 mins for our food which wasn't too bad since 4/5 of us got ribs. The food was great! Everyone enjoyed everything. The ribs are the best here!  If you use to come here for the Guinness Shake, forget it. They don't have Guinness on draft anymore. Their bathrooms were kinda gross too. There was a missing handle and water everywhere. Plus it was sticky on the floors. The strawberry lemonade tasted like it came from a powder, so wouldn't recommend it.  Overall we had a good experience here so I don't know why the reviews are so bad. They have free wifi!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3?start=20
John G.,"Kennesaw, GA",100,278,473,1.0,9/30/2015,"Been here twice and both bad experiences, thought I would give them another chance - failed miserably to both me and both my guests.  Embarrassing me so much after wrong drink orders, 40 min wait to get food at 9 pm at night for 3 people and still getting the food ice cold.  I had the Jack Daniels Steak, Ribs and Shrimp (steak was supposed to be well done - RAW in middle as was the SHRIMP - HOW BAD DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO SCREW THAT UP?!?!).  One guys fish was ice cold on bottom, so it sat in the heat lamp how long?   No seasoning on anything, just poured over the Jack Daniels sauce - vegetables were hardly cooked.  We mostly just got everything to go which our waitress never had a clue when I stated very bluntly that I thought we could cook them at home better or use them for dog food. Manager never came over to check on us and even after we sent food back.  Paid the check and left as I didn't want to argue with the manager in front of the 3 others.  Called even to the 1800 # and registered the complaint, they told me a manager would call, never did.  Great reason to never come back again.  To add insult to injury one of my guests was a Federal Agent and the waitress said if he had a gun he wasn't allowed?!?!  IDIOTS!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kennesaw-3?start=20
