J M.,"Killeen, TX",0,89,247,3.0,11/22/2017,"Dine in here this afternoon since hubby wanted to try TGIF since we haven't been here for years and wanted to try something different. It was slow afternoon, I guess since a lot of people are at work or grocery shopping for Thanksgiving. Anyways, we were greeted right away by our server soon as we sat down. I ordered the Cheeseburger, extra crispy bacon on the side. Hubby ordered the Crispy Chicken Burger, and we also wanted to try their off the bone ribs with the jack daniel sauce. And asked to substitute the fries with steamed broccoli, and for it to be crisp and not mushy.  Our food came out like 10 to 15 minutes. The burgers looked fresh and hot. My bacon was crispy and on the side. The fries were good, and my burger actually came out good. But my hubbys crispy chicken burger wasn't so great unfortunately. The chicken was dry and the avocado was to soft that made the burger mushy. Although the ribs came out looking good, but it turned out too dry and tough. So much for the false advertisement of fall off the bone ribs!!! And it wasn't even hot. I'm assuming it was ribs from last night. The flavor was good, but it could have been better. We told the server about it and she mentioned that it wasn't baby back ribs, but it was still pork ribs. But she took it off our tab which was good. Maybe we will return someday but I will not try the ribs. Oh, and we tried the brownie for dessert and it was way too sweet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen
Taeyler G.,"Kapolei, HI",124,15,9,1.0,8/14/2017,"I generally enjoy TGI Fridays at this particular location, but today something was going on with the morale of the staff. I showed up at about 8.15PM on a Sunday, so not busy at all. The host was busy doing something with his phone and, when I did come in, didn't acknowledge me. I asked him where I should place an order to-go and he pointed to the bar. I had to ask him for a menu when I didn't see any at the bar. Worse was the bartender, who already seemed a bit frazzled. There were maybe four other people leisurely drinking in quiet at the bar when I sat down with my menu, ready to order my drink for here and food to-go. Shortly after I sat down, two more patrons sat beside me. The bartender finally asked me what I wanted to drink and I told him, showing my ID. He took the order of the couple next to me right after. I waited for ten minutes. Ten. Whole. Minutes. In those ten minutes he took other orders, walked around the BOH, and served the couple who sat down and ordered AFTER me. At no point did he arrive with my berry mojito. At which point I promptly grabbed my purse and left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen

Greg E.,"Killeen, TX",13,2,,1.0,1/1/2018,"Burgers were not well done, they were like shoe leather. They were so overcooked they tasted like a dog biscuit. Even our onion rings were burnt.

Tiahna P.,"Killeen, TX",102,150,120,5.0,10/20/2017,"I liked this spot despite all the bad I've heard about it, we came in around 10pm on a Thursday, and even though had half the restaurant blocked off, I still felt welcomed. It took a while for our orders to get taken because it looked like there was only one bartender and one waitress in there, but the waitress was amazing. She remembered our order perfectly and after that initial wait, we didn't wait long for anything. The bartender was Eh, but this waitress definitely picked up his slack. I got the veggie burger which was good, and he got the Turkey and Avocado BLT. She remembered our order perfectly and was so quick with it.

Myphuong T.,"Harker Heights, TX",0,1,,2.0,12/29/2017,"Never tried this place in all the 5 years we have been in Texas. We found out that we weren't missing a lot. No one was there when we entered the restaurant, waited about 2 minutes until someone came. Everything was dark and gloomy, and the decorations were very random. It took a little bit longer than other restaurants for the host to take our order. We got our food in a few minutes, it wasn't the best food. We ordered a mac and cheese, steak and ribs. The mac and cheese tasted microwaved. The steak was tasteless, and had this weird watery juice coming out of it. The ribs were great though, but not the sides. The sides were coleslaw and mashed potatoes for the ribs. The coleslaw tasted old and sour! It was rotten! The mashed potatoes tasted lime it came from a box, not the best!  For drinks, I ordered a ""strawberry slushy,"" but I got a very sweet strawberry lemonade. My family first thought it was a mistake, and asked for the real slushy. Apparently the lemonade was the slushy? The meal costed 37$, not worth it at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen

Five minutes arrive and we start to walk out. The manager says my food is ready. I tell him to ""eat a d**k I'm out of here!"" Mother F**ker charges me the full $10 for 1 serving of Endless Apps.

Raul V.,"Killeen, TX",88,12,2,1.0,7/4/2017,"Should have looked at ratings before coming here. Service was excellent- we had a young lady and a young man and tipped generously because they did real good. Too bsd the kitchen was not up to par. Both my bride and I ordered a Ceasar' Salad with grilled chicken, and French Onion Soup. Had soup first, but served with cellophane covered crackers. When we asked if they provided bread, they brought a basket of breadsticks..... and, yes, we were charged exrra. The soup was bitter and warm- not very appetizing. The grilled chicken was blah- tasteless! With a final bill of $41+ for the two of us, it was definitely not worth the price.

She was hardly seen so we had to stop other servers for refills on drinks. After someone else brought us our food she came put to ask how everything was. I told her our appetizers (cheese sticks) were empty. As in cheese sticks with no cheese. She laughed and said oh sorry! Well how is the food is it good? Is everything good? Umm no, I just complained about my ""appetizer"". Empty cheese sticks sitting on the plate because, well they are empty! She said ok good so the food is good? Obviously not listening we told Her ok thanks. She started to ask about desert. Wow lady we JUST got our entree can we have. A minute please? She began to ask everyone individually if they wanted desert or naw? She needed to know if we were good on that or if we were gonna be needing desert. At this point I was highly annoyed. so I had to ask her to just come back and check on us AFTER we had a chance to actually eat. Again we were asked ok so everything's good?

Angel B.,"Lancaster, TX",89,111,824,2.0,7/18/2015,"Let's start with the good: the hostess was really nice and our party was seated immediately. After that it goes down hill really fast.  I don't know if our server was new or just having an off day. But our service was pretty lackluster. Let's start with our table constantly being overlooked. At one point, I literally had to stand and wave my hand for her attention.  When she finally came to the table. We mentioned how long it had been and we were ready to order. Her response: ""Well we're busy."" So is every other damn restaurant on a Friday night. But that is no excuse. Not only was she annoying the hell out of us. The food runners were equally annoyed. Everyone in the section was getting the wrong food. How does that even happen? We weren't play musical tables. We saw a runner pass our table twice with our food. Finally, I had to say ""Hey! That's our food."" When she came over she said ""Ugh! She keeps mixing up the table."" Seriously! The entire section was waving down their food. It was just awful. The service last night was piss poor. This review really deserves 1 star; however our food was pretty descent. Endless apps is not enticing enough for me to come back.

Then she tells us that they also don't have steaks, chicken fingers, ranch, and salmon. I feel like every time we asked for something they didn't have it. We then ordered our free dessert and guess what? they didn't have that dessert either. So the server had the manager tell us they were out of the dessert.

(I drove from harker heights). When I sat at the bar and ordered my food, the guy that realized I was the one on hold for 12min (or just realized that he even had someone on hold to place an order) acted as if he was cleaning his area and picked up the phone and hung up; thinking I didn't notice. My phone was on speaker, and the call instantly ended. I called him out on it, as there was NO excuse or reasoning for his manner. I did talk to the manager and she was pleasant and understanding.

The portion size was enormous, so I decided to take my leftovers home to eat for my lunch the next day. After heating my meal the next day, my mouth got so ready for all this goodness. I ate two bites and felt something wrapping around my braces. I reached in my mouth and pulled out a long brunette hair. I thought I was going to die. This is the nastiest thing I have ever encountered. I was immediately sick. I didn't call them with my complaint die to me not living in Killeen and me never wanting to ever go to this place again.

Sirenalei D.,"Killeen, TX",0,4,3,1.0,4/2/2017,"Giving it a 1 star because I can't rate it in the negatives on this thing! My boyfriend and I went to this place before, SUCKED. Our family wanted to try it out today and we put in high expectations, our mistake. Our waitress addressed it was only her second week working there, cool. But she literally kept feeding us with excuses more than she fed us with the food we ordered. Like honestly we ordered the chip and dip appetizer and there was honestly 10 chips on our plate. Mind you, there were 6 of us! She told us to let her know when we needed a refill on the chips, so we did... at least 8 times and never gave us any refill that was promised... so we asked 2 different workers for the chips and still never got it. Wahhhhh. So then my little sister ordered mozzarella sticks and 1.) they were endless so they kept bringing in a lot to our table! 2.) It was all so cold and not so cooked when she gave it to us. Instead of the actual sauce for the sticks we ended up getting cocktail sauce. HOW DAT WORK? LMFAO. So then I'm thirsty right? Needed to gulp the unsatisfying service and food down, and I need a refill on my coke right? Didn't get any from our waitress. Instead, we had to get another waiters attention about it. Nice! To top it off the lady knew we were upset about just about everything and she didn't even care to apologize. Nothing. Again, there was a terrible excuse for everything it was to the point I couldn't take it anymore. I get it's her first few weeks but keep in mind... we're coming to give you something to do and to pay you. If it weren't for the customers......... I'm not one to complain but MAN.

We should have gone somewhere else instead of TGI Friday's. We were served by Cheyenne and I was sick so I decided to order soup. I asked her how big the soup was, she didn't understand my question so I asked if it was a cup or a bowl. She said ""bowl"" so I ordered it. When the order came back, after over 20 minutes(my husband ordered a chicken salad), she came with a cup filled 1/3. I told her that I wanted a bowl. She shuddered and said ""well that's how they are, sorry"" and walked away. After that, no refills, no checking if everything was alright; like she disappeared. She kept avoiding the table because she said I was not pleased. I then waited for the manager and told her about my experience. She gave us a discount and took the soup off my bill. She asked if I wanted anything but the damage was already done. I appreciate the action and treatment from the manager, however, we will not return to that location. I understand now why it was empty. I should have checked yelp before going in.

Potsticker appetizer was good, French onion soup and white cheddar cheese soup were all tasty as well. It too a little bit for the food to be brought out but not that big of a deal. Lauren was such a sweetheart and very attentive.

I tried the fried meatballs.  They're were ok.  Kinda pricey.  My date was really impressed with the Tuscan Spinach dip.  I was stoked about the Parmesan steak fries.  They never showed up.  Luckily, I did not have to pay for them.   I will make sure to get them next time. I'm eager to try some other stuff on the menu.  Will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen?start=40
Hilary S.,"Copperas Cove, TX",16,20,,2.0,6/30/2016,"I have lived in this area off and on for over 10 years and have enjoyed TGI Fridays for the better part of that time.  Good drink specials and decent lunch items.  I dont usually write reviews unless the service or experience stands in either a good or bad way.  The last two times we have been to Fridays it has not been worth the time, money or drive.  The bathrooms could use a deep cleaning, the table was dirty as well as the utensils.  But those are usually things i let slide if the food and service is good.  That was not the case this time, my food wich was a skillet, some how was cold.  The waitress disappeared several times, we would have liked to have a refill on our drinks at least and waited 10 mins to find her so we could get our check.  There were only at max 15 other people in the whole restaurant and her only table at the time.  I hope they step up their game here because with Fort Hood being so close they have the potential to make a great deal of money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen?start=40
Katrina J.,"Copperas Cove, TX",135,2,1,1.0,12/1/2016,"First of all, if I could have given no stars I would have. Secondly, we have no idea who took care of us because we never got the bartenders names. It's a Thursday night cowboys football game, it was only a light crowd and after tonight I can see why every restaurant in Killeen was busier than this place. It took several minutes to even be talked to, only to get sub-par service and be treated like they could care less if we were there. I'm in the service industry so I'm usually very understanding, but for the amount of customers and slow night this restaurant had, there was no excuse. When we finally got our food, over 20 minutes after we ordered, we realized we hadn't even been given napkins or silverware. At this point, we decided trying to stick it out to eat our food was not worth it. We asked for our check and boxes, only then to be given the first smile of the night and they had no problem cashing us out in a speedily manner. Definitely not worth the 50$ tab we had to pay. Would not recommend to any of our friends, and definitely will be warning against it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen?start=40
Xandria G.,"Wahiawa, HI",82,23,3,5.0,6/5/2014,Loved the customer service.  Tgif is always a great place to eat with a variety of menu choices.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen?start=40
Bambie K.,"Killeen, TX",33,10,2,2.0,9/3/2015,"Almost the worst service I've ever had. EVER. Food was decent, but if you want timely service, go elsewhere.  Never got a refill on my drink, although I was ready before the food came. Shantal was our waitress. Unbelieveable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen?start=40
G. A.,"San Diego, CA",64,86,166,4.0,1/19/2014,Loved the customer service here. Our waitress Had a pleasant attitude and checked up on us constantly for water and drink refills. The bar manager asked us how our drinks was and a couple of us were disappointed that the drinks weren't strong. She recommended to get a premium drink to get a better effect ha. She even recommend a custom concoction to help our friend with a cold and a raspy voice. It helped her out.  Over all our food was good and the service was great. Our server was friendly and had some good drink recocomendations. I would definitely come back next time I'm in town.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen?start=40

Nancy C.,"Killeen, TX",128,11,7,5.0,8/31/2015,The lunch specials and options are amazing. Totally in love with the ham and cheese sliders! Management and the bartenders just rock. And who can beat their beer prices and app specials?!? Love it! We will return often as usual!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen?start=40
Amanda W.,"Fort Hood, TX",4,21,,1.0,8/8/2014,Service was decent once the host actually sat us. There were about 8 cars in the parking lot but were told there was a wait because they were waiting on another server to show up. So we waited in a practically empty restaurant for over ten minutes. The food was gross (and I'm currently 38 weeks pregnant so I'll eat anything). It tasted microwaved and not worth the money at all. Safe to say we won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen?start=40
Tim C.,"Copperas Cove, TX",0,25,4,1.0,9/8/2014,Horrible service. Waitress never came by to check on our drinks. People playing bingo. Chicken was over cooker and taste like rubber.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen?start=40
Aj D.,"Killeen, TX",35,7,1,1.0,1/9/2015,Waitress smelled of BO and food was over priced and greasy.  The atmosphere was as if a 20ish hipster selected the music to accompany the 11 dollar hamburger.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen?start=40
Liam C.,"Fredericksburg, VA",1,24,,1.0,3/12/2015,"We went there today after the lunch time crowd and it was not busy. We waited for someone to come to take our drink orders. Appetizers came out slow for the amount of people that were there. I ordered the Jack Daniels chicken sandwich and it was just not made properly. It was missing the bacon, the Jack Daniels sauce, the onion strings and had very little of the special sauce on it. It also came out luke warm and I am guessing it sat in the window while the other persons burger was cooked. The chicken was also very dry.  I was so happy that the manager came out and informed me that they would take it off of my bill. Like I was going to pay for it when I only took one bite from it. I would not recommend this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen?start=40
Samuel P.,"Killeen, TX",0,22,,4.0,8/16/2014,Steak and lobster was pretty good.  Little pricey but good.  Boneless buffalo wings are great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen?start=40
Thomas K.,"DuPont, WA",4,64,21,2.0,5/30/2013,Ate alone to watch a basketball game. Sat at bar. Do not sit at the bar. Service was slow. Ordered an appetizer. Very dry and less than warm.

Shanitra M.,"Houston, TX",0,41,2,2.0,2/11/2014,"I used to really love TGI Fridays.. but we ate there last night and I was not impressed. Our server was nice,and friendly.. but the food wasn't good at all. The ranch that was given on the side for my fries was WATER and the fries and burger were not hot they were just barely warm. For all the money we paid for our meal, a hot meal would have been nice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen?start=40
Courtney R.,"Harker Heights, TX",1,8,,2.0,5/17/2014,"Customer service was decent in the beginning but as time progressed it got slower and slower. I have a small child so having to wait 20 minutes to get a check is a little agitating. I got the Parmesan crusted chicken, which was well below my expectations. The chicken was very dry and it seemed as though there was just a little Parmesan thrown on top. It comes with a mozzarella and tomato salad I believe and I just asked for a Caesar salad instead, I don't think they put Caesar dressing on it, if it was it was horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen?start=40
Chris P.,"Sugar Land, TX",0,2,,1.0,1/31/2015,"Won't let me give zero stars, so I gave it 1... And that's way too much. Worst service and meal ever. Good was over cooked, and cold. How do you even do that?! Seriously it took 20 min to get a beer. This place was not busy, either. No pride in this place, not from the servers or the management. Sad, this TGIFridays used to be decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen?start=40

Lisa B.,"Killeen, TX",4,6,,1.0,10/3/2014,Not impressed at all. My first time and it couldn't have been worse. The waitress was terrible. Me and my husband waited over 45 minutes for the three piece appetizer. Which in all honesty was absolutely terrible. Then another 45 minutes to an hour for our actual food. I had a salad he had the Jack Daniels burger. Overall we ate almost all of it in the first sitting due to how hungry we were waiting for the food that was ordered at the same time as our drinks. The restaurant was not very busy at all. There were at least 10 of the tables available on the side we were on yet they had a line out the door and no one cleaning any of the available tables. Overall worst experience at a restaurant ever. And I've been in restaurants with screaming children right next to me. Me and my husband will not be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-killeen?start=40
