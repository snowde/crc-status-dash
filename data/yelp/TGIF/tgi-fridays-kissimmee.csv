Kelly W.,"Fort Recovery, OH",3,14,,2.0,4/29/2017,"We normally love going to TGI Friday's, but had a horrible experience at this location. We stayed at Star Island Resort, which is right behind Friday's. After a long day at Magic Kingdom, we stopped here for food a couple beers. Our server Waylon was great. The review is strictly on the food. My dad ordered a steak cooked medium. He's never had a bad steak here and this was extremely over cooked and chewy. Waylon was quick to bring out a new one. This was cooked better, but still chewy. My mom ordered the bourbon chicken and it was very dry. Almost inedible. I had the Mediterranean Shrimp Naan and after a couple bites, realized it wasn't shrimp. It was Mahi Mahi. It was delicious, and I would have eaten anything after a long day at the park, but not what I ordered. Waylon was great and tried to accommodate us as best as possible. We were surprised the manager didn't come out and speak with us. We had many, many issues and it would have been nice to talk to him or her about the kitchen issues. We stay at Star Island a lot, and Fridays offers room service to the resort, but even the closeness and convenience will not lead us to get food from here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=20
Kristen R.,"Mount Vernon, NY",0,69,138,1.0,4/22/2017,"We walked in and were greeted and half the place was empty and we were told it was at least a 10 min wait because they had no menus ... now thats a first!!!! Anyways once we were seated things looked like they were gonna be ok - ordered drinks and were carded ( i laughed as im 34) ordered an app came out fast and was good no complaints - THEN we ordered food- well my husband got endless apps and must have had 3-4 rounds of them by himself and STILL my childs food never came out and my burger was nowhere to be found! Waitress comes and says she cant believe i havent gotten my food so im pissed off by now because my husbands done eating , my son is bitching because hes starving! And me im irate at this point and straight up said either you never put my order in OR they gave someone my food! This is a tourist town this is unacceptable- she says shes gonna tell the manager to come over- then comes back and tells me THE MANAGER SAID he was too BUSY to come over to us!!!! Unfreakin real! Then she says there's 4 orders ahead of us and im like HOW??? We got here WAY before half these ppl! I said forget it tell them i dont want the burger anymore- so then some guy comes running with the food and i told him send it back . My husband said nah give my son his food - fine- yeah well my hungry child starts bitching now that his burgers are cold fries were hot though and bun stale like a rock! Still the manager refused to come over! If you think comping me a $3.99 kids meal is gonna fix this youre sadly mistaken! I will be calling corporate! I will be reporting that manager and i will not be coming back to THIS location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=20

John J.,"Santa Cruz, CA",29,104,3,2.0,6/25/2016,"Food was ok. Had the ribs, Chilis is better since the meat was a bit tough. Small baby portion of coleslaw and 17 french fries on the plate. Overall, try Applebys or Chillis over this place if you are hungry.  Restaurant is pretty run down looking since who ever owns it does not update or upgrade worn or broken areas. Men's restroom is pretty filthy. Staff stood around a lot near the kitchen door and just chatted while watching people eat. Not impressive at all, Disney seems to bring in the customers so quality does not seem too important to whomever owns this store.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=20

Philip H.,"Davenport, FL",6,29,6,1.0,4/10/2016,I have to agree with past post.  This place is just horrible from the server megan to the cold food.   We waited a good 10 minutes to get drinks after being stared at by the server.  I finally get to order and am rushed because they say the kitchen is closing.  The irritating thing was we called ahead to find out what time the kitchen closes and got bad information.   This place seems to cater to the staff getting off shift and not the customers.   Avoid this place if at all possible.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=20

Samara K.,"Nashville, TN",0,18,1,3.0,1/9/2015,We choose this place for dinner on Christmas day as it was one of the only places open and we were in Kissimmee on vacation. We waited for about an hour which could be expected due to the day.   The food was hot and delicious except for my sister who asked for a medium well steak and it came out well done.  However she's pretty flexible and didn't mind too much.  The reason for my 3 stars is that my younger sister got food poisoning from what we assumed was the mac and cheese.  We came to disney for her so when she was too sick to head out to the parks the next day she was pretty bummed. Roxanne was our server and she was fabulous.  So all in all I would suggest this to someone if there wasn't many other options but make sure they stay away from the mac and cheese!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=20
Todd L.,"Sterling, VA",0,5,,1.0,1/18/2016,"I have to start by saying I was staying at the neighboring Wyndham resort. This Wyndham and the TGI Friday's works in conjunction to offer ""room service"" Thursday-Sunday. Because of this I understand that there is some difficulty in providing the best quality as possible.  To start, we were told that our order would be delivered within 30 minutes - the meal took more than an hour to arrive. Additionally, a steak that was requested medium well, was not just well done, but tough, chewy, and obviously shrunken from overcooking. The sauce of another entree was spilled all over the bag and the boxes of the other meals and only made us feel that our meal and our money was not taken seriously. Again, I understand the difficulties of being able to provide this service for Wyndham but I can't express my disappointment and displeasure for my meal that evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=20
Giphted O.,"Palma Ceia, Tampa Bay, FL",0,13,,2.0,6/6/2016,"Don't waste your money or your time. Food quality was low. Burger buns were stale not fresh.

They are renovating and the smell and dust is present in the dining area. Greeter wasn't cheerful or inviting but the server was. This place is to pricey for the level of value it lacks.

Laura G.,"Raleigh, NC",196,498,528,4.0,5/24/2014,"We came for dinner one night because I couldn't talk everyone in going out for Asian food. The good thing about Fridays is that it has a large variety of food. One friend had a pasta dish, I had a chicken sandwich with  whiskey BBQ sauce, that was to die for. Others had the chicken salad sandwich, all were served rather quickly. Oh I forgot to say we had the fried string beans for an appetizer. They were yummy and the sauce that they came with, I could have dipped anything into that sauce and been happy. Clean looking restaurant, great service, and delicious food at a very reasonable price.

We were quickly seated and our waiter took our order. We didn't wait long before our orders were at our table along with refills on our drinks. Our waiter was very attentive and kept our drinks topped off the entire meal, he also made some great suggestions on our food. From the tasty pasta, to the salads and burgers our entire meal was great. Our waiter was very courteous and attentive so we rewarded him appropriately. For a national chain, this place really delivered though I have to suggest they pay more attention to their bathrooms and entrance, they seem to need it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=20

It came with diced tomatoes, jalapeño & cheese. I'd go back just for the nachos.  I got Cajun chicken & shrimp pasta which honestly didn't taste like Cajun or look like it. My cousin got the same thing but his looked very different. It was extremely oily or buttery too. I honestly disliked it. The shrimp & chicken in it weren't seasoned well either.

I had a bad food experience in Tampa once, but considered that to be a one-time fluke. Not so.  I'll start by saying that the service was actually great. The restaurant was clean and everything ""looked"" fine.  But within an hour of leaving, the entire family is now getting sick all over our hotel room!  We shared an appetizer; 2 of us had steak-based entrees. My nephew tried to have a bacon cheeseburger, but the ""cheese-like product"" on it was so sour and congealed, we sent it back to exchange for chicken fingers.  I contacted the Manager on Duty in an attempt to have him maybe check in on the kitchen....you know, help save the night for others. Waste of time!

We got three all you can eat appetizers, which I recommend for anybody who's on a budget and wants to get there money's worth. The selection from the unlimited appetizers I would say is pretty vast.

Stephanie R.,"Long Beach, CA",2,5,,3.0,11/21/2016,"The ONLY reason I am giving this place any stars is due to a server named CHAD L. He has ought to be the nicest server I've come across in a long time! He was not our server, he was serving the table near us but was so friendly to all the kids, talked to them and helped them. Even came by our table to say hi to my daughter. He is also the only staff member who seems to move with a sense of urgency.  Now besides Chad, terrible service! We waited at least 10 minutes to even be greeted by our server. We ordered our drinks and appetizers. ANOTHER 10 MINUTES just to get our drinks. Mind you, it was not even busy in there. And almost all of us ordered water. So twenty minutes of sitting there, we could finally enjoy our drinks... About 5 minutes after our drinks come out, one of the appetizers we ordered finally hits the table. We thank our server and she walks away. We figured the other appetizer was coming out shortly. NOPE. 15  minutes later she comes out with our meals. We mention to her that we never got our ordered appetizer. She tries to tell us we only ordered one. pfft. After she checks her little book she then 'remembers' that we ordered another one. At that point we don't even want it anymore. Food was ok.

Decided to venture 5miles past my celebration Applebees (which is just okay)... I was craving TGIF and their apps; wanted something diff. As soon as we walked in door, we were hit with a distasteful odor. You know the smell... stale beer that got left behind while bartenders rush to get off duty... Dirty mop water floor... I looked at my friend as was like ""we made it this far"" and he nodded in agreement to sit at bar. So we did. Two gentlemen were behind bar. One white bald dude and one dreaded out black dude. Gotta give it to them, they were amicable but at the same time bothered. The white guy got elbow deep in cleaning his bar to close out while the black guy served everyone, including tables behind bar. We both ordered a draft beer which was great & COLD! Server had a great smile and was nice, accommodating the guy next to us, showing him a pic of his baby girl (a kitten). I knew Fridays had endless apps... when asked for specials, my server said, nope, and pointed to menu for options at hand. So I ordered spinach flat bread and skins. Food came fast, really fast, but it was not pipping hot. Later on, I noticed a pamphlet near register promoting endless apps... so I asked the White server, did they have endless apps (while his arms elbow deep in cleaning), he said yes, 24/7. Right then I thought, I NEW IT!  TGIF closes at 2am. At 12:15 the tvs were off. So, yea if your cool with hanging at stinky restaurant getting cold beer, no tv, slow service (beer took a while to refill and every refill he thought we were done and ready to go), so I felt pushed out and eventually we left.

The food was ready in about 15 minutes but was very disappointing. To start, the food was lukewarm at best and little effort was made to prepare it correctly. Those who ordered the Veggie burger had a quarter size amount of sauce on the burger which was not enough to mask the freezer burned taste of the burger itself. One member of our party didn't even get the top bun on her burger. We also received ranch instead of blue cheese, which may be a common mistake but the receipt clearly said blue cheese. I had to force myself to eat or else I would have gone to bed hungry.  The only somewhat good part of the experience was the person who greeted us was nice, but that is expected in any establishment.

Thomas C.,"Apex, NC",0,3,1,1.0,3/24/2013,"I'd give it zero stars if I could; it was a terrible restaurant experience, the worst I've had in years. I can't even narrow it down to one area; all areas were equally bad. First, we decided to eat at this TGIF because the parking lot was nearly empty of cars and it was 12:15 pm, prime time lunch hour for a Sunday afternoon. Our party of three walked into the restaurant and the first thing we noticed were people waiting to be seated with half the restaurant, to include the bar area, empty of customers: UNDERSTAFFED. When the hostess finally arrived to the front, she informed us it would be a 15-20 wait.  I looked around in amazement at the half-empty restaurant and asked her why the wait.  She answered the restaurant was suddenly rushed with customers and the wait staff couldn't handle the load. I told her TGIF had a YOU problem that was quickly turning into a ME problem. UNDERSTAFFED As I was in the waiting area, I noticed the hostess was also pulling double duty as a waitress as well as the bar manager, franchise owner and his wife. UNDERSTAFFED After the aforementioned 15-20 minute wait, we were finally taken to our table.  As I walked there, I noticed a strange thing; NO ONE was eating, they were all waiting for their food. UNDERSTAFFED The waitress took our order consisting of two of their 2 for $10 specials.  It took FOREVER to receive our appetizers and, of course, they were stone cold when they arrived. Much later, our entrees arrived, and you guessed it, they were also stone cold and cooked improperly.  My cheeseburger was cooked to death, dry and didn't look anything like the picture in the menu.   My wife's pasta dish was also cold and unappealing.  The waitress asked us if we wanted it fixed, but we told her we didn't have another hour to spend there. I won't be back there and I encourage others not to go until they solve their staffing problem.  I did find it ironic that when I was waiting in the beginning; an off duty wait staff person called the hostess and asked if they were on the schedule for today.  She replied, ""No, you're off today"" in which I told her ""You might want them to come in, it looks like you need all the help you can get"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=40
Bonnie S.,"Galloway, OH",1,4,1,1.0,4/12/2015,Terrible terrible service. Restaurant was very poorly managed. Long line to get in and at least three staff walked out while we waited. After finally getting a table we left after waiting 15 minutes for a server. Don't bother with this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=40
Jahaira L.,"Orlando, FL",1,24,,2.0,2/20/2016,This tgi fridays is definately not a good one. You will wait a while for your drinks and food for a while whether or not it is a holiday. They also make their martinis watery at this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=40
Bonita B.,"Tampa, FL",47,299,172,4.0,1/27/2013,"The customer service of the waitress, Jessica, was ideal. She was pleasant, responsive, and attentive. When my order arrived I noticed tomatoes garnishing and I informed Jessica that I was allergic and didn't know that this items had tomatoes. She apologized and picked up the plate to have the cooks/chef to re-do the meal without tomatoes. She asked if she could bring me something else in the interim since my husband's food was already delivered.  In times like these, I've seen some of the worst responses in the past. Jessica was a super star and handle this little challenge with ease. She was such a joy to have as a server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=40

My friend and I got the Jack Daniel's hamburger, which I would highly recommend.  I didn't get the bacon on it, but it still has a lot of yummy flavor that will satisfy your eager taste buds.  All other Jack Daniels items are also very tasty, too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=40

Lucy M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,4,2,5.0,10/23/2013,"Came to TGIF for an early dinner as hubby and I had a long trip and visit to Orlando VA. Boy was everything top notch, from the decor, super cleanliness, the host and the service. Usually, I end up getting disappointed after going to eat at food chains but what a nice surprise to have everything we ordered be so delicious! From the Spinach flat bread to mozzarella sticks, they had that pop in your mouth flavor that is rare to find... Not too strong or over powering and just right. Hubby ordered a lime tequila drink and seriously it was made to perfection. Haven't had a great drink since I lived in NY. Even on SoBe they water their drinks down.... Not here though... Hubby ordered petit steak and i ordered some chipotle bbq half rack ribs.... Makes me sound like a piggy but i.share... Lol. I'm a picky eater and this plate was heavenly.... The sauce was not too spicy n with just the right kick! We ordered that new special each $12.99 but since it was still early 3pm we got the lunch special special which came oug to $10. Bucks each... So you def can't go wrong with that! For sure we   back! I even told the host he would get five stars on Yelp.  :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=40
Keyfer M.,"Orlando, FL",0,1,,4.0,1/2/2012,"We recently ate Dinner at this Fridays after recieving enough Stripes points to qualify for a free full rack of ribs  (TIP: Stripes is TGIFridays loyalty card that anyone can get from the website).  (TIP: If you like eat out, then I highly suggest looking at any restaurants websites because many establishments will offer great deals to loyal customers.) We arrived on a busy friday night. It's located about five miles down from the the Old Towne amusement/tourist area, so some nights can get busy, especially the bar area.  (Tip: half off select appetizers during happy hours)  We wanted to take advantage of the ""half-off"" appetizers in the bar area during happy hours; but all booths were taken so grabbed a high top close to the bar. Service was prompt and friendly.  (TIP: when you sit in the bar you are most likely going to have a bartender wait on you. Many times this means faster and better service since a bartender doesn't have to wait for his drinks to be poured.) We shared a an order of the buffalo wings. they were good. Then we split a full rack of ribs, fries and slaw. Fries were not cooked to order (old and cold). Ribs were a little dry but Pour some of that Jack Daniels (mmm..good) sauce on it...and it's on!!!  Overall...enjoyed the food and service.  (TIP: theres a great waiting lounge with comfy couches and flat screen tv. Afterwards, walk off the big meal at free Old Towne after the meal. There is also a Krispy Kreme doughnut factory within a mile or two.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=40
Amy W.,"Orlando, FL",7,7,,5.0,3/24/2012,The was the best Fridays we have ever been to.  We sat by the bar to enjoy the games on tv. We had the best waitress/bartender.  She let us try drinks she was making and if we didn't not like them she made new ones.  The hostess was very nice.  The manager checked on our table twice. So the staff got a two thumbs up in our book. The atmosphere is always great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=40
Sherri T.,"Chicago, IL",152,186,65,3.0,6/6/2012,"I don't like chain restaurants. Really. I hardly ever go to them. In fact, I avoid them like the plague. My list of hated restaurants is made up almost entirely of chains. However when my husband and I visited Florida, we stopped at TGI Fridays because we had a coupon. Imagine my immense joy when I found Korean BBQ tacos on the menu! Let me just tell you a little bit about me. I love Korea. I love everything about Korea. Now, these tacos didn't taste like bulgogi or kalbi (Korean beef BBQ). However, they had a generic Asian taste that was actually fresh and delicious. I wouldn't run to a TGI Fridays and tell the world to try these Korean BBQ tacos. However in a pinch, I would recommend them. I hail TGI Fridays for offering even a pseudo Korean option. Fake Korean is better than no Korean! The service was awesome, and the beers were cheap. Thank you, TGI Fridays for adding Korean BBQ tacos to the menu!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=40

Kevin O.,"Chandler, AZ",37,37,4,3.0,3/15/2012,"Ate there on a Monday night and chose to sit in the bar area due to the 20 minute wait for a table.  Initial service was slow with the hostess having to come over and give us menus because the one bartender had her hands full.  Still took about another 10 minutes for her to take our drink order.  Just looked very busy (which is a good thing), but the bar area was understaffed (which is not a good thing).  The appetizers were 1/2 price, and the food was good, although they were out of the crab, so any of the crab stuffed fish dishes could not be made.  Overall it was OK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=40

Alex G.,"Casselberry, FL",0,4,,1.0,2/4/2015,"So we get to the restaurant at around 10:30 PM, they tell us that is going to be about 15 minutes to get us a table (the restaurant was empty there was only 3 other tables full, anyways we said ok and really did not mind it since where were waiting for one person any ways, we got our table like at 10:45, we sat down and the server what we wanted to drink we gave her the order and we got our drink like 15 minutes later, when she came she ask if we were ready and we told her that we needed about 5 minute for the last person in our group to arrive, about 3 minutes later the last person in the group arrives and we are ready to order. We wait for about 20 minutes later she finally came and got our food order. At this point all of the drink at the table need a refill, but she was rushing so she did not even realize it (an to be honest neither did we until she left.  About 5 minutes later another server see that our drinks are empty and he gets us all refill, 15 more minute go by and or cup are empty again and she is no where to be seen, the same guy come again and get us refill. About 15 minutes (about a 30 minutes after we order it) our food comes out. The flies are cold and the look like they had been sitting out for a while. (usually i would not complain i just eat my food and never come back, but since we waited for half an hour with an empty restaurant i though the least they could do was give us fresh fries, we complain and they brought out a side of fries that was half the serving that what the meal brings, i try to find the server to tell her but again she is nowhere to be found, at this point we ask to speak with the manager, he asked if we wanted a free dessert, (one for a table of 6, and i said actually will have one for each) they go us, the dessert about 30 minutes later (we were about to ask for the check when they finally came out.  The dessert was good, we got the check and left $0 for tips, and left. Just to give you some perspective we got there at 10:30 and left at 12:45, 30 minute were our fault but the rest was because of their slow service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-kissimmee?start=60
