Catherine H.,"Frankfort, IN",30,2,,5.0,1/10/2018,"I haven't been to TGI Friday's in years but when i heard they now have the vegan Beyond Meat burger, i had to go and try it! I'm so glad i did! It was amazing, and i know for sure I'll be going back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Melissa L.,"Seattle, WA",184,125,167,4.0,12/4/2017,"Great experience here! We were seated right away, our servicer was nice and checked in on us. The food was also pretty good. We wish the potato skins had a bit more toppings on them though :/ Nothing to really rave about but I appreciate the good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Jessica H.,"Lafayette, IN",3,32,97,4.0,8/28/2017,"I love the Endless Apps and most times this is why I choose to go to Friday's :-) The salads and burgers are good, as well as the chicken pasta dishes. I've never had anything here i didn't like!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Debbie B.,"Fort Wayne, IN",105,20,5,2.0,4/6/2017,"I guess you have to be a regular or not be a solitary woman to get decent service from Robin at the bar. From not acknowledging me, making me wait to order, smiling at everyone but me, being disgusted when I pointed out that my order was wrong, to ignoring the universal sign of an empty glass at the edge of the bar - this was a less than stellar experience. The GM did come to ask on food preparation before serving my second entree and did ask about the conversation I attempted to have to clear the air with the server - I appreciate that. I travel for business, I count on TGIF to be a reliable chain experience when local pickings are slim - I will take this location off my list. Addition: Apparently, the bartender decided (or was told) to cease interaction with me. The GM cashed me out. She did receive the standard tip, including the tip on a comped drink, but only because I once walked in her shoes. I hope I did it better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Christina S.,"West Lafayette, IN",17,26,2,2.0,3/31/2017,"Not good tonight. There were seven of us and we got there before the crowd on a Friday night. Most of our dishes were cold and the waitress didn't check in with us after we got our food.  Sadly, this is what we expect to get from a chain restaurant anymore....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Alyssa C.,"Fort Wayne, IN",28,95,74,4.0,6/24/2016,"They say us in a corner and didn't tell the waiter they had been seated so no one came to our table for over ten mins until I started looking around at the other waiter walking back and forth by us. I don't know if our wait was new or what but he didn't know what salad dressing they have, he didn't give us straws with our drinks (had to ask). I mean nothing major but a ton of small things add up... He was nice and we told him we were crunched on time and he did take care of us quickly. It was kind of annoying to be put in the back corner of the restaurant at a table when plenty of booths were open but I understand being a waitress before that they have sections but they should be splitting up the booths better then... Good food and clean place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Madeline V.,"Hamburg, NY",2,5,9,5.0,8/18/2015,The gluten free food was extremely tasty! All the food was prepared perfect. I had a freshly made lemonade that was great! Our server was also excellent and very friendly! Can't wait to come back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Angela S.,"Chicago, IL",45,46,29,2.0,5/31/2016,"Sat at the bar twice with coworkers, different weeks, different days. Service was slow, but the server was friendly. Probably won't be sitting in the bar section again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Brandon K.,"Schaumburg, IL",57,16,,4.0,2/2/2016,Good service. Fun staff. What you'd expect from tgi Fridays. Food is always good and the jack Daniels sauce is the best.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Barry M.,"Crawfordsville, IN",9,128,45,3.0,7/14/2014,I like TGIF. The quality of the food is consistent.  Try fried green beans for app,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Donna S.,"West Lafayette, IN",0,14,4,2.0,10/19/2015,"We went there on a Saturday, it was not busy but it took over an hour to get our food and one of the entrees was wrong.  We had to ask for a condiment several times before we finally got it.  It was not a good experience but the manager did take the messed up entree off of the bill and made a new one.  He offered a dessert as well so he tried to make it right but when you are with a child, that was too much time to wait. I will go back but I hope they are staffed better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Rick W.,"Lafayette, IN",0,2,,4.0,5/15/2016,Eat at Fridays' weekly and love it.  Sit in bar and service is super.  Food is good and price is reasonable.  Cute girl working bar makes it fun!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Gabrielle C.,"Carmel, IN",25,40,1,3.0,1/31/2015,"For date night, we were seated within 20 minutes during Friday dinner rush. The staff was friendly and nice. However, the waitress despite her kindness didn't check on us a lot. I was really excited for the loaded potato skins, but I felt they were lacking. They weren't super cheesy and not a while lot of bacon, which was disappointing. However, our main course was perfect. We had the California Club, definitely recommend, and the champagne was good for an American food chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Kent M.,"Kearney, NE",56,1936,261,4.0,7/23/2012,"3 of our group here for lunch today. One had a chicken pizza (was nice crust and just ok remaining parts), one a chicken sandwich which looked very good. I had a rueben triple deck and it was great. We sat in bar area and had very good service for all our needs. Thanks folks. Well done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Tom M.,"Lafayette, IN",76,256,12,1.0,6/4/2012,"Went here on a Sunday night after a HS graduation. We had a large party (14) and had to wait a normal amount of time to be seated. But after that everything went downhill. We had to wait too long to get our drinks. They ran out of dip and the pasta for the chicken Parmesan. Substitutions were made and bill adjustments were applied to the bill. My hamburger and my daughter's chicken were overcooked and dry. The waitress seemed overwhelmed by it all. She offered  to substitute corn on the cob for the missing pasta, then made a decision to give another diner a double serving of mashed potatoes in place of the pasta without asking. We spent a total of three hours from entering to leaving. We all agreed we will never return. However, the desserts were very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Juan A.,"Lansing, MI",65,298,134,4.0,10/26/2012,"I usually don't like chain restaurants but TGIF is one of my exceptions. The service was good, the food was good, and the price even though is not cheap it wasn't bad at all. The appetizers were really good and my Grilled Salmon with Langostino Lobster was really good!!  The best part of TGIF has to be the drinks: strong, quality of liquor, and decent price....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Ng T.,"West Lafayette, IN",2,15,,4.0,1/14/2011,"They have this awesome lunch deal: unlimited breadstick, soup, salad, + drink for $6.99. (or $8.99 after 4pm M-F, and all day Sat & Sun) They deep-fried the breadstick, which makes it very tasty and unique. I always get French Onion Soup and it's tasty. Salad is always fresh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Robert R.,"Coloma, MI",49,52,125,4.0,2/24/2011,"Nice place address is off 110 south Creasy lane. Nice people stopped by one way home from Lexington, KY to home Michigan. Wife said the chicken and pecan salad was awesome.  My salad was yummy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Nicole W.,"Louisville, KY",91,167,134,3.0,3/29/2009,"New construction TGI Fridays. Clean, typical TGI Fridays.  The best part was the bar. We started off having a drink there and getting an appetizer. 4 flat screen TVs were going with a variety of news and sports. Bar stools were large and comfortable.  Ok part: the hostess was very confused and frustrated when we used our TGI Friday ""Get more stripes"" frequent eater coupon to ""jump the line"" and get a table right away. Not the reaction we hoped for.  Friday's tip: join their ""Get more stripes"" club at  . they will send you great coupons. We ate for about $15 and had a large beer, app, 2 entrees, and 2 sweet teas. Great value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Bodie S.,"Indianapolis, IN",72,365,79,4.0,11/22/2011,"I had a really great lunch at this restaurant. A few friends and I decided to go and eat here on a Sunday afternoon. The service was great and fast. I ordered the three course meal for $13, which is a fantastic value. I also ordered a draft Guinness and it was delicious. Although it was a little expensive for a pint of beer, around $5, but that's probably about average for sit-down restaurants. I got the fried mozzarella for my appetizer, the burger/fries for my main meal, and the peanut butter chocolate pie for dessert. It was all without complaint. My friends got the flounder and a Jack Daniel's burger, both also getting mojitos. They also didn't have any complaints with their meals. You can't beat the three course meal option. There are plenty of choices to pick from and I can also guarantee that you will be fully satisfied afterwards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette
Kay O.,"San Francisco, CA",9,55,,5.0,12/8/2010,"My experience at TGI has always been stellar. The wait staff is great; I even had my waiter run out after me with my boxed dinner because I forgot it inside - I almost gave him ANOTHER tip on top of the hearty one I had already given him. Service was quick, efficient, our orders were all correct. I love coming here and picking up Stripes points and using coupons. =D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette?start=20
Tamara M.,"Lafayette, IN",0,3,2,1.0,2/6/2013,"Our food was absolutely awful.  My husband and I both got burgers, he got the jack daniels burger and I tried their new jalapeno with beer cheese burger.  First the waitress said all their burgers are cooked medium well which was ok with both of us.  Both our burgers were so well done even black on outside and tasted like a frozen block placed on a bun.  Absolutely terrible!!  My husband asked for a cup of the beer cheese to dip his fries in and the waitress told us it would be 0.99, when our bill came it was 2.99.  I found what we both agreed looked like a stem in the breaded jalapenos placed on my burger and I literally had 2 breaded jalapenos on my burger along with so little beer cheese, it left us both looking for it.  Overall I wouldn't even go as far as giving it a one star.  Totally left us disappointed we had to pay for such awful food only finding us swinging through McDonald's to fulfill our appetite. Our waitress was hurried and never asked if everything was alright.   Again, this place was a joke, don't waste your money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lafayette?start=20
