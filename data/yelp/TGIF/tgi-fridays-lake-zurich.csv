John S.,"Lake Zurich, IL",0,3,,4.0,8/26/2017,"We enjoy the food, atmosphere, and beverages at Friday's. When we visited the Lake Zurich Illinois Friday's on August 25, 2017, we ordered the pot sticker appetizer. The presentation was recently changed from serving cole slaw with the pot stickers to just plain onions. Also, $5.00 martinis have been taken off the special drink menu. Would someone please explain why this was done? Also, why were these changes made? We suggest that these changes be reversed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-zurich
Melissa S.,"Melrose Park, IL",10,74,113,2.0,1/6/2017,"So it seems TGIF is focused more on presentation than how the food actually tastes, and how accessible the food is to eat.  My fiancé and I came here, because we had received a gift card for Christmas, and decided to go have lunch. The place was essentially empty, and the servers and staff looked dismal and bored. We were seated promptly, and then waited...and waited for our server to come greet us. We pondered over the menu while she went off and made our drinks, and by the time she came back (10 minutes), we were ready to order. We ordered the chicken nacho appetizer, my fiancé ordered the American Burger, and I ordered the Mahi Mahi on Naan bread. The nachos came, but instead of chips there were halved tostada rounds, so they looked pretty, but eating them was a hot mess. Yes, I know nachos are messy, but they are a controlled mess. Trying to hold half a tostada while putting salsa and guacamole on it just made things messy. Also, the chicken was cubed, and there was not a whole lot of it on the nachos. It was mostly cream, beans, and cilantro.  After the Fiasco Nachos, we then had our lunches served to us by a boy who seemed to be laughing at our orders (Why? I have no idea). My fiancé said his burger was okay, but nothing special. My Mahi Mahi sandwich, again, looked pretty, but was essentially inaccessible as a sandwich. The Naan bread was too short to hold the sandwich, so everything fell apart, and there were maybe two ice cubed sized pieces of fish in there. The rest of the sandwich consisted of leaves, sauce, and Naan. I ended up just spreading everything out and using my for to eat.  Our server only came over once to ask about everything, and she saw our empty glasses, asked is for a refill (we said yes), and left to get our new drinks, but she left our old glasses, and never took them. Even when she returned, she left our glasses. It made our table crowded.  As I said earlier, T.G.I.F is focused on making things pretty, and not necessarily tasty or easy to eat. At least we had a gift card, so we didn't blow 45 bucks on a worthless meal...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-zurich
Jane F.,"McHenry, IL",0,13,,3.0,11/25/2017,Had a turkey burger there today and it was very poor quality meat with a nasty flavor.

Aaron W.,"Grayslake, IL",0,2,1,1.0,11/11/2017,"Went to this TGI Friday's with my wife for dinner and unfortunately this was possibly one of the worst experiences we have had dining out. I generally do not write reviews often however this is an exception. When sitting down it was apparently not communicated that we were in anyone's section so we sat there for 10 mins with no communication. This could be understandable if it was very packed however there were only about 4-5 parties there. Immediately we noticed a few fruit flies flying around and finally I had managed to swat one. We finally ordered and received our food. My wife had ordered a steak done medium and once cutting it open it was almost completely RAW and look like they had it on the grill for no more than a minute. I had ordered the ribs and when they came they didn't even have BBQ sauce on them. These are very basic tasks that any ""chef"" should be able to handle. Once we got the steak back we continued with the meal and this is when we were then bombarded with fruit flies. At one point there were 3 on my wife's plate at once and a few other flying around it. In addition when my drink was brought to me there was one floating in the drink which I fished out. This was absolutely disgusting and we said we were done. Although this was gross I calmly asked to speak the the manager and I walked him away from the eating area so that the other tables wouldn't hear and I explained the fly issue. The manager did not seem shocked at all nor did he apologize for the situation. Instead he had said it was a problem they have been trying to fix. This was very surprising and quite frankly shocking. We do not plan on returning to this location if any in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-zurich
Karyn S.,"Barrington, IL",26,146,12,4.0,5/22/2016,"Service here seems to either be great, or terrible. Back in September, our server Jeremy was amazing. This past week, our server (Tyler, I think) was TERRIBLE. Several tables ended up actually placing orders with someone else because our actual server wasn't around.

Just dropped in for lunch and had the 2 Jack Sliders, the new sushi appetizer and a mojito. The sliders were awesome! The sushi was ok. I didnt like that it didnt have soy offered with it and it was only a deep fried rice only roll topped with guac and 1 medium sized shrimp. The mojito was decent but nothing to write home about.

Melissa G.,"Lake Zurich, IL",7,75,31,1.0,1/15/2017,"Scary disgusting experience at Friday's this past Thursday.   My mom and I met at Fridays to grab a quick dinner before I had to be somewhere that evening.    I was disappointed not to find a healthy section on the menu.  When the waitress came by (in an overwhelming cloud of perfume) I asked if there was a healthy menu somewhere I could get a chicken breast and veggies.  She told us she was new and didn't know but would go ask someone else.   Meanwhile as the air at our table cleared I found something to order.  So when she (and her perfume) came back, we were ready to order.  I ordered a chicken sandwich with a side Caesar salad with a glass of water, and my mom ordered a shrimp pasta with a cup of coffee.    Not a huge problem, but the coffee was served on a bread plate rather than one of those small plates that usually comes with a coffee cup.   Again, strange, but not a big deal.   Then the food came.  My sandwich was fine.   But instead of a shrimp pasta, my mom was served a chicken pasta.  She mentioned it to the waitress, who said ""oh,that's not what I heard"".   She did offer to replace it, but since we were short on time my mom said to not worry about it.   She isn't much of a complainer.    We were enjoying our food when all of a sudden my mom had a horribly panicked look on her face after taking a bite.  Then she proceeded to pull a long string of metal out of her mouth that had been in her pasta!!!   Obviously she had no interest in finishing her meal.    I called over a manager so that they could be made aware of the issue.  The manager informed us that the metal was probably from the sos type pads they use to scrub the pans at night.  Um, gross!  At this point I want to vomit, I can't imagine having had that in my mouth!  The manager offers a new plate, a different entree something to go, dessert.  But the meal was already ruined.   I mentioned to him that this wasn't even the dish that she ordered to begin with.  So it sort of adds insult to injury to be served something you didn't want but are willing to settle for...and then end up with a piece of metal from a scrub brush in your mouth.   This could have been a catastrophic mistake on their part!  What if she had swallowed that?  Or it had scratched her mouth and caused infection? There is no way that I could ever recommend TGI Fridays after this incident.   How could you ever be sure that you won't get extras mixed into your food that are not edible?   Bad play Fridays.   I hope for your sake this never happens to anyone else in your restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-zurich

Kristina H.,"Carpentersville, IL",31,6,4,2.0,8/11/2017,"TGIF is a pIace to hangout have dinner and chill. Earlier this evening I meet up with my friends to celebrate my friends birthday. I had gotten there after them. I wasn't sure who our waitress was and she didn't introduce her self to me when I got there or when she took our orders. I only knew her name by looking at her name badge while she took our order. She was younger and what not. She took our orders and explained to us that the prices for the unlimited appetizers went up and the portions are smaller. She said you order the first one and think about what you want for your next one. She brought my drink because my friends already had theirs and then left. A few minutes went by and she brought what we ordered to the table and took or next appetizer choice. 15-20 went by. She walked past our table like 5 times not asking us if we need refills, telling us what is going on with our order, not engaging with us nothing. We all needed refills and more food. I was aggravated at this point. I saw the waiter for the table next to us like 6 times wishing he was helping us. I don't appreciate being ignored and under valued when I am spending my hard earned money. I hope that in the future they will train better and help out where needed. Maybe if she was not taking care of all her tables, either she gets help from other associates or a manager or she only gets one table to focus on. There was also a screaming kid so that was crap to. I am not a waitress but you better believe that if I was that I would be running around table to table busting my butt and giving great customer service. I value peoples time and them taking time out of their evening to let me make their night even better. I hope that next time I come in I have a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-zurich

Mark O.,"Cary, IL",0,3,,1.0,3/12/2017,"I would like thank all the staff at the lake Zurich location,  we went to go there on Saturday afternoon 2:30 ( not a busy time) we stood at the door for few moments, then the phone rang, manager ran up to get the phone, and stood there talking for a few more minutes. Started to get a little irritated at this point, then another couple came walking through the door, and a hostess came around the corner, grabbed two menus and told them to follow her. At this point we are getting a little pissed. So we decide to tell her we'll just seat ourselves, she does bring us menus.  After a few more moments the bartender finally comes over to take our drink order. After we watch him serve nearly everyone in the bar, he brings our drinks to us, as he is walking bye he slams the drinks down on the table and keeps going.        And this is why I would like to thank the staff, because at this point we decided to get up and leave.

Tonight was no exception.  If I wanted frozen chicken breasts and boxed mashed potatoes cooked for my dinner...I would buy it at the supermarket for $10.  Not spend over $50 for just my husband and I to have exactly that with a special sauce (jack Daniel's chicken).   And let's not forget poor service with the waiters not taken your order for 15 min after you sit....where then you fall behind the other 5 tables that sat behind you.  To finally get your order in...being told any promos have to be applied later as to ""not forget"".  To never check on you or refill drinks through the meal.  To finally getting your bill quickly left at your table....never to return for 20 more min.  Never applying the discount even with the promo coupon on the table through the entire meal to the end....""not to forget??""   Ummm I think you forgot - Harris (Sorry Harris...your $10 tip opportunity shrunk to $3...and please note... you were lucky to get a tip).  To finally coming to see us, and telling us...no problem...no rush.   A yeah...im now in a rush....WTF??   Yeah...needless to say the food is no longer worth it and neither is the service.   Common TGI....get your act together.....we don't all just go there to drink on Friday.    It really sucks to have to write such a poor review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-zurich?start=20

As we came in (we sat at the bar) there were already 5 tables messy and dirty after people left. To make a long story short, when we left those tables looked the same. To make it even worse: the manager walked into the bar area more than once, but he didn't do anything. Obviously, he didn't even notice. A good thing is the beer on tap. Good selection. We ordered the Beer-Burger and it was pretty good. However,this is US. You can have a good burger at almost every corner so basically a decent burger is nothing to point out.  I ordered a Chicken-Peanut Salad and it was very disappointing. The Chicken wasn't crispy nor warm. Makes me ask myself who the hell is working in this kitchen and not able to warm something up in a freaking microwave??! On top of it very dry. It obviously was thrown in a Microwave and that's how it tasted. The Manager stopped by to ask if we like the food and I said no and that I expected it different and so on. He was very nice, tried to please me with a dessert. Gave me a coupon for another visit for a free dessert. Very nice move, which made me give the place one star more.... But that is about it.

Kaitlyn S.,"Lake Villa, IL",0,1,,1.0,1/15/2015,"I'd give it 0 stars if I could. My girlfriend's and I usually go to the Friday's in Gurnee, IL, when we just want some good food, a good drink and a place that isn't too loud/packed  and always have amazing service. I have a girlfriend who was coming from Villa Park, IL (whom I haven't seen in about 4-5 years) so we both thought of the Fridays in Lake Zurich. To be honest, I'd probably rather have eaten at a McDonald's. Now I'm in the ""customer service"" industry and I'm not one to ever complain while at a restaurant, retail store, etc. I know how rude people can instantly ruin my shift and I refuse to be one of those people. However, my experience at this Friday's location, there was no biting my tounge. Where do I begin? For starters, our waitress had no clue about anything on the menu and she was 18, so she had no clue about the drink menu. I get it, she's 18, but than there should've been a waiter who knew more that could've helped her out.  One of my girlfriend's never even ended up receiving the drink she had originally asked for. Secondly, we finally place our food order (45 mins later.....) we find out they don't have the lobster my friend ordered. This is being told to us 45 mins after placing our order. She didn't even ask if she wanted to order something else. Our food finally arrives, and my girlfriend who ordered the salmon-/lobster dinner literally gets a small piece of fish, a scoop of mashed potatoes, and a broccoli stem that takes up half the plate. If you didn't have the lobster than you could have at least doubled on the fish. Third, another girlfriend of mine bites into her food to find wads of hair. Finally we asked for a manager, the girl tells us she told him and he would be over shortly. Tisk tisk... 30 mins later we had to physically get up to find him. Come to find out, the waitress never even told him we wanted to speak to him. During all of this, I felt like I was in highschool with how the waitresses were huddled in a corner not even doing their job, just giggling and whispering. So instead of visiting with my girlfriends and catching up with one whom I haven't seen in years, the evening was spent otherwise.

Jun K.,"Roselle, IL",40,111,62,4.0,3/28/2013,"I really enjoy the Fridays restaurants.  This one was no exception.  Take advantage of their ""2 for"" deals and get anything bathed in Jack Daniels sauce.  If I could I would probably bathe in it myself.  Got the JD burger which was part of the 2 for $10 so i pretty much got a free appetizer.  Postickers for sure.  It was four of us and our waiter seemed to be the bartender as well.  It was closer to 11pm, luckily they close at 2am, i think they have new later hours now.  Works for me since I get out from work late.  Anyways, left feeling satisfied and full.  Two most important things when leaving a restaurant.  Will be back soon",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-zurich?start=20
Juliana R.,"Chicago, IL",67,352,35,5.0,4/19/2011,"Their Parmesan crusted chicken with stuffed tortellini is to die for! It doesn't even taste like you're eating at Fridays, whatever that means haha! But I always eat here with family in the suburbs, and our server Kelly was really sweet! She was super patient with all my little cousins running around everywhere!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-zurich?start=20

Emily G.,"Hawthorn Woods, IL",1,37,40,1.0,7/4/2013,"Went with my guests from UK. The Barmen asked for I'd, my guest showed a UK driver license, he is 23 years old,they refused to serve him and told he can not sit at the bar,without proper US Government I'd. The barmen then asked for a UK passport. ( is UK passport proper US Government id? ) State driver license is not US government id either.If you have out of state license you need a passport to confirm I'd on this basis. I am just wondering who goes to the bar on July 4 at 10.30 pm with a passport? I am 48, my husband 64 the kids was 21 and 23, they refused to serve us at TGI Fridays and told us we can not sit at the bar. We and our relatives from UK travel a lot, always showed our USA and UK driver licenses as I'd,no one country ever refused us service and told us where we can sit or where we can not sit at restaurant . I am just wondering how TGI Fridays will explain this to us. If you look young take your passport or you will not get served at TGI Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-zurich?start=40

Gia S.,"Lake Zurich, IL",0,52,1,4.0,5/7/2013,"Food is usually consistently good, wait staff are friendly but very young and inexperienced at times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-zurich?start=40
Bob S.,"Wauconda, IL",0,12,,5.0,11/18/2013,"This one is GREAT! Not sure about other Friday's, but this is more like a family owned business (I'm not talking Greek family places either, I'm talking about the  better places in an area). It is freindly and the food is GREAT! (high quality, served fresh & hot, huge menu). Top notch apps. The bar area is cool too, and you can eat there. The food here is nearly equal to the high end chains (Cooper Hawk, Maggiano's, Wildfire) , far far above the other chains (Applebees, Chilis, Red Lobster, Olive Garden) that have plain bland production food. Just like Lettuce-Entertain-you they have you fooled that you are in a chef owned place with great food & service. And the prices are more than reasoanble.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lake-zurich?start=40
