Steve B.,"Lakeland, FL",56,14,12,3.0,3/26/2013,"Some of the Food was excellent, but my chicken was really over cooked and I should have sent it back? However the appetizers were off the charts and filling so I wasn't that hungry. Not sure why the bar runs different drinks prices (cheaper) than when you sit down? They often run promotions and coupons that you can get on your phone - so well worth searching for them on your smart phone while you wait for a table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lakeland
Nolan R.,"Tampa, FL",110,295,94,3.0,10/3/2011,"This TGI Friday's does what's it's good at and that's a good thing.  There was a 30 min wait, but not wait for the high top tables in the bar. We sauntered up the stairs past the moon man and grabbed a table. Our waiter was very quick an attentive. He even let us use a coupon from our phone - which we weren't expecting. He got a significantly larger tip because of this. I had the Salmon and it was good. I wasn't expecting much and it exceeded my expectations. Also the rice that came with the entree was very good. I'd go back and probably will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-lakeland
