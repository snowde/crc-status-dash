Alyssa C.,"Levittown, NY",80,3,,1.0,10/13/2017,"Where to begin...we were told we were getting a high top in the bar. We got a low top next to a door. The door was clearly labeled ""Please use front door"" yet drunks were going in and out. Management said nothing as we got an unrelenting breeze. Food portions were extremely small. My husbands margarita had no alcohol and was full of ice. When he asked for a second it was forgotten. However, the kicker was the baby with the drunk parents sitting at the bar. This was quite possibly the worst dining experience I've had in a while and we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=20

Lauren K.,"New York, NY",8,173,95,1.0,6/4/2017,So bad. The food and drinks took so long. My dish was wrong. Low quality. I know it's a chain but come on. I won't go to any Fridays ever again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=20
Ronit M.,"Jericho, NY",77,164,319,4.0,3/2/2016,"The first time I went there I was angry and not health conscientious. The food was good and the staff is friendly.  The second time I went there, I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to find anything to meet my health needs. As it turned out, they have updated their menu and they do have some satisfying healthy options. I had the bourbon grilled mahi mahi with my choice of two sides: broccoli and mozz-tom salad. I'd definitely go back and try some of their other healthy eats too.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the water service is bad. And the fact that our waitress visits us like she's on a moving train without stops. It was hard to get a hold of her and request additional items as desired. For her it was as if her boss told her go onto the next one as soon as she reached the table she was aiming for, and then again when she got to that one, etc. Also our table wasn't entirely clean when we sat down. I had to brush off someone else's leftovers prior to sitting.  Other than that, happy (un)healthy eats!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=20

Kenny Y.,"Hicksville, NY",106,185,129,1.0,1/19/2016,"After getting spam with their latest promo of 4-7-4 appetizer, entree, and dessert.   I expected $4 appetizers, $7 entrees, and $4 desserts.  Nope nothing was too good to be true.  First, my experiencing wasn't great besides the deceitful advertising.  We got in and I can see there is a line forming on a Friday evening.  I was told a 30 minute wait. So, I went to the bar trying to get a drink before my table was ready.   Waiting to get the bartender's attention and lost count of the minutes waiting..I get a call from my wife my table was ready.  I got to the table she already got her Ice Tea before I even got my beer.  That is a problem.  The bar was either under staff or slow as snails.   Finally, I got to my table and saw what was offered on the 474 menu.  I was like this is going to suck.  They had maybe 1 or 2 of the items at the price and the rest were  at higher prices.  One would expect at higher price you would get a little more food.  I didn't know the 474 menu was a extension of the kids menu and it felt like it when my wings and pasta came out.  I left hungry and vow never to return for another several years ( the last time I visited TGIF).   The memory was so bad it was like a bad trip that keeps on going.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=20
Faatimah S.,"Huntington Station, NY",0,5,3,1.0,11/18/2017,"I went to this restaurant on the evening of November 17th and received the WORST SERVICE EVER ! The waiting area only have three women- waiting for a table, and it didn't seem busy. My  date had asked the hostess, to see the bar area- and it was crowded. So then ,he asked if we could be seated at a booth. The blonde hostess asked for his name, and told him -the wait time is 10 minutes. So we sat down , and waited to be called. We noticed that people were entering the restaurant , checked in with the hostess and was seated within two- three minutes. After ten minutes were up , I checked back with the hostess to see if there was a booth table available. She said , 10 minutes. So I waited. More people came in and was seated - right away. I check back in , and the hostess asks for my name. I gave my dates name , and she never typed it into the tablet. So annoyed with the incompetent Hostess - we left and  went to Miller Ale's. The good and atmosphere there was 100 times better ! The Miller Ale's House Hostess greeted us , and the Staff was very welcoming !

Staci S.,"Wantagh, NY",473,113,313,3.0,1/13/2015,"We were a party of 9 on a weekend night so I understand the 45 min wait. The initial waitress was really nice but definitely could not handle the workload without lots of help. It took a while for us to get our drinks and order extra appetizers and even refills on water. We had to always search and ask for things. They needed more help or more multitasking. Some of the dishes and drinks came out wrong. For example, I wanted broccoli instead of potatoes and the server said he would bring them out. They never came until I told the waitress they never came. They also didn't mention the Fridays want more stripes card at any of the Fridays I've been eating at! Our bill was over $600 and they should have payed extra attention to us. Just because a restaurant is busy should not mean bad service and long waits.  Fridays should be aware and equipped for that!

Nick D.,"Jericho, NY",0,13,34,3.0,8/6/2017,We went for the new endless apps deal. In the old promotion they gave you full size apps. This time they are only half size. They also use the same ingredients in many so they basically taste the same. For example the quesadilla shows 4 pieces in the picture but you only get 2. The flat bread Pizza tastes practically the same with that shredded barbecue chicken and similar crust. So you get half orders and they take 20 minutes to come out. You waste a lot of time and the food was just acceptable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=20

Are you freaken serious??? I came here with my husband for a night to relax being that we are workaholics and I regret it. Keep in mind we are African American in a predominantly white area/restaurant .  We sat at the bar and the bartender was practically non existent. We practically had to ask for a menu. And secondly, he wasn't attentive whatsoever! We had to yell across from where we are sitting and sometimes even flag for a couple minutes just to get him. What kind of BULLSHIT is that?!!!???!! Then he had the nerve to have us waiting 15 minutes for a dam fork to eat. He never checked up on us to see if we need anything else. What a fucken ASSHOLE!!!! He paid attention to the groups of Caucasians that were there and not us. Treated us like dogs. Ok I get it, you may not like ""our kind"" but you're working with the public so why apply to this job?

Janet M.,"Bethpage, NY",8,23,,3.0,8/24/2016,"While TGI Fridays has fallen from grace over the past years there are still some treasures to be found on their menu. First and foremost are the pan seared pot stickers. Chewy like bubble gum on the outside and pork product flavoring inside make for quite a pair when dipped in szechwan sauce. This trio delivers an abundance of flavor. Hibachi Skewers are another favorite of mine. So much flavor happening at once with the ginger lime slaw interacting with the garlic and black pepper soy sauce. While I think the Jack Daniels line is very hip and trendy, I see it nothing more than a gimmick. I also think the shrimp are frozen, but that's just my opinion. There are specials for drinks if that helps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=20

He asked for his burger medium rare but how can u cook a burger to that if its so thin?  He wenT home with hungry stomach. Good thing i had brought home a chicken roll earlier that day.

Ashley M.,"Seaford, NY",104,4,,1.0,12/4/2016,"For starters I would like to say that our waitress, Maelinda, was a delight. The evening started off very well and we ordered our drinks and appetizers came out accordingly. I was with 3 other people. 3/4 of us got burgers and the 1/4 got a steak. The 3 of us who ordered the burgers got them and began eating. Before we knew it we were all done with our meal and the steak never came out. Maelinda asked how everything was and my boyfriend had explained that he never received his meal. She was sincerely apologetic and handled the situation by telling a manager. Usually a manager is supposed to apologize for any mistakes that has been made. Nope, not this branches manager. She BLAMED my boyfriend for not alerting anyone that he didn't receive his meal. He kindly told her that no one came by nor stayed long enough for him to get their attention. She then told him he should've told a hostess.

The last time my son and I got them, they were the thin, pre-made, frozen kind. Not good at all. My son used to get a decent Jack Daniels chicken and shrimp, but the last time it was disgusting.

June D.,"Levittown, NY",0,2,3,1.0,1/6/2017,"So disappointed tonight. Yes its Fridays, I'm not looking for tablecloth dining, a late night snack with my teenager after a long day for the both of us.  Seated in a few minutes, great! order drinks and apps, one of the apps were cold, but we couldn't find the server, or any one to call attention to this. no one followed up when the drinks and apps were served. Had to get up and walk to the front of house. second course delivered, I guess now the server was annoyed, as she dropped the entrees and never asked if we needed anything...hello, we need silver ware, none on the table, we don't usually eat with our hands. empty glasses, and no question if we would like another drink or anything else to drink. we called over another employee and pointed out that the first glass was dirty, for which he apologized for. We also had to ask this other employee for silver ware to eat with, and also for another drink. Second drink came, and the glass had lipstick marks all over it. I am sorry 2 glasses both dirty. no follow up by server. I'm done. when we asked for the check, we got just that, the check. all dishes left sitting on the table. Do we know what bussing means?

Steve D.,"Tampa, FL",3,17,1,1.0,3/12/2016,"Dear Mr. or Mrs. Fridays, I hope this message finds you well. My name is Steve and I have been a long-time patron of your Levittown, NY location. And when I say ""long-time"" I'm not referring to the number of years since my first visit to your restaurant, but rather the amount of time I have spent recently in this establishment.  I'm no stranger to TGI Fridays. I grew up in suburban Long Island, in the shadow of your original 63rd street and 1st Ave Manhattan location. Although my local Friday's was always your illustrious Westbury restaurant, I'm happy to say that I have sampled many of your locations throughout the continental United States and abroad. I've been to Friday's as diverse as the Fort Lauderdale Airport, all the way to the TGI Friday's Dundrum, at the Dundrum shopping center in Dublin, Ireland. Clearly, I'm no stranger to your delightfully tasty microwaved food, middle-of-the-road service, or moderately priced alcohol.  However, it has recently come to my attention that your Levittown, NY location is not living up to the run-of-the-mill standards Friday's has become tolerated for. In fact, if I may say so, every experience I have had at this location has been poor to unbearable. Allow me to explain. Although I would never actively go out of my way to visit any of your restaurants, your Levittown location happens to be situated within walking distance of one of the finest movie theaters I have ever visited. The AMC Levittown not only features reclining seats, but also offers pre-assigned seating. Why is this important you ask? Because simply, I no longer have to worry about getting to the movies early in order to secure a seat. But what has this got to do with Friday's? In a word, everything. By giving me extra time to arrive at the theater, AMC Levittown has opened for me what I like to call the ""buzzed window"". This is the brief amount of time I have to consume enough alcohol to make the first two-acts of any movie bearable. Realistically speaking, this buzz can only last two acts, as by act three I will likely be sober and annoyed, or asleep. I assure you, those recliners are comfortable beyond belief. Even if the movie is terrible, I still feel like I get my moneys worth.  However, the problem is that the only bar near enough to the theater is your TGI Friday's. Unfortunately, the service at this location is horrendous. Your bartenders consistently ignore patrons when they arrive, take forever to deliver orders, and in many cases are down right rude. Just this evening, I had my good friend time our transaction. It took 4 minutes before a bartender even greated us, and another 3 and a half minutes to get 2 simple beers. This falls far below even the mediocre standard established by your other restaurants.  I've worked in the restaurant and hospitality industry for ten years. Although I'm no expert in TGI Friday's, I like to think I know a thing or two. I've danced with a three-for-all on several occasions. I've stared down an ultimate margarita in the face without flinching. And I've got enough Jack Daniels sauce in deep freeze to keep me knee deep in flat-iron steaks and baby-back ribs through the zombie apocalypse. But your Levittown location makes me wonder if my preparations for the fall of society  would have been better at the Applebees take out window. Normally, I give restaurants a pass. However, the Friday's of Levittown has let me down in almost every way. No matter if it's a bustling Saturday night, or a Wednesday afternoon when I'm the only customer there. They fail every time.  After finally speaking up and saying something tonight, the manager gave me a business card for a free entrée. I'd considering going back to use it, but I don't know when I'll have the time. Sincerely, Steve",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=40

Al G.,"Merrick, NY",0,65,,3.0,4/11/2016,"Went here yesterday for the endless apps because it quite worth the $12. They had some new beef app on the menu, forget what exactly it was called but hey it doesn't matter because they were out of them. Ordered other apps and they were cooked well. Boneless wings were terrific. Wanted another order of pot stickers but from the time I had my first order to the time I wanted the second order which was about 30 minutes they ran out of them too. Don't ask me how a place that wants you to get endless apps runs out of them. I would think they would order extra and maybe they did but they needed more extra.

wendy p.,"New York, NY",30,58,45,1.0,3/5/2016,"Oh My goodness the noise level in this Friday's is so bad you cannot hear your self think let alone enjoy eating or speaking to your dining partner its impossible. But, how about this, the waiters and bartenders can't hear you at all or each other! Only two tables and four bar stools occupied in the bar area, One table full of noisy children running around and screaming. I think it might be the acoustics they should look into it.  With so few people in the bar It still took us 20 minutes to get the bartenders attention. She was very friendly once she decided to come over however after giving us an incorrect order she became belligerent and testy. I pointed out that maybe the noise level caused the confusion and instead of changing our drinks order she rolled her eyes and walked away. Whoa. Never had an experience like this in a Fridays before so needless to say even though it is the closest one to my home I will not be returning. Ever.

W K.,"New York, NY",0,2,,1.0,3/11/2017,"Went to order Friday's to go on a Friday night. The restaurant is not set up well for to go orders - you have to wait by the bar where servers are walking back and forth by the kitchen and there is nowhere to stand. When we arrived at the restaurant, they told us they thought we cancelled our order because apparently someone else placed an order under the same name and decided to cancel and the staff confused the two orders (oddly enough my credit card was still charged). Had to wait an additional 15 minutes at the restaurant while they prepared our order. The staff did not seem sympathetic or responsive to my needs and I felt like they just wanted to get us out the door. Even the manager didn't seem to care about the situation. The worst, however, was that after writing a complaint on their website, we were never contacted by anyone in customer service and I felt like we were completely ignored. Of all the places I have gotten food from, the customer service from Friday's is the worst. Their menu is also very lacking in any healthier options for people trying to eat lighter. I would advise anyone to stay away from here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=40
Samantha F.,"Whitestone, NY",1,17,1,4.0,3/5/2013,"I think TGI Friday's have really come a long way in recent years.  They really have elevated their menu to a level of quality I wouldn't expect from a chain.  I never like Applebee's or Chilis.  Everything seems fried or like bar food and has a certain taste that smacks of large chain. The absolute best item I've had here is the Jack Daniel's ribeye steak.  It is always tender, cooked just right and comes with an amazing, sweet and savory Jack Daniels glaze.  It is addictive.  I've eaten steaks at the best steakhouses, and although this is smaller and not quite the same experience, the meat is very high quality.  And the price is right for a quick, casual bite in the afternoon. The sides are surprisingly good too.  The parmesan fries are outstanding.  They are thick steak fries and come with a garlic sauce and nice shavings of cheese.  The vegetable medley has zucchini and yellow squash, my favorites.  I also like their wedge salad with chunky blue cheese and bacon crumble. My friend got a garlic shrimp dish and it was very good, but very heavy on fresh chunks of garlic so be prepared.  The nice new addition they've made is to serve our meal on cast iron skillets, so the food stayed hot throughout the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=80

Mandy R.,"Odessa, FL",39,27,24,1.0,7/29/2014,"Can you say nightmare dining!! Lordy! It appeared was going fine with the drink order, and went down hill fast. There were 7 of us, and only 5 ordered food. First, two if the orders came out, and then about a half hour went by then a 3rd order came out delivered by the manager apologizing that it was late, and he didn't even notice that 3 other peoples orders were still missing. Well another 35 minutes later and the other three orders made it to the table. Also may I add it was there 10 special on three, all you can eat apps well more like when they feel like bringing the food you may be able to eat a few plates but you may have to dine for hours to exceed what you would normally get if you just ordered one app. Then the drink debacle.... Well they bring out two drinks in one shaker, and if they hadn't added a ridiculous amount of ice it may have actually filled up two glasses, but no such luck. The first time wasn't as bad as the second time. It literally filled up one glass and a sip in the other. Now let's get to the check... I guess Florida and NY are different in the question would you like separate checks, because that as well was a ordeal, and when it eventually did happen they just decided to add a whole extra meal that no one got at our table to my bill bad mistake since I am a huge yelper. I had to once again leave the table to track down the waitress that actually occurred on three separate occasions through out the night , and ask to please remove the charge, and never did I receive a canceled charge receipt   So the entire experience of the dining portion of the evening was a nightmare joke. Thankfully for us and said Fridays we were in the company of amazing friends, and our complaints went unheard until now. This was a Monday night and it was not what I would call  busy at all.

I got the jack daniels chicken sandwich which was OKAY at best. It was very difficult to eat and somewhat dry. My boyfriend got the buffalo wingmans burger and requested an egg to be added.

The bus boy had stated that the sides of spinach would be right out, but yet, we had to ask the waitress to bring it out after 10 minutes. The ribs were quite delicious. The skirt steak was very fatty and did not have the Jack Daniel's sauce on it, which led us to believe that we were given the wrong steak.

Not very crowded at all for a late Sunday afternoon.  The hostess asked us if it would be ok if she sat us at one of the high top tables by the bar.  There were enough regular tables available but whatever, we sat where she sat us.  After a few minutes the waiter comes over to take our drink order.  We keep it simple....glass of wine and a beer. I put my appetizer order in for wings. Drinks come and we order our main course.  We each order one of the steak  choices, one cooked medium the other medium well.   Broccoli was one of the sides that was offered with the dish but they were out of broccoli so we had to mix and match side dishes. We also ordered a tomato basil soup. The wings came and they were very good, so food wise I thought we were off to a good start.  The main dishes came out in a fair amount of time.  A few bites into each steak, we noticed that instead of cooked medium and medium well, they were both barely medium...maybe even closer to rare. We were tempted to ask the waiter to take them back to cook to order, but he was busy correcting an error on the bill for the people next to us..... and also being hungry we didn't want to wait any longer.   We had some steak left over so we asked for it to be wrapped to go..at that point we realized we never got the soup we ordered. When the waiter came over to take our leftovers to be wrapped, he informed us the soup had been accidentally served to a different table. At that point we were done eating so told him just take it off the bill.    He took the leftovers and gave us the check, which I paid by credit card. He rang it up and brought it back to be signed, so we signed and left.  It wasn't until we were on the road that I realized he never brought back our leftovers.  This place seems unorganized.  From seating to service to how meals are cooked.

Food was mediocre like super mediocre I didn't even touch my food I just cut it up to tiny pieces and eh it just had no flavor tasted like I was eating rubber. My sever was trying to rush everyone out. It was really ridiculous. I feel like if you barely come to check on us then don't try rushing us out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown
Sabrina K.,"Farmingdale, NY",111,15,,3.0,11/11/2014,"I'm going to make this quick cause...well...it's Friday's. We're not talking about a gourmet meal here people. What we want is our hot food to be hot and our drinks to be cold and refilled often.  I consider myself a foodie but not a food snob if that makes sense. Friday's food at the Levittown location is as it should ....relatively priced, fresh, typical. I have zero complaints with anything I've ever ordered at this location. So why the 3 stars instead of 5??? The service. The management at this location is seriously lacking. Waiters and waitresses almost always are moving in slow motion and the food itself just takes FOREVER to come out. Which is truly a shame because most of the staff happen to be very polite and professional. I have had on two separate occasions had a waitress give me chips or bread to munch on because my food (we're talking a salad or sandwich not a friggin rack of lamb) has taken almost 30 to 45 minutes to come out.  I think going to a place like this, you have certain and reasonable expectations. Not having to wait a half hour for a salad should be one of them. And I should probably mention that I work nights, so all the times I have been here have been during the day when the place has very few customers. An easy fix I hope they work on!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=60

Ariel R.,"Woodbury, NY",68,46,1,4.0,10/29/2015,"I like this Fridays for the burgers and appetizers.  The burgers are really good.  I think the new double burgers are too greasy though.  The string bean fries are great as well as the flat breads and potstickers.  Deserts are good too.  Can't vouch for everything else, but those items are good.  Drinks are good too, but expensive unless you stick to beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=60

We had to have a host hunter her down for refills. we had an extra charge on our account under open, which she failed to explain there was extra charge for something we ordered till we got the bill. We waited 25 minutes for the bill, she had constantly told us not to rush but barely checked on us. When we finally got the bill, the correct server name wasn't even on the bill.

Jenny C.,"New York, NY",83,586,516,3.0,6/3/2012,"It was Saturday night and I was STARVING. I didn't really care where I was eating at that point. My boyfriend suggested TGI Friday's since we figured Texas Roadhouse would be a 2+ hour wait or something ridiculous like that. At TGI Fridays it was merely a 20 mins wait (maybe less actually). We were seated in a cozy booth and greeted by our server Denise. She was nice and friendly but a little too friendly/perky? While she was quite helpful with the menu and ordering and bringing us refills without asking, she wasn't always around when we actually needed her.  As for the food, we had the spinach artichoke flatbread, which was decent but it was less flatbread and more matzo-type cracker. For entrees, I tried the spicy beer cheese burger which was pretty good, but I got tired of it after the first half. My boyfriend had the caribbean rubbed ribs which were pretty good. For dessert we had the salted caramel cake.  Overall it hit the spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=60

Gina Marie B.,"Plainview, NY",167,485,21,2.0,6/29/2013,"Eh such a shame I love Fridays. My waitress was very nice! However there were other things I did not like. Upon entering the restaurant my party and I smelled something really bad. Like not 'bathroom' bad, but almost like the smell of something extremely musty. Or honestly the spell of the extermination spray. Maybe they just got sprayed? However the restaurant had this horribly stale smell. Almost enough to make us want to leave. Stupidly we stayed.  We got to the table and I immediately took out the silverware from the incredibly wrinkled napkin ( I was hungry and ready to eat). I almost threw up when I saw my silverware was so dirty. It had these sticky smudges and gook all over it. Cmon really?  I am not a picky person but to have that nasty of silverware is unacceptable and it just shows the overall cleanliness of the store. Good thing we had a super nice waitress who took care of us right away! She was very pleasant!  Our food came to the table cold and not fresh at all. The food itself was nothing special and pretty lame. I could make better food myself at home with a few regular ingredients. It seriously was not worth the price. I should really be criticizing it more because it really was a joke. The two stars goes to there onion soup. I always get onion soup here, it is my favorite. Luckily that part of the meal was good!  It was just all rather disappointing. I go to Friday's restaurants in other areas a lot and I am usually always satisfied and love it there.

Mark D.,"Nassau, NY",7,22,9,3.0,11/2/2014,"Well, it is Friday's.  It was busy but not prime dinner time, under a 5 min wait for two. Some staff seemed to be super busy while others seemed to be dancing to the music being played and not working.  Our drinks came out quickly but when the chips and salsa seemed to take a long time I decided to check yelp.  I pointed out the poor ratings on service to our server and he stated ""I am not qualified to comment on behalf of the company, I will get my manager"". Humm... Sounds like he had to call in the legal department. The manager came out and notes they were trying to do better.  looking at the calories, they didn't have a burger under 1100 calories. I thought that was rather silly. The 10oz sirloin was only 570.  I am not counting calories here but a burger and pie and coffee was nearly 3000 calories. I try to keep under 2500 for the day!  The entree menu is really rather limited since I was last at a TGI Fridays over 5+ years ago. I ordered the 10pz sirloin with 2 sides. baked potato, and creamed spinach.  Out of baked potatos??  But they had mashed.  Humm.. Asked for creamed spinach  without the mushrooms the waiter notes were in them. The shrooms can't be removed.  OK, now I got it.  Their food is ""flash frozen"" and just reheated.  I asked if the mashed potatoes were fresh or a mix.  He went and pulled his manager over again.  I asked how is it you are out of baked potatoes but have mashed ? And are they real?  he advised they receive the potatos and the mashed potatoes flash frozen, but they are ""real"". The sirloin was not quite ""restaurant grade"".  The industry generally gets the best cuts of beef before consumers.  If you were not aware, you are now.  This was a bit tough and more consumer grade.  It was OK. But to be honest, for $23 for the entree I can pay another $7 and get a better sirloin and fresh baked potato and have my spinach without the mushrooms because it is made fresh not flash frozen much in the same way as ""first class"" airline food.  Great for first class airline food, but this is a restaurant. I gave it 3 stars because I suspect there is a need for a chain that you know what you are getting.  It will be rather consistent based on its manufacturing process, as opposed to ""cook"".  it wasn't great and it wasn't awful. It was good for that ""mass consumption"" style chain.  $55 for two of same entrees and a blue moon draft x 2.  OK.  Fresh in most places would have been $75-80. But I know some nice ""hidden treasures"" where you can get fresh for that price.  They are not as easy to find, nor as common as a TGI Fridays is. So TGI Fridays serves its purpose.  It is good for what it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=60

Victoria M.,"Levittown, NY",0,1,,1.0,10/5/2012,"Must have been one of my worst experiences at any restaurant. The hostess was extremely rude, did not greet me as I approached her through the entrance, continued talking to her coworker as I stood in front of her waiting for a number as there was a 30-35 minute wait for a table for 2. However, the hostess was completely polite and courteous to the couple just before me.  After being seated at our extremely filthy table (table surface, seating, and underneath were all soiled and crumby), we were greeted promptly by our waitress. We ordered and received our drinks and appetizers. Main entrée was served soon after; I had ordered the black angus cheeseburger. Ordered the burger medium, it was served fairly pink throughout, most definitely NOT medium, I could almost say it was barely cooked. When I pointed this out to the waitress, she insisted that I was wrong and that the burger was most definitely medium well. Completely irritated, she offered to take the burger away and quickly did so. She was short with us for the rest of our brief time there. I will never return to this location and do not recommend this Fridays location to anyone else unless you are looking for a disgusting table, rude workers, and raw entrées.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=60
David M.,"Merrick, NY",94,468,346,3.0,1/27/2013,"Typical of the genre.  It's one step up from Fast Food.  Restaurant experience was mediocre from beginning to end.  Staff were nice enough, but often found our server wandering off to chit chat with her co-worker friends.  Food did arrive fast, almost TOO fast, as if it was prepared ahead of time, which it probably was.  Everything tasted acceptable, except wife's veggies were stone cold and required replacement, or microwaving (who knows what they do when they take it back).  The big advantage of coming to this location is avoiding the large crowds at the Huntington or Westbury locations.  We got in and seated immediately.  I wish they didn't change the menu so many times.  I have to re-learn everything every time I come here.  It's probably one of the better TGIF's on Long Island.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-levittown?start=60

We walk in the hostess was really nice and seated us.  Then the wait began about 15 mins before anyone came over to us.  Told the waitress we are off to a bad start considering no one was there! I could see if they were busy maybe ?? She apologized and we ordered our food. The food was good and the wait began again for the check about a half hour.

Carol N.,"East Meadow, NY",17,31,,3.0,7/1/2014,"Had a decent lunch at TGI Friday's. The service was exceptional; the server's name was Frank. My friend and I each had a Lunch Pairing. I had French onion soup and Friday's shrimp. The soup was ok, just a big glop of cheese plopped in the middle of the bowl, not browned as it should have been. Very difficult to eat politely. The shrimp were very good, not greasy, and came with limp cold French fries. My friend ordered the turkey and Swiss, which also had bacon and avocado, not mentioned in the menu. My friend doesn't eat avocado. Frank nicely offered to take it back but she removed it herself. With food allergies, Friday's should list all the main ingredients in a dish. She also got limp cold fries and started her meal with a small Caesar salad.
