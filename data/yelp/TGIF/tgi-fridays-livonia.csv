Heather B.,"Redford Charter Township, MI",8,2,,1.0,6/6/2013,"Good is delish. Service is garbage. This waitress didn't even greet us with a ""hello"" just straight up ""can I get you some drinks?""... Then I ask a question about the menu and it gets answered and the chick walks away. I wasn't done talking. Our appetizer just came, still no silverware. Oh our salad is here now. Still no silverware. Finally got up to get our own silverware. They may have sensed our dissatisfaction because they overcompensated our entrées. Double mashed potatoes turned I to like quadruple mashed potatoes. OVERALL the service sucks and each time we visit we have yet to be provided professional service.  But the food is delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia?start=20
John A.,"Novi, MI",19,67,45,4.0,6/14/2014,"Visit here occasionally, mainly because bar always has room to sit at it for a quick beer and appetizer. Bartenders are pleasant enough. Food is really good. It's a TGI Fridays, so the atmosphere is what you'd expect. Not much going on is usually the feeling I get. I'd prefer to give 3.5 rather than a 4. It's just above average. Not great, not bad. I'd recommend it for a beer and appetizer, but not to make a night out of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia?start=20
Carly P.,"Redford Charter Township, MI",1,1,,1.0,2/15/2014,"Slow service. Food wasn't very good. Too much garlic in the kids spaghetti. Wings and potato skins were cold.

Lynn H.,"Northville, MI",312,514,291,1.0,2/13/2010,"If you're in the mood for TGIF, skip this location and head for the one off of Novi Road by the Novi Towncenter, which is much better managed. Service at this location is extremely slow, the wait staff is inattentive, and both times I visited, I was served dishes with ingredients that had gone bad.

Gerry C.,"Plymouth Charter Township, MI",12,56,87,1.0,2/23/2014,"DO NOT EAT HERE.  If I could give this review NO stars I would. Small portions, terrible wait staff, waited 10 mins to sit down when there were tables open.  Waitress was terrible.  Took at least 25+ mins for our food.    And the food came out cold.  I got the mixed grill which was supposed to come with steak, chicken and shrimp with sautéed spinach and mushrooms and the size of the steak and chicken was ridiculously small.  You could finish it in one bite.  Spinach was raw and I didn't get any mushrooms.  The cooks here do not know how to cook.  Nothing is sautéed everything comes out raw and dry.  I asked to speak to a manager and he came out just confused and not really apologetic.  Offered something they already had sitting.  I was starving so I just ate it.  My experience was horrendous.  I will never go back here.  If you want TGI Fridays, go to the one in Canton because they are a corporate run location.  This location is a franchise and it's run verrrry poorly.  Trust me, you will not enjoy your meal. Save your money or spend it somewhere that will treat you better with better food.  I'd rather eat at Taco Bell down the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia?start=20
Aubrey L.,"Chicago, IL",2,14,4,2.0,9/6/2009,"I shouldn't have expected a lot from TGI Friday's in the first place.  We went on an early Saturday evening, we had to be somewhere at 7:00, so I think we came in around 5:30pm.  It was not very busy and we were greeted right away. Food I've been trying to eat healthier, so I ignored the ""sizzling chicken and shrimp"" which looked really good in the promo photo.  Instead, I opted for the ""right portion, right price"" pan-seared salmon pasta without tomatoes.  Thinking I'd still be hungry with a small portion meal, I ordered a cup of broccoli cheddar soup first.  The soup was good, but nothing that I couldn't have gotten from a can at home.  When my meal came, it was bland and the salmon was extremely dry and had some grey goop on certain parts of the bottom.  Fridays isn't known for their fish, so I probably should have chosen something a little safer.  My friend seemed to enjoy his Shanghai Salad with chicken added well enough, but it wasn't his favorite meal of all time.  The desserts look a-mazing, but we didn't order any. Alcohol I ordered a blackberry long island (there's actually a typo in the promo menu in the description!  Sorry, I'm a nerd).  The first sip was really good, but it tasted nothing like a blackberry infused long island.  The second sip went very down hill and the drink was very tart and the ""debris"" (seeds, rhine, etc.) really got in the way.  I ended up only drinking about an inch out of the glass.  My friend ordered a blackberry martini which came with an extra shaker of about three more refills.  He said my drink was better, but I didn't try his.  He ended up drinking most of mine and I stuck with water. Staff Everyone was exceptionally friendly!  The hostess was warm and welcoming and our server was upbeat and joked around with us a little.  I think she forgot that we hadn't paid yet because we sat with a credit card on top of the bill on the end of the table for about 15 minutes with no sign of our server.  We made a flag out of a straw, napkin soup cup and silverware to get someone's attention. Price Typical of TGI Friday's.  Probably a little pricey for the quality of food, but comparable to other similar restaurants.  The right portion, right price meal was still around $10.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia?start=20
Kelly S.,"Farmington, MI",151,176,22,4.0,3/8/2012,"I normally eat at a different Friday's location & am not a fan of it but this night we were leaving Costco & since this is so close we decided to eat here & I'm glad we did.  The staff was so nice, the food was pretty good & the service was fast.  The restaurant wasn't very busy which was so nice, there weren't any kids here (I'm sure it was pure luck) and it was quiet which made it nice for conversing over dinner.  I would eat at this Friday's over the Dearborn location any day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia?start=20

Taesu B.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",2,58,10,4.0,4/7/2011,"ok, i have high standards, i swear. but TGIF really surprised me. don't get me wrong....i judge a restaurant for what it is. this is a low to mid priced family restaurant. i'm not gonna compare it to the French Laundry you idiots. i've only been to TGIF twice before in my life. i was always an outback guy. SERVICE: terrible hosts/hostesses. robots or a ticket seating system would be MUCH better. ask for LAUREN as your server. she is AMAZING. i'm in love.  friendly, great at explaining things, has your best interest at heart rather than just the upsell. but that made me trust her more. and order more i did. FOOD: ribs (don't get the jack daniel's sweet sauces. get the regular BBQ sauce. i don't know how people eat such sweet sauces.) are better than at outback and pretty good for the price. meat didn't smell and the steak fries were good. i hate steak fries usually. red robin's steak fries are horrible. no wonder they're free. the spicy fettucine alfredo dish was delicious. don't remember what its called. cajun something? -the grilled salmon and shrimp was good too. shrimp was grilled nicely. but the salmon was good as well.  -the sweet potato fries are great too. -mojito was too sweet. long island was good. -i got the sirloin steak. butter on top was classy. like ruth's chris. hahaha. it was nice and tender. i wonder if they machine tenderize or soak in tenderizer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia?start=20

The bartender said she is new but very professional and friendly. Her service was amazing and struck up a little conversation to pass the time. After submitting my order my appetizer came out at 12 minutes 19 seconds which was the boneless hickory BBQ wings. The entree came out 14 minutes and 20 seconds later. I had the smokehouse stacked burger. Food was great, burger cooked well, nice and juicy and the sauce on the boneless wings I wish I could buy. Time was not to bad since they had a friendly bartender. I had 3 summer shandy beers which were on special for $4 for a 16 oz draft. Atmosphere is nice, clean facility, plenty of parking. Easy to access. All in all a great place. I cannot complain. I am not even from here but this is one of my favorite places so I go to them to rate the quality.

Blaise B.,"Ann Arbor, MI",51,379,7,4.0,3/29/2015,"I think Friday's is my favorite of all the mid-level American chain restaurants, and for pretty much only one reason: the nachos. Order the nachos. They use chips that are basically half a taco shell, and actually put all the nacho toppings on each individual chip.  What a simple and ingenious idea! Their food is pretty standard.  Just like Applebee's, Chili's, etc. you always know what to expect, so if that's what you're going for Friday's is a good call.  Just be sure to order the nachos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia
Cristina B.,"Chesterfield, MI",260,137,65,3.0,1/18/2015,"The only real reason of my endeavor today was my man friend and I have a list of restaurants we want to go to together and TGI Friday's happened to be on there. Plus, we got the gift card from Kroger and got ourselves 100 extra fuel points (score!) Let me start out by saying the parking at this location is a mess, as is the cramped dining quarters. We arrived sometime around 5pm and the place itself was packed. I took this as a good sign of good food and solid service .... wrong.  The hostess seated my friend and I in the bar area at a two person tiny table that they somehow try to make available for parties of three. The table itself was squashed between a large party of 6 and another couple who thought it was acceptable to leave my friend and I absolutely no room to move our chairs. After telling my friend how much I dislike being seated in the bar area of most restaurants (too loud, bad service) we tried relocating to a real table. Except, of course, we couldn't flag down an employee or hostess.  So ..... we settled back into our cramped quarters. It took our waiter (who was actually quite kind) about 10 minutes to take our drink order and another 10 minutes to receive those drinks and more time again to take our order. My man decided on a burger of sorts and I settled on a turkey burger myself.  A server delivered our food in a rush, by throwing our plates on the table and having them slide around first. So rude! Never again did I see our waiter. Never was asked for an additional refill on water. Never was asked how our food was (burgers were mediocre and fries were bland unless loaded with condiments) and we waited for our bill for sometime.  Like i mentioned before, I was paying with a gift card. Our bill itself for two burgers and two waters was $20.03 -- not a horrible price but as a chain restaurant with bad service and bland food, it was disappointing. I'm not even sure if you are allowed to pay for tip with your gift card, but the receipt did show ""gift card charge"" below the tip section of the receipt so I went with it. Not that the never really seen waiter deserved his $4.97 tip, but it probably would've taken him another hour to return to  the table to answer my question. Long story short -- 3 stars. All for the food. Service is lacking and the fact that I saw countless parties waiting in the lobby as a left and just as I passed several emptied and messy tables -- it shows. Try one of the other restaurants nearby instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia
Charles W.,"South Lyon, MI",19,123,22,4.0,1/10/2015,"You know what your getting into at Friday's... typical chain frozen food with stupid crap hung up on the walls.  My wife seems to think they toned it down; however without turning my head I was able to see a billiard set, Gumby, drums, star trek enterprise, and a clone wars mask on the wall and no matter how I turned my head I couldn't catch a glimpse of  the football game.  I guess this is a family restaurant so they place an emphasis on families spending time with each other.   That's great to see in this day and age.  So often we forget the beauty in looking at souveniers no one wants as our children bury their heads in an iPhone.  It's times like these we should cherish as so easy they slip away from us :-P In all seriousness though I do enjoy their fries and chicken fingers.  Gotta substitute that tasty bbq sauce.  Their burgers are surprisingly good as well. I could see service being an issue.  We were seated and the manager noticed us not being helped so he told the servers.  It's nice they were on top of that.  To be fair we were waiting on someone but it would've been nice to have drinks.  Our waitress was very nice and attentive when we did get her. When it comes to typical chains all they have to do is provided good service and they did.  The food was as expected and I do enjoy the chicken finger comfort food.  I'm giving them 4 stars (4 chain restaurant stars, though yelp doesn't differentiate)  because everyone knows Friday's and they didn't screw anything up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia
Jill H.,"South Lyon, MI",96,222,75,4.0,1/25/2015,"I normally wouldn't have chosen TGI for a Saturday night meal but I was on my way to the airport and it was a convenient choice for comfort food.  Over the years I've become used to Friday's taking their time and the following descriotion really isn't out of the ordinary but it all ended up to be an overall good experience.  We were immediately seated but waited sometime before anyone came to our table to acknowledge our presence. The manager looked like he was on his way out but noticed us a made sure someone came to our table right away. The service was great from there on out. Now, although we had reliable service I wasn't sure how much time the food would take so we ordered our food as soon as we had someone to take our drink orders.  The chicken fingers and seasoned fries were exactly what I had a taste for and came out within a decent window of time. It's always a reliable dish and exactly what I was craving, otherwise I should get my head checked for spending $11 on chicken fingers ;) Now, the portion wasn't anything overwhelming in fact, on my way out, I noticed that the kid's basket portion seemed to be about the same size. It was just piled in a basket as opposed to a fancy rectangular plate...but it won't stop me from ordering it again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia

We were sat at the booth directly behind the waiters podium, meaning that about every five minutes I would have a waiters butt hanging into my ""personal space bubble"". After about ten minutes of this I got up and moved to a vacant booth. We ordered and appetizer, it took 15 minutes only to be brought to us freezing cold. During this time there were no drink refills. I ordered a steak for my entree cooked medium rare, it came out grey, tough and cold. The manager was nice enough to take the steak off my bill as I did not feel like taking an extra twenty minutes to see if they could make a new steak and make it right.

Paul H.,"Hudson, OH",0,7,,2.0,11/11/2014,"Not the greatest experience I've ever had. Giving this location a second chance as first wasn't worthy of me hitting the keys. Sat down at the bar, stuck my hand in some goo on the bar so I'm all sticky. Got my beer, the high light of the night and a menu. After at least 10 minutes with my menu closed and sipping away my order got taken. Had a chicken Caesar salad and the dressing was horrible and it had tomatoes in it. I don't think I've ever had that before and it didn't enhance the experience.  With one sip left in my beer I was asked if I'd like another and decided I wouldn't although it could make the experience better. Er will see now how long to get my check.

I ordered the Cobb salad. It was good, but I don't see how you could mess that up. Hence the reason for ordering it! I elected to sit at the bar. The bartender/waitress was ok. She had very little personality. She was more like a robot just going thru the motions. Took order, brought food, ask if it's ok, left the check & never asked if I wanted a refill on beverages.

Scott K.,"Ann Arbor, MI",120,86,82,1.0,3/5/2013,"You're probably thinking, what did you expect?  I used to go to Friday's all the time, but many years have passed.  I received a coupon in the mail - why not give it a go? We ordered a sirloin/shrimp combo and a flatiron steak with parmesan fries and a house salad.  Let's start with the good things: The shrimp were great, and the parmesan fries were strange but pretty good, with a tanginess I didn't expect. The waitress was kind but confused.  My salad came one minute before our steaks, so I pretended to be european and ate it last.  Hup hup, cheerio guv'nor.  My medium flatiron steak came browned through and through - a desert wasteland of shoe-leather 'flavor'. My wife's sirloin seemed like it was the wrong size... which it was, because it was a flatiron, as our receipt later indicated.  It came medium when she ordered medium-rare, because unlike myself she likes the taste of blood and luke-warm muscles.  What she got was slightly pink, hot beef muscle. The wait staff asked if we wanted to talk to the manager when we pointed out the problems and I demurred, because I'm friendly and foolish. We gave her our coupon and she went away for awhile, coming back with a brand spankin' new receipt with the same ol' price as before.  Wait a tic... She came back with the manager at that point, who explained how it'd take a little while before the original price would disappear from my charge card... and didn't mention anything else.  Pretty sure he didn't realize this was just the last straw. The card we received in the mail had two more coupons on it for the month - I decided it was best used by giving it to the table behind us, because we're unlikely to return in 2013.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-livonia

Our server, Lauren F was very good, but the kitchen sent out our orders in a very strange way. First came the soups for the two who had ordered them. We then waited, and then came the flatbread appetizers for those who ordered them, and then we waited. Finally came my shrimp entrée and then the burgers and we ate them while everyone else waited.
