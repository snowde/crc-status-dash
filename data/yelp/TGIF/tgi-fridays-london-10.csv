Molly B.,"Baltimore, MD",15,48,47,4.0,5/11/2017,"Visited this Fridays while I was in London, expecting to use some of my points. Joke was on me as England is a different franchise, so I couldn't earn or use.  Visited around 2pm, it wasn't terribly busy. However, by the time I left it got crowded.  The staff were friendly. I found the most AWESOME Milkshake on the menu, so of course I ordered it once I found out it's not served in the U.S.  Omg. That shake was DIVINE.  I ordered a small Caesar salad with cucumbers added. I was surprised at how it was sliced, but the flavors were good old familiar Fridays.  The bathrooms are downstairs. There is a cute mural on the wall with a Harley parked, where you can take pictures on/with it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10
Helena D.,"London, United Kingdom",111,196,1447,4.0,4/10/2016,"If you haven't checked out this place before, I think it's a place you have to experience. The American themed restaurant has everything you'd expect - an extensive menu, large portions, lots of cheese, burgers, ribs, loaded potato skins, awesome cocktails (and giant sized cocktails are available too) and cool memorabilia (like sports collectables, a giant motorbike and who doesn't want to see a giant Spiderman figurine while you eat!).  The staff are super friendly and if you're lucky enough to celebrate your birthday here, you're in for a treat (or embarrassment depending on you look at it) as they sing to you and make you a ballon hat. They have cool little booth style seats and the option to also eat in the bar area (which is also cool).  The food was good and I especially liked the JD sauce they served with the sesame chicken.  This place has a great atmosphere and with so much choice on the menu, you'll be spoilt for choice. Also, they are doing a special late night happy hour if you download the app (2-4-1 cocktails from 8pm, Sunday-Fri), so I think I'll have to go back to check that out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10
Nickie C.,"London, United Kingdom",133,446,373,2.0,11/8/2016,"Poor all around, really. I went on a weekday at lunch and the restaurant wasn't empty but it wasn't at all busy. There was no one at the station where you wait to be seated so I stood around there for quite a while, before finally someone sat me.  Then they offered me the choice of two bad tables, which also? Not great. I had to wait 10 minutes to order (I was alone and ready pretty much immediately, but I couldn't see the waiter anywhere). The food, which was just a tostada stack, took over 20 minutes and came dried out and a bit cold. The waiter did apologise for the wait, but too little too late, really. I managed to eat enough to be full and got my bill. I asked for my bill and said I had a code and indicated to my phone where the code was. He ignored the code, did the bill, and then came back to see what the code was about. Why did he think I was telling him? Obviously it was a code to be entered in before doing the cheque... so he re-did it and brought my bill, which was now just for my drink since I had a free main course from doing a survey (which is why I didn't bother complaining about the tostada). The waiter saw the food wasn't really eaten and asked if it was okay (like after I had the bill). I said it was fine, but he could tell it wasn't. He gave me a bit of a half-assed sorry as he cleared the plate. And then when I had the bill, corrected, and handed him a £10 to pay for my drink, I had to wait again while he went off for change - and then he did that annoying thing that waiters do, and brought the change in a way that indicated I should be leaving a tip. I'm afraid the service just wasn't there!  2 stars because the portion size was huge, and I've had that meal before and it's normally good. But I'm being generous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10
Erik G.,"Fredensborg, Denmark",0,5,,2.0,2/14/2017,"First we got the wrong drinks - half pints, even though it was stated 500 ml. in the menu.  Then we waited approx. 45 minuts for the food. The  kids meals were half cold and not good. Our food for the adults were with dry meat (chicken and duck).  Compared to our visit 3 years ago this was a huge disapointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10
Beth W.,"London, United Kingdom",45,19,,2.0,3/30/2015,"I have been to a few different TGI restaurants in the UK, this one in Covent Garden was very disappointing!!  We went at lunch time so it was pretty quiet compared to other TGIs we have visited, however we waited a long time to have our order taken and found it very difficult to get anyones attention when trying to ask for more BBQ sauce. The waiters were friendly, but overall the service wasn't good! The atmosphere was also disappointing, our table and menus were grubby and sticky!    I had the Chicken Finger BLT sandwich, which was nice but nothing special! Overall, it was disappointing and I wouldn't return to this particular TGI restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10
Cheryl T.,"Williamsport, PA",0,1,,2.0,7/8/2016,We stopped in on our way through to theater from the markets. We just wanted some appetizers and drinks before theater. We waited so long after being seated we actually had just picked up our purses to leave because the place was dead and the waitress refused to even acknowledge we existed. Not nearly as friendly as other London servers. Overall the worst in our trip. After we finally got our drinks I waited 20 minutes for a second drink and I finally went up to the bar to order. Overall our waitress asked us one time if we needed anything. Horrible! I'd rather pay more and go to angus steakhouse to get better service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10
Monique E.,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",2,7,8,4.0,1/7/2015,"Had a lovely meal, it is our first trip to London (without being part of a school trip), after being tired from out trip we were thankfully seated quickly and given space for our bags (we had two small suitcases). We picked out our meals quickly and our waitress arrived with our drinks and very soon arrived with our meals. I had the Friday's Double Jack Daniels Burger (legendary Jack Daniel's sweet 'n' smoky glaze, montery jack cheese, Jack Daniel's candied bacon and Friday's mayo) while my friend had Cheeseburger Deluxe (Simply grilled and topped with cheese and Friday's mayo). The food was delicious and was well cooked, and waitress kept checking our drinks (we had bottomless) and after taking away our finished meals we had their Toffee popcorn Sundae which we both shared and thoroughly enjoyed it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10
Andreas P.,"Clapham, London, United Kingdom",37,78,50,1.0,9/12/2013,"Just don't.  TGI Fridays's quality has been going downhill since well, ever. The cocktails were bad. Tasted like flavoured juice. The food was bad. Burgers bland and apple sauce on a burger is a big no no. The service wasn't friendly. The place smelt like feet. The cake from hummingbird was delicious but we brought that ourselves. Just don't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10
Nat K.,"Pensacola, FL",1,92,75,2.0,11/21/2014,"Typical London service, so don't be expecting much. Our server didn't get to us for at least 10 minutes.  And that was only because we flagged down another server for help. One chocolate milkshake was tainted with some strawberry and  the margarita was subpar for a TGIF. The food however was good, once it finally got to us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10
David J.,"London, United Kingdom",55,1854,8971,3.0,6/29/2010,"I'll be completely honest here - large chain restaurants are not my thing, and especially not burger joints. I was dragged here by some former work colleagues who wanted something quick and filling on a night out.  I confess was pleasantly surprised to find that there are some veggie items - a spicy veggie burger, a spicy pasta dish and some Mexican-themed items (fajitas and so on), as well as salads.  As far as food goes, I went for a fajita, on the assumption that it's hard to do it badly, given that refried beans are fairly mushy anyway. And it was OK, and filling, if not piping hot. Others went mainly for burgers and fries, and seemed happy enough, for the money.  Less good was the service - it was very busy, and our waitress worked like a trojan, but the food still took ages to come, so the 'fast food' intention was rather thwarted.  After my visit, a friend pointed out (rather too cheerfully, I thought) that this branch was fined last year for serious environmental health breaches (see   ). I take comfort from the fact that, after such an episode, hygiene must now be top of the agenda for this restaurant...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10
Nick L.,"San Mateo, CA",82,1025,13,4.0,10/13/2011,"This is in the tourist hot spot zone. American style dining at it's finest! Cocktails at the bar. Ribs galore. Been here a number of times, it's the kinda place that has something to cater to all different sorts of taste. It can be used for celebratory purposes or just as somewhere to get some hearty grub. Most TGI's in the UK and US for that matter have the same kind of eclectic look of just putting stuff all over the place to overwhelm the eye! They do that well! The food here is reasonable and the drinks alcholic!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10
Akin T.,"London, United Kingdom",0,63,40,4.0,7/25/2008,"Tgi friday,basically cater to american food,burgers,chips and stakes and good drinks.well trained staff with good manners. nice sitting arrangement,you can have your own private parties here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10
Smarty P.,"London, United Kingdom",0,23,,3.0,6/6/2012,Good food. Burgers are good. It's a bit overpriced. It's in the middle of everything in Covent Garden.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10
Leon C.,"Norwich, United Kingdom",692,1003,700,3.0,12/6/2008,"Maybe T.G.I Fridays have had their hayday but for a good night out they are still high on my list.  The crazy staff and maniacal atmosphere may have subdued somewhat but the bartenders are still a joy to watch with their razzle dazzle style of cocktail flair.  Not only do the guys flair, but if they have time they may treat you to magic tricks and puzzles. For drinks I would suggest the Beverley Hills Iced Tea which is a long Island Iced Tea topped with champagne rather than cola. Ask them for a little Crème de Mure to make it into a Grateful Dead and you'll have a strong fruity cocktail to get you on your way. Eating at TGI's is great to as the portions are big, tasty and hearty, although it is a little expensive If you can get a seat at the bar, take it and order your food there. Sitting around the bar is the best place to be as you'll make new friends, be entertained and be part of the atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10
Aline D.,"London, United Kingdom",7,228,237,3.0,12/21/2008,"Always bustling and loud, this amusement park of a place is not too bad when it comes to their filling and completely fattening American grub. Their BBQ baby back pork ribs are pretty good and served as you would expect - grilled and lathered in sticky sauce and served with fries and Cajun battered onion rings.  If your up for it, they do a good, but very rich, Baileys, mint liqueur, vanilla ice cream and Oreo drink. Actually doubles as a decent dessert! It can feel like a bit of a tourist trap along with tourist prices, but once in a long while, it isn't too bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10
Keith T.,"Colchester, United Kingdom",27,184,90,3.0,8/23/2008,It's not the best restaurant in London but it's not the worst.  The service can be slow and it can be very very busy but the staff do seem to manage to cope (just about).  The food is h ot when it arrives but I am not sure if this is a genral TGi thing (I cannot remember) - but the paper that the burgers/fries arrive in are always really greasy from this branch.  I shouldn't knock it too much as it's a great stop gap for a cheap and cheerful meal but I have to agree with a fellow Qyper and say that the drinks really do contain far too much ice!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-10
