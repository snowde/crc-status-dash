Nickie C.,"London, United Kingdom",133,446,373,3.0,9/16/2014,"Now TGI Friday's isn't fine dining. It's not even great American dining, or good value - but I can't deny that I enjoy it. We popped in before a visit to the cinema. It was early - around 6pm - and there was maybe one other table of people in the whole (very large) place. We weren't greeted when we entered as the host was talking to some staff members but as soon as he noticed we were there, we were taken over to a big booth, and he took our drinks order as well. The seating was a bit dirty - I tried to brush it off but it was more of a scrub job. The cocktail menu was a bit sticky as well - so not the best impression. Our waitress started off well. I ordered 2 starters and my husband ordered a main, all to come at the same time. We had a pretty long wait considering the restaurant was empty - and then all she brought was one of the starters. At this point I had to ask for a drink refill as she didn't notice it was empty. So we started eating the beer cheese dip with pretzel bread and about a minute later she brings the rest of the food. It was all enjoyable - which was lucky, considering the waitress vanished. There was another waiter there who walked by our table about 5 times without a word, so if she was on break or whatever, there was no cover. Bearing in mind that there was literally one other occupied table, this really wasn't okay. Finally we caught her attention and got the bill, which was paid quickly. So a mixed bag. Perhaps if the food was better than nice, or the service amazing, or the restaurant amazingly well-kept, I would have found another star. But 3 is right, middle of the road, would go again but not rushing to do so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-12
Brian C.,"Pinner, United Kingdom",130,410,271,4.0,9/16/2014,"I'm pretty much a fan of every American chain in the UK, and TGI's has been here for a long time now. Mostly I've gone to the Central London location, but we were out here to see Lucy at the Cineworld and had a decent amount of time so thought we'd pop in. The first time we came here it was quite new, and was still bedding in - and you could tell. This time it was much better with only one flaw - the wait staff have far too big an area to cover. For example when you're looking for your waitress and she's right at the other end of the restaurant, it shows it's not the best set up. But the saviour here was the food. We love the buffalo chicken bites and they were great once again. The beer cheese dip and pretzel bread was great and I loved my jack Daniels glazed chicken sandwich - the bacon is candied in JD as well. The food was just brilliant and the waitress when she was within a hundred yards of us was great. Will come again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-12
Nimz P.,"Wembley, United Kingdom",88,255,29,3.0,10/18/2014,"Been here a few times over summer and its just like all the other TGI Friday's I have been to. The only thing I can comment on is the food isn't that great and the chef does not know the difference between the medium rare or rare steak. Also the nachos aren't the greatest here either as its basically a load of tortilla chips with 1 jalapeno and a small amount of sour cream and salsa, also no guacamole. Drinks are ok but as a majority of the staff are very young, they not that experienced at making cocktails, so would stick to simple drinks and no cocktails. Unless standards improve will probably not come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-12
Priya K.,"London, United Kingdom",63,180,265,1.0,3/27/2015,"The worst service possible at this place, takes about 40 mins for food to arrive on a normal quiet day and even then it's cold. Cocktails are not up to scratch, better off bringing my own to be honest. Not worth the price either, better places out there. They call themselves American, yet nothing on their menu tastes or seems it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-12
