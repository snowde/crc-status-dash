Sammijo S.,"London, United Kingdom",39,122,75,5.0,1/4/2017,"Firstly, i just wanted to explain the title. It is obviously me saying that I was fond of the food, but it is also a nod to what I associate TGI Fridays with. The Covent Garden was always full of theatre with bartenders juggling glassware, bottles and ingredients. Flairing takes some training and it can either be excellent to look at or a tad embarassing when a bottle ends being a pile of broken glass on the floor.  TGI's in Westfield does not appear to be cut from the same cloth. There was not one bottle tossed in the air during our viist. That said, it could be because it was lunch time on a Sunday. With no flair show, what else was there? Well I'll tell you, some great tasting food and excellent service. The team are young, probably students, so you would think they do not have the finese of a seasoned waiter/ess. Our waitter, Durell, put that thought to rest with charisma and slickness. We were in a great mood with the lovely weather and he encouraged that to continue with friendly upbeat service. As if that was not enough, i cannot begin to describe how tasty the food was. I ordered the Jack Daniels crispy duck on a hot skillet with garlic mixed peppers and onions. This came with warm tortillas. OMG. The duck meat was well seasoned and succulent melt in the mouth goodness. It fell off the bone with ease. Eleanor had the Garlic chicken with cos lettuce in a caesar dressing with croutons, heritage tomators and regato cheese. To get her carb fix, she had a side of loaded potato skins with cheese and bacon.  I have thought about that duck a lot and when I look the picture I took, my mouth literally waters. I count the days until I get back there and do this all over again. To be fair, I should try something new as I am sure everything on the menu is just as good, but that Duck tho. Wow. Oh and a big thank you to Durell for appreciating our dancing to the cool music they play.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-9
Ga Chun Y.,"King's Lynn, United Kingdom",13,12,37,3.0,5/26/2017,Customer service was better than last time. Lack of air con and air flow. Bit warm. also nachos have not specified jalapeños on the menu. Gf is allergic and we had already said to the server. That's why we got the guacamole separately..... Sigh. Main was better at least.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-9
Vi W.,"London, United Kingdom",81,115,985,2.0,8/18/2016,"T.G.I. Friday's @ Westfield Stratford City - I have been thinking why is that I have always ended up in the food courts, quite often the same place, in Westfield when I want something to eat there. And very simply the answer is that I want something simple, quick and not too expensive then continue with my mission in Westfield Shopping centre.  Looks like T.G.I Friday's read my mind because there is a brand new lunch menu for £7.99. This is a salad and sandwich menu and is only available on weekdays. The sandwich is filled with the usual American favourite sandwich filling of marinara meatballs, texas chilli bowl, pulled pork, roasted vegetable and salads of duck and chicken meat. A side of either fries, pickle slaw, apple slaw or salad is included. For a warm sit down meal in a restaurant, their lunch menu is definitely very competitively priced.  The lunch portions were very generous and looked very enticing, except for the chargrilled chicken breast (I knew I should have gone for the pulled pork! And I don't even usually have chicken breast).  notorious B.L.T sandwich - a thick cut of bacon as promised, albeit somewhat tasteless. The only taste was that it was a grilled meat. meatball marinara sub - the meatballs were OK and the sauce did have a strong tomato taste. The cheese was cheesy as expected in the American way. The aioli was more like garlic tainted mayonnaise. grilled chicken sandwich with apple slaw - I longed for my open sandwich chicken to taste better than it looked. My impression was so true; the chicken breast was very dry and bland. The apple slaw tasted somewhat floury. I took two mouthfuls and left the dish. The manager was taken aback that I left the dish untouched. He also didn't seem to know how to respond as he left with my lunch and did not return.  And on the kids menu, I ordered pork ribs with waffles £4.99 - it was unanimously agreed that it was the best dish! The ribs were tasty and the meat was tender with crunchy waffles. A small side of that baked beans was sort of comfort. If kids eat like this, I don't want to grow up! Apart from the manager's brief appearance, the service was good and friendly. They were very attentive and I felt being taken care of. T.G.I Friday's is on the top floor of Westfield Stratford City and did not have too much of the buzz from shoppers. It was spacious for buggies and room for young children to run around especially if you are sitting in the outside area of the restaurant. Jeremy made me felt like I was a teenager again as a hot date! The lunch menu at T.G.I Friday's is simple, comfort and at £7.99, it was certainly very affordable. We had to have a sundae at the end to satisfy my sweet tooth ;).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-9
Michelle L.,"Boston, MA",0,9,25,5.0,8/27/2016,"Second time there, still coming because of the great service here that we got. Food was not bad, and great place for reunion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-9
Bruce C.,"Wapping, London, United Kingdom",335,81,152,2.0,6/14/2015,"Slow service. Burgers looked like they've been in the freezer. Not fresh meat at all. For the price we're paying, I'd rather eat in McDonalds for less than half the price.  First and last time I'll eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-9
Wayne H.,"London, United Kingdom",396,671,473,4.0,7/16/2014,"Sometimes even the most tired American brands have gem properties. In TGIF's case it's abroad: London Stratford and Dubai. This property features everything I'd expect but with much better quality food, a faux water tower as the centerpiece, and without baseball playing in the background. Buffalo wings are properly deep fried, not nuked, for example.  Good to see Blue Moon, Corona and Sam Adams on offer - rare labels in there here parts. Bottomless Coke is also a plus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-9
Dawn A.,"London, United Kingdom",14,19,72,3.0,6/14/2015,"Food was good as usual. The waitress,  however didn't like the fact they they changed the coleslaw from its traditional recipe to ahalpeno one. Sometimes it's best not to reinvent the wheel, if it's not broken don't try to fix it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-london-9
