Suzanne X.,"Madison, WI",323,105,508,4.0,7/7/2017,"Aloha to the summer, and welcome to the fabulous Luau Party with some new Tiki cocktails! I gave the strawberry one a try for $6 plus an additional $5 to keep the new Tiki themed cup (wrapped up nicely)! So I thought today was the first day the the Tiki cups were on sale, but apparently a lot was selling out today, and the waiter had to double check to make sure they had some available to be sold.  Anyhow, aside from the super awesome mug, the appetizer dish with wings, potato skin wedges, celery, mozzarella sticks and a side of pot stickers was fairly delicious. We also got a full stack of ribs to go along side fries and an upgraded mac n'cheese. All combined together as a very fulfilling yet also pricey meal. My boyfriend got a Poppin' Boba drink (a twist on the classic bubble tea that you can find at most boba shops) and said it was way too sweet, so at $3.99 a piece, I'd say to pass on this one.  Also, it is wayyyyy too cold at this store, I know it's summertime and it was fairly warm out, but I would appreciate if the AC could be turned down a little. It makes it hard to drink cold drinks and feel like it's freezing.  Otherwise, decent meal and I was quite satisfied. I don't usually come to TGIF on a Friday cause I assume it to be busy. I know last time, we had to wait quite some time to get seated, but there was plenty of empty seats today. Shout out to the nice hostess that opens and holds door for people coming in and out! TGIF!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Aimee T.,"Sussex, WI",61,211,54,5.0,11/28/2017,Briana is the best waitress in the literal world!  She needs a raise for putting up with all these drunk people after the badger game.  She was fast and helpful and super nice!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Jeff D.,"Sun Prairie, WI",0,7,21,4.0,7/30/2016,"The service here is always prompt and friendly. We were greeted at the door and sat in the bar area. Nice big booth with a hard seat cushion. A bit drafty because the fans were on high so we got a little cold. The appetizer came quick along with our beverages. I had a NY strip with Jack Daniels sauce. It was prepared as ordered except I wanted the sauce on the side. Good thing for the cook I liked it. My companion had the grilled salmon with lobster sauce. She liked it very much. Thank you Rebecca and TGIs, we enjoyed our dining experiences very much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Lonnie M.,"Monona, WI",10,87,92,4.0,8/21/2015,Went for lunch. Had the chicken skewers. Really good  spicy but not too. Partner had shrimp  very good he said and he's a complainer!  Server pleasant and efficient. No complaints,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Jennifer S.,"Sun Prairie, WI",93,4,1,1.0,7/10/2016,My mahi mahi was completely burnt. The server neglected to visit our table until everyone had completed their food. That was the only time. We were left with empty drinks and food that I would have requested been taken back. There was a child screaming at the next table for a solid hour and also would have requested to be moved since the family wasn't going to do anything about it. Nobody in the restaurant apologized or offered to reseat us. I enjoy this location a lot but will not be coming back anymore. Once the food was eaten it took 30 minutes for our server to come and give us our check. I understand this isn't a 5-star restaurant but this is ridiculous. A Sunday a 2pm when the place is 3/4 empty? Ridiculous.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Amelia B.,"Windsor, WI",34,2,,5.0,6/20/2016,Tanesha is the best bartender around she's very nice and easy to talk to! She's constantly smiling and is very good at what she does! I definitely come here just for her!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Eric G.,"Madison, WI",0,24,,2.0,2/25/2017,Endless appetizers every time... And for the third time and eight months I've been told that the thermostat is broken that's why they can't heat up the restaurant.  I don't understand why management will put that kind of burden on their staff who was also complaining that they were cold... I don't think that will be back in fact we talked about not coming back while we were there this time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
David H.,"Sun Prairie, WI",19,481,270,4.0,12/12/2015,"Ive had a variety of levels of service here. A few times service was so slow or no existent that I sat at the table and had no service and left along with other tables around me. That being said, ever since I brought it up with management it has improved. The last few visits went so smoothly, nice food and everyone was quick, efficient and I didn't even think if leaving at anytime. In addition, the manager was apologetic for the service issues and encouraged me to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Angel C.,"Sun Prairie, WI",19,1,,1.0,10/17/2016,"Service here is horrible. I have tried this place multiple times, just in case of an off night. The severs never check to see how things are or if any reflills are needed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Mica H.,"Warren, IL",20,104,59,3.0,8/31/2015,"Bottomless boneless buffalo wings for $10... That's a great deal, but the meat is not that great... The food is good, as can be expected from a national chain. I wish Friday's would get away from Jack Daniels sauce.  Jack Daniels is ok for a bar, but STOP putting it on everything.  It's seriously horrible on everything.  Please stop! That being said, I'll come back...  But it won't be my first choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Elizabeth R.,"Madison, WI",289,541,118,3.0,7/17/2014,"TGI Friday's is not a place you go expecting gourmet food. However, I was pleasantly surprised by my lunch the other day. I tried the 2 for $12. It came with a FULL appetizer and entree. Wow. I think, hmmm, how can they make money off of this. Nevertheless, it is comfortable and a great place to grab an easy meal with a friend. I had the mozzarella sticks and the chicken with angel hair pasta. The sauce was balsamic based with fresh chopped herbs and tomatoes. The food was filling and a great comfort meal.  I had one of their specialty iced teas and was not overly impressed by it. I do like their drink specials and they have something different to take advantage of each day. Overall, for a chain place, this place is pretty decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Dr. J C.,"Merida, Mexico",24,78,114,2.0,12/19/2014,"Look - My wife likes this place so I go there now and again just to make her happy. I know it violates the bro code, but I have to sleep with her. Me personally, I could care less about Jack Daniels sauce (which is basically reconstituted dried onion and molasses with some other 'secret' ingredients. Too costly for what you get. 2 thumbs down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Ashleigh C.,"Satsuma, AL",60,106,113,5.0,4/15/2015,I was there last night for dinner while on a trip. The fried green beans were as good as back home and my steak was cooked just as ordered for the sizzling steak and spinach. Bartender suggested a great local beer called spotted cow and gave me a few tips on spots to ck out. Great service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Matthew B.,"Lansing, MI",50,34,6,1.0,3/18/2016,"Drinks way over priced!    BWW and Hooters captains are 3 dollars right now during the games, this place is $5.99.   No wonder there is nobody here watching the games and the other places are full.  I know times are tough, but good god.   Do some market research and at least make an effort to compete.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Pauline J.,"Madison, WI",42,210,100,3.0,7/16/2014,"They're not bad. The steaks are pretty good. The staff is usually good. I've had a few problems, but not enough to hate the place. Just enough to come less frequently. I love their appetizers. The drinks are usually over priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Bill S.,"Madison, WI",5,17,,4.0,11/13/2014,"Started going here in college with my roommates when they had $5 burger Tuesdays.  Yeah its a chain but they seem to do it right. Menu has the standard fare,  with noticeable twists. They recently changed the recipes for some of their apps,  not for the better in my opinion,  but the green beean fries are my favorite.  Waiters are generally really good, and their stripes card gets you free chips and salsa,  as well as points for free food and desserts.  Vanilla bean cheesecake is a wonderful way to end your tgif dining!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Carol S.,"Madison, WI",1,27,,2.0,5/7/2015,"Good heavens, why are you thinking of eating here? Overpriced and over processed  . Waitress suggested lemonade, perhaps a raspberry one. Imagine my surprise when it appeared I was served a melted blue snow cone with two maraschino cherries. And I'm not twelve. I tried the lunch special of cesear salad/shrimp entree. Portion was fine for the price, but was the salad ever bland. At least the lettuce was fresh. Paul Newman's dressing is better. Three tiny croutons on top and flavorless cheese. Meh. Shrimp seemed to have heavy flour breading  with pepper and cayenne to disguise the flour taste. I won't be going back. You want to go chain, at least go to one with better food or better pricing. Service was fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Dominique B.,"Wisconsin Dells, WI",0,3,,4.0,11/17/2014,"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but the food was good and our server, Russ, really made our experience a great one. He was super attentive and went out of his way to make sure we were happy. Wonderful way to end a girls night with my daughters. Thank you Russ!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Lizzy M.,"Sun Prairie, WI",0,4,,4.0,6/4/2015,"My boyfriend and I went on a Wednesday night, there was no wait and our waiter was awesome! There were $5 apps and $5 drink specials. We ordered the wings which were great and I ordered the orange cooler drink and my boyfriend ordered the blueberry Long Island. My drink was way too sweet so we ended up switching drinks. Food- I order the chicken and shrimp and he ordered the ribs and steak. The food was good for the price but was not mouthwatering.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
William C.,"Cross Plains, WI",0,3,,2.0,2/4/2016,Poor quality steak and ribs (the meat was tough and the flavor was blah).  The service was okay and my drinks were kept filled.  The sides were not good at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2
Aliesha K.,"Madison, WI",3,4,2,1.0,7/28/2014,Horrible food no flavor I went with my boyfriend he had gotten the boneless buffalo chicken wings and I got the shrimp and chicken pasta and we shared the Mac and cheese appetizer bites he had a couple of bites of my food and on the way home I started feeling sick when we got home he felt the same way and turns out he's got food poising I wouldn't go here again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2?start=20
Corey K.,"Waunakee, WI",12,22,12,4.0,5/4/2014,I only like this TGIFriday's.  Their service is very good.  I have never had to wait more then 10 minutes to get a table.  The food there is very good.  Always consistent.  I always usually order their House Sirloin-10oz.  It is always juicy and flavorful.  They always keep sodas and other drinks full and their manager always checks on you to make sure that your experience is a good one.  Keep up the good work!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2?start=20
Nina O.,"McFarland, WI",61,172,4,3.0,8/11/2013,"The Korean tacos are not half bad, and the kid really likes the burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2?start=20
Alison K.,"Sun Prairie, WI",0,3,,2.0,4/1/2015,"Extremely slow drink service. Each drink took about 10 minutes to get to the table. Food was just okay and after all the waiting and poor service we were given a bill of 64 dollars for one app and 4 drinks. My double skky mixer was 12 dollars. Aka a full price single simply doubled, which, as a bartender I can tell you makes no sense. After expressing our concerns, the manager came over and was nothing but confrontational saying that was just the policy and too bad. I said okay that's fine just run my card and he continued to explain things away when I clearly had no further desire to talk to him. Pretty brutal experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2?start=20
Rikky S.,"Sauk City, WI",0,8,,3.0,3/14/2015,"We stopped in for lunch today with my grandchildren,  aged 4 and 1. We asked for a booth and a high chair and booster chair. After being seated at a booth and given menus,  we were informed that we couldn't have a high chair because it would impede the walkway. We were moved to a table with narrow wooden chairs. We expressed concern about using a booster chair since there was no way to secure it. The hostess basically shrugged and walked away. My granddaughter ended up sitting on her knees at the table. I will say that the food was great as always. As we were leaving, I spoke to the manager and expressed my concern and disappointment about the seating. Her response was that 'lots of people sit their children at booster chairs at the tables.' I really don't care what other people do.  I don't want my grandchildren falling off a chair at booster seat height. And I would like to see a little more concern than just a shrug.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2?start=20
Ian E.,"Madison, WI",2,9,,3.0,1/15/2013,"I stayed away from this chain for years, but after a business trip forced me into their doors multiple nights, I gave my home location another chance. The food is predictable but getting more adventurous over the years, and the korean tacos are pretty exotic. I try not to eat here without looking at the nutritional information in advance; the one time I didn't, I ate half an appetizer (loaded baked potatoes) and a salad and found out that was 2100 calories. There were also pretty substantial delays in service. My other half dozen visits have had excellent service and well prepared food. Maybe the staff wasn't at its best because they were here on New Year's Eve? Though I seldom use it, they have a very nice drink list, especially if you're a fan of tequila. It's also one of the few restaurants I know that offers reward points for eating there. All in all, I choose to go here for a standard night out with people who can't agree on what they want to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison-2?start=20
