Amanda C.,"Dickinson, TX",6,56,9,5.0,1/6/2018,"I don't know why there are so many negative reviews on this restaurant. I got some of the best service; the drinks came out quick, the food was fast, the waiter was very patient with me as I didn't know what I wanted to order right away and he was comical as well. I didn't see anything that caught my eye as being dirty or unkept. I would say this is probably one of the best TGIFridays I have been too and I am from out of state.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison
Claudia G.,"Miami, FL",240,8,,1.0,11/29/2017,The prices for the drinks here an unbelievable. I had 2 drinks with my boyfriend and two appetizers and without tip the check was 80$. I could of gone out to eat a top notch steak with drinks else where with that amount money. They charged the drinks incorrectly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison
Jim D.,"Temecula, CA",236,118,948,2.0,2/13/2017,"Server / Bartender was prompt and friendly young lady. (Marcie).  Always a concern when a restaurant is near empty at 6pm.  The smell is a serious issue.  There's an undeniable smell of vomit in the place.  Could be why the place was empty. TGI's used to be the place to go. Looks like the clock is ticking on them now.  Sad to see but they're on life support. Let's hope management figures it out.  Been a while since I've been in one, wanted to make another pass at one I've never been in.  Safe to say my best trips with them are in the rear view mirror.   I left after one drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison
Baylor F.,"Gilbert, AZ",177,5,,1.0,11/4/2017,"If it weren't for my server (Ryan), this would've been the worst experience ever. Please read the other negative reviews. They're very accurate. I waited 20 minutes for my beer, and another 40 minutes for my food, with no apology. The food was good, but the timeliness was absolutely awful. At most restaurants, the manager comes by to ask how everything was. Not this one. Must be because they know the service is awful. I went here twice, thinking the first time was a fluke. It wasn't. Do not go here, spend your money elsewhere. If you do choose to go here, ask for Ryan. He's a rockstar working in a terrible restaurant. Offer him a job if you own a business. He doesn't belong there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison
Haha J.,"Goodlettsville, TN",3,11,1,1.0,11/9/2017,"I mean, when your being dragged to Friday's with your annoying aunt or that one coworker that gets to choose where the group eats today, nobody is gonna be Thanking God for it. There slogan has truly ruined Friday for me, i now find myself thanking God for every day that I don't end up choking down some watery spaghetti or a bland AF burger at TGI Friday's. It's like they strive to be average, nothing is good. Not even a tad above pure mediocre. And there decor looks like the stuff Cracker Barrel rejected when sorting through what to put on there walls. The best thing that has happened to me at Friday's is when a co-worker had a spasm and launched some food off his fork and onto a picture on the wall. I just kinda rubbed the macaroni and cheese in to where you could really tell that it's there. But I'm sure whoever is misfortunate enough to sit next the to painting now will know it's there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison
Justin M.,"Madison, TN",15,36,3,3.0,2/27/2017,Hey again yelpers! So I went here yesterday and I gotta say I'm a little surprised at the service we received. I suppose I'll get straight to the point. It was around noon and normally that's a bad time to go for lunch as it's super busy but in this case it wasn't really. We had to wait about 10 - 15mins for a table which was okay at the time because it seemed lie they were short-staffed. Once we were seated our server was like she wasn't there. She seemed incredibly distracted and it made me feel like we were more of a burden than anything else. At least two tables (could be three) got their food before us even though we were seated before both of them (I kept track). Once we got our food the waitress checked back once about 30mins into our meal and then disappeared again until we were done. Now I've not served in a long time but that doesn't seem very attentive to me. Now the food: I got the Bacon Cheeseburger and fries and (while it wasn't super hot like it came straight off the grill like I like) it was still one of the best burgers I'd had. My girlfriend got the Fish and Chips and she said it tasted like Captain Gordon's frozen fish filets you'd buy at your local grocer. Well I think that about wraps it up. I'd be willing to go here again just in case today was an off day. Happy yelping! Gaspydandrum,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison

Janell C.,"Placentia, CA",0,8,14,1.0,12/6/2016,This is the WORST tgif ever!!!!!!!!!!!!! It smells funny in here! Our waiter took our order on a napkin. And crumbled it up as he walked away. And instead of getting our drinks he sat down at the booth next to us and started laughing and messing around with the customer. The entire time the manager is walking around like this is a normal thing around here. I didn't believe my husband when he told me the last time he was here they brought out his mashed potatoes as he was leaving.  OMG as i am writing this review and waiting for my dinner 25 minutes i see the female bartender been carried by our waiter on his back across the restaurant and the manager is laughing about it.  THIS PLACE IS A JOKE.  They only get one star cuz the food is good!!!!!!!! Service  Cleanliness  Scent  Food,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison
Miracle25 M.,"Scottsville, KY",0,7,1,1.0,8/29/2017,"The endless apps went up in price and lower in quality and quantity.  Pathetic!  Went Saturday 8/26 at 11:15.  They weren't busy.  Food was half covered with toppings, flat bread stale.  So disappointed.  And the bar area really stunk of stale alcohol, had to walk past to get to bathrooms.

Michael W.,"Gallatin, TN",2,1,1,1.0,4/5/2017,"Just walked out of this place, and upon my arrival I did NOT see ANY employee, management or otherwise!. I sat down at the bar, and you guessed it....NO bartender in sight!! So AFTER my TEN MINUTES solo time at the bar I removed myself from what should be a soon to be torn down building, to make room for a restaurant that actually WANTS customers!....my verdict...BYPASS this place and go to nearby Olive Garden or Logan's !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison
Tangi R.,"Hendersonville, TN",17,22,4,1.0,10/1/2017,"I have eaten at this particular location 4 times... Three times have been horrible. Why do I go back? I keep hoping it will be better. It isn't. Tonight I had dinner here and ask for the endless apps only to learn they are now only offering three items, none of which was very appealing to me. So I ordered the classic appetizer platter. The waitress informs me that it's a to-go item only. As I looked over the menu there was nothing else I wanted so I said I won't have anything, thank you. She then allowed me to order the platter. My son ordered a chicken sandwich. After being told by the waitress twice that are meals were almost ready... Nothing ever came to the table. As the manager walked by, I asked her to please check our orders & she stated they were working on them and that's why the platters were to go items only: because they took time to prepare. Okay, fine. Finally 45 minutes later, the manager brings my son's sandwich to the table so he can at least begin to eat. Great, we'll eat in shifts. It was not the right sandwich or it was not as the picture on the menu indicated. When my son brought this to the manager's attention she informed him that was the only chicken sandwich they had. Okay fine again. He ate the sandwich. Finally my appetizer platter is brought to the table. What an over-exaggeration of packaging! The manager brings out a to-go carton/ serving dish that would have been appropriate for a large picnic! Inside this container, which I was afraid was filled with a ridiculous amount of food... it was not. Inside the container consisted of 3 pot stickers, three mozzarella sticks, 4 potato skins and boneless buffalo wings. The packaging took up half of the table, and I am not kidding. It was ridiculous! Obviously, I was hungry by then,especially after waiting for over 45 minutes for my meal.I began to sample the items. The potstickers were extremely hot and delicious although there was no sauce for them... What do you expect though? And can you believe after waiting for more than 45 minutes, like I said, the buffalo wings were ice cold! If you want to piss someone off... Make them wait damn near an hour for their food and then serve it cold! I am so tired of getting shitty service and food that is subpar and everyone standing around waiting on a tip! The manager asked how we heard about the appetizer platter, did we see it on the menu or were we sent an email, because the company was going to really start pushing this platter. I remarked that if they were going to start pushing the platter then they needed to be able to get it out faster than they got mine out. She very defensively stated that they were not prepared for my order. One question comes to mind, ""if it's on the menu should you not be prepared to make it""? I guess not. I then told her the potstickers were delicious however the buffalo wings were ice cold. She remarked with a very flip attitude, ""sorry"". Yeah me too... I don't think I'll be going back at this point. Three crappy experiences out of four pretty much tells me you've got a consistent issue with service and quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison
Billy B.,"Mt Airy, NC",0,24,7,1.0,5/9/2017,"ZERO STARS!!!  We went here last night after doing some business, it was about 8 pm only 5 other tables in the place occupied. I should have turned around and left when being shown to our table my feet began sticking to the floor. There were several waitstaff available so this seemed unnecessary.  We sat down and finally ""faineant"" (our waitress) came to the table and asked if we wanted drinks we told her we were ready to order.  She made sort of a face like ""why are these people rushing me?""  We placed our order and she left.  We ordered appetizers.  We waited...  And waited...  And waited....  Finally got our drinks. WRONG. She couldn't get that right. I caught her attention several minutes later and told her it was wrong she took it back and came back with another glass. We still hadn't gotten appetizers.  She comes with a bowl of French onion soup with some cheesy ass plastic spoon in it!  REALLY??  really??   Have you ever tried to eat French onion soup with a plastic spoon?!?!?  Call me an elitist , call me a snob, and I know TGIFridays isn't ""The Palm"" or even ""Ruth's Chris Steak house"" but C'mon.   All the while two other waitresses were gadding about, one we nicknamed ""the shuffler"" (she refused to pick up her feet) and another we nicknamed the ""moth"". (She was rarely seen but very fast and flirty when she was) Try to make note that we had time to give nick names to the other waitresses that we sat there long enough to find cute little characteristics about each one.  Getting back to the appetizers. The second was spinach and cheese with chips. Stale chips and the cheese was not even melted it was like you were supposed to spread it with a knife. We left it on the plate.  Sitting around our drinks were now empty. ""Faineant"" was no where to be seen we were now into 35 minutes.  I tried to get ""moth's"" attention but man she was fast. There were now only 4 other tables occupied.  Our food comes via someone not our waitress and my spouse asks ""do you have any horseradish ?""  ""No."" Was the answer and POOF she was gone.  Still no drink refills.  I finally got up and walked around the service area and got some water for my spouse.   The side I was given was rice but they over microwaved it and UGH it was terrible. Have you ever had rice that was cooked but still crunchy?  Yuck.  I got up and got some more water. We tried to get ""shuffler's"" attention but she had other plans. We sat wanting other items but still no waitress. We saw ""Faineant"" several times at the front of the restaurant talking to another couple at a table and remarked to each other how did she get past us ?  Discovering later she had been going behind us in a partitioned section. WHOOPS there she went again.  A different person, we assume cook staff, brought plates to another table and ""shuffler"" passed by complaining she got stiffed on a tip. There ""Faineant "" was back at the front table.  ""How'd she do that?""  Here goes the same person hustling from the back bringing more dishes out.  I called out to him and asked him for our ticket and a box (we discussed taking the cheese dip home and using our own chips- we ended up tossing it).  He VERY POLITELY  said he could bring a box but would have to find our waitress.  I made the comment that we wouldn't have stopped him if we could have gotten her. That she was again back at her friends table, chatting.   He told her and we sat and watched her PRINT OUR TICKET OUT THEN WALK BACK TO HER FRIENDS TABLE CHATTING WITH THEM with our ticket in hand.   Here's a little secret - I am deaf and I read her lips and what she said cost her her tip.  She finally brought our ticket and walked away.  We were in the restaurant from 7:47 pm until 9:09 pm. That is unacceptable for this quality of swill.  My son text me when we arrived at the restaurant and I looked at the time stamp then looked to see when I called him back while leaving the parking lot.  All we had was large bills when our tab for 50$+ arrived. ""Faineant"" said it would be 3 minutes before she could get change.  That's ok we'll wait.  Nope.  Not going back here.  Don't go.  Don't even try.  The only people who go to this TGIFridays are people like us, who are passing through or friends of the waitstaff who could care less about the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison

The restaurant overall was dirty and smelly like the floors had been mopped with dirty week old mop water. The other servers i observed seemed completely apathetic about serving with a smile.

Dunja M.,"Blackwell, OK",23,9,6,2.0,4/1/2017,"I'm only giving this 2 stars because it was at least food, but this is not a good place to go. We went there for lunch on Saturday, remembering TGIF from our younger days and found that this place is way overpriced and the food was plain and simple meh. My onion soup was luke warm, the crostini on top was soaky bread with cheese on top. It tasted like weak campbells, nasty. My husbands clubsandwich was plain looking and the smoked Gouda cheese by far overpowered the sandwich that consisted mainly of a bland, pale roll. Chicken quesadilla was ok and a kids meal with Mac was edible. We really kicked ourselves hard for going here, having been lured in by the updated exterior, but finding a run-down interior with stinky smell, dirty fixtures and a dark dirty ceiling. Some of the servers looked ungroomed and nobody was truly friendly. Yeah, bad choice for us, never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison

Karen B.,"Ashland City, TN",0,14,,3.0,6/15/2017,"Had lunch here last week with friends from high school. We try to get together every now and then to catch up so we like a place were we can sit and visit for a couple of hours without being ran out. And we tell the waitress that upfront.  Anywhoo, Most of us arrived at the same time (1:00) and was seated right away The waitress was very friendly and asked if we wanted to wait for the rest of our party. We did. After about 20 minutes we decided the rest of our party had stood us up so the waitress took our orders. There were 6 of us  I thought it took a little long to get our food out but we were having fun talking so that really didn't matter. Our food was brought out by some guy we hadn't seen. Don't know where our waitress was at that time. Only one order was wrong.. The lady had ordered a bacon cheeseburger without a bun but with a lettuce wrap instead. She was brought a burger with cheese on a plate. I thought it was kind of funny myself. She told the waitress when she finally came back around that the only thing she didn't want on her bacon cheeseburger was the bun and could she please bring her some bacon and lettuce.  That was taken care of quickly. Our bills were brought out and we noticed that a gratuity had been added. They called it something else on the ticket but still a gratuity. I know restaurants usually add one to the bills if there are 8 or more people. But 6? Really. The sad thing is I would have given more but I don't like not given a choice. So from me she got the $1.89 that was added.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison

Gary H.,"Princeton, NJ",30,48,54,1.0,6/15/2014,"I wish I had read the reviews before coming here!!! First off, the hostess and host didn't seem to know what they were doing when we walked in the door. When the host finally figured out he needed to look at his clipboard to see what tables were available he said it would be 10 or 15 minutes, even though we could see MULTIPLE open tables. I asked ""why"" since the tables were open and he said they needed to be cleaned. I said, forgot it we will war in the bar since it's open seating. Finally the bar keeper came over and took our drink order. A waiter kept running back and forth and choosing who he was going to wait on, never mind that the (2 different tables) came in AFTER we did. The same bar keeper finally came back and took our order. The appetizer arrived and we still did not have silverware. We had the boneless buffalo wings which were actually good. I ordered the Pecan Crusted Chicken salad for my meal which was decent. In a few words THE SERVICE HERE IS TERRIBLE!!! The only reason I have 1 star is because the food was pretty good overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison?start=20
Confesor R.,"Clarksville, TN",0,5,,1.0,7/28/2014,"Went for the first time to TGI with the family and I have to say this has been the worst experience ever, We waited for over 10 minutes to be seated out waitress was ok but the food was horrible over cooked and the flavor was horrible I mean disgusting the bread felt old to taste needless to say we would never be visiting this reataurant again. Hope this could save someone's pocket and time, Good luck",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison?start=20
Robby M.,"Pleasant View, TN",1,13,2,3.0,2/8/2014,"This used to be one of my favorite places to eat, but times have changed, I ordered steak and half rack of ribs, ribs were awesome, steak not so much, my steak was almost cold, warm at best and on top of that it was tough to even cut, I'm easy to please when it comes to food, but this was unacceptable, service was just ok. My girls dinner was the same way, she got the same thing. First time she ate there, she was disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison?start=20

Brady B.,"Lake Havasu City, AZ",22,147,,3.0,10/2/2014,"The only reason that I don't give one star is due to the freak winter storm that rolled through the night before so the management thought it would be dead for a 2nd night and told half of the staff to stay home.  Wrong.  They were slammed.  We got our drink/appetizer orders taken quickly but waited almost 30 minutes and only received 2/3 drinks.  The 3rd drink came with our apps (another 20 minutes which meant that it took 40 minutes to get our apps)  upon which we ordered another 3 drinks since we felt that it could take an hour to receive our 2nd round of drinks. Much later (over an hour since ordering) our meals came.  It was typical of any franchise like Red Robin or Applebee's.  My burger was fair.  Nothing special about the flavor which is probably a good thing for chain restaurants.  It was only warm when I received it so it probably sat for awhile before I received it. Our waitress was awesome as she was slammed to the gills with tables.  I imagine that she would be wonderful to have serving you if they had enough staff.  After we complained due to wait time, the manager explained why they were so slow to serve that night and gave us all free deserts and knocked a little off of our bill which made up for a little bit of wait time.  I'll try this location again if/when we come to Nashville for another trade show.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison?start=40
Elizabeth N.,"Nashville, TN",5,9,,1.0,11/12/2012,"I wish I could give this place less than one star. We aren't familiar with this side of town, so we stopped in yesterday for lunch thinking it would be reliably mediocre, but fast.  The service was so bad, we didn't leave a tip. And that's from two people who waited tables and managed restaurants for several years. Our server was slow and  inattentive to the point it seemed intentional. We almost had to jump out of the seat to get his attention just so we could find out if our food was ever coming. At one point my husband remarked that it felt like we were being held hostage. No food, no service, can't leave without paying. The food was terrible, but that's to be expected at a chain restaurant. Simply awful. Avoid this place at all costs. There are literally 10 other chain restaurants within a quarter mile. Pick any one of those.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison?start=40
Laura L.,"Hendersonville, TN",21,29,,2.0,6/14/2013,"You'd think a 2:30 lunch would render better food and service, you would think. We sat at a table at the bar, the service was decent. The bartender was polite and friendly but did move at a snails pace. But the food. Meh. We remembered pretty quick why we don't eat here and would not have if we didn't have a gift card. The Korean beef tacos were inconsistent. There was about 2 oz. of meat TOTAL! and cucumbers on only one of the three tacos. It was mostly lettuce and sauce and the rice was HORRIBLE so I asked for sweet potato fries. They were really good but a tad too salty. My husband, Dude, ordered one of their burgers, can't remember which and I had a bite and it was forgettable. There is more but I think you get the idea. Stay away. Not that great but I didn't feel like I was going to get a disease. I guess that's good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison?start=40
Laila S.,"Portland, OR",83,161,202,4.0,10/22/2012,"This is one of my favorite chain restaurants when you are not in the mood to really explore.  We went last Friday (fitting) and although there were ppl waiting for a table, the bar was almost empty so we sat there for dinner. (I never understood why ppl hate sitting at the bar to dine, I love it!) First off, we got our drinks asap and since we are sitting right there, I felt we got special attention to our drinks. (I had the Bee Sting and if you like bourbon, this is the drink for you) I went with the bartender's favorite pick (Cajun Pasta) that choice would have never even crossed my mind as something to order, but it was Friday, it was a long week and I didn't care to make choices. It was actually pretty good, chicken and shrimp, with heat but not too much to blow me out of the water. My friend had the flat steak, which she said was one of the best steaks she's had in awhile. We had a very nice time, relaxing and fun with non stop chatting. We were in and out in about an hour. Yay!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison?start=40
Christy L.,"Franklin, TN",4,12,6,2.0,2/7/2011,"Decent experiance. I ordered a southwest salad asking only for them to leave one thing off, but when I got it they had left off several things.

Bryce B.,"Gallatin, TN",0,5,,1.0,9/1/2014,Terrible service. Dirty silverware. Of the three meals two were cold and one didn't even make it to the table because they burned it and had to make another.

Eric B.,"Dallas, TX",130,87,28,4.0,12/5/2011,Well this place has gone through some major management and staff changes over the past year and a half or so. The current crew is back to the old standards which were high and are again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison?start=40
John M.,"Goodlettsville, TN",0,20,,2.0,12/7/2014,"Ate here over a year ago and swore this location off because of dirty restaurant and horrible service.  We like Friday's and routinely eat at other locations.  Well, we were in the area today and we decided to give this location a second chance.  We were seated quickly but the restaurant still has a dirty feel to it, which was supported both times by the clientele.  Anyway, we ordered and the server didn't write down our orders (either lazy or showing off).  Seemed like we waited forever to get our food but we were hungry so may not have been that long.  Anyway, when the food came my 4 year old's order was completely wrong.  I just wish they would swallow their pride and write the order down.  They were quick to get the correct order out and they let us keep the wrong order, which was nice but I still would rather have what we ordered the first time.  Maybe we'll give it another shot in a year or so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison?start=40
Richard S.,"Nashville, TN",0,9,,1.0,3/29/2010,"I was at this restaurant the day before they received the lowest Health Department score in years! I was so bothered that I sent an e-mail to their customer service section on their website. Not an answer or response. I then wrote the President in Carrollton, TX asking what was being done about it. NOTHING... Not even a courtesy telephone call from his office or the local district manager. IF YOU WANT TO EAT AT A FILTHY RESTAURANT... THIS IS THE ONE! I WOULD NOT EAT AT ANY MIDDLE TENNESSEE FRIDAY'S!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison?start=40
Jimbo R.,"Scottsville, KY",1,26,,1.0,2/6/2012,"I have been to this place several times,and each time I was a tad depressed when I left. Reason for my ""depression"" is that for the money,I felt badly abused. All the other restaurant parking lots in the area are maxed out and the only reason for doing Fridays is because we are starving and they have plenty of parking. They ALWAYS have plenty of parking. Must be a message in this somewhere ? I avoid Fridays now,always. I would just as soon starve!!! Well,go hungry a little longer. Food is unremarkable and radically overpriced. And,they charge for freakin' bread!!! If you want bread,not talkin' some kinda special bread, they add it to the bill.The cheese sticks had no cheese in 'em,just air. Talked to the manager about this (and the lack of bread) and she was nonchalant about my complaints and offered no compromise. Only place I have been to that charges for bread.Ain't going back...........",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madison?start=40
