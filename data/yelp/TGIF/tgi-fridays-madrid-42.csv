Torterry C.,"Berlin, Germany",86,572,2340,4.0,5/12/2017,"I first saw TGI Friday back when I was traveling in USA. But at that time, I didn't managed it a try. So when my hubby asked me if I wound like to go there for lunch. I was like, why not.   We walked from the near by metro station to this place. It was quite easy to find, it didn't take us long. We were already there. And the staff was just leading us to the available seats and gave us the menu. After a short moment. I decided to go for spare ribs and my hubby pick the burger. I was a bit worried if that was too much for just a lunch, since we were still planing to travel some other places after. So I only ordered just half portion. l Also we order some soft drinks, they were free to refill. A moment later, our meal were already there. Wow, the ribs looked good. And I tried it. It tastes good as well. My hubby found his burger was just alright. The half of the dish was already enough for me. Am though I could eat more. Maybe next time.  I also like the design of this place quite a lot. It reminds gave me the feeling back in USA. And the staff were super friendly and helpful. Although it is fast food, but once awhile, I think it would be fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madrid-42
Rebeka L.,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",11,6,3,1.0,5/8/2017,"Went there last night. Burgers are dry!!!! Asked for well done, got medium well! Food arrived within 10 minutes before the drinks! Had to ask for our sangria, which did not taste like sangria. It was more like vodka and fruit syrup. The waitress did not pay attention to us at all, no one asked if everything was ok or even said goodbye. No tip from us. We were very disappointed and our dinner was ruined :( would expect more from American restaurant even if in Madrid!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madrid-42
Desirée V.,"Madrid, Spain",41,23,53,4.0,7/22/2014,"They have happy hour drink prices and 2€ appetizers from 17:00-20:00, which I should mention that not all Madrid TGIFridays offer. It's great when you want a little taste of home (for us American expats).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madrid-42
Jacqueline W.,"San Francisco, CA",157,406,208,2.0,9/20/2012,"My thoughts on TGIFs: - The best thing here was the American football on 3 TV screens.  -My food was cold.  -We asked for straws and they took so long to bring them I went to the bar and got them myself.  -Did I mention my food was COLD?!  -The coca-cola is actually ""American"" meaning not as sweet as coke is typically in Spain and you get free refills.  -The waiter didn't offer us the menu del dia, only the regular menu so I felt a bit cheated as you can get a 3 course meal for the price of one entree on the regular menu.  I'm sure unless another picky eating American friend insists on gong to TGIFs I will never eat here again. Ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madrid-42
Abdulla M.,"Manhattan, NY",1,6,,1.0,10/9/2013,"This is a standard TGIF but with the worst service  in the world, you stay forever to get a waiter who is serving the rest of the restaurant, very bad management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-madrid-42
