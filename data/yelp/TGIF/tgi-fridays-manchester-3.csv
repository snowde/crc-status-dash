Alfie B.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",91,689,682,5.0,3/11/2010,"I've definitely got more to say about TGI Fridays. I love it! The food has been covered, but I would add that the fajitas and burgers are literally to die for. The fajitas come on a sizzling tower plate thing which is aesthetically pleasing as well as satisfying for the taste buds. Although you can expect to spend over ten quid per main meal, the quality and size of the food more than makes up for it. The main thing about TGI Fridays though has got to be the drinks. This applies whether you are an alcoholic or not! The cocktails are unbelievable, as all the staff ate trained in how to make them perfectly. The Daquiris I particularly recommend. I know it's a boring cocktail usually and I like ones where you can actually taste the alcohol, but once I tried one at TGIs I completely changed my position. For the non-alcohol consumers the drinks are also the main point about TGIs! The milkshakes are the best I have ever had anywhere bar none! Try the chocolate malt milkshake. If you are no satisfied let me know and I will drink 10 in 10 minutes to compensate in entertainment value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-3
Sarah-Anne M.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",48,293,260,4.0,12/5/2009,"I love TGI Fridays for lots of reasons but most of all I love the drinks. I'm not an alcoholic, they just make really good cocktails! The staff here will make anything you like and will also recommend things to you so you'll end up finding new things you like! The food here is good too but I find that the food at the Trafford Centre is better but the drinks service at Sale is more relaxing because the bar isn't as crowded and it's over 21's only (at the bar, kids are still welcome in the restaurant).  It's a great location, just off the motorway but it does usually mean someone has to drive unless you want to pay for a taxi, bad times for the driver but the milkshakes and smoothies are good too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-3
Emma Louise M.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",1163,1367,1579,3.0,12/26/2011,"Ah, what to say of TGI's. It's one of those leave-your-gourmet-brain-at-the-door places - this is simple, yum American junk food. I'll admit that I'm easily pleased, especially when I'm hungry, and a plate of refried beans atop a bed of nachos covered in salsa, guacamole and cheese is enough to have me rubbing my tum, not to mention mozzarella sticks and the actual main course. Yeah, we forget about that when we're ordering the so-called 'appetisers'. This place is so indulgent they even batter their chicken in Jack Daniels. Heck, they slather everything in the stuff. Salmon, ribs... it's a wonder we don't all stumble out vomiting. Wait... Ahem, anyway, rather like Hard Rock and Henry J Beans, the vegetarians are left a little out in the cold here. If it ain't shrimp, steak, chicken or salmon, you might be disappointed. There's one option on the sandwich menu that doesn't look half bad, well, I can testify it's lovely, but you might want more choice. Fajita or quesadilla? If you've room for dessert this is the place to come, because it's a gooey calorie fest of pure heaven. Cinnamon swirl cheesecake with sticky caramel sauce? Dirt cake with chocolate mousse, marshmallows, clotted cream and Oreo cookies? Warm apple waffle crunch with vanilla ice cream, cinnamon-spiced apple, oatmeal crumble and caramel sauce? No? What about three layers of moist chocolate cake with fudge and chocolate filling and vanilla ice cream? Are you drooling yet? It may not be healthy, it may not be classy, but at the time I went to TGI's, it felt novelty. Long may it live for those ridiculous cravings we all have that only terribly bad but insanely tasty food can satisfy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-3
