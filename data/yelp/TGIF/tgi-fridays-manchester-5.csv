Scott D.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",136,119,17,4.0,7/10/2013,"Usually we go to TGI Fridays just off Market Street. Rachel served us today, who was really friendly and efficient, as a regular to TGI Customer elsewhere (weekly basis) I have to say that Rachel provided the best service we've experienced in a TGI restaurant so far.  Food was piping hot and was really nice.  I took advantage of a 2 course meal offer that runs Mon-Thurs costing Â£14.99",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-5
Alex B.,"Northern Quarter, Manchester, United Kingdom",98,185,349,3.0,8/26/2014,Eaten once - was ok. It's a typical chain brand. Flame grilled burgers typically pulled pork added at every opportunity . It does shine with it's bar staff and quite frankly I use it as a bar when waiting for people to come off the motorway as a meeting place. I recommend a manhattan :-),https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-5
Sophie C.,United Kingdom,6,360,370,4.0,9/22/2009,"Sex and the City comes to the suburbs - kind of. Everyone knows what TGI's food is like - burgers, the staff sing on your birthday yadda yadda. But have you seen their list of cocktails? Seriously. Its pretty impressive, 500 according to them. I couldn't get enough of my Slush Puppie-esque Strawberry Daiquiri and the bar tender took ages to make a couple of Mojito's for my friends. Surely a good sign?  The atmosphere was good on a busy Friday night with bar flies struggling for room either in the centre or else relegated to the tables outside.. but we didn't mind this layout too much. You can't expect them to change it just because clearly more Mancunians like to spend their money on drinks rather than eating out.  I can't believe they don't have a happy hour though. What? Every hour is happy hour? Fiddlesticks. Not with prices like those. Plus I couldn't find any drinks vouchers online, I hear that you have to join their darned Birthday Club to get to know their Special Offers.  In this area though TGIs is actually still your best bet for cocktails what with the rest of the nightlife consisting of restaurants, Old Man Pubs and the Fairfax. I'm sure I could have whiled away a few more hours on the outside patio.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-5
