Tammy G.,"Glastonbury, CT",9,79,38,3.0,12/29/2017,"We popped in before a movie.  Haven't been here in at least eight years.  We sat in the bar.   The service was great, staff friendly.   I ordered the Brussel sprouts, surprisingly delicious!  My husband had a bbq chicken salad, he said was okay.  What I didn't love was the smell.  There was a weird odor, perhaps an old moldy table towel?  It was persistent throughout our visit.   For me, other than the sprouts, I could pass on going back.   It was very busy, seems popular. One last note, I like that they have the calorie count next to the menu choices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-8
Vicki B.,"Tolland, CT",66,358,1076,2.0,12/2/2017,"Waitress good.  Food: Got the rib and shrimp combo asking for shrimp not to be fried. Got mini sized shrimp with fake butter, like movie popcorn, bath. Subbed Mac and cheese for rice. Upcharge $3 for it: ok but didn't get veggies?  The ribs were basically meatless.  Tried my companion 's potato skins which were floppy and not crisp whatsoever.  Will not go back.

He ordered the 'Endless Apps' which now consist of only six choices and cost $14.99/person.  He started with the mozzarella sticks, and then finished an order of Sesame Jack Chicken Tenders.  Beforehand we'd split the pretzel appetizer order.  The pretzels were great!

Amber J.,"Tolland, CT",12,57,17,4.0,6/24/2017,"Basing my review on this visit we recently had and not any previous.. The menus are big and overwhelming. They need to cut down on pages that open into more pages. I am here to order food, not go on an Easter egg hunt.  The waitress was nice and very attentive to our needs. We requested extra sauce and even though it was not her that brought our food out, I did see her look over to make sure that they had brought out everything we asked for. Our food was cooked correctly. We did bring up the fact that their menu prices keep going up, for that, we did receive a good amount of chicken in our Sesame Jack Strips app.  I am not a fan of those card machines at the tables where you have to do it yourself. I used it and the receipt printed out completely blank so then I had to wait for the waitress to come back and explain the situation and then wait for another receipt.  I am hesitant to go back because the prices are a little much for a place like TGIFridays. The service was good though. The food was average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-8

Nikki S.,"Windsor, CT",0,7,3,1.0,7/30/2017,"I visited this location for Happy Hour on Thursday and let's just say the Bartenders were very standoffish and very slow. The interaction with us was visually different then the interaction they gave to others. When we needed to place additional orders we had to call to them vs them tending to us. The sad part is that it wasn't even busy so I'm not sure why the service was so bad!  Our drinks to my surprise were VERY watered down, however the appetizers were good! We decided to stick to wine ( you can't go wrong with that !). My group gathered outside to chat for a bit once we paid our bill and the Manager was on a cigarette break. Call me crazy but I'm sure he overheard our conversation about the service we received and he didn't utter a word. Shame on him!

Hariel F.,"Newington, CT",0,4,1,3.0,11/20/2016,"The only reason they are getting three stars is because the waitress was absolutely amazing. Besides her I would give them one star proudly, food service was terrible. I come in with a family of 8 and put in our orders before a party of 35 did. So we expected our food to come out pristine and we were sadly mistaken. The steak came out undercooked ordered med/well and it came out med/rare. The Yucatán salad came out with a sprinkle of chicken, and I do literally mean a sprinkle. I asked for more and they brought it out 10mins later and that's when I realize its was cold pulled chicken. So why did it take so long? Now on to the ribs, they were dry but came drenched in BBQ sauce. But yet they were dry, so overcooked. Lastly TOO MUCH CELERY SALT IN THE COLESLAW.

Natasha V.,"Wethersfield, CT",27,12,2,1.0,3/25/2017,Absolutely awful experience. My family go here frequently but we probably will make the trip to a further location from now on. We had a party of only 7 and were told it would be 20 minutes. We found a large table at the lounge at aprox 8:40. We were told after we order appetizers and drinks that we had to move because after 9 people under 18 aren't allowed in the lounge. Mind you we were all over 18 besides my 3 year old daughter. We were told our table would be ready soon but we could stay at the booth and drink our drinks. We didn't receive our drinks for another 15 minutes. We asked the host what was taking so long and were told the booths we could fit at weren't available. By this time we had been there for an hour and a half. We got our drinks and asked for a manager. He told us that even if we had been eating our entrees and it was passed 9 we would have to move. What kind of bullshit is that?? You're saying we would have to move our plates because we have one three year old?!?! You're gonna move us w our plate of food?? Seriously?! Absolutely despicable service and we will be calling the corporate office.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-8
SoulReaper S.,"Hartford, CT",0,6,,2.0,7/5/2017,"Well what happened to Fridays? I recall when the staff are cheerful confident and sure of themselves. Went yesterday (7/4/17) for dinner, it wasn't full restaurant but had plenty of seats. The male host seemed very not wanted to be there. Our server took over 10 minutes to come take the drink and food order. She seemed also unsure of herself and had the looks of not wanting to be there.  I give them credit, kids food came out first. But waited a few more minutes for the adult food. Although we had a minor disputes over what was presented she did fix the order and apologize. The food was mediocre. I recall when the meals where on point and food was scrumptious. Maybe it was the July 4 holiday that gave the workers the blues. Next time just close down for the holiday. The surf and turf menu seems extravagant but when presented was Meh. Large looking lobster tail was the size of a shrimp. The ribeye was ok, nothing to go crazy for. Improvements needed: Make sure host and servers are wearing a smile and cheerful. Or fake it to the customers Servers needs to be sure of her self and speaks with confidence. Don't always resolve a issue by going to get the manager when you can resolve the issue on your own. Lastly clean the bathrooms every hour it was a pigsty and nasty",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-8

Todd Z.,"East Hartford, CT",21,100,193,5.0,1/6/2015,"Wow.... Never thought it would happen A chain restaurant becoming my go to hang out spot. I've gone to this Fridays on average once a week for the last few months. We have a ""Stripes Rewards Account"" where for every dollar we spend we get a point.  The points accrue, and you can use them for different tiered rewards.  Now that tone is set.... Went here last night with the wife. We went with the intention. Of being cheap (new year resolution to save for a house) and use our points. So we told the server we wanted to use our ""one free chicken/seafood meal""... She kindly informed us we ARE allowed to stack the rewards.  Needless to say we both got a free chicken meal (pictures in review) as well as free chips and salsa for being a stripes member. Our bill came out to free.... (Again pictures below in review).  We were not planning on free.. So we bought a scoop of ice cream so we could leave the nice waitress a tip with my card (who carries cash anyway???) So service wise... She was nice enough to educate us on the program, knowing it might reduce her overall bill. And she kept on smiling and brining us new waters without flinching.  The food was delicious.. Not what I went for, but having to pick a chicken dish under the free coupon made me broaden my horizons and try something I normally wouldn't.. And it was great!! Tipped the girl based on what the price WOULD have been and some.. Overall great experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-8
Simone D.,"Glastonbury, CT",36,46,3,1.0,7/7/2015,"I literally had the worst waitress ever tonight. It was almost comical. Didn't introduce herself, so we asked for her name. When questioned about a special they were running, her answer was that she had no clue, then, awkward staring followed. I asked if she could ask and find out what the special was about it. Then she comes back and explains it to us, but, adds that we were the first to ask about it hence her not knowing. If your business is running a promotion, shouldn't that be something you get briefed on as you start your work day? She took our order. Brought our appetizer and drinks. Someone else brought our food. And practically, that was the last we saw of her until we hunted her down for the bill. No how is your food, no refills, no nothing. Good jeezus! We tipped her 10% out of decency but she didn't even deserve that. Spoke to the manager on my way out. Explained what happened and said please, no gift cards because we are never coming back. He thoroughly sympathized. Explained he was newly hired and to please come back and give them a chance. I believe him. Will give it maybe 3 months and see if things have improved.

Jacquelyn F.,"Chapel Hill, NC",23,14,17,3.0,9/4/2015,"Our server was not very pleasant. He seemed bothered when I asked for Parmesan cheese for a pasta dish and it took more than 15 minutes to get our check, etc. It was not very busy when we went, but it seems that others around me noticed the server's negative attitude and overall slowness. Finally, the food was mediocre and a bit pricey.  The one positive is Friday's rewards program. On this particular visit, I was able to get 20% off, which equaled $9 off the original bill.  Overall, I will probably avoid this venue when in the Buckland area. The service almost always seems to be mediocre at best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-8

When we did eventually get our food, my Jack Daniels burger was ice cold and my onion rings were more oily than the Gulf waters by Louisiana.

Adrian W.,"South Glastonbury, CT",218,284,93,3.0,1/21/2009,"As far as chain restaurants go, I know I can rely on a few standard menu items here no matter which Friday's I go to. As I became attached to those menu items at this location, I am leaving my review here.  1. French Onion Soup: It is surprisingly good. Once, when eating alone on a business trip (and extremely bored and lonely), I asked my server about it. Apparently it's actually made with bourbon and homemade beef stock at each location. This explains the depth of flavor. This version has a richness to the stock and well cooked onions with a generous cheese capping. A lot of other places have a much thinner stock and undercooked onions (yuck).  2. Jack Daniel's Sampler (formerly the Jack Daniel's Tower): I am addicted to this thing for some reason. I have craved it in both of my pregnancies. It consists of 6 fried shrimp, a half rack of baby back ribs and a plate of crispy fried chicken breast nuggets (dunked in JD sauce). They are all individually spiced and served with the Jack Daniel's dipping sauce. All I can say is YUMMY, especially if you're looking for a protein overload.  3.  Brownie Obsession: Great dessert if you need a chocolate fix. So rich and gooey, when I've order it for take-out, I get 2 portions out of it.  I am also a big fan of their spinach and artichoke dip. This is hot, bubbly, cheesy and rich in flavor. I've ordered this and the Jack Daniels Sampler for dinner in the past and left very satisfied.  If you can keep in mind that this is a chain you can find quality food items and reasonable prices. I've found that the takeout versions are usually the same size as in the restaurant, and the staff goes out of their way to individually package things to optomize the ride home. I've had the brownie dessert be in about 4 containers to be assembled at home with microwave instructions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-8?start=40

When we finally got our drinks, the server said she would be right back with straws..she didn't  - I had to ask when I caught up with her.  If you are a Stripes Member( which I am), you get free chips & salsa.  She said the chips and salsa would be right out.  We sat and sat - they finally arrived with our appetizers.  1. Crispy Green Bean Fries - overcooked.  2. Pot Stickers - dried out around the edges and they had grill marks- menu says steamed & pan-seared.  No way!! Entrees ordered - 1. Pulled Pork Sandwich with onion strings & Sweet Potato Fries.  2. Fish & Chips. What was served - Pork Sandwich - no way it was pulled pork - diced chunks of pork-looked like it was cut off leftover ribs and sauce was added and the fried onions on top were burnt and soggy with grease.  Fish Sandwich- NO, we ordered Fish & Chips.  So, I sat there with my disappointing sandwich while my husband's correct order of Fish & Chips were being made.  When it came out, the fish was way over-cooked( leaning towards burnt) and swimming in grease.  That went back - we weren't paying for that mess.  A manager did come over and apologize and agreed there was a problem.  He offered to have us pick something else from the menu and he would cook it himself.  We opted out.  We had been there way too long and were quite tired of the disappointments.   He recalculated the bill and gave us two complimentary appetizer/dessert coupons to encourage us to come back.  I think I will look for another T.G.I.

I hadn't visited a TGI Fridays in years, and I must say the quality has improved considerably in the past few years. I have been here twice recently for happy hour. The first time I went here I had an appetizer that was slices of sushi-grade tuna, guacamole, and salsa on these long tortilla strips. It was delicious and unique. The second time I went here I had two margaritas. They were not super strong, but for $6 each they were fresh and tasty. Service here has been great. I also love the décor. The bar is red and black and has a nice upscale vibe. I do wish it was a little cleaner, but oh well. They have happy hour every day of the week, which is great.

William T.,"East Hartford, CT",5,3,,1.0,12/29/2015,"DO NOT WAIST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS RESTAURANT. Went to the Manchester Fridays store near the mall just before Christmas for my daughters Bday party. We were seated right away but the good service (or service of any kind) ended there. We waited 30 minutes and then finally had to get up and ask a waiter to give us a glass of water and take our order. The place was a third full but were told there was a mix up with who was waiting on which table. Finally got a glass of water and ordered, the food took forever and again, the place was only a third full. They forgot part of my order and the cezar salad i ordered was really bad, a McDonald's cezar salad would have been a thousand times better so that gives you an idea how bad it was. I had a 20% off coupon and that's why we went there but would have paid any price to not be there in the end. TGI Fridays was the worst restaurant I went to in 2015 bar none, would give them minus stars if I could.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-8?start=20
Arthur J.,"Willimantic, CT",0,6,,1.0,11/14/2015,My wife and I sat at the bar to eat a meal after doing some shopping.. we found the bar area to be extremely unclean the bar servers use there bare unwashed hands that are constantly being wiped on there dirty pants to touch everything from your limes and lemons to the tops of salt and pepper shakers... just an all around dirty experience..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-8?start=20
Rachel G.,"Vernon, CT",62,2,8,1.0,1/16/2014,"I went here on a Friday night around 11pm. Our server was less than friendly and seemed really curt and impatient. We ordered our drinks and an appetizer. Once our drinks arrived we ordered our meals. After waiting 30 minutes our meals arrived. I asked our waitress about the appetizer and she was very ditzy. She admitted that she forgot to ring it in and that we could ""totally hate her for that.""  My date said it was fine and to bring the appetizer out anyway. After she walked away, I looked at my meal and asked my date, ""Didn't I order mashed potatoes, not broccoli?"" He agreed, but at that point I just said screw it. It was late and we both worked long hours that week. Once the appetizer finally came out my date and I finished our meals but were talking and still eating the appetizer.  We must not have been eating it quickly enough because our waitress came back and grabbed it off the table while my date was eating from it!!! She then asked if she could wrap it for us?!?!?! At that point we were both annoyed at being rushed. Fridays is open until 1am, it was not even midnight but we were the only table left in our server's section. She made it obvious she couldn't wait for us to leave.  Unfortunately, TGI FRIDAYS is the only thing in the area open this late but I won't go back. Not worth the money. Crappy service, mediocre food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-8?start=20
Isabel R.,"Windsor, CT",0,1,,1.0,3/30/2015,"Went on Sunday night,  and the host told me the waiting was 45 min for a party of 15 people, , after waiting for more than an hour, we noticed that the staff  where in disagreement on how to accommodate us,,they kept us wating hoping that we would leave, overwhelmed by the traffic of incoming customers. When we got tired of waiting,  we left and no staff member even took the initiative to ask why we were leaving. We noticed that as soon as we left , they quickly accommodate another group of people that were there after us. Is been the worst experience I ever had being that we where there to celebrate my son's 9 birthday. Highly NOT recommended.  P.S. We even call to try to speak with a Manager and they hung up on us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-8?start=20
Bonnie H.,"East Hartford, CT",17,26,1,1.0,12/28/2015,"We went out to lunch after a hectic morning of xmas shopping and just wanted a quick and tasty meal and maybe a cocktail or 2. This was hands down one of the worst meals out we have shared and we have shared over 12 years worth. The waitress was pleasent enough but my sangria had absolutely no wine or pieces of fruit  in it. It came in a soda glass with a straw and full of ice and tasted like raspberry juice. I am a lightweight and I know it if I've had even a sip of wine on an empty stomach. There was no wine I promise you. I mentioned this to my waitress and she offered to bring me another drink. Now we have had many fine meals at this particular Friday's so I agreed to try another glass thinking it was on the house. The second glass was served with no fruit and a ton of ice but a slight amount of wine. Maybe an ounce? Not worth complaining for if it's free right?  Well guess what? It wasn't. So essentially we ended up paying $18 for two glasses of watered down juice. If that wasn't ridiculous enough my husband ordered the buffulo chicken sandwhich and when he opened the sandwhich to put on his blue cheese dressing there were two less than a half inch thick and less than a third of the bun teeny tiny pieces of Buffalo chicken. I have had much larger   chicken patties from the public school cafeterias in the schools where I work. And those are usually quite small to average and a whole meal costs around $3 and they offer the staff two patties. This was almost $9 and came with a pitiful amount of just ok lukewarm fries. Sorry to go off on a tangent there but I needed something to compare the size to. Think two elongated silver dollers. Ok. enough comparisons. My burger was ok but a little too well done for medium. My husband waited for our waitress to ask about our meal and he showed her the pitiful sandwhich which he had not yet taken one bite. She offered to get him something else but he said no and she said she would take care of it. She did remove the meal off the check but not the first  wine/ but in actuality juice.  We just wanted to leave but my husband asked to speak to the manager about our disappointments and this manager was awful to him. He said well why did you pay the bill and accused my husband of not letting him make it right. My husband asked why can't you make it right now and the manager said well you allready payed and tipped and diddn't offer any other solution. It was awful. We will never go back. In conclusion if you like tiny portions, lukewarm fries, watered down or Virgin drinks, and a crappy manager well then go on down to the Manchester, CT Tgi Friday's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-8?start=20

Jason M.,"Berlin, CT",118,1005,25,3.0,1/22/2012,"Ya know, as far as chain restaurants go, they actually did a pretty good job. Normally I wouldn't write a review for a chain place, but I'll give these guys some props... I was alone on a Friday night (it was girls' night out), and felt like dropping in for a meal and a ballgame at the bar. Long story short, I had a good cheap meal, and the bartenders were nice and attentive the whole time. I had a salad, a solid Jack Daniel's burger, and a really rich dessert for a set price ($12.99 if I'm not mistaken).  Not bad for what could have been a much more boring night on the couch all alone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-8?start=20
Diana M.,"Vernon, CT",11,31,12,3.0,1/18/2015,I had Matt as a server and he was absolutely  amazing.  I would suggest anyone who comes to this locations request him!! I won't come here unless I can have him again. he was very personable and understanding. I ordered the barbecue chicken Flatbread and it was unacceptable. the chicken as dry and crumbled between my fingers. Matt put up no fight and took it off my bill. the manager on the other hand told Matt to tell me that it was going to come out the same way if I requested the appetizer again. please request matt.....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-8?start=20
Jon S.,"South Windsor, CT",1,18,6,1.0,10/23/2012,"Flat, unexciting, uninviting... Just a place I don't see a need to go back to. The hostess and server couldn't have cared less about things.  They never smiled, talked just the bare minimum.  The waitress was slow, didn't check on the meal which wasn't prepared correctly.  The apps we ordered stunk, one sitting to long, the other cooked to long.  I could go on and on, if they could under deliver they did. I keep thinking Thank Goodness I don't have to return.  In the mall area of Manchester there are so many other options, I'll steer clear of Friday's and check out the others next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manchester-8?start=20
