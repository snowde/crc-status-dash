Cher Y.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",84,175,1103,2.0,8/17/2016,"Ordered by phone a head of time for a simple order of original wings. Was told should be ready in 10-15 mins. BUT I waited for more than 30 mins in the restaurant after my order was taken 30 mins ago.  All waitresses n waiters were scattered around at bar, corners n a couple of tables and chatting?! Joking without taking care of customers. Whoa!  I had to go up to them to ask where my order was n when  it could be ready. Then one waiter went in the kitchen, the second waitress again n the third waiter again.  Only the last one came out said:""They made my order wrong so they were making it now. Should be ready in a few mins.""  Speechless!!! I finally got my order from the first waiter who went into kitchen handed the wings and a little card said next appetizer for FREE.  I still want to be honest though. Thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manhasset?start=20
Jeannie T.,"Queens, NY",173,294,3662,2.0,1/22/2016,"So sad. I used to like chain restaurant places especially when I was in college or single. Drinks were usually good and food was good for the price. TGIF tries to do both but this particular location is not good. The pick 4 apps we got were just ok. We picked the buffalo wings,  mozzarella sticks,  pretzel bread with dipping sauces,  and potato skins. The potato skins were the worst. Nearly no bacon and they chintzed on the portions. They pretty much used one potato skin and cut it into four pieces. Say what?!  The buffalo wings were not spicy at all and looked greasy. The best two were the pretzel bread and mozzarella sticks. The bread was soft and warm. The portion was large enough to share with four adults (two sticks). The mozzarella sticks were fried just right and came with more sticks than the potato skin, think there were four.  Onto the entrées. The kids meal was the best value. They get one entrée and one side. Plenty for the younger set. And a choice of fountain soda,  iced tea,  or milk at no extra charge. $1.49 extra if you wanted a slush instead.  The adults I were with mostly ordered burgers and french dip sandwiches. Not impressed. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes in lieu of french fries. That was not even served with sour cream. A note about the staff, I only saw my waitress three times. First to get our drink order, then our lunch order, and then for the check. Argh. Couldn't ask for napkins,  refills or sour cream. Miffed.  The chain places are great for fast food and hanging out but I was disappointed overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manhasset?start=20

Anastasia G.,"Manhasset, NY",16,52,123,3.0,8/29/2015,"One reason. The one main reason i go here  is because of the appetizers. The boneless wings are so good! Plus currently its $10 all you can eat apps! They're the main reason why I go. My favorite is the Sriracha ones. Not too spicy at all. I love them and i'm not a ""spicy"" person. Really good with the bleu cheese or ranch dips. The meat is so tender and moist. It can't get much better. Otherwise, the food is average. The mozzarella sticks are a good quality. They're seasoned fries are good too. The sliders on the appetizer menu have always been okay though last time the buns were old and i couldn't bite through them. The meat and seasonings were good though. The staff has always been alright. Never a problem. Very unenthusiastic. The manager is always around and seems to always be on top of things.

You can't have a bartender work the bar and take numerous table orders, put more servers on to take care of the table customers along with a bartender to take care of the bar and you won't have the numerous Yelp complaints about your terrible service!   Food is average at best, so there is nothing worth coming back for as for a selection.   I got stuck here the last two times I visited with terrible service and this time was no different, three strikes and I'm out of your establishment forever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manhasset?start=20

Jim P.,"New Hyde Park, NY",0,1,2,1.0,5/6/2017,"I grew up in this area so Fridays was always a go to restaurant for me and my family. It WAS. We asked our server for 4 cups of hot water. She said it would take 20 minutes (it only took 2). Okay then... we then asked for a fork because we received a set without one. We asked the same server TWICE and she still didn't bring it. We had to ask someone else to finally get one. Thirty minutes later(it was that backed up?) we got a salad and a burger. We waited 30 minutes and four appetizers didn't come! We asked the manager, and it turned out that the kitchen didn't even start to prepare a single one! And they did receive the order!

Albert K.,"Jericho, NY",2,93,,3.0,10/5/2014,"Even though Friday's has always been OK in my books, I think my last visit to this location was some what of a bust. This I'll explain. Yea, the since food is always decent, the host(ess) and wait staff friendly, and it's always fairly quick, I'll always have a soft spot for this restaurant chain mainly because of my past experiences and because of my fondness of their food over most of their competitors. However, at this location, I wish that their staff was more careful and attentive on their clients and what they were discussing the last time I visited. I mean, yea, I still like these guys, don't get me wrong, but if it had been my very first visit, I probably wouldn't come back after the lack of attention given to us. Now, I'll probably give the waitress the benefit of doubt, considering that I could have sworn she was being trained the last time I came to this location several months back, but she needs to be more careful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manhasset?start=40

Zaneta O.,"Westbury, NY",837,691,2805,3.0,4/9/2014,Love Fridays! Their Jack Daniels menu is quite tasty. If you sign up for the Fridays membership (which is free by the way) you can collect points towards free food for future purchases. They will also email you bogo coupons. When I get those in my email I simply can't resist! Everything is already modestly priced so for 2 people it ends up being around $30 including tip tax and drink (depending on what you order obviously) when you use the bogo coupon. The service at this one isn't always great. Sometimes it takes a while for the waitress to get to you. I prefer to drive to the one in Westbury eventhough this one is closer to me.

Jackie C.,"Great Neck, NY",0,7,1,1.0,9/5/2016,"HORRIBLE AND DISGUSTING! The minute we walked in we were already appalled.  There was no hostess when we entered, which is understandable if a venue is busy or understaffed; but when the hostess finally appeared we were not greeted and completely ignored. It was so awkward. She then turned around from having her back towards us and asked ""three?"" We then responded, that we were a party of three, and she just then told us that we could not be seated for another 5 minutes even though there were empty tables galore. Again, I understand being understaffed and busy, but not seating customers is not the answer. A waiter then came over, ignored the hostess and sat us immediately. Our booth was DISGUSTING. There were sticky splatters all over the walls and hair and dirty stuck and scattered within them. I was afraid to touch anything around me. Our waitress was nice, but not attentive at all. She would attend the booth next to ours and did not then check on us. But at least she was polite. Upon leaving, the hostess, again did not acknowledge us at all.

My Thought S.,"DOUGLASTON, NY",0,2,,1.0,3/16/2013,"Our family had the worst experience there by far.  The waiter dumped an entire tall glass of water on me, apologized and left our table. We expected that he, or someone would be back immediately to clean up the puddle of water I was surrounded by, but none did until my husband flagged someone down. Unfortunately they left one part of the floor soaking wet, and when my 5 year old daughter decided to get up from her chair to come over to me, she slipped and fell hard on her back and hit her head.  Of course, she began crying loudly. None came to see what was wrong!  My husband again had to flag someone down to finish drying the floor. After all that had happened you would think they would have taken a substantial amount off the bill as an apology for the HORRENDOUS service, but the waiter handed us the bill with the full amount on it!!!!!!!!   Oh, and of course, the service was slow and the waiter mixed up our orders!!!!!!!!  How do they stay in business!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manhasset?start=100

Michelle B.,"Queens, NY",72,126,374,3.0,8/1/2017,"I've been here a few times and each time I was pleasantly surprised by the food. I'm never thrilled about eating at a corporate chain like this but sometimes I get talked into things like this.  I was with a group and this was their choice, so here it goes.  Came with a party of 7 on a Sunday night. Waited 15 minutes to be seated while the host kept telling us our table was being cleaned. We were sat in the very back corner with 3 or 4 other large, empty tables. Hmmm. As soon as we sat down our server came to take our order. Huh? She decided to get our drinks but left off the lemons we ordered. When I order food I always try to ask for everything I'm going to need when I place my order, like extra ranch, so this way the server isn't running back and forth. Two of us asked several times for extra ranch before and during our meal (because we never received it the first request and someone different brought our food out also without the extra ranch).  I was feeling this was a bad choice but when the food came I was like, wow, this looks really good.  And it was. We started off with the Friday's Combo Appetizer which is boneless wings (but our server allowed us to get the bone in wings, add a point for her),  loaded potato skins and mozzarella sticks. I don't usually like mozzarella sticks but these were the best I've ever had. They were crispy and the cheese was perfectly melted and really good.  For our entrees I had the southern fried chicken sandwich with fries. This chicken was perfectly crisp and loaded with lettuce, tomato, pickles, avocado and cheese. YUM!! It was delicious. My son got the endless apps that were really good and fresh. I really liked that the server put in more than one app order at a time so he had something to eat instead of having to wait to order the next app. (Another point for the server). She also asked the rest of our group if they wanted to order any apps. (Two more points for the server). Two people in our group got the steak and ribs with mashed and vegi and they also enjoyed their food.  For my son and I my bill was $24. Excellent! Good food at good prices.  Plus.... There is a sign when we walked in that says they offer free apps at the bar every Friday 4-7pm. SCORE!  I will definitely be back for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manhasset

Him and several servers had no problem hanging out and ignoring us and the 2 other parties at the bar.

Then our complimentary taco chips with salsa came out. This is part of the Stripes rewards. At this point we placed our food order, my wife ordered a cheese burger and I used my coupon for the Bourbon Grill Mahi Mahi which came with garlic spinach with mushrooms and cheddar mashed potatoes. Our meals came out in an acceptable amount of time, the food was hot and very good. You would think ordering Mahi Mahi at Friday's would be just ok but this dish was very good and tasty. Pretty good Friday's!  With all this, sending my drink back and have a coupon which gave us half off our bill, our waiter Ryan was on point, polite and efficient.

Definitely won't be coming back. When we were given the bill, the manager came over with a coca cola refill(which none of us were drinking).

Thomas F.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,62,,3.0,10/2/2015,"Requested  the bar area to get the unlimited $10 appetizers. Greeter stated Im  not sure there is space,  there is  a game going on,  but did seat us there. When we were seated, I looked around and there was plenty of seats in the bar area. The area we sat in had  no wait person assigned,  so we had to wait for the lone bartender who was making drinks for the whole place to finally take the order.  The food was okay, not as tasty as the apps I had in Fridays other locations.  We complained to the manager who apologized and yelled at the bar tender who was doing the best he could,  but did become more attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manhasset?start=60

Brian W.,"New York, NY",5,160,1,1.0,1/27/2014,Service was slow. Food tasted like it came off a truck and was warmed. Prices were high for what we got. We don't plan on visiting again. So sad it wasn't a better experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manhasset?start=80
Ricky W.,"Roslyn Heights, NY",0,2,,2.0,3/17/2013,"So I got a 20% off coupon yesterday in my e-mail, so we figured it would be a cool idea to use it at one of our more liked restaurants.  I realize people mainly review to post negative comments, but this was pretty bad. We came in and were seated right away, at an empty restaurant.  Our waitress took ten minutes to get to us and ask for our desired orders, saying she wasn't our waitress, before walking away for another 5 minutes before getting our drinks, at which point we decided on an appetizer. We got the three for all, potato skins, wings, and potstickers, after she told us fried mozzarella was one of only two things other than potato skins, until saying ""there's more than three choices"" jogged her memory a little. We get our appetizer, and two of the potato skins are small rounded things a third the size of normal.  Shrugging it off, our meals finally arrive.  I get a 6 inch by 3 inch 8 oz. Medium yet somehow completely burnt Flat Iron, two small ice cream scoops of mashed potatoes, and four Parmesan fries.  I ask to see the manager, and instead of going to fetch him she proceeds to spend 5 minutes to converse with some other, freshly seated and very rowdy people. The manager proceeds to tell me the sizes are normal and that she was actually our waitress, blaming it on ""no two are alike"" akin to Subway, completely refusing to take it off. This was a disappointing meal consisting of a waitress that felt she was right, a refusal to accept something that could have been easily remedied, and a waste of time because of incompetence.  I've eaten here many times and it was a lot better than it was today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manhasset?start=80

Dan E.,"Branchburg, NJ",56,861,26,2.0,3/23/2014,"2 stars is actually being pretty generous here.  After a traffic filled trip to Long Island, my wife and I were in the area and had about an hour to kill.  Needing a drink, I was pleasantly surprised to see a TGI Friday's right on Northern Blvd.  As an FYI, there's a pretty massive parking lot behind the building.  That was pretty nice. We walked in and were able to snag a table right by the bar.  Unfortunately, one of the bartenders also doubled up as our waitress.  She was pretty busy but also pretty inattentive.  That's not exactly a winning combination.  It took us a while to get our check when we finally wanted to go.  I started out with a Sam Adams on tap - the taps did not taste clean.  I hate that - never a good sign.  For my 2nd beer, I switched over to a different brew hoping these taps didn't taste as bad.  No such luck.  I was pretty disappointed as I love draft beer but I just couldn't do it.   I had to switch over to a bottle - can't deal with the ""unfresh"" tasting taps.  My wife and I did put in for an order of the pretzel sticks that come with a beer cheese dipping sauce.  I have to give them credit - these pretzel sticks are pretty good.  I've had them a few times now and they are definitely a good appetizer.  If it wasn't for the food tasting pretty on point, I'd probably go with a 1-star rating.  Drinks were a miss but the food was solid.  And, to top it off, this particular Friday's is actually priced noticeably higher than the ones we go to in NJ.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manhasset?start=80
Tanezia V.,"Westchester County, NY",1,41,3,1.0,4/4/2015,"I normally sit at the bar when I visit but last night my friend and I chose to sit at a table. I ordered a grilled chicken Cobb salad and she ordered ribs and fries. I decided to order our drinks and boneless buffalo chicken as a starter. 20 mins later the waitress brings me chicken wings on a bone. I sent them back , finally the right order comes out. My drink shaker was loose and the most of my drink spilled on the table . The waitress didn't care to wipe the table or offer a new one like in the past when it has happened . An hour goes by we still didn't have our entree. IT WAS NOT CROWDED!!! Out of frustration I cancel my salad and told her to just bring my friends food. She asked ""oh u didn't get your salad?"" I just looked at her. My friend receives her food and we sat at the wet table where the the drink had spilled for the next 40 mins. The waitress never checked on us but one time during the hour wait for food. But the kicker was when she left my bill on the table it wasn't for our table. She wasn't apologetic and never again will I sit at table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manhasset?start=80

Paul B.,"Great Neck, NY",1,17,,2.0,10/19/2014,"I am being extremely nice in giving this place two stars.  I have been here about 20 times in 15 years and it is going down hill.  Not that it was ever great mind you.  Not close.  But usually go once a year or so for the TV coverage for a 1:00 lunch time football Sunday when I have to pick up my son in the area. Anyway, I will say that generally speaking, they make good burgers and their Jack Daniels sauce is fabulous.  As a rule, service is very slow.  These are the norms.  However, every once in a while, they make the big mistake as you can read in some of the one and two star reviews below.   My story of today is that I ordered the Jack Daniels Sampler.  The fried shrimp came out uncooked.  Not undercooked.  Uncooked!  It was ice cold and the shrimps were brown on the inside - not white.  The reason I couldn't tell from the first bite is that the Jack Daniels sauce was very cold as well.  It took two bites for me to figure it out.  So they brought me a new set of shrimp and they happened to bring out another little dip cup of the Jack Daniels sauce and again it was really cold.  So I spoke to the manager and said that I didn't understand the purpose of bringing a dipping sauce that felt about 40 degrees as a dip for a hot dish featuring ribs, chicken tenders and fried shrimp.  What was the point???  The sauce should be room temperature at worst.  The manager advised that yes the sauce was in fact 44 degrees and comes straight from the refrigerator!!  Crazy!  When I commented that I thought this didn't sound like a smart process, he took it to the microwave and had it heated for me which made me feel like I was being a difficult customer but really..........why would they bring 44 degree sauce as standard procedure for a hot dish? Help.  This place needs it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manhasset?start=80

The service is pretty good, as the manager can often be found walking around the restaurant checking on people's meals. They try to accomodate whatever needs your group may have even if it means moving around certain parts of the restaurants so everyone in your party can be seated together.  The food is decent. Although it does tend to be on the salty side, but what can you expect from a chain like this?

Jayson B.,"Great Neck, NY",144,4,1,5.0,12/13/2015,"Let me first start off by noting that Danielle here is an atrocious waitress. Not only does she have a negative attitude, but also, demonstrated a lazy work ethic when she refused to serve endless appetizers because it did not tip well and because she did not want to constantly serve the table. Our host Henry, when asked, noted that there were endless apps. Therefore, when we asked our server and she rudely declined, stating ""I am the server he is the host"", it clearly showed her attitude and demonstrated that she believed she had superiority over the ""measly host"" who told us there were endless apps. We spoke to Henry once again and he moved us to the bar where Tyler was more than willing to accommodate our requests. My main point is, shall you ever find yourself in the vicinity and eating at this TGI Fridays, make sure you absolutely do not get that waitress and instead request Tyler or any other more competent servers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-manhasset?start=80
