Robert B.,"Beaverton, OR",3,18,1,3.0,7/10/2008,"This place used to be somewhat of a tradition for me. Every Thursday evening myself and around four or five friends came here to gorge on wings and every other appetizer. Typical chain food venue, the staff had always been great to me. Except the staff in the bar section. I don't even want to go into details about how often we've had to wait 20+ minutes to get our tabs after asking. As for the City, it's a typical college town in southern Minnesota where it's the appreciation of the culture that makes the experience that more rewarding.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mankato-2
Chris E.,"Conifer, CO",199,531,35,3.0,2/9/2010,"Good restaurant for a decent steak and sides. This place adjoins the hotel I stay in when in Mankato for client work; very convenient. 6pm as a single diner, seated immediately and ordered the Flat Iron 8 oz. Served quickly by friendly staff team; out in 40 minutes. Music is loud but not too obnoxious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mankato-2
