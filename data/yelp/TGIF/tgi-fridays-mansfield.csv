Edward L S.,"Norfolk, VA",0,22,4,5.0,8/14/2017,"First time at any of these restaurants but I have to say I was very impressed with this one. My friend and I decided to stop by for lunch and I wasn't disappointed. Also first time in this area (out of town on work business for a week), so you only get one chance for a 1st impression. Restaurant was very clean but I didn't care for the ""house music"" which seemed to blare all thru the establishment. Food didn't take long to arrive, I ordered a side Caesar salad (very delish). The Bourbon Barrel Chicken on a plank with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. The meal was very tasty and very seasoned. Our waitress was very polite and so was the other staff members. I would definitely recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield
Melissa W.,"Blackstone, MA",0,6,2,1.0,11/24/2017,"I truly used to love this place but service has gone downhill! Here for after Black Friday shopping, it's not that busy here and dirty dishes just sit! We had to move our own glasses to the bar. I count 8 places that no one has cleaned up. There's no reason for it!!!  It just makes me not want not to come back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield
Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24565,1.0,12/31/2016,"Manager Sara is friendly, after I called corporate, and offered to send me a some free coupons.  It's been nearly six months, and nothing in the mail. The Milford TGI Fridays is just SO much better..... GO there.... ask for Julia (she's so funny, kind, helpful).  This place can definitely be put on the AVOID AT ALL COSTS list.... I'm honestly disgraced at how terrible the service is from all of the staff (except for Cheryl, who was very helpful.... see previous review).  When dealing with chain restaurants, you'd expect for the same service in all of them. I have had very, very few bad experiences with TGI Fridays in general. I've found most of them to have outstanding food, desserts, appetizers, rewards and staff members, not to mention that more and more of their restaurants have gotten complete makeovers throughout the past few years. This specific location doesn't nearly raise the bar to what is already a standard at the TGI Fridays locations in Dedham and Milford, and which is why I will not be returning here.... instead be making the drive to either the Dedham or Milford location.  1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield
Amy L.,"Bridgewater, MA",116,1,,1.0,11/24/2017,"After a long day of Black Friday shopping my friend and I decided to stop at one of our favorite restraints, T.G.I. Friday's. We have never visited this location but decided to give it a try. We sat with empty drinks at our table for over a half hour and then waited over an hour for our food . Not to mention our food consisted of a chicken sandwich and boneless wings . Very disappointed in this restaurant",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield
Ella S.,"Needham, MA",0,3,,2.0,10/21/2017,"I went last night with my family for the ribs special they are currently offering. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes, even though only the bar was busy. That instantly told me they were understaffed. Regardless we were seated in about 5 minutes. It took over 10 minutes for our server to come over to us, and then it took over half an hour for our food to come out. The fries that came with the ribs were old and tasted terrible. When we asked for more (because we weren't given very many) we were told they were making a fresh batch...which means we got the old ones before. My own meal was a chicken dish and the sides were bigger than the actual piece of chicken. We did agree that the food was delicious once it got to us. Then the decor was gross and old. Everything looked broken, stained or worn. This place hasn't even been here that long, so I really don't understand how that could be. The color scheme was also unappetizing and dark. The servers had to buss their own tables, which made service slower. It also took them a while to get around to busing their tables, and it's gross to see people's left overs sitting around. Then we noticed about six employees all at the cash registers, punching in numbers the whole night. Having worked in food service before, I know bussers are needed...but number crunchers definitely aren't...right?? Anyway we won't be coming back to this particular Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield
Jennifer S.,"North Attleborough, MA",31,143,56,2.0,11/14/2016,"Food was terrible. It was extremely salty and seemed like a frozen dinner vs something someone made you. The waitress was very nice and her service was great. The food was just the worst food we have had in a long time. I usually don't like chain restaurant's but there are a few that are okay. This one though, was the worst food by far. I could have bought frozen tv dinners and stayed home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield

Rahul S.,"Lowell, MA",40,11,8,1.0,1/27/2017,Very bad service.. We live quite close so been there a couple of times. Have to always wait 4-5 minutes to get seated even when the place is empty.

George S.,"Holbrook, MA",81,5,,1.0,8/19/2016,"Okay, I just want to start off by saying my aunt and I used to be servers, at Bertuccis to be exact which I'm sure is fairly similar to this place. We have had our bad days and we have had our good days but there just was no excuse for the service we received today.  Oh sweet Jesus where to begin. First off, we walked in and saw a male host with a bow tie who just literally looked like he wanted to kill himself. No smile, no how are you, nothing. I'm the person who can just pick up a conversation with anyone and this guy was just not having it. He looked very confused for a minute or two and then sat us at a table which was fine. Now here's where it starts hitting the fan. We waited about 10 minutes before we even knew who our server was. Finally she came over and said her name was Jen and she seemed fine. We thought we were in good hands. My aunt was giving the drink order for herself and her two children and almost before she finished the order she tried to take off without even asking me... I know I'm pasty white but come on don't make me feel like Casper the ghost.. So I ordered my beer and we also ordered our food since we were chilling there for 10 minutes prior to the greetings. We waited about 20 minutes for the food which was completely fine, it was slightly busy so we had no issues with this. Then the food came... I ordered the jack Daniels burger which is my favorite but for some reason it tasted no better than mediocre. I got regular fries instead of the sweet potato fries I ordered but it was a quick fix. The kids food was perfect. My aunt ordered the Jack Daniels Chicken, but she received what looked to be a sandwich of some kind with jack Daniels sauce. We waited for the waitress to come back which was a little disappointing because it took awhile. When she finally came back my aunt told her what she ordered and Jen immediately took it back. The kids and I finished our meals while my aunt sat there looking like her stomach was about to cave in, finally her food came and she said it was ""Salty"". So Jen came back we didn't discuss the food much we were more focused on getting the kids dessert, we gave her the order for the ""Dirt Sundae"" (which looked very lazily put together. If I was a child I would have been pissed) and Vanilla Ice cream with gummy worms which was fine. I asked her if there was anything with peanut butter on the menu and she said no but let me get you a menu!  About 20 minutes later the ice creams come and still no menu. And no sign of Jen. The kids were about half way done when my aunt got her attention to ask for that menu which I finally got. Then she disappeared into thin air. Gone like the wind. We waited 10 minutes, no sign of Jen still. Finally after asking a different waiter where Jen was she finally appeared and  we ordered the vanilla bean cake which I debated seeing how this night was going to even get that. So we got it to go. I almost fell on the floor it must have taken a minute and a half for this cake to pop out and on to my table. So then the bill came. Jen just put it on the table and walked away. My aunt was looking at it and said ""The sandwich that I didn't order is still on the bill"" at this point I did an exasperated sigh of distraught. We waited for another 10 minutes for Jen to come back to our table. And 5 of those 10 minutes were spent talking to her co workers in the kitchen with her back to us. We literally watched this all transpire. Well she finally comes back and my aunt tells her about what felt like the 100th mistake of the night, but then returns with ""oh everyone always gets confused it says it if you look closely we took it off the bill but it still shows like its on the bill"" okay I think I heard you sigh at this point just reading that. If you knew that in advance why wouldn't you tell us that bit of information. We eventually pay the bill and looked at each other for what to put for a tip. Now we both are avid tippers and I personally feel guilty for not leaving a 20% tip but I just couldn't do it tonight. We still mustered up to give her 15% which I know, my aunt knows and you know by this point she did not deserve. At the end of this we received no good byes, no have a good night, no apologies, nothing. It's as if she just wanted us to pay the bill, get a tip, and leave.  Okay to close what feels to be a novel at this point we had a very very bad experience here with Jen and the Kitchen at TGI Fridays. Sincerely, Two very unhappy customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield

We went to Buffalo Wild Wings and the place is packed, we have drinks within 2 minutes. Bww was our second choice tonight.

Jen C.,"Dighton, MA",25,25,,1.0,8/19/2016,"Normally, I think Fridays has consistent, good service & food. Not this time. It was my first visit to this particular location.  The host was great. We were seated quickly & he was pleasant. The waitress, Jen, was another story. She started out fine, but once the drinks were delivered, it quickly went downhill.  My husband ordered 2 appetizers as his meal. With all the allergy awareness, you would think it wouldn't be tough to order potato skins without cheese. They were sent back when they arrived with cheese. We had all finished eating our meals before another server brought back the potato skins without cheese. At that point, he no longer wanted them & wanted to leave.  Never once did our waitress check on our table. We needed drink refills, condiments, silverware, napkins but no one ever came.  We finally got the check & the potato skins were still on the bill. My husband brought one of our young children outside while I waited to question the server. She pointed out that the skins were removed on the other side of the folded receipt. She took our money & eventually came back with our change.  While waiting, we realized the total didn't add up. The waitress did not return the receipt with our change. When we were able to get her to bring our receipt, we saw she charged us twice for the skins, but only removed one. Then, she had the nerve to question the tip! This girl should not be in the service industry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield

We started gathering the dishes and silverware and stacking it up for her 10 minutes later she returned with the check and we told her what was wrong....The young girl was very sorry and explained she was running the whole floor and apologized..she also said she was ready to walk out......the place really wasn't busy so I am still a little confused.....we tried several times to find a manager but, he too running around like a chicken with his head cut off....we paid the bill left a good tip and got the heck out of there! Seriously these places need to get it together .....2 places 3 minutes away from each other and both were equally terrible....we didn't eat at BBWW but, we were treated like crap before we were  seated....never even sat down before walking out! I will never eat at either of these establishments again....my 11 year old daughter said to me ""tonight was a little crazy 2 bad reviews in 10 min of each other""......yup pretty crazy .....I did tell a man waiting for his take out at Tgif good luck!

Edward B.,"Franklin, MA",5,4,1,5.0,12/20/2014,Went to TGIF in Mansfield and first we had to wait for a table for about 10 minutes. It was not crowded and they had 2 young people up front as host and hostess. The guy told us it would be a couple of minutes for him to clean off a table. 10 minutes later he came back and sat us at a table that should have taken 2 minutes to clean. The waiter Steven came over ask for drinks and left and came back shortly with our drinks. He took our order and we waited 20 minutes for a chicken salad for my wife and a jack Daniels chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. My fries and chicken Sandwich were ice cold. He took them back and within 5 or 6 minutes another person brought back a hot chicken sandwich and very hot fries  makes me wonder then why it took so long the first time and to get cold food,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield?start=20
Mike D.,"Mansfield, MA",0,10,1,1.0,5/15/2015,"This Fridays has literally been a staple in my diet for the past five years. Now i don't think one bad outing deserves a death sentence for the entire establishment, but I do feel that the hiring and training managers need to be demoted to washing dishes and cleaning the pubic hairs off the urinals in the men's room because the waiter they rolled out for me and my siblings deserves to be tarred and feathered.....just the creepy way he took the food order created an awkwardness that compares to walking in on one of your parents naked. Yet I get that not everyone is cut out for what they do and are just trying to make a living, so I don't put a ton of emphasis on the ""weirdo"" vibe this bro gave off. His problem was that he was just a terrible waiter. There was no one else in the place (lunchtime) and for some reason he didn't ask if anyone wanted a drink refill when taking our food order even tho we all had empty glasses. So we sat there waiting for about a half hour expecting our food at any minute. Then he came up to our table and informed my brother that the prime rib sandwich he ordered was no longer available. Literally 30 minutes after we put our order in!!! Then he said in a nonchalant way ""so do you like want something else?"" Kind of pissed and caught off guard my brother just said ""ahhhhhhh I don't know, I don't even have a menu..."".....we discussed that the rest of our burgers were probably already sitting in the window and it really didn't make any sense to sit there and wait for them to start making something else...when the kid came back with a menu I said ""we're just gonna 86 the whole order,"" and made a cut throat gesture to my neck.  The kid seemed just overwhelmed with confusion as I don't think he was understanding what I meant. I thought he might just go and get us a basket of rolls or something...as he walked away probably going out back to ask someone what I meant we got up and exited.....chipotle is right across the street and I must say everything in that burrito created a medley of flavor in my mouth!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield?start=20

The order of 3 soups and 3 salads took over 45 minutes to come out. When it did finally come out, each person got theirs intermittently with 2 to 3 minute gaps. The soups were bland. We had to remind the waitress about the breadsticks which came out frozen in the middle. The waitress never asked about drink refills until about an hour and a half of being there.

My girlfriend and I stopped in here on a pretty slow Friday around 1, and after waiting around with another couple (for 2 or 3 minutes, I would say), the hostess finally came around and brought us to our seats. We requested a booth, and were told we would have to sit in the bar area, no big deal. We get seated, and are told 'someone' will be with us in a couple minutes. We look around, and it's pretty deserted save for a few people at tables by the window. The waitress comes around, takes our drink order, and leaves, only to come back 10 minutes later with the drink, and still no silverware. She takes our orders, and leaves, coming back about a 45 minutes with our food orders (we got 2 cheeseburgers, that's it.) I had asked for no onions, and so she brought it back. It took almost another hour for the burger to be made again, and when she finally had brought it back, it was cold, and my girlfriend had already finished her meal. We asked for the bill, and the waitress brought out the receipt that had a survey on it. We paid, but the waitress had actually held onto the survey and walked away with it. We asked the hostess if we could get a new survey, and after seeing the waitress and hostess talk for a few moments, the manager came around with the waitress and had her hand us the receipt, as she had tucked it away. We left pretty quickly after, very dissatisfied. The food was overcooked, the portions were tiny ,and we never were offered any refills for our drinks.

CJ G.,"Grand Isle, VT",131,289,1,2.0,9/27/2010,TGI Fridays! I hate the one in VT. There is a reason why it was shut down! Will this location be as bad? Well to start we had tickets go to go a concert in Mansfield MA at the Comcast center! We had gotten there early and wanted some real food before the show and didn't want to pay the prices to eat inside. So we got off the I95 one exit early and found this place in a shopping plaza. Looked ok from the outside! So we figured we had a good hour to kill so we decided to eat here. Service: The service here wasnt to bad. We got sat within 23 minutes of entering the building. It wasnt to busy for a Saturday night it seemed though. As we took our seats the server came over right away and took our drink orders and app order. Now i havent been to a TGIF in a LONG time! So the menu looked pretty up to date. Alot of new things. After looking for a but we ordered our meals.  Drinks and meals came out quickly and done right.  Food: We had ordered one app. It was the pot stickers. They came out hot and ready to eat! in fact it was one of the better apps I have had in a long time. Gotta give them props for this app!  Our first meal was a BBQ chicken wrap with fries. It came out to be pretty good. It tasted pretty good over all! Fries came out ok. They even used some seasoning on them. Our second meal was Captain Morgan Caribbean Conga-Line Chicken Sandwich. This is where I had some high hopes. It was bad just didn't live up to its name I think. The chicken was cooked well and it came with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was nothing to special just about avg in what I thought it should taste. The sweet potato friends are another story. I didnt care for them. They tasted sorta funny to me I guess. Price: For 2 people it was easy on the wallet. It ran about $32 over all. That's about what I would have liked to pay. A little lower would have been better based on the food. Over all: Its MUCH better than the one that was in VT. Service was very good! They just lack in the food. The app was the best part of the meal! They still got some much needed improvements. Just think it could be better. So if your in the area I'm sure there is better but it does work for a quick cheap dinner for 2.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield?start=20
Tess A.,"Braintree, MA",1,10,,3.0,11/15/2012,"typical TGI Fridays.  The bartender was very attentive and the food came out quickly. It wasn't very crowded for a Friday night, but then again it is in Mansfield.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield?start=20
Vinny P.,"North Attleborough, MA",14,6,1,3.0,3/26/2012,Good for a chain restaurant with an overall OK atmosphere. Not overly loud so able to hold a conversation. Drinks are measured and seems confused between a restaurant and a bar.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield?start=20
Linda V.,"Taunton, MA",1,37,,3.0,9/25/2013,"Love Tgi Fridays, however this particular location has its challenges with getting take out orders right.  3 strikes and I am done.  The Tgi Fridays in Taunton has their act together. Go there instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield?start=20
Kate O.,"Mansfield, MA",73,14,8,1.0,11/12/2012,So I went out for lunch today with my siblings and niece to TGI Fridays and was reminded as to why we never go here. It was below par. Normally you go to a chain restaurant because it will at least be ok. This was not the case.Today I ordered a soup salad combo. I figured it would be quick and easy. It's not like they make the soups from scratch right? It was eh at best. And it only took them a quick 45 minutes to serve it. My siblings ordered a Caesar salad as a starter and the dressing was gross and they put tomatoes on the salad. They also got soup which took forever as well and their breadsticks that were supposed to come with it weren't served till 20 minutes after the soups and must not have been nuked long enough because they were still ice cold in the center.  We were never offered refills on our drinks and the waitress waited 20 minutes to check on us after the meal had been served to see if we were ok.  I was less then impressed with both the food and service here.  The only highlight of the meal was hanging out with my niece who was a nice distraction for the lack of service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield?start=40
Charlie J.,"Sharon, MA",2,25,12,2.0,1/26/2012,Why do they make me come here!!! I spent a $120.00 on nothing food!!!!! Only thing I can say is the service was polite and quick.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield?start=40
Beth R.,"Boston, MA",158,393,111,3.0,2/17/2012,"I have always liked TGI Friday's, but this location is sub-par to the others I've been to.  We had the appetizer sampler and that was just ok...some items on the plate weren't even warm.  The chicken entree that I ordered was ill-prepared and very fatty, I was pretty disappointed.  However, the #1 thing that put a damper on our dinner was the waitress.  We sat at a high table in the bar area and ordered drinks right away.  After perusing the menu for a bit, the waitress came over and we told her that we were sorry and needed more time.  She came back a couple more times, one of them being when we ordered the app and another with us explaining that we still needed some time to decide because we'd been talking quite a bit.  Every single visit she made to our table without us giving our meal choices, left us with a sour taste for she acted aggravated at our indecisivenss and seemed to even roll her eyes as she walked away.  The same went for after dinner; we sat and chatted awhile and sipped the last of our cocktails.  She had given us the check and when we hadn't settled it right away, she came over and asked if we could do so.  My friend and I are not ones to complain, so we gave her our credit cards in hopes that she'd relax a bit.  Fifteen minutes later, we had to wave her down again because we decided to have one more drink...she hadn't asked us before she'd jumped the gun and delivered the first check and she definately wasn't paying us any mind after we paid it either.  Really snippy and awful customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mansfield?start=40
