Chelsea H.,"Cordova, Memphis, TN",32,3,2,5.0,1/6/2018,"Look, I get it. Maybe service is not the absolute best, but it's not utter crap either. Our server was lovely. There was a bit of a wait for clearly open tables, but nothing overwhelming. I can imagine at peak hours it can be burdensome.  My husband and I came here today with purpose. We heard the Beyond Meat Burger was available at TGI Fridays nationwide. And it did not disappoint!!  The 6 oz vegan patty is seasoned, cooked, and served up with an assortment of toppings. We are vegetarian, so we left the white cheddar and buttered bun that TGIF served it up with, but it can be skipped for vegans. If you've tried the Beyond Burger at home (4 oz patty), you haven't tried this restaurant version. I had nearly forgotten what it was like to feel full from a hearty restaurant burger.  You can rest assured we will be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2
Diana T.,"Memphis, TN",20,46,26,1.0,9/26/2017,"So, we just walked out of here because we couldn't get seated! They just kept looking at us at the podium! I sat myself and the guy waiter with the man bun still chose to ignore me.  The workers are hanging out back smoking cigarettes. I'm thinking there's no manager there so they are just chilling and doing whatever they please.  I called to speak to a manager... of course they didn't answer.  I could have stayed in the hood for this kind of service! Get it together TGIF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2
Donna M.,"Eads, TN",231,696,8402,4.0,8/5/2017,"I arrived @ 9pm on a Saturday night.  The Drink Menu was tempting.  I chose the Frozen Lava Flow ($5) ~ Malibu Coconut, Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum, Fresh Strawberries, Fresh Pineapple, Coco Real.  It was delivered in 5 minutes.   12 minutes after I ordered, my Caesar Salad ($3.20) came, & it was very good.   Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta ($12.90 Full / $8.90 Half) Sauteed All Natural Chicken, Shrimp, & Red Bell Peppers tossed with Fettucini in a Spicy Cajun Alfredo Sauce.  Sauce wasn't too heavy or too spicy ~ just right.  One of my favorite entrees wherever it's offered.  Shortly after I finished my salad, it was delivered.   I will return for this meal.   Interior was spacious & very attractive.  Ladies Room was clean.   Fridays' driveway connects with Wolfchase Mall ~ every time I pass there are vehicles in the parking lot & sometimes it's full.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2
Denise B.,"Memphis, TN",6,54,6,1.0,9/10/2017,"Wow this location has changed. I went here on a date a little while ago. The server provided the best service that she could. She was new and did not know the menu very well. But I enjoy newly hired servers, they are genuinely nice and eager. The bad review rating is for the food not the service. We had to send a steak back. It was cooked well done instead of med well and it was the wrong cut of steak. One of my sides arrived after the reordered 2nd steak arrived. The food tasted basic will no seasoning. I never once saw a manager walking the floor within our 2 hour visit. This is not the Friday's I remember.

Crystal P.,"Philadelphia, PA",40,26,2,1.0,7/2/2017,"You know I don't expect much from Fridays, but this place is just BAD. The two servers in the bar area just kept walking past us, even one girl (short hair cut with a side part) looked at us and didn't even have the decency to say ""someone will be right with you"". I had to go to the bar twice to have someone come to my table. 30 minutes later, we finally had a server come by after she had a nice laugh and conversation with her friends. I asked for pot stickers and she said that they can't make them...so fine I just ordered the mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers. While we waited for our food, I saw about 5 orders of pot stickers come out....but I was told that they can't make them. No napkins were given to us and basically never saw my server.

Mac M.,"Lubbock, TX",2,9,3,5.0,11/27/2015,"Amidst all the negative reviews we were reluctant to try this location. We were traveling through and hadn't eaten at one in several years. The kids really wanted it so we decided to try it out.  We were pleasantly surprised.  We arrived on a Friday night at around 745. We were able to be seated immediately, probably due to all the negative reviews. The place was still pretty crowded though. We were a family of 4 and everyone ordered something different.  I even have a picky eater who always had to change something.  Our waitress was Breanna and she did a fabulous job. The hostess sat us at our table and she arrived immediately and took our drink order. She returned with our drinks and my picky child was not ready to order yet. She left but did not forget about us and came back a few minutes later. She took our order then refilled our drinks.  When our food did arrive, it arrived in a timely fashion, everything was cooked correctly and warm. Even my picky eaters food was prepared correctly. Breanna gave us a few minutes to begin eating them was promptly back over to check that everything tasted good. After about 5 more minutes the general manager arrived to talk to us and make sure everything was ok. Breanna was then back to clear the table and was prompt in bringing us the check when we asked for it.  Overall this was a very good experience and we enjoyed our dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2
Renee D.,"Naples, FL",54,75,47,4.0,10/25/2015,"After reading the reviews I was a little concerned but we decided to try it anyway because it was close to our hotel. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and was told we could sit anywhere. It was early Saturday afternoon and they weren't busy. Upon sitting down we were approached by our waiter. He was very friendly and took our drink order. Drinks were served quickly as were our appetizers and meal. Our food was typical Friday's cuisine, exactly as it should be. The hot food was hot and our salads were cold. Overall we were very happy with our visit.

Jaime T.,"Memphis, TN",210,29,4,1.0,7/26/2015,"My husband and I are major Friday's lovers so after living overseas for 3 years, we were very excited to find one in our new place of residence. Upon walking into the restaurant, I noted that despite the ""wait"", there were several tables throughout the restaurant that were open, ready to be used by incoming patrons. However, having many years of previous experience in the restaurant business, I also knew this might be due to the few larger parties seated.  Once we sat down, it took a longer length of time then was appropriate for our server to come over. He took our drink order and asked if we wanted anything else at the time. I ordered an appetizer and asked for a few more minutes on our entrees when he proceeded to again ask us if we wanted anything else. I repeated myself and he walked away. 10 minutes later, he came back for the rest of our order when we delivered our drinks.  15 minutes after our drinks were delivered, my husband stopped the server to ask about our appetizer to which he replied would be out soon. 10 minutes later, it finally arrived at our table. Despite the delay, they were very fresh and tasted good.  About 20-25 minutes after our app was delivered, our food was delivered. My children's food had obviously been under the warmer for an extended amount of time considering the pasta was literally crispy and the burgers were dried out. The chicken on my salad was cooked well but was cold. One of the most aggravating moments was when we asked for cheese for my daughter's pasta. Our server left and came back to bring something to a table next to ours twice before I reminded him about the cheese. He then brought my husband a lemonade refill that was not asked for and still no cheese. He finally brought back out the cheese almost 20 minutes after we asked for it.  When it came time for our check, the server was no where to be found. When he finally showed up, not only did he smell like an ashtray having obviously finished a cigarette break but he brought out check that indicated he put in my husband's order incorrectly by putting in the more expensive entree instead of the actual entree he ordered. We did not know this due to our lack of visiting Fridays over the last three years. In my opinion, it was shady or lack of caring about knowing your job. Either way, when I asked if I could speak to a manager, the server said he would try to find them. At that point, considering the extended time everything else took and our two small children being done with the situation, we decided to leave.  I am truly disappointed in the incompetency of the server, the uncleaniness of the restaurant and the general lacking of giving a damn by any employee in there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2?start=20

Chealsy L.,"Memphis, TN",15,90,59,3.0,3/3/2016,"I'm not brave enough to update to a five star simply, because one good visit doesn't wipe their slate with me. It always seems my friends or coworkers want to go here and of course I tag along. So I wasn't particularly excited about going again, even though I love the Jack Daniels Burger. This last time was actually pretty outstanding! Our servers name was either John or Josh, but he was awesome. My drinks were made right, my food came out right and in the right order. He had a great personality, the place has been remodeled and they updated their music playlist. The manager is new and so is the rest of the staff. Maybe all of the scathing reviews finally got through to them. I'm not promise you'll have a great experience simply, because there has been so many bad ones at this specific location.

We wait for about 5 minutes before my mom walks over to the bar to ask the bartender why no one has seated us. The restaurant is basically dead. There was no reason for us to be waiting. The bartender tells us there isn't a hostess?? A waitress is sitting down eating and says that there is and at that time the hostess comes out of the kitchen carrying a tray of food. She eventually sits us down. Our waitress was much better though. She brought our food out very quickly, like I said the restaurant was dead. My food was all good but my mom said her flatbread was very limp, normally it's crispy. She only ate about one piece. We had a coupon for a free dessert so we ordered a brownie obsession. I'm SO glad it was free. It was awful. Normally you'd think a fudgey, soft brownie would be good but this brownie was basically still batter. And the chocolate sauce on it was like tar. Terrible.

Jonathan S.,"Jeffersonville, IN",0,16,1,1.0,10/8/2014,This place was extremely disappointing on the two occasions that I went there. On the most recent visit my wife and I waited at the hostess stand for 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging that we were there leading to us walking out. The first time we were there we also ended up walking out after being seated and nobody coming to our table for a good 15 minutes.  It's a real shame because this place is giving the TGI Fridays name a bad wrap. It is obviously an issue with the management and employees at this particular location. I would not advise anyone to ever go here! I would like to preface this by stating that I have literally never walked out of a restaurant before and I did if here both times that I went...I should not have given them a second chance.

Katie D.,"Austin, TX",69,282,5,3.0,6/22/2012,"If you'd asked me to review this place a week ago, I would've given it one star. Why the upgrade? I don't know when they added the new menu items, but I'm so glad they did. The menu seemed to stay the same for years and got very stale. Aside from the stuff on the Jack Daniel's menu, everything else was very bland and generic. Chicken tenders? Fried shrimp? Gee, can't get those things anywhere else. The food is better now. There's some new items. I've only tried the fusion chicken skewers (available in either Japanese hibachi or Mediterranean). They're also available in steak, if that floats your boat. The hibachi flavour is basically a Japanese barbecue kinda flavour with miso and sesame seeds (the sauce for dipping is the same as the marinade); the Mediterranean is a lemon garlic marinade with tzatziki sauce. They're both so good, though I prefer the Mediterranean. Both are served with pita bread (sooo yummy) and two sides. The service still sucks, though. And the atmosphere in the place is just...blah. If you go during the day it's dead and you have to put up with noisy kids. If you go at night it's crawling with people there to drink so you have to put up with noisy adults. You can luck out in the afternoon though and maybe there won't be any kids, but usually when it's that dead, the service is even worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2?start=20

Jessica B.,"Memphis, TN",0,8,,2.0,3/21/2012,"Food is good. Service not so good. Last two times I went I sat in the bar area, which is not a good idea. First time, the waitress just wouldn't ever come back. She took our drink order, then 15 minutes finally came back to get our food order. Food came out in a timely manner, with the exception of dessert. We got one of those 2 for $10.99 ( or whatever the price is) deals where we ordered a entree and had the option of a starter or dessert. Well we chose dessert and apparently you have to decide your dessert right then. Which would make you think it would be a no brainer to get the dessert out. Nope, finished the food and finally 15 minutes later the dessert came out.  During this time we never saw our waitress. Took her forever to get our check (after we had to stop her to ask her for it) and then forever to come back to get our payment.  The second time was worse. I was meeting a friend and I got their first. Waiter came up and took my drink order. A few minutes later my friend arrived and it took him about 10 minutes to come back to get her drink. Then after that took him about 15 more minutes to come back to get our order. After this, never saw him again. Well, take that back, we saw him...at the bar, at other tables, at every other table except ours. Finally we pulled someone aside and said we can please get more drinks and our check. My friend was supposed to get a dessert and she just told them to forget about it. The person that finally helped us was really nice and did everything in a timely manner. I hope he was the one who actually got the tip I left. Only reason I gave them two stars is because I do actually like their food.

Irene R.,"Memphis, TN",214,559,90,1.0,12/22/2011,"The food is comparable with other TGIFriday's restaurants.  However the food could have been laced in gold and they'd still get a shit review from me. We were 4 adults and 1 child in a high chair. They tried to seat us a table for 4 that really should have been a table for 2.  It wasn't busy so we said we'd wait for them to clear off a larger table even though we saw plenty of clean open tables.   They asked if we would take a low table in the bar. My toddler was hungry so we just wanted to get seated.  I checked in on foursquare when we sat down, I find it a good way to keep track of how long they take to serve us.   We got our drinks quickly and put in our orders at the same time. We asked that they bring out the appetizer and the kid's meal out ASAP.  The bar area had maybe 2 other customers so we didn't think it was going to be an issue. 30 minutes later we finally got the appetizer. At which point I went up to the hostess and asked if they normally sit people in the bar and forget about them. The manager came over, apologized and then brought our food out... Always strange that our food comes out right after we complained.   We had waited 40 minutes to get our food. The manager didn't even offer to comp our drinks.  My even tempered Mother In Law was pissed (she hated to see her grandson hungry). After I complained they were out our table every 5 minutes refilling our drinks and trying to crawl up our butts.   It takes a lot for me to leave a bad tip, but since my Father In Law was paying he left a 7% tip...which is more than I would have left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2?start=40
Stephen O.,"Memphis, TN",119,58,7,1.0,4/16/2012,"Five words: ""back on the ban list"".  I gave TGI Friday's another shot this past weekend, after more than a year and a half of avoiding them even when friends have pushed the agenda pretty hard. For the sake of fellowship, I gave them one more shot. Surely they have to be doing something right, after all they stay busy... right? Right?  Not so much. In the past I have had food that tasted good at TGI Fridays, but terrible service. This time, the experience was pretty much bad all around. I am not going to speak about the wait because it was a Saturday night and I expect to have to wait to get a table for seven people. That being said, when we finally were sat it took our server a few minutes to show up and greet us. Once we were greeted, we put in our drink orders and appetizer orders. Our drinks were brought, but our food order was delayed a few minutes until our appetizers arrived, as our server was busy. I ordered a appetizer combo platter to share, and it was the best thing about my entire meal.  It came out reasonably quickly, and the food was well prepared and generously portioned for the price. You have just heard me say the last good thing about this experience. After ordering our entrees, it was about 27 minutes later and we did not have our food. Conversation had reached a lull, and every table around us had food, so we were curious what was going on. It was then that my friend spotted our server at the computer, talking to a manager. He had forgotten to put our food order in. For almost a half hour.  Of course, he did not tell us this, but it was confirmed by the fact it took another 25 minutes or so before our food came out. The manager knew what had happened, but he did not offer to comp our appetizers or in any way apologize for the horrendous delay and bad experience.  On top of all of that, my ribs had no sauce on them and were the least meaty ribs I have ever had in my life. I could go on, but no one was blown away by their food. It was mediocre at best (mine was lousy) and when we left we all agreed we would not be back.  The next time friends tell me they are going to TGI Fridays, my response will be ""you guys have fun"". I am done with this establishment for good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2?start=40
C T.,"CORDOVA, TN",0,17,3,1.0,2/14/2014,Called to place an order for a burger and the wait was extreme! 10 minutes plus. I forgot they were on the phone when they finally picked up. Terrible customer service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2?start=40
Robert W.,"Edmond, OK",11,150,38,2.0,1/5/2013,"Really bad instant coffee.  It is even bad instant!  Loud music, if you like rap, you might like it, I don't.  Food and service is always good, but I don't think that overrides the poor coffee and the loud, low-class music.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2?start=40
Jeremy C.,"Colorado Springs, CO",2,74,73,2.0,12/5/2012,It was like being back in South Florida circa 1996 without the runny noise.  Food was ok but overpriced.  Probably won't go back for another 10 years.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2?start=40
Sara G.,"Memphis, TN",0,4,,1.0,9/25/2015,"Went out for a date night with my boyfriend and we are NOT pleased. First can we start with service..? No refill for the near 2 hours we were there. When we placed our order we requested some loaded potato skins as an appetizer, then placed our main course meal. Never got the loaded potato skins because the kitchen was 'oh so busy,' but there were numerous other tables that received their loaded potato skins. We asked for the appetizer to be removed from our ticket and it was, but our food wasn't hot, which was served to us by a kitchen worker.. Hmm.. Shouldn't you be helping the oh so busy line?? The 'seasoned' fries aren't even seasoned fries.. They are regular fries.. Asked twice for ranch and ketchup. Our waitress was okay.. Not very friendly. Bathrooms were HORRIBLE. The floor was sticky as if someone pissed all over it and they smeared it around with their mop. There was piss all over EVERY toilet seat and it wasn't a pleasant smell at all.. Probably won't return here again until something major happens.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-2?start=40
