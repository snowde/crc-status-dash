Slim M.,"Atlanta, GA",19,264,173,3.0,4/30/2014,"Slooooow as molasses but everyone was nice. My drink knocked me on my butt, believe it or not. Then again, I'm a lightweight. This location closes at midnight, so that was pretty convenient, as we'd just gotten in town and thought they were closing much earlier than they did. Our server was a cool, laidback guy. My mom & I tried to be health-conscious and ordered the grilled chicken with sauteed veggies. A tomato/mozarella salad came along with it, but I don't like tomatoes, so our server traded the salad in for mashed potatoes (as if I needed the starch- ha). By the way, the ""mozarella"" did NOT taste like cheese at all, so I highly doubt that was actual cheese. It really tasted fake.  The chicken definitely tasted like it was less than 500 calories, but it was so rubbery-textured. The veggies were okay. The mashed potatoes were good, and the drink was great. This is a pretty decent location- spacious and clean. I'll give 'em a solid 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4?start=20

Jason C.,"Olive Branch, MS",2,13,2,3.0,3/16/2015,"We went on a Saturday and they seated us at one of the tables in the bar area,  which was fine.  We did the all you can eat appatizers for $12.  Many were just ok, but the BBQ chicken Flatbread was fantastic.  The waitress was friendly and great but they were understaffed. She was covering numerous tables within the bar section alone.  Which in turn made it take a long time for drinks and refills on both food and drink.  It's idiotic to not be running at full staff and coverage on the weekends day and night.  Customers don't want to be there for hours to eat and I'm sure neither does the staff.  The less customers they can turn in and out, the less tip opportunity they have a chance for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4?start=20
Corey E.,"Lakewood, CA",188,200,330,4.0,1/10/2014,"I guess you can call me a hermet because once I find something good on any menu, I typically keep ordering it over and over and over and over again. At TGI Fridays, that is exactly what I do. I always order the cajun chicken and shrimp pasta and the vanilla bean cheesecake. I'm a believer of, if its broke don't fix it. These two dishes are very good and I absolutely love them and for that I will always come here and dine.  The restaurant is very good and the service is excellent if you come to dine during lunch hours. If you come after hours for happy hour or on a busy saturday, the service isn't as good as I would like but it hasn't stopped me from coming. I give this place 4 stars and would recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4?start=20

Chanel T.,"La Mesa, CA",61,23,32,1.0,6/18/2016,"I am elated to provide this review. Management really needs to look into revamping this entire place. I will say, if they could get the review of 1/4 of a star, they would. Just known that the star is for the nice music. The service was SOOOOOOOOO SLOW!!!!! I sat and counted 3 servers walk by our table repeatedly. It took about 15 minutes before someone (the young lady who walked by the table multiple times without even saying ""hello"" or ""I'll be with you in a moment"") finally came and took our drink orders. They got the drink orders wrong lol. Not surprised. Oh, the hostess is 100% unsanitary; she sat us at a filthy table, I'm not tripping because I'm assuming she would return with a towel to wipe the table. She took one of the old used napkins and decided to wipe the table down with it. LMAO WTF. They took soooooooooo long to bring out our food. They forgot my appetizer and brought it out after we started eating our meal (she did apologize for that). The hostess had a party (1 party) waiting for 30 minutes for a table in the bar area... there were 2 large enough empty tables but there was nobody to clean them. I can say I saw one person trying to get on the lazy hostess. My advice to management... fire majority of the staff and hire new people that are eager to work but include thorough customer service training because it's what's killing the vibe. It's so bad. This location should be embarrassed with this service. The one in Cordova was great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4?start=20
Yuleidy K.,"Kissimmee, FL",56,83,23,2.0,9/8/2015,"I don't know what happened to the food here, but it has gotten worse and worse. This location seems to manage to make it worse than that. The potato skins had cheese on it that was as hard as a brick. The mozzarella sticks were fine. They are a safe choice for an appetizer if you'd like to order one. Skip the broccoli and cheese soup. It was extremely runny, salty and the broccoli tasted raw. I can't comment on any entrees since we didn't bother ordering anything else based on the poor taste of our appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4?start=20
Andy S.,"Memphis, TN",247,554,23,3.0,5/18/2013,"We recently took a group of students here for our club dinners.  I normally try to support more local restaurants.  However, I had a fine experience.  They have cheap drinks and appetizers on Thursdays, but I couldn't partake since there were students around.  I might try to go back.   This picture is my half eaten steak.  Once again, I am addicted to blue cheese, bacon, and beef.  The steak was not the most tender cut, but it was cooked to my liking.  One thing I did love about it is that it was COVERED in cheese and bacon!  I got veggies as a side to keep it somewhat healthy.   There is not a Friday's near where I live, but I may try to go back on a Thursday to try those specials next time I'm out that way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4?start=20

Jhanna F.,"Memphis, TN",0,4,,1.0,12/10/2015,"My restaurant experience usually range from mediocre to extraordinary. Tonight, my experience was extraordinarily terrible. The two hours I wasted here would have been better spent wallowing in cow manure. I stood in the lobby for 30 minutes before I was greeted. No one was at the host stand. There were at least 12 dirty tables with no one cleaning them; thusly the wait was 1 1/2 hours. The only reason my party and I were received earlier is because the other guests wised up and left. From there, my food was cold and my party ignored.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4?start=20

I asked my server why my meal only came with the steak. She said they don't do steak and lobster combo any more. But when I got my check, it did have the lobster added to my meal, and they charged me the price of the steak and lobster. That's so ridiculous. Also, we waited 15 minutes for our server to finally get to our table, but it's very slow when we came. I think I will never come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4?start=20

The J's H.,"West Hollywood, CA",28,157,40,4.0,1/10/2010,"This is review is for happy hour. I was quite disappointed that the happy hour info was not found on their site, especially since their happy hour is a national event. However, Everything turned around once we got the restaurant. We scored a high top table in the bar area and a server who promised to take care of us. At first, I was disappointed that there are only 4 drink specials per day (2 beers, 1 wine, & 1 mixed drink) on their happy hour menu, but our server quickly told us to ignore the days and order anything off the menu. I'm not sure if the other TGIFridays are this friendly, but they should definitely get rid of that bum menu. My sister & I went for $4 margaritas and mojitos, while my niece ordered some blue drink she couldn't explain to us. To quote Anchorman: That's pure gasoline. The serving size of the drinks was so generous that it was a must that we order food. During happy hour, all appetizers are half-off except for 2 that are pictured on the menu. Ain't that some sh*t? Maybe TGIF should make a whole new happy hour menu all together, plus post it to their site. There's a decent amount of food options, priced between $3.19-$4.50 during happy hour. We ordered the Tucsan Spinach Dip, priced at $3.84. It was plenty for all 3 of us to share, and we stayed for another round of drinks. The server was so nice that he would look to our table from the bar from time to time to make sure we were good. There was no waiting around here, that's some Southern hospitality!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4?start=20
Chris C.,"Brentwood, TN",11,122,8,1.0,5/16/2012,"Disgusting and the service was poor. I ate at the bar. Literally if you closed your eyes and you has the sensation you are in a strip club - or how your imagine one to be like.  The thumping base of the music was bone rattling. The smell was moldy and warmed over ""Cosmo Mix"".  The place was packed and it was under staffed so I'll give the servers a bit of a pass. Yet, my order (after 20 min) was lost and the guy shrugged and said its simply lost...... So I ordered again - a hamburger this time (less chance to screw it up) and it was greasy and very salty. By this time I would eat a Sysco hamburger and I'm pretty sure that is what it was.  While Fridays is not an epicurean utopia but I do expect decent service and edible food.

Karen R.,"Seattle, WA",65,219,114,1.0,7/20/2007,"Yes yes, I know,we should have known better... but a moment of greed, lack of creativity for coming up with anywhere else better to eat (which isn't difficult) and a weakness for some greasy over-sized chain-restaurant food left us with nothing but a bad taste in our mouth. We got there late... past 9pm.  One side of this place is a bar with counters and booths (which was packed) and the other side are regular sit-down tables and chairs - only a couple of tables taken.  When we got up to the hostess counter where two ladies stood, they did not look the least bit pleased to see us - no jokes there and yes, this is not normal for us lol.  We asked what time was their last order then asked for two tables (since they close late).  She looked onto the almost empty side and told us it would be a wait.  We were puzzled but figured maybe that side was closed already.  We didn't know Friday's time and/or seating regulation since this was our first time at this chain.  The other girl grabbed two menus and walked right by us.  My husband asked me, 'are we supposed to follow her?'.  I was just as lost so we just stood there like two blocks of wood for another 2 mins.  She didn't come back so I guess the answer was no, we weren't supposed to follow her.  We were ignored and so we left. We contacted Fridays online and gave them some input on our first experience.  Some executive actually contacted us the very next day and sent two $15 vouchers over.  He was nice and apologetic.   Ok, we decided to give it another shot.  Nah... the food is below par, the service even worst (or non-existent - the husband had to go 'find' someone to get me salad dressing) and just not worth the hassle and annoyance; even if it was free.  I know I'm not supposed to expect wonders from a chain restaurant; and I don't.  But I do expect some basic service and common courtesy in the least bit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4?start=20

Ron B.,"Memphis, TN",131,190,311,3.0,10/7/2016,"Wow, So many 1 and 2 star reviews. I decided not to be bias and just go there with my lunchtime crew. We arrived around 11:45 PM. We were greeted by two young ladies and had the choice of seating. The Restaurant was nearly empty for a Friday(No pun intended). We waited around 4 minutes before the server took drink orders. Well, they did have Drake playing louder than normal over the speakers, however, that changed once other people arrived and they changed the volume/station promptly (lol).  Lunch menus were already at the table so we all ordered our meals at the same time. I just order the Jack Daniels Turkey Burger, so mine came out 15 minutes after the order was placed. Everyone else food  arrived 2 minutes later. Other than not having a refill during my visit and the food prepers needed to learn how to cut lettuce correctly, everything else seemed to work out okay. Our server did come around to check on us a couple of times, so I cannot say it was a BAD EXPERIENCE for me. Food was not piping hot, but it did not taste like it was under a food warmer.It has been a long while since I visited this location.

Whitney H.,"Memphis, TN",2,121,49,3.0,2/19/2017,"Overall: Chain restaurant. Food expectations were low, but ""safe."" We had a gift card.  Initial: While it wasn't busy when we arrived, there was not a host or waitress at the front of the restaurant to greet or seat us. Along with our hungry party of two, there was a family waiting to be seated. In our awkward look around and wait, we had a couple of servers look at us and then scurry away. Eventually one of the servers came over and sat us at a table (not her own), only to have the hostess reappear and tell her she didn't do the rotation right. We were upfront in an empty restaurant for about 10 minutes,  for the sake of customer service the server did the right thing. The hostess was very unprofessional... but that seems to be a bit of the norm here. Product: TGIFridays is a safe food bet ( read: flash fried chicken tenders/sky-high nachos with cheese/ some warm cake with a glob of ice cream), but isn't a true testament to a Memphis culinary experience. The menu is robust enough to have an option for absolutely everyone from gluten free to vegan to Chain restaurant experimental (i.e Sriracha-anything) .  Expect a diverse crowd, and an opportunity to people watch and overhear everything. It's safe to say that TGIFridays is more of a sports bar with an attractive mozzarella/chicken tender/ fruit syrup cocktail happy hour.    Customer Service:  Shanekwa was our server and was very attentive and friendly. She answered questions and brought the food out at a timely manner. She apologized for the hostess drama from before. The Other Deets: She told us about the TGIF App that would give us a free appetizer. It's apparent that TGIFriday's Corporate is really working on getting people to use this app. Truly there is no real point unless the app let's you pre-order for pick-up, integrate with Seamless, and receive discounts. It does calculate points to get you free things, however unless you are a regular it will continue to be a download-use code-delete application. Wishlist: I had better expectations for the happy hour cocktails. I don't blame this on the bartender. Fresher ingredients and house made simple syrups will really elevate this portion of the experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4
Kevin W.,"Euless, TX",692,570,464,2.0,12/22/2016,"One day I will learn not to come back to this place. We were seated in the bar area and it took forever to get service. Those sitting directly at the bar get very prompt service but those at the tables and the bar areas are treated like discarded patrons. After 15 minutes of waiting, my party inquired about a waitress and finally got one. The waitress service was pretty good once we were acknowledged. I ordered a long island and it tasted horrible and was pretty weak. Tasted like they pre-made the drink and leave it in a huge gallon jug and disperse it out as it is ordered. The drink was weak. The food was not that good either. Got the cajun pasta and it had way too much sauce and not enough meat.  Probably will not be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4

I ordered online to go because i saw the bad reviews for the service and did not want to be bothered with bad service. Welp that didn't matter. When I arrived I stood at the front wanting for the hostess or SOMEONE to act interested enough to ask me if I needed help. 12 minutes and 5 waitresses walking right by me later, the host came from outside smelling like an ash tray and finally asked if I needed help. Mind you I walked past him when I came into the restaurant and he pretty much stared at me through the glass door while i was waiting. I get escorted to the back and he tells a girl that looks completely over being there that I have a to go order. She sucks her teeth, goes to the kitchen, gets my bag and shoved it in my hands then walked away. ( no tip for you). The restaurant looked like a hurricane went through there.

Carolyn D.,"Memphis, TN",0,21,,1.0,9/15/2017,"I give TGI Friday's a 1 rating because of how management of the restaurant have no respect for patron reservations. Today I called to make a reservation for lunch tomorrow 11 guests for 1 pm. I was told they only make reservations online. So I went to their website, clicked on reservations and followed directions. I gave the number in my party using a drop down menu of 1-12. I chose 11, the time 1:00 pm. Next, I put in my first and last name, telephone number and email address. Then clicked on book the table. The table was not booked. I got the caption ""Please put in your last name correctly"". I tried again and again, finally getting the caption 'Please put in your last name"", remove and try again. I did that, then realized something was not right. They don't know me from Adam. After about 2-3 minute I get ""We don't do reservations for more than 6 guests. Okay, so I say why do you have 12 in the drop down menu? The person answering the phone did not tell me that they only do reservations for 6 people. What a bunch of ""Crock"". I did not find this humorous, nor did I see this as a restaurant who cares about patrons. I will never try to go there again. I will tell everyone I know to never choose TGI Friday's for a lunch or dinner party. Furthermore, do not patronize the restaurant because it appears to be a poorly managed business. The food is not that great, but I am in a Birthday Club and decided to go somewhere different this year for my guests.

Samantha B.,"Collierville, TN",217,763,2516,4.0,1/25/2015,"I came here this past week with my mother and husband after a trip to Costco. I had specifically requested this place as we had all come once before with my dad as well and had an enjoyable experience. But alas, that was before I discovered Yelp, so I have no idea what I got.  Our waiter was named Jonathan and it was his first day ever as a waiter. Unlucky for him, the menu doesn't say some things, like that Parmesan fries cost a little extra when substituted. So there were a few moments where he had to run and ask something, but we were fine with it. He did a great job and my husband only trolled him a little bit, such as asking if he could get his drink to go just to watch the guy's eyes widen with uncertainty. (Hubby rarely gets his drink to go and never a soda to go).  The food itself was great. I found a number of things that appealed to me, making me want to come back and try them all. I was in an odd mood for Asian and so went with one of their asian-themed dishes, the Hibachi Chicken Skewers. I would've gotten some dumplings too if I'd seen them sooner. Hubby and Mom got different rib meals.  I adored my Hibachi Chicken Skewers. They were glazed with miso and tasted so so so sweet. The soy sauce on them mixed perfectly with the jasmine rice pilaf. I totally don't associate broccoli with Asian food, even though I grew up eating beef and broccoli, but that was a good move on their part. It tasted great both eaten separately and mixed in with everything. The grilled pita was the most surprising part of the meal but it also went well with everything.  My husband and mother were not impressed by the ribs in any way. Mom said there wasn't enough meat and my husband agreed and added that his were very dry. The only thing we all agreed on was that this place seemed unusually slow. Personally, I loved what I got and I remember having a good experience before as well. I will definitely come back, but likely with friends instead.  To Try:  - Sizzling Chicken and Spinach - Cajun Shrimp and Chicken Pasta - dumplings (in the Jack Daniel's appetizer combo) Loved:  - Hibachi Chicken Skewers - broccoli - jasmine rice pilaf - grilled pita Ok: - Half Rack Baby Back Ribs - Jack Daniel's Mixed Grill  Nah:  - Parmesan Steak Fries - Mashed Potatoes",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4

Ordered a drink at 10:50, didn't get it until 11:25; management gave no explanation besides ""we're busy"", which I get because I was a manager at one point. But, to that regard to let your associates and even yourself walk by and acknowledge ""we'll be with you in one second"" is crazy terrible customer service. To say the standards fell a bit would be comical, I've tried to support the location and ""us""... but, nope! This place is quite terrible and carries a terrible reputation as well for the customer service. I used to come when it first opened and now whenever I come into it's safe to say I'll choose someone else.  Smh, never again. Go to McDonalds...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4
Scott S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,15,8,2.0,11/1/2016,"The reviews say it all. Visited this location multiple times and disappoints every time. Sad to say but even the food is better at McDonald's.   It's funny Logan's next door is busy and this place empty, that should say enough",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4
Valencia T.,"Memphis, TN",0,14,,2.0,2/14/2016,"This restaurant is by far in need of new management. The quality of food and service needs improvement. I ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp dish....needless to say, there was NO SIZZLE!!!   When asked about this dish I was told a parton was splattered so it's no longer served hot. I suggest they change the name of the dish. Very misleading.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4
Demetrius M.,"Collierville, Memphis, TN",145,2,,1.0,7/6/2016,This used to be my favorite place for drinks and wings but after tonight I'm never coming back. I came to the bar after work for drinks with a colleague and the service was absolutely terrible. We were ignored and it took forever for the check to be brought out. Absolutely terrible service and the drinks were watered down.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4
Joel B.,"Collierville, TN",18,125,58,1.0,1/25/2015,"I had a horrible experience here. It was crowded and loud for a weekday. Then it was slooooooow. Our waiter was new but he was awesome: friendly, courteous, and patient. I wish him the best of luck.  After eating my dried out ribs with very very little meat on them, and a six ounce sirloin that had more chewy parts (fat? gristle?) than not, I felt disgusted. It was so bad I don't want to eat steak or ribs from anywhere for a while. At all. I definitely don't want to come back here. Not only that, but the food came out cold. Probably because it took forever to come out. I was having a good night before we came here and didn't want to complain about the food and force us to have to wait through another far-too-long wait. I just wanted to leave. My mother-in-law and I both agreed the ribs are far better at Chilis so that's where we plan to go next time instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4
Dina M.,"Germantown, TN",1,2,1,1.0,2/13/2016,"This is definitely the WORST restaurant I've ever been to in my entire life, I'm currently sitting in one of their dusty ass booths crying because I've been waiting for 2 hours for my food and it was DISGUSTING. The french fries are frozen, the steak was obviously microwaved, the mac and cheese is not mac and cheese. Its frozen ravioli with a slice of cheese microwaved on it. The Mahi mahi fish shit was shitty shitty. My friends ribs werent ribs at all, yalls lemonade tasted like minute maid you aint tricking NO ONE, that one star was for yalls microwaved ass spinach dip that was partially frozen. My friend also asked for a tomato mozeralla salad and it was just a bunch of baby tomatoes with some pepper in it. OVERALL if you wanna kill yourself just come here :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-memphis-4
