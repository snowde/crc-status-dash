Nsh A.,"Denton, TX",4,20,8,5.0,1/9/2018,"Although the restaurant was busier than usual, the staff was so sweet and catered to every need as fast as they could. Our waiter checked up on us and so did the manager.  The food was exceptional as always. One of my family go to dish is the sizzling chicken and shrimp with potstickers. This time around we ordered steak with mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese and the burger. It was brought to us well cooked and as ordered. Just perfect dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite

Maranda S.,"Dallas, TX",2,5,1,5.0,10/12/2017,"First 4 places were a total bust.....Thank you MIKE D at Mesquite TGIF for being a top notch waiter. Cheese sticks were perfect, ckn nachos were on point, house Margarita was damn good too. I've been boycotting TGIF bc of numerous disappointments at my last local spot (in Addison, TX) but the Mesquite joint has been a great experience.

Lana Y.,"Grand Prairie, TX",353,338,329,4.0,7/25/2016,RIBS!!! Pleasantly surprised to $10 full rack of ribs when I was only going to order a half rack of ribs for $11.60.  Thanks waiter for telling me this.  They were really good and came with yummy coleslaw and french fries.  Our waiter was pretty good and well attentive.  SLightly slow bar service on our drinks but everything else was great.  I dont go to TGI Fridays often because it doesnt have great food but it does have decent food.  We had a group of 10 people and sat seperatly but side by side on two tables.   We were greeted upon entering the business by the hostesses.  Clean bathrooms although there was a mother changing her daughters diaper on the sink/counter...made me question where the baby changing station was...but they had a seperate bathroom accross the hall that had male/female on it and it was a single room not a big bathrooms with stalls....thankfully.

Nola H.,"Mesquite, TX",0,9,1,1.0,9/17/2017,"The whole restaurant smelt like bathroom cleaner, despite the fact that the tables & floors were dingy. Service was okay but the kitchen did not know what they were doing. The breadsticks were microwaved. The celery were the ugliest, oldest 3 pieces of celery I've ever seen. & if you want boneless wings, you're better off buying the TGIF frozen bag at the grocery store.

Alexis S.,"Dallas, TX",24,49,4,1.0,9/12/2016,"Update:  Came back with family around 8 on a weekday. Apparently TGI Fridays thinks it's a club now? We were greeted with blaring music and told over a server we could barely hear that they have a live DJ tonight. We were seated on the other side of the restaurant and it was still so loud we could barely communicate orders to our server.  They also played the most inappropriate music ""Birthday Sex"" which was disturbing for my child, niece and nephew to hear. Do you guys not realize you are a restaurant and in fact families come here no matter what day of the week it is?  Our server barely came by the table I guess because she didn't want to deal with a family but it was ok once it came time to tip you I remembered that.  Please stop thinking you are a club. You are a bar and grill in the suburbs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite
Georgialle O.,"Dallas, TX",77,23,25,2.0,2/17/2017,"So here is my issue... with this particular T.G.I F.... we came in and were told 20 to 30 min wait. As we sat and waited in the waiting section with 3 other groups of people saw multiple available tables... and Im talk 5 in eye site.... let alone how many would be around the corner.  As more people and couples came in I literally watched the hostess, give random times per couple, ranging anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and a half.... with at least 5 OPEN tables. We got seated to eat and also notice people who came in after us, get thier food before we even got an appetizer. We saw 3 waiters standing around having extended conversations,  laughing, lounging,chilling. I personally got the impression that this place discriminates or is completely lost on service. I understand it a Friday night and busy.... Pick your poison there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite

Brittney W.,"Dallas, TX",16,107,156,5.0,1/7/2016,(YELP 2016 100 CHALLENGE #5) Absolutely love TGI Fridays...they are so expensive but well worth the price.  Me and my fiancé always sit at the bar that's where you can get fast service to me.   The head bartender there was really nice and gave us good services.    What I didn't know is that Fridays a daily happy with different drinks...they also have a new app which is bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeños.  Served with a glaze of their original jack Daniel sauce.  These peppers are really really good and spicy as heck.  I order the jack Daniel chicken and shrimp with cheddar mac and cheese and seasoned french fries.  My fiancé had the steak and ribs with Jack Daniel's sauce.  Everything was yummers as usual.  Also I had their house margaritas and he had the usual jack and coke. Overall everything was good and over course the bill was high...but this is one of our favorite spots to go have dinner,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite
Tisha T.,"Hutto, TX",0,3,5,1.0,3/17/2017,Arrived at 830 and it was 40 minutes before we received our first appetizer and they were cold. Endless appetizers a waste of time and money.

Kevin S.,"Dallas, TX",27,179,39,2.0,5/9/2015,"I went on a Friday night around 11 PM and when I first walked into the restaurant, it looked in a little bit of a disarray. Tables were dirty, water and liquids were spilled on the floor not cleaned.  We get to the table and see two police officers from Mesquite working security in the restaurant. What does this tell you that a restaurant has to hire security/police? It looked like a fight or a shootout could occur at any moment just based on the people that were there eating. The parking lot also seemed to have a few unsavory customers loitering  around. The food came quickly and tasted like any other Fridays restaurant.  Our waiter did a fairly good job but appeared that he was busy running around waiting on other people. I base my comparison on this restaurant based on the one they have in Addison, which the one in Addison seems more upscale in decor, staff and clientele. If I were to go back to this place, it would probably be during the daytime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite
Jeannie W.,"Garland, TX",25,10,6,1.0,6/30/2017,"Just had the most horrible and embarrassing experience using an e-gift card here! Gave the waitress my info and asked her to take $30 off on the gift card and charge the remaining amount on my actual debit card....so the waitress comes back and I realize my debit card was charged the total amount, then there was another receipt where they had taken $19.25 off my gift card, which I told the girl to take $30 off of it and I was still charged the total amount on my debit card. So after trying to explain to her several times that she was supposed to have taken $30 off of the gift card and having her tell me there was only $19.25 on it I asked for the manager who tried to tell me the same thing, I had him check the balance of the card and sure enough the other $11.75 was still on the card, so the mistake was on the part of the waitress which he still wouldn't say, I do not like attention brought to me so I never complain or bring anything up so this was actually quite embarrassing and frustrating to keep being told that I was wrong when in fact the waitress just didn't charge it the way I asked her to, and I explained 3 times when I gave her the ticket that I wanted the $30 taken off the gift card and to charge the remaining balance on my card so after wasting 20mins going back and forth with the waitress and manager I didn't even get a sorry or anything, I come here  and pick up to go often, just brought my whole family here for Fathers Day but I promise I won't return, at least not ever to this location.

I have tried multiple times to give this particular spot a chance because I love their food but the wait staff is terrible. This time the waitress wasn't focused on getting our orders correct. Her mind was elsewhere. The salads took too long to come out, the meat on my sister's sliders were not cooked all the way, and every time we asked her for something else she had this look of confusion on her face.

The first time was absolutely horrible the worst meal I had in a long time.  Super over cooked and I waited about 30 minutes to receive it. I called and complained to manager Isreal. He offered to replace the meal.  I went back a few days later during the lunch hour and had the absolute BEST salmon I've ever had from there.  I called and raved to manager Alan about the dish.  I raved about it so much my husband tried to surprise me with it tonight for dinner.  Obviously the same cook from 8 days ago simply horrible.  I actually was going to bring it back but ended up throwing up in the container.  So instead I called back and spoke with Jenni the MOD and all she said was there are different staff in the morning and evening and she's heard the same complaint before.  I told her I just meal to be right instead she offered me a partial credit and said they don't replace meals here.  Really.  As much as I have eaten at this location this is my second bad experience but the way it was handled this time I can assure you it will be my last visit.  Good luck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite?start=40

Minus the rest of the wait staff; blowing whistles and horns In the kitchen that we were placed right next to. The food was not as I previously remembered about Fridays... Don't get sea food...the salmon was topped with ""crab"" that was basically mush and some strange stuffing? The salmon itself tasted way fishy and semi frozen. The veggies were cold...the mashed potatoes were decent. My boy friends shrimp pasta was a chunky shrimp mess...Maybe if we had ordered a ""jack daniels"" item that they brand and promote so much the experience may have been a little better.

selena k.,"Mesquite, TX",3,25,,2.0,3/1/2010,"Yes, I know- its Friday's- how I ended up here on a Saturday night and didn't even have the kiddos with me still floors me.  With the kids at Mimi's for the night, my husband and I decided to have a night out alone. We wanted a quick dinner, nothing fancy, no waiting, just food since it was about six and we were hungry.  We get seated within two minutes and I decided to use the restroom. It was probably one of the dirtiest restrooms I've been in. No toilet seat covers, water everywhere, paper towels thrown about. Disgusting. Wash my hands (twice) and head on out to the table. Waiter had brought my husband's lemonade and I just ordered water. No offer of a lemon and he was busy so I let it be. I did taste my husband's lemonade and it literally stunk- like had a funny smell. I'll stick to the water, which had its own funky taste. We decide to do the 3 course meal for 12.99- which of course is a fabulous deal! I ordered spinach artichoke dip for appetizer and my husband ordered cheesesticks for his appetizer. Both were covered in chives and parsley. I didnt mind mine so much on the dip but he wasn't having it on his cheesesticks, took him a while to rake it off.  For entrees, I ordered a 6 oz sirloin with loaded mashed potatoes and baked beans. My steak came out covered in some sort of garlic parmesan butter sauce which was not mentioned on the menu. I don't handle butter well and had to push it off to the side as much as I could. Potatoes were meh and the baked beans were bushs out of a can- and everything was covered in chives and parsley again. You are not a five star resort- quit trying to make everything classy. My steak was cooked perfect but I had to wait quite a while to get silverware and steak sauce to begin my meal so I have a feeling it got tough from sitting and waiting.  My husband ordered the sizzling chicken and cheese skillet which he just loves and of course loved again that night, no complaints other than the obessing of the chives and parsley.  For dessert, I ordered the Brownie Obsession- which of course was great and he got Peanut Butter Pie which he loved.  For 30 we went home with 4 to go boxes of food and had a quick dinner.  Here's the kicker-Check my account today- Fridays has charged me 30 for one meal and 30.60 for another meal. Its on my account twice. I called them today and they said sometimes the server inaccurately puts it in and voids it and then rerings it. Could they have notified me at the restaurant we accidentally ran your card twice? Obviously not- so now I have to wait 2 days to see if it gets taken off and if not call the bank and dispute charge and call Fridays to get a refund. What a mess!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite?start=40

After 5 mins of waiting more people began to come and another lady came ro the front to write doen names. Mind you the first lady is still at the door and im looking right at her. Table started to become available and they start calling the names on the list. My husband got up to asked why people who came after us were being seated first and she tried to act like she didn't remember us coming in. When it is finally our turn we get put a table in the back with the light bulb out. Its dark outside  at this point so we can barely see our menu. I ask if we could be moved.

Jennifer B.,"Rusk, TX",3,5,,3.0,2/22/2015,"We were tired and hungry from being on the road most of the day. So we stopped here last night, and the only down side of this experience was the hostess, who had us running all over the restaurant. We had a small child with us, and we specifically asked for a high chair right off the bat. She put us at a table at first and then offered us a booster chair (which by looking at him, one would know he is too small for a booster chair) When we asked again for a high chair she took us back to the waiting area and said it would be five minutes. Then a couple of seconds later, she took us to a table in a high traffic area, and then changed her mind and started to take us back to the waiting area and then at the last minute put us somewhere where our son would be out of the way of patrons and hot food coming from the kitchen. Which that was a very good idea. Now, on to the good part. Our waiter (a younger fella with glasses) was very friendly and attentive. The food was delicious, only bad part was the order had gotten mixed up and my husband recieved the wrong steak (he ordered medium rare and had recieved a very medium well steak).

Sarah B.,"Los Angeles, CA",26,31,1,1.0,2/17/2014,"Worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. I can deal with slow service, and I can even deal with bad service - but I do not tolerate rude service that was completely unwarranted. There is one server that's good there - but out of my three times visiting during a business trip, the first was with the good server, and the other two were with two different servers who are complete failures. They downsold, they provided bitchy and slow service. The food is good - but to me, it's not worth the treatment you get from the bottom of the barrel. I thought the second time might have been a fluke, so I returned for the third - but I didn't even stay past the drink delivery, I walked myself out. This was after we had not received our drink orders for 30 minutes, and then at the delivery, the server (RJ?) threw down our straws on the table. I said, ""Oh, no no."" and walked out. If you want to visit this restaurant, I would just google something similar somewhere else. There are plenty of other places to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite?start=20
Lucy R.,"Mesquite, TX",26,3,,1.0,9/7/2013,"I was once a long time customer of this restaurant.  The prices were resonable for my budget, and the waitstaff and host staff were friendly. However in the last 2-3 years this has gone dramatically down hill, and today at lunch was the rock bottom depth to cause me to now say that my 15+ year patronage of this restraunt has now come to a complete close. To start off the problems several years ago, the host staff were throwing empty bottles into the air and hitting patrons with them.  When reporting to the managment what occured, the management responded with ""well, the other customers like to see them have fun.""  Patrons do not come into restraunts to get beat on the head with bottles of liquer as entertainment.  The host/ess is not Gallagher. Then on a following visit when going in with my mother, who is on a cane and honestly is in pain to walk at any given time, the host (a different one from the one above), made us walk past 10-15 empty tables to the back near the kitchen and bathroom.  When we brought this up to the attention of the waitstaff and requested a manager, the response was ""well, it was my turn to get a table.""  If it is that crucial that the waitstaff get a table on a specific rotation then they need to be the ones flexible enough to move the 40 feet to a different table.  Handicapped clientele need to be treated appropriately, not treated like afterthoughts. These problems were minuscule to what just occurred though.  While I had thought perhaps that while the service left chasms of desire, the food was acceptable to be ordered and brought home.  I did not expect to find the (wait for it... ) roach attached to the french fry I was 6 inches from putting in my mouth before seeing it out of the corner of my eye and thinking it was a burnt edge. I again called to report the issue to the management, and all I got was ""this never happens"".  Ladies and gentlemen, roaches are not solitary creatures.  They do not come individually.  If you have one, you have a hundred.  If you have a hundred, you have a thousand.  I think what was a more appropriate statement was that it has never been reported.  I almost didn't report it, but decided they needed to know from me first hand. Now, to call the health department. TL;DR: TGI Fridays in Mesquite on Towne Crossing Blvd employs unprofessional, inconsiderate staff, unconcerned management, and very bad food hygiene and cleanliness practices.  Don't eat here unless you enjoy taking your health and well-being for granted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite?start=20
Fuk Y.,"San Antonio, TX",23,440,162,1.0,1/2/2015,"Warning...$5 bonus cannot be used for Tri Ribs. Manager explained to me that $10 is a promotional price because it will be $16 when it gets placed on the menu. Seriously, who will pay $16 for half a rack of ribs with 3 different just OK bbq sauces.    Please stick to your Jack Daniel sauce. 1 star for the bad manager who did not understand the a simple customer service rule.  5 stars for Jack Daniel sauce, the only thing that keeps bringing me back to Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite?start=20
Feliza P.,"Mesquite, TX",3,7,1,5.0,3/6/2015,"Whenever I am in the mood to go out for a late night dinner but want to stay close to home, I usually end up here. The first time I dined at this location was about two months ago & I had the sweetest server, whom I always request for whenever I go in :) His name is Jonanthan & I highly recommend him! Anyways, even when I didn't have Jonanthan as a server, everyone who has waited on me has always been friendly & helpful. The food has always came out fresh, fast, & most importantly, delicious. I don't see why there are bad reviews because my experiences here has always been fantastic & spot on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite?start=20
Bianca L.,"Garland, TX",6,186,716,4.0,1/6/2014,We ate here on New Year's Eve and it was delicious.  We had the grilled chicken skewers and they were great.  I highly recommend it.  We would certainly return!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite?start=20

Brandi B.,"Duncanville, TX",98,132,170,4.0,3/22/2014,Went back to Friday's for that special and I was disappointed that they didn't have it any more. Now it's pick 2 for 13.99 on the low end or pick 2 for 15.99 on the high end... went to the one in Cedar Hill they had a live dj on friday night's and I felt like I was in the club! over all the food was good and so was the entertainment. a great place for first date because its not to high and not that cheap either!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite?start=20

Jon B.,"Santa Rosa Beach, FL",13,8,1,2.0,5/22/2014,"Not impressed this visit but staff was friendly and professional. We order mozzarella sticks for an appetizer but never received them. The steak I ordered medium came out deep red and cool to the touch in the middle. When it came back after throwing it back on the grill, it was well done with no color of pink in it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite?start=20
Jodi C.,"Mesquite, TX",409,209,111,4.0,12/8/2011,"We had a great meal here, with a very friendly waitress. We went because we had a bogo coupon, so it made it really cheap.  I ordered a barbeque pork sandwich which was really good. I actually was hungry for a hamburger, but thought I should break out and try something different. My husband ordered a hamburger, and we ended up trading (pretty much sharing).  Just before we left a sweet friend came in with her sister, so I was able to help them save by forwarding the coupon to them. (it said it could be shared) All in all, it was a really nice evening!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite?start=20
Melissa W.,"Dallas, TX",46,59,18,2.0,4/16/2012,"The only reason I give this place two stars instead of one, is because my server, Richard, was amazing. He was attentive and kind and had fantastic menu knowledge. The only time I will ever come to Friday's is when a friend of mine suggests it or a family member wants to go their. Otherwise, I just don't go. Here are the reasons why: The food is sub-par. The meat is always over cooked, the flavors are watered down, or the flavor combinations are disgusting. The drinks are ok. The service has always been whatever, and the ambiance is.... lacking. I think it's really trashy that I can go to a bar in downtown Dallas and not have to see one cop there the entire night, but every time I go into Friday's, there is a cop there for SOME reason. The last time I went in with a group of friends, I dreaded it. But we got a fantastic waiter who knew the menu and directed me towards something that I may actually like. Cajun Pasta Alfredo with Chicken and Shrimp. I had this once when they were test-marketing it and hated it, but I decided to give it another go because Richard, our server, was insistent that it was delicious. I'm glad I did because it was. The protein was cooked properly and the sauce was flavorful. It could have used less grease though, just saying. He also suggested the Sangria. Huge hit with me. It was delicious. Now I won't dread Friday's so much when dragged in there, but I will ALWAYS ask for Richard. He is just GREAT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite?start=20
Patrick S.,"Garland, TX",0,16,8,2.0,8/11/2009,"I have reduced my rating by one star because Friday's does not publish their nutritional information. The food is usually good, but the huge selection can be overwhelming. To compensate, I usually order a burger. It's hard to go wrong there.  We ate here Sunday after church, and have no complaints about anything. The service was decent, the noise level was bearable and we had no wait at all. Everyone enjoyed their food.  The best part, and the reason we keep coming back are the terrific coupons available. I am a member of their Stripes program, where I get one stripe for each dollar spent, with a free appetizer when it gets over 100 stripes. We also had a coupon with $5 off each ""buddy"" I brought with me, so we saved $15 off the bill. Can't beat that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-mesquite?start=20
