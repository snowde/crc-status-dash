Juan N.,"Lawrence, MA",0,35,,1.0,7/7/2017,Ordered the rib-eye plate and I was very disappointed. It looked like they found one of those TV Dinners at the supermarket and threw it in the microwave. The meat was very dry. NOT RECOMMENDED. Bad way to spend $20+,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=20

Ronnie M.,"Plaistow, NH",45,21,35,1.0,8/9/2015,"Well TGIF, once again you failed us!! We go and stop in for dinner and drinks.  We walk into the bar area and it took 6 minutes for us to be acknowledged by the bar staff.  The bar MANAGER (named Randy) was told by an employee that we have been waiting to order! He finally comes over and I just ask for a Diet Coke, he brings it over and I ask how much. At this point I think he was aware of our wait time, so he said no charge. Well, I took to sips and walked out the door. NOT GOOD TGIF in Methuen, Ma.!!!!!! Once again another disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=20
Emmy C.,"Lawrence, MA",1,8,2,1.0,9/2/2016,"This is the 2nd time I've come here and the food has been horrible. This place is not like it used to be. I ordered the new bruschetta shrimp pasta and it tasted like leftovers. So I Sent it back for the chicken pasta and  It literally tasted like they took the shrimp out, added the chicken and microwaved it and just threw it in a plate. Just horrible!! Left nauseas and disgusted. NEVER GOING BACK EVER!!! Horrible horrible!!!! The kids meals were tiny n didn't fill them whatsoever. Also the food came out in about 5-7 mins which was the first red flag for me. The food was not fresh! I'm sick to my stomach! I gave one star but wish I could give none! Such a disappointment. The kids came home hungry n I came back sick. Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=20
Lorraine O.,"Salem, NH",0,8,,1.0,8/31/2016,"So disappointed in this Friday's restaurant. First of all, when I ordered my meal with mashed potatoes, I got them with cheese on them.  I asked the server why since it didn't have it that way on the menu and he said mashed potatoes ALWAYS come with cheese. I told him since I was allergic to cheese that it should be stated on the menu that they come like that. Then he told me I couldn't get them without, that all the potatoes are pre-made like that. Must say that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of. So he brought me rice instead. At least I think it was rice. It tasted like old wax paper. Which was a nice side for a tiny $20 steak that was so dry I could have filed my nails with it! My family and I will not be returning!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=20

Nicole W.,"Haverhill, MA",157,228,256,1.0,7/1/2016,"My family (after traveling all day to visit me) and I had a late start to getting dinner. Because it was a weeknight everything closed at 10 and it was 9:15 by the time we hit the road to search for something. I recalled Friday's being here so I was hopeful we could celebrate the start to a family vacation with solid chain level food and drinks. We arrived and saw from outside that there was a  dj playing which made the environment more lively.  We were seated at a booth and awaited our server. And waited and waited. We easily went through 2 songs (karaoke night apparently) and the dj talking to the crowd and still nothing. We also had some ass throwing crumpled straw wrappers at us. We couldn't pinpoint who was doing it because it came from behind. When our server finally came she unenthusiastically asked if we were ready to order, never volunteering her name. We asked if we could first move to a different table explaining that someone was throwing trash at us. She said she would check. So we waited. And then she walked right by us into the kitchen so I just figured she was asking a manager. Nope she came out with an order or fries for the table next to us. We then had to get her attention and ask her what was going on. At this point we were fed up and ready to go. So as she told us the other tables were unavailable and gave us so bs nonsense we got up and told her to forget it. We left.  Rude, awful service. I hope to never return here for any reason.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=20

Rick G.,"Methuen, MA",2,21,3,1.0,1/10/2016,"Today's visit didn't even deserve one star. Our server was prompt to take our drink order, however he admiringly forgot to bring them over. The restaurant wasn't crowded, so the length of time from ordering the enter to it coming out of the kitchen was unacceptable. When it did arrive, we asked the runner to bring us flatware as we had none. She disappeared. After a couple of minutes, I went to the hostess and asked her for some, and she brought them within a few minutes.   The food: My husband's NY Strip was more medium well than medium rare, and the Jack Daniels dipping sauce was missing for the shrimp. I was served bourbon chicken instead of the bourbon mahi mahi because the server confessed he hit the wrong button when he placed the order. I thought I just had overlooked fish, when in fact it was dry chicken. My biggest regret is leaving any tip, even if it was only $5.00.  We stopped going to TGI Fridays in Danvers a few years ago because if horrific service, and that we now live closest to the Methuen location.  I think it's time to check out Red Robin at the Mall at Rockingham, or back to the Texas Roadhouse, where we've always had a delicious meal and excellent service. There are enough restaurants in the area, not to ever have to go back to TGI Fridays at The Loop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=20

Mike B.,"Raleigh, NC",196,35,30,4.0,11/12/2015,"I was a very frequent visitor here before moving out of town. It is a great place to go to watch the game. There are a ton of TVs in the bar area and they have an alright beer selection (nothing too exciting). They have a tall Long Island that I got fairly regularly because you can't really beat it for the price.  I used to get all their appetizer specials very often. Unfortunately, they did away with the specials not too long ago and now they have a bottomless app deal. It isn't too bad but not the same as before. It's hard to hold that against them though because the change came from corporate.  The staff is average or slightly above. I only interacted with the manager one or two times in my many visits but both experiences were positive. The bar tenders were generally pretty personable.  Overall pretty solid. 4 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=20
Mariah E.,"Santa Cruz, CA",1,34,8,2.0,7/21/2015,"I don't have high expectations for ""fast casual"" restaurants. However, I do expect them to be clean. We were first seated at a dirty table, and moved when I asked that it be wiped down (it was covered in sauces). Our second table was located near a hallway that passed behind the bar to the bathroom. The hallway smelled terrible (damp and stale), and therefore we could catch whiffs from our seats. I went to the bathroom and it was disgusting. The floor was wet and sticky, and covered in toilet paper. It smelled moldy. I would have left except that there aren't many options in this plaza, we had come from a movie, and we were starving.  The food was surprisingly good. The burger was a normal burger, and the salad i had was good. Even the ahi tuna (not sure why I got that at essentially a fast food restaurant, but hey, I'm crazy) was good, but it was very cold so I'm guessing it arrived seared and frozen. Either way, it tasted good, so the food was a win.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=20
Karen S.,"Methuen, MA",2,22,,3.0,5/18/2016,"This place is good as far as chains go. The food is usually pretty steady. However, we get takeout a lot, because we have kids at home and can't get out much. The takeout process is just awful. I'm sitting here waiting for my boyfriend to pick up two salads, and he has been gone for 45 minutes. Ordered on the phone to try to get a head start on the process since they are notoriously so slow. Waited about 25 minutes after getting to the restaurant. So much for the head start! Paid for the order after the 25 minutes. He's still sitting there after paying for the order 15 minutes ago! The staff makes several trips back and forth to who knows where to make the payments and then he just sits. It's making me really want to take this restaurant off our list. Such a bummer because the Cobb salad is really good. You shouldn't offer takeout if you don't have an efficient process for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=20
Alex M.,"Tewksbury, MA",0,19,18,1.0,10/9/2016,"What a terrible experience we had tonight. I usually have a fine experience but this place has lost my business after tonight. Chose this place for a drink and some food seeing that they were open til 1 AM. Got there around midnight, took a while to be seated even though there were plenty of tables. Finally seated, our waitress comes over and ask if we want anything to drink. We asked her when the bar/kitchen close and she said we had appx 10 mins to put an order in. She comes back and we put a food and drink order in. Our drinks come from a different waitress along with a check for only our drinks. In the mean time, two friends met us there at 12:30 but the door was locked. We tried to tell our waitress that they weren't ordering anything as we already told them last call passed, but they refused to let them in. Finally, at 1 AM, the second waitress comes to collect the tab and we ask about the food. She says ""Oh that's awkward, someone was supposed to tell you that your order couldn't be put in,"" and walks away with our tab. In the mean time, a table that got there AFTER us just received their food... We left after being cashed out. We wouldn't have ordered drinks if we knew we weren't ever going to get our food and they weren't gonna let our friends in just to sit with us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=20

Jocelyn J.,"Methuen, MA",7,2,,1.0,10/14/2017,"my family and i went to dinner tonight, we waited 20 minutes to be seated when we were told the wait was 3 minutes, i had to go to the desk again to ask what the wait was and the book was stuck inside of a drawer, the host was just sitting there, she then seated us, we waited 45 minutes for our food, i wouldn't mind if it was a busy packed place but it was not busy by any means. the best part of the night, was tendering my bill, i had a 25$ gift card to put towards my bill, my waiter then took another 20 minutes to come back for me to sign the check to tell me i only have 1$ and change left on the gift card, which wasn't true. i called customer service as i stepped out of the door and was told that a server had used 23$ and change of the gift card tonight and it was swiped to another bill, the manager did not seemed to concerned about my issue when i went back and explained everything that had happened, he did not reimburse me the whole bill like should have been done, only the 25$ gift card of confusion, through all this confusion and aggravation, the food was terrible, the shrimp tasted like plastic.  i have seen fridays change every time i go,down hill down hill every time,  and i will not be back. People should be able to trust the server with their debit cards, credit cards, OR a gift card. not to be used on someone else's bill.

Betty M.,"Nashua, NH",0,59,28,2.0,1/20/2016,"TERRIBLE SERVICE - We sat at a high top in the bar area, waited 10-15 minutes before the waitress came over to greet us and get drink orders. Thought things were looking up when drinks came quickly (although we didn't order anything fancy) food order was taken which was also served quickly (but again was nothing that should take long). She checked on our table 5 mins into our meal, then disappeared. This is when everything went downhill fast.  We had to track down our own ketchup, dropped my fork had to find my own replacement, needed refills on our drinks had to find a different waitress to get ours so we could get another drink. Almost everyone was finished with their meals before we got our first refills on our drinks. When she delivered the drinks she started to walk away without taking the empty glasses or dishes. We had to ask her to clear the table, her response ""oh yeah I guess""  We finished our drinks, would have had another one but AGAIN couldn't find her, had to look for another waitress to get our bill. When she showed up with it finally, her apology was ""sorry I was talking"" I don't need the waitress to be at my table every 5 mins but I shouldn't have to get a different server to find you because you're not even in the area for an extended amount of time. When I can't find you for 30 minutes because you're talking in the kitchen, obviously the service industry is not for you. The only reason I did not give a 1 star is because we had a lot of fun playing trivia. And would probably be the only reason we go back. This was the only saving grace of our dining experience.

Julie H.,"Haverhill, MA",146,598,74,3.0,11/22/2014,The food is what you'd expect from an American food chain. It's hit or miss on the menu. I usually get the turkey burger. You can't really screw that up too bad.  The staff are mostly young and inexperienced and that can be either good or bad depending on who you get. The food was what I expected and tasted good.

Also ordered potato skins-good as well, and the pretzel bread-good. For my dinner I ordered Cajun Pasta with Shrimp and Chicken-really really good. Ordered the moscato wine for 3 as it was half-price due to Mother's Day weekend. Service was pretty good-our waiter was pretty attentive and checked in every now and then. However, I must say that our table/booth was still wet when we sat on it-would've nice if the host would've just warned us and asked us to wait a few more minutes after they cleaned it off.

Our waitress took forever to come and then she took our order and never came back. We waited 45 min untill I finally said something on where the heck is our food not to mention took over 20 min to get a drink. Then she said it's coming in a rude attitude like why are we even asking for food 45 min late??? Are you kidding me? Well it didn't matter because another 15 minutes went by and still nothing so I asked the hostess to get a manager since my waitress was nowhere to be found. Since the manager didn't come for a while I asked the hostess ok I'll pay for our drinks but we're leaving. Then the manager came and just stared at us after I explained abd he's like ok do you want desert? He sounded clueless without even being apologetic. 10 min later the food came. After I got the bill I wanted to see if I was exaggerating about the time and I wasn't!!!!!! After I told the waiter the time on the slip she's like oh ya well I did see the red in the back but the kitchen sucks so I can't do anything.

Louis T.,"Londonderry, NH",25,33,3,2.0,7/15/2015,"Went here before a scheduled umpire assignment, hoping to catch a good, quick appetizer before the game. What I got was a cold, carelessly prepared plate of the bbq boneless wings....which were supposedly served endlessly. For me, 1 sampling was enough, as the bleu cheese dressing was watery, celery sticks had a wilted, brown end to them. After consulting with the sever about this bad experience , she did nothing but charge me for the full $10.99 price tag. I did not have time to ask for the manager meeting or pursue this awful service experience (waitress took at least 10 minutes to check on me for a replacement batch of blue cheese dressing.) By that time my cold wings were almost finished. When she returned, I just told her to get me the check. She did apologize for my bad experience. I DID NOT APOLOGIZE FOR THE MISSING TIP!

We didn't seem to wait long, but when both apps and meal came, the dish was barely warm and cheeses congealed. I honestly felt like it was cooked quick and sat under a broken heat lamp long before it was brought to the table. Almost as if the food was previously frozen, but they didn't microwave it long enough. My wife had a 'sizzling chicken' plate that never saw a single flame. My cheese burger seemed to have all the flavors had it been consumed a half hour ago... Server was a clueless young man who constantly felt the need to apologize for the slow beverage retrieval (which likely explains the watered down flavor).

larry g.,"Salem, NH",1,21,7,3.0,5/8/2009,"Friday's is a chain. This seems to be the rule here in Methuen, at least on Pleasant St. There is a separate lounge on one side of the restaurant, and a dining room on the other side  (this is historical, when smoking was allowed in Massachusetts). As a chain, the food is decent and the drinks are good. Their specials offer good value (right now, a promo for $5 sandwiches and salads is insane!).  This Friday's fits the mold of nearly every other Friday's that I've visited. I prefer to eat and drink in the lounge here. The tables are nice and the bar chairs are decent.  The place is usually noisy, which is part of the atmosphere of every Friday's restaurant. Would I recommend this place?  Well, if going to a chain doesn't turn you off, then this is a pretty good place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=60
Linda M.,"North Andover, MA",0,23,,2.0,8/10/2012,"Typical chain. By that I mean:  everything is pre-prepared (for consistency and cost management) and heated for you when you order it.    If you like that, feel free to go.   There are some meal deals that are reasonably priced but if you don't like any of the choices the rest of the menu is a rip-off.   Our food was not heated enough, had to be sent back ( I'll admit, doing that always scares me, but who wants to eat a cold meal? ) Upside: the fried green beans appetizer were a bit different and good                The salty caramel dessert was awesome. Just an OK choice if you're stuck on where to go and are in the area.  We had limited time before a movie and left full and not broke.  Hence,  one star for convenience and the other for the meal deal (13.

The host was nowhere to be seen, as it would turn out because they were short-handed and incapable of handling incoming customers. When we did get seated in the bar, with two 4-year-olds, our server was great, but that rib bone went unnnoticed our entire meal. I had to speak to the manager and point it out over an hour later before it was addressed.

The restaurant was very busy with many kids.  We were seated immediately but it took a while (about 10 minutes) before we were acknowledged by our waitress who said she was new. I had received a free appetizer voucher quiet sometime ago but before ordering an app, we asked our waitress if the voucher was valid and which appetizers it applied to since there were different sizes of appetizers on about 3 different pages.    She had to ask someone so she disappeared and about 5 minutes later returned and said it was valid up to $8 on any appetizer. She then took our drink orders (tap water) while we decided on our lunch.  We decided on the Jack Daniels appetizer sampler (baby back ribs, popcorn shrimp, fried chicken tenders), Mediterranean Mahi Mahi wrap and the Chipotle Chicken salad. It took about 10 minutes for the appetizer to arrive.  The ribs were excellent, tender and flavorful, the chicken tenders were tender and tasty but had quite a lot of batter.  The shrimp was cold and not great. Shortly before finishing our appetizers, the balance of our lunch arrived. The salad was good, fresh greens and fairly tender chicken. The mahi mahi was good, the sauce in the wrap was very good. Fries ... ok.    Overall, average.

Jared P.,"Dracut, MA",0,4,,1.0,5/7/2017,"HORRIBLE! This experience ranks in my top 5 worst eating experiences ever. It was actually so bad that I had to walk out before even getting my food. First, the potato skins that we ordered was not made the way that the menu says. The menu CLEARLY says that the the potato skins are topped with green onions. Absolutely no green onions. Ok, that is not a deal breaker as no one in my family cares for the green onions, but if you are going to advertise something then actually make it the way it was advertised. What really got on my nerves was that the bacon on it was still RAW. The slice of cheese (yes, slice, not shredded) wasn't even melted. I literally peeled off the cheese to show the waitress. So then came out drinks. Two of my children had order blue raspberry slushies. The drinks that they got was a blue drink with just 2 inches of crushed ice on the top. I slushie is supposed to be a frozen drink... the whole thing. It wasn't even blended, just a blue drink topped with crushed ice. The waitress tried to tell us it was because that it started melting. It should have been served to my children still completely full of frozen bits. We had gotten a chocolate milk for our daughter. They didn't even bother to stir it before bringing it out. There was just the chocolate sitting at the bottom. How freaking lazy are these people? I complained to the waitress about these things and she started getting nasty with me saying that I should not complain to her. Like WTF? Lady, are you stupid? This is your job. You are the middleman. When things are not done correctly I am not going to go and hunt down the 12 different people that screwed up the food and were too stoned to put in any effort. This is YOUR job. YOU are the person that I am supposed to complain too. I got out to eat between 15 to 25 times a week. I rarely ever have to complain about the food. But this was beyond pathetic. I did not want to even bother waiting for my meal because god knows that I was likely going to have to cook the steak myself. Hell, the last that I felt the need to directly complain about the food that was served to me was over 2 years ago. I won't go and complain about a single little thing, but when the food is not as advertised, comes out not cooked, and they are even screwing up the darn drinks then we have a big problem. This is the first time that I have been seated in a place and decided to walk out before getting my food. That says quite a lot right there. My wife and I ate here once about 2 years ago and we never came back. As we were waiting for our starter and drinks, we were questioning why we never did come back in the past 2 years. Well, I certainly know why now. I remember I used to love eating at this chain (different location though) over a decade ago. The service and food quality has gone down hill horribly. I believe part of the reason for this is now how they advertise endless appetizers. They have to make up for all the cost of people ordering so many appetizers that they decided to just make it as cheap as possible. I am willing to bet that they NEVER put the green onions on the potato skins anymore and only bother once someone says something about it. To me, that is screwing your customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen

Four pieces of shrimpy shrimp and two small scoops of potatoes.

We waited to order main dish, because like all chains the appetizer will come and two minutes later the main dish. This was a huge mistake. My wife's coke comes 10 minutes later but not mine, so at this time I just ask for a water. Five minutes later my beer arrives but no water. Guess no water or coke for me, at least my wife is driving for safety. 30 minutes after that we finally see our server again who says she will check on mozzarella sticks and to refill wifes coke. At this point it is obvious she forgot to put appetizer order in. So finally after an hour we have our appetizer and make main dish order which arrives 50 minutes later. The only time the server was attentive was when we were about to leave after being there for almost 2.5 hours, make a good last impression for a good tip! As for the food, well yeah? Obviously this location has taken cost cutting measures. The mozzerella stcks were at least hot and edible but definitely looked prefab. I ordered the Jack Daniels ribs and well the line order cook just didn't try, it looked like they threw them in a microwave and served them. My wife ordered a chicken cheese skillet thing and I was in awe of how unappetizing it looked. The cheese should be on top and not burnt and caked on the skillet. We ate what we could of the food and left. Still hungry we stopped at the BK drive through across the street. My wife and I have been to this location several times before as well as other TGI Fridays and have not been dissatisfied. The quality of service this time wouldn't keep us from coming back as I think this was an isolated incident, there was another server working her tail off. The food though has definitely gone downhill and will keep us from coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=40
Lauren J.,"Vacaville, CA",0,7,3,1.0,2/22/2016,"Normally we love TGI Friday's but after my boyfriend and I ate at this location on Saturday night, we both contracted horrible food poisoning. We both had burgers (cooked well) and I have been in the bathroom ever since. Service was great, drinks were prompt. Needless to say, it will be a long time before I have a burger again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=40
Eddie M.,"North Andover, MA",61,11,,1.0,3/25/2013,"No clue how this place is still in business. I gave it a second chance.  First contact from the waitress took over 10 minutes, after the drink order (soda) another 10 minutes. From the sit down, to the drinks, 20 minutes. Place was DEAD as well.  Food was bland, no seasoning or flavor. My daughter wanted butter on her kids meal, never got it. Asked another waitress that we flagged down, she never came back. We were there for almost 2 hours, and I didn't even eat half of my pulled pork sandwich.  They could send me 100% off coupon and I'd rather go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=40
Linda T.,"Lowell, MA",59,139,428,5.0,8/1/2011,"I swore I wrote a review for this place before, guess not! Love, love, love TGI Friday's food! Came hungry &  left satisfied! My bf and I started off w/ the sesame jack chicken strips and fried mozzarella; both were so good! They gave a pretty good portion since we were both full before our main entree even came out! My bf got the southwest burger which he liked a lot and I forgot what I got was called, but it had chicken, pasta, and mozzarella balls in it [wasn't all that] & we finished with an Oreo madness. The place had a lot of character. It was very loud and busy but the staff were extremely nice! Although our waitress took forever between the appetizer, main entree, and dessert; I didn't mind so much, actually felt kind of bad she was so busy. I simply love it for the Good Food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=80
Bill C.,"Methuen, MA",35,43,9,5.0,3/28/2009,"OK I have been here a lot and have had good and bad experiences. THIS IS A REVIEW OF LATE NIGHT BAR I am especially excited because until april 30th, they have coupons that are buy ANY drink at the bar, get an appetizer for ONE CENT. Order a coke and an app for less than $3 (tip on full bill ya douche). I went the other night, had two tall blue moons and the new slidders apps which was actually WICKED good and it was less than $10.  They are open late (kitchen till 1230am bar till 1), have some pretty hot talent (and some pigs too) and the bar specials are excellent. $2 drafts, $4 martini's/long island ice tea's. Def a late night hot spot. To get this coupon, just google tgi frida's apps. OR message me and I'll send it to you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=80
Kristi Y.,"Windham, NH",25,160,15,1.0,1/29/2011,"Went on a friday night to meet some friends. Sat at a table near the door, all the people waiting near the door were watching us the whole time. The service was not too good, and the food was terrible. It was cold, the portions were small and ugly. I know its a chain and I wasn't expecting much, but we were really disappointed.

Jennifer R.,"Dover, NH",1,29,1,2.0,10/30/2011,"Don't bother, it's just ok. We went in on a Fri night around 9pm and sat at the bar for an app. Service was very slow and bar was only about half full. Split some Jack Daniels ribs, chicken, and shrimp platter. Not discusting or anything, just ok. I think it was about $14. Ladies room had BAD smell both times I used it (hey, I was also having those tall beers). like a dirty diaper exploded or something. This place also seems to attract what I call ""Joeys"", those people who look like rejects from Jersey Shore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=80
Jamie Z.,"Lawrence, MA",4,7,,1.0,5/23/2008,"Probably  the worst place to go if you don't want your food deep fried or covered in cheese. It was especially discouraging to find out the majority of their food is frozen as is, and just heated up before it's served. We (LittleBoyBigTruck and I) went here with a group of friends, six in total. One was a vegetarian and I am vegan- and there was one item on the menu we could choose from, and it still had to be modified (But it was the only one that -could- be modified, as everything else was already frozen as it appeared on the menu.)  The waitstaff was incredibly rude and impatient, as well as not too bright. When the vegetarian in the group asked what else could be modified aside from that One Thing, because she doesn't eat meat, the waitress told her to try the fish. Strike one. Then, after the table balked and had to inform her -fish is still meat- she went and asked her manager, who again mentioned for the vegetarian to try the fish. Strike two!  Then, they managed to mess up the vegetarian's dish, and still charged for it. Strike three, though they had many, many more.  It wasn't just the veggie's who's food sucked, but the meat eater's, too. Over cooked, smothered in low grade cheese, and tasteless.  Aside from the dismal service, and the rude waitstaff, the atmosphere leaves something to be desired. Like lights. As far as I could tell, it was a restaurant, not a sleazy night club, so pull the lights off 'dim' and let people see the crap you're trying to feed them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=80
Devon R.,"Epping, NH",2,30,27,4.0,3/10/2011,"One of my favorite chains, this is my favorite location due to its proximity to Loew's. We only go on weekends in the afternoon and only sit in the lounge area. Never had an issue being seated or waited on immediately. I nearly always get the Awesome Jack Daniels flat iron steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli, the b/f loves the burgers.

J P.,"Waltham, MA",0,13,,1.0,11/9/2013,"This place is horrible and the managers are incompetent.  They put somebody else's meal on my debit card.  I noticed the mistake, called up - got the manager and he said it was a mistake, I told him to email me that and reverse the charge.  I did not get an email, I called back, he had left for the day. I got another manager who was as incompetent as the first one who said that the first manager was suppose to call me back.  I told him he didn't and then he refused to give me the email that the charge would be reversed, even though verbally he admitted the charge was in error.  When I called - the incompetent receptionist just kept putting me on hold and was totally useless.  AVOID THIS PLACE unless you want you want to pay for other's peoples food and drinks!  Totally incompetent wait-staff as well as two incompetent, inept managers who don't know the first thing about customer relations. Oh yes - something else - the food is HORRENDOUS too!  I am not sure which is worse  the food - or the management!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=80
Biff F.,"Merrimac, MA",0,39,,2.0,9/19/2013,"Ended up coming here because we were kind of desperate after a movie with the kids at Loews.  Wrong move.  I will say that the kids' offerings weren't bad -- for kids' offerings.  However, though the prices were reasonable, the portions should probably have been a little better.  And the drinks -- has had been mentioned by other Yelpers -- were weak.  The waitstaff was average -- not great, but not bad either.  I may give this place another chance at some point, because the food itself wasn't terrible -- but it was really difficult to speak amongst one another, so I really don't know.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=80
Minda H.,"Nashua, NH",6,75,,2.0,2/1/2008,"I'm really not that old, but this is a hangout for the early 20-somethings.  Which is fine.  If that's what you're into.  But be prepared for meat marketing and subsequent sneering (if you're ""old"" like me) as you enter and lots and lots of screamy giggling from the girly-girls whilst seated at a table.    It's as if all of those teenagers who hang out in front of the Loop aged just a bit and realized that with their summer-before-my-freshman/sophomore-year-at-college paychecks they could be loud and obnoxious INSIDE with all the comforts of central heating/air conditioning/restroom facilities with outlay of just a few bucks for appetizers and drinks.  Oh, I feel sorry for the wait staff here. The glass enclosed fishbowl bar is definitely more tolerable than the restaurant.  But I seem to remember Friday's Long Island Iced Tea being a lot better than it was served to me here. And the food is not great.  You're kidding yourself if you think that the spinach cheese dip is really something special.   Bottom line? Spend your dining out dollars somewhere else where you won't have to be surficially judged by those who giggle and sneer way too much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=80

Allison P.,"Methuen, MA",2,16,,2.0,4/25/2012,"As far as chains go, TGI Friday's is always pretty good, in my opinion.  I'm not crazy about this location; which is unfortunate since it is the closest one to my home.  On more than one occasion, I have experienced dirty glasses from the bar, rotten lettuce and/or tomatoes on the sandwiches, or dried up celery served with the buffalo wings.  This used to be a go-to hang out after work, etc. since it is so close but I wouldn't consider it at all anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=80
Gail M.,"Billerica, MA",0,3,,2.0,4/7/2014,"Went to TGI Friday Saturday around 4:30 - no line, no wait. We were seated right away (the restaurant was not at all crowed yet) but then we sat and sat with our menus closed to let them know we were ready to order. Several wait staff walked by us with any acknowledgement at all. Finally after 15 minutes or more my husband yelled to one of the fast walking waitresses if he could speak to a manager. He no sooner got the words out when our waitress showed up and apologized for the wait. We ordered our drinks and placed our order and waited another 20 minutes. We ordered the the seseme CD chicken strips and the fried greenbeans appetizers. The chicken was great but the greenbeans looked like they were from the bottom of the barrell. The fried coating was off most of them and just didnt have a good presentation. After reading the recent reviews, I am disappointed as I have always loved TGI Fridays and when the one in Woburn closed we traveled to the one in Methuen only to find the service and food have gone downhill, and apparently we are not along in our judement. What a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-methuen?start=80
Amy J.,"Methuen, MA",0,97,,2.0,3/17/2009,"Below average food and service. At lunch one afternoon, when the restaurant was nearly empty, I was served lukewarm soup without a spoon, pointed out to the server that I needed one, and then waited and waited and finally had to ask a passing waiter if HE could get me one. Very unimpressive! And then my slice of cheesecake was half frozen. On another occasion, we waited for an hour and a half for our food. Yes, the restaurant was busy and apparently the kitchen was understaffed, but it would have been nice to get an update on our food in all that time instead of being virtually ignored. We finally had to take our food to go because it was our son's bedtime, and what we arrived home with was barely edible.
