Marisol S.,"Miami, FL",240,112,129,3.0,12/8/2017,"Some chains last and I can understand why. Personally, I grew up always loving TGI Friday's but I am unsure how this restaurant is still open. I give 3 stars to the chef that still creates pretty good dishes. Can't beat the lunch special: $7.99 for a hearty turkey and kale veggie soup and a proportionately appropriate lunch size salad. I had the yucatan chipotle salad. Kudos to you chef. Service.... Well, thank God I had soup because that's about the only hydration I got. Never refilled my water glass. Hard to admit but as much as I loved this place, not what it once was for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8

Friendly and attentive people, good food and great prices.  Their frequent flyer program is great and offers special deals regularly.

Kim K.,"Miami, FL",121,40,47,1.0,8/8/2017,"Here with kids on a Saturday night around 9pm. SUPER busy. We were told 20 mins for a table, ended up waiting 40 mins. I have to say, as irritated as I was with the extra 20 mins (had the kids), the staff was excellent in demeanor and had an eagerness to please. The food did take forever to get, but once we got it, it was good. I say ""good"" because, after all, we are at a TGI Fridays. My steak was cooked perfectly (med-rare), my spinach was lightly sautéed (not mushy) and my mozzarella and tomato salad was really tasty. This was all a nice surprise considering this is not a steakhouse and the restaurant was obviously at capacity. I will say this, the restaurant could use a good scrubbing... to me this is lack of good management. The lack of management can also be seen in the inability to have enough staff available so the wait is either not so long OR the wait time given is correct.  Also, it seemed the servers were overloaded with tables, thus,our two-hour long dinner in what should have only been an hour, MAX! Go with the expectation of this being a family-friendly chain restaurant that is convenient and has value-priced meals rather than a 5 star dining experience and you won't be disappointed. Here again watching my waitress do everything but wait on our table all 1.5 hours I was here at an ""off hour"" and only 1 other table in her section. Took her 15 minutes to even greet us (after I had to go ask the hostess if we had a server), 10 mins to get our drinks and a painful 30 mins to bring us our food after she told she put a ""rush"" on it since we were sitting so long waiting for her.  I always order the same thing; the flat-iron steak, steamed spinach and tomato salad and must confess, it's pretty decent. If this place could just get some good management, it would make all the difference. The manager actually passed by me, nodded his head and told me to enjoy the meal. He didn't stop to ask me how things were. Truth be told, I wouldn't have said anything, as it's evident it doesn't matter based on all reviews from other yelpers. I come here out of convenience, price and my kids like it. Nothing more.  Oh... and never, ever when I'm in a hurry.  Was getting ready to post this with a 2 star. Changing it to one star. Took ANOTHER 10 minutes to get my server. I had to go ask someone to find her. Then another 15 mins to bring out my check once I told her I wanted the check. Honestly, the WORST service I've had in a very long time. MANAGEMENT please pay attention to what's going on in your establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8

Oscar D.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",0,7,,1.0,1/14/2018,"We came in with a party of 20. Was seated quickly. Was a Sunday night, place was empty. After that everything went down hill. We had to go to bar multiple time to get drinks. 45 minuets later still no service, water, menus extra. Had to speak with management multiple times. Finally things start to move. Yet still not great service. Two kids meals came out super late, no napkins, cups/mugs for special drinks missing. After meal was complete table was not cleaned up.

cristina b.,"Miami, FL",160,138,451,1.0,1/19/2017,"Went back again and this time our experience was just terrible. Sorry if it's TMI but I even had to go to the bathroom and throw up in the middle of the meal. Which speaking of bathrooms, were so utterly disgusting that it would make anyone throw up.  Although half of the restaurant was empty, we still had to wait about 25 minutes for a table. The entire place seemed like it was in disarray and the servers were all running around frazzled.  So, silly me forgot how horrible the onion soup was and decided to give it another try for starters. Dear God in heaven! Ugh. It was just nasty! Although it did look a bit better than last time, it came out cold with a chunk of stale bread with old cheese melted over the top. The broth tasted like it was from a powdered soup mix. Also there were pieces of French fries floating around the bottom of the bowl. Just absolutely gross.  We decided we would all share a bunch of appetizers. First the food took a while to come out, by the time we got it, everything was cold and all the dishes looked messy like they just been thrown onto the plate. Everything tasted horrible. The potato skins were dry like they've been reheated several times. The fries were stale and cold. The only acceptable thing was the mozzarella sticks but even that was cold. I've been traumatized by the movie ""Waiting"" so I really didn't want to say anything and we were all so hungry that we decided to just go with it at this point.  Needless to say, this particular TGIFriday's is not what it used to be years ago rather seems to be getting worse and worse. I will definitely not be coming back here at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8
Mila B.,"Miami, FL",1,19,1,1.0,12/19/2017,Came here on a Tuesday night at 730pm. A waiter took our appetizer order and then disappeared without taking our drink order. 30 minutes later with still no appetizers a bartender came to take our drink order and our food order stating that our waiter had left for the night. After another hour of waiting with still no drinks or appetizers we asked to speak to the manager and were told the manager was not available and there were no other servers available. It wasn't until Glenn the cook came and brought us our food out of the kitchen that we actually started to get good service. It's a shame that the kitchen staff are the only ones that care about providing good service,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8
Stephanie S.,"Miami, FL",64,237,269,2.0,12/7/2017,"I'm really not a fan of Fridays anymore. I used to love them when I was younger, but the few times I have had them in the past couple of years, I have not been satisfied. Service is always sub-par, and the food even worse. Their food is super salty, greasy, and overly cooked. I have yet to enjoy a meal here. The last time I ate dinner here, I waited 45 minutes just to receive a salad with chicken, and my waitress could care less. Not once did she inform us what was going on, or at least offer us anything in the meantime. The worst part was that when the food finally came out, our waitress had not even provided us with any utensils. We had to ask someone else to bring them after waiting another 10 minutes. She never came to check on us to see how we were doing. It was not even busy in the section we were in. I don't plan on returning, nor do I recommend this place to my fellow yelpies.

Sharae L.,"Miami, FL",125,15,2,1.0,11/9/2017,"Went for karaoke and sat at the bar, which was stacked with dirty dishes, and of course not wiped down. Three bartenders, not that crowded, yet it takes 10 minutes to even get a hello so we can order our drinks. While the girl who eventually fixed our margaritas was nice and apologetic about the wait, she doesn't make a very good drink. Not sure if it was just how she makes them or if that's just how the restaurant instructs them to, but I can make a better one at home on my own. The last three times I've been here, it's been basically the same issues. Slow, food not that great, and just too long of a wait time for a virtually empty place.

I was there with a group and the only drink that was ok was the draft beer which I ordered. The rest ordered happy hour drinks which were horrible and wine that must have been the bottom of the barrel.  The bright spot of our dinner was our waiter who was very pleasant.

Juan V.,"Goulds, FL",0,24,,3.0,7/14/2017,"We have been intermittent customers at this location for over 20 years.  It reminds those long gone days when my half orange and yours truly were dating. Like in any restaurant whether it is a chain or family owned, it's a matter of luck:  You showed one day and have a memorable dining experience; visit again next day and the experience is horrible, truly a nightmare. I must point out most of the time we have seated at the bar, having some draft beer and appetizers while my daughter and her friends are at the movies, so here are my comments: Pros 1-Extensive menu:  You can order a lot of different stuff. 2-Location:  It's conveniently located next to one of the main entrances into the mall. 3-Service:  maybe because we stayed at the bar, our service was generally speaking faster and without bumps, both for beverage and food. Cons 1-Service:  Twice we sat at the tables due to being with daughter and BFF, realized the service at restaurant not bar was remarkably slower.  Waiters were nice and polite, but slow. 2-Packed:  On Saturday or Sunday afternoon do not even attempt into get there, unless want to wait 1+ hours for a table. 3-Prices:  The food in my humble opinion is good, but with all honesty believe it is a little over priced; if you do not mind to drive further 20-30 minutes north, go to the Chilis at Kendall and you will find basically same kind of food at more reasonable prices, and if you love draft beer they have a long term 2-1 promotion. 4-Bathrooms:  Normally I do not care about bathrooms, but here I do an exception:  those are filthy.  There is toilet paper all over the floor and now and then seems as if a patron peed in the floor, really disgusting. After reading the zillions of 1 star comments from other folks here at Yelp, definitively I do believe my significant one and yours truly have been very lucky! I do not recall any bad experience like those other people mentioned here; Like I said you can visit the best restaurant in the world and if your waiter is in a bad day take for sure your dining experience will be ruined...But in other hand I do think it's impossible so many people can agree on bad comments concerning exactly the same issues (bad service, bad food quality, etc.). Please note I have never worked for TGI Friday's nor I do have any sort of interest there; I'm just giving my 2 cents opinion on this matter...  However there is a point I want to mention:  I traveled years ago to both New York and Buffalo, and by coincidence had to visit the TGI Friday restaurants at both cities and these were better managed and served than this location here in The Falls; furthermore the restaurant at my hotel in Buffalo was TGI Fridays and they had several promotions like Canadian beer 2-1(I know the border is nearby) and some others dinner specials which have never seen here in Miami...why? Bottom line, Chilis at Kendall is more closer to home, so for next visit probably will get there...Sometimes you should not listen to bad press, but I'm getting the opinion that things are going downhill at least with this particular TGIF location. P.D.  For those few people whom gave more than 1 star to their reviews and specially those which have visited the place for several years, do you know they used to have their own brand of beer? It was named TGIF and of course the label had the restaurant red/white logo on it...The taste was not bad, like those 'draft dry' beers en vogue during earlier and mid 90's...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8?start=20

The only time we were attended was when he took our order and brought us our food. One of the orders that was brought to the table was tiny and not the promised size. On the bright side, I must acknowledge that one of the managers offered them a free dessert for the mess up. Upon receiving the check, one of my friends paid with credit card, and as if the poor service were not enough, they lost his card and then had to bust a mission to find it.

I find all the Jack Daniel recipes have the most flavor. My favorite are the green bean appetizers,there like fries but not,lol. I use to have a thing for the Cajun chicken pasta ( I still adore this recipe) but I've moved on to the sizzling chicken and shrimp. This entree comes out on a sizzling plate and you see the gooey cheese bubbling from the heat....I love cheese so this is the perfect dish. The mash potatoes are always perfect  and my chicken plump and seasoned to perfection. I devour it and usually have leftovers so I can enjoy the meal twoce, that's how big the portion is. If sizzling platters aren't your thing they have all these appetizers that you can make your meal and get full from or there burger,ribs, sandwich options...stop me anytime now.

She was courteous and gave us time to order. The kids ordered a triple platter appetizer which included chicken wings, and a double order of mozzarella sticks. They said it was good and ate everything. My son got his triple berry smoothie and he really thought that came out tasty. I picked a flat iron steak which was perfectly made, some pilaf rice which I love from there, and some sautéed spinach. The spinach was a first for me and it was okay in taste. The alcoholic beverage I chose was the fruitsicle margarita and that was so good. My husband ordered a hamburger which looked tasty. No complains from this visit besides the bathroom wasn't as cleaned as I'd like it to be. Therefore I missed out on giving that last star.

I assumed it might have been a ""fluke"", so we tried it out again. On Saturday, January 9th, six of us got seated around 8:30PM. The waiter who served us was suffering from obvious back pain. We were then relocated to another section, where the new server (a lovely waitress, by the way) was forced to wait on 12 tables. All the while I'm thinking, ""Geez, a few more staff members on a Saturday night would probably make things go much faster..."" The breakdown? We were seated at 8:30PM. Changed tables at 8:41PM. Got our appetizer at 9:11PM. Got our meals at 9:43PM. The only reason we didn't walk out is because it was a party of 6 of us and our parking spot was so freakin' good. Never again.

mike p.,"Miami, FL",128,27,1,1.0,8/15/2016,"Disaster. STAY AWAY.  So many things went wrong with our visit that I almost don't know where to begin. The worst part was the terrible attitude of our server NICK and the indifference of the manager ""in training"". The ""manager"" was a bit more empathetic but still did not handle the situation properly.  1. We were originally a party of 5 plus a big double stroller with two babies. We needed a big table that was easily accessible. Then before being seated a friend came in and joined us so 6 plus stroller. Despite being empty the staff couldn't figure out where to seat us. They finally decided to send us to a big table atop TWO FLIGHTS of mini-stairs - the most inconvenient table in the place. . We had to carry the stroller up because apparently that's the only table to accommodate us even though it was almost empty! 2. It took the waiter 21 minutes to show up and that's AFTER I asked the hostess to please find our waiter. She found him and I watched as he basically was indifferent to the long wait. He strolled over to our table a while later looking like he was strolling through the park without a care in the world. I asked him to please take our order immediately because we had hungry kids and they needed to eat. I also asked him if he could bring something quickly for them. He said a basked of bread could be brought out right away. TWENTY MINUTES LATER the bread comes out! I asked him what's going on and he was clueless and indifferent/borderline rude. I asked for the food and he said ""most of it is ready"". I asked are the kids meals the ready ones he said YES. INSTEAD OF leaving them under the heat lamp bring them out! And the dishes that were they hold up? Cold sandwiches! Finally 50 minutes into our ordeal the food arrives.  3. The food was a disaster. We ordered for the adults 2 of the chicken clubs with avocado and gouda and it sounds great in the description. What arrived wasn't fit for animal consumption. The chicken was ICE COLD. The bread was like concrete. it had no cheese and the avocado was almost not present. The sandwiches were a mess.  4. I asked for the manager and the ""manager in training"" came out. I was obviously upset. His response? The waiter didn't put the order in on time. Its his fault"" Then he shrugged and said sorry as though he had no clue what to do. The waiter came back and I asked him what took so long. He said the kitchen screwed up. So one of them is lying or they are both clueless.  5. The ""manager in training"" then offers me 2 appetizer coupons and another shrug of the shoulders. I asked for the check, sent back the sandwiches. In the end I had to go find a bartender to actually accept payment because Nick the happy-go-lucky waiter was no where to be found. Zero tip for him. The manager then handed me the processed credit card slip to sign and had no clue why I had him run it. I explained the situation and he apologized, blaming the cook because ""he's new"".   Bottom line: the staff DOES NOT CARE about doing a good job. Some people can be retrained. Nick has the attitude that he is too good to be a waiter. You can't fix that and he should be dismissed. The manger in training communicates that he doesn't really want this job but maybe took it out of necessity and does not plan to excel. Not good either. The manager needs to monitor his staff more closely and do a better job of hiring. Food service is an important industry where reputation and quality are key to long term success.

Vanessa T.,"Miami, FL",76,8,,1.0,8/21/2016,"Let me start by saying that I RARELY write a negative review. It's so easy to ruin someone's business in an age where everyone relies on reviews. But this Friday's deserves it. This isn't my first bad experience with the Friday's at The Falls. It's happened so many times that I feel I have to share it. This place needs to close. I'd rather starve than eat at this death trap. Every time a group of friends suggest Friday's I try everything to convince them not to go there. Most of the time it's been so long since they've been there and they don't believe how bad it's gotten until they experience it first hand. This is not the restaurant you remember going to when you were younger. The service is the worst in all of Miami. I've never been to a place that takes an hour and a half to get out an appetizer. You have to get up and flag your server down. The place is filthy. The food is disgusting. You're better off going to publix, buying frozen appetizers, and throwing them in your oven. It would be like a five star restaurant compared to the food at this Friday's. I got sick for two days after eating here. Our table all ordered bottomless appetizers and none of us were able to order more than one appetizer... So what's the point of bottomless?? We had to leave because we were going to be late to our movie and we arrived at Friday's with TWO hours of time to eat and pay. The best part is that the restaurant was empty. There's no reason why the food should have taken so long. Two hours to get out one round of appetiZers and the food? Everyone had to put their meal on Togo boxes and leave. On top of that they refused to sell one of our friends a drink because her ID was vertical. Friday's apparently has the right to refuse a drink to someone who holds a VALID, non expired, license and is of drinking age. Who is running this place??? Please fire them because they don't know how to run a successful restaurant. There isn't one good thing I can say about going to this Friday's. The food is horrible and overpriced.

Sergio F.,"Miami, FL",765,1259,5162,4.0,12/12/2010,"There's a safety and predictability about chain restaurants that make them the perfect place for a semi-blind date. You know what I mean, you meet someone online, texting and calling are great but before you take them to one of your favorite boutique restaurants, better to meet at a chain place that has something for everyone. You don't want cuisine to get in the way of true (or overnight) love. Rather to get to know someone over a safe meal, and then compromise where she can go shoe shopping while you indulge in pork buns or waffle cakes. Such was the case with my visit to Friday's last night! I met up with my mystery lady and proceeded to get our table. We were told that a table for 2 was about a 30-35 minute wait, but were welcome to sit at the bar where Ms. Mystery ordered a couple of pink Martini concoctions and I played it safe with a Heineken. She was impressed with her drinks - which were promptly refilled - and my Heineken was served promptly as well. The bar staff was pleasant without being ""hovery"" (yeah I learned that word here on Yelp!) While it did take longer than promised to sit us (about an hour), the wait staff was pleasant and even took time to let us know that one of our plates were running late. Once dinner arrived, my Chicken Bruschetta Pasta and Ms. Lady's Parmesan Crusted Chicken were tasty and visually appealing. I suppose my chicken pasta could have had a tad more chicken but it was well seasoned and lean. The pasta had plenty of tomatoes, cheese shavings and importantly for me, a tart and sweet sauce. Our waiter was also helpful in bringing a to-go platter and wet naps to clean up.

Mark P.,"Miami, FL",35,3,22,2.0,2/3/2013,"Used to be a regular here, and maybe this place was always terrible and I never knew it due to my youthful naïveté.  But now that I'm older and wiser and drafting a review over a premium long island, It's clear this place has decent food, yet horrible service.  I'm here with my good friend and my gf. The staff here always got weeded (inable to cope with moderate traffic) with just a few people around the bar. Tonight is no different. The two bartenders on shift are both too busy talking to their significant others sitting amongst the other customers. I say ""significant others"" because that's the only explanation for the cuddling and kissing they engaged in during our visit. I don't usually mind witnessing love blossom, but it seemed out of place when you're waiting to make another drink order.  When I get frustrated while waiting for my drink, I usually scan the other patrons at the bar to see if they're also impatiently waiting for a refill. It helps me rationalize that I'm not being irrational, but instead, feel like part of a collective effort to capture the bartender's attention for the benefit of all of us. This unfortunately happened several times tonight.  Bottom line, this place is cool for celebrating your 14th birthday party in a booth with all of your best school chums while drugged-out 20-something's grudgingly sing ""happy birthday"" to you. But otherwise, don't expect much in terms of decent service from the bar.  And by the way, a ""premium"" ultimate drink isn't really really premium. It's mid-shelf booze.

Betty A.,"Miami, FL",52,78,8,4.0,11/27/2011,"My boyfriend and I wanted to see a movie at The Falls. However, he could not meet me before as he needed to dine with his mother after church and I was coming all the way from Coral Gables but I did not have a definitely time to dine with them. Therefore, I decided to dine on my own be already at the Falls. Man! That night it was like Black Friday started early. Cars packed the parking lot and warned my boyfriend about it and to come early.  In the meantime, I decided on two restaurants at The Falls but ultimately decided on Fridays as they had their 2 for $10 deal which consisted of an appetizer and entree or an entree and a desert. I chose the later. Very good deal! When I dine alone, I don't sit at a table but usually sit at the bar. However, the bar was packed which got me worried even though I had plenty of time to eat but I feared that it might be lost due to the wait.  After 15 minutes, a group that sat at the bar left and I immediately sat in their place to look at the menu. They left their area dirty which I informed my waitress to clean it up nicely along asking to get a menu. My waitress got a little defensive as she stated that they just left and she will clean it up. I said it was ok just informing her as I noticed she was a bit busy with the other people she was servicing. Upon cleaning my area and giving me the menu, I decided to order from the 2 for $10, the Chicken Brushetta which consisted of  Angle hair spaghetti with pieces of chicken and diced tomatoes with a pour of Vinaigrette dressing.  My waitress also let me know that when I am halfway finished with my meal to get her attention to put the desert order in.  As I was waiting for my entree, the people next to me also ordered almost the same thing but after me as I engage in a great conversation with them. To my surprise, their food came first then mine which was weird. They were surprised too. However, after close to 10 minutes my entree came. Yes, it was hot and tasty but I felt that the angel hair spaghetti was a bit dry. i don't know how to pin point but it was not as chewy or easy to chew as other times. I guess it was the speediness that the kitchen needed to get the food out.  However, I ordered the choloclate peanut butter pie. OMG! I have not tried this in a long time. What a dessert! Cold but tasty and crunchy with chocolate fudge to decorate the plate and on top of the pie. Delish! That made my night and believe me I ate this pie very slowly to have the taste in me. TGI Fridays: Only one suggestion from my boyfriend: PLEASE BRING BACK THE BEEF STROGANOFF (I don't know if that is how you spell it) I really would like it to have it back in the menu so I won't have to hear it from my boyfriend anymore.

Monica B.,"Saint Johns, FL",96,195,82,4.0,10/2/2010,"Dear Fridays, You saved my mom and I from starving tonight. Thank you for staying late on Saturday(2am).  I wanted a small meal & opted for the tomato bisque soup.. Flavor was fine but it was way too dense for a soup.. It was a lot more intense than a soup should be, almost like spaghetti sauce. I also wanted some  mash tators (dont judge!! I love potatoes & didn't want anything  fried) were good but a bit hard... Guess you can't be picky at 1130pm. Mom ordered the capt morgan chicken sandwich with the yummy sweet potato fries. She said her sandwich was great. Service was good. The waitress was very pleasant & nice.  I don't know if I will return again at a regular time, but good place for a bite late at night after a long night or to stop with friends, have an appetizer & drinks...

I received a coupon in the mail and after so many years of not going, I decided to visit with the two kids, wife, sister and my brother-in-law. Sadly it was not what I expected. The place had a weird smell. The decor was outdated and old. The tables were sticky. The bathrooms were disgusting to say the least and at 1130 in the morning. The waitress' service was blah. Drinks arrived late. There was a 50 minute wait to get the food. I had to get up twice to ask where the food was. I had ordered the California club and the meat was blah. Overall the food was very mediocre. NOTHING close to Cheesecake Factory or even Outback. It's sad because we frequent that mall and there really isn't a ""good"" restaurant left- maybe PF Changs or Los Ranchos- if that. NEVER going back.

Years ago, people had more spunk and charisma to take customers feelings into consideration. Now, all they care about is getting you out of the restaurant as soon as possible. The last time I went into Friday's was this past February and I was feeling a little apprehensive about it, but since I haven't been here in years, I decided to give it one more go and ordered their chicken bruschetta pasta and was surprised that I wasn't given two garlic toasts with my pasta. They always used to give toasts with their pasta and I guess they aren't giving out those anymore.

My hubby and I wanted to go somewhere casual where we could sit down right away on a Friday night, so we went to TGI Fridays at the Falls. I grew up coming to this place as a kid, but this restaurant really needs to step up their game and renovate not only the restaurant but take a crane to lift up their staffs smiles. We sat at the bar thinking we would get fast service and it was way slower than sitting at a table. The male bartenders were slow, barely smiled, didn't seem like they wanted to be there and were NOT attentive at all.  We ordered 2 bottomless appetizers and 1 entre to share between my husband and I. We got the wings first and soon after came the potato skins. When we would finish with our apps we would have to get the bartenders attention after waiting 10 minutes with empty plates and drink glasses. We asked for another round of apps and they neglected to take the empty plates away. If you've ever eaten at a bar top you know that there isn't a whole lot of space.  Throughout the night, the bartenders would never check up on us - we always had to get their attention .... heck, they wouldn't even look at us!!   The service was terrible!!

We had to wait to spot him and yell at him from across the restaurant to come over and wait about 20 minutes for some iced down drinks. The food was cold, and took forever to come out. Had to wait 35 minutes for my food and 20 minutes for my check. I would've understood on a busy night but it was around 11pm on a Sunday lonely night.  Btw, I was told I wasn't allowed to take the food I paid for home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8?start=80
Jose C.,"Loveland, CO",62,4,12,1.0,7/29/2015,Last time I ever come here. As I was waking in my first sign. A couple people leaving upset saying it's been over 15 min they sat and not one person has come up to their table. Place is maybe 20 percent full. Took long to get food. Food was cold beer was hot. The Potatoe skins are fried or something. Don't really know but they are nasty. The waitress got everything confused and not once but many times. Will never go here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8?start=80

Kiana L.,"Miami, FL",0,1,,1.0,8/23/2016,"If I could give it 0 stars I would. I've been coming here for years since it's the local restaurant everyone in the neighborhood has gone to growing up. I went today to have drinks with my friend for her birthday and I'm 24 years old and my ID is vertical because I got my ID late and it doesn't expire until 2017 so I just haven't switched it. It's completely valid ! They wouldn't let me order any alcoholic beverage because my ID wasn't horizontal . They lost a party of 6 because of this. I even asked to speak with the manager and she said it's a ""new policy"" however I was in Friday's less than 2 weeks ago with another friend and I was able to. I think this is ridiculous! It was so inconvenient and we took our business to another restaurant in the same mall that accepted our VALID ID's !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8?start=80

Krizzy B.,"Casselberry, FL",36,105,48,2.0,9/30/2014,"We stopped by on Friday, at Friday's for a Good Bye Party. They were already seated and situated. However, I noticed no appetizers or drinks on the table. I asked, how long were you guys sitting here? They stated, probably 20 minutes.  I decided to grab our drinks at the bar and come back to the table, which was crazy faster. Should have ordered there to. The server was Alby, she was nice, I believe she needs to work better under pressure. She brought drinks, left, and did not provide straws. I felt bad for those who were sitting there. I take initiative. I asked, ""Alby, what is going on?""  She said, ""I am sorry, I was at a party."".... -_-  We are a table of 8 people...So we are not a party as well? Fridays at the Falls? I do not recommended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8?start=80
Shishi X.,"Miami, FL",0,3,,1.0,12/27/2015,This is the worst tgif We have ever been to. We sat down and waited for more than 30 mins to be served. Then another 30 mins for food to arrive. The waiter was extremely rude and impatient. We talked to the manager and requested for another server. The manager was nice and apologized. It was very frustrating and disappointing to be treated that way. We just wanted to have a good time and relax. That didn't happen.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8?start=80

Lucy C.,"New York, NY",130,1173,43,4.0,1/2/2013,"This is the first restaurant I ever went to. I thought I would over-remember how good this place was since I hadn't had it in over ten years. Went back for the first time last week. Nope. Just as amazing as it was the first time. If every TGIF in America could be like this TGIF then America would return to its former glory. Amazing service. Great atmosphere. DELICIOUS FOOD and at a great price! Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp here were more tender, juicy, crispy, and tasty than every toher TGIF. Compared to other good restaurants, it may even be better. Great steak fries which more potato than tasty grease. Really good bbq pasta, which really shocked me. The flatbread appetizer and mozarella sticks were okay. But oh man, I love this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8?start=80
Tim L.,"Homestead, FL",0,18,,2.0,11/26/2015,"Meh. I had not been to a Friday's in literally 20 years. So when a friend suggested it for lunch, I was game. We went on Sunday, 11/22/15 at around 1:30 pm. When we walked in, we were hit by an awful stench. Like old beer mixed with bleach. We also wondered what to do because there was no sign and no hostess. I was about to go ask the bartender when a hostess came scurrying out. She was nice enough but tried to give us an ugly little deuce with a view of the kitchen. No thanks. We asked for a booth in the next room. Much more comfortable and there was actually some natural light. Our server was an older heavyset man (Stefan?) who was sarcastically friendly. That would have been ok had he been around when we needed more napkins or drink refills. My friend said he liked his seafood pasta. I got a cheeseburger, cooked medium, which came out extra well-done. Dry hockey puck. I'm not the type to send food back (the waiter had disappeared anyway), so I removed the dry bun and ate it. It came with a side of overly salty fries. The experience wasn't horrible but with so many great options in The Falls, I certainly won't be back. There is no place for mediocrity in the restaurant market. Next time I'll go to P. F. Changs (my first choice).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8?start=80

Dalyah W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,4,,1.0,7/24/2016,"Amy B. You must be from corporate because  you are full of it with your review! If  I could give no stars to this place i would the worst TGIF I've ever been too. Let's start from  the beginning. I understand Adults, kids, teens we are all humans  and deserve  to be treated with respect. If you are  a family looking to have  a nice dinner after a day at  the mall or before watching a good  movie at the cinema this  is not  the place  to go. For starters  they have kids working  there that have  no care in the world or even  know what  it is to  work in a place where customer service is so important. Coming in and signing  the waiting list is a joke  because  you could be  waiting  forever to be seated as the kids in the front  just  bump their  friends  that  come in from hanging at the mall all day and families patiently waiting never  get to be seated. It took  my family  and three others waiting about  11/2  before we realized  what was going on  with  the seating and we had to  all  go and complain to be seated. When  seated by one of their  young staff  who had no manners of how to treat  the guest we got no water  no utensil on the table and we literally had to call about  5 times to have  someone wait on us. When  finally  they  came they took our drink  order and didn't come  back for another half hour  with  the  drinks  to take  our dinner order. When  the dinner  came my nieces chicken, nuggets were ice cold and my sister  inlaws order  was completly incorrect. They offer  to  reheat the  chicken  nuggets and  replace my sister inlaws order but we  thought it was better to leave it that way. When the food was brought out we never  got utensils to  eat and  had to call  waiter  twice who never acknowledge us . I had to get one of the busboy  attention to see if he would bring us the utensil and  the kid  said with  a very sarcastic response. ""We are out of utensil and are waiting  to get some more clean"" at this  point  full  of anger and humiliation we requested  a manager who  to our Not  surprise was also  a young  kid. We explained all  we've been thru since  we arrived he apologize and offer  a discount  and  a free Brownie  for my niece  for all the inconvenience. they  replaced my sister in law dinner  and gave my nice a fresh  chicken nugget  dinner to go but  when  the bill  came back they  charged us  for both  chicken nugget meals they  charged  us for  the  brownie and  to top  it off they  never  brought the brownie to us. At this  point my sister in law  was furious called the manager  and gave  him  a piece  of her mind.  Need less to  say  we only paid for the  original meal order and for the Tip  well   you can imagine how  that one went  $0. We will never recommend dinner here to  any family that  wants  to have a pleasant day with their loved ones. We will never eat at this TGIF restaurant again and we will make sure as  a Pinecrest resident  every one local and not does the same spread the word and fight for our right as a customer to be treated  with  respect & dignity . Because the  majority of their clients in this  location are teenagers they probably don't care much about  the clients because kids  cannot give  the  kind of tips they  would expect to get. And because  its kids running the place  they  all  think  its a BK job  and treat everyone like crap but  that doesn't excuse  them. Everyone  should  be treated  like  a human being kid or not and behave  like one. So sad what  we have to go  thru  these days with the lack of morals and  education this new generation is growing up  to be. This is why  more and more restaurants are  closing down and loosing business for  lack  of cleannesless, professionalism and just plain lack of basic manners. Even the kids that frequent this place are being treated like SHIT only I don't think their bright enough to  know any better. Only god know what their being served and how when they  go to this  place. NEVER AGAIN TGIF!  WORST TGIF IN DADE COUNTY! !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8?start=80
Nelly A.,"Miami, FL",25,2,1,1.0,6/13/2015,Came in on Saturday were told it would take 10 minutes to sit as I wait a couple walks in after us and gets sat? Finally we are seated and we agreed on doing the happy hour deal and were strongly disappointed with both the drinks and the appetizer.

Rodney W.,"Miami, FL",397,97,1085,3.0,9/22/2014,"Decided to take  son for a quick bite to eat, instead of cooking. So on the way home stopped at TGI Friday's.  TGI Friday's has never been my favorite got to spot but the new menu had peeked interest along with endless appetizer's.  PLUS I wanted a nice adult beverage.   We were seated promptly and my son decided upon the chicken fingers and I decided to stay on the healthy side and ordered the grilled chicken cobb salad.  The grilled chicken breast was freshly marinated and was not the prefabbed stuff, but was freshly prepared cut and served over freshly chopped romaine with sliced avocado, grape tomatoes, hard-boiled egg, applewood-smoked bacon and crumbled bleu cheese with your choice of dressing. OH I forgot to tell you about my adult beverage....It ended up being an Arnold Palmer because I did not have my license with me.  Apparently TGI Friday's has a strict carding policy.  I know it is suppose to a compliment, but when you are pushing 47 and you want your beverage; trust me it; it is NOT a compliment........ All in all, it was a nice Father Son dinner, which are always PRICELESS!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8?start=80
Maggie D.,"Miami, FL",81,23,13,3.0,7/26/2014,"Took forever to be served and the hostess even wanted to sit another family before us. I looked up deal on their website before going and was told none of the offers were valid. After an hour wait and being denied the specials, we decided not to even eat there. Keep in mind this all happened ON A TUESDAY. This review might change the next time I go, but I was less than impressed by this location of the popular chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-miami-8?start=80
