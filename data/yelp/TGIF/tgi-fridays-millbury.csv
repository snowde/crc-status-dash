Barbara M.,"Charlton, MA",0,1,,1.0,8/12/2017,"If there was a negative star I would put it! Don't go here. Over the past few years we've been 5 times, each time worse. Last night went there, told 15 minute wait, but lots of empty tables. They tried sitting us next to the bathroom on a high wiggly table and chairs. Asked to move and had to wait again,  but many tables open.  Then when we were seated we waited over 10 minutes to get waited on. Went to order and she rudely informed us we had the wrong menu. Then we wanted the endless apps, and she told us it was $12.99 a person for those. Ok.  We ordered 4 apps and they are WAY SMALLER portions, 3 meatballs and 3 pieces of chicken quesadillas came out. When we inquired from the guy where the rest of our apps were he said ""I don't know, I'm just the food runner"". What?!  It took over 25 minutes for the other 2 apps to come out meanwhile we ordered more meatballs and quesadillas. For the pricey amount of $13 per person you'd think the apps would flow. Nope. We said something to our waitress and she said it's 10 minutes between apps. None of this was explained to us when we ordered the pricey option. She said there's nothing she could do, it was ""corporates "" decision. What?!?!  We complained to the manager on that night and he basically just changed our waiter and gave us a card for a free app. We did t order any more apps because we had already been there almost 2 hours! They charged us full price with no apologies.  We could've ordered 2 full meals for the price we paid for a few meatballs and quesadillas. Save yourself and go to any one of the many other restaurants in that plaza, all of which we've been to and never had an experience like the times we've been here!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-millbury?start=20
Gianna A.,"Cranston, RI",0,1,,1.0,8/9/2017,"Went here for dinner after vacation in NY and all the previous comments pale to what we endured. First it took 10 minutes for someone to seat us then we noticed multiple dirty tables. We should've left after that, while waiting to take our order we heard foul language from a man and the manager himself. We noticed the manager fraternizing with one of the waitresses. If that wasn't enough the waitress broke a dish of Buffalo chicken that went all over the floor and went un-wiped  and then the hostess told people to walk around the mess that had been there for five minutes. To top it off a women at the next table dropped a beer bottle that went all over the floor and wasn't cleaned either.   So don't waste your time coming here when Applebees is right next door.

Hong N.,"Worcester, MA",1,3,1,1.0,6/10/2017,"Went here for a family get together with a close friend. I had a child with me and she also had a child and a baby, they tried to seat us in the bar area with high tables, I asked if we can have a seat in a the lounge and they said the wait is going to be very long ( honestly didn't look that busy unless they had it reserved- in which I actually made reservations) I asked how long they responded with very long, again I asked what's the time wait and they still responded with very long wait!!  My friends were already on the way so we just kept the bar table. They triple stacked the high chair for the baby which was so unsafe we just kept the baby in our laps. Then there were fruit flies in our drinks, we ordered appetizers which took about 40 mins for it to come out and about another 50 minutes for our dinners to come out. The children were super cranky hungry, the food finally came out and it was so dry they had to bring out a side bowl of sauce for it. Horrible food and horrible service.

Marion H.,"Shrewsbury, MA",0,2,,1.0,8/3/2017,"DO NOT GO HERE. My favorite bartender/waiter, joe, left recently and he was the only reason I went. He was so personable and prompt and always made dining at TGIF a pleasant experience. He decided to leave due to the bar manager over staffing her employees. I've been there one time since, and it was a terrible experience. The bar manager is extremely arrogant and cold. I hope this place starts treating their employees better.

Pat G.,"Uxbridge, MA",1,17,2,4.0,8/2/2016,"Food and drinks are very reasonably priced, they always have some good specials. Been coming here for years. The selection of $3 drinks and $5 apps, can't go wrong. The only thing that's a huge pain every time going is dealing with the food specials. You see commercials like the unlimited app for $10 or the full rack of ribs for $10 and say, oh hey awesome, I want those. It's always a circus trying to work it out with staff because the tv advertised food specials are never listed in the menu and the wait staff is always clueless when asked. That means whenever there's a special, it goes something like this for me, and I suggest you do the same: I call ahead of time to ask about the special and they confirm it. I get there and ask for the special, and the wait staff is clueless. They call a manager over to ask about it, and they say the special isn't available. I say I saw the special on tv earlier that day, and I called before coming to make sure they offered it. More back and forth, they go talk to their manager, they give me the special price. They need to list their current food specials on the menu and avoid the three ring circus. Still worth dealing with that for less than 5 minutes for their prices, and they do have good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-millbury?start=20
Jade B.,"Westborough, MA",116,66,45,1.0,4/16/2015,"They get ONE star for service. Our waitress was very attentive considering how busy it was. I went with three friends last night. None of us had been there in a long time, so we decided to give it a try. We were seated in a booth with the  sun glaring in our eyes. They have sun shades, mind you. They don't use them, apparently. We ordered drinks. The beer and wine list is fairly decent. I ordered the cheapest red. A 9oz pout was $9. And it's safe to say they didn't even fill it to 9oz. The glass was dirty on top of that. The menu was huge, but only one vegetarian dinner on the menu. A black bean burger. Described as spicy, but it was very bland. The bun was greasy, and the burger itself fell apart and had to be eaten with a knife and fork. The fries described as seasoned? Only drenched in salt and pepper. They were so salty I needed a tall glass of water.  I can't describe my friends' meals taste, but you think they'd accommodate. One friend wanted a particular burger, but without mushrooms. They wouldn't do it. Portions were small for the ridiculous prices. One veggie burger. 2 glasses of wine. $30?!!!

Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24565,5.0,12/12/2015,"I had the BEST experience at the Millbury TGI Fridays today.  Literally, my favorite restaurant now. Even better than the amazing Milford TGI Fridays (and that's saying something!) Visited today, while shopping in this amazing shopping center (called Shoppes @ Blackstone Valley), which by the way, is right off Route 146 (Worcester Providence Tpke), 5 minutes from Worcester and 15 from Northbridge and Grafton, and had an amazing experience with waitress Dawn and manager Jeremiah.  Before today, I had never been to this location and didn't know what to expect. My first impression today was great, as the interior is extremely clean, and everyone is amazing. The host was very friendly and got me to a wonderful booth, which was clean, comfortable, and HUGE (in comparison with other restaurants). Plus, this location is renovated (which means it's even CLEANER, more modern-looking, and the storefront says just ""Fridays"", without TGI). So first impressions rocked and the experience was even better.  I had a coupon I got in my email for a free entree with the purchase of an entree and 2 drinks, and it was valid at the Milford location. Since my phone was very near of losing battery, I wanted to ask the manager / waitress if they would ever be able to accept it. This is when manager Jeremiah came over and said he would be ever so happy to take the coupon, as well as being extremely friendly (and not seeming annoyed like they are in other restaurants). Following, he came back over and provided the BEST customer service I've received EVER. Since my iPhone was at 10% battery or less, he offered to plug it in in his office (as he has the same phone). So did I not only get great food and service, but my phone was able to be charged while I was at it! So impressed and thankful that he charged it for me. Following, Dawn came over (who was our amazing waitress), who was very friendly, efficient and helpful. She made everything go smoothly, fast, and incredible throughout my visit to the Millbury location. Also, I consistently order a classic cheeseburger whenever I go to TGI Fridays and this was the best burger I've ever had throughout my many visits to any TGI Fridays.       Amazing experience. There is no way I won't be returning to this location. I guess I'll have to make the special, nearly an hour trip back to the amazing Shoppes @ Blackstone Valley.  DEFINITELY make this your ""lunch"" spot for a shopping day in Millbury. 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-millbury?start=20

Grace P.,"Worcester, MA",6,3,,1.0,8/15/2016,At first we were told that there was at least a 10 to 15 min wait and there seemed to be a lot of empty tables so we were a bit confused. Luckily it didn't take that long. We were brought to our table and there seemed to be multiple tables that had not been cleared off. When I sat down I noticed an awful smell that smelled similar to vomit and the place just felt dirty. The waiter was very pleasant. We ordered our food which came in a reasonable time BUT they only brought my husband's meal and informed me they didn't have what I had ordered. We were in disbelief that this kind of oversight could happen. I understand that sometimes things like this happened but don't tell me as you are giving my husband his dinner!

Tiffany N.,"Millbury, MA",35,1,,1.0,12/3/2016,"Last night I was able to sneak away from my children with my husband for a night out. Let me start out by saying my waiter Blake was an absolute delight! He was understanding and constantly checked on us throughout our dinner to make sure we were all set. We waited for over an hour for our food, when we received our dinner, it was wrong. My steak was well done and I specified rare! My husbands had jack Daniel sauce on it which was also wrong and the steak was burnt, my sweet potato fries were cold along with the shrimp. The whole experience was horrific with the exception of our waiter and alcoholic beverages. The manger Cameron came over to tell us he gave a ""discount"", he was extremely rude but I ordered spinach artichoke dip with the manger since I was drinking and needed something in my stomach, well I was brought some flat bread. The whole dinner was ruined. I did not get to eat before our movie. The worst part, after everything we encountered in our two hour stay... WE STILL LEFT WITH A BILL! .

She slammed the plates on the table.  The manager came over to talk to us and was no help.  She was not apologetic for the service we got and for the disgusting food served to us.

The celery served with it had been frozen so it was soggy not crisp like you should expect  my app was 86'd so I had to change my order. Also we had to asked for utensils and plates. I ordered a salad no croutons no cheese. Lemon wedges on the side for my dressing as they don't have oil and vinegar And a flat iron steak. The first salad they tried to serve me was the standard salad with croutons cheese and dressing on it. I sent it back and waited 10 minutes for a second one. The server dropped it and ran.

The second (which I feel needs justification) was due to the other options in the area having longer waits. The potato skins were the main draw and I don't know if it was just the day I was there but they were disgusting. I had my best friend try one and she also said they were awful, but that they were worse than she remembered.

Britta O.,"Grafton, MA",63,29,2,4.0,8/5/2011,"Personally, I love TGI Fridays. I, mainly, go on Tuesday nights (9-11p.m.) when they have Stump! Trivia night. Appetizers after 10 p.m. after 1/2 price. Waitress in the bar area is efficient and can be found easily. I love their Jack Daniels' Burger and their Sesame Jack Chicken Strips. Very, very tasty.  My one and only problem. The bartenders (girls - mid twenties) have NO idea how to pour a Guinness. #1: Guinness ALWAYS needs it's own tap (not on a multi tap like most ""bars"" do). It is carbonated different and needs different pressure.  #2: The bartenders only did a single pour. Really? Anyone who has ever even SEEN a Guinness knows that a Guinness is a two pour drink. 1st pour (front pull) goes 3/4th of the way to the rim. Wait about 5 minutes. 2nd pour (back pour - meaning push the handle back instead of forwards for less aeration into the mixture) to the top.  Add design if you have ANY talent. These girls just let it go to top. #3: WHEN they over poured the drink, they dropped a spoon into the drink to pull the extra foam off the top (not understanding the foam IS PART OF THE DRINK!!!) #4: They served the Guinness in a 24 oz. glass ... more like a pilsner than anything else. Guinness are best served in specifically made Guinness glasses. And if you don't have those ... you need to just use a plan old pint glass. NOTHING FANCY! other than that ...

Dimitri D.,"Worcester, MA",5,34,,2.0,4/17/2011,"A Review of T.G.I. Fridays. By Dimitri D. First off, let me explain the situation. My party and I were about to go and view the movie ""Battle: Los Angeles"" so we were a bit pressed for time. Our original intention was to go to Red Robin, which if you have read my review it is obviously an excellent restaurant. If you haven't, well now you know. We got there and the wait was 45 minutes which would not have given us enough time. We tried out Uno's and it was the same too-long wait. So we rushed off to TGI Friday's which was packed but had just enough seats at the bar so we sat there. I ordered a cheeseburger with some sort of Jack Daniel's sauce on it. I have certainly had better. The sauce was all right but the beef was dry and needless to say, not juicy at all. I did not appreciate how she didn't ask us how we wanted them cooked (my preference is always medium rare and there wasn't any pink to be found in it) The french fries were all right but nothing to write home about. The thing I probably enjoyed the most was my Dr Pepper. The service was good though, waitresses were friendly and all, asked us how we were doing, gave us refills on our beverages.  My final statement: I will not be rushing to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-millbury?start=60

Diner F.,"Northbridge, MA",0,36,,1.0,12/17/2010,"This is, by far, the worst TGI Fridays I have ever dined at. I really have no idea why we keep coming here (actually, I do... there aren't that many restaurants around in this shopping area and at least the food is predictable). Their service is the WORST. I couldn't be less impressed.   During one visit we wanted to sit in the bar area (it wasn't  busy at all) and were told there weren't tables available.  However, when I walked by to use the restroom there were, in fact, tables available... and there was service available at those tables because not FIVE minutes after we arrived they seated guests at the table that we wanted.  What the hell? They seem to always forget to bring the side salads and when they do bring them it's within minutes of brining the entrees.  Forget it at that point.   And their side salads are expensive.  I've been billed for salads I haven't received at all on more than one occasion. One visit, when we dined during the day on a weekday with children, we had asked that the music be turned down because we quite literally could not hear one another talking, and we were told ""no."" Their dinner salads are small and overpriced. My husband and I (and several others I know, actually) have vowed to skip TGI Fridays in the future and dine at Longhorn Steakhouse, Applebees or Uno's instead (all in this same shopping plaza).  All three are considerably better than this TGI Fridays (which is a shame because the location in Framingham is nothing like this one as far as quality & service go).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-millbury?start=60
Heather Z.,"Auburn, MA",18,7,,1.0,1/5/2014,"I usually do not have to go online and read reviews for ""chain"" or ""franchise"" restaurants.  I would expect them to have a strict training regime and would anticipate the same service, food etc. at each location. Not EXACT, but similar.   No matter where it be.  Well, it was a rainy Sunday early-evening.  We decided to pop in for a quick bite and continue on our way home.        Upon arriving we did notice that it looked somewhat busier than normal.  Understandable due to the time of year.  We walked in and stood waiting for a good three minutes before even seeing someone in eye-shot of the reception desk.  ""Odd,"" I thought. ""There are two people waiting, a lot of empty tables, but no one is seating guests.""        Then, around the corner came two young girls.  They both appeared to be training each other, on their first day.  They still, did not say a word to us.  Then, appeared The Chef, of all people and noticed that we hadn't been acknowledged and made a point to mention to the girls that we were waiting to be seated.  (Thanks, Chef)  Without saying a word, two menus were picked up and the greeter started walking away.        Unsure if she was seating us or the other couple, they gave us a nod and we began to follow.  She started walking into the bar area and we requested that we sit in the dining section. (Don't you think I would have seated myself if I wanted to sit near the bar)  Anyhoot, we were seated, FINALLY!! Let's grub.        More waiting.  Ok, I get it, it's busy, so whatever.  We just got two sodas.  Good thing.  The people that were seated adjacent to us waited OVER 10 min for their drinks.  Their apps came out almost immediately after they arrived.         While sitting and waiting for our orders we enjoy watching people.  Happened to notice quite a bit of food being brought back to the kitchen.  Considering we were seated right there, it was fairly noticeable.  I am unsure if it was due to lack of quality or not knowing where the plate was going to, but either way, it didn't look very good.      Ordered:     The quantity of the food was good, quality varied       *HM bnls Chkn bites- were good However, due to the fact that we requested HM rather than the normal buffalo, it arrived with extra HM (points for that) and celery.  BAD move!! Although they were a great size, they were not any good.  One stalk was so dried out, the end of it was split into four curly ends on one side.  And two of the other three were covered in brown soft spots.  Ewww... *Potato Skins- Cold, not much else to say about that *Pretzels- BURNT disappointing, the cheese sauce was DELISH.  Nice job *Pork tacos,didn't try *Brushetta- outstanding!! Unless you are not a big fan of garlic.  I absolutely LOVE garlic.  So the over abundance in this plate was not a problem for me.  And the balsamic reduction glaze....OH MY I have to create that!!  Perfect *Bacon Mac & cheese bites-eh, nothing fabulous.  Was expecting bacon INSIDE of the bites, rather than small strips on the top of the dish *Philly CheeseSteak Stack Burger- To begin, this was the reason we came.  My partner was craving a burger for weeks.  Perfect!!  When it arrived it was undesirable.  Ok, I understand that a burger with that particular name is going to be greasy, but this, NO WAY!!!  The grease was pooled in the bowl type piece of crisp, cool lettuce, that had been placed under the bottom burger.  And when it was attempted to be picked up and bitten in to, fingers penetrated the bottom bun, like sticking your finger in bread marinating for bread pudding.  Gag me with a spoon, that is THE ULTIMATE pet peeve, heebie jeebie - type situation.   Dis-gus-ting!!!!      We told the waitress right away and she promptly removed it with out any question.  And took it off the bill.  Good job, and thank you.  Was a bit confused as to why the manger had not come over and said anything.  Under any usual circumstance, if something needs to be voided, a manager is notified.  They normally make an appearance to the table, just to even check with the customer Unless, this staff is doing voids on their own...?!?!        Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised.  The place is run by kids.  Highs school and early college-age kids.  Not speaking badly of that.  I did the same thing when I was that age.  But on every shift, I feel there should be some more ""experienced"" staff to at least manage situations.  I do not feel it fair to a young staff member to have to apologize for a mistake that the kitchen made, which in the long run, falls on the manager.  Sorry to say.            I used to enjoy drink and apps at the bar from time to time.  Unfortunately,now that the reno has been done, I will be relocating elsewhere.  There is no separation between bar crowd rowdiness and the other dining areas.  The music is overpowering, as are the Tv's.  And it's only a Sunday, and there weren't even any sports on!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-millbury?start=60

The evening that my girlfriend and I went to eat at the Millbury location, there was no hostess ready to seat us for 5 minutes. We were first brought to a table that had not even been cleaned. Once seated at a cleaner table, which we had requested, we ordered the endless appetizers and flat iron steak. I was informed by our server that the endless apps price had gone up to $16 and that only 3 appetizers were now eligible for the offer: boneless wings, potstickers, and mozzerella sticks. I couldn't find any information regarding this price and item change anywhere on TGI Friday's website. When we received the steak 20 minutes after ordering, which was ordered medium rare, the steak was cooked far past well-done. Throughout the dining experience I waited upwards of 20 minutes (3 times!) in between ordering the next round of appetizers and receiving them. At one point, it took 20 minutes for our server to even come back to the table to even ask if there was anything that we needed. I eventually asked to speak to a manager. A young woman dressed exactly like the servers came out to talk to me. From her demeanor, it seemed like she was just one of the servers whom the other servers had coerced into talking to me as they did not feel like addressing the issue themselves. I voiced my complaints with her, and all she could offer to do regarding my complaints was ""pass it on"" to the kitchen. I received no resolution from taking to the ""manager"". After we requested the check from our server, we were handed a lone receipt. We paid in cash and awaited our change. Our server then gave us change but had left out the loose change we were owed! It seemed as though she assumed that the change was to be part of the gratuity for the bill. It was the perfect cap to one of the worst dining experiences that I've had. We were very disappointed by the staff's conduct, as they seemed to enjoy talking to each other more than tending to the few patrons in the dining room and the lack of supervision.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-millbury

We decided to get dinner here since we like TGIF's better than Applebee's.  I'd say they need to hire more staff. We arrived and saw plenty of tables open but were told we'd have to wait 30-40 minutes. We didn't have to wait that long but little did we realize how long everything was going to take. The waiter had a lot to say and every time we picked something to order he suggested something else. We got the endless apps and multiple times, what came out was not exactly what we asked for.  I never got my grey goose punch but I made sure that I wasn't charged for it either. Our waiter knew we had kids and we're getting antsy to leave.

My husband had the Chichen and Cheese sizzles with the Creamy Mashed Potatos which he he loved.    My steak was done medium rare and very tender and flavorful. My Potatos were creamy, cheesy and very scrumptious the spinach was a little salty but sweet at the same time.

The flavor was terrible and it def wasn't soup.  We had to send it back.  My husband switched to broccoli cheese and it came out ice cold.   Also,  has the dumbest design for an entrance.   In the back, and around the corner from parking.  Makes no sense.   Will try again but stay away from the soup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-millbury

John W.,"Douglas, MA",1,4,,2.0,7/14/2017,"I went here with a group of friends a few weeks ago and I must admit the food was good. However, that does not justify the exceptionally slow service we received. The restaurant was more than half empty, so I was extremely confused why it took a waitress ten minutes after seating us to ask for our drinks. After we finally had received our meals, they only checked on us once to give us the check, which was problematic because we wanted refills and extra napkins throughout the meal. My guess would have been they were low on staff, but I saw almost as many workers there as people! This was in excusable.

I got the strawberry lemonade slush, it comes with free refills and normally when I go somewhere else they'll refill it without me even asking.. She was hardly around and when she brought us the check she just dropped it on the table without saying anything. Also, when I received my cajun chicken & shrimp pasta it was completely burnt.

First I will start off by saying that it seemed that there was no management present on the floor while people were being sat throughout the restaurant. When we first came in, we waited about 10 minutes without even a hello (with no one waiting)  before having someone that looked like they were inconvenienced to sit us but finally sat us in the cramped area of a stool seat with a small bench for the three of us.   The dining room floor was cluttered with garbage all over the area where the waitstaff was punching in the orders.  The waitress that came over and took our order stated that the restaurant was almost out of napkins so she was not supposed to give us any napkins so she stole one off of a table that was uncleaned and gave me the napkin.  What??? The food that was delivered was both cold and gummy.  We were sorely disappointed with our experience here.  To top it all off three of the waitstaff were flirting with each other and touching each other at the place where they punched orders in.

When the drinks finally came, the waitress apologized for the slow bar service. I could then see her apologizing to other tables as well. Time to cut bait. Since we still had not received our appetizer, we decided to forego any kind of main dish and just ask for our check and have the wings to go.

When we got our bill yesterday we were surprised to find out that drinks are now $12. They were great drinks, they were not $12 drinks. I've had plenty that were worth $12 or more, these aren't on that list. I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken over mac and cheese. The m&c is now a small dish on the side. The chicken was about 3 oz (maybe 1/4 of a breast) and it was smothered in some mustard sauce that was completely disgusting with a sprinkling of saw dust like parmesan cheese on top. After it took 40 minutes to get these, I wasn't going to send it back. I ate the ""tomato and mozzarella salad (2 small balls of cheese cut in half with a ton of dry tomatoes) and the m&c and tossed the rest. We were there over an hour and all we had was a main course.
