Paul S.,"Woburn Sands, United Kingdom",1,2,,4.0,2/18/2015,I have been there a few times and I have to say I have been very happy with the food and being a chef my self I can be fussy. The survive is very good and friendly. Put it this way I had a refill drink and I happened to finish it and put it down. With in a second the waiter picked up my glass and put a new glass down. Â I highly recommend eating there. The only bad thing I can say is booking a table can be hard by phone. No one seems to pick up.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milton-keynes

Colin P.,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",0,9,3,4.0,12/22/2014,"As reliable as ever.... Great bar menu (perhaps a little pricey in comparison to other restaurants) The chicken and bourbon glaze starter is a winner every time and I tend to go for a burger on most visits now, the flavour is top notch. The beef is also worth a mention, the Beef in the burgers is clearly top notch and extremely fresh. Temperature of the restaurant is a little cold, and perhaps as a business it's time for TGIS to replace some of the older looking furniture . Service is second to non, on par with their U.S. counterparts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milton-keynes
G K.,"London, United Kingdom",0,141,5,3.0,1/16/2009,"Obviously T.G.I. Friday's is a chain across the whole of England. Food is standard American offerings and nearly American-sized portions. I've never had a problem with T.G.I. Friday's in terms of service - it has always been perfectly friendly, efficient and helpful. Food also has been the same quality - generally a feeling of everything being deep-fried and overcooked! Its not too bad though so I guess it depends on your food choices. I like their drinks menu but can never go past the Oreo Cookie milkshake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-milton-keynes
