Jeanne R.,"Spring Hill, FL",18,163,1,2.0,7/6/2012,"I've been to many Friday's in many different cities.  When it comes to this one I have one main question: Where is the menu?  It's only like 2-3 pages.  I'm used to Friday's menus going on and on like 6 or 7 pages with many choices to choose from.  I ended up getting the Jack Daniel's steak since the menu was so limited and it was half way decent, the vibe was not there like a normal Friday's, and with the limited menu I'll never bother with another one in this area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2?start=40
Shelly S.,"Altoona, PA",48,77,7,4.0,12/7/2012,"I stop here a lot going back and forth to the hospital for my doctor visits. We usually get an appetizer, as long as I get mozzarella sticks I don't care what the rest of them get. I always get a burger here, they are GREAT! I do think at times the service is very slow, but other times you can walk right in, then right out. I also I think sometimes it is very loud in there. Sometimes I feel like I have to yell to be heard. Great place for a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2?start=40
Valerie V.,"Boston, PA",35,97,325,4.0,1/21/2017,Pretzel sticks and sesame chicken apps are awesome!  Love the all American burger. I do not recommend  pasta dishes at Friday's.  Service is always efficient.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2
Kathleen L.,"Seminole, FL",28,33,31,1.0,10/13/2017,"Used to be THE place to go.  Now it seems the general manager and his staff just don't care. The last three times we stopped in to eat at the bar and use our Friday's points it's been a huge hassle. Stacks of dirty dishes near the frozen drink machine is disgusting on its own. No bus pans, just stacks of dirty plates right there. Unsanitary and unappetizing.  It also makes no sense that a food runner should return to the kitchen empty handed.  They stand and chat with the staff and walk away.  Anyways, food has been substandard.  I was given a lecture on why I chose the wrong coupon for my last order, and the so-called woman manager gave me the eyeball as I  being reprimanded and embarrassed by the bartender.  Needless to say, the 1000 points we earned by going there will never be used at the Monroeville store. They need a wake-up call but sadly it seems that the attitude there will not change.  Don't waste your time nor $.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2
Chardae J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",137,143,95,1.0,12/24/2017,I feel so bad because the staff is always so friendly here but the food never meets my expectations. I don't come here often but when I do I remember why I've stayed away for so long. My recent trip me and my dad were starving after shopping and we both agreed that the food didn't taste like it has soul. The salmon was under seasoned the food took quite a bit for the place to be empty and the server asked if we wanted a box before even looking at our plates. Friendly people is nice but what about the food?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2
Rachel S.,"Trafford, PA",0,5,,1.0,1/3/2018,If I could give a negative I would.  AWFUL service.  Waited 25 minutes for part of our order and even that was not edible.  Waitress took off before we could ask for the items that were supposed to be on the burger.  She brought the rest of our meal (in a to go container) and got irritated when we complained.  She said a manager would come but never saw him and we left hungry.  Avoid this place if you are hungry.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2

Manager had an attitude when I complained & said I'll make you another but you can keep this burger too. I said I don't want this burger , if it was good there wouldn't be a problem. I said I have many friends who own restaurants, when food is wrong, you remake it then give them a refund. He's clearly an idiot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2
Brenda W.,"Monroeville, PA",211,577,835,4.0,8/8/2016,"I continue to love dining at Friday's.  Sometimes the service is sketchy but not this go-round.  My husband and I stopped in late after a movie nearby and were lucky to have Gerri as our server.  What a treat that was.  She is energetic and friendly without being annoying.  On the contrary -- she was just the right amount of ""upbeatness"", making suggestions, answering our questions, making small talk, and just had a nice overall presence. We were excited to learn that they offered endless appetizers for 10 buckaroos.  So we each ordered the appetizers.  The first one you order comes out full-size; thereafter, they are half-orders.  I started with the pot-stickers, followed by potato skins while my husband started with chicken wings.  The most expensive part of the meal happened to be my 2 peach sangrias but they were good so I'm not complaining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2

Deborah M.,"Monroeville, PA",0,9,1,1.0,8/11/2017,This place has gone really downhill from years ago. If you sit at the bar that place is very unsanitary. No one cares to sanitize the bar tops! If you come in for the endless apps there are certain stipulations when you get there when you can have those apps. The bar is only for drinks I would not recommend getting food there and also please bring  sanitizer!!!!  I can compare this to a New York city subway because this place is dirty and needs re-organized with their management !!!!

Sarah L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,17,29,1.0,8/31/2016,My family and I came here for lunch. I don't particularly like burger joints but I knew of several items I liked prior to going. So I was fine with this choice. While yes it was lunch hour there was an abundance of empty tables more empty than filled. The service here was terrible it was slow unpleasant and honestly the staff couldn't get our order right. On chance of luck we sat close to the soda fountain and we had to fill our own drinks because well you know the SERVICE SUCKED.  My food did not come out with the rest of my parties meals ... I ordered a burger and fries... But after the 30 minutes it took my family to get food what's another 15 minutes for my own right? So when I finally got my meal the fries were cold and over seasoned whatever that's what ketchup is for let me just mask this terrible food with ketchup! So after picking at my ketchup fries I decided to take a bite of my assumed delicious jd bbq burger... As I bit in and realized I was biting into disappointment the burger was burned and dry with hardly any sauce but whatever that's why ketchup was made right!?! You betcha!  The calamity doesn't end. While I'm saving face trying to enjoy this dry unappetizing now ketchup drenched meal so not to cause any issues my brother and father are having their own problems. I mentioned service sucks right? So on top of having to get our own drinks our server wasn't paying attention and grabbed the plate my brother was eating off of touching his food and knocking it over onto him. He was still eating at it.  Of course this was quite offensive to us but by this point we just want the meal over with.  So after I was finished with my jd ketchup burger © I washed it down with my leftover ice water and my family wrapped up their meals... Oh our server was real quick to bring us the bill and receipt and mention her tip though sadly my father was paying and left the crappy server a tip  I didn't bring management into this as it is really just a lesson learned don't ever go back here  Crappy food terrible service and dirty looking atmosphere,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2
Rebecca C.,"Havertown, PA",0,1,,1.0,8/13/2017,"T.G.I. Friday's at Monroeville thought it was appropriate to give me another person's hardly touched meal in a clean bowl.  A big group of us went to dinner.  My husband and I are vegan, so we did our best to not be difficult and chose the kid's pasta as our meal.  Because our party was so large, my pasta came out first and they lost my husband's order and had to make a new one.  So my pasta comes out in a bowl pre mixed and with a spoon in it.  I thought nothing of it because I was starving so I ate it.  When I finished, my husband's pasta came out completely different then what was presented to me. He had pasta in a bowl with marinara poured on top. Nothing was pre mixed no spoon in it.  That's when I knew they gave me another child's meal that was hardy touched.  THANK T.G.I.

Jade C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",74,75,52,2.0,2/19/2015,"There is one good thing about Friday's: the Jack Daniels sauce, everything else is disappointing. The outside of the building is nice, but the inside is dim and has the cluttered, nostalgic look that only works at Cracker Barrel. The potato skins that used to be epic are tiny, overcooked crisps with a nickel-size dab of ""cheese"". The wings are tasty, but so tiny you begin to worry that you were served the sickliest of chickens or the wings of a smaller fowl. The potstickers were the most disappointing appetizer: hard skin and salty, gummy, grey filling. The meats are average burgers and ribs), but it's the sauce that makes them yummy.  The service is basic, but there are a few friendly bartenders.  I won't be visiting Friday's again for a while, not until I forget or forgive my lukewarm experiences here and give them another chance to underwhelm me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2

Kathy S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,28,,2.0,10/20/2016,"I will definitely not be going back here.  Went in for dinner & a few drinks in the middle of the week.  Sat at the bar.  The restaurant & bar were not busy at all.  There were maybe 8 others sitting at the bar.   The blonde bartender waited on us - I can't remember her name.  She messed up my food order (ordering the completely wrong meal), then told me it wasn't her fault, and didn't apologize when she was told by the other bar tender the wrong meal came out.  She also never once smiled the entire night & didn't seem very friendly.  I pointed out to her on the menu the actual picture of what I wanted & that I pointed to the exact same picture when I ordered it from her & she saw me point at that picture.  Finally she decided to apologize for the error when she handed me the bill -- which I'm sure was just because it was time for me to tip. The only reason this is 2 stars instead of 1 is that other bartender was very nice & handled the wrong meal situation right away.   She also smiled & I could see her having great interactions with the customers she waited on.  But I won't be going back -- for average food & a below average beer selection I have many other options that provide much better customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2
Kevin H.,"Milford, MI",10,54,11,2.0,8/19/2016,"We waited on this bubblehead hostess to seat us after half an hour. As a look around the restaurant they were a good 8-10 empty tables sitting there. Now when I asked why we couldn't sit down she looked at me with the bad attitude and told me she's doing her best, clearly she was overwhelmed. We had to wait a half an hour just to sit down with a bunch of empty tables. As for the services it was fine and the food was good. The last this that gave this TGI Friday location a two star was how dirty this place was.

Jason C.,"New Kensington, PA",172,1,,2.0,4/23/2016,"My girlfriend and I came into this branch on Wednesday night around 8pm or so. I must tell you I am not pleased with the service we received from the moment we walked in till the time we left.  When we walked in the young lady at the door stared at me until I said it was just the two of us.  With no words what so ever she grabbed menus and started walking away. We were not sure if we were to follow our not because she hadn't said a word to us.  She turned around and waved us to a table. She then put our menus on the table and walked away. I thought wow. It can only get better from here.  Boy was I wrong.   We waited ten minutes for our waitress to come to our table and she started with. "" what can I get you"". No name.  Nothing about the menu.  Nothing. I asked if there were drink specials.  She brought me a book and added they are all fruity drinks you won't like them.  So I ordered a whiskey.  My gf ordered a water with lemon.  Another few mins pass and we both get waters no lemon. After ten more minutes I finally get my drink. BTW there are upwards of 25 tables that have no one sitting at them. Not real busy. I'm really hungry at this point so we stay to eat. We order the pretzel appetizers. They came fast but they were placed on my table with no words spoken again from the staff My gf orders the ""474"" jd ribs. In return she got a rude comment. ""Oh those ones"" like im cheap or something. also BTW there are no indicators that this comes with sides in the menu. The waitress says it comes with fries and Coleslaw. We want to upgrade to different sides and we get an eye roll. Whatever. I order the jd chicken with mashed instead of slaw. Food comes out pretty fast and tastes pretty good. But my last problem is that the whole we sat there my drink was never refilled and never was I asked if I wanted another one until I was done eating. Again the food was good but the service was terrible. We won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2?start=20
Jay H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",12,50,5,2.0,10/17/2015,"It's Friday's, so my expectations aren't very high. And if you're reading a Friday's review you probably just want to know if the service is good and the food is hot. Well, this is definitely not a model Friday's, it's pretty lackluster. Service is friendly but nothing exceptional. Waitress was very nice but definitely gave my mom my sweet potato fries and forgot my wife's spinach altogether. And when I did get my sweet potato fries, they were not the full effort. Too soft, not hot enough. Actually in general the food could have been hotter. All that said, not a disaster. Bbq chicken flatbread was solid, pecan crusted chicken salad was solid, ribs were solid. Mozzerella sticks were good.

There is a nice outside dining area great for the warmer months. The food is always good. They offer apps, sandwiches, salads, seafood, burgers, pasta, steaks and ribs. My only complaint is that the wait for your food is ssssssssssssssssssssssllllllllllllllllllllllllllll­lllllllllllllllllllllllllllloooooooooooooooooooooo­ooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! You will need at least an hour if you come here during lunch time. The last time we went the three of us shared the pick three appetizer. We choose  Buffalo Wings, Fried Mozzarella Sticks and Potato Skins. The trios was enough food so we took our sandwiches home for lunch the next day. The wife had the Triple Reuben and I had the Jack Daniels Burger. Our daughter had her usually burger. One thing I can truly say is that their fries are something special. They are extremely addictive! Drinks consists of typical Coke products and they offer a full bar as well.

The staff is very friendly and the prices are on par with the typical chain restaurants. Now let's get to the important stuff, the food.  My wife and I had been looking for a place to make ""ours"" since I moved up here a few years ago. We had tried many places, but for some reason, not TGI's.  We stopped in there one afternoon at random, just because we were passing by. When  we tasted the Jack Daniel's sampler, we were in love. Lots of chicken and shrimp and ribs, an appetizer big enough for a meal (in fact my wife frequently orders the app for her meal). The potstickers are excellent too, very addictive.  On to the steak. I'm a major carnivore. I firmly believe that good meat doesnt need messed with much. At TGI's, the steaks are good quality cuts, cooked perfectly to order. I usually don't even add seasoning or steak sauce to mine. Try a bite first before camouflaging the meat, you'll be pleased! For those who like seafood, get the salmon with langostine lobster bites, it's every bit as good as the steak! Out of all the meals at the TGIs in Monroeville, and the takeout (two bags is the norm for us), i've never had a bad meal. They also have a great bartender. My wife loves the dreamsicle, and while I'm not fond of sweet drinks, that one tastes exactly like the ice cream. So to summarize, THIS TGIs should be used as an example of how to serve food and make people happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-monroeville-2?start=20
