Darrell L.,"Manhattan, NY",11,36,5,2.0,11/12/2012,"The food tastes the same as any other TGI Friday. The restaurant can't change that. What they can change is their service. Veterans Day 2012 - they offer a free meal to veterans. Good deal, right? However, they only schedule two servers for lunch. That means that after waiting forever for a table, the server only came by the table to take our order and to bring our food and our check. She was so busy that she didn't have time. It wasn't her fault. It was the fault of the ever so wise manager that scheduled the normal rotation even though it was a huge occasion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro?start=40

Darrell B.,"Murfreesboro, TN",4,41,,4.0,1/6/2008,"Ok so it is a box chain restaurant. But. I LOVE T.G.I Friday's. At least the new incarnation not necessarily it's past lives.  This newly built T.G.I Fridays across from Stones River Mall in Murfreesboro is awesome. I love the new design T.G.I Friday' is doing. It is fun, hip, fresh, and loud. I really love it. As lame as this sounds it really feels like Friday when your there lol. It is really fun to eat there.The bar room is very large, and great for groups. The food I had was delicious. The menue I assume has been updated from the past because the new dishes I have had there are great. The appetizers are really good too.  I recommend going here with friends, and having a good time. I think this is the newest T.G.I. Friday's in the area so you really get to see their new restaurant design which is really awesome I think.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro?start=40
Ethan D.,"Aynor, SC",0,13,,4.0,6/5/2014,"Good restaurant. Food was good as always and the so was the service. The only part that wasn't good was the wait to get in. I was there in one of there ""dead hours"". Maybe 10-15 people in the restaurant and when I went in to get a table there was no host/hostess. I waited a good 5-10 minutes when the restaurant was maybe 10% full if that. Finally what seemed to be the manager showed up and got us a seat. While we were waiting another family came in and left because of lack of service, which I don't really blame them. Shouldn't take that long to seat us when the restaurant is barely 1/4th full. The manager also seemed to be bar tending, managing and a host all at the same time which needs to be improved. Anyways everything else there was fine. Waiter was nice, did a good job and was easy to talk to. I recommend Fridays to anyone. I know it's a chain but it's also unique and hip with a lot of different choices to choose from. The best part is the Jack Daniels BBQ menu which is great. Highly recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro?start=40
Denise R.,"Antioch, TN",4,53,,4.0,8/14/2010,"This T.G.I. Friday's has the best service!  We went last night . Friday, August 13, 2010 and although it was packed, we were seated immediately.  Immediately, someone greeted us and got our drink order. All of the servers and the manager were friendly but not fake... The food came out quickly.  One thing that impressed me is that they were very, very, busy and the servers were very busy but there seemed to be no stress.   Our food was cooked properly and several times our server checked on us to make sure we had every thing we needed.   I was very impressed on how this restaurant ran.  Because of that, we had a  great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro?start=40
Melissa W.,"Little Rock, AR",4,3,,2.0,10/1/2015,"Not a great visit. I don't know why I am actually disappointed because I shouldn't expect more.  The good: stuffed jalapeño appetizer was amazing. Great flavor.  The bad: waited at the front door for over 5 mins and there was only one other table in the entire place.  The server was weird and slow.  I ordered soup and salad. Cesar salad had Italian dressing and tomatoes, so it pretty much was a house salad with Italian dressing. When I asked for a regular salad with ranch, I heard him tell the cook (they have an open kitchen and you can hear everything!) that the last at his table doesn't know what a Cesar salad is.  Then there were ants on my table.   Won't go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro?start=20
Sálua R.,"Smyrna, TN",9,1,,2.0,12/30/2015,"I went there with my mother in law. We thought we would a good thing going in there since we were near.  I ordered a chicken sandwich with Jack Daniels glaze and fries and she got a burger with Jack Daniels glaze. We sat there at that table 3:18 exactly and our food didn't come to the table until 3:45 having only about three other tables being served, and the server didn't even come to check on us or refill our drinks. We had this girl that we could see she wasn't a server or anything like that. The guy simply didn't come to our table anymore, but he would go to the other tables around us to check on them. Food was good, but the burger was a little bit soggy as well as my chicken sandwich. I think the best thing was the fries. Best fries I ate, but we're not coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro?start=20
Tia G.,"Murfreesboro, TN",140,104,125,2.0,3/12/2016,"This Friday's got two stars because I do like Friday's food (it's similar to a Chili's), but this particular Friday's has the worst service, especially on a busy night. This visit was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. My friends and I get there, and it's a lot of people waiting to get seated. We expected for the wait to be long because of all the ""March Madness"" games on TV. We wait for about 30 minutes, and the hostess comes by and ask what the name on list is ours. We tell her and she points to a table and says ""whenever that table is clean, you can seat yourselves"". Ok.. So the table gets clean, and before we can move, another hostess is already sitting a group that came in after us at the table. Obviously we're upset. Right before we're about to say something to the hostess, the manager comes up and says ""I have a table for you guys back here."" Fine. We go to the table. The waiter takes our drink order, messes it up (literally it is 4 sprites and a water), and then takes our food order. When our food arrives to the table, all of our burgers are wrong. We are missing sides, two burgers are so burnt that you can't eat them, and none of them had the right toppings. We are telling the guy who brought our food out, and he's confused because he's just a food runner. So we asked for a manager or our server. The manager shows up at our table, and we're telling her our problems, and then I said ""we just would like to speak to our server"" because he has all the notes on what we ordered. She says ""he just quit."" O_O What??? To make a long story short, our food or drinks never got right. The manager did give us our food free, which was nice. But it was a disaster! And after a while, it was hard to get anyone, including the manager over to our table. I get it that they were busy, but it was just a disaster. The manager was in over her head. So, my advice, stop in during a time that they are not busy. If it's busy, come back later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro?start=20

Two of the adult plates was missing part of the order had to tell the waitress what was missing. one of the kids order came several minutes after everone else.

Ryan J.,"Nashville, TN",49,12,15,4.0,2/3/2012,"I have been a fan of TGI Friday's for a long time. Generally chain restaurants grow old quickly with me but I have always had such great food and service each time that I go, I can't help but keep going back for more.  I just recently moved back to Tennessee and decided to try my local TGI Friday's. Even though my prior local restaurant was 700 miles away, the experience here in Murfreesboro was equally as satisfying.  I was seated quickly and when the manager walked by and noticed I didn't have a drink yet he personally stopped to take my drink order. However, my waiter, Matt, was right on his heals. The food came out quickly and tasted great and the service was exceptional as usual. Looking forward to trying the pot stickers based on other reviews on my next visit.

Cemile L.,"Hendersonville, TN",0,19,9,1.0,5/8/2016,"I have never written a bad review and this is my first but someone needs to bring attention to the unsanitary conditions of this location.. Well it is Mothers Day and because of an event I had to attend in Mboro we stopped into Friday's for dinner.. Upon arriving my daughter and I went to the rest room to wash our hands ..and noticed all the stalls were dirty with sanitary napkins and diapers stuffed into the overfill cans but because it had not been cleaned in hours ..and in the stall with the changing pad the dirty diapers were stuffed into the railing for handicapped..oh my..well I immediately brought this to the attention of our waitress who said she would let the manager know..we were starving and even though they did not bring out the correct food order and the ketchup container was empty ..we had dinner..I stopped into the restroom one last time before our 1hr drive and was astonished that it was still NASTY! What restroom to the employees use? Must be different ..because I can not imagine an employee would walk out of a restroom without picking up a diaper or sanitary napkin off the floor before existing. Let's hope hands are washed..That said, I found a young manager who appeared to be overseeing an employee clean a trash can..notified of the restroom.. I/we will never be back..what happened to TGI Fridays?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro?start=20
Jeni B.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,7,,2.0,7/23/2015,"My partner and I went in here a couple weeks ago. We sat in the bar, at a booth. We came in about two hours before closing. We ordered the mozzarella cheese sticks for an appetizer. It was very good and I get it all the time since it's one of my favorite things there. I ordered the Jack Daniel's grilled chicken sandwich, he ordered the hamburger Jack Daniel's sandwich. His side was fries and my side was mashed potatoes. So, anyways, I sat there the whole time without my drink refilled. I had to get lemonade, since I'm pregnant and can't have any caffeine intake. Right when we got there, it took the waitress 10 minutes to greet us. We had the appetizer first, so with all the waiting on the appetizer, after eating the appetizer, my drink was gone. We kept trying to flag our waitress down to get my drink refilled and it was like she was ignoring me. I didn't even have time to tell her I needed a refill since she dropped the food off so quickly and I was ignored the whole time. I had to eat my dinner with nothing to drink. I couldn't even drink off of his drink, since I can't have caffeine. I was so mad. We kept watching the waitress and she wasn't even doing anything at all, but had her back to us the entire time.. On her phone, etc. We were her ONLY table. So what can be so hard about making sure I have something to drink??? We ended up finishing our dinner and I barely ate because I didn't have nothing to wash my food down with and had a dry throat. My man had to get up and go find her and tell her I needed something to drink. By the time we have done paid and everything, she finally brings out a to-go drink for me, as we are already standing up ready to leave. Like that even matters anymore. I was so upset with this and we will not be back. The waitress worked in the bar area. Completely upset with this experience! Everyone goes out to eat for a reason. So we can sit down and not have to worry about getting anything ourselves. I cook all the time. Going out to eat is suppose to be relaxing, especially for women! We're suppose to tip servers. But she didn't even do her job so why should we tip her?  My cooking is way better than TGI Friday's anyways. I could have stayed home and ate my own cooking and made sure I had a drink. Unbelievable. My chicken was extremely dry, too. So that made it worse with nothing to drink. She got a $4 tip and she's lucky she even got that. If it was up to me, I would have NOT tipped her. We will never be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro?start=20
Sherreka C.,"Murfreesboro, TN",143,15,4,1.0,10/8/2012,"FRIDAY'S WHY? Hello Foodies, lets talk about Managers who don't listen to customers... Yesterday was a great day to eat out in Murfreesboro. Apparently because every restarant we choose to go to was wrapped around the building except one. And now we know why. Situation: Party of four enters restaurant, famished and in good spirits. We sit. 10 minutes later, our waitress finally comes to the table, apparently rushing through our drink orders without the slightest suggestion of what else we may want to drink. perhaps a margarita? She did not even ask! SADFACE! moving on. After deciding on appetizers, also without suggestion we wait patiently for our order to come.  Appetizers arrive along with "" We are all out of Grilled shrimp only Fried"" will that do? Well I guess so says the man whos paying the bill. As our tea glasses continue to diminish, we see that it takes 10 minutes each time to get a simple tea refill. what madness of customer service is this? Food to the table. Wait a minute! This cheesy Chicken plate looks identical to a kiddie platter at Taco Bell and guess what the dried burnt shrimp only served to make the dish look even less appealing? 12.00 of crap! So after experiencing the Ultimate disgust. He walks out and we request a manager. Mr. Manager , who never introduced himself or bothered to listen to our complaints, came over to the table, told us what he would do an rushed off to ruin someone elses over priced lunch! Case in Point! This is why there was no line... bad, slow service, terrible management skills, and not hardly enough of a portion to satisfy a 3 year old.

Jessica B.,"Bowling Green, KY",26,146,27,2.0,11/8/2014,"TGI has always just been ""okay"", in my opinion. It's not a restaurant I crave or frequent often. It's more of a ""we're burnt out on everything else so this will do"" kinda places. The menu seems to change every time I'm there. My favorite dish has always been the parmesan chicken. It used to be served with tortellini and a tomato/mozzarella salad. Now it comes with Mac and cheese instead of the tortellini. The food was just okay. I got two small pieces of chicken instead of a bigger portion I was used to. The Mac and cheese was bland, not very cheesy and kind of burnt tasting from broiling all the crumbs on top. My boyfriend had the ""philly burger"" and he said it was okay but very greasy. Service was alright, nothing to complain about there. I'm just not really wowed by this place, it falls in line with places like Applebee's and Chili's, mediocre at best.

Jaime H.,"Murfreesboro, TN",60,1,,1.0,8/26/2017,"Had pretty horrible service last night at TGI Friday's in Murfreesboro.  Our server was slow, unfamiliar with the menu, and inattentive.  First, and most shockingly, he brought me the wrong drink, which had pineapple juice in it! I'm allergic to pineapple, but luckily could tell the drink had pineapple in it after having one tiny sip. My husband also tried it and said ""yep, that definitely has pineapple in it"". We called the server over and told him it was the wrong drink and he argued with us that it was the right drink. I showed him what I ordered on the menu, the Pink Punk Mojito, and then pointed out the Pink Punk Martini, which is what I was mistakenly served. I explained that I am allergic to pineapple and he promptly apologized and took the wrong drink away. Eventually, he brought me the correct drink. I was itchy and uncomfortable from that one sip, but luckily it takes more than one sip for it to cause my throat to close up. Other customers with more sensitive allergies might not be so lucky! My sizzling chicken was not sizzling. It seemed as if it had been sitting under heat lamps for awhile.  My Mom ordered the French Dip and only ate about 1/2 of it and had a lot of fries left over. She asked for a box and a little container for her Au Jus. The server brought her the tiny box and no cup for the juice. The box was too small to fit her leftovers, so she asked if he had a bigger one. He said no, that's the biggest that they had. Again, I reminded him to bring a container for the Au jus.  He returned some time later with the checks, which were incorrect. He had charged me for the first drink, which was wrong. We also had a coupon which took forever for him to find a manager to help him apply to the bill.  Meanwhile, we see him drop off large to-go boxes to surrounding tables.. somehow he managed to find bigger boxes after telling us that the one he brought was the largest that they had. I had to ask him a third time to bring my mom a container for the Au Jus. My Mom had just given up and assumed she would never get it.  Also, he never came by to see if we wanted anymore drinks and he never cleared our empty plates that were in front of us.  The restaurant was not very busy at all. The server just seemed like he had no interest in his job or the satisfaction of his customers.  I'm not sure I will return to TGI Friday's. The food was mediocre and the service was terrible. There are plenty of other nearby restaurants with much better food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro

First Webb we sat down it took her at least 20 mins to come back and take our order after we had closed our menus and had run out of drinks. I ordered the beyond meat burger and my fries came out cold as well as the burger. Seems they had been sitting under the warmer for a while and another waitress had to deliver it.

Tabatha B.,"Memphis, TN",6,45,155,1.0,8/27/2017,"Well, well, well. I would give them zero stars if I  would!! First time to Murfreesboro wanting to grab a quick bite to eat at least that's what I thought. First off, waiting a good 10 minutes just to be seated. The place isn't crowded. Second, get seated at a table that needed to be cleaned. Third, while seated only part of our beverages get made. Other people was being seated way faster and getting beverages before us! Ok food, endless apps the chicken quesadilla barley had any chicken in it. Bacon nachos no bacon and dry. Garlic Parmesan wings no garlic. They barely had any flavor. So I'm getting my ticket and tell my why I was charged MF 93.67!!!!! Now mind you my order was only 19.41! So why is it that the so called manager here don't know ish about refunding me back my money! So now I'm here sitting waiting on the ""real manage"" to come in so she can issue me a refund. The waitress told me that it will drop from my card within 24 hours?!?! So when I ask for a receipt she can't give me one? WTH? This is some real BULL! For this to be the first part of my trip this really sucks!!!!! Now mind you one of my cousins got sick off of something and was throwing up, and another lady was throwing up too from something that she ate here as well. My other cousin stomach is in knots. So clearly there is an even bigger problem! I've been waiting thus for 20 minutes! What a crappy way to spend my trip! I'm super disappointed and pissed off! I will NEVER EVER EVER COME HERE AGAIN! And on top of that we didn't even get an I'M SORRY"" or anything!!!!!!!!!!   Update: after all that the ""real"" manager came. She was already on the defensive mode. I explained to her what my situation was and she told me there was nothing that she could do for me. She claimed that it would ""fall"" off and I should have a refund by Monday when the banks open. I asked for a receipt showing that a refund had been issued but she said she was unable to give me a refund. So my cousins discussed with her about them getting sick and she stated there was nothing she could do about the food not agreeing with people's stomachs. She said they made over 5,000 dollars that day and no one else has complained. Then she goes on to say she couldn't control us getting sick due to doing drugs or drinking. So she basically made an assumption that we were drug addicts and/or alcoholics. I walked out pretty darn upset. I met a very nice lady that went back in the restaurant with me to see if we could some real assistance. The same manger came back to speak to the lady and myself. Ultimately to make a long story short. I was able to get part of my money back. What confused me was why she just didn't help me in the first place? Why lie to me and tell me that there wasn't anything that you could do to help me, when clearly there was?!

Carrie C.,"Pooler, GA",116,15,3,1.0,3/24/2017,"I wish I could give zero stars. We came in around 5:45 on a Friday night. It wasn't busy at all, we got a table right away. Not so bad, but my daughters high chair was super sticky. I wiped it off and put her in. After 10 minutes of waiting and MULTIPLE servers walking past, I had to flag down the host to ask where our waiter was. He took our drink orders another 5 minutes go by before our waiter comes to say the host never told him he had a table. He takes our order and about 15 minutes later we get our food, which is fine. The burgers were ok but my daughters chicken fingers were horrible. We never got refills on our waters. If we had ordered sodas, I would not have paid for them because they would never have been refilled. To top it off, we walked outside and the big garbage was being taken out which caused a horrifying smell.  Long story short, average food, horrible chicken fingers, ZERO communication between staff members, and, frankly, it seemed like most of the people there hated their lives. Customer service is important, people!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro
Tori H.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,1,,1.0,12/4/2017,"I wish I could give 0 stars. We walked in tonight and the place was empty. There were a couple of people in the bar. No employees seen. We stood at the front to be seated and after 15 min we sat ourself. No one ever came out, 20 min later we just got up and left. HORRIBLE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro
Cagney C.,"Murfreesboro, TN",247,1,,1.0,12/2/2017,"Sat down around 7:45.. had a great server! We ordered the chicken nachos appetizer, came with no chicken so we sent it back. We get our food. I order a salad. Not bad just not hardly anything on it. We also ordered the pasta with shrimp and the shrimp wasn't fully done. Got a dessert to fill our bellys and came out CORRECT!!! We didn't send back out food because we didn't want anymore trouble for anyone, but disappointed at my visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro

Lisa I.,"Watertown, TN",34,5,,1.0,8/11/2017,"Went at 3pm on a Friday.  Was seated immediately,  although the floor was dirty and sticky.  We waited 15 minutes without seeing a server,  and when we left there want even anyone up front.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro
G. S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",1,22,8,2.0,5/13/2017,"Wow, where to start.  I called in an order for pick up, which they heard incorrectly. So I ended up with a sirloin steak that was one of the toughest pieces of meat I have ever put in my mouth.  On the positive side the mashed potatoes and broccoli were great. I believe that the other reviews were spot on.  This place is over priced and underwhelming. Never again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro
Chrispy R.,"Nashville, TN",21,22,,2.0,8/14/2017,"I was craving some endless apps! Stopped in on a Sunday with the wife and was surprised to find the place a ghost town. Maybe 6 people in the whole joint. M'eh. Whatever. We are seated right away and on the way to the table, two things are immediately clear. 1: The floor is sticky. I mean, REALLY sticky. That's never good. The place is dead, there's no reason for the floor to NOT be freshly mopped. 2: The entire place smells of dirty mop water. But now I'm confused! They can't have dirty mop water if they're not mopping the floor! We get to the table and the dirty mop water smell culprit is finally revealed. The table is completely covered in a sticky, waxy film and I can still see all of the wiping strokes on the table top. This leads me to believe that they clean every table with the same nasty, dirty rag. Gross. Anyway, the service was okay, if not kind of slow. The kitchen can't be slammed with only 6 people in the whole restaurant! How long does it take to get an appetizer! Oh, I forgot to mention the flies. THE FLIES! They were everywhere! This entire place made me feel like I needed a shower afterwards. I think I know now why the place was empty! Avoid this place like the plague! Unless, of course, you actually WANT the plague! I won't be back. Once was enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro
MJ M.,"Murfreesboro, TN",7,12,1,1.0,12/31/2016,My husband and I just went there. I have been craving it for weeks and was so excited to get my sizzling chicken. We waited 5 minutes to be seated while I noticed waitresses standing around. Once seated we waited 15 for someone to acknowledge us. Meanwhile a couple waitresses walked past us several times. The final straw was a woman walking in and being seated immediately and had her drink order taken within a minute and then ordered immediately after. I will never go there again. I have NEVER walked out of a restaurant before but I did tonight. Went to IHOP instead and had impecable severice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro
Tiffany W.,"Nashville, TN",54,38,49,1.0,2/19/2017,"Since when did the Sizzling chicken and shrimp come with the grilled shrimp in a marinara sauce AND if they changed the description, how are you going to have the old picture (that I'm used to)on the menu? This has been the worst experience at this Fridays. My drink was completely watered down...and I'm a lightweight but it was blatant. Asked for my drink the come with my food, she gone bring me the drink that's been sitting in ice and tell me that it's been ready. Had the manager switch that out...she swear they added extra rum...it was still watered and unsweetened, with abndnddded these natural tropical juices and pure cane sugar it's supposed to have in it. Switched my Sizzling chicken and shrimp because I've never had marinara on my shrimp...grilled shrimp with cheese is perfect, who f*cked that up!?! My boyfriend ordered a salad with Vinigarette...they brought him ranch, he tells the waitress and I had to end up going to track down the Vinigarette because they are short staffed. This was the worst night and we came all the way from Antioch instead of going to Opry Mills because of our previous experiences here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro
Chris C.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,4,,1.0,6/15/2017,"I wish there was a way to remove some stars from some of the positive reviewers.  My wife and I along with our two grandsons decided to give TGI a try since it had been some time since eating at one.  We soon realized why we stopped eating there. She ordered the JD chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli, the potatoes were inedible due to barely being above room temperature. Her chicken appeared to have the texture of chicken that was in a bag and boiled to imperfection, tough and dry. We told the server about the potatoes and he brought more out in the same condition. One of the grandsons got sliders with fries. I had a bite of the slider and it wasn't terrible and the fries were ok. My other grandson had the mac and cheese with mandarin oranges. when it came out it was obvious they had peeled some naval oranges and cut them up.  We didn't try the mac and cheese but he wouldn't touch it and he normally eats it up. When we were ordering, we asked the server what kind of pasta was used in the mac and cheese and he was confused and finally said it was made with ""C's"" to which I replied, ""Elbows"" and he said yes. I ordered the house salad and it was nothing special, but it was acceptable. At the end of our meal, we asked to see the manager and told him about the oranges and he advised it was a delivery issue.  We also told him about the potatoes and chicken and he did comp her meal which was only fair since she didn't eat it past a couple of bites. After leaving there we headed on down to Chick Fila and go dinner.   Save your time and money and don't try this TGI location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro

Cecilia M.,"Murfreesboro, TN",0,3,,1.0,9/13/2017,"We visited this TGI Fridays on a Saturday like around 8 or so, needless to say the place was dead. As soon as we walked through the door I noticed the sticky floors and there was no one at the host stand. The manager had come by and she was on the phone and told us to wait a moment as she was on the phone with her boss. Anyhow it was my daughter, husband and myself, we in the mood for some endless apps. We should have know from the sticky floors that this wasn't going to start on a good note. Our waiter who also was tending the bar took our drink order and he didn't write anything down. It was just 3 drinks and he forgot one of the drinks when he came back to the table. This kept happening throughout the entire dinner. We ordered the mozzarella sticks, pot-stickers and boneless chicken wings. The only thing that was good was the mozzarella sticks. The pot-stickers were not hot and tasted really doughy like not properly done, the chicken wings were just breading. We placed and order for the salmon, a chicken sandwich and a hamburger. The salmon came out super charred at the bottom, completely inedible. The hamburger wasn't done like we asked, again the waiter wrote nothing down and the fries were cold. I ordered the chicken sandwich and it tasted more like a fish sandwich versus chicken. The whole meal was such a disappointment, not to mention that the silverware was dirty and my husband had to physically get up and get some clean silverware himself. The manager had come by and asked us if there was anything else that they could make for us, but honestly there was nothing that we wanted. They ended up taking off the fish and hamburger off the ticket but the bill was rather high for just some apps and a lousy chicken sandwich. The waiter asked us what is it that we wanted him to do and to me as that isn't a question that should be asked. If you work in the restaurant industry you should know what measures need to be taken when something like this happens. The customers shouldn't have to do your job for you. I wish we were allowed to give 0 stars because this TGI doesn't deserve even one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro
Amy S.,"Murfreesboro, TN",13,125,117,3.0,1/3/2016,"I've been here a few times and the food is always good. Cooked perfectly and always taste fresh.  My mom and I recently went here for a late lunch on Saturday at 2pm. Since it was pass rush hour for lunch we thought it wouldn't be too busy. Which it wasn't, seemed like some servers were on lunch themselves. Took 5-10 minutes for someone to come get our drink order. We ordered the strawberry passion fruit tea and the tropical raspberry tea, which we literally got at the end of our meal. Waitress kept apologizing because the bartender had to make him but he was occupied by the 2 girls at the bar. The person who ended up making them were the bus boy, bless his heart, he tried but the tasted horrible. He was reading the booklet to make them.  We ordered the pretzels for our appetizer which surprisingly were jumbo and so soft. They were delicious with the beer cheese. I got the New York Cheddar burger and my mom got the Jack Daniels Burger which was both delicious.  Maybe on my next visit the staff would be on point or don't order the teas that the bartender has to make.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro

Melissa B.,"Louisville, KY",692,1154,12100,5.0,4/25/2013,"Best Wings Ever!!!  Tony and I went to the TGI Friday's in the parking lot of the Stones River Mall in Murfreesboro, TN. We enjoy the Friday's at Opry Mills Mall..so we thought we would try this one too.. They have Thursday specials of $3 Appetizers and $3 Drink specials.  We enjoy this restaurant and the menu alot. We ordered the Hot Wings with Traditional Buffalo Sauce with Blue Cheese and Ranch Dressing with Celery. We also enjoyed the Spinach Artichoke Flatbread and I had my usual Iced Tea with Lemon and Lime and Tony enjoyed a couple of Budweisers on draft. The ticket was only $23 with taxes..Great deal and the best Wings!!! We will definitely eat here again and again!!! I recommend it to everyone!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-murfreesboro
