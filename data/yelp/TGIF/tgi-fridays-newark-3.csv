Jack C.,"Hockessin, DE",2,54,3,5.0,11/11/2017,"Love this particular TGI Fridays at the Newark DE location. The food is always good and service is wonderful. We came today, Veteran's Day because they offered free lunch to the vets in the family. It was a very pleasurable experience.  After the meal the waitress thanked the vets at our table.  Then before leaving the manager came over with a coupon for each vet and personally thanked them with a handshake. It was quite moving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3
Renee D.,"Philadelphia, PA",56,145,555,4.0,8/10/2016,"Out of the three Friday's I frequent, this one on 896 is by far my favorite for a few reasons. 1. The bar is huge and there is always a lively crowd. 2. The bartenders are attentive and know how to handle the large crowds. 3. Video bingo! The start time has varied between 6:30 and 7:00pm. There are three rounds played each with a theme. The first person to get bingo wins a 10.00 gift card. The crowd is always into it and it's so much fun hearing everyone sing along.  One of my girlfriends ordered the endless apps which now includes the entire variety. One thing I did not like was the BBQ Flatbread. While it looked appetizing it tasted mostly of onions. Even after picking them off the flavor stayed behind.  My other girlfriend had the sad misfortune of sitting next to a nice enough guy who just so happened to wolf down said appetizer and proceeded to torture her with  his horrid breath. She finally had to turn her back to him.  Not good Friday's especially when people are trying to mingle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3
Jay B.,"Olney, MD",111,2,,1.0,12/5/2017,"I would literally put no stars if that were an option. Service was horrible - sat at a table in the bar for 20 minutes until I found out no one would serve the table. Then asked to be seated where there would be a server, and the host was rude and I had to wait for 5 minutes on a dead Tuesday. Once I was seated, ordered a glass of wine.... which took 15 min to be delivered. Ordered a bowl of soup and my entree. Entree came, but no soup. Server eventually brought it. And honestly, I would've been better off if the food never came at all because it was terrible - steak and both sides over cooked. Never a fan of chains but ate here for the convenience of it being attached to my hotel - This will never happen again. Also, TGI Friday's, you should probably send someone from your corporate office to look into the management here unless your plan is to close down and sell the building space soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3
Robert L.,"Middletown, DE",1,13,2,1.0,8/11/2017,"Very disappointed.  They advertise one thing, yet change their policy without notification.  Complaining to the manager was a waste of time. I guess we won't be returning anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3
Nck S.,"Waxhaw, NC",0,20,3,3.0,4/23/2017,This place has really gone downhill.  Can't make a proper Black and Tan. What I got was a brown. Beer selection is still good.  The food doesn't have the quality it used to have.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3
Jennifer L.,"West Hempstead, NY",4,175,1,5.0,10/2/2017,This Fridays is great. The French  Onion Soup is very good. The Pot stickers are excellent. The Chicken Fingers were also delicious. The Strawberry Daiquiri was fantastic.  My dad had the burger which was said was great. The waitress was nice and friendly.  I give this place a two thumbs up.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3
Caisie R.,"Elkton, MD",0,11,,2.0,5/16/2017,"Always freezing cold & super dark in this place. Always seem to get sat back in a dark cold corner. Service is always running around like chickens w their heads cut off even though every time I've been there, they are always slow. Food is ok if you like jack Daniels bbq sauce on absolutely everything. Their drinks are always made incorrectly as well, but not far from UD, so it's prob a lazy student who just finished 8 hours of classes to go to bartend at a slow bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3
Kamila M.,"Newark, DE",53,268,33,4.0,1/23/2016,"I always enjoyed going to TGI Friday's as a high schooler for some apps. I went the other day for lunch and order the rotisserie chicken salad sandwich with a side salad. I thought this sandwich was extra delicious. The bread was very crispy. I like that TGI Friday's offers the smaller portions for a lower price. That's a good deal! Overall, good food but poor lighting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3
Liz B.,"Garnet Valley, PA",0,12,,5.0,5/13/2017,"Stopped in for a bit before a game. Sat at the bar, plenty of seats and great tv s. Two super female bartenders. The food was delivered fast and was exactly as ordered. Had the turkey BLT with a side salad. Delicious",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3
Steve S.,"Parsippany, NJ",562,1174,285,3.0,12/31/2014,"So I stopped in at this TGI Friday's because I just dropped my daughter off at field hockey camp and was waiting with one of her other teammates who had a later check in. It was lunchtime,  we were hungry, it seemed like the right thing to do. I view a place like Friday's like I do a Dunkin' Donuts - all I want is consistency and good service.  We were seated quickly and our waitress brought us our drinks right away. Not a bad start. Then we put in our order and waited, and waited, and waited some more. It wasn't like we had a complicated order: a Jack Daniels burger with fries and a chicken Caesar salad.  Food finally arrived it was actually pretty good and did what it needed to do, filled us up. While I don't like to eat at a place like Fridays when I'm traveling, because I can eat at one at home, I took this opportunity to just get some food. They did a good job though the service was a little slow but that wasn't the waitresses fault. Overall a decent lunch fairly cheap and we were out pretty quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3
Randy G.,"Chesapeake, VA",10,60,17,2.0,11/25/2015,"First the bar area was extremely loud. They were running it as a neighborhood bar. I found it to be unpleasant.  Second, our server was nice but unsure of how things were served. My 5 year old wanted the kids chicken sandwich. We were assured it was breaded not grilled. Guess what! It was grilled. We exchanged it for chicken tenders.  My burger was good but my wife's salad was not.  Bottom line...I would not recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3

Lucky M.,"San Jose, CA",0,59,3,1.0,4/4/2016,"Ok, the first time I ordered their food when I stayed at the embassy suites.  I was shocked they charged me 22% fee for delivery.  What a rip off. This time around, I ordered and picked up the food myself.  The waiter came up to me and handed me the bag.  No hello or anything.  I paid in cash and he asked me sarcastically if I wanted my change back.  I said yes.  5 min later he came back and said ""mam are you sure you want your change its only 20 cents?"".  Was he expecting a tip ?! I'm done and will not going back.  Avoid!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3
Natalie T.,"Dover, DE",2,3,1,2.0,2/6/2016,We brought our grand daughter for her eighth birthday and were very surprised to be told that the staff wasn't allowed to sing happy birthday. We went out of our way to come here because we've always enjoyed the staff singing. We must have misunderstood the waitress because we thought she said although they didn't allow singing that they could bring her a dessert. We were surprised to see her dessert on the bill. We were a bit disappointed and so was our grand daughter.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3
J B.,"Wilmington, DE",0,8,,1.0,8/10/2016,"Have been sitting here for 30 minutes waiting on chicken fingers and a sandwich with a friend. The server just came to verify what we got. And oh.....

David H.,"Trenton, NJ",128,928,673,4.0,4/27/2015,"Very nice. Attached to the Embassy Suites, but not associated anymore due to Embassy not paying their bills. I had the Dogfish Head 90 IPA on tap which is always good and a great Delaware born beer. Complimented by the 3 for $12.20 appetizers of green beans, wings and pretzels. They were out of pot stickers. Too much food for one person so much went back. All snacks and dips were very good. Waiter was excellent. Very attentive. No more endless apps. Oh well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3

Ashley N.,"Baltimore, MD",23,109,13,3.0,8/21/2015,"We stopped in here on the way home from Atlantic City and were tired and hungry. Not usually do we go to Fridays. But... This place was on the way. The waitress had so many tables but was hustling them well.  the sampler appetizer was good-- the pretzels weren't appealing to the eye but were very delicious. As were the boneless wings. Hubby and I both got burgers, he a bacon cheeseburger and I the veggie burger. It was very delicious. And it hit the spot. Refills were coming on the regular. The restaurant itself was freezing in temperature. But I'm sure the waitresses were running around all hotlike. We probably won't return to this location, but I'll be more open to going to Friday's once in awhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3
Luna L.,"Wilmington, DE",0,15,1,1.0,11/9/2015,"TLDR: Bland, bland, bland and overpriced. Food was way overpriced for the portion sizes, and wasn't tasty to boot.. 4 bacon wrapped jalapeño peppers for $12. $18 for a flat iron steak that must have been a grand total of 5 ounces. It was seared too much leaving a burned taste in my mouth. Also it lacked any form of seasoning - it needed salt BADLY. The steak came with two sides. Mac and cheese tasted like someone still in first year culinary school made it, and the parmesan fries were just bland. Salt isn't completing something complicated. Salting stocking properly is very basic. How do you mess this up?  Will not visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3

Jennifer D.,"Hamburg, NJ",0,13,,3.0,11/12/2014,"The restaurant was adjacent to a hotel I was staying at over the weekend, otherwise I would probably not have chosen this particular chain. Arrived shortly before 10, in advance of the rest of my party, and requested a table for 15.  The front staff was happy to accommodate my request. Once our party was seated, our server Ilene was very friendly and helpful.  She was able to give individual checks for all groups in our party, which ended up being 20 people. The food was good for what it was - not gourmet, but decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3?start=20
Colleen J.,"Newark, DE",0,1,1,5.0,4/2/2015,"We had an overall great experience for a franchise restaurant. In the past, i think we have been there 3 times before. We were told the menu options had been updated months ago according to our server, Shane. By the way, he was fantastic. Not intrusive, and seemed to appear at the exact moment we needed something. The children liked their options and liked their food from the kids menu. They were given a good portion and daddy ate some of their fries.  At a cheap cost, they also were able to get dessert. My dinner of sirloin and vegetables was so delicious. My husand asked many times if i wanted a bite of his cheeseburger, but i was full and content with my own dinner that i could just take his word that the bacon cheeseburger was awesome. We got there at 5:30 on Thursday. We were seated quickly and served promptly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3?start=20
Kelly R.,"San Jose, CA",156,131,192,4.0,2/24/2013,"TGI Friday's surprisingly has some really good drinks. Like some of the best drinks I've had in awhile. I'm not really a chain restaurant kind of gal, but I do love me some Friday's from time to time. For appetizers, I've tried the pretzels, the green bean fries, the queso dip and the spinach dip. The pretzels and the green bean fries are pretty good. Pasta is pretty yummy, and their salads are pretty good and surprisingly filling. My boyfriend really enjoys the Jack Daniels entrees. Okay, back to the drinks. I'm not a *huge* drinker, but I love the ones here. Pink Punk Cosmo has COTTON CANDY in it. It's awesome! Mango Lemonade is the best I've had and I love their new Tropical Hurricane. And HOLY MOLY, their Orange Creamsicle milkshake with Cointreau? To die for. That milkshake deserves 5 stars itself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3?start=20

Brian M.,"Silver Spring, MD",6,8,,2.0,8/1/2014,"The only reason I give this one 2stars is I want to save the 1 star ratings for the really bad ones. French fries cold, clam chowder microwaved and cold in spots.  However the Waitress was great, in fact so was the manager when he brought back the hot fries. Good people, but they work in one of thousands of mediocre corporate "" restaurants"". What can you say, it was late, and the only thing open.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3?start=20

Barbara R.,"Manassas, VA",20,5,,1.0,10/18/2015,"Where do I start? We were a party of 9 that was accommodated pretty quickly with a table, all down hill from there. After first round of drinks when our waiter does show back up for refills, said he had to take our glasses first because they were out of them, then returned with our refills back in to go cups! We ordered our food, exactly 45 minutes later our food arrived minus two of our guests meals, after the waiter announced he would be right back with the other two meals he came back 10 minutes later to apologize that somehow he left their two meals off of the order he put in. How does that happen? Asked them if they still wanted their food?!?! I asked for the manager at that point. When she arrived at the table she apologized and said that if they still wanted their meal she would cover it! Really, that's it, waited 45 min for food and you will cover the meals that had not arrived, in fact have it been even started their kitchen. Will be calling GM on Monday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3?start=20

David R.,"Elkton, MD",3,26,2,3.0,4/19/2013,"I haven't been here in a long while, now I remember why. We ordered our appetizers, then ordered out main course a few moments later. In about 15 minutes our appetizers came out, that'd not too bad but then our main course came out right behind them. Our table was cluttered and we couldn't enjoy our apps before taking on the main course. Next, my medium well was WELL done. The food had really good taste, that's the only reason I gave them 3 stars. The Jack Daniels items were delish'. Then we get back to the norm, my wife's dessert's spoon was laying in the caramel/chocolate syrup. So we asked for a clean spoon. Our waiter, on his way back to our table with the spoon decides to stop and talk to two other tables before bringing the spoon. My wife's ice cream was melting. But it did taste pretty good. Well, I better stop before I decide to give them only 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3?start=20
Steve J.,"Roanoke, VA",0,3,,1.0,12/21/2015,"Checked in late at the Embassy Suites and decided to eat here because we wouldn't have to drive anywhere. Pretty mediocre all around.  I got the half rack of ribs which came with fries and cole slaw.  Both the ribs and fries tasted like they had been cooked the day before and had been sitting under the warmer since then. I was very hungry, so I ate the ribs but couldn't eat the luke warm limp fries. The slaw was actually ok. My wife got a salad with ""crispy chicken"". The chicken came out cold. She sent the meat back and they made a fresh piece for her (she was done her salad by the time it came out), but even that didn't taste as good as something from a Sam's Club frozen bag (I.e. pretty bad). My daughter got a rib eye and sweet potato fries. She loved it, but she had been living on college cafeteria food for 4 months and this was the first steak she'd had in a semester. I had a bite and it was OK, but no where near worth the price. The sweet potato fries also tasted old.  If you are staying at the Embassy Suites here and have the time, check Yelp for something better nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3?start=20
Morton F.,"New Castle, DE",83,922,3709,3.0,11/28/2010,"I revisited this TGI Friday's today and service seems to have improved greatly at the host station. The restaurant was also significantly less noisy this time. However, the server seemed a little eager to hurry my meal along. (I'm a slow eater.) I still have concern over value for money. Portions seem to be on the small side for what you're paying. However, TGI Friday's does send out a lot of high-value coupons through their mailing list so if you go to Friday's at all, it is a good idea to sign up for their deals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3?start=20

Vernon G.,"Newark, DE",164,20,7,4.0,4/4/2013,After a night at the movies we decided to go to Fridays. This location is nice for people who are traveling because its located attached to the embassy suites hotel and right in the middle of University of Delaware. As soon as we got into the door we were seated immediately which was great because we were starving. Our waitress was awesome. She was very knowledgeable and engaged in our conversation and she made as all laugh. We all had potstickers to start and they are always so good along with the pretzels with the cheese. The pretzels with cheese are awesome. I had the salmon with lobster crunks on it and its was great. It had a slight spice to it which I love. My only concern with my dish was it seemed to be alittle light seeing as though I paid 18.00 for the dish and everyone elses plate was full of food. Our waiter kept refilling our drinks without us asking. We had a great time and overall I woukd recommend this location to anyone.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-newark-3?start=20
