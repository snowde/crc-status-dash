Brook B.,"Amsterdam, NY",133,26,48,3.0,10/11/2017,"It's convienent if you're staying at the hotel attached to it, but there's also a Rainforest Cafe right next door. The French onion soup was good, but my French dip just tasted like salt and when I dipped it in the sauce, it was even saltier. My mom got fried shrimp and they were extremely salty as well. Their Mac and cheese was good, and their flavored iced teas are great as well. Other than the food not being great, our server was friendly to us but made it very clear that she didn't want to be there, moaning and groaning as she cleaned up around us. I get it, we've all felt like that, but it was just unprofessional.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls
Amanda K.,"Austin, TX",902,1369,1441,2.0,6/17/2017,"Ugh my hubby and I came here due to getting extra Marriott points and in need of food after a long drive from upstate NY. Mini vacation  We came here around 6:30-7 on a Friday night. It was hardly busy by any means. Which should of been an indicator that food wasn't great??!! We both ordered the ultimate size margaritas. Basically lemon lime mix with no booze, ugh. Seriously tasted no booze nor felt anything. I know my tolerance isn't that high. Haha My husband ordered the chicken fajitas which came out 5-10 mins before my meal. His meal was okay, I mean can you really mess up fajitas?? No, well you shouldn't be able to.  My meal was the dragonfire salmon meal. I ordered broccoli and mixed veggies. I told the waitress I had a dairy allergy and she informed me the rice is premixed with butter. Boo but thanks for the heads up. When my meal came out my salmon was meh and overlooked.  Overall we left after being full from an overpriced meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls
Karen M.,"Markham, Canada",233,300,3857,4.0,4/6/2017,"The Chicken & Shrimp Sizzling Dish was a sizzling skillet of onions and peppers and cheddar cheese mashed potatoes of melted Colby and Monterey Jack cheeses.  The chicken and shrimp were tossed in a zesty roma tomato-basil salsa. When it arrived to the table, it was indeed sizzling and smelled amazing of cheese! I especially liked the cheddar cheese mashed potatoes since it was so smooth and cheesy.  The shrimps were flavourful and firm.  The chicken, while a tiny bit dry due to white chicken breast, was still flavourful from the seasoning.  All in all, I really enjoyed this dish and wished that there was even more melted cheese on the skillet to eat from. The Cobb Salad had diced, sliced chicken breast, crisp bacon, avocado, cheddar cheese, egg, black olives, tomatoes, and crumbled blue cheese atop a bowl of fresh salad greens (iceberg lettuce).  This was a beautifully assembled plate with each ingredient placed in rows on top of the iceberg lettuce; probably one of the best looking Cobb Salads I've ever seen!  After mixing it up all together and drizzled with salad dressing, it was a very full and filling salad.  The array of different ingredients made the salad so fun to eat.  I especially enjoyed the fresh crumbled blue cheese and appreciated how much there was of it! The service that night was decent too with our server returning to check up on us from time to time during the two hours that we were there enjoying the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls

But this establishment is AWFUL (Disclaimer: we came here because it was 11pm, right next to our hotel, and we were hungry) Medium JD burger was cooked well-done. Full rack of ribs was dry. Didn't try the French dip sandwich because it didn't even look appetizing. Apple crumble was a disgrace to desserts.  All the waiters/waitresses look 15 years old.

Very nice and clean restaurant. Their music is loud. Servers were young, not so friendly. Really into their phones which sucks since it's the one of the few locationsin Ontario.

Amanda C.,"Vancouver, Canada",241,188,216,2.0,7/7/2016,I thought TGIF's was a safe bet for a late night dinner because I had been to many in the states...

Dean C.,"San Jose, CA",575,680,2384,3.0,6/29/2015,"6/29/15: So coming from California where there are tons of TGIFs I thought I knew what to expect. First thing you see walking in is like 3 or so pages taped to the wall about all the coupons and groupons they do not accept. Also something about not being part of some business group. That's a lot of negativity there and surely is a bad sign cause most businesses in good health know that refusing coupons is bad publicity to save some chump change.  I am typing this review right now cause it's been a 1/2 hr and they still haven't brought our food... So I'll keep writing... Sitting here in this example of a nice American chain.... The hour hand moving... 1. Jack Daniel's Burger C$14.99: So I asked for my burger medium. The waitress apologized and said it had to be ""cooked all the way through. That's how it is in all of Canada.""  Okay... So... Running out of things to say cause they still haven't brought our food even though the restaurant is empty... Well guess I can talk about what we just did... Took the Hornblower ship out to the Niagara Falls!!!!!!  Totally amazing and absolutely worth it... Oh look food's here.. Alright I was afraid that the burger would be cardboard after that the waitress said but it was actually decent!  I think the meat might even qualify as medium-well!  Welp it was a ton better than what I was expecting. 5/10 2. Combo Chicken and Beef Fajita: And the chicken and beef were not overly dry either!  Not bad. 5/10 Alright... First time I finished a review before leaving the restaurant!  So though I had severe doubts (especially after seeing the frayed and torn menus) the food was actually okay... 3/5 #american",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls
Stacey C.,"Sehome, Bellingham, WA",124,1,,1.0,8/21/2017,"Never felt so uncomfortable walking into a restaurant before. My family and I were visiting Niagara Falls and wanted some quick dinner and decided to go to Fridays because it was close to our hotel. We walked in and were STARED at and looked up and down by the 4 or 5 hostesses standing at the desk. None of them asked how we were doing or how many people we had. They just stared at us until one of us walked up to the counter and asked for a table in which they reluctantly wrote our number down. The restaurant was relatively empty and 5 other families (who came in after us) were seated before us. I'm not sure if your hostesses have never seen non-white people before or what, but try and do some diversity training for your staff so people of color don't feel like they're not welcome. We will not be returning or recommending this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls
S C.,"Red Bluff, CA",8,223,671,2.0,6/17/2016,"We visited this location while on vacation in May of 2016, being from California we were familiar with this chain and it was attached to our hotel and so we thought, how convenient. This place was not like any TGI Friday that I have ever visited. The drinks were smaller and the wait time seemed extremely long considering the place was practically empty when we were seated. I am not sure if this was the location or the city's taxes, but this meal ended up being one of the most expensive meals that we had in all of Toronto and the NYC area. Who knew that TGI Fridays was so expensive- right? The food was average and the service just adequate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls
Luz M.,"North Bergen, NJ",65,55,95,2.0,2/21/2016,"**post-dated: actual visit was 12/31/15**  Arrived at TGIF with my party of 6, I specifically asked for a table where a high chair could be placed. They gave us a booth for 6 people and wanted the high chair placed in the middle where people and hot food would be passing by.  As we sat down, we noticed that the table across was empty but had not been cleaned up. So we asked to be moved there, as a chair could be removed and the high chair would fit comfortably. The lady proceeds to tell me that a family had just left and they would need a few minutes. Well as we waited, I noted the receipt still on the table with a time stamp of 2 hours prior. Are you serious?? Such a central restaurant, in a tourist area, during a holiday season and the table is left I cleaned for 2 hours? Disgusting. The rest of the Meal was uneventful, typical tgif food. Soda refills were charged, ketchup bottle was empty and had to wait for a new one. One of us ordered a burger, while everyone else just ordered apps. We specifically asked for the burger and salad to come out ASAP, yet she brought it out after we were done with our apps.

Jessica B.,"Toronto, Canada",14,39,15,3.0,10/4/2016,Our waitress was upfront and honest about our questions with the menu. This helped us choose what to eat accordingly.

Omg I can't see through this haze of smoke!  For some reason it was really smoky inside and smelled like burnt popcorn. The menu was nothing special.  They only had 3 pasta choices and they were almost the same.  We ordered the fish & chips to be on the safe side with a Caesar salad on the side.  ($16.99 + $3.99). The salad was plain iceberg lettuce drenched in Caesar dressing, with only croutons and cheese... No bacon bits... No romaine lettuce.  Also, you could tell their mashed potatoes were from instant....  They also charge a ""T.I.F"" fee, which is a tourism fee.  You can ask for it to be removed, but it's small so we didn't mind. Only good thing is the pitchers of beer were only $12.

Stephanie R.,"Beerline B, Milwaukee, WI",136,667,652,2.0,8/31/2015,"We're familiar with Friday's although we don't go often. My wine, a Cabernet Merlot blend, was fine and the price for the pour seemed like a good value as well. The menus were pretty worn and had white stickers covering several of the former options, which limited the selections and didn't make a great impression. We sat at the bar and our service was good and the food arrived in a decent amount of time. The decor was updated and the restaurant seemed clean. My garlic marinated chicken breast had a bit of a cured texture to it, but other than that was fine.  My husband did mention that his fries were somewhat cold. As another reviewer mentioned, I did see several flyers posted by the hostess stand pointing out which offers they would not honor, and the staff at the stand were too busy when we left to thank us for being there or to bid us a good night. All in all our visit was OK, but not up to a U.S. Friday's experience and not probably what this establishment wants to put out there unless they are frequented by people constantly trying to get discounts they are not entitled to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls

The live music was great.  The singer had an extensive repertoire of classics and newer songs. It took forever for our waitress to come out and take our drink order.  We had been in the place for half an hour before she took our order.  The food when it got there was great.  My sandwich and salad were tasty.  My kids were happy with their meal.  There was next to no followup from the waitress.  When I went to the washroom, I found out the reason why.  The dumb bum manager had given her indoors tables to service on the opposite side of the restaurant!   We had to wait another twenty minutes for our bill and another 15 on top of that to pay.   So by the end of the meal, the total bill was $70, and we left a three dollar tip.  Servers might complain about families tipping poorly, but if they delivered average service then a full tip would be there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls

Heather D.,"Lake Mary, FL",6,11,,1.0,6/26/2012,"After driving for 11 hours we reached our destination in Niagara Falls and were happy to see a TGI Friday's next door.  We decided to stop in for dinner..it's was around 8:00pm and there were 2 adults and 2 children (6yo&4yo) in our party.   First, we stood at the hostess stand almost 10 minutes before anyone even looked in our direction.  There were maybe a total of 30 people in the entire establishment so it wasn't like they were soooo busy someone couldn't seat us.  While waiting for the hostess another party came in, stood for a few minutes and then left....we should have followed them!  If it wasn't for the fact that my son wanted to have dinner on the outside patio we would have left too! Once seated our server came right over and took our order...this was probably the ONLY plus to the whole meal. We were seated at a  dirty table and had to ask to have it wiped, would have thought it be standard to have tables clean before seating someone.   Our food/drinks arrived pretty quickly, however, after the food was set down the server walked away not even asking if we needed anything else.  We had NO utensils, napkins or condiments.  3/4 of the way in to the meal the server finally came around to ask if we needed anything.  By this time I began to eat my salad with my fingers and dipping it in to the salad dressing....all the while our server was standing at the next table chatting it up with the guests who were trying to leave.  By the time she brought us the requested items I was no longer interested in eating the salad as most of the leaves were brown and wilted when it was brought out.  I ordered the California Club and the menu indicated avocado slices...it was more of a tasteless avocado spread.  I've had this sandwich before so I know it's good, however, tonight it was mediocre, and that's putting it nice.

I'm a very picky eater though, and after 12 hours of traveling my family didn't want to walk far. This was right by the hotel so we popped in. There was a wedding reception that was VERY loud. It was quite annoying, but I suppose that isn't TGI's fault. They left before the main meal arrived thankfully. I got the chicken tenders and they were DELISH. The soda + fruit slushes are so yummy too!! The service was a little slow but the food made up for it. We went there again because they were the only restaurant willing to broadcast the Dallas Cowboys game! My mum and I split a salad and the chicken tenders, mixing the chicken into the salad. Yum!

Andrei A.,"Toronto, Canada",74,175,712,1.0,8/5/2013,"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! We arrived at Friday's in the evening after a terrible lunch at an Italian restaurant in Niagara on the Lake. We thought we'd experience the same quality of food as they have at Friday's in Brazil where ribs are thick and juicy. HA! Not so fast. We oredred baby back ribs for $24 hoping that they would look like on the picture. What we received instead were SUPER dry ribs, which looked like they spent a month in a freezer and were defrozen that morning. So, I politely complained and asked what our options were. The waitress was courteous and nice. She explained that they could either re-do the ribs or order something else. We ordered a 12oz NY steak, medium rare. What we got was a really cheap cut, with zero marbling and virtually no juice. On top of that, it was cold. Let me tell you, that waitress deserved a tip, but the fact remains that Friday's does not give a damn about the quality of its food. Possibly assuming that they don't need to worry about raising the mediocre quality of food given the endless torrent of tourists in that area. I, for one, will NEVER come here again. If you choose to maintain such poor quality of food, I hope more people will be dissuaded from going to your restaurant after reading mine and other reviews on this page.

Jonny C.,"Willowdale, Toronto, Canada",28,90,57,2.0,6/11/2014,"Arrived in Niagara Falls and was hungry after dropping our stuff at our Super 8 hotel.   Took a walk for 10 minutes East on Ferry Street and wound up here.  My best friend had not been here before so we decided to sit 'er down and eat.  These chain restaurants are pretty much found only in America and it's surrounding areas. Coming in there was a crowd of people waiting to be seated.  There were 3 hostesses looking at the seating chart as I approached them.  2 of them went to seat some families as I waited for the only hostess to look at me.  She was just staring at the seating chart for a while.  I spoke up and asked to be seated or if I had to give my name on the list.  She just told me to wait about 10-15 minutes and they would call me.  I saw a ton of tables empty, so I was unsure why there was some sort of a line-up. Viewing how much they were disorganized raised my eyebrows.  They did not take any names so they were collecting and selecting people to be seated based on their memory.  Pretty poor.  As people were seated, I stayed in the front so they would remember me.  Good thing too because if I didn't, new people would be seated before me. We got a table for 3 outside on the patio.  Pretty nice as the sun was beaming down on us.  Avery was our server and she gave normal customer service as she waited our table.  Big sized menu with lots of fixings and unhealthy choices.  Perfect for the weekend! I ordered the Jack Daniels burger without bacon with fries.  Looked pretty sick in the photo so I was definitely excited about it.  Unfortunately, when it came and took a bite of it, the beef patty was dry!   The condiments were fresh but it was below ""A-OK"".  It was not delicious in my opinion.  The fries were blah as was the Jack Daniels sauce it came with.  The whole burger in itself wasn't horrible, It was, I dunno... forgettable!   It wasn't a huge let down because this is a big restaurant chain and I still had my doubts anyway.  I was looking for average and got below average but not terrible.  Oh well, good to sit outside with the boys.  They gotta tighten up though their seating service at the front.  It's pretty flawed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls?start=20

I am not going to mince words. This place, situated in the Coney Island meets Vegas Strip portion of Niagara Falls(Clifton Hill area), is an overpriced tourist trap (overpriced even for tourist traps) with mediocre service and lousy food.   We ordered two entrees (lower end on cost) and two drinks(diet soda and tea), and left with a tab over $70.00 CAD. If the food was good, or served within a reasonable amount of time(which it wasn't), we might have been able to better swallow the cost. But the french fries seemed more steamed than fried, the burgers had no flavor, and weren't even fully cooked in the center.   With the wilted lettuce, I almost wonder if they put the whole plate in the microwave to finish melting the cheese.   Next time we'll be smart and pack extra sandwiches for the road if we come through at a late hour.  We won't be stopping here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls?start=20
Adele W.,"Pickering, Canada",127,378,1290,2.0,4/17/2012,"Although the kitchen was extremely slow, the waitress was friendly and the food was good when it finally got to us... but $40 for a burger, club and two pops? Outrageous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls?start=20
Ahmad C.,"Rochester, NY",0,4,1,4.0,3/29/2015,"I visit Canada about once a year and Fridays is a must. I have the Jack Daniels burger...extra sauce on the side and mayo (the sandwich doesn't come with it); excellent!!! The Burger is well seasoned as well as the fries...avoid coming when it's overcrowded; the service isn't at its best...otherwise, all burger lovers give the Jack-Daniels burger a try!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls?start=20
Jeff P.,"Alliston, Canada",35,82,127,1.0,10/12/2012,"Never come here.  Gross and expensive.  Never ever again.   Service was brutal, food was mediocre and just straight up never ever come here.  You would be much happier eating at McDonalds or something.  Believe me.  I feel like if I just had an apple I would have felt better.  Beware the hair in the food.  Also, when we told them about the hair, all they did was apologize.  Didn't offer to get us a new dish or freebies or anything, just a simple sorry.  Never come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls?start=20
Kristyn P.,"Toronto, Canada",103,400,91,2.0,5/12/2013,"New to me, wanted to check it out. Service was slow, and the seats around us empty.  The server was a trainee; so obviously he was nice, helpful, and courteous.  We ordered half rack of ribs, and fish & CRISPY fries.  After finishing my entire glass of water, the food arrived looking rather delightful.  My bf said the ribs were delish, but the fries were nothing to talk about (but you know I will anyway!).  The fish was okay if you like batter.  Now... on to the CRISPY fries.  USUALLY you can`t go wrong with simple french fries, but I found this s*it to be plain soggy.  Ugh.  The portions were large and `generous,` though I wasn`t really impressed by that at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls?start=20
Shawn P.,"Cambridge, Canada",0,6,,1.0,2/10/2013,"Where to start.  Poor.  Just plain old poor.  After a drive in, this place was handy, and we needed food.  I don't think we will use that excuse for food again.  Here's the short list of why we will never come back. 1. Deep Fried Green Beans and Cucumber Wasabi Ranch Dip - Deep fried beans were gross, the batter was gross, and we were informed that there was no wasabi and had to deal with ranch only.  I love wasabi. I really do.  But without it I'll never truly know if that would have saved it. I suspect even with it, it would have been gross. 2.  The Fajita Combo Platter - definitely an underachiever.  The meat seemed like it was press formed grilled and cut up.  There wasn't enough for the cost of the meal.  Just poor.  Although I did like the sizzling sound. 3. The waiter, not so hot.  After seeing that we had pushed the plate of barely touched beans to the edge of the table, he should have asked about it.  But he mentioned nary a word.  Hmmmmmm. 4. Should these places have a 30 min taste test to ensure fountain pop quality and and taste?  I think yes. To sum up, not gonna happen.  Although I have been assured, the locales in the states are much much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls?start=20
Trishia P.,"Fairfield, CA",250,544,352,1.0,6/15/2012,"Don't ask me what I was doing here (a family member picked this as a lunch spot) but the service was horrible!!! Okay first off the place wasn't even full and the offending staff person wasn't our main server, but man that guy was a smarta**.  We were a large group of 15, one member of our group asked for extra utensils since the place settings were just a whole bunch of tables bunched together.  The offending staff person was walking by when we asked for additional utensils. He said, ""Are you sure you need some more because it seems like everyone else has some..."" And then he just walks off. Like really, smarta**? Well our family didn't take that BS sitting down so we mouthed off at him when he passed our table again.  Then we spoke to the manager on duty who apparently didn't care to make amends. So we walked out on our order. Yup. We ordered tons of appetizers, drinks (alcohol and all) and full meals. But the staff here doesn't care to respect their patrons so why should we eat here? I bet they would of spit on our food if we stayed. I just felt bad for our actual waitress who was probably surprised when her section emptied out. Although after she took our orders and gave us drinks she never came back to us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls?start=20
San D.,"San Francisco, CA",28,257,12,1.0,9/29/2014,"Terrible. I ordered a salad, dressing on the side. I got a salad, drenched in dressing, with wilty lettuce. I didn't finish it. Also, completely dead at dinner time on a Monday night.

tom n.,"New York, NY",0,5,4,4.0,5/22/2015,"I had the chance to eat here the other day. Despite the construction next door (they are building a really cool Rainforest Cafe that will open at the end of May!) it was pretty accommodating. I was seated quickly and the server was prompt and took my order with a smile. The food came out quickly and was hot and delicious. Not sure what other people complained about, but my experience with the staff, the food and the service was very good. I would eat here again - in fact - will make it a point to come back as its close the the Falls and right at the hotel and near the casino.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls?start=20
Izzy T.,"Toronto, Canada",35,218,27,4.0,6/30/2014,"I'm saddened to see all the low-rated reviews here. TGI Friday's is undoubtedly my favourite chain restaurant in the world, and I am not ashamed to say I always seem to end up in it whenever I go on holidays anywhere! I only wish there was more of them in Ontario!   The main reason I prefer TGI's over other similar themed chain bar and grills is that I think the actual food holds up much better in TGI's than in many of its competitors. My visit to this location at the weekend reinforced this belief - my bacon cheeseburger and fries were just perfect - perfectly cooked, just the right proportion of toppings, with a fresh hot bun and those peppery signature TGI's fries (although I did notice they were not quite as peppery here as they are in other locations I've visited, they were definitely a bit more on the generic side...)   Our server was pleasant and helpful, and we enjoyed our meal in the cosy patio, complete with a lively singer belting out 'choons on an acoustic guitar. Perfect for a summer's day!   It is also worth noting that - in terms of burgers and fries at least - you'll pay $1-$2 less here than you would in some similar restaurants located nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-niagara-falls?start=20
