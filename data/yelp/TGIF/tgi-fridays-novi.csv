Elizabeth Y.,"Northville, MI",0,30,,3.0,7/22/2017,"I was debating between three and four stars but ultimately, the good did not outweigh the bad in this case.  The good: The food was what I expected, except for the pot stickers which exceeded my expectations of what seems to be a burger/steak joint. I would definitely order those again, and in larger quantities. However, I won't be dining in.  The bad: The lack of service. I stood at the hostess podium for ten minutes with numerous staff just walking by me. The professional attitude at even the most basic restaurant suggests that passing staff would at least acknowledge the existence of a waiting customer.  (This is actually my second attempt at eating here. The first time, the restaurant was dead and I waited at my table for 30 minutes without even so much as a drink order. That's only excusable on the busiest of days)  ""Someone will be with you in a moment."" Is it that so hard? Especially when the restaurant is so slow? It seemed our server Ashley, would be more attentive but as soon as the food arrived, she disappeared. We were desperate to get her attention, even just for a couple drink refills. I guess this is one place where the empty glasses at the edge of the table isn't enough of a hint. And if she ever walked near the table, we could have said something. But it was almost as if she was avoiding the work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi
Amy B.,"Rochester, MI",547,1181,306,3.0,1/1/2017,"I came here last night and haven't been to a TGIFriday's in quite some time. I don't know why, it just worked out that way. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but decided that 3 stars was more accurate about my whole experience. Fortunately, I was seated right away and the place wasn't super busy, especially considering it was New Years Eve (I ate ""early"" at 6:30 PM because I was dying of hunger.)  I was fortunate enough to have a really nice server who was amazing throughout the whole meal, which made a difference to me at the end.   For starters, I really didn't know what I wanted to eat, and ended up getting a burger.  My server did make a few recommendations on what he liked and was really good about conversing with me, but I ended up going ""simple"" and getting a standard cheeseburger.  I upgraded and got the sweet potato fries which were delicious, and I'm glad I did! Sadly, the burger tasted a bit over charred, to the point that by the end of the burger, it was just to much.  I know the menu description said charred burgers, but this was a bit much.  The sweet potato fries and the outstanding server seemed to compensate for the mediocre, over charred (to the point of almost tasting burned) burger I received for dinner. What would have made it 5 stars? I don't know that I can give specifics, but the experience wasn't bad at all.  I will say, I noticed a lot of dirty tables that hadn't been bused since I was seated to the point of me finishing my meal and checking out. I don't know if they were understaffed, but the whole time I sat at my table, I stared at a dirty booth with dirty dishes sitting on it straight across from me. I don't know if you can see it in the picture I took or not, but it sat there the entire time. Overall, a decent, solid experience all together.  I would return in the future, but not all the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi
Mignon S.,"Cass Corridor, Detroit, MI",0,7,,1.0,11/11/2017,"I'll keep this short...bad service and bad food. Well the food wasn't bad, bad, but it certainly was sub par...Luke warm and it took us fooooorrever  to get it and all we ordered were appetizers ‍. Just not a good experience and a complete waste of time and money.

Vicki P.,"Novi, MI",0,3,,1.0,12/14/2017,"This was quite literally the slowest service I have ever received at a restaurant at LUNCH time.  I came with 1 other person at 1:00 pm and there were less than 10 tables seated in the entire restaurant (now I understand why). So it clearly wasn't rush hour.  We waited for an hour, yes, AN HOUR for our food to come.  We ordered a salad & a French dip sandwich. Not exactly culinary masterpieces.  And when it arrived, it was lukewarm and gross.  I will NEVER come to this Friday's again!

Jenny K.,"Detroit, MI",311,195,2139,3.0,9/2/2017,"My daughter and I were hungry after a long night of shopping and decided to eat here. It's conveniently located near Twelve Oaks Mall, along with several other eateries. I had eaten here before, but it's been a while and I remembered they had good service. That still stands true, we were greeted and seated right away. Our waitress gave my daughter some crayons and a coloring page to draw on while I looked over the menu. I ordered the White Cheddar and Broccoli soup for my girl and a house salad with ranch dressing on the side to start. The soup was pretty salty and was hard to eat. The salad didn't seem very fresh as the lettuce was browning. I ordered the Sizzling Chicken and Cheese for dinner and shared it. That was very good, it came out ""sizzling"" as promised and tasted as good as I remembered. We were in and out and enjoyed most of the main meal. Overall, our service was great. The food was a bit underwhelming, however. With all the other options around here, I'd probably only come here when craving this dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi

Irwin F.,"Warren, MI",0,278,5,2.0,3/4/2017,"Very uninspiring. Our server seemed more interested in how long we would be eating so she could cash us out - vs clearing plates and getting our food out on time and together. Never saw a manager come over and ask how things were either. That is a turn off big time in the ultra-competitive restaurant industry. The food - decent, but 2 of the 5 in our group had frozen tasting/dry and boring dishes (meatballs/chicken flatbread).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi
M O.,"Bloomington, IN",13,191,,1.0,9/23/2017,"My mother and I met on Sat. night at this location hoping it wouldn't be as disappointing as the last time we came here 2 years ago.  We used to be regular customers here but stopped coming because of inept bar staff and terrible management.  We hoped after 2 years it would have improved.  It was awful. The bartender made horrible drinks and then, when we asked for something else, he never said, oh I'm sorry you didn't care for this - let me get you something better. He acted as if it were our fault.  The drink my mother ordered was so wrong and so un-drinkable. He lacked any customer service or bartending expertise. This is a bar with a huge bar menu and the bar was empty on a Saturday night. We should have known. Then the couple sitting behind us said they had received raw shrimp. The ""manager"" came out and threw the cook under the bus. The couple had the inept bartender, the ""manager"" and the ""cook"" come out to make excuses - not to resolve the problem. The couple were obviously on a date too -making this more appalling.. Nobody here takes any responsibility for the crap service crap drinks and crap food. No apologies to customers, just blame. Will never return to this location or any other TGIF. We walked to Red Robin for take out and they did a great job. Go there instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi

Tony C.,"Livonia, MI",86,297,55,3.0,12/14/2015,"As a kid, I loved TGI Fridays. I would even say it was my favorite restaurant.  Everything from the food, to the goofy s**t on the walls, to the service.  During my high school and college years I didn't go to Friday's as much but the times I did go I noticed it was changing.  Service was getting bad, the goofy stuff on the walls was starting to disappear, the menu was ho-hum.  I hadn't been to a TGI Fridays in probably 3 years... Went to this location for the first time.  I read the Yelp reviews but still gave it a shot as it looked the least full in the area.  We were seated quickly and a server came to our table quickly.  I found the menu hard to read.  The font was small and the descriptions weren't very appealing. Also the organization of the menu was odd - some items in one spot that should have been in another spot.   I went with the Jack Daniels chicken, it was ok.  Not the best thing I've ever eaten and not the worst. The sauce was good, the chicken seemed dry. The cole slaw wasn't much to speak about and the fries were--your typical fries. I thought the service was good!  She was attentive and quick with refills.  Seemed friendly too. I won't be running out of my way to Fridays anytime soon but I would go back if they weren't busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi
Sarah S.,"Brighton, MI",4,67,31,1.0,9/22/2016,"The worst TGI Friday's I've ever been to! The service is horrible! I came here on a Sunday with the four girls I care for. The place was not busy at all. There were maybe two people at the bar and one other table dining. We ordered our drinks and food right away. Everybody got their drinks (fifteen minutes later) except for the youngest child, who is 21 months. The waitress informed me that her chocolate milk needed to be made behind the bar and to give it a few minutes. Well, a few minutes turned into about a half hour. Our waitress was nowhere to be found. The baby was crying because she was so thirsty and upset her sisters has their drinks and she didn't. Ten more minutes go by and our food arrives. Still no drink. I mention it to the waitress again and she tells me she will go get the chocolate milk, but never does. She never even checks on us again until she brings us our check, which we were waiting for for nearly twenty minutes after we had empty plates. There was nobody around, it was ridiculous. Nobody to flag down, nobody to complain to. The staff was essentially nonexistent, but when they were around, they sucked.  If you want a good Friday's location, venture 20min West on 96 and eat at the Brighton location. Night and day difference!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi
Carolyn E.,"Detroit, MI",368,158,314,4.0,7/15/2015,"We came to Friday's because we received gift certificates from Corporate after having a terrible experience at the Southfield location.  This was the Friday's I know. The service was very good, the drinks were well made, and the food was good.  How can you go wrong with the Three-for-All and Jack Daniel's chicken and shrimp?  Lol  Everything was cooked really well, and the chicken was flavorful and juicy. My only complaint was their potato skins.  It seems like everyone is going the easy route and filling potato shells with, like, a loaded baked potato mash.  The potato itself is just kind of...mushy and tasteless.  Pick something else for the Three-for-All. Will I run back to Friday's?  Probably not, since I like to keep it local as much as possible and avoid chains, but if I must, this is a good choice.  It doesn't hurt that the kitchen stays open til 1 every night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi
Greta B.,"Ypsilanti, MI",49,91,391,4.0,5/4/2015,"Great location and service.  The manager and server were both very attentive.  We had ribs and chicken with veggies, which was only marginal.  The ribs were delicious, as was the Jack Daniels cake!!!  The rum punch drinks we had were only ok.  Not very potent!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi
Amelia L.,"San Clemente, CA",123,19,23,1.0,10/4/2015,"This is probably the worst TGIF around! I remember coming here as a kid and it was so fun and always a great family experience and the waitstaff was always friendly.  I waited at the host stand for over 10 minutes just to be recognized by the manager. God only knows where the host was at. We were seated near the bar which was nice until a group of super obnoxious people arrived. The service was extremely slow. My hubby got all you can eat appetizers. Horrible mistake. We will probably be here all night cause it's taking 15-20 minutes per order. How hard is it to drop wings in the fryer or fry some mozzarella cheese sticks.  The food is basic. Nothing special about this place, service sucked...overall it blew and I don't plan on coming back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi
Skylar K.,"East Lansing, MI",18,8,22,2.0,7/9/2016,"This was honestly the worst service I have ever received. Our waitress' name was Tori. First off our Long Island Ice Teas were so terrible that I'm sure my 6 year old cousin could have made a better drink. The food was alright at best, unfortunately my chicken was charred so much so that it left the most bitter taste in my mouth, I never believed until now that chicken could get so bitter. Also when you ask for fries extra crispy you'd certainly think that a soggy mess would be far from what you got however that is exactly what I received. The French dip was average at best, nothing to write to mom about and also not something that makes you question why you spent your money there. I ended up giving the tip our waitress (Tori) was supposed to receive to another waiter who was constantly checking in on us and making sure our experience was as enjoyable as possible. Waitressing 101 was obviously flunked by Tori, she yelled at us across the bar to ask if we wanted another drink, never asked how our meal was, never brought us our food and was quite frankly so much of a horny dits that she could not focus on anyone who wasn't male. So for future notice to anyone that goes there, if you are a male and sit at the bar I'm sure Tori will be more than attentive, however if you are a mother daughter duo who are out for a nice lunch, immediately request someone who can actually do their job, and someone who is not Tori.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi

Liz P.,"Clawson, MI",619,1189,2411,4.0,5/25/2014,"So I'm going to go ahead and be generous and give this Fridays a 3.5/5 stars, only because I've eaten here before and it's usually pretty good.  Starting off with the Pro's: the food today was delicious as always. My dad and I both redeemed Rewards from our Stripes, and he got the Jack Daniels flat iron steak and I got the chicken, with the tomato/mozzarella salad and mashed potatoes for sides. You get two HUGE pieces of chicken and I definitely had leftovers. My mom got the chicken skewers and liked those too.  We got our free Stripes app as well (chips and salsa) and that was also very good. Fridays seems to have revamped the look of its menu and it also has some new sides like cheddar mac and cheese.  I usually go to the Troy Fridays with a friend for their Sunday specials but it seems like those have changed too - they still have their daily 3-7pm happy hour but it's in the bar only, and we like sitting in booths.  Now, the Con's: my dad wanted to order the raspberry iced tea, which apparently they didn't have even though it's on the menu. The waitress suggested some sort of strawberry passion tea, and he ordered that and it was delicious. He ended up with 2 cups of it, only to find out later there were no free refills.... That's fine, but something the waitress should have at least mentioned.  I'd give this trip to Fridays three out of five stars but like I said, I've been to this location before and normally it's better. Hostess and waitress were both friendly, but I think the waitress was having issues figuring out all the coupons we were using (two Rewards and a free app) too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi?start=20
Yvette A.,"Ypsilanti, MI",0,23,69,2.0,11/22/2015,Our waitress was great. She was very attentive and had a great personality but I think she's needs to be a little more knowledgeable about about the happy hour menu and be ready to suggest adult beverages. The food was ok.

Rachel B.,"Farmington, MI",8,26,3,1.0,11/3/2015,"Awful. If you looked up over the top chain restaurant in the dictionary it would show Friday's. Out running errands with the kids and I had a coupon. I haven't eaten here in years, but figured I would try it with the coupon. Up selling everywhere. The waiter, crap all over the table, signs, etc. the menu/s were busy and confusing. I had look way too hard to find the food through all the pages of drinks. The menu was disorganized and confusing to read. The food was too complicated. No item was simple. It all had added toppings and flavors. I ordered a simple cheeseburger with American cheese and fries. I forgot to ask for the fries without seasoning. They came coated in salt and a ton pepper. Yuck. My cheeseburger came with cheddar cheese, bacon, onions and a chunk of ham mixed into the cheese? Those are all thing I'll eat, but not what I ordered. My teens had trouble finding things on the menu that were simple enough to eat. They ended up ordering off the appetizer menu. Even some of that was too fancy. We left with bad tastes in our mouth. The Sprite tasted funny, the iced tea did not taste fresh. The waiter was good. He definitely pushed the up sells, but he was attentive and friendly. Quick with drink refills.

Here is the best part, I left ,walked to the Famous Dave next door and I got the best service ever, after leaving I emailed TGIF headquarters, they emailed me back a week later saying sorry,a member of management will contact me and they asked for my phone number, a week later I get another email thanking me for sending my phone  number and a member of management will contact  me and it has been over a month since last email without any emails or phone calls. TGIF DOES NOT CARE AT ALL I honestly think they don't even deserve the one star rating I will never go there of let any of my family or friends go there either",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi?start=40
Reya M.,"Oak Park, MI",0,3,1,1.0,2/6/2016,"The only reason I'm giving them one star is because I have to!!! Ok, I eat Friday's probably once every couple of months. My family and I had a long day and we were all very hungry so I made the decision to go to Fridays (which I regret). To start off, our food took about 30-45 minutes to come out. As I mentioned before, we were all starving so this was an immediate problem. Secondly, my dad & I ordered the pasta and it came out super dry, his was missing the parsley, and both of ours was missing the red peppers. Our waitress didn't bring our food out and we pretty much didn't see her the rest of the night. After she took our order she didn't check on us one time. Anyway, the manager came to the table and asked if everything was tasting alright -_- first of all, she didn't greet us like a real manager would have. Only reason I knew she was a manager is, because of her clothes...which looked sloppy. She was very dry and she offered to recook my noodles in more sauce. My dad sent his back all together. The manager then came back with my food after another 10 minutes and after voicing our concerns on the wait, the quality of food, and the service all she said is ""I'm sorry, I'll talk to ur waitress"" her name is Val I guess short for Valerie. I then told her I was calling corporate and she said ""that's fine"" & came out with a piece of paper with her general managers name and number which was just the number to the store. I'll definitely be talking to a person higher up about her. She didn't offer anything off the bill, not a free dessert, NOTHING. Won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi?start=40
Kayla C.,"Plymouth, MI",0,4,,1.0,3/2/2015,I was here last night... I give this place one start but the manager on duty was really nice! My girlfriends and I wanted to go some where for food and drinks and we work around Novi. The waitress completely ignored us the whole time. She got my order wrong and I waiting 10 min for her to come back so I could tell her but she was no where to be found so I walked up to the bar and told the manager that we hadn't seen our waitress and we needed a few things and I needed my food taken back. He was super sweet and for the rest of the night he took care of us! I will never go back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi?start=40
P G.,"Redwood City, CA",9,69,27,2.0,9/26/2014,"Service was great. Can't say the same for the food. I ordered a classic cheese burger and cheese sticks. I asked for the burger to be burnt to a crisp and more than well done. Burger came out very lightly cooked and pink in the middle. I did not finish half of it.. Also ordered some grey goose and orange juice. That was heavily watered down.. Again, service was good hence the 2 stars. Wish I could give it more stars. Probably won't be coming here any longer. Also got charged more than the menu stated. Paid it all anyway, I just wanted out of there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi?start=40
Chad H.,"Southfield, MI",0,11,,1.0,10/10/2015,"We took the family there to celebrate my daughters birthday. The service was extremely slow, the servers were either understaffed or merely didn't care. When we got there the store wasn't too busy but it quickly started to become so. The manager spent a good 20 minutes chatting with the table next to us about guns while we sat 5 feet away with dirty dishes, empty glasses and no servers stopped by to see if we needed anything. When they brought my daughter her desert and to sing to her, the server said ""we couldn't round up enough servers to sing to her.""  We made this trip to the store to celebrate my daughters 10th birthday at her request and they did nothing to make the night a pleasure. I had to take my bill to the bar to get them to cash me out.  TGI Friday's is the one place I can get my kids to eat something other than Mac and cheese or chicken nuggets, so it's usually a pleasure to take my family there, but this location is far and away the worst store I've ever visited. They need to spend some serious time evaluating this location, especially the management and how the store is run. Terrible service and the food was not even on par with other stores. I don't know what else to say, we are completely disappointed in our visit. 2 hours in the store and to pay what we paid with poor service?  It may be a while before I visit a TGI Fridays again after this visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi?start=40
Neil P.,"Farmington, MI",195,44,4,4.0,6/4/2014,Good place to have a drink or get a quick bite to eat. usually order only an app cause I typically go in happy happy hour which has good both food and drink specials!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi?start=40
Eric J.,"Livonia, MI",127,9,,1.0,2/5/2013,"Attended this Friday's restaurant 2/2/2013 with a bday group. The food was wrong. The Manager had a terrible attitude. The parking lot wasn't plowed, still filled with snow. The evening was a disaster. Stay clear especially if you have a group of individuals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi?start=40
Melissa P.,"Novi, MI",135,5,,1.0,4/11/2015,"I dined in last night at this location and sat around the bar at a booth. Our server was a young man and I will not mention his name but the service was not up to par. For how slow this restaurant was he spent more time drinking a pop in the FOH or chatting with coworkers than focusing on his task at hand...being a bartender/server! When you are in the hospitality business, as I am as well, you make your money from your guests. So why spend more time with those who don't pay your bills? I ordered a drink with premium rum and could not taste it. Instead of sending it back and complaining I stayed compliant and asked for a shot of the rum that came in it. When I asked what kind that rum was he replied with, ""McCormick Rum"" which is $7 per bottle. What? How am I drinking well liquor when I'm paying $9 for premium? He laughs and says, ""I forgot my recipe for a moment!"" Does that mean my drink was originally made with well? Probably! No manager stopped by or at least never introduced themselves as a manager. I work for a corporate chain as a kitchen manager and can tell you I was impressed with the food...great job BOH! But for a restaurant that is supposed to focus on FOH flair and wowing guest...you dropped the ball!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi?start=40
Penandra P.,"Pleasanton, CA",1,88,23,3.0,7/5/2013,"Typical Friday's. Uninspired menu -- we finally ordered from the appetizer menu to get a variety.  Free dessert (2 scoops of ice cream, topping optional) for your birthday.  Dependable, but I wouldn't seek it out.  I would highly encourage folks to find an independent restaurant in the area instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi?start=40
Steven B.,"Downriver, Detroit, MI",159,49,3,4.0,5/11/2013,"Much better than expected. My server was very personable and knowledgable on the the menu. Had to remove a star because of the overall cleanliness.  I would recommend it if you are looking for typical American chain food, better than average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi?start=40
Daniel S.,"Troy, MI",0,12,,1.0,10/17/2013,"Went to this Fridays a week ago.  Since when is it ok for the host, to act obnoxious/disrespectful to the customers that want a table?  He kept repeating what I was saying, and wasn't funny.  Fed up, me and my date sat down at our table, he proceeded to follow us and made it more awkward by rambling on about his day and other nonsense that I couldn't care less about.  He wasn't funny, not being courteous, a nuisance, wouldn't stop talking, just being rude!  Why does everybody that work there have to be rude or annoying to everyone?  This isn't customer service, it's the mentality of annoying 6 year old!  Either they learn some serious customer relation skills or this fridays needs to be shut down!  And that host that works there shouldn't even be allowed in public!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi?start=40
Chuck H.,"Waterford, MI",1,95,,2.0,5/27/2012,"Pretty disappointing, but that's typical for this chain.  Two drinks, an appetizer and two entrees for $58 can be done much better elsewhere.  The kid who was our server was pretty good, so that was one positive for this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-novi?start=40
