Susie C.,"Forest Park, IL",106,498,254,3.0,10/11/2017,Just your normal TGI Fridays. We came for dinner on a Friday night with my family. The server we had (didnt catch her name) was nice and accommodating. Food was decent. We like that it has a lot of space.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oak-park
Maronda H.,"Chicago, IL",52,216,1259,2.0,11/22/2017,I really don't like to write reviews on local common businesses. TGI Friday's has been around for quite sometimes and a lot of people have dine here. I had a late dinner date. We just stopped in for a few drinks and eat something to coat our stomachs.  This location is not one of my favorite spots. It's always crowded with a bunch of loud and rude people and the customer service is not the best. The ladies room is never tidy.  It takes them forever to come to your table for you to place your order. The décor on the walls are the only thing that is nice about this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oak-park
Sabrina C.,"Chicago, IL",512,186,274,1.0,8/1/2017,"I totally wish there was a way to give a place ZERO stars bc this establishment would get it!!!  While walking in, there was a group of apparently disgruntled worked out there cussing and threatening to squeeze one of the other workers necks till her eyeballs popped out of her head (her words verbatim). They were all mad and complaining and fussing. Loudly. I didn't know who I should've warned about their eyeballs popping out from a choking.  I got here about an hour before they were closing but they were pretty much stacking chairs and shutting the place down at that point. Mopping. Giving warnings that they were closing soon so we had to hurry and order. By the time a waitress got to us, it was about 35 mins before they were closing. Oh, the table we sat at was gross, btw. Instead of greeting us or anything she says ""Do y'all know what y'all want?"" *blank stare* Tf?! Uh yeah, I'd like a table that doesn't have my feet sticking to the floor like I'm in the movie theater after a long weekend!!!!!! Ordering was a hassle and frustrating. I felt like I was trying to communicate what I wanted to eat, to my 17 month old son. Bruh. When the food came it was just OKAY. Very sub par. And there was no water offered to us. She actually didn't ask us if we wanted anything to drink at all. We had to repeatedly ask for napkins. I ordered a drink and it tasted like koolaid. The whole experience was utterly horrible. This place has fallen off A LOT. It's NOTHING like it used to be. You could once upon a time go here for karaoke night and have a good meal with friends but now the place is just ratchet, dirty, full of terrible employees and management, and trashy nasty food and drinks.  Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oak-park
Triana P.,"Berwyn, IL",0,10,22,2.0,9/7/2017,Endless apps are $12.99 per person. No sharing. No doggie bags. And you can only order 1 at a time.

Kate W.,"Oak Park, IL",217,1,,1.0,10/1/2017,"THIS PLACE IS THE WORST!!! Can I give it zero stars? I wish. They totally messed up my order. Like, worse than messed it up. And what they did give me was both dry AND soggy. How is that doable? I don't even know. I asked for them to bring me the proper meal, they refused. I asked if they could at least remake the crappy meal they did bring me, and they said no. I asked for a refund and they said ""Sorry, no, this is how the meal is served.""

Jessica L.,"Carol Stream, IL",133,4,1,1.0,10/1/2017,So I used a third party GrubHub to order from Fridays but they are just a delivery service. What my driver was given was not my order. I ordered a pecan crusted salad which you can review the menu what this includes. I was given a parmesean chicken breast taken taken off an Alfredo dish with nothing else. I ordered a 9 dollar appetizer of chips and spinach queso dip that had maybe 10 chips and the queso was so cold it was stiff. GrubHub and myself tried to contact TGIF for 30 mins before we could reach them. I was only refunded 12 dollars for the salad but was told that's how they serve the chips and queso and would not approve a refund for chips. So I spent 16.09 for tax and delivery of ten chips and cold queso. Never eat here!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oak-park
Tom P.,"Chicago, IL",24,78,4,1.0,4/7/2017,"This place needs to reevaluate on how they train people. Based on reviews on Yelp, I am surprised this place is still in business. Our server took a while to attend to us. She was not knowledgable with the beer menu especially when the menu encourages to ask the servers about local and craft beers that are not listed on the menu. I also was told my beers weren't on tap twice after making an order and she randomly named canned beers that they had. I never requested canned beer. I ended up going to the bar to tell her what I wanted because she seemed confused. She was friendly but showed no urgency in making sure we received our drinks in a timely manner. The food came on time because other people brought it in. We asked for separate checks. What did we get during bill time? She came in with one big sheet of paper with all of our checks and she was reading our bill amount separately. We had to request that it needed to be printed separately. It felt like she just got hired and was thrown on the floor. I don't recall seeing a manager either. She seriously was not organized. I really feel she was not properly trained.  I will never go to TGIs again. My wife has been boycotting for years after finding a piece of chewed steak in her water at another location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oak-park

LaCasha L.,"Chicago, IL",23,1,,3.0,8/30/2017,"Me and a couple of my girlfriends went to this location, during lunchtime. Normally this location have good food. This time we tried the ""Endless Apps"". The boneless chicken was lukewarm and taste like an off brand chicken. The bacon nachos lacked bacon and the chips were cold. The chicken enchiladas lacked chicken and were paper thin. So much so, they stuck together. The meatballs didn't taste like beef and were also lukewarm. We pretty much had to inform the waitress to tell the cook we wanted HOT food. The frozen TGIF wings at the store tastes sooo much better than this restaurant. I thought that was weird. My Mudslide could've had more chocolate sauce. I did enjoy the potstickers. They were perfect. I won't try this special again.

When you arrive they open the doors for you, you are greeted with a warm welcome. Since we are regulars there we of course have our favorites LOL. When we go we usually go at lunch time and ALWAYS ask for Andre, he is the best server we have ever encountered.

Once we sat down it took about 15 minutes before someone even came over to ask about drinks because they were goofing off in a cluster next to the registers.  Now I don't mind if you are not busy and goofing off - but I was looking over trying to get someone's attention but was ignored.  The food when I finally ordered? Well I got the Key Western Shrimp that came with steamed broccoli. Half of each of the two shrimp skewers were cold, but cooked.  Cold Shrimp (esp since it's not cocktail shrimp)...eww.I decided that asking about it and having to wait wasn't worth the effort.   In summary, poor service, poor attitude, and sub-par food.  I won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oak-park?start=100

Can we sit? are we supposed to take a seat and wait? they looked like we asked them a million dollar question, looking stumped as a log. The ""manager"" had to apologize for her. So we sat down and waited like we were supposed to? After waiting, im not sure, the host was just a horrible communicator, I had no idea what she was saying. We were seated, girlfriend went to the bathroom, the host came by and threw the silverware on the table. I thought it was just very rude. They just really had a lack of communication and politeness. I ended up ordering a drink and left, because i felt the service wouldn't be too great if you're already throwing silverware on the table.

Areli R.,"Franklin Park, IL",17,117,,1.0,7/11/2015,"After telling myself I would never return, I was in the area once again and my husband wanted Friday's, I said what the heck, let's go. We were inside the restaurant for 3 hours!!! It was a madhouse and our server was running back and forth apologizing each time for the long wait. We placed or order about an hour after we were seated and waited for an eternity for it. The server brought my hubbys meal first and told me mine would be up right after bc the couple behind us left without paying. What does that have to do with my food taking longer?!? Absolutely nothing! Server left, went outside to talk to cops. So, now bc shitty people walked out, it became my problem. Whatever, I remained calm. My order was ready about 10 minutes after my husband's, my order was wrong bc server never wrote down the order! I sent the ribs back and they remade them while I ate my well done, bloody steak. Yuck! I waited 25 minutes for ribs, told them to box them as I was already disgusted with everything. They bring me my remade ribs and I opened box and they remade my wrong order!!!! By now, I thought it was a joke but then realized that it's just a shitty restaurant with shitty employees! They remade my ribs and yes I waited again.....Not once did they offer to comp my meal or buy me a drink or have the manager say something.

My friends and bf are all a fan of this food and the prices really aren't that bad. We like to stop here for lunch before catching a movie at the Lake. Most times parking is not an issue and we can get into the free lot but if not there is a pay lot close by.  The hosts and waiters have always been nice and prompt. We have never had to wait an excess time for our drinks or food and our orders have always been correct. Last time we were here we even received a free $10 gift card from management since it was ""our lucky day!"".  The food here is what it is; it's not a 5 star gourmet restaurant so don't complain when the food tastes like it came from a freezer bag into a microwave and then to your plate because it prolly did. I do like their Captain Morgan wings and the brushetta chicken pasta is a favorite with all of us.

Cee. D.,"Chicago, IL",8,159,31,3.0,9/3/2010,"I attended a birthday celebration at TGI Friday's in Oak Park on Wed Sept 1 2010 (KARAOKE NIGHT) and had a BLAST.  I hadn't been to this TGI in many many years, or any other.....having never liked the food. The only downfall was, I hated the drink (BB Margarita Shaker - $7.99+$1.00 tax) that I ordered, it was a complete waste of $.....tasted awful.  I should have returned it, but didn't have the energy to do so.  I probably should have ordered a martini based drink!  Also, I ordered a shrimp/fry plate and after about 30-40 minutes, I inquired and the manager who I placed the order with, admitted that she had forgot about my order.  I went ahead and ordered a hot wing plate and when I was on my way out the door, I went to the bar to pay and was told that it was on the house, per the manager.  THANKS! This was my first time attending a KARAOKE......I must say, it was quite entertaining and there were a few brave folk (not me!) that should do a demo!  There were also a few that should of stayed in their seat, music to the ears?  NO, more like fingernails across a chalkboard!  OMG, in my Kanye West voice!  And to make matters worse, those same fingernails across a chalkboard sounding folk, kept coming to the mic on at least 3 occasions.....and my girlfriend and I kept saying, why are they back up there?  The looks on peoples faces was priceless!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oak-park?start=100
LaTasha A.,"Chicago, IL",0,7,,1.0,3/16/2015,"the worst place i have been to i think ever, will never visit again. the service was horrible, first off they are very short handed staff and the few that they do have working are doing a crappy job. let me start off by saying once we were seated we had no silverware and wasn't given any until we asked another server to find our server and ask her for them, she just gave us some herself. so we started off with drinks that was fine, then another young lady came over to take our order i'm guessing our waitress was busy with another table, as she was taking the order i order a steak and she never asked me about sides i had to ask her and she said it come how it come whatever that may mean, so i asked her so your saying i get a whole steak and no sides my mother- in- law had to say we do get sides with this. so i'm guessing she figured it out. we also had unlimited appetizers and the first order was for buffalo wings and we waited for an hour just to get it, finally they came out with it and so we placed another order for next one and again it took for ever. so to make a long story short about  food it took forever just to eat and not to mention by the time we were getting the mozzarella sticks we were putting on or coats to leave. the main thing i saw that made me say wow to this place was that one of the guys who brings food out to table looked like he was going to hit a lady who told him that if you bring me food you should know that we need saucers and silverware, i'm guessing he wasn't clear on this when they hired him, he moved a chair around like he wanted to fight. i didn't bother to ask for a manger because i knew my review would be better and i didn't think it made much sense to speak with them, because i'm sure they get this all the time. all i can say is please find another location if your thinking about tgi friday's...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oak-park?start=100

Our drinks were always filled, our meals came exactly how they were ordered, and he was very good about checking on us. He truly made our experience exceptional!  The food was GREAT and tastes better then most Friday's restaurants, but I think it's because of the service that you get that has you really looking at the food.

That said, my experience here was stellar.  The hostess was nice.  Our waiter, Ali (see? there IS a purpose to the name tags!), was the nicest waiter I've had, anywhere, in a LONG time...and not in the ""look at all my flair!"" kinda way.  He was genuine, helpful, brutally honest when asked about certain menu items, friendly but not-at-all in an over-the-top kinda way. The steak was done perfectly and, for the price, was a great cut.  Whatever ""chimichurri-type"" thing they put on it was SOOO tasty.  The potatoes like the best seasoned cottage fies you've ever had.  And tempura-fried green beans with wasabi aioli?  DUH!!!!!

Andrea M.,"Orlando, FL",81,146,24,3.0,3/8/2011,"My most recent trip here was Mon, Feb 21st. It was the evening around 6:30pm or so and it was actually packed! Luckily my friend & I only waited a couple minutes before we got seated. They apparently didn't have the loaded fries anymore...at least not on the menu. My friend got the mozzerella sticks and I ordered the Jack Daniels Chicken Strips...BAD CHOICE! It was Asian-flavored and I'm not too huge on that. I'm not completely against Asian food because sometimes I'll have it, but this was just too strong of a flavor with soy sauce. As a matter of fact, even for those who DO like Asian, I'm sure they wouldn't like this chicken. It was so gross that it actually made me sick. My friend ordered a strawberry daiquiri and I got the berry acai sour. If you like amaretto sours or anything with sweet & sour mix, you'll def love the berry acai sour. It's a yummy fruity drink and you can't even taste the alcohol. Overall, I don't think I'll be back at Friday's anytime soon...and if I am, I'm sticking to mozzerella sticks, burgers and drinks. Nothing else on their menu looks appealing and I definately DON'T recommend the Jack Chicken Strips. Oh, P.S. our waitress was this cute skinny girl...SUCH a doll!

Harlem Oak Park IL Fridays is a place to avoid if your looking for a decent meal overall We went after the show with the kids tonight. .  lets start with the bar tonight, only 2 people mixing and the place was full we were served our sodas but berry drinks and a beer were severed well after the appetizer was brought out without serving plates.  food was mediocre at best with one soup being substituted for another incorrectly  and brought to the table 3 different times (they finally got it right).  Fridays suffers from specific labor duty  management organization.  1 seats you, 1 takes drink order 1 brings drinks 1 brings appetizers 1 brings main dish 1 hovers asking ""is everything alright ? "" and finally the 1 you started with brings the check. No  personal service at all with the same attitude to food prep. Its like McDonald's after you eat the food you say to yourself Why Did I Go There...... barf  The Wife and i agreed no matter what the Kids want it's NO MORE FRIDAYS FOR US!!!!!!!!

I ordered a steak at the same time as the appetizers which came out 25 minutes after the appetizers. It took 45 minutes for me to get the steak...mm The young lady was NOT attentive at all.

Me & my husband were searching for a place to eat one night & on our way to another restaurant we decided to stop here since it was closer by & we hadn't been there in a few years. It was a total waste of time. I really don't like to be a nagging yelper but based on other reviews I am not the only one who has had some issues with this place.  As soon as we walked in the door we saw 2 girls, (who were the hostess'). One was singing while playing with the others hair at the host podium (note: the singing was not bothering me but more so that the girl was playing with the other girls hair like she was in a salon not a restaurant). When we walked in they laughed which felt a little awkward cause there was no greeting, just laughter. After standing at the door for a while (we were the only ones standing at the door btw) looking at how empty the restaurant was they finally decided to seat us which felt more like we were burdening them or interrupting their fun (ok, whatever no big deal, at least we are finally getting seated, right?).  So we sat down, started browsing menu. After 10 minutes we still hadn't been asked about drinks or told that someone will be right with us or anything. 1 waitress walked by, another, then another, and another, oh and another. There were even some huddled together chatting it up about 8-10 feet away. Not one greet or even a glance our way. After 20 minutes I had enough, we got up & left.

Kelly H.,"Irving, TX",0,9,,1.0,1/23/2016,"I went in last night to have dinner with a friend. The server took forever to get to us. I would tell you her name but she didn't mention it. We were able to order our whole meal when she came over to the table. I do not eat meat but I do eat fish so I asked if they could make my meal shrimp only and she said yes. I had to ask her twice for lemon for my water and she still never brought it to the table. Our bar drinks took forever to get. Our food came out before I even got my drink. When I got my food there was chicken in it. But the sever ran away too quickly for me to have her take it back. My friend ordered a steak and she didn't give him steak sauce. Finally she came back to the table (to deliver my bar drink) and I asked her to make a new one without chicken and she took it back. About 10 minutes later she comes back and gives me my plate and walks away. The plate she gave me looked like they just picked the chicken out of it because there was still chicken in it. I pulled what looked like a manager over and asked her to re make my food since it was incorrect a second time. The server came over 5 minutes later to deliver my food with no apology just a comment ""oh I must have took the wrong plate."" Which is gross in my opinion because why would you put a plate that was on someone's table back anywhere near new food that was just made. The food was greasy and not hot. The manager and server did not offer any form of apology. I will most likely not be coming back to this location ever again.

So I decided to give it a chance. Upon being seated we looked over the menu and our waitress proceed to inquire about our drink order. After looking over the menu, I ordered a beer that was clearly listed on the menu but it turns out, they didn't have any longer. This is no surprise since the waitress didn't know what I was talking about. Also she informed me they no longer carried it about 15 minutes after I ordered it. Honest mistake you might think? So did I. My girlfriend inquired about juice and she proceeded to list the different types of lemonade they offer. I reiterated if they had juice. The answer was no. The table ordered drinks. The drink order returned broken. 5 drinks in total were ordered and she came back with 2. This is when she informed me about the beer I order was no longer available, although it was on the menu. Then she came with 2 more drinks. She actually forgot the 5th drink altogether. She later realized it. At this point she's 2 for 2 as far as mistakes go. The table orders. She actually almost forgot to take one person's order because she wanted someone else to order ahead of her. I had to remind her that she forgot someone. She's 3 for 3. At this point, I goto the bar and order my own beer and pay for it. Now the food comes out broken, same as the drink order. The first 2 entrees come out, then another 3 entrees. One we didn't order. We sent it back. Then the final entree comes out but the person delivering the entree wasn't sure what it was. It was the correct entree but we're 4 for 4 at this point. It would be good to note that the final drink hadn't arrive yet. So this is the point where the waitress realizes she forgot the drink and it arrive shortly. Finally, everything we've ordered has arrive to the table. 5 for 5. There were no complaints about the food which was the only plus. I didn't have food though. Now the bill comes, we were charged for that entree we sent back. She removed it. 6 for 6. There was an issue with my card so I paid with cash. She miscounted my change. This made 7 mistakes that I counted. Other than the table being please with the food, everything else was horrible. This was by far my worst experience at TGIF.

Anyways, my 2nd trip went much smoother, as I sat at the bar and ordered a few drink and food specials.  The barkeep, Tom, was polite and attentive, and I experienced much less personal trepidation, although I couldn't help but notice that the clientele base was still on-par with the prior visit.  It's a TGI Friday's in downtown Oak Park, go figure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oak-park?start=40

My boyfriend and I went here because we had planned to walk around that area since it was nice out and I was craving some tgi food. I regret it. We actually bumped into our waitress when we walked in the restaurant, although we didn't know it at the time. And she already looked like she was in a bad mood. Shortly after we overheard a service ask the hostess ""how you gonna do me like that"" after receiving a new table which I assume he didn't want. That caught me off guard. Anyway, so our waitress comes to the table after about 5 minutes of being seated and with the most monotone voice says her name and if we'd like anything to drink. My boyfriend and I, however had had more than enough time to look at the menu to choose an appetizer, drinks, and our entrees. She came back with our drinks, mango peach lemonade and an expired beer. Gross. We mentioned it to her and she brought another expired beer. Okay never mind just bring a water. She brought a water and then went on to other tables. So our appetizer came out, our entrees came out, and our drinks ran out, still no waitress to be seen. We were so low on drinks my boyfriend went to the bar to get us new drinks. ONLY THEN, after seeing new drinks did the waitress come over to ask if everything was okay. Mind you, we had almost finished our meal by then. We tried to flag down a manager, but he didn't even turn to look at us. Rude. All in all I felt such bad vibes surrounding me. The hostess didn't even bother to greet us with a smile (I'm a hostess at a restaurant as well and that's kind of an important thing). All of the waiters seemed annoyed to be there.

We sat down growing increasingly irritated with each passing minute until, after 12 minutes, we finally flagged down one of the SEVEN workers behind the bar to give us menus. Instead of apologizing for the delay or greeting us for that matter, the lady walked away as if she didn't hear my request, then returned with one menu for us to share. We eventually got two menus but come on!  We waited another 7 minutes before we were forced to flag down someone else to give our order.

It wasn't until they brought us our drinks that they cleared the mess the people before us made. I'm ready to either speak to management or put on my gloves and go to the back because clearly they're short staffed, right? Wrong. The majority of the staff is standing behind us sharing story time. Maybe our real server was part of this crowd because, for the life of me, I don't know who s/he is and I'd love to say hello.  I like that the staff gets along, but at the expense of customer service and professionalism? We were less than impressed. And what good restaurant, other than a sushi spot, doesn't bring everyone's food out together?!

Walking into TGI Fridays was almost like taking a step back in time to the early 2000's. Things are pretty much just how I remembered them - no better, no worse - and that's for the worse. One would hope a place like Fridays would be a little cleaner and more efficient than it was a decade ago. Everything about TGI Fridays is a bit outdated - the food is 'meh' and the venue which was once fun and exciting - badly needs an update. All of that said, we had a very prompt and efficient waiter. My Grey Goose Cooler was definitely the winner of the evening! My entree of Cajun Shrimp and Chicken was almost laughable. Yes, it was really that bad. The shrimp were chewy like rubber (a.k.a. probably overly defrosted). Between the chewy shrimp and the excess of poorly seasoned white sauce, I could barely tell that I had any pasta. Definitely skip the Cajun Shrimp and Chicken entree! Will I be back? Nope. Will I miss another chance to go down memory lane?

Mrs. C.,"Elmwood Park, IL",1,10,,1.0,11/11/2015,"ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE EVER.  The food was good once it finally came out, so I suppose that warrants the 1 star they make you give. Other than that, I have nothing good to say about this place. (The decor was ok as well, but I will eat at an ugly hole in the wall if the food and service are good - so there's that.) We were standing around for about 3 minutes waiting to be seated on a semi-empty evening.  Once seated, the waiter comes over and was not professional at all. He did not speak as if he was at work and was borderline flirtatious with me and I was with my HUSBAND and child! We order, he disappears into the great beyond and comes back with mine and my husbands food some 25 minutes later .... but not my childs? She ordered chicken tenders and broccoli, simple enough. He says ""it will be a few more minutes for the chicken tenders."" and disappears yet again. About 5 minutes later, he is at the table behind us putting on a rap performance for the ladies that were seated there. LITERALLY - RAPPING AT THE TABLE.  After 10 minutes of waiting , my husband gets up and goes to the only person we seen available by the doorway to the kitchen - asks where our daughters food is, and after 10 MORE minutes of waiting the kid finally appears with the food and states that it is the cooks fault. At this point, our food is cold from waiting for hers to arrive as we would NOT eat while our child does not. Unacceptable.  We are the type of people who are very easy to please. We are not pretentious AT ALL and we are big tippers when people do their job and go above and beyond.

Scorellis S.,"Lake Bluff, IL",0,1,1,1.0,7/31/2014,"It's a very good warning sign that if parking in the vicinity of a restaurant is difficult to obtain, but the restaurant is empty, that it is a terrible place to eat. We should have heeded this warning.   The second warning sign was how poorly lit the restaurant was.  Even after ten minutes, you could still hardly see your hand in front of your face (ok, I exaggerate a little).   I don't think this place even deserves one star.  I should think that the threshold for one star would be that you can actually get food at the restaurant.  Unfortunately, Yelp forces me to give it one star.   Horrible service, sketchy, loud, dirty, and bad experience don't begin to describe this particular Friday's.  We came in, were seated promptly, and then waited 15 minutes. Despite parking being very difficult to get, the restaurant was not at all crowded at 7:30 PM on a Tuesday night, was extremely loud, and did I say the lighting was terrible?  The chairs were uncomfortable, and the table had that problem with it where it wobbles because the floor is uneven (or perhaps the legs are).  When absolutely nobody came by, we left and went somewhere else.  Is there a manager at this restaurant?  Does he notice when customers come in, and then leave without eating?

Unfortunately every year the service gets worse and worse. Very few people there have proper etiquette for service. This last time I went I think I reached my limit and will have to find another location. When I arrived I walked up to the hostess to give her my name. I did not have reservations and expected to wait since its usually pretty crowded on the weekend. She did not address me, I didn't even think she heard me ask for a table for two because she wouldn't even turn to look at me. I asked her if she would write my name down and then she took her thumb out of her mouth... yes you read correctly, she took her thumb out of her mouth, took a pen and wrote my name.  I asked how long the wait would be and she said about 5-10 min.  After 20 minutes and seeing other people that were walking in way after me and getting a  table I asked her when my name would come up. She said someone had already called it. I was sitting in front of her and never heard my name called or anything even close to my name. I know because I was paying close attention to every single name they called. The hostess was there with two other people talking the whole time. After they finally call my name, she takes two menus doesn't say anything and starts walking away. We followed her, the threw the menus on the table and walked away. The waitress was friendlier but not by much. The food took forever and after all that experience, we hardly enjoyed our meal.

Bridgette K.,"Chicago, IL",89,332,32,2.0,2/8/2010,"They get two stars for their HAPPY HOUR you know their $4.00 drink specials by the bar area cause I can get a killer LONG ISLAND on THURSDAY. My friend and I came this past Thursday for our weekly long island fix. We grab a spot in the bar area since the ignant ass hostess tells me there is a 30min wait  for a booth when there was no wait that was really petty. And the waiter who is off the clock called me a bitch for no apparent reason talking to our server about us right in front of us really threw me off the bar seat. I called a manager to ask what was wrong with his employees cause they were all slacking on their job, by talking to his clients like that and for the hostess on being lazy. He confronts his employee on why he was talking about us so foul in front of us or even talking about us period. Of course they denied it like any other human being. So we left and I will not be returning to this TGIF again. I well head further down to suburbia to get my fix on Thursdays. This location is a very classless bunch who work there. The manager handled the situation wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oak-park?start=120
Rick V.,"Los Angeles, CA",479,220,141,1.0,2/3/2006,"Really good Chinese potstickers and probably the tallest Bass Ale I've ever seen in my life. Unfortunately, the service sucked. We waited forever to be seated, then the server (who may have also been the bartender, I'm not sure) wandered over with his hands in his pockets and asked if we knew what we wanted - very brusquely, I thought. And we hadn't even begun to look at the menu and he seemed very impatient, even though the place was practically empty. My date ordered the Jack Daniels Chicken & Shrimp with Mashed Potatoes but I guess they forgot the shrimp and had to take it back and fix it... but first they had to tell her that the shrimp wasn't included, contrary to what the menu originally told us. She also asked for blue cheese dip which took nearly 20 minutes for them to bring it. The staff all seemed like it was their first day on the job, and like they had no customer service skills whatsoever - in fact, at one point I saw the manager actually taking orders since it seemed the staff couldn't be bothered - they were sitting off in the corner laughing and joking with each other. Quite unprofessional, and I don't think we'll be coming back any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oak-park?start=120
Diana S.,"Chicago, IL",3,15,2,2.0,1/22/2017,"This is my local hangout spot,  but this time i was very disappointed.  The ladies working the bar, young might I add, weren't on their A game. Too many employees that were off the clock hanging out in the bar area distracted them from doing their jobs efficiently.  Customers had to ask for service rather than them doing their job to assist them. I was there 2 hours and in that time they had 5, I REPEAT 5 orders returned due to inaccuracies.  WOW! Talk about loss of revenue.  I think the manager should do a better job of ensuring employees off the clock leave unless they are a paying customer. I look forward to returning when their regular bartenders Erica (sp) returns to work. I'd rather waste my money else where.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oak-park?start=20
Denise E.,"Cicero, IL",65,57,61,1.0,12/16/2016,I was hoping the reviews were not true. Went for the first time with two friends and my niece. we waited for 15 minutes and. I one asked if we were ready or if we would like something to drink and we ended up just getting up and leaving. It was Friday but thankfully it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be! Four waiters past and we weren't asked anything. Please listen to these reviews and do not come here!!parking lot is also an issue. The hostess and waiters were talking amongst themselves and I have never been to a tgi's so I am not sure of this is what is supposed to happen but when being seated we were told that our waiter was going to be in the front if we had any questions. I don't think it's a good idea you have to get up and ask for stuff. Ended up eating at chills and the service was great!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oak-park?start=20
Precious H.,"Streeterville, Chicago, IL",63,2,,1.0,8/31/2017,"Horrible customer  service from beginning to end !. Walked in the restaurant at 11:30 am . They open at 11:00 am so you wouuld think everyone wouild be in good spirits  with high energy  right?. No!.  Greeter doesnt even look up from the tablet to make I contact but say  "" how many. We are then seated and there was 2 other tables there but somehow took 15 mins before a server even came to introduce themselves.  Time passes we get our food the server is no longer available  why, because she sits in the booth behind us and eats and chats with the other employees .  We finish eating get our bill and I notice that the suggested tip amounts on the bottom of the bill are higher than they should be it stated that 15% of $40 was $7.56 and that 18% was $9 and some change ,which was completely  wrong . I have no problem with  leaving a decent tip however I take it as a.

We actually stopped coming to this location and any other location for that matter after our last couple of visits here.  The restaurant is not always clean. The service is not consistently adequate, and the food is usually not good. The bathrooms are definitely not clean either. There is limited free parking in the lot if you can find some.

Yvette M.,"Forest Park, IL",0,52,,1.0,6/3/2017,In my honest opinion they need to close this location down ASAP. Went when they first opened hostess was busy talking on her cell phone. Inquired whether I should seat myself she finally acknowledged me and sat me at a booth. Sat there staring at menu 15 minutes gone by not an ounce of water and no waitress. Finally stopped a guy who was mopping asked if he could my server or manager. Finally the server appeared Zoila (not sure if I spelled her name correctly) smiling gave me water. Placed my order and found a gnat floating in my water asked for another glass of water. Moving right along food came out with gnats flying around it which one landed on my Buffalo wings. Instantly turned off with these flying gnats and slow server who didn't seem to give a crap about bugs being in my food and water. Got up angry walked out left food I ordered on the table hope the gnats left Zoila a good tip. Ugh will never come back ever again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oak-park?start=20
Iamiesha I.,"Chicago, IL",0,5,5,1.0,5/29/2017,This place needs to be closed and shut down for business. Where is the professionalism at this location. Myself and son decided to come to Fridays for lunch and it was a mistake. They had more customers outside waiting and only half of the store was occupied. My son got us a seat admittedly.... we sat and sat and sat. No server even greeted us and as I look around it's nothing out servers standing around talking to each other. What in the world is going on at this place. Why are the servers talking and laughing why guest wait to be served. I will personally be submitting a complaint to corporate about this location. After just sitting there looking stupid and watching the staff do nothing we decided to leave and go to Chili's.... This Friday's Resturant needs to do better or close for LIFE,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oak-park?start=20
Destynee W.,"Summit, IL",7,46,83,2.0,6/18/2017,"To start we came to this restaurant on Father's Day. However, it was later in the day. Nonetheless, there were about five hostess at the door. There wasn't a list so we didn't actually know how long the wait was. But we knew that someone stole one of the hostess's phone, that another's one blood pressure was high all of a sudden, and that another one was tired of cleaning up behind grown ass people! We didn't know when we were going to get seated because remember there wasn't a list. Then the hostess debated on who came in first and whether a party of two with a baby or two other random parties that came in should be seated first. All while a nearby booth that was dining had spilled a drink rather then cleaning and mopping the floor they just stuck a caution wet floor sign up! So walking in should of made us walk out! But we waited it out hoping our food wouldn't disappoint us. Well that was an understatement as we watched everyone who was seated after us get their food. My husband attentively watches the kitchen waiting as every dish comes out but it wasn't ours. Come to find out our food was given to another table. At last our food has come along....he had Jack Daniel's Ribs and I had the crispy shrimp. To our utter amazement everything was piping hot and good! Although the food was good the customer service and overall cleanliness of the restaurant was truly lacking. My husband was left unhappy with the entire experience! I owe him a redo somewhere of his choosing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oak-park?start=20
Alex O.,"Melrose Park, IL",0,1,,1.0,4/4/2017,"Worst service ever. Was greeted 15 min in after seating to "" yah ready to order"" girl we been ready. But first can u start us off with our drinks please took our order without writing it down and was hoping she got our order correct. Of course she did not my steak was dry as fuck. Asked for medium but was crisp and slightly burnt dry to the t. Took bout 10 min for our server to get back to us before I could tell her my food was not cooked to order by then my husband was finished eating. Servers here are just unprofessional no customer service need to be retrained our server walked off with her ass crack hanging out her back and belly showing. No lie this experience reminded me of mad tv's Burger King episode of bon qui qui.

Celly V.,"Berwyn, IL",0,11,9,1.0,3/25/2017,"Decided to give this location a try since the last time my fiancé and I went, it wasn't so bad. We walked in to a crowd, it's Friday! So you guessed it, it was busy. We only waited 15-20 minutes before being sitting, we sat down, and were greeted within 5 minutes, we knew what we wanted to order already, I ordered the unlimited apps, my fiancé ordered a Caesar salad with grilled chicken. Once we placed our drink orders, it took our server (her name was Jasmine) 10 minutes to bring us our drinks!? 10! Already a bad taste in my mouth, I was so excited to try all the apps but I knew this was going to be a frustrating dinner. 10 minutes after our drinks we received our order. Wings were delicious and my fiancé liked the salad. Now we finished our first round and wanted to place another order. 15 min later Jasmin comes by the table and checks for refills, and asks us if everything is ok, asks us if we want our second order placed we say yes and she walks away. The Refill for the food came quicker then the drink. We finished our second round and wanted to do pot stickers next. 20 minutes! No sign of Jasmine, 30 minutes. No sign. We were so irritated, we asked for our check which took her ANOTHER 20 minutes and left unsatisfied. I was still hungry when I left! I will never visit this location again, every other patron was getting refills after refills on there food! I'm pretty upset that I had to leave a restaurant still hungry? When does that happen? Oh well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oak-park?start=20
Connie H.,"Forest Park, IL",0,2,,1.0,8/7/2017,I will never again in life return to this ghetto  restaurant. I waited for a waitress for 20 minutes. Then waited 25 more for my food. Then my order was incorrect. My blood sugar was dropping. The waitress said it would take another 25 minutes to correct my order. I got up and told her never mind. I asked for the Manager. It was taking a while so I left. As I was walking to my car. A cop stopped me and said to come back into the restaurant. He said I tried to run out without paying. WTH! I have never done that in my life. I explained to him that I never got what I actually ordered. He said the Waitress told him that I walked out without paying. By then the Manager approached me. I explained what happened. She apologized for the misunderstanding. I was humiliated and felt like I wanted to pass out. I had not gotten to eat anything. The Manager kept asking if I wanted some food to go. These stupid ghetto young people that they keep hiring are ridiculous. I will definitely be referring this to Corporate.

The staff was very nice and we were seated quickly. The decor is very trendy, but hey, it's a chain joint. Our server Alex was very prompt and polite. He offered the wings as an appetizer and he was right on point. They were very good. He was also checking in on us to see if we needed anything on a regular basis. That was a plus.  Our salads were good. Pretty dam big if you ask me , but still good. The pecan chicken was good, except the chicken  was a bit over seasoned for my taste.

There were about 5 servers or whatever they were just sitting at the door not really doing anything. Talking loud and on their phones. Service was very slow, the waiter was not very attentive, food was not good at all, drinks were mediocre but that was to be expected. The wait time to receive the check was entirely too long.

Ashley A.,"Chicago, IL",0,6,,1.0,12/6/2015,"I can describe this place in a few words; Ghetto, unprofessional, slow, dirty, low standards and inattentive.   The level of customer service needs serious improvement. The waitress was inattentive, often bringing the wrong items. I ordered my son a white milk and received a chocolate milk. I also ordered him a fruit cup as a side but received fries instead. When I told the waitress about the mixup she brought the fruit cup but did not once apologize. Additionally when she brought his Mac and cheese he had to wait to eat it because there was no silver where at our table. Lastly our son wanted dessert with his dinner and while we still had food at the table we were delivered our check. The waitress informed us that she wasn't rushing us to pay and that she was heading to the ladies room so she didn't want us to wait for the check.  I also observed two other upset tables where they received incorrect food and drink items. I even noticed a woman ask for her kids juice 3 times before she had to ask for the manager who eventually brought it to her.

Waitress: Oh it's just a rubber band and she pause like its no big deal than she said do you want me to take it back or. Than we just look and said please! Although, I do feel sorry for her 'cause it seems that they weren't train properly to act on any situation plus how to be more aware with their service tables.

The sad part is that i have been here more then once just to give them a 2nd chance but NOPE. The entire is just horrible from the time they sit you to the time they actually come to your table just to give you a menu. Not only does it take forever for them to take ur drink or but actually getting your drinks is bad. Once you order your food they dont even bother to come to your table to see if you need anything else and if you do need anything you better expect an attitude. Everytime i come here it seems like if you are friends or family you will get the best service and extra food/ treatment here. Also expect to see all the staff just hanging around talking to each other about their social/ love life and using vulgar language so dont take you kids. Management is no better cuz they are obviously friends with the staff so your complaints will go no where.
