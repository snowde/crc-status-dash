Wing ..,"Adelaide, Australia",7,25,52,4.0,8/8/2016,"What we ordered:  Jack Daniel's platter (forgot the exact name) consisting of beef ribs, steak and shrimp with sidings of vegetables, onion rings and chips. For the drinks, hubby ordered a milkshake and I went for orange juice. The verdict:  The first thing that stand out for me is the chips. It's salty but not the usual boring bland or too salty taste in other fastfood. The difference is a big plus for me I like everything in that platter and my hubby enjoyed it as well. But because it's a platter and we shared it, we find the steaks and beef ribs lacking in portion. Maybe we should order a separate meal for that. The only difference I noticed from my previous experience in Friday's is the sauce. The Jack Daniel's sauce here is more barbecuish. The one I've tasted in the past has a balance of barbecue sauce and whiskey. Like the first time I've tried it I can tell that it has a bit of a whiskey but it blended so well with the sauce. That's the only disappointing thing for me coz I loved its unique taste. Customer service: The staffs are helpful, especially the one who assisted us (I think India was her name) coz she seems to be a natural people person.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
Noel G.,"Adelaide, Australia",10,37,9,4.0,8/20/2016,"Remains a family favourite, previous comments apply. Nice to be recognised as a regular by our waitress. The usual fun and bustle is here, great food, prices and atmosphere. Yet again great service, good suggestions for meal enhancement. In the USA I'd be leaving a great tip",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
Adam L.,"Adelaide, Australia",24,40,45,5.0,12/12/2015,"Do you feel like over indulging? I mean really over doing it. If you have a hunger for a burger the size of your head, then drop in here. Check out the ultimate jack Daniels burger and fries. Or if you're not as adventurous check out the normal jack Daniels burger with a beef patty and Jack Daniels sauce (the ultimate burger adds an additional beef patty and onion rings).  But fair warning. Once you consume this meal you'll wonder why you ate so much. I suggest checking out a movie at event cinemas after. Just so you can sit and let the experience settle in.  But watch out for that omgis (oh my god it's Saturday) hangover. When you roll out of bed and wonder what on earth you were thinking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
Sothea N.,"Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia",173,61,322,3.0,6/9/2016,"It's a great place to catch up with my co-worker who also has a little infant and not to loud/crowded compare to the food court inside the mall. We both came in with a pram, they are spaces and able to accommodate us with our strollers.  The service was good but the food was ok. They have lunch special starting from about $10 to $17 including a glass of pop and fried. I ordered a reg. Burger that come with fried and coke - there was no sauce on the burger and looked dry. They have whole lots of other dishes on the menu that I haven't try yet.  Note: there is a nice nursery room that separated from the regular toilet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
Tiffany C.,"Adelaide, Australia",40,68,114,2.0,2/20/2016,"Overpriced. Before the menu change I would have happily given this place 3-4 stars as my first experience here was great. This time, not so much. I can't even say anything good about the food here. It was a mix of over cooked and undercooked, overpriced and disappointing. Chips served cold, and soggy - the seasoning of salt and pepper was a nice touch, but someone went crazy with the salt shaker. pasta so soggy and wet it was like swallowing glue, the portion sizes are usually pretty large but still isn't worth the hefty price tag that comes with the menu. Service is amazing. Everything else? Not so much. This place has many a great review so perhaps this was the unlucky bad meal out of the many good meals. Unfortunately this has happened to me numerous times since I have come here so it has dragged my score from 3 down to 2. This is a nice place, fantastic service and many other people love the food - my personal experience however was not the best and has been consistently disappointing. So I probably won't go out my way to come here. Leaving on a good note: TGIs has unique and interesting food options and lovely service so don't pass it up, give it a go!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
Stephen D.,"Adelaide, Australia",32,33,16,4.0,6/13/2015,Noisy but still a great atmosphere. The food is the american genre of big flavours. The food is we presented and a decont size. There is something for everybody in this menu. I had the Jack Daniel's ribs and they were cooked to perfection. My wife had the JD Salmon and she thought it was brilliant. The desserts are great even though there is a limited selection. Would I go again-yes. I enjoyed the Marion one as much as the couple I visited in Melbourne. Good food with good service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
Laurice D.,"Morphett Vale, Australia",20,25,34,4.0,6/11/2014,TGI Friday's is always such a great atmosphere with the smiling workers welcoming everyone on there arrival and walking them to their seats. I always think it's the little things that makes customer service great and bring customers back!  1. Food is delivered at perfect temperature 2. Very generous with portion size  3. Customer service is great!  4. Free soft drink refill 5. Great lunch specials  Will be returning TGI Friday's!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
Emily B.,"Adelaide, Australia",7,13,5,3.0,1/1/2016,"Went here on a Thursday at around 11.45am for a fun drink with my mother after a really awful Wednesday. Our waitress was pleasant, gave us the menus and left us alone for a decent amount of time (not half an hour like some places, but she also wasn't in our face every 2 minutes trying to rush us). Our two smoothies arrived in decent time. They were tasty, and the waitress came back to check in with us, which was also timed well. Her service was top notch. We wanted to get back to shopping, so went over to pay the bill. No one was near the payment area, so we waited near the seating/booking booth thing. When we were finally served, the girl serving was quite rude about us not being at the payment area. And when we got there, she didn't bother with pleasantries, and basically said ""that'll be $69 thanks"". Which, given we ordered 2 smoothies, obviously was incorrect. After my mum pointed this out in a joking way, she didn't crack a smile or ever apologise. I don't know why if you aren't 100% of someone's bill you wouldn't ask where they sat or something - she wasn't our waitress so we didn't expect her to know - just not to try and give us someone else's bill.  The food and most of the service was good, but this one girl just left a sour taste in our mouths, given this is meant to be a fun, themed eatery. If you can't smile at a joke or make customers feel comfortable, you really shouldn't work in customer service roles.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
Stefanie G.,"Parafield, Australia",3,4,2,5.0,2/23/2014,"My Dad and I went to TGI Fridays, for lunch.  TGI Fridays has a great welcoming atmosphere, we both ordered, the ultimate jack Daniels burger, which was amazing, I told my family and friends it was sent from the gods, it was that good :D  The service, wasn't that good at all. Our waitress wasn't, great at all. We were seated and she left and that was the last time we say if her. We then had to ask a bartender to help us with ordering and then the chef gave us our food.  The pricing is high, but the food was worth it, I could only eat half my burger, which was served with French fries, onion rings and an amazing jack Daniels sauce which I drank, it was that good. They even offer, take away for the food you're not able to eat while dinning. Which was amazing for me because I wasn't going to leave a $23.95 burger at the restaurant, I was glad you had that option.  Food amazing,  Service poor  Would tell all my friends and family about this great burger spot !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
Hannah M.,"Adelaide, Australia",12,24,11,2.0,4/20/2013,The best thing about my visit to TGI Fridays was the friend that I went with.  When we got there we were told there was going to be a 20-25 min wait which was ok i could see they were really busy but it ended up being 45mins. The food was ok ended up being a pretty big portion the burger and chips was served on a big bit of paper which ended up getting mushed into the food. I also got a massive piece of plastic in my guacamole and would have let the staff know but they didn't come round to check how we were doing. Was pretty expensive for what you got burgers were around $20 and steaks were $33-$37. They did have some fun looking cocktails which might be good to try if I did end up going back. There were a couple of birthdays going and the staff made a big fuss about them and got the restaurant to join in and clap which was fun.  So would recommend for a kids birthday but other than that there wouldn't be any other reason to go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
Karlie N.,"North Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia",5,7,16,5.0,5/30/2015,FANTASTIC what more could you want Friendly staff 10/10 service quick service and very attentive!! The food was DELICIOUS I had the Canadian chicken burger my partner had the fajita tower and wow! Huge meals !! The price is very fair for such big portions !!the atmosphere is busy but exciting we had a quiet corner by the window was lovely We will be coming back that's for sure !!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
Karen F.,"Adelaide, Australia",19,159,42,2.0,4/20/2013,"I discovered TGI Fridays in Melbourne. I wanted to see how this one and only in Adelaide would compare.  For some reason the one I used to go to on Chapel St seemed more comforting and appealing with it's ""hog's breath café"" décor. This one still has the booth seats but it's open plan made it noisier. The food is still expensive, not great quality, and the friend I went with found plastic in her guacamole. Not good. Having said that, the food portion sizes are big. That's one plus.  I do like the birthday songs they sing with the bell ringing at the end. Don't tell them if you don't want to be embarrassed. It's pretty loud. The staff seemed friendly, once seated service is pretty quick, but they need to pay attention to what goes into their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
John W.,"Melbourne, Australia",72,200,63,5.0,8/5/2013,"Wow!  The cocktails here are really good! For a franchise located in a shopping mall I would normally not expect too much but this place had a few regulars at the bar and had a real friendly vibe about it. Be warned..  This place packs out real early, so if you want to have a meal it is wise to book well in advance. I thought the food was pretty good.  Try the ribs if you are game.  They are bourbon infused deliciousness!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
Sarah B.,"Adelaide, Australia",41,80,100,4.0,12/23/2013,"TGI Fridays is an American themed diner in the busy Marion Shopping Centre complex. It's fairly authentic but what I appreciate the most is that it is not anywhere near as fatty or greasy as it's US based counterparts! I have tried several of the burgers and enjoyed them all, however, have not found the fries to be particularly great. They aren't soggy or over cooked but just lack flavour. I'm not someone who likes to slather my fries in sauces! The food isn't cheap but on my last visit my buddy and I worked out a good strategy - we each got the $34.95 deal - I got the appetiser and burger, she got the burger and dessert. As the serves are large we happily shared the appetiser and dessert - and were so full we couldn't finish dessert! My favourite thing about this place is definitely the drinks - huge cocktail and mocktail list - prices are fair. They also offer limitless soft drink refills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
Brad K.,"Adelaide, Australia",15,119,99,2.0,1/2/2014,"This places is overpriced and over rated for what you get, the service and decor is great but I honestly don't know how they charge so much for basic American style diner meals.  Service was great, a little too quick to take orders but can't really complain about that, drink prices were also way  Both my partner and I agreed that we have tried it but we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
Benji W.,"Adelaide, Australia",25,140,161,2.0,11/23/2013,"Overpriced and over rated and won't be back again after the last experience. We went there for lunch and there was just ONE other woman in the whole place and we were seated right next to her (on a booth seat so it was literally right next to her) I went up and asked if we could be moved to another table just away from her slightly and they said ""oh nah we only have the one waitress on so we'd like to have everyone together"" so we reluctantly ordered anyway as old mate single lady was listening into our every word over lunch. Terrible food also.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
Jess S.,"Adelaide, Australia",2,27,1,3.0,1/11/2015,"The first few times I came here I thought it was great, a little overpriced but great service etc We came here again for the first time in at least a year last week. The menu has changed a little and I was so looking forward to the veggie burger, it's what I'd had every other time I'd been there, was great! But they have changed it :( it was nice but nothing special like I thought of their old one. My bf always has the same thing, jack Daniels chicken, he said it was nice but the chicken was over cooked and chewy. The previous time his mash potato was stone cold in the middle like it had just been chucked in the microwave to warm it up. Would I go here again? Yes because it's a fun place and I haven't had a problem but because of how much it all costs, it's only a place I'd go on the odd occasion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
Natasha S.,"Adelaide, Australia",96,173,543,2.0,6/14/2012,"I guess I shouldn't have gone into TGI Friday's expecting too much, but there was a bit of hype, and I was hoping for some really good American comfort food.  The first disappointment was definitely the price. We brought my sisters kids along (kids get a free meal with the purchase of a regular main on some days), so we thought maybe it would be a cheap spot for lunch and something a bit better than nearby take out.  I'm used to dining at some pretty nice restaurants around Adelaide, so to head somewhere like TGI Friday's and find that most mains are nearing $30 or upwards I wasn't too impressed.  Our food was pretty average, nothing special about it, and the service was shocking. After waiting for ever to place our order, we enquired with the waitress, and she'd forgotten to put our order through. Then once our orders were placed the second time it took quite a while for the food to come. Thankfully everyone was friendly, we couldn't fault them there.  There are some good things at TGI Friday's. Their cocktails are pretty nice, and they have good Happy Hour specials. They also have a better kids menu than most places, there are some interesting choices like wrap your own fajitas that can keep slightly older children happy.  It's not like they've got too much to compete with, as none of the restaurants at Westfield Marion are mind-blowing, but it would be nice to see prices come down and service come up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oaklands-park
