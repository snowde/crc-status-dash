A S.,"Fort Worth, TX",2,18,,1.0,8/3/2014,"Pretty awkward from the moment we stepped in the door.  As we were shown to our table, one waitress confronted another on how we could not sit at the designated table as it was being saved.  Do we sit, do we not sit?  I also found it strange that while the restaurant had a large line, the managers friends could get right in....not s good sign.  An usual substitution in Texas seemed to yield additional charges in a Oklahoma....hmm weird.   Food was served cold and we shouldn't have to ask that the food be microwaved.  Waitress was nice but she seemed Too much in a hurry to rush us out the door.   Overall it was the least impressed I have ever been sitting in a IHOP.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oklahoma-city?start=20
Melinda D.,"Edmond, OK",20,7,,5.0,1/1/2016,"My husband and I prefer to eat at home but dislike fast food.. New Year's Eve we ordered from TGIF (Memorial Rd.) for the 1st time. Deandre took our order on the phone & it was exactly as we ordered. So glad we did! The jalapeño poppers are awesome. I ordered the flat iron , it was a little too rare for my taste but it was good. The mashed potatoes were delicious & the spinach was really good. Today we ordered again for dinner - the baby back ribs were delicious & hubby loved the cheddar Mac n cheese. The jalapeño poppers are a must!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oklahoma-city?start=20

Grant R.,"Oklahoma City, OK",3,1,1,1.0,3/6/2015,I don't know how to give zero stars... But I would if I could.  This place fucking sucks. My friend had to send back his food bc the waiter (frank) doesn't know the menu. Got his 2nd meal 20 minutes before the rest of the table.

Will E.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",7,11,,1.0,5/31/2014,"This is the last place in OKC I'd go to eat. You'd be wise to read on. I've been to this Friday's twice. On the first visit, we waited well over 15 minutes to be asked for our drink order. We waited over an hour for food that was cold and tasteless. On the second visit, we left after the 15 minutes spent waiting for a drink order.  Don't waste your time.

The place was packed and had a 20-30 minute wait. The Celtics vs Bulls game was on so we walked to the bar to see if there were any open seats. A server walked past us and said that there should be seats available in about 3 minutes. Sweet! I told the hostess at the door that we'll be staying at the bar. Our server was on point, super friendly and accommodating. Our drinks were never left empty and our food came out pretty fast. We ordered the Loaded Nachos, Flat Iron Steak and Yucatan Chicken salad all to share. Everything was good- typical Friday's flair. I must admit that the steak was perfected cooked to a bloody MR and the salad dressing was yummy. Skimped on the tomatoes, but that was about all I could find wrong! Oh and btw- the hostess at the door is adorably cute! She remembered my name when we left! :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oklahoma-city?start=20
Jennifer B.,"Federal Way, WA",85,166,7,1.0,10/31/2012,"My husband and I ate there and if you like liking a salt lick, then this is the place for you.  My plate was cooked twice and both times everything tasted like a salt lick.  My lips were turning red like they were being burned by the salt on the food,. If you like salt, TGIF is your place.  But if you like lightly seasoned food that is tasty and enjoyable, then this place is not for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oklahoma-city?start=20
Crystal M.,"Port Huron, MI",17,12,,1.0,5/31/2014,"A few months ago my date and I waited 20 minutes for a glass of water and another HOUR for the food. We thought it just might have been a busy friday night, and were annoyed, but we shrugged it off as a busy night until we got our food. It was cold. It had to have been waiting the entire hour in the pass. We waited a few months and tonight decided to try again. Went in and we were seated immediately. Lots of empty tables and waitstaff walking everwhere. We sat...and sat....and sat. At least ten waiters walked by and none would even make eye contact. 15 minutes later and not even a nod in our direction, we realized that it was shaping to be a repeat performance and we were hungry. We left to a chorus of have a great evenings and a bored insincere did you want the manager? from the hostess. No, thanks, we will eat somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oklahoma-city?start=20
Malori W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,6,7,1.0,6/30/2014,The last time I went there was a little over 6 months ago. It was a horrible experience. My friend and I were quickly greeted when we walked in but it seemed like the hostess was confused at what she was supposed to be doing. We were led to an area where a few people were dining but most of the tables around them were all dirty. So we asked to be seated at the bar area. Once seated it took at least 15 minutes for a waiter to come by and ask us what we wanted to drink. In the meantime we saw what we think was the manager walking in and out of the back. It was obvious that there was a tremendous lack of supervision. Far too many staff personnel walking around or chatting and far too many dirty tables. My friend ask to speak to the manager and we waited another 10 to 15 minutes without ever seeing a manager and ended up just leaving and going to Chili's. It was a complete disappointment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oklahoma-city?start=20

Cynthia S.,"Gardner, KS",22,10,,1.0,6/16/2015,"We LOVE TGI Fridays but it appears the brand has gone down hill.  Sat in the bar area and finally after being there 10 minutes asked the bartender who walked by us at least 10 times if we needed to go to the bar to order drinks and he was like - oh sorry, thought you had been helped already.  Really, by whom?  Drinks were wrong the 1st time out but were corrected with the second round.  We always order the Seasame Jack Strips and you end up paying about $1 per small piece of chicken.  We won't be back.  Yes, I sent an email to the company on their site about the 2 locations in OKC and have not heard back so it seems they don't care either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oklahoma-city?start=20

Had a really good time on a late Thursday night at the bar top with three friends. Our bar tender was super lively and fun. She kept it real with us on best deals, food, and cocktails. I ordered an LIT and premo marg on the rocks, for approx $6 ea. I was able to order one plate of each option on the $10 unlimited appetizer-- so 7 appetizers for 10 bucks!!

Mohamed H.,"Edmond, OK",0,35,100,5.0,12/25/2016,"TGI deserves a 5 star just for being open today (Christmas day). But seriously, I'm giving them 5 stars because food was consistent as usual and taste the exact same as any other TGI branch. Not saying food was delicious, it's just consistent. Place was obviously busy (since it's the only open restaurant today), so I would say service was OK for such a busy place.  TGI earned the 5 stars just for what I mentioned above, I'm not sure why their ratings is averaging 2.5 stars on YELP, but seems like yelpers have some kind of grudge against franchises.

Damaris L.,"Central Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City, OK",0,1,,1.0,11/14/2017,I've worked in the restaurant business long enough to know what bad customer service is... Stood at the front waiting to be seated for about 15 or 20 minutes. Server walked in on her phone and looked us and processed to walk over and text at the bar. Server walked by and avoided eye contact. Hostess walked up to the host stand opened a drawer and left and also did not acknowledging us. Eventually decided to walk up to the bar and ask about seating only to be told it was open seating. Would have appreciated a sign telling us about open seating since usually it's not or someone acknowledging that we were just standing there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oklahoma-city
Real P.,"Choctaw, OK",91,4,,1.0,7/28/2017,"All and all TGIFridays has gone down hill, the memorial location blows. First I eat the endless apps and get sick before I even leave the restaurant. But then I also had my identity stolen and credit card fraud as well. I went home and found an additional 70 dollar charge and a charge on Amazon as well. Someone stole my identity. Management doesn't seem to care to fix this issue and as far as they're concerned my bank denied those transactions so the issue is solved??? No repercussions??? What a joke please don't eat here go somewhere else down the road I promise it will be worth it. Rather then eating here with horrible staff and management and food that makes you sick.

Paul H.,"Newalla, OK",0,8,,2.0,3/23/2017,"I'll keep this simple: the food was very good, the service was poor.  We've eaten here less than half a dozen times in the last year, and every time it's the same thing: poor service and good food. We waited 10 minutes to get our drink order, and that's because the hostess noticed me looking around for someone. Once we had a server he was polite but he didn't come by often. Then the table next to us had their dinners first although they arrived 15 minutes after us. When I flagged down one of the people who just delivered that table's food I had to complain to them. They went and immediately brought our food. It was obviously done but no one paid attention.  So they get two stars only because the food was good. I like the Cajun chicken pasta and the pot stickers. My wife's salad was good too. But it was work getting the food. No, I do not have anything against franchises - just poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oklahoma-city
Nancy H.,"Edmond, OK",29,22,29,4.0,3/10/2016,"The only reason why I gave this place only 4 stars is because of the service. We came here during lunch time, and it wasn't as busy as we thought it would be. We probably only saw our waitress once the whole time we were eating there. When we were done eating, our waitress was no where to be found. We had to grab a different waitress to call our waitress to get our ticket..  Other than that, the food was pretty great! The atmosphere was very nice, clean, and quiet. Decent food, might come back just for the Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta though!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oklahoma-city
Eddie H.,"Tulsa, OK",23,101,313,3.0,6/1/2015,A later afternoon stop for lunch found me at TGI Fridays.  I ordered loaded potato skins and the classic cheeseburger with fries. First the potato skins. A crispy salty exterior with a soft salted potato center. Topped with a pyro clastic cheddar cover studded with clumps of porcine remnants. The addition of the supplied sour cream cut the saltiness to a tolerable level and gave the appetizer a more appetizing texture. A fair but salty begging to a meal. Next the fries.  The standard small evenly cut strips of potato deep fried to a golden brown. Nothing remarkable but properly done. Next the burger. At first glance I was afraid the meat would be sub par.  The bun seemed to outsize the patty. The bun was soft and quite flavorful a small breasts pillow for a patty of meat that far exceeded my first impression. A slice of the knife revealed the tell tell color of beef properly grilled  to the softest pink of ground bovine perfection.  The patty featured the thinnest layer of crust of well seared burger. The cheesy cover was mild for a fromage boasting the name of sharp... A small disappointment on an otherwise proud burger offering. As national chains go not a shabby burger and worth the ordering.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oklahoma-city
J J.,"Stillwater, OK",0,29,1,1.0,5/6/2017,First visit here since 2014 and service was poor then. This time around found plastic wrap in one of our salads. They acted like it was no big deal.

A few moments went by and another couple entered. The hostess ignored me and immediately offered to seat the newly arriving customers. Ok, this happens sometimes. When she returned she offered to seat me.  Once I as seated I waited 20 minutes for someone, anyone to acknowledge my presence. I would have loved to be offered a drink maybe some water. But after 20 minutes of waiting in a restaurant that was no busy I decided to leave. I gathered my menu and went to the front and returned the menu to the hostess. I explained that I tend not to eat in a restaurant where I am invisible. She thanked me for smiling and speaking calmly and not yelling at her.  Who knows, maybe I will try again later after shift change. I really like their food. Especially their desert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-oklahoma-city
Terry J.,"Warr Acres, OK",35,66,14,2.0,10/25/2015,Pros; the restaurant is accommodating to large parties. Cons: the restaurant assigned one waitress to a 40 top! She could barely keep up with drink refills napkin requests and when it came time deliver the food orders were missed. 4 to 5 waiters were just standing around in the front section and it should've been assigned to our 40 top to be able to process all the orders.
