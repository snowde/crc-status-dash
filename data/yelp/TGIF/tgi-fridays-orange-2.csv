Lily B.,"Stratford, CT",8,5,,1.0,10/25/2016,"I've been coming here with a friend for about 8 months or something primarily for the bar, and every single time I've gone this particular bartender has been so cynical and rude to me I've decided that I will not be returning. Today was my birthday, and I was just trying to have a good time, and everything i asked him was returned with some snide, sarcastic remark. I asked to see the drink menu and he said ""we ran out of those."" and he proceeded to ignore me for about 10-15 minutes. He was goofing around at one point and was throwing balled up pieces of napkin at customers and managed to throw one of them into my drink. The only time i remember enjoying my time there tonight was when the manager brought us our appetizer, he was polite. Don't get me wrong, I'm a bartender also, and i understand that being a fun person is a part of the job, but this guy is always nothing more than a rude a**hole, and I'm tired of going in and being afraid of being made fun of which he managed to do tonight. So this bartender totally sucks and I'm not going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20
Rochelle C.,"Stamford, CT",36,303,1211,3.0,12/18/2011,"Had lunch here this past weekend because I miss their frozen drinks. Yeah, they're pretty good. Bf got the steak & shrimp combo which he loves and I got my jack daniels burger. It doesnt really matter what I get as long as it comes wih fries because the only thing I really want is the jack daniels mayo. Its sooo good and soo addicting!!!  The server could use a lil perkiness. She seemed bored outta her mind...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20
Andrew K.,"West Haven, CT",7,6,,2.0,7/15/2014,Should have known better. But I'm an optimist and went into this thinking paying $20 for a ribeye would be satisfactory. Nope. It had been previously frozen and you could tell for a loooooong time. It was so bland and had a weird color to it. The fresh broccoli was far from fresh as well. Fries over salted. I say I should have known better because last time I can came (a long time ago) I got food poisoning from an undercooked turkey burger. 2 stars because the Tennessee bbq wings appetizer was actually good and prepared correctly. Would recommend that..... And nothing else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20
Kate F.,"Stratford, CT",6,2,,1.0,5/6/2015,"I will never go back to the place again! The food was mediocre and the service was even worse. There were only 2 of us and we chose to sit at the bar. Which was not crowded. At the most, there were 8 people total. And yet, with 2 people working the bar, it took 10 minutes to order a drink. Not only that, but the bartender seemed to be completely miserable. At one point, I asked him to repeat what he said because I couldn't hear him, and he looked at me like I had 2 heads.  It doesn't get much better from there. The manager (or so he seemed) would step behind the bar to help out washing glasses, but only interacted with a couple of gentlemen at the corner of the bar. At one point, he spent 20 minutes sitting with them talking to them, meanwhile ALL 8 people at the bar had empty drinks in front of them! When I finished my first drink, I waited 15 minutes before I was even asked if I wanted another. The whole time, both bartenders were running around like chickens with their heads cut off, but not serving patrons in the bar. This was the worst service I have ever received and I will not ever be going back to this establishment. And I will never recommend it either. If you want similar style food, excellent drinks, and much better service, go to Chili's down the road.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20

Ed M.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,17,,1.0,8/1/2015,They lure you in with the endless appetizers offer for $10 but they don't tell you you can only choose one and it's from a limited selection list. They charge $12 if you want to switch refills and order different ones.  My wife's BBQ chicken on flat bread arrived at room temp and my dumplings were hot one side fridge cold on the other. Boneless chicken wings were over breaded chicken nuggets with hot sauce.  One of my sons had a burger that was over cooked and the other one had the Memphis BBQ ribs and was happy but not $20 happy and both were still hungry.  Never returning.

Pablo E.,"Newark, NJ",7,19,6,3.0,7/7/2015,Customer service was pretty on point. They were really nice and friendly but a big problem we had was with the waiting. We were there an hour and a half just to eat amd finish. There was so much waiting. There were only one or two tables near us but it took much longer than we had anticipated. I ordered a French Dip amd ir tasted food non complaints. After wainting so long it just take your appetite away. With faster service I would.Definitely rate 4 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20
Yvonne M.,"Amherst, MA",4,11,,1.0,5/21/2015,"We had a terrible experience at this restaurant. We got seated quickly, but the table and the menu were dirty and sticky. We waited at least 10 minutes before anyone came to our table. We had to get the host to call over our server. And then she kept calling us all ""honey"".  They gave our food away to another table and had to make more. I've been to other Fridays where the service was good. This was terrible! I wish I had read the reviews before I went there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20
Joanne S.,"Hamden, CT",1,2,,3.0,10/20/2013,"As soon as I got to the table their was a dead fly on the table. I moved to another table in the bar area and it smelled as dirty rags we're being used to clean the tables. 5 minutes into me sitting, the young lady bar tender and a African male waiter started arguing in front of all the customers over a silly drink not being made. The manager had to tell them to stop arguing in front of customers. Such a turn off.  The good thing was our waitress was very kind and good was ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20
Joe S.,"Stowe, VT",0,6,,1.0,6/3/2015,"The good news is that the actual meal was not Bad: a small steak and filet of fish. The downside is that their $8 Coconut Mai Tai, which is supposed to have 2 different types of rum, barely tasted like there was any in the drink, and it came with no garnishments. But the most disappointing event of the meal was the service: It was early and not busy- hardly anyone in the place. She may have been a nice person- who knows? She barely spoke and disappeared for large amounts of time. Lets just say communication was not her forte. Either management does a poor job of training their staff, or this particular server just doesn't get it. She was tipped based on service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20

Jeremy H.,"Mount Holly, NJ",0,2,,2.0,3/14/2015,Great customer service however the lunch appetizers were less to be desired. I had the boneless wings and pork tacos appetizers and the pork tacos were intriguing the shells were stale there was no crisp to them and the texture reminded me of leather. The boneless wings were different from usual there was no crisp to them and the texture was different from the usual skin to the inside meat part. Wasn't great meanwhile my signicant other got potato skins and there was so much salt I could almost see her arteries clog. I'm not sure if it's just this location but either way I've been turned off of Fridays for a while to say the least,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20
Ben K.,"Los Angeles, CA",420,59,73,3.0,7/18/2014,"So you're here to try out the $10 ""Endless Appetizers"" huh? Here's the lowdown: it was alright....if you have 8 college guys that each order a different appetizer and share. The deal is you can personally order only one appetizer and get free refills on that as many times as you want. But I wouldn't want to be sitting there eating mozzarella sticks all day, would you? So get a few friends and share your dishes. It'll make a meal. The highlights included buffalo wings. We ordered the four different flavors, Tennessee BBQ, Garlic Parmesan, Buffalo or Scorching Hot. After a couple rounds, the varying temperatures of the wings didn't make us like them more. I think Garlic Parm was the best of the four and Scorching Hot was a close second. The other notable dish was the Pan-Seared Pot Stickers (aka dumplings). They were pretty good, but definitely seemed like they were just taken out of the freezer. The consistency wasn't present. The other dishes we got were: Tuscan Spinach Dip, Mozzarella Sticks, and Loaded Potato Skins. Just okay in taste, nothing special. Most of us got our money's worth but small groups or individuals probably won't because I wouldn't suggest eating so much of the same dish. Service was good and our server didn't discourage us from sharing the dishes, that was nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20
Ebony L.,"Orange, CT",0,1,,1.0,8/3/2014,WORST!  I went with a large party and the service was horrible. Both waiters had an attitude. There was something wrong with our food.  Everybody tongue was burning and my throat was numb. My friend started vomiting immediately. I will NEVER return to that place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20
Rebecca D.,"Boulder, CO",95,161,63,2.0,7/23/2012,"Came here for a late night dessert, but stumbled upon their buffalo wing appetizer, so ordered those to start. (1/2 appetizers make it easy to do so.) They had some other seemingly awesome happy hour specials, which would be worth checking out-  The wings were really just chicken tenders rolled in buffalo sauce- they werent the best, nor were they the worst. They were just okay. There dessert menu is pretty good too- we went with the brownie explosion- warm brownie topped with vanilla bean ice cream peacan nuts and fudge.  Biggest complaint about this place....the service was so....slow....... We were there for close to an hour, and all we got was one appetizer, and one dessert. It was possibly the slowest service Ive ever experienced at a chain restaurant . Granted it was busy for a Sunday, but it wasnt THAT busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20
Allison P.,"Trumbull, CT",0,4,,1.0,6/13/2016,"Went here and it was awful. The service was so slow, despite the fact that there was no one even there. It was happy hour during the week and they had maybe 5 other people eating. I went with my friend and sat down at the bar and it took 10min just for someone to acknowledge us! Then after they gave us the menus and asked if we were ready to order we said not yet. After another 5min they finally came over and took our drink order. It took two bartenders to make them and even with that  of course they messed them up. (by the way there was basically no alcohol even in them) We waited over 10min for them and they mixed up our drinks and put sugar on the rim of a diabetic who specifically asked for no sugar. After giving us our drinks they finally took our food order which took another 20min to even get to us. Nevertheless, after all that the food was disgusting. I ordered the bruchetta chicken pasta. Thinking it would be amazing after 20min of waiting it was basically a can of spaghetti o's with a disgusting tomato sauce. The worse part was the entire bar smelled like cleaning product!!!!!!!!WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20
Jinra I.,"Anaheim, CA",217,281,1,3.0,1/4/2012,"When I'm in in the city of Orange in my native California, TGI Friday's is rarely an option. Sadly out here in Orange, Connecticut, it is one of few options. Luckily, all the reasons why it's rarely an option in Orange, California hardly keep me from coming to this particular TGI Friday's in Orange, Connecticut. Food is great, especially for those on a budget. I usually like anything on the menu that has Jack Daniel's (that you can eat not drink) and appetizers. I've never really seen this location packed to capacity which is unlike the TGI Fridays in California -- it can get a little obnoxious there. As for service, it's okay. At the same time, I suspect that there's some card skimming fraud happening here. Be sure to bring cash when you come to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20
Mai T.,"Schaumburg, IL",108,174,487,1.0,2/12/2012,"Alright TGIFridays... Came in and was a little creeped out at the fact that there were 3-4 hosts standing there with menus all in hand for our party. I said 'for 6 please' and the response I get was 'we know, please follow us this way'. Persistence? Determined? Go-Getter? We sit down and was informed that our server was going to be right with us. 'Joe' comes to us and asks if we wanted anything else to drink besides water and proceeds with asking if we were ready to order. I'm sorry, would you like for us  to just leave as you're literally pushing us out? We say, one moment.. Joe comes back in a bit to get our order as he's delivering our waters. He tried holding 6 cups all at once by hugging it in his body...something isn't right. So, the cup I'm about to drink was held up against your shirt? Where there could be an array of things on there? Divine... We had order 3 steaks, 2 chickens, and one ribs order. 2 out of the 3 steaks were cooked so dry even though we stated medium RARE. We didn't ask for them to remake it since we knew other things could go wrong. The 2 dried steaks weren't even completely finish, not even half finished. 1 chicken was burnt and the other was considered 'blackened chicken'. The ONLY good part of that lunch was the kids ribs we ordered. Being that this is a National chain, don't expect the food to be the same. Could be the state, the cooks, the service, but always go in as if you've never gone before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=20

Lola J.,"Los Angeles, CA",151,14,239,2.0,8/28/2017,"Cute for a chill dirty mid day lunch or fun nights with friends. However when you order the salads make sure to get the dressing on the side.

Tam R.,"Trumbull, CT",0,2,,1.0,11/18/2017,Came here on a busy Saturday night. Understandably had a 45 minute wait which was fine. Once we finally sat down and ordered it took 1 hour for the food to come out. Couldn't understand how people who sat after us got food way before in a timely fashion. Finally the waitress came out and apologized stating they were backed up which again was confusing because it seemed like everyone else was receiving their orders promptly. So the food finally came out and it was cold as if it was ready but had just not been served. The waitress then says the last part of my order wasn't ready as if an hour wasn't already enough time. I'm disgusted by the service and the fact they served cold food after clearly forgetting to serve our table.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2

The host at the door was great as usual, but our waiter/ bartender should stay behind the bar. It took to long to get our drinks, and even longer to get our food. A couple that came in after us ate before us. And when we got up to leave,the manager came with our food offering to give it to us for free.

Everything seemed to have been frozen and reheat. I had the bourbon Barrell chicken and it was odd. Very sweet.  I also had parmesean steak fries but what I got was more like potato wedges. They had a weird texture like they had been frozen a while. They had that icy look that fries can get in the inside when they have previously been flash frozen.  Server.

Jessica T.,"Fairfield, CT",18,65,184,2.0,11/21/2015,"When I was younger, coming to TGIF was a treat. But I feel like they fell off, especially with some of the food.  I usually just order apps and/or a salad, although I remember the burgers were always really good. The last time I went, the presentation of the food was lackluster. Felt it was simply thrown together and that for me is off putting since I love to take and post pictures of the food! One of the apps we ordered were the potato skins, which looked very nonuniform. Some of the skins were covered in bacon while others had two or three pieces? The food was pretty average and the drinks are so-so for me.

I asked my niece if she wanted my tools out of my trunk so she could saw through the charcoal. The two burgers that were ordered were completely dry and hard. They were basically mini frisbees. I ordered a medium burger and got well well done. The fish that was ordered was dry and seemed old. The chicken tenders were enjoyed by my four year old nephew, who was happy just to eat after waiting for so long. (We asked for his stuff to be sent out first).

He regretted it big time, like threatening bulimia.  Our food was so bad that I think we will need therapy to get over the lasting trauma.  Our party ordered the bbq chick flatbread, boneless wings, potato skins, fajitas and 2 burgers.  I have seen TGI Fridays frozen meals in the supermarket and I pretty much think this is where our meal came from.  Maybe inventory wasn't up to date and someone had to run down the street to Shop Rite and stock up on some boxes???

I wish I could give no stars because TGIFs deserves it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=40
Cristina A.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,1,,1.0,4/19/2015,"Will never go back to this location or restaurant chain....ever again. Went there 3 times in 1 year and the service was horrible. Waitresses seemed miserable and disregarded us multiple times as she checked on others. I also realized 50 points was deducted from my rewards card because of inactivity....well maybe if your staff were more pleasant to their customers, I would want to visit a restaurant more often. Take your money elsewhere, not worth spending it at the Orange, CT location. I have had great experience in the Millbury, MA location, so thank you to them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=40
Michael L.,"New Haven, CT",3,12,3,4.0,2/8/2014,"I like this Fridays! It's a franchise so it is run a little better I feel. There's also good bartenders who work, one of which is very talented with bottle service. If you want a date night or some grub with your buddies, this TGI Fridays is definitely above average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=40
RJ S.,"White Plains, NY",5,204,6,1.0,9/1/2011,"Ended up here after Hurricane Irene knocked out our power, and many local restaurants were still closed. Should've skipped dinner that day, because this place is just awful.  First, they have the least vegetarian-friendly menu of any chain restaurant today, hands-down. The only vegetarian things available here are a couple appetizers, one soup, and sides (mashed potatoes, broccoli, etc.). That's it. Not a single entree. So while I'm not vegetarian, a number of my friends and family are, and subjecting them to this hellhole is particularly cruel. I ordered a steak medium - it came out well done. Fully gray through. Pointed out to our clueless waitress, who asked if I wanted another one. As it took 40 minutes to get the food in the first place, I didn't want to wait again, so I said no. The decent thing for her to do would be to offer a discount, a free dessert, a drink perhaps - nope, nothing.   The sides were shit too. Awful menu, lame service, inept cooking - TGI Friday's, and this location in particular, is the worst example of chain casual dining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=40
Andrea J.,"Richmond, VA",86,144,18,1.0,11/10/2012,Poor service and the food is just as bad.  Never had a decent meal at TGIF.  Everything is premade and heated when ordered.  Twice I have found hair and plastic in my salad.  Ugh!  Save your money and go somewhere else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=40
Qomar S.,"Bridgeport, CT",56,16,11,2.0,2/20/2013,"Asked if TGIF can make a Mexican Mojito and what if we do not like it. The waiter says, ""You take your chances."" NOT the answer we should have heard. The JD Ribs & Shrimp were good. The Strawberry Shortcake dessert is not as it is described. It reads, ""Pound cake layered with ice cream"" It arrived in a big margarita glass filled with ice cream and one nearly paper thin slice of pound cake vertically inserted. The waiter got another slice of pound cake, but... come on!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=40

Brad W.,"Vero Beach, FL",0,6,4,1.0,4/25/2013,"I was in town on business and stopped in for a bite to eat. I went to the bar since I was by myself sat down and the bartender asked me what I would like to drink. I replied I had to go into work this evening so a Coke or Pepsi would be fine. She then asked for my ID (which caught me off guard) I replied for a coke? She stated since I was sitting at the bar I had to prove that I was 21, which I found unusual but I complied (I'm 27) and showed her my ID. She brought me a coke and I asked for a menu, I sat there for just a few minutes looking over the menu. I decided on a California club, so I laid down the menu on the counter and began my wait. I sat there and waited close to 15 minutes as two bartenders walked back and forth poring drinks and following up with the food orders for the others around me. I began to become frustrated as I keep a close eye on my watch, as I saw the other bartender walk past me again I waved and asked for my check. He brought the check over and asked if everything was alright since I had only ordered a coke. I replied no, I would just like my check, and to get out of here. He replied would you like food or something; you seem very frustrated, I calmly said yes I did want food but I will be going elsewhere now. He asked what the problem was and began to raise his voice, I again replied ""I would just like my check so I can leave"" since he raised his voice I could see the other patrons beginning to draw their attention to the situation. I paid cash for my $3.07 soda left $0.50 on the counter and walked out. I have been traveling for close to 10 years and I have only walked out of one other restaurant in my life. This was thus far the worst customer service and complete waste of my time and money. I will be sure to share my experience with all other I encounter while here on business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=40
Jenn V.,"Branford, CT",14,23,7,1.0,2/27/2013,"We waited 20 minutes  for water. $10 for the puny nacho chip appetizer and the cheese wasnt even melted....Waste of money.   I asked the waitress about one of the sangrias, she informed me she wasnt sure because she hadn't tried it.  I did end up ordering it and it was fine, but the waitress had to be reminded to bring my drink. The bathrooms were completely revolting my 10 year old said, to the point that she held it until it made her physically ill....but that might have had something to do with the still wet chewing gum that she touched when she scooted in her seat...it was stuck on the edge of the table. Caesar dressing had buckets of lemon juice in it ...my fiances cajun chicken pasta was ok he said. My french onion soup was barely warm. The kicker was that when we walked in, the table behind the host stand had a clean table with a freshly made dessert on it. When we left, over an hour later, it was still there, only totally melted. Just a horrible experience. Doubtful that we will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=40
Joann O.,"New York, NY",221,17,8,1.0,5/12/2012,"Friday night me & a friend decided to have drinks & apps. We showed up at the restaurant at 9:30p- happy hour was at 10p. We walked into the bar & all booths were taken. I went back to the host & asked if we can wait for a table at the booth to open up. She said sure, her name was Nicole. She suggested that instead of waiting, that we would grab drinks at the bar & when a table is open we can grab it. 10 o'clock hits, no table was open - which was fine because we were having drinks. 10:15p a table was being cleaned. The host walks into the bar to see if a table was open, just in time I asked her if we can finally sit there. Her response was ""there are people waiting for that table"" I told her ""even though I have been waiting for 45 mins?"" but she ignored me & sat 4 people that just walked in the restaurant 15 mins ago. I'm sorry but her actions was not professional & not good costumer service. I never had a bad time whenever I go eat there until last night. When I was about to leave I was going to confront her & tell her about my issue she already left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-2?start=40
