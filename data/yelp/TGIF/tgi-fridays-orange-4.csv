Jennifer ..,"Newport Beach, CA",0,38,26,1.0,4/23/2017,"Never again will we go to this restaurant. Our waitress had  NO people skills. She was rude from the get go. It took about 15 minutes to get her to take our order and she only came over after we asked to talk to the manager. We requested another server because I wasn't going to sit all night waiting for service. The manager said we were have another server. The new guy came over and helped us 3 times then the other one came back and acted like she had never been replaced.  The food was bad. My daughter ordered the PARMESAN crusted chicken and when it was served it had a very strong lemon pepper smell and taste. My daughter can't tolerate so much pepper and couldn't eat the chicken. The worthless waitress said she will talk to the manager. When our check was brought it still had $14.99 for the chicken. I called her back over and asked WHY we are paying for the chixken, it was still sitting on my daughter's plate. She cut it up and took one tiny bite. The manager came over and got defensive of the doos. Saying the PARMESAN crusted chicken is made with a LEMON PEPPER crust. That's how it is made. It's supposed to taste like that. Then why call it PARMESAN? Call it LEMON PEPPER? After much back and forth with this manager I finally said, ""so we are expected to pay for this? Your resturant can't title food properly and an child almost eats a mouth full of pepper and that's ok? Fine....."" that's when she swiftly took the check and said it will be removed.

Bryan W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1107,1018,2609,3.0,5/30/2015,"I really miss the days when Friday's had its 3 course for 20 deal. Rarely could you finish the both the appetizer and the entrees, let alone the scrumptious desert. Unfortunately, now they've increased their prices and they only have a 2 course for 20 with limited options. I'm pretty sad that you are only stuck with a few appetizers and entrees to choose from (now you have to pay extra for the sirloin...). But it's understandable since such good deals in the past are not sustainable. Prices aside, Friday's is actually a really good restaurant. Their steak is amazing, their appetizers are appetizing, and their desert is worth trying. However, I'm just disappointed that it's so costly now.  Also, I noticed that my last review was taken down. I guess they make a clean sweep of their business page once every so often. But it's cool. Eat well and prosper,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=120

He got the ""chicken and shimp sizzler"" (I think that's what it's called) and I got the Cajun Shrimp and Chicken pasta. I'd give it 5 stars, but I'm not a fan of cheese (I can tolerate it to a degree)  So we got there and we were a bit confused. No one bothered to take us to a table for a good 5 minutes and it was pretty empty since it was a Thursday. A waiter eventually sat us down at a booth. Our waiter was quick and very nice! We didn't have to wait so long for our food. Both dishes came out hot, his came out sizzling. Both of our plates looked really good, and thankfully, it tasted just as good! I loved their pasta cause their sauce was really creamy and didnt clump up after 15 minutes like Olive Garden's pastas. I had a few bites of his plate and the chicken and shrimp had great seasoning! Then we got the brownie dessert and that was super good!  Overall:  Food: Good Portion: It won't fill you up, but they give you exactly enough so that you don't throw away the portions you couldn't finish Price: Great! Our brownie was $3.99 when the menu said $6.99 Service: Other than not being led to our table right away, it was pretty good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=120

Almost a full 70 minutes later we got our appetizers, our drinks weren't refilled, and we didn't have silverware. 90 minutes after sitting down we finally get our food and the plates are scorching hot and the food was barely warm so it was clearly sitting in the serving window for an extended period of time. Our server never came back to fill drinks or check on us.  It was the worst experience and I don't ever want to go back.

Our waitress was really nice and she checked on us frequently. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars tonight is because our $12 endless apps were terrible. I feel that it is such a big promotion that they just have the appetizers waiting on the kitchen table ready to go out because everyone is ordering them.. The problem was our spinach dip was cold, our boneless wings were also cold and a little undercooked so we sent those back, and then our last appetizer we tried was the potato skins and they were so overly deep fried that there was barley even any potato in the skin (if that makes any sense)...

And it took forever to get our food. We were 3 people and we ordered 4 food items. There was a larger group of 6 that got there after we had ordered and they got their food before we did. (40+ min after we had ordered) That's when the waitress finally decides to notice us and ask about our food. She comes out with our food and forgets about my friends order.

There was a 15 minute wait for a table, so we went to the bar and were lucky enough to find two seats at the bar.

They were all very nice, and I could tell they were really liked by the people around us who knew them. They have a really good happy hour. I think they had 6oz wine for $4 and 9oz for $6 -- so obviously I got the big one. They also have 1/2 priced apps, and my SO got a plate of chicken wings that looked bomb. Oh, and a plate of fries for a $1.50. I decided for forgo the apps because they have a gluten-free turkey burger, with an actual bun!

Robert A.,"Whittier, CA",50,145,40,3.0,2/18/2015,"Most people are fairly familiar with TGI Friday's, so let's get to what makes this location stand out. First off, this location for some reason gets really busy. It doesn't matter the day of the week. Especially at night, be ready to hurry up and wait for a table, even for small parties. The waiting area isn't very big either (as it seems with most TGIs), so if it's especially busy, be ready to wait outside. Speaking of waiting, be prepared to wait for your food after ordering. It could be because of the high levels of business, but on average, I've had to wait about 15-20 minutes for food to hit the table (for a party of 2). The service here is average. I've had both great experiences and really poor ones, so it all sort of balances itself in the end. Food quality itself, again, sort of fares on the average side of things. Overall, when coming to this location for a bite, don't be too surprised if you have to wait a bit for your chow. Other than that, nothing should be too disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=200
Michelle K.,"Anaheim, CA",57,101,305,4.0,1/13/2016,"I hope I'm writing this review for the right TGIF because there are two on Yelp and looks like same location! Well any who me and my friend came here one night and thankfully there were some tables open in the bar area. Our server was cool and nice. I'm glad they don't have that 2 for $20 anymore because I thought they had sucky options. I'm not a fan of there pasta here but I got the 1/2 rack baby back ribs and they were delicious. Now they have this new special, I think they have I items for $2, $4, $7+. I may be wrong on that part. I know for sure they have plates for $7. The baby back ribs that I got were only 13.99 and they came with two sides. Well when I ordered the server said it only came with one side but when it came out, I had two sides on my plate haha so maybe he forgot it really did come with two sides. The sides I chose was the baked potato and Mac n cheese. Surprisingly the Mac n cheese was really good. Because I am not too fond of their pasta here, I thought the Mac n cheese was going to be horrible. But I chose the Mac n cheese because I thought I'd give it a shot and never had their Mac here(and I love Mac n cheese in general). Oh yeah there were $4 options for dessert but we had to pass up on dessert because I had ice cream earlier.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=200

Julie H.,"Orange County, CA",880,426,2093,4.0,10/3/2014,"One thing I've come to appreciate about Friday's is their tenacity to continually improving the quality of the customer experience at their restaurants. I mean this generally rather than on a face to face basis. It had been at least 6 months since my last visit to Friday's and I decided to show up for a late dinner last night. I was greeted by two friendly hostesses who sat us within 10 minutes as they had initially indicated. The hostess explained the new menu and ordering via ipad (or some other tablet-looking device they had) option that they now have and informed us that we could order drinks, food and pay our bill on it. I was a bit worried that this meant that we wouldn't be seeing much of our waitress but she actually showed up 5 minutes later and was very friendly and provided excellent service. Their menu is a bit of a maze but the descriptions are great as are the pictures. They have a lot more side options than they did before. They have mozzarella and tomato salad, sweet potato fries and baked potatoes to name a few. Here's what we ordered: Shrimp cocktail appetizer: The sauce is decent, the shrimp are small.  Grilled Norwegian salmon with Langostino lobster: Comes with about 6 oz of salmon and is topped with a creamy mushroom sauce and small chunks of lobster. I had the baked potato and the tomato mozzarella for my two sides. The creamy sauce was definitely the best part of the dish. It enhanced the fishy taste of the salmon and lobster without making it taste too salty. The baked potato was good but a bit dry and the salad was tasty but not what I'm used to expecting with a caprese salad. It had bits of onion which took away from the usual pungent balsamic taste.  Philly stacked burger: My friend ordered this burger and said it was tasty enough but just not very big.   Oreo madness: Shareable dessert that doesn't make you feel too guilty calorie-wise. It has soft oreo crumb layers with cookies n cream ice cream sandwiched between them. Comes with a chocolate drizzle and whipped cream. Delicious!  If I had to offer any criticism, it would be for the portion sizes. You're paying enough money here to get a good amount of food and best way I could describe the portion sizes would be ""health conscious"". These portions are perfect for when you're watching your weight but I think we all look to splurge a little when going out to a restaurant like Friday's.  Nevertheless, our server refilled our drinks often, she immediately noticed when we ordered food on the ipad and brought it out for us and we got to catch up on sports news that was playing on their many tvs. All in all a great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=200

Deanna N.,"Orange, CA",75,7,2,1.0,3/10/2016,"My best friend and I go here all the time after we see a movie. This time I took my children and best friend to TGI Friday's. We were greeted and were sat very quickly. Our server Bre took the kids order so the food would come out quick so they wouldn't have to wait. Great I thought. We ordered our Apps and drinks.  Ten minutes later our drinks came and two of our apps arrived. Great i'm thinking, no wait. Our server came back and took our entree order. Then we wait, and wait, and wait. The kids are getting hungry we're all out of chips for the spinach dip. A whole twenty minutes go by and our food comes out but not the kids. Ten minutes later Bre shows up and asks if we need anything else. I let her know that we didn't receive the kids meals. She apologizes and rushes to get the meal. Three minutes later my kids sad excuse for a hamburger shows up. The kids do not touch it but they do eat the cold fries. The hamburger is cold to the touch, so it has been in the expo window for over thirty minutes would be my guess.  Bre comes back and I voiced my concerns with the cold hamburger. She just says, in a dejected tone, ""Do you want another one or just comped?"" I said to just comp it since they filled up on the chips. Once we get our bill I noticed that I am being charged $7.99 instead of the $4.99 for the salad. I asked Bre why I was being charged? She stated that I ordered off the lunch menu, but after looking at the menu that was incorrect. Bre then stated that she was new and that she pressed the wrong button. So instead of just saying I pressed the wrong button let me fix that, she lies, and then I question myself on what was the actual price. I asked if she could fix it it. I placed my card in the bill and my friend was going to place his card. That's when the bill was already taken and we couldn't divide the bill. By the time she showed up, I was already charged, before I could validate the changes made. That's when I asked for the manager. The manager showed up, looking already annoyed that  I woke him up, as he was disheveled and looked more like a Shift Lead than a manager.  Anyways I let him know my concerns about the bill, and how I wanted it split. No apology was given and he said ""Well I already gave you the comp on the Kids meal and I gave you $1.00 off."" Basically it translated to what else do you want. I am so sad as I always enjoy eating there, and my friend and I have a great time. It just seems like management does not properly train their employees, or wait staff. I will say Bre did a great job trying to fix things, but she needs to table touch more frequently as this could have been resolved sooner.  Management seems useless. By the reviews it looks like they do not care. Hopefully Global sees this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=200
Wendy L.,"Westminster, CA",675,154,119,1.0,12/18/2015,The hostess are very rude and unprofessional I've made a reservation for my boyfriend's birthday it was at 6 everyone was there and we didn't get seated till 8 ... Usually when you reserve a table isn't it suppose to be ready by then? What annoyed me the most that they weren't even nice about it. It irritates me how they try to make it seem like we're impatient when in reality I called in 2 days before my booked date you knew this was going to be happening why am I getting such an negative vibe? So we end up getting settled at 8 and gotten out food order taken right away food didn't come out till 40 mins later... Which is horrible Don't want to continue this review because I will get upset and end up mentioning names that isn't necessary.

Margo D.,"Fullerton, CA",149,273,257,3.0,9/21/2014,"I've always been a fan of TGIFridays, whether it be the happy hour specials, appetizers or food, however, today the good wasn't great.  First, when they have happy hour it's always good, cheap drinks and half off appetizers. My favorite appetizer would have to be the pretzel sticks that come with a beer cheese dipping sauce.  Drinks, you can't screw that up, their specialty drinks are all fairly good and they definitely have something for everyone's pallet.  Now on to the food, either I have a good buzz most of the time I've been and can't tell the difference between good and bad food or the quality has gone down.  I think I'll stick to beers and maybe an appetizer next time I go. For the prices (which seem to go up every time I've been) and the quality it's def not worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=220

I haven't been to this location is over 3 years and it seems like nothing much has changed. What we got: Ultimate Mango Mai Tai ($8): couldn't really taste the mango and my friend didn't really enjoy it at all. Skip this next time! Strawberry Lemonade ($3.25): just your average strawberry lemonade. I've had better. Jack Daniels Ribeye and Scampi ($24): comes with your choice of 2 sides and cornbread. Friend decided to get seasoned fries and broccoli. The ribeye was pretty tasty. Dip it in the Jack Daniels sauce if you want more flavor to it though. He ordered it rare and it came out closer to medium rare, but that was no big problem to him. Shrimps were grilled and kept sticking to the skewer.  Grilled Salmon w/ Langostino Lobster ($19.50): comes with your choice of 2 sides as well and I ended up getting the tomato mozzarella salad and sweet potato fries. Grilled salmon was moist, but it was a bit too salty for my liking and I love salty food! The langostino lobster was okay and they give you a pretty good amount of it too. I would skip the tomato mozzarella salad next time, it had wayy too much liquid inside the dish. Sweet potato fries were good though! Service: It could have been better. We got seated in the corner, so it seemed like we kind of got ignored.

I asked our server if there was a birthday special for my 14 year old cousin. It was some dessert accompanied by the birthday song sung by the staff.

I told her I want my steak medium well. Then as she was about to leave before I was done, I had to stop her to tell her I want the sauce on the side for my ribs. I don't know what she heard but she asked me again how I want it cooked. I repeated again, medium well for the steak. She was ready to leave again when I stopped her again to tell her I want the sauce on the side for the ribs. Finally it got thru to her. Well, it appeared that way. When the food came, guess how the ribs came out? Yup, sauce on the ribs!! :( I told her that's NOT how ordered my ribs. She took back the rib portion and later came back with the right one. Food.......Steak was good, fries (ordered sweet potatoes and regular) were good too. Ribs on the hand, it tasted a little raw. It had that porky smell. Needed more rub on it.

I tell him my order, and he ask me if I want to cash out now or give him my card. I was a little taken back, because a restaurant bar and grill has never demanded that I show proof of being able to pay my bill before even being served first.  I gave this guy my card, and noticed that my card was the only one in his tray with a bar full of customers.  I'm African-American, so now I start to feel my spide-sensuous tingling. Never wanting to be that ""it's because I'm black"" person, I set back and watch as 4 more new sets of customers came in, and he not ask for there proof of payment.  I was so hurt and upset that I was shaking. I flagged someone down who happen to be a manger, and informed him of what was going on. I told him to look at the racks where people's card are to be, and mine was the only one there with now a full bar of people. I was told sorry, and it was there policy to take a card in the bar area. Which was fine with me, if everyone's card was taken.  He went back and spoke with the guy, and he says that some people were regulars, so he knows them (will pay), and the others he had not had a chance to ask. He asked me as soon as I ordered.  Then this really nice women by the name of Teresa came out, and explained that it is their policy to ask. I let her know that I would be ok with the policy if it was executed evenly.  He asked me for my card before he would make my drink.  Others he made and served there drinks, but only asked for their card after I said something to management.  It was such an obvious show of discrimination, that I could not hold back my  rage which manifested in tears.  Because of this Orange location.

Lol.  We'd rather go cheaper any chance we get. So instead of paying 25$ for our items we payed 51$. Not including tip.  So in total about 58$.   Our server did her thang.  Awesome service even with the busy crowd.   I just hope the company' works on having more consistency in regards to promotions like happy hour.  We look forward to those daily options but not ones that hurt our pockets.  We're gunna be in the area for a while the next month or so but trust that tgi Fridays won't Be our first pick to enjoy a meal at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=220

The String Bean Fries, were good.  I only tried one, but I liked it!  I think I would have preferred them dipped in Ranch, I think they were in some sort of mustardy sauce.   The bar was slow, and there were maybe 5 other people there most of the time we were.  The service, was even slower.  The bartender tried to give us someone elses food, and about 10 minutes later I asked him if he could please check on our food.  He came back with it, which just means it would have sat there until I said something eventually.  How come no one brings the far food orders out to the bar... Quite a few people ordered Steak and Lobster, which I guess was on special for $14.99... I just cant understand that. Anyway, the glass of house Chardonnay - Kendall Jackson was a good glass of wine.  Two appetizers that were half off, and two glasses of wine, for $25 didnt seem like much of a happy hour deal to me.  I didnt eat most of the nachos, the service was just fair... definitely would suggest going into one of the other restaurants inside the outdoor shopping area instead for... anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4

Chris N.,"Fountain Valley, CA",276,198,1895,3.0,4/26/2017,"I like this location a lot better than the one at Westminster Mall, but that actually doesn't mean much. This location was the first TGIF's I've ever tried; i was introduced to it by a family friend. We usually only go here for happy hour or after an Angels or Ducks game late at night. I've been here many times and the wait time fluctuates from no wait time up to 30 minutes. The service is really friendly but very slow and inattentive. The servers always provide us information about the menu and the happy hour but they take forever to refill drinks and  bring out the food.  When we come here during happy hour, most of the appetizers are half-off so we usually get the potato skins, cheeseburger sliders for $1.50 each, Jack Daniel traditional wings, chicken nachos, mozzarella sticks, and my favorite Jack Daniel boneless strips. The food took about 30 minutes to come out but we were still missing some of our orders. We had to notify our server  and they said they are going to check on it. The server came out to apologize that the order was never placed. We had to wait another 15 minutes. I felt like the only food items that were actually good today were the mozzarella sticks (cheesy and hot), traditional wings (juicy and tender), and the potato skins (crispy outer shell but soft inside potato). The cheeseburger sliders and Jack Daniel strips were overcooked so the meat was dry. The chicken nachos didn't seem freshly prepared.with ingredients tossed messily. Usually, all of the food is pretty good. Today was an off-night. Overall, the food is decent and their service is sub-par. They might close at 2AM but their kitchen closes earlier so make sure to order before they abruptly tell you that you can't order anymore. They have great happy hour menus and drinks at a good price. This location have different events for each day of the week. I believe that Wednesdays are karaoke night so I usually go up and sing when the drinks increase my confidence. I recommend people to try out their happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4

She said something like, ""I didn't want you guys to wait any longer, so have this and I'll bring out the ribs later."" I thought that was a very nice. Anyway the ribeye with the glaze was Amazing! One of the best steaks ever and my favorite sauce of all time now! It tastes sort of like a super sweet soy sauce. I love soy sauce.  I couldn't get enough of that sauce. I put it on the steak, fries, and rice. Delicious.  The fries and rice alone were nothing spectacular. Very plain but they complemented the steak and ribs later.  The ribs came about 10 minutes later and were good too. Not amazing either, but great with the glaze! Overall, amazing meal, but we wanted dessert.  So we ordered the Brownie Obsession and it came in 5 minutes. $7 for vanilla ice cream on top of a hot chocolate brownie drizzled in hot fudge and caramel. Pricey but delicious! Perfect ending to a great meal. It all just melted in the mouth.  Overall, long wait but very worth it. Nice waitress and conformable atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4

The meal was not good, but fine, it's Fridays - I don't expect better from them and wouldn't bother to do a review based on that alone. When it came time to check out we used the Ziosk terminal at the table. Here is where things went wrong... We had a $32.40 bill, I took photos of two of the Ziosk-calculated tip amounts we observed: $7.00 even at 9.4%, and $14.83 at 20%. Now, go read that again! And again just to be sure. Yes, the Ziosk terminal is GREATLY FALSIFYING tip calculations. 9.4% is really $3.05 and 20% is $6.48. Apparently Fridays expects you to be 1) drunk, or 2) stupid, or 3) both, when it comes time to pay, Unfortunately many people are not so hyper-aware, or simply assume that a restaurant would not try to STEAL FROM THEM. But Fridays does.  How many years has this been going on? How many thousands of customers have they defrauded? p.s.

Friend ordered shrimp with her dinner and the shrimp never came we asked the waitress three times and it never came so went to the manager and complained about that and the service and the manager's response was yeah I know we took the shrimp off your bill and that was it.

We arrived and immediately it was crowded took about 30 min to get a table but the hostess nor person who walked us to our table seemed excited, but whatever.  We got to our table and the waiter was fine, he did his job but wasn't welcoming. He didn't smile once but took our order made sure we got refills. Our food took a really long time to arrive. We ordered appetizers but those took 20 minutes to arrive. It got to the point where I had to ask our waiter what was taking so long and his response was it'd only be a few min longer. Our appetizers came out and we're really good. However, once they arrived our server said our entrees were ready as well which sucked cuz we then had to gorge the appetizers not really enjoying them to make room for the entrees.  Overall the food was great and I'd recommend everything we ordered. It was happy hour all day so we took advantage of that. Also, we had a 20% off coupon that I had received from TGIF via email as I'm a Stripes member. So good food and great music, Sports on all the TV's which was super awesome.

I wanted to give this place 3.5 stars, but since it's a chain and I assume that they have better logistic and resources, than a mom and pop restaurant, so I'm less forgiving and I'll give them 3 stars.  We (my mum and I) went there because we were supposed to meet with a friend of mine, who never showed up  (but apologize profusely). To start we ordered sangria, it was weak VERY weak, even more compared to the mean sangria that my family makes, this is was like the 99 cents store version of that. Order at your own risk. My mom ordered steak with potato and veggies side orders. She ordered the meat medium rare and they brought it 3/4 :( but regardless this detail my mom was pretty satisfied with the meal. I ordered a salmon, it was good, the veggies were a bit mushy but still ok (BTW it was good not great, but again is an average price chain, cost/benefit?) When finished we started asking for the bill, but it took  whileeeeeeeeeeee for them to acknowledge us and bring it to us.  Maybe they were under stuffed?

Jennifer G.,"Santa Ana, CA",9,25,26,1.0,10/7/2017,"I came here on a Saturday afternoon at 12:40 PM here bc my older sister told me that they have good pasta here and she said that it's good so I decided to come here the one at the block. It was me and my older sister we walked in and we had a wait for the hostess to get off the phone so she can seat us, we got seated. Their menu book looks and feel like a cardboard and cheap. Then we got a waiter ider what was his name he was white and we both asked for water and he says that he has to ""check""  if they have any?  Like seriously what waiter says that like it sounds like a restaurant can't even afford water? Then we ordered a pasta, my sister got the pasta idk wat it was called with no shrimp and she  told the waiter that she's allergic to seafood and that she didn't want it on her plate or cooked with it. I ordered a the same thing but with shrimp. It took 35 minutes to receive our orders and the waiter didn't even apologize for for the wait that they took so long and my sister asked the waiter if the orders were cooked separately and that if it didn't have shrimp and he says he didn't heard what we said to him when we told him to his face? My sister she liked her food for me I didn't even like it at all. The pasta was shitty for me the shrimp was way too dry, didn't have a lot of flavor, it had less pasta instead they put more sauce which it was too oily for my taste. We had to use their device thing to call our waiter to ask for napkins and it took him almost 35 minutes to get any service is so unacceptable. Idk if the management hired people that don't even know how to cook, the waiters/waitresses to attend people very well, but I think they hired anybody that doesn't even have restaurant experience. For 17.99 each for almost 18 bucks is not worth the price, I honestly think it's a ripoff. It used to be 12 bucks now it's 17 bucks. It should have more food and flavor. But I think they're quality of their food has gone down that they don't put their effort on the orders since they raised their prices up to beat other restaurants (meaning every restaurant around their competitions). I used their coupon for 25 percent off it helped to avoid wasting money. If you want to get better food quality with better service go to El Torito instead of coming here not worth the wait or money. If you want something fast for your convenience go to Carl's Jr. I didn't even wanted to tip the waiter bc he took so long but I don't think I won't be back.

Great company and conversation for the most part but as I took my last bathroom break, I literally returned seconds after they called last call.

The other bartender was ready and willing to help me but as he reached for my glass the guy in front of me cut him off and straight up said no. I'm never one to complain but this was a bit much. So I said ""oh okay, like that."" He then mumbled something and they both snickered. It's one thing to decline something but to insult me in front of my face is another.

I never got a call.  I called them 2 days later and a manager told me to call the district office.  No one had any concern about my husband and no one asked how he was.

Sadly the bartenders didn't know the prices of any of the drinks but that is not my reason for the one star. The reason is because for the whole time we sat there, about 2 hrs, not once did we see these bartenders (3) wash their hands once. They were wiping their hands on their jersey or their pants and continuing on making another drink, squeezing limes and getting beers. They also never once washed the mixer cups, we saw them make multiple Margaritas, a Hawaiian Drink and a midori sour all using the same unwashed glassware. I am sorry but that is completely filthy and a serious health concern, what if someone was allergic to pineapple juice or another ingredient in those other drinks?

A lady from their corp. office called and left a massage on my voice mail that she was the director of operation and to call her back.

I chose the sirloin and bacon wrapped shrimp and the sides were lemon broccoli and crispy Brussels sprouts. The steak and shrimp were perfectly cooked, as was the broccoli.

The server was nice and attentive, but didn't realize we wanted a section with a TV apparently. There were a few mix ups with our drinks, but that wasn't the major problems. The real issue was when the food orders were incorrect. Also, asking for extra sauces was a pain because we received them towards the end of finishing our meals.

There's a wait to get seated even though most of the tables are empty and the food comes out slow as well. Probably due to a lack of workers late at night.  I love coming here on Wednesdays after Dave & Busters (1/2 off games on Weds). They changed their rib special. Their Wednesday rib special is now called ""ribs & ribbons"" and you have to buy a drink in order to order a full rack of ribs for $12. The ribs come with two sides such as: mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, fries, sweet potato fries, broccoli, jasmine rice etc. I got the fries & mac and cheese. For the mac and cheese they used the penne shaped pasta, instead of the macaroni shaped pasta. It was also not as cheesy I would have liked it to be. You can also ask them to split your rack of ribs into two plates if you are sharing with someone (they also split the sides for you :D).

Not bad considering the whole world was out drinking. They sat us by the bar so everything was really loud and just an absolute racous. I ordered a Rib eye steak and lobster dinner with parmesean potatoes and garlic mashed potatoes. To drink I had green bud lights which kept coming all night. The food was decent but nothing to write home about. The steak was actually cooked to perfection and very flavorful.  The lobster was grilled so it came extremely dry. I had to peel it off the shelf so it looked like I was peeling a giant cock a roach.  Not the most appealing .  The parmesean potatoes were fried and they were not good. It seemed like they had gone to the fryer one too many times. The mashed potatoes were good. In all considering I was eating steak and lobster at Tgif for $23 it wasn't to bad of a deal. It turned out to be a fun night and everyone was feeling tipsy towards the nights end.

All 5 of us ordered off the happy hour menu and she came somewhat reasonably to check in and get our next orders but didn't clear the table of our empty glasses or plates which is annoying of itself. We stacked everything and put it at the end of the table to even make it easy....she came and asked if we wanted another drink or if we were ready to tao out (it was our second drink) and we said we were no where near ready to tap. She came back and we all ordered our next round and she asked if we wanted our checks split or all together (didn't even asked if we wanted anything else). So we asked to split it since she could and when we got our bills we found out that our last round of drinks weren't on happy hour and we paid full price.

I would've ordered something different had I known we weren't on happy hour anymore.

We were charged for the birthday dessert the server brought out.  Normally, this would not be a big deal; but, we came here for dessert and did not order that item.  The fact that we were charged for the birthday dessert in this case was a bit distasteful.  We were not aware of this until the bill came. The other item was not a big deal.  We were trying to watch the USC game.  Among the many screens that were displaying, we requested the game to be displayed on one of the screens.  The hostess seemed dumbfounded on how to handle this when she was seating us.  Afterwards, we asked our server, who was more than happy to check for us; but, we never did get the game on on any of the screens in front of us. My friends and I were disappointed in this experience and one of them was talking about sharing their experience on social media.  I hope that this is an isolated situation and not something that your patrons typically experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=260

Lets talk about 1) Wait time 2) Service 3) Bathroom 4) Quality 1) We came in at 11, the lady came and took our drinks order at 11:10, drinks did not arrive until 11:30... THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS! It was not even that busy, which upset me the most. We then waited until 11:40 for her to come back to take our order. We ordered, and did not receive the food until 12:10. WHAT A JOKE... 2) Service was absolutely horrible. At 12:00 I wanted to order a drink so I went to go look for our waiter (Yes, I stood up and went to find her). She was chatting it up with a fellow person at the bar (I don't even think she was working there). I had to stand in front of her and the person for literally 2 minutes to get her attention, and it was just awkward...  By the way, the only thing I ordered was a basket of fries, there is no way that takes 30 minutes to make. Fries sit in a fryer for 3 minutes and its ready, why did it take 30 minutes to only bring out fries??? 3) Wow... If the FDA came here, this place would be shut down. I walked into the bathroom, the smell... AHHH!!!! The first thing you see is paper towels ALL over the floor, even where they don't belong (by the toilet). The trash was overfilled and paper towels were everywhere. I was surprised that TGIF has not even been shut down yet. 4) The quality was not as bad, but the fries looked/tasted like they had been sitting out of the fryer for like 20 minutes (which they probably had been because it only takes 3 minutes to take fries).  Overall, I really think the manager needs to revisit their staff and seriously take care of the store. There should be no excuse for what I saw and experienced.

Called the day of to make the reservation and everything goes smoothly (so I think). We get there at the time of the reservation to find out the reservation paper was THROWN AWAY (not something you wanna say to a guest) and had to wait 45 minutes for a table. Defeats the purpose of making a reservation. Then food takes forever and when it does arrive a few dishes were cold. Management seemed to care less when we complained as well. I work in guest services and know what I experienced isn't acceptable. I came to this establishment because I had gone to several group events and never had an issue.

Food is fine, seems like in the last few years the quality of the food has decreased while pricing has increased but it's nothing to keep you away. They have a full bar and variety of menu items to choose from. It's always a coin toss on whether you'll get great customer service or mediocre service regardless, you'll never get outright bad service.

To celebrate birthdays, girls night out or just simply for dinner. the times ive been here with friends have been good, except for the last time i came which was on a friday nite with two friends. we got there and the wait wasnt so bad, it was early too around 730 pm so that might be the reason why the wait wasnt so long. wait time on a friday night after 8ish is sometimes up to an hour. we got called and got seated on a table but we asked if we could be seated in a booth, which was no problem. yay for booths! haha our server came in and asked for our drink order, we already knew what we wanted so the three of us order the drinks that come in mason jars. we were so excited to get our drinks! but were soo dissapointed when he brought us the drinks! one of our friend did get her drink in a mason jar but me and my other friend got our drink in a regular tall glass... i asked the waiter about the jar and he said the drink we order didnt come in a mason jar and in hes words he told our other friend that got her drink in a mason jar ""you got lucky"". he left and for a moment i accepted what he told us. but then i was like no, our drink is under the mason jar drink menu and no where does it say the drink we order come in a regular tall glass. so when he came back i told him i wanted my mason jar because it does not say my drink comes in regular glass he then admits to messing up our order and tells us he'll bring our jars after we are done and i say no, i want my jar now. he goes back and brings the jars, empty. he then says it will cost more to order the same drink. at this point idgaf i just wanted my mason jar. but my other friend gets offended by what he says and asks for a manager. long story short, and after my friend telling him what happened he tells us he will cover our appetizers and drinks the manager takes our drinks with mason jars and fills them with our drink and brings them back and apologizes and also assigns a new waitress. after that everything went good! we all order the canjun chicken and shrimp (pasta with a sauce that taste kinda like alfredo sauce, shrimp and chicken) recommended by the waitress. it was really good. our drink was in a mason jar which you can take home, we got the june bug, it wasnt strong, but i did enjoy the taste, fruity taste. make sure they give you the drink in a mason jar!!!! as for appetizers i order the spinach and artichoke dip with chips, my all time favorite appetizer, my other two friends order boneless chicken wings and potato wedges. i was so upset they dont longer serve the tgif appetizer plater which came with chicken wings, mozzarella sticks and,  potato wedges. i was going to order dessert but i got full with my drink, appetizer, and dinner plate. but ive been craving the red velvet cake!! my favorite dessert from tgi fridays. sign up in there website and receive a free appetizer or dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=360

I must admit, their lunch specials and happy hours are spectacular, but to pay full price during dinner is pretty outrageous. That is why I HIGHLY recommend the ""give me m ore stripes"" club. Easy to sign up and you always get coupons and free meals.  The food: I always go for the jack daniel's burger or flat iron steak. The burger i can never go wrong with, YUM. However, although I love the steak, their consistency of cooking it is not up to par. If I'm paying $20 for a small steak, that better be one hell of a juicy med rare steak!  The desserts: i love them all, strawberry shortcake you stole my heart. Service: It is truly a hit or miss. Some waiters/waitresses will be on their A game and some is just filled with laziness or lack of remembering. I love the ones that refill my water without me having to ask. One of my biggest peeves here would be the staff members standing around gossiping around the restaurant.

The second time, the waiter couldn't even bring us a menu.  He took our drink orders and the rest our time in the restaurant was spent gazing in disgust and frustration at his rear end as he hovered over the two female diners seated across from us who had finished eating their dinners.  He was trying to spit game while donning his waiter garb and smelling like fried food!  Rather than complain, we just got up and left so we could spend our money elsewhere.  We vowed never to go back to this trashy location.  An awful experience!!!

I went in with a couple of people last night after a long day at work, I was starving just wanted something to eat. The food took absolutely for ever and the management with absolutely no help whatsoever. I had an issue with my food the manager came to the table she didn't actually understand what the problem was so therefore not able to fix it, later on when I complained about the amount of time it was taking for my food as well then she finally realized what it was I was talking about  when I was explaining place  earlier on but by then I didn't care about the issue I just wanted my food right away. I really think they need to address how long it take to get your food at this location as well as the managers way of handling things.

When we got our food, we asked out server what happened to the ""spinach dip."" He said that we never ordered it! I was pissed! The server denied that he was our server when he took our order and tried to point the blame on another server that was at the bar that gave our drinks. What's even messed up was before we ordered from him, we asked if it was ok to sit at to the border of the bar.

Shanda H.,"Orange County, CA",305,90,236,2.0,8/11/2013,"i got the potato skins. They were the worst I've ever had! They look like the cheese had already been pre-melted and then melted over again and the potato part was too thick and not crispy.  I have bought the TGI Friday's frozen ones in the grocery store  and never bought again because they SUCKED.  These taste just like those! I also ordered some White Russians mixed with coke and they were iced down and weaker than I've had elsewhere. So, with the crappy potato skins & weak drinks, now lets throw in maybe the worst waitress I've ever encountered: Natasha (short curly light brown hair with glasses) If she sees this review, maybe she will wonder why the tip was less than even doubling the tax.  Well, Natasha, here are the multiple reasons why that happened: 1) very limited to non-existent eye contact 2) when we ordered the drinks, we also asked for water, but she never bothered to bring any water. We had to ask for it again 3) when the potato skins arrived, there were no eating utensils, so I asked her for those and she just grabbed them off another table.  She didn't even realize until I asked that there were no utensils 4) after she walked away, I then realized I didn't have a plate, so had to put the thing on a napkin on top of the table and try to use it as a make shift plate, as the grease soaked through, making it start to tear so the thing started touching the table underneath.  When she eventually returned to help fellow patrons seated next to us, I then asked for plates and she brought some and some napkins as well! yeah, so the only napkin we had while waiting for her to return, was the one that I was currently using as a plate that was previously wrapped around the utensils she'd grabbed off of another table. 5) When she brought the bill, she could clearly see there were 6 potato skins remaining and she just walked away after leaving the bill, without even asking us if we needed a to-go box!  So, of course, wait even longer then, to wait till she comes back, to ask for a to-go box. It seemed blatantly obvious that she must not have any experience as a waitress, so I realized that maybe if I needed a job in the future, should the current one not work out, I could always apply at TGI Fridays, since apparently, they don't require any previous experience in that profession - or if they do - maybe they just don't check the applicant's references??

Priscila H.,"Southeast Anaheim, Anaheim, CA",34,5,1,1.0,11/6/2017,"Is it just me, or does almost every server at this Fridays look like they hate their life? I think I just always have bad luck with this location. I don't think I've ever genuinely had a nice or caring server here unless it was a manager themselves assisting in serving the food and checking up on us. I usually only come here for the appetizers since its the only part of the menu I like to eat. You would think only having to serve appetizers would be a simple task, and maybe I just always catch the servers here on a bad day, but they take FOREVER to bring out a plate of mozzarella cheese sticks or 4 chicken wings. It's kind of disappointing. In my recent visit to this location, we were told no take out bags for the ""Endless Appetizers"" promotion. Fine. We didn't need any. We all got our own plates and naturally wanted to share food with each other since it was all finger food. Our waitress was hovering over us the entire time which I thought was just her being attentive to whether we needed more water, anything else, etc. Instead, she comes up to us and tells us that because a member of our party ate half of an appetizer another member of our party had ordered, she would have to pay for an entire other meal. WTF?! Read over the tiny black print at the bottom of the menu and yes, no take out boxes, yes, only one plate at a time, but absolutely no mention of not being able to share. Not to mention it took our waitress over 15 minutes to bring out one small plate and she intentionally waited till I finished my plate till she brought out my friend's food. The fact that she was willing to make another member of our party wait so long for her food just to enforce some rule she made up is BS. Not the first time I've had to wait what felt like ten years for an appetizer and was treated poorly at this location. I doubt I'll be returning.

My amiga on the other hand...not too smart. ;) She babysat her drink for about 30 mins before I called her out on it. Once I took a sip, I knew why. Her drink was WAY watered down and tasted old lemonade. (even considering the melted ice). She told the waitress and she exchanged the drink unpleasantly. I, on the other hand got a blended margarita, and their $5 Ultimate Mai Tai, which was pretty awesome. And for $5? Heck yes.

When he did came he told us about the happy hour specials by taking my menu out of my hand to show me what was available. Then took our drink order which was just water. We again waited about 5-6 mins for our waters. Then I asked him a question about redeeming my stripes (reward program). He was rude and said if I had a the coupon. Well once he gave me a half ass answer. He left again with out asking if we were ready to order. Which we were! Again we waited for him to return a 3 he took our order. Which my friend order a bowl of Broccoli Cheddar soup. When his soup came to the table it was not right. It was Clam Chowder. By this time went to the hostess and ask to speak to a manager. The hostess ask me to give her a moment. Which I did and waited for awhile. Then I told her that I was still waiting and I wait at my table for the manager. The manager (Ian) and told him my concern and that I was very unhappy. He apologize and that he will take care of it. We finally get out correct food. NOT once did our waiter come by an ask if the food was ok. He just kept walking by and just refilled our water cups. Then he finally came and ask if I wanted a box for my food, now hurrying us out.  Once I finished he took my plate asked about dessert and I told him I wanted the Oreo Madness, and then he walk away without asking if my friend wanted anything and for me to ask for my dessert to go. I told one of the other servers and he came back to the table and slam my dessert on to the table and said have a nice day.  I asked to speak to Ian again and waited for 10 mins before he came. And I told him what his waited did and he was lucky I did not take the dessert and slam it into his face. And while I was yelling at Ian in front of everyone and told him that his staff our all asses. And proceeded to leave, but stop in the waiting area and warned every that if they happen to get a waiter (which I finally get the name of) named CASEY he is an Asshole and I am sorry and would just leave now, and go somewhere else for dinner.

Steve R.,"Temecula, CA",0,9,,1.0,2/15/2014,"My wife and I arived at 5:00 pm, on a Saturday. Experience was Very disappointing, especially after I looked across the street and saw a BJ's right there close by. Should have driven around and made a better choice. Here's the scoop: Hostess nowhere to be seen when we entered. At first it didn't seem they even HAD a hostess station. Lots of people sitting (15-20) in the waiting area. I look around to see 3/4 of the tables are empty. After a couple of minutes waiting, hostess arrives and I assume that we would be seated. WRONG! She asked for our name and wrote it down, said it'll be five or ten minutes. ???? She disappears. I looked around, counted 25 tables open (that I could see) and 7 tables with people seated. WTF? Everyone else in the waiting area were seemingly just as perturbed over the same thing.     We ordered potato skins appetizer, came out cold, bland, and tasted like it was frozen and microwaved for serving. My wife ordered a steak medium rare, it came barely medium and was cold. I ordered buffalo chicken sandwich, but hold the buffalo, make it dry with ranch on the side. In this case, size matters because it was appox 2"" X 5"" in size, total. The chicken breast was pounded thin, appox 1/4""-3/8"" thick, 3/8-1/2"" thick if you include the breading. Even as small as the sandwich was, the chicken didn't cover the bread. Tiny. If you ever looked at a Burger King original chicken sandwich   patty, this is about 1/2-2/3 that size, and not as thick in most places. The bread was ciabatta, and hard as a rock. Really. I could bang it on the table and you could hear it across the restaurant. Fries were cold and soggy. Order took 45 minutes to get to the table in a nearly empty restaraunt.   Everything served here either comes out of a box frozen, or held forever under a heat lamp that's pointed in the wrong direction. It's fast food quality, barely. Cheap mall food is way better. And better for the money. My wife had a 10 oz steak and baked potato, a cup of soup, I had the tiny, rock hard, dry chicken sandwich, two sodas and the potato skin appetizer and that came to almost $50.00!    Save youself the horrific dining experience and just go to BJ's or Dave and Busters, or ANYWHERE ELSE but here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=420

And yes it's pretty rude that you just kept walking pass us and not bothering to look over at us. So finally we get to order our food. And it all was mediocre to say the least.  The three item appetizer combo was ordered and it was decent. Not much you can say about fried food, I'm just glad the buffalo sauce on the hot wings was not terrible...LOL I had the petite sirloin dinner and ordered it medium well. The meat was so tough and whatever was used to season the meat was very salty. The mashed potatos were the only edible thing on the plate. The side of vegetables was terrible!! First of all, the brocoli smelled really bad, it was probably really old or something. Couldn't eat the other veggies because they were way, way, way too salty.  I was not expecting some healthy meal from TGIF's but I was expecting it to be edible. This was the fist time that I've had such a terrible experience at one of the TGIF chains.

I was able to enjoy the: * Thai Pork Tacos - very good.  Though they were tiny (you get three), the meat was tender, the veggies and sauce were proportionate.  I really enjoyed them and would order them again.  Kind of an appetizer serving, but it was good enough for dinner for one. * Shrimp Pasta - also very good.  HUGE serving - this was the entree that is new and part of the ""Dine for $10"" deal.  I actually shared this plate with my BF, who ordered it.  There is a decent amount of shrimp in this dish, not just 3 or 4 pieces.  A typical pasta dish with tomatoes and spinach, it was tasty and filling. Service wasn't bad - our server was generally attentive to our table of 5.  My fork, however, was still dirty - I'm not sure how an employee can wrap them in a napkin and place them on a table without noticing.  (This is where I think dishwashers aren't the greatest idea).  He forgot to adjust the price to reflect the $10 deal, but he followed through once we mentioned it.  NBD, just make sure you check out your bill once brought out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=140

They all stayed quite for about 10 seconds and until the girl with the phone said ""okay"" and then basically ignored me and started taking the guy's info who was standing behind me. Right as I took a seat, the guy behind me came up saying ""they are calling you."" I look up and one of the girls said ""uh we need a name!"" I stood up and said ""Andrea."" Half way through saying my name, she interrupted in a stuck up voice, ""Thank you!"" Probably one of the rudest restaurant experiences of my life!

But the reason I am really taking the time to write this review is because of the manager on duty ""Beth"". Beth made it a point to make sure my kids were taken care of by bring extra things for them to occupy their time as they were a little cranky. Her kindness and caring demeanor totally changed our kids demeanor therefor making my wife and our time more enjoyable. ""Beth"" didn't have to take the extra time out of her shift to do these things but she did, by doing this not only did she make our night better but the surrounding guests as you can imagine.  Because of Beth I would recommend this location to anyone and would take pleasure in returning anytime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=340

It was a little dirty the server said he would be back to clean it off....10 mins later he came with menus we asked again about he table he came back and finally cleaned it off and walked away... 10 mins later he got our drinks... And about 20mins later we had to wave down the server to order. I got a pasta and my friend got a dish with chicken and Mac and cheese and said no Mac but if she can get mashed potatoes he wrote it down and put it in. When we finally got our food the order was wrong...  It had Mac and cheese on it. So we told the food runner and he said he would fix it. I kid you not the server came back with the dish and asked 4 times what was wrong with it. I asked to speak to the manager and he finally came out and talked to us. I get it we all have days like that but when we clearly say something 4 times and still waited about a hour and 20 mins for everything. Not good Service at all.

Mary L.,"Fullerton, CA",334,34,4,3.0,6/4/2013,"Came here today because my boyfriend has a $23 certificate to T.G.I so we wanted something that satisfy my tummy but cheap (college students on a tight budget). We went on a Saturday night so there was quite a few people waiting before us but it only took about 10-15 minutes before they seated us.  We were seated and about 5 minutes later, our waitress ask us what we liked to drink and we both wanted water. My bf and I decided that we wanted the 2 for 20 deal and order dessert after: For our app: we got the mozzarella stick: it was good but the best was the marinara sauce ( I REALLY like the sauce for some reason) maybe because I was just really hungry! hahaha! BUT we had to wait about 30 minutes for our app.. it took a really long time for some reason and when we were done with app it took about another 20 minutes for our entree. We waited really long for our food! :( But this is what we order:  For my entree I got the parmesan crusted chicken (which was an extra 3 bucks) and for my sides I had tortelline with a spinach cream sauce  and a tomato and mozzarella salad. I decided chicken because  I didn't want steak or pasta and I must say it is my favorite dish from T.G.I so far. The chicken was really moist and the sides goes well with the chicken. The spinach cream sauce was very tasty as well it fits perfectly with the chicken. Highly recommend! My bf got the Jack Daniel Chicken with fried shrimps with loaded mash potatoes and cole slaw ( which was an extra 5 bucks). It wasn't worth the money. The sauce was good but the Chicken was plain and flavorless. My bf was eating off of my food rather then his! He hated the cole slaw because it wasn't to his liking. It was honestly personal taste he liked shredded cole slaw (like KFC).  Finally for dessert: we ordered the Whiskey cake (or something along that line) It was really good. It finished my night! I would recommend sharing this dessert because it is really sweet but it's one of those dessert where you would want to come back for more! I believe it is a toffee cake with topped pecans and vanilla ice cream on the side! The sauce was my favorite: there is this white sauce ( I don't know what it is) but it's my favorite! I took a little of the cake, sauces, and ice cream and it was the perfect bite! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!   But service was a bit slow, our waitress came about twice to check up on us but when we were about to leave and asked for a box and bill she came back with the bill but forgot about the box. She only refill my bf water but not mine! I wonder why??? Service needs some work!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=340

The food was good, my friend and I did the 2 for $20 deal which worked out great. For our appetizer we had the Mozzarella sticks (which were really good!) and we both also got a cheeseburger. The burger was yummy, meat was cooked perfectly and had lots of flavor. Good meal at affordable price after tax and tip. However, the wait staff was incredibly slow. I'm not sure if our server was bad or if he just had a ton of tables. We had to wait forever for everything. Meanwhile, while our server was nowhere to be found, about 6 hosts were all standing around mingling. Perhaps they need to transition some of these guys to servers?

I even talked to the manager and all he said was ""next time tell a manager ahead of time so we can get you new waiter."" That's it. NO compensation or anything. UNPROFESSIONAL staff.

Four months into our tradition the manager told us the happy hour wasn't going down anymore and that they haven't been doing it for two months now. We asked to talk to the manager and he said they haven't done the happy hour for 3 months.... We tried to share the fact that we've been coming for four months and it must have been a more recent change and they wouldn't bug on that. ""We have signs posted everywhere.""

Brian F.,"Lakewood, CA",160,270,170,1.0,2/21/2010,"So here I am, chillin' at The Block, playing some video games at Dave & Busters.  All is going well.  Then D&B says they're closing.  It's 12:55am and we just take off.  While in the parking lot, we decide to head to TGIF and enjoy some late night dinner.   From experience, I perform the following: call the location and see if they are serving the full menu or just the bar menu - due to the time.  Lady says ""full menu"" and that they are still open.  So we go!  (It's like 700 feet around the parking lot.) Now, bear in mind we've got our minds set on some totally mediocre food (because God knows TGIF doesn't serve yum).  My friend walks in first, and immediately is told by some employee (server, host?) that they're closed.   The time is now 1:01am.  He walks out before I can walk in with sad puppy-dog eyes.  It made me sad.  Then I look at the door, and it says ""Open til 2am everyday"".  So, I walk back in and find no employees up front at all.  I track down the guy who told my friend the bad news, and we have a few words.   Me:  Did you just tell my friend you were closed? (200 people in the restaurant eating, bar packed) Him:  Yes (no eye contact - sweeping something up).  We called last call earlier for drinks and food. Me:  But your door says open until 2am daily, and the door was unlocked. Him:  We can close down whenever we want actually (says the non-manager guy sweeping the floors).  You and your friends can come in and relax but there's no more food and the bar is closed.  Me:  *#@(%ing whatever. Now, let's use some charts and graphs to demonstrate the drama.   1.   This TGIF is located in a PRIME spot on The Block property.  This is The Block.  It's not some mall in some city that nobody might have known about.  This is The Block - people from North Cali know about this place.   2.   How are you going to close shop at 1 am  when local businesses like D&B and AMC are still open?  The closest Denny's is a short trip, and Norms is like 11 miles away (a damn parsec).  Bad game plan by management, on a damn SATURDAY night - people from D&B were gravitating that way - with me leading the way. 3.   Multiple reviews here regarding crap customer service and miserable employees.  I get you wanna be in bed by 2am instead of 3:30am, but really?  You're getting paid to say hello at the door.  Make your mommy proud and friggin' do it right.   This place is blacklisted in my book on sheer merit alone.  Good job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=440

I asked our server if he thought it was burnt and his response was that he didn't know, so I had the food sent back. While waiting for my food to come and staring at my family eating, I munched on my sons french fries from his chicken tenders. A lady in a green shirt (maybe the manager) came up gave me the refired item, but didn't apologize for the iconvenience. All she said was fish and chips fries well done. I compared my sons fries to mine and saw a big difference in freshness. His fries look as limp and soggy as if it were sitting out too long. So I asked the server again, what is the difference between these 2 fries. He had the same reply stating that he doesn't know. It is obvious that the fries we got were not fries and I wanted my son to have fresh fries, so I gave him mine and waited for new ones. I hate to complain, but an apology would have been nice.

This review is based on their happy hour which is from 3-7 and then 10-close, kudos on the extended hours!  What I had: Ultimate Blue Raspberry Margarita - I got it blended, it wasn't too strong so the flavor was pretty on point. Can't say it got me anywhere close to a buzz not even after the beer I followed it up with. Potato Skins - these kind of tasted like they were frozen and just popped in the microwave. Boneless Buffalo Wings - not the best I have ever had, but not the worst. I will note that I did get one wing which had a lot of fat, completely ruined it. Sesame Jack Chicken Strips - I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor of these. I'm not much of a barbeque or teriyaki fan, but their sauce made the chicken strips worth while! Pot Stickers - decent little dumplings. My first time trying pot stickers so I really have no other experiences to compare them to. Wouldn't say they are my favorite, but they weren't half bad. I enjoyed the sauce they are served with. The food is extremely average at best and nothing more, but the prices are great!

Jaime C.,"Santa Ana, CA",2,9,3,1.0,7/1/2013,"I should have posted this a while ago..... Worst possible service ever @ TGI Friday's located at 3339 Entertainment Ave Orange CA 92868. We arrived approximately about 7 pm or so originally with a party of 9 to celebrate our nephews graduation. We were originally told that it would be a 45 min wait. During our wait some other friends from the same graduation arrived so we decided to all to sit together. So our wait extended from 45 minutes about an hour or so which was fine by us because we knew or party went from 9 to 18. About 8:45 a table becomes available  but it's located on the opposite side of the restaurant far away from where our graduating children were seated and the whole purpose of going to dinner was to celebrate together. Both my wide and sister-in-law asked to speak to a manager and they told her the waitress that sat our party said she would accommodate us on the same side as our children and instead of being considerate and providing excellent customer service she said we follow a rotating schedule and that's why you are being seated on this side of the restaurant. My wife and sister-in-law apologized for any confusion asked to if we can then be seated outside and Jessica (Manager on Duty ignored our apology and with an attitude said ""Yeah, I guess I can sit you outside"" as she rolled her eyes). Jessica - Manager displayed very poor customer service, poor communication and showed our entire party non-management like attitude and leadership skills to other staff and guest. The only honest to good thing that night was our waitress ""Erika"" who displayed way better customer service then the manager on duty. Things only got worse when we asked Erika to bring us our separate checks as we originally requested. Next thing you know; Jessica called Mall Security because we were supposedly loud and disruptive. This made some of us upset as Jessica was talking to Mall Security pointing her finger at our party. Some of our party went to try and communicate and defuse the situation (which you think would be coming from management). Next thing you know the police showed up which was totally unnecessary. Our entire party felt disrespected as TGIF customers. Again, this was by far the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant and will never step foot at this location again (TGI Friday's located at 3339 Entertainment Ave Orange CA 92868).

Anyhow it gets better my friends and I order we asked for a Jack Daniels burger medium well no tomatoes no onions due to food allergy to tomato Well it comes to us we cut it and the meat inside crumbs apart and is raw inside. I look around for our server to show her and she isn't around So I go to the hostess and ask them to get our server He said ok and goes away and doesn't even come back to say she will be right with you when he passes our table he says nothing. Our server comes to our table and asks How is everything She had no idea I had asked for her. I showed her the burger she saw that it was rare. She said she would get us another one. Well she brought back the same one and put onion and tomato WTF didn't we said their was food allergy to tomato anyhow she then comes back with the same burger again one half had the tomato and onion and the other half didn't. She then brought her manager we voiced our problem he told us that he was told we didnt want to wait and thats why they only put in on  the grill anyhow we finally just said to remake it They never said they wouldnt The check comes and yes they took the burger off the bill and also one of the appetizers which was great and we are still sitting there The server comes back with an attitude I asked her if I could ask her a question and she said sure I asked where our new burger was she stated Oh I thought you didnt want it anymore Totally bad bad customer service plus the manager whom was on duty was a little rude like it was our fault when you are paying for a service It should be to your liking since you are the one whom is paying RIGHT  I will never go back there again !!! :-(,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=400

The service was good, it was 3pm and the servers were there for each turn.  Usually in the evenings TGIF is crowded and rowdy.  Off-hours I must say it was a great dining experience.

I don't know if it was her fault or not, but she picks up menus and utensils and takes a look around the restaurant...scanning for open tables. Then, she goes, ""right this way,"" and walks up to a table up the stairs, towards the bar..then goes, ""oh..never mind,"" and walks us back to the front. walks us to another spot, *no luck, no seats,* goes back to the front. SERIOUSLY?!? i don't want a tour of the restaurant. don't you have some kind of chart of some sort that tells you what tables are empty, etc? not even a single apology from her. i know it's trivial, but her job is to seat people and she can't even do it properly.  so we're finally seated, and our server, thank God, was this really nice guy. he was all smiles, and polite. we ordered the cedar smoked salmon pasta, garlic chicken primavera, and a large glass of blue moon. i was unhappy with my garlic chicken. it was 80% sundried tomatoes and other crap. the sauce on the pasta was not good and tasted lemon-y. the salmon pasta was really sauce-y, but i love that! so i really liked the salmon pasta.  whenever i'm at tgifridays, i always want to try something new, but maybe i should just stick with my spinach dip and jack daniels plates..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=400

We ordered buffalo wings. Spinach dip, and baby back rib. I told them my brother is Neutropenic so he can't have raw vegetables on any of his food. Good thing I checked the order and noticed they mixed the raw veggies with his dinner. Sent it back. They fixed it. But when I brought the food to the hospital, I thought it was fixed but not the spinach dip still had raw vegetables garnished on top of the dip. So my brother couldn't eat that one. Called them, all I got was an apology . Second time my brother was admitted again, we ordered the same thing, again told them not to Mixed raw vegetables. Of course they did it again and had them fixed it . this time I doubled check . Third time my brother got hospitalized this time we ordered a side of fries and not realized fries was included with the meal. We retracted the order of fries but the waitress already rang us up. She said the sign the receipt and then she ll ring a new receipt. well the second receipt was more expensive and asked me to sign it, which of course I didn't sign because she never removed the order of fries and tries tells me some hogwash information that that's how they process the change of order. Not buying it and had manager re ring the whole thing and with a return receipt . This last one was just the worst. Called it in early, Angelica said it will be ready in 20miin. I waited before I go there so the food will be ready to go. We got there, she said she just handed it to the cook 5 min ago. Very disposing ben and she knows it. When it was time to pay she tells me my debit didn't swiped so she needed my iD. Why?? My brother end up paying. Hebwaithe waitress are clueless when it comes to take out. Does not pay attention and looks like they don't know what they are doing . Hence Angelica showed that.. they gave me the wrong order , you probably wonder why we come here? Because its closest to The hospital and our goal was to bring my brioche hot food but each time there's a problem and end up bringing my brother cold food. So this time we are done with tGIF.  We need a new place to go to give my brother good food beside the hospital food. We need a new place where food is tasty and so that he can't taste his medicine.

Ivette Navarro the manager and the waitress (I didn't get her name) treated me and my family very poorly to the point that they made my niece cry and called the cops on us because we supossively didn't order for them. Long story short there was 9 people in our party 5 of them were kids one was less than a year old and was sleeping the whole time the rest where under 12yrs old. So we ordered 7 orders of the endless apps and I ordered the cheeseburger sliders (which weren't on the endless apps) 8 orders in total. 7 endless appetizers, 5 for the kids 1 endless apps for an adult and a cheeseburger appetizer for me. My wife didn't even eat but she had a beverage. So everyone was accounted for Ivette Navarro the unprofessional manager said that we still had to order 2 extra endless appetizer because there was 9 in our party we told her there is only seven of us eating, the baby is asleep and my wife is not eating and I ordered an appetizer plate which is not included in the endless apps. But regardless 7 apps where ordered and gonna be payed for.  Ivette Navarro said that was unacceptable and everyone sitting down had to order and no sharing. I repeated to her everyone was accounted for and ordered for and she said that was unacceptable and if we don't order for the rest she would call the cops and eventually she did to the point that she made the kids cry and we had to leave. Other patrons told her that she was wrong for what she did and she didn't  care. Ivette Navarro should be fired because as a business owner I would never treat a paying customer like that.

Well, I guess that menu was popular, since we were told that they were out of almost every appetizer and dessert on the menu. Presentation on the food was terrible, limp cabbage leafs abound. I guess they really didn't feel the need to be too spectacular since we're not spending much, but still... Our entrees were good enough, the portion sizes were big enough to feed a whole family of 4, honestly. Come here expecting a lot of very cheap, greasy food. Expect nothing, and you will be pleased. PSA: The Jack Daniel's menu is bloody terrible. Stay away from it at all cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=520

Joseph C.,"Cerritos, CA",23,17,,2.0,7/28/2010,TGIF saddened me today.  This was my first time to the TGIF at the block and it wasn't a great experience.  We went in the middle of the day and it wasn't busy at all.  From the time we ordered our food to the time we actually got it felt like 30 minutes.  We never saw our server in between that time either and then once we got our food it took another 10 minutes for him 10 comeback and ask how we were and if we needed refills.  I like going to TGIF because they have some of the best prices on alcohol drinks whether it be during happy hour or not.  The only positive part of that TGIF was the server helping out one of my friends who was trying to get her turkey burger wrapped in lettuce instead of the bun.  Which he surprised us when he brought it out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=520

Frankie G.,"Tucson, AZ",305,8,5,3.0,8/2/2010,"So I went for the first time with my girlfriend. I have never been to a T.G.I. Friday before, so I didn't exactly know what to expect. As we checked in to reserve a table, we took a look at the menu while waiting. We had a few questions and the guys at the front didn't really answer any questions. And when I asked, ""When are your happy hours?"" The two welcomers replied bluntly ""It's not today."" I felt slightly attacked. As we were being escorted to be seated by one of the two welcomers I've encountered already, he tried to take my gf's menu out of her hands while she was still looking at it. For a first visit, I was disliking my experience. Luckily, our waitress was a lot more welcoming and honestly made me feel better about how this restaurant employs their people. Overall, their food was pretty good. We got the dinner for two for $20 deal. It filled us up and I feel it's one of the best deals if you're on a budget. I didn't think their sliders were the best. We didn't get the shrimp cocktail which we substituted for sliders because my gf is allergic. The pork chop wasn't amazing, but it was satisfying. And for dessert, we got the Oreo thing. I love Oreos, so my taste buds enjoyed it. In the end, I would consider going back.

Amber R.,"Anaheim, CA",1,8,,2.0,11/18/2012,"Ok, so after the four of us waited an hour outside to be seated, we then waited an extra 35 minutes for our food..... This whole time, i'm getting so hungry that at one point I considered eating my own feet..... Whilst waiting for the food, I noticed that everyone sat around us had their eyes glued to the tv's. It just so happened that we'd chosen to eat out on the night of a UFC fight.....which apparantly everyone in Orange had gone to TGI Friday's to watch.... So, the food comes and looks nice but ummmm, very minimal. I am not a big eater so there's ALWAYS food left on my plate but this time, I had finished and was looking under the table for scraps!! I mean come on, one small piece of chicken and three pieces of pasta pillows? Not cool!! The cleverly positioned sauce (spread all over the plate) didn't fool me into thinking there was more on the plate than there actually was, either! The ribs and steaks were apparantly good, but the tacos (which were not advertised as overly spicy) were in fact too spicy to eat and had to be shared among the more hardcore eaters at the table, resulting in one of us having nothing more than french fries and iced tea to consume. As if that's not bad enough, the whole place would erupt in screeches, shouts and profanity every 30 seconds because of the UFC thingy. I might have got a better deal by chewing on all the testosterone in the room.....it was ridiculous. None of us could hear ourselves talk and the staff just walked around like nothing was out of the ordinary. You may find this surprising, but some of us don't find the sight of two (almost) naked men rolling around on top of eachother, very interesting. Neither did I appreciate the people sat above me (we sat in the booth on the lower level so we had people directly at the side of us on the upper level) being able to look down and watch me eat, or inadvertently spit on my food each time they lunged forward at the tv's with animated punches, loud roars and bad language. Coupled with some of the women sat around pretending they knew what the fight was about and screaming whenever a punch was thrown, I was about ready to start throwing some punches myself!! The bill came to $90. I will NEVER go back there. Total waste of money, terrible atmosphere, sub-standard food.

I had good service from the harried bartender, who knew that everyone was trying to fill up prior to 7.  She never seemed more than patient, even with a patron who wanted a full description of many of the menu items.   I had a well tequila and flat-bread and a slider.  Slider was OK, nice and oniony.

James C.,"Philadelphia, PA",43,7,,3.0,8/22/2013,"I consider practically any Friday's good for what it is:  An acceptable place to grab something quick and easy, enjoy a couple drinks, and watch the game.  It's never going to be a five-star establishment, but you could do much, much worse.  However, I am writing this review to address a more profound issue. Reading these reviews, I've noticed that a lot of them like to go out of their way to give the names and physical descriptions of the employees serving them, after a negative experience.  While there is clearly nothing wrong with offering constructive criticism, I find it reprehensible to try to humiliate someone on this site just because they may have had a bad day on the job, or perhaps have not yet mastered it.  There is simply no need for it.  Criticism can be given without resorting to dragging someone's name through the mud.  It's low-class, and reeks of self-importance on the part of the reviewer.

We were really hungry at this point so we went ahead and ordered. appetizers pretzels were really salty and our food took way too long to get there. Our drinks didnt get refilled unless we ask for. Personally my food was horrible I order a hamburger and it looked like it was just thrown together the patty was broken into pieces  before I even started eating and had no taste, the French fries were really bad taste it old and salty we didn't get napkins we have to ask for them and the service it was just horrible I don't think I'm ever going to go there again... I understand if i got treated like i did it i was complaining but i was nice and didnt say anything at all.. Server did come by and asked how was my food and i said it wasnt that good..

Yuki M.,"Irvine, CA",40,1107,3954,3.0,11/18/2007,"3 people and 20 minutes = 1 wheat hamburger bun. I've come here a few times lately for lunch with co-workers and I always wonder if there is anything remotely healthy on this menu. I let my friend order for me and he gets me the Asian Chicken something or other. I stare at him and say, ""What's that supposed to mean?"" He's a huge German albino so it was funny. At any rate, I've tried various items on the Friday's menus throughout the years and so far, it's all been mediocre. It's not bad, but it's not all that great either. The food is on par with what you would expect from a step above Denny's. *shrug* It'll do in a pinch. I won't list off all the things I've tried because that would take forever, but generally speaking, Friday's across the board are good enough for what you're looking for. Just don't expect anything stellar. This particular location is cramped...though I'm not too sure if that's the theme/goal of every Friday's. I can't remember what the other ones looked like. The service is DREADFUL and very slow. Again, I can't remember if this is applicable to all locations. Drinks don't get refilled. Slow service. Clueless servers who can't figure out if they have wheat bread. No attention given after order is brought to the table.  Overall, 3/5 because it's a C. No more. No less.  And I don't drink anymore and have never drank at a Friday's so I can't really review the bar aside from it being elevated in the middle of the regular seating which is, in my opinion, horrible because no matter where you are, you're exposed to the drunken masses. I for one would imagine that a choice is given in seating so as to present the option of bar or non-bar atmosphere, but if the alcohol is smack in the middle of everything, then what's the point of having regular tables? I don't get it. Maybe it's because it's in the Block. *shrug* Regardless of my whining, I'll most likely come here again multiple times because it's so close to my work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=460

Melissa A.,"San Clemente, CA",1,15,,4.0,3/9/2013,"This review is based on their Happy Hour. As someone who savors a deal, TGI Friday's has an awesome happy hour that's worth checking out. With menu items starting at $1.50 for a cheeseburger slider or a plate of fries to $3.50 20 oz domestic beers and half off appetizers, it's easy to have a great meal for cheap here. While the food is great, this establishment is only getting 4 stars due to service. I've been here multiple times for happy hour and have the same setbacks each time. First off, this specific Fridays gets crowded during happy hour which is great for them, but depending on where you sit you can have ok to horrible service. Sitting at the bar is ideal for efficient service, but if you sit on the tables surrounding the bar, expect to wait at least a half an hour for someone to hand you a menu.  Today I went again with the boyfriend and we waited almost 20 minutes to be given a menu, followed by another 15 minutes for them to take our order, 20 minutes to be given the wrong food, and over an hour to be given the check after having to literally tap an Asian employee on the shoulder to get his attention. If you're coming for 3-7pm happy hour, plan on getting here at 3 pm and not leaving until after 5 due to service.  My only other bone to pick is they don't cut off patrons who have had too much to drink. I can't speak for all bartenders as I have never noticed other guests being rowdy, but tonight there was a group of three guys who left their seats and decided to stand right in front of our table (literally touching our table) and being loud, spilling their beer every now and then, and making sexist comments. They got to the point where one of them lost his balance and had to gain his composure by holding on to the back of my stool chair that I was sitting on. He apologized and it really didn't bother me, but what did, was that a bartender saw this, and still gave him at least one other round after that. There were a few female customers they were talking to that seemed bothered by them but the employees didn't do anything about it or cut them off. In the future, I can see as a customer how it's hard not getting the most out of the $3 beers and $5 long island iced teas, but as the company, learn to cut off guests when they're extremely intoxicated and bothering other patrons while not in their seats. The experience here should be positive for all guests, not just the drunk ones.  Overall, great location, easy and convenient parking, and an extensive and tasty menu. Be mindful of where you sit during happy hour, and allow yourself plenty of time to enjoy the cheap food & drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=460

John I.,"Irvine, CA",130,123,236,1.0,7/27/2011,"Strongly recommend *against* TGIFridays. Here is a copy of a letter I wrote to them awhile back:  ""I am writing regarding a terrible experience that I had at T.G.I. Fridays, which reflected the lowest level of customer service, and a blatant violation of T.G.I. Friday's own ""call-ahead"" policy.  On September 21, I called Dave & Busters, ESPNZone and T.G.I. Fridays to find out if they accept reservations for a birthday event to occur on September 22. Dave & Busters and ESPNZone admitted that they do not accept reservations. The only reason that I stopped calling restaurants and selected T.G.I. Fridays was because T.G.I. Fridays allegedly accepted ""call-ahead"" reservations. I specifically asked at what time the next day (September 22) I should call-ahead to ensure my reservation would be fulfilled. I was advised that I should call-ahead at 5:00 p.m. for an 8:00 p.m. party of ten (10). On September 22, I called-ahead at 5:00 p.m. for an 8:00 p.m. party of ten (10). When I made my call-ahead reservation, I was specifically told that my table would be given away if at least half of my party (i.e., five people) was not there by fifteen (15) minutes after my reservation time. Playing by T.G.I. Friday's own rules, I knew that, if I did not have at least five (5) people at the restaurant by 8:15 p.m., I risked losing my table. Fair enough.  At 8:00 p.m., I had nine (9) people at the restaurant. I advised the Hostess of my name, that I had called-ahead for an 8:00 reservation, and that I had nearly my entire party present. She told me that they had no table available for me and that the wait was forty (40) minutes. I heard her then tell a party of six who had just arrived that the wait was twenty minutes. This meant that I was as poorly-off (or even worse-off) than if I had not called-ahead at-all!  I said ""excuse me, but I called-ahead at 5:00."" The Hostess had the nerve to say to  me: ""we can't hold a table open from 5:00."" I was shocked by such an offensive (and idiotic) statement. I replied, ""but you can hold a table open from 7:30, right?"" She had no answer. She did say that we would have priority once a large table did open-up since there were no other parties who had called-ahead. As noted below, we were not even given priority for the next large table.   In fact, my party was not seated until an hour and ten minutes later. Furthermore, my party was seated after a similarly-sized party which had not called-ahead (""Molly's"" party). When I asked why a similarly sized party which had not called-ahead was being seated ahead of us, I was told that it was because ""they were here first."" Unbelievable.  I was gravely embarrassed because a large group of my friends had to wait over an hour for a table, despite the fact that I had told them that I selected T.G.I. Fridays because of their call-ahead policy.   I frequently put-together events, as do my friends. Furthermore, I frequently go out to eat after social functions, including theatrical productions, with large groups of people, including the casts. You are no doubt aware that your competition includes BJ's Pizza, California Pizza Kitchen, Dave & Busters, Gordon Biersch, McCormick & Schmicks, Applebee's, Chili's, Outback Steakhouse, and Lonestar Steakhouse, some of which do take reservations (and take them seriously).  Please be advised that I will not be returning to T.G.I. Fridays, when there are plenty of other restaurants that understand the importance of good customer service, and that are actually desirous of having return customers. Please be further advised that over thirty of my friends are being ""carbon copied"" on this letter and I am posting it on my Internet blog so that everyone may learn about the poor customer service they can expect at T.G.I. Fridays.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=460

Well the food, i have ordered a New York Cheese and Bacon Burger which was newly added to the menu. It was a 5 to 10 minute wait but the food is so great you should wait an hour but i dont think that would be nessecary. I got a huge burger with some fries. It was delicious on my part. I got a drink and everytime i would finish it a staff kindly looked at it and asked me if i would like a refill. Well yes the food is great there but the restroom was not. I went in there and was not happy when i saw a toilet with its seat ripped out and wet toilet paper on it.

As the waitress was clearing the appetizer dishes she spilled marinara sauce all over the floor and all over 4 of us. She brought extra napkins and club soda which helped get the sauce out of our clothes. Hopefully it won't stain my new jeans that I was wearing.  My hubby and friend ordered the flight of beers. As my hubby was finishing his beer we noticed that his glass was cracked from top to bottom. The waitress was horrified and offered him a free dessert.

Blue Moon beer. Let's just say that the Blue Moon was the highlight of the meal! The salmon was dry and the pasta didn't have much sauce at all. For $9.99, I probably shouldn't have expected anything better. I definitely wouldn't order it again. The service was good though ;-) My co-workers all ordered the Jack Burger and loved it (all 3 of them). You can sub the fries for a caesar salad for a more healthy route. The fries are good though, so if you want the happy route - go with the fries! For birthdays they bring out a small bowl of vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup and whipped cream, throw a couple of candles in there, and sing the fastest bday song I've ever heard. If you are looking for a nice presentation on a birthday, avoid this place. However, if you're just having fun and excited to get a free dessert, I recommend getting a shot of Jager on the side.

Maybe I'm naive and simple-minded, but I genuinely tried TGI Friday's simply because of the 3 course menu commercials. I'm a sucker for deals and choosing things myself. So after some persuasion, I convinced my boyfriend that TGI Friday's would be delicious. But it was really a hit-or-miss for me. The value of the 3 courses was great as it was$13/each for two appetizers, two entrees and two desserts.  The good: -Cinnabon Cheesecake. I should've convinced my boyfriend to order this one too so I could somehow con him out of his share. Can't go wrong with cheesecake and the cinnamon-y-ness is great.  The okay: -Oreo chocolate cake. It was a little dry. Like I said, we should've gotten 2 cheesecakes. -Crispy fried green beans. Too much in one order considering it's technically an appetizer for one, but it was pretty okay. It was overwhelming after a while. The bad: -Fried mac & cheese. I'm sorry but this doesn't work for me. It was a little dry and the cheese was more stiff rubbery than creamy. We each ate 1/2 piece and left the rest. Too bad because they give you a lot of this too. -Sizzling Chicken and Cheese. Too much cheese. I like cheese but way too much. The mashed potatoes were good but also covered with cheese. -Bruschetta pasta. Meh. It just didn't taste right. I can't point out the obvious badness, but it's just all over not tasty. Service was rather poor and non-existent. I've had phenomenol service at a Friday's before, but it wasn't this one. The food took a loooong time to arrive, or maybe I was just hungry? I never saw our waitress. Maybe it's because the tip would be higher at a table of 4 or more with all steaks/ribs/shrimp unlike our table of 2 with 2 special menu orders?

Got to the bar and our bartenders soo and Kevin got us ready with our drinks and took our dinner orders. 25 minutes later the food comes out, warm, a bit dry, and salty (ordered an appetizer sampler, half rack ribs, and a popcorn chicken thing). On top of that, the bartenders left the bar 10 minutes at a time and left the bar completely unattended. Mind you this is a Tuesday night and there were about 8 others by the bar besides us 3. Last thing that bugged me was how they didn't give me my half off appetizers when the deal was for half off by the bar. Let me save you a headache and tell you to pass on this one. Only positive here is the hostess who greeted us happily and accommodated us when it wasn't her position to do so when our server was missing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=240
Yah T.,"San Marino, CA",8,78,99,1.0,8/9/2015,"Came in for dinner with the family. While waiting to be seated my son asked to go to the restroom. The moment we walked in he slipped and bumped his head on the floor. There was water everywhere on the floor as the sink is right in front of the entrance. I immediately went outside and notified the 1st employee I seen. She didn't apologize and just said thanks for letting me know, I'll have someone go check It out. I then tell the two of the ladies in the front, all they said was we are sorry, we will let someone know. Not even an is he ok, would you like an ice pack, no incident report. Talk about poor customer service. Also while you are waiting all the cigarette smoke comes in to the eating area as the smoking patio is right next to the front door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=240

David S.,"Brea, CA",0,3,,1.0,4/5/2016,Walked in for 2 minutes and left. The hostess with the Afro hair was rude. We sat down for a minute but the place smelt like they had mopped it with the same mop bucket water from last week.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=240
Alex L.,"Anaheim, CA",260,300,156,2.0,2/15/2014,"Pluses: This is a TGI Fridays. If you're familiar with their food and drinks, that's a plus in and of itself. If you're going to be liquoring it up, get something with the words ""Ultimate"" on it. The size is supposed to get you tipsy, and they normally don't skimp on the alcohol. I used to get the Ultimate Mudslide, but alas, they don't serve it anymore. You can never go wrong with the burgers. Just make sure you make a fuss that they're cooked the way you like them. The Jack Daniels menu is always decent. Minuses: ---sigh Where do I begin? Instead of going into a treatise about the slow decline of the Great American Restaurant chains, allow me to present my pieces of evidence to illustrate the decline: * the slow service, it was hard to find for us to find people even though it was 1PM and there wasn't a lunch crowd on a Monday. * the lackluster food. The thing that me and Maureen C. actually liked was the appetizer, in this case, the flatbread. Everything else was forgettable. Verdict: Go into the Block or whatever they call this place now, and eat in there. You will save money, and you will be more satisfied. If you're willing to take a gamble and be disappointed, this is the place for you. We took that gamble, and lost. We're just glad that the food wasn't bad. Sad to say, it wasn't good either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=240
Steve M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",144,220,126,2.0,10/15/2012,Usually I know exactly what to expect when I go to T.G.I. Fridays. I usually wouldn't review it. Or I would write about 2 sentences about the staff being nice.  First our service was terrible very slow and no refills. When our food came out it was gross. I ordered soup and I hit a cold spot on my second bite. Everything came out gross and these are things I have ordered before. This location needs to raise their standards. I will never eat at this location again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orange-4?start=240
