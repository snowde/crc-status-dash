Jose A. R.,"Orlando, FL",252,166,311,3.0,1/14/2018,"It's been years since I've been to a TGI Fridays and for obvious reasons, right? Well, they've added a new vegan burger option to their menu and I decided that I would go give it a try and increase the demand for it! Hashtag make veganism mainstream. We walked in and were greeted and seated immediately so that's a plus. Our server took a bit to get to us, which I would understand if the place was busy, however, that wasn't the case. He also wasn't very friendly or attentive. I'm assuming we were his last table before his shift was over. Either way not the best service but not the worst either. Now, the food! As far as the burger goes, it was good. I really liked that it had somewhat of a smoky flavor and seasoned very well, however, it was dry. Now I expected this to be the case since there's no cheese or Friday's sauce on it, but it was like they overcooked the patty as well. I was expecting more! Maybe top it with guac or something else to make it not so dry. Overall, my experience was OK nothing out of the ordinary and the food wasn't terrible but I was expecting better. The patty is tasty, for sure, but they need to find a way to serve it better. I can't see myself craving it again. I would've given the place 2 stars but I really like the addition of vegan options at non-vegan restaurants so thanks for that TGI!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14
Christopher W.,"Orlando, FL",101,105,17,2.0,1/13/2018,"I disliked everything about this dinner. From the inattentive server to how long it took to get our food to the quality of our meal.  We came to try the new beyond meat vegan burger. The party itself was tasty but the bun it was served on was burnt. I got literally 9 French fries and they didn't even put the sauce (that comes with) on my burger. So it was dry and bland, save for the taste of burnt toast.  I won't be coming back any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14
Doug F.,"Orlando, FL",43,1,,1.0,11/4/2017,"Waited 20 mins before server came to take drink order, 930 on a Saturday and neither the bar or restaurant was crowded. Server came and took drink order, returned with drinks, and then disappeared for another 30 minutes before coming back to take our order and bring refills. We were getting ready to walk out, but since we were hungry decided to stay. The service has gone way down here and we will not be returning to this Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14
Mayra A.,"Kissimmee, FL",1,25,23,1.0,1/1/2018,"Not sure what happened to this place, it just keeps getting worse. My last visit ate the cake and I won't be back here. Their endless appetizers went up in price $15 with less to choose from. Now their choices were: mozzarella cheese sticks, potato skins, pot stickers, meat balls, and boneless wings. Not much to choose from anymore. Our server took one round order and left (everyone chose boneless wings), someone else brought them out, and they were cold. We ate that and sat and waited like 5+ minutes for her to come back to take the next order, I informed her that the food was cold and her response was "" do you want a fresh batch on your next order"". Uuummmm I assume that every batch should be fresh!!!!!! So round two came out by someone else and my son was trying to put in an order with them so we didn't have to wait again and he said he couldn't that he will call the server. The place was empty which was surprising because it was a Saturday night and games were going on. But now I understand why, this place has gone to the dumps. The food selection fail, food was cold, service was horrible, and prices went up. I would understand if more options were available for the prices to rise but not if you have some horrible options to choose from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14
Melanie F.,"Orlando, FL",58,34,19,2.0,11/12/2017,The place was empty on a Sunday afternoon so I was expecting the service to be at least average.

Chuck B.,"Valrico, FL",43,41,,1.0,12/7/2017,"Walked in at 12:30pm. There was no lunch crowd. There were 12 people in the restaurant. It felt like something out of a Quintin Tarantino movie, complete with a mirror ball. The soup & salad were very good. The waitress handed us the bill before we got our sandwich. The waitress was slow with refills of our drinks. No wonder the chain is going broke. Won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14
Alex R.,"Celebration, FL",582,227,1073,4.0,2/19/2017,"I  have to say that the bartender this morning was flat out amazing. She was the sweetest. She had a cute Boston accent that's for sure. She was attentive with us even with a steady stream of people coming through. She took out order conversed with us and just made us feel at home. I hadn't been to a Friday's in sometime. We got some appetizers, cheese sticks, pot stickers, potatoes wedges, and wings to share and it was all excellent. I had the burger and it was cooked just right except the bottom of the bun fell apart pretty quick. Overall it was a good lunch with my sis and mom. The food was good but the service really put it over the top for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14
Othoniel A.,"Orlando, FL",30,39,79,1.0,4/2/2017,Probably the worst meal I've had in 2017. That's what I get for ordering a Ribeye at a Bar. They should just stick to appetizers and drinks. Money well waisted. Baaaaaaaadddddddd!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14
Brian K.,"Sarasota, FL",24,19,9,1.0,3/25/2017,"We stopped in for late-night endless apps. Went to restroom to freshen up and wash my hands. The bathroom was worse than a gas station. There was more fluids all over the bathroom than I have seen. Understand that it was 10:20 on a Saturday night,  but to be given a choice of a 10 to 15 minute wait for the dining room, or open seating at the bar,  was a bit disappointing as the bar was slammed,  and the dining room was almost empty.  Didn't want to mention the issues tho the manager, for the usual retaliation from the kitchen staff. To add,the music in bar was louder than most Dance Clubs. Not up to TGI Friday's standards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14
Jose L.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,3,3,1.0,6/4/2017,"Let me start with the restaurant was not busy so the quality of service should have been a 10, but was far from it. Friday June 2nd around 3pm my family and I order the 3 appetizer thing (Jack Daniel's chicken, mozzarella, and potato wedges), some kids meal, my wife's meal and I also ordered the big burger with wings on top (medium well, no pickles and a side of ranch). The food appetizer came and a 3rd of it was cold. When I brought it to her attention she kinda questioned it. 5 minutes later I was brought 6 tiny DRY chicken bites to replace them. Later I received sandwich with pickles (not a big deal), almost rare (didn't notice till 2 bites). So they sent it back and while I waited I ate the fries that were stale (No ranch served) and the 2 wings (dried out and obviously old). She returns 15 minutes later now that my family is almost done with a sandwich that is correct and AGAIN no ranch (I asked at least 4 times).  No manager apology for the error nor a credit (I did not ask), he was to busy playing around with the hostess. I even tipped the waitress even though the kitchen was the main issue it would not affect them not to tip. ***At 4am I woke up uncontrollably puking with diarrhea. This totally ruined our family vacation to Disney and Seaworld because we had to return home later that day. It's a extremely rare occasion for our Family to go on vacation and this is something we'll never forget.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14
John C.,"Concord, NC",144,111,434,3.0,10/8/2016,The food is always good. The only thing that differentiates this place is thar the customer service was not up to par. The food was delayed and very few customers waiting.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14
Juvenal N.,"Kissimmee, FL",91,2,,1.0,2/20/2017,"My wife and I decide to go out tonight to visit this Fridays location in hopes of getting the endless apps and some more good food. Sadly that was not the case.  To start things off we arrived to find a sign in front of the dining side only displaying the happy hour specials nothing to inform us that the dining side was closed and that it was open sitting in the bar area. We had to wait a couple of minutes to get greeted by the hostess who told us we can pick out own seats but she did not bring any menus or utensils with her even less she didn't even follow us to see where we decided to sit to bring the main items (menu, napkins, knife and fork you know the essentials to not eat like an animal).  We found a hight top near the back of the bar by the bar side server station. The table at first glance seemed still wet from being whipped clean but we were wrong it was wet from previous glasses sweating in the same spot and marks all around the table top. We kept waiting for someone to come greet us or at least drop some menus. But no one ever did. They did have other tables with people and patrons at the bar but they were not at all slammed. It is Monday night and the wait time made it seem like if it was a Saturday night with a big game on the TV. They had two bar tenders four servers on the floor the hostess, the food runner and the manager and nobody thought to greet us.  The manager was at the bar server station and passed by us more than twice and didn't even look. The server station had a bunch of empty dirty plates some even had food still on them all out in plane sight. One server rushed by us and said something to us which we could not understand because she mumbled it and it sure as hell was not I'll be right with you because she went to two tables after wards and did not return. It has been almost 15 minutes since we say and all no service.  My wife and I decided that with that service endless apps would be horrible and we decided to go to the ale house down the street which never disappoints.  On the way out the hostess saw us walking out and asked if we were leaving because we didn't find a place to sit (I wanted to tell her no I couldn't find a table so I stood around for almost 15 min looking like am idiot). I informed her all that was wrong and she said sorry we are short handed and busy. My wife is a server who knows what sort handed and busy is and that was not it again they had 2 bar tenders 4 servers food runner hostess and manager.  I told her I wanted endless apps but not if it was going to take forever to arrive.  To which she replied would you like to come back tomorrow?  Hell no I don't wonna come back tomorrow!    So now we are at ale house enjoying some great food with excellent service!  Thank you ale house!  Can I rate this Fridays negative stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14
Jackie V.,"Ocoee, FL",1,14,2,2.0,7/10/2017,"The customer service here needs some serious work. We had to ask for utensils, plates, and napkins. Our food took a while and I would not have minded if it was good food. My niece and I ordered the same thing the BBQ chicken flatbread. However my flatbread had no BBQ sauce on it.

Russ W.,"Orlando, FL",141,24,10,1.0,7/26/2016,"Ok. Have been to this location over the past 5 years and vowed to never return, but we received a gift card. Ok.  So we thought, Let's check it out and see how much improvement has been made.  Here's the evening: Hostess took a little extra time seating us and mispronounced the word entree.  Yes she did.  She also called us sweetie.  Really? Server clocked in at 9 minutes to greet us and take a drink order.  There were 6 tables with people at them and 3 already had food. (Not slammed). No one had her back and 4 other servers were equally inattentive until I got up to find a manager.  It was at this time that a young man came over to explain why the service was so poor (management needs to address this as customers are on a need to know basis and we DON'T need to know about the inner workings of the restaurant). Might should have gone something like this ""Welcome to Friday's, So and so will be right with you, may I please go ahead and take your drink order?""   Drinks arrived but without 2 of the 4 drinks requested. Those arrived 11 minutes later when Nico stepped in to check on us.  (Nico is not our server) My Blue Moon tastes like the lines need to be cleaned a little bit and Nico offered us some chips while we waited and they came out before the appetizer we ordered which, by the way, was 2 pretzels and a shallow cheese cup for $7.60.  Wow (Globals) Corporate prices have gone through the roof!!  The Jack Daniels NY Strip comes in at $22.40!  Chili's top steak comes in at $18.99 and a 14oz strip from Outback comes in at $23.99. (They don't print what oz cut in the Friday's menu btw.) Manager came by during the long wait for the entrees and she was great.  Thanked us for the feedback and was gracious all around.   (Waiting on entrees.....). 19 minutes.   The strawberry fields salad was very tasty and the chicken/shrimp Cajun pasta tasted ok but was served in a super-shallow plate making the ounces much less than say Applebee's or BJ's Brewhouse. No to-go boxes coming out of Friday's for us tonite!   Will have difficulty finding our way back. Please no more gift cards.  Felt like training Tuesday all around and no offers to take anything off the bill were made despite the multiple apologies from 2 servers and the manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14

Louise S.,"Kissimmee, Orlando, FL",344,557,2626,4.0,8/27/2015,"Went for a late lunch early dinner on Sunday, with the daughter and hubby. She came home to surprise us after her first full week away at college. (She had laundry). It was empty when we arrived. we were greeted as soon as we opened the door. Our waitress come up to the table as soon as we were seated asking for our drink orders. Water for the hubby, lemonade for the daughter and the only way to have ice tea sweet with lime thanks to Mike. (I know his is unsweet). They were never empty. We got the chips and salsa free since I am a rewards member. Had a buy one get one entree coupon which is always useful. Both my daughter and I had the sirloin medium rare with mash potatoes. She had mac and cheese and I had spinach. All the sides were yummo! My husband who is a vegan just had some sides and a salad. My daughter's steak was perfection. Mine on the other side was over cooked. Our wonderful waitress noticed it after my second bite and asked if I wanted a new one cooked. I didn't at that point because my daughter actually needed to get back to school. It wasn't bad the taste, it was good just overcooked. She took it upon myself to send over the manager who also offered to recook it. Again, I was fine not getting a new one and was just happy they realized the mistake. A free slice of dessert would have been nice though. I would of course go back if just for the great customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14

My boyfriend and I had somewhere to be so after FOURTY minutes without getting our food I told our waitress to please just box up our food. She told me they were out of two go boxes but they will figure something out. Twenty minutes go by. I asked our waitress how much longer and she says one minute.

We both had the beer cheese burger with fresh jalapenos, fried jalapenos, and guacamole. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. The bun on mine could have been a little more fresh and I'm pretty sure they use frozen and not fresh burger meat, I would still probably order it again.

Alyssa B.,"Orlando, FL",20,3,,1.0,6/29/2017,"From the minute I walked in the door I was not impressed with this restaurant. It started with the hostess who appeared clueless. We called ahead and had a reservation for 14.. after waiting for a table for 10 minutes we were seated at a table for 10 people..again we are FOURTEEN! We all stood around the table staring aimlessly when finally after minutes past she asked if we wanted another table. We then moved our table. The restaurant was not busy and the service was TERRIBLE. I'm 22 and ordered a alcoholic drink. I forgot my ID so they understandably could not serve me. Instead of telling me that she would not be bringing my drink the server walked away and did not ask if I wanted something else to drink.. leaving me drink- less. I eventually ordered a water that took 20 minutes to arrive at my table. We ordered  an appetizers where 4 out of 5 plates were filthy. Bianca our server has a terrible attitude, did not introduce herself and was rude during every encounter we have had with her. She took our orders while sitting in a seat at our table. We are not friends....  after 40 minutes of waiting our meals finally came out. I ordered a steak medium... it came out rare and I had to send it back. I got it back a second time where it was still far too red. At that point I was done waiting and wasting my time  and asked for it to be taken off the bill. My sides, mashed potatoes and broccoli both were cold. Two other meals were sent back because they were cold and a salad was forgotten about and served to my friend 15 minutes later than everyone else...

I really don't know what is happening with this place but I don't plan on ever going back....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14?start=20
Mariangeli V.,"Orlando, FL",30,4,,2.0,4/17/2015,"It took me 22 years to go to aT.G.I Friday's for a second time only to be utterly disappointed. It was my son's birthday and he had been asking to go. So I thought this was a good time to go and give it another try.    Our food took so long to get to our table that the fries were limp and cold. I had asked for mushrooms in my burger and never got them. In fact no condiments were added and I had asked for all of them and a side of ranch that the server seemed to keep forgetting. My husband ordered the chicken and shrimp plate and the shrimp was really hard which means over cooked.   The coleslaw was dangerously warm. We asked to have our bill split which seemed to take forever. And our server never noticed that we had hardly touched our food.   After catching the manager's eye, we explained our situation and she apologized and cut our bill in half.  See you in 2037 T.G.I.F!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14?start=20

Chuck W.,"Racine, WI",0,8,,2.0,8/14/2015,"My family and some friends from church went here on Sunday 8/9/2015 about noon. The place was pretty much a ghost town except for the staff. Our party was 11 which included 2 children under 4 years old. The server was okay but the kitchen was slowwwwwww. As I said at the beginning, we arrived right before noon and we left about 1:45 pm! About 45 minutes into our experience I finally asked for the manager's attention. I wanted to know why it was taking so long for our entrees to get to the tables. He checked into the situation and his response was that TGI Fridays system in the kitchen only allowed the cooks to see the appetizers on the POS system. Once those were cooked and delivered to the table, then the entrees could be viewed by the cooks. How crazy is this? Especially since we had 2  young children! Once the food did come out, the server placed the someone else's salad (Caesar) in front of my wife and tried to convince her it was what she ordered (Chicken Cobb). The manager quickly came up from behind her and apologized and replaced it with the correct salad. Once we had all of our food and it was accurate, it was tasty. The manager did comp us for one of the appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14?start=20

Briana W.,"Orlando, FL",60,1,1,1.0,11/5/2015,"After spending all day at Disney we were starving and ready to eat. It was about 7:30 on a Wednesday, so it wasn't busy at all. Our server finally cam to our table, he was so fast that if my boyfriend hadn't stopped him he would have already walked away without our app order. After waiting for a good 15 min on nachos the plate came out. What a sad excuse for a nacho that has ever been seen on earth. Hard taco shells cut it half with refried beans and I guess you could say there was beef on there, with shredded cheese that was microwaved on. I could have made better nachos out of dog food. Thankfully our entrées came out right after we finished our food, but I think that's because it had been sitting in the window in the kitchen the entire time. I asked for my burger to be pink in the middle, it was well done. And cold. And  fries tasted like they were from this morning. What really cracked me up was when our server placed the dessert menu on our table and said ""just in case"". Ha. This place needs a whole new staff, especially in the kitchen. What a joke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14?start=20
Andrea H.,"Orlando, FL",10,82,2,1.0,9/19/2015,"I have been here 3 times and each time was a disaster. From the food being cold and not coming to our table correct to the most awful service ever. Consistently, each time the experience was horrible. I won't be back because they cannot seem to fix the problems they have with service and kitchen staff. The only bright spot is usually the appetizers taste good and are not messed up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14?start=20
Carol T.,"Denver, CO",52,150,178,2.0,4/12/2014,"My Mom wanted to go here and I was good with that. Cameron was a polite and attentive host. He is gracious and was considerate of my elderly Mom's need to sit near the door due to her frail walking status. The waitress was completely opposite. Erica failed to notice we were seated next to her other table that she also had not waited on. She commented impolitely to Cameron ""don't tell me how to do my job."" All Audible to diners as it was post lunch crowd.  When she came to the table next to us for taking their food order, she finally said she would be right there. then proceeded to take order & walk by our table again headed to the back. when she did come to take an order for drinks she didn't seem to know what was on draft. She carded me for my age when I ordered a cocktail (no biggie) but since I am 49 and my mom is 77, I hardly think my husband needed to be id'd when he got back to the table. I am no cougar out with a man 30 years younger. He had to go retrieve it from the car b4 he could order. And yet it was my drink she failed to retrieve from the bar. At least the bartender was prompt. The Thai pork tacos were delicious and less than 300 calories - Perfect for a lighter fare. My Mom enjoyed the Jack Daniel's chicken sandwich. Chicken tenders were good but the fries seemed too old to enjoy.   Waitress removed my silverware and plate a minute after I finished and didn't bother to ask but simply reached over and took it all. Why be a waitress if you are unconcerned with the experience you create for your guests? Really have to wonder how she is  when it is BUSY. Maybe she needs someone to show her how to do a service oriented job with courtesy and a more positive attitude to make people want to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14?start=20
Doug W.,"Orlando, FL",1,21,,1.0,10/26/2013,"By far the WORST TGIF I have ever been to; but that's typical of all the chain restaurants in Hunter's Creek. My wife and I used to live literally 2 mins away. We would usually order salads and sometimes a French onion soup. The soup always took 10 minutes to bring out and was never anything even bordering on hot. It's pre-made, how long does it take to spoon into a bowl?   Our salads were also never right and they were simple chicken cobb salads. They also took a baffling amount of time, 35-40 minutes, and the restaurant wouldn't even be busy. After 5 or 6 tries, and only because the place was so convenient, we finally gave up and never went back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14?start=20

Fortunately the bar area was not crowded, we all had a great time laughing and experimenting with trendy shot combinations and cocktails. The food at this location is consistently good. We were able to pick at an array of unlimited appetizers for only $12. There was also a $3 martini special that evening. Tasty, affordable, and fun!

Arynn I.,"Mililani, HI",292,416,217,5.0,3/25/2010,"A co-worker and I went here after work for dinner the other night. Being a Tuesday around 7:30pm it wasn't very busy and we were seated right away.  I was glad for the 12.99 3 course meal (previously eaten at another Fridays) but I tried a different dish. Our server, Daniel was great, attested by the other servers in the area who were saying ""he's the best.""  He made our visit an enjoyable one, never letting us run out of drink and all the food came out at a reasonable time.  He gave us enough time to enjoy our appetizers, spinach dip and mozzarella sticks but we didn't sit waiting for the meal. This visit I bought the 6 oz sirloin with sweet potato fries and substituted mandarin oranges instead of a vegetable side.  The sirloin was cooked to a nice medium with a very yummy sauce. I usually would use A-1 Steak sauce but I didn't even ask for it.  I scooted my fries off the plate, so as not to get soaked in the sauce (i have this thing about food touching). The dessert I got was the same as the other night, Vanilla bean Cheesecake.  This cheesecake was NOT FROZEN!  So I ate most of it and took home a small bit.  The only disappointment was that the restaurant had run out of Strawberries for the cheesecake.  :(  I told Daniel to go to Publix to get some, all in good fun though. Still, this was a great experience for me and we even got to witness the staff sing happy birthday to a little boy at another table. It was very enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-14?start=20
