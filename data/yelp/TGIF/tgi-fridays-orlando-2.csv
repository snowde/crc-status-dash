Lisa E.,"Orlando, FL",78,29,39,3.0,4/22/2013,"I've eaten at a few TGI's before and they've always had decent food. I ate at the location on I-Drive a few weeks ago and just ordered a Mudslide. Tasted mostly like a milkshake, which I had no complaints about, so I liked it even though it was super pricey (something I expected though). Our server was a nice guy - friendly and attentive. For being a chain restaurant on touristy I-Drive, it was a good experience. I definitely like going to TGI Fridays better than going to some other chain restaurants, although there are much better local places to go for a good meal at similar prices (Teak Neighborhood Grill comes to mind - about 10 minutes away with fantastic burgers).  If you have a picky party or are limited in choice for some other reason, you could do a lot worse. Maybe not somewhere to go out of the way for, but it's enjoyable nonetheless. =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-2
Karleigh M.,"FL, FL",53,2,,1.0,8/18/2017,"This is most definitely the worst TGI Friday's I have ever been to. The service was not good, we did not receive what we ordered, and along with that the food made us sick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-2
Mo A.,"Washington, DC",3757,414,2038,3.0,1/13/2012,"I'm gonna disclose and say that generally speaking I don't like TGI Fridays.  So much so that I'm offended that their company name incorporates a day of the week that brings so many people happiness and relief.  I've also contemplated filing a lawuit seeking that they change their name to TGI Monday....which in my humble opinion is probably more fitting given their lame food and horrible service.   Annnyyyywayyyyyyys, that brings me to this location.  Guess what?  I actually like it!  Yes, the food sucks but that's a franchise pattern.  The difference is it's a huge place that offers friendly service and......they actually have a game room!  A place where I can actually shoot hoops or engage in video game activity that allows me to channel my frustration over them getting my order wrong for the third time.  Also, being in the land of Mickey doesn't hurt either.  Air hockey anyone?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-2
Coco P.,"Lawrence, KS",0,6,,4.0,10/1/2013,"Staff was very friendly and helpful. Tostada nachos were slightly burned and ""under-cheesed"" but still good. Fried green beans were surprisingly good with a great dipping sauce to compliment. The yukatan salad was very tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-2
knife l.,"Sanford, FL",2,18,5,1.0,3/10/2008,"T.G.I.Fridays on Saturday Sand Lake & OBT :(     Not that this will suprise you, but T.G.I. Fridays isn't fun anymore. No more flair just  inept service help, mediocre food and over-the-top decor. Since I already knew this your wondering why I went at all?? Well, they are advertising new menu items from the guy  on the Food network so I thought perhaps the food was better. No, it's still greasy over priced crap. The server was lifeless and rude which is normal in these places but he also had no idea what a Vodka Collins was. I love well trained help, too bad I didn't see any. After being served a terrible; water, splash of sour mix and Vodka type cocktail that was suppose to be what I ordered I sat patiently for about 22 seconds before carrying it back to the bar for assistance. No bartender in site, that's nice. Isn't this a place that spends weeks training people to show company knowledge and pride and all that bullshit?? I worked for T.G.I. Fridays in New Orleans and I had two weeks of training to go through and to this day remember some of it. Finally a blonde shows up, not very interested in helping me but did. Could I tell her how to make a Vodka Collins? Thankfully the manager showed up and was very nice and helpful. Somehow I ended up with a vodka and cranberry made with premium Vodka. Not what I wanted but it was refreshing.Server Mr. Not-Interested, hasn't been back and a new gal brought our lunch. Average, not spectacular just food. Not that it had to tap dance down my throat but when your advertising budget is in the millions and your food is blah something seems like horse shit on a stick. It's just lunch why do I care? Got a whole day of fun planned.Save your money, time, lunch, dinner and drinks for elsewhere. Fun and flair are gone from Friday's. Over priced, over decorated and under expectation. Mc Donald's has better food and service! originally  seen on  March 9, 2008. Shitty Food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando-2
