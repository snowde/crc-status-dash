Elizabeth W.,"Orlando, FL",39,69,16,3.0,7/31/2014,"I spent several minutes deciding if I should give this place 2 or 3 stars and decided that the friendliness of the servers pushed them to a 3. However, in not sure if they're genuinely friendly or act that way towards me because  I always come with my friend who is their regular.  The service gradually got slower as we went on, the bartender was waiting on us with no help from any other servers. It drove me crazy that I had to wait longer to get my check and get me refill and ask for anything else because he always had to stop what he was doing to make drinks for other people. He could have at least sent someone else to help us when he was busy.  Also, I tried a dish there I tried the last time I went. It came with Mac n cheese that was surprisingly delicious but this time it wasn't the same, it didn't even look the same as of they used a different cheese and the chicken also had a different flavor that I didn't enjoy. I was upset with the inconsistency, if I ordered something again it's because I liked it yet I ended up with something that seemed almost like a different dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando?start=40
Roni K.,"Kissimmee, FL",0,12,,1.0,4/10/2015,"I usually love TGI Fridays but this time.. not so much. The server was friendly, but the service was bad. I ordered a mixed grill which included a small sirloin and fried shrimp. Food was VERY slow, When it arrived, no shrimp and I was finished my steak before the waitress (Who had not brought the food) stopped by to check on us. My daughter's cheeseburger was supposed to have mayo and mustard. It had neither. We ordered the brownie desert, very deceiving in the picture, it looks like a big thing, with nuts and caramel drizzle- it is tiny, one tiny scoop of ice cream, and the brownie tasted stale. When we got about halfway home (an hour away), my daughter realized that her money had fallen out of her pocket. She had been attending the Megacon at the convention center, and she had 26 dollars cash in her pocket- she counted it at the restaurant, and put it back in her shallow pocket, and it was gone. This is not the restaurant's fault obviously but I have been trying to call for almost an hour to tell them what happened, and to see if by some stroke of luck someone turned the money in (does that even happen? I would turn in money if I found it but maybe I am just weird). I thought maybe the bus boy or the waitress may have seen it, and maybe we could have gotten it back, but after an hour of calling, no one ever answers. I called another location to see if they might be able to help me reach someone there, I was put on hold for almost 10 minutes and the person never came back to the phone. Aside from losing all her money.... the food was ok at best and even though the waitress was nice, the service was bad and they were not really even busy at the time we went.  Sure would have been nice if I could have reached someone by phone to ask them about the lost cash..... I know chances are slim someone found it and turned it in, but in the event someone did, I will never know because I CAN'T REACH ANYONE. Ridiculous. Not a fan of this location, no plans to go back.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando?start=40
Shelly Chelle E.,"Orlando, FL",107,5,,1.0,12/19/2015,"Waitress name was Christine. She has very poor customer service and does not know the importance of taking care of the customers she serves. We was a table of 4 and her other table was a table of 8. I noticed she got all their orders right. I ordered a drink and water with lime. She forgot our waters and had to be reminded.. Her response was wait she needed to get the table of 8 drinks first when we was there first waiting. I ordered sizzling chicken and shrimp and Cajun shrimp and chicken pastas. My sizzling chicken and shrimp meal was not sizzling like I'm use to seeing when I come to TGI Fridays. Everything looked like it had been microwaved. Shrimps looked fried. The other meal ordered, the noodles were not hot, fresh and steamy. Very disappointed with the service. The manager Eli wanted to fix the issue but I refused because I didn't want to give them the opportunity to put anything in my food for complaining about my orders. I will not be returning to this specific location anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando?start=40

The food was delicious and the drinks were really good and not watered down like most places.  We stayed at the Embassy Suite hotel in walking distance from this restaurant which was a plus.  It is a great spot to have dinner though if you  are in town and have no transportation because it's on the strip and very reasonable in price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando?start=40

Emily C.,"Arlington, VA",256,6,10,4.0,8/4/2012,"I recommend sitting at the large and comfortable bar. Bar staff are extremely polite and attentive, even if you aren't ordering drinks. I had the Korean tacos and a strawberry lemonade. +1 for free refills on the drink. The tacos were tasty, spicy, but the portion was on the smaller side. Granted, the dish is meant for bar snacking.

Libby W.,"Orlando, FL",504,296,74,1.0,2/18/2011,"I've always thought of TGI Fridays as a place with good drunk/ stoner food. You know fried cheese, loaded potato skins, Burgers, fried ""insert food item here"" type delicacies. But does this mean you have to be drunk or stoned to like it? We got off to an awkward start. I hate when you stand around waiting for a hostess to seat you meanwhile there are other employees running about. Our server was nice but had an awkward start as well, and finally warmed up to us.  I ordered tea with lemon and about half way through my drink realized that there was a funky spot on my lemon wedge. It looked like mold, but when I fished it out of the glass it was like a sticky spot, like someone had stuck a little piece of gray gum on it. The unidentifiable substance could have been ear wax, rubber cement, silly putty, or a dead sea slug. No one will ever know.  Our server came back and before I could tell her about the lemon she handed me a new drink, So I didn't mention the offending lemon.  They have new menu items that look great and are made with beer but they are more bar type appetizers so I ordered the new Southwest Burger and fries. I like a good sloppy burger but this was ridiculous. The massive burger was too large to fit in my mouth. The problem here was too many ingredients that were not of high quality and did nothing to enhance to burger.  A good burger starts with the patty if you bite only the beef patty it should be flavorful enough to stand alone. This one was not. The chipotle spread was not as spicy as I had hoped. The pepper jack cheese never really melted well. It was clumpy and didn't stick to the burger. The cheese lacked that crucial pepper jack flavor.   Now here is where it gets worse. They decided to overload the burger The burger had lettuce, a not so ripe yet mushy tomato slice that was tasteless, sauteed onions, red and green pepper, Cajun crispy onions which were not crispy at all because they sat on top of the cheese lump, avocado slices and pickles. This is all way too much. I'm not exaggerating when I say I could not get my mouth around the sucker. The other thing that struck me weird was the arrangement of the items on the burger. The avocado, pickles and chipotle sauce was on the bottom while all the other ingredients were on the top. Why would you choose to include both pickles and avocado? Pick one and never place one on top of the other. This burger failed to impress and just came out looking clumsy and sloppy, the fries were okay but a tad over salted. The main reason this is getting a one star is because of the lemon wedge that came with a free glob of dead sea slug ear wax and there just wasn't enough positives to bring up the score.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando?start=60

I do have to say the server was on point and could see the desperation in our faces as the drinks came fast & furious.  Or maybe it was the I *heart* Stoli t-shirt that I was wearing?

Sue M.,"Ocala, FL",199,578,5481,4.0,9/18/2015,"Note: this review is solely for the bar area. This is a medium size TGIF that has one large circular bar. There's a fare amount of table tops to drink as well as eat at. Some are quite cozy. The restroom is directly next to the bar so it's quite convenient. That being said, the service in this area is excellent and one might consider dining here if the restaurant portion is too full. The food servers are efficient and friendly. The bartenders are another story as they are over the top! They serve up some great drinks and are extremely attentive. Most of all they love sports and don't hesitate to cheer with you during a game. The parking is ill conceived as you'll drive up and down I Drive looking for it. It's in the back and is a small shared lot that's difficult to get in and out of.

Cris T.,"Town N Country Alliance, Tampa, FL",16,72,344,2.0,6/6/2016,"I rate this location solely on the service we received.  We came here to have a nice night out around the I-Drive area and chose to go here since we frequent fridays quite often.  When we got there, we were told that the wait would be an hour even at the bar by the 2 hostess and told us we were free to see if there were seatings at the bar if we wanted.  The second we took a look, we saw about four or five empty tables by the bar and tables.  I was just in shock that they hostess would actually say that to everyone who walks in without checking first.  When we sat ourselves, the server who had our table was nice enough to wipe our table down and asked us what we wanted to drink.  We ordered a rum and coke and well long island iced tea.  After ordering we asked about their promotions sitting on our table and he explained it as much as he could.  As we got our drinks it seemed like our server showed up to our table less and less and paid more attention stacking glasses and talking to co-workers more than tend to  the three tables he had.  It took a little while before he got back to us but eventually did and we finally ordered a burger and a strawberry slush for my wife because she said the rum and coke just tasted funny to her.  Again, it took a little while for him to get back and I realized when the burger hit the table, it was a lot drier than I was used to, then i realized that he forgot to ask us how we wanted the meat cooked.  We did also order crispy green bean fries which came out as expected but there is very little room for error.  Overall the experience eating here was a bit underwhelming and service could've been much better considering it was not as packed of a house as the hostess claimed it to be.  There is another Friday's around this area and we will be trying out that location next time we are in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando?start=20

Lee T.,"Douglasville, GA",6,156,90,1.0,4/6/2015,"Ok, firstly I do not really like to give anything a one start rating but in this case, TGI Friday really did earn it. Now, TGI Friday's I like and I have never had a experience like this one at any other TGI Friday location and I would have thought due to this TGI Friday being on International Drive in Orlando, that this would be at least as good if not better, then most other TGI Friday locations.......I was wrong. I took my parents there, as they were visiting from England and we were traveling around FL. We go in and were seated quickly, although the fact that the place was mostly empty and it was lunch time, should have tipped me off that something was wrong. there was one couple at another table near us and then a table with a party of 8 and then us. So service should not have been an issue. We sit and wait about 10 minutes and a waiter arrives with the pace of a sleep walking slough. We places our orders for our drinks and he slowly moves away. Another 5 minutes pass and he returns at the speed of stop and hands us our drinks. We place our orders......nothing elaborate.......I ordered a prime rib sandwich.......my dad ordered a burger and my mother had french onion soup.  So we sit and sit and sit......another 15 minutes pass and I attracted our waiter who had so far never bothered to check with us to see if we needed a refill on our drinks, which we did. I asked what was going on with our order and he says he will check. Another 10 minutes go by and our waiter returns and said our order should be out shortly.......my dad asked what the delay was and the waiter said it was because of the party of 8.  5 more minutes pass and my mother gets her french onion soup. The bowl had soup splashed down one side of the bowl, most likely due to the way the waiter seemed to wave the bowl from side to side as he slowly oozed his way to us and by the time my dad and I get our food, my mother has already eaten hers. My dad's burger was COLD, as most likely it had sat in the kitchen for a while. My prime rib sandwich was sub par, the bread was dry and they did not even give me any ajue sauce to go with it. When the waiter brought us the bill, I asked him what all the delay was about and that I know it was not because of the party of 8. He told me it was because they only had one cook and he had messed up some orders and was running behind. We paid the bill and left, I was going to complain to the manager but from the scowl on her face she was displaying while hovering in the corner, I had a feeling it would not do much good. Maybe this was a one off bad experience but I know I will never return to this TGI Friday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando?start=20

I would have left however the party I was with truly wanted to stay. Once we were seated, it took over 5 minutes just to have someone come by. No silverware was provided until after appetizers arrived. I must admit the food was great, just the location was horrendous.

TGI is always a safe bet for food and drinks, and the menu is the same regardless of the location. What prompted me to write a review was the service and attention from one of their bartenders.  Panda (yes that is her name) was great. She was very positive and update, and seemed to fo out of her way to ensure great service. I recommend the Long Island Ice Tea, certainly a house specialty, foamy and delicious. Panda also provided some great insights on other hot spots to check out; nice when you have a local who shares some other hot bars to get drinks. The location is great as well, as it is the middle of the strip and close to many other attractions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando
Simone S.,"Tarrytown, NY",104,32,167,1.0,1/10/2018,"GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! Unless you like bad food and even worse customer service. My family and I were staying at a hotel relatively near by and decided to order food for pick up (since they didn't have a delivery option) after a long day at Disney. What a mistake. We ordered online and wrote all of the changes made to each order (such as different sides or things to be left off on the order.) We had about 7 people so we ordered a ton of food. Our order finished pretty quick and someone went by to pick it up. When they got back, we realized there were a couple of things missing and some of the orders had the wrong sides. So obviously we were a little irritated but remained calm and called to try to figure out what happened.  I called and I'm assuming a hostess was put on. I tried to explain that several things were missing and that I could give her the ticket order number and the name for our order to look it up in the system and she rudely interrupted and asked what was missing. So I told her everything that was missing and she told me to wait while she got a manager. A few minutes later a lady named Kathy who said she was a manager came onto the phone. She heard all the things missing and that were wrong and told me that the reason why the sides were wrong was because they had run out of the sides that we ordered. (mind you we payed extra for these sides). When I asked why they didn't call us back or inform us about this she just blamed the bartender saying he forgot. She offered to give us a $30 dollar credit to come back tomorrow since nobody wanted to go retrieve the food that was left out of the order. So we agreed and she took down our name and our number and told us that she wrote it down in a book of claims and that we would just have to give our name when we came in the next day and the credit would be applied.  The food itself was pretty bad. Everything was a little below average. The fries that came with my burger had zero seasoning and were really cold and not crisp at all. The burger was just okay too.  Fast forward to the next day we went in to place our order and spoke with one of the servers, I believe his name was Andrew (he was nice throughout the awful process). We ordered everything and explained that Kathy the manager had given us a $30 dollar credit and he just looked really confused and said that there was no manager named Kathy. He told us he would get his manager to come talk to us. It took awhile for the manager to come talk to us. When he finally came, he listened to us and informed us again that there was no manager named Kathy and that he didn't think that they did credit. So obviously we were shocked. I mean someone who claimed to be a manager gave us credit the night before. I showed him the number that we had called and he didn't know the phone number (he said he had just started there a couple days prior) and had to go check that it was the right number, which it was. He then said he had to go check with the general manager. So he went to go check with the general manager and found out that they do offer credit and that he needed the name and number to look it up in the books. Honestly at this point the general manager should have come out to talk to us since he clearly didn't know what was going on. You guys should really train your managers before throwing them out on the floor. I don't care if they were a manager at a different store, each store runs differently and it is unprofessional to have a manager that doesn't know what is going on, on the floor. I know it's not his fault but, whoever decision it was to do this.  Finally it seemed like the whole process might be over with. However, he came back a little while and told us that the name and number wasn't in the books. At this point I was livid. Not only had an employee claimed to be a manager, but she had given us bad information and given us credit when she had no authority to do it. Additionally she had told nobody about it and while she claimed to be writing our information down, she didn't. He told us he would give us the credit this one time, like we made the whole thing up. So we just paid the difference for what was left after the credit. He honestly should have just given the rest of it to us for free due to the whole process we had to endure. But clearly the customer service is lacking in this establishment.  The general manager and the owner need to seriously look at your staff so that an issue like this does not occur again. You cannot have your staff pretending to be managers and giving out credit to people. You also need to train your new managers with how your restaurant works.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando

I ordered the shrimp and chicken pasta with all shrimp. It came with a generous portion of shrimp (small) and I love the Cajun sauce. Only downside is that it was only lukewarm. I think it was waiting on hubby's bruschetta chicken pasta and got cold.  Hubby also said the restrooms weren't too clean.

Scott A.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",14,21,13,1.0,6/11/2017,"How was my visit to TGI Friday? To sum it up it was a shocking experience and I would NEVER be back or even recommend this venue. It started from when we arrived. We (a party of 4; 3 adults and 1 child.) were advised that it would be 15 minutes before a table would be available. We looked at a menu and it wasn't long before we noticed a fair amount of clean tables and all of the seating outside was also available. They were clearly under staffed. When people arrived moments after us they were advised it would be 45mins - 60mins before a table would have been available.  While waiting for our table I decided to visit the toilets (men's) when I opened the door I was met with a pile of used paper towels on top of and around the bin, I thought to myself wow someone's not been in here for a while and proceeded to use the toilet. After washing my hands I noticed that the paper towel dispenser was extremely low (less than 10 towels) I mentioned to the bus boy that was clearing tables on my way back to the waiting area that the toilets were a mess and they were low on paper towels.  So 15 minutes later we were sat down. We were given menus and also a child's menu. The child's menu was unsuitable for the child in our party due to his allergies and enquired if they did a kids burger, we were advised that this was all they did for kids and if he wanted a burger it would have to have been off the adult menu, the only issue with this was an adult meal would have been far too large for a child. So they ended up with chips until we got them a Mcdonalds after TGI Fridays. Now the kids menu consists of 4 options for kids, so I would advise any family to seriously consider this when picking TGI Fridays, the kids menu was also not available via their website and this may explain why.  After 22 minutes of waiting for our meals we were advised the kitchen was experiencing a back log and would be longer than expected. So after 35 minutes of waiting for our meals they arrived. My meal was incorrect, I asked for no sauce on my burger and it came with sauce on it. The waitress offered to exchange the buns of my burger, I proceeded to point out that the sauce was also all over the burger. Her response was still shall I only replace the buns... So I explained I would like a fresh burger due to the sauce being all over the burger as well. So the rest of the party was sitting to their meals and I was awaiting a new one.  My meal comes out about 5 - 10 minutes later and the plate its self appeared to have sauce on it I hoped that this sauce was from my own burger and not a dirty plate that I had been given. Already sent one meal back and I was extremely hungry decided to proceed ahead with this meal.  While we were sitting having our meals we noticed a few bugs on the tables. Also while we were sitting having our meals I was watching them clean a table at the back of us and I happened to notice that there was cutlery was sitting on the table, the girl cleaning the table proceeded to spray the table (with the unused cutlery still on it) then lifted the cutlery to wipe the table and place it back on the table. She sprayed the cutlery with table cleaner!  How was the meal its self? It wasn't anything I would be shouting about and certainly was not as good as the U.K. TGI Friday's, their chip pan oil needs cleaned out due to the under/over cooked chips and also they tasted like they were cooked along side other food as they genuinely had a strange taste to them, no they were not seasoned fries. This was a concern for us as the child in our party suffers from an egg and nut allergy. I have tried better places around international drive. So my advice would be take your business else where and save yourself the hassle and money!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando

Of course we asked one of the bartenders to clarify all of this- his response was wishy washy.

They were the only restaurant within proximity of the hotel that allowed pets, and seeing that she was the ring bearer, we wouldn't dare not include her in the day after celebrations. We were seated promptly out on the Latin and thankfully it was a gorgeous fall florida day. The night after an open bar requires an enormous amount of hydration, and jokingly we each (11 of us) asked for a gallon of water. Our server brought us out 3 glasses of water each and a tree of lemons and was very quick on our water refills. We started with the nacho tostadas ( if you're dining with me and there's any form of nachos on the menu, you bet your tush we are getting them). They were really good! Fresh jalapeños, ample chicken, and a delicious creamy white queso cheese sauce. I went with the jack Daniels chicken sandwich with bacon seasoned fries and extra JD sauce. Everything was great. The food came out fast and everyone order was correct and cooked perfectly. Our server was great and we were super grateful for the fast service and ample hydration!

Marty I.,"Vandalia, OH",43,12,1,1.0,8/6/2017,"By far the worst Fridays I've ever been to. Never did see the manager the entire time we were here - he may have been in the back trying to help in the kitchen though. The host at the stand weren't particularly friendly - there were more empty tables than full tables when we came in at 9 PM on a Sunday night - we still had to wait 30 minutes to be seated because I'm guessing there wasn't enough wait staff.  I felt like our waitress tried her best and seem to be hustling - but she was overwhelmed and kept forgetting things because she was probably running way too many tables. We order the endless appetizers and it was roughly 30 minutes between each appetizer. Because they only give you a half portion - you are finished with the appetizer in 2 to 3 minutes and then had to wait 20 minutes before the next one. I can't say that I would recommend this place because the food even came out cold at times - they are severely understaffed - the restrooms were apalling - it is one of the most inefficient, dirty and poorly run Fridays that I've ever been to",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-orlando

I ordered the potato skins and the Jack Daniel's boneless wings. When my food came to the table it was cold!. Everything I ordered after that was either luke warm or cold. The last thing I ordered were the nachos. The cheese was stiff, old and cold like it had been sitting in the back. Disgusting! Why offer a deal when everything you serve is old and cold?

I ordered the mac and cheese meal with chicken. Not bad, until I found hair in my food x_X  It was gross. He just brought it out, so I knew it was a cook's hair since it was long. I had to wait for another reorder. My sister ordered the endless apps for a meal. There is no sharing this app. Each person will be charge $10 if you eat from this app. That was a huge turn off to us other 3 people because we didn't want to pay $10 for a few bites to eat.  My sister had her first sharing. The waiter never came back to refill in a timely manner. She ended up getting one small refill because it took so long. We ordered some drinks to celebrate our loss of not escaping. The orange pop sickle shot was ok. Not worth the cost though.  Overall, it was a disaster birthday lunch here.

(You could imagine the look of the hosts/hostesses when they saw a group of 6.) I also had a coupon which is really the main reason on even considering TGI Fridays. We were seated and everyone ordered, I made sure to ask our server if the coupon was applicable to our order, he said yes. The food was not even seasoned and tasted very bland. Of course by the end of our visit he told he could not apply the coupon. When we asked for extra sauces to go, he told us the kitchen was closed... we weren't asking for another entree but just for ranch. Just a very irritable visit.
