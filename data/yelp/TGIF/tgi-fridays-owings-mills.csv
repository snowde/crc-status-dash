Cherita A.,"Owings Mills, MD",51,115,88,3.0,12/11/2017,Eh. It's a TGIF and I came for girls night out. Quite honestly there would be no other reason that would lure me here. The gals planned to meet at 6 pm. I arrived a few minutes early and the parking lot was pretty empty. I found that odd for a Friday at 6 pm. We sat ourselves in the bar hoping to take advantage of happy hour specials. Not much on the happy hour specials menu for a Friday. I ordered a Tito's strawberry mule just like the woman sitting next to me. Our drinks didn't look or taste the same. We both enjoyed our drinks but found it disturbingly odd. The all you can eat apps only include 5 apps and none fit my restrictive pescatarian diet. I do enjoy the fried shrimp with Jack Daniel's sauce. It did not disappoint.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills
Aubrey F.,"Baltimore, MD",29,191,220,1.0,1/2/2018,"Horrible dining experience. Went with two friends and we put in an online reservation at 3pm for 3:30pm, which was an available time slot. I arrived at 3:33pm and stood at the front while the hostess sat a table looking at me and talking on her phone. It took her several minutes to acknowledge me and she when she did, she was still on her phone talking. I told her we had a reservation and she said it would be 15 minutes. I explained how we choose 3:30pm as our time. She said there was a wait yet it was empty except for the bar area. We didn't get seated till closer to 4. My friend ordered the Grilled Citrus Soy-Glazed Chicken. It came out came out as salmon instead of chicken. All of the vegetables looked wilted and like they had been sitting cooked and were just warmed up. We had to send her order back. My other friend ordered the BBQ chicken salad. It did not have avocado like the description stated. The chicken was cold but it was suppose to be hot. The salad looked nothing like the picture.  I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken sandwich. I substituted the jack cheese for white cheddar. The cheese was just a piece of the cheese melted into a chunk. It did not cover the chicken even a little. I also asked for regular mayo instead of the spicy mayo. It came out with the spicy mayo instead of the regular. The fries were not hot. I had to send it back to have the order remade and the fries were still cold. Our waiter seemed nice but he never checked on us or asked how our food was. He was often no where to be found. We had to ask another staff member for assistance twice. He was extremely slow with giving us our drinks and taking our order. Our food took an hour to come out and it was still wrong.  My friend went to use the restroom and went the wrong way and asked the bartender where the restroom was. He said ""go outside and use the bush to the left as a bathroom."" Very unprofessional and not okay to say, even as a joke. Worst dining experience. It seemed that management overall and staff were all very slow and were not able to accommodate the small number of people dining or get our orders right. I would not recommend this location at all. It does not even deserve the 1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills
Matthew S.,"Baltimore, MD",220,125,102,2.0,11/1/2017,"I feel like the bar and restaurant here are two different places.  Every time we give this place another chance and come in for an actual meal, we end up leaving without even being seated. It's the same story every time. We arrive, walk in and let the hostess know we'd like a booth on the restaurant side and then get told there will be a wait because they are understaffed. We look around, see no one eating or seated on the restaurant side and promptly leave b/c why would we wait to be seated in an empty restaurant?! Obviously by ""understaffed,"" they meant that none of their servers bothered to show up that day.  The bar side is another story entirely. Stop in pretty regularly for their ""All Day Happy Hour"" promotion and get prompt service from the bartender, even when there is a crowd. Drink prices are decent (3-4 dollar for a draft beer, 5-6 for their mixed drinks) and food comes out quickly when we've ordered it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills
Jada C.,"Reisterstown, MD",157,304,2575,4.0,5/1/2017,The family and I eat here often and there is rarely an issue. The greeter and table staff are normally helpful and our food items are normally hot and fresh. The $10 endless apps continue to be a hit w my boys and I continue to enjoy their Rewards Program earning points (freebies and discounts) for my buck. Every so often hubby and I come here alone for a late night snack. There are specials specific to the bar area around the clock in smaller portions that we appreciate.

Tati S.,"Columbia, MD",62,84,373,2.0,8/30/2016,"Goodness why do I keep putting myself through this pain??? I let my son choose dinner and he chose Friday's. Ok cool. Right? Wrong.  When we came in I asked for a booth, the hostess said there are no servers here yet but you can sit at the tables at the bar. Ummm okay but I have my minor child with me and your advising me to sit at the bar. Ok I guess. We found a booth at the bar sat down and the table was dirty and we werent even greeted for about 20 mins.  The whole experience was ridiculous.

Michaek S.,"Lutherville-Timonium, MD",75,288,87,4.0,10/17/2017,"Hey it's a Friday's- what can you expect?  But it's actually surprisingly good!!  I have an old friend I meet there regularly- it's a half way spot between our homes. The staff is always very polite, prompt, and friendly.  Beer selection has a few locals on tap as well as usual domestics and always cold, tasty, and reasonably priced.  The food may depend a lot on corporate kitchen frozen- but it is very high quality frozen!!  Burgers are always tasty with a nice charcoal flavor that may be liquid smoke but it works! Nice Brioche buns, good thick crispy bacon, pipping hot crispy well seasoned fries, vinegar-based not to sweet slaw-  what's not to like?!  I've rarely ventured off the basics given it's a chain- but when I have I've been pleasantly surprised.  Their spicy dishes often have real heat, use real cilantro, all veggies are fresh. Ambience is comfortable- nice, dark, quiet, clean with cushy booths. Bar is comfy too with nicely visible TVs.  It's not the trendiest place but as a good spot for burger, beer and chill for a bit in burbs it's great!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills
Brittany W.,"Baltimore, MD",205,134,131,2.0,12/14/2016,"So I was craving some mozzarella cheese sticks late, and my friend had a brilliant idea to go to Friday's.  She recommend this location since they usually have a DJ there at night.  Perfect, we can keep the party going!!! Get there and unfortunately there was no DJ, so we sat at the bar and proceeded to order our food.   Now the bartender was quick to take our order when we sat down, the food was slow to come out.  However the HUGE downside was that there was only 1, I repeat ONE, bartender to about 20 people!  I felt so bad for her, I could see how overwhelmed she was, it was written all over her face.  There was somebody helping her run food, but she was the sole one responsible for taking all the orders and closing people out.  My friend and I were not the the only people frustrated at the bar.   On the other hand the food came out nice and hot, and tasted fine as well.  But how can you really mess up mozzarella cheese sticks. Not sure if I would ever return for the simple fact that I don't think staff is treated that well.  When a server is visibly trying to hold back tears from being overwhelmed and there isn't anybody to help take orders as well as alleviate some of the frustration on the customers side.  Basically this is not an establishment that I would prefer to dine at.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills

The table was not sturdy, asked to be moved statement was ""most out tables are like this"". Once seated we had been sitting for 20mins before the waitress came over. She took our drink orders and told us it will be a few mins we have to get clean glasses first. Then silverware she said I have to go roll some up. Like what y'all stopped working???? We all got the endless appetizers and you would have thought they had to go to another state to get our food. The wait was extremely long that we only order twice. Wings came out with barely any sauce on them. The fries were fresh and hot! Eating our appetizers and the drinks still didn't come out!!!

But enter Dante... So every single time I have been to Fridays and sat at the bar and Dante is there, the service is non existent and there is ALWAYS an attitude. So what's the point of being a server/bartender if you don't want to provide the service that I came outside for?? If you hate your job, find a new one. Don't take it out on the people who like their jobs and want to spend a little money on a meal and drinks. Thumbs down..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills
Lashanda L.,"Baltimore, MD",67,273,777,3.0,5/25/2016,"A long time ago, my husband and I ate at Fridays quite frequently. It is a cool place to be. So, we decided to have a meal at a throwback restaurant. We walked in and had to wait for a table although there were many, many open tables. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, however. She took our drink order and was able to answer our questions about several options. I ordered the Mahi Mahi Bourbon something or other. In ten minutes, the waitress returned and said they were out of the tomato mozzerella salad. I substituted with the spinach. My food arrived about 5 minutes later. The mashed potatoes and spinach were delicious, but the fish was dry and like a rock. After alerting the waitress, she took it back and brought me out a fresh plate with new sides. This plate was prepared much better, but there were differences that were notably absent from the first plate. On the second plate, I had a scoop of garlic butter on the fish. In the mashed potatoes, there was now cheese. Obviously, there needs to be someone doing a better job and making sure the meals are consistent in their preparatioin so that it can be right the first time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills
Marta P.,"Parkville, MD",51,2,,1.0,8/13/2017,"This is probably my favorite restaurant but in the worst place ever. They're always ""short staffed"" and always have a reason for not being able to seat you down for 1-2 hours. Terrible terrible service too every time we come here. They give you a stank face if you don't tip them for their terrible service too. Terrible terrible terrible. I would give them negative stars if I could. The cups have huge cracks in them and I cant enjoy my food without thinking my beverage will spill on me. This place is way below average. Wouldn't recommend this place to ANYONE and I mean ANYONE.The bathrooms are dirty and the food is dry and disgusting. The manager does not manage anything well at all.

We stated no and server came over she was friendly. Our food came out quickly and meal was not bad at all for a chain restaurant I don't expect to be wowed by the slightest.

Steven J.,"Baltimore, MD",26,29,13,2.0,1/2/2015,"Fridays is what it is right? A decent place to get some simple bar food and American fare at decent prices. I haven't been much since they toned down the decor and it does seem a bit antiseptic now and bland. With that said it shouldn't be that bad.  First off the menu is a lot smaller than I remember as are the portions. The sizzling chicken and cheese I had was good but the breasts were small. My wife's jack Daniels steak was a nice size and my kids both had burgers but the fries weren't heaping, they were like a McDonald's small.  The burger was terribly under seasoned and bland. My son eats everything and left that halfway done.  The appetizers were strong which is great for a place like this to maximize sales and my son had a great milkshake. The service initially was lacking. We waited for 15 minutes for no real reason after waiting to be welcomed in.

I went on a Thursday evening and they had a DJ so that was cool. The server was nice as well and the drinks were decent however the food was very disappointing to say the least. I ordered the sampler appetizer for my meal to keep it simple and it was just underwhelming. The presentation was all bad considering it came out on a white dinner plate. The wings were dry as if they had been sitting under a great lamp for a while. The pot stickers were fine I could have passed on the cheese sticks though.

I visited with family on Saturday and the dinner service took too long! There was a piece of cheesecake wrapping in my dessert so I had to send that back. It took 30 minutes for me to get my bill. To top it off the waitress gave someone my strip points! All that after waiting 1 hour to be sat. That was the first visit. Swearing I wouldn't go back, I ended up going yesterday for a friends birthday. The service was slow again but I blame management because there was only 1 server for the entire bar and it was crowded. The final straw was moments ago when I went to eat my sizzling shrimp and chicken at home. I ordered it to go yesterday.  It was brought to the table on a plate to which I requested it be boxed. It returned in a container and a bag or so I thought. I went to sink my teeth into my dinner only to learn I was given someone else's Jack Daniel's wings.

We walked in and there was no one there, we waited by the door, and after about 3 mins a girl showed up with a really bad attitude, it was only after she sat us down was she able to crack a smile.    We ordered appetizers, and while the actual appetizers were good, the appetizer plates were wet.  I ordered a salad and a side of sweet potato fries, I've got to give credit where credit is due, the fries were great, the salad on the other hand was a miss, I had requested certain items off my salad due to dietary restrictions and it came with all the things i could not eat, needless to say i did not bother eating my meal.  The other two people I was with ordered the same meal and one found hair in her food, not very good, our waiter was very apologetic and said it had never happened before, that may or may not be true, the bottom line is that it should NEVER happen.

Erika F.,"Baltimore, MD",658,246,2024,4.0,8/9/2011,"I always convince myself to pop up at TGI Fridays, simply to see what kind of deals they have going on. Most times they'll have a 3 course meal (appetizer, entree and dessert) for $20. Sometimes they'll give you two entrees for $20, always a good idea for a group of two considering the entrees run about $10 plus.Friday's bascially offers American food from steaks, burger, chicken, ribs, salmon and shrimp. They do change up their menu on occassion and offer different flavorings for their food.      Everytime I go you can bet that I'm ordering the mozzarella sticks, which are fresh, soft, gooey and full of cheese. I laugh at the light sprinkling of greenery on top. As well, I always get the buffalo wings and ask for extra sauce to ensure soaked wings. They are pretty durn good and the wings are nice size, not the baby wings lol.      We ordered the Ultimate Margaritas and got them made with ice(slushies) and they were enormous! It was a drink for two people to share, but of course I wanted to enjoy so I handled mine by myself. Definitely get your monies worth I think the drink was around $10, normally too high for my blood, but it was a treat.      This time around my friend ordered the steak and their wedge fries. When we saw the size of the wedge fries we both were stunned and shocked. Those were the biggest fries I've ever seen in my life!! They were the size of my whole hand(as pictured) and when we looked at the waitress, she thought something was wrong when we told her and she just laughed and said, ""yeah that's our wedges"". But besides that they were good, just regular potatoes, my friend said they were a little dry but I guess so because they were so huge!     Then, I got the salmon and steak entree. It couldn't get any better than that for me because I badly wanted steak but had a taste for seafood. So, my entree came with two sides and I chose the regular seasoned fries. I wasn't too excited about the other side dish options, so I got the waitress to make my side a side salad. That was a good idea (yelpers) instead of paying $3 additional for a side salad before your meal.       The steaks and salmon come served with some kind of herbed butter on top and it enhanced the flavors of our food, we left very satisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills?start=40

The funny thing is he passed our table to place silverware on the table across from us and didnt even stop to say i'll be with you shortly. I work at a restaurant and know the difference between good and bad service and he must be new because his service is not up to par, he never apologized for us having to wait, and i was honestly ready to just walk out.

Amanda Z.,"Randallstown, MD",433,126,335,1.0,5/1/2015,"So i thought they still had endless apps.... thats the only reason we went. Get to ghe restaurant endless apps promotion is over but thats ok ill still get some mozzarella sticks and maybe a drink. The restaurant isn't very busy and we sit in a booth by the door. 5 minutes later no one has come to greet out table never mind asking for drinks. 10 minutes later still feeling invisible so we flag down the host and ask for him to find our waitress. He storms off in a huff and our waitress finally arrives. She explains she was going over a survey with another couple  ( remember this its important later )  by this time we waited so long we put our drink and food orders in at the same time. 2 pick 3 appetizer samplers and a side of mac and cheese for the third person at the table. Waitress comes back to give us an update our drinks are ready but then she says she has to wait to get them from the bar (confused face ) and the food should be up soon but would we all like to fill out a survey to get $8 off of each of our bills. She said that verbatim everyone would get the 8 off of we filled out the survey. I even repeated it to the waitress to be sure Drinks finally come. Im pretty sure the one non alcoholic drink we ordered had vodka in it and the rum punches were so strong it ruined the drink. Just like drinking rubbing alchohol. So 2 samplers come out buuutttt no macaroni and cheese. That would arrive more than halfway through everyone elses meal. I hate when food isnt timed correctly. Im not going to talk about the food quality but to say its a Friday's the food was decent nothing out of this world.  Now this survey i take it and give  the link to my friend so she can take it. She can't take it because the link can only be redeemed once. I check with the waitress and she says yea only 1 per table. When i point out thats not what she said she was kind enough to look abashed and said she would have her manager take off the 8$ from each check because she wasn't clear.  No harm no foul im just ready to go at this point.  Brings back the check and says well my manager said no so i toom 4$ off each check instead (insert another confused face ) the manager never came over to clear the matter up and she just dropped the check and left. Well oh ok no time to ask any questions i need to get back to work  I dont know why i set myself up for failure i know these types of chains arent great but i expect decent service at the minimum and if a member of your staff gets a deal wrong then tbe customer shouldn't be punished and it would have been nice if someone came and spoke to us about it but hey.

Erica T.,"Milford Mill, MD",88,10,,1.0,5/25/2017,"I understand the low ratings for this place. Came on a Thursday around 8, and was quoted a 40 minute wait, even though there were empty tables and the restaurant was not busy (host wasn't friendly).There was a large graduation party however. I've worked in restaurants before so I understand that empty tables don't always mean that the restaurant isn't busy, but there just simply weren't enough servers to accommodate the crowd. It's graduation season so they should've been prepared. Anyway, we were seated in about 15 minutes. Once we were seated, it took a while for us to get greeted and get drinks. I figured there would be a wait for food but I didn't think it would be as long as it was. My food came out after about 45 minutes, then it took another 45 minutes for my fiend to get her plate. The waitress offered an explanation but only after we asked what was up. She also didn't apologize and didn't seem phased by it. At other chains, when food is taking a long time, they usually offer a dessert or something, but we didn't even get an apology. The food and drinks were good which was the only saving grace of the night. This restaurant needs to get it together.

Kelli B.,"Ellicott City, MD",21,112,70,1.0,8/31/2014,"Lol, well where do I begin? Lets start with this establishments existing rating. How they have managed to hold onto 2.5 stars is a mystery, but I'll be happy to help knock them down another peg. I know that seems harsh right, but hear me out here. And the story goes a little something like this.  This place used to be a decent place....years ago. I can remember coming to this fridays years ago with my parents, and then my friends when I was able to drive and I along with the rest of the community have just watched it decline. And I think after tonights visit, I'm done with visits.  My mother, aunt, cousin and I arrived there on sunday 8/31/14 around 950pm. The server, I remember her name but wont put it in here because this review is gonna be bad, showed up to the table I would say about 15 minutes after I got to the table. I was going to ask the host was anyone serving the area we were seated in but I decided to wait it out. She obviously had not been to the other tables in her section because everyone in the general area seemed to be irritated with her absence. Because of this observation, we decided it would be best to tell her our food and drink order all at the same time because who knows when we would see her again.  About 25+ minutes into sitting and waiting we finally got our 4 drinks (Did I mention the place wasnt busy at all). While we were waiting, the person across from our table, tore apart her very pink burger and threw it onto the plate. She too, also irritated from our servers absence, complained to the server, manager and then ended up leaving, I believe before her check came. The food was just ok, I thank God that it was hot. The chicken didnt appear to be all that fresh looking. I was actually wondering, under the sauce that was put on it, what color would the cooked chicken have been...it looked a little gray. lol.  I cant remember if the server came to ask us how was the food, she could have, or maybe I was just imagining we had a decent server that followed restaurant protocol. My mother asked the server to go a little heavy on the ice cream, because she loves it so much, and the server obliged (that was nice i admit). I must have said something about how I fully planned on doing the survey, which I think she didn't plan on because she went into some speech about please give her a 9 or a 10 or they would get in trouble. We all just kind of looked at each other and waited for the server to walk away before we kind of had an unsaid moment between us all where we thought 'that's never going to happen.' Then to make the situation even more awkward, she came back and repeated the same thing and added that they have meeting about why the state of the restaurant is so poor....just odd.  I took pictures which I will post of the dirty dishes sitting on the surrounding tables that had been sitting there for some time. The floor was dirty and the place had a funny smell. There was no soap in the mens bathroom.  I did the survey , failed it, I did rate them well on the exterior of the building.  This location, I'm surprised its still in business. If I do have to go to a fridays, I think I will do what I've been doing which is to drive past this one and go to the one  in Towson.  In this particular instance, I recommended we go here because it was late and I wanted to crawl under the table in embarrassment for recommending it. Due to the condition of the floor, I felt it better to sit in shame in my seat.

Laurie J.,"Anne Arundel County, MD",54,7,9,1.0,8/20/2016,"Let me start by saying I have been to this location before and never experienced this. The service was ok... The bar area was busy at 2:30 and the bartender had to handle the entire area. The drinks were good but when my wings came out that's when it went downhill. After eating 1 wing, I went to get my second an there is was...... A long black synthetic hair! Yuck!!!! I called the bartender over and discreetly told him there was a hair in my food. He said well it's not mine, and took the plate away. He didn't return to the table, offer to refresh our drinks - nothing. The manager brings out a new set of wings. I told him I'm sorry I don't want anything from that kitchen. There was a hair in the food... If he had asked me I would have told him not to put another order in. The manager took the food. Didn't offer an apology, nothing. The bartender seemed to have an attitude that I didn't want the wings and didn't come to the table. Finally we caught his eye and he said I'll bring your check. Not did you need anything else....which at that point we didn't- we wanted to leave - but thanks for asking. I won't be back... Two bad TGIF experiences in two days- this restaurant has lost its appeal.  Finally, when he brought the check he jokingly said, maybe it was your hair in it- pointing to my friend that was with me. She was like how you figure, the food never came near me. Then he said again it wasn't him- he's bald and said how he looked in the back and no one has long hair. So I'm lying? How about the food runners? Bc there's a girl with a really long weave walking food around... Did you check her?  Check your food before you eat!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills?start=20
Dash S.,"Baltimore, MD",34,85,32,1.0,8/10/2015,"Before kids... my wife and I used to go and eat at Friday's...(read drink at Friday's) often. I really happened to be in the mood for Friday's shrimp. So I decided to take 2 of my 3 children while my wife was out with our other child.  We went in and had a slight wait prior to being seated despite there seeming like there was plenty of seating available.  Once our waitress came over she took our drink orders and when she returned she didn't leave straws. This is a pet peeve of mine. So my kids with their kids cups can't get to their drinks, because they have tops and just that little straw hole that has to be poked out. When she returned to take our order she finally left straws and mentioned the endless appetizers. She explained how the appetizer I was looking at worked and then gave us a few minutes to decide on our order. Mind you I came in for Friday's Shrimp... After looking it over I decided to order the endless boneless wings. My son wanted chicken fingers and my daughter picked the kids sliders. We then placed out order and the boneless wings came out rather quickly, great! This is going to be great I think. One problem... I was given one set of utensils and no plates for my kids... I had to ask for plates for them, when they came I had to then ask for utensils for them... ARGH are you kidding? The waitress brought back plastic utensils for my kids. Better than nothing I guess. I shared my boneless wings with my kids and just about as we were done the boneless wings their food arrived.  I then asked our waitress for my next order of boneless wings and I asked to change up the flavor. She informed me that she has already put in an order with the flavor I wanted, and to switch it up wasn't going to be a big deal as they were coming up all the time. So I wait... and wait... and wait... my kids have finished their food... and still nothing. Our waitress has been back to our table multiple times and still nothing. I finally after a good 45 minutes from the time I got the boneless wings I decided to ask for a manager... I recount my experience. Bottom line...

So we are like lets go someplace to get more bang for our buck! FRIDAY'S IT IS!!!   I loved the new décor. I had no idea that they were renovating but the place looked amazing. I did only go to the bar area and grabbed a table. The tables are bigger and thicker and the chairs have that nice cushion seating!! The same seats were are the bar. The only thing I didn't understand was the wood panel box above the bar that was holding the TV inside the bar area seating. I guess it was better/closer view for those sitting at the bar directly.   We had an awesome server named Bonnie was AMAZING and they have a new uniforms that were quite flattering. Just a simple place shirt with the Friday's logo and I believe they could wear whatever bottoms. Either way it was neat and professional for the atmosphere. My friend was running late but Bonnie took care of me to start. She told me about the happy hour specials and was very convincing that I tried one of the new tropical margarita with Malibu red. OMG!!! This drink was so awesome and half way done I was feeling pretty nice! SCORE!! I also ordered some spinach dip to hold me over since appetizers were half off.   Once my friend got there is was a drink and an half in and feeling great. Bonnie quickly came over to take her order and took our food order for more apps and everything was out quickly. There was no issue with the food and the drinks just continued to be great. For happy hour on Friday they have a DJ and that just made the evening even more fun to add great music to the mix.

Alex D.,"Owings Mills, MD",103,29,,1.0,8/15/2015,"If I was able to leave no stars I would. Here is how the night began... Showed up at 10:30 on a Saturday night, extremely loud DJ in the bar and a party to the side. 50% of the tables are empty so we assumed everything would be fine.  We are handed a buzzer and told the wait would be 25 minutes. On a Saturday night with a full restaurant that's understandable, but it was an empty restaurant with servers and hosts standing around chatting. We decided to wait anyway.  About 20 minutes into our wait a host mentions the bar is self searing but the music IS SO LOUD it's not worth it and would not be enjoyable.  We continue to wait and three or four more tables are now waiting as well. Tables stay dirty as patrons leave and yet no one is seated.  I asked 45 minutes later (from when we arrived) when we would be seated and we were assured NEXT...well EVERYONE was next, even guests that showed up 35 minutes after we did.  So finally seated at 11:15 and we didn't have a server come by until 11:30. 15 minutes for a greet? Out of control when there are 8 tables maybe and half a dozen servers.  Dustin did a fair job, but there was no customer service just basic drinks and order.  There is no manager present, no kindness for the  wait and the food is subpar.  Hosts are running food and the bar has wasted patrons and very young guests with the intensely loud music.  If servers have time to sit at a table while guests haven't been helped that's a problem.  Where is your waitstaff? Where are your bussers? (We saw ONE older woman busting her butt and no one helping her) Where is your kitchen? 17 minute tickets for appetizers when you advertise endless apps? WHERE THE HELL IS A MANAGER?! It's currently 12:25 and we are still waiting on orders.  There is no pre-busing so our table is dirty.  The list could continue...but at this point it's useless. If you come here prepare for a poorly run establishment is every sense of the phrase.  Shape up Friday's. Update: Food was awful, tasted like it was frozen and cooked half way.

Amanda H.,"Cockeysville, MD",43,73,,2.0,4/30/2014,"TGI Friday's continues to leave me with mixed feelings, but a little negative than positive. After swearing to never visit the Towson Town Center location again, I decided to try this one. The food was delicious, as always. My steak was cooked perfectly, everything was served hot. The strawberry passion fruit iced tea was super-good. That's where the positive ends. I had a coupon for a free entree and they wouldn't take it, the coupon said it was good until May 10th, but the manager refused it. I used my smart phone to find another coupon for a free dessert and that was accepted. The server was really slow with everything, I don't get why a refill takes more than 5 minutes, but at least my son got his refill. I asked for more water and never got it.  We had to eat dessert with our dirty dinner dishes on the table. We left before the server came back and cleared our plates. The annoying thing is that the server would even put dessert on the table when everyone in my party still has their dirty in front of them. I had to get up and clear all of the dishes to the other end of the table. Apparently, this was not a problem at all for the server. She could have at least thanked me for doing her job. The check came and the dessert discount wasn't on it. I had to flag down another server and ask to find my server since my server might not have come back to the table until closing time. She took her sweet time fixing the discount, but we finally got everything paid for. Seriously, the check was delivered to my table at 6:58 and I couldn't get it right and paid for until 7:22.

Chris S.,"Columbia, MD",0,13,16,5.0,2/21/2009,"Pros:  - Great Appetizers  - Huge Variety  - Good for Lunch or Dinner  Cons:  - Often the Appetizer comes out only a few seconds before the entrees, which kind of makes them pointless.  The TGI Fridays is my favorite place to go for dinner in Owings Mills. The menu is always changing and classics are still as good as ever. The appetizer's are also really tasty and there is something for everyone. The service is usually very good, but no matter whether you order the appetizer as soon as you sit down or some time after, it almost always will come out 30 seconds before you receive the actual meal. It's not that big a deal, but it's worth noting as it happens every time. It is also worth noting that while some restaurants in Owings Mills can sometimes not cook meat to the wellness you may prefer, we have never had a problem with this at TGI Fridays.

The server had a great personality so that helped matters. I ordered the three for all (mozz sticks, BBQ boneless wings, pan seared dumplings). The dumplings are usually my favorite, and were good, but they were really brown and a little tough/overcooked. I may go back if I'm with a group and it's for drinks and conversation only. I most likely won't voluntarily come back for a sit-down meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills?start=60
Tiffany B.,"Randallstown, MD",2,16,,2.0,10/11/2009,"I only go to this Friday's when there is no where else to go. The menu at the Reisterstown Rd location is extremely limited! The pastas and appetizers you'll get from other locations are simply not on the menu here, probably bc the clientel at this location do not order more sophisticated meals. Also, this place is ALWAYS jammed pack. The waiting staff are usually friendly but don't give guests much attention. This place also has a weird odor. And don't bother trying to go here for the bar bc there is NEVER space at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills?start=60
Baiji O.,"Reisterstown, MD",0,9,,2.0,12/15/2014,Two stars only because the food was really good. We went in for dinner on a weekday. The place didn't seen very crowded we were seated right by the hostess stand by a friendly hostess who told us about the rib promotion and then brought us menu inserts about it.........then we waited......and waited....another staff member told us our waitress was handling a check and eventually she did appear. We put in our food and drink orders at the same time since we'd had a while to decide although she also told us that the ribs did not come with sides when the hostess told us they had.....then we waited for nearly twenty minutes without even our drinks. She brought out our drinks a water and a beer just before the food.....which she had gotten partly wrong.....so she sighed over it and said she'd try to figure out how to get us the proper rib option in a very put out manner......which she did a bit later. She checked on us briefly but did not refill my water......fifteen minutes after we finished eating I turned to the nearby host stand and asked for the check and a box. The hostess brought me a box and had the waitress bring me the check. There were several people at the host stand during the entire trip and as I could clearly overhear them I can't imagine they didn't know we were bring ignored.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills?start=60

Yang W.,"Baltimore, MD",45,11,,1.0,10/28/2011,Too dissappointed with food here. Steaks are either raw or burned. I swear i wouldn't go to Friday's again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills?start=60
Robyn H.,"Philadelphia, PA",449,463,54,3.0,3/30/2010,"I kinda like this Friday's!  It stays crowded, but there's hardly ever a wait. Waitresses are really nice compared to back home in Philly... Must be that southern charm!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills?start=60
Karina B.,"Baltimore, MD",8,29,,3.0,8/26/2009,"Well the prices, as always, are pretty reasonable just like all the other Friday's.  However, I'm kinda sorry that I limited myself to this location because the service really dampered my experience. It was my b-day, but I didn't want all the bells-and-whistles singing and crap, so me and my bf just went for a quiet dinner.  Our server was a guy and pretty attentive to us the whole evening.  He wasn't the problem; it was his co-workers.  The food came out really fast.  We didn't really want to order an appetizer, so we went right to main courses.  I got Friday's Shrimp and Fries (pretty good) and my bf got Cajun Pasta (DELICIOUS).  After the meal we were trying to just let our food settle and have a little conversation.  Well, seeing as though this was a Friday night, this annoyed a couple of the female waitresses who rudely talked about us behind our booth and said we were ""just sitting there for nothing"".  I guess they REALLY needed those tables :\  Now, I know it's busy, but the whole point of paying a gratuity is to have a dine-in experience and get to relax.  If I wanted fast food, I could have just went to McDonald's.  I was offended that they would treat their customers like that, especially on my b-day lol. To prevent my bf cussing them out, we just paid them and left, seeing as though they wanted us out so quick.  I will go back to Friday's, but not this one, especially if those snooty teenage girls are still working there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills?start=60
Najat W.,"Baltimore, MD",13,16,,3.0,2/19/2011,"This tgi Fridays is ok, I would rather spend my time traveling to the one in Towson just because the menu is a little better, but if you like a setting where it's not that crowded during lunch then this location in owings mills is for you, because Towson's tgi Fridays is way more packed during lunch time, but at night there about the same when it comes to a crowd.

Jay K.,"Columbia, MD",0,10,,2.0,8/26/2012,"I really hate to only give two stars for this review, but my dining experience this past friday (8/24/12) was so ridiculous that even though it ended up more or less satisfactory, the overall result was such that an ""A-OK' rating was just too much. Let me explain: My wife and I met two friends at the restaurant around 11pm friday night. We sat down and were attended to in short order by our waiter (whose I regrettably forget). He took our drink orders quickly and checked in on us frequently while we took our sweet time deciding what we wanted.  I decided on the black bean burger, hold the mayo and cheese with extra avocado and balsamic onions. Simple. He sent the order to the kitchen and we waited. And waited. And waited. I will admit that it was a busy friday night, but between the four of us there were two appetizers and two sandwiches - not exactly complicated fare. Our poor waiter had to come to our table three or four times to let us know that it'd be right out. Finally, our food came out - well, most of it. My burger for some reason came out a solid five minutes later than the other things we ordered.  When it came out it had cheese on it. I can't eat cheese. Called the waiter over, and he literally shook his head and apologized. The burger goes back, and I wait another twenty minutes. Meanwhile, the waiter is awesome - refilling drinks like crazy, checking up on us, the works. Seriously, this guy was a rockstar. The re-fired burger comes back out, instead of the onions that are supposed to be balsamic as per the menu description I get a pile of red onion slices that aren't raw, but haven't been grilled, either - they'e just sort of soft and warm. At this point my wife and friends have all but finished their food, and I'm laughing at how ridiculous this is. It's a freaking BURGER. it shouldn't take three tries to get it right. I call the waiter over, show him what's up and ask for the manager. The manager shows up a minute later and I describe to him briefly what the issue is and what I need. He handles it well - takes the burger back and apologizes then heads for the kitchen.  In the end I got my black bean burger, with extra avocado and onions, hold the mayo and cheese and the manager comped my meal. But damn. I ended up actually eating my food in the car on the way home because at that point we'd been there long enough for everyone else to eat and we had to start heading out so we could get some sleep.  So yeah. Two stars overall. I know friday nights are busy for a place like Friday's, but there's no way that a simple burger should take three tries. That's nuts. I appreciate the manager comping the meal, but when you think about it it was the least he could do. I would have appreciated getting my food on time so I could have eaten with my friends and gotten on with my night in a reasonable fashion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-owings-mills?start=60
