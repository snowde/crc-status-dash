Chris B.,"Panama City Beach, FL",94,147,961,3.0,5/27/2012,"This is your typical TGIF Fridays chain, but on this side of the bridge you can't be to picky. I've only set at the bar and on the patio outside (personal preference) good casual/trendy atmosphere to sit back and have a beer with friends. I gave it 3 stars rather than 4 due to there small draft beer selection. The pot stickers are amazing, sizzling chicken is another must have item and of course they have the TGIF classic Jack Daniels menu.  The pros: cool atmosphere and you can sit outside The cons: not much on tap",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city?start=20
Mike S.,"Woodstock, GA",0,3,,3.0,5/29/2015,Service poor. Took too long. Food was good. Ribs and Cajun shrimp and chicken good.  Main issue was service,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city?start=20
R C.,"Panama City, FL",0,75,12,2.0,1/24/2016,We had the sizzling chicken/shrimp and french dip sandwich.  We used to eat here often but have not been here for about 5 years. It seems this place has gone downhill quite a bit in menu selections and food quality.  The chicken was dry and chewy and the French dip meat was fatty with way too much horse rsdish.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city?start=20
Scott J.,"Salina, KS",14,194,102,3.0,8/25/2013,"a cliché TGIF dining.  Only issue was after being told we would be seated immediately, it took 10 min to get our table ready.  Though it was 8:30 at night when we ordered, it took 25 minutes to get our order served which lead to some antsy kids.  The pecan crusted chix salad was pretty good.  Our kids chicken burger must have been on the breast of a sparrow as it was dwarfed by the bun.  Not really worth $70 for 5 but we knew that going in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city?start=20
Frank U.,"Birmingham, AL",6,178,318,4.0,12/31/2012,Awesome food..resonable prices and great staff. Different drink specials each night of the week!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city?start=20
Justin C.,"Panama City, FL",16,22,3,5.0,11/14/2014,"As a frequent to-go ordered the barkeep always takes care of me, probably better than the actual waitresses. Levi is the only server I recommend. Other than new menu items to try the food has always been great. Never found a new item thats been bad. My favorite app is the pretzels with cheese. I highly recommend you try it out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city?start=20
Iamsukie N.,"Alpharetta, GA",1,13,1,1.0,10/17/2013,If you're the manager and your kitchen is backed up so bad that it's causing up to 30 minute delays for food to get to your guests then it's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to walk the floor and let people know. Your wait staff cannot do it all by themselves.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city?start=20
Denise S.,"Lynn Haven, FL",2,10,2,4.0,6/20/2014,Always new and interesting drinks! Food and service is so-so. Its your basic generic chain restaurant with a decent menu. I would definitely recommend sitting in the bar area!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city?start=20
Lo S.,"Tampa, FL",279,206,321,5.0,1/25/2011,"How have I not already written a review about you, baby?  I'm really slipping, son!!  I used to live right behind this place for a few years. I really like this spot.  If you go at the right time, the bar area is poppin.  Good music.  They hauled off and played Beyonce  once and I've been messing with them SINCE!  hahaha!   I usually sit at the bar instead of getting a table b/c there's TV's everywhere and it's just more fun.  I was always going so I can't say the service is always good but it's consistent.   There's some catty lil blonde chick that forgets that people want drinks from bartenders and whatnot.  Like she's just there to....stand around.  *GET MY COCKTAIL,  ANDDDD NICELY....OLE WATERHEAD A**   Othen than that....THIS IS MY SPOT!!!!!!  They have this drink called a Berry Acai Sour that is.....just.....everything dreams are made of.  It's the only place in town to get it too!  I always order the same thing on the menu because it's sooooooo goooooddd.  I get the salmon and shrimp scampi, it's my favorite meal there!  I've even went to other TGI's locally and they just dont measure up to this place, for some reason.   Go here....you'll like it!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city?start=20
David B.,"Panama City, FL",15,51,22,4.0,7/21/2013,I usually just go here to grab a drink. I have yet to find the night when more people are there. Always seems slow around the bar,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city?start=20
John B.,"Mandeville, LA",11,26,8,3.0,5/31/2012,"Typical chain restaurant. The food was decent, if not a little pricey. The service was polite, but a little slow. I wish we had chosen a local eatery, rather than wasting a meal here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city?start=20
Aimee C.,"Longwood, FL",301,124,40,4.0,1/21/2009,"Our waiter and the kitchen staff were very accommodating to our special requests (i.e. no butter or salt on my entree). All of our food was very tasty, even mine without ""seasoning"".  What I really like about their food is that it is made to order.  A lot of chain restaurants serve foods that are ""pre-seasoned"" so everything tastes the same no matter which restaurant of the chain you eat at. We'll probably go back again in the future.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city?start=20
DeFuniak F.,"DeFuniak Springs, FL",0,28,,5.0,4/14/2013,"Food was great, the 2 for 10 specials were fantastic.  Dinner with 4 beers for $32.  What a bargain.  Everything was fresh, service was great, will definitely be back next time I am in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city?start=20
Wayne R.,"Lynn Haven, FL",7,58,175,4.0,10/13/2017,"I like to go here and sit at the bar, have a few mixed drinks and dinner. They have Great bar prices and a large menu. If I want low carb, I go to their grilled chicken salad. Very tasty. They have an ""All you can eat "" endless appetizers. I really like their meatballs in a ragu sauce with little slices of toast served in a mini iron skillet , the pot stickers, boneless hot wings with ranch , and the gooey cheese sticks with marinara sauce. They have plenty of other choices like chicken flatbread. Which is kinda like pizza. Hey have a nice steak too. And they are open late. There are TVs everywhere and they have portable TV speakers that you can set at your table so that you can hear you're particular game you're watching. Can get a little loud in there. They also have an outdoor dining area   I like to drop In here every once in a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city
M M.,"New York, NY",1,59,9,1.0,11/14/2017,"Do not go here.  My findings;  upon arriving with family, there were no hostess at the counter.  We stood in plain visibility for 20 minutes.    It was clearly visible that the manager was putting around in the kitchen, the bartender looked at us several times and slouched over the counter, the waitresses and waiters did not make any effort or eye contact with us while walking right past and across us.  It is also clearly obvious that we must be from another galaxy or dimension as none of the employees who were ""not"" present at their jobs did not see or acknowledge us.  After much waiting we decided to leave,  no effort was made to attain our business.   This establishment is not worthy of the title or let alone a tip of a star.  Clearly a sad representation and unaccountability of the chain and it's manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city
Geneva H.,"New Orleans, LA",381,71,118,2.0,10/1/2017,Because at least we got food. This place was understaffed and unorganized. For some reason my all you can eat appetizers cost $15 at this location. My sliders were trash.  They couldn't figure how to seat my party at a half empty restaurant because they didn't want to burden the staff. So we just sat next to each other and the same waitress still served all of us? My friend's pecan chicken was raw in the middle. I was also vexed that I wasn't told about the drink specials. I found out about them from a local friend after I ordered a drink. I got the drink special later and it was a salty margarita? Is that a thing? Like super salty. It was the wackest Fridays ever. I'm sure I came across as a stereotypical hard to serve black woman but the truth is I was a disappointed and tired customer who was hungry with no other choices. Wack.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city

Dayna G.,"Lynn Haven, FL",9,12,,1.0,6/5/2017,"We came in about two weeks ago and were quickly reminded why we don't come very often. We were seated quickly and were told our server would be with us shortly. Fifteen minutes later, no server. We watched her go to every table that surrounded us, watched her look at us, and watched her ignore us. At one point, as she walked by our table to get to the table behind us, she literally turned her head so we could not make eye contact. We walked out and  will never be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city

Sid L.,"Panama City, FL",5,1,2,1.0,3/1/2017,"Came here the other night on a Tuesday. Ordered two alcoholic drinks that didn't come for over 30 minutes. When my burger arrived, I picked it up to take a bite and before I could the cheese on the burger oozed off into a clump on my plate. We hadn't been here in over a year because last time was an awful experience and we thought we'd give it another try. Mistake. This place still sucks. Sad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city
Bri H.,"Pensacola, FL",0,14,,1.0,8/15/2017,"We had the worst experience ever. My husband, mother, and I just ordered 3 ribeye steaks there and they were absolutely aweful. They were tough and bland. They tasted like they were cooked previously and rewarmed in the microwave with butter thrown on top. The Caesar salads was awful, drenched in dressing no cheese and no croutons with a nasty burnt lemon. What a waste of 100 dollars and when we said something to the server about them, she acted as if we were lying and just trying to cause confusion so we simply ate our sides, paid our ticket, and left. What a way to welcome out of towners. You guys were not accommodating at all. Will never eat here again and definitely will not recommend anyone I know to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city
Chris B.,"Tyndall Air Force Base, FL",0,16,4,3.0,7/2/2017,"Fried Green Beans with wasabi dip were yummy.

Why do I always let my friends talk me into coming here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city
Chad M.,"East St. Louis, IL",26,35,1,3.0,5/20/2016,Had the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta and it was surprisingly good. Server was very friendly and knowledgable.

Emylee D.,"Panama City Beach, FL",16,10,4,2.0,5/21/2016,"We stopped here for dinner one night because we couldn't find a place that sounded appetizing to everyone, and the atmosphere was pretty nice. We got seated pretty quickly but waited awhile for our food. The food made me feel sick to my stomach and parts of my French dip sand-which had frozen chunks in them. The only reason they're getting 2 stars is because the appetizers were awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city
Laurie G.,"South Grafton, MA",0,31,3,5.0,7/24/2016,What a wonderful experience. To rate this TGIF 99 out of 100 . We started off with a cocktail the pain eraser it actually had alcohol in it. It didn't just taste like fruit juice and an edible pineapple slice. This is where they lost one point. The bun on our slider appetizer was not the right fit for this delicious patty. We each had the $10 rib plate out of this world!! The service Barry gave was five star in itself!! We will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city
Raven L.,"Panama City, FL",0,21,1,5.0,5/16/2016,This is the best Friday's I've ever been too. Their burgers are great. Love the new endless apps. Its a great place to watch a game and grab a beer and a bite in the bar or enjoy dinner in the dining room. Love that they are open late! Hubby and I grabbed a late night dinner last nite. We enjoyed their $4 apps and ordered dinner. We had had a long day and decided at the last minute to get our meal to go. The staff was awesome and wrapped it up for us on the fly. My husband had the stacker burger with this really amazing aiole and bbq. Its his favorite. I had their parmesan crusted chicken with the mac and cheese and tomato salad. Great chicken and mac and cheese! I wasnt partial to the vinagrette they had on the tomatoes. Service is always good here. And prices are really reasonable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city
Jacqueline B.,"Panama City, FL",40,24,1,1.0,1/20/2016,"Hubs and I headed here because we've always had good luck with this chain in other places we've lived (New Orleans, LA, Shreveport, LA, Eastern NC) so we decided to try our local chain.  First off, the prices were high.  Even on their 4-7-4 promotion that they had going on... not all the appetizers are $4.00.  The price simply STARTS at $4.00 and moves on up from there.  (Just a heads-up) We ordered the $4.00 pretzel and pub cheese appetizer.  Laughable.  Two pretzels, overly salted (but soft and warm) with the tiniest cup of cheese sauce on the side.  Well, I'm realistic - it was only $4.00.  What should I expect??  Hubs then ordered the parmesan chicken salad.  He gets a 1/2 salad for only a $1.00 less than the full menu price.  The salad was decent and the chicken was good, but it was really small.  I ordered the Cajun shrimp and chicken alfredo... oh dear Jeebuz!!  The sauce was congealing, the shrimp were so overcooked it was like a gross seafood-type leather.  It literally set off my gag reflex.  I sent the dish back - I didn't want another one (quite frankly, my appetite was over at that point).  Hubs encouraged me to get something else... so I tried the French dip.  The au jus was great, the sandwich tasted good, but the meat was stringy and once again garnered the gag reflex.  I didn't complain.  We ate the fries (hubs was still hungry) and I took the other half of the sandwich home and gave it to the dog.  I think the dog enjoyed the crap out of that sandwich, so... at least someone got some satisfaction!! The waitress was slow (the restaurant was barely half-full), they sat us in with all of the families - in some indoor patio.  The silverware was crusty when I unwrapped it and I had to ask another server for a new knife because of the permanent chunks on that one. Now, I realize that this is a chain and they can only do so much... but it was weird that a manager never came to the table to ask me what was wrong with my original dish.  I ended up eating after the hubs was finished with his meal.   This catastrophe cost us a whopping $32.00 (one $4.00 app, 1 salad, 1 sandwich, and one soft drink).  On the way home, we stopped at f*cking Wendy's so that my husband could pick up a burger.  What a wasted trip.  Wish I would've read up on it BEFORE I opted to eat there.  Never again. ETA:  The French dip sandwich gave the dog some serious gas.  It's bad in here... thinking about moving to another room.  Gross!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city
Eric B.,"Panama City, FL",3,29,8,2.0,8/22/2014,"I've always liked the menu at TGI Friday's and the ambience isn't bad either. This particular TGI Friday's has trouble with consistency.  Some days the visit is delightful and the food properly prepared, delivered to the table on time, and taste great. When everything is clicking in a TGI Friday's it's good. A national chain like this knows how to dial in the recipe the menu and everything. However (and I can only make a guess as to why a tried and tested system breaks down in one location and not in so many others) those things go downhill fast when management isn't what it should be. Case in point, my most recent visit: No attention was given to special requests such as ""no onions"", drinks were not refilled without asking repeatedly, and the food was so over seasoned that some of it was almost inedible while other food on the same plate was seasoned properly.  Even their stripes loyalty club is not enough incentive to roll the dice these days at this particular restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city
Lisa O.,"Fayetteville, GA",40,5,,1.0,9/24/2016,"Worst ever.  Food might be good but we were never greeted or acknowledged upon arrival. No smiles, no hi. Asked for a table for three by an 8 yr old and you can't smile? Really? After 15 minutes of being ignored we left. The manager came out of the kitchen when we finally see a waitress heading towards us and tells her you have a table...outside. Thanks for nothing,  go ro Chili's down the street. Joey is an awesome, friendly waiter and Sasha, the hostess, happy, friendly and smiles when see sees you. Great service there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-panama-city
