Chanda K.,"Marietta, GA",137,14,16,4.0,10/12/2017,"I enjoyed a jack Daniels burger with fries and some fried shrimp. since it is a chance, it tasted like all other TGIF's. The waiter was nice though and very efficient. Had a pleasant manner and got our correct. They were a little stingy with the sauce, but when j asked for more, they were happy to give me more.  If you are looking for the everyday average meal. This will not disappoint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola
Shelby L.,"Birmingham, AL",143,116,304,4.0,10/30/2017,My bf and I have been going here pretty regularly anytime I'm in town. We love to get appetizers and split them. They're very accomodating and are always able to make them vegetarian for me. Love TGIF and love this location!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola
John J.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",267,69,50,3.0,9/11/2017,"We came in at a relatively not busy hour. The restaurant seemed to be a wreck with little attention to eating. The service was a bit slow despite how little crowd the restaurant had. The food was actually pretty good. I had the wingman burger and it was tasty. It was the right amount of spicy where it did not ruin the meal. It even came with two wings on top which was a nice touch. They apparently have a rewards program now which the server explained to me. If you are a frequent visitor, it is definitely a must where you can achieve all sorts of discounts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola
Kay R.,"Pensacola, FL",0,9,1,1.0,12/11/2017,"I treated my sister here for her birthday as we have both been wanting to go for a while. We were extremely disappointed to find that the menu had change and the prices went up sky high. My intentions were to get the endless apps but the price is now $15 instead of $10 and the choices aren't appealing. Anyway, she ordered the jack daniel's steak, she asked the waitress to add mushrooms... The waitress says they can't or something along the lines of they don't have any. Mind you, my sister have ordered it all the time in the past that way. I ordered the chicken tenders, my usual always satisfied with that but the price went from $9.99 to nearly $13. My sister's food looked good she said it was pretty good. I was so disappointed and upset when I saw my plate of food. The tenders were fine but the amount of fries for $13 was down right disrespectful *see picture* I was so upset. My sister asked me not to complain because the manager was really nice to us. My sister ordered a basket full of fries for ONLY $3. We ate some and still had enough to take her home. I was upset the whole night and it was supposed to be an enjoyable and pleasant dining experience celebrating my sister's birthday. I will be calling corporate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola
Renee C.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",7,57,85,4.0,9/15/2017,Friday's is always a hit or miss. Menu changes are up and down. My Salmon Cobb Salad was delicious.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola
Mary J.,"Fort Walton Beach, FL",13,14,3,5.0,9/21/2017,TGIF is always good place to eat.  The variety of food just make me slobber and want for more.  There. Also good selection of beer,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola
Ian B.,"Alpharetta, GA",1,1,,5.0,8/26/2017,"My bartender, Jordyn was absolutely fabulous!  She was extremely polite and made my drinks very quick and neatly! Couldn't ask for anything more! I will be returning as often as I can whenever I'm in town on business. Thursday's are a great night to go out for a quick bite to eat and a few drinks with colleagues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola
Chris S.,"Pace, FL",0,18,,1.0,4/22/2017,"2:00pm on a Saturday I walk in.  About 20% full. Ask for table for 1.  The hostess says ""she will seat you"".  We turn and watch ""her"" chat with the server about 30' away.  We wait.  And wait.  Finally she wraps up her chat and comes over.  I order a drink.  It takes just under 20 minutes to arrive.  It tastes like we used to make them in fraternity parties 30 years ago.   Overpriced at $4.  I order a chicken sandwich.  It take just over 45 minutes.  It's pretty good, but it's not THAT good.  I point out the wait.  Waitress says ""I'll let the manager know"".  Manager never shows up.  Bill comes for $15.  No discounts.   I give my debit card.  When I start to sign the receipt I notice it's for $40.  Now the manager shows up.  Comps the whole meal.  Good job.  But, it doesn't save this visit.  Too many good restaurants to ever go through this again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola

Kelljor S.,"Cantonment, FL",0,90,52,5.0,10/31/2016,"Our server Tequila was EXCELLENT. They were out of onion straws and she requested the cook to prepare fresh cut onions, thinned. The little things that make a BIG difference. She was prompt with every need.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola
Brendan R.,"Pensacola, FL",7,6,,1.0,1/8/2016,"Considering the busy Friday night the service was very good but the food was on par with a McDonalds value meal. For $11.50 we got ""double patty"" burgers but the two patties together barely added up to an average burger's worth of meat. They were nearly burnt to a crisp and tasted like grill charr. My BBQ burger had a tiny dollop of sauce in the middle and I had to order an extra side of sauce just to drench the thing to be able to choke it down. We went because we had a coupon for a free entree but I don't think we will go again even if the whole meal is free. Again, the servers were very nice, helpful, and accommodating but we go to restaurants for the food. This food was terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola
Nikky B.,"Pensacola, FL",0,4,,2.0,5/26/2017,"Waitress/es were very inattentive. To say the least. The food was mediocre at best. As my husband and I were waiting for our food, we were looking around at the other customers. It seemed they were looking around, wondering when they were going to be served as well. Not worth the trip. Unless you want to experience what a Monday is at a restaurant location, then by all means.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola
Kalia A.,"Pensacola, FL",47,8,,3.0,7/13/2016,"Bf and I went on a Wednesday night. The service was fine but the food took a LONG time. The appetizer also came our about 2 minutes before our food, but we ordered it all at once so it's not a big deal.  However, what IS disappointing is the food. We got one of the flatbreads and it was $10 for 3 pieces of thin flatbread with sparse chicken but, in its defense, lots of fresh veggies. I ordered the Jack Daniels burger, and all I could taste was grill char.  Honestly can't remember what entrée the bf got but it wasn't anything to write home about, but the mac and cheese he ordered was pretty gross--it's just overcooked noodles in a thick, ricotta-like, not-at-all-creamy sauce that tastes strictly like parmesan. Lots and lots of parmesan.  The bill was well over $40 (with tip, though) and we ordered waters to drink. Overall, service was fine, but the food took a while, and it didn't seem to be worth the money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola
Patrick R.,"Milton, FL",0,9,,1.0,4/17/2016,I can't believe we tried Fridays again after receiving lackluster food before but things can change. We arrived for Friday's brunch and my granddaughter had high hopes for the waffles with bananas after exhausting all of her only two options on the kids menu only to have her hopes crushed when the waiter informed us that since Fridays doesn't sell enough waffles that the waffle maker was removed from the store. No need to look over the menu again since her only option was now scrambled eggs which she might as well have ordered at McDonalds and at least would have received a toy in her happy meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola

Elizabeth G.,"Pensacola, FL",2,99,139,4.0,4/17/2016,"Great since I was here last.  I do miss the old salsa, than the pizza tasting new sauce.better atmosphere, food good.had to update review,  Fried chicken steak was delious.  Chicken was not dry, the breading had some great flavorings, although not served with traditional gravy.  Was still good.  Home fries much greasy.  My partner  or I not able to eat, but we ate the side fruit melon, juicy, sweet.  Waffle was nit warm, appeared a little overdone, inside was soft and thick , also had to pass on half waffle.  Steak very tender, and  out watering good.  Overall great, waitress was very hospitable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola

Ryan B.,"Pensacola, FL",96,17,16,4.0,3/29/2016,"Really enjoy coming here, I usually sit at the bar and always feel at home. It's a place you could become a ""regular"" at if you wanted to, or just mind your own business. The staff is very friendly, from the top down. Always greeted by name when I am there. Tell me another chain restaurant that can do that. Food is above average for a chain as well, I usually order a salad which are all very tasty and a great value. Cocktails are very crafty and delicious as Friday's are known for there variety. Bar tenders are very friendly and knowledgeable as well. Wine list could use a little more quality and variety but hey that's a corporate thing so whatever. All in all, a great place that I frequent at least several times a month.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola
Brandon S.,"Pensacola, FL",96,14,,1.0,4/26/2015,Food is all ways good but the service is all ways slow.

Erin G.,"Lancaster, CA",4,31,1,1.0,1/20/2015,"Only giving one star because I can't give none. Ordered the chicken skewers with different sides than that originally come with it. When my plate arrived the sides were wrong. My companion ordered a steak medium well. The first steak was medium rare and when they brought the second one, it was a different cut steak and was well done. The manager offered no apologies for either mistake. Also, one of the other servers kept touching his face and then touching plates/napkin/silverware. He had a cold and his noises were disgusting and noticeably done over the food. This is the last time I'll be visiting this Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola?start=20

Kaitlin S.,"Madisonville, LA",0,44,9,5.0,11/6/2014,"I husband and I recently went to the grand reopening. I have Celiac Disease and require a strict gluten free diet. When I asked for the menu, I expected for a few things to be gluten free. The GF menu came with a large variety of foods and even a dessert! I was so excited. My husband had chicken and shrimp and I opted for the burger with a GF bun with mashed potatoes. It was by far the best gf burger I have had in a restaurant. We had a really great time.

Jacob J.,"Pensacola, FL",30,6,2,1.0,7/4/2013,We waited far too long for our food and our waitress was horrible. The salad my wife ordered was way to heavy on the caesar dressing to the point that she couldn't eat it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola?start=20
Brittney S.,"Gainesville, FL",9,8,1,1.0,8/4/2014,"What brought us here was the unlimited appetizers promotion going on. We ordered the tuscan spinach dip and were quite disappointed. The dip literally looked like it had just come out of the microwave and was surprisingly watery NOT cheesy. As for the ""chips"" a few were pretty good but some were extremely soggy and tasted like cardboard. On our second ""round"" the spinach dip took forever to come out (and the restaurant was pretty empty) and it was still cold and half-frozen. Yup. Frozen. I am pretty disappointed that the waiter could not exchange our order or even get the manager out to speak with us. Be even told us that they were having issues with their microwave (microwave? Do they no even cook the food? Is it all just reheated over and over?) We wanted our money back for the terrible food and our waiter said he couldn't that for us. We felt very disappointed and frankly upset that they didn't care about their customers. When we just asked for the bill the waiter developed a snarky attitude and later came back to say ""I hope you guys come back to see us and enjoy our food again"" with a grimace. I couldn't help but to stare at him. Are you kidding me? No apology for the horrible service and quality? Pretending like everything was OK? We reassured him we won't be coming back and left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola?start=20
Molly P.,"Pensacola, FL",0,4,1,2.0,8/21/2013,"Went on a Tuesday at about 5. My husband had a burger which he liked. I had French onion soup, that was good. But I ordered a pasta, I can't remember the name of it. Though I know it had capers, lemon butter sauce and spinach in it. Now that was a Nast nasty pasta. They took it back and off my bill. Then i ordered more soup to go and they charged me $5 where the 1st soup I ate cost me $3!Won't go back even though the service was good.

Song N.,"Pensacola, FL",74,96,14,4.0,11/12/2012,"I stopped by here for Sunday lunch with my bf. The place was pretty crowded which I expected for a Sunday football day, but we got a table right away which was very nice. Our waiter was really friendly and attentive. We started out with some kind of cheese, veggies, and nachos on a skillet that my bf ordered for appetizers, and it was delicious. I ordered the salmon with lobster dish with sweet potato fries and rice; it was pretty good except the salmon was a little too done and dry. I had the brownie obsession for dessert and it was absolutely delightful with the cold ice cream and warm brownie. It was pricey, but I enjoyed the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola?start=20

Lolly C.,"Poulsbo, WA",77,7,2,4.0,6/24/2013,Our friends brought us to this Tgi Friday's on Airport Blvd in Pensacola. It looked a little busy but we were seated right away. We ordered a round of the house margaritas on the rocks. Our drinks were delivered quickly by the smiling server. We all ordered the spinach artichoke dip to have together as an appetizer. The dip along with some hot freshly made tortilla chips were delivered after a very short wait. I ordered the new dish called Tuna Crisps which consisted of three slices of fine sushi grade tuna that had been seared around all the edges served atop a crisp tortilla chip. The tuna itself was topped with a dab of sour cream and a big dollop of guacamole. Each stack was garnished with a slice of jalapeno. The dishes our table ordered were all tasty and well prepared. There certainly were no complaints at our table!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola?start=20
Amy B.,"Pensacola, FL",5,3,,1.0,3/13/2013,"This place was awful! I was there last night and over half the place was empty and she had me wait for a table for 15 min, I asked why with all these open tables she explained to ME they only had one server at 630 dinner time, I've ran.into this problem at a few places around Pensacola, I don't understand it. After we got seated the server was rude at first then I explained to her that I don't understand why everyone is so rude, she changed her attitude but the food was awful, cold, chips were old cheese dip cold.. It was awful. I'll have to say the manager came over on his own and we talked he apologized and comp'd my meal that I didn't even touch and said it wasn't normally  like this, which I find it hard to believe and asked me if I wanted dessert. I was thinking I haven't even ate dinner yet..lol so.he insisted me take a.card for fee appetizer or dessert next time. Sadly to say there won't be a next time for me it was that awful. 30$ for some chicken fingers that my daughter.enjoyed:) I just want to find a really good place to eat out here!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pensacola?start=20
