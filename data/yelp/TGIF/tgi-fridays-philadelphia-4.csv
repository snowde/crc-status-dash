Kristina A.,"San Francisco, CA",466,261,118,4.0,10/3/2008,"Although 3 stars is probably more accurate, but this is the best T.G.I. Friday's I've ever been to and I really enjoyed my long layover thanks to this place. I attempted to order a mere pint of hefeweizen, but apparently could only get a big ol' pilsner glass of it - not a disappointment. My cheese and grilled onion sliders actually came medium rare and were very satisfying. Both the hostess and my waitress were fast, courteous and let me sit at my table watching Sports Center and drinking my beer in peace.  I appreciate that this is a good place to relax and get a meal and a beer while traveling. I walked around a loooong time in a daze of over-caffeinated, sleep-deprived starvation before selecting this spot and think I can say it's your best choice in the Terminal B/C building at Philadelphia Airport, so I have to go with a bonus star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-philadelphia-4
