Mike J.,"Lake Hiawatha, NJ",85,429,465,4.0,5/14/2014,Have not been here in moment now. Today the out our new menus. Far over due for this place. Came here before going to work.. Decided on a Jack Dainels Chicken sandwich over getting a salad. Always good for me. Most and seasoned as I like it.  It's a quiet Wed early evening. However on the weekends if you looking for a rocking Friday's. This place does have a live dj as well.  This particular location always seem cleaner than others I visit. Bathroom stocked and friendly service. Always a good experience coming,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-piscataway
Edward E.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",106,13,35,1.0,12/29/2017,"Pecan chicken crusted salad. Use to be one of my favorite dishes. I ordered it just now and kept biting at it for a while(would not break) I asked the waitress is this microwaved? She said yes.  I could not break the pieces of chicken biting into it.  I guess I'll ask from now on, what is actually cooked back there?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-piscataway
Veronica L.,"New York, NY",3,85,,1.0,11/15/2017,"Against my better judgment, I decided to dine here because I was pressed for time to drive elsewhere.  The Good:  My server was very sweet, attentive, quick, and truly cared about doing a great job. The Bad: The food. I started with Broccoli Cheese soup. It was served on the cold side and had to be heated up. The broccoli was raw and tasted very bitter. It was gross but I ate around the raw broccoli because I didn't want to be a pain to the nice server who had to have it warmed up. Then I ordered boneless chicken wings. I was served mostly bits of fried batter with a few bits of very dry chicken. Again, very gross. Lastly, I ordered a house salad of which a quarter was inedible because it consisted of brown rotten lettuce. I left thirty dollars later completely unsatisfied and feeling totally gross from eating such terrible food.  I do take some responsibility for going to Friday's in the first place because I knew I was in for chain restaurant food. I just wish I was proven wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-piscataway
Jennifer G.,"Somerville, NJ",3,59,324,1.0,11/21/2017,"We came out to celebrate a birthday tonight. There was no wait we got seated right away. We choose to play a game on this computer on the table, although we did not swipe a credit card thru it added $2.00 to our bill. I don't think I like this computer thing at all now why didn't it tell us it would be added to our bill??? Ok on to the food, I ordered cup of clam chowder and it is horrible was not hot 1 piece of clam, broth was watery, potatoes hard and extremely salty. Tip do not order the clam chowder!!! Salmon was ok vegies fine and rice good. Our server was bad she barely spoke to us then only came once to our table. While I sit here thirsty I can see her in the back talking away with other employees drinking a cup of beverage. Mean while I sit here with nothing to drink!!! Seriously terrible I do not even want to leave her a tip!!! Bad service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-piscataway

Lulu W.,"Edison, NJ",1,39,5,4.0,3/19/2017,We seated ourselves in a booth by the bar. Had burgers with our rewards points and some drinks.

Clint M.,"Trenton, NJ",73,18,,1.0,3/10/2017,Be advised this is not a corporate TGI Fridays so anything you see on the website about Happy Hour specials may not and probably will not be accepted.

Katherine M.,"Edison, NJ",14,59,24,1.0,5/22/2016,"The food was good. Unfortunately the service is deplorable. We were sitting there for quite some time before the waiter came up to us and said ""how are you"" and then just stared at us. Never asked what kind of drinks we wanted nor stated any of the specials that were mentioned at other tables like Happy Hour & 1/2 off appetizers. Maybe our table didn't qualify for that? We told him to put an appetizer in first and then he took our order. Both appetizers & entrees came at the same time. By that time we just wanted to get out of there. The pro? The kiosk allows you to pay without any further interaction with the crappy service. The con? Too bad we couldn't order from there. Just an advertisement of 10% of the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-piscataway

Keisha B.,"Edison, NJ",2,13,,1.0,10/16/2015,"The service is horrible for the 2nd time in a row. Today takes the cake though, we had to get our own menus for starters. Then wait 10 minutes for someone to even say hello to us. Next up, 5 minutes after the orders are placed the waiter tells us that the restaurant has run out of the 10 Oz sirloin which was ordered would we want a 6oz. We ask if we could get the 10oz rib eye for the same cost (a small $2.00 price difference) and the lovely waiter denied the request without even checking with management.  The meal is still in progress, but I am sure the horrible experience will continue. MANAGER SAVED THE DAY WITH HIS EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THE WAITER CAME AROUND AND BECAME A BETTER WAITER!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-piscataway
Sam J.,"Providence, RI",1,14,1,3.0,9/19/2016,"My coworkers and I came here for lunch one day. We were seated and our orders were taken. Three out of the six people ordered salads. The service was horrendous. One persons food which was not a salad, something that was served hot was served a well 15 minutes before anyone else got their food. Finally when we received our food there was no apology for the wait not even an acknowledgement of the wait. All in all, we will not be returning here. There are many other options in the area that will probably have better service and have the decency to apologize if the wait time is longer then expected. I went to this bar over the weekend and had a much different  experience then my lunch w coworkers last month. Kareem was our bartender and he was friendly, attentive, and just overall provided awesome customer service.

Rob L.,"Avenel, NJ",85,6,,1.0,12/12/2016,"After 5 hours in a car all I really wanted to was sit down and have a beer. After walking in not getting greeted and having to wait 11 minutes to even get noticed I was able to place an order with saeed and waiting anthor 6 minutes for my one beer and water i was able to have my one flat beer and water. Saeed smelled of pot and cigarettes. I'm not sure if the bar filled with dirty empty tables and the other maybe 4 people sitting at the bar had as bad of service as I did but that one beer and water was all I was allowed to have as saeed never returned even after my three appetizers came. I'm glad the 6 other members of the wait staff got great laughs out me getting up and going to look for the salt and pepper from one of the other dirty tables in the bar as they had a good view just sitting around by the kitchen doors, saeed again walked between the group of other wait staff and behind the bar farthest away from me almost like he was avoiding   happy , I'm glad I got my the one beer I wanted cause that's all I was given. I would have loved to spent more money and time in your bar as I was in the mood for desert but was just handed my check and left standing there by myself as the bar was empty beside me and the dirty tables. I would like to personally thank saeed for reminding me why I take my business to Applebee's. Why stay open later then your competition if your not going to try to make money? Happy holidays here is to hopefully not having to deal with your chain again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-piscataway

Aleathia S.,"Irvington, NJ",21,250,744,3.0,9/3/2015,The place had a damp feel to it. The drinks were amazing after a slide across the oily floor to our section. I appreciate that TGIF always as a special going on. That's great! I had a 2 for 16 app and entree. The manager and waiteess was awesome since our order was disappointing.

Sam P.,"Bridgewater, NJ",1,73,78,2.0,11/2/2014,"I have been here many times before. I am here after a long time today. Looks like the management is really into cost cutting. Silver ware of previous customers is lying on the floor and paper napkins all around.  After a wait of 15 minutes our server informed us that he has many tables to attend to, hence couldn't get us our drinks on time. (This place is half empty)  With the above in mind I had no expectations with food. Shrimps were clearily not deveined. We had chrispy fried beans which was good.  My other option was BBW.

Michelle T.,"New York, NY",0,5,,1.0,3/6/2017,"Let me start by saying I'm a Friday's Stripes  Rewards member and visit the restaurant at least once a month. After this experience I certainly have no intention of dining at this location any time soon.  Visited on Saturday,  3/4/17 and had the most rude server. Her name is Corrine and right from the start she had an attitude about serving myself and my parents. She was very short with us, acting very impatient as we made our decisions. And when I showed her my Stripes number on my phone, she took my phone out of my hands and then dropped it into the table instead of handing it back to me. She later came back to check the number again and once again took my phone and then dropped it on the table. The only reason I didn't say something to her was because my food hadn't come out yet. Then when our food came out, the order was wrong!   Such a frustrating and disappointing experience. If this rude and disrespectful server is the type of employees that this Friday's is hiring, then I will definitely be going elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-piscataway
Anthony H.,"Louisville, KY",1,4,,4.0,1/9/2012,"Went there on a Monday night, at first it was slow but picked up.  It was happy hour so they had good drink prices.  The food ordered was good.  From a guys standpoint there was a hot bartender in fish net hose.  The woman waiting table around the bar was really pretty and looked like a young Sarah Palin.  I don't care what you think of her politics Sarah is hot having punched out that many kids.  I actually got up the courage to tell the young lady how pretty she was and she was also very nice.  All and all it was a good night with typical TGI food and from a shovanistic male point of view a nice scene......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-piscataway?start=40

Green Mon R.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,16,,1.0,3/11/2009,"Our favorite Johnny Carino's which was next door closed. Had to go to this crap shack instead. Ordered garden salads, iced teas (plain brewed non-alcoholic) and I ordered the penne pasta with chicken balsamic mess and my 21 yr old son ordered a plank salmon over pasta. Salad was just plain ole salad.  My dressing was the Cilantro on the side which tasted as if they drained if off from some other plate.   My pasta dish was god-awful.  It tasted as if it had been made a day or two ahead, frozen then reheated on a stove or microwave.  The sauce was kind of dried to the noodles.  It tasted as if they had added bbq sauce to spice it up.  ****BLECH****   Chicken on top of dish had that spongey consistency where you KNOW they just unfroze it and threw it into the microwave or onto a grill.   : - ( Salmon was dry. Portions were smaller than a box of Lean Cuisine. Iced teas came really weak in color (probably hadn't given them enough time to brew).  Had to grab waitress back and have her give a us two new ones.  The second were acceptable.  Waitress just kept running around with no real interest in us or our abismal meal. I ordered a strawberry lemonade to try and it really really sucked.  It was like Country Time powdered crap lemonade with artificial strawberry overly sweetened  slime dumped in.  ****AWFUL!!!!**** Had to ask for more napkins.  Placed sucked so badly and considering the fact that the Johnny Carino's next door closed, it wasn't crowded at 12:30 in the afternoon on a weekday.

The bartender was friendly and efficient, getting in our food and drink orders quickly.  I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, which looked good, but unfortunately things went downhill from there. After the first bite I hit what seemed like cartilage before realizing the entire chicken breast was hard and dried out (frozen and thawed or plain overcooked and overlooked?).

We were sat at a table in the bar area in order to take advantage of the happy hour and our waitress/bartender was extremely inattentive. Our orders took a long time to come out and when they finally did they were wrong. I ordered salmon with langostino on top and the curry sauce that they drowned it in made it nearly inedible.

As soon as we sat down we heard the waiter telling another table that the chef left and the person who filled in for him didn't know any of the recipes properly & apologized. From that point I knew it would be a bad night. The waiter waited about 15 mins to actually greet us. Which I didn't let bug me considering game 7 of the NBA  finals was on & everyone was locked in. We both ordered the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta. He put our order in then immediately came from the kitchen asked us to pick something else. Not only was this the meal the cook messed up at the near table, the restaurant ran out of Alfredo sauce. At this point I was over it and so badly wished I would've caught dinner in time at the hotel we stayed at.

We'll the skin was hard as a rock which pretty much means it was burned.  I thought something was wrong with just mine but my buddy was in the same position as me with his baked potato.   After we finished our ""meal"" here.  We actually headed over to another local restaurant and had some appetizers to fill our bellies with something that was tasteful.  I will not be coming back to this particular Friday's ever again.

The bf's value set included the cocktail shrimps, flat iron, and the chocolate peanut butter pie; the shrimps were fresh and the peanut butter pie was also very rich.  Overall, food was alright and service was good. Definitely a better experience than the last time I visited the TGIF in Times Square. Better yet, this one is closer to home. =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-piscataway?start=20
