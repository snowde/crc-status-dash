Jordanna E.,"Plantation, FL",406,321,1853,4.0,6/23/2014,"So suddenly these absolutely sub par chain restaurants are stepping up, or have I let my expectation down? Either way, I was impressed with lunch here.   I got bottle of Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc for $17because wine is 1/2 off on Wednesdays.  Same price it was at Publix. Score. Had the lunch special, 8.99 for 1/2 a french dip, french fries and a bowl of chicken tortilla soup.  It was all delicious.  Really good, totally surpassed expectations.   My daughter had the chicken fingers with fries, really good, too.  We sat ourselves at a hightop in the bar area, and the bartender waited on us.  Her name was  Laura, she was very efficient and had a few guests at the bar top, as well as three tables near the bar.  She smiled and joked, and was a great waitress.  I'd go there again for lunch.  Pretty good deal for a very good price.  3.5 stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plantation?start=20
Maria D.,"Hollywood, FL",6,15,5,1.0,11/1/2016,Horrible place they are extremely rude the food was great mind you from the one bite I was able to eat before our bartender complexly killed our appetite !!! This is after we waited over an hour for our food and it was my friends birthday!!! Ughhhhhh I can't even stand it like he wouldn't check up on us he was completely distracted and rude ... he ruined my friends birthday we ended up at another restaurant where the food wasn't great but they were completely on the ball with customer service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plantation?start=20

Sade E.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,5,3,1.0,2/28/2017,"Let me start off by saying I usually do not give bad reviews. The only reason I dined here is because it was late, the only restaurant near my job that was opened, and my coworker wanted to go out for drinks after a long day of work. We walked in on a busy Saturday night, 2/25/17. There's no 1 at the front so my friend and I stood there for about 10 minutes. This man walks up asking her myself multiple questions and we are just really confused. He then asks us where would we like to sit. We said anywhere is fine and he picks up some menus to walk us to a table. Suddenly a young lady walks up and says ""he doesn't work here."" She finds the entire situation funny and my coworker and I are just not amused. She finally finds a table to sit us at and the table is wet and dirty. We didn't make a big deal about it, we just waited to tell our server. 30 minutes later, nothing. I get up and grabbed a paper towel from the absent host stand and wiped the table down. 20 minutes later a gentleman walks up only to find out he's just a bus boy. We asked where was our server and he says he will be right with us. Yes my friend and I are extremely patient and too understanding. Finally the hostess returns to her stand with a plate of fries and chicken wings. Just eating wings while greeting people. I walk up to her and asked for the server, she says he's coming with a mouth full of fries. Finally 10 minutes later our server Jeffrey comes. He introduced himself and despite the long wait for him to come, was very friendly. I asked for a glass of wine and my friend a blackberry Long Island. 20 minutes longer we waited and I was getting a little impatient because we still had nothing to drink or eat. Suddenly Jeffrey walks back up with 2 glasses of water. He apologized and explained to us that the bar is busy. I use to be a waitress so I sympathized with him. Another 15 minutes and nothing. I asked my friend if she wanted to just leave and she said no because it's late. She didn't want to take the risk of going else where and it not being open. So we waited, finally Jeffrey returned with her Long Island but not my wine. He dropped it off and walked off quickly. Her Long Island looked as though it sat for a while because it was sweaty on the outside of the glass. She tasted it and said it was watery. In my mind I just couldn't understand how her drink was ready before mine. I ordered a glass of wine, how hard is it to make that? Whatever, I didn't bitch, I just waited. He finally came with my wine like 8 minutes later. 29 minutes later a gentlemen walked out with my coworkers food. She ordered the BBQ boneless wings. Again I had to wait, 14 minutes later I got my chicken quesadilla. Jeffrey walked it out. Again he apologized and because he was so sweet we forgave him. It was a Saturday night, being a former server I understood how overwhelmed he might have been. As the night grew old and the store came close to closing time, a lot of people began to leave so the 2nd round of drinks my friend and I ordered came out a lot quicker. Jeffrey also started to show his face more. I talked to him and he told me he was 20yrs old in school for business. I felt bad because I know I was in his position once. With that being said, despite the terrible experience I gave him a $20 tip on a $30 bill. Very generous, I know. Obviously not generous enough because I checked my bank account and seen the Jeffrey decided to give himself an extra $10. I can care less for the $, it's the principle.  The original amount I agreed to wasn't even deserved, I did it out of the kindness in my heart. He still felt as though it wasn't enough. I will never go back to this location again. I probably wouldn't even go to fridays again because the food is always horrible or mediocre at best, but that's my personal opinion, some people love their food. The only  reason I felt the need to write a review for this location is because I do not appreciate being ripped off! I want all their customers to know that they will steal your money and  brush it off as a mistake. I called and spoke with the manager, he offered my money back but like I said before it's not about the money, it's the principle. So I declined and told him let the child keep it. He obviously thinks he needed it more than I do. He also offered a free dinner, I declined that as well. My quesadilla was soggy, wet and bland. The guacamole on the side was bland. The funny part is Jeffrey asked how was it, I told him I didn't like it but not to worry about it because I know he didn't make it and his response was no one really orders that anyways.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plantation?start=20
Damdee D.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",156,28,33,1.0,7/27/2016,"Do not come here ! I called in and ordered  the Cajun chicken & shrimp pasta with extra sauce on the side . I get to the TGI and my food was ready , but when I got home I opened up the bag and guess what ? ?? It's really chicken & shrimp pasta . I was so upset , so I called and manager  on Duty he had  no customer service at all, he didn't apologize nor did he say "" well what can I go to make you happy ? ""  NOTHING . so his  staff made a mistake on my order & the only thing he told me was to come back and get the correct order.

Rachel C.,"Davie, FL",121,1,,1.0,7/17/2016,"We went to this Friday's last night for a celebration for my new business. Unfortunately, I will be celebrating another time because last night was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a Friday's or any restaurant for that matter.  There were 12 in my party and I know that it's not an easy amount of people. So we agreed to sit outside to make it easier on the restaurant. Our waitress seem very upset and that she didn't want to be there. I also could barely understand anything that the waitress said. Our food took an hour to come out. Our of the 12 of us, only the 4 kids and 3 adults ate. When we tried to talk to the manager, he never apologized or anything. I left the restaurant spending $50 dollars and never ate a thing. Thanks Friday's but you won't be seeing me or my friends again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plantation?start=20
Gerard A.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,2,,1.0,1/14/2017,Ok this place does not deserve one damn star. Walked in on Saturday at 12:15pm and no one was here. No one to great me in the front so I went to the bar where I waited 22 minutes to be services . Manger came out and said hello to me 14 minutes after I was there and disappeared .I  then suddenly noticed the bartender talking at the other end of the bar with a employer who saw me sitting there but did not greet me for another 8 minutes. I had to call him over to get service and was presented with no menu . Management and half the staff here needs to be re trained or replaced.

Nicole V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",416,431,1047,4.0,9/5/2015,"I haven't been to a Friday's in ages... maybe 3+ years but I wanted a cocktail and some comfort food and we were lured in by the heavy marketing they've been doing for the endless apps. We got there about 6pm and the place was dead. We opted to sit at the bar. We took our time checking out the menu and the drink specials.  We opted for a Watermelon Cooler and BlackBerry Long Island Shaker. The bartender, Jay was very friendly and patient with us. We inquired about the endless apps and for $12, we went to town! We started with sriracha chicken potato skins- YUM!!! We had chicken tostadas, fried mozzarella, boneless wings, flatbread, french onion pop overs. We indulged in several cocktails and our bill was super inexpensive.  I definitely recommend if you want drinks and a few apps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plantation?start=20
Jeff M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",29,2,,1.0,7/29/2016,"Close this embarrassment down.  Simple solution,  go to the food court at the mall before here. The mall right next door... fridays ... especially this one are a national embarrassment!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plantation?start=20
Jeffrey M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,,1.0,7/15/2016,"Ok. I hope to get this done quickly but fear that I will run on. I stumbled into this place last night. I had an epic terrible day and yes i went to Fridays, Initially it was fine, the bartender could have cared less that i was there as I was alone (my wife and 3 kids were ay home).  Ok, so I ordered a beer, drank said beer and eventually went to the rest room. when I returned i sat at the left side of the square bar, i didn't return to my initial seat (if you knew me you'd know that this is completely within my MO). Ok, so this is where it gets great! I made a comment to the girl, I guess young lady next to me. this comment was NOT affectionate, come on ish or flirty as no one argued that it was (to come later). I think it was sarcastic and political.... I gave it little thought but keeping with my MO, I can send a ""Yelp"" post with the utmost confidence that I did and said nothing inappropriate.  Ok, I didn't notice but i'd inadvertently stumbled onto a weak and vapid little girl who was desperate for attention. before I could blink I was approached by a manager and the (heavy set) bartender about needing to leave. Literally. But, Keeping with my Mo I responded not with vapid and outrages antics, I articulated myself with what and why. They actually dug deep and said, because you were sitting there and then moved to here. It was astounding, because of my MO of living a life where I'm not rude, insulting, unscrupulous to others, I have nothing to shy away from when and if confronted. I do suffer from an opinion and said something opinionated, but my accuser I believe was outside smoking a cigarette say ""oh my gosh, Becky, like, oh my gosh, like, really..."" I'm kidding but I'm noy. I want to focus on the bartender and the manager. The manager was actually a nice dude who seemed articulate and tried to stay faithful to his bartenders directions, regardless, of how absurd.... remember, I my crime was moving seats. This is officially my second confrontation in life pertaining to moving seats. My first one was on an Amtrak train from Fl. to Buffalo, I was upsetting the usher who was clicking a counter regarding the seats by switching seats because, I was restless... He got upset too. I was not as articulate then.  Ok, this confrontation at Fridays did not have much else other then the me, 6'3"", 240 making a articulated point of are you kidding and the bartender and manager holding fast with yup, you moved seats, she doesn't like it and we are backing that. I can't be any more honest than what I'm being... there was never nor could there have been, any suggestion of comments or actions that were inappropriate on my part. At one point i said to them, ""i have a wife and 3 kids and I've done nothing to insult that, what have I done."" They still had nothing to offer or support. By the way, the vapid teenage-esk girl, who never returned (see smoking cig. comment above) had a male friend who was present on his barstool the entire time. He said nothing and finally I compelled him with a common man ""you were right here, you know this is wrong, What have I done?"" his comment was silence. search you tube, you won't find this encounter, no one felt compelled to pull out their phone. The ability to speak for one-self won out. I did leave and please now let me address why I identified the bartender as ""chubby and gay."" He was chubby and gay. But he likely will or has slammed his fist on a table saying he does'nt get treated right or fair. Well, he knows and I know, he sucked himself into a dramatic and vapid little girls world... he drug, what seemed a nice and level headed manager into it. the Manager did the ""I'm backing you blindly thing."" But, chubby gay bartender was weak... the weakest because he had the circumstance to possibly be real... by being real he could have said, ""what did he say to you."" To which she could have (likely wouldn't have though, would likely have cursed and yelled and maybe cried, but should have said, ""he said something about Trump and our world...""  thats it folks.... that was it. At 2 in the morning that was it.... I did leave... the police were never called... this did not make it onto youtube as far as I know because my demeanor then was similar to what it is now, as I write... not dramatic... just real. Don't go to Plantation Fridays. Go if they respond and have anything compelling to say. But don't go. There is a solution portion to this rant - go to: Duffy's, Flannagans, Smoky Bones, Chili's, Twin Peaks or even Hooters... They may have taken off the suspenders and buttons, but they haven't  taken off the suspenders and buttons...  I did go to a Fridays in Tallahassee recently... go there",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plantation?start=20

Courtney R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4,5,,2.0,11/21/2011,"After arriving and checking in on yelp, i read the reviews... as you probably have seen there top priority isn't ""fast service"", it is keeping you as long as they can.  After ordering our drinks and our meals, the appetizer came right out. 45 minutes and 3 sodas later, our meal arrived. (I ordered the Carri bean chicken sandwich.) The bread was soggy from possibly sitting there to long; or the gallon of overpowering sauce. (I am a sauce lover, but this was a bit overwhelming) My lunch companion ordered the Cajun chicken pasta and it was a delight.. (a basic pasta with chicken and some veggies) I wouldn't go here again unless i knew i had some time to spare, not a good place for a ""lunch break"" luncheon. $40 for this service was not worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plantation?start=60

Michaela G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,47,80,1.0,10/29/2014,"Normally, I enjoy going to different T.G.I Friday's. I love the overall vibe of the restaurants and the decor is always different. However, when I visited this restaurant yesterday, I ended up leaving before putting in my drink order. Normally, there is a host(ess) at the front of the restaurant, but when I arrived yesterday, there was no one. There were two ladies in front of me and when the hostess finally did come to us after a little wait, she dryly asked the two ladies to follow us; completely ignoring my party.  Eventually she came back as my friend went to use the restroom and did not even greet me. She onced me over and asked how many. I told her two, and she picked up a menu and just started walking in the direction of a booth. Obviously she did not want to be there. None of the few other diners seemed to be enjoying themselves and as she led me upstairs to seating that overlooks the bar, I began to stick to the floor. Like really stick. I thought maybe I had stepped in some gum but all I could see were spills from drinks here and there. I walked the whole distance, trying to find somewhere where I wasn't glued to the floor and came up empty. Another customer noticed me pacing the floor and commented that it was everywhere in that area and how disgusting it was.  When my friend finally emerged from the bathroom, I asked her if we could find a new place to eat. I could not fathom the idea of dining in an area so filthy. It only made me fear for what state the kitchen must be in.  I had high hopes and they were ultimately smashed.

L C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,9,,1.0,2/16/2017,"Read the other reviews it all accurate. This Friday's is the worst in south Florida. The management should be fired along with the waitresses and the hostess. We came as a group the first time and the host was extremely rude (big black hostess) so rather than dealing with that we walked out keep in mind it was not busy at all. So to give it another shot and because we were shopping in the area we thought let's go with fridays on another occasion while we were in plantation. Worst decision ever! Again the same rude hostess from a month ago made no eye contact except for a female waiter that was playing with my son next to her. All we asked was booth seating to make it easier for us with our son. ""NO we ain't got none now you can wait 40 mins for one"". So rather than wait since we had other shopping to do we took what ever they had. And so there the wait started 15 mins pass we start looking around and all I can see is people waiting  around. We were sat near the kitchen area and you can see the waiters and waitresses all standing around talking to themselves about what they were doing later and it looked like a manager that was conversing with them. Needless to say a couple in front of us got up and left and although we would have done the same we stayed because it's harder to go from restaurant to restaurant with a 3 year old. So finally our waitress comes asked what we wanted to drink and we were ready to put our sons order in but nope she took the drink order and walked away quickly before we could even say anything else. We waited and got our food order put in which wasn't the greatest for the value. Usually I order premium drinks and desert but was not offered anything additional at anytime.

That wasn't the worst, she quickly apologized and ran off her coworker said she would clean up the mess. No one got the manager and no one truly apologize for what happened instead they twisted it to makeup seem like it was my fault. RIDICULOUS! I tried very hard to keep calm, no manager came to check in the situation. I had to finally call for a manager to come and even then I didn't feel satisfied. After all that the waitress same back to our table with an attitude!!! Absolutely rude!!! I was livid. Never going back there.

Michelle V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",17,15,1,1.0,6/26/2015,"Last time!  We went to this Friday's before a movie.  Mind you, the movie started at 9:40 and we got there at 8, so normally that would be enough time to eat and get to the movies (pre-purchased tickets).  Well, at first we were sat in a table where we could not have a high chair.  Don't ask me why the hostess sat us there, we clearly had a 1 year old with us.  So we were moved.  I had a coupon for a free appetizer.  We ordered and appetizer (quite greasy potato skins) and 3 drinks.  Then we ordered dinner which consisted of an appetizer for our 1 year old because the kid's menu was very limited and two entrees.  The app we ordered for our kid was on ""special"" for $5.  Our food arrived 48 minutes after we ordered - 48 MINUTES!  During that 48 minutes, my husband went to the restroom.  When he came back he said, ""if we hadn't already ordered, we would not be staying"".  Gross is all I can say about the restrooms.  The floors of the restaurant were also sticky.  I can't imagine what the back of the house looks like.  Finally food arrived, not bad, not delicious - just ok.  Looks better on the commercials and we asked for our check right away (in case that too would take long).  We gave her the coupon code for our free dessert.  Wouldn't you know it - she took off the $5 for my kid's mea/appetizer and did not discount the $8 app we ordered and shared.  Bad lady!  Manager happened to pass by doing her rounds and fixed our check, but come on!  Will not return.  Will fast-forward the commercials (so I'm not tempted to try them again).. will reply STOP to their text messages.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plantation?start=40

The place was about 1/3 filled so not busy. I was seated immediately. My server JP was very friendly and didn't pressure me for my order.  I had the white cheddar broccoli soup (tasty but a little bit salty for my taste) and the sirloin steak with potatoes and broccoli. The steak was done as ordered and the meal was enjoyable. JP checked back several times and the check was presented after I finished. Look this is not haute cuisine but the food is reasonable for the price. I would give this place a shot next time I am in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plantation
Dancing Q.,"Hollywood, FL",1,25,,1.0,11/11/2017,"I don't know what happened to this place. I used to eat here often but I went in last week and wow how things have changed! First off the place was EMPTY! Okay so late in the week, later in the evening and you hear crickets. Wow that should have been a harbinger of this dining disaster! We had to wait. Umm, there is nobody here!!! What are we waiting for???? So then we get seated and I am looking through the menus, which were tattered and coming apart! It seems some pages were wet and actually hanging out of the menu book! Our waiter came to order and after giving him our orders I looked around at the walls. They were dirty! There were smudges and such and it's obvious cleaning is not a priority around here! The greeter/door girl actually walked past our table and dropped a balled up paper on the ground and kept going. Hmmm, was it a subtle way of her telling us to leave? Hindsight is always 20/20!  Our food is served. I ordered the $12.99 ribs meal and there is a reason it's so cheap. The meat was rough and totally NOT tender. I even started to wonder if it had been cooked, like did they take a rack of ribs and poured sauce on it! They were virtually inedible! What the heck was that??? I have never in my life had such rough meat! Thankfully my guest asked for some and I nearly threw them on her plate! The fries were overly seasoned and those too were hard to eat but since they make me gag less than the undone rough ribs I soldiered on and ate them. The entire meal was a mess and I was pissed that I paid for a meal like that when eating filler paper and a plate of salt would have not only tasted better but been free! The only highlight of this forgettable meal was the waiter. His name is Clive and he said he is new. He was spot on with the drinks, bringing us napkins, checking for refills, etc. If only he could have made the ribs tender. I actually was celebrating something and my friend decided on Fridays. Initially she wanted Red Lobster but changed her mind. You all have no idea how bad I wish she would have stayed with her first choice. Sigh! :( I will not be back. If you want to just throw away your money on meat that you need fangs to eat or 1000% sodium fries, at least ask for Clive and get good wait service.

Kim C.,"Sunrise, FL",635,614,1824,4.0,3/29/2017,"The service was really good when we went in on Friday before the dinner rush. The waiter was training another waiter. They were both courteous and attentive. The restaurant is your typical chain; there is nothing spectacular or unique about it. We went in because of the $10 per person endless appetizer deal. Between the three of us, we ordered pretty much every appetizer that was eligible except the fried pickles. The drinks came out quick; the appetizers came out one after the other. We polished off every plate.  I ordered the country fried chicken sandwich with cheese, avocado, and tomato. That was really good. I stuffed myself silly from just the appetizers though. We ordered the pot stickers, buffalo boneless chicken, jack Daniels BBQ boneless chicken, mozzarella sticks, and meatballs. All were very delicious.  Based on the service and the food, I truly give it a 4 stars and would definitely return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plantation

I've been here a couple times for happy hour with girlfriends and we're usually served well, but when I'm here to dine with my boyfriend, the service is atrocious. The last time we were here, it took 20 minutes for a server to greet us. She rushed into taking our orders, which we didn't mind because we were waiting so long just for her to come for a greeting anyway. The drinks took 15 more minutes to come, and the food 15 minutes after that. The waitress then asked if we wanted dessert before the food was even consumed. She then took forever to come with the bill. It seemed that the table next to us had the same problem.  Maybe they were understaffed and always are understaffed so the waitresses don't have time to go between sections of the restaurant.

Andy V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",937,1412,6952,4.0,11/20/2015,"Because of its low rating, I'm always very skeptical about coming here, however, I've yet to have a bad experience.  When I've sat at the bar, my service has been great as well as when I've asked for a table. I typically only come here for lunch since it's by my office so I can't tell you about dinner, but I am surprised that it's not busier- this could be why my service is above par or they could just have good waitstaff. The place looks clean, so that's always a plus to me. The restrooms too. You learn a lot about a place when you use their restroom. Their salads are good, both the side salads and full dinner salads. I like their chipotle chicken salad- it's a little on the spicy side (very little). It's tasty, but not overly filling which can be a bad thing if you're really hungry. I got a side of fries there once and I think I got ten fries- note to self: never order a side of fries again. Their burgers are pretty good. I had their all- American the other day and was really surprised by it- although it was greasier than I would have wanted it, the flavor was amazing and cooked to my liking. They have happy hour every hour- you can tell me how it is, I'm not trying to get fired from my job. A $3 drink does sound tempting at times... For the food, I would give this place 3 stars because it's pretty standard food, but the service I get definitely gives it 4 stars. It's nice to be able to have a sit down lunch and not have to explain to my boss why I was gone for 90 minutes because the service was so slow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plantation

There's a lot to say about a place when you look in and see nobody, like we were the last remnants of a civilization who hasn't learned their lesson about Friday's. The waitress was almost shocked someone walked through the doors. We sat, we ate nothing appealing nor memorable. My ribs were gross, the fries sucked, and my girlfriends apps were just...there?

We had to waive down the bartender a few times to get drink refills and they just seemed pre-occupied doing other things. The food also took forever to come out; almost 30 minutes after we placed the order. f your looking for something ""quick"" for lunch, this is not the place to come. Food was mediocre. I ordered one of the lunch specials with two Jack Daniel's sliders, side salad, and fries. The sliders were overcooked and barely had any toppings and I asked for the fries to be crispy/well done and they came out soggy. Not impressed. I haven't been to a Friday's in a very long time and now I remember why. Chain restaurants seriously need to step up to the plate.

Howard H.,"Dania Beach, FL",533,459,3161,3.0,12/11/2014,"I kind have a mixed feeling when writing this review.  On the surface, the place looked clean.  To start off, we sat at the bar as usual and ordered a few drinks.  The bar was pretty empty, so was the dinning area and we got our drinks fairly quickly.  But seriously, how long does it take to pour one draft beer and make one simple long island ice tea. But, when it comes to ordering food, that was a complete different story.  Again, we did not order anything fancy like beef wellington or slow roasted shoulder of pork.  We just order two simple hamburgers.  And it took over 30 minutes for them to arrive!  The burgers itself tasted okay.  The flavor was nice and it was not dry, considering we ordered the burgers cooked to medium rare and it came out well done.   Service was not bad.  There were two bartenders on duty when we were there, and one of them was paying more attention to us than the other.  Also, according to my wife, the restroom was clean so it usually is a good sign about the rest of the place. Overall I'd have give them 4 stars, but the slow ticket time knocked one star off for them.  I still have a lot of reward points which I can redeem for free meals so we will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plantation

When our server was at the table, her attitude was nice and pleasant - the main issue we had was her lack of presence.   Food was fine, typically TGI Friday's food.  It was freshly cooked (not greasy) and it was prepared correctly (bacon bits on the side, as we requested).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-plantation
