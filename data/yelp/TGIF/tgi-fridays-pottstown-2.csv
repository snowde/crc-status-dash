Denise D.,"Pottstown, PA",8,121,3,1.0,3/25/2015,"The worst ever, ordered take out told me it would be about 30 minutes fine, it was Friday night and I understand they get busy. I went back in 35 minutes, Sat at the bar for 10 minutes, saw a bagged order sitting out it happen to be mine, When I ended up getting it the food was cold and gross, the chicken looked like it should have went with a kids meal, and the mac and cheese was the worst I had better boxed and frozen mac cheese then this was. I will not be returning. Go to longhorn, Its 10 times better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2?start=20
Gail P.,"Pottstown, PA",0,5,,1.0,12/31/2015,"I heard this was under new management and its a shame because Pottstown doesn't have a whole lot of options.  We went there about a week ago, it was a Monday night and wasn't crowded at all. We ordered drinks and they were out of Blue Moon beer, my wine glass had lipstick on it and the Shirley temple was made with seltzer not Sprite. We ordered appetizers and they ran out of both appetizers that we initially ordered. They did comp us one appetizer for the aggravation.  The meals came out and didn't look or taste appetizing. For 5 of us it was $104.00. I certainly don't have a problem spending that if the food and experience is good but this was not the case. Our waiter was friendly enough. Hopefully they get their act together because Coventry Mall can't afford to lose anymore business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2?start=20
Morton F.,"New Castle, DE",83,922,3709,4.0,5/16/2013,"I wasn't expecting great service since I arrived late at night and only the bar area was open. Surprisingly, that was not the case at all and the server was prompt and attentive. This TGI Friday's is part of the Coventry Mall and uses mall parking. However, their front door opens to the outside of the mall, so they do remain open significantly later than the rest of the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2?start=20
Jodeci J.,"Pottstown, PA",1,11,2,1.0,2/1/2014,"I will never eat here again. They gave us a broken high chair and my 9 month daughter slipped out. Luckly i caught her. When i went to the hostest stand to get a new one the manager apeared and wasn""t at all apologetic! She just got a new one and didn""t even offer to take it to my table even though i wad holdin my screaming daughter. She simply put it next to me and walked away without a word. The service was slow at 7:30 on a Wednesday. Im a strips member and i love going to Fridays.but after this experience i wont be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2?start=20
Dan B.,"Collegeville, PA",16,7,,4.0,5/15/2014,"Great food, friendly bartenders and the $4 drink specials are always great! They have a bunch of TVs so it's a good place to catch the game but it's also family friendly.  Good place to go for a quick drink, sit and chat over a few or even bring the family for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2?start=20
Ana L.,"Gilbertsville, PA",0,1,,1.0,1/31/2015,"My boyfriend and I decided to stop into Friday's based on convenience and were by no means expecting a fine dining experience, but the experience we did have has deterred us from ever going again. When we arrived at the restaurant we were advised there was a 30 minute wait and therefore decided to grab some seats at the bar. Upon walking to the bar we were surprised at how many tables were actually open and thought the wait odd. We sat down and were greeted quickly, which I was happy about, but were just as quickly informed by the couple sitting next to us that they had waited a long time for the food. We then started to notice people leaving because of the wait, so much so that other customers began to ask the bartenders what was happening. The response was ""I'm really sorry.. The kitchen is an absolute disaster tonight"" which made me feel uneasy about the meal we were going to be served. Other customers were unhappy with meals that they had received and some were even complaining that they were served incorrect orders. There seemed to be no management and no direction handling this situation, and the staff definitely was not helping. They were complaining about the kitchen openly, cursing to each other and talking so loudly to each other from across the bar that it was incredibly distracting and difficult to interact with my boyfriend. The salad I ordered was over dressed, the flatbread I received was bland and cold, and the burger my boyfriend ordered was ""alright"". Needless to say, we were very disappointed in the atmosphere and service tonight. Although we weren't expecting a 5 star experience we were certainly not expecting a 1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2?start=20
Alex H.,"Glenmoore, PA",0,2,,4.0,8/29/2014,the service is ok foods great little loud and the music sucks other than that it is a nice hang out place and endless apps great,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2?start=20
Linda S.,"Royersford, PA",0,1,,1.0,11/29/2011,"The king of bistro food is approaching it's demise.  My family and I went to TGI Fridays in Pottstown to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  I could not believe there was no happy staff available for the happy birthday serenade that made Fridays fun!  Not to mention the food was really surprisingly bad!  Cold appetizers, flavorless ribeye steak with the consistency of bubblegum, and fishy- tasting flounder indicating that it was not a fresh catch-- the waiters were nonchalant-- they were not happy and neither was my family!  Insult to injury--- the bill was a wapping $95.00!  Omg--- never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2?start=20
Gregg S.,"Pottstown, PA",0,20,,3.0,11/19/2017,Decent food with good service.  Overall appearance of the restaurant is lacking when factoring in the cost of taking the family out to dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
Jamie M.,"Conshohocken, PA",629,859,708,4.0,5/2/2017,"We stopped here for an early dinner on Sunday since we had been wandering the mall anyway. We came in through the outside entrance which is kind of awkward because you have to walk all the way through to the mall entrance to the podium to be seated. Our server was good although not all the apps came out together. (We got the side salads first and then the apps later, but no biggie). I was super excited because they still carry both the green bean crispers and pecan crusted chicken salad on their menu (Applebee's used to have them as well, but discontinued carrying both sadly!) The green bean crispers now come with a twist; they've added cucumber to their mild wasabi ranch dressing. I was caught off guard at first, but to be honest, I couldn't really taste the cucumber (the white dressing is now green with the addition though!). The pecan crusted chicken salad was amazing as usual, but I noticed they added pineapple to the dish. I love pineapple so this was a plus to me.  All in all, it was a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
Amber S.,"Lancaster, PA",182,130,185,4.0,2/7/2017,"This was my first time to this location and based on other reviews, I feel I arrived at the perfect time for a Saturday because it was not too busy, and the service was excellent. I had sat in a booth by the bar and had several waitresses checking in as they walked by to make sure nothing was needed.  When it came to the food, the appetizer was out in no time, and our entrees took the average amount of time also. My boyfriend had ordered the JD ribeye which came out overcooked but was still eatable, especially with the JD sauce he loved. I had ordered the chicken and shrimp which tasted great also! Overall, we were pretty pleased other than the overcooked ribeye, and this was way better than the Lancaster location we normally visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
David F.,"Royersford, PA",3,35,,1.0,12/18/2017,Monday night place not full took close to an hour for one burger and a salad and fries came out cold they did fix the fries and finally got silverware after waiting 15 minutes wouldn't recommend coming back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
Tina B.,"Pottstown, PA",81,140,482,3.0,6/13/2016,"I love TGI Friday's, but this is feeling like it needs a bit of a pick me up. Not sure if it's because of the location of a dying mall.  When there after doing some Christmas shopping with friends. They were very slow so we figured we could get a quick drink and a bite to eat. The drinks were pretty quick, but or meal took over an hour to get with hardly anyone there. The manger did apologies for the slow cook time. Hope they come back around!  For the food I'm not sure if there trying to save money but using instant mash potatoes with a good cut of meat, Just not right :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
Nathan W.,"West Chester, PA",68,5,,2.0,7/12/2017,"Tried the $12 endless apps. Food wasn't bad, but definitely did not live up to my expectations. Each portion is very small (understandably), but they space them out so that you fill up on less food. Hard to get your money's worth compared to places like Applebee's (that are cheaper and taste better).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
lisa a.,"Wyoming, PA",1,24,3,1.0,4/1/2017,Lukewarm food on my end.  Husband ordered a turkey avocado and bacon sandwich.  His sandwich arrived with no turkey.  Service was slow but pleasant.   We were in town visiting for a friend's party .  Avoiding this place during any future visits.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
PJ C.,"Pennsburg, PA",67,6,,1.0,4/2/2017,Stood in line for 10 minutes before we talked to anyone. We were then informed it would be 20-25 min to be seated when less than 50% of the tables were being used. Won't return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
Rich K.,"Lansdale, PA",0,29,8,1.0,11/19/2016,Do not come here. Very limited menu. Menu says ask about our local and craft beers. Well I did and waitress looked at me like I had 2 heads. She had to go ask someone and came back to tell me the didn't have any. So I ordered a beer from the menu. Don't have that either. So why is it on the menu? Idiots. And if that wasn't bad enough my pot stickers come out I take a bite and they r ice cold inside. Ridiculous. Won't come back and neither should anyone else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
Amy K.,"Cape May, NJ",34,30,30,1.0,3/19/2016,"If I could give no stars, I would. Our server was nice enough but obviously not good at his job. The braised beef tostadas I got had barely any beef on them and were drenched in sauce; not only that but it took 25 minutes for them to come out. And drink refills, forget about it; you'll wait at least 15 minutes for that. Overall the service and food quality has been decreasing over the years and has finally hit rock bottom. This will be our last time spending any time or money at this TGIF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
K M.,"Pottstown, PA",0,29,1,1.0,10/29/2016,"Haven't been to Fridays in a few years, but happened to be shopping at the mall and stopped in after the mall closed. I was far from impressed. Ordered the mushroom swiss burger, no pink - because you can only order the meat pink or no pink (Maybe it's time to hire real chefs/cooks who know how to cook meats to order). Anyway, even though I ordered ""no pink"", it was very pink, but not raw. Disappointing. They offer a side of lemon butter broccoli for $3. I received 6 VERY small florets. I couldn't believe what a rip-off that was. Will not be returning here to eat. Way overpriced, not at all a good value for my money and food was poorly prepared/presented.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
April M.,"Douglassville, PA",0,9,,1.0,11/1/2015,"Don't waste your gas driving here!  Extremely overpriced entrees.  Took forever for host to notice us since no one was at front.  During our last visit, my child ordered from the kids menu and we were charged for an adult meal.  The response from our monotone waitress-a shrug of the shoulders.  The quantity of food you get for the price is not worth it.  Don't visit this ghost town! Forgot to mention-emailed corporate and never received a response.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
Chris S.,"Pottstown, PA",0,3,,1.0,11/12/2016,Tried to eat at Friday's. Many empty tables no one waiting in front of us and we were told it was a 30 minute wait. Really try staffing your restaurant better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
Susan M.,"Palm Coast, FL",23,2,,4.0,8/3/2016,Good food and service. On par with other TGI Fridays. We are just passing through and found this restaurant was a little hard to locate due to lack of signage and location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
Andy M.,"Carmel, IN",0,23,,4.0,8/3/2016,"Not sure what everyone is complaining about. Food was the standard Friday's fare one would expect and tasty.

Ashley B.,"Stowe, PA",153,5,1,1.0,6/11/2016,"My fiancé and I haven't been to TGI Fridays in a few years and since there aren't many options in the Pottstown area, we figured why not grab dinner here. Safe to say we will not be returning after tonight. Horrible service! We waited quite awhile for our drinks, appetizer, and dinner. The potato skins we ordered were not very good and some turned out burnt. Not to mention, the very last potato skin that my fiancé ate had a ROCK in it. Yes, a rock was in our food... How does that even happen? He took his very last bite and chipped one of his back molars because of this. So disgusting!!! When our dinner came out, they forgot to add a few things to the burger I ordered. Never received refills on drinks. Overall terrible experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
Jay B.,"Gilbertsville, PA",7,11,14,5.0,7/26/2014,I've been going to Fridays for years they just recently got a promotion for all you can eat appetizers for $10 I think it's an awesome deal boneless wings potstickers and they just keep bringing a out it  is great my two favorite boneless wing sauces are Jack Daniels sauce and garlic Parmesan sauce,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
Teniel H.,"West Hempstead, NY",1,1,,1.0,2/21/2016,Ok so this is literally my first review ever and it's only because I couldn't  leave this place without writing. So let's begin. On the walk-in we were hit with a horrible smell....it's literally smelled like old people and death. Sorry but I worked in a nursing home for awhile and I know what death smells like. It's smells like death in here. Then the menu has food all over it....disgusting! The appetizers took 30 min to come out. The strawberry henny wasn't made with Hennessy and then I pull out my fork and it has food all over it. The waiter (who was great btw) brings another fork with food on it yet again. Took him 3 tries to get me a clean fork. Cudnt even eat my food because I was so grossed out. Never ag,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
James F.,"Schwenksville, PA",0,28,,4.0,12/22/2014,"We stopped off and got some standard menu items. Light eating, fried green beans and some salads. Great service from Katlyn - she was on the ball and knew how to generate business and keep the beers coming. It's a shame to see the traffic down in this location. Much better than the first time and wings are still really good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
Mayra B.,"Pottstown, PA",110,8,1,3.0,10/23/2014,"My server friends and I all went for dinner. It was about 10 of us. They weren't organized at all. They got super panicked when we told them how many there were. They weren't professional and was struggling to find a place for us to sit. There was barely anybody in the restaurant, so we felt like everything they did was unnecessary and we should have been sat in a timely manner and treated as if we were welcome. Our server at the time was busy and someone else proceeded to take our drink orders. After that our server came and everything then fell into place. We got to order our food and it turned out delicious. We had an ok time but we felt like the beginning could have went better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-pottstown-2
