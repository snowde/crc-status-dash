Bill K.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",52,47,6,3.0,8/21/2011,"Typical chain, but they do have good specials, and they take care of you if you have one of their Stripes cards.  Service at the Poughkeepsie location has been unpredictable.  I drive all over the Hudson valley as part of my job, and service at the newburgh and Middletown locations is better.  Overall, TGI Fridays is one of the better chains.  If the next visit has better service, I will upgrade them to 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-poughkeepsie?start=40

Daniel C.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",3,15,6,4.0,5/3/2014,Really good and better than I expected. I got their chicken and shrimp which was recommended from the waiter and she was right that is was amazing!!! I wish they would've served a little more chicken and less mashed potatoes too. Also their chicken was marinated with tons of flavor and seasonings and was cooked to perfection. Also their shrimp wasn't half bad but I've had better. Their Oreo madness desert tasted like an Oreo but instead of the normal Oreo cream it had Oreo ice cream and it was topped with Oreo bits and chocolate syrup.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-poughkeepsie?start=20
Cindy K.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",43,2,3,2.0,8/5/2015,"Normally we go to Fridays at night and we really like it today we went at noon for lunch. After waiting for 30 minutes and still no lunch and no waiter to inform us it's whereabouts my eyes began to wander. I was not pleased. The long row of framed pictures that are about eye level while your seated were caked with food particles, smeared with vial disgusting former matter! The one right behind my head was so encrusted that I actually took my paper napkin an draped it over the picture and wedged a knife on top to hold it in place. I was afraid that the dirt and grime over our heads that clung to to the careful placed decor would fall into my drink; not my food because I had none!!! The manager finally came over, without my asking to inform us that there was an issue with our meal and they had to remake it. A simple hamburger and a California club. So I told her about the filth and suggested they might think about hiring a new cleaning company and I pointed out the vial nastiness. Assuming that she was a professional and would of course take her job seriously I expected her to be as shocked as I was. I was so taking back and in shock when she looked at pictures on wall and said ""yes they are dirty"" and started to giggle! Like a 12 year old girl. She said ""well I am not the manager that's usually on in the morning, I'll tell someone"". So who you going tell Miss Manager, another manager? So after some more childlike giggles off she goes. Out comes the food finally after 1 hour and there are very few customers. Let's say my California Club Sandwich according to the photo looks yummy with all that Bacon. I guess they decided I didn't need much because I had one piece! Oh they gave me my mayo in a separate container because I said light on the mayo, nice right, it was very very warm, maybe under those heating lights a bit long! So if you really want to see what Friday's looks like at least the one in Poughkeepsie go in the Daytime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-poughkeepsie?start=20

Chicken was pretty much cold, the Bacon was right out of a fridge.. I'm not really a fan of eating cold bacon lard. There was maybe 1 teaspoon of blue cheese. And the dressing tasted old. The waiter came to pick up our food and I clearly wasn't even close to finishing my salad yet it was pushed to the side with a napkin on it and I was eating the French fries from my friend. He should've realized I didn't like it but didn't say anything. He also asked us probably about 10 times if we were ok throughout the night when we were waiting for food.. Maybe more. I'm a server..

Hayley M.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",0,17,,1.0,7/24/2013,"The food is serviceable - typical chain restaurant, but I think it is one of the better ones. So why the one star? This location has some SERIOUS management issues going on. We arrived at around 3:30 on a Sunday; as you'd expect, it wasn't that busy. However there was a family waiting in front of us and we were told there would be a 10 minute wait, despite the fact that the restaurant was maybe 20% full. Okay....maybe they are severely understaffed? Our waiter was friendly and decent enough. However our food (a burger and ribs, and kids chicken) took 40 minutes to come out. I saw the server go back to the kitchen a number of times, and he apologized several times for the extensive wait (and eventually gave us a free beer for our trouble even though we didn't complain, which was nice). But having to wait that long for a very basic meal when the restaurant is near empty is bizarre. Then there was the general atmosphere and behavior of the staff. When we first got there and were waiting for our table to become ""available"" two different waitresses walked by us in a huff muttering angrily under their breath (not at us, but still). Then, while we were eating there was a shouting/cursing match between two employees - there was a woman there who was clearly dressed like a manager, but she didn't seem to take any action at all, and it was very uncomfortable.  Then, our waiter was busy with 2 other patrons while we were waiting for someone to take our credit card...so, we are sitting there after a ridiculously long meal, waiting with our CC clearly out, and this manager woman walks by FOUR TIMES, not doing anything or in any rush, and does not take our card for us. Our waiter was legitimately occupied by some woman asking him a million questions about drinks, but having working in chain restaurants before, my husband and I know that the manager should be picking up that check, not walking by obliviously. All in all, worst Friday's location I've ever been to and we would never return. There is something really weird going on with the management of this particular location and they need to get it together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-poughkeepsie?start=20

It was your typical chain fried joint, chummy waitress who pretends to serve but when you ask for special items like no fruit on your hefe-weizen it still comes out with an Orange, food not timed correctly everything shows up immediately to get you out and next victims in. Anyway she wanted to go so of course we did.  We offered drinks which came out wrong as I previously spoke.

Christina V.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",99,332,215,5.0,11/22/2011,"Let me just say first thing is first...why in God's name, Amy R., would you choose Coyote Grill over this place? Coyote Grill is much like Double 0 Grill (owned by the same company, I believe?).... good food, fair service... and a big fat overpriced bill to show for it. I have to admit, though, that the one reason I frequent TGI Friday's is because of my Stripes card. It is THE best rewards program of any chain restaurant that I've ever come across. Bring a couple of friends with you, and use your stripes card, and you will already have enough points for a free dessert or appetizer! 150 points will get you a free entree'.... No, I don't work for them, but I like not paying for a meal when I'm out. Their 2 for $10 deal is also the best thing you're going to find around.... the food is always good quality and they are very accomodating with substitutions and/or leaving something out. I haven't ever had a problem with service, with the meal (ex: being too cold or the wrong thing).... this TGI Friday's in particular is great and I am just surprised by people saying that Newburgh and Middletown are better... they most certainly are not and the Poughkeepsie one is cleaner because of how new it is!

Songling D.,"Charlotte, NC",42,8,4,1.0,11/16/2017,I used to like the potstickers from Friday's. And now they switched to a different type of potstickers which has more skin than the meat.

At one point we even told her not to bring out our third order of apps. Then when we tried using a receipt coupon they wouldn't allow us to use it on ""promotional food"" even though it states that it can be used for non-alcoholic beverages.

Fist it was about 20 minutes wait to be seated and there was plenty of seat available and it was kind of empty considering it was a Friday.  We were there before 5.  It seems the the waitress had to converse about something before they could do anything. We get our seat and it took about 15 minutes for the waitress came to our table. I asked for a drink and chips with salsa also gave my order. I asked for the $10 BBQ ribs. She says it come with 2 sides, so we order our meals. Drinks came 10 minutes latter and the waitress was off to get the chips, so we thought.  10 or more minutes latter out meal come but no chip.  Waitress say ""oh I'm sorry, would you like the chips now"". I said forget it now that I have my meal.  She says OK.  Then we get the bill and I see an up charge for the sides and I asked the waitress why was there a up charge. She tells me she did not know and would ask her manager.  Well the manager come and said sorry but the side we received were not part of the deal. She was a little nasty acting like I'm trying to get something  for free but she did say she would correct the bill.  I asked if Tgfridays gave a military discount because I am 100% disabled and she said no because she took off the up charge,  which wasn't our fault because the waitress ask what side we would like and never said anything about up charge.  Well the manager comes back with new bill and it was twice the amount. I asked why the bill went up and she said ""oh sorry I don't know how to do this.
