Mark D.,"Reading, PA",23,26,36,1.0,4/20/2011,This is a simple I'm never coming back. We ate here and there was maybe 6 other people in the entire restaurant/ bar. Â  The waitress took our order... Never seen here again until it was time for the check... Err her tip... The manager brought our food.. Drinks... While the waitress talked to other waitresses the entire time we were there... The food sucked as did the service.. I mean come on it was empty in there... Now I know why 6 people were there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-reading
Jamey H.,"Wyomissing, PA",0,14,,1.0,2/3/2011,"I'm embarrassed to say that I have eaten here. We received a gift card from our dear, elderly neighbor. She meant well.  But ugghh, the pop culture music in the background was only the beginning. Our service wasn't great. Our waiter asked us for our order within a minute of looking at our menu - of course we weren't ready, and then he didn't return for another 10 minutes or so.  The only thing that was decent was the spinach dip. The beers were overpriced. My sandwich was very so - so. And, similar to how we ordered our food, it took longer than necessary to pay and sign the check. It was the type of place where you feel like you need a shower as soon as you get home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-reading
