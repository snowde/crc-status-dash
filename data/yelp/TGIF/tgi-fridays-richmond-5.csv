Marcus H.,"Chesterfield, VA",55,75,26,1.0,10/22/2017,"Now avoiding this franchise.  Walked in went to the host and told them I was here to pick up a online order for Harris. Then I waited 50 mins before a waitress walked up and said the name Harris. I walked up and it was the wrong order. I stated it wasn't my order and she said ""oh you must not have heard me then, I said Hairrs"" I smiled and said ""yes, My name is harris"". She walked away and no one came back out to figure out what was going on with my order or even talk to me. After simply asking for a refund so I can leave I was asked did my order come to the correct store I stated the store number in my electronic receipt. And not to my surprise, neither of the two ladies even know what the store number was. I was told it would take 24/72 hours to get my money back for the food I never received. Of course not to my surprise again. Patiently awaiting the ZERO star update for yelp ‍",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-richmond-5

Paula J.,"Smithtown, NY",111,145,43,2.0,5/19/2017,"Wait staff very friendly,  but quite a LONG wait for our food considering it was NOT busy at ALL and there was no reason for it to be so.  My BFF requested her chicken be pretty much over cooked,  or ""burnt""  to be specific,  but it was barely done.   I asked for my sirloin to be medium,  though I was thinking of asking for it to be medium-rare in case it was over-cooked --which is exactly what it ended up being...over-cooked.  The sesame jack chicken strips were delicious though!    They have this awesome new bubble tea available that I partook of and I'm super glad I did!

Tina K.,"Richmond, VA",66,226,8,2.0,2/2/2017,"I am giving this place two stars based solely on the kind manager who took pity on us and comped our round of drinks because the experience we had here was ridiculous. We arrived around 9:30 on a Wednesday night. The restaurant was busy, but certainly not slammed. We were a group of 8. The hostess seated us at two tables of four. When we started pushing the tables together she told me that that was a fire hazard and that we couldn't push the tables together. Are you telling me that TGIFs never has groups larger than 4 who want to sit together? I have no idea whether this is a rule or not since no restaurant has ever stopped me from pushing tables together. So we sat separated. We ordered drinks. Not crazy fancy drinks--wine and beer. We waited  1/2 hour and still no drinks arrived. Seriously? I could go pour myself a draft in about 20 seconds. Our food came out and our drinks still hadn't arrived. We finally complained to a manager who took great care of us. To say that our server was incompetent is being generous. I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants, but the one thing you can usually count on is uniformity in training. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-richmond-5

Phoebe S.,"Mechanicsville, VA",48,7,,1.0,11/23/2017,"I'm giving this one star because no stars is not an option. I came here on Thursday evening to have dinner with my boyfriend at 10pm at night. Within 12 minutes they turned the music up so loud I literally could not hear my boyfriend speak across the table. We asked the waitress what was going on and she said ""this is how it is on Thursdays""......apparently they hire a DJ on Thursdays to play music that could drown out a club sound track while people are trying to eat. The guests around us were visibly uncomfortable but the staff seemed to ignore the music level regardless. The waitress set the check down and rushed away. After we paid and asked the hostess if this was normal she explained that ""the guests always complain about it'.......why is this allowed?? It's Fridays not a club?

James M.,"Henrico, VA",122,316,293,2.0,11/4/2015,"I've been to many T.G.I. Friday's over the years and sadly I must say this experience exemplifies why it's been 10 years since I've been.  Their mailed coupon brought me in to try it, and while the food wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything above meh. I had a burger with fries. The burger was over-cooked and the fries were cool as if they'd set in the window for an extra 5-10 minutes (about as long as I'd been looking around for the bartender/waiter to ask for a second beer.)   The service was lacking in most every way. One of the bartenders was friendly and helpful, even bringing the condiments before the food arrived, but the other two were just not into being at work this day. Sadly, the helpful bartender was only present when I first arrived. One of the others was watching a video on a fellow guest's phone for several minutes while ignoring us and other patrons, who were also waiting with empty beer glasses, and the other waiter just disappeared.   This was one of the few recent times I didn't read previous Yelp reviews before choosing a restaurant, but I wish I had.

It came back a new steak, cooked very well done. When it came back, my entire table was finished with their meals. They ordered the All-American burger and fries and a sirloin (also slightly overcooked, but enjoyed). Their food was delicious! The bottomline: the kitchen service was, in fact, slow and leaves much to be desired. Thankfully, our server, Tyler, was polite and attentive.

So we waited even after that initial disappointment. We were seated and greeted by our server that took our initial drink orders and appetizers. Cool! Then after a lengthy 15 minute wait, we FINALLY received our drinks (not even the appetizer yet!) she said those would be out shortly. We finally get those and she ask to order dinner. I had a question about something on the menu and she says to me; Im not the one to answer that question; I really don't know. I ordered a more simpler meal, chicken tenders and kept it going.

We each ordered a salad (which came out with our entrées) and two of the salads had no dressing at all and my salad had dressing on it (even though I asked for it on the side) Salads  were fine but the entrées were terrible!  My spicy chicken pasta was bland, so I ordered some jalapeños to spice it up.

Jon B.,"Richmond, VA",185,220,192,1.0,8/18/2012,"There are some mistakes people shouldn't make in life. One mistake a person could make is trying to climb a tree in the middle of a thunder storm. Another mistake a person could make is going to Cheesecake factory, pulling out some cheeseburgers from McDonald's and only asking the server for plenty of free water and napkins. My mistake was going to this particular T.G.I. Fridays on a Friday night.  Without further delay, here is my review. The good: Um... the food that I ordered was hot The bad: Everything else- I arrived at this Friday's with a date around 9:45pm last night. As expected, the place was a mad house. As I walked through the front door, I couldnt help but notice that a member of Chesterfield's finest was walking right behind me. Though I didnt have any outstanding warrants or smell like Marijuana, the presence of a police officer to serve as security inside a restaurant should have been a precursor for bad things to come.  When in the lobby, I noticed that there was no hostess to greet customers, yet there were about 8 customers waiting to be seated. My date and I made our way to the bar area only to find that the bar was completely full to the point where people were aimlessly standing around in the area, blocking any paths to get to the bartender. So we made our way back to the lobby area which had cleared out by that time, more than likely because some customers just walked out. But my date wanted to stay so I took a big sigh, and waited for the invisible hostess to appear. 5 minutes later, the manager appears, greets us and finds the hostess to have us seated. We are seated and thats where the fun begins.  Once seated, 10 minutes passed until we saw our server. Luckily the preseason NFL game was on during the wait period, but as soon as 10:00pm hit, a DJ started playing deafening Hip Hop music throughout the restaurant. It was at that time that I realized why the police officer was standing near the restaurant's enterance. Fast forward to the servers initial appearance. By the time the server finally arrives, we give the server our drink orders and order food. The server magically disappears and reappears about 7 minutes later with the drinks. My food was brought out about 25 minutes after ordering and though it was hot, my patience had already worn thin with the bad service and club music being played through the restaurant. The server never once looked at my empty cup and asked if I needed a refill. So indeed this experience could only be described as 100% FRESHLY SQUEEZED BOOTY JUICE!!! Overall:  I've been to this particular Friday's during regular hours and had better experiences when the crowd sizes are normal. Granted the restaurant had a full house last night, I feel that the management could have been more organized and the service could have been better. But the next time I see a police officer just posting up near a door in a chain restaurant, I will know to carry myself right back out the door.  ONE STAR.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-richmond-5?start=20

Michael G.,"Richmond, VA",79,9,,2.0,8/12/2015,"Sunday I had experience I'd rather have foregone.  Since the McDonald's CEO closed Famous Dave's I have been seeking good dry rub ribs.  With Fridays about a month ago, I thought perhaps I had succeeded, as on that visit I ordered the Memphis Ribs full rack.  Memphis means dry rub, no wet sauces added, and that was what I had. At that time I ordered the cole slaw, a mistake I'll not repeat.  On This past Sunday's visit, I ordered the Memphis Ribs again, but this time they were soaked in sauces and the rub wasn't ""rubbed"" just sprinkled over the top. Not satisfied, I asked for the manager.. (Chris Winder) he was on duty.  When I explained the problem all he said was this is how we always do them, to which I replied they weren't done this way last time. He insisted I was wrong (I'm a liar) and I said fine. As he seemed to want to carry on further I asked him to please leave, as we had finished our ""conversation"".

Adam B.,"Norfolk, VA",10,2,,1.0,1/18/2015,"Some friends and I went to this fine establishment after a long day of boozing on the golf course . We were already buzzed so any kind of food covered in hot sauce and ranch would make us happy. We walk in and took our seat at the bar. We immediately were overwhelmed by the smell. It smelled like that stuff they use to clean up puke on the school bus. I decided to tough it out and only breathe through my mouth. As I sat down my forearms stuck to the bar. The bar keep came over and took our orders. I ordered a liquor drink and the dude went into some sketchy corner to make our drinks. The drink wasn't terrible so we decided to order some grub. We all ordered the trio like a bunch of fat kids. The bar keep didn't write any of our orders down. We knew immediately we were doomed. As he punched our orders in the computer he turned to us and retook our orders. There was no way this was going to be right. We sat there waiting for our food, while using our shirts as gas masks. Whenever they opened the front doors the breeze would gag us. The food finally comes out and all four of us had our orders wrong. Not only were they wrong but they were not even close. We didn't care. We had to get out of there before somebody we knew came on and caught us. So we paid our tabs and left. Today I sit on the toilet trying to get this food out of my body. I am sweating, cramping and deciding if I should send TGI Fridays a bill for the clothes I had to burn as a result of the smell. In closing, this place is awful. Don't go.

Leandro P.,"Fort Lee, VA",4,5,,1.0,2/27/2013,"Went to this establishment about a week ago because my wife and I eat T.G.I's back home. I have to say this was the worst place I have ate at in a long time. I ordered a burger and the meat was completely over cooked, my wife ordered the bulgogi tacos and the meat in that was burnt also. The reason I even gave this place 1 star is because the manager came out and checked our food and took the items off our bill. Then gave my wife's replacement meal to us for free, so she ordered a rueben which was so greasy that by time we made it home my wife was sick. Over all HORRIBLE experience, will never return to that location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-richmond-5?start=20
