Dan N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",290,168,204,3.0,1/12/2018,"Came here because I was gifted a 25$ gift card, so decided to try it out. Ehhh nothing really stood out about this place thus the three star rating, I truly believe it is a pure average restaurant.  The server wasn't the best but she wasn't terrible, the food was okay but not great, and the prices were fair. I got the lobster tail with broccoli and rice and share a bit of a burger. The lobster seasoning was too bland and the broccoli was a little overcooked. The burger was decent but nothing really stood out about it, just a regular burger. The fries weren't too fresh either.  Overall, just an average restaurant to go to if you really feel in the mood for American divey bar type food. I am impressed however that they have new technology in the bar area where you can call your server or pay on a tablet, probably to better the service, which I thought was pretty neat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3
Stephanie M.,"Riverside, CA",41,153,35,2.0,12/31/2017,Worst steak ever! Over cooked full of fat! Broccoli was over cooked as well. This goes for both mine and my hubbys plate.  I've been to this Friday's before but never had issues like I did this time. Drinks are always good and service was decent hence the 2 stars but other then that this is at least the 2nd or 3rd times (tried to give them a chance to get a better review) I've come to this particular location and this will be the last time.

We ordered the Ultimate Margarita which was tasty and a tall beer which came out to over 10, then we had appetizers which were good. The Loaded Nachos are to mention, great picks.

Sunday is all day happy hour. Yippie!  [Our Order] Traditional wings with Jack Daniels sauce on the side: wings are so delicious with the JD sauce combination  Basket of fries: one u taste one u can't help but finish the whole dang basket. 5 bottles of beer.  Our order altogether came out to $27. I am loving these happy hour deals. We plan on coming in again to catch other games during football season. [Customer Service] Even though it was a little loud and busy our bartender did a great job taking our orders and bringing our orders out quickly. Also, reminding us about the happy hour deals. Oh!

Tim R.,"Corona, CA",33,65,144,1.0,11/29/2017,"In the past I have enjoyed my experiences at other TGI Fridays. I usually order the endless apps and have rarely been disappointed.  I went to the Tyler Tgi Fridays on Monday 11/27 at 748pm and my server was Anthony. My server never checked to see if the food was good and fresh when it arrived. He didn't bring us water till the second course. He was not attentive.  Now for the food, which was subpar and not up to the standards of the TGI at Dos Lagos.  The 5 buffalo wings arrived cold and the potato skins were not loaded but had a spinkle of cheese and bacon. On the second round I ordered the Jack Daniels wings and Fried Mozz. The wings tasted like a bad chinese cracker, in that they were over cooked or in the warming lamps too long. The wings were overly chewy and tasted bad.  My girlfriend  avoided the wings after trying mine. Her loaded potato skins, pot stickers, and Fried Mozz came out fine.  It is absolutely unacceptable to serve cold wings. Let alone old wings. If I'm paying 15$ each for unlimited apps then I expect quality. My server never asked how the food was and was unavailable most of the night. Suffice it to say that I wont come back for the endless apps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3

It's a shame they don't properly grill the top as the bread is just sloppy and gross, even though it tastes fine.

My favorite was the jack Daniel wings and my boyfriends favorite was the mozeralla sticks. Even though I tried eveything, I wasn't fond of how they tasted, so question is, is it worth it? Yes and no. I got fully off of trying eveything which I didn't really enjoy most. Other than that, if I had only ordered the wings itself, then definitely worth the price because they are endless!

And pickles on the side.  The sandwich came with sauce and no pickles. Then server Jackie argued that it's supposed to come with it. When we specifically asked for it to be taken out.

As I've dined at this location several times, never before have I been inclined to due a review on this location until now. My server Andrew ""Drew"" was AWESOME! He truly made our night. Hadn't been out with friends in some time, he attended to our needs and kept our refills coming along with planning ahead for the endless appetizers. He knew the menu, was very friendly and super chill, he engaged in conversation and never gave us the impression he was too busy to answer a question about the menu or a drink or anything else for that matter. He checked in with us regularly and even when he was busy and someone else brought a dish to our table he would come to the table shortly after and make sure that the dish was indeed the correct dish and prepared correctly.

They never come with your drinks on time and they aren't seen during the entire meal. If you ever want do the endless apps don't the food comes out super late and cold on top of that. The wings are never covered in sauce, I'm literally just eating chicken nuggets. If I wanted that I would have gone to McDonald's. All in all don't come to this TGI Fridays, there is a Cheesecake factory close by.  Management needs to ensure servers are not lounging on the sides on their phones. It seems like they are leaving food up on the counter for a while until they bring it out. Overall management needs to have more of an eye over their employees and making sure they are on top of their duties. If not I might as well get up and get the food myself.

Paulina R.,"Norco, CA",71,37,26,1.0,11/20/2016,"I am so disgustingly upset it's not even funny. In the past 7 years that we have been coming here we have NEVER had such ghastly service.  We decided to meet up with a couple of friends for date night (normally do TGFI or Applebee's), we decided on here because it was closer to home plus we've always enjoyed it today however, it was most likely the last time we'll be coming here.  We met up here at 6:00 PM we put our name down they had said about 25-30 mins. so far so good, my friend and I went to the ladies room while the guys waited for a table, we just so happened to come out and find and empty table at the bar so we took it.  As soon as we arrived Anthony our server made sure our table was clean and got us started with our drinks. At the time we ordered drinks we also ordered some appetizers because c'mon happy hour all day on Sunday is a must. We got our fries and cool we're catching up etc. Anthony came by to see if we were ready for food and so we ordered.  It's now about 7:06 PM and food started coming out but one of our friend is still waiting for the mozzarella sticks he initially ordered when we got there. We had no silverware, plates, or napkins, and we only had 2 menus for the 4 of us. (1 hour for an appetizer, like really?)  At this point we're pretty upset because some food came out first then the other we're playing the waiting game so we can all eat together but by then our burgers got cold and bread got mushy but whatever we called our server on the tablets provided light went off FOREVER and no one ever came, he eventually walked by and we asked for the manager. Trudy came out (did not look like the manager, she does not look one bit professional) and asked what was wrong, we explained how the service had been horrifying all night and how we were still waiting on an appetizer that was ordered over an hour ago, how drinks hadn't been offered for another round, and etc. She went off to show us to look around and tried to blame a big party for the lack of attention on our table. She said she'd take the appetizer off our bill and talk to the server, we explained how no one had came when we called for service so she put the light on herself and left. Okay.. So here we are sitting again like idiots waiting for our checks it's about 7:36 PM and we saw Anthony walked by and asked him to please get Trudy again because we're frankly quiet confused as to what's going on, we lost our appetites and by now we all just want to leave. Our date night was just ruined. She comes back and asked what's wrong(this time she seemed bothered), we said well we're waiting for our checks and to see what you're gonna do about this terrible experience. We let her know that this by far has been the worst experience I the past 7 years we've been coming here, she went off to say she had never seen us in ALL the years she's been there, irrelevant and so what? Am I lying now? Do I need to go back in my feeds and bank account to prove myself.. I don't think so. It's the truth. She said she had already called corporate and the general manager and that she had already talked to Anthony, my husband told her he'd call back to follow up but we did let her know we most likely wouldn't be back and that we didn't refuse to pay but it was unacceptable that she was making us pay for all our bill and not even apologize. As ridiculously as it may seem an apology would've been greatly appreciated.   My husband explained to her that he works at a restaurant and understands but there's things that are simply unacceptable. He let her know we were aware they couldn't do anything about the drinks but could definitely work out something with our food considering we didn't even really eat from how upset we all were. She went and took of the burgers and came back had me sign the receipt and disappeared.  We simply just left, like I said at least an apology would've been nice. For 7 years all 4 of us have been coming here and we have never had such a horrific experience with the service and management, it is frankly a shame. There goes 4 loyal customers. Years of anniversaries and birthdays.. I'm still in shock.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=40

Sy M.,"Southern California, CA",35,74,660,2.0,7/11/2015,"Today was the second time we've tried this place and we were disappointed again. The service is really bad. It's almost like the servers here are really lazy because our sever was barely around and when we did see him he looked like he was just strolling around.  My husband wanted to leave a small tip because of the service but I still left 15% because I feel bad leaving less than that.  Now for the food - The side house salads with ranch are pretty good. The breadstick that comes with the salad is delicious!  My husband ordered the Jack Daniel's steak and ribs with a side of mashed potatoes and Mac N Cheese. The ribs were terrible and the steak was just okay. However, the Jack Daniel's sauce is delicious! The mashed potatoes are fairly bland but the Mac N Cheese is SOOO good! I could eat the Mac N Cheese by itself.  This is the only reason I gave this place 2 stars.  For dessert I ordered the Oreo Madness and it was a complete mess! The ice cream was all melted and the presentation was horrible! I've had it before at other Friday's and it never looked like this.

Cheyenne B.,"Riverside, CA",13,30,3,3.0,4/26/2016,"Decent place to get a quick bite after a movie or after the mall, nothing serious. The bar seating can be confusing. I always sit in the bar lounge area and the last time i went, this waiter made us move because he claimed no one under 21 can sit in the lounge area. I wasn't there to drink nor did i bring an ID (i didn't think id need it) and my fiancé wasn't either even tho he had his ID. We've been there together and separate multiple times and even when we've sat at the bar it's never been an issue..at ANY fridays location. Sooo. I have no clue. But if its a night out..we're not trying to sit in with the families and 16 year olds...but we'll see what happens next time.

Nancy R.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,41,15,5.0,3/27/2016,"This review is solely for the security guard who in reality allows this place to earn every profit possible. Walked in on a Saturday happy hour night, all chairs taken, no tables. None of the workers for TGIF bothered to approach my party of 4, instead they ignored the fact that we had to stand versus having us take a seat elsewhere and move us into bar as the area opened up. But to their benefit, their security guard was smart enough to make this type of decision and committed to his job, explained to us we can sit in the porch area, enjoy our happy our specials and he would personally walk us back to the bar as soon as something else opened. Yes sit outside as you would anyhow yet you are able to order drink :)! Hello TGIF! Your security guard is making every minute count, TGIF personnel should do the same! Props to the security guard because if it wasn't for him we would have left. Who wants to stand around without a drink? No one! Workers keep in mind, every person you sit is money! All reviewers here complain about wait times yet the security guard has given you not only a solution a profitable one too! It did not take any more than 10 minutes before the security came back for us with an open table in the bar area. By then we had already ordered a full round plus an appetizer...  If anyone comes by here I suggest you check in with security guard, have him sit you outside, take a beer, A drink whatever it is to get your night going, and before you know it your back inside.  We left at last call, as we walked out once again the security guard was helping the workers pick up umbrellas outside, gather chairs. He is not part of TGIF yet he's profiting every minute that goes by for them! It's only fair to give credit to the one person making this place happen, that is security guard Jae.. Not sure if I spelled out your name correctly, the man with long pulled back black hair. Thumbs up and great job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=40
Marissa G.,"Redondo Beach, CA",307,567,134,1.0,6/5/2015,"Hadn't been to a TGIF in at least five years. I wish it had stayed that way.  We came on Wednesday night. Despite the ""it's always Friday"" mantra they push in their commercials, the atmosphere was dead and they were playing emo music. We were tortured with Taking Back Sunday-type whiny music the whole time we ate. Not very Friday. The worst part was the food. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and my cousin had the club. Our food took forever to come out. When it finally arrived, my fries were wrapped in a little packet of brown paper and my cousin's weren't. Also, mine were cold, tough and chewy so I'm guessing mine were portioned out from an old batch and then thrown under a heat lamp or something. Hers were hot and fresh and not in a packet.  The sandwiches were a total disappointment. Both came on a ciabatta roll, which is entirely too much dry, hard bread to eat. My pathetic sandwich was literally just the chicken, two end pieces of a mealy tomato and approximately five slivers of shredded lettuce. It was roughly 1/4 meat and 3/4 dry bread. No spread or anything. Even after slathering on the accompanying blue cheese dressing (which had no blue cheese or flavor), the bread was still tough to get down. I guess you could say the food matched the atmosphere - dry and tough to withstand. I'd be happy to go another five years before visiting a TGIF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=40

Everyone around us seem to have eaten their appetizers and received their food! The customer service was terrible and so was the food!

Carlos V.,"Riverside, CA",0,6,,1.0,7/30/2016,"If I could give negative stars after tonight's experience I definitely would!!!!!! This place hasn't been bad before me and my buddies have been here a few times and always get great service from Yesenia by the bar area. It does get a bit busy at the bar so food tends to take a little longer but your drink is rarely empty which is a good thing because time flies by.  BUT THIS TIME we decided to sit outside to change the scenery. We got there about 10:15 pm and there's only one party of 4 people sitting outside so it was great. We get there Alyssa approaches us and takes our drink orders which we all order water because it was hot. Then about 10:30 we put a food order which we are think in about 20 minutes food should come great. At 10:45 a big group of people come and start to disturb the people around us so they decided to leave, once they left they started to get louder and annoying. At about 10:50 an other waitress comes out and asked us if everything we ok i told her no because our food wasn't there yet. She said let me check on it comes back with an appetizer 20 minutes into waitng. About 5 minutes go by and Alyssa comes back and tells us that she isn't going to be our waitress anymore and that Omar is going to take over because they are moving her to be the main waitress for the big annoying party we said that was fine and food should come out quickly.  So we sat there waiting at about 11:15 I had enough of waiting so when our waiter come out I told him to check on the food but by this time I was really upset. Comes back at 11:25 and says they are still waiting on the chicken we order. So I told him cancel the order we are leaving. His response was let me get a manager I told him no because there was no point if they were going to mistreat customers that were waiting there.  They don't care about hard working people who  just got done working out and just want a good meal, rather cater to the loud drunk crowd who probably don't even know the definition of gratuity.

Apps delivered with no plates for us to eat off. If you want to have a conversation, the bar is not the place. They turn the volume up on the TV's because sports is more important than the  non sport enthusiast.  Asked for one check and they split it between the 3 of us. Then when we tried to use the table tablet, they took it away from us.l If you dont want customers to use, then dont offer the convenience.

Paulina R.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,3,3,1.0,7/10/2016,"I am so disgustingly upset it's not even funny. In the past 7 years that we have been coming here we have NEVER had such ghastly service.  We decided to meet up with a couple of friends for date night (normally do TGFI or Applebee's), we decided on here because it was closer to home plus we've always enjoyed it today however, it was most likely the last time we'll be coming here.  We met up here at 6:00 PM we put our name down they had said about 25-30 mins. so far so good, my friend and I went to the ladies room while the guys waited for a table, we just so happened to come out and find and empty table at the bar so we took it.  As soon as we arrived Anthony our server made sure our table was clean and got us started with our drinks. At the time we ordered drinks we also ordered some appetizers because c'mon happy hour all day on Sunday is a must. We got our fries and cool we're catching up etc. Anthony came by to see if we were ready for food and so we ordered.  It's now about 7:06 PM and food started coming out but one of our friend is still waiting for the mozzarella sticks he initially ordered when we got there. We had no silverware, plates, or napkins, and we only had 2 menus for the 4 of us. (1 hour for an appetizer, like really?)  At this point we're pretty upset because some food came out first then the other we're playing the waiting game so we can all eat together but by then our burgers got cold and bread got mushy but whatever we called our server on the tablets provided light went off FOREVER and no one ever came, he eventually walked by and we asked for the manager. Trudy came out (did not look like the manager, she does not look one bit professional) and asked what was wrong, we explained how the service had been horrifying all night and how we were still waiting on an appetizer that was ordered over an hour ago, how drinks hadn't been offered for another round, and etc. She went off to show us to look around and tried to blame a big party for the lack of attention on our table. She said she'd take the appetizer off our bill and talk to the server, we explained how no one had came when we called for service so she put the light on herself and left. Okay.. So here we are sitting again like idiots waiting for our checks it's about 7:36 PM and we saw Anthony walked by and asked him to please get Trudy again because we're frankly quiet confused as to what's going on, we lost our appetites and by now we all just want to leave. Our date night was just ruined. She comes back and asked what's wrong(this time she seemed bothered), we said well we're waiting for our checks and to see what you're gonna do about this terrible experience. We let her know that this by far has been the worst experience I the past 7 years we've been coming here, she went off to say she had never seen us in ALL the years she's been there, irrelevant and so what? Am I lying now? Do I need to go back in my feeds and bank account to prove myself.. I don't think so. It's the truth. She said she had already called corporate and the general manager and that she had already talked to Anthony, my husband told her he'd call back to follow up but we did let her know we most likely wouldn't be back and that we didn't refuse to pay but it was unacceptable that she was making us pay for all our bill and not even apologize. As ridiculously as it may seem an apology would've been greatly appreciated.   My husband explained to her that he works at a restaurant and understands but there's things that are simply unacceptable. He let her know we were aware they couldn't do anything about the drinks but could definitely work out something with our food considering we didn't even really eat from how upset we all were. She went and took of the burgers and came back had me sign the receipt and disappeared.  We simply just left, like I said at least an apology would've been nice. For 7 years all 4 of us have been coming here and we have never had such a horrific experience with the service and management, it is frankly a shame. There goes 4 loyal customers. Years of anniversaries and birthdays.. I'm still in shock.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=60

I liked the new kiosk at the table were you can pay when your ready, doesn't give a receipt though the waitress had to bring the print out.

When a group of young people came in and sat near me at the bar. The intoxicated man approach them make rude comment to them well one of the males from the party ask him to please leave , he was trying to enjoy his evening.  When the intoxicated man struck him and drop his beer class. Other customers got in between b4 the Manger made it to the floor. Rite away you can tell she know the intoxicated man some how. She quickly over reacted to the victims of the  situation and ask them to go out side well the intoxicated man was allowed to stay in the restaurant. And the Manger never once ask the intoxicated man to exit the restaurant. Well as much larger man walks by him he get into another argument with him. Still the Manger put my life and other customers in danger by allowing him to stay in the restaurant.  1 they served him way to much and didn't cut him off the Manger waited till the 2nd fight was going to start. After he Cleary assaulted someone on the restaurants grounds I will no longer dine there cause lack of proper management and bartender training knowing to put ppl safety b4 friendship or tips witch ever the case may be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=80

I wanted my sweet tooth satisfied and get a bit buzz as well so it was a double whammy. Rating 4/5 ($8) Their spinach artichoke cheese dip was pretty good as well. It came out in a big plate, the chips were a little too hard for me but I enjoyed it this appetizer. Rating 3/5  Their service was so-so, out waiter was Eric and he forgot our utensils and napkins.

Then I ordered soup and my husband an appetizer and that took a good 30 minutes. The French onion soup was really good. My meal came which was the summer orchard salad and it was just disgusting-not like the description at all. I'm pregnant so little things gross me out.  1. The amount of chicken on the salad was minuscule.  2. I sent the chicken back because it was pink and wet in the middle. Not good for pregnancy. 3. The amount of spinach on the plate was overflowing. 4. The dressing tasted so bland. 5. There was no fruit other then maybe 10 slivers of green apple. There was supposed to be apricots and grapes. 6. I almost broke a tooth on the hard nuts on it. Overall I won't be coming back. My husband liked the endless appetizer selection, but the salad sucked. Our waitress tried but she was too slow. We still left a 15% tip because she was courteous about my chicken.  Won't be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=80

When we finally tracked our waitress down she would only say they were both 6oz. Now anyone can see that its half the size so we asked for the manager.          Pedro the manager came and was so rude! (If you don't know how to handle customers don't be a manager) he just keeped saying that we got a 6oz steak and asking our friend (who got the bigger steak) if he was happy. As we keeped pushing the point that we were the unhappy ones he just said enjoy your meal and left mid conversation. What manager does that? We weren't looking for a hand out, just an equal steak but there was no offer to accommodate us just arguing.

Jeannae B.,"Victorville, CA",1,15,,1.0,7/5/2015,"I typically do not frequent the area where this TGIF is located but because my cousin and I were staying at the Mission Inn for the 4th of July weekend we ate here. On July 3rd we visited the restaurant. We weren't seated immediately so we went to the bar area. About 15-20 went by and we were called to our table. We already knew what we wanted to order. I had my ""FREE"" entrée to jumpstart your July 4th weekend.  I specifically asked the waiter what qualified as an entree and he answered ""everything""; great, we ordered steak and lobster. We waited sometime before the food came but it finally arrived. Our steaks were ordered to be cooked medium well but they were tough as leather. I sent the steak back and once again it's taking forever ( we had tickets to see Magic Mike, didn't want to be late ). It was taking so long the manager sent the waiter (Demetrius was covering for our regular waiter) over to offer us a dessert courtesy of him. Finally, the steak came and was quite tasty. We are ready to leave and OMG it's taking FOREVER!!!!!! The waiter brings our check (the original waiter). I review it but it doesn't seem right. I question the waiter and tell him we had a coupon, the cake was complimentary and the steak replaced the first steak. He left and came back and said what we ordered did not qualify , he said it's his fault and told his manager that. He re-created the receipt, which reduced the bill to half. Though our experience was very disappointing I left an 18% gratuity. Today, July 5, I checked my bank account and he charged me the original amount. WHAT!!!

Patrick M.,"Riverside, CA",319,151,186,3.0,5/31/2014,"I don't like giving bad reviews. Unless you are like Miguel's Jr. where there is no way you can change unless you throw away your recipe and start fresh with ""real"" guacamole, I tend to waiver on the high side when it comes to my ratings. If it is service I will usually come back and see if the service is the same. We all have bad days, and customers can be jerks, so I won't write a bad review about service unless it is something real crazy.  Yesterday, the service was fine, but the food was just ok. Not even A-OK. Just ok. Besides mix match socks with holes, I really dislike food that doesn't look like the pictures on the menu. Main reason why me and Subway don't get along. Though we do squash our beef long enough for me to get a meatball sub. But other then that, if Subway is thristy walking down the street and I have a glass of water, I would pour it out before I give it to subway... fix your stuff Subway!!!!.  Anyway, Friday, or T.G.I. Friday. (Do anyway even call them that?) Really failed when it came to the food. And I was bummed because the picture was so darn awesome looking. I ordered the Blue Cheese Stacked Burger, and the picture looked so darn good. I swear I could have ate the menu. Matter of fact, all of the stacked burgers looked extremely tasty on the menu. So I ordered that. My date ordered the Sizzling Chicken & Cheese.  I ordered my usual drink if they have it (Guinness). It was flat... kind of old tasting, but I am actually used to that. One day I will go to Ireland to get it fresh but right now, I will take it how I get it.  My burger came out and I thought I got the wrong order. It was small. It didn't look like a stacked burger at all. Actually was no bigger than a Quarter Pounder at McDonalds. And I was handed about 8 fries... maybe 9. The fact that I could visually count the fries once they were handed to me was clearly a problem. If the burger came as advertise I wouldn't have noticed, but it looked sort of sad. I tasted it, and it was ok. Carl Jr's new burgers with home baked bread tasted better and that is no bueno!! (I had to order the basket of fries afterwards because I was still hungry... that is unusual for me at Friday's) My date said her Sizzling Chicken and Cheese was ok. And that was pretty much the theme. We both felt it was just ok. I have had burgers from Friday/T.G.I. Friday before and it has been better. I was going to take a picture and send it to my friends but once the burger came out I was no way going to send that sad excuse of a stacked burger to anyone. The only thing that prevented me from 2 starring them was the Goose Island IPA I received. Strong and fresh. And that is lame. A beer you don't even make killed it. Because Friday/T.G.I.Friday is a chain, I won't say I will never go back. I am really tempted to go to another location to see if the Stacked burger is better.

Corey G.,"Riverside, CA",0,26,,1.0,3/29/2016,"This is specific to this TGIF and not the chain as a whole.  Horrible food and service. 2 visits ago, we were told the wait would be 30 minutes for a table of 5. We ended waiting 1:15. I understand the wait times not being an exact science, but that was way too far off from the estimated wait time. To make matters worse, when we got our table for 5, it was actually a table for 4 with an extra chair added. The seating was cramped and uncomfortable. The service was slow. The food was pretty much what you expected except my kids spaghetti was cold and had to send it back. It's bad when you can't get a child's spaghetti right.  I wrote a complaint to their website and got a call back from corp. They apologized for the experience and offered a $25 gift card. That was much appreciated as it showed they valued their customers and their feedback. We headed back a few weeks later with our gift card. My wife ordered a breaded chicken salad. The chicken was so tough and overdone that she couldn't cut if with a knife. I called the waitress over to complain and she said sorry and that she would let her manager know. I don't know if she never told the manager or if the manager didn't care, but the next exchange we had was when she handed us the check. I tried to pay using the $25 gift card (it was actually emailed to me and the instructions were to show this email). When I showed her the email on my phone, she took my phone to look at it and then walked away with my phone without saying anything. I wasn't comfortable with her taking my phone so I followed her towards the kitchen to retrieve my phone. The manager took the $25 off my bill but never offered any apology or asked how anything was. I actually regret not complaining more about the chicken, I shouldn't have paid for that.  I'm not a big fan of TGIF in general but its ok and I usually know what to expect.

She was very rude & immature (funny because she's an old sloppy looking grandma type) I will never return here thank To her. My advice to upper management, she used to be a server, keep her as a server or even janitor (perfect fit) management is NOT for everyone. This was all over a coupon from their loyalty program that the manager refused to honor. Don't send me coupons, emails anymore if your company is too greedy & dirty to not accept them.

However, why one TV was required to stay on Spanish novellas at a bar was beyond me.

Sida B.,"Irvine, CA",58,129,689,3.0,11/19/2011,"If there's anything that any server should always make note of, it's this: tell your patrons that certain things cost extra. For instance, if the soup or salad isn't complementary with the meal, you should notify them. Our server, while he was good, left out that soup and salad were an additional $2.99 each. I was a little confused at first because I didn't remember seeing my $20 for 1 appetizer, 2 courses, and 1 dessert option, I thought I just missed it so my bf and I ordered the soup and salad. It wasn't until we got our bill back that I realized they had charged us extra. Please, just tell us next time? I really didn't need that extra food and if I knew it was going to be extra, I would've just not ordered it.  On the bright side, our server was great enough to give us all separate checks (for a group of 10) and also making sure he got his tip (automatic gratuity included for large parties).  I also want to point out, TGIF, is that the birthday boy called the day before to make a reservation, and you informed him that he can come back the day after at 7 to get a table at 7:30, which he did. However, you didn't note this down, and the new maître d' had no idea what was going on and told him the wait would be 1 hour. I drove an hour and 45 min all the way to Riverside to celebrate a friend's birthday, and you're telling me I have to wait longer? Bad customer service TGIF. Gotta work on that.  So how is this review still holding a 3 star? Well, the service wasn't that bad, the music was popping, and the food was pretty good. Foodwise, they've definitely improved since the last time I went to a TGIF in Irvine. I was very happy about that.  My bf and I did the special deal of $20 for 1 appetizer (CRISPY GREEN BEAN FRIES), 2 entrees (DRAGONFIRE SALMON and BRUCHETTA CHICKEN PASTA), and 1 dessert (BROWNIE OBSESSION). The green bean fries were delicious! Granted they are battered and deep fried and you really can't go wrong with that combo, it didn't taste overly oily and the wasabi ranch dip was perfect. Not a bad way into tricking someone who hates veggies to try this.  The dragonfire salmon was TGIF's ""portion control"" item and it was pretty good considering it was one of their lowest caloric options on the menu and the pineapple pico de gallo and mandarin oranges gave the chicken and rice a nice little oriental kick. I did wish the chicken was marinated more, as it was a little dry.  My bf's bruchetta chicken pasta was ""portion control"" item as well. He didn't know, otherwise he probably wouldn't have gotten it willingly haha. Marinara, chicken, and angel hair is a pretty good combination of balanced carb and protein meal. Pretty good for a chain restaurant.  Lastly, our brownie obsession..I don't even know where to begin. DELICIOUS. I think they let it sit a little before serving it to us, because the ice cream was nearly melted when we got it. But the brownie was still warm and nothing pairs as well as warm brownies and cold ice cream. Everyone on my side of the table had a taste and everyone gave it a thumbs up.  As for the soup and salad? Generic and not worth the money. The birthday boy enjoyed his Mudslide (every birthday boy deserves a free drink from his friends...come on!) and he said it was yummy.  My bf also had some LOADED POTATO SKINS and despite the ginormous caloric intake (2000!!), it was delicious, and artery-clogging.  But seriously, all restaurants need to chill with their alcoholic beverage pricing. $10 for a drink is steep. I mean, I know I pay that much for a shot of patron at a club, but the last time I did that I licked someone's boobs. I mean...just saying.

Adam M.,"Anaheim, CA",0,3,1,1.0,8/17/2016,"This is the first 1 star review that I have written. Let me start by saying I typically enjoy going to Fridays especially for happy hour to grab some drinks but today was not our usual enjoyable time. Very disappointed by the service my girlfriend and I experienced today. When we were given our menu's my girlfriend and I flipped to the very back page for the 4,7 menu and when our waitress arrived to take our order we ordered from that menu. I ordered the Cobb grilled chicken salad and my girlfriend had the chicken bruchetta pasta. Our meal was tasty and we also had the ultimate Margarita and ultimate long Island which were good. Then things just went down hill, we placed a second order of drinks which took about 20 minutes and we had 3 other employees ask us if we needed drinks but we assured them our waitress was handling it after the wait for our drinks we were ready to leave and when the bill came our waitress charged us for the regular priced dishes when we ordered from the 7 and up menu. I mentioned it to our waitress and she told us that we were wrong and those items weren't on the 7 and up menu. Clearly they are!! When I told her they are on the menu she said it was our fault for not telling her which menu we were ordering from. I ended up paying the full amount when I should have just asked for a manager instead. After all that we just asked for a to go box which took another 15 min for 1 box...ridiculous. We will not be going back to this Fridays horrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=140

Will H.,"Corona, CA",16,211,,2.0,6/24/2013,"Was always wondering why this place had such a lousy 2.5-star rating until I dined there recently.  Except for the wonderful and enthusiastic service by Bethany, the rest of the meal was pretty forgettable: 1.  Honey BBQ boneless chicken wings were very yummy and definitely the highlight of the meal. 2. Potato skins unremarkable with NO consistency as to cheese and bacon topping ratios.  Some had plenty of each and some had almost none.  Looked like the chef just tossed handfuls at random. 3. Chicken Flatbread was soggy and horrible and was sent back.  The chef and manager here should go to Chilis, which has a FAB California chicken and avocado flatbread. Other issues: WHY does TGIF continue to lack full transparency in the pricing of almost ALL drinks on its menu other than wines?  This is a disturbing growing trend among chain restaurants to HIDE the fact that those $1.50 soft drinks, milk, coffee, lemonade, juice etc. are now $2.50 to $2.99.....a monumental rip-off.  Even worse are the drinks you THINK are perhaps $5 and then you get your check and they are 60% higher.... AND.....when the  male host comes by your table and says:  ""How's everything going BOSS?"".....I just want to cringe.  We are NOT on a plantation and I am NOT your boss!! This SAME thing happened at the TGIF at Dos Lagos not long ago.....   Why has it become soooo commonplace at almost ALL low and mid-priced restaurants these days to address the customers as ""Boss"", ""Bro"", ""Buddy"" and ""Dude""?......Nothing is acceptable except for ""SIR"".  Why does management allow this to continue?? Seven of the last 8 dining experiences at different restaurants had male servers addressing me by the SAME slang terms.....Just a pathetic way to address any customer....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=140

Now for the downside we have had several large parties with family for birthdays and they don't take reservations. We were just there on Saturday May 31st at 4pm for a birthday party with 15 people. We waited over an hour and a half to be seated. In the meantime at least 50 people in groups between 3-6 were seated ahead of us.

Paige C.,"Riverside, CA",0,3,1,1.0,8/28/2016,I went there with my family. We sat in the bar area during happy hour time. We ordered some apps and drinks. The service was awful. The server did not bother to pre-buss our table and it took about 15 mins to get our drinks. We ordered 3 20 ounce bud lights on happy hour. When we got our bill we had 5 bud lights on our bill. I asked her if she could please take off the other two because they weren't ours. The server Yessenia went on to tell us they were ours and they were rang in every 15mins. We were there for almost two hours. If they were rang in every 15mins we should of had a lot more. She went on to say they were ours but if we want to talk to a manager that we could. So the managers name was Matt and he basically accused us of lying and said they were rang in every 15mins. But said he would take it off this once as if he was doing us a favor when it wasn't our drinks. As he walked away he said well my name is Matt if u wanna make a complaint with a smirk on his face. We were 150% know those 2 extra 20 oz bud lights werent ours. As a food server myself for almost 10 years. I am appalled by the way I was treated and the service me and my family received. This is not ok and I don't want this to happen to someone else.

Wendy B.,"Corona, CA",1658,2025,7089,4.0,7/15/2013,"After a decade of boycotting and having a mostly justifiable paranoia about chain restaurants, I had to give TGIF a chance. The main reason...we had a large group of family coming down to visit a loved one in the Kaiser hospital nearby.  With all our eclectic tastes, we needed a place that could offer variation, would serve later than 9 pm, could manage our bunch of demanding foodies, and was close to the hospital. TGIF filled that bill.  The menu was page after page of interesting and well thought out dishes.  Damn! That made choosing hard. Mind you, nothing really fancy, just down home food that sooths the savage soul.  The 3 item appetizer combo was semi-decent.  It came with a platter of flatbread that had plenty of cheese, tomato, basil that I found to be delicious.  Also, the buffalo wings were equally wonderful.  The only let down was the mozzarella sticks with marinara that were mostly missing the mozzarella. It came out to be more of a hollow bread pocket. On the bright side, they would have made excellent edible finger puppets. While I really did not check out everyone else's level of satisfaction on this visit, the steakhouse burger was fat, juicy and nicely med rare.  Mr. B was stunned at how delicious it was.  My Bruchetta Chicken Pasta was also quite good, herbal, tomatoey, cheesy with a balsamic drizzle finish. And my only problem was quickly solved when they took back the diminutive chicken breast that I felt was overcooked, no questions asked, and brought me another that was tender, moist, bigger, and had a good grilled flavor. But as another reviewer (Will H) has surmised about the origin of the poultry, I believe he was spot on. Neither of the breasts were very hot, so could not have been freshly cooked from a raw state. I believe Costco also sells those in bulk in a freezer bag, grill marks and all. Not bad, but not original. My favorite touch? The Parmesan fries that came with the burger. Fat steak fries drizzled with a garlic butter and cheese.  Oh my goodness, should I tell you?  I am so picky. And they turned me on. They should be outlawed for breaking the rules of common decency they were so sinful. The fruity, strawberry smoothy Mr. B ordered was not overly sweet, and appeared to be a blend of fresh fruit ingredients and mix. Nice and thick and icy, it met with our approval on an especially hot summer night.   I liked their seasonings, many of their entrees were alluring, their portions generous.  Good enough that we returned two nights later for a repeat performance.  Yet another successful meal.  I think their ""2 For $20"" is quite a deal.  You share an appetizer, then each choose an entree from a select list. While Mr. B and I could not agree on the choices those two nights, that deal is still on our radar. A great meal at a price that is hard to beat. Our server was attentive, even though our food came out a tad slow, but not terribly bad. So, I gotta tell you. All things considered, we will be happy to return. Better than your average 3 star, not quite a 4 star, but on its way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=100

Eric O.,"Washington, DC",20,181,1,1.0,8/30/2015,"Entered the restaurant with a coworker of mine after our shift..about 9pm on a Friday . We walked through the bar area to look for a table. First bad sign of the night was the manager? (Middle age white guy with beard and sorta longer hair) stopping us and asked in a non-welcoming tone if we were there for the bar or restroom and said we needed to show ID. Normally I assume showing ID would be shown after being greeted or seated, which we had received neither. So we wait about 30 minutes until a pair of bar top stools opened up. We sat down and ordered water, and immediately Kelsey? Gave a smirk and comment to the other bartenders in reference to us not ordering alcohol off the bat. After that we received no attention for 10 minutes or so even though we were ready to order our meals and possibly a drink. We were annoyed and my coworker found a manager on duty, Nestor, and he sat us at a regular table after we explained our situation. Heather was a great waitress, but we were a bit annoyed that given our professionalism with Nestor, he didn't seem genuine at all with our experience nor did he ever come back during our meal to ask how everything was going.

I think the only reason I can't give it 5 stars is every now and then when I come at night the hostesses is a little rude and impatient. It happens, but I appreciate when I go to a restaurant for a late dinner to relax and the whole staff is professional and energetic! But that could just be me.

Only came here for happy hour, so I guess this is more of a happy hour review. 5 PARKING: OMFG. So much parking around Tyler, but only at night.  4 SERVICE: I got the same waiter twice and he was the best! The waitress on the one hand was still nice, but didn't really provide my roommate and I with efficient drink recommendations. Busy around happy hr (1st round), but I love the 10pm-close happy hour. 3 DRINKS: Summer specials were weird. $5 savory and spicy was interesting. Had the cucumber drink and it was more tolerable than the tequila with sea salt drink. I hope they never have that menu. However, their normal happy hour drinks are so delicious. $5 Ultimate margarita, electric lemonade, and long island and $3 beer. Ordered: Ultimate margarita: Ah, get the mango raspberry mix? So good! The lemon? one is normal. Recommend. Tasted electric lemonade: It's blue, but I don't really like this one. Some of my friends like this one. Tasted long island: Tastes better than the electric lemonade. Gummi bear: Mine was stronger than my friends, but it was a delicious mix! Don't know the price though. Beer is pretty good, but normal. 3 FOOD: All appetizers are 1/2 off and they have some other appetizers for cheap. Ordered: Recommend all three. 1. Full Plate of nachos: Pretty good for the price. Comes with guacamole, beef, sour cream, jalapenoes, etc. the norm. 2. Sliders (x3): So delicious, I want to order these every time I come. 3. Mozzarella sticks: Fried cheese is so good!

For instance, they have this thing at T.G.I. Fridays called the ""Right portion, Right price"" and surprisingly they are on the spot with this one. The sweet potato fries are out of this world and the $3 huge glass (sorry, didn't catch how many ounces.. but believe me it's a deal!) of domestic beers during happy hour, not to mention the 1.50 bucket of fries!!! The servers are excellent and constantly make sure that your water is filled or ask how your dish is... I would have to say that I never thought a fast paced restaurant like this one can provide great customer service. Grade A for quality, price and service at this location.

We asked to speak for a supervisor, think I never do and I wouldn't give less that two stars, they don't deserve any!  The supervisor came to our table with no name tag, no properly dressed as a ""supervisor"" and didn't even introduce her self she was worst than the security, we explained our guest just arrived from another country and of course does NOT live in here, she just said no to everything being rude, at the end after explaining all over again, she said he could stay if he will bring a US passport and that's the ""company"" policy. So.... Tourists can't come to this place to have a drink? Even if they show all their documents that proof they are older than 18 and they are here legally just visiting friends?

While some of this may seem petty it was more so the whole experience and i just felt we were being rushed out not that this would have pushed me to leave any faster but still and this place is open until 2am oh and btw..my husband and I are always BIG tippers but this guy/restaurant just jacked us tonight and it was not like it was super busy at all or we would of been obviously more understandable...these were simple/couteous things that should happen in a restaurant! I gave one star because i have been here when service and everything was great and overall the food was ok..but come on TGI's get it together..and stop laggin with the customers. now while i appreciate this is one of the only places open around 11:30 on a sunday night....i feel that customer service should always be a priority...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=160

You would think someone would be considerate seeing a young professional coming in around 12 and have a lil pep in their step ! I waited at the front door for about 3 min (mind you it was not that busy) After waiting to be seated with no sign of the hostess I decided to seat myself. I only had a 60 min HELLO. So as I started to seat myself a hostess came up, walked me back to the front and told me that she seats me, RUDE ! Anyways I let it go. Like I said I was on lunch so I proceeded to order my drink and food and the same time. I got my food and drinks in good timing. I thought Friday's was a decent place to eat to grab something not so fattening. I ordered the 1/2 sandwich, fries and small salad. The food was terrible ! I could have sworn the hard bread had mold on the top, the fries were not hot in fact they were cold and the salad was so not fresh it wasn't even funny. So I decided to take my lunch as a lost but I wanted to pay for my meal. The waiter Lexie gave me my check around 12 40, walked past my table about 5 times and never picked up my check. At 12 52 I was fed up. At least she should have had the decency to get paid ! Mind you I was on my lunch break so I was furious !

The food is amazing I have never had a problem with the food being stale or tasting weird.  If you have never been here and are reading my review, here are my recommendations: Appetizers: Green bean fries, BBQ Chicken Flatbread, Loaded potato skins, Jack Daniels sampler, and the pot stickers. I don't recommend the wings as they have no flavor they are just hot and taste like vinegar. Entrees: Anything they have with ""Jack Daniels"" in the name (Seriously), the ribs are good but are not meaty at all, Fridays shrimp (one of my favorites), Dragonfire Chicken, the New York Chedday and bacon burger, and the JD Bruger. Dessert: Whatever tickles your fancy, I like it all. I don't recommending getting anything to go, I did that once, got home and it was all really soggy.

The wait was only 10 mins and it's a Wednesday evening not slammed. So I asked how much longer it would be for a booth and he told me he didn't know and if I wanted one he would have to put my name at the end of the line.

My boyfriend wanted to go here for dinner and because it was fathers day, so I didn't really have much of a choice. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. We were tucked away in the corner, yet I didn't mind, it gave my family more privacy and we could see the TV perfectly, so my little one wouldn't wiggle around too much.

It took forever to get our appetizers to the table and then when the actual dinner plates came out......there was a fu**ing bug crawling on my sister in laws lettuce.

Ray N.,"Rosemead, CA",640,502,122,1.0,3/31/2010,"So a group of friends and I came here for a birthday dinner, and it was by far the worst birthday dinner. For a party of 8, this place does not take reservations-- which made our wait approximately two hours, and the place wasn't even too busy at all. Seriously, we arrived there at 7PM and walked out of the place at 1130PM. The waiter we got was trying way too hard to be funny, but at times he was rude. However, he was pretty good looking. But aside from that, our food took forever to come out. On top of that, everything looked like a mess-- the display of my food was like trash-- it was like they drizzled fries and onion rings all over my ribs. After the long dinner, I came home and got food poisoning-- which I threw up for 2+ hours. Overall, I would NOT come here again-- and if I really had to, I wouldn't order anything too greasy, which means I'll order a salad. High lights: - Attentive waiters refilled water/drinks every now and then. -Good pricing for their $20 value meals ( 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, & 1 dessert) Low lights: - Bad service-- food took a century to come out. - No reservations when the place didn't even looked like it was packed at all. - Awful display of their entrees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=220
Tom B.,"Riverside, CA",10,28,,2.0,8/5/2010,"I like TGIFriday's for the variety on the menu and the reliably good food.  I expect it to be noisy, so I'm not turned off by the fact that it is.  But, I expect the food and service to be good, which it usually is.  But, it was neither at 7 p.m. on August 4th. To begin with, the waitress called us ""you guys"" to which my wife objects and after pointing it out to her, she continued to refer to us as ""you guys.""   We both had the Jack Daniel's chicken breast.   You expect something more than just  plain chicken breast patty cutlets--formed chicken breast patties, but that's what they were.  The Jack Daniel's sauce was great as usual.   Stayed for coffee--some of the most bitter and strongest we have had in a while.  Needless to say, we didn't dare try dessert.   Hope someone else has had a better experience recently.  Next time I think we'll try a different store in the chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-riverside-3?start=220

The last time I was there, it was not very busy. It took 15 minutes just to get a drink order. Then, it took an awfully long time to get our food, and for the price, the portions were pretty small. When the hostess asked me how everything was, I let her know, and all she did was shrug my complaints off. I called when we left dn spoke to the manager, who comped the entire meal and was apologetic, which I appreciated.

B And E H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,,2.0,8/12/2012,"Took a day off from Tacos to have a classic Jack D burger. The burger was made well enough but consistently, I find the service to be sucky here. Today I took my order to go, but had to go back to ask for Jack Daniel's sauce for- you guessed it- a jack burger. Shouldn't it have it already? The staff seemed annoyed by me having to ask for it, so I took my one container of sauce and left, even though I had ordered multiple burgers which should have warranted multiple sauces. On top of this feeling of having to beg for what should have been offered or already in the bag, my order was promised in 20 min but I got there in 30 min and it still wasn't ready. Basically, food is what you would expect but service is slow and staff are rude every time.

As soon as he left I realized I did not ask for my ranch. I am a very picky eater, I do not start eating my food until I have everything. So I sat for 10 minutes waiting for this waitress to at least walk by.. nothing. I can see her on the other side of the bar laughing and having a conversation with another waitress. I was getting frustrated. My husband is eating, I'm super hungry just staring at my food and no other employee walks by. Right when I was about to get up and ask someone she walked by and still I had to make a hand signal for her to stop or she would of kept walking.

When me and my boyfriend didn't even have shrimp we had the Jack Daniels Chicken. Thats fucking gross, if he threw my leftovers away thats all he had to say.
