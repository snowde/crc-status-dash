Nicole F.,"Harvard, IL",0,4,,2.0,3/28/2015,"Drinks, dessert and service were good. Entrees weren't worth the price. Worst thing.. the place was filthy. Our booth had grime and splatter all over the side wall and the lamp was dusty and gross. Things were sticky. Pretty sure they can't be bothered to do anything more than wipe down the table top. Ended up with bronchitis shortly after our visit. Coincidence?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2?start=20
Alyssa R.,"Rockford, IL",7,29,2,2.0,12/25/2013,"Went with a group of friends and the service was terrible. Waited too long for our food and the food wasn't even that good. Atmosphere of the restaurant is very dim and sad feeling. The employees are trying way too hard to be happy there. Another thing, our server said that they can't talk about their pick 2 for 10 unless it's being brought up by the customer. sneaky marketing but what if the customers don't know about the deal, the quality of the food doesn't go with the prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2?start=20
Chris C.,"Loves Park, IL",0,5,,2.0,6/12/2014,"Our waitress was friendly but a little scatter brain. She brought wrong food out, gave wrong tickets, was not good to refill drinks. Did not bring out enough napkins when asked she said she will bring right them out but apparently forgot on her way to get them, we had to remind her again. Our lunch trip with corporate members spread into a 2.5 hr. Lunch...not pleasant @ all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2?start=20
Scott G.,"Loves Park, IL",14,7,,4.0,2/3/2013,"We called around forever trying to find a place that was actually open on Christmas Day for dinner (aside from the usual Chinese options).  The family was coming in from out of town, and they wanted to eat out.  The service was phenomenal, and the menu had something for everyone...one on a diet, one a vegetarian, one gluten-free, etc.  Kudos!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2?start=20
Mike R.,"Rockford, IL",1,67,,1.0,2/14/2013,"The food, when prepared right, is good. I've been there three times and either my party or myself has had major problems. One time I didn't get my meal until everyone was done, the next the food was underprepared, and the last there was hair in my friend's mashed potatoes. Moral of the story: not going back. After I stopped giving this place opportunities, my friend received food poisoning with his $12.99 entree. Whether I'm unlucky or not, I will avoid this chain and location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2?start=20
ken i.,"Rockford, IL",2,73,2,2.0,2/3/2014,Not a good experience! We've been there several times before and it's typically ok. Tonight's experience was poor. There were 6 of us. The timing of the serving of,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2?start=20
Antonia P.,"Beloit, WI",0,3,,1.0,7/19/2014,"My bf and I were out for a date night. We had never been to the tgi Fridays in Rockford but we love tgi Fridays- we quickly found out the Rockford location is not for us. We sat in the bar and waited five minutes for someone to come help us even though the bartender was right there. When someone did help us it was the manager not the bartender. We received our drinks and ordered our apps. I asked whether the lobster was rock or Maine bc it's a big difference in taste and flavor; she didn't know but I had her go find out. As I'm waiting for my answer I hear her ask and her boss who laughs and says something like I don't know just tell them it's Maine! We were shocked how he said that right in front of us. While we waited for our apps I was watching the bartender and our server continue to wash dishes, the bar, etc. while making drinks and bringing ppl they're food without ever washing her hands. It was gross and unsanitary so we left. I'm a server and I wash my hands raw rather than mess with people's health!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2?start=20

Leana W.,"Rockford, IL",64,93,53,5.0,1/12/2018,Friendly ambiance and bar area. Stopped in for drinks and a small appetizer. Soup served hot and fast. Drinks were nice and strong and the manager checked in on us to make sure we had everything we needed. We would have stayed for dinner but already had plans for the evening. I would definitely come in again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2
Chantel C.,"Rockford, IL",0,12,20,4.0,7/15/2017,"The drinks were really good - perfect for those that don't like the taste of alcohol.  Our salads were just right and the burgers were good - could have used mire seasoning on the burgers.  Also, if you get the bacon cheeseburger- unless you like lots of cheese - skip the cheddar spread. The ambience was nice and our waitress was very nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2
Delilah A.,"Lexington, MA",87,163,144,4.0,7/21/2016,"I don't normally go to TGI Fridays - but we did and I was surprised how good it was.  This location had a great team- from the greeter to the waiter.  The food is classic American fried food, so if your expecting food thats different- don't come.  They do have a small app sampler where each item is super small (for $4) so you can have wontons and fried green beans or wings and mozzeralla.   Regardless, great customer service and a VERY clean space.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2
Charles B.,"Elgin, IL",15,32,29,1.0,6/17/2017,"Came here looking for a nice dinner with the family.

Tammy T.,"Glendale, AZ",16,131,49,1.0,10/24/2016,"Honestly, every time I eat here, the food never tastes any better. I tried something different every time & it never got any better. Service is usually always on top of their game. I just don't prefer to eat here anymore. & the jack Daniel's sauce is super sweet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2
Erika M.,"Bartlett, IL",0,3,,1.0,6/3/2017,This TGIF was awful!  We were seated in the bar area- high top section and our service was terrible.  After waiting 15 mins no one took our order.    We ended up walking out.  Also- the ladies room was dirty and three teenage kids in the front not doing anything.  Lost our business.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2

Stephen W.,"Rockford, IL",23,3,1,3.0,1/8/2017,"It's ok, service is usually above par, but the food is nothing to brag about. If you're in the area I would consider Granite City before TGI Fridays... sorry, but my true opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2
Jason. R.,"Roscoe, IL",0,4,,1.0,5/10/2017,"Haven't ate here in a while so thought we would try it again.  Service was ok,  had to remind the waitress about our apps.  Ordered jack Daniels ribeye which was very tough.  My son didn't even finish his hamburger.  Now I remember why it had been so long since I was here.  Next time if I am looking for this type of food I will stick with Chilis. At least there I don't get over charged for the draft beer!  I will not be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2
Frell 6.,"Mount Morris, IL",0,12,7,4.0,4/21/2017,Took my daughter's there for dinner.  We were greeted warmly and seated within 5 minutes.  It was about 630pm. Server came right away and took our drink order. She came back after a couple of minutes and took our food order. She came back several times to refill our drinks without asking.  I liked that because we didn't have to ask for refills.  Food was very good. It was a pleasant experience for us. We have been there several times before and never had a problem. I only gave it 4 stars because tgif is only a couple steps above any fast food joint.  I recommend if ur having an informal dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2
Dong B.,"Ankeny, IA",18,161,198,4.0,9/2/2015,Good place for lunch.  Not too busy and the staff is attentive.  Love the Jack Daniels sauce.  I wonder if it would go well on a DQ sundae?  Instead of hot fudge I could drizzle it with the sweet and yummy Jack Daniels sauce.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2
Jake G.,"Rochelle, IL",67,14,17,2.0,1/29/2016,"Although the establishment itself is quite kept up, the food is sub par.our server had no idea about the promotions and the menu items. My wife and I ordered two simple burgers with a cup of chedar broccoli and totilla soup. Both of which took over fifteen minutes to get to our  table. The soup was not that good at all.the cheddar broccoli was overpowering like a just but into a hunk of cheddar,and the totilla was more of a fajita thrown into a bowl with tomato sauce poured on top of it. We had ordered medium burgers. After a solid forty five minutes with an empty dining room?? The burgers arrived and were extra well done. A mess! I would not recommend this establishment for a classy meal at all!! But a simple outing with a group of friends might be possible if you really don't know about food. The management was very kind and offered to correct l mistakes. Like I stated prior the establishment itself is very well kept and environment itself is very upbeat and professional. The only problem that lies is the kitchen",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2

Sebastian R G.,"Rockford, IL",93,73,24,4.0,10/23/2015,"First time here in the longest of time. Literally, longest of time.  I ordered the NY strip. Rare, really juicy and delicious, but I feel like it lacked in flavour, so I need a good amount of salt and the sauce they brought me. Also had broccoli with it and Mac and cheese. The broccoli of course good, can't go wrong with that, the Mac and cheese was really good! My beverage was the angry orchard, it was good, but it tasted different then other orchards. Now the cleanliness, was good bathrooms kept to notch, floors and tables well done.  Service was good too, she was attentive and made sure we were alright from start to end. Never were we unsatisfied.  My parties food had burgers, they both thought it was really well, but may needed fries and better BBQ sauce. Would I come back, yes. A bit better then Applebee's, but the space and flavour at Applebee's is better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2

Ryan J.,"Nashville, TN",49,12,15,5.0,1/31/2012,I live a long ways from this restaurant in a rural area that really doesn't offer anything along the lines of good food. Whenever I get to Rockford I try to stop at TGI Friday's.  To date I haven't received a bad meal. The service has always been great. I tend to bring people with me and suggest this location to others now that I have had so many positive experiences. The one time I had a minor issue the manager took care of it immediately and everything was perfect from then on. I would HIGHLY suggest going here if you want good food and service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2
Shannon F.,"Rockford, IL",7,6,5,1.0,6/6/2014,We stopped in last night and were disappointed right away. We walked in to people talking who couldn't stop to greet us.  They've changed the menu and are no longer serving some things which were staples of the old. They stopped carrying Guinness and didn't replace it with another stout. The appetizer we ordered was small for the new increase in price. We ended up leaving and having dinner somewhere else.  As we left we informed the manager we wouldn't be returning which is sad since this was a good close restaurant to us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2

Mari W.,"Marengo, IL",0,22,4,2.0,4/26/2015,"Two stars and they are both for the waitress that we had, cuz she was amazing... Ok I know this is a chain restaurant, but come on now EVERYTHING has to be fried? When the warm pretzels came out they were swimming in oil! there was no mention of that on the menu... The chicken salad was meh, the chicken tasted like wet dog.. Hubby got the burger well let's just say that was dripping with grease too... I suggest to Friday's they revamp their menu, have a few dishes you are good at that staff can cook, THAT DOESNT INVOLVE FRYING EVERY THING...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-rockford-2
