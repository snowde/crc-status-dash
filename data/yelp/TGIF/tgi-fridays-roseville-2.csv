Jennifer L.,"Inver Grove Heights, MN",153,352,130,4.0,9/23/2009,"I came here with a friend at high noon on a weekday and we got a table immediately. We placed our order at the same time we asked for our drinks and before our conversation could hit a lull our food was in front of us.  I got the Cheesy Bacon Cheeseburger - which is a bacon cheeseburger with a slab of fried cheese on it. (Whoever thought to put what is essentially a giant flat cheese-curd on a bacon cheeseburger should get a prize!) It was so good that I blew my ""I am only eating half"" rule out the door and gobbled the whole darn thing. The fries that came with it were good but a little too seasoned - my hands felt swollen from the salt later.  I am not a huge fan of TGI or any restaurant where the wearing of ""Flair"" is a common practice - I think I have watched Office Space one too many times - but I have to say lunch here was pretty nice. We had plenty of time to eat our meal and drink our drinks and made it back to work on time. I would not hesitate to have lunch here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-roseville-2
Rhonda G.,"Saint Paul, MN",1290,1296,4,4.0,1/1/2009,"New Years Day, we're still not eating meat before Nativity this Wed. We decided to stop here after we got 75% off a Christmas tree at Target in Roseville. I don't know why this address is listed in St. Paul,but it sure seems like Roseville. We got the cutest, most attentive waitress, and she was young and blond. My husband and I both ordered shrimp, his was deep-fried butterfly, listed as Friday's Shrimp, and I got Key West Shrimp, both delicious. This is really my favorite location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-roseville-2
Margaret O.,"Minneapolis, MN",84,107,113,3.0,12/19/2009,"When you're in the mood for American chain-restaurant food, this place will do the trick. Chicken tenders are quite good - batter is on the ligher, crispier side and honey mustard is sweet & delicious. It's also one of the only restaurants of its type that has the kitchen open super late -- good for late night cravings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-roseville-2
