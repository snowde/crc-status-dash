Carol P.,"Sacramento, CA",3077,824,879,3.0,3/4/2009,"We had good service.  The hostess seated us right away on a Thursday night (not crowded at all).  Our server Matt was pleasant and quick.  I had the Jack Daniel's baby back ribs and shrimp ($20)  and boyfriend had the flat iron steak with roasted red pepper butter and fries ($13).  The ribs were tender.  The fried shrimp were light and not greasy.  Both items were delicious.  I hate the JD sauce on its own.  Brushed on the ribs while grilled gives it a good flavor, but by itself, I think it's way too sweet and a little too tangy.  BF ordered his steak medium well, but when he cut into it, it bled pink.  I took a bite and it didn't taste seasoned at all.  So while we waited for Matt to come back we stopped another server and showed her the meat.  ""That's not medium well.""  Matt came over right away and took the plate back.  After only a few minutes, another steak and fries came out.  This one was cooked perfectly and tasted great.  The manager came by to apologize for the screw up and offered us free desserts.  As full as we were, we're no fools, and had the brownie obsession and the peanut butter chocolate pie.  Needless to say, those pushed us over the edge (the warm brownie and vanilla ice cream concoction did me in good!).   Kudos for the excellent customer service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-roseville
Ashley K.,"Anaheim, CA",46,95,61,2.0,3/12/2009,$8.50 for a glass of sangria which had about a tablespoon of wine in it and mostly tasted of cheap fruit juice? Never again!!!  The food is alright... nothing great.  The service was normal.  I most likely won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-roseville
Kristin C.,"Carmichael, CA",1,16,,4.0,2/21/2015,"I find it funny that people have posted this place/location as closed... Um its not.  I've been there as recently as TONIGHT... still going strong.  I've only had an ""issue"" one time in the many times I've been there & that was a server who sorta ignored our table - as in, our drinks were gone and we were still there wanting more. So yeah.  Other than that the food is standard TGIF, staff is friendly & funny.   my only real complaint is that there are only two locations in ""sacramento"" (ELk Grove & Roseville) - I live in Carmichael, and was sad to see the Howe ave location shut down years ago.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-roseville
Miika M.,"San Francisco, CA",2238,1693,2109,1.0,9/30/2006,"Typical chain that features typical bar food in a family atmosphere (everyone in Roseville goes out to eat in hordes on Friday, Saturdays, and Sundays) Their specialty is the Jack Daniel's glaze and you can find it on their hamburgers, ribs, chicken, and steaks.  I personally don't like it because it overpowers the meats, but may suit existing tastebuds.  I usually ordered their large salads, but only out of boredom. Apparently, this location is where my ex took/takes all his dates, so you can count on me never going there.  The waitress/bartender knows him and treats him with a weird nonchalant yet suspicious attitude whenever we use to go there. I'd rather go to the location on Howe, where the local CSUS crowd keeps things a bit more interesting and alive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-roseville
Inigo M.,"San Francisco, CA",35,2400,69,4.0,3/20/2007,"Four stars for the Jack Daniel's Sampler. Other than that, it's your typical ""flair"" American restaurant... although it smells more pungent than your typical Chili's. I wonder if that has anything to do with the sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-roseville
Joe B.,"Sacramento, CA",11,759,7,2.0,9/19/2008,It is a chain restaurant.. There are so many in Roseville... This place is not that good. It seemed like our waitress didnt want to be there. I kind of felt bad for her. We ordered some burgers.. They were ok... But I like In N Out better... We won't be back..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-roseville
Louie S.,"Rocklin, CA",7,53,,2.0,3/4/2009,"If not for the Brownie Obsession, I would give Friday's one star. That dessert is top of the line chain resto taste right there if you want something overstated and rich. Not if you are feeling refined. They actually have good ideas AND tasty items on the menu, but the execution is CONSISTENTLY terrible. I've been here a lot because my father loves it, and because it's open late (also a reason for the 'jump' to 2-stars). Some of the classic apps they serve CAN be good when effort is put into them- the tostado nachos, skins, jack strips- but so often they are prepared terribly. Too bad, because it could be a decent chain. Entrees are prepared poorly all the time too. If you want to gamble on a late night that they will try to actually cook the food well, you may just end up with some tasty items. I take this gamble only once in a great while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-roseville
James S.,"Lincoln, CA",3,28,,1.0,6/8/2007,"We used to frequent Friday's down in San Diego during my college days.  Can't go anymore cause the one in Roseville is horrible.  Bad food, bad service and bad management.  I stopped going about a year ago so it's possible they may have made a turn for the better but I guess I'll never find out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-roseville
