Tina T.,"San Diego, CA",237,60,77,4.0,1/18/2013,Love this place. It's cheep and real American food. It's a nice place and clean.  The sizzling chicken and shrimp is one of the best things on the menu. They also have the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  I also love the brownie dessert. It's like a melted brownie with Carmel and nuts and a scout if cold vanilla ice cream on top. It's amazing.  Prices are good too. It's really good and good price too! You can't expect a fancy steak for only 15 bucks. Also the appetizers are good too. Overall one of the better American restaurants.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=20
Rayna G.,"Escondido, CA",0,37,,5.0,5/20/2014,I write this review with a heavy heart. My husband and I love this place. We recently went and the food just wasn't the same. It's no secret TGI Friday's changed recipes but man it tasted terrible! The mozzarella sticks were always our favorite but now they're probably the worst we've ever had. The mozza sticks were their trademark and now they ruined them! We'll probably never go back but only because the food was horrible which is not this restaurant in general's fault. If you are going to go to a Friday's I would go to this location. The service is good and the restaurant has a fun atmosphere.  BRING BACK THE OLD FOOD!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=20
Sam N.,"San Diego, CA",69,36,3,1.0,4/21/2013,"Against my better judgment, I decided to give Friday's a try. I haven't been in a very long time, but it was worth a try.  The most glaring thing is that this place is LOUD! Anywhere you sit in the restaurant, it's very difficult to hear even the person sitting next to you. The last Friday's I went to was the same, so it must be just the way the chain wants it to be. Maybe it's more exciting...? The food wasn't very good either. We got the Jack Daniels appetizer of baby back ribs, fried shrimp, and something that tasted like Orange Chicken. The baby back ribs were very dry, even though the chicken and shrimp were decent. My Cajun pasta was bland, and I could barely taste the Cajun flavor. The Cajun flavor is anything but bland, but they've managed to do it. Bleh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=20
Elvin D.,"San Diego, CA",121,157,581,3.0,11/25/2013,"If your looking for a place to get cheap drinks with a decent happy hour menu this is your spot. If your looking for some sit down quality food go elsewhere.  Regular Menu food is average nothing special here. If you've been to one TGIF well than it's the same here. Average service, semi clean tables, dirty restrooms, decent food.  We come here for the happy hour and that's about it so I give it a solid three stars for happy hr!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=20
Eric L.,"Poway, CA",7,13,1,1.0,3/31/2013,"I don't know what's more embarrassing, actually writing a review for a Friday's or how horrible the service actually was.. We usually go to the UTC Friday's for the late night happy hour and we have never had any problems there. But last night we just decided to stay local, what a huge mistake. The Long Islands are on happy hour for 5 bucks and we always get them with cranberry as the mixer; apparently when you ask for cranberry you are getting a 'Long Beach' and there is apparently shnopps added? Even though I couldn't taste anything remotely close to a shnopp, sure, whatever.... But then you don't tell us that the 'Long Beach's' are not on special and in fact 8 dollars when you bring our check? Real trashy move on the Friday's end. We get that same drink in UTC with no questions asked and its still on happy hour. So this might have just been a mix up or miscommunication; but it really seemed intentional by our waiter (Mike) trying to possibly charge us more.. Even though we showed up right at 10 for the happy hour specials; I guess they assumed I showed up at 10 to in fact pay full for drinks? Doesn't that completely defeat the purpose of showing up for a happy hour? I know this may be a complicated situation compared to your normal brain load at Friday's; but it's actually really simple. We showed up at happy hour, for happy hour.... what a crazy concept. To top it off you brought my girl a water without her or any of us even asking; assuming we were drunk. Get off your high horse; you are working at a Friday's dude... it's not that cool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=20
Madison J.,"San Diego, CA",58,2,,1.0,7/30/2014,"The other night my family wanted quick, cheap food. So Friday's wins the draw.  We get to Friday's, (we always sit in the bar) and take a seat. Our first server/bartender was very nice and took our order promptly and kept checking up on us. However, it all went downhill when he decided to to take his break. His back up bartender/server and came over to our table to clear our plates. (We weren't even all of the way done yet, she just grabbed them.) She spilled ranch all over my step dad, my mom and all over my purse. She then comes back, grabs more plates and says ""I won't spill on you this time!"" and laughed. My Mom asks to speak to a manager and she said ""oh he's busy, I'll just comp something instead."" So she took off 1 appetizer during happy hour. We then go to use the restroom before we leave, BATHROOM IS DISGUSTING. There is paper towels all over the place. ""Lady stuff"" wrappers sticking out of the trash cans. No toilet paper. No paper towels to use besides the ones all over the ground! And we had to use toilet seat covers as toilet paper! It wAs so awful I can't believe it. After that we grab our things and my Mom asked the hostess to get a manager. An assistant manager comes out, says ""oh sorry"" about everything we told him. Then my mom says ""we want the real manager please."" So then the General manager walks out, everything is explained again. He says ""it makes me sad that you feel that way about my restaurant."" (Then fix it!!) He goes to his office and grabs us a bunch of coupons. My mom said she didn't want the coupons she just needed him to know how bad our experience was. We used to be regulars but we won't be anymore!! Sorry Friday's but you lost a loyal customer!! P.S. They're closing in September.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=20
Catherine J.,"San Diego, CA",140,67,180,4.0,3/20/2011,"Based on what we ordered, I am giving TGIF's four stars.  We came here after not being able to find any parking at Hooters RB due to UFC 127.  We sat at the bar, thinking they might be showing UFC.  All good, we sat through some good March madness.  Funny thing, Kill Bill came on after that.  Not quite for your dining pleasure. Altogether, it was a great alternative option because I was able to fulfill my longtime craving of green bean fries.  Crispy green bean fries ***** Gold Medalist smoothie ***** Turkey burger with fries *** Turkey burger was ok.  It probably would have tasted better with cheese, but I didn't really order it for me anyway.  I did it half though with mayo and ketchup.  The fries that accompanied it were salty so I only had one.   However, I loved magnificent crispy green bean fries and gold medalist smoothie!  I would definitely go back for those!

Shannon S.,"Escondido, CA",503,605,187,2.0,9/17/2013,"Mario G likes to come to TGIFridays. I do not. Nothing is really that fantastic here, but I usually order the Jack Daniels chicken and shrimp combo. I wasn't feeling like having the same TGIF affair, so I went with something new and ordered the salmon with langastino alfredo sauce. It was gross in presentation, taste, and texture. The sauce was lumpy, and fishy. The langastino was rubbery and the salmon was over cooked. I tried to drown my sorrows in a cocktail. I wanted one of their featured Makers Mark cocktails since I'm a huge Makers fan. I asked if I could have the cocktail ($12) without the souvenir glass. The bartender said she could, but would still charge $12 for the cocktail. Pass. I went with a draft beer instead. They have Karaoke here on Sunday nights. The Karaoke singing is horrible, and not in the good way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=20
Trish R.,"Richmond, CA",196,255,214,5.0,8/21/2013,"If you're a regular at the bar, they treat you right.  The bar tenders probably don't know be by name, but the second they see one of my coworkers or my husband come in, they probably know me as ""the-girl-who-comes-in-right-around-last call-and-always-orders-a-mudslide"" on Friday night/Saturday morning.  They think I'm a nurse since we all wear scrubs when we go in there, which is adorable... if you happen to work for this location: I work in a medical diagnostic laboratory off Sabre Springs.  Just a fun FYI :D They're attentive when you walk in, grab your drinks fast, leave you be for the rest of the night other than to see if you want anything before the kitchen closes, and the food is solid (this is not common amongst all TGI's).  My buddies and I spend a lot of time staring at the TV since we're usually BSing about work while watching/side commenting on whatever's on ESPN.  In comparison to all other Friday's, they're relatively better than the rest.  The crowd is rowdy, but that's to be expected when you're closing down the bar... again, the bar tenders deal with even the craziest of them pretty well.  I'm hoping once my schedule cools down, I can crash the karaoke Monday nights.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=20
Annie Is A S.,"San Diego, CA",15,89,52,2.0,1/4/2014,"I had to find a new place for my husband and I to go to in our hick town and this seemed to fit the bill.  Actually I had gone two times before with my friend and then with my sister and both times were ok.  I was trying so hard to be enamored with this place that I overlooked the quality of the food.  The first time there, I ordered the dragon fire chicken and it was great.  It came with rice and perfectly cooked broccoli.  The second time I ordered the half slab of ribs and chicken dish.  the ribs were fantastic, but the chicken was a hard little puck.  My sister had ordered her steak black and blue, which means quickly seared on both sides-bloody rare-and it came out well done.  It was apparent the cooks have no clue how to cook a steak.  So..........let's get to last night. I told my husband what a great place this was.  Let's go and have a drink, watch the game, and have some dinner.   I ordered the grilled salmon with langostino lobster in alfredo sauce with steamed vegetables and rice.  The salmon was so overcooked it was hard around the edges, the langostino was soft and mushy; also very overcooked, the vegetables were steamed to death.  I think the only thing I liked was the jasmine rice, really no jasmine flavor, and my Ciroc Bellinitini martini. My husband ordered the half slab of ribs and sirloin steak.  He ordered his steak medium and surprise, surprise the steak was cooked exactly the way he liked it.  He totally enjoyed his meal and the two draft Buds. All in all, I will go back, but will be more cautious about what I'm ordering.  Fish, no.  Chicken, maybe.  Steak, for sure and the ribs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=20

Carter G.,"Kailua, HI",138,153,21,4.0,4/22/2013,"For some reason I think TGI Fridays is a little underrated. I had the Cajun seasoned pork chop which comes w delicious creamy mashed potatoes and onion strings. The onion strings are phenomenal.  The firecracker crunchy shrimp appetizer is not very firecracker-y but is still delicious. Coleslaw, not so much. More like limp cabbage blobs without any sauce.  Dessert was the brownie sundae. Much much too rich for me. But I liked the first two bites!  Fridays has great drink specials as well which I appreciate. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=20
Julie U.,"Encinitas, CA",158,238,26,1.0,2/29/2012,"Nothing like a totally disgusting meal to prompt my first review in three months. We made the mistake of dining at Friday's last night because it was the only place we could find open. They're open until 1:30AM for food, so you can ingest nastiness well into the night! Methinks that if you eat this stuff at midnight and then go to sleep, you deserve whatever happens next. How bad can it be, right? A buffalo chicken sandwich and some cole slaw. If they had actually made it last night and not last week it probably would have been okay. Seriously, it was barely edible. The service was also awful and it was really pricy, too. I can't think of a worse combination.  Never again. No matter how hungry I am. I can't even believe this chain is still open.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=20

Pipat J.,"San Diego, CA",17,8,,2.0,5/1/2013,"I'm fairly new to the area so I came here for dinner with a couple of friends to become a little more familiar with the area. First thing I noticed was that it was pretty quiet inside. Not many customers. I took that as a bad sign.  When we got seated, we started off with the three for all appetizer, as I would normally do when I go to eat at a TGI Fridays. When it arrived, it did not look all too appealing. The loaded potato skins were hardly ""loaded"". They looked terrible. Like someone just threw all the stuff together and then microwaved it. Also the mozzarella sticks were mediocre. The cheese was okay but a little cold, so I think it was left on the plate for too long before it got served. Also, the marinara sauce that they gave to dip was old. You can tell because it wasn't the normal bright red, but instead it was a very dark and pasty color. The chicken wings were the only good part about it. Next up was the entrees. I got a steak, medium. Initially eating the steak was good because I started on the sides. As I got toward the slightly thicker parts of the steak, I began to notice it become redder and then eventually close to raw. This was pretty much 3/4 of my steak. My friend had ribs and shrimp. He said shrimp was good but the ribs were very dry. And by dry I mean dry. There was barely any hint of sauce on them. I felt like if we ended up complaining about the food, it would only come out with something extra in it. Definitely avoiding this TGI Fridays for the rest of my life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=20

Kevin F.,"San Diego, CA",0,10,,1.0,8/5/2013,"I took my family to Friday's tonight for dinner (haven't been there in a few years due to bad service and mediocre food) and had a terrible experience. So this is how it went...we got there and 6:15 and was sat immediately (only 4 other tables occupied when we arrived). The waitress came to our table at 6:26. We ordered my 3 year old son's meal and drink and said we'd order ours when she came back. She came back at 6:32 with my son's milk, then, my wife and I ordered our meals and drinks. Our waitress went MIA for a while and I had to get up to ask the host at the front of the store to get our waitress. A few minutes later she brought my wife's drink, but not mine. She said she'd be back with my beer. After another 8 minutes went by, I asked a passing waitress for the manager.  The manager came by a couple minutes later asking me what the problem was and I told her that we had been sitting at the table for over a half hour and my son still didn't have his food and that I was still without my beer. She promptly told me that I didn't get my beer because they were out of that specific beer. She didn't seem too concerned, nor comprehend why I was upset. I told her that we just wanted our check for my wife and son's drinks and we would go to the Chick Filet next store. While she was at our table, another waitress brought my son's food. He was hungry, so I decided to stick it out and ordered a different beer; the manager brought it to me a couple minutes later.  At 6:52, our dinners arrived and we proceeded to try salvaging our dinner experience. As for the food, my son's ""children's menu"" pizza looked like it came straight from a grocery store frozen section and it tasted just as bad, But he didn't know any better and was happy with it. My wife's cheeseburger was okay and my club sandwich was fine too. But after eating half my sandwich and fries, I found a long black hair in my fries. THAT WAS IT!!!! I called for the waitress and showed her the hair. I told her I'd like to speak with the manager again and she quickly took away my plate and walked away. A couple of minutes later, the manager came by and said he heard there was a problem. Again, she seemed like she didn't care and wanted to be anywhere else. I told her that I just wanted my check so we could go. She said she would comp the dinner. I told her that I wanted to give her some ""constructive criticism"" and she listened for a moment. I told her that she came across that she didn't care about the problems we had and that she should at least make an attempt to emphasize with a customer when they've had a bad experience. Again, she just went through the motions and did the absolute minimum to settle the issue.  This was the first time I had been at a TGI Fridays in a long time (due to poor past experiences) and I will not be back ever again. However, I don't put all the blame on the waitress or the manager. The TGI Friday corporate team is also to blame, since ongoing training and higher service standards that should be passed down from corporate would go a long way. All around...a very poorly run restaurant. We walked across the parking lot to Chick Filet and were greeted promptly with a warm smile and finished our dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=40

The restaurant was more than half empty so we thought we would get our food quickly. It took awhile for our burgers to arrive and we were disappointed visually and in taste. The burgers in the advertisement looked much bigger and you can see all the components. The burgers we received looked nothing like the photos in the menu. After going to awesome burger spots like Stacked, the burgers we got were so-so. The buns were generic, like they bought them across the street at a grocery store in the clearance section. The meat was ok. I'd rather spend the money on a great burger someplace else and spend the same amount of money. The bright side in the meal was the parmesan potato wedges. Those were pretty good.  Burgers: Meh. Go to a place like Stacked for much better quality and for a similar price. Waitress/Staff: Meh. They were ok. They did their best in smiling and being cordial. It's like they were there and not there. It must have been a long day for them. We did experience one super happy and friendly server. She gave us a helping of sweet potato fries. I liked her upbeat and positive energy. Location: Really good. That's why were there.  I find that most places usually give out a free birthday dessert for the celebrant. Maybe I've been spoiled by that and so I was hoping they would the same at TGIF's. Nope, but our waitress did light a candle. Dessert was also ok. I would rather have spent the same amount of money on a dessert someplace else like Cold Stone or Lappert's but alas, we were already there. I probably would go to another restaurant next time and spend my money more wisely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=40

I liked this branch in Carmel Mountain because I was close to my place and was a gathering point in my early years in San Diego. Until I discovered many other way better places and I completely forgot. I rediscovered, though, the other night, when a bunch of ex-colleagues and myself wanted to do an impromptu gathering about a job fair at a hotel and there was absolutely nowhere else to go (I was late and someone noticed that they are open until 2am, great surprise!).  Since we had food at the previous event, none of us were hungry, so we only got coffees, hot chocolate and soda, and my review is mostly for the comfort level and the service, which was very good, cordial and we felt comfortable there, so I will consider this place again when having to meet with a group of people late at night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego

I decided to try the Grilled Chicken Cobb lunch special, which included balsamic chicken breast on top of romaine with  grape tomatoes and hard-boiled egg. The salad is supposed to come with bacon and bleu cheese as well but I passed on both. The ranch dressing was decent but not my favorite. The balsamic chicken had a nice flavor but it got a little too sweet for me after a few bites.  My boyfriend selected the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger for his entree and we were both impressed and slightly horrified at the 1,400 calorie count for just the burger alone, not counting the fries.

I heard the commercial again this past week and as I drove by Friday's I thought what's up, where is the special?  After arriving and scouring the menu I still could not find any sign of it.  Therefore I mentioned it to the server and she said, yes, they have it but you have to ask for it since it is not shown.  Another way of stating that would be ""it is a lost leader and we really don't want you to order it"". So I order it and received the following: A generously portioned and flavored wedge salad A nice sirloin steak cooked perfectly to my order Fresh steamed broccoli Tasty mashed potatoes I was impressed. It was a good steak and a great meal; it wasn't a filet or rib eye, but guess what, it was only $10.

Yes, I absolutely expected all of these things.  I realize it's TGI Fridays and that we will be given a certain level of food and service.  However, I also realize that doesn't mean the service has to be completely indifferent and inattentive.

My friend and I were going to originally go see Rocky Horror but when we found out that we essentially had to go in costume to not pay outrageous prices, we opted for just dinner instead. I was craving chicken and instead of driving all the way down to Convoy, we stopped in Carmel Mountain. Our options weren't at all limited but my previous experiences with TGI Friday's have always been good ones. Until now. The place wasn't busy at all, and while we were immediately seated and greeted by our fantastic waitress, it felt like it took forever for us to get anything. People on either sides of us were served even though we were there first and while, yeah, we ordered full meals, you'd figure our appetizer would show up before someone's elses. Anyway. My chicken tenders were just okay. The potato skins were AWESOME. My drinks I got were delicious. Overall, it was okay. Just a regular experience.

Earl L.,"Escondido, CA",4,77,34,1.0,8/1/2013,"I loathe giving a negative review, especially for a single location of a large chain because the bar of expectations shouldn't be all that high to start for a formula restaurant. However, this last experience was so disappointing that I feel compelled to warn others. TGI Friday's is normally a solid choice for a decent meal at a value price and served with a cheerful disposition but, at least at this location, there seems to have been some recent tinkering with the successful model. First thing I noticed was that the restaurant was pretty empty for Friday at lunch rush. I soon learned why. The bathrooms had some sort of problem that was wafting a very unpleasant odor into the dining area. Nobody seemed to be tending to the problem, but our greeter was kind enough to proactively acknowledge the issue and offered to seat us in a different area of the restaurant. There were some folks back there dining, although I can only imagine how determined they were to avoid the indignity of non-booth seating that they were willing to put up with that stench. Found seating elsewhere fairly easily (remember that it was nearly empty) and placed orders. Had the salmon and langostino lobster - a very health conscious and tasty meal that I've enjoyed ever since TGIF added it to the menu. The meal itself was fine for me (my companion's was overcooked), but it took nearly 45 minutes to arrive. Completely unacceptable for a workday lunch for 2 people with few patrons in the restaurant. Also, noticed that the entree was decidedly smaller than I remember it being previously with only a few bits of langostino (I counted 8 little morsels). That, in itself, isn't that awful because the point of that dish is to offer taste with minimal calories. What wasn't cool about it though was that the price had gone substantially in the other direction - from $13.99 to $17.99. A tip for Friday's management - I think that $22 (pre-tip) is a bit outside your provence for a lite-sized meal and an iced tea. That pricing is more in line with a trendy bistro that customizes dishes daily. Based on the lack of a crowd, other former regulars might be in agreement with me on that one. The basics of TGI are still solid for what it is. I just hope that the people running the show take heed of the smaller crowds and get back to what they were doing reasonably well. Keep the restaurant tidy, serve up interesting and festive food, and price it in the mid-range. I think I'll wait until the place is busy again before considering a second chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-san-diego?start=60

Nikki B.,"San Diego, CA",6,23,,3.0,8/5/2013,"A couple of us usually get together for their happy hour specials about once a week. I love the happy hour there. However, our last waitress was a complete ditz. I should've caught her name, but didn't. Anyway, it was a friday night after 10pm that we all decided to join for happy hour. Our waitress, dropped my friends appetizer on the ground, sourcream flying everywhere. Considering this was HER mistake, not ours, I felt like we shouldn't have been charged for that appetizer. May I remind you, that we had already been waiting for our food for over 25 minutes, so when this happened, we were a tad bit upset. Our waitress was very apologetic (not that I thought she was sincere) but nonetheless, she apologized. I still felt like it was bad customer service to not remove it off of our bill- but 1/2 off the appetizers for happy hour... WHATEVER. Four dollars is not a large sum of money. So, moving on.. The customer service is a hit or miss. Sometimes its really good, and other times it's whatever. But, considering this is the only Fridays near me, I will continue to go back, mainly for the happy hour specials.. I don't really go any other time. I mean, $5 margaritas and 1/2 off appetizers? I can't really pass that up. Beware of using the restroom at this location though. For as long as I can remember, which is about 8 months- they have had a REALLY bad sewage back up issue. Heading towards the restroom, in the hallways, you'll get a big wiff of this horrible smell.

The waitress came, asked us if we were ready to order (we had just gotten our menus) and never came back when we told her we weren't ready. We had to have a passing waiter take our order, as well as the manager had to refill our drinks. After all that our waiter still hadn't come to see if we wanted to order food. We waited 45 minutes before we ever even saw her again. She didn't even acknowledge the fact that we hadn't had any service from her. After that point she did not come back again, instead she insisted on serving the other tables that had bigger groups of people (obviously she was focused on large tips). When we finally got our food the Parmesan breaded chicken with 4 noodles and a small caprese salad was a rip off. It tasted good, but wish I would have received the portion I have gotten on several other occasions.

A few months later my daughter wanted to go there for a certain menu item for her 6th birthday. We were all in a festive mood and went for an early birthday dinner celebration. Our server was so un-enthustiastic that she never even looked up at our daughter when she exclaimed it was her birthday. The service sucked, our food was bad again and we had to ask 3 times for a birthday treat for our daughter. No song, no candle, and they didn't even comp the food that we sent back because it was wrong. So, as you can see, we are not had asses and we like to give people second and third chances.

Patty R.,"San Diego, CA",68,21,,1.0,4/20/2013,"Last night after a game, a large group of us went to this restaurant for some drinks and food. The restaurant wasn't ""slammed"" by any means at 10:15 or so, and we ended up being a revenue-generating group--at least 25 of us!  The waitress was rude and angry because ""I don't know where these drinks go because you all MOVED.,"" I believe were her words...We told her if it was too difficult, we'd be happy to leave and go to another restaurant. ""No,"" she says,""It's just difficult with a large group."" Hello. I waitressed  for years through college and beyond. DO YOUR JOB. If you can't, QUIT. Yes, large groups are hard. Management should then step in and get help for the server.  Food arrived in strange spurts, water was NEVER refilled in almost an hour and a half, I went to the bar twice to get glasses of wine for people bc they were never served (and she never even asked me for a drink order). At the end, the bills came. My husband got a bill for something we didn't eat on it, as well as 2 glasses of wine we never ordered (not even the kind I was drinking.) I got a bill for a drink I ALSO never ordered, and 2 others had bills with items on them that they didn't have. We got most of it fixed, and paid the exact price on the tab.  Corporate should REALLY be visiting this store. I can't imagine why some of their wait staff still have JOBS in the service and ""people"" industry! OH..and they ran out of wine glasses...how does a bar run out of wine glasses? In all, if going out as a group in Carmel Mountain, go to Claim Jumper. Drive by this place.

My wife and I looked at each other and laughed because when we were younger we both waited tables at a breakfast/lunch restaurant that was super busy and during the week we worked 11 tables each in our sections.

It was surprisingly quiet at lunch time on a Wednesday so that was a bonus. I chose the Jack Daniel's Chicken and Shrimp while Bri ordered the Jack Daniel's Ribs and Shrimp. SUCKA! His meal was 1800 calories and mine was 700. Of course, he enjoyed the fries while I 'enjoyed' the steamed veggies. They were actually pretty good and the chicken and shrimp were great! We got an appetizer and a couple of mojitos too so all in all, it turned out to be a great lunch.

We get there at 6:40 and she said it will be a few more minutes. At 6:45 we ask if it was too late to get sweet potato fries instead of regular fries on one of the burgers and she says no but it would take a little longer and we said thats fine thinking it wouldnt take too long to make fries.  7:06 rolls around and some lady comes in to pick up her order. I asked how long ago did she call in her order and she said 30 minutes ago (15min after we called our order in). As shes walking out the door with her order I ask about the status of our fries and she said 10 more minutes. Really? What are they growing their sweet potatoes and then hand cutting them or something? The employee comes back a few minutes later and I tell her we dont want the sweet potato fries anymore because we didnt know it takes over 25 minutes to fry fries and we'll just take what we had originally ordered and we dont care if one of the burgers are missing fries. She tells me its still going to take a few minutes because everyone is ordering the same thing I ordered and theyre waiting on the fries. What the hell?! But I phoned in my order an hour ago!

Food is a bit overpriced and specialty drinks aren't really that special.  If I come here now it's more for just happy hour to take advantage of the discounted prices.  People here are really cool though.  Service is usually good and they are fairly quick with your orders.  I always did enjoy eating out in the patio on a nice evening. Place is pretty clean too.   The bar gets crowded quick so on occasion it's difficult to find a seat. There's also a good amount of TV's to watch the local sports or play trivia on.  Large selection of drinks and regular mainstream beers on tap.   TGIFridays is not too bad and does the job if you are looking for a place for food and drink late in the evening.
