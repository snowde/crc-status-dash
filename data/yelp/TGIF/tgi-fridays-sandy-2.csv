Ash B.,"Atlanta, GA",153,28,1,4.0,3/13/2010,We've eaten several times at this location. It's very consistent service and food. Some times the wait times are longer than expected but they work hard to make it as comfortable as possible. Try the Jack Daniel's Flat Iron Steak and the Deep Fried Mac & Cheese.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandy-2
Dean K.,"Sandy, UT",5,5,,2.0,8/9/2014,"I'm giving it 2 stars because the food was good and well prepared. The service was poor. Way too long to get our drink order and even longer to bring them (I ordered water, FYI). Never asked for refills on drinks. Appetizer order took forever to get here. When main course finally got here, 3 out of 8 were incomplete and 1was the wrong meal. Never asked to take plates. Food is really good, hopefully you'll get a much better server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandy-2
Ozzie M.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,29,5,5.0,2/1/2014,Fast seating and great servers on a busy Saturday night. My wife loves the wedge salad and the ribs are great here. We never walk out feeling queasy like at chills,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandy-2
Austin B.,"Salt Lake City, UT",11,9,3,1.0,8/18/2014,They definitely try to hide the taste of their food behind horseradish sauce. Would not recommend. Been let down multiple times. Caesar salad taste like they use lemon pledge cleaner. If you go order something basic and expect basic also you better cancel the horseradish sauce or they will cake it on whatever you order.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandy-2
Steve Z.,"Middleburg, VA",4,48,,1.0,1/17/2014,Awful dreck just like every other one in the chain. Why people go here escapes me.  Not even remotely good,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandy-2
HaiDang N.,"Pocatello, ID",135,4,,1.0,8/11/2014,"I was really disappointed with my visit to my local TGIF Fridays in Sandy, Utah. We walked in to an empty restaurant and told it would be a 10 minute wait. After our wait the host pointed us to a table and handed me our menus. Our server was great but upon ordering we were told that they were out of Parmesan fries which was super disappointing to us all because we love those fries! Over all I would give our visit a 1/5 stars. Really disappointing from what we have come to expect from TGIF Friday's. On another note someone knocked over a glass and it was left there for 3-5 minutes with guest walking over it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandy-2
Jodi C.,"Filer, ID",7,71,13,1.0,5/4/2013,The service at this TGI Fridays is the worst! We live in Midvale but travel to the West Valley City TGI Fridays instead of coming to the southtowne one.  We have been here 3 times and the service gets worse every time! We won't be back to this one!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandy-2
Steve S.,"Draper, Salt Lake City, UT",70,36,,4.0,7/15/2011,Much improved menu - especially the seafood. the Ahi tuna I had on a salad was as good as I have ever had. The rewards program is also better than any others I use.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sandy-2
