The waitress and waiters were working their b.....s off walking back and forth like little ants, cleaning bring food, taking orders I must say they were tired. I was after I eat this delicious burger that was so juicy and well done. What can I write I'm coming back to eat this delicious food. The end.

Mikana B.,"Glenview, IL",52,3,,1.0,7/9/2017,"If I could I'd rate this location a 0. Poor customer service from walking in the door. As we walked in no one greeted us. The manager was standing at the stand with the hostess and another server, her back was turned to us the entire time. When we asked for a booth they denied us our choice of seating even though there were a few booths open. There was very little interaction and just poorly executed customer service. We left before we ordered. I'd rather give my money to someone who actually wants our business. No wonder this place was dead compared to all the other restaurants in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-schaumburg?start=20

Shirin K.,"Mount Prospect, IL",0,2,4,1.0,6/11/2017,I really don't recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a food burger and appetizer the quality isn't really good.

Sandra Y.,"Chicago, IL",292,146,349,1.0,3/7/2016,"Don't go here. Slow service and crappy food. I used to come here when they do endless apps just to try the new apps. Each time they do it, it gets worse and worse.  The service was so slow even with an almost empty restaurant. After we ordered the app, it took forever and every new time we got our apps, it got saltier and saltier. They are skimpy on the meat too. Basically they want you to get full on the carbs (bread, tostada, wonton skins, etc). The potstickers had very little filling. The ""new"" tostadas were mostly some weird salty, sweet white sauce and wilted cilantro. There was barely any braised bbq beef. Like a tiny piece on each. My flatbread barely had chicken on it... mostly bread. The last time I ordered the flatbread, there was NO chicken. I mean, they barely put chicken as it is.... but still! This used to be one of the best endless apps, but they ruined it! I brought it to attention from my server but he just apologized. He didn't offer to fix it or anything. All he did was ask if we wanted to order dessert... Nice. I'm pretty sure the manager brought us our flatbread and I'm sure he could see there was no chicken but he still brought it. Idk what that says about the service there. You can tell the servers don't want you to order more. They act like it! They weren't like that before.. idk what happened. So disappointing because their endless apps used to be good! It's only $12/person but I still feel like I was ripped off. It used to be $10/person and they raised the price. That's understandable, but what isn't is the quality of the food and service getting worse and worse. I most definitely will not be coming back and I hope you don't either. Save your money and your appetite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-schaumburg?start=20

Juanita Z.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,9,2,2.0,8/26/2017,Customer service needs improvement. Second time I've been there. The first time I went was for advertised special dine-in only. So I had them serve me two meals I took one bite and had them package the rest. The second time the people working there didn't have a clue of the menu or what to do. I mean really I asked for chicken fingers and they said they didn't have any then I looked at the menu and realized it was chicken tenders.

Pam F.,"Addison, IL",41,51,2,1.0,7/24/2017,"My husband and I decided to go there on a Monday evening after some shopping. We started by ordering pop. We got the impression the waitress was disappointed we did not order alcoholic beverages. I ordered a french dip sandwich. The sandwich came without the au jus. The au jus is what makes it a french dip! Unfortunately, the person who brought us our food gave it to us and left right away. This meant I had to flag down our waitress to tell her it was missing the au jus. The chef must have forgotten about to get prepare it, because it took awhile for the waitress to return. She quickly left after she gave it to me so we had to flag her down again because my husband wanted a refill on his pop. She never asked how things were and she never asked if we needed anything.  After the meal, I went to the washroom. The lock on the stall I went into would not lock. I could tell the person in the stall next too me had the same problem. The sink splashed water everywhere and I could not get the paper towel dispenser to work.

I was wholeheartedly let down when our waitress told us she wasn't going to fill up our drinks every fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes is a substantial as well as appropriate amount of time to finish a Dr Pepper. This act of pure communism has not and will not go unnoticed. I recommend that unless you voted for Stalin last election you don't attend this disgraceful establishment. Not to mention the Jack Daniels burger tasted more like the whisky bottle than meat.

Tom S.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",3,23,8,3.0,11/25/2016,First off let me say I was just happy they're open on Thanksgiving night. I appreciate that they also have families so they would like to be with and it was nice meeting up and go somewhere to eat on the holiday. The service was top-notch can't say enough about it. From the host to the bartender and to a waitress everyone was very nice polite. But once once last call came everybody was in hyper mode to hurry up and get out there as quick as possible. I got the 3 apps for like 11 99 or something like that and I thought it was a good deal but as soon as started  eating it it just didn't seem right. The wings were okay but I only ate a few of them because it didn't seem right. The cheese sticks very soft and not taste was bland. The pretzel sticks were great. Still hungry I got the desert brownies with ice cream. Meh is how i rank this dessert. The kiddo liked it but shes 6.  Overall I left there with a party of three and a tab of $60. Not bad. I also left with an upset stomach that has carried over into today.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-schaumburg?start=40

I ordered the new  SICILIAN STACKED BURGER, and so did one of my co-workers.  It was good, but a little overwhelming after I kept at it.  It was stacked with so much.  By the end I had picked it apart and was eating just what I wanted.   My co-worker ordered some type of salad that was supposed to have apricots and kale in it.. we never located either but she said the salad was good despite it.   Another of my co-workers ordered a cajun pasta which was fell in love with.   For some reason the waitress never came back to check on us, which was an issue because we had received the wrong drinks.   Nevertheless, we settled for what we had.  I wouldnt say that was a game breaker which is why i was still able to give it 4 stars.  (I would say that is why here tip was not as large as it could have been.)

Forget the 2 for $20/25/30 deals because this deal allows each individual person to get their own appetizer and entrée.  We chose the BBQ Chicken Flatbread, Spicy White Cheddar Queso Dip, and both ordered the Jack Daniel's Burger for an entrée. $20 bought you a lot more food than expected - we had to take two boxes home.  In addition to the 2 for $10 deal, TGI Fridays also has a daily special like half off appetizers and $6 burgers.

She got the steak sizzler w spinach and mashed potatoes . I ordered the turkey burger w broccoli instead of fries and we shared a pick three app.  At first the service was a but slow but we were chatting and in no hurry so we didnt mind. The app was great. Their pretzels and cheese, boneless wings and pot stickers are always very good. Their potato skins are very crispy and over fried , lots of oil coming from them. Our meals came and i cut into my turkey burger and took a bite, it was so dry yet juicy in the middle. It wasnt too hot either so it might have been sitting waiting for my friends steak to be done. I told our waitress and she took it back and got me a new one, i asked for cheese this time hoping it would help. The new one was great and not dry at all. She came and checked back to make sure all was ok and it was. My friend gave her info for the free meal and when she cane back she let us know that she took my turkey burger off the bill bc i had to wait for the new one . That is great customer service and she didnt have to do that. She got a bigger tip bc of it too and I let her know I would be letting Yelp know who to see when they to to TGIF in Schaumburg . Her name is Alicia , there was a survey in the bottom of our receipt to fill out for a free app next time we came in but i didnt know we only had 48 hrs to fill it out so it expired already .

The waitress must have forgotten our appetizer because we got the soup and burger first. We mentioned it to another waitress who was fast to resolve the issue. The manager came to our table to apologize and got a bunch of apologies all around. Honestly, it wasn't even a big deal for us. They didn't even charge us for our appetizers which was nice of them but again we didn't mind the slip up, it happens. What I didn't care for was the food and my drink. My drink was too cloyingly sweet with hardly any vodka in it. The French onion soup was super salty. The potato skins were dry and kind of burnt from sitting in hot oil and my husbands burger must have originated from a frozen patty because it was leaking water.

We ordered two salads, I had the Yucatan Chicken Salad, which is great, and she got the Pecan Crusted Chicken Salad, which was equally delicious.  We would have loved to enjoy our lunch, and our conversation, but it was almost impossible as this guy WOULD NOT leave us alone to eat!  He kept walking by our table, butting in to our conversation and was just overall ruining our afternoon.  We could not get out of there quick enough, we asked for the check, paid and split!  I will probably not go back on a Saturday afternoon again, just in fear of having to deal with this bartender!!

Also, a new steak came out piping hot, with a fresh side of broccoli and it was actually delicious :)  Here's where they won my heart: they only charged me for my drink. My one drink.  Amazing!! If run-of-the-mill family dining restaurants are seeking to win over my demographic (after-work alcohol drinker who eats a meal so I won't get too tipsy to drive home), this is what gets me coming back.

Chris W.,"Chicago, IL",347,512,42,5.0,1/18/2010,"I haven't had a 3 course meal at a restaurant since Bennigan's was still around and they had their deal. However, this was even better food! Two great friends and I came here after an hour at Gameworks and wanted to wind down. We were starving but also looking for something to drink. Honestly, we were looking for Houlihan's because I was told they serve pitchers of long island iced tea. Sounds good.  So tra la la we're driving. Oh, I think we missed it, wait. Where are we?! Oh no, all we see is Hooters (not in the mood for beer thanks) and TGI Friday's. Well...alright. Let's give it a shot. Wait time was a little less than what they said (15 minutes) and we got a nice private booth in the back. It was quiet, out of the way, and so very nice. We asked for a booth and that was the nicest one imo.  Drinks first: We had some kind of Hawaiian drink with a light rum that was nice, but after my friend and I tried our third friends' Tropical Berry Mojito Shaker we were like ""WTF EFF THIS"" and decided to order one of those to share. It was about 3 drinks each shaker, our server was hardcore all about keeping things not sticky even before he poured them and after he shook them. It was so refreshing, so lovely and smooth and amazing. The third round of them we got (we ordered a couple to split after that first one between the three of us and got a nice deal out of it all in the end) was more potent than the last two. Either way, we got pretty tipsy, and thanks to the timing of our food and some water we felt just plain normal and fulfilled leaving. Oh and stuffed.  Then food: We all got 3 course meals for 12.99 each. There was a side with 16.99 3 course meals too on that particular menu flap so beware what you're looking at. One side has 'higher end' food like ribs and things I suppose. We shared crispy green bean fries (THE BEST THING I'VE EVER HAD!) well, that's how I feel at the moment at least. They were so much more amazing than I had believed they could be. Also, little mozzarella sticks, but they weren't sticks they were the shape of spam, so kind of rectangular with rounded edges. But longer than spam and without the spam. Marinara sauce in the middle. So good. Huge portions of everything by the way. Lastly, pot stickers. Not little bitch ones either. I believe it was 6 chunky pot stickers with a dark sauce in the middle. Very good. Entrees were just as delish. Both of my friends had some sort of chicken breast sizzling thing with cheese and mashed potatoes and all of that. I had a Sicilian sandwich with french fries and I couldn't even finish it. It had chicken and pepperoni and cheese and...please just eat it okay? It'll change your mind about veganism. FO' REALZ!  Dessert was perfect to finish the meal off with. We had an ultimate brownie which was soft and full of fudge and vanilla ice cream melting over it all sensuously a delicately presented tall piece of vanilla bean cheesecake. Then our last trio dish was a peanut butter pie, delish. Delish. DE-lish. Everything was so wonderful.  Our server: Adorable flamin' gay black guy who was super fun to talk to especially when we were tipsy. He actually had recommendations for us when I asked (always a plus, means you actually give a crap about where you're working and you have a taste for something there) and was super sweet the whole time. We gave him a nice tip. Overall: Less than 100 dollars for 3 three course meals, 3-4 rounds of drinks, and a really great time with friends in a nice quiet booth we ended up enjoying the hell out of. I'd totally come back here again with friends. Decent food quality, not like Zed 451 or anything but not like McDonald's either! Not a great spot for a date, but hey, I dare TGI Friday's to give me an even more enjoyable dinner if I ever go back! I almost don't want to based on the consistent 3-4 star quality dinners at TGI Fridays' on average.

Gone are the long, peninsula-shaped wood bars; now the bar is off to one side, and its small.  And who doesn't long for the days of the suspenders covered in buttons- the trademarks lampooned in ""Office Space""?  Like it or not, they were conversation-starters, and for the vast majority of the staff, it reflected at least a part of their personality.   For the most part, the staff is still friendly, but now they are all wearing corporate-casual polo shirts that would be equally at home at a Target, especially given how small the logo is, I'm sure its a mistake that's been made more than once. In my experience, the food, drink, and service at TGI Friday's has always been consistently good, but where's the irreverence?  Where's the personality that imprinted itself on my psyche so many years ago?  How you you any different now, TGI Friday's, than Applebee's, Ruby Tuesday, Houlihan's (who, I think, hired the same designer as TGI Friday's to try to get the same look and feel, further blurring the line between the two), or any of the other chain ""bar and grills"" out there?  I want to believe in you, TGI Friday's, and I still have my GoldPoints card (not that its seen the light of day in ages)... give me a reason to come back...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-schaumburg?start=100

They advertise their 3-course meals for $12.99, so my son and I both ordered that.  We had the appetizers (green bean fries and fried mac & cheese).  The appetizers were good.  I ordered the Asian Garlic Chicken and my son ordered the Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta.  I swear that I'm not that picky of an eater... but when I got my plate, I just found it to be not good.  I rarely, if ever, send back my food and order something else, but in this case I just didn't like it.  So then, in its place, I ordered the Argentinean Rubbed Flat Iron Steak.  I think they were trying to do a chimichurri-type sauce, but it just didn't work.  I didn't like that either and I sent it back.  At that point, I was done trying.  I didn't want to order anything else.  The manager said they would take it off my bill.  But when I got the bill, they had charged me for the appetizer.  When I pointed it out to the waiter-who-really-wasn't-that-good-and-didn't-really-seem-to-care, he took the ticket back... and proceeded to bring me back another ticket... this time it was a dollar more (for that appetizer).  My son wanted to send back his food too, but his food was ok... just not enough flavor.  When you think shrimp/cajun/alfredo... you expect more flavor.  Not so.  I spoke to the manager again and she thought it was fair that she was charging me for an appetizer.  I was pretty pissed off, at this point.  I went ahead and paid the bill, w/no tip.  As a former waitress, I'm fully aware... and quite frankly, I don't think I have ever NOT left a tip.   As I was leaving, the manager was standing at the door.  I said to her, ""The right thing to do would have been to take the meal off of my ticket and left it at that"".  She tried to explain herself again, but then said ""If you want me to give you a coupon for a free appetizer for next time...""  I said, ""No thank you.  It's too late for that"". Is this the norm for Chicago??  Is customer service dead??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-schaumburg?start=100
Stephanie L.,"West Chicago, IL",4,12,1,1.0,1/19/2016,Came in for lunch break because I was craving a jack daniels burger-my usual order when I come to this restaurant.

We were seated promptly (Saturday night) and our server was attentive - giving us time to peruse the menu. (We have a tendency to talk too much and not look at the menus right away.)  He always brought drink refills - always before we had even polished off the last of our drinks.  Awe-some!  I wish I remembered his name!  He was a Hispanic guy, perhaps in his 40s. We ordered two appetizers to share:  the BBQ Chicken Flatbread and the Warm Pretzels with Beer-Cheese Dipping Sauce.  I hate to admit it, but the Pretzels were REALLY good: warm, mushy, and lightly salted.  The Beer-Cheese didn't have any beer taste..it just tasted like a light cheese to me, but it was alright.  The Flatbread was OK - pretty light.  I'm glad it didn't have much cheese.  Overall it was a pretty good Friday's experience. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-schaumburg?start=60

Nicole F.,"Schaumburg, IL",0,3,1,1.0,7/16/2014,"Unfriendly welcome into a cold atmosphere, literally and figuratively, when asked to be seated at a booth by the window the hostess' response was those are dirty. How much effort does it take to clean the table??  I also would have been willing to wait for them to clean the table, but apparently that was not an option. We were seated towards the back of the restaurant that is very poorly lit. I was snooping through their drink menu and it smelled like barf with stains on it.  Ordered my steak medium rare and it came back medium-well. Asked for the manager and they offered to replace it with a new one (I don't believe in wasting food so I refused). Not only was the steak bad, but the mashed potatoes were very bland. Tasted even worse than something could come out of the box. Mac and Cheese had a burnt buttered noodle. Hardly any cheese and they use penne rigate as their pasta. After we called the manager to the table to let her know about the food, the waitress became very hostile and upset at us as she would make as little contact as she could with us. There is a sign on the door that advertises free WiFi. As I tried to login to it, their website failed to work. I asked the waitress why it might not be working and she simply just shrugged her shoulders.  As soon as I finished my meal I still felt hungry, for the amount of money I spent there I would much rather have gone 20 miles to Crystal Lake and dined at Texas Road house and received proper service and food.

The smell was so bad I held my bladder for the rest of the afternoon so that I could avoid going back in. The water they served also had a funny smell to it which I was attributing to their sewage issue. If it weren't for the restroom issue I would have given another star.

So bad that the manager had to come take our order after our waitress apparently insisted we order 2 mins after we sat down by looking over us while we wanted to gaze at the menu! Like do we have to order when you insist? So politely asked her to give us a couple mins...

I bring it to the waitresses notice, she mumbles some half assed apology and goes on to get me another glass.. Okay cool, I guess I can deal with this. We wait for our food and a couple mins later we get our order... Not bad I think things are looking up! Wrong, Wrong! Things are about to get worse, my friend! I get the pick 3 apps(boneless wings, friend green beans and LOADED potatoes) as my entree. I've spelt LOADED with caps because the only thing they were loaded with was burnt cheese.

I laid out all three trays on the lobby bench and to my surprise; one of the three orders was fully correct.  Roger the Mgr was quite helpful and got me the two lost and missing sides in a timely manner.  One other minor complaint, is that Maria the hostess was more focus on training a new hostess than helping a customer pick-up his online order.   Unsure if I should buy the (1.) ribs a la Carte to avoid any mistakes, (2.) give another chance so eventually the order will be correct or (3.) order on any other day but Friday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-schaumburg
