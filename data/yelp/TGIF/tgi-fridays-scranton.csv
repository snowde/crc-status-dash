Laura M.,"Jessup, PA",0,2,,4.0,9/1/2014,"We were greated quickly by Lois.  My husband forgot his reading glasses and she was very helpful.  She even checked the lost and found to see if there was a pair he could use. My husband had the sizzling chicken and shrimp.  The food was seasoned very well and came out hot and timely.  I had the ribeye and grilled lobster tail.  The ribeye was phenomenal! Had a delish garlic butter sauce on it and it was cooked to my request.  The tails however were not good  at all.  Mushy...not cleaned well and did not taste good at all.  If it wasn't for the tails, I would have given TGI Friday's in Duckson City  5 star rating. I also had the French Onion soup and Wedge salad.  Both delicious!  Will certainly patronize again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scranton
Arcade A.,"Ocean City, MD",0,4,1,4.0,9/7/2016,Drinks were warm and bathrooms were a little cramped but other than that they were ama,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scranton
Jake S.,"Binghamton, NY",0,34,,1.0,4/1/2017,Their new $10 app is a joke four of us went there and after they bought the first set of apps and drinks we did not see the waitress not even to order more drinks !!! If they were smart they would know they make money on their alcoholic drinks that would make up for the apps the 2nd set of Apps were much smaller portion it's ridiculous we will never go back there again not even for drinks and we go there at least five or six times per month!!! Not anymore!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scranton
Madaline H.,"Bronx, NY",64,27,66,5.0,7/8/2015,Lunch is delicious and affordable. Friendly staff. Ordered the broccoli cheddar soup and fried shrimp lunch combo.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scranton
Brett W.,"Sterling, VA",9,17,2,4.0,5/17/2015,Went in for dinner with my son last night (Saturday). The wait was fairly short for a Saturday (10mins) and we had a table. Our server was over to see us quickly and brought our drinks in a few mins as well. Appetizers were great! Our meals arrived not long afterward and we really had a great time. Our server John was by to check on us about 10 times during our visit. He got a good tip because of it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scranton
Matthew G.,"Olyphant, PA",25,38,11,4.0,1/1/2014,"Can't go wrong with TGI Friday's. They have plenty of specials from 2 items for $12 & $15, which includes an appetizer and a meal for $12 or $15. This location is always clean and the staff is friendly.  Don't forget to tell them your a stripes card holder for special perks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scranton
Peter M.,"Scranton, PA",133,182,149,2.0,4/15/2013,"The food is what you'd expect from a Friday's.  Mostly packaged, pre-preped items that require minimal cooking.  I do have to say their new soft pretzel appetizer with beer cheese sauce is pretty awesome and something that my girlfriend and I will stop in for on a regular basis.  Hopefully they'll keep them on the menu. As other reviewers have stated, it does smell a little off inside.  Not overpowering, but you get this weird scent when you walk in the door.  I would have rated three stars, but the service is usually pretty terrible compared to other Friday's I've been to.  Waitstaff seems frusturated most of the time and indifferent to the customer's needs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scranton
D L.,"Cresco, PA",0,40,,2.0,6/22/2015,Hadn't been to Friday's in years. Went Sunday afternoon. So looking forward to their potato skins which were highly memorable. What a disappointment! They were quite different and now nothing special. I ordered the Chipotle Yucatan salad. Sounded great on the menu but it was just a chopped salad with some avocado pieces and shredded chicken. A big letdown. Husband was not impressed with his dish either. We'll go elsewhere next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scranton
E V.,"Lafayette, IN",1,5,,5.0,6/30/2015,"The waiters/waitresses are friendly and usually go out of their way to provide great service! I left my Stripes card there one day and the manager kept it and returned it to me the next time he saw me there. Although the prices are highly inconsistent (that's obviously a corporate thing), the food is consistently good. I've eaten at other TGI Fridays locations and maintain that Dickson City is one of the best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scranton
Jason L.,"Mountain Top, PA",85,280,69,3.0,4/29/2013,"It's your standard TGI Fridays food with slightly above-standard service.  If I'm in the mood, I'm not going to shy away from the place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scranton
Dissatisfied C.,Northeastern United States,1,76,,2.0,9/7/2011,"Not bad as Friday's go, but the management may want the cleaning staff to change out the mop bucket water.  The restaurant stinks of stagnant water, and the overly slippery floors are inviting a slip-and-fall lawsuit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scranton
Tom D.,"Burtonsville, MD",47,115,104,1.0,11/16/2008,"One goes to these places for a meal that you know what you are getting.  However, the polyester food, bland taste, and cold fries make this a do not return for me.  I can buy a box, fry it is some oil and would enjoy it much more!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-scranton
