Alan M.,"Juniper Green, United Kingdom",7,37,,2.0,3/3/2011,This place is far too noisey went to sheffeild under a month ago with GF and some the food was rotton despite that some was good. When I go on holiday or break and have a meal I like the quiet. TGI Fridays was too noisy for my liking.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sheffield
