Mark D.,"San Rafael, CA",523,790,3796,4.0,5/9/2013,"This is a review of lunch with a colleague at T.G.I Fridays. I never thought I would write a four star review for a TGIFs.  But here I am. The staff was very friendly.  Throughout the meal, they were checking to insure everything was going well.  The food came out in a timely manner. The interior is well, very Friday's like.  It is basic.  It is pretty large.  It could use a little better lighting.  It is comfortable though. The food was pretty good.  We both enjoyed our meals. Cheesy Bacon Burger + Ultimate = 2 patties, colby, bacon, mozzarella sticks, onion rings, tomatoes, onions, lettuce - Ok, this is one of those things you only do on a lark.  This was a monster of a burger.  I did take one bite with everything on it.  Then I pulled the mozzarella sticks off and ate them separately.  It was actually a very  good burger.  It was cooked more medium than medium rare though.  But, you can only really get the idea of this burger by looking at the photo.  The fries were ok but not great. The official burger description from the menu: My colleague had the ribs and enjoyed them. I do not have the receipt.  It wasn't an inexpensive lunch though.  The burger itself came it at around $30.  This is a correction.  I've actually found the receipt and I am adding it. Receipt (Lunch for Two):  $73.70 Overall - It is a comfortable space.  The staff was friendly.  They were demonstrating an appropriate amount of ""flare"".  We both enjoyed our lunch.  I got to take on a mammoth burger.  That was pretty much an all-around win.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-singapore
Marcus L.,"Singapore, Singapore",539,361,758,3.0,10/18/2013,"Met a friend for a quick coffee at Penny Uni down the road, and as it got muggy, we wandered into I12 for some lunch... and ended up here. It's not that I woulnd't normally come here  - I'm quite a fan of American diner food (less so when it is overpriced), but when you see a lunch deal, it's quite hard to resist. $9.90 for a burger meal? Hmmm. Slathered with Jack Daniels sauce? Okay you got me. In we go, and get this burger ordered. It's pretty quiet, so the service seems a whole lot more attentive - they got us drinks quickly, refilled water when it was empty, and otherwise were not nosy. I got the $4 add-on which got me a soup (clam chowder was my pick) and a Coke, which rounded off the meal nicely. The burger with Jack Daniels sauce? It wasn't bad, and if you told me that I'd get that with fries, soup and a drink for $13.90 ++ SGD at a Fridays any where in the world, Id' say that's a good deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-singapore
Gracia O.,"Singapore, Singapore",73,349,360,3.0,8/12/2012,"TGIF understands that many of its patrons have to rush off for movie screenings at the cineplex upstairs, and will readily expedite orders with a smile. We've been back twice because of this accommodating attitude. Food wise, there are hits and misses. The starters are definitely not the star items though they do sound very promising in the menu. The fried mac and cheese was not quite what we'd expected, and turned out as more of a pasta filled croquette. Loaded potato skins were sadly rather dry and left a sandy aftertaste in our mouths.  If you can, go for the mains. The half portion of baby back ribs was fork tender, and generously basted with sweet and smoky Jack Daniel's sauce. Typically, I would not expect such grill joints to have any forte in their pastas, but was pleasantly surprised. Opted for the rigatoni brisket bolognese, and was blown away by the pulled beef brisket, heady tomato sauce and al dente rigatoni. It's so hard to find pasta done right here, as everyone seems to prefer them over boiled, but TGIF's has nailed it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-singapore
Arunima K.,"Singapore, Singapore",4,48,17,3.0,9/5/2012,"Having lived in America for 4 years, I'm not sure what possessed me to venture out to TGIF last night for dinner but nonetheless, there I found myself. We came in at about 7pm and the restaurant was fairly full for a Wednesday night. We were in time for Happy Hour which offers $2 off a selection of beers, probably one of the least enticing Happy Hour deals yet. However, I highly recommend the Summer Ale which was absolutely delicious. The food was as expected: massive portion sizes and everything was fried or covered in cheese. We started with the Boneless Buffalo Wings which were pretty good, although a bit over cooked. We also ordered the Loaded Potato Skins which were mostly just cheese with a bit of potato and a few crumbs of Bacon. By the time we ordered our mains we were so stuffed we ended up taking everything home. I ordered the Cobb Salad ($18.90) which was ordinary. My friend ordered the Sizzling Chicken and Cheese ($25.90) which was quite yummy. The chicken was marinated really well and was very flavourful. A bit too greasy for my taste but I'd recommend sharing it with someone if you're feeling indulgent. All in all, probably what you'd expect when you enter a TGIF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-singapore
Samuel L.,"Singapore, Singapore",1,318,330,3.0,8/31/2012,"T.G.I.Friday's is a unique all-American casual dining restaurant with not-so-casual prices. The prices are a tad too steep for a normal everyday dinner, so this place is probably more suited for special occasions like birthdays or such.  Went there on a Friday night and it was pretty packed so we had to wait to be seated. The staff were considerate and took initiative in offering us seats outside to sit on while waiting for an available table. Bonus points for that. When asked what their specialties were, the staff referred to the Jack Daniel's Grill, so we ordered half a rack of the Jack Daniel's Ribs ($26.90). The Jack Daniel's sauce was tasty and sweet with a hint of alcohol, while the meat was tender and smoked to perfection. The Cheesy Bacon Cheeseburger was huge and the beef patty was thick. The bun was dry and pretty unpalatable though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-singapore
Eric D.,"Diepenveen, The Netherlands",9,2,1,3.0,9/19/2013,"Food is good, but waiters must either be in training or are not clever enough to understand the work they do. My main course was brought to me three times: once before the starter, once during and finally after the starter.  One would think that the word itself was self explanatory: STARTER... One STARTS with it...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-singapore
Ch T.,"Joo Chiat, Singapore, Singapore",0,21,,3.0,4/23/2013,"Decent pub food, attentive service. Overpriced, even during happy hour. One if those places to go when you can expense it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-singapore
