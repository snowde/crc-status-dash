Jackie C.,"Melbourne, Australia",14,3,9,5.0,6/6/2016,"We had a great time at TGI Southbank last Friday.  With such a large group, Our waiter, Vish, done an amazing job. He always had a smile on his face and such a pleasant manner.  I will definitely come back again in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southbank
Harold S.,"Vernon, Canada",1,79,106,3.0,12/8/2017,If you are here from United States and craving a TGI Fridays experience the menu is quite similar but it won't have all your favorites. Warning... Expect to pay at least double and forget about  happy hour with all the Half price appetizers!  They have happy hour from 4 PM to 6 PM every day but it's only $5 wine and beer. If you are from Australia take sure to try one of these restaurants in the USA if you want to find out what the real experience is like... it's awesome!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southbank
Michael W.,"Melbourne, Australia",28,192,138,3.0,11/26/2015,"Well I thought it would be only decent to update my review, as my last experience at TGI's was absolutely awful, or should I say non-existent service at the front door lead us to walk out.  On this visit, even though it was fairly busy, we were greeted at the front door very quickly. The wait staff were nice & helpful (except they forgot to give us, and it seems many other patrons that walked in the door, the special Thanksgiving Day menu). Being thanksgiving day, we obviously had to go the roast turkey. It was very tasty & extremely filling. Disappointing that they weren't very willing to promptly get us the free soft drink refills without us asking.  Other than that, the restaurant was fairly clean, and we got much better service than our last visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southbank
Dang T.,"South Wharf, Australia",4,3,,4.0,5/9/2017,"It's great, price is expensive and the taste is not equal to TGI Houston, Texas. Service staff is great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southbank
Stephen D.,"Adelaide, Australia",32,33,16,4.0,7/25/2014,The food for a chain restaurant is actually extremely good. It is a bit noisy but that is made up with great food and service.  They know how to cook steak and other meats.  I had a steak and it was perfectly cooked. Their vegetables are nicely cooked and their mashed potatoe is nice and creamy. I will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southbank
Dee H.,"Auckland, New Zealand",0,16,2,4.0,8/21/2015,"A great dinner destination for families. Especially on Friday nights when Southbank is full of after work drinkers. All our meals were nice, there were other families with young children and slightly older children. Other patrons were tolerant of kids. They had a kids menu, and colouring activity page and crayola crayons. Their wine menu had some nice selections. Staff were friendly and attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southbank
