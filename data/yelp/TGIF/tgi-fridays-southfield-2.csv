Amy B.,"Rochester, MI",547,1181,306,2.0,9/23/2017,"I don't go to Friday's often, but when I do, I really expect better.  My boss brought us here for a staff meeting and luncheon the other day, and it didn't go as well as we would have liked. (the food not the meeting. LOL) We walked in and the place was relatively quiet for a Wednesday afternoon.  Mostly a few tables of office workers having lunch with one or two folks sitting alone at the bar.  We were seated in the back since we were a party of 9, and our server was pretty decent. We had a variety of appetizers which were pretty darn good.  We also had a breadbasket which I liked since the bread sticks tasted a lot like the ones from Olive Garden. yummy!  Things started getting messy towards the end of our experience when the food started to arrive. Once we were all ready to order, she took our orders and off she went. The problem was tow fold.  First, our meals came out in shifts. like 5 or 10 minutes apart.  For a minute I was cool with it, but as she worked her way down the table, it got slower and slower.  By the time she got to both my coworkers spot and mine, it had been darn near 20 minutes at this point. to make matters worse, she realized that we had been the first two to order, and still had no food. The waitress frantically went to the kitchen to see where our food was at and realized that the cooks must have overlooked it. I  don't blame the waitress, but the cooks clearly weren't able to complete the whole order in a timely fashion.  We think they overlooked our two orders and just forgot. Our poor waitress apologized profusley to the point that by the time our dishes came out, it had been a grand total of 30 minutes.  Plus, everyone else was done eating at their lunches and the meeting was pretty much over. Even though I wasn't angry, the timing of the whole thing was off. I know we are a larger party of 9, but somethings going on in the kitchen that things aren't getting executed correctly.  It shouldn't take 30 minutes for a table to get their food if all the orders were put in at the same time. Also, when we walked out, I did take a keen eye to the rest of the place since we had discussed the slow service of food.  Things i noticed were multiple tables still with loads of dirty dishes on the end, a broken door handle at the entrance, an overflowing ash tray that clearly hasn't been emptied in days at the front of the store.  It kind of makes you wonder who's managing the place.  It's a series of failures all the way around that lead me to this review. I probably won't return to this location unless I'm dragged here against my will.  Place needs to work on their execution.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2
Sarah L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,,1.0,1/9/2018,"This is by far the WORST tgi we've ever been to. There is a romaine lattice recall so apparently they do not sell salad there anymore but when we called and placed an order for salad they took the money and didnt say a word about not having salad in the bag. When we found out that the salad was missing, we called the manager named ""car"" and she was very short with her words and didnt want to hear about it. She was quick to say she will place a refund but no real apology for messing up the order. The appetizer sampler wings were very dry and brown as if they used old oil to fry them. Their potato skins were chewy and tasted salty and dry. Even the celery wasn't fresh.  Not only their food is terrible but the whole management is very unprofessional and rude.  Please do not go to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2

Darrell K.,"Ypsilanti, MI",671,317,677,3.0,10/7/2017,I have visited here various times in the past when I lived in the area. It is an ok spot. It really has become a hang out location and bar/restaurant location. It gets to be a club spot the later it gets. It gets to be a hip hop friendly crowd. The staff and bar are friendly people.  I ordered an appetizer and it took forever to get the order. I had to just cancel it.

Shauna R.,"Buffalo, NY",16,84,167,2.0,8/16/2017,"If in the southfield area, go somewhere else! I'm upgrading my review from 1 star to 2 because I know our waitress worked really hard to get our party of 8 everything we needed while being VERY understaffed. Service was still absurdly slow, we waited over and hour for our food after ordering! Hit or miss here apparently so it's probably better to just try out a local restaurant instead. Biggest overall confusion was with their reservation/call ahead system and if it exists or not. We called at 11am and they said to call ahead an hour before. We called an hour before arrival and was told they don't do call ahead seating. We arrived and were told it would be a 30 minute wait (which we clearly tried to avoid). We asked if sitting 4 and 4 would help and she told us no and that we would be sat as 8 (giving us no choice) and then sat us in five minutes. The confusion and discussion was not a great start.  The restaurant wasn't very clean either. Food came out eventually and everyone had what they ordered for the most part. Food tasted like every other Fridays but the service and wait and confusion make it 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2
Jassmine N.,"Detroit, MI",104,120,666,5.0,2/8/2017,"What a treat! I took my family to Friday's last Saturday afternoon. It had to be about 1:30 pm in the early afternoon. I chose Friday's because we haven't been in a while and felt it was time to revisit. Not only that, I have been receiving an influx of coupons (BOGO entrée's) in my inbox, so what the heck, why not.  I grabbed my BOGO coupon and headed in. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the friendly hostesses. The dining areas weren't overly crowded, and we were seated immediately. It was only, my husband and daughter with me, but we were placed in a spacious booth comfy booth.  I have to admit, in the back of my mind, I kept revisiting the last memory I had at ""Club"" Friday's, and I was a bit hesitant of going. Luckily for us, we arrived on a quiet and slow afternoon.  Upon being seated, we were greeted by our server, Artemisi. She was over the top friendly and helpful. I usually don't include server's names in my reviews. However, I like to ensure they know they made a great impression and rendered exceptional service. What I like best about our server, was her patience, service speed and an incredible memory of the menu.  The food and beverages were great! After using my BOGO coupon and rewards account, I was able to get a free dessert on my next visit. Not only that, I received another BOGO entrée coupon the next day in my inbox. Friday's is really trying to make a good impression on me I see. I'll be back to make sure this wasn't a one hit wonder.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2

Roslyn D.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",0,1,,1.0,10/30/2017,"Southfield location. restaurant almost empty when we got there. our waitress had just us and one other table to serve. Now, I never write reviews and I know waitresses have a lot of stress sometimes(I was one for many years). But our waitress was terrible!. No smile. rolling eyes. cut us off when we were in the middle of ordering cause we didn't order fast enough',Complete bad attitude.  the meal took forever to come(for no one really in the restaurant). The place needs a total makeover! The chairs were dirty and had food in between the ladder back chairs and you can tell they were stuck on grease and food that's been there for a very long time. the floors/carpet needed shampooing.the ceiling were we sat was caving in from water damage.. The seats had a wooden bar under them which made your butt hurt LOL. just not a good atmosphere at all. BUT I looked across a few seats and there was another waitress that you could tell was having a hard day and she told her customers about it in a funny way and said things positive and she still managed a really sweet smile and laughed. She spoke well and served her people,without a grim face or attitude. How come we couldn't have had that waitress!!?? Well we finally ate and we only stayed 20 minutes after the food came. I have to say I gave 1 STAR* cause the food was good*  So the one person in our group paid the bill and left a really good tip for her(why? i do not know). but she had the audacity to come by, grab the money and said "" are you done? is this it? my friend said yes,, she then literally snatched the money did not say thank you, or have a nice day, or was everything all right? NOTHING just snatched it and walked away. Look we did not ask for any extras, never had her go get anything for us, we just took what she gave us. was pleasant and smiled at her and I tell ya' we got nothing out of this woman. I mean NOTHING! Terrible experience!. never going back there again. I have been to most of the Fridays and it was clean and wonderful service but this one is horrible!  A waitress can make a big difference when eating in a shabby restaurant and god forbid I have to go there again but I will not sit in her area. #Ghetto Experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2

McKenna W.,"Newport, KY",1,4,,1.0,4/8/2017,"Very disappointing visit. Called ahead at 3PM to make reservation for 24 people at 5:15PM. We understand we are a large group but like to think we are easy to serve.. only order waters and order quickly.  When we arrived the restaurant was not busy and the manager didn't seem to know what to do with us. We explained ahead of time and once we got there that we were fine with being split up into as many groups/tables as they needed. Waited 30minutes to be seated. My group of 12 was seated about 10minutes after the first group. Waitress was very friendly but seemed frazzled. Waited an hour for food to come out. First group that sat waited an hour and 45min for their food. Needless to say we were getting cranky and very hungry.  Suggest going in small groups. Reservations don't seem to matter...

H M.,"Southfield, MI",0,8,,1.0,10/20/2017,"I have been to many Fridays Restaurants state to state, but never one like this one.  Although I thought the food was pretty good, I stopped going to this one a few years ago.  I wanted to try the Big Ribs from the food porn ads on TV.  So I ordered a carry out, they tell me it's a full rack with two sides.   What I received was nothing like the food shown in the ads.  The rib was very small, short  bones (not sure if it was a baby back or not) and 8 thick bones with not very much of the dry meat.  It was completely charred on the back and sitting over the fries that we couldn't eat because the charring got all over the fries and blackened them.   A very tiny cup of cole slaw, maybe enough for 4 year old.  I guess they figure it's easy to slip the bad food that should have gone into the garbage into a wrapper and a bag for someone ordering carryout; (avoids dealing with it in the restaurant where people all around can hear); but don't they know they are going to be reviewed where people from everywhere can find out?!

Toilet paper all over the floor.  Complain to my friend who said her last experience at another TGIFs was horrible too. (Why we come here Idk) Back to bar- bar is dirty at every seat. Couple minutes later bartender wipes up and asks what we want. Order drinks & apps. Ask for ranch, almost 10 min later here comes the ranch I ordered, I'm done eating at that point. Ask to see drink menu again & bartender has lots of attitude, can't find one, annoyed with us. We say nvm we'll have a beer. She walks around, 10 min ltr oh ya, a beer. We ask for check and box. Box is only thing that came in a timely manner.  Every single bartender was unfriendly, and seemed annoyed with every request we had. My friend tips far more than they deserved.

I would say the only real compelling reason to come here now is the bar; I say that without having ever sat at it. The Jack Daniel's menu used to be excellent but it seems to have gone slightly downhill. Pulled Pork Tennessee sammich is still quite good, but not worth the $10 in my opinion. For $10, you can get great Thai food to feed two people. Meh. My business will be going elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2?start=40
Jay B.,"Southfield, MI",0,6,1,1.0,11/24/2012,"Southfield lacks major chain restaurants like Applebee's, ruby Tuesday's, chills  and just about every other national chain that can be found on m59.... So Fridays has benefited from lack of nationally backed competition. I am sure this place is a cash cow because it proximity to Detroit and the fact that Detroit also suffers from the lack of big chains, makes this Fridays the destination for a lot of young people. I would not be surprised if its one of there top grossers in the area as there is a lot of drinking going on there.  This Fridays is not family friendly most days and weekends after 8pm, it's basically a night club with bouncers on the door and all!  If your not connected or a regular customer, don't expect to get a drink quickly. The food is standard Fridays.. So not much to say there, if you been to Fridays before and like their food.. It's the same stuff, just expect it to be poorly cooked and delivered too you slowly.  The restaurant is not very clean and during on visit when picked up tri-fold menu from the center of the table, it released a roach...  Needless to say we left!  I am young and thus many of my friends often force me into hitting Fridays before going downtown...  I don't eat, just drink. Good place to hook up and meet young people, I would not take a date or kids there after 5pm, management is rude based on the clientele they get... There has been a lot of fights and one shooting there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2?start=40

Then , after getting a table, the waitress came and took our drink orders.  5 minutes later she came to take the food order (still no drinks) and had no information to provide about the rib special that had been going on all week. She left to find out more info. Came back five minutes later; still , no drinks. A few minutes after taking our food order, returned to ask what kind of dressing we wanted on our salads. Still without drinks or even water on her tray. Folks at the next table were overheard saying ,""wow. Wondering how long the food is going to take."" The music was DEAFENING and we asked the hostess if she could turn it down a bit. She said , ""Ummm.... no."" That's it. Not, ""let me get the manager. "" Or, "" I'll find out for you."" Just ""No.""  We are now 20 minutes into our stay. Still..... you guessed it....no drinks. No table ware. No food. My husband and I looked at each other, grabbed our coats, and left.

My brother jokingly said he felt like we were at a club in ATL.  Our meal was good.  Always Good. The atmosphere at this particular place is kind of iffy, depending on what time of the day it is and which day of the week as well.  If you want to have a meal without all the noise and a packed restaurant, go for lunch during the middle of the week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and MAYBE Thursday).  But if you go to this restaurant during the weekend, be prepared.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2?start=60

While all of this is going on, the tables in all other sections of the restuarant are also packed, with more of the club crowd looking types, as well as some of the general family crowd just trying to enjoy their wings and cheesesticks.  (At this point, the teacher in me was momentarily distracted from the hot club mess going on, and more concerned with, why the hell are there so many people bringing their small children out to eat at 11:00 on a weeknight? But I digress....) I stayed for a couple of hours and the whole time I just kept thinking, ""what is going on right now.""  Fortunately I had a hilarious companion with me whose observations summed up the evening perfectly: - ""Pretty soon I'm gonna have to be paying cover just to get my damn plate of cajun alfredo."" - ""You realize some of these people must have started getting ready at 6:00 to come out here tonight."" - ""There is a BMX bike hanging on the wall....and he is wearing a fur.""

Sunday night, not dead, but not super busy either. As at least one other person mentioned in a previous, really loud (football crowd at the bar). Like can't hear the person next to you loud. Not blaming the restaurant itself for that, but still very annoying. The rest kind of went like this. Seated promptly. First sight of server, probably 10 minutes later. Drink order take, easily 10-15 minutes before a beer and glass of wine arrived. We weren't sure on food, and made the mistake of not getting that out of the way. Because it was probably another 10-15 minutes before she came back for that. Ordered an app only, which took another 20 minutes easy. And then made the mistake of order another beer which took another 10-15 minutes before it arrived. I was keeping a look out for her to try to cancel it, by the time I saw her again, she was delivering it By that time, we were ready to go, and I drank about half of it before just saying screw it, let's go. Too tired to complain or have it removed from the bill. The one mistake I didn't make is when she brought the last beer, I had my credit card out to pay before she could even put the guest check on the table.   I don't think it was her fault, she seemed to be running around- they were either understaffed, poorly managed, or both.  Food was the only decent part of the visit, and let me tell you, it was mediocre at best. You could have made the same in your kitchen from jarred products and frozen food in 8 minutes. But my expectations for places like this are low enough that sadly, it was about what I expected so I wasn't really disappointed.  I was pretty involved in conversation, or I would have been far more annoyed than I was.  But believe the other reviews, this places SUCKS. Burn this bitch down! TGI Friday is usually off my radar, this was more of a convenience situation.  But this place succeed not only in guaranteeing I will never go back, not only to this location, but probably to any of their locations ever. Also, security on Sunday nite? They guys were polite, opened the door on our way out, and on a positive note, at least they are concerned about your safety.

I'll break it down into three categories: food, service and ambiance. Food- honestly, its usually good. Often times the menu go has items that are no longer available so prepare to pick a back of entree or two. Also they are very unaccommodating with substitutions, so don't bother with that. I usually only go when they are offering the endless apps but be aware it takes a long time to get the food, but it's usually hot when it comes.  Service- this is where it's really hit or miss. I've been there before and had waitresses that were on the rude side, distracted and short with you. I've also had waitresses that are nice enough but I guess from lack of good management they just weren't attentive enough and give off the impression they are to rushed to answer any questions regarding the menu.  Ambiance- this is where this place fails for me. I t y that Fridays is a bar setting and it's going to be loud, however I cannot tolerate the amount of literal screaming that eminates from the upstairs bar and pours into the rest of the resteraunt. Loud talking and general rowdiness is one thing but when adults are behaving like children playing outside,  management should step in and request them to settle down.

Rebecca R.,"Waterford Township, MI",0,1,,1.0,6/21/2017,"This Friday's sucks!!! Server was awful. Didn't come to take our drink order until 15 minutes after we sat down. Took an additional 10 minutes to bring the lemon for our water. Brought each meal out separately, so I'm eating while my friends watch. Brought the wrong salad for my friend didn't bring her dressing. Forgot the bread sticks, and then proceeded to have an attitude and argue with her because she asked for the dressing for her salad. Then they put her food on my bill. The food is not good, the service is horrible here. Don't waste your time or money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2?start=20

Paula H.,"West Rogers Park, Chicago, IL",92,8,1,1.0,3/23/2016,"TGI Fridays TGI Fridays DO NOT EAT AT THE FRIDAYS IN SOUTHFIELD, MI Two weeks ago I decided to invite my friend to lunch and went to the Friday's across the street from my job. We sat at the bar for convenience, where we were served by a woman named Tiffany. For starters Tiffany was very rude to us. When the meal concluded Tiffany handed us a bill at full-price! During Happy Hour! When I brought it to her attention she started yelling at me; "" well you just got your bartender in trouble telling, and this is the right way to do it. I would be crazy to charge it the way your saying""! I politely told her it would be crazy for her to charge me double for something that was half priced and clearly spelled out on the ""HAPPY HOUR MENU""! She corrected the bill and because i had to get back to work, I left my friend with the responsibility of closing out my bill. When i left, my friend called me and told me that she had asked for a cup of ice to go. The bartender took 10 minutes to come back empty handed and said that they did not have any more to go cups, only chidlrens cups and in the most Ghetto Fashion stated ""Do you wanna kid's cup""? Frustrated at the entire situation, my friend left.  The entire situation just did not sit well with me, so I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager Raymond about the situation. He informed me that they did in fact have to go cups and he had just had a conversation with the employee about her poor customer service.  The manager did his best to rectify the issue by offering me free lunch the next time I decided to come in. But what I didn't know is the next time would be worse.... Today I decided to take up the offer  ""free lunch""  from Raymond at Friday's  Whoo Hoo! (Southfield, MI) and ordered endless appetizers. Enjoying my spinach dip, feeling taken care of and satisfied, only to bite down on something so hard it could break my teeth. I almost choked on the object in my mouth and finally got it to a point where I could spit it out. IT WAS SEVERAL PIECES OF WOOD! OMG I could not believe this! The first time I came to this establishment I just got cursed out, but now is TGIFridays trying to kill me?  Raymond the manager just happened to be there today and came over to my table offering free appitizers and dessert. I'm sorry sir but do you think free appitizers is going to make me feel better about the calostomy bag I will have to wear when my intestines are mangled by spliinters from the wood that you guys decided to add to my meal?  I am utterly disgusted, appauled and I will never return to this restaurant again! Be afraid be very afraid of TGI Fridays",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2?start=20
Jacob B.,"Southfield, MI",1,4,,1.0,3/29/2015,"Too bad this can't be a zero star review: Don't bother going and wasting your time here. Stopped in because it looked nice, waited 10 minutes for the ride host to say ""follow me"" and then he tapped the table and tossed the menus down - continued walking with no look back. The appetizers took rather long to come out and really weren't that great. We also stared at our food for at least 5 minutes with no silverware. After our waitress walking by twice, I asked for water because she couldn't get the hint. Asked 15 minutes later, asked 5 minutes after that, and finally got water 30 minutes after initially asking. Nobody here is personable or polite. We received almost no attention from our waitress. Got the bill after a while of waiting. Over all I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at all to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2?start=20
Amanda W.,"Spring Lake, MI",1,6,2,1.0,4/20/2015,"If there was an option for zero stars I would have picked that. I have never felt so unwelcome in a place, to begin with. Once seated at our sticky booth, we could barely talk to one another because it is louder than a night club. You could literally hear it from inside your car in the parking lot. Husband ordered a beer- which came warm, flat, and the incorrect beer. I ordered a long island - which as someone who has bartended before was offended that it was straight syrup and booze- literally thick. The chicken sandwich hubs ordered had a piece of chicken the size of a mcnugget. The burger I got was raw. RAW. It took an insanely long amount of time to get the manager to come over. The waitress was nice, new--- way too busy for a new waitress. We left without paying -- or eating. Avoid at all costs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2?start=20
Jennifer D.,"Auburn Hills, MI",0,7,1,1.0,6/2/2016,"Worst service ever! We walked in and asked to have a table for a 8 people. The waitresses basically argued over who was going to take us. She sat us and walked away. 20 minutes past and she didn't ask us if we wanted anything to drink. The entire party arrived and then she took a drink order which took forever to receive. All the drinks were basically not good. We ordered shots at one point in the night and there was a black speck of ""something"" in one of them. The place was basically dead, less than 25 people there, and they couldn't handle providing proper service to us. I will never return to this location ever again and it should be shut down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2?start=20
Matt G.,"Huntley, IL",0,5,,1.0,10/19/2016,"Don't do it...you'll be tempted due to lack of options buy please trust me do not make the decision to come here! All I wanted to do was have a beer and a burger while doing some emails, so didn't need much attention.  Well they gave me none.  I sat for 30 minutes  alone before someone approached me. At least I got my emails done.  Staff had no desire to put any effort in at all.  Brutal experience. I saw at least 3 people come into bar and leave because no one served them.  It's bad.   They then messed up my order which was a simple change of side on the dish.....basic stuff.  Also saw the staff talking , texting, and listening to music on their cell phones.  Ugh.  TGI am leaving....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2?start=20

Nikki T.,"Detroit, MI",119,423,231,4.0,9/6/2008,"Normally I wouldn't write about such a large chain but I like this Friday's for a couple of stand out reasons. A few years back this restaurant was terrible. It was nothing more than a hang out spot for a bunch of ignorant people. Now with the renovation, updated decor and a better trained staff, I am now a fan. First reason, it's kid friendly. I was turned on to Friday's a couple years ago while visiting Florida. The staff was so welcoming of my little one I thought I was in Kansas. When I returned to Michigan I thought I would see if that was just a fluke. Nope! The manager at this location even gave my son a tour of the kitchen! Second reason, I really have great servers every time I go. Third, I like the food. Uh, that's usually a good reason to go to a restaurant. I like Friday's! But don't go on Friday night, 45 minute wait!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2?start=80
Cherice J.,"Detroit, MI",35,392,245,4.0,7/19/2008,"I did the unforgivable. I went to Friday's on a Friday night with a date, knowing darn well I would see half of my graduating class. Literally as I walked through the door, I saw person after person that I did NOT want to see. It kind of killed the mood. That being said, Friday's is THE hangout place on the weekend for Detroiters and Southfielders. The bar area is always bustling and crowded. Last night, the service wasn't that great but I honestly don't expect too much from Friday's during these busy times. My waiter tried, he really did, but he managed to mess things up and looked goofy while doing so. Of course the food is always good, so no complaints there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2?start=80
Kerry K.,"Kent, OH",1,4,2,1.0,2/18/2011,"What a joke.. Seriously.  It is real close to the hotel stayed at  for a software class. I ordered a bottle of wine so it  would be fresh.  10 minutes later I get a glass of old wine.  Told her I wanted a full fresh bottle she said ""oh a bottle"", ok, she may not have heard me since the bar was loud as hell and close to where I was seated.  Ten minutes later she asked if I was ready to order.  I told her I thought she was bringing me a bottle of wine.  She said oh I put it in didn't anyone bring it?  (did she see it on the table?).  Five  minutes later she said they didn't have a fresh bottle to sell me.  It was just a basic bottle nothing special.  I finally settled for the old glass she brought me.  I was going to get a nice steak but after that I just had half a Chicken Caesar salad and left.  She never even brought me a glass of water. Do not go here unless you want to kick it at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-southfield-2?start=80
