Maria V.,"Jersey City, NJ",1496,417,2188,3.0,12/31/2017,"I've been here fella few times in the past..... but last month was my 1st time in at least a few years. I happened to meet a friend to grab a drink and appetizer  I got carded getting into the bar. Lol. Guess I'll take it as a compliment since I'm wayyyy over the age I like the set up of the bar area. We were tended to right away- the bartender was nice  I don't expect top notch stuff here. It's American bar food that has way too sodium and calories. I like that the menu tells you the calories to help you keep you in check that you are about to each 500-1500 calories lol We shared bones less wings and spinach dip- which were ok/decent. Nothing to sing about  Evidently it was "" karaoke night"" ---it was a weekday night and not many people there and NOONE was doing karaoke.... the music was WAY too loud that I couldn't even have a conversation with my friend which was the main reason we had come. Once the DJ started playing music - I just could take it. It was that loud!  Would I come back? Maybe ... but hells no to karaoke night for sure lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-2
Mike W.,"Linden, NJ",119,247,644,2.0,12/2/2017,"Well, it's a chain restaurant. Which in itself isn't a bad thing, but unfortunately there not too much here that wows me.  I was a bit disappointed that despite the fact that the menu specifically instructs you to ask about their local craft beer selection, the bartender seemed to have no clue what craft beer was, and they certainly did not have any available.  In terms of food, everything on the menu is about $2 more than it should be for this type of restaurant. I'm not sure if the inflated prices are just because of the area or if Fridays charges them in all their renovated restaurants. I got the shrimp tacos which were in special, but was severely disappointed. Three mini shrimp on each of the two tacos with lettuce and tomato. I would not order again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-2
Uneka H.,"Rahway, NJ",41,181,433,3.0,11/29/2017,"So we came here on a Tuesday night to have girl talk and I have to say -I thought the atmosphere was fine. I didn't know that they had karaoke on Tuesday evening but the music was still enjoyable. Although it was hardly anyone there, we got serviced pretty quickly within a reasonable amount of time.  I ordered the Electric Lemonade which was EXTREMELY watered down and my friend had water. However, I couldn't really complain because it was happy hour and I was not expecting to get seriously drunk off of a happy hour drink. I also had the Spinach & Artichoke dip which was AMAZING and the Mozzarella sticks which were pretty good.  The only other quarrel I had other than the watered down drink (coolade lol) was the music seemed extremely loud! So loud that we pretty much had to yell to even talk to each other. However, they were playing great songs-enough to make you want to dance. So overall it wasn't bad and I will still come back for a bite to eat and/or good music!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-2
Mike P.,"Asheville, NC",30,18,,1.0,12/27/2017,"Ran out of clean silverware after we ate our entrees. In a restaurant only 1/4 full. Dessert was eaten with plastic spoons. I've travelled extensively and have yet to encounter this situation in even the poorest countries. Bathrooms were frightening, both women's and men's. Out of 4 stalls, 3 were unflushed and the 4th had t.p. hanging off the seat into the bowl. There was a dried brown substance above the door handle. Sinks were sopping wet with paper towels overflowing the bin. I realize these are the disgusting habits of customers, but aren't staff supposed to check/clean the bathrooms every so often?  Service was slower than a snail: It took 5 minutes to be seated as the hostess couldn't be found. And later, when she could be found, appeared to be chatting up a guy at the front (who, despite sitting on a stool behind the podium next to the hostess, didn't appear to be staff...)  Similarly we lost our waitress after our entrees were served. After clicking the ""call server"" button on the tabletop tablet and waiting for 15 minutes, we finally got up and walked to the hostess stand to ask for assistance in finding our server. The hostess said she'd find our server but continued to sit there entertaining her friend. Perhaps she used ESP? The food was good, but that's not surprising considering it's shipped pre-cooked to each location and then simply warmed up. And the server was sweet - when she was around. It's not her fault they didn't have clean silverware.      I'm very surprised corporate office allows this to happen. Every other Fridays' I've been to has been above average in service and cleanliness. I'd pick another restaurant if I were you. We will next time for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-2

You basically feel like you showed up at someone's house uninvited. The 1 host that took my name proceeded to write me down as ""dummy"" and when I corrected him he changed it to ""bummy"". Seriously???   There was trash on the floor at the host stand. About 15 minutes into the wait I noticed multiple parties getting sat that had arrived well after me so I went up to check on the status. The host responded, ""oh, the list is going smooth"". Umm ok, but when will I get sat? Umm 10-15 minutes. So I continue to wait. And again I see 5 more parties that came in AFTER me get seated. I go up again to ask what the issue is, and they all seem  to be confused. I look at the list and my name is literally mid-list all the names before it crossed off and about 6 names after it crossed off. What in the actual fuck???? We got a lame apology and a, ""we're seating you now"". Followed the host to a table in the rear of the restaurant. It looked dirty. No silverware and a lovely fruit fly hovering over the salt & pepper shakers. And to top off the lovely experience the server never came to the table at all after us sitting there almost 10 minutes.

She said that she was taking down our driver plate numbers and demanded we need to come pay the rest.

Paul C.,"Rockaway, NJ",26,6,1,1.0,7/27/2014,"If I could rate this place 0 stars, I would. This is not my first time to a Friday's, so the account of my time here is ENTIRELY due to a horrible staff and disgusting practices. I went here with a friend of mine for dinner date. The moment I walked in it was a NIGHTMARE. The hostess told someone to ""Get out her face"" and then proceeded to ignore us walking in the door. Another girl just grabbed a few menus, more than our party of two needed, and sat us directly next to the kitchen and bathrooms. When I asked for different seating, she ignored me entirely and walked away. Our waitress came over after 20 minutes and when I said hello she just looked at me like I had three heads, then asked if we'd like something to drink. I ordered a cherry coke (which I had to explain not only what I meant by cherry, but also grenadine syrup) and my date ordered water, as we were already fearing the worst. After another 20 minutes, she came out with the two drinks, placed them in the wrong locations on the table, then walked away. After yet another 10 minutes she returned and asked us if we wanted to order, something she should have asked when she brought our drinks. My date ordered the 3 appetizers Thai pork tacos, Ahi Tuna Crisps, and the Corn beef and Swiss sliders. I ordered the 6oz Jack Daniel's steak and shrimp with spinach and mac and cheese sides. This all started coming out nearly 40 minutes after placing our order. Starting with the appetizers...they came out one at a time, despite my asking for them to come out at the same time. The Thai pork tacos were DISGUSTING. Unseasoned, no sauce, and the taco shell they were on was soggy, wet, and tasted old. They were so bad I almost threw up after my date insisted I try it. The Ahi Tuna Crisps were only slightly better, with the tuna being cooked unevenly, and had the consistency of rubber. The ""crisps"" they were on was also soggy. The corned beef and Swiss sliders were dry, the swiss tasted almost like cleaning products, and were inedible. My meal was a true tragedy. The plate I was warned is ""very hot,"" but upon touching it, I was shocked to feel it nearly ice cold. Presentation was non existent, as the steak had a half melted pad of butter placed on top, the greens were tossed clearly from one end of the plate to the other making the entire plate covered in water, and the shrimp were sitting, soaking up the water from the greens, making their batter soggy. The mac & cheese came out 20 minutes after I had begun eating. The steak was like a piece of shoe leather, and it was not a Jack Daniel's steak. It was a regular 6 oz sirloin that was not done Medium, as I asked...it was instead so well done, there was nothing left of it. After mentioning this to the waitress, she quickly got then tossed Jack Daniel's sauce onto my table in a little cup and walked away immediately. The shrimp were over cooked and as I mentioned before, soggy. The greens were hardly cooked at all, and were mixed in with onions and mushrooms that come with the regular sirloin. After taking a bite, I tasted something with the consistency of sand in the greens. I was terrified and stopped eating them immediately. The mac & cheese, which was cold by the time it came out, was so god awful. I tasted it and there was NO cheese. It was noodles, which were not fully cooked, topped with bread crumbs. After a miserable night, and after not seeing the manager despite my asking, I payed the bill, regretfully. I will never...ever...EVER in my life return to this place. If you have any common sense, STAY AWAY FROM THIS FRIDAY'S!

Asked for a side of blue cheese with our food, the blue cheese never came. The bartender was too busy talking to a friend across the bar for about 15 minutes, so when we finally got his attention to get the side....our food was already cold. I guess they were aging the blue cheese in the back because it took forever for it to eventually come out. We didn't even get utensils, I had to get up and go to a nearby table and snag some because the bartender never brought them. Overall it was a horrendous experience.

F. T.,"Plainfield, NJ",10,40,91,1.0,10/21/2013,"Went to TGIF on Sunday 10/20/2013 for lunch with my partner and his mom.  Waiter was very nice but seemed a bit flustered.  Our lunches were brought out with an issue on each. 1- My partner ordered the triple stack Reuben and asked for very well done fries (this assures that they are fresh and not coming from under a heat lamp).  The order arrived with soggy, warm fries. The waiter asked him ""are they well done enough for you?"".  After my partner tasted them and responded that they were not hot or crisp, the waiter said that he would bring another order, which arrived the same way the first order arrived. 2- My partners mom ordered the skillet garlic shrimp.  She loved it EXCEPT for the fact that it had 7 large, uncooked cloves of garlic in it. Nothing ruins your taste buds like biting into raw garlic.   3- I ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp.  Just as disgusting as it gets.  The shrimp (with tails on) came in an acidic, bitter tomato sauce.  The grilled chicken (which was on melted yellow American cheese) was so over cooked that the two small pieces were the size of a jumbo egg.  After fighting with two shrimps to remove the tails without making a huge mess, I just gave up.  The waiter came to our table twice, saw that my plate was intact and never asked if there was anything wrong with the meal.  Finally, he came to give us our check and I told him that my dish was just disgusting and I, obviously did not like it.  He said that he would send a manager over.   The manager who came to our table was the a piece to the puzzle as to why the kitchen did not know which end was up.  She made excuses about everything.  I pointed out the large, uncooked  garlic on my partners moms dish.  The manager claims that they make their dish that way and even oven roast their garlic daily.  From where I was sitting, the garlic was raw and never saw the inside of an oven.  As for my dish, she claims that the gentleman who wrote their menu is now a multimillionaire.  I would gather that if that was the case, Fridays over paid tremendously.   Stay away from this place unless you enjoy having smoke blown up your behind from the waitstaff to the management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-2?start=80

Our waitress took 10 minutes just to bring us water. The people eating around us were very loud and kids were kicking the backs of our chair a lot, so we moved ourselves. We got our appetizer first which was good. Then my husband got his food first. Which is odd because usually all restaurants bring all the food together unless you tell them not to. I waited 20 minutes to get my food, thus I couldn't enjoy dinner together with my husband. The waitress actually gave my food to the wrong table that's why it took a long time. When we asked to talk to the manager, he didn't look professional. I complained and said that your waitress has an attitude and all he did was take $2 off the bill. Then finally when we were paying and signing our bill and writing the tip in, the waitress didn't even wait until we left our table to get the check book.

Two of my other coworkers had ordered burgers and there's came out DELICIOUS looking! When they bit into their burgers juices were clearly flowing. I had ordered my medium, and from the pictures...clearly my burger was messed up from the beginning. This burger was SUPPOSED to come out with two parties, mozzarella sticks, marinara sauce, and cheese. And from my pictures you can TELL the first burger they placed in front of me was an insult. I had asked the waiter to bring me mayonnaise thinking this was want the burger was supposed to be. It was the driest burger ever! Two bites in I realize I can't manage to finish this dry burger. It's the equivalent to swallowing sandpaper. He gets the manager and she takes one look at my sandwich and KNOWS her kitchen staff messed up badly. I tell her I just wanna get the brownie dessert and forget about giving me another burger.  Here's where the better part is! She sends me my dessert AND what the BEAUTIFUL new burger that my first burger was supposed to be with a full plate of fries. She tells me that the burger is free and that I can take it home. It looked so much better I couldn't help but to take a bite out of it and it tastes BEYOND BETTER.  Would I come back here...possibly. A strong maybe. I'm sad my main entree wasn't as good as my coworkers at the times they were eating it, but the manager gave me excellent customer service. This is why it's given THREE stars instead of TWO.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-2?start=20
Hollei J.,"Pennsauken Township, NJ",619,331,156,2.0,11/29/2015,"I've been to many different locations. Me and my date stumbled across this one about an hour before closing. Our waiter was less than attentive. I went without a refill on my drink for most of my meal. He never even asked me if I wanted another one, or noticed that my cup was empty. our food took forever, and so did he coming back with our bill.

Mikey A.,"Westfield, NJ",2,2,,1.0,4/15/2017,We were seated in the most empty section in the restaurant where nobody else was. Waited over 15 minutes. No service. We left and went somewhere else. No excuses.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-2?start=20
Maria E.,"Union City, NJ",0,4,,1.0,11/11/2017,"horrible customer service. walked in, hostess didn't even take us to our table. he told us where it was and we sat ourselves. didn't give us menus after minutes waiting we got up and got them ourselves. nobody came to take order for maybe 15 mins. tried to complain to manager and he didn't want to come out, instead he sent the same hostess out with coupons. very upsetting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-2?start=20
Celia P.,"Elizabeth, NJ",38,55,13,2.0,1/19/2017,Medium well is not the same as medium rare!  It's not rocket science. The waitress was ok but zero personality. First and last time I go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-2?start=20
Hector R.,"Elizabeth, NJ",54,2,,1.0,8/5/2017,"We sat down immediately, but waited almost 10 minutes before our waiter greeted us.  We placed our complete order. The Screaming Tiki was all ice. I was done in 6 sips. The food wasn't that great. The French Onion soup had no onions. It was all broth.  The Jack Daniel's Chicken and Shrimp came with no sauce. We had to ask for sauce, ended up leaving half of the food anyway. Usually the manager passes by to ask how was the service, but I guess he or she was busy with everyone else's complaints. I even told that the waitress that we weren't happy with the food, and yet no one passed by. We've come here a few times, and this was the worst experience by far.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-2?start=20
Nosaj N.,"Berkeley Heights, NJ",0,6,,1.0,2/8/2017,Happy hour specials are good deals I guess. We were sat at a table in the bar and the rolled utensils were wrapped in soaking wet napkins that were torn up and disgusting. We asked for new ones and the waitress gave us two new pairs of utensils arguably more soaking wet than the first pair. The chipotle salad I got was made with lettuce that was clearly sitting out at room temperature for hours if not days. Wilted and shriveled like a 90 year olds scrotum. The chicken they put on it is cold and dry. Not dry from being over cooked but looks like the chicken was left in front of a fan all day and formed a jerky like look and texture on the outside. The Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta was a lumpy sauced mess. There was more cartilage than meat on the chicken and maybe two shrimps.

Ash D.,"Union, NJ",41,22,1,1.0,11/19/2016,"I literally only come here out of a matter of convenience at this point. If you are within driving distance of any other Friday's, do yourself a favor and don't even bother coming here. The service sucks. The drinks are watered down. The food is subpar.

Char U.,"Kearny, NJ",4,26,,1.0,1/13/2016,"Worst Friday's I've ever been to, and I've been to some pretty bad Friday's locations. We went on a Saturday at 12, the restaurant was pretty empty but it took about 15 minutes for the waiter to get our drinks. I got a beer that was not poured correctly into the glass and to make matters worse my glass was filthy and had mystery particles in there so I asked the waiter to just get me a glass of water in a clean glass (that glass was also dirty). So, from that point we were spot checking all the silverware to make sure it was clean.  We ordered appetizers and that was another 25 minutes, my appetizer came out warm but my wife's was cold but they tasted fine, like any other Friday's.  Our entrees took another 25-30 minutes and were subpar compared to other Friday's locations.  I requested a medium well burger and it tasted like a hockey puck, my wife got the same thing and hers was undercooked.  Overall, drinks were mediocre, appetizers were ok, entrees were blegh. On top of the bad food the service was terrible, our waitress was only waiting on 4 tables and we were there for almost two and a half hours. I'm usually content going to Friday's because I stick to my favorites but this place somehow managed to completely scree that up. If you're in the area drive the extra 5-10 minutes to get to the one in the Blue Star plaza so you don't waste your money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-2?start=20
Bernie F.,"Hackensack, NJ",28,41,58,1.0,1/26/2015,"Where do i start. This is the worse Friday's I been to in my life (yes my whole life). The food was horrible and the service completely sucks. It took 20 minute to even get acknowledged by the hostess then another 20 more minutes to even get a waitress and a menu. Attitude everywhere OMG, and every time i ask for something they had to ask their manager. The manager is treating them like a CHILD if they cannot make any decision with their managers approval.  I wanted my meal with no cheese and they could not do it and she had to ask her manager, but two days before at the East Hanover Fridays (Best friday's Ever) the waitress gave me my meal with no cheese. The House/Ultimate margarita(Had high hopes) was maybe the worstttt drink i have ever had in my life. Water, with crushed ice and lemmon stuff at the bottom of the glass, literally.  I wish i had something good to say about this fridays but i really dont, even the food was watery and tasteless. Well the shrimp was good at least, cant mess that up.  Stay away YELPERS, dont say i didn't warn you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-2?start=20
Lisa P.,"Kenilworth, NJ",30,120,213,4.0,1/16/2016,This place is ok.  Food is good but I think quality has gone down on some items.  I ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp.  It was good but the chicken could have been a little thinner.  My son had the kids pizza and loved it.  Service was good.  We were seated promptly considering it was a Friday night and they were crowded. Our server took good care of us too.  We'll be back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-2?start=20
Jason R.,"Union, NJ",0,7,,2.0,12/10/2016,The hostess took a little while to get to us. I was with my children. The food looked great but then I tried my ribs and they where hard. I told the hostess when she came back and she just smile and said awwe really and then said do you want more honey mustard for my kids chicken fingers. I'm not one to complain but she could've said do you want me to get you another order or let me get the manager. I actually ended up paying for it even though I didn't touch it. I guess the hostess was new but I call that bad training then cause she did seem very nice but unaware on what to do in that situation. I never really had an issue with this location but this turned me away a little. Also the fact that the hostess had the nerve to ask if we wanted desert without me even touching my ribs was kind of a turn off from this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-2?start=20
Bruce S.,"MONMOUTH JCT, NJ",27,65,,1.0,7/26/2015,"Been to a few different TGI Friday's across NJ and PA areas, this might be the worst one of them all.  We ordered burgers and appetizers... all of which tasted like it was just microwaved.  I think we would have done better at White Castle just across the street.  The waitress that we had seemed to have little motivation in providing any attention to our table.  She seemed more interested in gossiping with her fellow co-workers. The only bright spot, and I mean ONLY...was the young, red-haired lady who sat us down.  She smiled and engaged us in pleasant conversation while walking us to our table.  It really is very sad that the hostess at a restaurant is the only person who seems genuinely interested in providing a positive experience while dining there.  If she reads this...run to another restaurant, you deserve better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-springfield-2?start=20

It seriously was not bad! I had for appetizers wings- Sriracha Buffalo, main dish- chipotle yucatan chicken salad and since it was happy hour I had the ultimate lemonade. I was satisfied and the bar tenders were super nice. The music wasn't super loud for me not to hear the person I was with.
