Nick S.,"Greenpoint, Brooklyn, NY",0,10,,1.0,12/29/2016,"What a dump!! As soon as you walk in you'll smell a terrible stench , the place smells like it hasn't been cleaned in weeks. The food ... terrible. I've eaten in a tgis plenty of times and been satisfied, but this one is a perfect example what happens to restaurant when upper management doesn't care about its establishment anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=20
Joe L.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",0,2,,1.0,10/23/2017,"I saw my friend walking out as i was walking in and he tells me hope you have time cause your going to be a while.  We sat in the bar area and boy was he not lying.  It took them 20 minutes to take our drink order and mind you there were only 4 tables being used.  Our waitress was helping tend bar with the other bartender which I guess somewhat explains it but regardless doesn't really make it any better.  So you can only imagine how long it took to get our dinner order in and get our food.  The shame of it was that the food was actually pretty good, but of coarse I won't tell you that what it took to get another drink.  At one point I had to walk over to the bar to place our reorder.  It seems that this place is really going down hill because my mom and sister went the week before and shared the same complaints that I had.  I sure hope they can fix this problem because the food is pretty decent but there's no way possible that I am willing to keep coming back with such a poorly run establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=20
Chris S.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",0,1,,1.0,5/10/2017,"I usually never had an issue with TGIF but the one time I went with a friend, the service was just absolutely terrible.  First off, we ordered some endless appetizers and the wait was ridiculously long and I felt like as a customer, my friend and I were neglected.  The entrees were alright or below average. Second, we've asked multiple times to turn on the TV to watch some basketball games but it never happened.  What made things worse is that it wasnt even a busy night!!! Attrocious",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=20

Meghan E.,"Emerson Hill, NY",1,6,,1.0,12/5/2016,This place is the absolute worst... every single time we've ordered to go the order has been missing items. The last time we ordered EVERY SINGLE ITEM was messed up or missing something... called and complained they said don't worry next time you order we will take care of the bill so the only reason we went back was to reorder the same thing and hoped for the best... the manager gave us a free app and that was it... definitely will not be returning here!

Ch'n G.,"Staten Island, NY",169,8,5,1.0,12/24/2016,"I've come here many times, they have some good meals. However, good meals are nothing without good service. My wife and I walked in on Thursday evening and it was pretty busy but what happened was unacceptable. We were seated right away and the waitress came by 5 minutes later and asked what we wanted to drink. We told her (2 different types of virgin ice Tea that's made at the bar), at the same time we asked for fried green bean appetizer  about 10 minutes later we got our appetizer, no drinks. And we ordered our entrees. We asked her about the drinks and she said she will check the bar..... 15 minutes after that a different lady came and took our empty appetizer plate, we asked her about the drinks and she said she will also check the bar..... 10 minutes after that we asked our waitress if we could at least get water while we wait for our drinks she said sure! 20 minutes later, no water, no ice tea, no entrees, no waitress to check up on us, no nothing. My wife is pregnant and I was getting infuriated.  I could wait no longer and didn't even want to talk to and manager. I, way too kind-heartedly, left 10 dollars for the green beans, got up and left with my wife. 45 minutes and we didn't even get 2 glasses of water, let alone our ice tea that we ordered 5 minutes after walking in. Fridays, you're gonna lose on alot more customers unless you wake up ASAP! we went to Applebee's in the mall, and I decided to time how long it took them to serve our drinks and food. Water, 3 minutes after asking, drinks, 4 minutes after that, appetizer, 14 minutes from when we walked in, entrees, 15 minutes after our appetizer. Thanks Applebee's, no thanks TGI Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=20
Chantel B.,"Denville, NJ",0,1,,1.0,4/1/2017,"Probably the worst place you can eat at. I had chicken and I'm pretty sure it was pink inside. The appetizer was 30 min late and had a half rotten celery stick with visibly older ones next to it. We also had a buffalo chicken sandwich which was mediocre at best. If they really want to charge 14$ for a plate of chicken with a piece of wood underneath and call it a plank, they need to make sure the food actually looks edible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=20

Rashid B.,"Staten Island, NY",507,573,1413,3.0,8/18/2015,To me TGI-Friday is a place to grab some food.. Similar to fast food just in a restaurant feel.. With table service and good drinks. I was here late night graving some drinks and finish a business contract. The drinks were not up to the standard in coldness. My clients drink was changed twice however do was happy with my tap. My client just took some bottles drinks for the moment. The hostess was too busy I guess cleaning up then paying much attention to the 5 sets of guest around the bar. But it's fine.. I guess it was crazy late & the staff all wanted to go home.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=20

Karen P.,"Point Pleasant, NJ",35,23,1,1.0,10/3/2016,Omg what a disgusting place. Ok so our server was MIA for the whole meal. Every other server got us what we needed. She was definitely impaired. And this is something I notice more often on Staten Island. My granddaughters food was served 20 minutes before ours. I've eaten at other TGIFridays and enjoyed. The food at this location was horrible we couldn't even eat it. We thought the baby was just being picky with hers. We left hungry and disgusted.  We tried to pay but noticed a discrepancy but the waitress never returned. When we finally got someone else to handle we paid and left.  As we passed the bar the waitress was bellied up to it drinking away.

Alice C.,"Manhattan, NY",166,2,,1.0,1/15/2017,"We were seated quickly, as it was not busy in the restaurant. The waiter came by and took our drink order. We waited 10 minutes for drinks and the waiter didn't even come by to ask us what apps we'd like to put in. Finally, he brought the drinks and said ""I'm sorry it took so long I'm gonna scream"".. He told us to remind him to put the dessert order in because ""it takes 2 minutes to make"". The food took another 15 minutes to come out and the spinach dip was burned. The fries came out last and weren't even hot. The waiter was extremely unpleasant and didn't even ask us if we wanted refills. After asking him for water he dropped the straw in the dessert plate and said ""oh you don't mind right?"" And walked away, leaving us with a chocolate covered straw.  After we paid the bill, we were getting ready to leave and he reached across the table to grab the money and counted it in front of us, which was very uncomfortable. Overall, never coming here again. The service is terrible and the food is made with slack.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=20

Leslie T.,"Yucca Valley, CA",80,7,,2.0,3/26/2017,"So my husband and I have been here a couple times and each time it's taken so long to get in and out of this place. I don't think it's the servers I thinks it's mainly that they seem understaffed. The food has been alright but today it was so bad I had to send it back, which I never do.

William Y.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",2,6,,2.0,3/11/2017,"We went here for a Saturday lunch and were seated promptly.  Our waitress was polite and took our orders fairly quickly.  But it took 20 minutes for appetizer and soup to show up.  Plus my entree was missing a side salad, which the waitress blamed the kitchen.  (She was thoughtful enough to bring us the food without waiting for the side salad)  When we asked for the check, the side salad was still nowhere to be seen.  I had to bring this up with the waitress, who responded that she deducted a drink from our bill to compensate.  That's appreciated but would have been better if she communicated that to me beforehand.  Also, it was such a pain to track down the waitress because she was serving customers all over the restaurant.  Thank goodness for the tablets to allow me to pay and get out.  I don't want to imagine how long it would take for them to process my card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=20

Aaron J.,"Staten Island, NY",0,6,,2.0,9/4/2016,Came here for quick last minute dinner it was fairly empty on a Wednesday night. Notice a sign promoting bottles of wine 50% off. Sat at the table and the table was very sticky. Took a little while for the server to come and take out order but I brushed it off. She was polite and gave her input on my options to choose from. We ordered and ordered a bottle of wine. She returned and told us that was the only bottle of wine they couldn't sell because it was too big that would have been a fine excuse if it was noted somewhere which it wasn't. We asked to speak to a manger who came to the table without introducing himself and told us the same thing and that they had to fix the sign  and didn't even seem to try and accommodate us in anyway. I know it isn't a 5 star restaurant but atleast have people skills. Food was good manager wasn't,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=20
Amanda R.,"Manhattan, NY",185,241,74,4.0,10/20/2014,"I am a fan of this food chain but this location is not the worst one there is nor is it the best. There is a nice setup and there is definitely a lot of room so there is rarely ever a ridiculous wait time which is great when you are hungry. The bar area is very big and there are half circle booths for groups that want to catch the happy hour special they have. All drinks and appetizers half off. Great deal.  As far as the food goes it is definitely one of the best locations. My mozzarella sticks are always perfect, never over or under cooked. My meals come out perfect, especially the burgers. I always know I am going to have a good meal when i come here. However, I also keep in mind that the service is far and few in between. You do have to wait for quite some time in order to get something most of the time. They come greet you within a few minutes and I promise you, know what you want early on so you can order it all at once. Kind of sucky, but if not you may wait 10 minutes every time to see your waitress again. Which can be pretty annoying.  I come here all the time. I know what to expect and other than getting better servers I have no complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=20

Precious P.,"New Orleans, LA",77,146,1201,4.0,9/2/2014,This was my first time at this location and I liked my experience. They have a pretty huge bar area and a lot of tables in that section. Than they have a separate section for dining! It's clean and welcoming! They also have seating outside which is cool too! It was too hot so we didn't sit outside!  My co-workers and I went for lunch. It wasn't crazy crowded so we got quick and efficient service! We ordered the crab cakes to start and I wasn't impress. My coworker love it so to each taste buds! I ordered chicken and shrimp pasta that was really good!! I enjoyed my lunch! By the way don't order Virgin frozen drink!! It's just not the same!!

We decided to head to the mall and figured we'd stop in Fridays, our favorite spot. What can go wrong?? It's a chain, should be awesome. WRONG We ordered our usual bacon cheddar bites and the bacon was served to us raw! When I mentioned it to the server his response was ""oh I didn't know you wanted it cooked"" um.... Excuse me??? I ordered the jack Daniels sirloin and shrimp, steak was cooked good.. Shrimp was good.but everything was served cold!!! And to top it off my spinach was raw, wtf!?!  How do you serve raw spinach when its ""sauteed"" Also, I ordered Mac and cheese and was served mash but at this point who wants to wait for another mistake Horrible experience.

Simon W.,"New York, NY",44,93,18,4.0,10/4/2013,"This place is pretty good. However, the service seems to be a bit slow on a week night so not sure if that comes to play. If you sign up for the Stripe Membership program (FREE). You can get unlimited chips & salsa everytime you go. That's $3.99 a plate EACH time. They gave us 3 plates of that. A saving of nearly $12! Also I presented a coupon that I get for a being a member using my cellphone. A received a free entree (i ordered 2 of the same. Steak & Lobster Tail) The dish was really good. Filling as well. The tail was only 4 oz so you need to really savor it and eat it slow because then you will feel like that little tail is then worth it. Steak looks like it was about 8oz. I don't recall. Comes with 2 sides. Not too many selections in this department. Mash potatoes wasn't anything special and the seasoned fries were just pepper and salt.  I want to mention that I usually get medium for my steak, but i think mine was more towards the medium well. Not much red on mine so it made it a little bit dry. My waiter came to us multiple times to see if we need anything and gave us an awkward look each time because I CAN'T HEAR HIM! and I don't need anything each time he asked. However, when it was time for us to get the check. I waited for a good 5 minutes to see him. I figured Nature Call was giving him a ring or something so it's understandable. I tipped at the subtotal before the free entree. When leaving the waiter was standing near the entrance/exit door on his phone. That's why he was not showing up for so long! Apparently Nature wasn't calling him at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=40
Alyssa P.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",0,1,,1.0,2/25/2017,I'll start off the last time we came here was years ago and we had a terrible experience between the waiters and the food and the booths being so small it was overall a bad experience ! Since years went by I figured let's take our nephew out for dinner ! We get in they told us to seat ourselves we did and our waiter lou who was extremely nice took our drink orders and asked if we would like to wait 5 mins till 3 to get half off apps which was nice of him so we waited and he came and took our order! As we waited for the apps for almost a half hour I realized he had been waiting on the whole restaurant the place seem totally under staffed we didn't even get our fork settings until our meal came that was another story our food was cold ! And honestly it wasn't his fault it was the place for being so unorganized and under staffed ! I really felt bad for him! Yet he always checked in on us to make sure we were good ! So I give him 4 stars but this restaurant really stinks ! I won't come back! Again ! I even seen a waitress walking around with potstickers asking every table if it was there's ! Come on!

I had the clam chowder, well that came to me cold, I had to ask them to reheat it, when it came back it was hot but then there was a spice that was used that over powered the taste and it was not a creamy white in color but a dirty cream. Then I had the dragon chicken with rice and broccoli, wrong move! The rice was under cooked it had a crunch to it and the chicken was just as bad.

Mike O.,"Staten Island, NY",10,14,,1.0,5/27/2014,"We went this past Friday which was a holiday Friday so we should have known that service would be poor but we were in the neighborhood and since the Outback had a wait out the door we figured why not. We would soon learn why not  We walk in and despite there being many open tables we were told it would be a 15 minute wait. Odd but not a problem since the bar was empty so we walk over to get a drink at the bar which was very sticky. That was probably caused by the fact that the servers fill the drinks to the top of the glasses but instead of texting in between pouring drinks maybe you should be cleaning up the bar so it is more welcoming to customers and  maybe they stay for a drink or two and give you more money. what a concept! Anyway the drinks were ok, how could you mess up bottles of beer though? After waiting 5 minutes we are called and sat at a table by the bar which is not only filthy but it is crooked and as I put down my drink which was in a glass it spills over the table, no worries though as I am sure our server will be over soon. I am wrong The waitress for our section walked past us 3 times without a word while checking on the two tables to the side of us on each pass through. We had to get the hostess to call the waitress to our attention and when she did the waitress again went to the wrong table! Her service did not get better from there as we barely saw her for the rest of our time. We never got a drink refill and I am sure the only reason why we received the bill is because she was obligated to do so as she probably knew her tip would be less than the cost of a beer down the shore. I guess I should mention the food, It was edible especially if you enjoy salt.  We will not be going back and after speaking to a few people about our experience they have said the same.

Stumbled back; thought I was in the club for a second. Didn't mind the music at all as the DJ was doing his thing. If you want a quiet dinner this is not the place to patronize. The decor of this TGIF's is cool; throwback posters of legendary music artist every where. Big square bar with plenty of seating and flat screens strategically placed around the restaurant so you can't miss the game.   Grabbed a booth and ordered off the 3 for 12.99 menu. Appetizer, Entree and desert. Not a bad deal at all considering most entree by themselves are 9.99 and up.   Got the potato skins, Jack Daniel's Burger and the Brownie Obsession.  Wasn't too impressed with the potato skins but the burger was good. Jack Daniel's sauce has a sweet, tangy taste to it. Cold ice cream and hot brownie fudge mixed together; you'll either love it or get a cavity.

The cheesesburger was supposed to come with white cheddar, cheddar spread, lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, pickles, hickory-smoked bacon, and Fridays sauce. Funny thing is when my plate arrived there wasn't anything I would call cheese. The burger was leaning and there was some kind of greasy, fatty, orange slop pouring out of the burger. I think what the problem was was that there were too many wet things on an already greasy burger. I don't know if Fridays sauce, cheddar, and cheddar spread mend well.  My fries were cold and limp. Nothings more saddening than a cold fry. My brother wound up ordering the same exact burger as mine but had to eat his with a fork and knife. I wont be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island
Jackie S.,"Staten Island, NY",110,148,489,3.0,9/16/2017,"Went here with my brother for the unlimited appetizers. Firstly, the place was empty and I'm always skeptical about that. Also , they now raised the prices from 10$ a head to 13$ for the unlimited apps. Another thing I didn't know was that it was only appetizers from a selected menu- I thought it was all the appetizers they had. You also are only allowed to order one per person at a time and each of them took forever to come. Service was slow despite the fact that no one was in there. Another thing I wasn't happy about was that there was one of those tablets on the table for the games and my brother and I started playing them thinking they were free and when we got the bill they charged it to there. I didn't like that and it's not clear that it will be added to your bill later most restaurants make you swipe your credit card before playing. Anyway the food isn't horrible I don't think you can mess up boneless wings , nachos , mozzarella sticks and whatever other basic food items were on the menu.

The food was actually very good, for pig out food. But what surprised me the most was when I tried the lobster tail (grilled) it was delicious!!!! Couldn't believe I was even in a chain restaurant haven't lobster that actually tasted good, but it's true...it's great!!!

Went here mid week, place was pretty much empty, the food and drinks were very over priced, more so than other chain restaurants. The Drinks really were more over priced than other places. The unlimited apps, isn't as good a deal as it sounds. $12.99 for select apps, that come with unlimited free additional orders... the problem with this, is if you order 1 of these apps, they give you very small portions, so you basically have to have 3 orders of it just to really equal 1. The food itself also wasn't that good. Low quality food, more expensive than other places, and an unlimited apps special that really isn't what it seems.

James S.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",53,20,66,3.0,9/17/2017,So me and my sister were shopping at the mall and we were a bit hungry after we left. We were not so sure what we wanted to eat. But then we saw TGI Fridays and we would like oh what the hell why don't we just eat there we haven't ate there in a while. And literally haven't ate there in over eight years. The place was not busy at all. Maybe like only 10 parties in the entire Friday's. It's got a cool and attractive decor inside with all the wall decals and lights. We sat down and checked out the menu and decided on just doing the unlimited appetizers for lunch. The waiter took a bit long to come over and take our drink order. Then finally came over with the drinks of waiting another 10 mins. We told the waiter we wanted every appetizer and she said you can't do that. One appetizer per person. We were a bit confused we wanted all the appetizers in front of our face. But instead we had to eat 2 tiny portions of appetizers and wait for the waiter to Come back over and put 2 more orders in. We wasted a lot of time doing that. Especially how small the portions were. They even raised there prices from 10$ to 13$ To be completely honest the only 2 best appetizers were the buffalo wings and loaded potato skins. The meatballs tasted almost frozen! The bbq chicken flatbread was gross looking! It didn't even look edible. We didn't even touch it. They even did something pretty messed up. They had that tablet on the table where you can play games while you wait for the food. So we started playing it and we thought it was free because it didn't ask us to pay.

Both times my family was seated in a small round corner table with barely any room on the table. The first Saturday we came here, 3/5 of us ordered the endless apps. They didn't have the nachos on that day. It wasn't busy so they allowed us to order 2 apps at a time each time. The wait for them was some time. The second Saturday we came here, it was only 4 of us. 2/4 of us ordered the endless apps because they weren't too bad the first time around. This time the meatballs came out ice cold and extra rubbery. The chicken and the mozzarella sticks seams to be the only things you can never go wrong with at this place. I had also order d French onion soup here and they put 2 pieces of burnt bread and barely any onions and hardly any cheese. Major disappointment. Also it was lukewarm. Wasn't even worth sending back because our waitress was as slow as molasses. She hardly ever came back to check on us. The food also took over an hour to come out. Apps should never take that long since everyone knows there already pre cooked. I also got the potato skins cause you can't mess that up either, but they did. They were dried out and had very little cheese on it. The place wasn't even that crowded. And the fact that we had to wait sooo long for the good was ridiculous.

Kiara C.,"Staten Island, NY",16,18,5,5.0,3/15/2014,My boyfriend and I had an amazing time here. Both times we came here the staff was outstanding. Our appetizer was late and our server felt so bad she spoke to her manager and they made it free. I love this place and I will continue to come here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=60

Paulie B.,"Oakwood, Staten Island, NY",10,44,53,2.0,1/2/2014,"I'm a Big Fan of Potato Skins, but no fan of them here!!!!!! They called them loaded potato skins three pieces of bacon bits and a little shredded cheese? Thats loaded ? No taste; they were horrible!  The service was great, and the burger was decent.......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=60

Angela R.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,133,881,2.0,7/5/2013,"I would have given a one star if we didn't get an appetizer. We got the 2 for 15.99 with the steak tacos and the spinach dip. The spinach dip was great. The tacos which I substituted for chicken were HORRIBLE. The taco shells smelled like my cats litter box (no joke). The lettuce was AWFUL with really spicy dressing. The chicken was reasonable. Then we got the 2 for 12 with the wedge salad and the bruschetta chicken pasta. The wedge salad was okay (but what can you do to salad!) The only complaint I had was that there was raw bacon on top. The bruschetta chicken pasta we a still deciding if we liked it or not. It tasted like balsamic vinegar and marinara sauce. The chicken was okay though. Then we got the Parmesan encrusted chicken. The ""tomato salad"" was a few small pieces of tomato with about 4 mozzarella balls. There were about 5 tortellini with it and the chicken was very small. We also got the garlic breadsticks which were very good. The service was okay and the resturant was clean, but we are still hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=60
Alejandro A.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,6,8,4.0,8/29/2013,The food here is decent. The waiter was super nice and attentive that's why I gave it a fourth star. Place is decent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=60
Marlene G.,"New York, NY",0,5,3,5.0,9/1/2013,Staff very friendly and attentive. Waiter was great at introducing us to stripes member although i was already one. Happy hour mango berry margaritas hit the spot. Food was amazing. Sizzling chicken and shrimp..mmm my fave!! Brownie obsession- words cannot describe!! Waiter was a little overwhelmed by other tables. Sign up for stripes membership- def worth it.  I'll def go back for happy hour!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=60
Navin A.,"New York, NY",227,12,18,1.0,5/30/2011,There was a shrimp tail on the table when we sat down. Food was over cooked. Drink was watered down. Waitress was great. Kitchen and bar needs a lot of work,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=60
Lori J.,"Staten Island, NY",0,29,,3.0,11/13/2011,No matter if its in nj or ny it's always consistently edible.  Nothing to write home about bit it won't make you sick.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=60
Selena K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,,1.0,10/4/2015,Yelp needs to have an option for no stars at all because that's what this restaurant deserves. The only appetizing part of my meal was the fountain soda. To start off the edge of the potato skin was burnt. The cocktail for the shrimp was watery. Thankfully there was no hair on it like the last time I came to this tgif Friday's. With the appetizers being unsatisfactory I was looking forward to the main meal. That was even more of a disappointment. My boyfriend ordered rib-eye and lobster tail. The presentation of his meal was very good. However the presentation of my meal looked like something you would serve to a dog. I ordered the rice with salmon and lobster. The rice was disheveled and it looked as though someone ate from it before it was served to me. I brought it up to an employee who sent over the manager. The manager came right away and I addressed the situation to him. He apologized and told me he's going back in the kitchen to get me a new order. It took about 10-15 minutes to get my new order and it finally looked presentable. The taste of the food however was not spot on. The rice was okay and the salmon was too burnt. This will be my last visit to this establishment. Nothing about this place is worth the visit or the money.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=60
Jimmy S.,"Staten Island, NY",177,242,26,3.0,11/26/2011,"I always disliked These chain restaurants because they are known for so/so food and bad service,  but TGI Fridays menu, food, and staff has improved! There are quite a few things in here that I like and they have great deals running all week long! Try it before you bash it that's all I'm saying!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=60
Javier R.,"Elm Park, Staten Island, NY",34,16,1,1.0,10/25/2012,"Only positive aspect of this location is the waiters. The manager ""Bob"" is beyond rude and doesn't understand the concept of customer satisfaction. All I wanted was to watch a Yankee game while at a bar table. He denied several requests from various customers to change it. He even went so far as to yell at his staff in front of customers for attempting to change the channel. Will NEVER return until he is fired!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=60
Rob M.,"Jackson Heights, NY",1,14,,4.0,2/24/2013,I come to this TGIF restaurant quite a bit.  The waitering staff is always friendly and responsive.  I especially like the bar area with the large screen TVs.   I came here Saturday afternoon for lunch with my mother.   The food was good.  We had the shrimp cocktail for an appetizer.  I had a grilled chicken salad while my mother had baby back ribs with a side order of cole slaw.  I wasn't expecting much from the salad but was pleasantly surprised.   The chicken was cook perfectly and the salad was fresh.  My mother's baby back ribs were delicious as was the cole slaw.  The decor is typcial TGIF. I recommend going on Sunday's when appetizers and drinks are half priced.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-staten-island?start=60
