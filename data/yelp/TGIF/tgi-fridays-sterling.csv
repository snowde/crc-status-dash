glori b.,"Orlando, FL",45,83,5,4.0,4/23/2009,"Tgi Fridays ranks very high on my list of affordable above fast food quality restaraunt without big price tags.I love this location and its packed on Fri Sat nights with the young crowd of kids ,smoking, drinking,and waiting for a movie or juist hanging out listening to jukebox, getting some bar foods, etc..The concept is great.The stripes card is a welcome change actually pays you to eat 8.oo for every 100.oo you spend back in coupons unlike alot of restaraunts which dont care if you come back or think its a good deal.This location is acorss from movies and you can get 5.00 off with a ticket stub. .Where else can you buy a 4 .oo cosmo , and get appetizer for a penny.If you like bar food you can eat here and be in heaven and leave full and with money in pockets.Some good things are spinach dip , hot wings, pecan chicken strips,and all their appetizers are tasty.The Jack Daniels sauce is simply divine and kicks up anything.I like the bruschetta pasta its quite tasty.The salads are good, the burgers are good and the chicken is pretty good.I will say one problem I had the only problem I ever had was I ordered lunch chicken and shrimp and mash potatoes and it was  described as cheesy etc. When I got home it was a Kraft cheese single on top of a scoop of mashed potatoes.I was sincerely hoping managment  had to use it as emergency and ran out of real cheese,I know there food is frozen and a chain but fresh cheese is considered standard.I have eaten here for lunch, appetizers and dinner often .Probably about 100 times in 6 months so the cheese really pissed me off as I have never experienced this before but its my ONLY  complaint.The bartenders are fun, busy and efficient.The servers in the non bar area are very caring and will do anything to help you.The Manager ,with curly hair,is the most pleasant friendly person  likes her job staff member who is on site and on the money when it comes to running a fun bar environment.Shes very friendly and always says hello. They almost always print free appetizer survery with my meal.Appetizers are half off in the bar area from 5-9 and I believe at the bar til 2 am.Yes 2 am latest hours of food service I know.Big props for  having a fun bar like atmosphere with cheap drinks and a jukebox as well as munchies.Best deal for a quick fun light bar atmosphere or even a casual family meal.I have brought my kids and ate at the bar area a few times I recommend the non bar as it tends to be smoky,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sterling

Amanda K.,"Austin, TX",902,1369,1441,3.0,3/30/2010,"My husband and I ate lunch here on Saturday around noonish and it wasn't busy at all. Our waitress was a little bit on the slower side when I asked a few questions about if my husband and I could split the 3 course meal deal that is currently being promoted. A tip for this place is to sign up for their club card before you come here. They will email you a temp card which will give you some yummy deep fried chip appetizer. My husband ordered his usual, the Jack Daniel's burger and I ordered the Dragon Fire chicken off the right portion right price menu. His meal was very delicious he said and mine was okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sterling
Rebecca J.,"VA, VA",23,31,,2.0,2/18/2007,"ICK!  I have been going to this Friday's since it opened and I was pretty disgusted the other night when my friend's beer came with a lipstick mark on it!  Unacceptable!  After we showed the waiter, he apologized and brought her a new one.  I think when something like that happens, they should bring you a free beer, and you shouldn't have to ask?!   Overall, this is just a typical Friday's and I guess you can't really expect too much, the tables are usually not really wiped down too well, they have high turnover with their waitstaff, and their food is so/so.   Now that I've been grossed out with the lipstick mark I don't know if I can continue to dine here, which is reflected in my two star rating!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sterling
Brandon H.,"Sterling, VA",3,6,1,2.0,10/2/2009,"This Fridays always seems to come up short in some area every time we eat there. The food is usually good, which is nice since that is the primary reason we go there. This time I got a shock when the bill came with a $4.50 Miller Light draft charge! Seriously? You can almost buy a 6 pack for that. I found out if you sit in the bar, that price point drops to $2. Weird. I guess there is a $2.50 delivery fee from the bartender. Tip for the wait staff -- check the silverware BEFORE you roll it. My knife had steak sauce and a hunk of something on it still. Thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sterling
Sorina T.,"Falls Church, VA",3,19,,1.0,12/28/2008,"I love TGI Fridays, but this one was the worst one that I have ever been to. Their service was horrible! I remember when I went with a couple of my friends, we were seated but never given menu's and I had to go ask for them, and also, our server wasn't so pleasant. I don't exactly remember his name, but he is also a bar tender as well. We waited there for about an hour just to order food, he never checked up on us because we needed sauces and all. It was pretty bad service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sterling
Gem S.,"Colorado Springs, CO",97,116,36,5.0,9/9/2008,WOW...I'm surprised that I'm only the 2nd reviewer for this place.....I thought there'd be at least 10 pages I'd have to read through. This place is ALWAYS booming!  I always sit at the bar with friends or family...they make really good drinks.  Price is really good. Great place to hang out on Friday and Saturday nights.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sterling
Ross A.,"Sterling, VA",30,51,,3.0,2/14/2009,"it's Fridays...  Nothing fantastic, or out of this world.   I've experienced better.  It's close, and I go there to get out. my main gripe about this place is the people you find there. Your average chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sterling
Judith L.,"Atlanta, GA",203,470,84,2.0,9/18/2008,"This Fridays has the same food you'll find at any other (you know, being a chain and all...) It's fun to sit at a bar when there's a good crowd and you've got a few pals to drink and hang out with. Sitting at the tables is less thrilling. Whenever I've been there, there has been no one at the host desk. Literally no one. You stand there and feel awkward and shuffle your feet, pretend to be amazed by something over in the corner, put your phone to your ear and pretend you're doing something important... until FINALLY someone shows up to seat you. Awk-ward. Super awkward... The time you'll have when you get seated is hit or miss- you're waiter could be totally energetic and engaging, or you could be stuck with the disappearing waiter- who magically re-appears only when you're done with your meal and need your check. I've been to better locations- but food is food. If you're hungry and willing to put up with some lackluster customer service, go ahead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sterling
