Andreas F.,"Stockholm, Sweden",27,379,87,4.0,2/8/2016,"A pretty casual, always busy restaurant/bar just a few steps from Stureplan. This is the place that you could go for just a drink or a whole meal. Atmosphere is whatever mood you are in, and since they have a lot of tables, you could most probably get a table after a few, even though you havent made a reservation in advance. They launched a new menu during last year and i think its pretty solid. They have a lot of dishes in a wide range of different cuisines. This is probably the closest you could get to an American diner in Stockholm. Service is fast and they keep it simple. You could get a meal for around 200 SEK which is a pretty good value for the quality. Go here with a few friends to have an unfancy dinner, if you like, you can even add some beverages without getting broke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm-2
Dennis H.,"Södermalm, Stockholm, Sweden",12,3,1,1.0,10/4/2017,"Place was empty, (3pm) maybe 2 Tables occupied. We've waited almost 20 min and left cause nobody seemed interested to take our order. Worst service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm-2
Christoffer F.,"Stockholm, Sweden",44,94,100,4.0,1/26/2016,"First time eating a this TGIF, this one can room plenty officeworkers or just anyone who wants to blow of some steam! We got seated on the third floor overlooking the whole restaurant(great spot).  I order the ribs and man was I suprised! They were tender and not to sweet, with epic Jack Daniels sauce on the side!  I have to give credd to the amazing service here, they were quick, funny and made you feel seen and definitely made the experience 100% better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm-2
Patricia C.,"Stockholm, Sweden",2,34,1,1.0,6/17/2015,"I just placed my order and am excited about eating great American food! Yay! It's a great restaurant for people who want to be disappointed!!!! The soda is great and one of the only places in Sweden with free refills. I was expecting this place to have coca cola but they only have Pepsi, which I actually think is better then coca cola!  So far we have ha four different girls helping us but the service is great and everything is fast and good. I love Fridays and it's only a Wednesday!!! So after we got the food I was actually very disappointed. The pasta was undercooked and they forgot ingredients that were on the menu. The garlic bread was just bread with butter on it. And we ordered two different type of shrimp but it turns out TGIF just really love mess things up because both shrimp were the same... Very disappoint. After we got the food nobody checked on us to see how things were going and I never got my drink refilled. My date was so mad that it ruined our evening and we did not kiss at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm-2
Phil Q.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,13,4,1.0,5/12/2016,"Been to TGI Friday in Greece (Athens) and i loved it. Here in Stockholm its just awful: service slow, waiter doesnt care about us  really. Didnt even ask if everything is fine and if we need anything else. Now im trying to get his attention to pay but seems impossible so im writing this review instead.  Food is avg, rather give that (overpriced!) money for something better at some other place.  Beer tastes like water. Pepsi that friend had also. Just awful experience. Not coming back! Ah yes, portions small and pricey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm-2
Louise C.,"Stockholms län, Sweden",71,146,326,2.0,4/16/2016,"I probably should stop visiting TGIF because each time I go here I hate myself afterwards. The food is overpriced, overcooked and stodgy. The drinks are incredibly sweet and watered down. The service is overkill, having dozens of waiters buzzing around but somehow still getting incredibly bad service. My service today included the following: when we asked for water, we were brought one glass between the 2 of us. When are cutlery arrived, I got a knife but no fork, when I asked for both. My fork came but still no water. We asked for our bill 3 times, waiting a good 20 minutes before receiving it and then another 5 minutes before they came back with a card machine. I'd understand if they were really busy but there was at least 6 hovering around very close to our table. Please avoid TGIFs if at all possible as I promise you there will always be somewhere better close by.  So why 2 stars u say?  Well the decor is nice, they have a very tasty pulled pork slider burger starter(do not be fooled by the sharing suggestion on this starter, it's two small slider burgers, I could have eaten 3 myself!!) and my cocktail was large enough to fill 3 glasses(tropical punch mojito).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm-2
Martin I.,"Stockholm, Sweden",28,43,34,2.0,5/30/2015,"Extremely mediocre, borderline bad. The wait time here is insane for both the food and for them to take your order, and it wasn't even rush hour and it's been like that every time I've been here.  I decided to try some new things on their menu, namely the French Dip, and it was insanely disappointing. Stale bread, hard cheese, and overall mediocre.  Very pricey for the quality and you can get so much better tasting food for a lot less in many places. It's very clear they are just riding off the franchise name from the U.S., with no intentions of quality or service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm-2
Peter E.,"Stockholm, Sweden",11,81,30,3.0,12/15/2014,"This is a ok lunch place if you are 5-8 and need a larger table for lunch and havent got a booking.  You know what you get if you take the burgers, they are ok and for me personally I really like the fries.   However  They have a super complex and hard to understand stucture for waiting staff. One person gives you menu, other takes drink order, third takes food order, fourth give you the food and fifth person gives you check. So if you are in a hurry, ask for check when you order the food.  Stay away from anything else than burgers or ribs, everything else I have tried is boooooooring and some of damn near impossible to eat. Example:  Pasta with chicken absolutely drowned in vinegar, had to send it back.  Pasta with tex mex.... covered in nachos.. why? I don't want razor sharp chips in my pasta.  For evening, ultimate mudslide is excellent!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm-2
Kindra H.,"Stockholm, Sweden",197,31,15,3.0,7/4/2014,"As an American in sweden I have high expectations for an American restaurant. It's quite different than an American TGI Fridays.  They were so slow seating us, waited like 10 minutes before anyone even noticed us standing there, and then it took forever to order and there are only like 5 other people here. Food is decent and the fries are tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm-2
Holly M.,"Stockholm, Sweden",99,128,69,1.0,11/18/2012,"Ehhhh-  I had high hopes, but it just didn't deliver on any level.  After being sat for about 10 mintues we flagged down a server who said they couldn't help us because its not their table, but our server should be there soon...about 10 more minutes later our server finally showed up.  The food took forever and when it finally came we had no silverware and our server said they would bring it right over- that never happened.. we had to ask 2 other people for it before we finally got forks and knives (no napkins). Meanwhile our food is getting cold.  The food was not good. Would be surprised if it was microwaved. The appetizers were the worst, the burgers were okay and the milkshakes were the best (of the worst). It's extremely over priced for what it is.  I think there's plenty better American restaurants in Stockholm. The only time I will go here again is in desperation, late night, intoxicated. The one thing they do have going for them are the late open hours",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm-2
Brenda S.,"Portland, OR",29,7,,5.0,9/5/2012,"So normally I would not go to a chain restaurant in the states or especially in another country where I could have a new unique experience, sounds snobby but I'm really not... See pub food Portland Oregon, I go to most of those!  ... However making an exception here.  Want a glass of wine for half of what other places charge, this is it, and also why so many locals are here,FYI other cheaper wine near by is Frippe by drama theatre.  Five stars for pricing, other than that it is what is is!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-stockholm-2
