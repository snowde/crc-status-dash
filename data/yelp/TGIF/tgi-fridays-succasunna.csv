Cory T.,"Rockaway, NJ",8,96,96,4.0,9/8/2015,"I like this TGIF. It's pretty consistent in terms of service and quality. I tried some new apps they added to the menu. They're either hit or miss, the JD sliders were really tasty. They left me wanting more, and that's what an appetizer should be. I'd definitely visit this Friday's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-succasunna
Mary P.,"Cedar Knolls, NJ",0,8,3,2.0,6/7/2016,"Originally we stopped at Cracker Barrel. But the wait was more than a half an hour. Went to TGI Friday's, walked right in and sat down. That should've been an indicator. Service was good. The food was terrible. I don't know what happened to TGI Friday's... The food is sub standard. Just poor quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-succasunna
T H.,"Wharton, NJ",1,9,,1.0,2/27/2016,"If this was the first time ever trying a Friday's id never go back. Visited for lunch around 2:30pm and had to wait 10 minutes even though there were open tables in the Bar and the other dining rooms. Hostess claimed that the high tops were all part of the wait yet at other locations high tops are first come first serve. When we finally were seated we walked past about 10 dirty tables. I guess the busboy called out on this day. We waited 15 minutes for our server to greet us, and another 15 for our drinks to arrive. When we realized how long it was taking for the drinks we saw our server stocking glasses at the service station. Food was extremely slow to come out. 13 minutes for soups? Burgers ordered medium overcooked to well done and cold. Meat overly salted. Burger bun was not fresh. Maybe a half teaspoon of bacon onion jam on one burger. ""Peppered bacon"" forgotten on another burger and when the waiter finally brought it out it was just regular bacon. Cold and chewy. What was supposed to be a quick lunch during non busy hours turned into a 2 hour aggravating and frustrating $60 + visit. Will not go back to this location. Ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-succasunna
