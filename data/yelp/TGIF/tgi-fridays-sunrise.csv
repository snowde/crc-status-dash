Rich G.,"Boynton Beach, FL",187,113,,5.0,11/10/2014,My girlfriend and I went to this restaurant for a double date with our good friends from college. We had the pleasure of being served by Joe c. I don't say this very often at all but I can say he was the absolute best waiter I have ever had going to any restaurant not necessarily a Fridays. We all went there to have drinks and do the unlimited appetizer specials. He was constantly checking on our table to see if we wanted any more appetizers or drinks and when we did he got them to us so quickly it was so impressive. Not only was he tentative and quick but he was also extremely polite and accommodating. He has great customer service skills and for that I even told him that he was the best waiter I have ever had going to a restaurant period. So if we all go back there again I want him to wait our table and I don't care if we have to wait a couple extra minutes just to have him seat and serve us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sunrise?start=60

Amanda A.,"Tallahassee, FL",79,13,1,1.0,7/13/2014,"We went in today for dinner and have some of the unlimited appetizers. We get seated relatively fast. The young girl asked us if we wanted a booth in the bar. We didn't think it would be a problem. However, they had the news BLASTING on like 50. Super loud blasting!!!! We were starving so decided to stay. The waitress took about 20 minutes to get to the table. She was so bad that the table next to is had to go up to the bar and get refills and a pen for their check. I asked my boyfriend if we get served in the bar or if we had to go up to the bar for service. He was confused as well. The bartenders noticed us sitting there and looking around, but didn't say anything. We couldn't be patient so we just left...

David W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",157,175,352,4.0,5/23/2012,"Happy uplifting atmosphere, good food, and great drinks. Been coming to Fridays restaurants since before I could legally drink. Even though the chain has changed a little over the years the food, service and drinks have maintained their high standards. All the dishes are good from salads to steaks and the appetizers are the same with some interesting twists. Deep fried string beans, who would have thought they would be so good. You can't go wrong with any desert choice, all delicious. Now the one main thing I have ordered since before I could legally drink. The L.I.T Top-shelf. That's Long Island Icetea Top-Shelf. Don't think they call it that anymore but if you ask for it they still bring it. Mmmm Good. Great place for a good time and to help forget the stress of the day.

Sierra B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",114,2,6,2.0,5/27/2016,"I was struggling on whether not to rate a one instead of a two. I was also leaning towards a 0. As soon as my friends and I entered Friday's, the host brought us past many empty booths. After passing what may have been about ten booths we finally arrived at a hard five top table. Mind you, we are three people. Three. Not five. Not even four. Three. That's not the only horrible part. (Oh it gets worse) This table was right next to a table of 20-25. A loud party of 20-25. It was right next to a drink station where the serves would go to get drinks for the ENTIRE restaurant. Not only that, this table was right next to.. THE RESTROOMS. Why in a room full of such few people, they would sit us there? I'm still trying to figure out the answer.  Now, Alberto was our server. He was very nice after taking our order and getting our drinks. However, once he came back to bring us some lemons, he passed gas. Right next to my face. Did he apologize? This young man didn't even acknowledge what he did to us. On top of that, ten minutes went by.. Then 15... Then 20... And there was still no sight of our food or Alberto. Alberto finally comes back after a half an hour later. No food in his hands. ""I'm sorry, there's been a situation with the chicken. It'll be out soon, okay?"" Okay Alberto. What choice do I have? His manager came back with a small plate of chips and salsa. How sweet. She must have known we were hungry. The chips were gone before they even got there. Our food came out and it was pretty good. However, my friend could tell her food was sitting under the heating light for a bit too long. After waiting for that food for ages, it was so disappointing for her to wait for something that was not up to par. No one should have to experience this anywhere. Especially at an EMPTY restaurant. I hope Alberto and the rest of the Friday's staff can get their act together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sunrise?start=40

My husband and I were in the mood for a suculent dessert, but we couldnt find any cupcake/bakery shop open in our area on Sunday afternoon. So we endedp up at TGI Fridays.. My husband ordered the brownie a la mode, and I had the salted caramel cake. What a disappointment. My cake was the size of 3 quaters. No joke! And I probably had about 2 tablespoons of ice cream to go with it. My husbands brownie was not as small, but he probably had about half a teaspoon of vanilla ice cream. We called the waiter and asked him for more ice cream, and he was nice enough to bring us a cup of ice cream and apologized. The waiter is the ONE star this place gets, everything else deserves -10 stars. My salty caramel cake tasted old and stale. My hubby's brownie wasnt as awful, but it wasnt good enough to make up for the disaster that was my dessert.

Our food finally came out 25 mins later and the potato skins were over cooked.  Pretzels were very greasy.  We didn't get the beer cheese dipping sauce for the pretzels, so I had to request it.   Didn't have time to send it back for recooking.  What really bothered me was other customers that sat at the bar much later than us, received their food a few minutes after us.

The waiter was THE RUDEST person I've ever had the displeasure of meeting. We were celebrating my mother 59th birthday, since the second the waiter approached our table she has a mean look in her face. My mom asked her to take a picture and she took the phone frowning. Then we were one menu short and asked her if she could please bring one and she stored off with an attitude. We were celebrating a birthday and decided she was probably having a bad day and we wouldn't stress it. Then My 32 year brother asked for a beer and she ID him with an attitude, then I ordered a drink for my mom and she demanded an ID from my mom as well (she's 59!!!). At this point we were all annoyed already because her attitude was just almost unbearable and I didn't want to deal with her attitude so I didn't order an alcoholic drink, but changed my mind when she returned. She immediately stopped me and said she was not going to serve me and she had already informed the manager about our table because I had a fake ID. Mind you I'm 24 and I had NOT even shown her my ID once. We asked to speak with the manager and he was almost as terrible as her. He did nothing except tell us if we wanted to leave we didn't have to pay for what we had ordered, which was nothing but 2 alcoholic drinks and a lemonade. He didn't apologize for her behavior, offer to have another waiter help us. Nothing. We were embarrassed and extremely upset! We've never experienced such terrible customer service before.

There is a level of apathy that is tolerated by management and that is why the store is rated so poorly. The bar is a key cog in the wheel but in this store there is such a laissez faire attitude. Time is not of the essence. The bartenders are present but far from that state. They are not responsive to their servers and slow down service. The manager is visible but he isn't managing. Things need to change and soon. Get it together because you have potential.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sunrise?start=20
Robert W.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",76,46,4,2.0,7/27/2017,We have decided to write TGI Fridays off our list with good reason.Its always the same thing lack of or non existent service. We had  been seated in a corner and 2 of the tables next to us were a mess not just for a moment but for almost 30 minutes after we had to stare them. We finally got to order our Apps that they now advertise at unlimited apps @10.00 per person.. The first set came out quick as had our drinks but they messed our app order up..No biggie they made up for it. After those were done we wanted more and also refills on our beverages but didn't see anybody for almost minutes. We had asked for a manager and THEN the waitress came asking if we wanted refills etc.  By then we lost our appetite Thankfully the manager finally came over. After we explained the situation he cancelled our bill for the apps and our beverages. He gave us a card for a future visit that we might not use. Mind you the place was not busy as most of the tables were empty. This is also not the first time this has happened at a Fridays..    .   .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sunrise?start=20
Mike S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",0,3,,2.0,12/26/2016,"Only because in was Christmas night and nothing else was open except Dennys and I hop, we decided to goto Fridays.

Avi A.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,6,4,1.0,9/25/2016,"Very bad service . We walk in and there was no menu when the place only half full. We sat down, got our drinks on time, then we ordered our food. Then we got our appetizer but could not eat it because there was no silverware. When we asked why there was no silverware the server  said that they were too busy. By the time we got the silverware the app was cold. We waited for our main course for about 40 mins and we only got one meal out of three. The food was great as usual, but service was terrible. The restaurant manager does not even care. Will not go back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sunrise?start=20
Stephanie R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",34,33,8,1.0,6/24/2016,This location has really gone down hill. Friday's isn't keeping up with the other chains in this category. The food isn't good anymore.

Mike O.,"Dayton, NV",3,30,1,1.0,7/30/2015,"If there was a way to give ZERO stars This TGI Fridays earned it! Stopped by here at 9pm on a Thursday after visiting the mall to pick up some new Adidas. Wife and I were pretty hungry and have visited other TGI's in the past.  Upon entering it was pretty busy, but no hostess. She appeared in about a minute and we asked for a booth as several were available however needed cleaned off. She did say we'd probably get faster service at the bar but when we declined she darted over and promptly started clearing off a table when another happy TGI'er employee came over and asked us if we needed help.  I said ""nope"" and pointed in the direction of the young lady wiping down the table. This is when this happy go lucky guy informed us that we would have to wait to be seated for ""ugh like five minutes because we're letting our servers catch up"". Apparently he was instructed by his manager to not seat anyone? Wtf? The booth is clean, it's within reach, we're not picky people, we just want to sit down. The manager came over and notified us that it would be a ten to fifteen minute wait - to seat us.  What a joke, don't visit this establishment. Go get a taco or a sub, hell go to the hockey bar (JP Mulligans) off Flamingo Road, we did! Great service and food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sunrise?start=20
Katrina R.,"Vinings, Atlanta, GA",61,93,285,3.0,9/5/2015,I don't frequent this joint often because I like food with flavor. I ordered a simple BLT with avocado. My order delivered; but I received a total of eight and french fries. I guess I should've said I wanted to at least have 20 to 30 Fries...  I was in a bit of a rush with the rest of my colleagues and the waitress was moving at a snails pace.

Kara M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",272,648,3116,3.0,7/28/2017,"I grew up enjoying visits to TGIF back in New York, but at some point I lost interest in this chain. I've been to this establishment twice now and neither experience was great.  I was here back in the late fall and again this month. The service was one of the biggest issues and food taking a long while to come out.  By the way, I usually rarely ever dine out at peak times. My mom and I stopped in here for a late lunch (3 or 4 PM) about two weeks ago, it took about 10-12 minutes to even place our drink orders.  The food was very slow coming out too.  It took quite sometime to get the check.  The issues were quite similar when I visited last fall too.  I am not health food obsessed, but this cuisine here tastes like fast food to me.  I think they put too much salt in the food and some of it is too greasy.  I did have the dessert here, it was a brownie sundae sized for one and that was good. I will probably try to avoid this particular location in the future, but then again this isn't one of my favorite restaurants these days.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sunrise

The food we ordered wasn't great, had better in other restaurants in our area.  I can tell you it's been over decade that I have walked into Friday's, and it will be another decade. When I used to go Friday's they were great, they Brunch on Sundays, calendar they sold for the year with free deserts, appetizers has each month passed.  I guess those days are gone, I remember they had points system when you ate, and wouldn't you know it when I hit 90,000 points, they ended it.  They were nice enough to use it on food, instead of items. Well like I said there is others place it spend money. The one thing I remember the most about Friday, it's loud inside, and that hasn't changed.   I can see what the elder don't like about them wearing hearing aids that blast noise in your ear.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sunrise

Ever since they redid this location, I enjoy coming here. The staff are pretty friendly, and service is not too bad. My boyfriend and I decided to go to the bar and sit. I'm glad we chose to do that, because service was great. The bartender understood we were trying to have a quick bite before the game. We shared a couple appetizers since we weren't too hungry. Best decision in getting boneless chicken wings and their spinach flatbread off their happy hour menu. They were good enough portions shared to fill us up, along with the drinks we had. I tried their strawberry margarita that so happened to be only three dollars Monday night! I was very pleased with my drink. My boyfriend tried their mojito that was also on the happy hour special of the day. Couldn't beat the prices and hospitality that we were given! Definitely a good place to go to before the panthers games from now on.

What brought us in is the advertisement for the ribs at $12.99. We were greeted by the door being opened for us by the manager as we approached. Seated immediately and our waiter came right over. Very helpful and accommodating. We both had the ribs with our choice of two sides and our son had the fried shrimp. The food came out fast and hot. The waiter could not have been nicer. Reading past reviews I think there have been some positive changes as a result of past criticisms. Give it a second chance, if you see the big Sam's Club sign - Fridays is just before it.

Colleen R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",233,186,514,3.0,11/22/2015,"We arrived at Friday's around 5:20 PM on a Saturday for a pre-hockey game dinner, and had a really good meal. Our meal wasn't awe-inspiring, but it was satisfying and we all left happy. I'd like to give it 3.5 stars.  When you go to Fridays, you are expecting: 1) a meal consistent with ones you've had at Friday's before; 2) American food that is well seasoned and well cooked; and 3) a lively atmosphere. We got all of those last night. I was happy since I hadn't been to Friday's in a couple of years and didn't know if the quality had declined as restaurant trends have shifted.  Pros of eating here tonight: - Greeted and seated right away; - Decent happy hour drinks menu, $3-$6 (of course, we wanted some specialty drinks instead, but they weren't terribly priced at $7.50); - Food came out in about 20 minutes. The order was correct. Everything was hot. The food was cooked correctly and reflected their descriptions on the menu; - We had great service. The waitress was quick, attentive at just the right times and amount, came by to check if all was ok and to see if refills were needed, and took care of the check without any delay.  We all enjoyed our meals. Two of us had the Jack Daniels grilled chicken sandwich. It was good! I really liked the onion crispies on top, and the Jack Daniels relish/saucy stuff that came on the side. My dad liked his French dip a lot. My sister liked her hot spinach dip, but I thought it was a tad bland.  I will return to this Friday's again, and it won't take a few years.  They have a diverse and well priced menu, and our food was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-sunrise

I went with her recommendations and was over-satisfied with the food. Her drink recommendations are also great.  The quality of the food I ordered exceeded any of my previous visits here. It was served very quickly, still hot, fresh and very tasty.  The restrooms were very clean and fully stocked. The restaurant was also clean everywhere I looked around.

Joe D.,"Boca Raton, FL",161,138,165,2.0,4/3/2016,"When my office goes out to lunch or for a drink after work, Friday's is close and convenient.  I really wish they would pick somewhere else. I've tried quite a few menu options, and while the burgers are the best thing I've had, their burgers really aren't anything amazing.  My last visit looking at the drink menu it says (ask about our local and craft beers), so I did. The server proceeds to name bud light, Heineken, Guinness. I gave him a puzzled look and repeated myself and he repeated himself........ I showed him the menu and he said he's not sure he'll go ask the bar. He came back 3 minutes later and said they don't have any. So I ordered a Guinness.  Friday's is not what it used to be.

I brought my 21 year old girlfriend who has never been there before and was excited about the cup of dirt and endless apps. She tried to order an alcoholic beverage and was told by the server that because her ID was not sideways, she could not enjoy her right as an adult to purchase an adult beverage. Upon politely speaking to the manager he assured me that this is a corporate policy and understood our frustration.
