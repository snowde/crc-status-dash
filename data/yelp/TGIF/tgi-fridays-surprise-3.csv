Jessica P.,"Chandler, AZ",175,290,18,3.0,10/1/2011,Heavy mixed drinks... just the way I like it.  (hmm... I'm seeing an alcohol theme to my reviews lately) Service was pretty good and friendly... I was hanging out in the bar with my sister... I haven't actually dined here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-surprise-3
Beth S.,"El Mirage, AZ",141,485,17,1.0,10/7/2012,Never did pay us the money they owed us for our fundraiser and karma finally caught up with them. This location is CLOSED PERMANENTLY! good riddance to poor customer service and sub-par food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-surprise-3
Kristi S.,"Surprise, AZ",43,14,,2.0,9/5/2010,"I received a ton of gift cards to tgifridays... unfortunately, this is the location closest to me. The food @ this one has been mediocre and frequently incorrect. Even wrote in to their corporate office once and received a voucher for $8- pretty sad state if I don't even want to use it. Other locations have not inspired this feeling in me. Its like this one just doesn't care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-surprise-3
Madeleine P.,"Surprise, AZ",96,30,38,2.0,10/23/2012,"Wow! Was going to write a thorough review and it was not a positive one, sad to say.  I guess they saw it coming; I drove by and see THE BUILDING HAD BEEN TORN DOWN at this location....(In Surprise, W. Bell Road)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-surprise-3
Zach L.,"Surprise, AZ",3,69,,3.0,8/23/2012,"This review is just for drinks. The food sucks, but they have decent drink specials. Come to the bar after you've eaten somewhere else and watch the sun city crowd sing karaoke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-surprise-3
Siriusly M.,"Surprise, AZ",17,47,1,1.0,7/18/2007,"I have to tell you that I love T.G. I. Fridays.  The food is great...especially their Jack Daniel's grilled selections.... ...but this location has the worst service of any food chain in the northwest valley.  I drive across to the Friday's at 59th Avenue and Bell so that I can have someone actually come see that I am there within 20 minutes, maybe take my order and refill my drink once or twice....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-surprise-3
Russell R.,"Tempe, AZ",0,18,,1.0,6/21/2012,"We've been there a couple of times over the past year. Same result both times. Burger was over cooked and still somehow cold. Service was very slow. The experience was so bad, I complained on TGIF website and got an email from the manager saying they wanted to contact me so they could give me a coupon. I told them forget it, that I had zero interest in ever returning, even for free food. I completely agree with the other reviewers that say this is the worst place in Surprise. Perhaps the only restaurant in town that is totally off limits for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-surprise-3
Ryan G.,"Phoenix, AZ",36,53,2,2.0,12/20/2009,The only reason I give this place any stars is because of the bar and Sunday package. The restaurant is always empty when I visit. It's probably because of that old woman that roams around the place cackling at you while you eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-surprise-3
Sandy B.,"Surprise, AZ",0,1,,1.0,9/10/2012,"One star is one too many in my opinion. We ate there for the first time tonight, being new to the area. NEVER AGAIN! We were greeted by an unhappy host at the front who gave us a booth for my husband, me and 4 small kids. My youngest - less than a year old - was asleep in her car seat/stroller which he saw me come in with. I wheeled it up to the table and he said to me, ""Can you move that?"" Ok, ""THAT"" is my daughter. Then when I looked at him about to ask if we could move to a table instead he said, ""It's a fire hazard"" (presumably referring to the stroller next to the table), and he walked away.  Next up for our enjoyment was our waitress. Ms. No Personality. She walked to the table without a smile, asked for our drinks. When we asked her about the ""kids eat free"" promo she seemed a little irritated. She left and about 15 minutes later came back and said, ""still haven't decided?""  - in a snarky tone. We had, we were waiting for her. We ordered. We waited, and waited and waited for our food. I think it's worth noting at this point that we were 1 of maybe 5 parties in the ENTIRE restaurant. She finally comes out with the food, my 3 little ones about to have a meltdown by now. Never apologizes. Instead, she comes out with a helper who is carrying out all the plates, and the waitress marches up to our table without saying a word and starts handing ME the plates to dole out to the appropriate person. I was passing down kid meals, burgers, mac 'n cheese - one after the other. OK, isn't this HER job??? Then she hands my 7 year old a hot platter of ribs. He almost drops it on his lap and I scream, ""Isn't that HOT???"" to which she replies with attitude ""NO! It isn't hot."" Which, is a problem too - since, if it's food coming out of the grill should it not be hot??? I was miffed at this point. My husband came back to the table, who had been walking our weary 2 year old outside since the wait was so long, and told him I would no longer be looking at the waitress for fear of saying something I should not. She checked on us two times, asked if we wanted dessert and that was the end of it. She should have not received any tip - but we did leave a small one. As I was leaving she was at the hostess stand - leaning on it, talking with the hostess - who was standing there picking at her nails. I walked right by them - neither one said ""thanks"" or ""have a good night"".  I will NEVER in a thousand years spend my hard earned money at that dive again. I was so disappointed. I've been going to TGI Friday's for years and it was always a fun and happy and upbeat place. I don't know what that was that I visited tonight. I do know I will not be back. I see, from the other reviews, I'm not alone in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-surprise-3
Courtney M.,"Surprise, AZ",3,39,,1.0,7/5/2012,"Yuck, yuck, yuck & yuck. Had a $50 gift card and went here with my sister and we were not impressed. Service was slow, despite being two of very few customers. Food was terrible- I could have bought better frozen food and cooked it in my oven. With so many great places to eat in Surprise, I am not sure how this location is still in business! Used the rest of my gift card with some friends in Chandler and had a totally different experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-surprise-3
Richard R.,"Glendale, AZ",15,16,,2.0,6/4/2010,Baby back ribs were kind of dry. Sweet potato fries were too salty...the dessert was too small!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-surprise-3
