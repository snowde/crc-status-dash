Cathy W.,"Lakefront, Syracuse, NY",27,5,,5.0,9/15/2017,"Finally they got it right, we had a great meal. Our food came out quickly. It was delicious and the staff was excellent. We enjoyed our meal and time together. The restaurant was clean and packed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3
Naomi C.,"Lakefront, Syracuse, NY",55,57,126,3.0,10/12/2017,This Friday's consistently has either good service or good food. I feel like you don't see the combo platter of good service and food on the same visit. Before the foodies get all up in arms about me calling Fridays good food I am speaking about good mediocre chain restaurant food. I'm not comparing it to a fresh farm to table type of restaurant.  Our last visit had okay service. Because it was mediocre service my meal kind of suffered. I ordered what Dave considers the meal of a child and got chicken tenders and fries. It came with the tiniest of tubs of honey mustard. When we were checked on I asked for more but it never came. The chicken was too dry to eat without anything to dip it in so I was unable to finish my meal.  All in all it's not a bad choice for something quick but filling on a budget when you're at the mall. I'll be back I'm sure and much sooner than going back to GB downstairs.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3
Fox E.,"Buffalo, NY",3672,4883,17415,2.0,8/2/2017,"If you tell me that I was conceived in one of these I will tell you it is TMI Fridays.  I quite liked some of the non-alcy drinks but they're too expensive. The food is average by Chain standards but really bad in general. The prices are way too high and it pisses me off that people are so obsessed with this place. I believe it's mostly because of the alcohol. If you want really good noms in Syracuse, go to Strong Hearts instead - get a Blueberry Cupcake and a Cesar Chavez Milkshake. But if you're stuck here in the old Carousel, then after your TGIF meal, go get a bubble tea from KFT.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3
Guy R.,"Syracuse, NY",1,67,78,3.0,6/7/2017,"Service was very good, our waitress was very attentive, and checked on the table frequently.  We ordered the appetizer combo which had wings, skins and mozz sticks. Food was ok, nothing spectacular, the potato skins were slightly under cooked. I had the Cobb Salad, good portion size, tasted fine.  Its not gonna WOW you, but its decent food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3
Tonya L.,"Syracuse, NY",0,3,,1.0,1/11/2018,"Our last experience here was horrible. My husband said he has never felt so unsatisfied after eating a meal out. First, it took over 20 minutes for our waitress to come to our table for drink orders, we had to ask for utensils, our food was brought out by a different server and there were several things wrong with the order. Our waitress didn't come to check on us until we were we'll into our meal. We had to ask for refills and missing condiments several times from different servers. The manager did come over and apologize for the food order being wrong and did not charge us for that item, which was nice. We will probably never visit this place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3
Bryan G.,"Corona, CA",1,24,54,1.0,12/10/2017,"Can you leave less than one star? Hopefully Yelp can fix this. The annual KROCK Santa Con was yesterday and while I realize that being inundated with Santa clad customers wasn't ideal they should have been better prepared. To the credit of the bar staff they were trying to get drinks out but they really could have stepped up the staffing for the event. The reason for the 1 star (and less if I could give it) was the manager that was a real jerk to everyone, I've included a photo... We tried to get his attention since he was just kind of hovering over the bar staff but was hardly doing anything. He ignored us along with a lot of others that were attempting to get his attention. The KROCK Santa Con called for us to purchase a Sam Adams Lager ($4 for a pint, good price) it wasn't a requirement to get your card signed off however this guy missed this announcement. Running around with the group I was in the designated driver was having sodas or water at the bars and while the manager at TGI Fridays did instruct the staff to singn her card he told the bartender to (keep it on the downlow as he was requiring others to purchase the lager) - one of the gals overheard this I didn't hear it directly. Wouldn't surprise me given the way this manager was acting all night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3
Malory L.,"Rochester, NY",0,4,,1.0,11/28/2017,Not the best experience. First out appetizer came before our bar beverages. Then when my boyfriends meal came out it had the wrong side. Then me and my friends salad was literally missing ingredients. And the only thing the manager could say was that the portioning was off. There was no restitution whatsoever and out party paid over $100 on top of that! Poor service as well as the waitress forgot several things throughout our experience. It started with waiting a half hour for our beverages. Meanwhile the host was like a zombie an apparently couldn't speak when he mistakingly brought us to another couples table to sit. Would not recommend this Friday's to anyone. .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3
Jaznea B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",87,15,8,1.0,5/17/2017,"No bartenders at the bar. All glasses are empty at the bar. All the employees are gathered in one section talking even the rude manager. The bar was dirty when we got here. When we asked the ""manager"" for help he dismissed us.  We have been waiting over 10 mins for a server to even ask us if we need anything.  When we first walked in it was just horrible experience from jump. Get it the fuck together!  I will be calling to complain ‍",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3

Sam L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",37,10,3,1.0,6/21/2017,I usually always get terrible service at Fridays and it was no different today. Walked in for my lunch break and after five minutes no one had even come by to my table. I got up and walked right out. I'm done giving this franchise any more chances. Fridays you suck.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3
Ethan S.,"Corolla, NC",0,5,4,5.0,8/20/2017,This place had good food and great scented wipes you should go there and try them out. They smell so good. I mean this was one of the best wipes I have ever used. Left my fingers spotless.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3
Tori G.,"Syracuse, NY",2,58,52,3.0,9/30/2016,"I enjoy the familiarity of Fridays and their pretzel appetizers. I really enjoy the strawberry fields salad with steak, too.

Melissa O.,"Canastota, NY",42,11,3,2.0,12/29/2016,"If I could give the food a higher rating and the service only one star I would have.  Overall - nice atmosphere, good beer and appetizers. I suggest going here if you plan to use the bar. Food - (once it finally got ordered) was delicious! And came out pretty quickly. I had skillet meal that was boiling hot and I would absolutely get again. Shared a pick four appetizer and again everything was delicious and hot. You can't go wrong with the apps at any TGIF. Service - I try hard not to bash service, and would never if I had only been here once. Unfortunately this is the third time I've received poor service at this location (has progressively gotten worse :-( which is too bad because the food is good).  We got a booth rather quickly and sat for about 15 min before we saw our server. Ordered water and our meals all at once. We didn't get our water until our food was brought out and the glasses were dirty and had hard crusty stuff on the outside and things floating in it. We had to wave down our waitress to ask for new glasses and then we watched her dump the water out and just use a rag at the service station to wipe off the outside and fill up the same cups. By this time we were basically done eating so we continued our meals without a beverage. The waiter not once checked on us and we had to ask a different server to bring us our check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3
Bailey S.,"Clay, NY",51,7,,4.0,4/14/2017,"Our visit started out with not being waited on for close to a half hour, luckily another waitress noticed us without drinks or food and got the manager Bryan. Bryan was very nice and got us exactly what we needed and we had drinks and food within 15 minutes.

Brenda R.,"Clay, NY",16,5,3,1.0,8/5/2016,"Buyer beware!  The appetizers for $10 is a good idea. The problem is they serve one appetizer at a time. I would have liked 2 appetizers to start then one at a time after that. The potato skins where from frozen and they left much to be desired! The potato skins were extremely salty. The potato skins were dry and the texture was horrible. It was completely inedible. It was so bad I had to speak to the manager. I ordered 4 appetizers, but only ate 3. My bill was $10.80, but the gratuity calculator listed the 15% gratuity as $3.69. The explanation from the manager was the gratuity was calculated on the full price of each items and not on the sell price. I told him that was misleading gratuity is calculated on to total bill. If a customer chooses to pay more that is up to the customer.  So my gratuity was calculated based on 4 appetizers , even though I only ate 3. There was no need for me  to say take this off my bill. The special was all you can eat for $10.  I think TGIFriday's get you in with specials and then gives you the middle finger as you walk out the door! If you're on a budget and you go to TGIFriday's calculate your gratuity yourself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3

Jess M.,"San Jose, CA",38,109,29,3.0,3/9/2015,"We come here sometimes when we are in the mood for bar food and also don't want to spend too much money. Most days they have some sort of appetizer special (for example Sundays are half priced apps). They also have 2 for 1 well drinks, long island ice teas, and margaritas every day in addition to whatever other daily drink special. I stick with well drinks, as usually their margaritas and long islands are too sweet for me. I find their food pretty good overall, but it isn't anything special. I do love their boneless wings, both the buffalo flavored and the BBQ flavored, and their flatbreads are tasty. I find their potato skins to be greasy sometimes, and their burgers are hit or miss. We did send our food back once because our boneless wings had virtually no sauce to be found on them. Our bartender got it taken care of quickly and with a smile and apology, which we appreciated.  We only ever sit at the bar, and service has been consistent. The bartenders are friendly and attentive, and if we ever need something it isn't difficult to get someone's attention. It does get crowded sometimes, but it is a TGI Friday's in a large mall, so that is to be expected. I often see a lot of families here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3
Lina S.,"Ewa Beach, HI",33,100,199,4.0,7/15/2015,"Whenever I come to New York, I always make it a point to visit a nearby TGIF because Hawaii locations closed down a number of years ago. It was a comfort food location that reminds me of my childhood.  I came to this location filled with anticipation. It took a while to get a person to seat my family, despite the fact that a group of waiters standing around saw us (and notified no one). The area where we were seated was dangerously slick to the point where we slid around on the floors in our chairs for each little movement. It took a while for our table to be waited ""properly"". By this, I mean we had several waitresses walk by and ask us if we've been helped yet, some offering us to get menus or drinks and not returning. My family and I were a bit annoyed by this. When we finally got ourselves a waitress, she was just the best. She was incredibly peppy and enthusiastic about helping us out with the menu and got our food and drinks out quite fast. There was a mix-up with my appetizer and had the wrong order made for me, but was given the mistake gyoza (or ""potstickers""), on the house, alongside the correct order. We didn't have to flag her down for drink refills - or even endless wing refills! She promptly asked what flavor we wanted to try next so that, by the time we finished one plate, the next batch was already being delivered to us.  I'll most likely come back to this TGI the next time I'm in NY. Who knows, maybe the third visit is the charm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3
Cleo E.,"Las Vegas, NV",172,294,388,4.0,1/22/2015,"After playing a 5 Wits adventure, two of my friends were dying to come in here and chow down on Jack Daniel's burgers, so majority rules- we went in to eat at TGIF's.  When we were seated and given our menu's mine was empty, so I used  a friends LOL.  Anyway, what I ordered was the ""6oz Sirloin, with Tomato Mozzarella Salad, and Mashed Potatoes,""  there is an add an item with your steak so I got lobster tail. The steak was surprisingly juicy and had good flavor, the tomato salad was refreshing and delicious, but the potatoes tasted as if they came from a box. Needless to say, I didn't finish the mashed potatoes.  As a TGIF goes it's par for the course, at least our food came without too  long of a wait and was cooked well- no real serious complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3?start=20
Dima T.,"San Antonio, TX",78,5,,4.0,8/21/2016,"Food was functional, Service was great. We dined at 5:30PM on Saturday. The place was about 80% full. The wait was very short. The wrong appetizer was brought out, the waiter offered to leave it for us while we waited for the correct appetizer. Everything else came out quickly and was timed perfectly. The food was functional, pretty good, as expected for a chain restaurant. The best thing was the flatbread appetizer (ironically, the ""wrong"" appetizer).

Alyssa W.,"Syracuse, NY",0,3,,5.0,5/6/2017,"The first time I came to this establishment I received the worst service I have ever had in a restaurant setting. My friends and I waited 20 mins for water, our food took forever to come out, the silverware came about five minutes after the food, and just overall terrible service. I was then dragged there again two other times where the service was mediocre. Last night, I came in with some friends and it was like a whole new establishment. All the staff was very friendly. We had made a reservation and were sat immediately when we walked in.  Our server, Bri K. gave us awesome service. She was so polite and excited to be there. Even though they were obviously super busy and she was too, she managed to check up on us regularly (because we had ordered drinks and endless apps), and we got our food and drinks in a timely manner.  The food was pretty good. We got the chicken wings and potato skins. I had the berry mojito shaker which was super yummy. I would recommend this place to a friend. They had a large fun cocktail menu and the endless $10 apps could not be beat.

Becky R.,"Hannibal, NY",18,15,2,3.0,4/6/2017,"My husband and I made reservations on valentines day. When making the reservation we specifically asked to be seated away from children. We also made sure the server was aware of our request upon arrival. We have three kids of our own and when we go out to dinner without them we don't like to sit next to other peoples screaming kids. When we arrived the place was practically empty. They could have seated us anywhere in the resturaunt so thatvwe could have a nice quiet dinner. But they sat us next to a young couple that were arguing instead. Not just next to them mind you. I felt like we were sitting at the same table because their seating is so close together. They argued the whole time. We placed our order and before we even got our appetizers in comes a large family with 5 small children. Again the place is just about empty and they sat the family right next to us. Aside from this our food was delicious and our server was very helpful and friendly.  The only issue I had with the food was, I ordered a pasta dish that normally comes with a side of shrimp. But I don't eat it so I asked instead to have extra chicken in my smdish in place of it. There was barely any chicken. But still tasted ok. I really think this location should make seating more comfortable and not so cramped together as well as listen to their customers when they make a special request.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3?start=20

The waiters at Fridays have really good manners. I was greeted instantly and warmly as I entered the restaurant, and the waitresses smiled all the time. They are so patient and pleasant. It seems that they all love their jobs.  In addition, the service provided is also outstanding. Upon my request, the bartender made a drink that was not on the menu. I was so surprised! They are such adorable and flexible people. The quality of food is spectacular as usual. I love their ribs and shrimps, and I strongly recommend them for their freshness and specialness of taste.

Mark S.,"Washington, DC",0,1,,1.0,3/24/2017,"the service was terrible. I don't care if your kitchen is slow and having terrible ticket times. I work in the industry as a server and this was terrible. The server took 15 mins to greet us another 15 mins to bring two drinks. then we each ordered endless apps and my wife got her fried pickels first, then finished them and got her second order before i ever got my potato skins! i asked for a manager, our server brings us our potato skins in the mean time and not three mins later a manager comes over and our server is behind her bringing our entrees, 3 mins after i get my first and only order of skins, i get my burger while my wife had two servings of fried pickles. The server said its the kitchen, rudely and harsh mannered, with no sympathy, not the least bit. So manager asks us while she witnessed all of this, what can i do for you, what would you like me to do. I said mamm the balls in your court you can figure this out because if it wasn't 10pm at night i would go somewhere else. I had her box my food, the manager took off my burger and one endless app. but money is not the point, i wanted to get dessert as well and here i am rushing out of this restaurant. the manager handled it well, thank god, but the server was terrible. the worst i have ever encountered. a little communication would be nice, let us know that ur kitchen is slow and that you apologize,  reassure and put a smile on your face i dont care if it is fake.  you're at work at a professional establishment and you looked like a clown at the circus my friend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3?start=20

To kill time we decided to watch a movie and ended up in this mall on a Sunday night. Everything was closed except for the movie theater and TGIF. I desperately needed coffee to stay awake but unfortunately the concession stalls at the movie theater had a broken coffee machine.  We decided to buy coffee from TGIF. We went in and asked the host if they had coffee to go. He went in to check with his manager. The manager came out and asked us if we just wanted coffee to go and nothing else. We said ""Yes!"". He said are you sure? ""Coffee here is fairly expensive, you'd rather get it at the movie theater if that is all you need"" and I said ""Yes, but their coffee machines are broken"" (I really needed that coffee to stay awake). He looked at me and understood. Went in got us two coffee's to go. When I asked him how much I owed him, he said ""these are on me"". It was the sweetest gesture from no where.

She told me it was impossible to have that be done, but then I could have my sliders and broccoli on two separate plates come out with the entree. That did not happen, my sliders came out as an appetizer with the other appetizers and when everybody's entree came out my ONE big piece of broccoli came out. I looked foolish with just one big piece of broccoli in a soup bowl while everyone else had what they ordered.

Kat N.,"North Port, FL",92,29,27,2.0,12/15/2014,"We are in Syracuse on business, and based on a recommendation from someone we met, decided to check out Destiny mall and eat at Friday's. I couldn't regret the decision more. First, the young ladies working hostess counter, after greeting us proceeded to bash co-workers in front of us, complaining about menus not being returned or the bar answering their calls. They, within earshot of us, referred to their peers as ""crack heads."" Then when we were finally seated we were greeted by our very nice server, but had to wait 20 minutes for a watered down drink order. After tasting the drinks, 2 of the orders were sent back as they tasted like water. When one of our party stepped up to the bar to ask on an ETA on the remake, she was spoken to rudely by the bartender. It took over 45 minutes after we were seated to receive our meals. Realizing we were frustrated, our server asked her manager to come talk to us. He offered a discount on our meals for our extensive wait and apologized. The meal orders were wrong as well, but we were so hungry and tired of waiting that we just ate what we had. When our checks arrived, two of them were wrong and needed further correction. At that point another manager came to apologize, assuming she knew the story when she didn't. She was in training, and the manager who had promised the discounts didn't bother to finish handling the situation. In fact, when he saw us, he ducked his head and avoided us. The manager in training apologized and kept reiterating that this was not the norm & the goal was a 10. Although she tried, the situation was already unmanageable and should never have been handed off by the manager on duty. Needless to say, if the server hadn't shown much care, this review would be a 1 and I'll never be returning to this particular Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3?start=20
Dave S.,"Syracuse, NY",64,70,176,3.0,9/5/2013,"Went for dinner tonight with my girlfriend. First walking through the door. This place is unlike any tgi Fridays I've ever been too. A very modern and sleek design in comparison to others. Wait staff was very friendly and was seated quickly. As for the food. That's where the problem laid for me. I ordered the whiskey ribeye with shrimp scampi. Two sides tomato mozzarella salad and parmesan ""steak fries"". The steak was cooked properly (ordered mid rare)but wasn't exactly what I'd call a ribeye. Poorly seasoned. No marble. Sort of blah and kind of tough, which I found odd given it wasn't cooked to death, the shrimp were poorly cleaned and over cooked to the point where it was tough to eat. The mozz salad had no seasoning and was far too oniony for my liking. The ""steak fries"" were actually pretty tasty. Although, the quotes are because they are actually potato wedges. And the whole plate was swimming in a pool of grease. Literally my steak probably could have been floating there was so much oil on the plate. And the bruschetta-esque topping on the shrimp, pretty much coated the whole plate. It was sloppy and underwhelming for a 22$ meal. Though it could have just been an off night. Waitress (Felicia, I believe she said her name was) was very attentive and freshened up drinks and took plates without even being prompted. For now it's 3 stars for me. But given the experience. I would try it again, maybe the food would be better a second time around. All in all. Not wow. But not awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3?start=60
Rachel C.,"Syracuse, NY",58,44,34,3.0,5/29/2014,"I went here this evening for a drink and something to eat with one of my girlfriends. Our service was ok but nothing to write home about. The bartender was not the least bit friendly, never smiled and seemed to be annoyed that she was waiting on us. Not a huge deal as everyone has an off day and I was there for the company of my friend anyway. On the other hand, the food was less than desirable. I've always been a fan of pretty much everything at TGIFridays. I think they have one of the most well rounded and freshest tasting menus as far as chain restaurants go. My potato skins were cold and over cooked. There was not any soft potato left to them. Last I knew they also used shredded cheese on them. These had a large thick piece of what looked to be cheese cut from a brick just sitting in the middle barely melted. They were not anything like what I have eaten there in the past. Ordinarily I probably would have mentioned it to the person serving me but it was quite a while before she came to check on us and as I mentioned her attitude was poor to begin with. I'm sure some time in the future I will be back. Hopefully the food and service are better then.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3?start=60

Joelle S.,"Syracuse, NY",0,6,3,4.0,7/6/2014,"You just can't go wrong with 2 for 1 drinks with an attentive bar tender. Went in and sat at the bar with my boyfriend and 2 of our friends. 2 of us got the 2 for 1 Long Island iced teas and 2 of us chose the margaritas. Both were good sized drinks and definitely weren't weak. We enjoyed our first round of drinks so we decided to grab some appetizers and another round, which I'm glad we did. I thought the potato skins were cooked perfectly, nice and crispy. Our friends ordered their appetizers at the same time as us, but the woman who brought food out only brought ours, and as soon as the bartender waiting on us noticed they hadn't received theirs at the same time, she was quick to go back and grab them.

Patrick B.,"Liverpool, NY",31,123,41,5.0,4/5/2015,"I didn't like TGI Friday's until I came to this one. The giant open room feels great and very inviting. The giant bar is awesome and even a little showy which is kinda cool! I've never had to wait to get a table, even when it was fairly busy. Food was great, only thing I regret buying is a cookie dessert thing that was incredibly small but fairly pricey. This is a great place to go at the mall, don't brush it off just because it's a popular chain, this one is pretty awesome!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3?start=40

Staff was fine; they didn't set the location up, so I can't blame them. The food wasn't anything special, even by my low chain-restaurant standards. Biggest disappointment was the ""Triple Decker Reuben"" in which TGI Fridays has apparently lost all connection to it's NYC roots. I couldn't find the sauerkraut anywhere on it and the six filaments I thought might be the sauerkraut must have been caramelized onion.  The sandwich should have been billed as ""Corned Beef and Cheese"" because I couldn't locate any of the other elements of a Reuben. Gave TGI Friday's a chance but I probably won't make that mistake again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3?start=40
Frank P.,"Perry, GA",67,68,26,1.0,11/17/2014,Today at 3pm we approached the hostess and asked if we could sit at one of the outer tables. Miss Hostess gave us an attitude and gave us their limited coverage speech. She sat us. I thought about where I was and left. Gave back the menus and told Miss Hostess we were leaving because of her attitude. This is the second time I've been here and both trips have been disappointing.

K G.,"Cortland, NY",0,4,,1.0,12/10/2015,"I was at the mall with my wife and newborn child when we decided to try TGIF for dinner.  Our one month old was asleep in his stroller when we got to the restaurant. The hostess took a look at the stroller and told us we would need to park in outside the restaurant. We were expected to take our child out of the stroller in order to go inside and eat. I asked the hostess what they expected us to do with our child while we ate and were told they have high chairs. I tried to explain how a one month old can not sit in a high chair, however she just did not get it through her head.

Erin B.,"Syracuse, NY",77,8,,1.0,6/11/2014,"So many people are giving this place a good review, I had to comment.  We went for late night drinks and bar snacks.  The dining room was empty and the bar was fairly busy.  There were 3 bartenders and they did not do a very good job of keeping up or knowing their wares.  The food was as uninspired and bland as any casual chain restaurant.  My boyfriend ordered a dirty martini.  It was $9 and ALL olive juice.  As in not drinkable, no discernible gin at all.  We had just been at Dave & Busters, paid $4 for a Hendricks and tonic, so a $9 well martini that wasn't even drinkable was a shock.  We go out more than the average person and work in restaurants, so we're often a bit more forgiving of a place than other people, but we have no interest in ever coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3?start=40

Shelley B.,"Gloversville, NY",29,2,,4.0,6/3/2015,"I liked the ambiance of this restaurant and that they accepted my phone coupon for reward points because I didn't print it off on paper like I usually do. They took $8 off our bill and made the experience a pleasant one. I wanted to visit Margaritaville in the Destiny USA mall but that didn't pan out so my second choice was my old time favorite, TGI Fridays. We got seated right away and serviced right away. The hostess was a little strange acting but pleasant enough. Our waitress was friendly as well and assisted me in obtaining the coupon code she needed to take the discount off our bill. I ordered the Jack Daniels Chicken tenders appetizer as my meal and a side order of fries. Both of those things were good. I ordered a new drink for myself, called the Gold Medalist, which is a non alcoholic drink slush, with pineapple juice, coconut juice, grenadine, and banana puree in it. When I tasted it, it wasn't that good. The waitress asked me how it was? I said ""not that good. It is watery tasting. I don't taste the banana in it at all or even coconut."" She offered to get me another one but I said no thank you. She checked with the bar tender who she had told me was new on the job. She came back and said that the manager said that they had a bad batch of bananas come in that weren't ripe enough to make the drink taste good. I didn't say anything to the waitress but why would you as a manager say that and then continue to serve a drink that isn't good enough to begin with? I didn't think that was a proper thing to say even if it were true. I mean, don't serve the drink at all. That told me that they only cared about getting the money for the drink than being honest with the customers on this particular drink. Other than that, my friends food was pretty good too; both of them had hamburgers and fries. My only other concern was that the wall up against our table was dirty with food spatters. As a restaurant reviewer anyways I tend to notice every little thing. I also didn't think it was right that I ordered an appetizer food as my main dinner food, that I had to wait to be served as my friends burger dinners came out before mine. My chicken tenders could have been a little hotter in temperature but still tasted good. I would recommend this restaurant overall as it was a lively place and that is what I expected from here. Our total bill came to $34 for 3 people with tax, no tip. Yes, we left a tip as she did earn it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3?start=40

Brian C.,"Venice, FL",0,21,4,1.0,9/27/2014,"Stopped at Fridays on a Friday evening. First sat at the bar, there were 3 bartenders at the far end. The bar was not busy yet and all 3 bartenders just stood there without waiting on me. Finally I got up and went to a hostess and requested a table since I was waiting for some friends to show up. I waited over 15 minutes at the table before anyone came to see me. Again the restaurant was not yet busy.  After my friends arrived, they had to wait an extended period of time before anyone came to take their order. After we finally placed our order for some drinks , it was over another 25 minutes before we received them. The waitress blamed it on training being done at the bar. You would think this would not be done on a Friday evening. We were going to eat here but were so disgusted we got up and left. Ended up going to the Cheesecake Factory where we were promptly waited on. Also had a great dinner there.  The lack of service and attention at TGIFridays would make me hesitate to ever come back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-syracuse-3?start=40
