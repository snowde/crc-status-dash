April W.,"Oceanside, CA",72,293,116,4.0,9/8/2017,My friend & I stopped here for some conversation & dinner. Was a little afraid after I read the reviews. .  We were sat pretty fast. Ordered. I had a salad. It was good. My friend ordered the flat bread. She said it tasted stale.  Service was pretty good. We had two waitresses. One was getting trained. So it had to be easier with two of them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2
Al M.,"Menifee, CA",43,14,15,2.0,11/14/2017,"With two kids, we thought this restaurants would be a good place to eat on a Tuesday night. On Tuesday evenings, kids eat free. But it would have been worth the time to pay full price elsewhere. We waited almost an hour to receive our food. Kids were hungry and restless but we stuck it out waiting. When our food finally arrived, it was cold and crusty. My $11 burger was mediocre at best. When our check came, we only got one kid's plate for free after they told us that both kid's plates would be free. When we asked the waitress to check our receipt and make the adjustment, a second waitress walked by and gave us attitude.  We will not be back and hope you have a better experience than we did.  All in all, the waitress was nice and kind to us .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2
Liz M.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",69,26,20,1.0,10/21/2017,"So this is our 3rd time visiting this place. Both of our earlier visits were at night, and the experience was ok, but the food was good so we decided to try and go in today for lunch. Bad idea. It began when we first walked in. The host sat us in a table where 4 people would sit comfortably, (we're 5), but we took it because we were hungry and figured that wasn't a deal breaker for us. We then noticed the table was dirty, and instead of moving us, he came back with a wet cloth and let us know that it was 'sanitizer' and proceeded to clean the table half ass. Then and there should have been reason enough to leave, but again, having hungry kids made us try and make the best of the situation. So, waitress comes over, she seemed friendly enough and took our orders. I kid you not, 5 mins after we placed our order, she comes up to my 10 year old and says, ""Sweetie, we don't have any pepperoni for your pizza, is cheese ok?"" My son said ok and proceeded to wait for our food. Like 3 mins later, she comes back again and tells me, ""Ma'am, I'm sorry, we ran out of Brussel sprouts, is there something else you'd like instead?"" I had my heart set on it, but asked for a side salad. This was during lunch time, at 1pm, and already they were running out of their menu items. 25 mins passed, and we were contemplating leaving. I regret that we didn't after our food came out. I ordered a 2 for grill item, I chose a sirloin with parmesan crusted chicken. I swear to you, I don't know how small that chicken was, but it was even tinier than a chicken strip. I cut into it and it was rubbery. Sirloin was ok, but it had no seasoning whatsoever. My husband ordered that burger that comes with a wing on top, the wing was cold, almost as if they defrosted it, but not thoroughly. To top it off, our waitress continuously checked in on other diners, but not us. We are never going back there. Please save your money. Its overpriced and so not worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2
Oscar V.,"Escondido, CA",1,32,7,5.0,1/13/2018,We came in 12 deep the wait was expected but not like other restaurants near by(2hr wait). Our server Sadie was amazing she was super friendly and very very very patient with my entire family. The food came out with no mistakes. Everyone enjoyed the food with no complaints. We where a little skeptical of the past reviews but by far exceeded everyones expectations. Sadie and all the lady servers are amazing.

Chelsea G.,"Murrieta, CA",160,24,27,2.0,11/14/2017,Has the food gotten worse?  I don't understand what was wrong with the spinach artichoke dip?! They changed it to some slimy spinach dip with weird cheese curds. Tastes so weird!!! Disgusting texture! Fix that. Homemade chips were chewy! Some were ok.. burger wasn't medium.. it was a typical Friday burger.. I swear they up'd the prices and made the food semi worse lol I guess you can't expect too much at these chain restaurants anymore.. the chefs don't care so they're all .. ehh.. smh,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2

Stephanie P.,"Hemet, CA",0,3,4,2.0,8/18/2017,"The customer service was very good. Our server was sweet and friendly. Refills on time, suggestions on food.  On the other hand food not so good. A friend and I decided to get the Endless apps. We expected fresh tasting wings and pot stickers but instead got mildly cold and bland tasting food. We seriously think everything we ordered was frozen and then just warm up in the microwave or something . We got their meatballs (that we did not order) and you know meat balls are usually very flavorful especially with sauce on top, nope this tasted like something my dog would eat. I make better meat balls.. (I really do) maybe I expected to much. Oh and my pot stickers has a hair from their sauce brush. I freaked out until they explain what was going on.

Took 15 min before anyone even acknowledged us. The we ordered 2 draft beers. They brought one in about 10 min and said the keg was empty for the other beer and they would being it right away nearly 20 min later the second beer got there. We ordered an appetizer queso artichoke dip and chips. Took FOREVER! We were waiting on our daughter to get there to order dinner and decided that because the service was so SLOW, we would eat elsewhere. Lost my business.

Jordan D.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,6,,1.0,1/13/2018,"This place sucks so bad I would not even feed my dog the food. The waitress was not funny and her jokes were stupid. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger medium well, so the burger comes out first bit not bad second bit saw a little pink third bit its raw. Told the waitress this burger is raw I want it cooked more please. She replies ""oh a little to pink for you we can share it i like it"" and walks away. So I kind of sit there not knowing what to think, but I assumed that she was going to the kitchen to have a new one made well i was wrong i had to bring it to her attention once again. So she finally goes and has them make me a new one. Waited 25 minuets or longer... for a burger and let me tell you they must have cooked this thing the entire 25 minutes i was waiting because that sucker was like a hockey puck. So if this place wants to survive get new cooks and new management and finally some new waiters/waitresses that don't want to share the raw food that can make you sick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2
Sonja D.,"Temecula, CA",35,18,,1.0,10/23/2017,"The quality is going down and the prices are going up. How do you raise the prices $4 at a time?!?!?! Endless appetizers went from $9.99 to $13.99. They got rid of their awesome Mac n cheese and replaced it with Kraft. If you want that or Brussel sprouts with your meal you have to pay an extra $3 each. Thats bullshit. They also got rid of the mozzarella tomato salad. We went there the other day and after hearing all this we cancelled our orders and left. The tables are also always sticky and the food takes forever. We won't be back. Oh and I forgot to add if you don't take your leftovers with you (I was eating a salad and my boyfriend was eating something that wouldn't have reheated well) this one weirdo manager will guilt trip you for it... ""don't you have kids you can give it to, or a neighbor"" uh I paid for my food and can do whatever I want, I'm not a wasteful person but salad wilts overnight and my boyfriends dish very honestly wouldn't have tasted any better the next day.

Magically after complaining (which I hate to do) the food arrives in minutes. the food and plate was hot - probably on a heat lamp for god know how long. The food was .. consumable. My wife's drink glass is cracked nearly thru around the cup - do they not pay attention..? On top of it all, We have a 2 year old and the poor dude was so starving hungry and grumpy I felt so bad.  The manager doles out sorries and appetizer vouchers, but why would I come back here to use them? They split the check but ended up duplicating it from one side of the split.

Desiree G.,"Winchester, CA",33,2,2,1.0,9/22/2017,"$55 down the drain. My coworker and I decided to give TGI Fridays a shot tonight since neither of us had ever been here, and I'm thoroughly disappointed. It was a mess from the second we walked in. We stood in the entry way for at least 5 minutes before we came to the conclusion that we must just have to pick a seat. Meanwhile, at least three servers made eye contact with the two of us. They only decided to serve us when they saw that we decided to just go take a seat at one of the tables. Then came the food, we got the Jack Daniels appetizer sampler thing to split and two entrees. We also had ordered the nachos, but they never came. So for the sampler: the ribs were good, and shrimp was good, but the chicken strips were burnt and drowned in sauce. The Cajun Chicken and Shrimp pasta: the Alfredo was already separated, you could literally see the pools of orange grease all over the plate. Leading me to believe that they just have preportioned servings of the sauce just sitting in a cooler waiting to be heated up in a microwave. Sizzling chicken and cheese: coworker said the chicken had no flavor. Mind you, that plate was about $18 for two pieces of bland chicken atop a boiling puddle of cheese with two scoops of mashed potatoes plopped on the other side of the skillet. $18!!!! After an email coupon that eliminated the entire cost of one of the entrees, we still ended up with a bill of $45.01. Then with tip we payed $55. So irritating. Could have bought two whole 2 for $20 deals at Applebee's and the quality would have been 40x better. Can't believe how outrageously priced this disgusting food is. This place doesn't live up to the hype at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2?start=60

Scott A.,"Hemet, CA",0,27,,1.0,7/24/2017,"Horrible! Came here 3 weeks ago with my son we were seated at 4:45pm Hoping to eat then catch a movie at 6pm. With an EMPTY restaurant our food came at 5:45pm and it was COLD like it sat under an AC vent for 15min before being brought to our table. Fast forward to last week. Tried this place again with my gf. I dropped her off and she went in to pee while I parked. I came in didn't see her seated so I asked for a table for 2 after waiting 5 minutes for the greeter to even come up and seat us. While waiting another couple came in and were waiting behind me. As the seater came up and I told her table for 2 she said ok but the lady behind me was here first basically telling me I cut the line and I was the only one there for like 3 minutes! So after insulting me the lady behind me said he was here first so then we got seated. After waiting 15min to place our order, an hour later our food came. This time they forgot to add the veggies to my gf plate and forgot to add my spinach to my plate. HOW DO YOU FORGET TO COMPLETE THE PLATES PER YOUR OWN FREAKIN MENU! This place is horrible.

Douglas B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,2,,1.0,8/6/2017,"Can Friday's get any worse. Saw all the bad reviews but these endless appetizer commercials made me want to try Friday's one more time. The food they serve doesn't look anything like the commercial. The commercial shows a plate of 8 potato skins being served up. We were given 4. The commercial shows a plate of 6 qusedea on a plate, we only got 3. Each appetizer cost $10 so we ordered refills that were supposed to be free and endless.  We ordered chicken wings and were given some kind of honey crispy boneless chicken minus any of the ranch dressing, celery or carrot sticks that they show in their commercials. Our bill showed 6 to 8$ for each refill that they were never supposed to charge us for. Between the long wait for each refill and the disparity in the food quality, I just paid my bill and couldn't wait to get out of there.

We got there at 12:30 am knowing their kitchen closed at 1am because I called before coming to double check. Walked in and no one acknowledged that I had even walked in. There was a server who was standing right there at a table in the bar area and looked at me and didn't even say one word. Not hey just give me one second, NOTHING! So I decided to just seat myself but had to ask the bartender if it was open seating. He said that's cool, sit wherever. Thinking once we sat down that someone would come over and acknowledge the fact that we were sitting there. The same server who looked at me in the beginning passed out table atleast 3 times and never once stopped asking for our drink orders or even food, knowing the kitchen was closing soon. Total bs. Then to make matters worse there were employees walking around aimlessly not even batting an eye at the fact that no one had come over to take care of us. And then the icing on the cake was when the bartender was taking alcohol bottle and tossing them up in the air juggling. Rather than taking care of his section. Sat there for a total of 15 mins and not a single person did it said anything. I decided to walk out and take my money elsewhere.

Greg S.,"Temecula, CA",184,111,49,3.0,4/16/2016,"We came here for the unlimited appetizers.  To start it off it was a friday, and it was pretty busy. We waited quite a while to get in. Our waitress was really good, unfortunately she was stuck running around. The kitchen on the other hand.. dude. The only reason I'm giving a 3 is because of our waitress. We came in around 7, waited apx 30 minutes and got a seat in the bar. Our waitress came over quickly and got our drinks and appetizers settled. That's where the over 3 hour adventure began.  We got our first appetizers within 15 minutes. Not an awful wait, but stuff was missing. The potato skins looked awful. Little to no cheese on most, 1-2 bacon bits on each, no chives, they hardly put sour cream in the dish. We also had mozzarella sticks but those are hard to mess up. We put in our next order as soon as we got them...  An hour after placing our order, we'd been sitting there for 50 of that with no food, a small pile of wings get there with hardly any sauce (supposed to be jack Daniels sauce) as well as our other appetizer. Great. Eat that and we have our next order placed, within 20 minutes.  Another hour and it gets there. By the time we got that it was literally 945 and we were tired of the noise and being there, so the waitress was able to get us a box even though I guess she wasn't supposed to. Which was cool.

R B.,"Temecula, CA",0,4,1,1.0,9/9/2017,"Awful service, cold food, grumpy employees.  Pretty much sums it up. We for lunch on Saturday and it was EMPTY.  Took 10 mins to get drinks, another 15 to place and order, nearly 30 to get a soup and salad along with a couple kids meals and then 10 mins after we were all clearly done eating to get the bill.  There were 2 tables in our section and our waitress never bothered to refill drinks. Had to get what I think was the manager to simply refill my kids juice and she scoffed at my request, taking 10 mins to refill a kids apple juice. Will never go back.   I don't know what Friday's is trying to reinvent itself as but menu prices are through the roof and service was awful.  Find a different place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2?start=20

A few minutes later our waitress brought them. We weren't quite ready... first mistake. We waited for another 8-10 minutes for to come back. We almost left but we didn't.  Second mistake.  We opted to order the endless apps and side salad each, hoping this would make the food come out a bit quicker. Nope. My husband's beer came reasonably. After maybe 15 minutes we got our salads. We finished them and sat.... and sat... and about 40 minutes after we had ordered, and my husband canceled the apps and asked for the check. The waitress then brought our mozzarella sticks and said the wings didn't look good so she wouldn't bring them out. She agreed to take it off our bill and the manager came and gave us our check. No one apologized.  I gave 2 stars because we did get to eat the mozzarella sticks before leaving and they tasted good.

Naomi G.,"Orange County, CA",47,15,71,1.0,11/24/2017,First of all I believe they should have less than one star available for ratings.  I understand when restaurants are open on Thanksgiving there could be issues. However from the beginning of my visit if I hadn't been hungry I would have left. It took almost 15 minutes to get a table despite the fact they were many empty tables hadn't been cleared. The place was basically in shambles. As for my waiter I was fully aware it was his 3rd day a on the job as he told me at least 5 times during our entire interactions. I mentioned to him to stop telling me this over and over again he then didn't come back the table at all. I understand his inexperience however the person truly to be blamed is his supervisor for not training him well and not giving him the tools necessary to be successful. As for my food well the steak and broccoli were decent however my mashed potatoes tasted like glue when I brought it to his attention he did bring over his supervisor who offered to swap them out for something. I explained to her I was raised not to waste food and ate them anyway. What I did ask is for her to go in the kitchen herself and taste them. When I did get around to ordering dessert once it was placed it took almost 15 minutes for the cheesecake to arrive at that point I asked for it to go and I even had to ask a different person about its earlier status. The manager never came out to ask me about the rest of my meal nor did I see my waiter again. When I did use the self service machine to pay for my bill and didn't get a copy of my receipt I had to ask several people just for a copy of it which again took way to long. Also had to endure watching the table next to me experience the same issues but magnified because they had a large party. I would hope this is just an isolated incident at one location and maybe I will try again at the location near my home.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2?start=20

Rasheed Z.,"Murrieta, CA",7,4,,3.0,10/27/2017,"Goodbye to our favorite family friendly restaurant. Called in tonight in advance for reservations because I have 5 kids and need to work around their patience and bedtimes. We were told no reservations allowed for less than 8. I still proceeded and it was the worst dinner experience of my life; not because I was treated the worst, but because it made me feel like nothing.  This is my restaurant, I should expect the same whether its my husband or I, or me and my 5 kids. We couldn't get a refill, our ketchup was empty, 1 hour + seated and still only had the kids entrees out ( which were ordered with the drinks). The waitress never bothered to clear our menus, or the empty cups when I flagged for a refill, no kidding the whole time we never even got flatware. Never once did she even say how are you guys doing, she knew what she was doing. Kids finished their food and still the 3 adult entrees I ordered still never came even once I asked for a manager. I have had good experiences here in the past, but there is nothing that stings a parent harder than seeing obvious discrimination because you are at a kid table. Manager comped the kids meals but I don't think he understands...Going out to eat with 5 kids is expensive and exhausting but I did it for the experience. It is not the money, it's the fact that we are ignored and your server turned something that was supposed to be family fun into something stressful. A mom like me is your perfect table, we want in and out and yeah..some extra ketchup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2?start=20

I ordered the french dip. When I got my food I looked at it and was oh no this will be bad. The food tasted like it was on the shelf for a few months then cooked it and gave it to me. The fries seemed like they sat for a long time too. I just don't get why people keep going here. The quality of this food is and from my last visit bad! A large fail here guys.

The service has always been slow and slower at times. The bartenders are the watiresses so if they are stuck behind the bar they don't have time to tend to your table.

Ducky Q.,"Murrieta, CA",30,1,,1.0,11/9/2017,"Went here on a wednesday night. As Friday's has always tired to do, they're blasting music, attempted to create a dace floor, and carding at the door. I thought this was a chain restaurant that i can just go to the bar, be carded and enjoy mild music and some drinks. So here's my experience... I enter, no one at the door, cool, so i walk in (with a friend) straight to the bar. Only 3 barstools left that i could see, so we take two of them. We proceed to order our drinks, but after we are asked if we have wristbands. Friend and i look at one another confused, so i try to ask where to get said wristband but could not hear the lady over the obnoxious music. So after that she just continues with the well and completely ignored us like we were fucking stupid. Go back towards the host stand to see where we were supposedly to get the wrist bands.. Of course now there's two security guards, or whatever they're supposed to be called. Asked them if they're the ones providing the wristbands. Of course they were. But we told them it was funny that no one was up front when we first entered. Security didnt seem to understand and just proceeded to tell us that we have to be 21 or over to be in the bar. NO SHIT DUDE!! We just didnt know it was card at the door cause none of you were there up front to take our IDs. Anyway, we both only had one drink each and left after dealing with all that. Would have stayed for at least a few more drinks and definitely food if we felt a bit more welcomed. Peace Fridays!

Which by then was after 7 so we just barely missed happy hour because of that. So we ordered our food right away when we placed the drink orders. It took nearly 45 minutes for us to get our food! We didn't order anything crazy just a burger,quesadilla,and fish&chips. We were about to cancel our order but we had already been waiting 30 min by that point so we toughed it out. We finally get our food which was just meh & I have any dipping sauce for my fish so I asked for ranch... That was another 20 min wait just for that! I didn't get it until I got up & asked the hostess in the from if she could help me out. We were clearly not pleased with the service which the server could tell & did apologize for it.

Sara A.,"Hemet, CA",112,84,84,1.0,10/31/2015,"Mehhhhh.....stopped here to grab some munchies on 10/31/15, after doing some quick shopping. Haven't been to this location in years, actually had my first date with my hubby here so we thought why not. Place still looks good, staff was friendly and it was cool to see them dressed up for Halloween. We got the Jack Daniels sampler, hubby got the Chicken Cobb Salad and I got some clam chowder. Sampler was yummy, though plates would of been nice because it was nice and freshly hot. Clam Chowder was gross, I only took one bite and that was enough. It didn't even taste like clam chowder, it was sour and had a really odd after taste. I sent it back and got a house salad instead. Hubby's salad was OK but, usually the items in a Cobb are chopped well the Chicken was like chunks and not bite sized chunks either. We also ordered the Tennessee Whiskey Cake, which was really good. Our waitress Ashley was very nice and comped the salad, which was very nice of her, as well as taking the chowder off our ticket. That's the only other reason we gave this place a star, besides the dessert.  Pretty much will not go back, quality does not match the price at all. Basically it was $50, for a sampler, a coke, ice tea, Cobb Salad and dessert. I'm willing to pay for quality not mediocrity.

Christel L.,"Murrieta, CA",571,641,1647,1.0,10/12/2014,"After giving this T.G.I. Friday's a chance a couple of times, I was so close to giving it two stars, maybe even three because of surprisingly good service from a server who actually might have been a manager, but my most recent visit proved to me that this location may not deserve to be a dining option in Temecula.  Yes, they have endless appetizers, and yes, they have Jack Daniel's sauce (they skimp on it though), and yes, they even have really good Happy Hour drink and appetizer specials that extend through the night during football season. I'll give them that. But the service...the service here ruins the dining experience, as it would anywhere. The last time I came for Happy Hour, the bartender who served me was either in a bad mood or poorly trained in customer service. It seemed like ordering was inconveniencing him somehow, and twice he came back to tell me I had to order something else because the beer I asked for from the menu wasn't in stock at the restaurant. The food came out okay, but nothing was enticing me to stay.  Not long after I got my check, there was some kind of ruckus going on at the front of the bar near the kitchen and that bartender was yelling at another server about customers. Not just raising his voice, but shouting at her with very animated gestures while she tried to calmly take it. I'm not sure what it was about, but whatever the issue was should have been handled elsewhere and not out in the open for customers to witness. It was very unprofessional and surely made people uncomfortable. I did not stick around to see how management handled the situation, but if they can't keep employees from exhibiting this kind of behavior, then they need to restructure or not be in business.

We ordered our kids food and told the waitress, Jazmin, it's best she put their order in because once we get food in front of them they would stop being so rambunctious. After she took the boys order she came to take our order later which when she came to the table she told us our kids food was up she just needed to Deliver it. She waited until after she took our order, waited for us to get someone to bring out kids food out, and for the rest of our order to be DONE BEFORE delivering our kids food. We were so upset. Next time a mom orders their kids meals before hand... please bring it as soon as it is ready. Thank you, sincerely this momma.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2?start=100

We got here around 11:20, NOT BUSY at all. Saw a busser guy and girl just standing there talking. We waited to get seated, but after waiting about 15 minutes, I got impatient and we sat ourselves down at a table near them so they would acknowledge us. They saw us but just kept on talking. We sat there for 10 more minutes and the girl finally came up to us. She said ""Let me find you a server, I don't think we have one for these tables over here."" I said ok and she left for a while again. She got back to the table and said ""The kitchen actually closed at 11:45"" and went back to talking to that bus boy again. Lol really? All the times I've been here before, ALWAYS at this time, they've always served us and let us know, a little before 1am, that the kitchen is closing and if we needed anything else.

It is in need of a remodel. I ordered the two items off the grill special. I got the ribs and 6oz steak, with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. First of all they took 40 minutes to bring us our food. When I got my food there was so much grease on the plate that my mashed potatoes observed it all. The mashed potatoes were plain no taste no seasoning. The Mac and cheese was over cooked and soggy no seasoning. The ribs were ok but they had very little bbq sauce the steak was extremely greasy. Overall the food was mediocre definitely not worth the price. The one thing we liked were the drinks. Other than that this place needs new recipes and a remodel for sure. Oh and the drinks even though they were good, heads up they are very expensive 12.50 for a Grey goose vodka lemonade and 9 for a strawberry hurricane.

Unfortunately, this specific location does not meet the standards of other Friday's I've been to. I went to dinner twice this month at this location, and both times the service has been meh. It's very awkward to walk in and see the hostesses and bus boy talking about their personal lives, laughing, while my boyfriend and I are waiting for a table. This happened the first time we came in and when the hostess took us to our table, the table was extremely wet and sticky. We dismissed this because they must have just cleaned it. Whatever. Then it took about 15 minutes for our waitress to approach us, but she ended up being very nice so it was fine. We got the endless apps, and I always love them. However, the potato skins have gone down hill. They used to be crispy and delicious, but now I can tell they've just been frozen and microwaved! Not good. This dinner was an overall okay experience. The waitress definitely made it better. The second time we went this month was awful! We waited like 15 minutes for a table, while the bus boy was talking with a waitress, AGAIN, about his personal life. It wasn't busy because it was around 11pm and waitresses had to ASK the bus boy to clean up a table for us. He took forever that we ended up leaving and went to Yard House instead. ADVICE TO THE MANAGER: FIRE THE BUS BOY. He's the really tall guy with the black hair and beard. He SUCKS at his job, clearly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2?start=40

Russ U.,"San Jacinto, CA",342,20,20,2.0,12/28/2016,"Went here on Christmas at the request of my kids who love the endless apps.  We arrived to be told there would be a 20 min wait for a table; we had driven 45min to get here (we kinda live in the sticks) so I needed to visit the men's room.  I walked through one of the main sections in the restaurant; of the 12 tables, 7 were either empty or needed busing because the guests had left; the next section over (this would be half the restaurant) was the same-less tables occupied than empty.  I understand not having the staff to seat all your tables and avoiding bad service, but you would think that Christmas is kind of a traditionally busy day for places that are open and a well managed place would be prepared. Restroom was tossed-no need to go further there. We were seated in 15 min, so they did well there; although it took the server being ""summoned"" with the tablet on the table to bring menus.  This is where things started to go off the rails.  There was no mention of the promotion in their weird new menus, nor was there a menu on the table for the endless apps promo.  After a few minutes of waiting on her to come back (did not see her ""serving"" either, just MIA - Female manager hanging out in drink station ""observing"" and doing nothing as well; we ""summoned"" the server via the button again.  She came by and I asked about the endless app promo.  She confirmed the promo was live and promptly went into an explanation as to ""how busy"" the kitchen was (again less than half tables occupied) and that it would be more than 20 min between ""app refills""; and suggested we order something else off the menu-and pointed out that if we wanted apps we should just order them off the menu because they were half priced?  I asked if she meant every time we ordered more chicken or pizza or whatever it would be atleast 20 min and she confirmed.  I said ""welp that is what we came for, you guys seem to be having some issues, I guess we will be leaving"" and we got up and left. The whole POINT of apps in a restaurant is that they are supposed to take little effort for the kitchen to push out; and if you have a promo like this, you would think they would have someone on the app station full time to keep them rolling out.  To then suggest ordering them off the menu is a terrible suggestion if for whatever reason they are having trouble getting them out-you just backed up your already messed up line more. I hate having to post a negative review for any business, I understand the hardships of people calling off etc; but to put so much money and effort into promoting a special that you try to drive people away from, and to see a manager ""chilling"" for over 5 min while the staff was allegedly overwhelmed, perplexed me.  Usually in the restaurant industry your manager is cappable of jumping in and helping in the kitchen if they are needed; and obviously should be able to help the wait staff. I know the server probably assumed we were looking for a ""cheap"" option and were not likely to tip well but she was wrong-we wound up at our local JITB and had such a fantastic experience there we tipped the person who served us $10-I mean heck it was Christmas!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2?start=40

That being said, I came in last week and had dinner with my family and it was amazing. I think that a major issue with tgi Fridays is their promotion for endless apps (when this began is when I left). The whole idea does nothing but stress out their staff and slow down their whole production. The same side of the kitchen that makes your before dinner salad is the same side of the kitchen that sends out half of your refill apps. As a former server there I can say that the reason you are not getting your refill sodas or FaceTime with your server is most likely because they are in the kitchen desperately trying to get an eta to get food out for either your table or another one seated around you. Working at a restaurant that runs these types of promotions is a thankless job but more often than not they are doing their very best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2?start=140

We would have been better off at McDonalds than here.. I ordered steak and shrimp and mashed potatoes and my food literally tasted like rubber and no flavor. My sons pizza was just like a cheap tv dinner plate.. my son who is 5'10 for some reason was served a child's burger that was the falling apart and absolutely the cheapest version of a patty.. My husband ordered cajun pasta and it looked like a bowl of mush and shit..

Anna S.,"San Jacinto, CA",0,3,,1.0,8/19/2016,"CUSTOMERS BEWARE!!!! If you eat here you may get food poisoning or DIE!!!!! This is the absolute most horrible TJI Fridays I have ever been to!!! My husband and I took my kids there for dinner for my youngest son's 11th birthday. My 11 year old absolutely loves TJI Fridays. Our first waitress was awesome, very polite and respectfully, but when she walked away to get our drinks, another waitress walked up and told us that it was our waitress' ""make or break day"" and that if she did even one thing wrong to let this waitress know and our waitress would be fired. Which I thought was extremely unprofessional, you do not tell this information to customers, customers are there to dine. The unprofessional waitress then came back to our table and said she would be our new waitress because the other girl ""didn't pass"". Again, rude and unprofessional. Our food was brought to our table about 45 minutes later and (with the exception of my husband's) every order had something wrong. I ordered the steak and lobster, the waitress had spilled the lobster butter all over my entire plate so all of my food was covered in butter and she didn't offer to fix it. My son ordered the JD burger, the onions were raw not grilled, the Patty was dry with no flavor. My birthday boy ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp, there were absolutely no shrimp on his plate and the chicken was so dry it tasted like cardboard. I called for the server to come to our table and she completely ignored me, we then hit the call server button on our table and she walked passed us 3 times and just kept walking. The manager came by and I stopped her and told her everything. She offered to bring my son some shrimp and take 20% off our bill. When they brought my sons shrimp it was not cooked they way it was supposed to be and when he took a bite of one he said it didn't taste right and almost vomited. My husband tasted and spit it out and asked me to taste it. I tasted and spit it out... THE SHRIMP WAS ROTTEN!!!!! I then went to put a little salt on my flavorless steak and the top was not screwed on so my steak was covered in salt. We checked the pepper and the same thing. The manager remade my birthday boys entire meal but offered nothing for any of the other food. When we got our bill, she only took 20% off my sons plate and we were charged for 2 large juices when we had only received 2 small juices. So the manager said that she would take one of the juices off the bill, however she only took $2.39 off the bill when each juice we were charged $2.99. On top of all of this, the waitress never once came back to our table to check on us. Unfortunately we did not read the YELP reviews before going there... HUGE MISTAKE!!!!! Had we read the reviews, we would have seen that this TJI Fridays only had 2 stars!!!! HORRIBLE RESTAURANT, HORRIBLE REVIEWS, HORRIBLE FOOD, HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!! CUSTOMERS BEWARE!!!!

Recipe for the potato wedges has clearly changed, and it's gross. Both of our entrees were lacking flavor and not cooked well at all.  My salmon was burnt and dry. 2) Service and kitchen were painfully slow Waitress would practically RUN by is every 15 minutes, apologizing every single time. I never received a refill on my water. Our appetizer didn't come for probably 20-30 minutes.  Our dinner the same after that. 3) Prices have gone up dramatically Average entree was $20-$25, and considering the above, that is absurd.

I still hold that this has been one of the better ""chain restaurants"" we occasionally go to. Our latest trip here was just before New Years. Our food was excellent, cooked perfectly (with the exception that some of the Au Juis was spilled on the plate and over-moistened the bottom bun - but not to the point the wife sent it back) and our server (Athena) was excellent.

She brought us our drinks and our appetizer (pretzels and beer cheese sauce - with an extra side of ranch for my son). The pretzels were fresh from the kitchen and perfectly salted and buttered. Four big soft pretzels - two for me, two for my son. My son ordered the 6oz petite sirloin with a side of mashed potatoes and seasoned fries. Perfectly cooked sirloin (medium well) topped with maison butter. My son enjoyed it a lot! The mashed potatoes he devoured first though. Really hot (temperature) and tasty (according to him!) I ordered the new All American Stacked Burger! Holy moly! I've never had this item before tonight - and was immediately impressed! Two 3.6oz fresh beef patties, grilled and stacked on  leaf lettuce, sliced tomato, pickles, and 1,000 Island dressing with melty cheese and two strips of peppered bacon (We back our bacon with fresh coarse black pepper) all on a soft brioche bun! Yum! I chose a small house salad with ranch as my side. Everything was fresh and delicious! Aizza refilled our beverages promptly.

Depends how long they take to leave ... Mm .. 30 mins"" O.K. We walk into the bar area and find not one but two open booths (these were not self seating). AHEM...

She finally shows her face at our table.. We ask about the endless appetizers (WHICH is on a different menu-that they didn't even offer us until we asked for it) and she drops off the appetizer menu -DOESN'T bother to ask IF we might like a drink, and goes back to the next booth for ANOTHER 5 mins to talk about damn diapers. At this point we had enough & simply walked out. Will definitely NEVER be back. This location looks run down & we thought it was closed on first pulling up.

We were seated right away, and for a Friday night it wasn't busy at all. Our waitress was obviously having personal issues, she looked like she had been crying, and I felt for her, but we had to ask 3 times for her to bring napkins, she would take our drink cups to refill them, and not come back for 20 minutes.

My mother ordered a clam chowder for her meal  & it was literally filled ALMOST half way. When we asked about it, they said they fill it by ounce and if we wanted more we can order another one. My salad was a black ahi tuna Cobb with pomegranate vinaigrette,  the dressing and ahi was delicious, but the avocados were brown and I had asked for no blue cheese on it, and yet my salad was covered in blue cheese!

Several minutes later someone brings my food.  The fries were at best room temperature, and the slider that is described as having lettuce, tomato, cheese, pickle, and onion has no lettuce, no tomato.  When I ask the woman who brought my food, she says that they only come with lettuce and tomato if I buy 3!  What the heck?!?  So I ask her to bring me the lettuce and tomato.  I wait another 5 minutes, and someone else brings it.  Mr. Chargers jersey walks past my table several time, and doesn't refill my now very empty water one time.  I say ""excuse me"", and he keeps walking.  So finally I draw the attention of another waitress, and ask for a refill, and another slider.  She brings me the refill, and I wait for 20 minutes (literally, now I'm checking my watch), and my slider never comes, no one ever refills my water again, I must have my invisible suit on.  So I stop someone and ask for my check.  She says she'll tell Chargers jersey.  10 minutes later, he comes with my check and it has the second slider on it!  REALLY?  Of course he's already walked off, so I get out of my seat, walk over to him, and tell him that my second slider never came.  His reply ""it's going to come"".  My reply ""It's been 30 minutes.  I don't want it."".  As I leave his check in front of him, another patron of the restaurant says ""service here sucks!"".

Ribs themselves weren't the best or worst but in the middle. JD sauce was very tasty. Ginger lime slaw was okay and I really loved the Steak fries side with cheese! Overall it was a good experience.

We ordered steak and lobster with bake potato and fresh spinach. For my wife and jack Daniel's sirloin steak with Mac & cheese, and bake potato for me.  The steak and Mac & cheese were perfect the bake potato not so much. When we brought it to the attention of Amber she immediately offered to bring us another one. The first one was cold, the second one was steaming, which is just right for a bake potato.  During the meal she was always attentive to our drinks and trying to make sure we were happy.

Looked over the menu and ordered our food. It was all very much down hill from there. We ordered four small plates of food as a kind of starter and two mains. One starter came out and we didn't see the rest until about ten minuets after and no plates. When the lady finally brought the rest over they all arrived at once and with the two mains also. I ordered a steak with rice and fries. The fries seemed to have been cooked but was cold and had that texture of left over fast food. The steak was so over cooked that it was bending the folk and was also cold. The rice however was hot and cooked perfectly, So I know that it wasn't the servers fault. The rest of the food was also cold and we ordered something in a cheese sauce, I'm not even sure what it was ment to be but the sauce on top had skinned over and had to have been sitting for a good ten minuets under heat in order for it to do that. It was like popping a blister when we put a folk in it. I've sent back food about four or five times in my life and this was by far the worst. It was so bad that I cannot believe that somebody would actually have even tried to send it. I wouldn't have fed it to a dog.  Overall the service is average, the food is so bad that I was laughing at it and the kitchen staff need to raise the standards. If being under staffed is the issue and at a guess I would say it is it's still not an excuse for sending food that poor out to diners.

I explained why I was upset and he said well they ran your card already so all I can do is give u some appetizer cards you should've call me before u paid. I was very disappointed with this fridays it sucked I've never had an experience like this ever I wouldn't go back to this place ever,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2?start=220

I have been to tgi Fridays in San Diego to Las Vegas Usually it's a great place to eat. This was pretty bad. The staff was arguing amongst themselves with in ear shot of all of us dinners. When we walked in it smelled of fish. Floors were dirty and glass obviously had not been cleaned of smudges in a long time.  We were very surprised and disappointed. Save yourself a bad experience. DON'T GO THERE!!!!!! Update: so I get a call from the manager of the store which was nice. However she said she would back in contact with me and she never did.

Food had always delicious there, and it still is- yet portions have gotten much smaller over the years. And service is probably in decline as our waitress (Ashley) was very dismissive, and didn't even ask to refill my almost empty cherry coke. Every time my waitress passed by our table, she asked how we were doing but she did this as she kept walking... never did she take the time to stand in front of my table and wait for a response.

After getting our orders, we waited for 45 minutes for our food. (Okay, what happen there? If there was common sense is to why that would be understandable.) Waiter was not visible for some time. By the time we finally got our food, it was warm/cold. (Okay,  our food was done quite some time, where was the waitress?) Asked for a re-fill several times. (The waitress had knowledge that, but kept doing other things until 10 minutes later she finally refill'd my child's drinks. Now if it was busy, then it would have made sense.) Waiting for the waiter to split the bill took quite sometime too. Pretty much for our experience there, we had wait for everything. It has been years since I last came to eat TGIF.  I think I would rather continue eating else where like Red Robbin (They have given me the best service so far, and I mean best and on top of that their food as well!)

I was really looking forward to some good food and nice atmosphere. We got there we were seated waiteress Kassandra took our orders for drinks and our meal and appetizers. The appetizers were delicious as well as my finace's salad. When our food came out it was hot, BUT there someting missing from mine (i ordered the Cajun Chicken and Shrimp pasta, there was no shrimp. I told Kassandra where is the shrimp, she replied ""its in there just scarce"", my reply was no I'm moving the pasta around and replied ""look no shrimp just all chicken"", she replied again ""i just saw one!, I said no there is no shrimp. She replied ""sorry about that can I just bring you out the shrimp, ""thats fine I replied"". So I waited and waited and no shrimp I ate my food cause i didnt want it to get cold. After 15 mins she came back and said they are preparing the shrimp now. In my mind im like wtf. Then 10 mins later the manager a little woman in a tan blazer came out and said ""im sorry for the mistake sometimes the waiteress grabs the wrong plate or mixes up the order. ""Im like hmm ok!, Thinking Bs, she replied i will not charge you for my meal and will bring out another bowl. And also a free dessert ok I replied. Then we waited 6 minutes later the waiteress comes out with another bowl of pasta BUT! It was not my Cajun Chicken and Shrimp with fettuccine, it was Penne pasta no sauce with  just shrimp on it.WTF !i told her what is this, this is not my order I told her never mind you ruined my night.  Take it back. The bill was $43.00 for my fiance meal the appetizers and drinks minus the salad and dessert and my meal. ***my thing is this the waiteress should of been more focused on what she was carrying out and more agreeable with me instead of telling me yes there was shrimp and i am telling her there is none and the went back in the kitchen and told the cook to hurry up and make my shrimp and then notice that on the 2nd bowl of pasta that it was not what I ordered originally. Been going to TGIF for years never messed up my order but last night it felt they did not give a Bleep, yes the entire meal was discounted but its the service i am big on and last night service sucked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2?start=80

The only good food was the kids meal and potstickers.  This has been the worst service I have ever received at any TGI Fridays. We also had to wait over 15 minutes for our check.

Mind you, my bf and I went there at 10 pm after work and there weren't too many customers at TGIF so it didn't make any sense to us as to why service was so slow. After finally getting our drinks, we had to wait another half hour before she came back to take our order. Skip forward to when our food arrives. I ordered the JD sampler and my bf ordered the steak and salmon. Food was just terrible. Point blank. The ribs were tough, dry, and bland. The Asian chicken strips were burned. The shrimp was cold (yet it's meant to be Cajun fried shrimp??). His steak was not cooked the way he ordered (medium well but came out rare) and the salmon was just okay, no flavor to it. Neither of us actually managed to finish more than half our plates coz it was so bad. At no point during our dinner did the waitress come by to refill our drinks or take our plates away - we had to ask another staff member to bring us the check and remove the dishes. Made sure to leave as soon as possible after paying. Did not tip since we felt she did not deserve it for terrible service. My advice: don't bother dining here at all. There are much better restaurants nearby like Karl Strauss, Corner Bakery, and any other restaurants by the mall. Will definitely not be returning and I advise you don't either.

We've been to this restaurant/location before so I was shocked that the food was horrible. The hostess was super friendly and our waitress was couteous and pleasant however we waited a really long time and there was no one else in the restaurant during the time we were waiting for our food. There was one table next to us already eating. It took over 25minutes.....my son ordered a grilled cheese and his french fries were very limp and cold to the touch and his bread and cheese were barely even melted. I had the french dip and the meat was not cooked very well nor cut up it was just thrown on the bun with cold onions that were barely even cooked. I was so disappointed. Out of all the many restaurants in Temecula, I would not recommend this place to anyone..Save your money and time and pick another place.

After we ordered it took over 30 min to get our food, which had clearly been sitting under heat lamps (odd crust/film on the mashed potatoes, food dried out). The steak was well-done and dried out (supposed to be cooked medium) and the the bleu cheese burger did not have bleu cheese on it. The BBQ chicken flatbread was more like yesterdays pizza topped with chicken jerky. We ate what we could and advised the waitress of the mistakes but did not send the food back (we didn't want to wait and who knows what they would send out the second time!). The manager came out, was very nice/apologetic and discounted our bill. We had been at the restaurant an hour and a half by that point.

Daisy D.,"Hemet, CA",0,4,,1.0,11/25/2013,"WORST SERVICE EVER!!! Yesterday (11/24) I decided to go to TGI Friday to celebrate my birthday. It was big party so I called in advance to make reservations for 6 p.m. After arriving, our table was already set up so luckily we didn't have to wait at all. Our waitress (which was being trained by another waiter) took care of us. After the trainee introduced herself, the trainer came to our table and introduced himself as well and said, ""Vanessa will be taking care of you guys, if you have any questions, please feel free to ask me. I will be like a shadow overlooking her work"".   The trainee then started to take our drink orders. About 10 minutes later, we finally got our drinks; a couple of them were wrong. The trainee took the wrong drinks back and did not bring them back until about 15 minutes later. Everyone had finished their first drink, while 2 people were still left waiting on their first. After waiting nearly 20-30 minutes, the appetizers started coming out. Only half of our table got their appetizers on time.  Several entrees were starting to come out, whereas the other half of the table had not gotten their appetizers yet. After complaining and waiting another 15 minutes, the other half of the table finally got their appetizers. One half of the table that got their entrees served first had already been done with their food, as the other half of the table hadn't even received their entrees. Despite that, after asking the waiters/waiter for A1 Sauce, they had told us they ran out.  There were 15 people in our party and each one of us had at least 1 thing wrong with the drinks, appetizer, or entrees. In one case in particular, a gal asked for a well done steak, when the steak was brought out it was undercook. The waitress took the steak back and 15 minutes later brought it back out; the steak was still undercook. The side orders were wrong on nearly half of the plates, also the food was cold and the fries were cold as well as old.  The onsite manager came out and apologized for the inconvenience and offered deserts free of charge. Moments later, the waitress comes to our table to recap everything everyone ordered to generate our bills.  Shouldn't the waitress already know what we ordered? At last, after waiting nearly 40 MINUTES after asking for our tab, our bills came out. Once again more than half of these bills were incorrect!!!  We got to the restaurant around 6:15-6:20 p.m.; we got our first drinks around 6:40 p.m.; half of our appetizers around 7:30 p.m.; the other half of the other appetizers around 7:50 p.m.; half of our entrees around 7:50 p.m.; the other half of the entrees around 8:20 p.m. and our bill around 9:30 p.m. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!! The only person that truly helped us out was the bartender (Amy). Why she helped us out, I don't know. Not even the trainee's trainer came out to apologize. I do not blame the trainee, but I do blame the trainer, he should have done his job by overlooking at the trainee's work or taken responsibility for her mistakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2?start=240

The manager on duty and the busser came by and got our orders, took our plates, etc. Never saw the bartender again (til he dropped off checks).

Lori G.,"Las Vegas, NV",130,16,,4.0,10/5/2013,"So this review is for TWO visits.  The first was on September 24 at 1:30pm.  Hubby and I were going to DMV (yuck!) and felt like we needed a good meal to build up our stamina for what we knew would be an interminable wait.  This was a Tuesday afternoon and, as we suspected, it was pretty quiet.  We stood for about 5 minutes while the manager talked on his cell phone.  A male waiter walked past us twice without greeting.  Finally the manager got off the phone and said, ""Hello.  Let me get the hostess.""  Finally a young lady str-o-o-o-olled over and asked if we wanted to be seated in the bar.  We said no thank you, we would like a table or booth.  Without even looking, she informed us that it would be at least a 10 to 15 minute wait (on top of the now 10 minutes that we had been standing there.)  We said thanks but no thanks and left. But, because I LOVE Jack Daniels glaze on steak, I convinced my husband to try it again yesterday.  Once again we arrived around 1:30pm and, again, the hostess was MIA, but eventually (about 5 minutes this time) she arrived and offered us a table.  Once seated (she seated us without eating utensils), Brittany, our server, was right there.  We started off the meal with chips and salsa, gave our order and started a REALLY ENJOYABLE dining experience.  Hubby got the Bruschetta Chicken dinner (a favorite of his) and I ordered the Jack Daniels flat iron steak.  His meal was perfect (he ate every mouthful.)  Unfortunately, my side of broccoli was cold (cold enough that butter wouldn't melt), but the baked potato and steak was AWESOME!  I ordered the steak medium rare and it was spot on!  Everything was delivered fast and Brittany, our server, attended to us without being too attentive.  It was a really good meal and a nearly perfect restaurant visit.  So now we will visit again and report if the first visit was an anomaly or if the second visit was just luck!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-temecula-2?start=240
