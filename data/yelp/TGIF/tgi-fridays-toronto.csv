Stefanie L.,"Dallas, TX",2445,953,1686,3.0,9/16/2013,"This is an average restaurant. More on the low end of a TGI Fridays. If you're in a hurry to catch a flight, this probably isn't the best place for you. Its not huge and its very limited on wait staff so you do have to wait a bit sometimes. I've had the same waiter the three times I've been here and he's always very nice. The food is average. I could probably make better at home, but its decent for on the go. The one thing they will tell you is there's no substitutions. If you order a sandwich and want to sub fries for a salad you cant. You have to purchase a side salad. Ok no big deal. But when I requested the fries not be put on my plate they said they cant do that. You cant not put them on my plate?? I don't quite understand this logic of food selling. I don't want the fries, so just don't put them on my plate please. Nope, they come with the plate no matter what.  Overall this is an ok place to eat. I've definitely been to better places in airports, but Pearson airport is pretty limited so this isn't a horrible place to stop in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toronto
Bill T.,"New York, NY",1219,2039,6669,3.0,4/23/2013,"When your options are limited, as they are in the US section of Terminal 3, TGI Friday's is a like an oasis in the middle of the desert. There are not a lot of eating options near the ""A"" gates and since my first flight got can celled and my second was delayed, I had time to kill. Plus I was hungry and this was about my only option. The server was very nice, although a little chatty.  I'm not looking to be anybody's best friend, I just want my meal.  She sold me on the large margarita which was weak (and at $14.99, more expensive than my food!).   My bacon cheeseburger (with American-style bacon, even though I was totally still in Canada..what a ripoff!) was over-cooked but still pretty tasty.  Fries were good. All in all, it wasn't awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toronto
Maria S.,"Atlanta, GA",269,538,1271,3.0,12/12/2012,"Small and cramped, but prices aren't too bad for airport fare. Grab an open seat at the bar, find a place to stow your luggage, and the bartenders will take excellent care of you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toronto
James R.,"Norfolk, VA",188,212,1100,2.0,5/4/2013,"If you are looking for breakfast past customs and security, there are two options it seems...and Friday's is the only one that has waiter service.  Since I was lugging along carry on bags, I really wasn't in the mood to try and balance a tray of breakfast food as well, especially at this rude hour.  So Friday's it was. The food here, well, you know.  Friday's.  The breakfast options are somewhat limited, I had the breakfast wrap with hash browns and fresh fruit.  It was filling, the portion was large.  But nothing special. From previous experiences here, I know that the service can sometimes be spotty, so if you are in a bit of a hurry to catch your flight, make sure you flag down your server to ask for your check well ahead of departure, it sometimes takes them awhile to get back to you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toronto
Bethany M.,"Edmonton, Canada",49,260,81,2.0,7/21/2013,"Service was efficient, especially for an airport eatery, but the food was just okay. There are not enough places to eat (or should I say decent places to eat) in this airport, so this was really our only breakfast option for hot food at that time of the morning. Good service, bleh food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toronto
Scott M.,"Mississauga, Canada",2,1,,1.0,9/8/2013,"Service was friendly and efficient. Nice enough bar area. Had a hamburger that left much to be desired. If you do not want food, it's a good enough spot to park. However, only if you have not eaten would I recommend ordering something, and even then, not much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-toronto
