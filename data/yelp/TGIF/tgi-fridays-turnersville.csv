Tim P.,"West Deptford, NJ",685,356,643,3.0,9/28/2017,"I like this place.... Nothing mind-blowing going on with what's on the menu. But I like what's served and the atmosphere anyway. One of the things that caught my eye on the way in was an extremely nice bar. It gave me an idea of where I could possibly stop in for happy hour in the future. But since it was late, I took a seat inside the restaurant. Nicely decorated interior, and somewhat loud inside. But it was a nice crowd and festive type of environment.  I never had the ribs with Jack Daniel's sauce. After ordering them, I realized that I'll be ordering something else next time. The ribs and sauce could use some tweeking. Not a deal breaker since there wasn't high expectations as far as the food goes.  I'll be back because I like the atmosphere. I'll just keep my food ordering to a tapas type of minimum until I find something that I might eventually enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville
Dean B.,"Greenville, SC",5,45,3,3.0,11/1/2017,"Wed night,  if you like karaoke good,  if not bad.  World Series game 7, and it was karaoke night....bad.  Food was good.  Service at bar good.  Update..Applebee's down the street playing game with volume:) much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville
Terence B.,"Deptford Township, NJ",48,72,12,3.0,2/3/2017,"I barely ever come to this location, but since it was on the way home. I figured I would just stop here.  So, food wise. If you order the Sriracha shrimp roll, please NOTE: The Shrimp is Cold. Lesson learned, would have been nice for it to say it on the menu or ever better for the bartender to tell you. NOPE, I wasn't even asked how I was doing until like 20minutes later when I asked to see the menu again. Keep in mind, it's not busy and I was the only person sitting at the bar at this time.  So I sent it back and ordered a your call burger. No complaints on this burger. Very good, but once again, me and another gentleman at the bar and another 20mins before I was asked how everything was.  Customer service is everything. If you cannot provide a customer with a great experience, then they have no reason to come back.  In my case, I have no reason to come back to this location or recommend this location to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville
Jeffrey M.,"Gansevoort, NY",30,73,12,1.0,3/6/2017,"Just awful. Like off the chart bad. Bartender didn't know what a Malbec was even though it was on the wine list, literally the smallest piece of dried out shoe leather mahi ever and quite possibly the worst rice ever. Oh yeah and apparently broccoli looks remarkably like spinach.

Emerson I.,"Sicklerville, NJ",0,2,,2.0,10/1/2016,"I never do this and this is my first yelp review. In fact the reason I started an account was for this experience.  Got a ribeye and sent it back which I never do because it was very dry after I asked for medium well. The next one I asked for, medium, was also dry. Great service though.

Nancy N.,"Blackwood, NJ",60,489,531,2.0,8/2/2015,"TGI Friday's is the typical, chain restaurant food. Nothing too special but I did love their $5 blood orange cooler cocktail. Delicious! They have everyday drink specials. We went for their $10 Endless Apps and it's not worth it unless you're starving and can get the same dish numerous times. We got the Sriracha Chicken Potato Skins. They were okay. I actually enjoyed my $4 wedge salad more. Also, the server should've asked if we wanted another app when we were finished with the first one. Instead we had to flag her down to order, and then it took awhile... so by the time the second app came out, we were full and ready to leave. But the server we had that night was good. She was awesome and even gave us a take out box for the app we didn't finish. I'd rather go to Applebee's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville
Jadiey C.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",58,69,419,4.0,6/4/2016,"I haven't been to TGIF in a while but I'm loving the updated menu. They finally started carrying Fireball and I tried their new shot, Cinnamon Toast. It's a nice summer addition to the menu. As a non meat eater, I always had a hard time finding food on the menu for myself, boy has that changed!! They started making new seafood dishes and I was quite surprised. I tried the new Mahi Mahi Naan Sandwich and it was amazing!! Did I really just say that about a menu item at Friday's??? I guess I'll be joining them more this summer, as I have to do something with all these reward points I'm racking up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville
jay l.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",281,99,44,2.0,4/10/2015,"Cheap, salty, fat laden garbage. It was probably the worst $13 I spent on lunch in my recent career. I ordered something easy, the Cobb salad. What I got was colossal pieces of Romain lettuce drowning in blue cheese and half a boiled egg. Oh and by the way maybe a tablespoon of dressing. The guy never came to check to see how good or bad it was. Shoulda gone to Wawa.  BTW. could've lived without seeing my server scratch their head.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville
Jason L.,"Blackwood, NJ",0,12,,1.0,12/15/2016,"Seems like this place has really gone downhill the past few months. Use to come here for the consistency of the 2 weekend bartenders that apparently don't work there any more, jay and Steve. Hasn't been the same. Not that the other bartenders are bad, they're very nice and accommodating but I don't see the same servers there either and found out they they hav new management so that tells me there trying to clean house but mayb they should clean management.

Who brings out cold wings wen they only take a couple minutes to make .

Megan R.,"Berlin Township, NJ",0,24,8,1.0,7/24/2016,We just left this location and my husband remembered why we don't frequent Friday's.  It took over an hour to get our food and a half hour for my drinks.  The waiter was nice and apologetic as the kitchen was backed up which is not his fault-- but when the food finally came it was terrible-- I mean the hamburger bun was stale -- there is simply no excuse-- rice wasn't cooked and the food was just terrible-- and it took forever to get the check--,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville

Jon S.,"Camden, NJ",0,7,,4.0,3/10/2016,Been coming here for a few weeks now about once a week since my school is close by. Everytime me and my girlfriend walk in we're greeted kindly and seated wherever we want. The servers and bartenders are kind and the music is pretty good. Thursdays they have long islands are margaritas for only 3$ each! Other days long island is only 4$. I would recommend this place if you want to have a social drink or just a spot to hang out at.

Domenick F.,"Los Angeles, CA",284,79,7,4.0,11/29/2015,"I used to come here a lot with my old crew and the Jack Daniel's burger, which is delicious. Although when I came here recently, I was trying to catch up with some friends, and we were in the bar area, and there was karaoke blaring while I was trying to eat and chat. The service was subpar, and the check took forever to come, but I'll give this the benefit of the doubt, and has always been a staple for me in my hometown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville

What a mistake..The place has gone down hill..We went back last night after over a year to see if it had improved..It got worse..was there12/26/16..The bartender had the personality of a rock,he never cleaned the bar top before serving us ..He would walk past our empty drinks three times before we finally stopped him and asked for refills did that two more times..The place was dead at bout 630 pm so being busy wasnt the issue just bad service..I ordered the smokestack burger which consisted of two frozen patties and some nasty sausage looked like they played hockey with it before they served it to me it was a mess..Did not look anything like the picture on the menu,and there burgers years back before all the changes were great...We will never go back its just so lame there now ...Go to Cherry Hill fridays they're awesome..They maybe 25 mins away compared to 5 mins.

Ryan K.,"Mullica Hill, NJ",1041,150,50,2.0,10/3/2015,"Like most others have noted this location is a definite cancer to the TGIF name. Most of the servers here seem lazy, minimalistic and rude. Always on their phones and barely checking in with you. Last time I was there our server walked by my empty water and beer 4 times without asking if I wanted a refill. Only good thing is the usual all day everyday specials at TGIF. Sucks this is our closest location but it is what it is :/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville

Nicholas W.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,8,,1.0,6/17/2014,"This is the worst TGI Fridays I have ever been to. The employees are too busy gossiping and probably on their phones to attentively serve you. My brother and I are members of their Stripes member club, and were not made aware that you receive free chips and salsa with every meal before we went to a different Friday's location. The managers here are as bad as the kid employees, and they never come to the table to check if things are adequate. If, and when, they give you old food or a wrong order they give you attitude when you ask for a different plate. Finally, the staff will get angry with you if they fail to ask recognize or ask you if you will be getting separate checks, especially since it seems to be such an enormous problem for them to ring up two credit cards or use a combination of cash and credit.  Overall as a company, they offer you coupons through their rewards programs but  don't allow you to use them in conjunction with their happy hour or the deals they have on their menus, so what's the point? Although, this may be one of the many inconsistencies we find with this location as well. Like how different waiters and managers allow you to finagle menu items in ways that seem totally logical (cheaper appetizers with the more expensive entree deals instead of the more expensive appetizers) while others will tell you they don't do that.  Overall, Fridays has good food and seems like an okay business as a whole, but this location seriously disappoints and is overall rude most of the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville?start=20
Mike H.,"Brooklawn, NJ",3,18,2,1.0,12/25/2015,"Absolutely Horrible! My family and I go to TGI Fridays every year on Christmas for dinner. We usually go to the one in Cherry Hill but we were running kind of late and decided to go to the Turnersville one instead. BIG MISTAKE! The food came and my mom's mashed potatoes were cold, and my sizzling chicken and cheese skillet was so hot that it burned the cheese black and smelled like burned food. My mom asked for some hot mashed potatoes and waited about 10 mins and then someone brought an order of fries. 5 mins later someone else brought an order of steak fries (we didn't ask for neither). When the waitress brought the steak fries we told her we were waiting on mashed potatoes. They finally came when the meal was done. The manager came over to apologize and wanted to make sure all else was ok and I showed him my burned cheese and he apologized and asked if I wanted another one and I declined because our meal was over and the kids were getting rambunctious. The manager came back 5 mins later and gave me a single chicken breast to go. The waiter dropped off the check which was incorrect (charged us for extra mozzarella sticks) and nothing was taken off the bill at all. We told the waiter and he said he would take it off and be right back. We waited and waited and seen him delivering food to other tables but still didn't dropped off the check. After a bit he came back and asked if there was anything else he could do and we said ""yes, the check please?"" Had to wait another 5 mins for the check. I can say that I will never go back there again. Oh and the endless apps advertisement is a bit misleading, unlimited appetizer for $10.99, but that is PER PERSON...CRAZY",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville?start=20
Tommy J.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",6,106,8,1.0,6/5/2014,"Disappointing.  I did the pick two for the spinach flatbread and chicken fingers.  The flatbread was okay.  The chicken fingers were overcooked and chewy.  And one had a small bone!  The fries were quite greasy.  Service while friendly was good at the start.  Then we were abandoned.  And it wasn't really busy.   Recently, I also learned a friend of mine who has physical challenges received ""clueless"" staff accommodations for him and his other disabled friends.  He felt this was because the staff is overrun by young workers who lack experience.      Shame cause Fridays was one of my favorites.  This particular location looks like its sinking.  Consequently I'll never go to a Fridays anywhere again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville?start=20

John J P.,"Camden, NJ",3,10,10,1.0,6/19/2013,"It's TGI's...it is what it is.  HOWEVER, I have one serious complaint and every time I think of coming here this is the one thing that makes me change my mind.  THE TAP BEER TASTES HORRIBLE.  Their taps use cheap plastic tubing that ruins the flavor of the beer.  Try the Bud, try Stella.  How can you not know that your beer tastes like plastic?  I am not Superman, my tastes buds are not super human.  Can I seriously be the only person that can taste and smell it plastic in my beer.  Mind you, it has been this way for years (today is 6/19/2013) sometimes I forget when I come in, but I am quickly reminded after the first sip.  I don't want to call it a set up to make you buy bottles, but they have never even addressed the issue. In a nut shell, the food and service is good enough to come back for.  The draft beer is what makes me keep on driving to the next restaurant.  Sorry guys, I've been telling you for forever and I guess my complaints have never made it past the bartenders.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville?start=20
Hunny P.,"Erial, NJ",26,251,303,2.0,10/4/2014,"Wasn't horrible but wasn't great either. They have all these specials and deals but almost everything they offer is some kind of meat dish. And when I asked to substitute with something that was of equal value, the waitress was told by the manager to ""just say you're really sorry but you can't change anything"". Well that's lovely. The food was ok. Nothing amazeballs. And the mudslide I ordered was small for the price and was basically a milkshake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville?start=20

Tiffanie R.,"Runnemede, NJ",134,35,9,3.0,10/8/2011,"So... I've ben here a few times. Food was excellent, service was good. Third time here and I left my visa card. I call the next day and spoke to the manager who told me that it wasn't there. He asked where I was sitting and what time I was there. I told him, and said he would call the manager that was there last night an call me back. He did and was told that my card was in a gift card box, the manager from last night had taken the key, the only key home with him. REALLY! It's 11:30 am and he will not be back until 7:00pm. WTF!  Well now that I have to wait 8 and 1/2 hours to get my card back. I go home and wait.  My day has been screwed up by Mike the kitchen manager.  Well it's now. 7:15 pm and I'm at Fridays. Guess who isn't?..... MIKE! You have got to be kidding me!  The manager that I spoke with earlier is still here. He tells me that Mike is late and will be here in about 10 minutes. I say I'll wait. About 5 minutes later, Matt, the manager come back over to me and says, I have some bad news, he said that it's going to be an hour before he gets here. He'll bring it to my house. KYS dude! I said I'll wait. The manager that's here keeps apologizing, but that's not going to get my card back to me. I can not express my level of dissatisfaction. Matt says let me buy you and your family dinner while you wait. Smdh! So it is now 8:30pm and this guy (mike the kitchen manager) comes in and poor Matt brings my key out to me. Mike didn't even come out and apology for being late or anything. Not sure it I'll be back because this guy has showen me that he doesn't care about the customer services experience.

Christine F.,"Williamstown, NJ",0,1,,1.0,1/5/2016,"Went in today for lunch and it was a terrible experience. Our waiter Mike was extremely pleasant and good at his job. I feel bad for Mike because the rest of the staff was so awful. The other waitresses and manager were so miserable they actually made us feel uncomfortable. These women appear to hate their job and offer terrible service. My husband hit his limit when rather than say ""excuse me"" , a bitch faced waitress rolled her eyes because she had to walk around my daughter's highchair. On our way out the restaurant, the manager and 2 waitresses were obviously interrupted and annoyed by my husband walking past them. Not one of them said a single word to him, such as ""thank you"" or ""have a good day"". Nor did they moved from their spot to allow him a clear path to carry the baby past in her car seat. The youngest of the 3 women did however have a minute to glare at him and my daughter until she saw me approaching and put her head down, rather than say day good day or attempt to be polite. Complaining to management would be of little use as it seems the manager was very much a part of the miserable atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-turnersville?start=20
