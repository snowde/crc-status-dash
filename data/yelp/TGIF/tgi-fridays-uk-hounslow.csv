Miguel G.,"London, United Kingdom",101,66,5,2.0,3/17/2010,"I should have known better than to eat at an American chain in the Heathrow Airport...   Ordered the full breakfast with hashbrowns instead of pancakes. The egg over easy was over hard. Hash brown were like McD's hockey pucks. Sausage looked like a couple of petrified turds, I didn't even try them so I don't know how they tasted.  My Bloody Mary tasted like just straight tomato juice. Not like V-8, Clamato or a Mary mix. Just straight tomato juice (also tasted to be sans Vodka).  The only reason that it gets two stars instead of one is that the server was great.  He asked about the breakfast since I didn't eat a whole lot of it, and I was honest about the quality.  He came back with the bill and hadn't charged me for the breakfast.  So actually the +2 from 0 are both for the server",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-hounslow
