Julie G.,"Région de Bruxelles-Capitale, Belgium",45,297,38,4.0,6/19/2013,"TGI Fridays UK, TGI Fridays USA...Same.  Love it. It's easy going, fat and tasty. Service is good, smiley.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-newcastle-upon-tyne
Simone L.,"Newcastle, United Kingdom",9,40,23,5.0,6/27/2015,"Exceptional service, unfaultable food, and the best drinks menu you'll ever see. I had a lovely experience at TGI'S tonight and would highly recommend the mushroom bruscetta to start and purple rain cocktail to drink. Not cheap but not too expensive either. Worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-newcastle-upon-tyne
Frances B.,"Surbiton, London, United Kingdom",29,122,57,4.0,12/9/2012,"I have had some good and bad experiences at various TGI Friday's outlets over the years, but I was pleasantly surprised at this one in Newcastle.  I visited when I was with my boyfriend over the weekend. Now it was a Saturday lunchtime so it was busy, projected 20 minutes but turned out to be less than 10! The bar man was friendly enough whilst we were waiting for our food, but our waitress Amy was really lovely and friendly, you could tell she had everything under control as she was dealing with several tables.  The food was good, I LOVE the Jack Daniels shrimp, and they also have some decent beers now; we had Modela Negra and Sierra Nevada which went down well on a Saturday afternoon.  When we got on the train back to Leeds my boyfriend realised he had left his beloved flat cap behind! We called them today and spoke to a girl called Faye, and she kindly offered to post it back to us which was really nice.  Overall, great experience especially for a large chain, they certainly stood out from the many branches I have visited. Especially thanks Amy and Faye!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-newcastle-upon-tyne
Carrie B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",7,40,,2.0,1/13/2009,"Yes, I've traveled across the ocean and eaten at... a TGIFridays.  I got a chicken salad which was nothing better than almost ok, not something that would stick in my mind, or order again.  My alcoholic girly drink must have been forgotten when they poured the alcohol in, because it was seriously lacking.  The waitress was nice, and the location is very convenient (especially if you are going to the movies upstairs).  Apparently this is also the place for parties because I think there was a kids party and another person's birthday party at the same time, but the place is large. This didn't qualify as good American food, or even good chain restaurant food.  My fellow diner did like her chicken with penne since it was a taste from home. There are many other chain restaurants available here, and I would suggest checking around before settling down here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-newcastle-upon-tyne
