Nimz P.,"Wembley, United Kingdom",88,255,29,4.0,5/9/2015,"I went here for some drinks and I can honestly say the bar-tender was great and knew how to make his cocktails. He was really experienced and knew his stuff. Started the night here and if in the area, I will come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-swansea
Craig R.,"Powys, United Kingdom",5,17,12,4.0,1/28/2010,"Had a great meal there. Real filling burgers ! And very friendly staff who sang a bday song for me.

Sarah P.,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",14,620,614,1.0,5/29/2010,"Takes an age to get to the toilet. Noway near as good as either of the Cardiff stores. I also find them very slow with your orders, and I once ended up sending back a cocktail 3 times!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-uk-swansea
