Angelyn C.,"Fairfield, CA",144,23,40,3.0,9/13/2009,"Our waitress was really nice. My friend and I were here for drinks on a Saturday night. The bar area was full but we were able to grab a seat. There wasn't a hostess at the entrance and we weren't helped right away but our waitress was so nice and bubbly that we weren't bothered anymore by the wait. Happy Hour from 4-7pm and 9pm-closing. The Strawberry Margaritas and Strawberry Long Island Iced Tea were only $3 and they were gooood. Appetizers  were $4 each.  We got the Pot Stickers which were yummy. We also got fried green beans which was also good. The Chicken Tenders were dry and not so good. Overall, not a bad experience. Will frequent the bar late at night again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vacaville
Michael M.,"San Francisco, CA",213,642,275,1.0,2/8/2009,"Now I know why there are no more Friday's around San Francisco.  Friday's has always just been alright so long as you stick to appetizers, and burgers. Service has always been just passable. But this this time, it was by far the WORST service yet, and I use the term ""service"" very loosely. It was as if we had to get our own silverware, after three requests, we finally got some. We had a rather large party, 10 people, with four children, and they stuck us in a room all by ourselves. I guess they had no incentive to serve us well, since they were kind enough to add 18% tip.  After waiting for a while, I really can't remember how long, maybe 30 minuets, we were called. They gave a reason for the delay as ""we will call you when we can find a server for you."" We should have turned right around. But the kids with us like Friday's, and we've had a good experience there before, so we stuck it out.  Anyway, most people were not happy with their food. My friends steak was cooked beyond well done, when she asked for it medium rare. Her soup was barely edible because it was too salty. The kids seemed happy with their pizza and sliders. Somebody ordered the Pecan Salmon, and said it tasted fresh. The pasta that somebody else ordered was reportedly OK too, as was the chicken sandwich, and another chicken dish.  All in all, due to the horrible service, I will not come back. It's too bad there's not much options for family type restaurants in Vacaville, with the exception of Applebee's, BJ's and a few other chains.  Next time, I think we will eat at Fenton's ... at least they had great ice cream!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vacaville
MaryGrace V.,"Pittsburg, CA",137,200,164,3.0,1/16/2009,"I usually try to avoid eating at All-American places like these only cuz I pretty much expect the same type of fast food with a so-so quality meal that cost way more than it should be.  But whatever, kinda had no choice since I wasn't the one that picked it. We ordered the Parmesan crusted Sicilian Quesadillas for like $10 as an appetizer.  It was pretty good, must admit especially with the balsamic glaze.  Then I ordered the Honey Pecan Salmon for around $13-15 and served with veggies and rice.  I wasn't really fond of my veggies cuz it had WAAAAAAY too many onions.  Yuck!  I hate onions with a passion!  The salmon was moist because of the honey glaze but I was expecting the pecans would be sweeter but no.  Overall, it was an okay meal.  A+ on the mashed potatoes tho!!  Yum. I think I would've preferred BJs right next door but the line is always SUPER LONG!!  Sooo EFF that, I was too hungry to wait.  My mistake.  =/ At least the service was friendly and we had that silly Tetris Game Challenge on TV to watch while we eat =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vacaville
Viri A.,"Sunnyvale, CA",18,48,12,1.0,2/23/2009,talk about racism in 2009 get over it people we live in America My family and I stopped by for lunch we sat and waited for about an hour before we got seated. Mind you that other parties had walked in and were seated right away. They all happend to be caucasian  hmmm I became suspicious so asked why the hell we were still waiting to be seated . Their excuse was that our party of 5 needed a bigger area .Bullshit I finally spoke to a manager and was seated in 5 seconds flat. We order our food and waited about an hour to get our food I was pissed. Of course I spoke to the manager again and we got a free meal out of it . FREE MEAL!!!! fuck that I was so pissed off never again will I ever go back !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vacaville
Kirsten H.,"Union City, CA",23,55,1,3.0,7/1/2009,"This is for the bar area only.  Depending on the night and whether you waitress/waiter is in the mood to help you or not greatly impacts what your experience might be. Personally come over here while waiting for a table at BJ's or wanting to get a later night snack and drink. And that is about all they are good for.  The bar area is way nicer and less cramped than other Friday's, but you might have to wait awhile for your drink. It seems that their system for serving out drinks and making them in order is pretty flawed. But I still come here sometimes for a casual night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vacaville
Derek B.,"San Francisco, CA",29,371,50,4.0,8/22/2007,"I love Nut Tree Parkway in Vacaville - it is a suburban dining heaven.  You've got Applebee's, TGI Friday's, Chevy's, Chili's, Home Town Buffet and Fresh Choice, among others.   When it comes to eating out in suburbia, TGI Friday's is among the cream of the crop.  They've got the 30 page lamented menu, the 8 page menu of overpriced and way-too-colorful alcoholic beverages and of course they've got appetizers including, but not limited to, spinach artichoke dip, buffalo wings and fried mozzarella.  And if that weren't enough they've got the appetizer platter with one serving of each! I had some sort of cheesy shrimp chicken concoction and it was absolutely delicious. Others had shrimp, a burger and sirloin, all of which was equally as enjoyable.   I don't know why these kinds of places make me so happy... perhaps its my youth in the Midwest... where these kinds of places were really where you went when you went ""out"" to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vacaville
Aliza M.,"Santa Clara, CA",78,47,,3.0,6/20/2007,"I've got to say, on my birthday, my fiance' and I experienced the worst service ever here.  The server had messy hair, and again, she seemed like she was forced to service us.  When we got our food, my fiance' had his steak over cooked, he didn't receive his baked potato when we got our order,  my order came with THREE pieces of shrimp, when there were supposed to be more, she forgot my dipping sauce, and my drink.  When we asked her what was going on, she didn't say anything, slammed our stuff down on the table, and after I received my drink (1 hour later), we never saw her again.  She sucks.   Ever since then, I went back a few months later, food and service was great after that.  Try the crispy fried green beans and fried macaroni and cheese balls for appetizers.  They are so good!   My recommendation for this place, try not to go here on a friday or saturday night, it is just overly packed, and expect an hour wait for a table for two.  But I do, now, recommend this place.  It's pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vacaville
Armstrong B.,"Hayward, CA",45,176,29,4.0,12/7/2007,"This is the first TGIF I've been to that stayed open late. Sun-Thu they're open until 1 AM. Friday and Saturday is extended to 2 AM. The water is horrible here. It has to do with the filters. Our waiter was in agreement with us on the water and on the mango iced tea which has artificial sweeteners like splenda. Avoid the new mini desserts. They're a variety of different ""fudge"" and you're better off ordering one of their regular desserts. I usually order the Sizzling Chicken and Cheese and Mozzarella Sticks. The chicken is covered in a garlic type sauce and it doesn't have the dry flavor you typically associate chicken with. The Mozzarella sticks make the perfect appetizer. When they advertise their 3 course deal, it is a deal and you should definitely give them a visit to get the most for your money. Update: The water tastes normal now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vacaville
Dante H.,"Red Bank, NJ",0,35,,1.0,6/3/2008,"I like Friday's, but not this location.  Two bad experiences and I'm done with them. First time, my food came out and it was not what I ordered, then when they finally gave me the correct dish, it was just awful.  They were very very apologetic and nice, so I decided to give them a second chance. Second trip, we waited something like 45 minutes between when we got our drinks and when someone came back.  Mind you, the place was nearly empty.  I was literally about to put a couple bucks on the table and walk out when they brought our food.  As it turns out, I wish we *had* walked out.  My stomach didn't feel right for a couple days after that. If I feel like Fridays I'll drive past this one and make the trip to Sacramento.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vacaville

Martha T.,"Fairfield, CA",24,60,43,1.0,2/7/2009,"CRAP, CRAP, i wouldn't put a star for this place but i had too. The service was crap and it wasn't even busy had to tell the waitress when we were ready for refills couldn't even put a flippin orange in my drink like i had asked! had to ask her twice for the bill this was the worst experience i had ever had i will never go back their again! Sucked BAD!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vacaville
Phillip D.,"Fairfield, CA",1,10,,3.0,12/3/2008,"I had the Chicken & Sausage Penne. The pasta seemed a little over done, but otherwise it was a tasty dish. The service was prompt but I found the crowd very loud in there, but I guess that's the norm, like at BJ's. It's like eating in a school cafeteria its that loud. But on the other hand I was dining on my own so if I had company and was engrossed in conversation I probably wouldn't have noticed the decibel level of the crowd. I've only eaten at TGI Friday's a few times, and this time was on par with previous experiences; I would go again (with somebody) but probably not be a regular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vacaville
Christopher C.,"Solano, CA",285,111,23,2.0,1/26/2009,"I am a big fan of the TGI Fridays brand but this location leaves much to be desired. I have eaten there twice, once in the restaurant and once for take out. Both times the service was sub-par. I might have just had bad luck but it left an impression. Slow and not every personable. I am not wanting over the top super excitable servers but having a personality more than a brick wall would be nice. The food while dining in was good but take out was not. The food was cold, fries were soggy and the portions we smaller than I would have got if I ate there. I will go there if I need a Jack Daniels grill fix but its not my first choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vacaville
Petra S.,"San Francisco, CA",552,1120,519,4.0,10/18/2007,"I think TGIF is overall a pretty decent food chain. They do have quite a few options for those of us who are trying to eat healthier with smaller portion and low fat entries. My hubby and I were thinking of places to eat tonight when we decided to check out the TGIF site and saw that they had brought back the 3 course dinner menu for $12.99 so of course we had to go. When we got there fortunately we were seated right away. Our waiter was pretty polite but when we brought us the drinks (we just ordered water BTW) it tasted really bad and when we asked he told us they had a really bad filtering system so the water tasted like really bad tap. Fortunately, he was nice enough to bring us to soda's on him. My hubby got the usual sizzling chicken and cheese with cheddar mash for a course, the loaded potato skins and those new little tiny desserts (horrible please stay away from those as they literally taste and look like they just took icing out of a container and plopped it into tiny shot glasses. Unfortunately I had the same dessert only my entry was the smoke house salmon with rice and their mozzarella sticks for an appetizer. All in all the food was good (though they did forget to put the bell and green peppers on my husbands chicken dish) and the waiter tried hard to make up for the water so we decided to give him a nice tip. I wouldn't say this was the best location we have tried, but they definitely stay open the longest till about 2am some nights and others till at least 1am and to date I don't know of any other locations that stay open that late. But this would have to be my favorite chain type place to eat out when in the mood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vacaville
Anna H.,"West Covina, CA",41,174,,2.0,4/30/2008,Why is this place getting good reviews while BJ's is getting slammed?!  The food here is average and kinda of expensive AND you don't even get a lot.  Their sizzling cheese chicken shrimp thing is good though I would recommend that but don't expect to get full if you're a big eater.  The Oreo cake is good also but the service sucks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vacaville
Forest S.,"San Francisco, CA",39,122,4,1.0,5/6/2008,"I've eaten at TGIF for years, but this was the most ridiculous experience to date. The wait was average (45min - 1 hour).  Our table did not have utensils when we were seated and every dish took an eternity to arrive. Some appetizers turned into finger foods and they expected me to eat my steak with my bare hands. We asked for utensil 5 times and were told by our waiter that they ran out of utensils. How is that possible for such a huge franchise restaurant? Why don't they just tell us something more believable like ""2 people called in sick tonight and we don't have enough people to wash the utensils""?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vacaville
Ercel C.,"San Francisco, CA",2,3,,1.0,2/9/2009,"Went to Friday's on Sat. and I was very disappointed at the service. The food was alright, but the service was really bad.  No plans to ever eat there ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vacaville
stan v.,"Mill Valley, CA",41,42,8,2.0,3/13/2009,"I used to eat at T.G.I.F  in San Francisco & in San Bruno, always enjoyed the experience and food, especially the Jack Daniels items. I have eaten at the TGIF's in Vacaville 3 times. This place must be owned by someone on the other side of the planet. The food and service is beyond lousy. The last time I was there I ordered the Baby Back Ribs with Mashed Potatoes, it was in the mid afternoon and the place was empty, we received our order with in just a few minutes of placing it. Certainly, not enough time to cook ribs! My ribs were Micro waved hot and totally dried out, but my real pet peave was the mashed potatoes, they are powdered potatoes. When you pay $20. bucks for ribs at LEAST give someone real potatoes! I asked the waitress if they were real, she said Oh Yes, they are real potatoes! I said, I am a chef and these are NOT real potatoes, I said you ask your Chef if they are real, she came back to the table and apologized and said that I was right, they are not ""fresh potatoes, but reconstituted REAL potatoes"", yea, powdered potatoes! This place is a major disappointment! I will not go back there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-vacaville
