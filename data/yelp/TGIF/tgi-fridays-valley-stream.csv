Amina W.,"Jamaica, NY",0,3,1,2.0,12/24/2016,Food was decent...it's Christmas Eve and not crowded. My son and I were waiting almost 5 minutes to be attended to by the host as he was in a telephone call. Was a very awkward wait. But the reason I came in here was to complain about the bathroom...gross. I went to the bathroom to reapply my lipstick but was so grossed out at doing so around the conditions of that sink.

Tee G.,"Brooklyn, NY",58,17,,5.0,3/25/2017,"Everytime we come to this TGIF the service is mediocre at best, so much so that I would rather drive to another Friday's further away.  Today, I was in the mall with my kids and they wanted Fridays. Reluctantly I gave in and went to this location.  It took a while to be seated, but once we were our server Cassandra was on point. She was extremely attentive and courteous, the epitome of customer service.  Our food was hot, the drinks were cold, and the wait to eat once we placed our order was minimal. Everyone in my party was happy.   The service was so good I had to thank Cassandra and tell her on the way out that this was the vest experience I have had in this restaurant EVER!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream?start=20

My aunt and I felt completely ignored by our waitress and we watched her visit every table multiple times while she decided to visit us ever 20 minutes.

After all that time One waitress came up to us and goes there's no waiter for your table but I'll take your order... when I asked for a manager not only did that take another 15 mins but the manager on staff informed up that because he just got into work he would not be able to help us! As if it wasn't bad enough we just wasted 35 mins of our time a manager decides he doesn't want to help a customer at his location !!! Like wow!!! How did this guy even get this position!! The attitude of the staff and that manager of that location is atrocious!!! I will never return to this location!!! They need to have extreme training done at that location ! I am a manager myself and once I walk in the store of my job I am instantly about the company I work for and the customers who shop there !

Marissa M.,"JAMAICA, NY",519,438,1152,4.0,3/17/2016,"I'll preface this by saying I don't like chain restaurants and I don't like TGIF Fridays but I like this location. I've been here previously when they were newly renovated and had a good cocktail. The staff here have gotten a lot better with customer service and the menu has improved.  I really dread coming to this mall closer to the end of the week. Crowds by the masses flock to dine at the nearby family chain restaurants and that's not really my flavor. It was Thursday.  Groceries were low and I was much too tired to cook and didn't meal prep so my girlfriend wanted to grab dinner with the kids. She promised that T.G.I.F had cleaned up their act and the menu had new pages and she was right.  It took us at least 20 minutes to decide on our dinner entrees. The new 427 menu features small portion entrees for small prices. It featured my favorite T.G.I.F app the notorious Green Bean Fries for $4. Battered fried Green Beans with a Wasabi dipping sauce. My favorite for years. I have been watching my calories and dieting so nothing on the menu suited my interests except salad. However, as I was studying the Grill section of the menu the Chicken and Spinach dish caught my eye. Served in a Iron skillet with Miso oriental soy sauce, onions, Yellow Squash, mushrooms (which the cook forgot), sautéed spinach and grilled chicken breast topped with Sesame seeds. A delicious cherry tomato and mozzarella salad is served tossed in Balsamic vinegar. This dish was.....a party on my palette. VERY FILLING. All at 440 Calories.   I highly recommend this item. I topped off my dinner with the half size Brownie Obsession. Vanilla icecream, walnut topped brownie. Warmed accurately and the combination of the cold vanilla ice cream was heavenly.  Perfect portion control for $4.  The bar is great and now that the food is good, I will be back. Our server was a sweetheart and the manager Issac made rounds to every table. I most definitely will come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream?start=20

Shaden B.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,2,,1.0,6/29/2017,Went here against my will. (Hubby was driving & understandably did not want to go far from our neighborhood) It's a Thurs night. The waiter was surprisingly curtious but once again it went downhill from there! It took FOREVER for us to receive our food and almost everything was wrong.

Ricky J.,"Cambria Heights, Queens, NY",0,2,,1.0,7/30/2017,"Management needs to take stock of what is being written in regard to the shortcomings of this establishment. What would have been a very pleasant meal turned out to be filled with anxiety, and questionable service. Myself and eight family members went to this establishment to have dinner, and we were seated appropriately. No sooner then we started to order our meals a commotion broke out latent with profanity throw back-and-forth between two patrons. 10 to 15 minutes later a bunch of young kids showed up looking to carry over that situation, but fortunately one of the combatants had left the establishment. Thereby averting further conflict. That left the feeling of a lack of security, which might have been sured up by providing more security at the door. But that wasn't the worst that can be said for this night out on the town. After we ordered nine plates of food eight came without utensils. It took approximately 10 to 12 minutes before knives and spoons were provided. I did mention we ordered nine meals and didn't receive the missing meal until the very end. So there were eight of us eating expecting that the last meal would arrive any minute now. To our dismay the order wasn't filled. After some haggling over rather are not the final meal should be on the house due to the order not being filled, The establishment gave us the order free of charge in an attempt to right a wrong. That was redemptive to some degree, but the whole fiasco has discourage myself and family members from dining at this establishment in the future. We were also bothered by the fact that the music blaring so loud conversations were impossible to have, which ruined the social side of our dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream?start=20

The glasses were so dirty, and got much more dirty as the night went along. My girlfriend and I won't be going back there anymore, and it's a shame because we were coming out for a few drinks and thought that it would be fun but not at the expense of dirty glasses.

It was super packed so we opted  for the bar. It was uncleaned and they were clearly backed up. The bartenders took 17 mins to clean the bar before they even acknowledged us.  We placed our orders and the drinks came 10 mins later. We had the Barbados Rum Punch and it was underwhelming. Had absolutely no kick. Sitting there waiting to place our food order was the real show. First we witnessed one of the bartenders wipe her hands in her pants after itching her hair and then she grabbed chunks of pineapples for garnishing drinks. Yuck!  Then the other was constantly cursing at eveyone in her sight. It was super uncomfortable. The whole vibe was wrong. Idk about you but when I sit at a bar, it's for a good time.

You would've thought I learned from the first fight I watched between the staff members. However, I let it go. Then tonight, we were welcomed with another loud argument between the staff. Next, we were seated and a waiter said he'd take our order in a second. That second turned into ten minutes. Still, no waiter or no acknowledgment. We were then told that the waiter had ended his shift. We asked another waiter to take our order. This waiter also stated that his shift was over , but was kind enough to give us cups of water. Finally, a a third waiter (who also ended his shift )stepped up for the team took our order. We appreciate that he did this.  Management is terrible. There is no professionalism.

I ordered the sizzling chicken and shrimp, which it came with a side of mashed potatoes. I got ready to eat my food and opened up the silverware and noticed that my fork was dirty. It took about 5 minutes for me to flag down a waiter to change my silverware. I started eating my mashed potatoes, which was good, but noticed that my chicken was not done as I took a bite. At this point I was so irked. The waiter came around to see if everything was OK and I kindly told him that my chicken was undercooked and cut a piece so that he can see the pinkness inside. He was very nice and asked if I wanted something different. I ordered something else but took it to go. I was no longer hungry.

When the customer  talked to the manager she said what do u want me to do about it.....And ofcourse with all that arguing they messed up MY drink order because ofcourse they gave me a Daquiri instead of a Margarita.

Stacy M.,"Rockville Centre, NY",7,26,36,1.0,8/28/2015,"Service here sucks. The absolute worst at this location. I'm not an avid yelp reviewer nor would I usually care to write a review for a chained restaurant but this place deserved one (a bad one at that).  Started when I went inside - saw a hostess, waiter and I assume a bus boy waiting in front where customers are usually greeted. I said hello then asked for a table/booth for my family and I. Got a weird look from them, where they basically ignored me for a few seconds and proceeded to have a conversation within themselves... and then they finally decided to seat us. Okay.  Sat down at our booth for almost 10 minutes and our waiter finally came. He greeted us, told us about some specials and then said ""ill come back in a few minutes so you can take a look at the menu and put in everything. Drinks, apps, food, etc."" - ?.... Most waiters would usually at least ask what we wanted to drink ASAP but whatever, we told him we knew what we wanted for drinks and apps right then and there. This wasn't a big deal but anyways ... So he comes back, gives us our drinks, walks away and I thought he went to go get my drink but he didn't come back. I saw him taking other customers orders.. That's fine. I sipped on water at the table. When he did finally came back (maybe 10 min later) I told him he forgot my iced tea and he tried to play it off by saying ""oh yeah, the bartenders making it"". what? The bartender making ICED TEA? even if that were true, why did it take so long for it come? *rolls eyes* Continuing ... so apps come and we realize there are no plates. We told our waiter and his reply was ""oh yeah, no problem, those are coming right up"". He clearly didn't care about us because we saw him serving other ppl right after he said that. How long would it have taken for you to grab plates?? By time he did finally come back with those WET plates, the apps were already done. Smh. When the food finally comes, he gives everyone at the table their food except for my sister when he then proceeds to tell her ""oh my fault, I should've known this but we don't have what you ordered. Is there anything else you want?"" What the. You tell her this AFTER you bring out everyone else's food?? Smh.  I feel as though I could go on and on about our horrible experience here but I'll just end this review by saying - go somewhere else.

Too much salt added in our food. The entrees arrived before the appetizers. We also had to ask for eating utensils which should honestly be given before the food arrives. Half of my food came out ... I had to point too many mis haps. In my opinion it felt like we came to a night club. On a Tuesday night the music was blaring and patrons were dancing and twerking by the bar area along with the staff, not very professional at all. Bathroom was a mess and dirty. Word of the wise to management... Maybe they should lower the music a bit and pay more attention to serving the customers and keeping a clean restroom rather than turning up at the bar.

First thing waitress begins to have an attitude. We get our appetizers no napkins ( we asked guess what still no napkins) we put our empty glasses to side cuz at any other tgifridays they see it empty they either ask if you want another refill or just automatically take glass and refill it.

Tells us he doesn't know if the situation is how we said it. Then tells us there is nothing he can do. Basically sits there like oh well ( first off I'm going be straight up a manager should never be rude to a customer who 1. Not coming at you rude, hostile or disrespectful) they refused to split bill basically it was our fault for not reading the fine print even though we asked waitress about the endless apps ( again manager basically said that he doesn't know if that was true didn't even ask waitress if that was true and basically was like oh well) w",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream?start=100

Be prepared for a little bit of a wait. This location is generally always crowded especially on evenings and weekends.  The service at the front is pretty hit or miss. Sometimes I'll come and a hostess will greet me and other times I have to get their attention. Either way make sure you get your name on that list or you'll definitely be skipped. The actual service is always exceptional at this location. The servers are all young, and friendly, and don't mind striking up conversation. The food is exactly what you'd expect.

Ashley G.,"East Stroudsburg, PA",4,3,38,1.0,7/17/2015,"Even if you want a quick meal, DON'T EVEN BOTHER!  I visited this TGIF after a long day of shopping with my extended family only to receive the worst service in my entire life. Our ""waitress"" JORDAN had to be the worst waitress ever in the history of food services because if there was a competition to see who can be the snottiest and most inattentive to paying customers on purpose; she succeeded!  We arrived. We were seated within 20 minutes. We knew what we wanted. We asked her (Jordan) to please call our waitress because we were ready to order, she says ""it's me, I'll be back"". (STRIKE 1) She comes back in 5 minutes and says while rolling her eyes and in a hasty annoyed tone,  ""I'm Jordan, I'm your waitress, what y'all want to order?"" (Strike 2) We placed our order and at the end I requested a water. Remember this. Our appetizers took FOREVER to come out, and what do you know when they did come out our food was COLD! ( Strike 3) At this point we just started to feel like this girl had a personal agenda for us. She was attentive to everyone else but us.  (Strike 4) At this point she didn't even bother to bring our food to us anymore. We had 4 different people tending to our table. (Strike 5) Remember the water I asked for? Never got it. (Strike 6) Time elapsed, by this point we felt like we were forcing ourselves to eat the appetizers, then our food came. It looked as if they just did a whatever job and it was poorly made. My friend ordered her steak medium rare, she could barely cut through it. Just terrible. (Strike 6) You know how after you get your food, your server is to walk over and ask if you need anything or if everything is okay ? Yeah, NO, not with Jordan as your waitress. Oh wait, remember the infamous water? Yeah, No, still never got it. (Strike 7)  After prolonged disgusting service, we finally called for Lisa; the manager, and had to report the absence of hospitality and customer service in there. She was very apologetic and tried to better the situation. She was someone that did make the situation a little better just by her aura and personality. I'm guessing she spoke to Jordan, and then after that Jordan comes storming over and says to me "" YOU NEED A WATER still?"" Seriously?! I was just TOO THROUGH.  My whole thing is we all have personal issues and most of us are fed up with our jobs, but don't bring your personal issues to work and take it out on others. We ARE paying customers and depending on service GREAT tippers too. I am one that is always willing to pay anyone for a service done for me and for her to treat us that way was very distasteful. I will never go to a TGIFridays again because of this experience. I am so turned off.  Again, this was my worst experience ever. Save your time and money and go elsewhere.

Lorana P.,"SOUTH OZONE PARK, NY",37,22,2,5.0,8/27/2015,My boyfriend and I came here today. The person who seated us didn't look very enthusiastic to be working. He shouldn't be greeting people at the door. Our waiter was the best waiter I had there in such a long time. Ronni was so helpful with the menu because we wanted to try the wings. We did the endless appetizer we got mozzarella sticks and Memphis bbq wings and the siracha wings. The Memphis wings were more on the sweet side and the siracha wings were more on the spicy side. They were delicious. She was so attentive and so sweet. She didn't act as if she was better than anyone and honestly that's what a restaurant needs.

It wasn't a problem dealing with the over crowd or understaff, the customer service ducked big time. We had ordered the unlimited appetizers. We ordered the first set and that was fine, everything after was a disaster. When it was time to order the second set we made our order. We maybe waited about 20 mins. My sister's dish came and I'm still waiting on mines. I'm still waiting about 45 mins to 1 hr. I kept on telling my waiter and as much as it seems like I was pissing him off it was pissing me off. Then the guy who was mopping the floors accidently threw down the mop bucket with all the bleach and chemicals and it's all over. Finally when I couldn't take it no more. I ask to speak to the manager. I spoke to him. He was kind and apologized and asked me what I had ordered and what I wanted next. Well as you can imagine that took a while as well. And when the dishes do arrive guess what, they all came at the same time.... about 9 dishes. Smfh.... and the second manager will have the nerve to tell us we can't take home, it's to eat here.... are you f**king kidding me. We waited a year for the take out containers and still waited a year for the last two dishes.

Steak was decent, I wasn't expecting Peter Luger's quality. Drink was weak, felt like it was more juice than alcohol. As far as service goes, well I'm not sure where to begin. Sat down for about 15-20 mins before our server even addressed our presence. Then when she did it was with a disdain as if we were there begging for free food. Barely told us her name, and took our orders as if we were soliciting organ donations. The waitstaff seemed more interested in socializing with each other than with deal with the patrons.

First let me start off by saying that was the worse decision that we made that day. To begin with it the management in the store is lacking basic leadership skills, the employees are walking around aimlessly and chatting with each other instead of bringing out the orders to the consumers. Nevertheless me and my brother sat at the bar for about 15-20 minutes before we were even acknowledged. To top it off the bartender took about another 15 minutes to bring our drinks,he did not know where anything was and on top of that gave us attitude when we were departing this facility. I called over the manager to address the issue and he did that but was talking under his breathe.

Victoria A.,"Bronx, NY",9,7,,1.0,10/13/2015,"On Monday October 12th, my family and I arrived as a party of 8, and upon arrival I was informed by the host that the wait would be 15 minutes. After waiting 25 minutes, I asked the host how many parties were ahead of us, as we had already waited 10 minutes over our wait time, and there were many empty tables available. I was told that we had 1 party ahead of us. I then witnessed 5 other parties called for their tables. Over 30 minutes had gone by and we were still waiting. When I inquired as to why the wait was taking so long, I was basically told that servers were making it difficult to seat tables. When I pointed to empty tables and asked why we could not be seated at them, I was told that the server for that particular area could not have any more parties seated in their section. After about 35 minutes, we were finally seated at a table.  Once seated, we waited for about 10 minutes. I got up and approached the manager asking her why we had not been seen by a server yet, and she said she would send him right over. Once the server arrived, I asked for children's menus, as we had 2 small children in our party. I was told that the restaurant had run out of menus. I asked the server to run down the list of children's menu items since there were no children's menus. Once we put in our orders with the server, about 10 minutes later we received about half of our beverages. I had to request the rest of them, as it appeared they were forgotten about. When ordering our entrees, 3 people in our party ordered the Jack Daniels Sampler, and we were told that the restaurant had run out of shrimp. When we asked if they could accommodate by adding extra baby back ribs to the order, we were told by the manager that additional ribs would be a $7 up charge, however she would only charge $2. I thought it was ridiculous to charge anything, as they were not able to accommodate for the items that come with the order. 3 people in our party ordered the 10 oz steak, which we were told the restaurant had run out of, so they had to get the Flat Iron stead instead. We ordered endless appetizers (boneless buffalo wings and pot stickers). While dining, when we requested to have our order of potstickers replenished, we were told that the restaurant had run out of potstickers. One of the people in our party had ordered root beer with her meal. She informed the manager that the root beer was flat. The manager said she would check the root beer to see if it was flat and if so, bring the person in our party a ginger ale instead. We never received a replacement root beer OR ginger ale. However this was not taken off of the bill until I requested that they do so, as we'd never received it. One person in our party ordered steak fries with his flat-iron steak. They had not been cooked long enough, as the fries were cold on the inside. When we requested steak sauce for the table, we were told that the restaurant had run out of steak sauce. This was disappointing, as 3 people in our party had steak entrees.  I communicated my concerns to the manager, as overall this was a very unpleasant experience for me and my family. I was even more surprised that they restaurant had run out of so many items when it was Monday night, and the restaurant did not have very many patrons. The manager informed me that the restaurant had more patrons than expected for the weekend, and as a result they were not quite prepared. As a patron, this is not really comforting to hear. She was apologetic and did take off 20% from our total bill. In conclusion, my family and I will not likely be returning to this TGI Fridays, nor will we be recommending it to friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream?start=80

Two people at our table had nothing to drink for nearly 30 minutes. I made her aware of the missing order by Another waitress  passing by and she said she must have entered it wrong (really?).

Sonny G.,"Malba, Queens, NY",2244,415,1191,4.0,11/13/2011,"It's funny because I have been looking for this Fridays location on yelp for the longest and it never poped up until today when I ate here.  Now this is definitely my favorite Fridays by far amongst the long island/queens/city locations.  This particular Fridays might just be about a year old.  My reasoning for my 4 star rating has to do with the overall experience, service, ambiance, and drinks.   The feel of this Fridays is young and hip.  The decor is a mix of modern and old school.  The bar is a popping place to hang out at at night, and the drink specials are well worth the price.   The staff is nothing but attentive and I've never had to wait to long for anything.  I almost gave this Fridays 3 stars instead of 4, but I decided the positives outweighed the one negative thing that came to mind when composing my review.  For some reason the food can sometimes be inconsistent.  It's not that it tastes bad per say, but it's also not the greatest.  I could remember going to Fridays and being sooo satisfyed with the food, but that is not the case at this Fridays.  Now I do only eat seafood so my meals consist of either shrimp or salmon because thats what's offered.  The last time I went , which was less than a week ago, I got the shrimp basket which was just fried shrimp, and I subbed loaded mash potatoes for fries.  It tasted like a popeyes meal, only popeyes shrimp were better :( .  The fried green bean app wasn't at its better either.  Besides that, this. Fridays is awesome. I hope this place doesn't turn to shit like every new restaurant does with time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream?start=140
Tiffany L.,"Jamaica, NY",2,48,1,2.0,2/18/2015,"So the food was not awful but I've definitely had better and hotter at other Fridays. The service? As OK as our waitress was, in general I'd say the entire wait staff needs to be trained properly. Its not a 5 star restaurant but that doesn't mean you just slack off. There seems to be absolutely no management going on, and you can tell the wait staff is kind of left to police themselves. Not a good idea when you're hiring young people who could care less about their job. We went late in the evening but considering it was fairly busy they should at least keep the floors clean. There was food spilled all over and no one seemed to mine tracking the smeared food all over the restaurant. You know its bad when our waitress who seemed more concerned than others is complaining to us about how incompetent her coworkers are. (Also not professional).

First of all on Wednesdays they have a live dj now which was very annoying and the music was very disturbing and loud it seemed like I was in a club instead of a restaurant where i just wanted to have a nice peaceful meal with my girlfriend. I had no problem with the genre of music but it was too loud and caused me to feel uncomfortable and found myself yelling to talk to my girlfriend which was a couple inches away from me. Second of all the service was horrible the waiter had no idea what he was doing he had no sense of direction and seemed confused and lost. The food was good but service was shitty. I and my girlfriend did not get our drinks until the dessert had come. A simple half an hour dining experience had become a two hour headache filled with loud music and downright and horrible shitty non-attentive service.

The bacon was fatty, the blue cheese crumbles hardly existed and the chicken was cold, only got a few pieces and fatty!  I ordered the same meal a week before - at a different location --and the bacon was all meat (no fat) and finely chopped and the chicken was fresh and I had lots of it with no fatty pieces.

Ashley N.,"South Richmond Hill, NY",0,2,,1.0,9/17/2016,"Went there last night ( 09/16/16) and the service was horrible !! To begin with, waitress never introduced us her name . Waitress was obnoxiously rude.  First off, she took our order of drinks and said to us that "" we should not order cocktail drinks "", because the wait for that was '30 minutes'. So, we ordered regular cokes to drink. After being served, she never gave us any straws .... we waited 15 minutes for that.  Finally after 45 minutes of waiting to order drinks and appetizers.... our appetizers came and we had NO utensils .  Nothing to eat with, no forks, spoons, knives, or plates. My boyfriend asked her for some napkins, along with utensils and plates ; she said "" You guys have to wait , technically the table next you guys were here first so I have to serve them first, right? "" .  The waitress was very rude and had a horrible attitude. When we asked for utensils, she started to talk about how busy she was serving the other table. It just didn't made any sense. The other table next to us had nothing to do with us having utensils. No matter what, before food is served, utensils are usually always given before. It is common sense . She came back to give us plates and slammed it down on the table.  I asked a lady at the bar to speak with the manager and she said "" The manager is very busy right now "". She also had an attitude and was not very polite... I guess because I asked for their 'manager' ... Overall, I had a very horrible experience with my boyfriend and friends ,  because of the waitress attitude and lack of knowledge. Its important that TGIF trains their employees properly before putting them on the floor to serve. Customer Service is a key to success.

Still, there is enough for me to give it another try in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream?start=160

Tonette V.,"JAMAICA, NY",0,23,,4.0,1/21/2014,"One good review, one poor review.  The issue here is that everything depends on your server. Went there 3 weeks ago.  Had a wonderful server named (I think) Emirror.  She was above and beyond spectacular.  That day, I found out that as a Stripes member, I was supposed to get free chips and salsa with every visit.  As many times as I had been to this place, no one ever told me that.  She did not hover over us, but she made sure that everything we ordered was there in a timely manner, hot, refilled my coffee quickly, told us what our menu choices came with.  She was on the ball.  She did not fuss when I showed her my coupon for a free entree.  She was amazing.  Of course, I gave her a 35% tip.  Wish I had more cash on me to give her. Sadly, 2 weeks ago, I was there and had a different server because Emirror was not on duty that day.  The service was horrible.  Took 20 minutes before I even met my server, another 15 minutes before she took the drink and appetizer order.  I had to remind her about the free chips and salsa.  Took another 25 minutes before we got the appetizer and drinks.  Mine was a decaf coffee.  She wasn't sure if it was decaf or not.  Took so long for her to find out that the coffee got very cold.  When she did return, her attitude was worse.  I glanced at my watch because I had another engagement.  She looked down at me and said ""I'm very busy today.  I have this entire side.""  OK.  #1, that's not my problem.  #2, there were only 2 other tables on that side, and they had both come in after me and been served their food before me.  And #3, how dare you act as though your poor service is my concern!  The customers who had just come in overheard her comments and asked to be moved to a different server! By the time our entree was served, we had been there over an hour, and the order was not complete.  We had to ask for items piece by piece, even though they were in the original order.  The food was cold.  By the time she came with the bill, I already had my credit card and stripes card in my hand with my coat on.  She dropped the bill and walked away, mumbling under her breath something about being busy.  She did not return for 20 minutes.  I was already standing to leave.  I left her a 8% tip.  I shouldn't have left anything.  I know we all have bad days, but customers should never have to suffer at the hands of a poor server.   Bottom line, when you go to TGIF, if your service is poor, let the manager know.  The manager had stepped out before I left or he/she would have heard from me.  And don't be afraid to ask to be moved to a better table.  Some of the servers are superb and some are horrible. Fortunately, the food is very good and the price is decent.  When I go back, I will call ahead to make sure the server I had 3 weeks ago is there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream?start=160

Halston H.,"East Hills, NY",117,6,,1.0,1/16/2014,"Popped in for a late dinner with som friends after a 12hr work day only to receive the worst service I've ever had at a Friday's. The hostess sat on the bench and when I asked for a table she looked into the dining room without getting up and said 10mins, they just have to clear a table. After we were seated, at a wet table with crumbs in the chairs, our menus were dropped on the table and she walked away. The waiter was a breath of fresh air! He was very polite and accommodating! We ordered the drink special only to get 2 glasses with lemon juice(margaritas)and one with Sprite (Long Island Iced tea) for $3. We immediately called over the waiter who recommended the ultimates(more expensive versions). When these drinks came they were the exact same thing just bigger glasses. Following this disappointment I approached the bar and explained my issue with the Kitchen Manager who apologized and personally re-made the drinks himself! After all this I can honestly say next time I decide to go out for a quick dinner and drinks Friday's will not be on my list!

V H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,,1.0,8/11/2014,"My husband and I went there yesterday around dinner time.  Firstly, the entire area in front of the bathrooms, right behind the Maitre D stand smells like the bathroom. That should have been warning enough.  Seating for two was quick. Great. We were seated in booth 52, I think it was, in the corner.  We immediately noticed that there was a lot of garbage on the floor in the booth so I pointed it out to the young man who seated us.  As soon as we sat down, our sandals stuck to the floor and my elbows were sticking to the table. We requested that the table be cleaned and it was. I looked at my sandals and there was a paper stuck to it. Then, I started smelling something bad. The floors were sticky and stink!!!!! I told my husband that I could not eat there, but he asked me to be patient. As we were waiting for the waiter, there were workers to our left at a bar style table eating chicken wings out of a styrofoam box, which they left there after eating from it like vultures. I thought that I was on an episode of Undercover Restaurant or some other show.  Our waiter came over, and my husband noticed that he had on bluejeans while others had on all black, well most workers did. We asked him to return because we were not ready. He later returned and I listed our three items from the menu. Then he asks me to repeat it because he was not ready.  Okay, no problem.  Maybe he was new. We can work with you.  So we gave the order.  While he was gone it stench got worse so I went to the Maitre D and asked for another table.  They moved us to another area.  While there my husband began to worry that our food may get some ""special"" love since we had complained about the filth.  I tried to soothe his nerves while we waited for the appetizer.  Then, two female servers came over and asked us who was our server? What!?  I wanted to say, 'Why don't you go find out?' but I was trying to be cool so I just described the guy.  Our server brought the appetizer and my husband was so turned off at this point, as was I, so we asked the server for the check for the appetizer that we had not eaten and for the two drinks that we did not drink and told him we would pay for those and leave. He disappeared for about 5 minutes so we left. No one noticed that we left. No manager ever came out to apologize. This was the worst experience ever!  From what I could see, the majority of the staff is Black, like us, so we were happy to see that, but it was so disappointing. There were groups of servers hanging out in corners while tables were dirty. No one was really checking in on their tables and where the hell was the manager?!!! I would not be surprised if the manager was one of the individuals hanging out.  I really don't even know what to say beyond you all better get it together.  I will never return there again. Buyer beware!!!!  You have no idea who could be sitting in your restaurant. You stand to lose.  What you lost with our business I am sure did not hurt you at all, but in the long run if you this place is not put in order, you will stand to lose more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream?start=160
Peg L.,"Valley Stream, NY",0,9,,2.0,7/26/2014,"My friend and I have been coming here since they opened a few years back. The service used to be decent and we continued coming here despite them not having the same happy hour specials as other Friday's. So anyway, last Wed, we met there for the $3 martini special (they finally started having specials). We sat at the bar, which was relatively empty, and after about 20 minutes, we were finally acknowledged by the bartender. We gave her our drink orders and 15 minutes later, after she finished chatting and laughing with her co-workers, we got our drinks, half full cosmos. She handed us our drinks and walked away, no mention of taking a food order. While we were sitting there amazed at the lack of service, another bar patron was also complaining. We decided to leave after another 20 minutes passed without so much of a glance in our direction. The service here is horrible. The workers are more concerned with fraternizing  with each other than attending to the customers.

Ashleigh D.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,25,3,2.0,3/20/2014,"My husband loves this place. He is allergic to most foods and when we eat out this is usually our go to place. It's affordable, nearby and the food is usually your typical run-of-the-mill chain restaurant. He is a meat & potatoes kind of guy so he always orders the Turkey burger with french fries. But during one if our most recent visits he was in the mood for steak. Thus, he ordered the flat iron steak w/ fries. The steak they brought out was extremely small so he sent it back to the kitchen. The waitress explained that it was the cut of steak that he chose. (Little did we know) and happily spoke to her manager about a new order.  About half an hr later the manager himself brought a new steak which was a more appropriate size and he enjoyed every bit of it. I was in the mood for a burger (extremely rare) much to my surprise they were out of burger buns. Just great. What kind of burger joint runs out of burger buns!?? The waitress told me they can substitute w/ a child's bun or slice of bread instead or suggested i change my order. I chose the latter. I then ordered the pan-seared chicken hibachi w/ pita bread & vegetable melody. Had it before and it was on point. The service however was slow, we had no silverware, no burger buns & it took  20 minutes for them to bring our check. Maybe it was an off night but this is not our regular location.

It don't take long to cut the leaves off strawberries before muddling them in a drink. Had to take my fork and scoop them out. Then app came after we were half way into our entrée. The burger I ordered was barely warm and the sauce completely soaked through the bun. To the point where you squeeze it like a sponge. It was falling apart because it was so wet. Had to send it back. Couldn't even find my waiter. He checked on our table once and that was to take our order.  Had to flag down someone else. I just wanted another bun. But it took like 20 minutes. For a fucking bun.

I walked over by the Green Acre Mall and saw this Friday's, next door was their competitor. I chose Fridays. When I walked in I went straight to the bar so I could relax and watch TV while I ate. While walking to the bar, I was impressed how nice it was in there. Everything looked new, clean and nicely decorated. I sat down and the bartender greeted me and gave me a menu. A few minutes later I placed my order. Half hour later she said ""I'll go check the kitchen for your food"" she walked over to the touch screen cash register to look to see what I ordered and I'm guessing she never put my order in because she was talking to one of the bus boys that came over to me and asked what I ordered.. when he walked over his stench of B.O. Sting my nostrils as he asked me ""Excuse me sir, what was your order?.. erm.. because uhh.. I'm going to check the kitchen"". I waited another 15 minutes for my food. The food was alright for a Friday's, surprisingly not as salty as I thought it was going to be. When I paid, the bartender gave me the receipt to sign but before I could sign she grabbed the pen and walked away..  This experience wasn't a pleasant one, but it seems the reason for the bad experience was because the bartender seemed to be over her head with work.

We were turned off and went back to the host stand where we were eventually sat and waited no exaggeration 20 minutes to get acknowledged. We told the server the area we were sitting at was chilly and asked if we could move to a booth and she said it was okay and didn't even tell our new server we were there so we waited an additional 15 minutes. The host even came up to us before our new server and said ""who told you yall can sit there""? Rude much?! Anywho our server struggled the entire time with bringing our drinks from the bar, giving us share plates and proper set-ups, to clearing off or table. Our drinks were also terrible! We ordered Blue Rita's that came with a shaker that didn't even open and were so watered down I had to send them back.

The waiter took our order for drinks and we thought all was going well. Shortly afterwards we placed our order with the waiter. As we were engaging in conversation and the younger members of our group enjoyed the sports on tv, there was a loud outburst of cursing and loud talking at the bar. Security stood near bar. Shortly afterwards this turned into an argument where profanity was shouted this was allowed to go on much longer than expected especially with security standing there. Finally one of the parties involved left and shouted her way out the door. There were several minors exposed to this. As soon a she left, there was a man who stood up and started with his foul language. To drown out the noise, music was played loudly where we could no longer engage in an adult conversation, not even with the person right next to us. The music was geared towards a younger crowd. I thought it was a great idea to use the music to help calm things down. Our meals were brought to our table by two men other then our waiter. One of the men was rude and arrogant attitude as we tried to help with who ordered, he made the comment ""before I can put this down I have to put this down first"". His tone was abrupt. We received 8 meals, the waiter came over and said he would follow up. No utensils were brought to the table. Waiter came back and apologized and said they didn't prepare it and he was sorry for the delay, he assured her it would come. The remaining party requested utensils so their food wouldn't get cold since the AC was up way too high for a cool 70 degree evening that was windy. Even with sweaters we shimmered. 10 minutes later we received utensils and the waiter came over to apologize again stating her meal still wasn't ready. We all ate our meal and sat for an additional 30 minutes with several more complaints made to waiter and manager before her meal was delivered. They didn't bring her the complete meal, she still missing her coleslaw. Finally she ate dinner, she was told she wouldn't be charged for meal. However on the bill, her meal was entered twice but taken off once. She was then being told since she ate it there they had to put it on her bill. Manager came over again and told her waiter was new and this would be removed from her bill. The waiter remained humble and respectful so we still tipped him out of curiosity but not our usual 15- 20%. Also this same waiter needed a belt, he kept pulling up his pants. There should have been a dress code, droopy pants is not appropriate in a professional establishment. Also two of the meals were a disappointment, one order was fries and shrimps, the shrimps were so small and only about 6 on plate. The pasta and shrimp dish was horrible.  I'm sorry to say, we will never eat at this establishment again, this ruined our evening out as a family!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream?start=40

It's bad enough that the customer noise level is full of uncouth people with no manners for their surrounding diners by shrieking and yelling like they're hanging out on their porch but to compound it with a live sports event (football, in this case) is just not customer friendly or savvy. Messy crumbs on booth seat, ugh. Took 7 minutes from the moment I was seated by the perky and pleasant hostess to have a server introduce herself and offer a drink. Waitress forgot to give me the flavored mayo on the side I requested. **When I requested refills of my fresh brewed iced tea, she kept giving me the same glass. Not a fresh glass. I'm eating a messy burger; it's going to transfer to the glass, no matter how often I wipe my fingers. Having to touch that was creepy and not appetizing.**   Burger was overcooked. I requested medium rare (warm, red center), received barely medium (light pink). Skimpy on the crispy cajun onions. Iceberg lettuce? Really?? In this day and age when Romaine is so easy to procure and provides a better experience. Chipotle mayo and beer cheese coupled with my hunger saved it from being sent back.  Mind you, the burger was tasty. It just wasn't up to snuff with what I'm used to @ TGIF's. Fries were dry and barely warm. Like they had been sitting there. Not fresh.  My server was a sweet gal; friendly, forthcoming with suggestions, quick on the serves and bringing me the check. Let's face it though... It's attached to the Green Acres Mall. They judge their viability according to volume and not individual satisfaction. If you're all scooby with that? Have at it. They lost my business due to inept kitchen staff. I can even forgive the server her faux pas as I attribute it to her young age and the busy hour. The rest is sub par service that I will avoid like the plague. Had to edit this review to update a detail. One of indicators that a chain pays attention to their business is ""the little things"".  Bathroom. I'm not handicapped but use that stall wherever I go because it's roomier and I'm finicky about comfort. This one was set up for family use (fold down diaper table). Said table was stained!!! I don't have children but am horrified on behalf of mothers that would need to use this feature. No paper seat liners!!! It's a handicapped stall. Do the proprietors actually expect a wheelchair bound customer to hover over the bowl?? Not to mention the smell. Granted, the floor was clear of debris but it had that odor that indicated they only cleaned it once a day at beginning of shift and didn't use bleach to disinfect it.

Grand Master D.,"Jamaica, NY",3,22,16,4.0,11/16/2017,"I can start this off like everyone else's and talk about the lack of training and/or professionalism of the greeters, but i won't. Or how two ladies came in after me and the male greeter was eager to sit them and left me waiting, but I won't.  Or how a greeter brought me to a table and i asked for a different table and she said hold on and never returned, but won't. Or how there are employees that walk around with blue gloves on wiping and cleaning off the tables, empty the trash and who knows what else with those gloves on, but I won't.... So can someone please tell me why this person with the cleaning blue glove on, get me napkins with the same cleaning blue gloves and think that ok! Needless to say, i never touched those napkins...but I won't any that stuff.  (Sidebar)Another reviewer mentioned an employee who had his pants hangin off his ass...i saw him too. As he walked pass the manager who never corrected that employee on proper dress code...unless SAGGIN is the T.G.I.F code of conduct. (Ok back finishing this review) So in the meantime I'm standing there waiting and waiting. In steps Leslie for stepping in with the biggest of smile and the warmest of greetings. Lets just say she did everything to right the wrongs and made me forget the not so good start at T.G.I.F. Quinten came out from the kitchen to check and make sure the special order I requested came out to my liking. Thank very much Leslie and Quinten for making a difference... Finally... I had a issue this my bill. (Because i didn't ask questions, so it was more my fault) But Derrick the manager adjusted my bill without blinking an eye. Now thats how you keep a custom.

Jessica F.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,,1.0,1/12/2018,"My uber eats order is always incorrect. I either receive the wrong order, or I have the correct order with missing items. The whole location needs to be evaluated internally​. Corporate needs to visit this location and retrain the management to the table cleaners. The community deserves better. I could not even call to tell the manager about my complaints because the receptionist took the phone off the hook, so all callers get is a busy signal. The manager who I have had to call several times about the same issue with the uber eats is entirely incompetent and as unprofessional is the rest of the staff. The manager continually suggests I should come to the restaurant to rectify the issue, but that defeats the purpose of uber eats. The staff is additionally over all rude. If I could order my food on uber eats from another location, I would, but I am out of range for a more preferred location. PLEASE VISIT THIS LOCATION AND RETRAIN THE STAFF AND BRING IN OUTSIDE HELP TO MAKE SURE THESE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED, RECTIFIED, AND REMAIN RESOLVED!

This is a place that you can go and get away with order lots of food and paying an awesome price. We were seated right away and greeted with a friendly smile from the waitress right away. We got there around 3:30 pm. The place was basically empty. I had a pleasurable experience. I will be back. Thank you. Side note.

I mean it always had a bad rep but I saw the good in it and gave a good review.  Now I'm back again and I can't lie and keep that good review. My experience today was horrible and disgusting. Waitress-Rude and non attentive We sat in the back and Staff in the kitchen were laughing loud and playing around when people were trying to dine. Some guy that looked like upper management was there having a meeting with the other managers but the whole time I'm sitting here asking my husband what is his point of being here if you're not observing and fixing anything. Service is slow and the waitresses don't give two craps. This is like a playground I swear. I think staff comes here to play and the customers are NOT a top priority. Food sitting there waiting to be given to the customer but no. They'd rather fool around with each other. But my question is, WHY WORK IN THIS FIELD???

Jatara I.,"Oyster Bay, NY",77,208,424,1.0,2/26/2017,"This review is long over due. I came here for take out about 3x and dine in 2x. My dine in experience was when they first open so I had absolutely no complaints.  It all started to go downhill a few years later when we started to order takeout. The first time we ordered take out we called in and ordered burgers, when we arrived they stated they no longer had any burgers left so we needed to order something else. To my understanding I was expecting a phone call I thought that was the reason why they take your number and on another note who runs out of burgers.  Ok, a year later we gave this location another chance. We called and ordered something I can't remember and when we got there we waited over 56 mins for our order and it was cold.  Now, today is what bring me to write this review. I was craving steak and my husband wanted ribs so we thought let's order takeout. We called ahead and when I arrived to my surprise it wasn't ready. I orders the ribeye with spinach and mash and he ordered a full rack of ribs and shrimp with side of mash and coleslaw. I wanted my steak medium cause I know they cook it longer so it would of been medium well. First off my steak was well done and very tough I couldn't even cut it with a steak knife and when I finally cut it, it had way too much fat. I didn't even eat the spinach. The mash taste like it normally do. Then I tried to cut my husband ribs and that was tough no meat was falling off of the bone. So we trashed it and vow to never order from this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream
Celeste B.,"Brooklyn, NY",215,481,849,1.0,1/20/2017,I visited this location for this first time and the service was the poorest that I have ever experienced. The staff members appeared to be young and probably mostly in high school.  They all appeared to be supervising themselves.  I was given the wrong information when I asked a simple question from staff. No two staff members had the same answer for one question SMH. Once I was seated it was at a table in the middle of the floor and my chair was bumped repeatedly. I waited for about 10-15 minutes and was never greeted! Not one waiter or waitress approached my table during that time. When I got tired of waiting I got up and left. I don't plan to return again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream
Briaunté W.,"Queens, NY",902,520,2679,2.0,7/17/2016,"I'm not big on chain restaurants. However sometimes I'd like to enjoy half priced apps and drinks every so often. If you've been to one TGI Fridays you've been to them all.  I wouldn't say the staff is rude, but they're not all that personable either. Picture someone doing the bare minimum just to get a passing 'C' grade in school. That's the impression I received here. Be prepared to get a side eye or two if you ask for additional items or a cup of ice to go.   My friend asked for a to-go cup as we wrapped up our meal. She still had some of her lemon water left. Our server John must've thought my friend wanted to share my frozen Lava drink. He became defensive and said, ""if you want to share her drink just say so. You don't have to lie to me about it"". We both looked at him like he was crazy. We told him that's not the case and besides she can't drink.  Here's the thing I much prefer him being a waiter instead of a security guard. Who cares what she needed it for. Why does her request need an explanation? The food was just okay. I guess I wasn't expecting much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-valley-stream

I ordered 2 drinks Frozen Lava Flow & Frozen Blue Hawaiian, it would have been nice if I was told they didn't have any Tiki glasses at the bottle of the menu it does indicate there is a $5.00 fee if you would like to take the glass home with you. The drinks was too sweet , I took 2 sips and had the Bartender pour both drinks out.

They're too busy playing/joking & carrying on behind the bar with each other to take care of their guests. 3-4 bartenders with 15 total guests shouldn't warrant 15 mins to be asked for your drink order, nor 25 mins total to receive that order.

We waited 15 min and then decided that since the bar was open we would just go there. It only got worse from there. The food took over an hour to come out. The service was slow with everyone and alot of people started getting loud and crazy over this. The cherry on top was when we asked for the bill, we were waiting for about 6 min and when it was brought we gave the bartender our card without even looking at the bill because we wanted to split; he looked at us and said i only have 2 hands please wait.

We said that it was too cold at our booth and she was nice enough to reseat us promptly at another and requested that the heat be turned up a bit in the resturant, which we thought was nice. Our drinks took a bit long to come out and the water probably in need of a BRITA water filter or something but otherwise the drinks were okay. Our waitress Anna was also really nice. She came over an checked up on us periodically for what we needed. We were surprised when the manager came over after and asked us if everything went okay and it was.

Gael M.,"Queens, New York, NY",156,189,85,2.0,9/5/2016,"I don't think I've ever had a good experience at this location. Being in the hospitality industry, I like to think terrible visits are isolated incidents, but that's just not the case here.  My last visit here was in the middle of the week at 1:30 in the afternoon, so of course we were seated immediately. There were 3 other tables already sat in the main dining room by the bar and it still took over 30 minutes for us to even place an order. Our server just kind of wandered about and forgot about us. My date & I each ordered off of the lunch menu. When the food finally came out, half the order was completely wrong. My date ordered the bruschetta pasta because she's vegetarian & the dish came with chicken. That's weird because the menu doesn't say that at all. I can't blame the server entirely for that, but there should be some type of communication when someone orders something and you throw meat inside when it's not listed. Then her side salad was completely wrong as well. We ordered a Cobb salad with avocado vinaigrette. We received a Caesar salad. Then we also ordered a Sam Adams Pumkpinhead, but when the server came over with it, she said ""it's usually darker than this but they said this is the right beer. You can try it if you want"" and it was clearly an entirely different beer, but at that point we just kept it.  All in all, it was slow service mixed with inadequacy topped with zero floor presence. A few things could have been avoided or not have taken so long if there were maybe other people available or even an identifiable manager, but that wasn't the case.
