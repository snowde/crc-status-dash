Philip R.,"Ambler, PA",50,208,900,5.0,10/21/2017,Took a friend here for his birthday dinner only both enjoyed our meals. They were offering a full rack of ribs for $13 as a special. The Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce was fantastic as was the ribs. Also really enjoyed the premium side of fried brussel sprouts!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington
Jae L.,"Horsham, PA",238,105,66,1.0,7/13/2017,"This place is awful. We came in and had to sit ourselves. The waitress came about 10 min after we sat and took another 20 minutes to get our water and drinks. We ordered our food and and I am still waiting after 25+ minutes. It's pretty bad when the place is empty and yet the service is this bad. I can't even review and tell you about the food because... I still didn't get it. Update: just got my apps. Potato skins are very bland. French onion soup was... Acceptable at best. The nachos were probably the best but still a bit on the salty side.  Overall... Terrible service, below average food. I would recommend the McDonald's down the street for better food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington
Courtney C.,"Warrington, PA",39,219,287,3.0,7/3/2017,"I always have a good time at TGI Fridays , the food is always good and the majority of the staff is awesome! Most visits are great especially when you sit by the bar I feel like I get better service. The main reason I keep going back to Fridays is because of the rewards, they're awesome. If you haven't signed up yet - definitely do. As compared to other local locations this one generally has better service, Willlow Grove is very slow. This restaurant definitely needs a little more upkeep though. Every time I go here the whole floor is sticky through the whole restaurant. Just some improved upkeep would be nice. If you're looking for solid food and good drinks definitely stop by, you won't be blown away but you won't be disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington
Jacqueline H.,"Schwenksville, PA",6,92,190,2.0,3/5/2017,"Ehh this place was not the best. I had low expectations already when my boyfriend wanted to come eat here for dinner. Our server came to the table right away and took our drink orders, I went with the Sangria and my boyfriend got a soda. I figured the Sangria would probably be $6 since this is TGI Fridays after all. We skipped out on an appetizer and I got the Cajun and shrimp pasta (half size), and my boyfriend got a chicken and shrimp with mashed potatoes meal. It felt like forever for our food to come out. The food runner ended up walking past our table with our meals, because she was told the wrong table number. The entrees were served on skillets. I thought my dish was tasty but there wasn't enough shrimp and it wasn't that hot when it came out. What I did like was that the pasta came in a half and full size. My boyfriend told me that he liked his meal, I tried a piece of his chicken, but did not find it that remarkable. I was shocked after getting the bill to see that a Sangria was $10 here. The sad part is my Sangria wasn't even filled all the way. I'm glad I didn't order a second one. Don't think I'll be back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington
Fran N.,"Willow Grove, PA",1,7,1,1.0,4/15/2017,"We were there last night 7:30pm, 4/14/17. For a Friday night there was no one in there. They told us that there was endless apps. It only applies to a few of them. They didn't tell us that part. The waitress was horrible. The food was gross and cold. The  Dos Equis draft beer was watered down. I live in Willow Grove and thought the Friday's down here was horrible, but the Warrington Friday's is worse! They should hang it up and pour a different restaurant  there",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington
Janine L.,"Warminster, PA",0,2,7,1.0,5/8/2017,"What happened to this place???? Use to be good but we just had the worst experience ever. Let me say on a positive our waiter Mike was fantastic. Now for all the negative.....Monday 4:30 only 4 other people in the entire restaurant. Ordered endless apps and a Caesar salad with flat iron steak. Took forever for apps to come out and when they did the chicken wings were barely warm and the potstickers were still freezing inside. Sent them back only to have the next round of potstickers be just as cold. Nice waiter Mike took those back too. When they came out again they were obviously microwaved as the wonton wrappers were like crunchy parchment paper, but at this point I was starving. Now remember there were only 4 other customers in the ENTIRE restaurant. Our salad still hadn't come out yet. 40 mins after our arrival the salad comes out with a bucket of dressing on it. Totally inedible. But at this point why complain. It was useless.  We just know that this was out last visit ever to the TGIFridays in Warrington. What happened to this location?????",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington

Kat B.,"Denville, NJ",54,154,40,4.0,12/7/2016,"We stopped here on a trip home at about 8 o'clock before Thanksgiving.  A trivia game was in process and we were able to join in. It was fun and my first trivia experience.  There were many rounds and we actually left before the game ended as we were travelling but what a great idea! There was a DJ playing music as well as running the game.   The space was a typical TGI Friday's space, not really crowded for the day before Thanksgiving but we were offered either free dessert or a free appetizer if we played trivia.  We choose the appetizer.  We picked the nacho chips with spinach dip as well as salsa and guacamole. It was a very large portion and we were both unable to finish and brought it home.  We also each ordered a dinner - I choose the chicken club with a side salad (you got to pick either a salad or fries with your meal) and my companion ordered a turkey burger.  Again, big portions and we barely started our meal and had to bring the orders home. I must add that there are a lot of restaurants on this road and I chose this because 1) it wasn't fast food like Wendys or McDonalds;  2) it was close to the road; and 3) I wanted a place to sit and relax a bit before I resumed my trip home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington
Benjamin H.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,25,1,5.0,1/11/2017,"I'm in the area a lot and come here very often with co workers. I honestly can't think of a bad experience at this location. Servers seem very nice and friendly and food is pretty good.  There are plenty of restaurants along this road and this one is first on my list to come to.  They also have events like trivia and such during the week nights if you're ever bored.  Always a good time here at TGI's! Typical tgi atmosphere!  If you're ever looking for a place to try, don't hesitate to come in!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington
Corey M.,"Philadelphia, PA",135,14,11,5.0,8/14/2016,"Jesse is my favorite server at this location. He definitely deserves a five star rating. I'm not a big fan of restaurants like this, but I always have a great experience here. He's super polite and attentive. He always suggest a great drink and remembers my favorite appetizers.

J M.,"Reading, PA",0,7,1,1.0,6/4/2017,"Twice now I've been to this location and have received  disappointment in exchange  for my hard earned money.  The staff disappears for 10-15 minutes at time, needing friendly reminders of your needs when they choose to reappear from the back.  When the food arrives it's below standard. Hands down the biggest dissatisfaction is the service.   This location is a black eye for #applebees",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington
Laura W.,"Doylestown, PA",1,59,,1.0,2/3/2017,Would give them zero stars if I could. Only go here because my son loves jack Daniels sauce. Got take out. They only got 2 things correct. Husband had to go back. When he called to complain they said that one of the salads ordered had been changed. Well if you don't tell customers on your website how would they know. Come on this isn't rocket science. Their online ordering is a joke. Why even bother? Just go somewhere else. Went there again. Just try to avoid. It's like they are trying to go out of business,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington
Mark S.,"Doylestown, PA",2,15,1,2.0,10/2/2016,"What Happened?!?   This used to be very good.   We would go as a family and always had a good experience.   We went last night for the first time in about a year and things seemed to have changed for the worse.   It was 6:30 on a Saturday night and it wasn't packed (like it used to be).  Looking back that was a sign that things had changed.  The menu was smaller.  Instead of the book-style menu, it's now a large single sheet with food on one shade and drinks on the other.  Ok, I can understand that.  Trying to simplify things is sometimes good.   The service was very slow with our appetizer coming just before our entrees.  We ordered nachos - which are usually pretty standard - but they had pretzel bites in them!?  Why?!   We also ordered the Chicken Tenders - one of our usual favorites - but they were different than we've had in the past.  They must have changed suppliers.  Instead of 5 very large tenders we got 4 much smaller ones.   The service was slow again as we tried to get the check and leave.  Overall it felt like it was under new (but not better) management.  It's sad, but we won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington
Karen S.,"Warminster, PA",54,23,26,4.0,5/22/2017,"This is usually our go to place. We love to come here because we love the huge bar with plenty of seats and tvs. The rewards program can't be beat. We are always getting emailed coupons and have so many points on our app we can barely spend as many as we get! Cheryl is the best bar tender and she knows us as regulars. She works very hard and always makes sure we have everything we need. I actually saw a server break a glass all over the counter where Cheryl was working one night and you could tell she was so embarrassed. Cheryl didn't get mad, she even assured the girl it was ok and she took the time and with patience she showed the girl how to clean it up and helped her without getting angry at her. She probably had no idea we saw that but it's little things like that make you want to come back bc the food and staff is so good. Sometimes we get endless appetizers that seen to be cold or might have been sitting under a heat lamp. But usually we have good experiences here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington
MeMe 7.,"Ambler, PA",99,7,6,1.0,3/11/2017,"I am very upset with the service that was provided to my husband and I tonight regarding our dinner. We sat at the bar for convenience however the outcome wasn't so convenient. After, placing our order and receiving our drink our soup and salad came out shortly. This was at 8:39PM. The salad was not good and my husband asked for a French onion soup instead. That arrived shortly and by this time our entrees should have arrived a few minutes after. After 30 minutes we still did not receive our entrees.  I asked the bartender that took our order if we could have a status. He went to that back and it tok him about 5-8 min to come back and he didn't even address the issue. I again asked him if he can find out where our order is and he said it should be right up. I also explained to him that the couple next to us ordered after us and has similar meals and received their food already and you also took that order. He then said, ""Let me find out where your food is?"" So, instead of him returning the other bartender brings the manager. The manager says, ""Do you want me to see how far along your food is?"" How far along the food is? Shouldn't it be done? So, I agreed to seeing where it was in the process. Which means it probably wasn't even cooked yet. They eventually comped the food and and the manager brought it out. I have to say she was not even apologetic towards the food taking so long. So, Now the bartender that attended to us comes out and asks us, ""Do you still want your food it just came out?"" Did he not communicate with his manager who just brought the food out? I wanted to inspect the food however my husband insisted that I just leave it alone being as thought they already comped the food. We got home and I obviously was still hungry. I opened up my entree and it was  was freezing cold and they didn't even get my husbands order correct. This is just a clear indication that the food was never made or they gave us someone else's that was sitting. I don't frequent that place but I now I won't be coming here at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington

K B.,"Southampton, PA",0,18,,2.0,9/4/2016,"Restroom was very dirty.  One of the toilets was totally clogged with paper towels.  One of the 2 sinks wouldn't even drain.  Dirty paper towels were overflowing the trash can onto the floor.  Went directly to speak to host at front door and asked that the restroom please be Cleaned.  It never was.  Also, a number of tables in dining room were still covered with dirty dishes from earlier customers.  Our server was pleasant but clearly overwhelmed  with tables at far ends of dining room.  Appetizers and burgers were just OK, but nothing special.  Overall the place could use a solid Cleaning and/or Renovation ASAP.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington
Mister S.,"Newtown, PA",0,6,,1.0,3/2/2017,"Terrible food. My girlfriend and I started with the boneless chicken wings with Jack Daniel sauce.  Mostly breading but what can you expect here.  The plate was way too big for the 7-8 pieces we got and it looked like it was just tossed on the plate.  I know this just tgi Fridays but some effort into plating should be taken. I ordered the southern fried chicken sandwich.  My ""chicken"" had barely any chicken, 3/4 of it was just a hunk of fried crust.  I also ordered a side salad with my meal but they gave me fries.  They were burnt looking and cold...A very unpleasant combination.  I finally got my salad which was just a bunch of brown lettuce.  I couldn't finish my meal.  For the amount of money we spent we would have been much happier else where.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington

Carly R.,"Long Island, NY",162,62,82,1.0,2/28/2016,"I originally gave this place 3 stars for our waitress patty but unfortunately in our over an hour wait for just our entrees she got an attitude because of our obvious frustration with the wait. The kitchen is ridiculously slow and the food was mediocre at best. I know it's a franchise and I shouldn't expect 5 star meals but come on, this is still a VERY well known restaurant and they should live up to their name. I spoke with the manager a blonde female who all but apologized and just stood there like a deer in headlights. Apparently they spend more money in national advertising then they do training their line cooks and staff. VERY disappointed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington?start=20

Jennifer B.,"Independence, MO",0,2,,1.0,6/30/2014,Absolutely terrible!! The place is completely dirty and old. My mom went into the bathroom and one of the toilets was backed up and the floor was sticky inside. I had to ask our server 3 times for her to just get me a glass of ice water. Not to mention she took forever to even get our food out. When our food did come out my burger tasted horrible and cold like they had left it sitting up there. My aunt who was with us said when her food came out it tasted fine however there was a tiny piece of newspaper shoved underneath the food on her plate!! Then we're pretty sure they overcharged us on our drinks because the sangria I got was apparently $10? I did appreciate the fact that the manager tried to correct the problem by taking both items off the menu but I find it hard to believe that 4 drinks and spinach dip could have cost us $45.

Jeffrey S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",7,59,,1.0,12/17/2014,"TGI Fridays is not what it was. I ordered the double deck Reuben. There was plenty of bread but not a whole lot of meat between the slices of bread.

We asked our waitress why this establishment insisted on putting lemons in our drinks?  Her response was, ""Well we got your meals correct, didn't we?"" Really, not the response we expected. But they didn't get our meals correct. They forgot one of the items that my girlfriend was suppose to get with her meal. We had to remind them. We had 4 separate people taking our order. Our waitress was suppose to take our order,  but we think she was late. One of the managers took our appetizer order, someone different took our drink order, but someone different brought them. Someone different took our meal order, which was our waitress. Then someone else brought our meals. After we were done with our meal they tried to give us someone else's meals. And the place wasn't even busy. Guess we know why. We asked our waitress if a customer asked for no lemons in their drinks due to allergies,  but you kept putting lemons in the drinks, what would they do?

Theodore H.,"Pipersville, PA",42,56,2,1.0,5/27/2013,"I have to say, I've been here multiple times and I've never had a good experience here. Lets get started... *PLEASE NOTE: I've spoken to their guest relations about this establishment about the below incident* The last time I was here was with my g/f. We got seated promptly and then waited. About 10 min later another couple gets seated next to us. The waiter goes and greets them first and takes their drink order right away and walks past us. After bringing their drinks he comes to us and asks for our drink orders. We told him we were in a hurry, we wanted to see a movie and had time to eat but didn't want to dilly dally. We knew our entire order and was waiting on him. He told us that he was NOT going to take our food order right now, and that he only wanted to take our drink order. We politely told him we would like to put in everything since we were ready. He refused to hear it so we told him what drinks we wanted. He came back and then said that he could take our order, which could have saved us some time if we could have just put everything in together. Time goes by and we are waiting on our food, and finally it arrives. Something was wrong with my g/f order so now she's starting to get annoyed, but let it pass. We were never checked up on and it took a long time for the waiter to come back to us to even ask if we wanted anything else. She gets a drink and then asks for the check. I show the waiter that I had a coupon and he writes it down and goes to get the check. Another 10 or so minutes goes by with no check. My g/f is getting pissed by this point...then the check comes...and they didn't discount the food as was supposed to happen. That was the icing on the cake, my g/f gets up, goes to the hostess and asks to see the manager. The hostess goes in the back, talks to somebody and says he'll be with us. 10 more minutes goes by with no manager showing up. She gets up AGAIN and asks for the manager. The hostess goes back again to get the manager and finally he comes out and talks to us. He obviously apologizes for the service and the food, and does discount the bill but we were still pretty pissed that it took so long for the manager to speak to a guest.  We paid and left the establishment, and were lucky enough to make our movie.  Other past experiences with this place are pretty much the same, bad and slow service. I've never had good service here.

First the sound was deafening, apparently a bartender contest.  We were seated on the other side of a partial wall.  Our waiter was pleasant enough, took drink orders - just 2 Coke Zero.  He took the dinner order - husband had the Jack Daniels burger, I wanted the petit sirloin - 6 oz cooked medium & a double order of broccoli - I was pointing to the doneness chart.  After about a 10 minute wait our dinner arrived.  Husband's burger was fine.  My steak looked like it had been dropped on the plate with grease all over.  I cut into it and it was well done and dry.  Trying to find the waiter was Impossible.  I got up and asked another waiter. About 15 minutes later the second steak arrived.  A manager delivered the second one.  He asked me to cut it to make sure it was the way I wanted it.  Unfortunately the meat did not have time to rest and all the juices poured out.  The manager made a comment that sounded like something would be compensated.  Nothing was done, very disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warrington?start=20
