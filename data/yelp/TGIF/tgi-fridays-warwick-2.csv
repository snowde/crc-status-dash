James B.,"North Providence, RI",153,70,138,5.0,8/18/2015,Had a great time in NJ for my moms birthday and headed back from there to Pez Visitor center then got hungry and saw TGIF Friday!! The place looks amazing outside and inside has some great pictures and objects from older celebrity people!! We were greeted by two people holding the doors open for us! Total Sweetness! We got seated rapidly and then for this amazing waitresses Alecia She is a total ball of great personality and is the best!! She pays attention and is there when you need her!! She had a great personality and knows customer service! Our food was amazing and came out hot in a timely matter!! We will definitely come back because Alecia is a rockstar!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=20
JLynn C.,"Coventry, RI",591,337,2382,4.0,7/10/2015,"I've always liked Friday's, been coming here for years but hadn't been back for a while until today. The inside hasn't changed in forever, still your typical chain feel but that's ok. I ordered take out and the girl seemed pretty friendly over the phone. The food was done pretty fast and it was actually really good. Potato skins were perfect and the fries had a nice seasoning. I had no issues whatsoever so I think I will eat at Fridays more often :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=20
Kevin H.,"Warwick, RI",21,24,46,2.0,3/3/2016,Came at lunch on a Thursday and was underwhelmed by everything. Very dark in the bar area where I had the 3 app special which was a lot of food but cost $14. The worst was the smell of bleach that unfortunately is still with me. Food and bleach is not a good mix maybe they should have done the bleaching hours before meal time? Kudos to the bartender Megan for doing a good job despite her surroundings.  I might come back but only for drinks after work...prolly not!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=20
Derek B.,"Warwick, RI",0,2,,1.0,5/11/2017,Deb is absolutely the worst manager I've ever encountered. 45 minutes for premade burgers and chicken chunks. Cold.. all of it. She offers us free desert. I don't want desert I would just like an edible meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=20
Chad W.,"Warwick, RI",0,5,,1.0,12/18/2016,"I live near TGI Friday's and it seems convenient to eat here. However I have visited several times and every time the service is worse than terrible. I have mentioned it to the manager on duty. He has said he will deal with it, took my name and personal information claiming to email me coupons and such (which never happened ). This is a terrible game lace to go and enjoy a meal. There are several other establishments to grab a bite to eat. I suggest skipping this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=20
Laura H.,"Warwick, RI",0,7,,2.0,1/24/2016,The service was absolute terrible.  We were seated the minute we got arrived. We sat for about 10 minutes before the waitress came to introduced herself. She took out drink order.  It took us almost another 10 minutes to get those. Then our waitress disappeared until it was time to pay.  She states that she was all over the place that night. We saw more of the other waiters and waitresses.  The food was okay and the drinks were weak. Probably not going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=20
Ihabs B.,"Narragansett, RI",0,28,,1.0,8/5/2017,We thought we would give the Warwick Fridays another chance.  We walked in and there were 3 other parties waiting...trouble is just in my viewing range there were 7 two tables and 4 tables that could seat 4.   I should have known at this point to leave.   We ordered... got a salad first.... which came out 40 min later.  Our meals about 10 min after the salad.  Their claim was there were some large parties in there except we can see the entire restaurant and there weren't any.    It got so bad the guy next to us with his wife had to get up and ask the wait staff at the station for their own drinks.   Wifes meal was incomplete it was supposed to come with another side and they forgot it.  Waiter said he would get the manager.... they took off the meal... but the manager never showed.   This location has been in steady decline for years andits not showing signs of any improvement.  Were done.. wont be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=20

Stacey M.,"Mansfield, MA",0,2,,1.0,6/6/2017,"Came in for take out. I'm writing this as I wait so I can't comment on the food. Let's start with the positive: the hostess was very pleasant. Now the reason I'll never come back: there is a smell throughout the restaurant that can only be described as dirty water to wash the floors. I used the bathroom and the smell was in there too. As I stand at the hostess stand waiting for my food, my shoes are sticking to the floor. So gross",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=20
Nicole G.,"Coventry, RI",8,23,34,4.0,5/15/2015,"I always have a great time at Friday's. What brings this place down is the food choices. They are a bit pricey and in my opinion, I can get better choices at Applebee's in the next plaza over. And coming in tonight I was told they took off items. I understand jack Daniels is their signature item but I feel like it can only get you so far. But alas, my server, jordana, may be the only reason I come. She is fantastic!  Overall, Fridays is a great place to eat if you come in time to time. Otherwise you will get bored with the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=20
Meaghan Q.,"Saddle River, NJ",0,2,,1.0,11/8/2016,"Went to lunch with my mom around noon, and we were surprised that there was nobody there. We were seated immediately, and our server came over almost immediately and asked for our drinks. We ordered simple meals, she got the jack Daniels slider with a house salad, and I got the spicy chicken slider with a house salad. Well the ""spicy chicken slider"" was a chicken tender in between two pieces of bread. That's it. We also had probably about 15 fries between the both of us. Not worth the $22 and will definitely not be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=20
Jarrod N.,"West Warwick, RI",168,8,,1.0,7/5/2016,"Putting one star is actually giving this place credit. When my daughter and I were seated all we could hear is the kitchen staff swearing at one another, i ask the waitress to speak to the mgr and she never told him until the 2nd time i asked to speak to him 15 mins later...kylie or however u spell it was described as new and ditzy from her mgr instead of untrained and professional the mgr apologized which made me laugh due to the fact that i pay for food and service not apologies...when the burgers were served kylie thought a simple apology again would be ok for her to slide my burger off and make a mess...Overall horrible experience here and the staff was unprofessional... if all this is seen in customer view imagine whats being said and done behind the doors....hopefully no one gets sick or little kids develop swearing habits",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=20
Bonnie B.,"Coventry, RI",0,27,1,3.0,4/20/2017,"Hey, Friday's! What's up with your endless apps refills? Last time I came in I got full orders of appetizer refills. This past week, the first order of dumplings had the full order for six, then the refill had four. The BBQ chicken Flatbread came out with only four pieces. Has the policy changed?

Bill M.,"East Greenwich, RI",0,5,,1.0,3/16/2017,"Just awful. Ordered endless apps. Potato Skins - barely cooked and barely topped. I can remember when the used to be good.

Lynn K.,"Chicago, IL",6,34,1,1.0,10/4/2015,"Stopped here after a day of errands Now I know why I do t come here (actually have not been to this location in over 20 years! Nothing has changed) Sat at the bar - 2 bartenders - clueless, brash, loud and in the weeds with a total of 20 people in the entire restaurant.  Made the mistake of sitting near the servers bar location and I was able to listen to servers bitch about everything throughout my entire meal Meal- potstickers appetizer- it is possible for them to be  frozen and burnt at the same time? Yes, #truestory Had homemade lemonade - not bad but they add soda water so it's really not lemonade - it's lemon soda.  The pecan encrusted chicken salad was nothing to write home about - come to think of it I want to go home and cook my own meal which I should have done in the first place",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=20
Anthony S.,"Warwick, RI",32,4,,1.0,4/19/2016,I hate to complain about things but this really was Terrible my  chicken was burnt on one side ribs where fatty and my side of sounich mushrooms and onions looked dehydrated and burnt my wifes pasta was dry like it had sat under a heat lamp for 20 minutes when I brought it to the waitresses attention she did offer me free desert I passed was afraid it would be burnt or dried out when the waitress mentioned it to the manager  he told her he would talk to the cook never came to the table to address us. The only  positive thing was the waitress she was super nice and the beer was Cold. My advice if your are  looking for ribs or chicken head somewhere else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=20

Basil R.,"West Greenwich, RI",4,8,,3.0,5/19/2015,"Overall decent experience for the family. Was there for my son's 5th birthday and I was satisfied as far as the food goes for a chain, however their quality has certainly gone down. Server was unattentive and provided mediocre service. He didn't maintain the table which can get crowded with 4 people and two kids. Also I was never asked if I wanted another beer which of course I did. I ordered the pb and J wings and I have to say I have mixed feelings. The peanut sauce was good but the hanbanero jelly was lacking in quantity. The wings them self were horrible, fatty with bone fragments. Not what I would have expected for $11.99. The burger was good but lacking the seasoning to make it pop. Like I said overall it was decent but certainly not a destination for me",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=20
Kayla L.,"Cranston, RI",45,2,,2.0,6/16/2017,"good food, but not that much customer service . seems like some workers don't want to work . once you walk in , it smells like wet rags and the floors are sticky .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=20
Shawn M.,"Warwick, RI",0,3,,1.0,5/28/2017,"Endless apps if you have endless time.  Like all the other reviews customer service at this locations is severely lacking.  It seems like every time we come here some disaster has struck the wait staff.  Late night resulted in a late dinner (10 pm) and there was not many people. No hostess in sight so we seated ourselves the bar area. Sat at the high tops in the bar area as my friends and I like the drink specials that you can only get at the bar.  With that being said, it is very clear that the bartenders have no problem blatantly ignoring you.  The bartender sent over another waitress to take our first order and she also asked us what we wanted for round two.  Appreciating the forethought we ordered our second round too.  Waited forever for our first order to come.  The bartender brought it to us and it wasn't right. His response ""those idiots!"" No I'm sorry.  Another waiter brought over the right order after waiting even longer. The bartender never came over to check on our food or asked if we wanted refills on our beverages.  He had no problem conversing  with everyone at the bar or even the high top next to us. Finally after moving the scraps left on our plates enough, the bartender asked is what we wanted for our second round of endless apps.  Confused we mentioned that the first waitress already took that order.  He went to his POS and then came back with his favorite phrase ""those idiots"" and asked us what we had ordered cause apparently the kitchen staff had messed up again. And yet again we waited a long time to the point that we had lost our appetite. At that point another waiter came over with our second round. Upon seeing that we had no more room for a single plate this waiter decided to clear our dirty plates (something the bartender could have easily done when asking what we would like for a second round).  After picking a little bit we decided that we wanted to leave.  We waited even longer till I just went up to the bartender and asked for our checks. Never apologizing once for the service or the wait he cashed us out. Friday's used to be a reliable option for consistent service and food. Clearly the times have changed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=20
John F.,"Coventry, RI",0,3,,1.0,11/6/2015,"Very disappointed. Haven't been here in years due to a bad experience last time. Should have stayed away. My Cheddar Bacon Burger was supposed to be topped with onion rings. It had one very thin, over cooked onion ring on it. The portion of fries was minuscule. My son's drink was 95% ice. Had to get a second one after 3 sips. Commented that there was too much ice and got another cup with 95% ice. His Pasta with butter and cheese was served as plain pasta with a small side cup of clarified butter and shavings of Parmesan. It had clearly been under the heat lamp for a while as the Parmesan was melted to itself and the plates and bowls were too hot to touch. On a positive note, my wife's salad was plentiful and tasty.  The decor is outdated and dull and the wait staff echoed the atmosphere. Our server was pleasant enough but everyone else seemed miserable.  Needless to say, I don't recommend this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=60
Dominica H.,"West Warwick, RI",42,11,2,1.0,2/16/2014,"This place is nothing short of disgusting. Sat at the bar on a Sunday during the day....all you can smell is the nasty dirty taps that desperately need to be cleaned of the fowl smell of crusted up wheat. I asked the bartender to move my seat and he acknowledged the fowl smell! Both bartenders were rude for no reason. When I asked for a side of sauce that I asked for in the beginning, he rolled his eyes!!! Then I watched him fish fruit flies out of a glass of wine and then serve it to a customer!! Gross.

Stefan K.,"East Greenwich, RI",0,3,,1.0,9/26/2015,"We used to like going to this place. We have not been there for a year or more. Last Friday we went there and were really disappointed. We ordered hamburger and sizzling chicken and shrimps. The bun on the burger was cold and dry not even grilled. Burger King has better buns. The fries were old and dry. Overall the burger experience was one of the worst I had. The  chicken and shrimps my wife had came with a mash potatoes which were extremely hot, my wife burned her tongue on her first bite. No one warned her about this. The dish was also very salty. The berry sangria was too sugary and did not seem to have much alcohol in it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=60
Celeste G.,"Pawtucket, RI",4,2,,1.0,9/10/2015,"I was there today with a friend where I had such an awkward experience!  I ordered fries as an appetizer which tasted really good! My entree was the sizzling chicken and shrimp which was served dry and the cheese was burnt to a crisp and I had to peel the burnt cheese off the plate.  The waitress was very nice and took it back.  When the manager came, he advised me to let them know how I prefer my entree.  I was so shocked because ""sizzling"" indicates a hot, bubbly & cheesy experience. To make it worse, I looked down at my plate and it looked like they placed 2 cheese singles on top of the chicken and microwaved it.  I can still see the square shaped cheese singles.  The waitress was very nice but I will not be going back to a TGIFridays and especially not to that one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=60

Mj W.,"Tariffville, CT",30,98,7,3.0,2/24/2011,"Usually I love T.G.I. Friday's, in fact I was recently at the Manchester NH location and all was wonderful....but this time it was not as good sadly.  I ordered the same entree, Bruchetta Chicken Pasta without the chicken, a side of JD sauce to pour over it and bread sticks.  Happily, I found on the menu that the same entree was also available for a limited time with an appetizer and dessert for roughly the same price as just the entree. So, I also ordered fried mozz and vanilla bean cheesecake.  The waitress was MIA for most the meal having to wait for each serving well beyond what was reasonable and, as a result, our food was served cold, not just a little cold but ice cold. The mozz was yummy and, although cold, the pasta was edible and flavorful. The bread sticks were late to arrive and were hot and delicious. The cheesecake was better then usual for chain desserts and I would order it again.  Although nice, the waitress really didn't seem to be up to speed. Not only was service slow and the food cold, getting the check and having the cc processed was just as much of a lengthy and painful process.  I'm sure not all experiences will be this way, it depends on who waits on you. It's too bad chain restaurants don't have a hostess or manager out on the floor to monitor the service in the front of the house, you would think that would be an important part of restaurant management but it appears that none of them seem to find it important enough to follow through on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=60
Andrea R.,"Providence, RI",241,162,95,3.0,11/15/2012,I like to go here for drinks/appetizers when nothing else in the area is open.  It's down the road from on/off ramps for 95 so that makes it convenient.  Drinks are okay considering it's a chain restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=60
Janeth V.,"Coventry, RI",0,2,,1.0,3/2/2014,"I don't usually complain when it comes to restaurants but I had one of the worst dine in experiences here. We were waiting to be greeted by our waitress for at least 15 minutes, It would have been okay if we had gotten a drink first but it was as if we were invisible. As if that wasn't bad enough my husband found an expiration day sticker in his steak!! The 'use by' date was 2 days before. The manager's explanation was ridiculous and did not make sense.

Sha'Ri R.,"Wilmington, DE",76,92,37,2.0,9/9/2012,I dont go to a lot of chain places but I normally enjoy Friday's. This place the food is NOT consistent and I have been 6-7 times. The night manager is very nice and fixed my meal when it was wrong. Actually I prefer to go at night. Lunch time seems to be when I have a problem. I have experienced cold food under cooked chicken wrong food being charged for food did not recieve.

I know that this is just your average chain restaurant but the flavor combinations they used were really good. I had the Captain Morgan Caribbean Chicken Sandwich. The chicken was moist and topped with a great sauce and avocado and pineapple. It also came with sweet potato fries, they were not the best I have ever had but defiantly went well with the meal. Prices are fair and the drink menu is awesome. I enjoy a fancy girlie drink from time to time and they have a lot of options. Staff was friendly and the service was quick.

Dani G.,"Warwick, RI",15,311,,2.0,1/4/2009,"We chose this spot during the holiday vacation because on route 2, every other restaurant had an hour wait. Through the process of elimination, our destiny had been determined.  I scoured the menu and discovered minimal vegetarian options and so my waitress was kind enough to assist. I ordered the jack daniels burger sans the meat. The waitress did appeared baffled but she was able to resume her composure and write down my order. Now the menu describes this meal as a burger coated with the jack daniels special sauce, topped with bacon, melted provolone cheese, lettuce and tomato. What I got was an untoasted bun (slightly stale), a piece of provolone, tomato and lettuce and a side of the jack sauce......ummmm ok. I also ordered the house salad which I must say was pretty good- but to be fair, I can put honey mustard dressing on anthing and to me it would be pretty good.  My dining partners enjoyed the jack daniels chicken  sampler, the spinach and artichoke dip and the spicy chicken pasta (not really spicy).

Patrice F.,"Jersey City, NJ",18,9,11,4.0,6/30/2014,"Fridays overall is my favorite chain because their specials are reasonable and they have dishes I like. Happy hour is what got me started. I love the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta for an entree and the pot stickers and spinach dip are my favorite apps. They also have weeknight specials...$3 mojitos on a Wednesday...you can't beat that! Late night Wednesday bartenders are great. Very friendly. They always check on me to make sure I'm satisfied and they remember me so they also know what I'm likely to order and when I wanna try something different, they give me suggestions. Haven't had a bad one yet. Coupled with the deals it's a good experience and nice to take in a game at the same time. Not too expensive plus I have their membership so I get coupons and informed about specials. It FREE to join! There aren't many people at the times I go...it's late then so it's expected.

Casey K.,"North Providence, RI",0,14,7,4.0,5/14/2016,"This was a first time visit for me and I was surprised by how dark it was inside. That aside, we were seated immediately, and our waiter was very quick to help. His name was Josh and he was very friendly. The appetizer was quick to come out, and still mostly hot. I say mostly because we ordered chicken nachos. The chicken and cheese melt on it was still piping hot. After the appetizer we only waited about 10 minutes for our meals. They were especially hot, I had to wait a little before I could eat.  Josh was quick to get our refills and came to make sure things were good. There was also a point during our meal when one of the waitresses dropped a plate and we all heard a very audible ""What the Fuck"". I was not expecting that type of language when there was clearly three tables with children around. The only other downside was the cleanliness of this place. Everything I touched had this sticky layer of grime. The table, the chairs, in fact the chairs looked like something was splashed on them at one point and never cleaned.

Stephanie C.,"Providence, RI",44,20,67,2.0,1/12/2015,Decided to get take out with a gift card from Friday's and it was an up and down experience. The cheese sticks are one of my favorite items on the menu and they were fresh and delicious as usual. However the entrees were a bit disappointing. The Philly Stacked Burger wasn't cooked to order and appeared to be sitting for awhile as the bun was very soggy still not horrible. The 6oz sirloin was cooked very well. I got the side tomato mozzarella salad and all it came with was a piece of fresh mozzarella and a few cherry tomatoes. The portion size was incredibly small compared to what you get with other sides.  I also asked for an add on of a lobster tail and the waitress taking my order stated they didn't have it but then added they can top it with lobster. I was confused but still took her up on her offer and was disappointed again. For the extra money to only get a few tiny pieces of lobster was a joke but they'll keep me coming back if only for their cheese sticks.

Rebecca R.,"Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico",87,161,11,2.0,9/24/2012,"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants.  There is nothing very unique or special about them and I am always looking for what makes a restaurant stand out. My girlfriend wanted to meet here for dinner, so I agreed since who doesn't love a night out with friends? I have to say I'd rate the place 5 stars if it was on service alone.  Our waitress was an absolute doll and checked on us frequently, enough to where it wasn't overbearing, but enough to keep our drinks full and our table clean. The food was nothing to write home about.  We ordered a nacho chip appetizer.  The chips were lackluster and we didn't even end up finishing them.  They had some melted cheese on them and were served in a small bowl.  Honestly for 9.99 i could have popped my own chips with cheese in a microwave and called it a day. I ordered some chicken and shrimp dish with mashed potatoes for dinner.  Again, nothing special here.  The chicken tasted a little funky and there was so much garlic I swear I had heartburn... great service, not so great food",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=40

My mother and I were greeted at the door and shown to a booth right away by a friendly hostess. Drinks orders were taken soon after while we were left to peruse the menus. I got water with lemon. The water quality wasn't great so it needed that lemon. It might be worth noting that they brought my lemon on a plate and later when my mom ordered a glass her lemon already came floating so not consistent in this way if it maters to you. We decide to split this fancy club sandwich that has bacon and avocodo on it ($10ish) and do do a tasting trio ($15) of thai pork tacos, mac & cheese bites, and chicken hibatchi skewers. Our waitress was really considerate in actually bringing the sandwich and fries out portioned on two plates. The fries looked a little barren when split between two but the sandwich was definitely large enough to satisfy along with the apps. I really enjoyed the skewers and mac & cheese bites (oh god the mac and cheese bites were so good) but my mom really liked the thai pork tacos so I was able to negotiate for extra mac & cheese bites to my benefit.  Overall really good service and food. No real complaints to speak of.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=40
Richard L.,"North Attleborough, MA",0,258,,3.0,2/9/2015,"This review is based partly on nostalgia. As an previous yelp post stated this building  is of the earliest TGI Fridays's built which make it worth a visit if only to check out the layout.  Back in the early eighties many TGI Fridays were located in historic buildings in large downtowns while a few found home in specially designed square buildings in the out lying suburbs . These early suburban buildings were often three open floors with multi-level dining. This Warwick location was the latter and was built in a field far away from the yet fully developed rt.  2. In fact , the surrounding shopping center was added years later and  originally this TGI Friday could only be accessed  from rt 117. I believe this Friday's was also one of the first national restaurant chains to come in Warwick if not all of RI.  History aside this location's  food i and service is up to par with the the other Fridays. Some things have changed . Sunday brunch is no longer offered but the coffee has really improved greatly through the years, as in they must have switched brands. To me the variety  and quality of of desserts ( think frozen or prepackaged) were never great (see menu). I found on my last visit the refillable drink soup, salad, bread stick , lunch is no longer offered which was a disappointment. At the times of my many visits  the dining area and restroom were clean and the staff were fine.  Unfortunately, in my opinion  Friday's  in general, have seem to lost their luster and uniqueness  with their rapid expansion in multiple locations. .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=40

Chelsea P.,"Lithia, FL",81,50,6,1.0,3/19/2014,"Usually love Fridays for their Jack Daniels steak but this visit was beyond awful.  When we first arrived their was no hostess at the door and there were 3 groups waiting to be sat. The restaurant was pretty empty as it was a Sunday night at 7pm. We were finally sat at our table, and then waited about five minutes for our waitress to show up. Then after placing our drink order it took another 10 minutes for them to arrive and for her to take our appetiser and entree order. When our appetisers arrived, at different times we didn't have silverware. So we grabbed silverware off another table near us and caught the attention of the manager who said, you guys were day without silverware? Yes we were...to which he said seriously? And walked away.  Our entrees arrived on time but were pretty lacklustre. Needless to say we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=40

Kristi L.,"Concord, CA",60,227,13,2.0,12/29/2012,"Sometimes I wonder if there should be a different rating scale for chain restaurants a la Ruby Tuesday's, Applebee's, Chili's etc. - you just can't compare them using the same 5 point scale to other local places. That said, I'll try. If not for a $25 gift card received at Christmas, I likely would have NEVER gone to Friday's - I really prefer local holes-in-the-wall over any kind of chain. However, $25 is $25 so we went.  My husband and I showed up at 7:00 pm on a Friday night, so we were fully expecting a wait. You can imagine our concern when we walked in and were seated immediately. This was a little TOO easy. Our waitress came by after our party was complete, asking if we wanted beverages. We all ordered drinks and put in for an appetizer of the Tuscan Spinach Dip (which from what I could tell is basically the same spinach and artichoke dip you'd find anywhere). About 1/2 way through the appetizer we asked for napkins as it appeared we didn't have those nor silverware on the table. The waitress didn't check in again until we were wrapping up the appetizer, and I had to remind her about the napkins we had been waiting on. We never actually got the napkins until the appetizer was gone. We did get silverware moments before our meals came, which were okay - no real complaints, but I certainly wasn't wowed by anything I ate. I was, however, anxious to try the Salted Caramel Cake for dessert. Unfortunately, our waitress wasn't to be seen for quite some time (I lied, I saw her flirting in the kitchen with some guy she had no chance with...sorry honey). Anyway, she was passing by our table in a mad dash nearly 20 minutes after we had finished eating, and my husband literally had to stop her in her tracks to ask for the check. We couldn't fathom paying with a card knowing how long everything else took that evening, so we put down some cash and were ready to leave.  The waitress popped right over when she saw green on the table, of course. Figures.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=40

Chrystianna A.,"Cranston, RI",435,21,5,1.0,7/22/2015,"I am a server myself so I pride myself on my empathy towards servers when I go out but this was by far the worst experience I've ever had. The hostess sat my friend and I in a section far away from the door where no one else was. She was very sweet. The server, Meghan (or some sort of spelling,) took 15 minutes to greet us. 15 MINUTES. Whatever she came over with her blonde hair completely down, really greasy, and gross. She was running her fingers through her hair while chewing gum talking to us. We ordered our drinks and before we could say we wanted to place our appetizer she ran away. 5 minutes went by. 10 minutes went by. 15 minutes to get our drinks!!! My drink was some sort of flavored tea and boy was it nasty. I asked for another one with less syrup. Another 10 minutes. They had an appetizer deal that you could pay $12 to have unlimited apps, my friend and I thought it over and decided against it and ordered a single order of mac and cheese fried balls. We saw Meghan walk by us with several orders of the appetizer we ordered but none of them made it to our table. We didn't get our appetizer until after the food that another server brought out. She never once checked in on us to see how everything came out (after waiting another 1/2 hour.) Our food was amazing, I can at least say that. We had to flag down another server to get to go boxes and to ask for our check. After another lump sum of time we received our check, did I mention she basically spit all over my friend and I? We looked it over and there was a $12 appetizer charge with four refills (meaning that four more orders of the Mac and cheese balls were ordered on our check.) We barely received one of them. Every time we saw her walking by us with the appetizers she was eating them! WHAT!!! And then to have the nerve to try to make us pay for them!! We had to talk to the manager who was very professional and helpful who not only fixed our bill but took off a lot of it for our trouble. On the bottom of the recipe was a survey that I was going to fill out to tell them about our horrible experience when she ripped it out of my hand. I will never ever be back and if you ever decided to go request not to be sat with Meghan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-warwick-2?start=40

Now, small, pre-frozen chunks of, what tasted like cardboard, were served.I realize these aps are intended to be loss leaders, but management...wake TFU! not good! You need to make these aps so good, people want to come back. We had these tonight and decided not to order the Jack Daniels burger and salmon. I will say in spite of the appetizers, the bartenders, Dee and Steph and the Manager,Jeff all was good. They listened, empathized and understood where we were coming from.

I went in for dinner with a party of 3 and my daughter at 6:14pm, I could see that it was very busy and asked the hostess the wait, she stated 5-10 mins. I put my name in and walked out to get my party, came back in and we sat down. I kept seeing people get seated including people that arrived after so after waiting for almost 30 mins I go up the hostess. Dumbfounded she has no idea who I am and if I ever wrote my name down, she couldn't find her sheet of where she put my mind. After finally finding it she states she crossed me off. NOW I'm livid and after going back and forth for a little bit she tries to rectify the situation and immediately Sears my party and I. Once seated the waitress Emily sits us and I order all waters and an apply juice and ask to speak the manager. After a short wait Deb the manager came over and apologized for the wait and offered a free appetizer. Emily took out order and came back with drinks. We waited an additional 20 minutes for our appetizer and maybe another 15 minutes later our food arrived. I ordered the buffalo wingman's burger well done.. when the burger arrived, I took one bite and saw this burger came out rare. Emily was notified and she offered to bring it back and rush them to make it.. WELL NO, it took another 20 minutes and at this point I didn't even want it. Once the burger arrived again it was overly done, to the point it was just burned! I didn't want to make another scene so I just took the burger but I am SO upset at the service tonight and I could noticeably see other patrons felt the same.
