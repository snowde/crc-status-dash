Katie K.,"Clarksville, TN",1,33,,5.0,7/27/2012,"After trying this place a few times in other states, we were nervous about giving this one a chance.  We are so happy we did, and this is one of our favorite restaurants to eat at in Watertown, NY now. The newer menu is fabulous with a lot of yummy options.  The new Pretzel App. is SO good.  We did have one bad experience with being over charged and not noticing it, but upon our next visit we informed our waiter who took care of us- they went above and beyond to make it up to us and appologized.  Free drinks (anything we wanted), and took $5 off our whole order.   The waiters are all pretty friendly and its a clean place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2?start=20
Ryan R.,"Massena, NY",1,7,7,4.0,4/7/2014,The food here is always great.  Drinks are a little expensive (but good) The host(ess) opens the door for you and really make you feel welcome. Bathrooms could be cleaner........but i've seen way worse in other restaurants.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2?start=20
Tonia R.,"Pulaski, NY",3,8,,2.0,10/31/2013,"My husband and I went out for a nice dinner and were sadly disappointed.  We were not greeted when we arrived, but sat at our seat as an afterthought. Our waitress was nice, but very busy.  My ""sizzling""  chicken was cold and covered in a square processed cheese slice and the mashed potatoes were  as cold  as if they came from the refrigerator.   I did ask for a replacement and the manager came over to apologize and offered me a free desert.  When the new food came, the cheese was burnt and had no flavor.  They offer a military discount, but because I had ordered a special from the menu, we were not able to receive it.  We will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2?start=20
Nicki F.,"Philadelphia, NY",39,17,4,2.0,4/18/2014,"I love the fact that the hostess opens the door for you. That's a small gesture, but it's very nice as I was holding the hand of a toddler who does the opposite of what I request.  My server was phenomenal, personable, and polite.  She was also training someone else too.  We got the pretzels and cheese - divine!  For dinner, my husband and I got steak with shrimp and the toddler had chicken and pita bread.  The toddler's chicken was good, but the pieces were SUPER small.  Our steaks were good, but for some reason, we could tell they pounded them down flat - it was weird.  My husband thinks it was so that we would think they are bigger than what they were.  The shrimp was decent, but it they were supposed to be scampi and they were more just dipped in their bruschetta sauce.  My husband's glass was broken/chipped at the top.  My wine glass was dirty from top to stem.  They have decent food and the cleanliness isn't top of the line.  It's really not the best example of TGI Friday's, but it's not the worst place in Watertown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2?start=20
Billy S.,"Allen, TX",7,94,4,5.0,8/31/2012,"Probably the best restaurant in Watertown, the menu has a lot to choose from, the prices are very reasonable and the place is clean. Almost always the server is on point and friendly. Never have walked away with a bad experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2?start=20
Julianne T.,"Evans Mills, NY",0,4,,3.0,8/24/2012,"This was my first time at TGI Friday's. Our server was a little slow, but nice. They had such a large menu selection, that I was kind of clueless at first on what I was going to order. They had a 12.99 3 course special going on so I just decided to go with that and order the oriental chicken spaghetti dish as my entree, pot stickers as my appetizer, & the vanilla bean cheese cake for dessert. The oriental spaghetti was OK, but I was not a big fan of it. I've got to say that it was worth the price for the amount of food that I got though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2?start=20
Jessica W.,"Prague, Czech Republic",82,362,105,4.0,2/21/2011,"I was pleasantly surprised when I came here last week. Last time I was at a TGI Friday's, it was underwhelming...maybe that's why my last visit was 5-8 years ago. I wasn't terribly hungry, but plenty on the menu sounded good to me! For a chain, I was impressed with their combinations and choices. I ordered the Dragonfire Chicken and thought it was delicious! I am actually going to try and replicate it at home. It was a spicy glazed chicken breast with a pineapple salsa over basmati rice and broccoli. It really was good. The portion wasn't huge because it was one of TGI Friday's ""right portion, right price"" features. But it was the perfect size for me. Everyone else seemed happy with their meals: a burger with fries, barbecue chicken wrap and a pasta dish. Our server was great too. The manager came over to check on us and she was also very personable and didn't have that super uppity over-the-top personality that I loathe oh so much. Oh the music they were playing cracked me up because it was all hip-hop from the late 90s/early 2000s. Didn't expect that at all and had a good time with the ol ""OMG do you remember THIS song?"" game. Would definitely go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2?start=20
Isabelle L.,"Wheeling, IL",23,499,4,3.0,3/18/2010,"Nothing special, just a typical TGI Fridays with good service, good atmosphere. You know what to expect and you get it with no surprise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2?start=20
Joe S.,"Jamesville, NY",0,16,1,2.0,4/29/2012,Second time we've been there. This visit wasn't quite so good. Took the wait staff 30 minutes to bring a cup of milk for a three year old; two salads were brought 15 minutes apart; finally nothing came to the table even warm - nothing like a cold appetizer. Maybe it was someone's first day.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2?start=20
Kate E.,"Augusta, ME",0,16,,4.0,5/21/2012,"Pretty good food, relatively quick to get it out to you, have had better experiences there than at other TGIs in other locations.

Jacob W.,"Watertown, NY",53,9,,5.0,9/11/2017,We always order the Jack Daniels boneless wings. Endless apps are always our go-to. Love the service and the servers are always very friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2
Kdog R.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,19,,1.0,6/15/2017,"Where do I start?  They messed up our endless apps order 4 times.  We kept asking for drink refills, but the waitress told us she was busy fixing our bill because she charged the table next to us their bill.  The table on the other side of us waited 45 minutes for their food, never got it and walked out.  We were given conflicting information about the certain menu items from  2 different staff members.  They left items off our bill at the end.  Over all this was a TERRIBLE experience, I will never go back.  Oh yea, this was a Wednesday night with about 8 customers in the place.  Steer clear at all costs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2
Jen S.,"Syracuse, NY",46,218,202,1.0,8/19/2016,"There are few places I've walked in and walked out of. In an attempt to humor the kids we went here briefly. Upon asking if we could get the table wiped down since it was obviously dirty with wet rings of condensation and chip crumbs the hostess looked dumbfounded and said ""uhhhh"" then she came back with a sopping wet rag and slipped the table Leaving a lake. My husband returned from the bathroom and said we needed to leave and possibly call the health department. We left. No thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2

Daniel R.,"Fort Drum, NY",42,10,1,5.0,8/10/2016,This place is great. We didn't have an annoying waitress. The food was great and very quick. I can't understand how some of you tards complain this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2
Tiffany T.,"Fort Leonard Wood, MO",53,226,27,4.0,5/18/2016,"It is always a good time when I go to Friday's. I love sitting at the bar because the bar tenders are always very accommodating, especially the male with glasses. One time he gave my girlfriend and I a free drink because TGI Friday's was coming out with a new drink and he wanted us to try it.  My two favorite dishes to order are the Jack Daniels Burger or the California Club Sandwich. Both are delicious and the french fries are really yummy too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2
Joseph J.,"Gloucester, MA",0,12,16,1.0,1/1/2016,I felt the place was sub standard run like by some rookies food was burnt buns fries that were like leftovers cooked sloppy 3 burger 1 appetizer 1 drink 75 bucks not worth it  the waitress Sophia was absent and the place wasn't even buzy,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2
Tara Y.,"Amherstview, Canada",36,55,311,2.0,11/29/2013,"Crazy busy night as it was one of few restaurants open late on the eve of Black Friday. We had about a 20 minute wait before being seated and were sat by a table right by front door(breeze was chilllly) Server was pleasant but SLOW...gave us appetizer plates, with food crusted to it. The food was o.k and yes only o.k The bathrooms were filthy...to the point i turned the water on with my elbow to avoid touching anything  and the garbage can under sink where you put hand towels was overflowing and the sink area was a mess of soap and water...will never be a choice of mine next time visiting Watertown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2
Brittany C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",3,20,31,1.0,3/15/2015,"This is seriously the worst Friday's I have ever been to service wise. Food is okish though. Are server was Allison and she didn't listen for 90% of the time. She even walked away right in the middle of us ordering so I had to yell ""hey"" to grab her attention. Then the food came out, I ordered the endless $12 apps and told her that I didn't want them all at once. But sure enough they came all came at once. And the wings I ordered weren't even hot. She also never refilled our drinks even though I asked her three times.  To say the least it was so bad I didn't leave a tip which I always do but that service was just terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2
Aaron T.,"Philadelphia, NY",28,371,136,4.0,1/14/2016,"We always go here. It's spot on with every other TGI Fridays. Fun place. Always a line and you have to wait.

Elma M.,"Columbia, SC",0,7,,1.0,8/20/2015,"Service is terrible every time I go there's either something wrong with the food or the service.

Shone W.,"Watertown, NY",9,6,1,1.0,9/27/2015,"We usually have such a great time and food here. Our waiter was Mike, a lil to fast in his mind for service. There was no wait and we went straight in for our table. Mike swung in for our drink orders, a party of 5, and two of them being waters, no alcoholic drinks and it took about 15 min to receive them. I politely asked for straws, he gave us four. He darted off so I thought yeah my straw will be there in a moment. It never materialized so we asked a waitress in passing for one. He then took our orders, nothing fancy. I asked for gravy on my mashed potatoes, he came back 15 min later and told me they were out of gravy I went to tell him I wanted a different side but he was gone and out of ear shot. I ordered the Jack Daniels ribeye and shrimp, mashed potatoes with gravy, and macaroni and cheese. The stars of the plate were the steak and macaroni and cheese. When our meals were delivered everything was alright except for my potatoes, they were cold. Like two ice cream scoops and out of the fridge. And we did not have any silverware to eat with. Our drinks were half full and he (Mike) filled one of the waters he did not ask anyone else nor did he give any of us a chance to ask due to his speed by the table. We were entertaining our son and his girlfriend they were eating before homecoming.  We did the same the year prior and it was wonderful results. They sat in a different section, their waiter had a big beard and according to the kids he was awesome! So cuddos to the Beard! Sitting at my table was our visiting sister-in-law.  She pointed out a cleaning cloth that was on the floor. It was sitting there a good 20 min. Everyone was just stepping around or over it. If it were a snake it would have bitten someone. The table beside us left. After clearing off the table Brandon a waiter in the next section, picked up the wash cloth and started wiping down the table. She said that was just on the floor why are you using it on the table? He then states that's not where it came from yes it is she said. Now I am embarrassed and frankly not the word I want to use but ticked off. He grumbled under his voice and went to get a new was cloth, at least that is what one hopes. He then had the gumption to tell a fellow waitress what was said 2 tables in front of me. Brother I was a waiter, retired Army, and I can read lips very good at that short of a distance. Not to mention the waitress he was complaining to turned around and counted the tables and looked me dead in my eyes. I hate to be embarrassed in public, period. There was a menu on the floor as well and without wiping it off or anything just handed it to the next table he sat. My family made there way out and I stepped into the bar area and requested to speak to a manager. The male bartender got me the manager, I failed to get her name, blame it on the anger but she was very nice and polite and said she would handle the situation. I will be doing my survey from the receipt later today. You bet your bottom dollar this will be apart of it. All in all what used to be a great place to eat now falls into the Ponderosa catagory, eat at your own risk. I believe that will be my last visit, 26 September 2015.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2
Mandy R.,"Fairbanks, AK",39,43,389,2.0,9/26/2013,"Was not impressed. I had better food & service at the T.G.I. Fridays in Afghanistan! The caesar salad was literally iceberg lettuce with a really terrible ""caesar dressing"". Was not premixed, I had to mix it up myself, and it came with tomatoes-not normal. Also, cost $3.19 extra to add it onto my meal-what a joke.  We got the Tuscan Spinach Dip & the chips they brought out with it were all stale.  For being one of four other tables we waited an unreasonable amount of time for drinks (ordered water)-at least 15min, waited 25min for one appetizer, and 45min for our two meals.  With all the other options in Watertown, this place did not make it to my ""return to"" list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2

Kimberley M.,"Kingston, Canada",47,464,108,3.0,5/29/2013,"I've been to TGI Friday's in other locations before, and I like the consistency from location to location. Staff are friendly, prices are reasonable, water glasses are never empty.  The day we visited this location, it was pouring out, and the hostess kindly stepped out to the entryway to greet us and open the door so we could get out of the rain quickly - a small gesture, but one that is noticed and appreciated.  Our waitress was one of the most upbeat persons I've ever met. I had a salad with chicken on it, and it was very tasty. The only reason I can't give 4 stars here is that despite it being a late lunch (1:30PM) service was a bit slow, and we waited a considerable length of time for our meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2
John D.,"Fort Drum, NY",44,14,4,3.0,1/23/2015,For a chain restaurant it was good.  Family of three split the 3-for-all appetizer which was a decent amount of food.  Also ordered the all American cheeseburger...not bad.  My son loves this place so I'm sure we'll be back!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2
Upstate Y.,"Potsdam, NY",13,294,356,3.0,10/13/2014,"I got the JD burger and it was pretty decent.  The service was great too.  We needed to get in and out quickly as we were traveling through and were late, the server was super fast and got our bill to us in a millisecond.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2
Kathie C.,"Fort Campbell, KY",2,14,,1.0,1/7/2015,"Not impressed with this Friday's here. Last time we visited on a Saturday night, they ran out of ribs! Then I ordered the salmon with the rice pilaf and the waitress did not bother to tell me they have also ran out of the rice pilaf. She brought my plate with just plain white rice and when I asked she said ""oh we ran out"". Why didn't she come and notify me before bringing the order to the table? I would have gladly chosen another side. Then my husband's order was also wrong! Not sure what was going on in the kitchen that night, but we will not be back for a looooong time if at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2
B T.,"Sackets Harbor, NY",0,2,,1.0,3/31/2016,Well went to get endless appts. We don't eat out much being a family of 8 and I not able to eat much but kids and I wanted to have a nice night out for a change so we go and first get there order our drinks which is good I have a martini since my hubby was there to drive usually I pour into cup but waitress went to do it without a warning because I take out some of the cotton candy because it can be to sweet sometimes so I was fine with that we place orders and I say make sure to put in potstickers so that they come right after we finish the spinach dip well almost an hour later I am informed they are out of potstickers so I didn't eat that night my husband who also ordered them didn't get any I said didn't u out the order in she says no I didn't when u said to. Well they took my order off the menu and I go away hungry but yet hubby still had to pay for his and he didn't even get any but I guess since he had the green beans they figure to charge him. I had to step out for a min and to find out mozz sticks where missy and loaded taters where burnt and rock hard but my kids didn't want to complain because they where taught to appreciate things but $100.00 and to walk away a hungry and no care at all from the place we will not be returning there ever again. I gave them 1 star because the burgers that 2 of my kids got they said where good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-watertown-2
