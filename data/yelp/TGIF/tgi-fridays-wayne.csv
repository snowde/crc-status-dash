Lovely L.,"Union City, NJ",85,59,8,5.0,1/13/2018,"I came to this location last night with a few friends and family to celebrate my birthday. Our waiter was pleasant and patient considering we can be difficult lol. Our food came out on a timely manner and everything was delicious. The most memorable part of the evening is when the manager, Anthony came to visit our table. He was so positive and amazing and we all loved him. He was the exact type of manager that all restaurants should have. I will def be coming back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne

Lisa B.,"Pompton Plains, NJ",276,177,291,3.0,3/7/2017,Ordered a Cobb salad for lunch last week and it was good. The avocado was a greenish brown but not terrible.. service was fine.

First, we ordered appetizers... 25 minutes later they bring our sampler to the table, it was ok....... then I don't see the server for 20 minutes. I have to go get my own beer from the bar, only to see our server hangin out on his phone giggling like a little kid. I decide to go on a rant to the bartender how I haven't seen my server in 20 minutes. She was very nice. Manager comes over to the table, and apologizes and says he's going to take 20% off the bill. Very nice of him.. entrees come.. wife asks for a steak medium, it comes out looking like a piece of charcoal. Sister in law gets a salad, another mistake as it has brown lettuce.

Morgan G.,"New York, NY",92,110,6,1.0,2/21/2017,"Oy, Friday's. I came in on a Saturday during early happy hour with my husband to meet a couple of our friends for drinks and a quick bite. Easy, right? I've been to this Friday's before and had an okay experience at a table in the bar, but sitting at the bar this time, the experience was completely reversed. There were three servers behind the bar but for some reason, we couldn't get ANY service. When we finally did, we didn't order anything crazy (I don't think).. Glass of wine, one specialty cocktail, a beer and a black & tan.  The wine glass was dirty and there was debris floating in the bottom of it.  Almost like it was  used for sangria, and there was leftover fruit in it.  Unfortunately, I didn't notice until I was at the end of my glass.  (GAG.)   We brushed it off and tried to order some appetizers and a second round of drinks, but the waiter kept walking by us without even so much as glancing in our direction, and we sat right next to the servers' entrance to the bar.  With three people behind the bar, and the bar seats only about 70% occupied, there's NO reason we should have waited 15-20 minutes to flag him down for refills. Bartending 101 - if a glass is empty, ask if they want a refill. The more we drink, the more the bar makes. If we weren't already on a time crunch, I would have just bounced and went to Bahama Breeze for better service and quality. Anyways after 20 mins, my husband finally flagged him down and he looked downright ANNOYED and even huffed a little bit. (WTF dude?)  My husband ordered boneless wings, and we got an order of mozzarella sticks for the group.  Drinks finally came out after yet another 5 minutes (so now here's almost 30 mins of waiting for a refill), and the wings came out with the bone-in instead of boneless. I get it - restaurants get busy, people make mistakes... but when you have multiple people behind a bar, leave 4 customers (who could easily have spent $25+ each if you let us) hanging dry, AND provide dirty glasses and mess up an order WITH an attitude? Bye, Felicia. We aren't coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne

Now onto the $10 unlimited Apps~ we got boneless chicken wings with jack Daniels sauce, dumplings, potato skins, mozzarella sticks, and the barbecue chicken flatbread! The only 2 that were ok were the skins and dumplings, everything was horrible! They had one waiter Adam, the kid was trying to handle every table on his own so therefore everyone suffered, we waited for Apps (which arrived ice cold)  and asked for another drink which he didn't bring until we were done trying to pick through the worst appetizers ever!

Kimberly T.,"Lincoln Park, NJ",136,84,442,3.0,5/7/2017,"I've been to this branch often as this is the closest one by me. Last time i dined in was with my husband and we usually get an ok service. As usually we enjoy their ribs with jack Daniels sauce. Appetizers here are something i enjoy too especially their spinach dip. But recently, we have been just taking our orders to go. Either via mobile or by phone. They always seem to forget adding the extra sauce i asked for so i when i ordered 1-2 weeks ago i finally checked before i left the place and sure enough the sauce was missed even though the one i spoke to over the phone said ""i got it"". Maybe FORGot it. Lol but anyway that was no big deal for me. However, as i have read some of other yelpers reviews we do have the same complaints, more or less, and that is service from the bar take sooooo soooo long. My goodness. Even though the bar is not full i always ended up having to wait a while. Unfortunately pick up is done there rather then from somewhere easier like by their computer or upfront even when its paid in full already. Their staff is nice and usually friendly i just dont know why they dont attend as fast as it looked like they could. Sometimes i see them chatting and i had to catch their attention or just wait for them to finish. although sometimes id think ""would they have seen me at least from their peripheral vision?"" Lol guess not. But anyway i hope they let their staff know about this or probably change location as to where food pickup should be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne

Mark S.,"Haledon, NJ",19,434,260,3.0,6/28/2015,"This was my first ever visit to a TGI Friday. It was a Saturday at noon and I had just returned from NYC to the park and ride lot. The hostess opened the door for me and welcomed me cheerfully. Seating is not spread out so it appeared everyone was seated all in one area. I ordered the cherry limeade and the chicken & shrimp pasta. I watched ESPN and listened to music which I couldn't quite make out. It actually played louder outside. They went with the exposed pipes decor rather than put in tiles, so sound travels quite a bit. The random wall decorations of Frankenstein's monster, Albert Einstein and an Atari 5200 game console didn't follow any kind of theme that I could think of.

No idea what took so long as they just pushed two 4 tops together and a few groups bigger than four were seated immediately. This place is not good. The service was slow and the food was low level frozen crap.  Four people ordered burgers . One medium, two medium-well and one well done (for a kid). You could crack walnuts with all four.  The chicken in the pecan crusted chicken salad was drier than the Gobi desert.

At this location, food is always good, service is always friendly. It is clean and inviting.  This past visit, my friend and I ordered the flat iron steak which we both requested ""medium."" However, when they came out, they were clearly well, well done. It happens once in a while and we were about to flag down our waiter, but before we could, one of the managers came over. ""I noticed you didn't look happy when cutting into your steaks."" We politely told him that we had ordered medium and that these were clearly well done. ""Yes they certainly are,"" he said. ""I will get you some new ones. I completely understand, I am a medium rare guy myself, and you did not look happy. Let me fix this for you."" Our steaks came back, he had us cut into them in front of him and they were perfect. It's very rare for chain restaurants to have such attention to detail. Most will begrudgingly fix the problem if you ask, but not many will notice there is a problem before you say something. Service gets 5 stars.

The atmosphere shouts ""IT'S FRIDAY!!!"", even though it was Thursday. I had a strawberry milkshake, which was really good!  The thing that I wanted to emphasize which really bothered me was when some of the waiters came to sing happy birthday to my friend. The looks on their faces gave the impression that they didn't want to be there, or they didn't want to sing happy birthday. They were clapping and singing as if someone were forcing them to!   I know it may sound a little silly, but if it's your birthday, your special day, you would want it to be more special.

The place inside and outside is always well kept and clean.  Staff is always young and friendly and greet you with a smile.  They also seem very energetic, from the hostess to the waiters and waitresses.  Kitchen area is always clean and decor is typical Friday's with stuff all over the wall and ceiling.

David W.,"Hicksville, NY",24,2,,2.0,2/5/2016,"My French dip sandwich was see thru amounts of meat - don't order!!! The burgers and chicken dishes seemed ok.  Manager did ""fix"" my order but I was very disappointed at this NJ TGIF vs ones in NY.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne?start=20
Vince M.,"Pequannock, NJ",11,125,281,4.0,1/12/2014,"This restaurant in the chain has undergone major beneficial changes.  Today, I enjoyed the most tender 10 ounce sirloin steak I've ever had their. It was juicy and made precisely to my order. Also, the portions are normal-sized rather than monstrous. This makes for a much better experience. The service was absolutely outstanding! I would definitely go there again, and again, and again. What's more, and this may seem minor to many, they're tostitos and salsa were absolutely wonderful. The salsa was freshly made right there, and the tostitos were free of extra grease oil and salt. They were just excellent!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne?start=20
Aleks B.,"Wayne, NJ",0,33,32,2.0,4/18/2015,"Potatoes weren't real, but from powder. Rib eye was half overcooked, half undercooked. Unfriendly stuff makes me not recommend this place for visit.  Waiter didn't know any answers to my questions about food, took plate too early and so on Avoid this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne?start=20
Stacy P.,"Little Ferry, NJ",189,73,160,5.0,11/8/2015,Was here a few weeks ago. This review is solely on the waitress Jess. She was supper friendly and provided the best customer service I've ever had at a Friday's. Koodoos to this Friday's for having an awesome waitress.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne?start=20
Bridgett S.,"Pequannock Township, NJ",23,115,3,1.0,2/2/2017,"Horrible!!! Went on Tuesday with hubby for lunch. Not busy at all. In fact one other table eating in dining room besides us. We had spinach dip as appetizer. Was cold and stringy with stale chips. Hubby ordered Cajun chicken pasta. Obviously microwaved. He wasn't to happy with the way it tasted. I had half a rack of ribs with side salad instead of fries. Ribs must've been pre cooked and left under heat lamp. They were dried out and hard as hell! Salad was brown, yes brown lettuce with 1 grape tomato cut in half 2 croutons, and 6 blades of cheese no lie. They also forgot the dressing. Had to ask food runner to get it because server disappeared. Ordered Pepsi and there was something black sticking to the inside of glass. Got up to hunt for server and food runner came out asking what the problem was. I asked where server was and she was sitting in bar area texting on her phone. Food runner brought another soda. Had to again hunt for server for check. Both our stomachs were sick after that shitty meal and shitty service by server!! Avoid!! Used to be good... guess they stopped caring about their business!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne?start=20

Roger C.,"Florham Park, NJ",1,32,8,2.0,7/30/2016,"This was ny favorite  weekend  spot.  Apparently  there are new owners  and service is slipping fast. When the sisters abd the lady were there.  Food was awesome  and never a mistake Two weekends  ago I went and ordered  a tuna salad on a bagel. I get home and the tuna salad was spread  on lile a pat of butter no exaggeration.  So thin of a spread you could barely bsee it. I actually  went back band they fixed it. I usually wouldn't  make a fuss but the tuna  salad was the main event  of the sandwich.  So they were  good and corrected  the issue. I gave them the benefit  of the doubt.  I went back today. I asked again why the ladies weren't around.  Didn't  getva straight  answer.  I ordered  tuna sald bavon and cheese, they left off  the cheese abd added tomato ?  I also got a ham egg abd cheese . And left off the cheese.  They also forgot  the hash browns after they event  wrote it down  on the ticket.  I guesss ill have to go to Goldbergs even if its further.  They  never dissapoint. Whoever the new owners  are. Keep it together  because you are loosing  long term  customers.  That place has a good reputation  until recently",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne?start=20
Mike P.,"Randolph, NJ",215,605,327,3.0,7/10/2013,"So i really like Fridays, im a stripes member so i eat for free every now and then. The food is fairly standardized and while some places have better specials then other they are about the same.  I came here with a friend to just have a bit and a few beers. I think i had one beer, and one of our two apps never came. We weren't charged for it but a little annoying. The waiter that night might have also hated his job. He made a few jokes but told us out right he didn't want to be there.   Food was good, so cant complain but im sure it would have been as good at any other friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-wayne?start=20
