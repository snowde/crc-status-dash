Natalie O.,"Leeds, United Kingdom",37,251,81,3.0,9/15/2013,"The usual chain food, staff were lovely and accommodating to our short time in between cinema screening. The restaurant is massive and decorated in the usual over the top American bric a brac. They do a cheaper set menu but it is a little pricey in comparison to other places in Xscape. It's the lovely staff that got it 3 stars rather than 2. Not that the food wasn't good it just wasn't worth the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-west-york
