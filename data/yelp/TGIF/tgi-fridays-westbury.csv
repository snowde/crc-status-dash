Miss F R.,"Queens, NY",0,7,2,1.0,12/26/2017,"my co-workers and I placed an online order. when we got there to pick it up the order wasn't ready and mind you they gave us a time of pick.

The Cesar salad has quite a kick to it so it is not for me. The burger was great. The dessert is a Oreo ice cream cookie. The only thing is it isn't an ice cream cookie that you can pick up. You have to use a fork. The top and bottom are Oreo cookie crumb and the center is Oreo ice cream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=20
Sakshi S.,"Hicksville, NY",17,5,,1.0,10/8/2017,Don't even deserve one star . Waitress was not helpful with the menu at all. To much attitude not friendly at all.  I'm  was there with my friends . My friends order unlimited apps but got one time server at the table . On top of that snack portions are so small what are you expecting a person to eat . Makes no sense not at all. But then manger came n took the app off from the cheq which is a courtesy I appreciate it.

Silvestre R.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,,1.0,10/11/2017,If i could give 0 stars i would. This place is ridiculous. I came here today same day as this post a Wednesday. The place is practically empty and i have a party of 13. The waitress cant remember her name only checked on us because i called the restaurant and had a manager come to us. Were pressed for time trying to catch a nets game at the collisium. It took 30 minutes to get drinks mind you 4 of those drinks are waters. We all order endless apps and each app has taken 20 to 25 minutes to get. The place is empty doesnt make sense and the manager made up a bs excuse for the reason for it. The service here was horrible and i go to many fridays worked at a applebees before and never seen this before. Im not one to write horrible reviews but this is out of hand. Im not gunna say not to go here but if you do please prepare for shit service,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=20

Brian T.,"Westbury, NY",144,212,162,2.0,10/4/2016,So much for a quick lunch. I felt like a red headed step child as my server barely came to see me. Maybe because it was the lunch rush but there was not that many people in his section. He forgot about my drink and then forgot about my side salad as it came after my meal was done. Plus it took forever to complete this whole meal. Wanted so long in between points during. Also I feel like if you are not getting a burger or one of their highlight meals the food is literally just thrown the together. I have been to much better fast casual places. Sadly I can't say with certainty that I will return to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=20

Diana Q.,"Babylon, NY",355,785,1396,3.0,12/28/2015,"Visit Date: December 26, 2015 Came here the day after Christmas with my friends who were visiting from Colorado and my best friend. I had to be healthy so I ordered the harvest salad without chicken because I'm a vegetarian and a side of spinach.  Our waitress was very nice but I asked for the spinach about 3 times before it actually did come out. I was disappointed in the spinach. It tasted okay but it was drenched in oil and served with Parmesan cheese on top of it with mushrooms and onions. Maybe they could have made it a little healthier before they killed the nutritional value of all the veggies.  The salad was pretty small. They served it in a bigger bowl but I would have liked to have more of everything.  So Friday's is a really hard place to order healthy in but I was trying my best because I'm working with my nutritionist. Sometimes I will indulge in what I want but I eat out too often to indulge all the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=20
Mary V.,"Manhattan, NY",18,4,,1.0,8/9/2017,"This restaurant did not have items clearly on the menu. Not food sensitive friendly. I didn't want red onions, and I got red onions. I wanted my steak well done, and it was really burned on the outside and pink on the inside. I was supposed to get an ""aged cheese plate,"" and I got bleu cheese. Not only was my order wrong, but it took forever to come out. To top it off, the ordering app waiter's use is incredibly inefficient, so this awful stay was unnecessarily prolonged. I've always enjoyed going to Friday's, but this experience has made me never want to step foot in one again. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=20
Shari P.,"Hempstead, NY",619,218,2276,4.0,9/29/2015,"Friday's is like the McDonald's of restaurants. This place is pretty much my #1 go-to spot whenever I'm hungry or just want to get some drinks. They do have decent drinks and there are usually a few specials going especially if you sit in the bar area.  This Westbury location is like the best location on Long Island. It's in the best area around the mall and there's usually never a dull moment in here.  I don't think I've ever had like a really horrible food experience here. However, most things taste microwaved or overcooked. It has to be that Jack Daniels sauce that keeps me coming back. I swear anything that sauce touches tastes 10x better than it did without it.

The bartenders and wait staff are always really nice and on their job. The food is always good and gets better and better every time I come. I have the app which makes coming here that much better.

Amanda H.,"JAMAICA, NY",114,39,105,1.0,7/6/2017,"Though this Friday's is in a great location highly advise that you stay away from this establishment UNTIL they improve their services. First and foremost.....the staff needs to be re-trained on keeping any frustration or issues they are having with fellow employees behind closed doors. Second of all......the wait time for food needs to definitely be worked on. We waited for appetizers - simple appetizers at that - for an hour plus. The only reason we did not leave is because we were enjoying our drinks, hence the one star. What did it for me though, was that after that hour plus wait for the food.......the food came out cold. That is 100% unacceptable in my eyes after waiting all that time. I asked the manager to comp the food and told her that we would pay and tip for our drinks. She respected my request and I hope that she truly analyzes the feedback I provided her with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=20
Mandy R.,"Norwood, PA",74,6,,1.0,2/15/2017,"I went to visit my family in NY and we decided to go to Friday's in westbury.  We were sat at a table that was filled with crumbs and floor was sticky, since it was a cramped corner for our party of 9, we described the problems and asked to be moved.  We were moved. I cannot even get involved with how many complaints I have about this visit because there are too many, but I will just tell you the main parts. Our side of fries was forgotten and my sister finished all of her food before they finally brought the fries out when we reminded them that they forgot.  My meat was very pink and I ordered well done. The two coronas that my mother ordered with the waiter, were never brought to us. We had to go to the bar to retrieve the drinks ourselves (two separate times!)   Then when I went to use the restroom, there were 3 stalls. 1 of them did not lock, 1 did not have toilet paper and the final stall had feces literally spread all over the seat and piled inside the bowl. I am immediately went and found somebody to address the issue, I apologized for being the bearer of bad news and the hostess said to me "" it's OK, this happens on a weekly basis and I'm sure it's not nearly as bad as last week when I had to clean it"". Then I saw a female employee come from the bathroom removing her dirty gloves As she passed a bunch of tables WITH PEOPLE EATING.  I wish I took a picture of the table with crumbs and the sticky floor but I didn't know it would be the least of my problems. But I do have an image of the toilet. All 9 of us (my family, my sisters family and my parents) are extremely disappointed and turned off by the filthy conditions, the employee removing shitty gloves near tables and our waiter who forgot our fries/our mothers beers and never came to give us refunds or ask us if our food was alright ( which Had the waiter ever asked me how my meal was I could have sent back my steak instead I had to throw it away) We then had to find him for our check Very upset. Very very disappointed for four weeks now I was told ""Jess"" from guest relations would get back to me and never has.

Keiva M.,"NY, NY",73,73,115,1.0,4/28/2017,I have been here many times but this will be my LAST.  I was greeted so nice upon entering but that all went down hill at the bar. The bartender/barista was unattentive. I don't know if she was just overwhelmed but we waited awhile for service. We almost got up and left (btw she would have never noticed and  looked like others did the same) but I didn't want to be that person. She seemed more engaged with the guys around the bar but not the couples including us. Then she disappeared and I had to grab some other person to order more drinks and food. Both were not rude or mean but nonchalant about their job. I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble but apparently this location has a huge turnover in staff and it showed in service. Too many other establishments in the area to deal with mediocre service. I'm not on a desktop because if I was I'd give it a half star.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=20

Customer service is at an all time low.   We waited to be seated although there were numerous seats available.  Once seated we waited 15 minutes to witness waiters/waitresses approach and tend to 4 tables of people, who were seated after us. When we requested to speak to the manager,  we were blown off and told he was at a table. This information came from the 3 employees who were standing in the front of the restaurant doing absolutely nothing.  The manager was no help at all.

Theresa C.,"Long Beach, NY",75,6,,1.0,7/28/2017,"I wanted to write to you because this is the second negative experience I have had at this establishment. 2 years ago I had a horrible experience but I made the mistake of giving Fridays another chance. Let me explain my experience, walk in to an empty restaurant and was told I had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table, it took the waitress another 20 minutes to come to the table at which time we asked for water that never came. We eventually got the attention of a girl wiping down tables and asked her for water . We did finally get water 25 minutes later. Our waitress finally came with a horrible attitude, the plates from the appetizers were never cleared and our main dish was served leaving very little room on the table. The waitress never smiled the few times  we did see her which wasn't very often. I work in a profession that requires my staff to uphold values of providing excellent customer service. It seems that Fridays does not uphold these same values, and it is not getting any better with time. If  I could I would give it no stars.

The sticks were very tasty and not greasy. The potstickers were particularly good. There was a sauce provided for each part of the meal. My only complaint is that all the sauces blended on the small serving plates we were given, which gave some weird flavor combinations.

Ordered one endless app, the spinach dip and two entrees.  Everything but the dip came.  No explanation.  No followup. I thought it was sign that perhaps it wasn't necessary.  I will admit, I was bit irritated by the mishaps.  What got me was that the server was annoyed at me being irritated, as though this were my fault somehow.  I asked for the check and a to go container for the entree that we didn't finish.  The check came (incorrect amount), and no to go container. Asked him once again for the container, he said ""I'll take care of it.""  Came back with a container (no bag to put it in), and one more round of the endless appetizer, but had it placed slightly off the table, that one misplaced hand gesture sends it to the floor...

Hey Monday is Great time to go to Friday's. I need a cold Beer! I chose to sit at the bar today, I like sitting at the bar because service is usually pretty quick.  That is not the case here at this Friday's on my 4th visit here. I still was not immediately acknowledged at the bar, in fact a good 10 minutes passed as the barmaids did not even contact my eyes.  I noticed immediately that the service staff seemed overwhelmed with the volume of customers tonight. I had not been greeted yet and decided I would help myself to a menu. This seems to be a disconnect here between the staff and the patrons. After another 10 minutes no one had acknowledged me yet, I decided it was time to clean off the bar in front of me, to wipe away the crumbs. The barmaid was straightening and maintaining the bar in front of me, I finally had to said  ""Hello"" myself.  Looked up  I noticed half of the TVs surrounding the bar were  Turned off and or Broken?!!   Come on guys ?? This is Monday night football!  I was just in another  bar with over 100 big screen televisions. This is Totally inexcusable and unacceptable for Monday night football.  Or ""Any"" Bar, that would be open.  I asked about Monday night football specials, there either were not any, or the barmaid did not know.  In a saving grace they did have $5 Octoberfest On tap.. The  Barmaid did not even know what kind?!   There were not any runners bringing the food out with the exception of the poor overworked manager.  As a result some of the food was coming out cold as the barmaids themselves had to go down and get the food from the kitchen.  My spare rib dinner was not bubbling hot and my fries were ice cold.  My barmaid was kind enough to bring me another order of fries but with no food runners these also were not piping hot.  The manager and barmaid tried as best as they could,  but they are totally Understaffed here. A decision corporate makes to save money at the expense of the customers.  I hate giving any place A 2  Star rating,  but how can you even open your bar with most of your televisions broken.  There are literally a 100 eating establishments in a 5-mile mile radius in this Westbury and Garden City area, offering incredible, fabulous Dining experiences.  I am still a fan of Friday's, but unfortunately with the skeleton crew of employees here and broken TV's, I won't be returning here for a while.  Who would??

Seta M.,"Hempstead, NY",11,59,16,1.0,12/30/2017,"After my complaint here and on their website, I received a call from their General Manager. The details are below. Still waiting for them to take care of their end. I will keep U posted: ""This is a follow up to my initial complaint regarding events that took place on this day. After filing my first complaint regarding your server giving me a beef patty after my wife and I specifically advised we were vegetarian and wanted a well done black bean burger (which we had at your establishment before), I received a call from someone identifying herself as the General Manager. I gave her details about the incident and included something I did not write after my first contact, that the waitress gave us tortilla chips that had half eaten chicken in them. Now this might be heresay, however I took a picture of the item and it now resides on yelp.  The General Manager listened to this and apologized profusely and said she was going to send me a gift card to make up for it. I advised her that it should be sent to my wife and that we would come during the day because I really didn't want to see that server again because I am allergic to beef and didn't want her serving us. She verified my email address and since then, I have heard nothing.  This is not good follow up, especially since this was an incident that could have devolved into a legal battle. This feels like exact what I mentioned to the General Manager: Lack of attention to detail. Except this lack of detail is now coming directly from her.  I want to make you aware of this before I decide how I will respond to this situation. I want to be clear: as I stressed to her, I am VERY upset about this and feel something should be done.

The hostess told us the wait would be 20 minutes which for how busy it was didn't seem that bad. About 15 minutes later another party of 4 walked through the door and I went to follow to see how long their wait time would be. But, they didn't have one. They were seated right away, and when I asked when we were to be seated she said another 10 minutes. She told every single group of people that their wait time would be 20 minutes. It was vague and poorly handled and she was rude. They didn't have a proper system and no pagers were given. Finally when we were brought to our table I saw at least 6 empty tables on the way to ours. Empty tables on a Saturday night with at least 10 parties waiting to be seated? Bad move. At least 3 of those tables were dirty during our entirety in the restaurant. We ordered quickly since we waited so long (at least half an hour) and waited again. Drinks took at least 10 minutes to hit the table. 2 of us ordered Margaritas which were surprisingly good. One ordered a 22oz angry orchard, which he enjoyed, and then my fiancé ordered coffee. But, of course, not before getting mocked by our douchey waiter! I bet making jokes at your customers expense will help you pocket a solid tip, buddy.  Food was pretty good and it came our relatively quick. We ordered two 3 for alls and two of the new sharing appetizers. Nothing to write home about but we were satisfied. New bacon mac and cheese balls were really good and I liked the pretzels with beer cheese.  But, yet again service was crap. Our waiter did not bring our food out. So we were separating dishes and the waitress got pissed she had to hold the plate for more than a second and put them down on the table and told us ""to figure it out ourselves."" We saw our waiter once during our entire visit. We had to ask 2 separate servers for our check since he was MIA.  The management should really get their act together because every employee we came in contact with was incapable and rude.

Tee G.,"Brooklyn, NY",58,17,,1.0,5/8/2015,"So let me preface this by saying I absolutely love TGI Friday's.  Today I had the worst experience at this TGI Friday's I have ever had. My waiter must have been new or nervous or not suited to the food service industry. I'm not really sure what the deal is.  He was a nice enough guy and started out strong by repeating our orders back to us. It was quite a bit of time between request and fulfilment. But I'm not a monster and I can understand being busy. I really lost all patients when the food, which was repeated and corrected, came back all wrong. It was so bad my daughter had to watch everybody eat while waiting on them to make her entree from the beginning. Not to mention all the different sides that came to the table that we had to send back. He did try to make it up and bring her some fries. Which was nice, but....... When her food finally came and she asked for some condiments, they took FOREVER to come. Like really!!!!! My daughter took it upon herself to ask the hostess for a manager. No management came. We had a ToGo order that we gave to the server at the beginning of our entree orders and specifically let him know it was a ToGo order. When we were asking for the ToGo boxes and ready to leave, my husband inquired about the ToGo meal and the server went to put it in. LIKE REALLY!!!! My husband asked for a manager a second time and we were able to finally speak to a manager who comped some of the food and was very apologetic. I will come back but I will try some of the other restaurants in the area and give TGIF a break.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=80

Bathrooms: filthy.  Food: the food was in taste, but was cold. Service: my food was cold. The servers / runners looked like they were forced to be here, no one smiles EXCEPT the hostess. The waiter was obviously very over worked and my wings came out cold- sent them back, cold again. The 2 separate tables from us they gave the wrong food. The waiter.... where was he. He was honestly very nice but way over worked.  This really sucks because the Roosevelt field mall food court ""dining district"" was just redone and I could have ate there and been much happier- instead I went to TGIF and I regret it. Would I come back? Probably not anytime soon.  Would I recommend this place? No. Go Applebee's or many other choices around. Update: the kitchen manager came over and was pretty nice. He apologized for the food being cold twice and gave us a discount on the check.

We ended up here after bickering over where to go. They remodeled this location and now it appears to be more spacious, with even more seating.  It was a Thursday so it wasn't that crowded. We had a huge round table to ourselves with a full view of the TVs situated at the bar. Our waitress took forever to get our drink orders and then even longer to get our food order. The food is surprisingly decent. Every item has the calories listed next to it and since it wasn't a cheat day for me, I had to pay attention to those. Several of their options are calorie-friendly and come in at under 600 cals. This is better than places like Applebee's, which only offer a handful of items under 1,000 cals. I went with the chicken and shrimp. The chicken was good and tender, the shrimp was full of flavor, and the sauce on the side was actually pretty good. Overall, it's a quick and decent place if you're in the land of chain restaurants (this area close to Roosevelt Field only seems to have chains) and you're hungry. Service is absolutely horrendous (took 20 mins between handing over c/c and getting the receipt to sign) but like I said, if you're stuck in the area and your blood sugar be droppin', pop by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=60

Alyssa P.,"Brooklyn, NY",613,1079,2515,3.0,1/5/2012,"TGIF is a standard chain restaurant.  We've all been there.  We all love it and we all hate it.  Here are some of my reasons: Love: The Jack Daniels Burger.  Oh My.  The sauce on this burger is amazing.  It's sweet and smooth and taste so good on not only the burger but the sweet potato fries. Love: The Service.  It's usually pretty good.  Waiters rock red and white striped shirts and are generally friendly and energetic. Hate: The Sound.  It. Is. Soooooooo. Loud. In. There.  Why?  Because the designer of this particular location decided it would be a good idea to put tile on the floor, and tin on the ceiling.  Sound bounces around the place like crazy.   Go.  Eat.  But if you're looking to have a real conversation request to sit in one of the side dining rooms.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=100
Paul B.,"Great Neck, NY",99,217,52,2.0,3/4/2014,"In a sea of chains, Friday's was one of the first. Every location was constantly mobbed with long waits. I remember begging my parents to go to Fridays.  Nowadays, it is an entirely different experience.  Visited this location last week with a few buddies of mine after the hockey game. We sat in the bar area, as we recalled the ""half off appetizers"" deal they had. Unfortunately, now, you only get that deal if you are physically sitting at the bar. The waiter left, and began visiting us every 2-3 minutes to take our order. Overbearing is the word I would use to describe it.  When we ordered, the ""food"" we received was poor in every sense of the word.  -Wings: Tiny, dry, lacking any meat, clearly frozen -Pretzel sticks with dipping cheese: The ""pretzel sticks"" tasted like nothing more than breadsticks with salt on them, and the ""dipping cheese"" was disgusting, it tasted like velveeta, pathetic;  -Mozzarella sticks: hard to mess up right? Wrong! Tasteless, with solid cheese inside, couldn't even melt the cheese!   Arguably, these items are not hard to do well, however, everything tasted as if it was taken directly from the freezer, and thrown into a fryer without a care as to its preparation. I understand its a chain, and that it is not expensive food, but COME ON! The manager and/or owners of Fridays should visit the cheesecake factory, because their food is quality and has great taste. Frankly, the food at Fridays was disgusting, I will probably never return to a Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=100
Catina C.,"Franklin Square, NY",6,7,,3.0,4/19/2015,"This place is hit or miss. Sometimes the foods great service is crap and vice versa. Today I ordered a ""house-made"" lemonade.

Gen M.,"Westbury, NY",81,72,164,1.0,12/10/2014,Do not come here for lunch!!! Slow service!!! Should have listened when the couple next us got up and left  they after waiting 20 minutes for a waiter. The hostess is horrible.. I asked if we could move because we were sitting near the window were it was freezing. She wouldn't move us. Meanwhile the place was so empty. The food was terrible.  They tried to pass off the things we got as the things we ordered. Terrible!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=100
Amador A.,"Queens, NY",424,738,193,2.0,4/24/2013,Good location for a Fridays. Huge and a fun place to hang out. Besides that the food was not good at all. I order some sort of hamburger which tasted reheated and my girlfriend ordered a salad which were simple pieces of lettuce with cold chicken on top.  One last thing I had to interrupt the conversation the hostes was having with the staff in order for us to get seated.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=100
Scott B.,"Port Washington, NY",50,200,4,3.0,9/12/2014,"p.s. I went to the Manhasset Fridays a few times the past two years, and it's not bad: but still nothing to touch how good the old Westbury Fridays was years ago, but it's solid enough, though the service at the Manhasset location, and seating strategies/availability, and a few other things, are kinda lacking. The food is decent enough.  I don't like either enough to really give them any major great reviews.   In a pinch, they're fine.  I find the staff are friendly, mainly, but the service even at slower times is just, slow and sometimes with a lack of inter-staff communication.  The food is decent, and it seems like, at least, they run a clean restaurant and it's reliable for what/where it is. And gosh it's a bump-up from IHOP!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=100
Joan R.,"Valley Stream, NY",350,360,105,3.0,8/15/2012,"A nice TGIF location. We came here once one Friday during happy hour with a group of people to hang out and chill.  There wasn't too many people there a the time (around 6ish) and we sat in the bar. It was a nice TGIF; clean, cool, with crimson walls and booths, and with less crap on the wall compared to other TGIFs.  The bar was a big square and we all fit in to sides of the bar that formed a right angle. It was a good seating arrangement since we could all see each other and talk to each other without craning our necks. My bf and I took advantage of their Happy Hour deals: Half priced appetizers and $2 to $5 on select drink specials (ask the bartender which drinks are included in the happy hour special). The bartender was nice and pleasant, and we receive our orders without having to wait a long time. Food was good, drinks weren't too watered down, and overall we had an enjoyable time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=100

Mike M.,"Kirkland, WA",36,49,2,1.0,7/14/2012,"Don't come here.   The service is pretty horrendous.  It took thirty minutes to get water, forty minutes to get two salads.  Ridiculous. I'm pretty sympathetic when it comes to restaurants and the wait staff, as we all know they deal with some of the most unruly of patrons.  But that is not excuse for the attitude that I received right upon sitting down. The waitress I had was extremely rude; and seemed entirely bothered by my presence.  She was far more interested in her friends that sat in a booth near our table. We were largely ignored, not given any courteous service, and had to wait ridiculously long for everything - EVEN WATER.  Now, I realize the 'kitchen' gets packed, but WATER is ALL THE WAITRESS.  The food came out late and cold, so it was pretty clear that this woman wasn't doing her job. Positives: - Nothing.  Food probably would've been good, had it not cooled on a damn window sill while our waitress passed pleasantries with her loud and annoying pack of morons. Negatives: - Gets extremely packed, so be prepared to wait for your seat for an extremely long time. - Horrible service.  This absolute WORST I've ever had to deal with in my life. - Prices for drinks are pretty horrendous. The space Yelp allows me does not give me enough to express how displeased I am with this place.  I will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=100
Karen C.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,10,2,2.0,7/22/2016,"Went as group of 9 on a Thursday night after 7pm.  The good -we were seated right away.  Waiter seemed very new or wasn't paying attention when he was supposed to learn the menu.  My husband ordered the bruschetta chicken pasta which came out at least 5 mins before all of the other meals at the table.  When it arrived it was barely warm.  We finally got the waiter back after almost all the other food was delivered.  Husband sent back dish which was retuned to him after reheating and still wasn't hot.  Had to ask to see the manager who finally managed to offer a made fresh plate.  That one came out hot when most of the table had already finished their meals. The bill shows up and there was no compensation for bring the same food twice not heated properly.  Had to ask to get the meal taken off bill. Which they did but very disappointing service, food was passable.  Will not go here again or recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=100
S V.,"Hicksville, NY",0,3,4,1.0,1/18/2016,Awful service. Went to this location with my fiancé during his 1 hour lunch break. The waiter was terrible. We are stripes members and ordered chips and salsa and it never came. The waiter never acknowledged this. Finally 30 mins later out food finally came. The waiter never came to check up on us and my fiancé had to leave our table and go to another table to grab a ketchup bottle. We asked for then check which took another 10 mins to show up. We were waiting for our check to be picked up and 15 mins later the waiter still hadn't come back to our table. Frustrated we took back our credit card and instead left cash for the bill. Terrible experience and I will not be returning to this location. The one star is for the food being decent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=100

Today I changed things up and got a 10 ounce sirloin steak. My steak was really good. I ordered it medium well and it came out as advertised. My wife ordered a Ruben and my son had a hamburger. There were no left overs which is unusual. Using the buy one get one entree free, the bill was pleasant as well. Our waiter Patrick was very attentive and professional.

Jen M.,"Jupiter, FL",0,19,,1.0,10/17/2015,Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. It took ten 10 minutes for the server to greet us. He did not know the menu whatsoever. Soda machine didn't work. Once we ordered he came back ten minutes later to tell us they were out of one of the entrees. We still didn't get out drinks. We got up and left.

Irene F.,"Garden City, NY",7,12,58,3.0,4/26/2015,"We come here for the endless appetizers ($12) deal. Is it worth it? The portions are not smaller than the regular appetizers found at chains similar to these, so no you will not leave this place hungry trust me. There is a list of selected items for this deal so there is plenty of variety to chose from and not feel like you being shafted on choices. It is a convenient bargain for when you are looking to fill your belly but you are not quite prepared for a sit down meal. Depending on what day you go there are also drink specials. On Wednesdays it is mudslides ($3) and they are amazing!! I would say among my favorite apps are the pan seared dumplings, the spicy chicken tostadas (careful, they have a kick to them), and the jack daniels boneless wings. Not a fan of the garlic bruschetta because it was very heavy on the garlic or the mac-n-cheesy bites just not cheesy at all. If you are looking for a quick sit down meal the burgers here are also good but feel free to explore your options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westbury?start=100
Erik A.,"Locust Valley, NY",7,6,1,1.0,1/16/2014,Service is beyond slow; two hours before appetizers and it's empty. Steak was sub-par and came out cold.
