John S.,"Bay Village, OH",0,4,,4.0,10/19/2017,"We've always liked Friday's dry rub ribs and decided to try the new rib menu.  Alas, no dry rub anymore but they do promise more ribs for the money and are running a $12.99 full rack special vs. normal $21.99 price.  Comes with two nominal sides--fries and slaw, neither of which have impressed us in the past so we asked for the upgrade sides, which a manager promised would be a dollar more each.   Got the Jack Daniels ribs with sauce on the side--ribs without the sauce were definitely sweeter than the rub but every bit as fall off the bone tender and they were meatier.  As sides, we ordered mac & cheese, spinach and sweet potato fries.  The ""new"" mac & cheese tastes totally like velveta, definitely a down grade from the previous white cheddar.  Spinach was the same but much saltier.  Ditto for the salty sweet fries. Problem came when the check arrived.  We questioned the price adder for the side upgrades.  The bill didn't reflect the $1 adders and our server didn't really know what happened.  A manager stepped in and took care of the problem, attributing it to a programming error with the new menu. So, new menu, new quirks.  If you are a regular at Friday's, don't hesitate to ask lots of questions about the menu items.  Newer isn't always better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westlake
Xela N.,"North Olmsted, OH",7,208,,2.0,1/14/2018,"It had been many years since I went to this Friday's location, since my wife and I used to venture that way to go here, or Max & Erma's next door when it was open.  This will probably be my last time ever.  I ordered the 'Dragon Glaze salmon', and it was just average, and 'honey they shrunk the portions' too, apparently.  The amount of rice and veggies they gave me, as well as the salmon, was pathetically small.  They also did not have the 'Jack Daniels salmon', as they had years ago, and the prices have shot way up.  Lately, i've noticed many chain restaurants cutting their portions, lowering food quality, and raising prices.  At this point, methinks i'll just stick to smaller family owned and run diners and restaurants where I can get good portions at good 'value driven' prices!  Dissapointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westlake
Snevi V.,"North Olmsted, OH",0,2,4,1.0,9/1/2017,"I've never experienced such bad service in my entire life. We were there for about a hour and a half and the whole entire time our server stood by where the drink machine was and talked to two people I'm assuming are his friends. They talked about fantasy football and other stuff from what we can hear and other waiters working there were bringing out our food and serving us because he kept having private conversations when he should of been working. He did nothing to serve us and you can see other waiters getting pissed but none of them said anything. I'm gonna call in once our line connects to talk about our waiter Seth and how he doesn't do his job. Also he walked these two guys out to there car. Yes, he exited the building while still on duty and proceeded to talk to them out in the parking lot. Next time if you wanna hang out with your buddies don't come into work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westlake
Ron W.,"Olmsted Falls, OH",29,54,2,1.0,7/7/2017,"Stopped by with Geri and Chuck to have a couple of beverages and appetizers and the food was ok but the service stunk!  Sat at the bar which is normally good service but of course our bartender does not understand, ""Customer Service""!  Ordered and asked for chips and salsa and I had to get up and go to the front door to get them delivered.  Smallest appetizers that I have ever seen at a TGI Fridays. I am very pleased to say that I won't come back to this location!!  Good luck in keeping your clients.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westlake
Angela W.,"Cleveland, OH",78,23,22,1.0,7/8/2017,Came here for lunch after shopping. I will never ever go to another T.G.I.Fridays. My server Marissa or Miranda would not serve me. The host Trent from the front that seated me had to serve me. I'm  sure this had to do with the color of my skin. To my put one star cause I needed it for this review. I guess I have to find another favorite restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westlake
Matthew M.,"Elyria, OH",17,239,41,4.0,11/12/2016,A pretty good TGIFridays. We go to lunch here from work every so often and have never had any issues with it. The food is generally really good and the service is pretty good. No complaints. I plan on going back in the future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westlake
Katrina D.,"Westlake, OH",0,9,1,1.0,3/6/2017,"Terrible. Prior to tonight, I've ordered carryout online after work about every other week.  Tonight, I came to pick up my order and waited at the Curbside Pickup parking spot (like I always have--the 30something times I've done it.)  After about 15 minutes, I finally pulled my car around and went in to get my food.  I was directed to the bar, where there were no employees the first few minutes I was waiting.  Finally, someone came up and provided me my food. When I explained that I had been waiting outside, she informed me that they ""don't do curbside on online orders.""  Hmm.. well they certainly have every other 30 something times I've ordered this way.  When I explained that, she changed her story and told me they ""only do curbside late at night.""  Again... I've always ordered right at 5pm when I get off work and they've always brought it out.  Not that I mind going in... but if that's the process, that should always be the process. There's no option to choose curbside vs. inside, etc. when you order online. (BTW.. I also already tipped on my order, assuming it would be delivered curbside.)   When I finally got my food, I left.  Once outside, I realized I wasn't given my coke and returned to get it and had to wait again.  Once I got home, I realized every part of my order was wrong.  I had ordered a burger with a side of french fries.  Then as an additional side, I ordered mashed potatoes for an extra fee.  Didn't get the french fries that came with my meal.  I ordered cheesecake with no strawberries and only chocolate syrup.  What did I get?  You betcha... cheesecake with strawberries and NO chocolate syrup. Absolutely ridiculous.  This was 5pm on a Monday and they were not even remotely busy.  No excuse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westlake
Brandon J.,"Avon, OH",36,2,,1.0,9/2/2016,"walked in on a Friday afternoon in between lunch and dinner rush times and stood at the hostess stand for roughly 5 minutes. 3 waitresses and a bar tender looked right at me, made eye contact and never bothered to seat me. no where did it say open seating. very unprofessional to have a customer stand there and multiple employees just look at them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westlake
Alisia A.,"Westlake, OH",189,186,155,4.0,1/25/2016,"We usually stop in for their specials at the bar. On a game night we stop in for a drink or two and have some finger foods. Always had a great experience and our food is always delicious. I mean you can't go wrong with some fried food and a beer. Probably won't stop in for dinner, but it's a good place for casual drinks and appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westlake
Matthew S.,"Twinsburg, OH",114,129,2,4.0,5/9/2015,"It's a Chain Restaurant, so I can never go full-on 5 stars, but the host and the waitress that were working last Monday were on point some of the best restaurant workers I have run into.  The host sat us down at a back table, invited us into conversation, and made us feel welcome as we waited for our friends who were running late. The waitress, who was more beautiful than anyone we've met in Los Angeles (where beautiful people are supposed to reside [but not as beautiful as my lady, let me make note]) was nice and competent, which is two traits that are hard to find together in servers around the city of Los Angeles as well.  So, far, before we even ordered, this TGI Friday's experience was a breath of fresh air. Our friends arrive, and they had been to this Friday's a week prior and the waitress not only remembered them, but remembered their order.  We commandeered the table for an hour past our welcome, but they staff was always friendly, and we never felt rushed.  I really enjoyed our time here for lunch. Kudos to the staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westlake
Terry W.,"Olmsted Falls, OH",0,6,1,2.0,11/1/2015,The service was great until it was time for our food.  The New York strip steak I ordered was very rare especially when I ordered it medium. It was sent back twice and the only part put back on the grill was the part I cut off to examine how done it was. I got to eat the potatoes and jasmine rice but the steak and soggy shrimp did me in. I got compensated for the meal but that didn't  help the bad feelings I had afterwards.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westlake
Bryan S.,"Westlake, OH",0,22,,2.0,9/4/2016,French dip was decent but small for the price. Service was pretty sloppy. Don't expect much.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westlake

Meredith B.,"North Olmsted, OH",0,3,,1.0,9/2/2015,"Tonight is the second and last time I attempted to eat at the restaurant.  The first night my boyfriend and I had the door locked in our face at 11:45, we figured that when the kitchen closed at 12 and the bar at 1 it would be open until then. However we went back and won't make that mistake again. At 11 tonight we went in and waited at the host stand for 10 minutes and were ignored before we sat ourselves in a booth and were ignored for another 10 minutes before someone told us to move so we did and then ANOTHER 10 minutes later they told us the kitchen was shut down already. I will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westlake
Mike D.,"Lakewood, OH",54,22,,3.0,12/1/2014,"After going here a little over a week ago with family to blow off a gift card we had, I can satisfactorily say that it was better than the very low bar I had set for it.  The service was great and on top of all of our needs - always very pleasant despite the fact that the entire front of house seemed like it was staffed by teenagers at the local high school. The food was to be expected - microwaved and heavily sauced - exactly as I had expected out of a chain.  I'm also surprised that the Jack Daniels specialties are still continuing.  Hasn't this promotion been in place for 20+ years now? I will stop by again if I am in the area to see a movie and if I have a gift card or coupon needs to be used up, but for no other reason.  Crocker Park has far better choices available for either sit-down or fast casual options.  When the next round of construction completes, I wouldn't be surprised if this part of Crocker Park complex is looked at for a demolishing/rebuild.  When that happens, I look forward to saying goodbye to Friday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westlake
Jeff M.,"New Albany, OH",1,14,,1.0,2/24/2015,"Walked in on a busy evening and was asked how many....Told the hostess that we were sitting at the bar for the ""Buy 1 Get 1"" special we had received an Email on.

Raven Anne S.,"Avon, OH",126,94,970,2.0,10/27/2011,"I feel like Friday's food menu has gotten worse over the years. The alcohol menu - big improvements, I mean, who wouldn't want a 'Diddy Up' - right?! This particular location is hit or miss with the waitstaff - some act like they love their jobs, others look like they hate their lives. Past couple of times I've been there the food came out lukewarm at best. Yesterday, it just so happened that I found a lemon seed in my Brushetta Chicken Pasta, after almost cracking a tooth on it, ew. Although, I will say, I just moved that bad boy to the side and acted like I never saw it. It's probably better that way. The seating arrangements are like any other Friday's... booths, tables, a bar. Some of their 'four person' booths would probably be better suited for 2 people or perhaps small children - you won't find any arm room or a place to set your purse here. Sometimes they run dinner specials - an appetizer, entrée, & dessert - somewhere around $11.99 or they've got some 2 for $20 deals. I'll come back but only because it's cheap-ish & close to home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westlake

Teresa S.,"Phoenix, AZ",289,811,408,5.0,8/6/2012,"I am going to start by saying it has been maybe 7 years since i have been to a Fridays. This time there were 5 of us and it was one of the most wonderful experiences we have ever had. It was a Sunday and my Godson's First Communion Day.  So we came here after Church. We were greeted right by a wonderful man, who right away acknowledged my Godson as to his First Communion.  ( he could tell from the Outfit). Our Server was incredible! His name was Seth. Seth made sure we had an incredible time and we did. Our drinks were brought out immediately and he explained all the questions that my sister had about the menu.   He made a fuss of Caleb(The Boy's special day) Our food was amazing!! Friday's has really changed it up. We started with appetizers.  We had Fried Green beans, Boneless Chicken wings, and Potato skins.  They were all incredible. I had for the dinner, Salmon with Langustos, and the rest of the family had Steak, shrimp and Ribs. They all said they were fantastic! Our wonderful server Seth even got Caleb any dessert of his choice. We all got a dessert and they were Great! We had a wonderful time and the Food , the service, and the atmosphere were lovely. Even the restrooms were clean and lots of parking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westlake

Came here with the extended family for a First Communion Day dinner.Our Server was a great guy. Seth,was attentive and fast, and really made the day great!  Our food was delish, all of it!  They even gave the Boy a free dessert of his choice. The resturant is very clean and so are the restrooms. Music is not too loud, and everything about it was great.

Dianne R.,"Avon, OH",125,14,,5.0,8/19/2012,"Last week, it was TGIF on a Wednesday!!!  I've enjoyed TGI Friday's many times in the past, but have not been to this chain in over 2 years. All I can say is YUMMMM!!!  I was taken there for my birthday lunch. That day, I had also signed up online for TGIF's ""Stripes"" Card! When we sat down, our server, Nicole, informed me that as a Stripes member, I receive free chips & salsa every time I go there! What a great perk! It was a HUGE platter of fresh, hot chips and salsa! Nothing ""small"" about this place!!  My favorite, decadent cocktail has to be TGI Friday's signature concoction, the Mudslide!! OOOOOhhh, a chocolate/vodka/Kahlua/ice cream orgasm for sure!! After indulging on a Mudslide, I was served a healthy portion of Cajun Shrimp & Chicken Pasta. Spicy and heated, it was thoroughly delicious. But, I could not finish it, and got a ""to go"" box.  My lunch mate secretly told Nicole that it was my birthday. Before I knew it, Nicole and two other servers came over to the table, put a huge slice of vanilla bean cheesecake in front of me and sang their birthday song. OK... so, it's kind of silly -- kind of embarrassing -- but, I enjoyed it!!! Like being a little kid again!! Now, cheesecake is my favorite dessert, so I did not want to save it for later... I managed to savor each bite!  Overall, TGI Friday's never disappoints. The menu is expansive. The food is fantastic. The service is top notch. The Mudslides are the BEST!!!  5 YUMS UP!!! ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-westlake?start=20
Mady J.,"Bowie, MD",128,154,111,2.0,3/25/2014,"I have been to a lot of Fridays restaurant here in Maryland most of the time with family and friends, the ambience is pretty good with all that American vibe. I had to wait very long time for my food and all the dishes came out at different times. Also the waiter was busy chatting up the cook, and while we were trying to get her attention. We were sitting right across from the kitchen entrance, and could see that she is having a conversation with someone in there. The food was ok but not great!

Chris M.,"Westlake, OH",2,22,,2.0,8/15/2013,"Ate there last week.  Big disappointment.  Prices are up, specials are basically gone.  Food was mediocre and overpriced.  They took a lot of items off their menu that I liked in the past.  This place has had a lot of ups and downs over the past 20 years.  We ate there a lot in the past 2 years and it was very good.
