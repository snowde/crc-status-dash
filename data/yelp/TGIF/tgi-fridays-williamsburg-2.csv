Jim V.,"Williamsburg, VA",0,32,,1.0,3/3/2017,"What a disaster. Walk in to four employees standing around. One guy grabs menus and asks how many in our party.  We respond and then says ""we are on an hour wait""...with four empty tables in plain view and no other patrons nearby. Is this customer service when said ""host"" snickers when we ask him if he was serious, considering he had menus and silverware ready?  TGIFridays should be embarrassed...headed downhill like the rest of them.

Sarah J.,"Richmond, VA",1,34,,1.0,1/18/2017,"I went to tgif in Williamsburg on my birthday weekend getaway. I was eating the Macaroni & cheese & found a ""METAL SPRING"" in my food. I have pictures to prove it. I told the female manager on duty and my server. Neither did anything. I still paid regular for two meals over $50 total to friend a metal spring. The manager even admitted the spring fell off the cheese machine. I submitted a complaint through the TGIF website and a better business bureau on the date this happened 12/27/16 & NOONE has called me yet. Still waiting on corperate office to call me. From this poor experience, I'll make sure to tell family & friends don't go to this TGIF because they may find metal pieces in their food.  Thinking of going to news media as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsburg-2?start=20

L J.,"Ruther Glen, VA",0,32,3,1.0,4/14/2017,"Terrible service tonight , will never eat at this location again . We eat out several times week so we are well aware of what customer service is suppose to be. I attempted to call in a to go order was left in hold , called back and left on hold again. The gentlemen at the front showed me to the bar place an order and the two women behind the bar said they couldn't take my order only one specific person could and they didn't know where they were. I told them just forget the order , it's to much hassle to place one order. Once I get crap service I won't eat there again.

While waiting for my carry out, Leah was the spark & customer service experience that every Friday's need!  Leah has to be one of THE MOST best bartenders & the BEST employee I've ever encountered at a Fridays.  I swear, Friday's should have Leah train Fridays employees, worldwide. She's an outstanding employee!  I wish I would have ordered a drink or two...or three!  My dining partner even left her a top just for taking our order & making us feel welcomed...something you don't get at many Friday's.

Our food has finally arrived, nearly 40 minutes later.   Here's a shock, cold and dry.   Just like the personalities at this location.    Seriously, if you aren't already sitting in this restaurant, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsburg-2?start=20

Renee W.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,65,3,2.0,3/14/2017,"By far the worst Fridays. It's right by the premium outlets so you would automatically assume they get a lot of business and would have decent service. Unfortunately that is not the case. The manager took our drink orders & informed us that we could not share the endless appetizers. That would have been no big deal if the other three tables around us weren't sharing them. Then, we order two orders of mozzarella sticks which were absolutely disgusting. The ""manager"" walks by and ask why we weren't eating them. We tell her how gross they are (mushy & tasted like old grease). All she said was ""Oh."" Not can I remake them for you, or I'll take them off of your bill....just OH. On my second appetizer I ordered boneless wings, which were served to me with SOUR CREAM instead of Ranch. How do you confuse the two??? All in all, this place absolutely sucks.

We didn't blame the waitress- but the lack of assistance from management and her coworkers was awful. No one helped her.

The floors were full of trash and it just felt dirty.

Keith C.,"Virginia Beach, VA",354,199,1011,3.0,12/16/2016,My first impression of this location was that the exterior was super cool and unique. I know this may be a stretch but it was the only one that looks like this and that makes it standout up here in Williamsburg. The service was very good and our server was super attentive. I took a walk around and noticed that they have some good happy hour deals that will be very kind to your pockets. I also noticed that the seating here is good for either just two or a large group of people. My food was pretty good. I had the Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta. It was filling and delicious.

Cori C.,"Williamsburg, VA",111,5,,1.0,5/2/2017,"I always give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt but this is the second time I came and had a bad experience. It was cousins birthday and it was 4 of us who came to eat. We picked Friday's because we wanted to have their endless apps.  Our waitress was welcoming at first but once the night went on she disappeared. She took our orders and our drinks. She came back with our food 20 minutes later and our drinks. By the time we were done we wanted another appetizer. 25 minutes went by and we ended up asking another waiter if he could refill our apps and he did. He brought us our food and we ate. Still our waitress was no where to be found. About 15 minutes into eating our second round of apps she comes back and asks us if we want our drinks refilled. We kindly said yes and 10 minutes later she comes back with no drinks and apologizes for forgetting.  We reminded her what we wanted and still..... received no drinks. By now we were ready to go and she comes back and drops off the check again without asking if we wanted anything else.. STILL NO DRINKS. & the birthday boy wanted another appetizer but he just didn't bother to ask because of how long we had to wait to get the second ones  By the way, we had separate checks which she messed up and we had to have her fix it which took another 15 minutes.

Every employee I encountered was not helpful and it took forever to get food , drinks , refills on a Sunday evening that was not busy at all. The waitress maybe came to the table a total of 5 times our whole meal . She did not ask how the food tasted or if everything was okay , had to ask other servers for service and refills Etc.

However the food just seems like one notch above frozen food. The flavor and presentation is better than most chains. Our potato skins came out burnt and dry. But that didn't shock us. The cooks seem to have given up on the customers. Overall, service is good and atmosphere is good. Food quality is frozen food level but we all know what we are coming to eat.

Nena B.,"Northeast Washington, Washington, DC",0,2,,1.0,7/16/2017,"This was the worst experience ever, I will never go back to any Fridays. Our party of ten, five teens, five adults were seated at two different tables. Everything started smoothly, the waiter took the adult drink orders-all soda and tea and delivered them promptly. The teens ordered their drinks, all slushies. We all ordered our food. Food started coming out before the teens got their drinks.  Three meals out of ten arrived...the Jack Daniels sampler that arrived-the chicken was burnt, the presentation was awful. The quesadilla didn't come with any toppings and it was burnt.  The chicken wings were also burnt, we're still patiently waiting. Ten minutes later the teens drinks started to arrive. My daughter brought over her drink from the teen table. I tasted it. My brother tasted it. it was a LONG ISLAND ICED TEA. No one in our party ordered alcohol!  My brother took it to the bartender to confirm. The bartender and the waiter got into a heated exchange in the middle of the floor, the bartender yelled at the waiter that he should've read the ticket. I spoke to the manager who said ""I'm sorry I don't know what to say, I'll have to speak to someone."" We left disgusted. P.S.

Upon our waitress coming over we mentioned to her that it was freezing in the restaurant to which she replied,""they keep it that cold for us and the kitchen staff because we are busy running around"". I was shocked by that entire statement because The comfort of your guests is your priority in the service industry and when your at twenty percent capacity how much running around could actually be going on. We ordered our appetizer but where told they were out of that particular item so we chose a different one. When the appetizer came it was luke warm and the chesse wasn't even melted. We ordered our entrees and they cam both were just as disappointing. Hard chichen fingers and parmesean crusted chicken which was chicken with bread crumbs in one small pile on top.

My brother sat with an empty water cup for his entire meal (he ate hot wings for lunch). My sister finished her drink as well (Dr. Pepper) and at the end of her meal it was refilled with Sprite. My aunt was given the wrong salad, given a new one that was wrong as well. The menu advertised a half an avocado in her salad and she found a little circle of avocado in it. We ordered the endless apps of boneless wings and got our meals right away, but my aunt and mom took an extra 20 minutes to get their meals of A BURGER and a SALAD. The checks were both wrong (we asked for separate checks per family). Offered a discount that was not included on the receipts and the waitress Michelle had no clue what happened. Manager had to come over and explain as she walked away. Appalled by the service, the restaurant and the experienced overall. Do not recommend coming here.

Erin K.,"Williamsburg, VA",3,7,2,2.0,4/23/2014,"Service was fine. The beers on draft in the menu do not reflect the beers that they actually have. While we were there the draft beer that my boyfriend wanted wasn't working and they couldnt figure it out. My boyfriend got the black & blue burger with fries and I got the Jack Daniels chicken sandwhich with fries. Our plates contained hardley any fries and half of my chicken was uncooked. Such a shame because the food there can be decent.  The manager came over and took the chicken sandwich meal off of our bill and we had a coupon for a free appetizer so our bill ended up not being to bad, thankfully.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsburg-2?start=60

Food was on point, nothing was dried or bitter, I had the lobster and salmona fish for dinner, it was pretty good overall but in a way the price seem a tab bit high just for a couple pieces of lobester and a small portion of fish for 17.99. Luckily we were there for happy hour so Had drinks specials and the apptz were 1/2 during that time. Great place, prolly be back in the area when I go visit my friend.

Kitchen error? Not sure. But when I got my burger, it was burnt.. We never saw our waiter again after he took our food order. Lots of people told us he walked out and nobody could find him.

Victoria M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",0,9,1,1.0,8/7/2015,Let's start with I understand we came in at a weird time between lunch and dinner but I still expect decent service and food. Not here. Waited more than 5 mins for someone to take our drink order. This was after what ended up being our waitress had passed us at least 5 times trying not to eye contact. The hostess that seated us proceeded to sit down with another table and eat. If I thought her shift was over and she was eating I was wrong.... Someone had to actually come get her because people were at the door waiting to be seated. So husbands medium steak comes finally and it is leather welllllll done. He has it on a plate next to his and waitress walks by as if that's normal. I had to get her attention... All the while we have ordered a drink from the bar and ten mins later still nothing....

The African American family in front of us were happily sat at a booth, but when our white family asked for one two seconds later, we were told no, and there was nothing they could do.  When I said we would take our business somewhere else, the hostess just shrugged her shoulders and went back to pretending to look busy with her seating chart.  There's a restaurant a short clip from there called Ocean and Ale, you'll be just fine there and they'll be happy to see you and more than happy to take your seating requests.  I'm thankful it was so terrible or I wouldn't have found that nice restaurant.  I've never seen a more poorly operated establishment in my life.  Stay away.  That was the last time I'll ever take my family to a Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsburg-2?start=40
