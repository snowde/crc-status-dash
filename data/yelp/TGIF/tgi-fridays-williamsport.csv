Kaela G.,"Ontario, NY",1,8,,4.0,8/27/2017,"The food was great. Best chicken fingers by far thanks. Though the fries are oversalted and the cheese was more chewy than Chewbacca. The server was nice. Though I am very offended at the lack of rootbeer in this resturaunt. They clearly don't have their priorities straight. Also, apparantly sweet potato fries translates to regular boring potato fries. My vegan mother is offended by the lack of leaf eating options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
Brittany K.,"Bloomsburg, PA",3,38,20,2.0,12/10/2017,"Pretty disappointed by our experience at Friday's today... was not busy while we were there and service was not the greatest. Our appetizer was the loaded chicken nachos, they took a very long time to come out, tables who arrived after us had gotten their food already. When they finally came they were good but I wouldn't call them chicken nachos at all... i would bet money on the fact that there was not even 1 full ounce of chicken on that plate at all... and there was maybe 10 black beans total... flavor of what was on the plate was good but certainly not worth $12... by this point that table that sat behind us had already sent their ribs back for being cold. Also heard them complain about service. Next our meals arrived. My boyfriend got the Jack Daniels Sampler. He was pleased with his food, though I found it funny that the server who brought our food out told him it would be a minute for his side of mashed potatoes because she couldn't carry it all... 2 large plates and a side plate? Use a tray! Unfortunately the moment my food was placed in front of me I knew it wasn't good. I got the sizzlin chicken and shrimp. This is described as ""GARLIC-MARINATED ALL-NATURAL CHICKEN AND SHRIMP TOSSED IN BRUSCHETTA MARINARA. SERVED OVER MELTED CHEESE WITH ONIONS, PEPPERS AND CREAMY MASHED POTATOES."" What I got was BURNT AND GREASY MESS! Cheese was black and burnt fast to the skillet. My shrimp were laying in a pile of black greasy charcoal and the plate that the skillet was on was a disgusting greasy mess that had food flung all over it. Even the mashed potatoes were burnt to the bottom... terrible! Manager took my meal off our bill even tho I had asked her not to. I did eat what wasn't burnt fast to the bottom, it wasn't much but I would always pay for what I eat. Server told me I should have asked for a new one but I'm sorry, as a server you need to always check your food before you serve it. I would never have served that to my table. We sat and waited almost 10 minutes for our server to cash us out... beyond disappointed and hope corporate checks in on this location and cleans things up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
Tara S.,"Williamsport, PA",58,35,4,5.0,7/7/2017,"Went during happy hour today. Atmosphere was great. The server was very pleasant and attentive to our needs. We had the endless appetizers, $12 per person. Pretty good deal when there are 9 different types to try. We each got different ones and sampled each other's. restaurant was very clean, and bathrooms were clean as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
Kimberly M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",42,68,37,3.0,5/30/2016,We stopped on our way back out of town. I had a burger and fries. It was good. My family members had soup both said the soups were bad-no flavor and the croutons in The French onion soup were very hard and were unable to chew. My other family member had a chicken dish and said it was pretty good. I had a beer that I hadn't had and it was really good. Our server was really nice and did a great job.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
Rae U.,"Montoursville, PA",0,12,3,4.0,12/28/2016,"We are regulars and came here right after Christmas. The place was packed. Our party of seven waited over an hour for food and the manager surprised us all by taking care of our entire bill. The staff here is more than friendly, food is always good or they will fix it and the restaurant is fun! Definitely a good place to eat, drink, and be merry!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
Kerrie B.,"Lewisburg, PA",0,98,7,3.0,8/14/2016,Overall nothing really great nor really offensive here. We go about one time per month.  Prices have really creeped up. Food is fair.  The Tennessee Whiskey Cake for dessert is a whole other ballgame however!  I always order an extra scoop of ice cream as my husband gets his spoon in there and it's like I suddenly don't exist anymore.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
Bill J.,"Williamsport, PA",0,3,,1.0,4/2/2016,Took a LONG time to get drinks. My wife ordered a small Dos Equis lager draft but the waitress came back and said they only had it in bottles. Wife said that was OK. Waitress returned and said they started a new keg except she brought a LARGE Dos Equis AMBER. French onion soup had some sort of rubber on top instead of cheese. My wife was supposed to get chipotle mayonnaise but got Jack Daniels sauce instead. The napkin wrapped around my silverware had some sort of dried mac and cheese all over it. Was billed for a separate order of soup instead of the add on price. We were seated next to a very loud table of people who complained endlessly about the table next to them. That table was upset about food quality and made a fuss. Probably the most troubling part of the visit was when a person who spent time in prison for statutory rape stopped by and joked around with a neighboring table. It was lightly raining when we left and the parking lot was a lake - poor drainage. AND the war on religious liberty has hit this restaurant! It used to be called TGI Fridays and now it's just Fridays. How can they take God out of 'Murica like that!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
Amy L.,"Williamsport, PA",15,54,6,4.0,12/15/2015,Like any other chain restaurant. Lots of seating. I have always gotten seated fast. 4 stars based on the menu. The menu has minimal choices.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
Bryan F.,"Mill Run, PA",58,6,,4.0,11/8/2015,Went here had great service and our food was good too. I had ribs and my husband and son had the jd steaks everything was awesome :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
Brenda G.,"Girardville, PA",2,21,2,4.0,10/19/2014,$10 AYCE Appetizers. Good deal. Cheap lunch. OK service. Seems like they hire college kids who just don't care.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
Stacey C.,"Watsontown, PA",83,55,,1.0,7/12/2014,"We came in tonight and there was no wait. The rest of our visit, we waited. We waited for our drinks to come, and waited to place our order, and then waited some more for our food (which our waitress apologized for saying that everyone was waiting, but the table next to us came in after us & got their food before us). Once our food came, I asked for ranch dressing. I should've just used ketchup, because my fries were cold before I got my dressing. They gave my husband the tiniest cup of honey mustard I've ever seen, and then he waited just as long as I did to get more. My dad got the sirloin steak, and said 3/4s of the steak was all fat and then spit it out, saying it was way too fatty to eat. Our bill was the fastest thing to come. This place is a disaster.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
Dean R.,"Williamsport, PA",3,4,1,2.0,7/6/2014,"Everytime I go here the portion sizes get smaller and smaller. Tonight was no different, small portion of chicken, huge broccoli florets that looked like they were store bought, but small amount! Good variety of beer on draft but that's only positive note.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
Brandon Z.,"Williamsport, PA",3,50,,4.0,3/20/2011,"I've had many great meals here, and they are pretty consistent in the kitchen and with the wait staff. My only problem is that just recently they stopped offering the one thing that made me go the Tgi Friday's over the other Restaurants in Williamsport. That is the 3 course meal for 14.99 (I think that's what it was give or take a buck) which included an appetizer (the pot stickers are my favorite though the spinach dip is also very good) a meal from their list (I usually ordered the bruchetta chicken pasta), and a desert. As it stands now, without that offer, they don't have anything amazing. Their pasta is still good, the steaks are pretty tasty, and their burgers good but no more than anywhere else. Also, their ribs are pretty mediocre, just about everytime I've got them they're been pretty dry.  So overall, I like the place, but not as much as I did about a month ago.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
G C.,"Gore, VA",0,4,,5.0,5/9/2015,"Came here twice in two nights! First night was a company issued meal, but the staff were so friendly and the food was delicious I brought my family back. Second night the manager was so helpful and accommodating. Our waitress was friendly, and the food was still delicious. Good temperature and ordered to taste!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
Bob V.,"Montoursville, PA",11,76,198,5.0,8/16/2013,I've eaten here many times and the food is always good and served with style. The atmosphere is fun too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
Goldenpig G.,"Williamsport, PA",19,88,124,2.0,3/19/2010,"I have been there once for those years. Why just once? Cause the first experience I had there: I waited for almost 40 minutes for my OK testing BBQ ribs, and the waiter there didn't take care of us at all(just took the order, then gone, then brought the order after 40 minutes). I didn't pay the bill, but if I did, I wouldn't pay any tip for this one.  After this visit, every time somebody mentioned to go there even they had BOGO coupons, my answer was NO. I was scared of their service there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
Dennis H.,"Middletown, PA",0,39,8,2.0,8/27/2012,"Let me start this by saying that I am a BIG TGIFriday's fan. I eat at this chain frequently while travelling. Normally, the food is good for a chain restaurant and the benefits of being a club member is also nice. The first thing I will say about this location is the staff is excellent. They treat their customers well and are attentive to you needs. SO this review is NOT a bad reflection on the servers at this site, I would say it is either due to the cooks skill or the fact that the restaurant chain changing their menu. I am not sure. So here goes: We had a party of 8. We were sated immediately, and the restaurant was not crowded. Our drinks were at the table within 4 minutes and appetizers came out fast (less than 10 minutes) Fridays Three for all. From there, things began to slide. It took a little longer for the entrees to come out and with 8 people, it is understandable, especially since we had a mixed bag of dinners and sandwiches.  My entree was the Chicken Piccata Pasta which is described as: Citrus-seasoned chicken breast sautéed with California heirloom garlic, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers and capers, then tossed with multi-grain angel hair pasta in a lemon white wine sauce with fresh basil. My thoughts on this dish:  1) it was a good sized portion, not over or under whelming.  2) The pasta was cooked just beyond al dente, but was not mushy  3) The sauce started out nice, but as I continued, it was extremely salty and sour at the same time.  4) I did not taste fresh basil, I tasted the capers which were overly abundant, and lemon vinegar flavor.  I believe that it ruined the whole dish as it was not balanced. Everyone else in our party had no complaints. I should have said something to the server, but as we were finishing it became busy and let it slide. I will contact the corporate office, because I HATE their new menu selections. The old menu was better at least in my area.  The servers were excellent though! Eat something else there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
JoAnn R.,"Williamsport, PA",0,41,,4.0,7/1/2012,"We are ""Stripe"" members and enjoy the little extras that this provides.  We eat there about one or twice every couple of months, but never on Sundays since that seems to be the worst day for service/food.  We have not had anything bad, but if we have a problem, it has been fixed to our satisfaction.  I had the $6.99 choose two the other day and the Southwestern wedge salad was so good, I ate it all and took my corn beef/Swiss on pretzel bread home and had it for dinner.  It was delicious too.  We enjoy the boneless wings - trying a different sauce each time.  Didn't care for the Carribean rum - too sweet for my liking but if you like a little sweetness with your chicken, try it.  Going back at the end of the month for ""free appetizer"" and the mango peach lemonade - a bit pricey, but with endless refills, I could stay all afternoon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
Zoe F.,"Williamsport, PA",0,3,,4.0,3/12/2011,Food was great the service was also great. Our server (Lyndsay) was very nice.  P.S. I recommend the Sesame Jack Chicken.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-williamsport
