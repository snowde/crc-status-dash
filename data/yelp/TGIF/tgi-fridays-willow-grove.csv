Ilene E.,"Philadelphia, PA",57,447,560,4.0,9/21/2017,I came on a Sunday afternoon and the place had a decent amount of people dining.  But it was so dark here as if they were save electricity. The server brought us water and we ordered.  I was reading the past reviews about service being really slow and I was nervous but I think our food came within 20-30 minutes so it was ok.  Our server checked on us throughout the meal and when we asked for the check and paid. Everything went smoothly and we begin shopping afterwards. I think it really depends on what time you are dining here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove
Janelle B.,"Glenside, PA",119,74,41,1.0,10/12/2017,"If I could leave this place 0 stars, I would. I've never seen service this awful in my entire life, and all for crappy chain restaurant food. My friends and I stopped here on Cinco de Mayo, unwillingly, as most of the Mexican restaurants in the area had over an hour wait and we were hungry. We thought it would be a pretty quiet and quick place to grab a bite to eat and a margarita, but boy were we wrong. We ended up having to wait over 30 minutes to even get a table. Once we were seated it took an additional 30 minutes for someone to take our order. (We might as well have just sucked it up with the hour wait for a better restaurant, ugh!) We all ordered appetizers so that we could quick eat and get out of there, as it was so loud we could barely even hear one another. When our waiter brought out our food, 3 of the 4 things we ordered were completely wrong. It then took us another 20 minutes to track down our waiter to let him know of the mistake, taking another 20 minutes for him to bring out the correct items.  We were then charged for the mistaken items and had to argue to only get 2 items taken off the bill. Absurd. A quick stop for a bite to eat ending up taking almost 4 hours! The entire experience was absolutely horrible. I don't think I'll ever go to a TGI Fridays again.  Definitely do not stop at this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove
LadyAdelinda ..,"Abington, PA",0,10,24,1.0,8/14/2017,"ZERO RATING BUT YELP WON'T LET ME.  This place is nasty. Walked in last night n the stench was something aweful. We were promptly sat, however 15 mins later & still no server. Menus given covered in all kinds of stuff, n a bread crumbs n chunks. Had to use bathroom.  That was appalling floor so sticky my shoes were getting stuck. The toilets gross, femine products visible n used. Zero toilet paper. I didn't use the bathroom..Just left. Got back to our table. Still no server .. spoke to my party n said let get out of here before we get food poisoning.  So we went elsewhere, I will never come back to this place.

Jessica L.,"Philadelphia, PA",61,62,90,1.0,4/4/2017,"Came here at 7:30 with my boyfriend for dinner. Our server, Jared, gave the best service we ever had in the shitty situation we were put in. We waited 45 minutes for our appetizer and he apologized to us for the wait and even joked around with us. The appetizers were so not worth it for $13-14. We got the Friday's combo and when the appetizer came out, the food was somewhat warm but the plate was more heated than the actual food. I ate one of the potato skins and dipped it in the sauce and a label came off. I apparently ate the other half of the label and now I will have a piece of this place with me until I get to the bathroom. The main entrees we had were a well done 10oz plain steak with mashed potatoes and fries and cajun shrimp and chicken pasta. When the entrees came on the table, they were super freaking hot! Like they microwaved the food before serving. The 10oz steak had sweet seasoning and was super dry and my pasta was super bland and oily. THE FOOD HERE IS VERY PRICY FOR THEIR MEDIOCRE FOOD AND SERVICE. Overall, we are not coming back ever again but shout out to our server, Jared, you are the real mvp and I hope you find a better place to work than that disgusting restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove
Trina V.,"Willow Grove, PA",2,3,15,3.0,5/2/2017,"The food took forever. My cheeseburger had some weird curdled yellow ""cheese"" and the bread was definitely 3-4 days past it's expiration date.   I asked for the check and it took so long. I guess the papyrus had to be pressed before she could make the paper for my receipts. The medium well Burger, tasted medium good. My daughters medium well steak missed being medium and also well.

Shardai G.,"Philadelphia, PA",75,171,169,1.0,6/9/2016,"I really wanted to have a great dining experience (especially for the sake of of my niece's graduation celebration) but when I looked to see if things would go well it didn't. Now I expected that there might have been some bumps (yet I really shouldn't have) since we came as a large party of 12 and the fact that there were other similar celebratory parties there. However, what I didn't expect to have spent 2 hours waiting for my appetizer! Or that all the food wasn't brought out at once but one by one. The waitress seemed to have needed more help as she was juggling two large parties. That's when another waitress assisted and took more orders. As time went on, we sustained our patience since when knew it was a hectic night; but when we stopped being hungry (yes stopped!) after the long wait, frustration grew.  The original waitress was so busy trying to resolve mistakes with another table that she neglected us, leaving the graduate without dinner! We were quite disappointed and soon requested the manager.  The manager listened to our complaints and made efforts to resolve them by taking 2 items off the bill, giving free appetizers/dessert coupons, and finally getting our orders out. We appreciated this. The food was okay. I don't think I'd come to this Friday's anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove
Apephanie P.,"Philadelphia, PA",120,156,567,3.0,1/17/2017,This location is a hit/miss. I usually come & sit at the bar the only bartender that does the drinks good/strong is a guy w a grill in his mouth idk his name.  Everyone else's drinks aren't as good. I asked for the boneless jack Daniel wings ($5 special) & french fries. When I received the tab the wings were priced at $10.50 I asked the waitress is the wings still $5 she told me no they aren't anymore. Ok cool I pay my tab & wait for food. A few people next to me gets another waitress & asks for the $5 wings among other things.  So they DID have the five dollar special wings still my waitress must didn't care to change my tab or didn't know what the heck she was doing. Then when I got my food to go the wings were cold hard & dry like they were sitting literally all day. Worse takeout experience at a fridays joint!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove
Cali C.,"Philadelphia, PA",25,1,1,1.0,6/25/2017,"This place used to be good. I find this place very disgusting. The host doesn't have a smile. She placed us at a booth that was super dirty underneath. I wouldn't noticed until my son kicked a cup underneath the table. I used my flash light and it was liquid everywhere. I asked to switch booth n that was done quickly. However, no one cleaned up the mess even though I stated what was the issue was. They didn't clean up and served the next guest that same dirty table. Service was super slow. Took 10 mins for a server to show up when I asked someone if a server can come to take our order. Took 49 mins food to come and it wasn't a busy Sunday either. This place needs major help. New management needs to come along if this TGIF wants to continue to do business.!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove
Adam G.,"Philadelphia, PA",34,18,1,1.0,4/2/2017,"Bathroom is a mess, light fixture by the doorway is messed up, trash and debris on floors,  slow service every step of the process.   I would complain to a manager, but the number of f bombs I hear in the service station are probably a good indication that it won't make a difference. Now if this wasn't bad enough..... They sat my party at a table which was clearly set up for a party of ten and then we had to move. We had to ask for crayons for the kids. If I am paying 8 bucks for mozz sticks, 11 for a burger and you have the balls to charge me an extra dollar (on top of that 6 dollar kids meal) for my kids apple juice, I expect your establishment to be clean as the very least. I will not return, as the appearance of this place is probably very indicative of their kitchen and it's management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove

Amanda U.,"Philadelphia, PA",383,12,6,1.0,10/8/2016,"I've been to TGI Fridays twice, and me and my sister were looking for a decently quick place to eat, but still could dine in. Upon coming in, we WERE NOT greeted, there was around 10 people waiting and it was no organized at all, no one took our names down, etc. the manager was running back and forth trying to accommodate the parties, and she seemed like she was having a hard time. There were plenty of tables open, so I don't understand why it took so long to get us a seat. After waiting around ~10-15 minutes, we were seated at a table in the far corner by the kitchen.  Me and my sister were seated and looked at the menu. We waited ANOTHER ~5-10 minutes to be greeted by our server. But after we placed our order, it took him OVER SEVEN minutes to bring out water for us to drink?! I could have been dehydrated for all I know. But, a nice lady came and gave us our water.  It's not really dinner time YET, it's only 4 o'clock and all I can hear is the manager in the kitchen yelling at employees to ""get silverware clean"" or hurry everything up. Not the best atmosphere. I've been here for more than a half hour and our food has not come out yet. VERY SLOW SERVICE!!!!!!!!  After speaking with a general manager, our food came out. AFTER AN HOUR. Our food is COLD. It's not fresh. Not hot.. this is unacceptable. I waited over an hour for my food, and my food is not hot at all. I am never coming back here again. We got our main entree BEFORE our appetizer?! We talked to a manager, once again, and 20 minutes later. We finally get our appetizer. The manager came and addressed the issues, and offered us a job. Why would I want to work in a place where I was extremely dissatisfied? The marinara sauce on the appetizer a dark film on top. It looked like it had been sitting out overnight. Honestly, this is one of the worst experiences I've had. But, I appreciate the manager, Cameron, accommodating the situation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove
Christopher K.,"Elkins Park, PA",10,3,,1.0,12/23/2016,"What a disappointment! First, we had to wait twenty minutes to be seated. There were plenty empty tables that we could see. When we finally got seated it took another fifteen minutes for the waitress to show up. Another ten minutes before we could actually order our food. The waitress told us that they were out of burgers. I ordered Golden Fried Shrimps. The covering just fell off of the shrimps. The fries were stale and soggy. I wanted to called the manager over and make him/her taste the food do bad. But it may take another half an hour I decided not to. Granted it is a busy shopping season and this joint is located inside a shopping mall I thought the restaurant was way under staffed and way under stocked.

Trisha A.,"Telford, PA",27,1,,1.0,4/23/2017,"I went here last night with two friends at the location in the willow grove mall. I wasn't that hungry but I wanted to drink with my friends who were ordering expensive meals and I was just going to get a salad. (My one friend got the steak and apps and my other friend got, drinks, apps and a burger). Well I got to the table and asked my waitress (a young African American lady with curly hair in a pony tail and large hoop earrings) for a 11 dollar drink and a water. She comes back with my drink and forgets my water. No big deal. I asked her again ""can I have a water?"" and she said ""sure."" Then, she comes back with my friends apps and forgets my water again. Once again, no big deal, it was kind of busy, but not over whelming. So I asked again for just a water an she assures me, she will get it.  Keep in mind, I was right next to the drink station, not even ten feet away. She comes back and clears my friends plates and asks my friend if he wants another drink. No water for me. At this point, I'm done. I go up to the bartenders and get my water there. The rest of the night it seemed like she was ignoring me, but kept addressing my friends. Four times I asked for just a single water and was insanely thirsty. Another server came to drop off entrees and I asked her for a water again and she came right back with it! Seriously you can't get water?! I used to be a server, so I brushed off the 3 times I asked you and you didn't get me it, but seriously, but then you ignored me. I was polite the whole time. My friend was paying for me so we left 3 dollars on a 81 dollar tab. Not sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove
PA19124 0.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,20,1,1.0,1/8/2017,"I ordered online to make the process quick and simple. No one can mess your order up if you send them the order, right?? Wrong I get there at the 6:10 mark when my food was supposed to be done. No greeting at the door, host was on his phone. I walk up to the bar and stand to the side since I assume this is where I would pick it up. Bartender looks at me, but continues doing what she is doing without a word. Another bartenders walks over to the bar, and I see them cleaning or mixing or whatever they are doing.  After a few minutes I had to interrupt and ask if I pick up online orders here. The girl comes over and asks me what I ordered. It was a jack daniels burger and a margarita mix. She asked the other bartender to make the margarita mix. Not sure why this wasn't done when I ordered almost 30 minutes ago. She then takes a bag that's tied up at the end of the bar and checks to see if it's my food. She pushed it in front of me and didn't say a word.  10 minutes later I'm being handed the margarita mix by the other bartender, who opens the tied bag and put it inside. I get to my car, and thank God I was starving and planned to eat in the car, because when I opened the bag it was chicken.  So I go back inside and say this wasn't a burger. The girl asked what I ordered and I said a jack daniels burger, no cheese, with fries. 15 minutes later a burger comes out. No utensils, no napkins. I get to the car and go to eat, no jack daniels sauce. No mayo. Dry burger. And no seasoning on my seasoned fries. Super pissed.  The very next morning, I woke up sick as ever throwing up at least 3 times throughout the day. Stomach cramps, fever, chills. The whole food poisoning shebang. To make matters worse, this was a redemption of my stripes. What a waste.  The only good thing about this trip was that after taking the first wrong order, I didn't drive 35 minutes back home to sit down and eat to only realize I was given the wrong food. This will be last time I ever visit this Fridays. I will drive into the city and pay for parking before I ever eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove

It had far too much crushed red pepper flakes, it tasted as if it was covered with chopped red peppers instead of tomatoes. It was also lukewarm.  - My husbands dinner was a jack Daniels burger, missing jack Daniels sauce it is supposed to come with and without the requested mayo.  - We waited several minutes and no one came to check, so I went in search of the waiter.  - Manager took my dinner off the bill and apologized, offered to get something else.  I declined.

I took my kids there one afternoon while it was slow to get a big burger. It came out so greasy I had to ask for another bun because so much grease had soaked in from the meat, it was a disgusting soggy crouton. The meat was not seasoned and was very boring. I make better at home and would rather have had a burger from Wendy's value menu. I expect mediocre cuisine at a chain but this burger was a complete waste of money AND they charge a dollar extra to put cheese on a kids' burger. Get real, Friday's. Prices are comparable to Cheesecake Factory, which is also in the mall. I will be going there next time I want to splurge for a big burger.  Just to be positive, I will say the staff is nice and the location is great for meeting people and I imagine it's a fine choice for a casual drink, but I think I'm done with Friday's food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove?start=60

The Parmesan chicken was too small to be considered an entree, the steak was not cooked to what my boyfriend had ordered, the alcoholic beverages were made with too much syrup, and more.

Jamie M.,"Conshohocken, PA",629,859,708,3.0,3/31/2012,"I really should have read the reviews or at the very least listened when our waiter warned us when we wanted food without seasoning that he couldn't make any promises since he wasn't sure the people in the kitchen wouldn't deviate from the way they want to make things. I really thought he was joking; it turns out he wasn't. The green bean fries (one of my guilty pleasures) was about the only thing that came out right. Our water came about 5 minutes after when our waiter realized we'd been waiting about 30 min for it. My shrimp came out marinated with tons of seasoning instead of plain and grilled like I asked and my friends meat came out cooked wrong. (The waitress/server who brought it actually asked my friend to cut it to make sure it was cooked all the way! Who does that?) At the point our correctly prepared and cooked entrees came out, we asked for dessert to go; simple enough, no? Nope, managed to screw that up too. I had a hankering that they would probably screw that up as well, so I checked while our waiter went to grab the check. His was right, mine was a giant Oreo cookie rather than a cheesecake. The manager was also at our table multiple times throughout the experience and really didn't offer much in the way of making the experience better. (Pretty much just let us know the food was pre-marinated and we were SOL for that particular dish) Our waiter was comical, but I don't go out to TGI's for comedy. For food, avoid like the plague. I'm actually half surprised I didn't get food poisoning with all the corruption I'm sure is taking place back in the kitchen area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove?start=40
Luke S.,"Collegeville, PA",21,49,2,1.0,12/25/2013,"Purely awful. Our party of ten waited for 45 minutes while smaller and larger groups who showed up after us were seated. Both the food we ordered and the free appetizers we were promised were unsatisfactory. We even had to chase down our server for utensils and napkins. When we settled up we voiced our displeasure and a young employee stood by smirking as we spoke to the manager. It was the most disrespectful thing I've experienced as a customer in a restaurant. A number of us emailed the manager, I tweeted the official Friday's Twitter, all with no response.

Laney B.,"Willow Grove, PA",47,12,1,1.0,4/15/2013,"We eat here often and by we I mean a party no smaller than 7 normally. The food has steadily been getting worse and the service had never been very good. Tonight it was down right horrible!!! I would not come back nor would I recommend this restaurant, I can't even say with new management I would recommend it. I know I will never go back, at least to this particular restaurant. Every Saturday night we go out to dinner, this week we had trouble finding a place to accommodate our large party without an hour or more wait. This was the only good thing about this Friday's on Saturday night. Without calling out the waitress, I'll save that for the letter I send to corporate, it was the absolute worst experience I have ever had.  It didn't start out so bad, we were seated right away (we called ahead), the waitress came over and took drink orders and handed out menus, explained the insert, then said she would be right back with the drinks.  She comes back about 5 minutes later, walks up to one in our party and THEN asks see an ID because he ordered a beer. She should have asked when he placed the order not after she went to the bar and placed the order. Okay, so mistake, we'll let it go it can happen but it wasn't that busy so hmmm... We got our drinks, she says I'll be back and leaves again. What? When she comes back she takes the appetizer order then says okay I'll put this in and be back. Why? She should have asked if we were ready to order dinner, not assume we were not and leave yet again. By this time we had been here about a half hour. Way to long to not have our order taken. We place our order, I was last in the line, no biggie - you would think. She brings out the plates and napkins for appetizers, there are 8 of us, she brings 4 napkins. REALLY??!!!! We then had to ask someone else for silverware because apparently she thinks we were to eat with our fingers.  Appetizers come out, not very hot - not complaining, we're hungry. Plates get cleared, then 4 dinners come out. Again, REALLY! The food should all come out at once, not separately. Then 2 more come out, then 1 more comes out. My sister asks for mayo, I ask for yellow mustard. The waitress comes back with the mustard but not the mayo, and I'm still sitting with no food. She finally realizes I don't have my dinner and she says let  me go check on it. Next thing I know, she says ""my bad, I didn't put the order in"". ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! Meanwhile, I walked up to find a manager, explained to him what happened so far, he doesn't apologize just says let me check on your food...still no mayo.  My burger comes out finally, it's a hockey puck - totally burnt. I say something again, he puts in another order. I look at my sister and say if it doesn't come out right I'm leaving, she could find me in the mall. It's the wrong burger!! What the hell?? I'm done at this point, not even wanting to eat, someone said just eat it, nope -didn't order it don't want it. My brother in law gets up, tells the manager that it's the wrong burger, I get up & walk out. I could not possibly have taken any more. I'm not sure what was worse, the waitress obviously not being trainer properly or the manager not reacting to the situation. At least he didn't defend her, that's happened to me before. I can't say I will never eat at a Friday's again because I really do like the place, I will not go back to this one again or at least not within the next year. We're running out of places to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove?start=40

My husband went to use the bathroom where the toilet was clogged with fecal matter and shitty underwear on the floor. We told the staff about the incident just so they were aware and the waitress rolled her eyes and walked off with out saying a word. Our table was located right next to the kitchen we watched a waiter put his hands in a customers food I guess to see if it was warm absolutely disgusting. I was going to ask to see a manger but we couldn't leave fast enough. We paid our bill without ordering any dinner and went to the cheesecake factory.

Amanda H.,"Lansdale, PA",7,52,2,1.0,2/19/2013,"I used to really like coming to Fridays for a quick bite when I didn't feel like cooking. Last night, we went there for a late dinner because I worked until 9:30. It wasn't very busy, probably about 5 checks at the bar, and two or three tables.  First we ordered drinks. My bf wanted the ""bee sting"", some new drink they have, but, they only had frozen honey, so they couldn't make it. I'm not sure why you would freeze honey, since it doesn't go bad.....actually I didn't even know you could freeze honey, but okay. So he got the Grey Goose Cooler, which was EXTREMELY sour and had about 5 lime wedges shoved into it. I ordered the skinny blackberry margarita, which was also extremely sour, and had so many blackberries muddled into the bottom it was almost impossible to drink through a straw.  We ordered our food, me the Grilled Salmon and Langistino lobster with mashed potatoes and the vegetable medley, my bf the $5 cheeseburger from the late night menu. We also wanted the soft pretzels for an app, but they were apparently out, and had been since Happy Hour, which had been almost 4.5 hours prior.....so after about 20-25 minutes of sitting and waiting for the food, the bartender comes out to tell me they are also out of mashed potatoes. I replaced them with French fries. The food finally comes out, and boy was it bad. First, and this is just a pet peeve of mine, there was no ketchup in the bottle near us, and No other bottles of ketchup around the bar, so the bartender had to walk to the kitchen to get us ketchup. My salmon and ""lobster"" was a total joke, with there being no visible lobster in the sauce, just gigantic mushrooms. The vegetable medley was zucchini (not quite a medley) and so overlooked it was soft and soggy, basically in edible. To top it off, the entire plate was so salty it was almost impossible to eat. I've never had salty salmon before, and i dont recommend it. If it hadn't been almost 11:30, and I didn't want to just go home, I would have definitely complained. My boyfriends meal was also so salty he couldn't even eat his French fries.  (Sidenote: if I had wanted to complain, it probably would have been almost impossible, since the manager was too busy chatting up two guys sitting down the bar from us, making sure their drinks were filled and the got their food and that they didn't have any dirty plates in front of them. This was the entire time we were there, she didnt leave them.) So in conclusion, we aren't going back. If I want to go to a chain, there are plenty of other restaurants in the area, (thinking specifically of Applebees and Ruby Tuesdays, always have good experiences here) that have better service, don't run out of food, don't over salt their food to the point of in edibilty, and don't make you pay $20 for a meal with lobster that has no lobster. There are also plenty more restaurants that have healthy options, since Fridays basically has none (those right portion right price options are a joke, still more then half your days points if you are on weight watchers) and even if you try to have something healthy-ish, they pour a cup of salt on it, cause nothing can be healthy at Fridays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove?start=40

Our upgraded review is for the people that work there, and the excellence in service that is rarely seen at a Place like TGI.  Morgan was over the top in the way of service and the rest of the staff added to the excellent time there tonight.

They really need to clean house from the Manger down to  house cleaning. They need a lot of training. The hostess had to help clean off the tables.  they didn't know what tables was clean and available you had to walk around and look for your own table at the high top table. Is better than walking around double checking to see if it was a table all the tables with someone finally got up. And the table was dirty they didn't have a lot of high tables. And when you came into the restaurant no one was there to greet you and it wasn't that crowded and then when they finally came out of the kitchen. The Hostess  said it was going to be a five minute wait then a10 minute wait and then you We finally got seated. Then we got seated the hostess said that one side is Large then the other side and it might be  tight. She was talking about the seats to the table. But if she knew that it was like that why the hell would you sit us there. Then we get a waitress that was rude she seemed like she was tired worn out had a bad day and the Manger should've sent her home. She took our order which was water and then came back put them on the table. And didn't come back to our table for about  5 to 10 minutes then she took the couple order that came in behind us first and was ready to order. So me and my husband was just sitting there talking until she came back. Then I asked her about the rewards card and she was getting smart about the question. That I was asking her. Do we get tortilla chips and salsa. The she left again and We never give her our oder. She came back and said are you ready now and I said excuse me. And I told her that We been ready when you brought the water and you walked away. Because we was looking at menu while We was waiting to be seated. I told her well it seems like you don't want to work today and you don't want a tip so we need to gave our to some else. So we got up and ask for the Manger so We talked to him and he wanted to give us another table and We both said no thanks and went to Chili's down the road and had a good dinner and everyone was FRIENDLY .

My wife didn't receive her appetizer till the main course came ( about 45 minutes after the order was placed). By the time everyone got their food we had to leave ( total time in the restaurant was over an hour and a half). When leaving because of being in a rush I had left my glasses there when I called twenty minutes later they could find them and told me to call back. Called back following day and was on hold for about ten minutes before I talked to a manager. When I did he told me he had not seen them but would personally walk the restaurant and look then give me a call back. Four hours later and I'm still waiting. I usually don't bother my self with bad reviews. But this needed to be said. AVOID this restaurant if you can, for the price to service ratio it's a rip off.

Beers.  And one had to be comped because it was flat and disgusting.  It was not the beers fault it was a Bud Light.  It was bad regardless.  We were told when the bartender, I guess from the service bar, finally STARTED on our DRINKS.   Now as for the food.  Four burgers Classic, Cheddar Bacon, JD, and something else.  Never have I in restaurant history received UPDATES on when different burgers were ready, which is disappointing to know because then you know what is ready is just hangin under a heat lamp or something.  And ever the kitchen manager came out to speak to us with an update on burgers!!! wow.  And there seemed to a problem with the Garlic Parm Potato Wedges, which is nothing but the same crap out of a bottle they put on the shitty crust at Dominos.

First we were not greeted by the host. He simply asked how many and then proceeded to communicate with hand and head gestures.  He seated us and we then waited over ten minutes for a server to greet us.  The server was inattentive and unanimated, she did nothing to cover her obvious disdain for her job. We then waited another ten mins before drinks appeared.  My childs meal and our app appeared in a timely manner, but our meals (two salads and another app) took another forty mins to come out. During the meal no one checked on us or came to refill drinks.  My child had long since lost her patience for sitting and yet the server took another fifteen mins to appear with the check. We watched as other tables were also treated in this manner, with no staff in sight to tend to anyone's needs. As someone who has waited tables I was very disappointed with the lack of any sort of friendly service and the utter failure that was this meal.  Half our party had to leave before the food was even at the table because of the length of time we waited.  I would not recommend this place to anyone and I question how they even remain in business.  I will also be sending this review to corporate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove?start=20

He had to be asked if he could find out for sure. The restaurant was empty when we got here but it took a while to be seated anyway. Understandable because it was late; however, the dining area was filthy. We had to switch chairs from another table after the host left because there was a sticky substance on one of them. Trash was visible on the floor around the table. We were hungry so we ordered anyway. When the food came out it wasn't what I expected. I  asked the waitress about it because I hadn't been to a tgi fridays in a while and I guessed the menu changed. The waitress proceeded to stick her hands on my plate and directly touch the food with her fingers moving it around on the plate to count the shrimp. I asked her to take it back and declined a new plate. Never in my life have I had someone blatantly touch my food like that. The manager never came to speak with us. In addition to this the waitress never asked us if we would like refills or if we needed anything. The soda was flat and I was charged $3 for it. You'd think after touching my food they'd at least comp the soda. It doesn't seem they're spending any money on cleaning supplies. Never coming back here and would suggest no one else does either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove?start=20
Glenda C.,"Philadelphia, PA",49,46,94,2.0,4/19/2015,Service sucks here ...... It's a hit or miss place. I usually sit at the bar where its a little better.

Michael G.,"Lansdale, PA",1,10,4,1.0,5/14/2016,"Run away.  I INGESTED METAL IN MY FOOD LAST TIME I WAS HERE!  The management offered a handful of free appetizers and I accepted as I give everyone the benefit of the doubt.  Tonight i came back in, was very happy with my waitress, she was wonderful.  We got cold appetizers to start.  OK.  Let it go.  One of the plates of nachos was unrecognizable as well as cold.  Then we received HORRIBLE food.  I could not eat the steak, it was just really terrible meat, no blame on the cook.  My wife and children both turned down their food.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and did not sue the first time, when I should have, considering my child could have ingested the metal on the last trip.  This location is disgusting and knowing restauraunts i promise you if the health department showed up right now they would shut this place down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove?start=20
Tracy C.,"Philadelphia, PA",108,6,,2.0,12/5/2015,Horrible visit. Sizzling chicken & shrimp was not sizzling & they threw some cold veggies on the plate. The chicken was undercooked. Manager came out and was pleasant. Drinks were also not up to par. Very disappointed with whole experience today.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove?start=20
Roger L.,"Drexel Hill, PA",2,10,,1.0,8/19/2016,"Terrible service. Didn't get water or drinks until half my meal was finished  Server could nt be found for refills etc. Dropped check on table and ran away, never asking if we wanted coffee or desert. Came back in two minutes asking if we paid yet. The only attention she was willing to give our table was to rush is out the door. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove?start=20
Barbara L.,"Abington, PA",0,2,,2.0,8/17/2016,If you are going to call and order your food you might as well just ask to speak to the manager and make sure it gets put in. The whole point to was for me to call and order it so it be ready the time I got there but it wasn't the person taking my order never put it in but had me on the here he phone for 10 minutes acting like he wrote it down. Pretty pissed then on top I had to go back to work but no i had to wait another 25 minutes for the food so I spoke to the manager and told him u need to train the employees the whole point of take out is so the food is done he apologized and said it won't happen again and key point customer service really for the 50 I spend and time wasted I should have walked out. Management have changed since the time I have been going from before. What is a free app card going to do I'll use it and never go there again smh,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove?start=20
Wise M.,"Haymarket, VA",20,42,146,4.0,9/1/2014,"I enjoy Fridays overall.  It's like most sports bars except they're better cause you can get points for your purchases.  Currently, I think I have 1700 stripe points. Anywho, the food at Fridays is ok. I don't really get excited about the food but I enjoy eating here. This location is decent because it's at the mall and after shopping you can grab a bit to eat. See, does that sound exciting? The staff is friendly, polite, and the restaurant is always clean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-willow-grove?start=20
