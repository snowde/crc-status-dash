Nijole T.,"Los Angeles, CA",3083,6380,5218,2.0,3/12/2015,"Another invitation I should have not bothered to accept. Friends wanted to come here and not knowing another place in Yorba Linda that i wanted to go to off the top of my head I shrugged and went along. Not even wanting to look at the menu, I shared the appetizer platter with a friend. While nothing was disgusting, the quality was just horrendous, the presentation lackluster, no cooking skills required. Service like from a zombie, the whole place just gives off a cheap, artificial vibe. Wait was way too long, prices way too high, should have followed my husbands rule, if they sell the stuff at the grocery store, don't eat it, they are tearing open the same boxes in the kitchen that you get at the store. Pass next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=20
Betty B.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,6,,5.0,1/21/2017,"First of all, let me say that I'm a regular TGI Friday customer at most of the Friday Restaurants.  But because of one of the Bartender/Server's at this location, I have been coming to this location for at least 20 years now and at least twice a month, if not more.  They have the Best Bartender here by the name of ""Izzy"".  I don't care how busy it may be, Izzy always provides the ""Best"" service, has the Best personality, and makes the Best drinks in town.  As a matter of fact, once he sees me, he already knows what drink I like, ""Long Island Iced Tea"".  I usually bring a lunch guest or two with me.  If all the Servers had his personality and memory, all I can say is WOW, what an asset to TGI Fridays.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=20
Diana T.,"Anaheim, CA",920,630,1456,3.0,1/19/2014,"Pretty much one of the only decent places to go is TGI Friday's to get a drink in this area!  My friends and I came out here to celebrate my friends 21st birthday. Place was pretty dead when we got here around 8:45pm.  Sat at the booth in the bar and ordered a couple of drinks.  We were full from our dinner but when you happen to ""Check-In"" to this place, it states that you can get a free appetizer.  When we showed our server, she said that this deal was only up to $8.  Well they should state that on the yelp thing of course but that was okay, because we were still a bit hungry after our dinner.  We were all craving sweets so each of us got a dessert as well.  We ordered Loaded Skillet Chip Nachos ($9.89)Home-style potato chips with melted cheese and bacon crumbles, stacked in a skillet and smothered in white cheddar queso. Garnished with more bacon crumbles and green onions.  Hmmmm sounded good but it was just way too salty!!  Made me want to have a heart attack!  This thing was super heavy and made me feel sick after a couple of bites. Brownie Obsession ($5.99) A warm brownie made with Ghirardelli® chocolate-fudge sauce. Topped with vanilla ice cream, caramel and pecans. So good and fudgey!!  Love the ice cream on top and definitely love the combination of hot and cold!  Very rich brownie as well! Tennessee Whiskey Cake: A warm toffee cake topped with glazed pecans and vanilla ice cream. Served with butterscotch Jack Daniel's® Whiskey sauce.  Very moist and rich as well!  LOVE IT! Washington Apple martini ($7.99)-  Love it!  Super strong! Atmosphere is a very older crowd, well compared to us.  Some people were playing poker on the TV screens as well.  I guess this is not a terrible place to come to considering there is nothing in this area.   NOTE: -Clean bathrooms -Check-In on Yelp for a free appetizer (up to $8) -Happy hour!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=20
Ted A.,"Anaheim, CA",16,1,1,1.0,3/6/2016,"My girlfriend ordered the tiramisu martini and it was very short, about an inch and a half short. I told the waiter to mention it to the bartender.

We were like 15 all in all.  My food had to be sent back 3 times because it was not right, and when I got it the 4th time it still was not right, but I ate it anyway.  My youngest son, 18, who doesn't speak up, never got his burger... everyone was practically done before anyone realised that he wasn't eating.  The manager came around and comp'd the 2 meals.

Heather G.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,14,,1.0,12/22/2015,"When I came to write this review I was actually surprised to find only 2.5 stars. I thought we just had a bad experience, but after reading other reviews I can see the management clearly doesn't care.  If I could give zero stars I would.  When we first walked in the host was rude. That should have been our first indication to leave. After we got sat, it took over twenty minutes for our server to get our drink orders. We both ordered boneless wings. One order was cold as one was mediocre at best. After another twenty minutes we flagged down a server to order another round, hoping these would be better. We were wrong again. We decided to change the flavor because the first round wasn't good.  The second round was worse than the first. Everything was practically tasteless.  At this point, we had been there for over an hour. We couldn't find our server again so we flagged down another one to request our check. We waited 15 more minutes and still no check. Finally our server come by and we ask him for the check. He said he would get it, and we waited another 15 minutes. He returned without the check!!! We said we really have to go and need our check. We got the bill and it had our $20, and $80 in other charges. At the bottom of the check the $80 was removed and we were left with the actual charges. To think they think that was worth 100 dollars is absolutely absurd.  This was the worst restaurant experience I have ever encountered in my life. Needless to say, we will never be returning. If this place wants to stay in business, they have a lot of work to do, starting with customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=20
Adriana F.,"Riverside, CA",27,16,2,1.0,2/28/2016,"Writing this review as my food gets cold cause it was brought to my table first while we wait for the other 4 plates for my family......I should have known this was going to be a crappy experience since the waitress was lacking a personality and took our order as if she was being inconvenienced by our presence. I got the Friday's shrimp, i think McDonald's might offer better food and service, though I hate their food and haven't been there in years, this is a horrible ""restaurant"" I wouldn't call it a restaurant.......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=20

Kelsie W.,"Anaheim, CA",1,3,,1.0,7/29/2016,"Worst service ever. Never coming back here again. First got seated, then waited 30 minutes for some random person to take our drink order. Our waitress Mayra, who we just then met, came over with 4 drinks even though we ordered 3. She mistakenly gave me an alcoholic drink even though I'm only 18. After all this frustration, we asked 5 people for the manager, David, and after 10 minutes he finally showed up. He discounted our appetizers.

Matthew J.,"Yorba Linda, CA",164,316,95,3.0,2/6/2015,"Our afternoon at Friday's started off Meh and ended up A-OK. This place was quiet on a Monday and we sat in the bar area, planning to get our grub on with some appetizers (HALF PRICE). It took twelve minutes for anyone to come and take our order after the host left us. Eventually a server came by and said she'd get our order started on behalf of the bartender who'd be taking care of us. We saw this bartender at our table exactly one time - after our food had arrived. She asked if we were okay. At that point we were - we had our food. The food was actually pretty good!

When we asked someone who are server was for the area, they had no idea.  WORST PART- My dad mentioned to the front about how he was disappointed on the lack of service. When I walked out a couple steps behind him, the 2 male hostesses at the front talked about us saying how we essentially had no right to complain since we just there.

Brandon C.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",237,20,,1.0,10/10/2015,"My friends and I have come here pretty frequently considering how close it is to all of us. Every time the service has gotten worse and worse. I really don't like making bad reviews but I feel if this place wants to stay in business, it needs to straighten up a bit. Every single time we have come, there always seems to be some adjustment made to the endless appetizers which we always get. it's supposed to be like 10 bucks or something, but they always come back with the bill saying we shared or got the ""premium"" appetizers when we didn't. $10? No, no. More like a $24 dollar bill. For appetizers microwaved in the back and take 20 minutes to come out to you each time which they consider premium, keep in mind. Last time we went there was kind of the final straw. The waitress started off by giving us all the stink eye when we mentioned we wanted the bill split prior to ordering. Just so we could save the trouble, you know? She looked at us like we were dumb. That was pretty rude, first of all. Service was slow as hell throughout the whole time we were there. She comes back with our bills not split like we asked. We correct her, she finally splits it. Due to our previous experience in getting overcharged for apparently ordering premium appetizers, we were sure not to do that. The bill said we did and we argued that we didn't. Our waitress argued that she has it written down that that is what we ordered. Okay? She could have written anything on that piece of paper. Just because she misheard us doesn't mean we ordered premium appetizers.  We are fed up, we pay and leave. Friend goes back in because he forgot his debit card. Oh weird, she doesn't seem to know where it went. We follow them around, talk to the manager and wait around for 15 minutes. Lo and behold, there's the card that she ""found on the ground.""  I understand food industry is hard. I've been in it. But when you're rude from beginning to end, and can't even practice simple work ethics, then you don't deserve to be in this business. Straighten up your employee's TGI Friday's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=20

I've been sitting in a bar booth, in a semi empty restaurant for the last 50 min, board out of my mind. My food is not here yet, my drink was weak, and the waitress has a crappy attitude. I'd walk out if I wasn't starving. 10 min latter. My food is here now, and apparently the chief can not read in English. I specifically asked for no bell pepper in my cajun chicken & shrimp pasta, and it has bell pepper. I m still waiting for a water, and my wife's vegetable melody is pure Broccoli.

Sheila J.,"Placentia, CA",252,416,2148,5.0,6/25/2016,"I had the privilege, of dining at TGIF's, Friday night. I had been to this location a few times before, but it had been maybe 2 years since I last visited.  Parking is always great, since it's park of a large shopping center. In fact, if you're a window shopper, you could spend all day, checking out store after store!  The exterior is always landscaped well, colorful, clean, and inviting.  Upon entering, two hostesses were there, to greet me. I find that crucial, as I dine out often and like to feel welcomed and valued, as a paying customer. I was sat in Lauren's section. She acknowledged me, within a reasonable time frame, and started drink orders immediately.  I love this menu. It's colorful, organized, expansive, has assorted photos, AND LISTS CALORIE COUNTS!  I loved that I had several choices, at creating a healthy dinner option, that could keep me under 500 calories! I could even sample an appetizer (up to $8 free, with a Yelp check-in) and add a beer (Michelob Ultra) and still feel great about my plan to control what I eat.  The tables have the ziosk, which is now a hit with families. We briefly played Millionaire Monopoly, but it's another way to keep kids entertained (and patient) if need be.  The food all tasted delicious, was reasonable in portion size, and came out at the right temperature. Overall, we really enjoyed our experience and will return relatively soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda

We didn't wanna waste it, so we thought why not give it a try again. And I say again because the last time we went to TGI Fridays (Torrance) it was just awful.  Unfortunately, this location was just as awful. Customer service was okay, but the food sucks! Food looked much better in the menu with vibrant photos.   We had... -JACK SLIDERS  $9- I appreciate the huge portion, but the patty was a tough.  -PECAN CRUSTED CHICKEN SALAD -$11 Chicken was barely warm and tasted like it was microwaved. But I did like the lightly dressed greens with balsamic vinaigrette, pecans, mandarin oranges and blue cheese. -FISH and CHIPS - Don't get it! I warned El Hubby not to get it, but he didn't listen, so he regretted it. It was too salty!!!! Yuck! -MARGARITA- The bartender said ""here's your iced margarita"" lol. El Hubby got it in blended and he said it was a tad bit too sweet.  We came around 8:15pm on a week night. We were seated by the bar area because the dining area was closed.

The food was not as good as we've had on prior visits.  The rice pilaf I ordered was just some white rice with little seasoning.  My steak was full of gristle and more cooked than a medium steak should be.  The Mac and cheese was the shining spot and really saved the meal, that gooey cheese innards with panko topping really is a killer combo.

Complete waste of money. $12 for a few scraps of chicken? Seriously? This is far from a 2 star restaurant, I would probably have preferred Denny's to be honest.  The service sucks. Waitress stops by very sparingly. She only refilled 2 of the 4 water glasses at our table. Can you guess which glasses she filled? The 2 closest to her.  The spinach dip didn't taste very good. And the amount we got isn't worth $10 in my opinion. Nothing here is priced properly to be honest, I regret going here, everything on the menu should be at least $3 cheaper to better reflect the value.  No napkins at our table. No silverware.

As for the entrees, we both opted for burgers. Now, I was under the impression that the appetizer came first before the entrée. On this visit, it was the exact opposite! Burgers first, then the artichoke dip afterwards! I then attempted to ask the waitress of the issue. Apparently, she had forgotten to place our appetizer on the bill! Uh oh! I did not get upset. I was just kinda surprised! As for the food, the burgers were amazing. I usually opt for the Jack Daniels burger. My foodie date had the same. Amazing I say! It literally was empty. Wow! Maybe it was due to the area where it was located! It is in a big area that looks secluded at first. Honestly, I chose this place because I happened to see the sign off the 91 freeway coming home.  Our waitress was very apologetic with the situation and for that, I cannot say or leave such negativity on a review. Maybe I just came on a not so good day.

I hate going places and happy hour is $1 off pizza, $3 domestic beers (that's how much they should be anyway), and $4 well cocktails. No, friends. TGI Friday's happy hour menu provides enough options to enjoy your post work shenanigans. Unless you're a crazy health nut person, but if that's the case you shouldn't be here anyway.

Deborah A.,"Irvine, CA",62,125,373,3.0,2/10/2012,"Ironically, coming here on a Friday night at around 9 in Yorba Linda is still pretty busy. Our server was super chill. We originally came here to use the buy 1, get one free entree coupon, and wanted to get away with 2 of them, but he said that they may or may not, since they're getting more strict about it, but their manager agreed, and let us do it. I'm not sure how the Jack Daniel ribs came out, as my parents got it, but I got the 3 for $20 deal.  Their mozzarella sticks were typical, nothing usual, but the marinara sauce was STONE COLD. It was very hard and not appetizing. Even the warmth of the mozzarella sticks couldn't do anything.... I got the petite sirloin, it was nothing special. The meat lacked flavor, but TGIF isn't known for their steaks. The only good thing on my plate was the stuffed mashed potatoes, which had flavor.  My sister got the fried shrimp and fries, which was pretty cold. I don't think she liked it. The shrimp could have been crisper, it was more moist and soft to the touch. The fries, where to begin. I don't think they should have been called fries.... The dessert was alright. We got the vanilla bean cheesecake with chocolate sauce drizzled all over.  I think the only good thing about TGIF is the low price during happy hour and the 3 course meal for 2, if you're on a budget. Otherwise, go elsewhere for better food.

Tom A.,"Long Beach, CA",12,30,1,1.0,12/25/2013,"OK, I've come to understand that when you get bad service in a restaurant, only a portion of the blame can be directed at the server. After all, servers are generally only going to do as well as they've been trained to do. And when things go wrong, as some things apparently did on this visit, how they handle that will again be based on what they've been trained to do when things go wrong. That said, here's how my visit this evening went: I went in as a solo diner; the place was about half-full. I sat for at least 10 minutes, maybe closer to 15, before my server appeared to take my order. I expected my salad to come out soon after that, but 20 minutes later it hadn't arrived. My entree came out, but not my salad. I finished my entree completely, and still no salad. After waiting for probably another 10 minutes, I finally stopped my server as he went by and asked if I'd be getting my salad any time soon. He apologized, made a comment about problems in the kitchen (which I heard him mention to other customers), and went back to the kitchen. A few minutes later he re-appeared with my salad, which I'd ordered now nearly 45 minutes earlier.  I finished eating, paid my bill, and then found that I'd been shorted on my change. I was shorted only 34 cents so I wasn't going to make an issue of it. By that time I just wanted to leave and get home. Oh, yeah; the food was adequate.

Before.  Dinner did not arrive until 11:18p.   If it was not for the fact we were just thankful to have a first night out after having our third child, and that a restaurant was even open this late; we may have not been so tolerant!  Regardless, unacceptable service and I will be complaining to corporate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=160

Second, I think the restaurant as a whole is probably closer to a 3-3.5, but you simply can't beat the prices and amount of food you can get from HH. My coworkers and I usually sit in the bar area and the staff are familiar with us and treat us very well.  Jamie and Tim in particular are always extremely friendly, quick, and on point.  I really couldn't ask for more from them.  The appetizers are cheap and decently sized.  We almost always get the nachos, large and taste pretty good for what, $4?  $1.50 for a single slider or fries, $3.50 for a 20 oz beer, $4 well drinks. Overall, a good place to hang out after work with some friends and get cheap food and drinks.  It isn't a Michelin Star restaurant, but it's got a good atmosphere with great staff",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=120

Kerena M.,"Orange County, CA",30,30,1,2.0,2/11/2013,"I've never been a huge Friday's fan, but it's usually alright. We went last night for dinner. The waitress was really nice and we got a free appetizer because we checked in on Yelp. Yay for freebies! So the waitress was really nice, but the service sucked. She kept forgetting things. First of all, we had our 2-year-old with us. My husband and I ordered salads with our meals and she brought them out to us, which was fine, but she didn't bring anything out I had ordered for my daughter. Okay, if you're a parent, and your kid is hungry (and even if they're not hungry), you know to never eat in front of them because they'll flip out. She won't eat salad, so I couldn't share with her. She was going crazy asking where her food was. The waitress walked away and I had to flag her down to ask her to bring something for my very upset kid to eat. She brought crackers. Phew! For our free appetizer, we ordered the hummus. It was good, but I hate it when restaurants don't bring enough chips or bread or whatever you need to eat the dip. We took huge scoops of hummus on our chips, but by the time the small plate of chips was done, the hummus bowl was still half full. There was no offer of more chips. She didn't bring out the drink I ordered until half way through the meal when I reminded her that I had ordered an iced tea. She also didn't bring out the garlic breadsticks that came with my meal until I had finished eating everything and reminded her that I was supposed to have garlic breadsticks. Those were the most half-assed breadsticks I've ever seen and they didn't taste like they had any garlic on them. Yet they were called ""garlic breadsticks."" Disappointment. Our drinks (water and iced tea) were never refilled. The food was good, but the service was really bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=120

My honest advice to this place is that 1.)if TGI wants to continue run business in an area like east Yorba Linda, the food quality really need to go up.

It taste horrible, so I politely asked the server if she could change the drink for me and which one would she recommend that tasted sweet and sour as a mojito and that the bar tender did well. So she recommended some raspberry drink and she told me that was very good. Well, when I got the drink it was undrinkable! It was so so strong but I thought that maybe it was just me... So I told my husband to try it out and he thought the same thing his face just got disfigured when he had the first taste!

For appetizers, it sure did take a while, we finished our drinks and ordered another round before they brought out our food. The one thing that stood out was the mozzarella sticks we ordered, which came out last after our sesame jack chicken strips.  Sesame jack chicken strips were tasty but the mozzarella sticks came out warm and were not cheesy/gooey in any way. And the marinara sauce that came out with it was all watery and wouldn't even hold onto the mozzarella sticks if its life depended on it. I've had enough frozen food in my times to cautiously say those excuses for moz sticks  came straight from the freezer. I just hope they weren't serving food that I could've bought straight from the frozen section of my local grocery store and prepared better at home.

It's nice that they have a bigger menu selection than most other places I go to, but well...it's a chain restaurant.  And I do appreciate they're late hours. However, it's something about the over-sized booths that make you have to lift your arms high elbowing your neighbor just to cut the steak since the seats are so low (or table is too high).  And please TGIF if you're going to have a big display of alcohol up on display shelves above the bar (ie they're going to be there for a while since you probably need a high stool or short ladder to get them down), have them all faced forward...especially when they're square bottles. The dining experience here is never really that great.  However, I admit that the servers have been very accommodating to my family's whims and needs.  Not to say that we're ""those"" people.  But with my brother having a broken jaw wired shut, we asked to get his soups blended so he could drink it through a straw and they did their best.  Relatively at least lol...they were able to puree a broccoli cheese soup, but apparently not a creamy tomato soup...who knew?  And maybe I'm just lucky, but despite the fact that the actual steak cuts themselves (and quality) could be better...whenever I've ordered a medium-rare, it has actually come out...medium-rare.  Not medium-well like most places.  In the end though, the food is ""Meh.  I've experienced better.""

Conveniently located in Savi Ranch near the freeway (might not want to risk trying to navigate around Savi Ranch during rush hour). There is plenty of parking.  The host/hostess are ALWAYS very friendly and enthusiastic. Upon being seated, the guest is told the name of their server and wished an enjoyable meal (every time in my experience). I have not yet had a bad server/service there. Last night it was Joseph (Joe) and he was GREAT! He was friendly, attentive, accurate and very genuine & personable. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time, drinks were refilled in a timely manner as well. The resturant is clean and there is a patio which is nice, but it is somewhat bland and boring out there.  I won't comment on the taste of the food (since that is subjective and everyone's taste is different) but the quality of the ingredients is good and the food is appropriately hot or cold when it comes to the table.

They weren't busy at all and sat us right away but after that it all went down hill . The food was awful tasting and the service was awful . Our waitress was nice but we would ask for things and she would go missing for what felt like 30 mins . I knew it wasn't just me who was unhappy with our meal when I looked over and saw another couple sending their food back and I could hear the manager apologizing .

You would think that we have come far enough that the code would be unique and the server could use it. Something is broken if this isn't working.  The food, well, for the price it was just a 3 stars. It was cooked right and taste was what was expected.  Typical for a Fridays the place was noisy and when a large group left the clatter from the bus boys re-arranging the tables was a bit loud and annoying. I understand they have to reset, but this was near closing and there were no people waiting to be seated. The shuffle could have waited 10 minutes for us to be done and leave.

We did wait a good 15-20 min before the waitress took our drinks/order. We asked for water and lemon, only got water. When our food got to our table, the appetizer cheese sticks had hair on the plate (we were nice and didn't complain about that since the hair wasn't on any of the cheese sticks). The burger we ordered was over cooked and charred black, they brought us what looked like fries that somebody had been picking off the plate. To add onto the fries issue, the waitress did tell us that the fries were the last of the previous batch and that they would bring more on a separate plate. It was a joke. The pasta we ordered was horrible. The plate was hot but the pasta was cold, and the chicken in the bruschetta pasta felt like it came straight out microwave and it was very dry. The waitress was nice, we wouldn't blame her for the crappy food, but service was horrible in general; very slow.

It is lightly sautéed with mushrooms and onions. Try it, you'll like it. If you haven't been to TGIFridays in a while (like me), you should give them another try.

Drizzled with balsamic glaze and sprinkled with Parmesan shavings.   Surprisingly, the chicken was not dry at all.  The pasta actually tasted pretty good.  I thought it could use a little more sauce but it had enough garlic and hit of balsamic to give it the flavor.   My fiance got the Sizzling Chicken & Shrimp - Sauteed garlic-marinated chicken breast and delicious shrimp tossed in a Bruschetta marinara.  Served with onions, peppers, and creamy mash potatoes on a sizzling platter of melted American and Mexican cheeses.    This had pretty bold flavor but was a bit greasy and salty.   Our bill with 2 entrees and 2 drinks only came to around $23 before tips.  Really not bad.  For casual dinning, I think TGIF will suffice.  I think I will keep the coupon flyer instead of tossing it in the trash next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=100

I feel so bad bothering waiters/waitresses who walk around me to get the bartenders attention for me (because I know it's not their fault). Finally after waiting 20 minutes, she decides it's convenient for her to see what I want. This has happened every time (many times) I order/pick up take out. Definitely not impressed by the bartenders responsible for take-out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=100
Jackie R.,"Yorba Linda, CA",0,37,,1.0,4/23/2016,"We were loyal customers since 2001, not going back again after last night. We noticed a steady decline in service over the last few months. The waiters took longer and longer to come to the table and take an order, let alone bring our drinks, meal, or even a refill of soda. Last night, we sat at our table for at least 20 minutes, waiting to place our order, even though the restaurant wasn't busy at all at 6pm. We finally gave up and walked out. Nobody even noticed! Again, it wasn't a matter of the place being too busy or understaffed, we had several servers walking past our table, not acknowledging our presence. Never had this problem at the Brea location, where we will be going to from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=100
Melody H.,"Yorba Linda, CA",11,96,216,2.0,4/6/2015,"Service was okay I guess, everyone looked like zombies and had no real emotion in their faces. I was really craving pasta and unfortunately they only had 2 types to choose from. I got the bruschetta chicken pasta, it was a small portion and had no flavor, also the chicken was over cooked. My friend tried it and said the same thing. I could have made the same dish at home but better. I was disappointed to see that the shitty pasta cost me $15. Also our server never refilled our waters and barely checked on us, we came during lunch time so it wasn't even busy. If I do decide to come back I might just stick with their appetizers, don't bother getting an entree, I've tried other items before too and none of them are worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=100
Bruce A.,"Yorba Linda, CA",45,79,485,3.0,3/15/2014,"We went to TGIF tonight because the usually have pretty good food, we normally do the happy hour specials, but tonight we sat in the restaurant side. We started off we drinks, I ordered a coke, my wife had a strawberry lemonade, and our guest had a regular ice tea, then we ordered an appetizer, The Nachos Grande , not impressed at all it was really kinda small and it didn't have a wholelatta chesse on it no beans a few peice's of chicken ( nothing Grande about it) and it was over priced $10.89. For dinner my wife and I split the 8oz Flat Iron Steak, a different waitress brought the order out I had to ask for an extra plate so we got that. Then our guest ordered the the Cajun Shrimp chicken pasta he finished it all so he must have liked it .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=100

Mark A.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,13,7,2.0,10/27/2013,"0.5 - Food Quality & 5.0 - Service = 2 STARS!  Only two reasons to come to this location, the Katy Perry looking server & the Middle Eastern / Indian looking girl, both excellent servers and good with kids.  Other than that something is seriously wrong with this location, especially the kitchen!! When you order French Onion Soup on 5 consecutive visits and it comes out different everytime!  Servers are attentive and friendly, managers are lazy and unattentive (I have owned restaurants, so I can spot the issues immediately). On my last two visits I ordered steak and burgers which came out wrong both times, absolutely no quality control!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=180

H Q.,"Placentia, CA",153,715,1751,3.0,7/5/2010,"Why all the really low ratings? I've eaten here many times, I get what I expect and never had any difficulties. Many times the party I was with was probably more of a nuisance than other patrons and still there never was a problem. Like today. I came to meet some old friends and they wanted to do lunch at 11am. 11am?!? That's breakfast for me! We ended up staying and chatting until 3pm! Glad it wasn't busy or our poor waitress would have lost out on an additional one or two more tips.  I usually order the Fish and Chips or Jack Daniels ribs.Today, since it was so early for me to eat, I tried something different and had the French Ham -something- sandwich with a side salad. I have nothing bad to say about it. It was very flavorful and had a decent amount of meat in it. Plus it was about 1/3 of the calories of the very tempting Pulled Pork sandwich (they indicate calories now next to all their entrees). As someone previously mentioned, the booths are a little odd. I don't know why the table is almost at mid-chest level. Feels weird eating with your elbows sticking out so far.  Yes, I'd come back here again as I have on many occassions. I felt a little bad that we were there so long. I should have thrown down a couple of extra bucks for a tip. Oh well, I'll make it up to someone else down the line.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=180
Timmy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,23,,2.0,10/15/2013,"Date of visit: 10/13/2013 Not that Friday's is fine dining... let's face it if you're there on a Sunday night at 10pm it's because it's happy hour not because you're looking for service or food quality.  That being said, with low expectations Friday's fell WAY short on this visit.  Issue #1- ""the computers are down so you can't order anything"" Soooo how come the 3 people that just walked in are able to sit down and get drinks and we are not? Either everyone can't get served or they can? Can we see your manager? Manager never came computers were up about 30 min later. While sure problems happen, the behavior and how they dealt with it was extremely poor.  Issue #2- They were out of EVERYTHING! It was absolutely ridiculous. No drums (wings) and the flaps look liked all the chickens rode the short bus.. they were hardly what you would expect....., no Bud light the most popular beer in America? No spinach dip, no rye bread so you can order a sandwich... I'm sorry did you have a private party for 1000 people yesterday or do your managers just not know how to order anything? Issue #3- Service. Sure there are problems, things happen, but if I didn't have bud light and my computers went down for 30 minutes and there were only 6 tables in the whole building I would stop by every table and at least say I'm sorry. And If I'm the server I will be available every second that my table needs me, especially seeing how there are less than 20 people in the building. Friday's failed on both.

Oh and I only had one coke because he never came back to refill our drinks.

Our order was taken when the drinks were dropped at our table. Our food arrived within about 10-15 minutes after that. I have never had faster service at TGIfridays than we did tonight.

UNBELIEVABLE...the place has gotten even worse!!! The food was edible, but not really good (bland). The wait we endured to get it was ridiculous (seriously, almost 40 minutes for fried green beans and a 1/2 plate of skins). The service is ABSOLUTELY IMPLORABLE! I arrived to find 4 patrons at the bar, two small bar tables taken, and the restaurant side less than 1/4 full - this was NOT a busy place. I waited almost 10 minutes sitting at a bar high-top while the bartender and one other server walked by me 2 times each without acknowledging me before one took my drink order. My buddies showed up about 10 minutes later and WAITED JUST AS LONG FOR DRINK ORDERS TO BE TAKEN! All 3 beers EMPTY for over 5 minutes before the server came by to ask if we wanted another round. If you decide to go here anyway, fill out an application to work as a waiter - by the time you have drinks and eat you will be an expert at waiting. Never, ever again at this Fridays.

Maybe when I was 25 or 30 that might have felt good but when you're 53 (and look 51-1/2) it is irritating as hell. Her answer was ""she signed a paper and had to check everybody"".  Come on people, what ever happened to a little dose of common sense???  When the ""manager"" (must be self-annointed as she surely can't manage a damn thing) came over she plays stupid and says its the server's decision.  Not willing to do business with such stupid people we left and even though there's not alot of places to eat in YL we will never be back to this place!!!  Join me in protesting stupidity and eat elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tgi-fridays-yorba-linda?start=180
