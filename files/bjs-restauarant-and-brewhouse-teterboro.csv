Sharon D.,Franklin  NJ,10,79,89,11/18/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Excellent place to eat at . Today was our first time eating here and we were highly impressed. The food was phenomenal . I got shrimp taco with a quinoa rice with beans and corn . Absolutely delicious. Our waiter was a great person who was professional   respectful  polite courteous and all around perfect waiter . Service was prompt and timely. My husband loved the beers . This place was certainly worth the 1hr and a half drive down . We came from high point nj down to Teterboro and we gladly will do it again . I highly recommend this place .
Conrad B.,Wayne  NJ,8,249,1,11/13/2017,4.0,We've been a couple of times and enjoyed them both. The food was good as was the service... fast and friendly.Lots of great craft beers made in house. (Try the Jeremiah Red!) Good sized menu to choose lots of 'stuff' from... from burgers to shrimp tacos  seared Ahi  gluten free pizza and everything in between. So far like everything we've tried as did the people we were with. No complaints at all. Oh! Do you hate Brussel Sprouts? You won't after having them as an appetizer here. Lightly fried with honey and a sweet sriracha crema... Nobody doesn't like these 'bad boys.' A bit noisy for my taste but then my hearing is all 'out of whack'. But it is a sports bar with lots of 50 inch TVs everywhere  so it's going to get a bit loud. Great place to stop in after a hard day of shopping at Walmart and Costco.
Silas W.,Newark  NJ,0,8,,11/11/2017,2.0,2 stars simply for the food. The food here is great but the service is not. From the portly floor manager and the snooty server tiffany the service is at best poor. I prefer to have my server listen to my order when taking it when I go out. That did not happen. I used to bartend and wait tables and good service is the easiest part of the job. I also understood that if I made a mistake or the customer was upset its too easy to apologize and try to fix it. So in summary  Tiffany ensured the visit to BJ's was underwhelming. The manager on the floor who was reluctant to try and fix the issue and really didn't care shows that its a systemic problem here from the top trickling down to some of the staff. Luckily or server was switched to Mike who was super attentive. Despite Mike  the food  and Mike's effort to salvage the experience I'll never come back here again.
Alex Y.,Fort Lee  NJ,547,426,1958,11/6/2017,3.0,Have been here a few times now  and it's a nice place to catch the games. Convenient location right around Costco and Walmart  so you can flawlessly fit it in between your errands.The restaurant has plenty of space with both regular tables and booths available  all with line of sight to at least 2~3 TVs. Beer list is also extensive  though I feel that pricing may be slightly higher than some of the other local bars/restaurants.In terms of food  the menu is not for the indecisive. The menu itself probably weighs close to 5 lbs or a little over. Tried the spinach dip  it just didn't work for me. The burger was also just so so. Felt extremely greasy and the beef didn't really have much flavor. The California chicken club and clam chowder were both pretty decent. Didn't get a chance to try to deep dish or pizookie. Perhaps next time...
Thomas A.,Lyndhurst  NJ,121,299,71,10/2/2017,4.0,Like the other better-than-fast-food chains littering the sides of highways and strip malls throughout this great country - BJ's has a rather large menu that has pretty much everything you can imagine. We've liked everything we've tried the few times we've been here and can tell you some of their stuff (like their shrimp tacos) is better than than their competitors (take that  Chevy's!).But let's get to what matters: the amount of beers they offer (including a nice chunk they make themselves) are most excellent (get their 'taster' flight!) and I almost never bother with desserts but when you see something called a 'pazookie' you can't help but find room for one more course.Churros - hot  sugary  oilyIce cream - cold  creamy  silkyHow did it take mankind so long to realize they need to be together at the same time?!More expensive than other chains but the portions are more than generous (we ate lunch and skipped dinner later that night). But be warned: that churros pazookie is for a limited time I'm being told. (Shame on you BJ's!)Any fans of the show 'My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend' out there? You might get a kick out of seeing West Covina on the beer menu board as one of BJ's brewery locations. (I thought it was a made-up town for the show.)
Alexa T.,Bloomfield  NJ,226,9,23,11/9/2017,5.0,I've tried out BJ's twice with some friends and so far I've loved it every time. The first time I got one of their shrimp tacos (forgot the actual name but it it had arugula and came with a side of quinoa) and it tasted AMAZING. Perfect blend of flavors for sure! The second time I got the Southern Comfort sandwich with fried chicken  ham  bacon  and alfredo sauce - again really yummy food. my other friends got dishes with salmon and greens  and some sort of chicken steak sandwich. One person wasn't a fan of their chicken steak sandwich and expected a different taste I guess. But over all we loved the vibe and the different choices on the menu.For dessert  they have their special - the Pizookie. TRY THEM. Our table tried the classic  the churro  cookies and cream  and the monkey bread. They were SO good. Perfect if you're having that sweet tooth! On Tuesdays  all Pizookies are $3  when they're normally like $7-8. Without a doubt  coming in again!
Ana Lee M.,New Milford  NJ,516,97,118,10/14/2017,4.0,"LOVE this spot! My boyfriend and I wanted to try something new  so he took me to BJ\'s. The restaurant is in the plaza of Teterboro next to Texas Roadhouse. The interior was pleasing; seating area and a bar. Since our wait was twenty minutes we went to bar to order some drinks. I ordered the gin and tonic  and it was really good. Shout out to the bartenders! They didn\'t make my drink watered down or taste like straight up gin. When we sat down our waitress was really good to us. I wish I remembered her name because she was very nice to us and patient as well! We ordered their sriracha Brussels sprouts as an appetizer (so yummy)! And for entrees they had a deal if you order a prime rib you can get a soup/salad  two sides and a ""pizookie"" which is their famous dessert . I didn\'t like their Caesar salad but their broccoli with cheddar was very good. The prime rib was delicious too but we couldn\'t finish it since we got full from the appetizers  soups and salads! For the pizooki we ordered monkey bread and churro. The monkey bread was my favorite! Absolutely delicious! My experience here was 10/10 and the food was 8/10! Definitely coming back to try more on the menu!"
Hennie Rose D.,Bergenfield  NJ,369,165,232,10/31/2017,2.0,Eh. To be honest. It was totally overpriced for food similar to Applebee's. Not worth the extra money for okay food. I've definitely had better and probably wouldn't come back here for the food. I may consider it to taste the beers on tap. But for now  not impressed.
Caitlyn G.,Lodi  NJ,290,106,296,8/12/2017,3.0,I came here on my birthday a few days ago for dinner with my boyfriend. I've been meaning to come here ever since it opened in the busy Teterboro Landing plaza. There's plenty of parking available for customers. The inside of the restaurant was spacious with plenty of seating at the bar and rest of the dining area. They have a large board with all the beer selections which is pretty cool. The atmosphere was slightly above casual. I didn't really see a lot of families in here.They have a nice selection of items on the menu. They have certain specials each day for example on Mondays the tavern pizza and deep dish pizzas are half-priced! The food/beverages are moderately priced. I ordered the Roasted Maple Salmon Pita Tacos was about $13. The salmon on there was cooked beautifully. I loved the grilled pita bread - one of the best parts. There were hints of maple flavor which tasted great with the candied pecans. There's also a Greek yogurt cream dressing over the broccoli slaw with small slices of apples. I loved the apple slices which added a nice touch  but I didn't care much for the broccoli slaw. For me  it didn't mesh well. There was also a side of quinoa salad which was unnecessary for the entree. It didn't taste all that great.Along with my meal  I ordered a pina colada because I'm not really a beer person. I was hoping for the sweetness from the coconut flavor and hints of pineapple to come thru but it didn't. I tasted more alcohol than the actual pina colada flavor. It was a little disappointing especially paying $12 for it. I probably should've just ordered one of their other non-beer drinks such as whiskey sour which I usually love.The waiter we had was very nice. The waiters/waitresses take your order on a mobile tablet which is efficient! I would love to come back and try their pizzas which seems to be popular here (don't know why I didn't get that). I also want to try the pizookies here which seems like a great dessert with a variety of flavors. If you sign up for their rewards program  you do get a free pizookie.
Red L.,Brooklyn  Brooklyn  NY,0,5,5,11/16/2017,4.0,First experience here was good! I'm not a drinker so I cannot tell anything about beers here but for food.. they was good for my orders! I had rips (whole rack) and calamari shared with my bf. We enjoyed it!
Chad C.,Fair Lawn  NJ,131,233,292,10/5/2017,4.0,First visit to BJ's and not the last. The menu is insanely large. So many options to choose from. The atmosphere is awesome and the open floor plan works with this type of restaurant. We really enjoyed BJs and sent a handful of our friends to go and enjoy this establishment. I highly recommend BJs during football season.
Sean S.,Manhattan  NY,41,14,,11/25/2017,5.0,Sooo good we had the country club flat bread pizza and the meatball in mushroom sauce and mash potatoes we love this meal
Ashley R.,Edgewater  NJ,9,44,54,10/4/2017,5.0,I enjoy this place a lot  it is always open late especially on weekdays! They have a wonderful hefty selection of beer and the menu is huge with the most options you could imagine. I always choose different things when I come here  it really depends on my mood. I have ordered the half rack ribs  with broccoli and mashed potatoes on the side. I have also ordered numerous salads  sandwiches  the spinach dip is bomb! I sometimes even order a beer when I feel like. The vibe here is real cool  chill and young. The place is really one of a kind  in my opinion. I do have to say though  certain days and weekends it gets crazy packed due to football games and other events  like soccer or a fight. It's a young crowd but also I tend to see a bunch of families come in all the time! The place is gigantic and sort of sectioned off so you don't have to be close to the bar with your family. The food is an 8.5 out of 10! I have always chosen great meals here. There was one time it was busy and the food seemed a little rushed and sloppy  the manager remade it and didn't charge me. So I continue to come back  I appreciated the fact that they actually felt bad/sorry. They weren't rude and they didn't even think twice about doing it. Everyone of the employees are nice  sweet and actually care  I really do adore this place! Enjoy it!
Chalita P.,Cherry Hill  NJ,154,48,38,9/24/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Edit: 9/24 - came back for a second visit. Everything was going good up until when we ordered desserts. Apparently ordering to go boxes for leftovers meant they are throwing it away. I guess the lady cleaning tables can't understand English. Other than that I would say all the dishes with tomatoes we ordered (pasta and shrimp quinoa) except the pizza  was too sour. They really need to layoff with those ingredients. I always wanted to try BJ's. I'm pretty sure this is the only one in the state of New Jersey. The food was like any American chain restaurant. There's a lot of options so you're sure to find whatever you're in the mood for. But I can't leave without first trying their Pizookies. Went with the pizookie trio and had 3 smaller ones. They're sweet  really rich  really unhealthy  but really good.
Stephanie N.,North Bergen  NJ,88,60,16,8/26/2017,1.0,I was really excited to try this place. The decor was pretty cool. Our server was very pleasant and welcoming. My husband ordered the pita chicken tacos  which were very bland and had way too much cilantro. My son had the kids burger with french fries. The meal comes with two mini burgers but one of them looked liked a left over piece of beef jerky. Not appealing at all. We did order it with cheese but forgot it. I ordered a chicken tortilla soup with a chicken caesar salad. The soup was probably the ONLY good thing at our table. I asked for parmesan cheese and the shaker was disgusting. Some dried of sauce i believe. Nasty. The salad was basically another bowl of soup. It was way over dressed and the lettuce was just a wet pile of glop. Two bites in and i gagged. Seriously disappointed. The server was very apologetic and told us the manager would be over to talk to us but he or she never showed up at our table. 10 10 mins later the Server returned and said he would take my meal and my sons off the check. My husband used the restroom and said it was just as awful as their food. The floor was absolutely gross. One star goes to the soup and the server. If youre in this area  go next door to texas roadhouse.
Nihal B.,Lodi  NJ,14,6,,12/2/2017,4.0,Good environment  good quick bites fine beer! The service in the other side is excellent. Distant enough for privacy  attentive enlighten to get your needs in time! Price was it is average. My favorite is thin pizza!
Brendalynne F.,Lodi  NJ,519,185,1810,8/12/2017,4.0,"I had the Enlightened Roasted Maple Salmon Pita Tacos  my boyfriend had the California Chicken Club and Berry Burst Cider  and we shared the Churro Pizookie for dessert.I LOVED my pita tacos. The pita was very soft and perfectly chargrilled  the broccoli slaw and crunchy apples added a nice texture  and the salmon was cooked beautifully. The only thing I would change about the dish is the seasonal bistro grains on the side. It\'s essentially a quinoa salad  but I feel like it didn\'t complement the Greek-style tacos very well.My boyfriend thought his Cali chicken club was good  especially the garlic sourdough bread. But he didn\'t like the fries on the side. He said they tasted similar to diner fries - too crunchy on the outside and hollow in the middle. We both enjoyed the Berry Burst Cider though! Great fruit beer.As for the Churro Pizookie  YUM. Just a suggestion though - if you like fresh and crunchy churros  ask for the vanilla ice cream on the side. By the time my boyfriend and I got to the churros under the ice cream  they were super soggy.Like Harry P. here on Yelp said  BJ\'s is ""basically a nicer Applebee\'s"". But that\'s not to say I don\'t like BJ\'s or Applebee\'s! I really enjoyed my meal here  and our waitress Perla was great.*PICTURES TO FOLLOW*"
Alex M.,Carlstadt  NJ,166,43,25,8/2/2017,4.0,For a chain  BJ's has some really good beers on tap and the food is pretty good. Their wings are excellent  as is their appetizer pizzas. The wait time  even when using the app to put yourself on the list  is incredibly long. You get the same great service going and eating at the bar or in the bar's lounge area as you would if you were seated in the regular restaurant - and you bypass the wait.Tip for making reservations via their app: If the app can't tell you the wait time  that means the wait time is going to be LONG!
Harry P.,Mahwah  NJ,213,521,635,7/17/2017,3.0,Nothing special  basically a nicer apple-bees. I got a chicken bacon ranch piadina  nothing special  and it was pretty small. I like that they have some local beer on tap  but they do have a good beer selection overall  including their own beer that is contract brewed  but is decent  especially at lunch when they are only 3.99 for a beer. Not a bad lunch spot  nothing overwhelming.
Cindy F.,Ridgefield  NJ,160,257,378,4/9/2017,4.0,Finally got a chance to give this place a try. I stopped by on my way home from the doctor for lunch. I arrived at around 11:15 am and my mother and I were the only patrons. We both ordered there homemade sodas. My mom got the vanilla and I got the orange creamsicle. They were both very good I tasted hers. We ordered an appetizer order of calamari and I ordered a bacon cheeseburger for lunch. Both items were pretty good. This place seemed to have a great beer menu  which I didn't partake in as I'm 9 months pregnant and various bar food in general. It looks like a great place to come for happy hour and/or to watch a game.
Camille C.,Englewood  NJ,108,35,25,9/30/2017,1.0,"The food was good but the staff is near horrible. I kid you not  2 hostesses and a server were arguing with each other when I came in. The hostess in the very front had her back to me for quite some time before I could even get a greeting and put my name down for a party of 3.Then I was told the wait time would be 15-20 min. I thought  ""yeah right"". It\'s prime time for dinner crowd and all the tables are full. But restaurants always say that so whatever. (It was 41min until we got seated). It seemed like forever. My father got impatient and asked how many people are in front of us. She said 2. I lost count but I\'m pretty sure 4 parties or 3 got seated first. We finally got seated at a handicap table big enough for 6 people. But again  whatever  that\'s what was available at the time.Waiter comes to our table with a tablet for ordering. ""What\'s up guys welcome to BJ\'s""My father takes forever to order and asks a lot of questions and changes his mind...frustrating for the waiter I know. But the waiter shows his frustration and rushes through the order with his hand on his hip while he waits. Then he struggles with he tablet.Takes my order. I get a water. ""Would you like a lemon or no lemon?""""No lemon please""  I say. ""And for your entree?""""Can I have the bacon cheeseburger but no mayonnaise and no pickles?""""Okay bacon cheeseburger. How would you like it cooked?""""Well done  but no mayonnaise no pickles please""""Ok""""You got the no mayonnaise no pickles part?""""Yes""""What would you like with the burger?""""Oh I thought it was fried?""""There\'s sides on the page with meat"" turns pages quickly in my menu to the page with sides. (Nice to show me options but he was really impatient)""That\'s okay  I\'ll just have fries"".Food comes for my 8 year old sister. She gets a garlic knot and small fruit cup which was nice. Appetizer of fried calamari comes out. Looks amazing. Cooked to perfection and seasoned well. Waiter nearly slams small plates on the table in passing. Entrees come out. Before we even take a bite of anything the waiter comes and asks if everything is okay with the food. My dad just says yes and the waiter walks away. My sister got regular French fries instead of the happy face fries he took the time to explain and we chose. Again  whatever...My father food is correct. He got a soup in some kind of bread bowl or something. He liked it.I got my burger and fries and it looks AMAZING. I put the bun on top and it has a sauce on it...it\'s not mayonnaise but some kind of creamy sauce. There was no sauce on the description otherwise I would have told them to take it off. But I was annoyed because even wiping it off would still leave the taste on it. I take a tiny bit of the bread with sauce and it actually tastes good so I don\'t say anything. I put the burger together and take a bite. There\'s pickles...I was upset by now. I confirmed that he heard me say no pickles no mayonnaise but there is sauce (not mayonnaise so okay) and pickles. I just take the pickles out and put them aside. I don\'t dislike pickles  I just didn\'t want to have pickle breath all the way back home...I drink my water and there\'s a lemon in it...I feel like the waiter did this in purpose. How can the order be so incorrect???I didn\'t complain about any of it. Someone once teased me and asked why I\'m so polite to employees when I shop or eat. I never give staff a hard time unless it\'s really serious. But he clearly didn\'t wanna be there and had a terrible attitude. He was impatient even though ""wait"" is in the word ""waiter"". I know he was in a hurry and frustrated with how many menu questions we had but that should be common  especially since it was first time there. The only person who seemed nice was the girl at the end who bussed our table.I hope the staff I didn\'t encounter is more friendly then the ones I did. It\'s a shame since the food tastes so good. Maybe good food is all it needs though. It\'s in a busy location and was packed with customers."
Jennifer V.,Lyndhurst  NJ,208,150,147,1/7/2017,4.0,Finally came here a few weeks ago  I was waiting for it not to be super packed anymore although it still gets really busy on the weekends. For starters the menu is insanely huge...it's like a book. Bigger than the cheesecake factory's menu minus the advertisements. It was a bit overwhelming but everything was categorized so well and looked amazing. They have a nice selection of craft beers and also beers brewed by BJ'S themselves. My friend and both ordered Alabama Slammer for a cocktail. Well I loved it! I had two of them. I decided to go with pizza...i had the spicy pig tavern cut pizza. It was huge but I wanted it all to myself lol. I hate a little more than half and took the rest to go. It consisted of ham  smoked bacon  pineapples  and jalapeos. It was pretty spicy but worth it. Overall though the menu has everything from pizza to burgers to pastas and ribs  steaks  chicken etc. appetizer  small plates  soups ..and on on. I need to go back a bunch of times to try a little bit of everything. Our waitor that evening was very attentive and informative  so kudos! This place is definitely what Teterboro needed...there isn't any restaurants in the area and I'm so glad that BJ'S opened here. But fair warning it does get very packed on the weekends especially before 9 p.m. so do expect a wait but you won't be disappointed.
Jae L.,Dumont  NJ,159,177,117,10/10/2017,4.0,"Nice  big open space to jam pack with people. Tried to eat here a couple times and the wait was just way too long. Now that it\'s slowed down a bit  got to finally try a meal here. The food is actually really good here. Happy hour specials are decent and their craft beers are really good. Burgers are good and the pizza was a nice surprise. ""Deep dish"" style pizza is awesome with the soft  bready crust and a good ratio of sauce and cheese. Definitely have to try more of the pizza here.Location is a little difficult to maneuver thru sometimes with the walmart and costco being right there  but if you can get past that  you\'re golden."
Tito G.,Fairview  NJ,267,15,18,7/6/2017,5.0,Me and my wife decided to give BJ's a try despite some of the negative reviews and we are glad we did!! Excellent service by Tabitha  she was very nice  attentive and our food came quick and accurate! We tried the NEW Chicken Fried Steak Burger which was amazing  also had the Bone-In Wings with Root Beer Glaze  also amazing!! And finished off with desert  Pizookie Trio - Salted Caramel ( My favorite )   Churro and the Monkey Bread ( My wife's favorite. ) Overall we really enjoyed our experience. From the service  to the food  also need to mention it is a very clean and beautifully designed place with a great ambiance! Highly recommended!
Robin P.,Tenafly  NJ,18,60,24,9/30/2017,3.0,"Food was tasty. Service was not trained. Overall meh. Beer was Fab  but we had Head High and can get other places. More stars of better trained servers....please don\'t call me ""honey"" if you\'re in your 20s and I\'m in my 50s. It\'s BS"
Jill P.,Paramus  NJ,634,173,1142,12/10/2016,1.0,After looking forward to checking out this new spot  we were completely let down from their food. We left feeling sick and disgusted. Don't be misled like we were by their nice interior and pictures on the menu.Their boneless wings were either undercooked or so over processed  the meat was a weird translucent clear. After getting a second order because we thought they weren't cooked  I figured out its probably over processed chicken because it didn't even have a normal texture. The chicken club sandwich is covered and dripping in garlic butter  the chicken breast again questionable and included dark meat  and my bacon was deep fried. After 3 bites I was done  no question if the food was ok after the waitress saw I wasn't eating it. At this point I didn't want anything else anyway.The Alfredo chicken pasta was not as bad  but the chicken didn't look real. This went in the garbage too.If you want a Moscow mule  you have to buy the entire bottle of beer  but you only need half for the drink  then they charge you for the vodka. So if you only want one  its $12 and its not even good because they use concentrate lime juice. It's supposed to be fresh limes. Then your left with half a ginger beer and a bad drink.The cookie pizza wasn't bad  except it was completely raw in the middle. Like straight cookie batter as in liquid  not slightly cooked. If it was cooked  it would have been really good.Came home and felt completely awful. Even the next day  terrible. Will never go back here. The manager checked on other tables but skipped ours otherwise I would have said something. Complete waste of $60  wish I could get that back and not have wasted the calories. Beware!!
Sweta P.,Lyndhurst  NJ,5,12,,10/6/2017,5.0,Everytime we have been here the food and service has been spot on. Absolutely love their Avocado egg rolls. Plenty vegetarian options for vegetarians. Their home brewed beers are great too. Ambience isn't too loud but just perfect even for a big game night.
Michael E.,Setauket- East Setauket  NY,258,239,451,11/29/2016,3.0,"This is a new restaurant in a fairly new shopping center. We were in this area about a month ago and wanted to eat here but it was still being constructed so we settled for a nearby burger joint  but don\'t get me wrong the burger place was really good. ""Habit Burger"".So while in the area for a work project we saw that BJ Brew House was open for business. This is a chain restaurant where you\'re greeted at the hostess station and led to a table. First.. the restaurant name. Never mind.This is a large restaurant with a bar area  booths and tables. Based on the size of the restaurant it didn\'t seem too busy and there was plenty of help  but it took quite awhile before we were waited on. In fact I was getting ready to leave when our waitress Tabitha showed up.Just a note  they don\'t serve coke  only Pepsi. For me strike 1.I had the burger with bacon and brisket. Out of this world. I could eat that every day for lunch if I could. But the let down was the fries that came with it. Fries if you want to call them that. Mine were just pieces of fries  maybe 1/2 inch each. Big disappointment. Ketchup bottle was empty too.My business partner had a standard burger  what else  and said it was good but I noticed he didn\'t finish the burger or fries. Seemed like he was more interested in checking out Tabitha.Sorry but the best I can offer is three stars."
Mary N.,Verona  NJ,349,246,491,9/4/2017,5.0,The food here is really good and the service here is excellent as well. I had the sliders and someone else had a salad both were amazing. They have over 3 dozen beers to choose from as well. Definitely a good place to take people out for lunch or for dinner. I will definitely be going back in the near future. Also  the bathroom was extremely clean as well
Anthony B.,Lodi  NJ,30,134,2,11/12/2017,3.0,Just a chain restaurant with average food  but a superior drink program. Ordered the deep fried cheese burger thing  and while it seemed great on paper it was next to impossible to eat. The buger was soggy with oil  falling apart  and severely lacking flavor. Dessert is great though so that's a plus  and the craft beer menu is nice considering this is a chain restaurant. I'd come back again but be more careful with what I order.
Nick C.,Ridgefield Park  NJ,318,953,1643,11/27/2016,4.0,Went out with some friends to grab their pizzookie for dessert. Our waitress  Melissa  was very patient with us and knew her beer very well.Our four pizzookies came pretty quickly  and they were delicious. We weren't rushed either  and we were pretty weird  ordering appetizers after dessert. Their sriracha brussel sprouts are really good. The service was very good  considering how new this location is and since this is a chain restaurant  the service is probably the most important part of the experience.
Damian S.,Dumont  NJ,185,252,272,11/29/2016,3.0,Nice beer selection. They have roughly 10 house beers (amongst a sea of other beers on tap) and 4 house made sodas. I tried their IPA and Root Beer (non alcoholic). The IPA was pretty tasty  not the best I've ever had but certainly not bad (a nice drinkable not overly hoppy everbody kinda IPA). The Root Beer was really yummy! They offer growler fills here and I considered getting a growler of the (of all things) Root Beer (I know I was shocked too folks). To eat I ordered the Fried Jalapeo Burger. The fries were actually quite good. Seasoning is subjective and I thought the fries were close to being perfect but maybe a bit too salty. The burger  while under cooked to what I asked  was delicious. I used to order medium rare but there were many instances where I would get just rare burgers I switched to medium. In switching to medium I had hoped to get something closer to medium rare. What I've found  now  is most places cook up so I'm stuck with medium well burgers. There are two exceptions Zinburger (see my Clifton review) and  now  BJ's. There is a Chipotle Mayo sauce on it which was drizzled and I wish I could have tasted it better. The fried jalapeos were good but I wish they were a bit spicier. I left BJ's a fan. The three stars is rough as I think it should be closer to four but I'm weighing heavy on the fry seasoning (too salty) and (while in my favor) cooking temperature. I'm 97% sure if anyone (other than me) ordered the medium burger I recieved it would be sent back as under cooked (the burger I received was medium rare and I loved ever minute of it ).
Tiffany S.,Elizabeth  NJ,71,7,,10/15/2017,5.0,Ever since BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse opened in New Jersey I find myself going once a month  well honestly every other week. In regards to the service  no complaints. If there was ever a mix up with the orders the servers have been more than willing to help and change things. I've also been provided wonderful suggestions on multiple occasions. The wait time depends on the time of the day  nothing too exaggerated. Now when it comes to food  everything is great! I have yet to find a disappointing dish and there's great variety of vegetarian dishes. As of now the Barbacoa Cauliflower Tacos are my absolute favorite and for dessert any of the pizookis are a good choice. Being a big fan of beer I especially enjoy their Totonka Stout. As for the seasonal I suggest their Oktoberfest as well as their Pumpkin ale. For in house restaurant brews  they're great!
Christine G.,Englewood  NJ,496,396,604,10/30/2016,3.0,I came with low expectations since they are new and a chain but delightfully surprised. Some servers were clearly better than others but I'm sure with more training all the kinks will be ironed out.Walked in around 4pm on a Sat with no wait but as we were leaving a line was starting to form. I can see this place being swarmed with sports fans since TVs are everywhere both bar and restaurant side.The flight of beers is a good value for 4 5 oz pours at $7.95 and you get to try a variety of their beers. This was perfect for us first timers. Their beers were good. Light and tasty but some lacked that umph. I did like that they carried other beers from NJ on their draft list.Their avocado egg rolls and ahi poke were good and I would order them again but the deep dish pizza not so much. Wings with the sriarcha dry rub were yum and maybe next time I can ask for them to be a little more crispy. Pizzokies with ice cream were such an indulgence and on the sweeter side.They have a $10 off $35 coupon on their website until Nov so definitely try them out and use it. Will be back for HH and post-Costco runs!
Jade T.,Bergen County  NJ,216,127,378,10/23/2016,4.0,"Ahhhh so happy this place opened up! My boyfriend and I were shopping at Walmart when we noticed it. We decided to stop in for ""a"" beer because we had low expectations. We liked it so much we ended up stay for nearly two hours!They had a huge selection of beers on tap. Best of all  they have a bunch of their own custom brews. I loved them! My favorites were the Jeremiah Red  Brewhouse Blonde  and their Harvest beer (forget the full name). We had just eaten dinner before stopping in so didn\'t end up trying food  but definitely plan to next time. Luckily we managed to get a seat at the bar  but if we didn\'t  we probably would have left after one drink. There\'s a very small space between the bar and bar tables  which makes it practically impossible to stand comfortably while you wait for a seat to open up.My only complaint is that the floors are SO slippery..... I seriously almost killed myself walking around. My boyfriend said the same happened to him! I ended up bringing it up to the staff and they said that they have issues with the type of floors at all their locations. They need to take action on this asap because someone is going to seriously injure themselves. Either way  I definitely recommend BJ\'s for some drinks  especially their custom brews. Just walk cautiously ;)"
Clara R.,Garfield  NJ,0,1,,12/1/2017,1.0,Food literally tasted like ass. It was absolutely horrible greasy and just gross. Our waiter was fantastic thou
Kimberly S.,Middlesex  NJ,20,118,279,5/21/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Came here for the second time on Friday night around 7:00 there were 4 of us in the party again and there wasn't a wait for a table which I was surprised about. Again there was a problem with the timing of the service. Three of us were served our entrees and of course mine was the one missing. The server stopped by to see how the food was and saw I didn't receive mine  she apologized and went to check on it. I thought it was odd that mine was held up because I only ordered a pulled pork sandwich with fries seeing as though we also had a prime rib dinner and a baked pasta dish? Anyway someone then brought my sandwich but I really didn't care for it. The pork was really fatty and the roll wasn't soft. The coleslaw on the side was terrible the vegetables were chopped in rather big pieces and had very little dressing. The fries were the best part. I really regretted ordering it. Of course everyone else at the table was done eating well before me and the server came to clear plates and asked if I was done. I joked with her that I was sorry I was behind but I got a late start. Anyway... I loved my dessert last time I was here but this time not so much. Now again another problem with the timing of the food delivery. We ordered 2 desserts for the table. 1 mini and 1 full size Pizookie. So this time the full size came alone first which makes no sense to me. So I ordered the Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie since it looked so good in the pictures but after tasting it I thought it was way too sweet. It was just drowned in marshmallow fluff I could barely taste anything else. I only had a few bites and I was done with it. After this visit I really don't feel like I'll be rushing back here anytime soon.
Rachel L.,Tenafly  NJ,382,162,868,5/24/2017,3.0,Cool place for a casual night out. Two of us came in on a weekday night around 7:30 without a reservation. We waited about 10 min to be seated  which was not bad.The first thing I noticed upon entering the dining area is that this place is huge! There are TVs all around playing sport games. As it should be  considering that this place is new  this place is clean. I don't know how long that will last  but it's definitely a plus. We had steak andjambalaya  which had good flavors. The jambalaya was a little too salty  so if they can accommodate salt on the side instead.
Andrew L.,Fort Lee  NJ,42,103,132,11/13/2016,3.0,We came in for a weekend lunch about 3 weeks after they opened. The space was surprisingly small  considering the size of the building. Still  our party of 3 didn't have to wait to be seated.At first  I was amazed at the thickness of the menu. There seemed to be a lot of choices but unfortunately nothing pops out at you. Even though there's a lot of variety  there isn't anything extra creative about their food. And for what you get  the price is just a tad too high.Service was good and we were checked on a regular basis. Where we were seated  the booths were a little too close to the high seated tables so getting up to go to the bathroom (which is very nice) was a bit of a hassle.I ordered the baked ziti which was tasty but nothing to rave about. Across from me  my friend's clam chowder in the sourdough bread bowl looked alright. He said the soup was good but for what he was paying  it wasn't enough. I decided to finish with their signature pizookie  their take on the Uno's deep dish cookie sundae (which Applebee's has a variation of now as well). The cookie was too chewy on the bottom and edges  and was also a little dry. That made it feel like there wasn't enough ice cream. The server said it was my fault that I didn't like it. I might give it one more try next time.
Christian L.,Ridgefield  NJ,84,90,151,9/4/2017,4.0,This is a great spot to watch a game and the planes at Teterboro airport. They have a great variety of different beers on tap. The burger I ordered for lunch was very good. Mg wife enjoyed a flavored soda and she said it was very good. I'm sure I'll definitely be back in the future. I seriously can't wait to try more of their many menu items.
Desiree H.,Teaneck  NJ,2,11,2,11/12/2017,5.0,There beer glazed ribs are so good it crazy   all there food is good there and omg the poozokie it's wonderful
Jefferson C.,Hasbrouck Heights  NJ,0,3,,9/24/2017,5.0,First time here and the experience was great .The environment was amazing and what a food that they have here . Great place to have a good time and food and if you live around the area or visiting and don't know where to go I honestly recommend you BJ'S..
Annie S.,Lodi  NJ,4,35,25,6/3/2017,4.0,We got here around 5pm  so we beat the crowd and didn't have to wait for a table. We ordered the kids' meals first {chicken tenders  fries  and spaghetti}. The tenders were good  fries were warm  and I didn't get to try the spaghetti  but my daughter ate it all so I take that as a sign that it was good.I ordered the california chicken club sandwich with garlic aioli on the side and hubby ordered the pulled pork. I also substituted the swiss for provolone since I'm not a swiss cheese fan. My sandwich was delish. Took a bite of hubby's sandwich and thought it was good too. He like it  but said it wasn't to the point where he'd recommend someone come here for that. Our fries also came out warm  but thankfully I had requested fresh fries for my daughter so I swapped mine for hers.For dessert  I found a free pizookie offer on yelp for downloading the app so I got the chocolate chip. Sooo good  but I'm a dessert person so I could be biased We had a good experience aside from the fries being warm and our server forgetting about us towards the end. I'd come back though since they have a very extensive menu that hubby and I want to try.
Kyle H.,Saddle Brook  NJ,366,228,34,4/12/2017,4.0,"Newly opened  i was very impressed with the service as well as the atmosphere. Food/Drinks:I LOVE the fact the company brews their own beers and has all your basics. I have had their IPA  Hefeweizen  and Blonde  all of which were delicious. They have many taps though so they also offer up a great selection from other craft breweries. If you\'re into the hard stuff they have a full bar which they can offer up some fantastic cocktails.Food wise I\'ve had a few things including the burger and some sandwiches. The food is definitely good but not the best I\'ve ever had. Nothing to go home and rant and rave about but it will do the job for sure. Atmosphere:The atmosphere is undoubtedly cool  the bar area is partitioned from the dining area which i like but it is still one large open room. The bar is huge with plenty of TVs for sports and it has a great design that is really appealing. The dining area is very comfortable and i like the fact they can text you when they are ready to seat you. Everything seems very clean and orderly both in the dining area and behind the bar. Seems like a great place to go have a drink and catch the game or go with your family for dinner.Service:Service has been great every time i go. Surprisingly it is usually packed so expect a wait on a Friday or Saturday night. Wait times were short the one time i did have to wait and the staff was all very friendly. My favorite bar tender  Ilyas  is a great dude and ALWAYS takes care of me at the bar  he knows how to hustle for sure when its crowded which i can appreciate. Last time i was there he made an awesome suggestion for a beer cocktail mixing (2) of BJ\'s signature beers together and it was so good! You gotta love service like thatOverall this place is great  it will only get a 4 star rating for me because the food is very ""chain-like"" may i say but this place is cool and i will absolutely be back."
Kim A.,Somerville  MA,46,259,74,3/21/2017,4.0,I thought the food was pretty good  I'd go back. We shared a few apps and I had the pizza. The wait was pretty long  but was do able and we just hung out at the bar until our seat was ready.   My husband enjoyed several of the beers he tried and I enjoyed the root beer!!
Grisma B.,Wood-Ridge  NJ,66,18,13,6/17/2017,4.0,Good food and beer. The ginger beer was my favorite! So good - subtle ginger taste with a refreshing sweetness! Loved it. My husband had a flight and the berry beer was pretty good too!He had the jalapeo burger which he said was delicious. I had the vegetarian deep dish pizza. I felt like the pizza was slightly cold. It was okay  most likely I wouldn't get it again. We also split the small snack couscous Mac and cheese  that was delicious! I would definitely get that again. The restaurant was packed. My husband put us on the waiting list so we only had to wait 30 mins as opposed to the regular wait time of over an hour. The service felt slightly slow  but our waiter was very friendly. I think it was probably slow as the entire restaurant was packed. Will definitely go back for the ginger beer and Mac and cheese!
Tyler L.,Wanaque  NJ,185,1460,1280,1/29/2017,3.0,For a gastropub in the middle of a big parking lot for the shopping center  it's fairly good. The beer selection here is great with a good balance of a ton of styles from their own brewery and outside brews as well. The beer was good  but nothing stood out as fantastic. The Amber was probably the best while the Octoberfest and Lager were pretty mild and bland. The IPA was at least flavorful  but I didn't get as much citrus or floral flavor from it as others. The food is similarly just above average with good wings and ok flatbread pizza. The burgers looked good and were quite popular. Service was a bit of a mess with getting the bill with two increasingly cranky infants taking multiple tries and reminders. The space is huge and waits are short  so it's a good option for a break in a long shopping day.
Alicia S.,Clifton  NJ,5,4,4,5/29/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Another great dinner at BJ's! Tried the pork chop this time. Fantastic! So far  I haven't been disappointed. The food and the beer are great! Bartenders are knowledgable on what they're serving.  The servers are helpful and friendly.
Mary E.,Saddle Brook  NJ,278,139,149,12/22/2016,3.0,My family and I stopped in a few weeks ago  for a quick lunch. It was only their third week open  so they were pretty busy. There was six of us  so we had to wait for a few minutes  but  it was really only 10 minutes tops!The atmosphere is casual  lots of beer options  so if you're into beer/craft beer  this is definitely a place that you'd enjoy. Their menu consists of your typical bar food  salads  sandwiches  burgers  etc. They are known for their deep dish pizza  so we ordered one to give it a shot. It was good  I'm more of a thin crust specialtly pizza  but  I did enjoy their pizza. The service was as expected  being that they were only open for 3 weeks. Our waitress did make a few mistakes while taking our order  and our short lunch  did take longer than we had hoped  but  like I've mentioned  they were only open for 3 weeks. They were very aware of their mistakes  and made sure to apologize and make up for it. Like any other new business  they had some kinks to work out  but  they have lost of potential! Great location  tough parking situation though! Give them a shot  Enjoy!
Danny W.,Jersey City  NJ,66,59,39,7/10/2017,4.0,Not bad. I enjoyed the burger I had. You really go to this spot for the beers  which do not disappoint. So many choices you will definitely find something you like. The service was great and the decor was nice as well. Good for the whole family.
Steve B.,Stony Point  NY,41,153,29,9/17/2017,3.0,"The food was excellent and the choices were many. However the lack luster staff brings me down on my review. The waiter was too busy to notice we didnt get our drinks and then blamed ""her"" for not bringing them. Asked how my food was and didnt think to ask my wife how hers was. I would go for the food but not the atmosphere"
Mikey K.,Little Ferry  NJ,152,100,99,1/17/2017,4.0,Lots of beers on tap is always a plus.This place gets packed  so managed to only grab seats at the bar.Takes a bit to grab the bar tender's attention  only two for a long bar but they try to be fair.Had the pizza with the works  and also a side of spinach/artichoke dip. The dip was forgettable and the pizza was okay. They serve chicago style  deep dish. Food came out pretty fast which was nice.Menu is pretty big  will have to try to check out other items but if it gets packed house like this on the regular  will need to call ahead of time for a reservation.
Lorena S.,Rochelle Park  NJ,52,74,116,11/20/2016,4.0,Stopped in with a friend for some small bites and a drink. The staff was friendly and courteous and the food was out within 15 minutes. We ordered the fried artichoke  chips and guac and the California flatbread pizza ...it all hit the spot. My fave was the the flatbread...crust was crisp along with the bacon and cheese melted just right. I had one of their cocktails..which turned out to be dessert because it was a little too sweet for my taste. Overall it's a chain...the interior is trendy and the Tvs give it a more sports bar feel.I recommend for a spot to meet friends and grab a beer  or enjoy some family time. It can get a little loud  so I wouldn't recommend serious convos...just sayin.
Ms J.,New York  NY,4,123,3852,9/16/2017,5.0,Wow  so glad we came here for dinner!!! Our server  Mike H. was so attentive  friendly  patience and kind! Gave us amazing food recommendations. And all the food is made from scratch and it came out in such a quick timely manner!!! Thank you so much. We will definitely be back. Our family was very pleased with the outstanding food and service!
Tiffany Y.,Saddle Brook  NJ,115,164,303,10/31/2016,3.0,This place looks big on the outside but it wasn't as big as I thought it was going to be. I expected this to be two levels (not sure why..) but it was on main level with high ceilings. I came with some friends on a Sunday night to watch the football game and thought it was going to be packed. Luckily  the place was quiet (probably because it was raining) and we got seated in front of a TV...The decor of this place is nice...sort of like a high end bar. The bar is to the far left of the restaurant housing an array of beers and wines. To the middle and the right of the restaurant seats tables and booths with TV's all around which is definitely a plus for sports fans. The place is very clean and the staff was extremely friendly. I would watch yourself walking at the front of the restaurant. If your shoes are wet or if there's not real good traction on your shoes  you tend to fall or slip on the type of tile they have up front. I read a review prior to going and they said the same thing  so I definitely prepared myself since my shoes were wet from the rain. I could easily see how some people can slip on the tiles. The food options offer pages and pages of selection. I'm not too overly fond of the menu...it reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory where there's SO many choices that you get overwhelmed by the restaurant. Our waiter came over and explained the menu to us in the fastest way possible  confusing us even more. It was mentioned that only SOME appetizers were half off during football season and how some appetizers weren't. The beers were also explained the same. Seeing so many options from burgers to pizza to deep dish pizza to shrimp tacos to wings to steak to fish  I couldn't continue to look at the menu anymore without being overly indecisive. I opted for the gluten free pizza  whiles my friends got a deep dish  a bison burger  and a French dip sandwich. The food portions are large and definitely enough for leftovers to bring home. My gluten free pizza was delicious  but a little bit too oily. My friend ordered a mini sized deep dish pizza (they come in 4 different sizes) which consists of 4 small slices of pizza. Since the pizza she got was loaded with chicken and other stuff  she was overly stuffed with the mini sized. The bison burger was thin with thick buns  topped with onions and green chili (which you can ask to not get). The food was surprisingly good since I went in there with low expectations. The staff was also extremely friendly. Our waiter was super chill and made sure we got everything we needed. He apologized when he didn't bring us a second order of a mini deep dish and charged us for it. When the bill and we went over everything  we told him we never got the second deep dish pizza and he apologized a million times and got their manager involved to apologize as well. It wasn't a big deal for us since everyone was already so full  but it was an appreciated gesture that the manager acknowledge the mistake and apologized. Overall I think this place is reasonably priced with a great selection of alcohol. Truthfully  I'm turned off by the selection on the menu because there was so much going on. I also wasn't too happy about the tiles in front of the restaurant because it could cause problems if someone falls. I don't think this is a place I would go to ALL the time but I would come back again to try the rest of the menu.
Sara K.,Parsippany  NJ,208,8,97,10/23/2016,4.0,This was my first time at this restaurant all together  and I was pleased with everything. The wait was about 25-30 minutes on a Sunday night around 5:45. There were many people waiting and management made an awesome judgment call to have one of the servers go around to the people waiting with free samples of their pizza! Really good call whether it's a brand new spot or an ancient mom and pop shop.I had the Bloody Mary which was okay. It's a premise mix so nothing amazingly flavorful. Then  as an appetizer we decided to get a mini pizza instead of the standard apps. Since it's not a standard app  our entrees actually came out first without the pizza app coming out at all. Management came over and apologized but it wasn't a big deal. For a new quality place  that's a minor glitch. I had the jambalaya and it was delicious and had a good kick as it should. My boyfriend got the spaghetti and meatballs and that was pretty good also considering it's not a specialty Italian place. For dessert we did the trio pizookies. The cookies and cream and white chocolate macadamia were really good. Overall  loved it and definitely plan on coming back.
Katrina D.,Lodi  NJ,198,82,61,3/11/2017,3.0,This place is a hit or miss. Sometimes their food is good and sometimes it's just meh. However something that's always a hit with people is their pizza. I've got to give them that. Their pizookies are alright it's not as hyped as they make it out to be. I would stick with the burgers and ribs at this restaurant. I do have to give it to their staff they tend to hire very nice staff for the most part.
Kimberly M.,Dumont  NJ,38,47,420,4/3/2017,3.0,This place is pretty much alright. Though  not much of a brewhouse if you ask me. I guess I'd be more impressed with their beer selection if it were a smaller place  but for a restaurant chain the menu seemed pretty small. The food is good in a neither here nor there sort of way. For the most part lacking excitement. But what they do have to offer are their pizookies  all of which I intend to try. Service was basically attentive overall.
Louis A.,Saddle Brook  NJ,0,4,2,11/11/2017,5.0,Let me start by saying as soon as we walked in we were greeted by Dawn the hostess and she was very pleasant. After a slight wait on a Saturday night we were seated and met our waitress megan. She gave us the right attention we needed and gave us some suggestions which where great. Also they were busting their butts off which is hard to find being a business owner myself. Hats off to bj's brewhouse.
Stephanie M.,Saddle Brook  NJ,259,24,5,6/10/2017,3.0,I would like to give the benefit of the doubt to this establishment that they are adjusting through newly opening kinks. As crowded as it was I had a great experience at the bar. I couldn't decide between a few beers and the gentleman  Ilyas  gave me two samples to try. I ended up expanding the horizons and going with a new beer! There are lots to choose from that looked interesting so I really appreciated this kind of service from the bartender  even in a high volume time! Extremely friendly too. Super impressed with the service and selection at the bar.Dinner  after we had a couple drinks at the bar we were seated for dinner. While our waiter was a kind person  we were extremely delayed in receiving our food. He did not write our order down and had to return to the table to ask us several times. Hungry people  patience is difficult! While he was great about interacting with us  this was real poor process being implemented here in the service. The Nanuet location of BJ's had tremendously good appetizers and entrees. I chose the same items on the menu for appetizers  wings and stuffed mushrooms. Both were extremely disappointing in how tiny the food was. Only large mushrooms should make the cut. I was so excited for these tasty mushrooms I had in nanuet  and I was highly disappointed! The food was also cool.I am considering giving it another try in the future as the crowds potentially settle down. It is a great establishment with an awesome sports bar / family bar feel. Nice ambiance  super clean. Lots of tv's for sports. This place will be real great when it works through it's opening kinks.
Paulette M.,Hackensack  NJ,178,24,8,2/23/2017,4.0,I checked this place out on a Wednesday night. Boy were they busy! Our service was great. She was very attentive and went through the menu with as if we were lost puppies lol. I like their daily specials. We went on a night of $10 burgers  unlimited fries and $4 beers. However  I settled for the wedge salad and tomato bisque soup. The salad was ehhhh. The tomato bisque soup was bomb! I was surprised to know the soup was unlimited. Kudos to that!
R C.,Clifton  NJ,0,10,,8/26/2017,5.0,Delicious food at reasonable prices! Hats off to the Chef! Their Oasis tastes exactly like my fave San Adams Boston Lager! And the staff are very friendly and accommodating; especially since we brought our two little ones. Will definitely eat here often!
Holly C.,Lincoln Park  NJ,75,22,12,6/18/2017,5.0,Food was absolutely excellent!! Service was great! Huge menu  with a million choices for all kinds of eaters ! Lots of vegetarian options. They said 45 min wait   we were seated in 20 on a busy Friday night! Food all tasted fresh & it's a little pricier but you get your moneys worth. On a side note the beer is outstanding!!!
Ron G.,Clifton  NJ,1,2,,7/21/2017,4.0,This is my first visit to BJ's Brewhouse and I will definitely be back. Our server Christopher was attentive  fast and helpful. The California Chicken Club sandwich was excellent. My 10 year old son loved the Deep Dish Pizza and we both enjoyed the Pizookie Sampler.
Lindsey W.,Emerson  NJ,93,150,151,7/8/2017,4.0,I knew of this restaurant but never knew there was a location closer to my house. My boyfriend and I tried it out one night and I was impressed at their beer selection. HUGE beer menu and a pretty extensive cocktail list start off the meal. They offer great pizza  however most of their food is average. Burgers  steaks  sandwiches. I created my own burger. It came out quickly and it was good. I am just tired of looking at the same bar menu. I wish they had a different selection that maybe tasted as good as their beers.
Y S.,Manhattan  NY,0,48,28,5/15/2017,4.0,First time in this location. Wasn't expecting much  but was pleasantly surprised!Good wait staff  delicious drinks & tasty meal. We started off with the Frozen Margarita  White Peach Martini and Watermelon Mojito. All delish  but alcohol was lacking in all 3 drinks. Appetizers consisted of Spinach & Artichoke Dip (delicious!)  Ahi Poke (Eh...too heavily seasoned with soy sauce...not the best way to make it! We've tried various version of delicious Poke in Hawaii & LA). For our meal  we had the Prime Rib set (meat was cooked perfectly  but a bit too fatty)  Buffalo Burger (not as big as the picture) & the Peruvian Quinoa Bowl with Shrimp (not enough dressing  and it was just full of spinach and not enough quinoa and shrimp).All delicious  but it would have been nice if they spaced out the courses - a few minutes after the appetizers were brought to the table (which took longer than expected)  they brought out the main course. Every inch of the table was covered with dishes  and we felt a bit rushed.For dessert  we tried the Pizookie which was included with the Prime Rib set. Pizookie is a cookie baked in a pan with a scoop of ice cream on top. We tried the chocolate chocolate chip cookie with chocolate ice cream and the Oreo cookie with vanilla ice cream - both delicious!
Kay P.,Hoboken  NJ,0,17,,10/26/2017,5.0,Really enjoyed this place. It was new and clean. Service was perfect and very thorough with their iPads. They had a decent amount of vegetarian options for myself. All the food was great and the beer flights had a lot of options. I would definitely come back here!
Kim M.,Pompton Lakes  NJ,9,5,,8/6/2017,5.0,We came here because my fiancs name is Bj. It was a wonderful find and the food was great as well as the atmosphere.
Marnie B.,Elmwood Park  NJ,12,12,3,8/6/2017,5.0,So good! Omg this is our first time here and EVERYTHING was delicious! We did a bunch of apps and dessert. So good! Already can't wait to come back! Service is friendly...food beyond delicious. So happy we tried this place!
Bill C.,Franklin Lakes  NJ,9,2,,5/7/2017,1.0,"Stopped in for lunch had some kind of flavored ""prime rib"" sand and my son had a pulled pork that was so bad he didn\'t even finish it. Which really says it allFries where decent  Cool atmosphere for a drink or a beer. But food was terrivle"
Amruta K.,New York  NY,2,22,62,4/1/2017,5.0,This was my first visit to this restaurant and I must say that I am in love with this place. This is a brewhouse and their selection of drinks is amazing. I had a berry cider and my husband had a hefeweizen  both of them were so good. We visited this place on a Sunday evening and this place was pretty crowded. We waited about 20 minutes to get seated. We enjoyed the food as well. This is going to be our new hangout place.
Christopher D.,Lodi  NJ,376,342,2289,1/1/2017,3.0,I have been here 2 times since they opened up. This restaurant is good for lunch and dinner and is reasonably priced based on both of my trips here. Salads  sandwiches  and main courses with many choices for all kinds of appetites and diets and preferences. Their is a LARGE bar area as well (For all my drinkers out there) as dining room seating is provided. This is a good restaurant to go to when you want quality food and to watch the game with an array of beers and alcohols. Plenty of tv's as well to watch sports. The noise level was average but that was mainly because Giants game was on this particular evening. I would say it is kid friendly based on noise level and type of crowd. They also have a pretty solid kid menu. The negatives are service both times i have been here could have been better waiting forever to get your food and the waiter or waitress disappearing for long periods of time. Even though the friends i was with only had drinks all night and me the only entree thats not an excuse. our server in particular tonight had an attitude and made a couple of errors on orders. All that said I like the food and atmoshere and will avoid our server next time lol
Elisa S.,Staten Island  NY,30,17,15,8/7/2017,4.0,This chain restaurant is always a wonderful dining experience. The fact that this location is right across from Teterboro airport is even better! I got to sit at a booth at the front window and see planes taking off and landing while enjoying a delicious meal.
Billy C.,Clifton  NJ,2,13,17,4/26/2017,4.0,I came here with a small group (4 total) for some late evening food and drinks. The wait was only about ten minutes which went by quickly enough and we were seated by a bar-side table.Drinks:Beer: Their custom brews were very good  I had the Brown Ale and the Red.Mixed drinks: Nearly just juice ---Food:We started with the Queso with pork and Root-Beer Wings. The wings were super tasty however I wish they were not served room temp. In my opinion  the queso was pretty much just a chili. I'd have preferred it to be more discernible from a chili... or mark it as such on the menu.On to my main course  which was their signature ribs. The ribs were cooked well (mostly fall off the bone)  and the sauce was very good with a little spice (very mild).I'd like to give this place another try! It was a pretty positive experience.
Ed C.,Wharton  NJ,298,3,,2/3/2017,5.0,Went for lunch and had great service. Even the managers were hustling drinks and food to tables and making sure everyone was taken care of. They even honor NJCB! Food is great Drinks are great Definitely will return.
Janine K.,Lyndhurst  NJ,2,33,,8/12/2017,4.0,Ate here a few weeks ago with my husband. The entree salad I had was huge and fresh  delicious. It was the Derby-style chicken cobb...I took the rest home and had for dinner. My husband had a burger and fries and said was very good. We both liked the beer list and that you have a sample of it before you commit to a glass. Service was wonderful and nice clean atmosphere  plenty of TVs.
Marian F.,New York  NY,0,19,11,4/28/2017,3.0,Came here with a bunch of friends on a Saturday night. The place was packed! We went to the bar as we waited to be seated. Overall the experience was like a Houlihans. So many different appetizers and main courses to choose from. The pizookies are what made me want to come here though! I had the peanut butter cookie pizookie with a scoop of ghiradelli choc ice cream and a scoop of vanilla as well. Why choose? The drinks were delish. If you come here on a Fri or Sat night expect a long wait. I'm giving 3 stars because it wasn't out of this world  but there was nothing wrong either. I'd def come back.
Antonia R.,Bloomfield  NJ,3,118,3,2/16/2017,4.0,Idk what happened to my review but i def wrote one for this place !!! My husband and I came here a few weeks ago since we kept driving past it from when it just started getting built till now that it's done lol . So we said why not give it a shot ! Well I'm glad we did ! It's obviously a chain restaurant   but a good one . Way better than an Applebee's or a Chillies . I had some pasta and chicken dish which was delicious . He had a burger which was equally as good and we shared wings (also very good) . The cucumber & mint water = amazing I could have drank a pitcher of it . I also had a glass of prosecco . It came as a cute little bottle   basically two glasses out of one bottle = also amazing and tasted great . Love all the tvs definitely good when sports are on . Parking isn't an issue there's a huge lot and parking everywhere ! Last but not least or waitress was so sweet and great ! Ps only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because they r still working the kinks out . The place is new so the service is slower (it was also a busy football Sunday) and our entrees came out before our app but the waitress caught it right away before we even had to say anything and apologized ! Which was amazing service in my book ! We will be back !
Arjay S.,Manhattan  NY,314,15,2,6/18/2017,2.0,This is a good name chain; the Green Acres location is by far the worst. From the quality of food  presentation of food  as well as service...2 stars all around. If you have other options  pass!!! The buss boys are the best part of service. Good job guys!
Joe F.,Tenafly  NJ,53,179,27,11/30/2016,3.0,Beautiful environment  great TV and ample seating. Nice addition to the neighborhood. Tremendous beer selection. I came in for a quick bite and drink and left dubious off a very limited impression. Ordered a small Happy Hour deep dish pizza for one to check out highly touted Chicago style pizza. I personally like pizza well done and asked for it well so I was a little disappointed. Chunky pieces of tomato on top were good but was hoping to be blown away    hardly. Tried a Heferweizen beer and Hopstorm IPA. Decent but I was hoping to say I want to rush back here  I'll go back though and give it another try with other people.
Bharat P.,Elmwood Park  NJ,0,5,4,8/9/2017,3.0,Good food  but service slow.we order garlic bread but it was cold we have to send back for hot one.
Gary Z.,Tomkins Cove  NY,63,4,6,4/21/2017,5.0,Unbelievable food  outstanding serves with a smile  I ordered some apps to begin with  I decided to get the fried calamari  queso dip with chips  and mozzarella sticks. All the dishes were delicious and incredible  the texture of the calamari was so crispy and perfectly golden. The queso dip and chips was also incredible  but the best of the three apps was the mozzarella sticks. I decided to get the rip-eye medium well and it came out perfect  so juicy and perfectly cooked that I enjoyed each bit. I will definitely come back to enjoy the atmosphere and food.
Steve H.,Wood-Ridge  NJ,7,14,3,12/4/2016,2.0,We ate there when it first opened  food was surprisingly good  soups and wings espedially. Their draft craft beers were just ok but the are other local craft taps make up for any real craft beer fan's taste buds. I decided to try it again on Saturday  this time Take Out. Their website advertises curbside take out  I'm not sure exactly what that is supposed to mean  maybe one didnt get out of the car and the food is delivered to you in a preset parking space  but I went inside to pick up my order  having not see any signs or directions about this. We had ordered through their app. Seems there is a big push by BJs to download their app and get points to be redeemed later. The cashier seemed confused when we walked in  taking a lot of time trying to figure out the app and our order and may not have been working on the job long. She wanted to know was I redeeming points  which I had not even asked about or wanted. A manager stepped in and gave us some sort of an ice cream and cookie package  which we didn't order but accepted. The manager claimed it was because we downloaded their app and it was complimentary.It wasn't until we got to our destination did we realize everything wasn't ok. So check everything before you leave. I'm not sure what the problem is over there in Take Out but when one orders a French dip and you don't include the French dip  then it's just a roast beef sandwich. Stop worrying about handing out free stuff and work on your customer service and getting your orders correct. No French dip was the first disappointment  then to find out no napkins or utensils in a take out order  which included soup and their free ice cream really stood out to say they still don't have their act together in their Take Out area. Food was ok. I would put them on par with a Chili's with a better craft beer menu. But the Take Out service is unacceptable.BJ'S has been opened about a month now here  so they should have worked out the kinks.BJ's  please keep your free stuff  stop worrying about app points  especially if you can't get the basics straight.
Stephy G.,Palisades Park  NJ,5,59,33,1/14/2017,5.0,Amazing service - my order came out wrong and before it even landed on our table my waiter caught on and brought me exactly what I had ordered. The beers are great would def. recommend the Lightswitch Lager for anyone who loves their miller's and the Berry Burst Cider. The food was also delicious and the dessert was even better!First time here and will most definitely return.
Sara S.,Fair Lawn  NJ,83,69,30,12/22/2016,3.0,I've been here 3 times already for football Sunday. So my review is just in regards to football Sunday  I have no idea how it is the rest of the week. The first time we went for a Dolphins game and we made sure to arrive early. There aren't a lot of TV's (which is why I gave this place a 3 instead of 4 star!!) so we were a little worried we wouldn't get to see our game. The manager saw us walk in and approached us saying he wasn't sure which game he would put on but since we arrived early wearing our Dolphins gear he'd put us on alongside the Giants game!! Sweet!! When we scored our first score during the game  we tried to order shots. We were having trouble deciding what shot we wanted because they didn't have a lot of our usual go-to's. Then our bartender walked up and surprised us with special shots he'd made that were Dolphins teal!! So super awesome of him to think quickly on his feet like that and give us such great customer service!! I came back a few Sunday's later in the evening for a Giants-Cowboys game. It was pretty packed but I have to say our waitress never lost sight of us. She was very attentive the entire game  even though she had tons of big tables. I ordered the baked ziti that night and it was so freaking amazing. I wasn't sure if I should order pasta from a non Italian restaurant  for fear it would be bland or not done well. I am so glad I took the waitress's advice and ordered it!! I am still thinking about that ziti 2 weeks later!! It was soo good!! We came back this past Sunday and had a tough time with the fact that there were so little TV's. For a sports bar  you'd really expect the entire bar area to be covered in TVs so that you can actually watch all the football games on a Sunday. The past 2 times we came it didn't really affect us but this past week was kind of a bummer having to watch just 2 games. I think more tv's in that area would really up the appeal. The food is good though and luckily the Dolphins weren't playing on Sunday so we didn't miss anything!
Tommy D.,Rutherford  NJ,79,24,9,12/30/2016,4.0,My review is based on four different experiences. We came here four time since it opened and would give it 3.5 stars if that was an option. I called ahead and they put you on a list that can cut down your wait time significantly which is a plus. An hour and a half wait was cut to 20 minutes. The food was very good and we had excellent service every single time. The bar area needs some work. Bartenders made us wait a while while they BS with friends that were there. This was annoying but not the end of the world. Different appetizer each time was tasty. I would like to highlight the full rack of baby back ribs  had them twice and they were delicious. Thursday nights they have a rib special. Great selection of beers on tap and wines. The pizzookie dessert was great!We paid through the app which was a new and very easy experience. Fun place to have a few beers and watch the game. Considering this is a chain restaurant and this location is brand new  I was very impressed. Looking forward to coming here again!
Muriel G.,Teaneck  NJ,17,101,80,4/13/2017,2.0,I will not be back to this place. I tried it twice  the beers are whatever and the food is very salty cant do it.
Ramez M.,Newark  NJ,25,41,10,5/1/2017,5.0,Deep dish pizza is delicious. Very soft and light. Prepared beautifully. Beer heaven. Every beer u can imagine. Try the flight.  It's 4 5oz draft beers so u can try a variety.  Clean refreshing atmosphere. Kid friendly too. Gotta try it.
S A.,Secaucus  NJ,0,19,6,9/12/2017,3.0,Only come here when it's busy. I came during the day a second time and was really dissapointed. The food tasted preprepared. Fries were stale and burnt. The Thai noodle dish is horrible stay away. They have good Brussels sprouts and fresh salads. The thyme chicken is good. Overall I wouldn't do early lunch there again. I could just tell something was off. The most annoying thing about this place is sometimes your food esp fries come out not as hot and sending it back can be an annoyance. So I tend to overstate that I like my food served hot out the kitchen. You shouldn't have to say things like that when dining but hey guess they leave plates around and like to bring things out all at once. Waiters are friendly.
James B.,New York  NY,6,22,13,12/20/2016,2.0,Have been here 3 times and the brew is good  but the food all 3 times is served warm like it's sitting I'm the kitchen waiting to.be pickup   or maybe it's microwaved .I mentioned it to the manager seem like he absorbed my words but not too concerned .Too bad good brews but warm food .
Arnie S.,Maywood  NJ,5,110,9,11/9/2016,3.0,Very friendly service in this new bar/pub. For a large  crowded place  it was remarkably easy to hear my dinner companion. Great acoustics  lots of wall mounted tvs with sports and news. Started with the avocado eggrolls. Now  I'm not a fan of the fruit  but these were very good! Crispy  abundantly filled  and the spicy dipping sauce was awesome. I had the jambalaya. Loads of chicken  sausage  and shrimp  and I like spicy  but it was wayyy too spicy to finish..evident by the sweat pouring over my brow. The dessert was very good. A sort of salted caramel tart that was crisp on the edges  with a large serving of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream on top. The vodka tonic could've used a bit more Grey Goose  but overall a good experience. Ill be back.
Dom R.,Saddle Brook  NJ,29,77,135,5/21/2017,1.0,Today's lunch was better here than the ribs here tonight. If you want ribs go to either boom burger or Texas Roadhouse next door. The staff is alright however I've had better else where go to love how we told our server we wanted a to go bag TWICE. Hire servers that know where they are and chefs that know how to cook ribs. Almost didn't get my change back too lol I don't think our server knows we're she is tonight.
Suzaun S.,Manhattan  NY,55,25,37,3/30/2017,3.0,Food is pretty good. Would have given them 4 stars if the service was better. I've been to BJ's about 5 times and the 4 times I have been there the waitress's were horrendous. They were rude  forgot my order  brought our food late  and the best was she forgot to put in our order. This place really needs to get a whole new waitstaff. The grilled cheese and tomatoes soup is by far my favorite thing to get there and the salted caramel pizookie. Say no more!!
Alyssa A.,Bergenfield  NJ,4,25,,4/13/2017,1.0,Went here at about 9 PM on a weeknight. The floor under our table was dirty  the menus were sticky  and they didn't bring out part of our order until we were nearly done eating. The manager did the right thing and comped us for the delayed food  but I'll never be eating here again. First impressions mean a lot  and this one left a bad taste in my mouth.
Chris S.,Bloomfield  NJ,50,3,1,1/27/2017,5.0,Awesome new place I just found out about  very clean great service awesome food and one amazing bar definitely can be my new Cheers will definitely be back
Jolline V.,Brooklyn  NY,0,5,1,8/24/2017,4.0,The menu was a bit overwhelming but the waiter was friendly and patient. Food was delicious and fresh  not a long wait. Definitely will be coming back.
Krystin B.,Lodi  NJ,0,22,1,12/22/2016,4.0,A different place to try in the area. Awesome drinks and food. Downside= the host was not happy when we cam in and very mean  didnt even make eye contact. Our server Trish was amazing! Attentive  sweet  and efficient . The ribs are out of this world and the desserts are to die for! Will be back for more great service and food... hopefully they're host will be different and happier next time or maybe i wont come back.....
Kriz D.,Newark  NJ,5,6,5,4/8/2017,4.0,This place is great! Came here around Sunday afternoon with a friend of mine. Its fairly new and a popular place already! The service was quick and accommodating. Wide selection of beers/spirits/cocktails. I opted for a pink martini drink ofcourse! For appetizers we ordered the calamari app it was good could be better. Then I ordered a quinoa spinach and mushroom and salmon entree. Definitely going back just for that. It was delicious! But my friends burger was a bit on the dry side. Burger looked good for the picture though  haha. So glad they opened near by. Cheers!
Leese P.,Lodi  NJ,6,16,10,2/11/2017,4.0,Went for the first time last night. I had the on tap berry cider. Pretty good but not as good as their pear cider! Pear cider was crisp and refreshing. If you like cider  definitely try the pear! We shared spinach dip  nothing special. Tortilla chips were fresh and home made though. I had the grilled chicken  bacon  avocado sandwich with a substitute GF roll. It was excellent! Fresh chicken  crisp bacon  and ripe avocado! Fries were extra crispy. Boyfriend had shrimp tacos which was served on a grilled pita. Very light dinner served with a quinoa/rice side. Great food  service was attentive. It was packed but didn't wait more than 20 minutes to sit. Worth the minimal wait. Large variety of food and beer that were fresh. Must try!
Mr. Z.,Paramus  NJ,2,38,2,2/25/2017,5.0,Hands down the best place to eat in the area. Quality food. Lots of choices and quick service.
Benny T.,Clifton  NJ,250,40,20,3/26/2017,5.0,Came here twice with group of friends and I gotta say  I really liked the ambiance  the waiters where awesome and food was on point. I had their wings and the texture was crispy just how I liked them. Will be coming back to try other food options
Alicia M.,Saddle Brook  NJ,0,9,3,6/5/2017,5.0,Great beer  great food  great service! We got a cheese pizza and avocado eggrolls! Both were great. Definitely recommend!!!
Naphia S.,Garfield  NJ,0,13,13,5/31/2017,5.0,This was my first time here and everything from the food to the service was perfect!I had a large party of 24 people and they took my reservation  for a Friday night  even though they said it was 'tight'. My reservation was for 7:30pm and at 7:19pm I got a text that my table was ready. Seating wasn't tight at all  we weren't crammed in a corner somewhere and we all had plenty of arm space. Because there were so many of us  we got 2 servers and they were amazing  They were so patient with all of our questions and special requests  never once seemed overwhelmed or frustrated. We also asked if we could do separate checks & to my surprise they said yes  and allowed us to do 6 separate checks. Our party ordered an array of items  ranging from pizza  to fish tacos  to pizookies  and there were absolutely no complaints. I will definitely be returning here.
Edward E.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,1,,1/9/2017,1.0,Okay so I've been here plenty of times. Basically just to drink and bs. The most recent time I came here I was very disappointed and disgusted. I bought some cousins who came from Texas during the holiday season. We bought another family member who was underage and we clearly stated it to the waiter. Asking for shots for everyone except the driver. Everything was cool until the manager Maxwell. I repeat MAXWELL. (He told me to remember his name). Came to our table and told us any underage drinkers and we would go to jail with such an attitude. Remind you I told the waiter there was one underage person who was not drinking. Now I never been so furious but I remained calm and said you know what I never write reviews but I am going to write one about this experience. So thank you Maxwell. You don't deserve to be a manager. You do not even deserve to be a bus boy in this establishment.
Heather F.,Wood-Ridge  NJ,1,77,5,5/27/2017,3.0,They made this restaurant very nice on the inside. They have a ton of beer to choose from  lost of bad seating  high tops surrounding the bar  and regular dining tables. They have a large menu. I had wings and French fries. Not the best I've ever had  but not the worst. Our bartender was terrible. He seemed really overwhelmed  maybe he was new. It was a little frustrating because we had to keep asking for things multiple times before he would get it right. A decent local spot.
Ashley M.,Ridgewood  NJ,13,7,20,3/10/2017,3.0,"Went on a Saturday night and they were calling last call at 1145. They stated ""we are closing early"" which was strange. Great variety of beers and service was quick!"
Paul M.,Jersey City  NJ,373,9,,5/9/2017,5.0,First visited this place out in LA and was blown away and I must say that I was still impressed even with this location! Great selection of food all at such amazing prices. Portions are decently big and very very filling. Service was incredible on all ends of the floor! Great hangout spot  to eat and have a great time!
Timothy D.,Maywood  NJ,0,31,,5/5/2017,4.0,My service was quick and great. My Caesar salad was over dressed. The deep dish pizza on the other hand was fantastic. Deep dish pizza is not very popular in my area but it's something I really enjoy and this spot does it right. The dough is nice and light and buttery.
Bobbie JO B.,East Rutherford  NJ,54,12,5,1/25/2017,3.0,Stopped in last night. Had family in from out of town. Wanted to stop for a quick bite to eat and Check it out. As it's a new restaurant in the area. Typical Chain Restaurant. Menu is big and lots to choose from. Burgers  ribs  salads.. I tried one of their craft brews. Tasty. So my guest enjoyed their dishes Tacos  The spicy peanut chicken dish. I had the All Night Burger. And for an app the root beer ribs. Food was tasty. Wasn't blown away. Service was okay. It was an okay experience. Will I go back? Maybe if I'm shopping at Walmart and want an overpriced beer and greasy food.
Ignatius M.,Clifton  NJ,18,8,,3/25/2017,5.0,The hostess was wonderful! She was professional and efficient and her greeting was unlike any restaurant I've ever been to. Thank you!
Ifraj B.,Newark  NJ,1,8,4,3/5/2017,3.0,Love the atmosphere of the restaurant. I would've provided a 5 star rating but my fianc and I ordered steaks. Unfortunately they were not prepared as we requested.
Susan P.,Fort Lee  NJ,0,14,,8/15/2017,5.0,Happened in tonight on a half price bottle of wine night! They sat us in a booth. I was happy already. It was the best French dip we had ever had! It melted in our mouths. Yummy sweet potato fries  matched with a Murphy Goode cabernet sauvignon. We shared the monkey bread with vanilla ice cream for dessert. Yes  this is as good as it gets!
Liv S.,Denville  NJ,190,25,15,1/16/2017,5.0,The super salad is delicious. I ordered it with grilled chicken and it was grilled perfectly. Definitely coming back here.
Santo A.,Ridgefield Park  NJ,31,18,5,11/5/2016,1.0,"I have been to this place twice since it recently opened. Once for lunch and then about two weeks later for dinner. LUNCH:My wife and I met there for lunch two days after the grand opening. She ordered the Mediterranean chicken pita taco which lacked the main ingredient (chicken). When she asked the waitress jokingly ""where\'s the chicken""  her answer was all of the portions are pre-measured. Really??I ordered the Roast beef dip where the au-jus sauce tasted and smelled like motor oil. Not appetizing to say the least. Ok  I get it. Second day opened for business and they\'re still working out the kinks. The wait staff was very attentive but were insistent about pushing the beer and having us sign up and download the restaurant\'s app  which I now regret. (I\'ll explain in a few)DINNER:Two weeks later we were shopping in the area and decided to go there for dinner and to give this place another try  hoping they worked out most of their issues. My wife ordered the bacon guacamole cheese burger which was prepared perfectly to her liking. No complaints there. On the other hand I wasn\'t so lucky. I was trying to eat healthy so I ordered the Chicken Barbacoa dish which comes with brown rice and black beans. They brought out my dish which looked nothing like the picture on the menu. Barbacoa ?? I got a 3oz piece of grilled chicken (pre-measured portions) remember?  smothered In ice cold salsa right out of the refrigerator. Really disgusting. No effort what so ever put into making that dish. I showed my waitress and she agreed we and sent it back. I had to re-order something so I went with the chicken wing appetizer with no sauce or rub  just plain wings. I knew they couldn\'t mess that up. The waitress was awesome and took good care of us  knowing herself; that the food pretty much sucked. THE CHECK:Now It\'s time to try out the new BJ\'s app and pay the check through my iPhone  cool right? Having put all my information into the app previously  this should have been no problem. I decided to give my waitress a 25% tip who did an exceptional job. Once the check cleared through the app on my phone I noticed that I was overcharged by about $7. The manager then came to my table and regrettably explained that the bill already went thru electronically and there was nothing he could do except offer us a Pizookie (dessert cookie) the next time we visit. Just ask for him. WTF!! I asked why couldn\'t he just cancel the check out  but he said it already went thru. I then suggested he just go into the register and pull out $7 and give it to me. He couldn\'t do that either. It\'s not about the $7. I was generous enough to give the waitress a nice tip. It\'s the point that I don\'t believe the manager used all his resources to address this issue. He must have figured it\'s only $7  but he is truly mistaken. It\'s a lot more."
Dawn R.,Paterson  NJ,107,44,25,1/23/2017,4.0,My third or 4 th time here and tonight service was the best so far . It is very crowded and our server Ray has the whole bar section of tables by himself . Even though he is busy he still took his time with us and answered all of our questions and gave some great suggestions on drinks and food . He also recommended some beer samples which all were delicious and made my decision even harder . The appetizers are my favorite thing here. The fried artichokes   siracha Brussels sprouts and fried asparagus are so delicious every time   never fails. The pizzokies are amazing there's ALWAYS room for that desert. Excellent service and great food . A must try!
Wilkins B.,Hackensack  NJ,36,50,40,12/9/2016,5.0,Wow! Excellent service even when it was busy. Management is on point when asking for assistance with $10 AMC movie tickets on a busy night. Now for the food....I have to say this place is like Miller ale's  hulahans and Friday's put together. Their mozzarella sticks are better than Friday's with shredded Parmesan cheese on it. The steak and burgers are cooked as wished. The desserts are amazing and unique. Their fries are soft and yet crunchy on the outside as they are coated with some type of crunch. I'm in love with the cream sodas!!!! Their prices are a bit more fair. This place gets a perfect score because it stopped me from going to 3 different places. Ive been here a lot and sadly I did not take pictures because I was so into eating and enjoying (Forgive me). Next time  I will take some pictures. Staff  prices  food  drinks  desserts  environment  service and bathroom  yes  bathroom is a perfect score!
Abhishek G.,West New York  NJ,2,15,,12/13/2016,2.0,Bad service.and it starts right from the gate entrance.the wait staff gives you a wait time of 1.5 hours which immediately turns away guests to leave for other places in the vicinity.and mind you there are plenty.not a wise thing to do when you just opened.We actually saw a few people leave.Secondly the staff is untrained in the sense that they don't have a sense of seating arrangement and don't know the actual wait times and give out wrong information to customers.I saw people in groups of two or three sitting in a booth for 6.We actually got our table well before 1.5 hours.Coming to service i think they are very understaffed or undertrained.the waitress had to be reminded again and again for the drinks.she gave the reason that bar was backed up whereas it was Monday night 9:30 pm and it was half empty.She did not even put up the cutleries before the food showed up.we had to ask twice.she didn't ring in a few items.not even the mini birthday pizzokie my wife ordered for me.Totally sub par service.The food was just average.we ordered same pizza twice and it was different in taste.the waiter didn't knew how to handle the heavy cast iron pan.Pizzokie was the only thing good about this night.I had much better experience at their California locations.This location needs to up their ante to make a mark.May be I won't visit again even though I'm a big BJ's fan.
Kimberly C.,San Marino  CA,26,380,158,1/1/2017,3.0,Compared to other BJ's I've been to  this location is lacking in number of screens  although the TVs they do have are great. Being able to watch is greatly dependent on where you're sitting. The service here was fantastic  with the servers being very knowledgeable about the beers on tap. Food came out quickly and  of course  the pizookie was delicious.
Michael M.,Palisades Park  NJ,2,50,,1/24/2017,3.0,Hit or miss with this place. Food is usually great but once in a while it taste like crap  tho management will take care of it. Take out is always a drag even if I order 25 mins early It always takes 5-10 mins just to get my order.
Mohamed M.,Cedar Falls  IA,65,1,,11/27/2016,1.0,"This place looks good  but the service is unbelievably terrible. The server took half an hour till he brought us our drinks  another half an hour to take our orders and the food arrived after two hours after we\'re seated. My friend got his dessert before his entre  my other friend got his steak burnt from the outside  and my order as an appetizer took an hour (spinach dip) and the dessert took two hours to show up! The waiter literally said ""I am not sure what the hell is going on""... Guess who is not getting tip and a dozen of lost customers? Yep  this place!"
Alana G.,Bayonne  NJ,2,25,1,11/11/2016,4.0,Decided to check this place out after a recommendation by a friend. The staff was very warm and welcoming. When we were seated the hostess made light conversation and asked if it was our first time here and explained the menu  the beer  and told us to save room for dessert cause the pizookies are a must try (she wasn't kidding!!) Our waiter and his trainee were very nice and accommodating. My friend I ordered two tasters and tried almost every beer they had. The tasters are very generous 5oz pours. I highly recommend a taster it's a great portion and you get to try a bunch of beers. The food was all really good and fairly priced. The highlight of the meal was definitely the Pizookie. My friends and I split the peanut butter smores one which was to die for. I was very happy with my all around experience here  great food  good service  and good beer. I will be back!
Susie R.,Lodi  NJ,53,30,10,2/10/2017,3.0,Little pricey. Super packed all the time. Wasn't crazy about the food. Drinks are decent.
Irene K.,Edison  NJ,1,8,2,1/21/2017,1.0,Service is eh  food is decent  only thing great is the pizza. Vegetable sides (asparagus / broccoli) are super salty  also is the black and blue house burger. The hostess team are the WORST  we did the call a head seating  still waited longer than they stated. They clearly were seating parties who came after us. When we asked the hostess why we haven't been seated yet  she asked the other hostess and she said hold on I'm on my phone  clearly on snap chat. If I really had to give advise for someone  just do take out.
Ruch P.,Wood-Ridge  NJ,5,33,8,1/19/2017,5.0,We've been to BJs brew house a few times and have always had a good experience. The few items (spinach stuffed mushrooms  deep dish ziti  etc.) we've tried have been delicious.
Maria D.,Jersey City  NJ,1,1,,10/22/2016,1.0,Just dine in and was totally frustrated with my first visit. I ordered the parmesan chicken with white mashed potatoes and brocolli  very salty though i squeezed the lemon all over the chicken. The mashed potatoes seems like instant in a box and the brocolli  part raw. The strawberry lemonade is just like puree that i need to add water just to finish it. Then i asked for table napkins 3 times  first 2 service crew haven't come back and on third time  comes back with 2 small brown pieces of napkins that they use as coasters. The service crew asked how are we doing  and i said the food is salty  i dont even ate half on the plate  and she goes' oh  im sorry  do you need a container to go?'. The heck! I will not recommend this place. Paid too much with unsatisfying experience here.
Shelley R.,Paramus  NJ,1,9,5,11/12/2016,2.0,"Quite disappointed last night at BJ\'s. First off- a place that calls itself a ""brew house"" should have more than 12 seats at the bar! It was literally impossible to order a drink and if you are actually able to  there is no place to stand and hang out to enjoy it as the tables nearby back right up to the bar stools. We waited over an hour for a table- no place to sit at all while we waited -standing room only in the crowded entry area. Food was average quality but more pricey than we expected. The saving grace of the evening was our waitress but that was about it. Will probably give it one more chance in a month or so but most definitely not on a weekend or at peak hours."
Paul M.,Secaucus  NJ,57,2,,2/26/2017,5.0,Service was fantastic. Very attentive and friendly but not over the top. Ordered bone-in wings with root beer sauce. Delicious. For meals we had cauliflower tacos and a California club sandwich. Both were loaded with flavor and extremely filling. Somehow  we managed to order a mint pizookie. It didn't disappoint in the least. My girlfriend and I were fighting over the last bite. She won.
Gabriela R.,Fair Lawn  NJ,1,15,,12/22/2016,2.0,This place is spacious but the food is mediocre. Food on the menu sounds fancier than what is served. Might give it another try since it is relatively new.
Kimberly S.,West Orange  NJ,0,3,,2/19/2017,1.0,This was our first time there and will be the last.  We ordered the wing bone in with the pepper BBQ sauce. The sauce was great  but I think they are killing parakeets and finches to use for their wings  they were the smallest ones I have ever seen and for that cost they shouldn't be that small! We ordered burgers and they were so salty we could not even finish them. I guess they are hoping to make you thirsty to drink from their expensive beer lists. Service was also horrible  has to ask for refills and everything else. If your in the area go to Texas Roadhouse next door - better everything  you'll be very disappointed if you go to BJ's!!!
Anne B.,Ridgefield Park  NJ,9,7,,5/11/2017,1.0,Loved this place we ordered apps for lunch  They were all deliz. Our server was excellent. She was helpful& attentive. Will definitely go back
Louis C.,Ridgefield Park  NJ,4,4,,2/6/2017,4.0,This restaurant is great it's brand-new the food is good the service is great and the drinks that awesome been here three times already(:
Phil S.,Rutherford  NJ,80,3,,1/31/2017,5.0,Great quality food and atmosphere. An awesome place to grab a drink and hang out with friends or family. I would highly recommend trying their pizza or burgers. Both are prepared to perfection  tasty  and filling.
linda c.,Fort Lee  NJ,1,14,18,5/27/2017,4.0,We love this place. Great service. Nice ambiance. Table and bar service. Sports bar that's not on top of you great menu with calorie count.
Tony H.,Avenel  NJ,31,18,,12/23/2016,3.0,Enviorment setting is nice and big  good alcohol selection  however not impressed with my order of chicken soft tacos  I ordered extra chicken and portions were small. Waitresses were nice. Next time I will order a different meal and update rating if necessary.
Autumn S.,Middletown  NY,0,2,2,6/25/2017,4.0,Went the other day with a friend They thought we asked to share one plate when we asked for two separate meals so they took awhile to come out with the second so they didn't charge us! Will be going back!
Lloyd S.,Paramus  NJ,1,4,,11/6/2016,4.0,Service friendly and knowledgeable. Good eclectic meningitis with lots of healthy and interesting fare as well. Open air and lively atmosphere. Great for a family meal or date night.  Go a little early or there will be a wait.
Andrea C.,Hackensack  NJ,59,27,3,6/4/2017,5.0,Giving this place a five star because of our waiter Trish. She was absolutely beyond phenomenal. She really cared about us being content with our drink and food orders  she had recommendations and allowed us to sample some beers before ordering. We attended here for some drinks and apps. The wings were very very tasty and my beer was different  ordinary and refreshing. Prices are reasonable and overall experience was pleasant. Definitely recommend  however they do get very packed on weekends so expect wait times.
Alexx M.,Lyndhurst  NJ,159,6,2,2/15/2017,1.0,"I came here once for a family members birthday  and wanted to come back again because my first experience was wonderful. The menu catered to my dietary restrictions  the food was delicious  and our waiter made sure we were accommodated properly. My husband and I decided we wanted to come back a second time to celebrate our anniversary  and called at 11 am to make reservations @ 6 pm because that place is seriously busy on weekends/nights. We get there and I approach the hostess and right away I am greeted with attitude. I told her we had a reservation for 2 people at 6 pm under my name  and the hostess said we\'d have to wait 45 minutes. My husband asked her if we made a reservation  then why are we waiting for 45 minutes?? And she responded that  it was a ""call ahead""  meaning that it would cut our waiting time in HALF. How is that acceptable? I had called at 11 am  the time they open! The whole point of a reservation is to reserve a table for a specific time. I  myself  have worked in the restaurant business for a number of years and even on my busiest nights  I have never once gave a customer attitude  and I made a point to ensure their time with me and their experience at that restaurant was beyond adequate. Needless to say  we went to a Friday\'s nearby instead  and had one of the best experiences at a chain food restaurant ever. Sorry  but I don\'t think I will be coming back here anytime soon."
Patricia K.,Saddle Brook  NJ,1,5,14,10/30/2016,5.0,This place is amazing ! From the service to the beer selection to the food you couldn't ask for more. And not to mention you must save room for dessert because it's that good!! Even when it seems over whelming because there's so many options on the food and drink menu   you just let the server know what you normally drink and they give you samples Of their beer that are similar yet so much better! and when you know what your in the mood for food wise they basically help you narrow down the options. My boyfriend and I got the chicken pot stickers and calamari as an app   and then a mini pizza ( deep dish bjs favorite )   and ribs and ahi tuna salad as an entree and we loved everything. They also have a special going on for October for breast cancer awareness month   select drinks proceeds go to the the foundation   the manager maxwell checked on us and we let him know how delightful everything was. Our server Shannon did an awesome job and they've only been open a week and a half . 5 stars from us!
Johanna G.,Ridgefield Park  NJ,0,11,2,11/27/2016,5.0,Great service by James. Gave us samples of four different beers. The food was great  quick and delicious. also happy hour during football!!
Samantha P.,Saddle Brook  NJ,67,4,,11/26/2016,5.0,This restaurant just opened not too long ago in my area. Just stopped in today to check it out. I had a great experience! The service was great from our waitress down to the bus boys taking our empty plates. Everyone had a smile on their face and was very polite and willing to help. Even had another waitress refill our drinks. Very professional staff. The food was amazing. Everything was served hot and seemed very fresh. We ordered an appetizer it was spaced out well from our entrees. Decent sized servings also for a good price. Not over priced at all. I didn't have any of their alcoholic beverages but the selection from their own brews to mixed drinks gave you a full variety. Will definitely come back and recommend to others.
Olivia Z.,Dana Point  CA,0,21,36,10/21/2016,3.0,They were quite slow today. Not sure why considering there were so many people working. Getting drinks took about 15 minutes. Picking up the check  just as much time. The food was really good though and the beer was delicious. We had the flat breads and they were all delicious. The nacho flatbread was really good.
James S.,Teaneck  NJ,0,10,,10/31/2016,5.0,This place is on fire! Definitely coming back. First of all the environment is very hip and and cozy. You get this strange mixed sensation of feeling welcome and good time  I don't know what it was but it made me and my friend feel cool/good. I got these seafood tacos (grilled)  one mahi-mahi  one shrimp. Real tasty  especially the shrimp one. I got a basic mixed drink but my friend got a beer they had with pumpkin flavor and a cinnamon sugar rim. He loved it. The staff is friendly and attentive. We were taken care of by a smart sweet girl whose name I believe was Heather.Anyway  I liked it  it's a good place for business reunions  dates  family nights  friends get together  anything really. Kind of like a better version of applebees but they charge around the same maybe a bit more.
Dani M.,Wood-Ridge  NJ,44,1,,10/29/2016,4.0,Service was great  Ryan was on top of drinks and refills. The buffalo wings were good. The burger my husband had was ok. The brisket was cold and so was the bun. The fries are really bland. I had the shrimp and asparagus pasta. The pasta was undercooked and the shrimp and the asparagus tasted like freezer. It's a brewhouse  so I think people should probably stick to pub style food like wings and burgers. Overall it wasn't a terrible experience but since they're new I'll probably come back in a few months.
Kamilla M.,Haledon  NJ,0,8,,3/25/2017,5.0,The place has a long wait but the service is above and beyond. The kitchen felt they made an order incorrectly and sent out another order! The waitress Sarah was great and promptly removed plates as the night progressed. The food is served warm and timely. If you undecided you should defiantly chose this spot.
Megan H.,Avenel  NJ,0,10,4,4/8/2017,5.0,I just wanted to compliment your restaurant and how great the food and service is everytime! Even bus boys/girls and other waiters who weren't our waitress kept asking if we needed anything and refilling our water! We will keep coming back here consistently based on the level of service  this place is amazing!
Kristen J.,Lyndhurst  NJ,0,69,9,2/16/2017,5.0,Love the food at BJs brewhouse. I've had their shrimp taco  and there turkey burgers (which are nice and juicy). It makes me even more excited that they have gluten free pizza and buns for my burger. Everyone I've went with also had a great meal as well. I would give it four stars for the service being slow but the food and their personalities make up for it. Definitely give it a shot. Just try to avoid a Friday or Saturday night cause you can wait up to 2 hours for a table.
Sylvia V.,Maywood  NJ,4,23,,1/16/2017,4.0,My family and I came here for the first time. It is a very nice restaurant the staff is very well trained. Everything flowed smoothly and everyone work together as a team. I had the barbecue ribs and my husband had the seared tuna salad my son also had the ribs. The ribs were one of the best I've ever had in a long time they had a very good crust on the outside and we were tender and moist on the inside the meat was generous and it was seasoned very well that you really didn't need any barbecue sauce. The only thing I wasn't crazy about were the side dishes I selected. The roasted brussel sprouts we're very dry it seemed like they were sitting around for a while. And also I did not like the way they presented the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad it was over seasoned and overdressed with salad dressing. I was anticipating sliced fresh mozzarella and sliced tomatoes but all I got were little Marbles of mozzarella and cut up tomatoes. My husband enjoyed his tuna salad and the tortilla soup and my son also enjoyed the ribs and mashed potatoes were very good. Definitely must go for the beer nice selection. I would have given this place a 5-star if it wasn't for the lousy side dishes. And may I also add they gave you a very cheap amount of side dishes. But they have excellent staff and great service and because of that I will return.
Linda P.,Jersey City  NJ,1,34,,2/27/2017,3.0,I actually rate this place a 3.5. I have been to other locations in the US before. So I was sort of excited we were getting one. I have only gotten the pizza here anytime i went and it was pretty good. The waitress checked in with us and gave us suggestions. I had gotten the strawberry splash as a drink which was good. My friend got a burger for which she enjoyed. The pizooki's are yummy  we got the trio(cookies n creme  triple chocolate  and salted caramel). I liked the cookies and creme and triple chocolate but I can be a little biased since I love chocolate! This place is in a nice developing shopping center. This place is comparable to unos but i like this place slightly better.
Gretchen S.,Leonia  NJ,0,2,,3/29/2017,4.0,Food and service is good with a nice relaxed atmosphere. Large selection of micro brewed beers that are mostly too hoppy for me. The menu is creative. They did have a great and I mean great quinoa and grilled salmon dish with mushrooms roasted peppers and asparagus that was to die for about a month ago. They have since reduced the quinoa and added brown rice and left out the roasted peppers instead adding tomatoes which now makes the dish less tasty and interesting. Get rid of the rice and give me back more quinoa and roasted peppers. This won't keep me from going back but I won't order my previously favorite dish again.
H K.,Secaucus  NJ,0,13,,2/15/2017,3.0,The menu/ food is pretty good. Service was on the slow side. While the waiter was nice  he walked pass us four to five times and we even made eye contact a few times to get his attention  but there was no response. Also  for some reason the hostess had a bit of an attitude and poor mannerisms.
Dan A.,Wallington  NJ,0,13,1,3/8/2017,1.0,We where so exited of checking out this restaurant. The inside looked good and clean. We went with a group of 7. First of all 5 of us had dirty silverware which was not a great start. 2 of us order the Jambalaya and it was so overly spicy that it made the dish inedible. Another member order a steak with a baked potato. The steak was overcooked and they completely forgot the potato. We try to find the waiter to have our food remade but it was easier to find a needle in a haystack than the waiter. We just gave up paid our bill and left never to return.
Anthony B.,Nutley  NJ,81,40,17,2/1/2017,3.0,Wifes birthday party of 8... called at at 12PM to make 630PM reservation ... arrive they lose they reservation.. 15 min wait and was seated. Plenty of beer to pick from . Service was a little slow but was also very busy for a Wednesday night. I will have togo again to re edit my review. The food was OK... ribs were somewhat tasteless  fried calamari for appetizer was very salty and the marinara sauce tastes like ragu.
Melanie R.,Wayne  NJ,0,3,,7/1/2017,1.0,"If I could give no stars  I would. After driving by this restaurant multiple times my boyfriend and I were excited to finally try it the other night but instead we left disappointed. The majority of the workers there are young teens who are quick to give attitudes without any regard for true customer service. Beside my table sat a couple who after telling their waitress they were unhappy with their meal were yelled at and told she wouldn\'t take it off of the bill. After they requested to speak with a manager  another unpleasant server walked up to the table and responded with  ""well he isn\'t here now so what do you want to do?!"" (WOW I thought). Besides the quality of the staff being bad  the food was also distasteful. I had ordered a BBQ pulled pork sandwich that was sent out to my table finally after 40 minutes  which was undercooked! My boyfriend had ordered a deep dish ziti that was brought to us cold. Our waitress was nowhere to be found the majority of the time which left us to ask other waitresses for napkins and silverware that had never been given to us even after receiving our food. After witnessing the lack of customer service given to others and being given countless attitudes  all we wanted to do was pay our bill and get out! When our server finally reappeared she literally threw our check onto the table and continued to walk away as if that was normal and right. After everything I felt like I was in the twilight zone! Good luck to this business and to all of its workers! Never coming here again."
Michael E.,West Orange  NJ,1,29,10,11/12/2016,2.0,I usually wait until my experience with a restaurant is complete before reviewing it  but in this case  unfortunately  I have time to kill. It's been 45 minutes and I'm still waiting for the one thing I ordered  an appetizer  to be served. The waiter has never returned. The assistant manager who promised to correct everything also never returned or corrected anything. In my frustration  I started to leave and on my way out the door  the general manager asked what the problem was  and convinced me to sit down and try again. Now I'm waiting once more. I like BJ's  but this admittedly new location has a long  long way to go before being a place I'd recommend. Perhaps after they've had some time to iron out the kinks I'll come back and try again  but not for a while. There seems to be a tremendous amount of chaos and confusion among the staff  and this was at 3pm. I can't imagine what it would be like at the height of the lunch or dinner rush. In the spirit of full disclosure  the food did eventually come  and it was perfectly decent  and they didn't charge me for it  which I appreciated  but I'd rather pay full price than go through this hassle.
Dyann C.,Belleville  NJ,83,5,17,12/21/2016,1.0,So here is our review... first of all we were there 2 Hours and 21 minutes for 4 people to have dinner on Wednesday night. Way too long for me. It took them 20 minutes to come over and ask if we wanted something to drink. Took forever for all the food to come out. Took another 6 minutes for them to bring our check  we waited 15 minutes for them to come so we could pay the check at which point Jamie went to the manager and got about another $30 off from complaining. Now for the food... spinach stuffed mushrooms were the best thing I had there they were delicious I would definitely go back for them. Fried calamari was so salty it was disgusting and very chewy. We sent it back and got the avocado roll  two people out of the four liked it it was way too spicy for me couldn't even eat it. It did not look like the picture. Jamie and I got grilled shrimp over quinoa bowl with asparagus mushrooms peppers onions etc. I thought the quinoa and all the vegetables are good the grilled shrimp was not grilled it was pretty much just boiled. Jamie didn't like the dish at all. Judy got the jambalaya that she couldn't even eat because it was way too spicy Jamie tasted it said it was way too spicy I totally stayed away from that. The manager ended up taking this off the bill. Pete got New England clam chowder and he had no complaints about it he liked it. Onto dessert... We had the Pizookie's.. My favorite was the triple chocolate you know me I love chocolate so it was great. The snickerdoodle which is seasonal was everybody's favorite  nice with the cinnamon  least liked was the cookies and cream the cookie seems to be not totally cooked so it tasted like raw cookie dough. Overall I would not recommend this place. The reviews on yelp were three out of five stars. Our waiter was very nice but slow as shit! It's a new place it's a chain so we gave it a try!
Nicholas P.,Brooklyn  NY,100,1,,12/18/2016,1.0,Awful salty microwaved food. Waiters fucked up our orders 3 times. Might as well go to Applebee's shit is trash.
Em V.,Hackensack  NJ,0,3,1,11/28/2016,4.0,"It might\'ve been because it was mostly empty but our waiter was very attentive and friendly. We had margarita  beers  stuffed mushrooms  grilled cheese and deep dish baked ziti. It is somewhat on the pricier side for what you\'re getting  $15 for a smaller dish of ziti. Grilled cheese and ham was a tad salty but no real complaints. Hubs had the cookie/pie/ice cream thing that I was told was ""real good"". Tasty enough and the menu is extensive! Will be back for sure. Glad to have a place to go besides Paramus."
Juana R.,Bronx  NY,0,10,,6/26/2017,2.0,"A friend invited me to this restaurant over the weekend. I thought it was important to talk about my experience. The place was pretty. Very packed. The hostess at the front who took my name was kind and friendly. Because there was a long wait  we decided to sit by the bar. We were helped by gentlemen the whole night at the bar who acted like he hated his job and can care less to lose it. First of all  The first think we order is sparkling and he puts the glasses in front of us and the bottle and doesn\'t bother to open it. We waited and waited and then asked if he could open the bottle for us and he did with the comment "" I don\'t know why people expect us to open it. It\'s pretty simple"". I know how to open a bottle of champagne. But yet I\'ve never experience going to a restaurant that doesn\'t open it for you. We had to keep approaching him to order a drink or food. He didn\'t bother asking us what we wanted. If everything was good. If we needed something else. Even after the drink was empty and the plates were empty. He didn\'t bother once. He left all the empty plates and glasses pile up on the bar. He didn\'t bother taking it away. When we ordered a frozen margarita and all the other drinks  He didn\'t even put a straw. All the drinks he made that night for us and for other people kept spilling. It would overflow and wet everything. I wanted to record him so that management can see the money they lose with all the spilling but I didn\'t want to seem rude. The service provided by this gentlemen was horrible. And for the that I will not be going back. The fact that he think its okay to act the way he did is not okay with me."
Salvo L.,Saddle Brook  NJ,13,1,,12/28/2016,2.0,We stopped in on Tuesday night around 9:30 pm with a party of 10 and were told we had to wait 40 minutes for a table. We asked them if they could set a table for us in the adjacent room where several tables were empty and the manager told us he wouldnt have a waiter to cover it. When we told them we were going to leave because we couldn't wait that long  just liked that the manager worked his magic and was able to setup the table and find a waiter to work it. Our waiter was fast in showing up to take our orders but took the order for half of us and came back after 10 minutes to take the rest of the order. It took them a very long time to bring our drinks. Some of them came after we were almost finished with the appetizers the others were served with our entrees. By the way our drink order consisted of 2 pitchers of beer and 2 margaritas.Our biggest disappointment came with the entrees......5 of us ordered the bacon-guacamole deluxe burger  all 5 of them were cold in the middle  all of them were either medium or medium rare so you can imagine the taste of cold rare meat. I honestly don't believe they make fresh meat burgers  I think they microwave precooked frozen patties  either that or they must have been sitting on the kitchen countertop for a very long time.To be fair I have to say that we made them aware of this issue and they offered to bring us something else but we refused.If I ever go back it's only for the beer selection  which earned the 2 stars.
Yvette E.,Ridgefield Park  NJ,0,9,3,11/1/2016,5.0,The first location I went to was in Florida. Such a great atmosphere and service. They're ambiance is perfect for a night out with your family or if you want to catch a game with your friends. The food selection is immense and for the most part what I've tasted is the delicious. Their beer selection is great! I would definitely recommend for you to visit! I'll be going back
Paola A.,Ridgefield Park  NJ,0,2,,11/5/2016,5.0,Delicious food  great service  and the beer selection was impeccable! Loved the sling they have for a baby's car seat! Can't wait to go back!
Jerry G.,Ridgewood  NJ,0,15,,10/25/2016,5.0,Attractive restaurant; friendly waitstaff and bartenders. Great menu selections and many brews on tap. We had the BJ's custom brews which went down easy  plus several appetisers (crispy calamari plus the flatbread nachos). All was great and tasty! We will be back!
Carol S.,Clifton  NJ,0,3,,11/4/2016,5.0,We walked in today expecting something like an average chain restaurant experience like applebees or chilis but walked out with an amazing experience. Walking in the place was crowded  there was a 30 minute wait  which we expected since it was a Friday night. We got seated and right away our server Anna came to greet us. Since we haven't ever been to BJ's she recommended some of their beers that they brew and they were very tasty and unlike many others. She managed to give me a sample of probably my favorite beer that I ever had(Jeremiah red) we were very pleased with her recommendations from the beginning  we did try her appetizer that she recommended (stuffed spinach mushrooms) and they were great. Anna was always there to refill our drinks and always took care of anything we needed  her recommendations were excellent and I would definitely come to eat here again!
Joe S.,Manahawkin  NJ,2,3,5,11/20/2016,2.0,My girlfriend and I went out with another couple for dinner a few weeks after their opening and we were not impressed at all. The food is mediocre  and way over priced  in my opinion. We had ordered 2 appetizers  4 meals  and a couple of beers/mixed drinks each. The apps (boneless wings and potstickers) seemed to be fresh out of the microwave and on to the plate. The drinks were fine  but you can't really mess those up. Now my meal (jambalaya) wasn't bad  very spicy  but I enjoyed it. The other 3 meals were not so good (3 ribeye steaks) which were flavorless  over-cooked  tough and just boring. They come with a choice of 2 sides and soup or salad as well  which weren't anything to talk about. Once the check came we were all surprised by the total which was $215! For that price we could've gone to Segovias in Little Ferry  or La Cambusa in Garfield and spent around the same for way better quality food. All in all  I would not come back here  too over priced for the low quality food.
Clay B.,Lyndhurst  NJ,66,4,1,1/11/2017,1.0,I'm just having the worst time picking places. I saw this place a couple times while driving by and I figured I'd give it a try. I got wings and spinach and artichoke dip. The wings were ok way too salty. The ranch that came with them was unbearably salty as well. The dip was not bad but it was presented so ugly. I couldn't help but laugh. The bowl was only filled halfway but there was burnt crusts on the edge of the bowl and like 3 little sprinkles of parmesan cheese on top. Then the food came  I got a burger. Half of it was median and the other half was well and overall it was too salty. My friend got fried fish tacos  they smelled so fishy when they were set in front of us. For some reason 3/4 of the fish was battered and the pieces that were battered  it was barely hanging on. It was actually funny how bad everything was. On a positive note  the berry cider was good and Reina  the bartender was super nice. Id probably come back for her but nothing else. Definitely eat before you come in.
Robert A.,Rochelle Park  NJ,18,114,5,11/24/2016,3.0,I have visited the new location in Teterboro twice now. The first visit everything was great and I had high praise for them. I just made a second visit and it seems someone in the kitchen has developed a very heavy hand with the salt. I can say this for certain because I ordered the exact same food as on my first visit and the salt was so bad I had to send one of the meals back with specific orders that NO salt be used. It came back better (at to an edible level) but was still on the salty side.  I hope they can fix this problem soon as I will only go back for one more try and I really like the food when thyey go easy on the salt. They also screwed up the bill. The printed version of the bill was delivered to the table and I then used the mobile pay on their app so I could apply my points to lower the bill. I had a copy sent to my home email and when I looked at it they charged me twice for the dish I sent back. They should have comped it but instead they chargeds me twice. I sent them an email to get it corrected and will have to wait and see.
