Tina R.,Aurora  CO,20,40,3,11/11/2017,5.0,Excellent food and service Every time we have eaten here. It has become one of our favorites because there are so many wonderful choices. Really great drinks too.
Robert H.,Denver  CO,164,633,1933,11/10/2017,3.0,BJ's Restaurant is one of those places you go to grab a $6 beer and watch the game or celebrate a friends birthday over a $15 burger and $10 dessert. You wouldn't eat here for a casual $50 dinner in a sports bar style environment unless that's your thing.- Expect about 60 minutes from start to finish- Small parking lot- Good lunch/holiday specials- Excellent fries- Freebies with rewards program- Snag a table in the bar area to avoid waiting When it comes to value compared to quality  there are plenty of other places to eat. If you're looking for some decent food and good beer while eating with good company  the long service wait times won't bother you. I enjoy talking with my wife  but for those of you that don't it may make the long wait bother you. Be sure to arrive with food company and not be in any type of rush. I've never made it out in less than 60 minutes and usually wait around 45 minutes for a table. I ordered the chicken fried steak burger ($12.50) and the fries tasted double fried delicious. The burger was average size with a decent portion of avocado. I would order it again. Following my meal I ordered them snickerdoodle pizookie ($4.95) and it was gone in a few bites. Not recommended as a mini for two people.
Melisa U.,Elizabeth  CO,62,166,510,9/26/2017,1.0,Wow. Really bad service and really bad attitudes of employees here. I've been eating at BJs for years and have not had such a bad experience as I have had yesterday.We had a group of 5  with three of us not exactly skinny minnies and they tried to seat us in a small table (not even offering to move tables together) so we declined and asked to sit in a booth  which the hostess quite rudely said 'those tables are reserved for parties of 6 or more'. First of all  I saw three tables of four sitting at these round booths so that excuse was invalid. Secondly  we're not the skinniest of people  we probably could have been considered party of 7+ (weight wise) if you wanted to get technical.Our waitress Gena R. was amazing compared to the crap show of people hired at this location. She was attentive and kind and honestly the only good thing at this restaurant.The food was decent but the presentation of some things were severely lacking. The jambalaya plate was sloppily thrown together and they didn't even have the courtesy to wipe the edges clean before presenting it to us. The flatbread was cut very haphazardly  some pieces 1 inch while some were 3 inches. Very hard to eat when we were trying to divide it up between our group of 5. The attitude of the workers here also needs to be improved. They literally smirked at us as they were delivering the food to the table. The only good waitress was Gena R.
D. Chase H.,Arvada  CO,0,8,,9/11/2017,2.0,I offer an extra star for effort. Speedy & accountable delivery services - perfect balance of competence & rapport. But the food needs serious work. Avocado egg roles were greasy as shit - could only handle half of one before my gall bladder started to spasm. The tomato bisque was a tasteless  boring  overly salty & bloating  dairy-gassy-constipating disaster. The Brussel Sprouts were flashed-cooked frozen disappointments. The baked ziti was a pile of shameful  lackluster noodles - tangled up with Slim-Jim's & cheese whiz. Good workers though (honest  misguided?) - but sadly have no understanding of good food.
Carrie P.,Colorado Springs  CO,124,130,284,8/28/2017,4.0,Big menu  great selection of drinks and fun atmosphere. I love that they offer vegetarian options! The cauliflower tacos are awesome!Seriously  it may not sound like your thing but don't knock them till you try them! Full of flavor and the salad that comes on the side is also amazing. I can't wait to try making these at home  I found a new favorite! The iced coffee wasn't the best but once I added a shot of kahlua it was delicious!
Steven S H C.,Denver  CO,743,641,1838,7/26/2017,3.0,it's very spacious restaurant with hostess manning the front. there was larger group sat next to us but luckily they were finishing up.I was hungry so as soon as waiter showed up  ordered everything. appetizer came out very quick (just chips and queso) but drink tool awhile. has to remind him and he finally brought it out.food was huge portjon and price to match. around $15 for entry. check out the specials which are great deal. 3 stars suffice!
Carly P.,Bennett  CO,787,563,1862,3/10/2017,3.0,"I haven\'t been here since I first moved to Colorado back in 2006. So it seemed I was long overdue to stop back in for a visit.+ BJ\'s Restaurant & Brewhouse prides its self on a rather impressive tap list. Which I\'d have to agree is pretty darn good.+ They have a selection of lighter options (called ""Enlightened Favorites"") on their menu which I decided to try and found the North Beach Mahi and Shrimp to be both tasty and filling!+ My server was on point. He explained their rewards program to me  offered me a sample of a beer I was interested in  and checked back with me often to ensure everything was to my satisfaction.+ Ambiance is nice. Like a classy dimly lit brewhouse.+/- Prices were alright. A bit more than I expected.- Felt like the rewards program must be a new focus and was almost over mentioned to me during my visit. The hostess mentioned it as she sat me and the server several times during my visit. I would probably just have the servers discuss it with their tables personally. I\'d definitely like to stop back in and try some of their other menu items!"
Jacob F.,Aurora  CO,11,98,66,4/15/2017,1.0,Used to love to eat here and would once every few weeks however after an incident with one of the waiters that I won't go into and then another time when my wife ordered pasta and it came out frozen I refuse to go back. If it weren't for those two experiences then I would rate it much higher.Update: Terrible  terrible  terrible service. It seems like every time I go there we have an issue. Tonight we decided to give their delivery service a try. After 2 hours  we called to check on the status of our order and the person who answered said our order hadn't been processed yet and it would take another 90 minutes........really crappy because we used to enjoy their food for the most part  but the service always lets us down.
Leena N.,Aurora  CO,80,116,164,2/7/2017,3.0,Came here on Monday with my brothers to celebrate a birthday. We came here because it was in close proximity to where we were. We ordered the seared ahi salad  classic rib eye  and portobello swiss burger. It was not busy on a Monday night  but it still took awhile for the food to come out. The seared ahi salad and portobello swiss burger were delicious! However  the classic rib eye was okay. It was a bit tough and I was not a fan of the mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were lumpy and did not have a smooth texture. On the bright side  the waiter offered to buy a dessert for my brother for his birthday. The waiter was nice and attentive.
Mike S.,Aurora  CO,1,11,,9/29/2017,5.0,Wow!! What a fantastic experience! Everyone from the waitstaff to the Manager Maria were amazing! The food was great! They were also very helpful with the two children we brought with us. Even though they no longer make the Cheeseburger pizza (my favorite)  Maria agreed to have the kitchen make us one. I can't wait to be back!! Great job Maria and Aurora BJ's!
Una D.,Northwest Washington  Washington  DC,121,638,,6/5/2017,3.0,this is a solid three star place. nothing glam  nothing to make you have diarrhea  u get me?i came here with one of my girlfriends while visiting from out of town. she did warn me about the lackluster food in the area but we arrived here to shoot the s h  i t.foodribeye-meh  rubbery texture despite being mediumbaked potato-goodsalad-goodserviceour waitress seemed to take a really long time to get things to us and could have been a bit more attentive. but hey   a 20 year old doing this generally isnt doing it as a career incentive so i cut her slack  my friend was not happy about it  though because she had work in the morningpricegood for portion sizeambiancei like this the most about this location  lots of booths which are spaced outparkingfree  lotoverall: standard   american fare. i have been to another location before  this was not the first and it wont be the last..
Annie G.,San Diego  CA,842,105,283,10/24/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Let's start with the pros: the beignets on the dessert menu and the overall variety of food/beers.Not sure what's going on here but service is awful (like others have noted). I recently went on a Sunday night with two girlfriends. There was no wait and the restaurant was fairly slow. Despite the empty place  no one checked up on us for the first 15 minutes  which set the tone for the rest of the night. Returning to order - slow. Getting our beers - slow. Getting our check - slow. Everything took a long time. I love the selection on the menu but it's also pricey for average bar/grill food (and $16 pastas).
Lisa W.,Aurora  CO,0,39,8,9/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,This restaurant is still a great place to eat. Ordered a steak and it came out just as orderded  pink inside and it was a thick steak. mashed potatoes were stiff  not even butter did much good but the steak was more impprtant! good jog guys!
Chop H.,Aurora  CO,0,7,,11/10/2017,5.0,Every time we come here the food is spot on  service is very good to excellent  place is clean with a good energy! Keep it up  Aurora doesnt have alot of top notch places to dine in and BJs hasnt failed yet.
Nina B.,Mililani  HI,0,1,,9/16/2017,5.0,Had such an awesome experience this evening! The manager Elka Zlot and server Brittany S took amazing care of us! Thank you! We'll definitely be back!
Ruhama G.,San Francisco  CA,294,92,159,8/29/2016,3.0,Oh BJs  I really want to love you  in fact I've come back time and time again after countless bad outings and you have yet to prove yourself to me. It seems to me that there is definitely some sort of disconnect in the kitchen because orders rarely seem to come out right. This particular visit I got stale fries  and a burnt burger that was in fact supposed to be cooked medium. As far as orderscoming out incorrectly  this has been my experience every time I've come but the food DOES actually taste good (which is why I keep coming back). On a BRIGHTER note  our server Eric was fantastic. He was friendly  prompt with our requests and handled our complaints graciously. It's rare that I feel the need to send back food  I usually just suck it up but this time I couldn't ignore the mistakes. The manager did offer us complimentary soup/salad/dessert etc. which we kindly declined--it was a nice gesture but we were just ready to leave at that point. I'm still holding on to hope for a better experience at BJ's  it has all the makings and potential for a great restaurant -- maybe my run of bad luck with them will end soon. Xo.
Jenn M.,Pueblo  CO,36,127,24,4/12/2017,5.0,Try the root beer. It's really good. I went in for lunch. I was greeted by very friendly staff and seated immediately. The service was quick and friendly. The waitress was upbeat and made recommendations  without being pushy. I ordered the root beer  so yummy. I had the grilled ham and cheese sandwich. I know  not the most exciting thing they serve  but very good. And I don't even like sourdough bread  as a general rule. But this was just drenched in melted cheese  with thick ham slices. The fries were good. Not spectacular  but better than average. The waitress checked on us  without ever being intrusive. I was on a first date that went well  so we were there for awhile. But I never felt rushed. I didn't get to dessert  as my sandwich was so good and filling. But next time  I'm trying that cookie thing. When I left  the staff smiled and said good-bye.The food was very good. The service was above and beyond.
Sarah F.,Aurora  CO,0,3,,8/1/2017,1.0,On 7/29  my husband and I went to dinner. I ordered the sirloin steak cooked well-done. When my steak arrived  it was (at best) cooked medium. My plate was covered in bloody juice. I brought this to the attention of my server. She agreed that it was not cooked per my order. She took my steak back from me on a separate plate. While I waited for my steak  I tried to eat my baked potato. My baked potato was still hard and also not cooked all the way through. Since my steak was already messed up  I didn't both with requesting a new potato. I waited about 15 to 20 more minutes to get my steak back. This time  it is burned. I accepted it and left it at that. When my server came back  she said that her manager wanted to send me out a fresh side of asparagus for my steak since the original steak was undercooked. That never came. The server asked me after when we were finishing up if I still wanted that asparagus since it still hadn't come out. We didn't bother getting it. When I have had my food undercooked at other restaurants  the manager has always been the one to bring it back to me to confirm it being made correctly. I am disappointed that this BJs manager stayed in the back and let the server do all the work. I am also disappointed that the manager would offer a free side and then not follow through with making sure it was delivered. I do believe that after this failure occurred  the manager should have at the very least offered a free dessert or to discount our bill in some way. None of this happened. I very much doubt I'll be coming back to this place any time soon. It was horrible cooking for a $50+ meal. Seriously floored that someone could manage to screw up making a baked potato of all things. I do want to single out Shonte's (Shante?) service. She was great through the whole thing and very apologetic about the situation.
Alycia M.,Aurora  CO,146,39,57,4/18/2017,4.0,We come here every once in a while because the food is really really good! The service has never been outstanding but isn't terrible. There are constantly people walking around so they can help with refills and such. The cookie pies are so delicious! It tends to be a bit pricey but I'm okay with that because I always have leftovers.
Steven C.,Aurora  CO,1,2,2,9/9/2017,5.0,Great food and great service. We love this place. French fries have this light coating that makes them excellent. Ahi tuna salad is one of my favorites.
Kati E.,Denver  CO,121,8,,9/4/2017,5.0,"My ""go to"" after work! Awesome beers and good food! The staff is also very personable! Love the pizza and Brussels!"
Bianca S.,Aurora  CO,42,128,32,6/6/2016,5.0,I seriously love this place. I come here sometimes twice a week! My favorite things on the menu that they have definitely have to be the calamari  seared ahi salad  the crunchy fries  & their flat bread! Sooo freaking good. The seared ahi salad is huge and has just the right amount of wasabi and vinaigrette in it. They also have a to-go type service  you can call them and place your order  they tell you how long  and then you can pull up on the side in the take out parking  call the number on their sign and they'll bring your food out to you. Which is super awesome since I usually come after the gym & do NOT feel like waking into a restaurant to get food. They have this awesome seasonal peach beer and always have awesome seasonal brews. They're house beer is great too. LOVE this place  it's HUGE so there is never a wait when needing to be seated. Staff has always been efficient and friendly.
Anita R.,Aurora  CO,81,31,6,7/4/2016,5.0,This is one of my go-to spots.The Kale and Brussel sprout salad with shrimp is quite good. I've also enjoyed the Mahi-Mahi with shrimp.The menu has a good mix of American fare as well as a large health conscious selection
Russell C.,Aurora  CO,10,148,10,7/25/2016,5.0,This is a very interesting five stars. First off  the service was great! Our server was very attentive and kind. We started with the appetizer sampler. I had the jambalaya as my meal.So  this is where it went wrong. Our meals came out before the app which wasn't good because the app was huge. Our server noticed and apologized. We were a little disappointed because our meals were going to get cold before we finished the app. Without us saying anything  the manager came over  apologized  and comped one meal and the appetizer. I was impressed at how they handled the situation. I have never been treated with that much sincerity after a mix up.The food was awesome! I will definitely be back to get more jambalaya. Their beer is excellent too. I highly recommend the PM Porter  it's so smooth.You get five stars because of the excellent food  awesome beer  great service  and the way you handled the situation. I highly recommend coming here.
Jess M.,Aurora  CO,86,151,31,10/8/2015,3.0,We live right down the street from BJ's so it has turned into a frequent stop for us.We have always sat in the bar area because that's where we're most comforrable. The bartenders have always been very attentive and friendly. They keep a good eye on our drink levels and are quick to talk up the any new beers.The beer selection is good and the seasonals are usually pretty decent. During our last visit we tried the fall seasonals  oktoberfest and the pumpkin. Both were good. The pumpkin was subtle which I liked...a lot. Some pumpkin beers smash you over the head with pumpkin spice. BJ's is noticeable and enjoyable but not in your face.While the beers are always good  the food can be a little hit or miss. Their thin crust pizza and stuffed mushrooms are good. I would steer clear of the sliders. The patty is teeny tiny  like smaller than white castle burgers tiny and they don't have much flavor. The one time we ordered cheese sticks  they weren't melty all the way through. Sad clown face. We ordered both of those food items on the same night so it could have just been an off night for the kitchen maybe? I'm positive we'll continue to go to BJ's and work our way through the menu little by little. It's close to our house so it's convenient and we have always had great service and beers.
Marie C.,Glendale  AZ,0,6,,7/29/2017,5.0,Normally I refrain from chain restaurants. I was traveling with two others. After a long day of work and play we wanted to eat and go to bed. We were so hungry and of course all wanted something different. BJ's it was. It was quick to get to and had a variety of food. I was pleasantly surprised how the menu has changed with excellent vegetarian options past a traditional salad list. They even have small plate options that gave the feel of tapas eating style. Everything was delicious. Our waitress was fabulous! She had personality without losing her professionalism. I'd be happy to go back to that location.
Reese D.,Denver  CO,287,213,412,8/26/2015,4.0,We are moving out of Aurora  so I need to catch up on the reviews from this area. I've been to this BJ's probably a dozen times. I know it's a chain restaurant and many poopoo it  but it is seriously one of the only breweries in Aurora. Yes  it is a brewery. They brew on the premises and have a brewmaster. They have seasonal beers. They host beer-pairing events. They are also a restaurant and update their menu frequently.They have happy hour M-F both early and late night. I've never been disappointed in their pizza. Most of the food I've tried has been good to excellent. I've never had to send something back. Service has been from just okay to phenomenal. So  if I compile all of my reviews into just one star score  it is a 4. If it was less  I wouldn't have kept going back.They also have a rewards program and are constantly sending me freebies via email and their new app. I've never paid full price for a meal there  even if it is just a free Pizookie(tm). (It's a cookie pizza and they have killer flavors like Red Velvet  Salted Caramel  S'Mores  etc.)They once had a Bourbon Barrel Aged Stout that knocked my socks off. If they ever have it again  get it  lots of it. If not  get the Tatonka Stout. My personal fave. All of the other beers are well-crafted and you can't go wrong.So  if you are ever stuck in Aurora  this place is a very very safe bet.
Angela K.,Aurora  CO,202,9,,7/13/2017,2.0,So within a week I had BJ's twice. Once DoorDash delivered it. The food itself was good. But so much was forgotten. This was not a DoorDash issue but BJ's forgetting these items. My boys meals were not complete. DoorDash did rectify the problem. Then a few days later we went to BJ's with my dad who was visiting from out of town. It was strangely busy for a Wednesday night. However  we were seated at a table that still had drinks  napkins and check on it. My dads tacos were wrong and I was missing lemon in my water (small error). The food again was good  but I am becoming more and more unimpressed with service and accountability. With my dads tacos they did correct it before he asked  which was awesome  but all these errors in such short time for parties that are not big is turning me off from wanting to eat there physically or takeout.
Jeri C.,Dillon  MT,0,14,10,9/19/2017,5.0,Stopped in to watch some football. Super friendly staff & good specials during the game. Great place to stop by after shopping in this area.
Kathey H.,Bend  OR,11,2,,6/22/2017,2.0,Six of us came into this restaurant about 5 pm on a Thursday when there were perhaps two or three other tables filled. We were exhausted and thirsty after a long day in the mountains. We ordered water and drinks for 3 of our party first. It took an unusually long time for our waiter to bring them.  We then ordered dinner which was brought quickly enough by other staff. We needed a couple more plates and had to wait to flag down our waiter to bring them.  He never returned to refill our water glasses that sat there empty for most of the meal. We felt that this job might not be what he was cut out for. He was easily confused in taking both our dinner and dessert orders. I really believe when eating out the experience should be about the food and the service. The food here was good but the service left a lot to be desired.
Lindsay M.,Denver  CO,31,20,6,10/4/2016,5.0,Love this place! Great variety  but my favorite is the potato skins appetizer. I just moved to Denver from Saint Louis  MO and my folks recently came into town for a visit. While here  we went to dinner twice at BJ's because they're just THAT good! The service is friendly and they brought me a Pizooki for my birthday without request!
Bria M.,Denver  CO,71,9,11,12/8/2016,4.0,Awesome place for casual dining. Our server was pleasant and attentive. The food tasted fresh and delicious  overall really pleased with our experience here. We had the Honey Sriracha Brussels  Seared Ahi Tuna salad and the Kale and Brussels Salad with Oven Roasted Salmon.
Karmen K.,Aurora  CO,0,11,7,2/21/2016,2.0,I got sick once when I ate here. Even so  My brother wanted to come here for his birthday. Mom ordered online. It lost half the order and screwed up what it kept  first of all  and second  there's still a wait  so don't bother with it. Online or in the restaurant  you're still in for a wait. The ciders weren't cold enough and tasted like cough syrup.The girl who sat us didn't seem to get that we already ordered. She tried to get us to order more. The food: I got the Margherita flatbread. Here's how it looked online and IRL. I could only taste cheese. I figured try the kale and brussel sprouts salad. It was good. That and the staff's willingness to bend over backwards is its saving grace. I did try a bit of brother's birthday pizookie. It was great. At least they used good ice cream.
Jeff S.,Aurora  CO,285,623,19,2/2/2016,4.0,I've no idea how a review of BJ's has eluded my list for so long. If Old Chicago's and Rock Bottom had a child  it would be this. And I'd totally be willing to babysit.I've been here a couple times in the past  but in the last year Jess M. and I have been coming here quite often as it's just down the road from us. It's a place we come for a quick impromptu date night. They have great beers  the wine list isn't too bad either  and they do have some good signature cocktails.We've sampled much from the menu  pizza is tasty  and most of the appetizers are good. The only thing that I would recommend avoiding is the sliders  as the meat is the same size as the pickle on it. Other than that I love everything I've tried here. And I would be remiss if I neglected to make special mention of the pizza cookies (which apparently are bad for my heart and that brings up a source of contention between me and my bride to be which will not affect your review at all provided of course that you make it a point to sneak me a salted caramel as often as possible when she goes to the ladies room but I digress).Service is always great. We always sit at the bar and they have consistently impressed us. And the ladies at the host stand are always smiling and welcoming. Jeremiah Red and Tatonka Stout are my favorite of their own beers  but they also offer outside drafts as well.I really like being close to BJ's  and I've no doubt that I will continue to lend my patronage.Cheers!!
Corinne H.,Aurora  CO,195,167,883,2/26/2016,3.0,Pretty much what I come to expect from chain restaurant food. OK service a bit inattentive and on the slow side for the amount of customers they had. There is literally a 16 page menu...16 pages can be a bit overwhelming but I guess there is something for everyone with that many choices. I had the jambalaya and hubs had fish and chips. He enjoyed it  said it was slightly bland but was good after the addition of the malt vinegar. The jambalaya was okish and recommended by the waiter. Decent flavor  seemed like minute rice  and the veggies in it were way undercooked. We also had a pizookie but it was doughy and also seemed undercooked. This won't be my first choice ever but nothing to bad to keep me from coming back.
Colleen R.,Aurora  CO,19,16,,3/21/2017,3.0,Food was great. The service however was not. Theresa...not very engaging and slow. Didn't even check on us after we first got our food. Isn't that waitressing 101??
Caleb D.,Monument  CO,52,57,43,3/1/2017,2.0,Food was fine once it finally came. Service was below mediocre  server had zero personality and urgency. Very disappointing.
Raven L.,Aurora  CO,1,17,,6/9/2017,2.0,Pretty good food and large portions but the calamari was chewy and we couldn't finish it. Then the waiter kept bringing my daughter rootbeer floats which we assumed were free refills to find them added to the bill $4 each. Then when we were gonna order dessert we were handed the check. Not even asked if we wanted anything else. So we left and had dessert at home. Really overpriced. Will not go back.
Chelsea S.,Thornton  CO,102,26,45,3/2/2017,2.0,Terrible service... after rushing us through ordering  our server left us after the appetizer because her shift ended  then our next server left us before we even got a chance to order dessert... we were told that we would be getting another server but after 35 minutes of no one checking on us  we paid and left... food was good and good quality  but service was terrible... and this was on a Wednesday so it's not like it was a Saturday or something.... we won't be back despite the good being awesome
Cameron S.,Colorado Springs  CO,0,2,,6/4/2017,4.0,Great food and even better beer! Staff is friendly and spends an appropriate amount of time between checking on tables. Also the pizzookie is an instant nap on a plate.
John N.,Tarrant  TX,70,56,1,2/8/2017,3.0,I usually like BJ's but this particular location gave me food poisoning. And the service was slooooow.
Crystal B.,Denver  CO,360,10,11,6/21/2016,2.0,Hate I had to wait at the door with a toddler for 5+ min with servers walking by  eye contact with the bartender and no recognition of existence :( the place was maybe 1/3 full. I'd rather go to Yardhouse personally for dinner. It seems like they have been trying to cut food costs and lowered the quality. This coming from someone who use to go to BJ's all the time.
Dominique C.,La Crosse  WI,0,7,,5/18/2017,5.0,Came here on Thursday and got the Rib special. Came with a salad and two sided and a Dessert cookie. I could be more full or more happy. I will be coming back Thanks !!
Kevin K.,Alexandria  VA,4,56,36,6/15/2016,5.0,I got the salmon and while i was pretty good  I think i would go for something else on the menu next time.
Josh M.,Denver  CO,110,136,3,12/31/2015,2.0,I came here with a friend when our pho joint nearby was closed. The service was good. The menu reminds me of the cheesecake factory since there's so many items on it. I tried two items.The appetizer combo was hit and miss. The Santa Fe spring rolls were good and tasty. The same goes for the spinach and artichoke dip. The mozzarella sticks were room temperature and not melted at all. The avocado rolls got a little soggy.The seared ahi salad was okay. The rice wine vinaigrette was very acidic. Everything else was good about the salad.
Britt C.,Aurora  CO,0,37,,3/22/2017,3.0,Their menu is good  and if youre lucky it will be good. They have a really hard time with consistency here. Sometimes the food comes out all wrong  or takes almost an hour. Service is very hit or miss also. But  they have nice deals during the week and a decent happy hour.
Cody J.,Albuquerque  NM,0,10,1,11/8/2016,1.0,Tables were dirty all around us. Food was pretty good but the servers were on their cellphones. Manager was sitting at the bar end watching tv and talking to servers. She seemed very busy chatting. Not such a big deal but when one of them was my server and I didn't have silverware  it gets annoying. Beer was good. Just not very clean in the whole restaurant.
Camille H.,Denver  CO,78,150,20,12/14/2016,3.0,"Went here a week ago for my hubbys work holiday dinner. It looked like they had a more ""private area"" in a different section of the restaurant but we were all on one long table (multiple tables pushed together to form one long table) so you couldn\'t really converse with anyone that was 3 chairs down from you. We were all able to order what we\'d like from the menu which was nice. I choose poorly on my dish. It was the parmesan crusted chicken and potatoes with broccoli. The potatoes were the best part of the dish. The chicken was eh..had some weird flavored sauce on it which I just didn\'t like. my hubby had a yummy pasta dish  may have been baked ziti. That was really tasty. And a few others had steaks. They looked delicious but getting them was a weird scenario. After the 2 people ordered their steaks  they were told they were all out of them about 10min later. They ask to change up the size of the steaks and prices(I think they asked for 2 7oz steaks for the price of the 14 or something of that nature)  and the server went to ask a manager and then miraculously  they had the original sized steaks. It was just odd. But their steaks were very good they said in the end. They didn\'t really clear away plates and glasses  we had our appetizer plates still sitting on our table when we left.. other than that it was pretty good. Will be back sometime to try a different entre!"
Curt K.,Aurora  CO,0,42,,2/6/2017,4.0,had a nice lunch a couple of times- In the past had a watermelon salad that was so good. This time did the lunch menu. had a dish that was a southern chicken on a bed of potato with corn and gravy. Very tasty and a step up from the sanders version of a chicken bowl. Added a garden salad to it which was a decent salad. I did try the salsa and chips- I liked the salsa a little different flavor than you would expect in a Mexican restaurant but I liked it. The chips were freshly fried or heated. A nice lunch.
Jon G.,Aurora  CO,18,18,5,5/8/2016,5.0,Never been until just a couple of days ago. Service. Awesome  friendly and attentive. Looks of the place. Really clean  warm and inviting. Beer. House wheat beer  great flavor  not the best I've had  yet not the worse. Food. Had the steak  cooked perfect and great flavor. The tomato and mozzarella salad  was really nice. The white cheddar mashed potatoes were the BEST I've ever had. The Pizookie. Had the trio and the white chocolate and macadamia nut one won it for me hands down. Looking forward to the next visit for sure.
Chance H.,Denver  CO,407,158,1779,8/28/2014,1.0,Come to this bjs prob almost 1-2 a week for work lunches  take out & happy hour & it's always hit or miss with service :( one * for service & 4 * for the menu....for some reason in a small party we get not so good service & then in a lrg grp we get EXCELLENT service. Today  Thurs lunch  we sat in the bar for a party of 2 & received terrible service. Server did not check in on us  no utensils or napkins  was told he was bringing ketchup & we got NOTHING until our plates were mostly empty. Keep in mind we obviously needed utensils& napkins we had WINGS  salad  fries  bison burgers & sandwiches... It was my friends 1st time and not a great exp. I tried to get the servers attention probably almost 5x... I never write neg. reviews but was disappointed in the service :(
Sandman L.,Oakland  CA,29,57,5,12/20/2016,4.0,You know what you're getting here  large portions highly salty food. That was the only downside was the food was too salty. I had the seafood jambalaya one day and had the steak the day before. Sat at the bar to watch all the games the bartender was great can't remember her name but she switched the channels when it was necessary. Drinks are priced fairly also they have a wide selection of beer if you prefer. Great value for your money.
Jennie D.,Aurora  CO,4,14,1,1/22/2017,1.0,We love coming here but tonight the service was terrible. I don't know if they were short staffed or what but we felt blatantly ignored. Unfortunately our server didn't try to be anything but mediocre
Joanne E.,Aurora  CO,39,140,435,3/19/2016,2.0,"For some crazy reason I thought they could make a decent fish and chips. Nope. They have to go and ""personalize"" it with some type of tartar sauce that ain\'t. The fish was over cooked in thick batter and was greasy greasy greasy. Why they can\'t just leave the whole fish in one piece is beyond me. Almost everywhere I\'ve been in the states tends to have fish pieces cut up into little chunks. Bleh. Hubbs had the clam chowder which was more potato than clams. Not overly excited to return."
Charles P.,Aurora  CO,16,34,3,12/22/2016,4.0,All and all good service and food tons of stuff to try having a 25 page menu. Lots of craft beer and harder drinks.
Kelcee W.,Sterling  CO,36,11,1,1/11/2017,5.0,Came here with my boyfriend and had a more than perfect dinner. Appetizer was out super quick  drinks were perfect  and our food was out in a timely manner. We were told about the mobile app and downloading it got us a free pizookie and a discount on an entree Our waiter was Dawan Cushinberry. Very attentive  always kept a smile on his face. We were absolutely impressed!!!
Toni D.,Orlando  FL,604,530,566,4/18/2014,2.0,Service was terrible! The waitress took forever with everything. I honestly think she forgot about our table for a while. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken And The wedge salad were both delicious.Also  there's a coupon on the website if you spend $20 save $5.
Kaitlyn E.,Myrtle Beach  SC,275,24,85,9/16/2016,5.0,Food was excellent! We had the stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer and that were so full of flavor! I also had the Mediterranean chicken pita  which was delicious!!!! Our server  Jeremy was by far one of the best servers we have had! He was very attentive and full of personality!
Alex R.,Jacksonville  FL,0,2,,1/7/2017,2.0,Howdy This was the first time my brother  mom  and I went to Bjs. I ate at a BJs in Jacksonville and had a great meal there. Needless to say  i hyped it a bit. That being said  my mom ordered the penne shrimp and asparagus and my brother ordered the ribeye with broccoli and mashed potatoes. They were both displeased with the quality of the food they received. The sauce for the shrimp was watery and underseasoned. My brother complained that you couldn't taste the steak. However  you could taste thr char on it.. The service was good. The waitress smiled and was attentive to us  coming around filling our glasses routinely.
Bev C.,Syracuse  NY,21,111,99,9/18/2015,5.0,6 of us enjoy ran early Friday evening out at BJs. The avocado egg rolls were delicious: creamy and with a nice spicy bite. The Brussel sprouts were roasted to perfection - a nice size portion for 2 people. Flat bread pizza appetizers were way too big for one person. We enjoyed beers around and the pumpkin peach had a good pumpkin flavor: good enough for a glass but maybe too much for 2. All in all this was a good place for happy hour. We'll go again!
Samantha G.,Los Angeles  CA,2,4,3,9/15/2016,5.0,I love the pizza from BJ'S I always get the gourmet 5 meat and a berry burst cider or the Jeremiah red. Best pizza you can get for a sit down restaurant. I highly recommend trying the 5 meat pizza with a side of parmesan cheese you won't regret it!
John J.,Northwest  Denver  CO,45,223,19,5/19/2015,5.0,We went to bjs due to the recommendation of an out of town friend and the food network showing Chicago style pizza.Pretty cool place. Open but once seated feels like any other restaurant. Our server Shane quickly greeted us and got us some drinks. He also answered any of our questions and was very patient until we were ready to order. Beer was good  I ordered a Dales and he also brought along a sample of their pale ale... I should have just mustered up and ordered that in the first place. It was delicious! I only ate about a slice of my pizza because I was not very hungry and Shane made sure that everything was okay and that I enjoyed my pizza  which I did.Good pizza  good beer and great service... We will definitely be back for a deep dish!
Brooke F.,Aurora  CO,0,4,5,12/17/2016,5.0,We order from BJ's through GrubHub. Never have been to the restaurant itself  but every single time we order from here  the food is SO good! Brussel sprouts  parm crusted chix  pizookies- everything we have tried  we have loved. Worth the $$ to just order & enjoy at home!
Kathryn T.,Colorado Springs  CO,22,3,,8/9/2016,5.0,Stopped by this restaurant last night for a late dinner and was not disappointed!! We were greeted by a friendly host  wound up sitting in the cocktail area and our server was on top of every detail of our dining experience. Always topping off our drinks  food came out flawlessly  despite the late hour. All of the employees throughout the restaurant were working hard  staying busy getting done what they needed to. It was refreshing to see such a well organized work environment. What really caught our attention though was that the manager on staff  Burt  took time out of his evening duties to greet our table and make sure our dinner was going well. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and we'll be back for more soon!
Sonja A.,Aurora  CO,123,259,511,7/20/2015,5.0,My son and I love this place. New food and drink menu items (Hickory BBQ Burger).....totally yummy! Oh  and the Salted Caramel Pazookie....it's da bomb! Share it in a Pazookie Trio for sure.
Fred F.,Centennial  CO,13,112,97,10/7/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Well this is one of those times you wish yelp had 1/2 stars. Dinner was really 2 1/2 stars. I ordered the full rack of ribs and they were ok but could have used some sauce. I ordered the tomato bisque soup as one of my side dishes. It came late as they were making it I was told but it was barely warm. My friend ordered the sirloin steak which came as an oddly shaped steak with no grill marks and was very small. His grilled asparagus looked like it had been grilled yesterday  if you are going to grill asparagus it cannot be as thin as a pretzel  it was shriveled up to nothing. Service was ok but nothing great. No real reason to go back we had 2 appetizers mushrooms ok and calamari so so bill would have been just about 60 bucks if not for the 2 for 1 coupon. 2 appetizers 2 entrees and 2 ice teas the meal was not worth the cost. There are plenty of other places we could have gone and probably will not bother going back coupon or not.
Loreen G.,Aurora  CO,69,21,,8/27/2016,2.0,To start with the positive  the bartender Brittany is so nice and responsive. She has a great sense of customer service. To move on with my review  I ordered the hot ham and cheese sandwich and it was not hot ...at all...even though I sent it back once. It came back just as cold the 2nd time. I'm not one to send food back as I can generally make anything work  but even the cheese on this sandwich was still cold and unmelted. To be fair  Brittany continued to be awesome and did not charge me for the sandwich  but I certainly don't know if management here knew or cared. My two stars is for the food....maybe the menu is just too extensive for any one thing to be really good  but the customer service from the bartender was great!
Sally H.,Aurora  CO,125,102,281,4/14/2015,3.0,I love how this place is open late and close to home. My boyfriend and I always end up here if all other restaurants near by are closed. Service here is always good and they have a large menu to choose from. It can get overwhelming because the pictures looks so good and we want to order everything. However  the items can be a hit or miss. This last time we ordered the New Orleans jambalaya  chicken wings  the salted caramel pizookie  and a few alcoholic drinks. They have a great selection of beers  ciders  and wine. The jambalaya was pretty good  but it was definitely too much for me to eat. My boyfriend loves chicken wings and these were just okay. The pizookie  however  was divine. It was definitely sweet  but the vanilla bean ice cream cuts the sweetness. Another time  we had ordered the s'mores pizookie. That was amazing as well. I think next time we will just come here for their dessert. We are dying to try their beignet.
Kat M.,Preston  Australia,15,9,,2/19/2016,4.0,I come here mainly for dessert; I must confess I'm in love with the s'mores pizookie  but have yet to eat an entire one in one sitting! I also quite enjoy their watermelon basil margaritas right now  and I always order the stuffed mushrooms as well!Prices are decent - I do usually feel like I've spent more than I wanted to  but then I remember that that's because my eyes got bigger than my stomach...Service seems attentive and kind whenever I go - I do tend not to go during busy times  but the one time I did go during dinner  service was still great!
Benjamin F.,Aurora  CO,17,41,112,7/8/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,"The food is pretty poor here. Was with friends and tried a little bit of everything. The top sir loin was like a kids cuisine microwave dish. It was dry  gross  and ridiculously small. The only thing that I would recommend from this place was a the mixed drink they had called ""A Drink like that"" and the sliders. Everything else is was pretty bad and overpriced.The drinks we had were the Jeremiah Red  the PM Porter  The Dark Side of the Moom  and a Drink like that. To be fair  I visit an excessive amount of local brewries and craft beers can be hit or miss. But these beers here were bellow par. If your just looking to try something different and don\'t care much for taste or quality this is place to go. If I was tell you why the Jeremiah Red and PM Porter were bad I would simply say the yeast had not been properly fermented at the right temperature. It was excessively bitter and the red ale I had here before did not have that level of bitterness.The food we ordered was the parmessan chicken  top sirloin  stuffed mushrooms  avocado egg rolls  double chocolate pzookie  and sliders. The egg roll and mushroom appetizers had almost identical fillings. The stuffed mushrooms were clearly the better of two but as you can see from the images many of the egg roll and mushroom appz were overcooked and even blackened at some points. With that said I still enjoyed most of the appz. I just wished it was prepared with a bit more care.I ordered the sliders at the same time I ordered desert simply because I saw multiple people order it and I wanted to actually try a meal that tasteted good before I left. The pzookie was advertised as a American Classic was actually good and the sliderd were great tasting and only $8.95. They were actually cheaper than the egg roll appetizer.The cost just did not come close to the quality for the majority of the things we were served."
Jen M.,Southeast  Denver  CO,4,51,205,1/28/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I hate to give bad reviews..... But I have zero patience when I have to wait 15 minutes to even be acknowledged by our server. There were hardly any tables and we were hardly there at a busy time.... 3:00pmCouldn't get refills  forgot parts of our order. I am not going to be in a hurry to return . It's more expensive than it's worth
M K.,Aurora  CO,3,82,2,7/12/2016,3.0,Wife and I come to BJ's probably every other month or so. Service is pretty good but they have a bad habit of bringing out the appetizer with the meal  or in our case yesterday  AFTER our entrees were served. Food is hit and miss as well. Tavern style pizza are overpriced for what you get. Everything here is hit or miss. Sometimes we have great food and service  other times its lackluster. Great homecrafted rootbeer though!
Bryan E.,Apple Valley  CA,0,5,1,6/27/2016,5.0,Ok. So I brought in 15 people at 10pm for Pazookie. I know...good decision right? They were very friendly and seated us immediately. The Pazookie was incredible and the service was great. Would come back if I ever visit the Denver area again.
Michael P.,Aurora  CO,103,389,21,1/21/2015,4.0,Great place to take a group of friends to eat! This BJ's location has great staff who do an excellent job making you feel welcome.  The Cheeseburger here is the reason that I come...always cooked the way I like it.Great selection of drinks/spirits  but the desert cookie has been overcooked the past 2 times that I have been. Overall  very solid!
Anna Z.,San Jose  CA,525,342,674,1/11/2015,4.0,Four stars for the pizookie! Three stars for the food. But this review is for all the times I go after dinner for some delicious pizookie:)This BJ is very spacious. It has a large area with multiple compartments for dining and a large bar area with tall tables for those who just want a beer. I like to come with my boyfriend after dinner for some dessert. We walk right in since the bar area doesn't require you to wait to be seated and we just walk in a grab a table. Waiters and waitresses usually come very quickly with menus and ask us what we want to drink. The happy hour doesn't start until 10pm so usually when we go it's too early but we get a beer anyways. My boyfriend always gets the Jeremiah red which is a dark strong beer and I get something fruity and light. The apricot ale is pretty good. And of course we get a single chocolate chunk pizookie which is this warm chocolate chip cookie topped with French vanilla ice cream. It's a heavenly mix of sweetness and both warm soft cookie with the chilling pairing if the ice cream. This is definitely one of my favorite desserts on earth!:) Pizookie also comes in a flight form with three smaller pizookies so if you wanted to try more flavors  get the flight! But I'm very happy with my chocolate chunk. It's a good amount for two people without feeling overwhelmingly sweet and stuffed.
Taylor J.,Aurora  CO,0,16,4,3/11/2017,1.0,Until they bring back the red velvet pazookie I will refuse to go here and so will all of my friends. That was the best dessert and now we feel robbed of our satisfaction. BRING BACK THE RED VELVET PAZOOKIE IT CANT BE THAT HARD
Melody T.,Aurora  CO,58,7,,2/12/2017,3.0,I had an average experience here. Although this wasn't the first time I went to this location I have come back because the food will fill your belly and excite your taste buds! Two of my girlfriends and I walked in about 5pm on a Saturday night and were not greeted  the hostess just stared at us for a while. Finally (only really a couple minutes) she greeted us and asked how many  but we were not given the option of booth or table. We were given a booth in between two parties (one which was very loud  we couldn't even have our own conversation). Our waiter looked busy but he did let us know were are not forgotten about and that he would be right with us for our drinks. Although he seemed tired and overworked he did his best to connect with us and make our time enjoyable. After a while of waiting for our food we noticed people that had ordered after us were almost done with their dinner. About an hour of having to wait for our food we were finally told the reason it was taking so long is that to chefs burned the burger. Whether that be the truth or not I feel as if we should have been offered at least complimentary drinks for us for the long wait. No compensation was given  and no apology just an excuse.
Denise R.,Aurora  CO,629,477,901,6/26/2015,1.0,All I can say is horrible horrible horrible horrible service big time I don't know if I seen one happy table in the place not to mention after I ate I didn't feel so good maybe it was because they gave our food to the next table over and then came and brought it to us ughhhhhh
Curtis H.,Denver  CO,42,250,299,9/25/2015,4.0,Decided to have lunch at BJ's with my father  prices were a little high for lunch but we decided to go anyway. My father got the all you can eat soup and salad and ordered the shrimp scampi pasta. My father raved about how great the clam chowder was...I gave it a shot too and I would say it was pretty good. My shrimp pasta was really good and was loaded with fresh shrimp. However  the pasta needed more salt  I get the need to lower sodium  but this needed more. I'm sure I will return with my wife  very soon.
Jack K.,Denver  CO,138,150,12,5/15/2014,4.0,This was my second time visiting a BJ's Restaurant. The first time I visited was at a BJ's on the way to Boulder from Denver  and I almost swore them off for life due to terrible service  but that's old news. My experience at this BJ's was quite different  and the bartender  whose name I cannot remember now  deserves to be running the place. I had just got back from Chicago on Monday evening May 5th. I hadn't eaten dinner yet  and this was one of the only places open in the area. The food is some of the best I've ever had at a chain restaurant like this  and they had a happy hour going that made drinks and food nice and cheap.The highlight of the evening however  as I already mentioned  was the bartender. She was the exact opposite of the staff at the last BJs I went to. She was funny  she sparked some conversation without being overzealous  it was the end of the day and she still had a smile on her face. It may not seem like much to some  but that is all I ask of someone serving me  and it never ceases to amaze me how many servers screw it up. Anyway  we came in and sat at the bar right before they stopped serving food. She got us our food quickly  stayed on top of our drinks (alcohol and water)  and compelled me to give this particular BJs a good review. Kudos to you nighttime bartender on May 5th!
Tait L.,San Diego  CA,9,81,157,7/6/2015,5.0,Out in Denver Colorado on business and stopped at BJ's. It was on a Monday so... Not really busy. Eat at the bar. Quick service. Good beer and food. Had the jambalaya. It's very good. I am probably not the best person to judge jambalaya tho  (raised in socal) Enjoyed the Jeremiah Red and the seasonal IPA. Thank you Shaina. Well done.
Dee S.,Aurora  CO,3,199,11,8/6/2016,1.0,"Don\'t order online for pickup. I ordered the Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad. The lettuce was brown. There was no almonds or hard boiled eggs. Also  they don\'t provide dressing even though the salad was advertised as ""tossed with honey mustard dressing"".  The sticker on the to-go container said \'no honey mustard\' but there was no place online to opt-in or opt-out for dressing. I could understand if they have a bug in their online software but the quality of the salad was terrible."
David K.,Aurora  CO,13,7,5,11/21/2015,5.0,I love this restaurant. The food is tasty and i love the ambiance of the room. Definitely coming back for the Pizookie! That dessert is a bomb.
Cecile L.,Walnut Creek  CA,63,39,7,5/6/2016,4.0,Good food but nothing exceptional... Service is always good with a wonderful selection of beer.
Andrew B.,San Mateo  CA,1,210,12,6/23/2016,3.0,Inconsistent and poor attention to detail. Mixed up entrees and iffy service. Great if they are on their game  but its a 50/50 shot.
Morgan M.,Denver  CO,182,251,2065,7/12/2015,2.0,"Haven\'t been to BJ\'s in years and wanted to go to something different well that was a mistake. We went at 11:15 and the restaurant was pretty dead only a couple tables filled. We got sat right away and didn\'t have a waiter for 5 minutes . Our waiter finally arrived and we greeted him ""hi how are you ?"" And he replies "" dead tired and only here because I really want money"" ! Okay that was the first issue : the negativity . Next we ordered drinks and food right away and it took another 5-7 minutes to receive our drinks. The ice tea came with 4 cubes of ice and was lukewarm melting the ice in the cup. More like room temperature tea. Our appetizer came out pretty prompt  it was the avocado egg rolls but no plates to share with our party of 4. The avocado egg rolls were subpar and kind of spicy. Our food soon came out yet our server never returned. He never asked how our food was or checked up on us  or even asked if we needed anything else ! One of our friends had the Ahi Tuna Salad and said it was decent  another friend had the chicken finger salad and liked it   my mom had the California Chicken Club and liked it   unfortunately my salad was horrible. It was the Berry Brussel sprout kale salad. The Brussel sprouts were hard and cold not roasted like they said in the description. The Arugula  kale  spinach mix was soggy in the berry dressing. Little amount of nuts and grapes. Would never get again ! Finally after our waiter came back he refilled the tea with no ice of course and was like maybe I should clear these plates. He asked if a friend wanted to box the rest of her salad she said no and he starred at her and looked at our other friend and was just like fine whatever . Rude rude rude and just all around negative. Not only was service horrible and slow but food was just not that good and the waiter was rude. Would defiantly not recommend it ."
Margie D.,Port St. Lucie  FL,0,86,12,4/22/2016,5.0,I love this restaurant. I'm 45 minutes away so I can't frequent every week (wish I could). They are consistent with the quality of food and love their home brewed Jerimiah Red beer. 7.5% Alcohol and it is delicious! usually the higher the Alcohol  the bitter it is  but not with this one. I'm mad that I can't find anything like it someplace else. Food is good  beer is good.
Alan N.,Oklahoma City  OK,172,504,295,6/23/2015,5.0,Good place to grab lunch  huge menu selection and lots of beers (obviously). The staff is very friendly and attentive  clean place and decently priced. Plenty of TVs at the bar for sports and TVs around the whole restaurant. I typically get burgers here which are really good  and it's pretty conveniently located with plenty of parking.
Sasha S.,Aurora  CO,50,24,,4/27/2016,3.0,"BJ\'S makes it seem like gluten free is easy and super safe. They talk about separate sides of the kitchen and trained staff. Except  the staff knowledge is hit or miss. The food quality is inconsistent at best as is the cleanliness of the dining area. I\'d rather not take the risk here anymore. It\'s not worth it. Also  if you\'re a celiac  DON\'T get ""To-Go"" here...they can\'t make it GF!"
Darin B.,Aurora  CO,1,97,101,9/10/2015,5.0,I have never had a problem when eating here! Prices are fair! Food is great! The menu is large many choices to pick from. Mahi-mahi grilled tacos are my favorite! Service is great! I don't have anything bad to say about this restaurant. Chicken wings are also great and spicy if that's what you like!
Denise G.,Aurora  CO,145,288,259,5/28/2015,4.0,BJ's is a great place for a variety of food choices. They have a great menu with a ton of choices. I was feeling fish this time and went with the mahi mahi over pineapple fried rice. We also went with some appetizers  since they were on happy hour. The mozzarella and tomato salad was good except it had too many onions. They were over powering. The flat bread was okay  but a little bland. The crispy fried artichokes were awesome and seasoned well. I loved the mahi on the rice. It had just enough flavor to not overwhelm the whole dish. The service was great. The bartender was active and on top of the whole bar's drinks and food orders. We will be back and continue to try more options on the large menu.
Srizzle C.,North Liberty  IA,0,16,,9/22/2015,1.0,Nope. I have been twice  today we attempted to give them a second chance. Items ordered: honey crisp salad  avocado egg rolls  pepperoni pizza  kids corn dogs. The only meal that was any good? The corn dogs. Salad ( we also had side salads) had bad lettuce  missing components and just generally lacked flavor. The pizza didn't have pepperoni. Egg rolls were way over spiced  and just tasted awful. Wait staff wasn't that great either. This trip was supposed to be a redeemer for BJ's  as our trip two weeks ago had the same kind of food and experience. I waited to write a review  wanting to be fair. Sorry BJ's  you don't get a third chance to make an impression.
Brian A.,Aurora  CO,1,23,,5/11/2016,3.0,Not a bad spot to grab a drink and the service is pretty good but dips when it gets busy. The poke salad is one of my favorites but it seems like the bigger dinner plates are not that good. I would recommend lunch or after work drinks and apps. The Beer is really good and huge selection. I think the food is not consistent because the menu is so large but you have plenty of options to choose from. I am usually not that pleased when I order anything other than my favorites. They have really good hours and are open pretty late
Paris V.,Denver  CO,51,53,20,6/10/2015,5.0,I love coming here  my waitress Sholay makes the best recommendations. The mozzarella salad I didn't even know you had and I don't even think about coffee at a place like this but it was exactly what I wanted. Sholay was on top of everything  even when it got super busy our drinks were always full and we got excellent service. She also recommend the salmon which was super amazing  with her I would probably still be eating the same sandwich over and over. It's great to have a waitress who knows the food.
David R.,Denver  CO,0,3,,4/11/2016,5.0,Incredible food great beer excellent service not the kind of place I expected to find here this area is obviously up and coming
Robert R.,Colorado Springs  CO,64,597,36,2/24/2014,4.0,We always get great service at this location as we usually have a large group and sometimes that is dicey. Just apps and drinks this last visit. We failed to call ahead (we had a group of 10)  but they quickly put together a table for us. Drinks were quickly delivered and the apps followed. We got the sampler plate. Really not my thing  as there wasn't much on there that I liked  but that's me.We will be back. easy  convenient  consistent.
Ron D.,Aurora  CO,0,39,,1/4/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Every time I have went there the service has stunk. Slow waitstaff that left me sitting with no food for over an hour (including an elderly couple). I will not return ever.
Sara R.,Denver  CO,9,51,69,1/30/2016,4.0,I think this place deserves more than the 3 stars given by other reviewers because it is one place in Aurora that you can get a little vibe going. If you want beers and TV's they have a really nice set-up. Great for football games because  in the bar  I can see all the TV's and the tables aren't crammed together. If you want a cozy booth for a romantic date  they have that too. The dining room can also accommodate very large groups so it would be good for holidays or office lunches. The dining room reminds me a little of Maggianos where it is open and decorated to the hilt. The beer list is very  very good. I am a picky beer drinker and I found at least three good beers: the brew house blonde  the Tatonka Porter and the Jeremiah Red  all native to BJ's. They have a bunch of common domestics like Blue Moon and Kona Brewery. Tons of IPA's. The food was better than decent. I don't like deep dish pizza but theirs is light and fluffy!!! (Not sure how you do that unless there is egg in the dough?!? Seriously it was that fluffy.) The deep dish Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza was yummy. I had the avocado egg rolls as a meal and  with the sauce  it was a solid 6. I say give it a shot. Your other choices on this street are chili's and TGI Fridays and this is way  way  way better than that.
Nick A.,Los Angeles  CA,537,517,1981,11/8/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Went back there again after poor service and a 2 star rating the first time I went there.MUCH improved from last time! They have really good lunch specials. Pizza and salad for $5. I had a burger and fries for under $7. It was plenty of food.They can get busy  but you can call them and be put on the waiting list so your wait will be minimal.By far the best part of the experience was Nikki  the server. Personality plus  along with excellent service. BJ's should be super proud to have her on their team! 10 stars for Nikki!
Michael J.,Aurora  CO,249,35,13,3/8/2015,4.0,We went there today for Dylan 5th birthday celebration after a crazy time at the jumpalene place. It was a good experiance. My 3rd time to this chain. Once in Long Beach Ca. And the other time here. The waitstaff was very good. We started off with calamari appetizers. I thought it was very good. Very light not greasy. The had a blond beer that was very good there and thoroughly enjoyed.i had the chicken that was crusted with parmigiano cheese  mash potatoes and my favorite broccoli. Some fold had burgers but all were satisfied. Dylan loved the bottomless chocolate milk. For desert the have those fresh baked cookies with ice cream. Dylan was free but he never touched it! Over all a very good experiance. I recommend it.
Ryan T.,Denver  CO,1,15,5,5/2/2015,2.0,Excellent food  great atmosphere. Terrible service. We came for lunch. Food was cold. We had to wait for fries. Being the bill took 15 minutes. If you are very patient this is the radiant for you.
Tsvetanka T.,Aurora  CO,31,1,,3/2/2016,4.0,Really like the food. Our server Sierra was amazing.The only think we didn't like was the hostess Narda really extremely rude and her attitude was horible.
Melissa C.,Aurora  CO,4,52,23,3/22/2015,5.0,I love this place! It's close to home and is always a great dinner hot spot. The hostesses are always friendly and the beer is great. The main reason why I keep coming back are because of the avocado egg rolls. They are to die for. I always get them as my meal with a salad. As long as they have those in the menu I'm in!
Stephanie B.,Aurora  CO,48,8,4,11/29/2015,2.0,We have dined here with the entire family many times (3 kids and ourselves). The food is usually really good. The service is hit or miss. Yesterday we had a late lunch and ordered 2 appetizers and a pizza. We asked them to substitute mushrooms in place of tomatoes. And also the the chicken wing be extra crispy. The chicken wings were good  bit the skin was rubbery  then the pizza didn't have mushrooms and they put them on and put it back thru the oven which made the normal yummy buttery crust hard like a petrified tree in the forest. My other pet peeve with this place is that when you have 5 people sitting at a table meant for 4 with out grabby kiddos  I would really love that you take away as much as you can of used dishes  not set down main course and walk away while leaving a stacked (by me) pile of dishes. We are tight on space to start with!!!!!Oh and for the lady sitting next to us....DONT EVER EVER AGAIN ORDER STINKY FRIED FISH.....you stunk up the entire restaurant with that crap!
M K.,Chandler  AZ,1,26,,8/27/2015,4.0,I will give you the best advice ever if you want to try this place. Avoid Friday and Saturday nights. Everything else was great. Good food. Not a huge fan of the 'appetizer's. Good burgers  GREAT ribs  good sauce.
Nathan S.,Belleville  IL,1,3,,9/7/2014,3.0,Great food and unbelievable black Cherry soda  but wait. This location is one of 3 stores that do not have the black cherry soda. What a disappointment. I am traveling out of town and was so looking for to a great black cherry soda as we do not have BJ's in St. Louis. Almost got up and walked out when I heard the bad news.At least they do have the under cooked cookie for desert.
Heather T.,Denver  CO,332,783,954,11/18/2013,3.0,I'm just not a fan of brew pubs in general. I find them to have standard fare without much originality. BJ's has done a better job than most of mixing things up a bit. We came here for a business lunch and realized too late there is no wifi. Boo to that but understandable. Our service was pleasant but scattered. We ordered the fried artichoke heart appetizer which was good and had exactly the flavor profile one would expect. For my main I ordered the garden burger with a side salad. The salad was sad. Iceberg lettuce with croutons  sliced cucumber and tomato. The lettuce was drowning in dressing - do I eat or resuscitate?The veggie burger was a standard garden burger. I has asked for it plain and that's what I got and it tasted exactly like I thought it would. It filled me up but didn't rock my taste buds.
Cat S.,Aurora  CO,252,381,304,5/24/2011,4.0,When we stepped into BJ's  I was wary - thinking it kind of reminded me of a large Cheesecake Factory. BJ's definitely surpassed this and was a pleasant surprise.We started out with the fried artichokes appetizer and some beer: I had the Berry Citrus beer.. that tasted like carbonated fruit juice and I loved it. The boyfriend had the Irish Root Beer - a concoction of root beer with liquor. Delicious.As for the food  everything that we ordered was very good! I had the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps which were fresh tasting and the well balanced between sweet and spicy. The boyfriend got fish and chips and the I loved the wedge fries and the beer battered fish. Friends got stuffed mushrooms  mozerella sticks and the veggie burger. All very satisfying. I wish I could say we had room for dessert  but unfortunately  we were all stuffed  which tells you how big the portions are (most of us got appetizers!).
Lori P.,Aurora  CO,48,207,720,1/1/2013,4.0,We normally rely on yelp for our eats and try to stay away from chain restaurants. I can be picky with my pizza and BJ's happens to serve my very favorite pan pizza in the state of Colorado. The portions are large  atmosphere is fun and the drinks good. We'll continue to come back !
Roger G.,Aurora  CO,129,206,65,8/13/2013,4.0,This place is a good place to get a chicken fried steak for dinner. They do pizza and a hundred other things (reminded me of the cheesecake factory). Anyone can find something to eat on this menu. We had the chicken lettuce wraps which we thought were tasty. I recommend the watermelon salad.They have their own root beer and cream sodas which is a big plus for me and gives them an extra star. Service is attentive and good.
Broderick G. D.,Aurora  CO,0,12,1,2/18/2015,4.0,It was my 1st time here   my wife and i started off with the avocado egg rolls and they were very good. I had a strawberry lemonade ( made just right ) along with the jambalaya  I've never had it served on rice pilaf before but it was good also.The service was great and the atmosphere was very nice also   i think we'll take out of town guest there whenever they visit.
Brian M.,Aurora  CO,15,2,,1/24/2016,3.0,Food was great but the server(Travis P.)was terrible. There were 3 tables in his section (including mine) and he was more interested in helping his friends and watching football.
Eric B.,Aurora  CO,0,6,,7/25/2016,3.0,I enjoyed their version of a caprese salad and was looking for the recipe when the main course Ribeye arrived. As an avid meat eater  I was very disappointed. How can you screw up a med - rare ribeye? This seemed like it started with a tender cut and yet it was flavorless. Their double secret spice rub is aptly named  please don't share this flavorless rub with anyone else. The most flavor came from the slight charring. The brussel sprouts were also unimpressive.
Kyle H.,Aurora  CO,48,4,1,12/30/2015,4.0,Good beer  good food. Our server was a little absent at times  but we had a great time. We'll still come back
Brittany C.,Denver  CO,0,6,1,12/29/2015,1.0,Where to start... first off we got sat by a noisy party. In a timly manner a server came and introduced herself. We had asked to move to the opposite side of the wall because how loud and crowded it was with the large party. She gave a dirty look and said well it won't be the same server and just walked away. So we move... and wait... no one came over. The same server walked by multiple times. Finally  what looked to be a manager whom never introduced himself asked if we needed drinks. We got drinks and then he took our order. A random person asked if we needed plates  another person brought our food  no one came by to get us refills  I got up and went to the bar  even though a bunch of servers walked by our unrefilled drinks. All in all the food was good but the service was so disappointing. The ticket says our server was Laura but from our experience we didn't even have a server.
Mardell M.,Cottage Grove  OR,136,16,4,5/22/2016,1.0,"Visited this place on a non-busy  Thursday night around 7:30. We were seated at a table in the bar. There was one large crowd  about 8 people at the table next to us that was just finishing up. 1/2 the other empty tables around us had not been cleared from the previous patrons. We sat for over 15 min before being acknowledged by any staff members. We ordered beers and the avacado egg rolls right away  and waited another 15 min. I could see our waitress talking to another guest as our beers sat at the servicing area getting warm. Another server delivered them to us and said "" it looks like she is busy talking to another customer and it really sucks when you can\'t get away. Is there anything else I can bring you?"". We asked for waters... our beers were about half gone when server 2 delivered our appetizers and waters. Our original server was still talking to the same customer. The food was mediocre at best."
Julie J.,Denver  CO,46,21,8,12/1/2014,4.0,Nice atmosphere  good lunch menu with very reasonable prices! Service was good  not to noisy for a large restaurant. We will definitely be back for lunch and dinner as well.
Alycia M.,Aurora  CO,102,17,,12/13/2015,4.0,We come here every once in a while because the food is really really good! The service has never been outstanding but isn't terrible. There are constantly people walking around so they can help with refills and such. The cookie pies are so delicious!
Sunday W.,Denver  CO,276,330,317,9/7/2014,3.0,Ordered Take out! I order the same thing every time I order from BJ's. Cheeseburger and fries. 2 reasons for the 3  instead of 5 stars. The cookie we ordered was very  very thin. I don't like thin  barely cooked chocolate chip cookies. I was expecting way too much and got way too little. Second thing. The kids menu pizza. On the pic  it looked like a yummy deep dish personal pan pizza. Although tasty...looked nothing like the picture. My daughter  who is not too hard to please  was obviously disappointed.Burger was good and they gave me more than enough fries.
David P.,Denver  CO,17,14,8,7/4/2014,3.0,The atmosphere was okay. The waitstaff kind of all hung out at the reception desk though.I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and it was kind of bland. There was next to no seasoning and it was was extremely greasy.I probably wouldn't return again.
Kara C.,Huntingdon Valley  PA,0,14,14,10/21/2015,4.0,This place is great. First of all  I love the giant dining room with all the decor and high ceilings. As far as an atmosphere goes  this place is awesome. The food is incredible  too. We've been here twice now in the month that we've lived in Aurora and this place has come through as a solid dinner choice both times. My boyfriend and i were throughly satisfied with our meals  and I was impressed with the beer selection and the elaborate menu they were displayed on  with a guide to help you pair your meal and beer together perfectly. Our servers both times were very friendly and informative. The only slight complaint I had was that it seemed a little under staffed. The first time we went in was on a Tuesday  so it wasn't that busy and I felt like the service was a little slower than it should have been. All in all I would highly recommend this place to any friend if they are looking for a nice big brewery to go to with great food and drink choices.
Rick G.,Aurora  CO,7,2,,6/29/2015,2.0,Service was slow and took a long time to get our food. Our waitress had no personality. Probably will not be coming back here again
Ash A.,Aurora  CO,1,17,,12/27/2014,5.0,I am slightly biased because my little sister works here  but I am always impressed by this place and have been coming long before she began serving here. The staff at the front is always friendly and helpful  and constantly keeping busy. My sister is of course phenomenal but when she has not been there I have received amazing service from everyone else as well. The food is delicious  and I like that they have different things to try. And of course  the beer is always amazing.
Mike R.,Somerville  NJ,24,224,351,8/23/2012,4.0,Every time I'm in town to visit family  we end up here. On a recent trip  we ended up here twice in two weeks. I love the interior (and usually that stuff does little for me) and ambiance. The beer selection is good and well-presented. Not cheap  but not exorbitant. The menu is similar to TGI Friday's and other pub chains: pizza  burgers  sandwiches  ribs  etc.  but it's not generic. No one thing stands out  but the overall package makes for a pleasant experience.Tell them DRAGON sent you and they won't charge you extra.
Jeff B.,Englewood  CO,59,325,418,6/15/2014,3.0,Ice been to BJs Brewhouse 2x before writing this review. I would describe it as cheesecake factory meets microbrew meets Pizza place. It's good to take the kids and family to a nice dinner. Or do happy hour with friends. I've always had good and friendly service. the food comes up in relatively good time.  They have a nice drink selection.  I'm impressed they have a gf menu. For the money I just don't see anything compelling to brag about. They're consistent and good. 3 star bordering 4
Mike Z.,Mesa  AZ,0,6,,11/25/2015,4.0,Came here a few days back and got a deep dish pizza! Outstanding!! Food has always been great at BJ's!
Dave S.,Aurora  CO,5,43,,5/28/2016,2.0,Nice decor but lousy food. Ordered a club sandwich and a blue cheese burger. The burger was supposed to be medium and I got well well done not a drop of juice tough burger with raw bacon  blue cheese and none of the chipotle sauce. The club had 2 slabs of thick chicken  raw bacon  I mean not even warm  greasy bread and avocado.. We asked that the bacon be re-cooked and it came back uncooked slimy and warm  it took a 3rd time to come out just a little crispy. The waiter was very nice about it but the kitchen was not there. I have had better burgers at good times. Go for the beer but forget the menu.
Jenyfer K.,Aurora  CO,2,104,2,8/1/2015,3.0,Our favorite place for dinner. Everything we have tried is awesome. Love the unique beers. The waiters however have a lot to be desired. Forgetting my drink then our appetizers. Can really ruin the experience
Brian H.,Cincinnati  OH,52,145,86,5/7/2014,5.0,Always great service and outstanding food selection. Wide assortment of hand crafted beers.
Theodore S.,Colorado Springs  CO,41,255,88,5/8/2015,4.0,I like BJ's pizza. They have a good selection of beers to choose from and a great menu for food. The Avocado Egg Rolls are by far the best appetizer they have. I wish they would add the Spinach & Artichoke pizza back to the menu  even though they make it for me anyways. Its their best pizza!
Bill C.,Goodyear  AZ,1,1,,8/12/2015,1.0,Spent over 2 hours for a half cooked meal. Service from kitchen terrible at best. Atmosphere only good thing!
Maria B.,Denver  CO,50,330,116,7/31/2012,4.0,Avocado rolls - fantastic!!! I don't know what's in that dipping sauce  but it's a heavenly combination. I am not a fan of chain restaurant; this establishment will have to be an exception to my rule.
Jay A.,Denver  CO,101,127,272,4/19/2015,1.0,Aurora  Colorado- The menu is huge- 16 pages. Would you believe there is not a single vegan option? I can't believe it. Since everything is pre-made except a salad  I guess I'll go that route hold the meat and cheese. Again. Ugh. Why is this so difficult for the restaurant industry?
Marcia N.,Denver  CO,0,21,,4/14/2016,4.0,Good food  always hot and flavorful. My friends love the burgers at BJ's. I typically go there at lunchtime and never have to wait. It's near the Army base  so lots of military women and men frequent the place  and all customers are typically treated with respect. Sean is a great waiter; the 2nd time I went there he remembered my name from my credit card receipt!
Aldritch H.,Aurora  CO,13,50,4,9/22/2015,3.0,This is our diving spot for dinner. Everything we have tried is superb. I love the unique taste of beer. The waiters are inattentive and not so particular with the details. I'm still going back for some other reasons.
Vicky L.,Golden  CO,90,25,,9/10/2013,1.0,Why this place has any good reviews is beyond me. I have many friends in the food industry and chain restaurants like these have there cooks come early in the morning and cook all the food which most comes from bags and then it sits in a hot drawer tell served. Many don't know this but it grosses me out and really all this place is  is sit down fast food with alcohol. Yuck
Big M.,Fenton  MO,0,7,1,6/29/2015,4.0,They have a good deep dish pizza. The peanut butter  chocolate and ice cream dessert is on point as well!
Sic S.,Aurora  CO,1,24,6,8/12/2015,2.0,This is the place for the yuppie beers with co workers grab a burger place.. The burgers here are pretty good.. The steak was horrible.. Obviously frozen and thawed in hot water. The waitress Nikki was amazing and kept apologizing for the food but she was running her tail off. For a group of 4 dudes pounding drinks that's saying something
Jennifer M.,Aurora  CO,0,6,,3/26/2016,1.0,Have been here a couple of times for happy hour. Will definitely not be returning. They don't really have HH specials (almost $7 for a well drink?!?)  and the staff act completely put out to be serving you. Every time I've been to this BJ's I've been treated incredibly rudely  to the point that some of the wait staff huddled together  pointed toward our table  then mysteriously kept bumping into us as they walked by. Obviously they don't want our business. No problem. There are better places to go  with actual HH specials  and staff who smile!
Coco B.,Denver  CO,105,225,45,1/23/2014,1.0,eh...... if you want under seasoned  and average food for a ridiculous price just stick to olive garden!!!!we ordered parmesan crusted chicken with mash  thai shrimp lettuce wraps  chicken club sandwich and the sampler.needed salt and just flavor in general.what a disapointment
Phung L.,Aurora  CO,119,277,69,1/7/2014,3.0,Been here a couple of times with a group of friends for some beers and appetizers. I thought this place was just ok. The appetizers were just ok nothing special. A tad bit pricey might I add! Definitely not worth the price...We always find ourselves racking up a staggering tab and finding ourselves asking why did we even bother coming here? The place itself looks nice though.
Max C.,Littleton  CO,8,263,303,2/14/2012,4.0,I've not had any real food at the restaurant but the beers at the brewhouse are really nice. The bartender  Tamara  was very helpful  friendly and allowed a tasting of all taps that interested me before committing to one. I did also try the ahi tuna small plate ($3.95) and it was pretty nice with the best hottest wasabi i've ever had! :D I'll have to come back to try the food sometime.Tip: BJ's Jeremiah Red is yummy!
Deb S.,Keenesburg  CO,25,47,5,2/7/2015,4.0,Fun place. Great selection of food. Wait Staff was very good. First time we had been there can't wait to go back to sit on the patio this summer. Prices were reasonable
Katie F.,Denver  CO,874,836,601,11/7/2011,4.0,After a long week at work  I met up with Brittany H for some much needed cocktails and catching up! I arrived still in time for happy hour and thankfully Brittany had snagged us a nice booth in the bar area. This place is HUGE  full of a million beers and has some of the best food there is. We ordered a few appetizers [tuna  eggrolls and chips and salsa!] and were pleased with everything we sampled. Brit raved about their pumpkin beer  which was in fact quite good! I settled on a mojito [strawberry!]  which tasted great! The $1 off for happy hour [cocktails and beer!] made it taste even better.Here is the overall breakdown:The Staff- Super awesome  friendly and accomodating. We stayed in our booth long past happy hour  but did not feel the rush to turn over the table. Our waitress continued to fill our waters  grab new beverages and would check back frequently with us...yay!The atmosphere- Cozy and fun. Depsite it being cold outside  the warm colored walls  big fireplace  and dimmed lighting made for a nice & cozy evening with friends.The food- awesome! everything we sampled  we enjoyed!The prices- a little high  but worth a try...for sure. i even made a rhyme! happy hour is your best bet for cheaper food & drinks.Return?-absolutely :)
Hilary T.,Aurora  CO,31,28,3,10/20/2014,1.0,Unfortunately today was a very disappointing visit. It started out that my husband  who is an AGM at a local 4 star restaurant  my daughter  and myself came in for lunch. We walked in and were eventually greeted by a cranky hostess  when she tried to seat us at a table I apologized for not specifying early but we needed a booth for our young child who does not yet sit well in seats. She was very unaccomodating and was very short about seating us elsewhere. We then ordered our daughters food and drink and our drinks. Our daughter fries and drink did not come  only her entree came. When our sever came back we ordered our appetizers and asked for the rest of what our daughter ordered. She brought back our daughters drinks and our drinks and took our order. After waiting and waiting our food came out. Never our appetizers and the food was brought incorrect. At this point we had been there almost an hour  and nothing had gone well  we hadn't even had a bite to eat. We were both so appalled by the overall worst experience we have ever had and were beyond frustrated we sought out the manager who was eating at a table in the back. My husband tried to explain our frustration  the manager never even put his fork down or attempted to solve anything. We left. Our server decided to come running out of the restaurant and confront us  which is a huge violation. Overall this was the worst experience we have ever had. I wanted to write you so hopefully you can prevent anyone else experiencing such a terrible experience. We will never be visiting this establishment again. Period.
Caleb S.,Denver  CO,1,30,,3/8/2015,2.0,Server checked on us twice the entire meal. Burger was dry. Very few fries to go with the dry burger. Not a good experience.
Mary Jo S.,Denver  CO,318,560,231,12/10/2011,4.0,BJ's in Aurora did not seem like my type of hangout because it is deep in Aurora (too far from home)  it is kind of a sports bar  and I was not crazy about the name. However  the husband's friends invited me to join them for cocktails along with the husband and I wanted to catch up. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised with BJ's whole nine yards. From my pumpkin ale  the apple cider  and the ahi poke to the dark wood walls and inviting atmosphere  BJ's sets a gold standard. In fact  BJ's mission statement has to do with the Gold Standard of Operational Excellence and they are not blowing smoke. The staff was very attentive  knowledgeable  and fun. To wind up  let's revisit the ahi poke. This dish was wonderfully prepared and was almost identical to one of my favorite uptown restaurants except at half the price; I would return just for that dish with a handcrafted brew.
Gayle C.,Honolulu  HI,62,153,144,7/19/2014,4.0,New summer cocktail is the Watermelon Mojito  that was delicious. The service was excellent. Had a group of six with separate checks and the server was able not only to get the orders all sorted correctly but did it efficiently. No automatic gratuity added. Everyone only had praises for their entrees. An wide range of choices from pasta  pizzas  seafood  sandwiches  steaks  wide variety of salads.
Jennifer H.,Aurora  CO,5,40,4,1/10/2015,1.0,Ahi poke appetizer was good. Hostess was short with us and rude. Server didn't check on us much. We both got steak which was a big mistake because we both ordered medium rare steaks and got well done. The sirloin was tough and the consistency was like hamburger meat. The ribeye also sucked and was gross. We waited to see if we could have the steaks sent back but she took so long that we just ate them since we were hungry. Definitely will not be going back.
R S.,Goodland  KS,0,48,34,2/15/2016,5.0,We met family for some drinks and apitizers. We had the pot stickers & lettuce wraps. They were both Amazing. Was very pleased with the waitress and staff. Busy place but they kept up. Good clean place to take your family. Kids are always welcome. They have a good kids menu.
Joe J.,Denver  CO,68,474,93,5/13/2013,4.0,We've actually eaten here twice in the last month and I'm just now getting around to reviewing it. Clearly  if we're stopped in twice  its a good thing! On our first trip in  I had a BBQ chicken salad. This is what I call a salad. Wow  stellar flavors  well presented  and very good size. I can't remember the exact name of the beer I had  but it was a lager (which I prefer) and it scored high marks in my book. On the second trip I had some ribs  which I enjoyed  but probably wouldn't order again. They were a solid 3.5-4 star meal  but if I had to pick between the salad or the ribs  the salad would probably win out. Again  same beer  still can't remember the name. We had potstickers as an appetizer. They were good  but not what I would normally order. I don't think there was a thing wrong with them  but just not what I preferred.Overall though  the price is fair  the food is good  the beer is great  and the atmosphere and ambiance score very high in my book. I'll definitely visit again.
Allison A.,Denver  CO,8,114,17,2/8/2015,5.0,This is a nicer upscale establishment the area needs to have. The food is delicious  a huge selection.
Monte W.,Aurora  CO,10,6,2,7/25/2014,5.0,This is my favorite restaurant of this kind. I have never had a bad meal and love the atmosphere. Pizzas  appetizers  entrees  you can't go wrong. I don't drink so I can't review the beers but they make custom root beer  cream soda  and orange cream. All really good but the root beer is my favorite. Go there and treat yourself. Wrap it up with a p zookie. U won't regret it.
Shabana W.,Denver  CO,53,99,7,1/30/2015,3.0,"Middle of the road food. Drinks over priced. Nothing memorable or notable about this place. Staff is ok.... What you\'d expect for a chain restaurant. Gluten free options are ""ok"".... Last time I came in our server was very nice though."
Anthony K.,Aurora  CO,0,4,,4/10/2015,5.0,The food and beer is great. The service was awesome. First time here and I am not disappointed. Thanks Shane for the excellent customer experience.
Karen M.,Aurora  CO,120,440,50,1/10/2013,3.0,Stopped in to BJ's after a long day of moving. Thank you for letting our scruffy looking selves in to the place!  It will be no surprise to any of you to know that what I like about BJ's is their great beer selection  whether it's their own brews or their vast choices from the cooler. Second  I love their small plates - inexpensive and some nice choices. We tried the deep-fried artichoke hearts and the italian meatballs. The artichokes were cooked perfectly; the meatballs were tender and very filling. They have a huge menu  so if you are looking for a place that will satisfy lots of different tastes  this is a good bet for you.
Chanh S.,Denver  CO,78,157,25,1/20/2013,4.0,I think this is one of the nicest looking breweries/restaurants that I have ever been to. It's a great place for a romantic date night or with a large group of friends. The high ceilings make conversations great and it's not too loud in there. It's not the best for watching a game unless you get a seat by a TV.The pizza was pretty awesome but it's still a far cry from real Chicago deep dish pizza. The beer is pretty good too but I can't really judge it too much since I only had one pint. However  I think I will be going back whenever I'm in the area.Service wasn't that great but I think it's just cuz our waitress sucks but the other staff around us seemed like they were doing a good job. The prices are pretty reasonable too so stop in if you want a nicer than normal brewery with good food.
Natasha A.,Aurora  CO,3,15,,12/4/2013,3.0,"This place has awesome brews and housemade sodas on tap. The food ranges from pretty dang good to ""eh"" depending on what you order.The service is what really brings the rating down. The majority of the time the service here sucks. They are extremely slow at getting to you to take your drink order  bring your drink order  take dinner order  and getting the check to you.  They also aren\'t that great at checking up on you after they\'ve delivered your meal. But sometimes late at night when we are craving appetizers and beer we make our way over here.It\'s worth it for a beer  apps  and a football game."
Danette D.,Denver  CO,8,17,14,12/1/2014,4.0,Went there this weekend for the first time. The food selection is great  they have a variety of food options from sandwiches  pizza  pasta  jambalaya etc. A great place to choose if you have a group that can't decide on one thing. Boyfriend and I started off with the avocado eggrolls  then I had the brewhouse burger for dinner and he had the jambalaya. The avocado eggrolls were great  very flavorful and the sauce with it was tasty. My boyfriends jambalaya was the best  the amount of spices and seasonings they had on it was bomb  a MUST try! I was a bit dissapointed with the burger  for being one of their house specialties I expected more but it was about average. Will definitely be coming back !
S B.,Denver  CO,2,53,,12/10/2012,4.0,I love the beer  and the avocado rolls. I enjoy the ambiance. It's a tad expensive which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Not bad for a chain restaurant.
Black G.,Aurora  CO,0,27,,1/7/2016,3.0,This place has kind of become our fall-back if another place isn't open or something. Great selections and beer. Great atmosphere. Staff....eh depends on who you have. Sometimes they're a disaster. Other times they're great.
Alexis G.,Denver  CO,91,192,29,12/16/2012,4.0,Notice: BJ's will no longer offer half priced appetizers for Tuesday night happy hour. We heard BJ's has a good happy hour (half priced apps)  so my colleagues and I decided to drop by after work. I had the fried calamari which was a little too spicy  but I had no problem cleaning my plate. Our server informed us it was the last night BJ's would offer half priced appetizers for happy hour. From now on  they will offer a couple dollars off appetizers. Bummer.
Kelly H.,Aurora  CO,22,5,,5/2/2014,1.0,Went to have a late dinner the other night. The hours posted say they're open until 11pm. It was 9:45 and they were closed. What gives?
Kris R.,Denver  CO,55,17,,10/14/2014,5.0,First time visit for lunch. Gilbert was an excellent server: attentive  humorous  overall amazing service. My friend and I shared the artichoke stuffed mushrooms  avocado egg rolls  and California club flatbread. I tried the pm porter  which was delicious. Will definitely be back soon!
Rob T.,Morrison  CO,31,166,15,6/21/2013,4.0,The food is good  the beer is good and they have a nice bar area and outdoor patio. It's tough to give a chain 4 stars  but they do everything they advertise well so you can't really knock them.Nice TV collection in the bar area to watch the game and a nice outdoor patio to relax for lunch. You could definitely do worse in this area than BJ's
Matthew H.,Denver  CO,3,75,,12/16/2012,2.0,"Good location in Aurora  at least if you live in Aurora or east Denver.The staff has always been nice when I\'ve gone and it draws a good crowd.The beers are good but nothing special  you know what you are getting  nothing bad but nothing that will bring you back. Kind of like generic versions of what New Belgium offers.The food is disappointing and the portions are small for the price. You would think that the appetizers (wings  chips and salsa  etc...) would be typical bar fare  but they try to put their own spin on bar appetizers and it just comes out... weird. Bar appetizers need to be tasty  some-what filling and also need to soak up a little of the beer that one just had. BJ\'s appetizers don\'t do any of that. Lets face it  most people drive here and then will drive home. I may want to go for that second beer  and I will want a little filling food to ""moderate"" it.I had dinner there once  but I can\'t remember anything from it. I guess that\'s about it."
Sheila C.,Denver  CO,4,25,5,6/21/2014,2.0,Yelp might do better to have separate ratings for food & service. My friend and I came early on this summer Saturday. We simply wanted to have a drink and an appetizer or two. Our waitress took our order promptly but it felt like she was disappointed that we were not having a full meal and started out only ordering one appetizer. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms at the same time as our drinks. Our drinks came promptly and then the small platter of a small amount of mushrooms came. No napkins  no table service. My friend did not want to make a fuss about it. But after eating the mushroom my hands were dripping. I signaled for the waitress who was busy chatting up another employee who alerted her. She sauntered over to the table with a big ol' attitude and plunked down the silverware wrapped in a cloth napkin with what looked like a forced smile. No words. All her communication with us was prefunctory  and in an unfriendly tone. As it was I ordered a second drink and a couple of more appetizers so the bill increased. I tipped her 20% but she would have gotten more if she'd been friendly and done her job properly. The calamari was good and the creamy sauce it came with was tasty. My Margarita was not good. Too much Rose's Lime juice & ?. I may be back - If so I hope for better service.
Li M.,San Antonio  TX,0,16,4,7/12/2015,1.0,"Horrible attitude from manager. I brought a party of 40 with appointment  they ended up do not have enough space for us. No apology or nothing. So several friends had to sit at the bar almost for an hour. Food was very mediocre. Finally customers sitting at the table next to our party left  and I politely asked the manager if we can combine the table so my poor friends could join us. The manager literally yelled at me:"" yeah yeah yeah!!! You already told me before  didn\'t you? Why do you keep asking???"" Then he gave me a dirty look and left. How rude! I just want to remind you they just left and please had somebody clean the table! Considering I just brought you 40 people\'s business! NEVER return or book any events at this hell hole!"
Shanah Z.,Colorado Springs  CO,68,33,43,6/4/2011,4.0,I've dined here a couple of times now. Both times we had a really nice servers. Although both times it took awhile to get our food. They were busy but not a line out the door busy. I wanted to eat here originally because I received an ad in the mail picturing their Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms. On our first visit we ordered them and they are delicious. I also thought they were priced reasonably. Also on my first visit I ordered the Angel Hair Toscana for my entree. It is angel hair pasta tossed with olive oil  garlic  sun-dried tomatoes  red peppers  fresh basil  feta cheese  pine nuts  tomatoes topped with fresh cheese and parsley. It was really delicious and it was great for left overs. We decided to share a Pizookie which is a giant cookie. They have a few different kinds but we went with good ol' chocolate chip. It was also really good. There's nothing like a giant  warm  gooey cookie with ice cream on top. Om nom nom.My second visit I ordered the Balsamic Glazed Chicken. Chicken breasts served over field greens  caramelized onions  white cheddar mashed potatoes  topped with fried onion strings and drizzled with balsamic glaze. The meal was delicious and I loved the onion strings and the balsamic glaze.I will definitely eat here again. Their menu is huge and they have more dishes I would like to try.
Jay D.,Broomfield  CO,13,8,14,5/2/2012,5.0,My visit here didn't start out good. It was my first time at a BJ's and when I sat down and ordered Dr. Pepper... I was told they don't serve Dr. Pepper!!! The humanity!!! How do these places stay in business when they don't serve the nectar of life!?!? (truth be told  I boycott places that don't serve Dr. Pepper--meals just aren't the same without it). So while I was mortified and having to eat good food without good drink  I decided to stay. I had a gift card. ...otherwise I literally might have walked out.So why five stars??? Read on.My burger came out with avocado only on half so I wasn't too pleased with that either. But no big deal  they can bring me more avocado.The manager came around to each table  asking how things were. When he got to me I gave a little smile and said things were okay.This manager could read through my fake smile  however  and asked what he could do to make it better. I told him there was nothing he could do  just that I was greatly disappointed they didn't serve Dr. Pepper. He apologized but eventually moved away.Literally 5 minutes later he showed back up at my table with a cold bottle of Dr. pepper on a tray!!! FREE of charge! HE LITERALLY WENT ACROSS THE STREET TO THE GAS STATION AND BOUGHT ME ONE!!!WOW... that's customer service. I was ready to write a mediocre review and never go back... but how can I not give the management the props they deserve? They know how to please their customers.He did mention that they would start carrying Dr. Pepper about two weeks later. I haven't been back yet to find out. But I likely will. Good service brings repeat customers.So I'm HIGHLY recommending BJ's but I'm MORE specifically recommending THIS specific BJ's in Aurora  CO for obvious reasons.
Michelle D.,Denver  CO,0,8,,1/4/2015,2.0,I ordered the garlic parmesean wings  what came out was half garlic parm and half buffalo style so I sent them back. What then came out was the same garlic parm wings (now cold) and the same buffalo wings with the buffalo sauce rinsed off and garlic parm sauce applied. That is piss poor. 2 stars for the beer.
Sheila G.,Aurora  CO,2,4,4,9/17/2013,4.0,The service was decent and the food was great!! I went with burger melt with bacon very tasty!!
Angie L.,Aurora  CO,0,6,,12/30/2015,4.0,I have always enjoyed the atmosphere provided at this restaurant whether it be for a sports game or dinner with friends and family. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Food is amazing as well!
Ashlee H.,Aurora  CO,37,55,3,6/19/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I reviewed BJ's back in March and gave 3 stars - Today  we picked up lunch to-go and brought back to my client's office. My salad was super - a new grilled chicken/Thai/mango salad. It was simply fabulous. I just wish the service was better...They told me it would take 20 minutes - I arrived probably arrived 30 minutes after I called and it still wasn't ready. I waited another 5 minutes at the to-go counter before someone told me it would be a minute. I find that incredibly annoying.Great food today  but PLEASE improve on service.
Carla H.,Aurora  CO,0,32,,11/15/2014,4.0,Okay  I'll make this short and sweet. Go during happy hour....yummy food and good priced drinks. Their pizza dip is ahhhhh-mazing  or if you want something lighter-they're salads are great too. However  nothing compares to their pazookies! Get one. Don't think just do!!!!
Jessica S.,Denver  CO,0,35,,11/6/2014,3.0,This place is meh. The food is okay  but pretty pricey for the quality and the quantity. The beer fits into the same category as the food; okay but pricey for what it is.
Tyler S.,Denver  CO,193,257,113,1/3/2012,4.0,Located by the Aurora mall on the east side of town  BJs brewhouse is where it's at. I recently took my pops here for lunch yesterday and I'm glad I did.BJ's has quite an expansive menu. Ranging from some of the most delicious pizzas I have eaten to their sandwiches  salads  and pasta. I am always impressed with the size of their menu and the array of foods geared towards pleasing everyone in your group. I usually order a pizza every time I come to BJ's - half buffalo chicken and half great white. The buffalo chicken side is always fantastic! They add freshly chopped red onions  chives and white chicken to the buffalo style sauce and then drizzle it with fresh house-made ranch (not the most healthiest  but it is sure tasty). The great white side is an alfredo based-sauce (again not the most healthy I know)  with chicken  fresh garlic  and a bruchetta-style tomato. The crust is the best part - it is served deep dish and is thick and moist and delicious!Yesterday  however  I ordered their all you can eat soup and salad combo - and so did my dad. For the salad  went with a boring caesar salad light on dressing and for the soup I went with the chicken tortilla. The salad was pretty ordinary  nothing super special about it  but the soup was incredible! It came in a separate container that our waitress poured into our bowl around some crunchy tortilla strips  tomatoes  and freshly chopped avocado. The avocado in the soup was a nice touch!All-in-all  BJ's Brewhouse is a great place to check out (especially if you have some picky eaters in your crowd and you want to please everyone). Their beers are also great - I didn't order any yesterday  but they are always up to par with what meets your style or craving. They also have another location up north off of 104th by the Promenade Shops and movie theatre if you are on that side of town. Enjoy!
Dave S.,Frisco  TX,1,37,264,1/19/2011,5.0,"Excellent weekday  lunchtime visit to this chain\'s location. I\'ve been to about five different BJ\'s locations over the years; this one was on par -- no better or worse than the other locations. ""Same everything"" in terms of beer and food choices. The day we visited we had decent service and the food was great.My two teenage daughter\'s were very happy with their choices (pizza and chicken parmesan) while I had unlimited soup and salad. They had a specialty beer on tap (their Grand Cru) that was really excellent; I\'m a huge beer geek and hophead. IMO the Grand Cru needed more coriander notes to be on-style but now I\'m being picky. :-)Beer selection good; I do like that this chain provides guest taps for more choices.Our visit was in the winter so we did not sit outside; however  their patio looks to be quite awesome (and large) for summertime outings."
Charlie M.,Skiatook  OK,0,10,35,7/5/2014,4.0,I had the house top sirloin maybe one of the best steaks I've had in a while. Topped off with there great beer selections it's a can't miss.
Wayne W.,San Pedro  CA,6,166,75,10/12/2012,4.0,Large variety of food and beer. I had the Jambelia and my wife had the pulled pork sandwich.  Both were very good. Returned on the way back to LA.Waiter worked with me to merge the ingedients of two of their salads; each had good elements but needed something from the other to be complete. Came out great.Large restrurant with long bar  plenty of sport screens  lots of windows  wood and brass. Kept the sound on the sports down so it was not dominant (unless you were at the bar).Good servicer but somewhat forgetful.Hot cookie desert with ice cream is a nice touch; rich but good.
Brittany H.,Denver  CO,408,454,112,10/6/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I salivate at the thought of BJ's Oktoberfest and Pumpkin beers.Go get them. For realz.
Jason S.,Ronda  NC,63,50,1,3/20/2012,4.0,BJ's is basically a more blue collar Cheesecake Factory.Oreo Pizookie is great  my wife highly recommends the Angel Hair Toscana.
Mike C.,Aurora  CO,6,11,,5/29/2014,3.0,The great white pizza is bomb along with the clam chowder bowl. The food is overly priced and the service is mediocre as well.
Allison S.,Arvada  CO,89,59,27,8/31/2012,4.0,A friend and I came here on a whim. I wanted pasta  she didn't care too much and just wanted food. They have a pretty big menu that has a bunch of choices on it. Our waiter was pretty good and helped me in making a decision on what to get. The food was good. Nothing spectacular  but better than Applebees...I'll def go back...
Bruce K.,Charlotte  NC,1400,8336,16195,8/17/2009,4.0,"Great (strong) beer and great service  I had to visit TWICE today - once for lunch (without the beer) and then after work  where I enjoyed two. BJ\'s reminds me strongly of Karl Strauss Brewery  a very similar California-based microbrewery/restaurant with the same sort of formula and I think very similar offerings. At lunch  I enjoyed their lunch sized Cobb salad (pre-tossed) with what was billed as a ""large"" bowl of Tuscan tomato soup that was a little on the small side. Both tasted excellent  but I left hungry. Great service.Returning for dinner  the little man on my right shoulder pointed his pitchfork at me and I had no choice but to order the open-faced chili cheese burger  which was more food than a human should be allowed to eat in one sitting. A half pound burger with a generous service of chili and cheese on top of a burger bun with a massive pile of fries (your choice: thin or wedge cut). I was barely able to eat the burger and chili  leaving both bun halves and three fourths of the (delicious) fries. While downing this monster portion of food  I partook of one pint of their hefeweisen and one pint of blonde  which I swear must be stronger than we usually get back in Charlotte.My dinner waitress was attentive and seemed to understand the pace of the meal I was enjoying  stopping by at appropriate times to check on me. I was very pleased with her service. The same for lunch.The walls all have TV\'s on them  especially the very large one over the bar. A perfect place for me to catch tonight\'s Monday Night Football (pre-season) game. Go Panthers! Overall  an excellent choice and I am very glad that I returned. Good value for money  too!"
Allison O.,Denver  CO,11,38,1,6/11/2014,3.0,This is a good choice for the area and if you are looking for a variety of options for your group. I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants  but this one is pretty good overall. Service was also good and our food/drinks were served quickly. A good choice if you are near the Aurora mall.
Tomas L.,Norwalk  CA,16,37,2,6/23/2015,1.0,Took 20 minutes to be seated  after being seated took 15 minutes to be served and the waiter rushed us. Not happy and will be calling corporate. Oh and 2 female managers were standing around laughing and joking it up. Pretty pathetic for a food establishment.
Sarah S.,Denver  CO,18,19,,7/17/2014,4.0,I really enjoyed coming here! Their drinks are amazing  the berry cider was my favorite drink. And their artichoke stuffed mushrooms were to die for! :) The food was alright and the service was decent  could have been better. But the environment was great  the patio at night with the heaters are amazing. :) and the cookie and cream pazookies (cookies and ice cream) are amazing !!!
Michele M.,Parker  CO,0,15,,7/11/2015,5.0,We had a great experience. Service was fantastic. We went at 2:30 in the afternoon and are servicer  Shane  was attentive and timely. We had the honey shiracah brussel sprouts as an appetizer and loved it. Our entrees included their pasta  pizza  kale salad  and Mac n cheese. Everyone enjoyed their meal. I must say  the mac n cheese was a bit runny  but good. We finished with a pizookie. Yum!! We'd definitely return.
Amanda W.,Denver  CO,0,7,,7/5/2015,2.0,"Went to this restaurant for the second time. First time was a great experience. This time  not so much. It all started when we were greeted when we walked in. We told the host we had 7 people. She looked at me like ""really how are we to accommodate that"" she gave us the look like it was a hassle to put two tables together. After we sat down it took 10 minutes for the server to get to us. He got our drink order and then brought us back the drinks. He placed an appetizer order and then didn\'t return to our table for another 20 min. He checked our drinks  but didn\'t take our meal order. We ordered after being there 45 min already. When we received our food  the wrong dish came out. He forgot to bring our drink refills more then once and was way slow when returning to our table. The service was horrible and extremely slow. The restaurant was not busy either. We were there for almost 2 hours. I will not return to this restaurant."
Allison F.,Aurora  CO,91,422,49,4/12/2012,4.0,Came here for lunch on Monday. We were quickly seated and it looks like a popular place for business groups. We enjoyed that the seating was a fair distance from each other so you got a more private dining experience. Even though there were only a few tables occupied  it was still fairly noisy.The menu is indeed huge for both drinks and food. I had the berry cider that is made in house and it's a nice change up from your traditional apple. We had a hard time making choices with the food menu and it might actually be too large. I finally decided on the california burger  my husband had the potato skins  and my friend had the fried artichokes  mac and cheese  and tomato and mozzerella salad from the 'small plates' section. My burger was served on thick texas toast and I liked the addition of the green chilis and the avocado. It was quite a heavy burger and kept me full for the rest of the day/evening. My husband was served 10 potato skins  which were enough to feed him for lunch and dinner. And the little plates my friend got were all very good. I had an artichoke and it was delicious. The mac and cheese was enjoyed  though the tomato salad was too salty.Overall  we had a good visit here. Their patio is huge and looks like an ideal place to be on a sunny day. We've tried to come here for dinner on a weekend and the lineups get to be huge. Either arrive early or see if you can make a reservation.
John Y.,Chicago  IL,354,30,,4/14/2011,4.0,Person at the Company recommended BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse  and we went there on a Wednesday night. Hockey playoffs just started  and thankfully the place had Versus. We were considering going to Dry Dock Brewery  but that place does not have the hockey channel package or even the Versus channel! I ordered the Piranha Beer  Chicken Potstickers and the New Orleans Jumbalaya. The beer pairing with the Jumbalaya was recommended by the waitress  and it worked well together.If I am back in Denver  I will definitely come back to this place. The menu is extensive  so I am looking forward to trying something new.
Jeff R.,Colorado Springs  CO,0,3,,6/12/2014,5.0,This was my first visit and I was blown away! They have a huge menu so all my buddies could find something to eat. Lindsay our server was attentive and educated on the 16 page menu. Try the Nutty Brunette. The managers were out talking to people and making us feel welcome. Even after along day of construction.
Missy M.,Westminster  CO,40,27,,4/18/2014,2.0,we come here for happy hour sometimes  they have a good menu  but the service is pretty mediocre. Last time several people's orders were wrong and they didn't do anything to correct it. The food is ok  nothing special.
Christina F.,Durango  CO,4,34,6,4/30/2013,3.0,"Ugh....I really hate giving places less than 4 stars....but I think I am a little biased....in fact  3 stars is likely too generous for this experience but luckily I rarely rate less than 3 stars. I know the restaurant business is tough -- so 3 for me is the lowest I can typically go. First  I worked at a BJ\'s in college so I know the system.....I was SHOCKED at how poor the service was at this location. Awful....just awful!  First  we were greeted nicely and sat promptly...but after this it all went downhill FAST....well  slowly.....! We were not greeted or even acknowledged by a server/greeter for at least 10 minutes (and that\'s after we had been sitting for a bit and decided to see how long it would take to get a shout out and taking note of the time on our clocks.....). It would be important to also note that after this ridiculous wait (10 plus minutes) my Husband finally got up and politely asked the hostess what was going on....just a water at the point would have been welcomed. After about 5 minutes after that we finally got a less than interested waitress. She didn\'t apologize at all and HAD to have known we were irritated -- Im certain I had it written all over my face. It\'s just so rude. BUT  I believe in being polite so I pulled it together and treated her nicely. The other thing that really rubbed me the wrong was was that during this period of LONG waiting... I saw the Manager (maybe 2 of them -- I can\'t be certain)....stroll (and by stroll I mean slllooooowly work their way to the other side of the restaurant -- clearly they didn\'t want to be there either so I can see why the service sucks so bad) past our table more than a few times. Did they not notice we were sitting there FOREVER without even a greet or drink order (I know they know this....the coaster on the table after a first greet is a great indicator). Clearly even management didn\'t care.... As a restaurant manager I certainly notice these things when I\'m on the job....or even a customers staring eye? Nope....not these guys! WOW!  We ordered a lot of food for old times sake -- things we missed and had to try during our visit to the city. The food of course was good...but the service and lack of care really took all ""longing"" for the food away! I was pretty disgusted to be treated so poorly on what seemed to be a slower day. Now  in all honesty...it was a Sunday and I KNOW the Sunday crowd can be rough -- but seriously -- get it together!We left a 20% tip -- I\'m not sure why -- I regret it  but again...I always have a soft spot when it comes to this because I have spent so much time in the industry. What a sucker! We won\'t be back....there are WAY too many options to choose from to decide on a place with such hideous service all the way around. No thank you! I wonder why corporate hasn\'t come to straighten this store out -- shocking!"
Patrick Y.,Denver  CO,36,40,,4/2/2012,4.0,Huge selection for food and beers and everything else. A good play with different variety of ingredients. The first time I went  I got there California Burger and the big seller for me was the sourdough. It was not on your traditional hamburger bun. The second I went  I got a mini pizza with portobello mushrooms and balsamic vinegar. I never had a pizza with portobello mushrooms.I like the art work on the walls. Mostly funny pictures of the old paintings.
Marshall C.,Newman  CA,0,41,14,1/24/2014,4.0,Haven't been to BJs in a few years. First time at this one  and I'd go back. Amanda was our attentive server. The lunch specials are a great deal for decent food. I really enjoyed their brews too.
Brandon J.,Cherry Hills Village  CO,0,37,1,4/5/2014,4.0,The food is delicious. a semi boogie kind of restaurant - the food is rather expensive. The wait staff is not fantastic and is often rude. However  the best part of this restaurant is the pizookie. Save room for this fantastic dessert....it is an incredible cookie  baked to perfection and topped with delicious ice cream.
J V.,Orange  CA,52,23,9,1/15/2015,1.0,Visited this BJ's while in Colorado for business with my son. Staff at the reception area were polite but more interested in talking to each other than greeting customers. Server seemed hurried and unfriendly. Steak was a high quality piece of beef ruined by the chef who must never taste anything he/she cooks--extremely salty as was the asparagus. My son's fish and chips was delivered to the table minus chips. Had to remind the server the meal was incomplete. The fish was over cooked rendering it tasteless. Not worth $48.
Fred D.,Aurora  CO,0,23,,9/16/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,We just ate there and the food was perfect as always. Shaina is really fun to watch because she gets every drink in the place and still serves food to the people at the bar and makes it look easy. She is always very sweet to my wife and I. This place has moved up to be one of my favorites.
Janet S.,Denver  CO,2,8,,3/23/2014,5.0,Pizza was amazing! We had a pepperoni and pineapple deep dish! After an Oreo cookie w ice cream! I think what made it even better was out service! Jerome was so nice  attentive and personable! It was A+ service with wonderful food! I wish every dining experience was like this!
Frederick S.,Denver  CO,1,19,,10/17/2010,4.0,Beer and good food. What could be better  right? BJ's Brewhouse features their own brews on tap  much like many other brew pubs. What makes them different is that they feature many other beers from around the world...which I think makes them unique. You want a Belgian? No problem. English Stout? Yep. Plus their own brews are darned good too.The menu here is extensive. Apps are interesting and different...like the avocado egg rolls. Really unique and really good. Pizzas are really loaded. Burgers are good. Been here many times  never leave hungry...always leave happy.
Michael W.,Aurora  CO,65,238,18,9/12/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Won't be going here again. Only upside on this visit was the beer. I was there with a going away party and another large gathering totally took over the entire area. No one told them to quiet down or stay within there seats  it was annoying. Then when I needed to jet to pick up my daughter the bartender was a total a-hole about helping me close out my one beer bill. This confirms my long held belief that jerks are hired here often. If they treat there customers like that  I wonder how they really treat your food.
Sean DeMarco G.,Aurora  CO,58,21,13,12/22/2012,3.0,Not a bad place. Their menu is waaay too big. When you eat at a restaurant you generally want to order what they're known for. (In this case  beer & pizza). any place that shows they make everything means they don't specialize in one great dish. Just a bunch of average stuff. My advice? Cut the 6-7 page menu and concentrate on what you do best. (again  beer & pizza).
Shannon S.,Denver  CO,0,17,,1/19/2014,2.0,The drinks were excellent. The beer and mojitos were awesome. Otherwise they would have gotten 1 star. Service was poor. The waiter messed up my order twice. And after I gave up and just ate what I got  it wasn't very good. There were 2 of us and he gave my drink and my food to my friend and visa versa. Not hard to give the right stuff to the guest when there are only 2 people. We had to flag him down to ask for stuff. He was friendly enough at least. I've eaten at other the Westminster location and that was significantly better.
Dwayne F.,Littleton  CO,0,5,1,1/10/2015,1.0,"Ridiculously poor service tonight. The server\'s face said  ""I don\'t want to be here or serve you"". 15 minutes for her to get to the table. And I had to ask for her....15 more to get a drink. ..side salad completely forgotten. Had the nerve to ask if I still wanted it....never again."
Keith B.,Littleton  CO,0,6,,3/18/2013,1.0,Wow....what a horrible evening!!! We arrived and were seated promptly and that's the only good thing I can say about BJ's. After we were seated we were given menus and the waitress told us she'd be right back. 20 minutes later she came back and took our drink order and another 20 minutes after that the drinks finally arrived. I should mention that we asked for water when we were first seated and that never got to the table. Anyway  we finally flagged done our waitress and told her we wanted to order some food and she told me that we would have to wait a couple minutes for her to return. After 25 minutes she finally showed back up but at that point I was so pissed we decided to leave. Maybe a good place with a different server but I won't be going back to find out.
Jeff K.,Saddle River  NJ,324,302,33,7/30/2010,4.0,I had very good experience with the BJ's Brewhouse in Cerritos  CA. I was pleasantly surprised to find one in the denver area. The brewhouse wasn't special  but it didn't disappoint either.The food was good. I had the miso salmon this time  and it was done just right.The beer was also very nice. Instead of the red  I stuck to the stout this time. I am still hoping that we get a brew pub of this caliber or better in our area. Is that really too much to ask?
Doctor G.,Alameda County  CA,0,1712,1,9/14/2011,3.0,This BJ's looks almost identical to the BJ's I ate at about 1000 miles away. A sports bar concept here. Food was decent  and the service was very good. No complaints here. It's a bit pricey  but food quality is consistent.
Sarah S.,Aurora  CO,31,11,2,11/10/2014,2.0,"I have come twice for the unlimited soup and salad lunch special. The salad is good. The soups are also good with a decent selection. Service was extremely slow both times. I believe""unlimited refills"" depends on how many times you\'re willing to wait 25-30 minutes for your server to return. Overall  the food was a good value but I may reconsider returning unless I have a long time for lunch."
Jaxon K.,Englewood  CO,1,48,,1/28/2013,2.0,Like the room and location. But the meals have always failed me. I have gotten pizza and a burger here. They were both very average. I will stick with the apps and the beer next time. They have been decent. I also had a root beer there that was pretty not good. But I may have been expecting more from a brewhouse. Shame on me  maybe.
Leonard E.,Mobile  AL,27,116,,5/19/2013,3.0,Great place/environment and friendly staff. Great micro beer selection and taste. I had the blond. I had the bacon cheeseburger to eat. It wasn't the best burger I've ever had  but the taste was acceptable and I didn't feel to guilty after eating it. It wasn't greasy at all. The fries are good. It's a great place to hang out.
Beth F.,Boulder  CO,63,117,20,5/31/2012,1.0,We sat at a table for 15 min with no server and no water. We ended up leaving. Totally ridiculous.
Aja T.,Denver  CO,3,7,,7/26/2013,3.0,The clam chowder and fried artichokes are my go to when I eat here. I've tried a few other things (santa fe rolls  pizza  salad) but they aren't as good as my faves. With that said its worth a visit especially during the lunch hours.
Annie B.,Aurora  CO,224,265,259,5/2/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,This place is definitely inconsistent.  I've had some pretty good meals here and I've had some not so good meals here. Today  was not so good. Our waitress  I think her name was Erin  was bad. She showed up to take our order  brought our salad and that was about it.The salad was disgusting. The lettuce was pink  brown and wilted. How could the cook in the kitchen plate that dish and how could a server let that plate leave the line in the condition it was in? The management here should be embarrassed.We split the appetizer sampler. It was alright. Not fantastic  but not horrible. It was just  meh. The artichoke dip tasted like it was a few days old  sauce from the egg rolls had spilled out of the ramekin and on to the plate and the chips were over salted. It was just very sloppy. The fact that the appetizer sampler was OK and not horrible saved this review from being only rated with one star. I also asked for a water when we got our salad and never got one. I had to wave to a different waitress to get a glass of water.I hope the management at BJ's reads this and sees that there are issues that need to be addressed. You should be ashamed of yourselves.
Rachel M.,Englewood  CO,109,174,22,3/25/2011,4.0,It isn't often I so savor the words tomato and bisque together.Met a friend here for dinner this eve and had a very pleasant and quality dinner.Friday night at this location wasn't a problem for seating  plus the two of us got a cool round booth which reminded us of teacup amusement park rides. But I digress...My frozen cocktail  some peach-titled concoction  was delightful and gorgeous.The tomato bisque soup I opted for with my entree was probably my favorite portion of the entire experience. It was thick  creamy  tasted to perfection and warmed me right down to my toes.My entree was the grilled pork chops which was a great choice for what I wanted - something that didn't feel heavy and ventured more toward the health side of things. The sweet apples with the mashed potatoes and pork chops were a perfect combination  along with the side of green beans.Dessert? Lawdy lawd. I ordered two items to bring home to the kids: some berry bramble delightful assortment and the fudge brownie. Both were rich  decadent and entirely sinful.The ambience was nicer than a grill restaurant for sure  and kind of tended toward a darker version of a Cheesecake Factory. I'm sure the majority of the patrons were also in huge favor of the giant screens displaying college basketball for their brackets.
Mike H.,Aurora  CO,41,50,,10/21/2010,5.0,"I highly recommend this place. The food portions are large and very good. My favorites are the French Dip and the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. For dessert they have ""pizookies""  which are warm cookies with ice cream--you have to try one! The beers are good. I have especially enjoyed the pumpkin beer.Try BJs--its not your typical brewery."
Brigette E.,Aurora  CO,28,10,1,8/17/2013,5.0,Such a grey menu  so much to chose from. I recommend parmesan crusted chicken and the pizookie!
Nikki K.,Castle Rock  CO,1,12,,2/12/2014,1.0,Normally a great place that has had very bad service. Their service got better until today. My family are regulars an we go there all the time  an we have always looked past the bad service. Today we ordered food that was wrong on two meals! Mistakes that contradicted their own menu! But the manager Randy shocked me when she insisted on arguing about things that were wrong on the order an kept arguing! Talk about bad management she needs classes in costumer service training again. Very disappointed in the restaurant an management.
Love L.,Pacific Grove  CA,0,20,,8/23/2014,5.0,"This was our last ditch effort to find something good for dinner while traveling through Denver. All the restaurants near our hotel were either fast food or had bad reviews. We chose this place on a whim  and did take out. It was delicious  fresh  and fast! I even ordered off the ""lower calorie menu"" which are usually notoriously bad  but the Mediterranean chicken tacos were so good  not to mention vegetable heavy. Would absolutely order from here again!"
Ryan G.,Denver  CO,8,11,1,12/10/2009,4.0,Last night was my first trip to BJ's and one of the few times I've ventured out of Cap Hill for a night out in awhile! The Christmas gathering of friends seemed like the perfect occasion for a place such as BJ's and it didn't disappoint. The decor is modern and the space quite expansive - presumably  because the brewery is in the back and the operations require some serious ceiling room. I'll agree with others that the food is probably a bit overpriced in relation to the overall quality  but it's far from a deal breaker. We enjoyed the pizza  which had a very doughy crust and large tomato chunks over the entirety of it - this seemed to be the case on the all the pies I saw rolling past. The mushrooms and artichoke hearts were fresh and all the elements seemed of pretty good quality. Originally being from Chicago  I'm kind of particular about my pizza  but this was tasty stuff and relatively unique. On to the beers  which is the most important part of the equation at any place professing to be a brewery. They obviously had their own brews on tap (a pale ale  porter  stout  hefeweizen  and some seasonals)  but they also had a GREAT selection from Colorado breweries. Left Hand  Oskar Blues  Tommyknocker  and Boulder Beer were all represented behind the bar! I opted for BJ's own Piranha Pale to get started and enjoyed it. Very drinkable  if not spectacular  but it didn't try to be anything it wasn't. From there I had a Dale's (Oskar Blues)  which is my local favorite and hard to ever pass up from the tap. With my meal  I had BJ's porter which was tasty and fit well with the frigid weather we were dealing with. Our service was lacking in attentiveness for a group of nearly ten people  but he was a nice enough guy and the hostess did a great job of getting us taken care of and accommodating a couple kids in the group. Check it out if you're in the Aurora Mall area!
Brady K.,Denver  CO,69,278,30,5/6/2012,4.0,I use to live around this place and have frequented BJ's often. I was in the neighborhood and knew it would be a solid bet. For those who have never been  know that BJ's has great beers! I recently found out that they have DRY DOCK BREWERY'S VANILLA PORTER on tap!!!!! If you are a beer fan  get the taster set. The ambiance is great and it would be a good place to take a date or a crowd you want to impress and the consistency factor with service and food is on point. As far as the food they try and do a little spin on the traditional bar food  but all in all  it is still the standard bar food. BJ's gets 4 stars because of the beer selection  great service  and great atmosphere.
Kristin W.,Aurora  CO,134,42,9,4/24/2011,5.0,Huge fan of this place. I love breweries anyway  so I was super excited to go to another one. I had a berry beer that was absolutely fantastic...the kind of beer that you can easily drink too much of because it was THAT tasty. The food was AWESOME  with enormous portions. I ordered a caesar side salad just because I love salad as an appetizer  and I swear I could have just eaten that by itself! The plate was huge! I then had a barbeque chicken pizza. It was very tasty. It was a little small (I got the individual sized one)  but with my huge salad  I didn't need much more. The staff is also very nice and accommodating. We were there for a friends' birthday  and we brought a cake with us  which they held in the back in the fridge until dessert time. Then they brought it out  candles lit and all! They didn't even moan and complain when we stayed extra long to chat and have a few drinks with the birthday boy. I definitely recommend BJ's. Great place  great food. Huge venue  too  so plenty of seating room even on busy nights.
Erin B.,Denver  CO,26,23,,1/28/2013,4.0,"This is our go-to ""want to grab a quick bite to eat"" spot. The food is consistently decent  the staff is friendly  and you pretty much know what you\'re going to get. None of the food is unbelievable  but all of it is great for the price."
Joanne P.,Denver  CO,36,24,3,7/15/2014,4.0,Brew pub Pork Chops good! Angel hair pasta pretty tasteless. They do have glutrn free items including pizza.
Erica R.,Aurora  CO,0,56,1,8/30/2013,4.0,A few minor issues of food not being completely correct but they fixed it instantly and their clam chowder keeps bringing me back for more. I love their soup and salad lunch.
Joelle Z.,Uptown  Oakland  CA,29,13,,7/1/2014,1.0,Horrible experience today. Service was slow. When food arrived asked two servers for Parmesan cheese and red chili peppers. One Server said ok and never returned. The other came back with the cheese said he would be back with the chilies. No return. Finally the person who took our order returned. She went to the back and brought me the chilies. Only bad thing now- the food is cold. I guess I can eat my lunch for dinner. Ugh
Marci A.,Denver  CO,0,6,,4/3/2015,1.0,"I\'ve only set foot into this place twice and that was enough for me to know that I\'ll never be back. The first time I went it was the first beautiful sunny day of Spring and my boyfriend and I wanted to sit on the patio and enjoy the sunshine. Well  the hostesses made a fuss about sitting us on the patio for some reason and when they finally took us out there they put us at a table in the shade so I asked nicely if we could sit in the sun. ""Ugh  let me grab my towel... again "" said the hostess. Our waitress was nice  thank goodness  but the hostesses  not so much. The second time  my mom was visiting from Georgia and we were in the area and decided to have a beer on the patio. Another beautiful sunny day and we saw people sitting on the patio so we asked the hostess if we could sit outside. ""The patio is closed."" she said to us  even though it was a gorgeous day and there were people already sitting out there. I informed her that there were people sitting there and that they were losing business by not opening the outside on a 80 degree day. We weren\'t about to waste such a gorgeous day so we obviously went somewhere else. Advice to the owner  open the patio or tell your hostesses to lose the attitude. If a customer wants to sit at a certain table or a certain part of the restaurant  accommodate them. They will continue to give you business. As for me  you can find me enjoying a sunny patio at a restaurant who actually wants my business."
D F.,Aurora  CO,0,79,3,7/25/2012,1.0,An associate of mine and I went into BJ's in hopes to get some work done and have a few pints. We found out there was no WIFI provided for the customers  too bad it was after we ordered a round of beers. We quickly drank the beer and tabbed out. Chips and salsa  two beers for $21? Seriously $6.95 for a pint of your crappy Hefewizen? No thanks  never again. And why does this location call themselves a brewhouse? They don't brew beer here? Too many great places in Aurora who do the brewing onsite and provide FREE WIFI.
Na P.,Thornton  CO,5,22,,4/2/2012,1.0,We went in at almost 10pm last Saturday night. There were some patrons there but it was far from being busy. Our drinks came out pretty fast. It took a while for us to place our food order. But when we did  we ordered stuffed mushrooms and fried artichoke hearts to start  and then added a pizza to share. I asked for a straw for my drink and never received it. Our appetizers came out pretty fast (it was delivered by another waitress). Not shortly after our pizza arrived  however  it was warm but with a place known for their pizzas  this should have been pipin' hot. This is not the reason why I'm giving this place 1 star.Reason for the 1 star - The lack of customer service  not only to us but everyone in her section. It was a night full of waiting - from ordering our food to getting our take out boxes  to receiving our tab and to processing our payment. Apparently she waited until all of her tables needed/requested boxes so that she can go get them ALL at once. The same happened when we wanted our tabs  she went to grab the tabs ALL at once and then she processed the payments ALL at the same time. It was so bad that one guy walked around the entire place looking for her! Basically we got everything at her convenience. Ridiculous service!
Max S.,San Diego  CA,16,130,13,6/5/2012,2.0,Meh. Waited 5 minutes at the take-out counter with no service. No one else waiting  not busy. No acknowledgement or apology for me having waited so long for service. The girl at the counter had to go to the adding machine to figure out my change  and she still got it wrong. Left with my take-out order  and got home to realize my salad had been left out of the bag. Overall a disappointing experience.
Hymae W.,San Jose  CA,19,391,117,9/18/2012,4.0,Order the Jambalaya here and it was excellent. Very spicy and a huge serving. I couldn't fish it all because i thought i was going to sweat myself to death. I also had their stout and it was excellent.
Chelsea M.,Denver  CO,29,5,,9/8/2011,2.0,"It hurts me to only give BJ\'s 2 stars because I do love this restaurant. I used to go to the one in Boulder and I would give them 5 stars easily. I have been to the Aurora BJ\'s 3 times in the past 5 months and each time I\'ve had a couple issues. First of all  every time it has taken way too long especially since they weren\'t that busy. Twice  I have sat on the patio and basically been annoyed. Last week we were sitting out there and the server seemed put out that he had to come around to the back. If the patio is open  we are allowed to sit there. It is not our fault if our table is away from your other ones (mind you  there were 3 other parties sitting back there). The time we sat inside  we had a very sweet  young girl who struggled a little but we\'ve all had first jobs so it wasn\'t a big deal. I ordered a side Caesar that never came  but she took it off the bill right away and was extremely apologetic. This last time my Caesar salad arrived before our drinks or waters got there (I figured it was just my Caesar from the last visit that has been all ready and waiting for me to come back) but without the appetizer that our friends ordered. Then when the waiter came around to bring our cocktails (yes  the waters and our friends\' 2 beers arrived and then 10 mins later our cocktails arrived)  I asked if I could have some more water. His response was  ""if I ever get a second  I\'ll try to bring you your water"" with a snippy tone as if I had asked 30 times already. My friends thought it was pretty funny since I looked like I had gotten slapped in the face  I was so surprised by his response. Our pizza (for 2 of us)  a sandwich and gumbo arrived  however  there were only 2 sets of silverware for the whole table. The food deliverer (not our waiter) brought the pizza without individual plates or a stand to put the pizza on  she plopped it down in front of my boyfriend and said ""hang on a second"". Our waiter came by and said  ""Oh yeah  sorry  I would have brought you plates but I was too busy."" On his way back in  our friend asked for ketchup (she had fries  it didn\'t seem like an unreasonable request) and he audibly sighed before continuing inside. If anyone has been keeping track  at this point we are still short an order of potstickers. We received them about 30 seconds before we got the bill. He did take off the potstickers and put them in a to-go box so all\'s well that ends well.All in all  I still love BJ\'s  I will still continue going there  this location just needs to get their stuff together. Management  please speed up the service and apologize to the wait staff from me for asking them to do what they get paid to do!"
Randall S.,Aurora  CO,139,104,20,6/19/2012,3.0,Decent food and not overly priced. I know one of the Kitchen Managers so we stop in every now and then. LOVE the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. We've had the apps and the majority are decent  typical fare. Service can be so-so but we've never had to wait for a table even when they are super busy.
Raine B.,Cedar Park  TX,137,30,39,6/1/2011,3.0,We go to BJ's a lot because it is very close to our house and we like the drinks. I just get concerned to go there for an entire meal as the food is tasty but really greasy. Everything seems to be deep fried and/or loaded with grease. BTW  Waiters are TERRIBLE! They always have you waiting long for every request you make  even to refill water or bring condiments. Go there for happy-hour without big expectations!
Katie L.,Seattle  WA,75,288,140,11/1/2009,4.0,Pretty pricey but tastey. Probably wouldn't go out of my way to go here. Got fish tacos for like $10 which is kind of extreme but they were good. They have their own beer which is nice. We sampled the pumpkin and also a porter. Both were really quite scrum.They have a giant screen in the bar that we watched a nuggets game on which was nice. Service  good.They have a turnstyle door and I am a huge fan of that so obviously 4 stars.
Kim O.,Aurora  CO,13,21,3,9/11/2010,3.0,BJ's has a nice patio with heat lamps which makes it great for fall evenings!I highly recommend the clam chowder in the sourdough bowl and the calamari.As a brewhouse should  BJ's offers a long list of world renowned beers. This isn't my typical hangout but even so  my experience was pretty excellent!
Cynthia L.,San Antonio  TX,0,10,,10/17/2012,3.0,Ordered the new quesadilla which was delicious but the chicken teriyaki could have been better; service was good
Larry K.,Littleton  CO,90,109,24,5/27/2012,4.0,It's Fish and chip Friday!!! Great food  great scene... The only annoyance was our waitress reeked of cigarettes. We will be back for more!
Ivy M.,Denver  CO,65,92,18,3/11/2012,3.0,Was not impressed by the food  calamari was not good. The atmosphere seems nice for being in Aurora  I will try it again  and per recommendation I'll order the pink beer. But if your able to eat else where .. head downtown.
Cass D.,Englewood  CO,140,921,257,3/2/2009,3.0,My service was alright. Nothing spectacular. The food is very good  but it costs a bit more then I think it should. I'd stop there again if I am in the area and have the money to spend  but I won't be making a special trip... Rock Bottom Brewery & Old Chicago are closer and cheaper for me.
Ami R.,Aurora  CO,74,14,,11/3/2011,4.0,I really like this place. They have good food and beer. I didn't have beer on this visit..just ice tea. I had the lunch special one toping pizza and salad. It's a great price and it's good. I will try the half flatbread pizza and salad next time..the regular pizza is just too much bread. This would be a great place to go and watch sports...they have serveral tv's. The staff is very friendly and service was great..as always. That was a special day for a group of firefighters and I was happy to have them sit at a table near me. Yum and Yum.
Jodi A.,Denver  CO,147,237,31,1/11/2012,4.0,I like this place. The avocado egg rolls are my favorite....the wedge fries were awesome and so was my California burger on sourdough  but after consuming hefewiezen and the appetizer  I was full ! The service here is friendly  and on a Tuesday night  the place was packed !
Jolene C.,Denver  CO,4,100,,7/10/2011,5.0,"When you have a big group of people who all like different food  but all love beer  this is a great place to take them. Big menu full of ""American"" favorites like pizza  burgers  pasta  and salads and a pretty hefty beer list. The service is great  parking is plentiful  and the location can\'t be beat - right across the street from the Aurora Mall and about 1/2 mile from the onramp to I-225.Service is truly excellent  your drinks never get empty  the food is always hot  and the bathrooms are immaculate. Highly recommended for when you need a lot of different food options for a lot of different people.I should also note that its pretty spacious in there - it\'s like the whole restaurant was designed to accommodate wheelchairs and walkers. The entrance and aisles are very wide. Even the bathrooms had extra-wide doors and a wheelchair-level sink."
Randee D.,Colorado Springs  CO,0,4,,5/2/2014,5.0,Love  love   love everything about this restaurant! Server's  manager's and the food. Go every day if you can. Try the new Salted Caramel Pizookie!
S. S.,Aurora  CO,12,67,16,12/18/2011,4.0,Yes!!!! Love the beer  fried artichoke hearts  and the pizza was almost as good as old Chicago's which is hard to beat  so... Over all... Grubbin'!
Dane R.,Earlham  IA,0,2,,7/16/2012,5.0,Awesome! I got the pork ribs. Amazing. The cook deserved a hug.
Jason D.,Denver  CO,1,35,13,7/13/2012,4.0,AWESOME FOOD! The atmosphere is very cool  and the servers are always great! I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for something other than burgers and tacos. Worth the drive.
Jason L.,Littleton  CO,4,77,30,10/12/2008,4.0,This is a really good place. It lost a star because I feel its a little overpriced (just enough to make it a special trip as opposed to a regular one). The service is good. I have ordered curbside pizza a few times to bring it home and its always been done right. They were 5-10 minutes behind one time. The manager came out and apologized and offered me a free beer. At that point I didn't mind waiting for a few minutes. For those that have tried things other than pizza  they've enjoyed it. I had chicken tenders once  they were plenty good  not amazing  but fine. Their dessert cookies are an absolute must have. Get the cookies and cream. Best ever! Their pot stickers are tasty too.
A.J. T.,South San Francisco  CA,32,63,,12/9/2010,4.0,BJs rocks.Service was great  food was great  portions were enough to enjoy AND take home. Plus the beer was outstanding  I love the BJs brews but also the fact that their beer selection is more than just the typicals. You can get anything from a seasonal brew to a Belgian to a simple wheat.Plus  the Pazookie is insane. It's basically this delicious warm gooey cookie topped with ice cream and whipped cream. Enough for two to share too! A little on the pricey side (I'm a hole-in-the-wall cheapass) but even as your grudgingly pulling our your credit card to pay  you'll have nothing but happy thoughts about your food and service.Pros: BEER SELECTION. Good service  variety on menu  good portions.Cons: A little more pricey than you'd find in most of downtown. But not much.
Chuck B.,Denver  CO,2,85,21,10/2/2011,4.0,Standard restaurant. Cannot say that there is anything special about this place. If you are looking for consistency and a place to enjoy the people you are with  this would be a good option.
Jonathan S.,Centennial  CO,0,19,,11/27/2013,3.0,There are a lot of options on the menu  so they get good marks there. The food is average but $7 for an average draft? I'll stick to the breweries with better beer that only charge $5. After all  what is the main reason you go to a brewery?
Suzanne P.,Aurora  CO,98,212,47,8/8/2011,4.0,"LOVE IT! This one seems better than most of their locations. We had guests from Texas and they are regulars at ""their"" BJ\'s  they mentioned that the nit whit beer tastes way better at the Aurora location so I know its not just me!"
David M.,Littleton  CO,130,11,11,8/18/2011,5.0,This restaurant brewery is one of my favorites. I plan my flights from Dallas to Denver to arrive around 4PM so we can get here for happy hour and enjoy a great meal before heading on home to Littleton. They have great homemade fresh beer. It's also a great place to hang out and watch most any sports that may be on at the time.
Brooke F.,Denver  CO,20,48,,10/25/2010,4.0,I am a huge fan of BJs food. They have a wide variety of food ranging from pasta and pizza to baked potatoes (ginormous 1lb+ with toppings) to soup  salads  sandwiches... You get the picture. If you want a wide variety of selections  BJs is your place to go! I highly recommend saving room for dessert and getting a pizookie. Sounds like a silly name  I know but they are to die for. A cookie served in a mini pizza pan  cooked til it's done but still ooey gooey in the center and topped with ice cream  this dessert is always my go-to dessert when we go there! The service is all right  but it could be better. Still  the food makes it well worth it.
Adriena W.,Aurora  CO,2,34,,3/12/2012,5.0,BJ's service has really improved over the last few visits and their rewards program is amazing! The food is consistently great. My favorites are the chicken Parmesan and ahi tuna wonton dish. Plus they have free pizookie day every once in awhile. Overall  great place with great food and service!
Chris L.,Antioch  CA,24,117,,6/14/2011,3.0,well whats there to say hmmmm. well lets start off with the service being kind of slow but the wait staff did make up for it when a small issue arose. The food was great it always is  just a little expensive when it comes to the appetizers cmon 7 bucks for 6 eggrolls cmon thats just a little much and well they didnt taste any different then one i buy at the store go figure. All in all it was a good experience but im not ever getting a appetizer again
Jain W.,Commerce City  CO,0,2,,6/25/2012,1.0,"if i could i wouldnt even give one star! We\'ve been here 5 times total  the very first time our service was Amazing! The avocado spring rolls are awesome. But the service here is awful and getting worse. We came here in May with some out of state friends. The food was great but again our service was bad. We waited for 10 mins after our food was brought out for refills on our drinks  the server had forgotten so when we stopped him again he said he would get them out right away  No apology though. After our meal he brought out our check and we asked if we could get a military discount. He said yes  but needed a manager\'s approval and went to take the ID cards. That\'s when we told him politely that he can\'t take our military id cards away from the table  and that if the manager needed to see our ids he can come to our table. This was the 3rd time being here and we NEVER had the server try to take our ID\'s (nor EVER had any restaurant try and take our ID\'s away from the table). He said we would go get his manager. 15 mins later No manager came but he returned with our check with a military discount. Our most recent t trip and our last to this restaurant our waitress was awful! We ordered an appetizer she said she would get us some plates and silverware. 10 minutes later we got our appetizer but still no plates  or silverware. When my husband got the attention of a different waitress  we asked for plates  and silverware. She rolled her eyes at us! And said ""yeah hold on."" (In a real pissy tone) Finally our food came. But my grandma was having a problem eating her sandwich  the bread was falling apart. When our waitress came walking by we got her attention. When I asked for a new slice of bread she said "" yes sure. But just so you know the bread will fall apart again it\'s just the multigrain bread they use. But Next time you come ask them to toast it for you it holds it together better."" Umm why not toast the bread I just asked you to bring out? Instead my grandma said no thank you ill just eat it with a fork and knife. We were all a bit frustrated at this point with our service. Again when she brought our check we asked for military discount. She stated they don\'t offer military discount. When we asked if that just happened  because they have offered it in the past she told us they\'ve never offered military discount (Also in a really pissy tone). Finally we\'ve had enough my husband asked to speak to a manager. About 15 mins later she returned with NO manager  no apology  but with our check including military discount on ONE of our drinks so the total discount was $1.00 off a $65 bill. We were insulted I can\'t believe how awful the service is her. We will NEVER return to this restaurant again. As for the manager I hope he realizes that his employees need a talking to about professionalism. Rolling your eyes at a customer is so disrespectful and shouldn\'t be tolerated. If I hadn\'t of been there with my family  and it was just my husband and myself we would have left then! Also if they don\'t know what discounts the restaurants offer to customer\'s maybe they should learn."
Blythe K.,Haleiwa  HI,9,54,2,3/25/2008,4.0,I had a hard time deciding on what to eat here - lots of great-looking items on the menu! I went with a veggie burger  which was very typical (nothing special) but still tasted great. Better than the meal  the draft root beer was a refreshing change from the syrupy crap you get out of a fountain. My husband had a couple of the beers and gave them a thumbs up.It wasn't super expensive or anything  but I removed a star because I felt it was slightly overpriced for the quality of the food. However  the atmosphere was great and the brand-new quality of the restaurant made for a pleasant dinner.
Jamie P.,Fort Morgan  CO,0,1,,8/21/2010,5.0,My husband I ate here and loved it! The beer was great  the chicken parmesan awesome  and the fish tacos delicious! For the amount if food we received the price was just right. Our server  Emily  was attentive and friendly. We will definitely return when we're in the area.
Megan M.,Aurora  CO,0,6,,7/21/2013,1.0,The service was horrible. My server was a sweet girl  I think the problem is the management. My food was cold  the manager (sm. asian ) was nice to me ( of coarse) and apologized. I was so i sat and observed. She ran around like it was her place. Trying to blame a problem on the nearest working. Will never eat there again. I wouldn't be surprised in a few years if they're out of business.
Alan B.,Denver  CO,9,54,17,3/5/2010,4.0,bjs has an upscale atmosphere but a feeling like you're at a small pub. The beer list was presented to us as soon as we sat down along with parings for the beer. They were more than willing to bring samples of their brews to help me make my ultimate decision on the pint I would most enjoy  although they were all very good I decided to try the Jeremiah red which went great with the pizza we had. We tried the buffalo chicken pizza  which basically tastes like a hot wing on crust. Sadly the pizza bread is most of the pizza with a thin layer of toppings. The crust was buttery and and perfectly crisp. The wait staff were very friendly and kept the waters and teas full during the meal.
Bryan H.,Pine  CO,54,132,43,10/20/2010,4.0,Great service  atmosphere  and most importantly yummy beer. Food is otay  I'd rather just grab the beer and an app.
Donovan E.,Englewood  CO,7,76,1,1/5/2010,4.0,great balance of beer and food. they brew like 7 of their own beers. all pretty good and they have a great kick. they also have seasonal/special beers at time. the selection is also pretty good for microbrew/draft beers  and imports and bottles. food is delectable  and i always get the pizza. one of the only places around you can get whole  roasted garlic cloves on your deep dish style pizza. awesome! i usually do the 7 beer sampler. great buzz  great all around flava! compliments the food/pizza well. they always have cool ambient music playing  numerous TVs and sports games  bar or seating  and a friendly staff. i just wish the place had a little bit better lighting scheme. and this is like 1 of a few in the whole area which is a bummer now that my drive is twice as far.highly recommended for anybody who needs to relax  have a beer  and tasty plentiful food to go along with it. and if you havent had a pazooki  theres no better time to try one (cookie with ice cream on top).
Allison M.,Northville  MI,1,11,,11/19/2011,5.0,This place is amazing! The staff is friendly and always quick to accommodate our table. The menu has everything...seriously...everything.. you could ever want. Their beer is great and try the BJ's pizza. I LOVE BJ's Brewhouse!
Jessica C.,Englewood  CO,15,99,21,5/19/2009,4.0,Excellent Happy hour  and the staff accommodates the last minute crowd for Fridays. The drinks are gorgeous  the food is portioned  and the crowd varies.
Dana H.,Centennial  CO,2,21,,2/7/2012,1.0,The 1st time we visited BJ's was right before Christmas and the food was terrible and after sending back my entree once  the manager came out to apologize. I mean  who advertises a dish with pine nuts and then leaves them out? The service was also very slow and what could've been an easy dinner in/out at Chili's  this place took hours. After that I figured it wouldn't be my 1st choice to go again and we only live 5 mins away.Today my husband thought we should give it a second shot and I'm sad to say I agreed. Even sadder to say that my food was bad & I've had an upset stomach since arriving home.  The waitress pounced on us a minute after we were sat and seemed irritated that we didn't know what we wanted to drink or if we wanted an appetizer. I cracked the menu and reluctantly placed our order. The speed of her first appearance was the only fast thing we got today. Drinks took almost 10 minutes to arrive at our table. The iced tea tasted old and stale and I had to ask our server twice for sweetener. Another 10 minutes later our chips & salsa arrived. The salsa bowl being barely half full and was gone before half the chips were gone. Extra salsa would be addt'l so we opted out. 20 minutes later our order was taken and another 20 minutes later our food arrived. I think the cook should go back in training. Serving pasta that is still yellow and highly undercooked is a rookie mistake. My sons pizza was burnt. My husband's shrimp tacos had shrimp that could've been considered undercooked. Drinks were empty for at least 10 minutes and when the refills arrived  so did the check. For 3 adults & 1 kid  we paid $72 for LUNCH! And it was crap food.I will not be going back to BJ's again. I gave them 2 chances and both times have been well below par with the service being freaking awful. Had the restaurant been busy when we went today  I'd given more stars... but our waitress had 4 small tables  so there is no excuse for her being MIA so often. I think I'll be giving my business to other restaurants who value their customers.
Jody D.,Aurora  CO,1,26,,2/9/2009,4.0,We are big fans of BJs. It is one of our go-to restaurants in Aurora for sure. BJs has a giagantic menu and is somewhat reasonably priced. Also it has plenty of TVs including a full wall with multiple screens which makes it a good substitute location to watch a game. Even though it is a chain restaurant it doesnt really feel like a Fridays or Chilis and for the most part the servers are quite nice and the service is good.Their happy hour deals are pretty good also. Try the appetizer pizzas!
Severin A.,Aurora  CO,0,15,,11/20/2011,4.0,I went to BJ's for lunch the other day and I have to say that I am glad I found this place as it fits a particular need I have had for a place with a large menu  good food  somewhat upscale  yet fun environment  in the past to meet this need when I had family over I ended up either driving further than I would have preferred to go to Cheesecake Factory  or I would have went to a chain where the food is not as good  like TGI Fridays or Chili's. Discovering this place was great because I found my food to be good  I ordered the chicken parmigiana lunch and liked the spicy marinara sauce. The crispy coating on the chicken and the abundance of cheese on the chicken. I ordered the homemade rootbeer and it was very good. I cannot speak for the food that the others in my party ordered  but judging from the looks of it  their food was good as well. Our service was really good  and the waiter was prompt on the refills. This is definitely a place to go to when you have a group of picky eaters  due to the large accessible menu everyone should be able to find something they like. They even had a low calorie section in the menu with several meals under 575 calories. It is somewhere I will go back to since it is close to where I live and seems to fit a need for the area.
Sergio C.,Woodinville  WA,14,30,1,6/19/2011,4.0,Good beer - great prices on happy hour. Food is normal bar food.
