Sabryna S.,Austin  TX,276,19,46,11/7/2017,4.0,Great food! Good service! To start  we were seated very quickly. The waiter was very attentive! Although  we did have a miscommunication. We were under the impression that the half off pizza special included all the pizzas  but it turns out it was only if you ordered a large. So in that sense there could have been more clarity when we were placing our orders because the small ended up being more expensive than if I got the large. But  it's all good. The pizza was delicious!! It came fresh out of the oven with the perfect amount of pepperonis in place. If deep dish is your thing  BJ's is the place. It was also my friend's birthday so they brought out a mini pizooki for him. I had a few bites and it was the perfect finish to my meal. Warm  chocolately chip goodness all topped off with a scoop of creamy  vanilla ice cream. Yummmm.
Bill B.,Houston  TX,0,16,2,10/8/2017,3.0,This is a takeout review. Ordered two pizookies as part of the special $3 promo. Not sure if it's the promotion or that o requested take out  but wow the quality has gone down massively! When I first saw the containers  I questioned the quantity since it looked much smaller. I even asked to make sure it wasn't a mini. I was assured it was a normal sized pizookie. When I got home  I was disappointed. Since it was only $3 per pizookie  it didn't feel bad but I was upset since I was expecting something good. The cookie barely even filled up half of the plate  and I definitely didn't receive more than one scoop of ice cream. Maybe two small scoops. Again  I think it was probably because I had takeout  and the special promo. They need to cut corners somewhere to still get some money at the end of the day. I get that  but just charge $5 per pizookie then  and give us what we expect. Definitely disappointed  and probably will avoid coming here for a while.
Ling C.,Austin  TX,83,102,331,8/4/2017,3.0,I love BJ's  I come here often  especial this location  sometimes 3  4 times a week. We have our favorite waiter and waitress and we memorize their happy hours and I can honestly say there is nothing I have not tried on the menu. While the seasoning on the food are usually on the salty side for me  I still think they are pretty tasty. I'm only giving it 3 stars because the experiences I had this past week. They sometimes have really good deal on the weekdays  but the waitress did not inform us the extra charge on some of sides while ordering the deal of the day  and of course I wasn't aware of it till I got the receipt. The other time I was charged extra for one of the sides. Kudos to the manager  the first time I called and complained about the issue  I was well taken care off immediately. Nevertheless  having to double check the receipt twice (and happened in the same week) was pretty annoying. We even joke about if we would go to our favorite scam restaurant for the dinner now. This was where I used to celebrate birthdays at  but not anymore.
Morgann H.,Houston  TX,116,9,334,11/19/2017,5.0,My favorite Bj's location in Austin by far! Their welcome and hospitality is so warm. They have some of the friendliest staff and are very accommodating. My last waitress was MARLEY! She was so sweet and just a blessing. Her genuine service made myself and boyfriend loyal. Always great food and a great time when we come here.
Jody W.,Gansevoort  NY,132,632,1515,8/3/2017,4.0,"Family took me here last night for dinner. I learned that BJ\'s is a western-state chain that originated in California. The big draw was that have their own beers.....so I was down for trying some new brews. The menu is extensive and it\'s pretty hard to choose! (Hey! That rhymed!) Lots of heavier fare that are calorie-laden but they also have lighter choices.I opted for the thin crust pizza with pineapple and jalapeo. The thin crust version is new to the menu and there are only a few choices - one was with bacon ham  pineapple and jalapeo...I just asked to hold the meat on that one. Came out light  crispy  savory and a little sweet/tart/hot with the pineapple and jalapeo. We started by sharing the brussels sprouts - served crispy with a creamy sriracha sauce. Yum.My dining companions had the loaded burger and the chicken parmesan. Fries are really good. (I stole several). Dark beers all around - I had the bourbon barrel stout...delicious and strong. Nope...wasn\'t driving. Yep - had two.Almost forgot about the dessert! Maybe it\'s because I was in a beer/food-coma after this meal. We ordered 3 ""mini"" pizookies (get it? pizza and cookie makes a new word...): 1 monkey bread  one triple chocolate and one salted caramel. All were super sweet  decadent and....like I said...coma inducing. High calorie treat for sure but if you\'re going for it...go for it. They have ""regular"" sized pizookies as well. The restaurant is clean  large  loud and the food was good. Would definitely go to BJ\'s again."
Steban D.,Pflugerville  TX,17,69,15,6/21/2017,4.0,I really enjoy BJ'sThey have a large menu so there is a lot to pick from and can sometimes be hard for me to make a decision  to many options.The burgers are solid  and they come with the little thin cut crispy fries that i like. I have tried their deep dish pizzas and their flat bread pizzas. It's definitely not Chicago style deep dish but it is good. The flat breads are very filling. I'm a big boy and i usually leave a piece or two behind.The salads are huge and very filling. They have a seared Ahi salad that was delicious. I am normally not big on desert because i am usually full from my meal but their Pizookie are awesome! Basically they are like a big warm cookie with a scoop of ice cream. They have a monkey bread pizookie that i have been wanting to try.They also have a really good beer that they make in house. I like the Brew house blonde  harvest Hefeweizen  and the Nutty Brewnette. Really good beers!
Donovan S.,Pflugerville  TX,175,105,55,5/22/2017,4.0,"I went to dinner here with a buddy and it was not very crowded. It is a big  open restaurant with tall ceilings so it isn\'t very loud. Our server was nice but a little slow and when we were ready to pay we couldn\'t find her so we had another waitress track her down with our checks. The food here has always been really good for me. I had their Peruvian shrimp quinoa bowl and it was delicious. My friend had their guacamole bacon burger and he said it was ""awesome."" Of course you could put guacamole and bacon on a flip-flop and it would taste good. :-). They have some really good beers they brew themselves. Their Nutty Brewnette is a great American brown ale. My friend had their hefeweizen  which I tried and it was good too. They have an extensive menu and the service is usually good. I\'ll be back  I\'ve always enjoyed the food and their fried avocado rolls are AWESOME."
Stephanie A.,Austin  TX,43,149,1112,12/7/2016,4.0,We have been to BJ's a few times. This was our first visit to this location. We fell in love with BJ's a while back because of the beer selections  happy hour  food  and customer service. This trip did not disappoint us at all. We left happy and satisfied with our visit.For our drinks  my husband ordered a pint of the Grand Cru  a holiday Craft Beer. He was not a big fan  but I loved it! I ordered the the BJ's Irish Rootbeer  which includes hand crafted root beer  Jameson's Irish Whiskey  Baileys Irish Cream  and Butterscotch schnapps. This was absolutely delicious  the only change I would make is a bit more whiskey and schnapps. I tasted everything else but these two ingredients and both should have been noticeable in the drink if the correct amount was added. For our meal  my husband ordered the Derby-Style Chicken Cobb salad. He absolutely adored it. This is December  and the freshness and quality of the vegetables were amazingly on point. The avocado tasted of a freshly picked one from Summer time  no bruises on it at all. He loved this salad and ate it all up.I ordered the North Beach Mahi & Shrimp entree.  I am normally not a huge tomato based food kind of fan - heartburn and all....but this dish was sooo delicious and fresh - I would order it again in a heartbeat. The mahi mahi was super fresh and this fish is just like a steak of the seas- very meaty and hearty. The flavors were so well blended. The shrimp was spot on delicious. The dish had a saltiness but not salty - more like a briney flavor that hits your taste buds and makes them tingle with happiness. Of course I had to keep pushing my husbands fork away at his attempts to steal my food lol. The only suggestion I would have is a few more shrimp  but it was the standard amount - especially for the price which was fairly decent considering the quality and quantity of the dish.Great customer service  excellent food  and fun drinks will always keep us coming back for more. Thank you!
Jay N.,Roosevelt  NY,45,310,1853,2/22/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Luv this place great selection of both craft beer great pizza sandwiches and burgers.always a good atmosphere and courteous professional service.           Back again love this place large variety of craft beers tonight we're doing salads The super kale salad with grilled salmon and the seared Ahi tuna salad .Two great craft beers the BJ's brewhouse Blondie and the BJ's Jeremiah Red
Jim O.,Austin  TX,8,214,16,4/30/2017,3.0,This place has the usual fare. I nice setting and friendly staff but the food while  good was nothing special. I had the Cobb Salad and I must say it had a generous portion of chicken. The chocolate chip cookie with ice cream was a lot of sweet and not much notable flavor. Alas.Oh  I'd eat here again if I were in the neighborhood  but otherwise no.
Samuel C.,Austin  TX,91,650,,2/2/2017,4.0,BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse gets no love in Austin.Some Yelpers hate it.The parking lot is deserted.In contrast  BJ's is THE place to be in College Station.The place is always packed. You park far away and walk in.The two establishments are near clones of each other -so the question is not good vs bad establishments in a chain.It is Austin vs Aggie World View.*On this particular question - I have to side with the Aggies.BJ's is a fine establishment.It is not perfect. It is an eating establishment - and not a drinking establishment.Their homemade beers generally are awful. (I recently ordered a Jeremiah Red  took two sips of it and sent it back to the bartender.Tasteless on first mouth contact - but with a bad aftertaste. Talk about a bad combination of attributes.)Their selection of other beers and hard liquors is good but not magnificent.In Austin  which has the best funky bars of any city in a 1000 mile radius ....There are simply too many other awesome places near by for BJ's to be able to compete.In Bryan/College Station  BJ's stock runs higher from weaker competition.*But bar by bar comparisons miss the big picture here.BJ's has three gigantic points in its favor.1) The room is beautiful.2) The food is excellent.3) For Chili's-style American places  BJ's has one of the healthiest menus around. Good eye candy  good taste and a note from my doctor.With that combination  sign me up.*The room. The architectural style is deliberately 1930's retro with better lighting. This is particularly noticeable in the bathrooms - which are some of the best ever for a chain restaurant. But it applies throughout the establishment.Wainscoting. Frosted glass doors with old-style lettering. Brass accents. Walking in here feels like you are entering Sardi's or the Algonquin Hotel lunchroom.I am always happy when I arrive at a BJ's.*The food.BJ's runs a standard American chain bar and grill menu with more light items and more vegetables. You want quinoa? They got quinoa. They have many veggie sides and not just a few. They always have five or six different soups ranging from light and not caloric to loaded with the works. And yeah - they got burgers - lots of burgers - and wings and ribs and all the fun stuff we love  for when you need more than a portobello mushroom to keep you happy.Execution is excellent both on healthy stuff and fun stuff. I have been eating at BJ's (although not the Austin one) for years and have yet to get a bad dish. When I made my test run of the North Mopac BJ's  I intentionally ordered dishes I have had at the College Station BJ's. The preparation and final product were the same in both places - which meant I was quite happy with my food.*Now people have told me that they have had bad experiences at BJ's.Maybe there is a new manager now - and the old manager was terrible.Maybe I know too many fussy eaters - although I doubt that since I hang with the most magnificent people in the universe.But the BJ's on North Mopac seems perfectly fine.For my money  BJ's is at the top of the chain American bar-and-grill establishment -and is still respectable when you add indie bar and grills into the comparison pool.Yeah  it is not better than the best of the best - but it is as good if not better than much of the pack.Just don't drink their homemade beer.
Jim S.,Marion  IA,0,2,,11/27/2017,5.0,This is one of the best restaurants I've been to in all 50 of the state's. We were seated immediately  and our waitress was extremely helpful and friendly. The atmosphere was casual  several tv's going at once but we were still able to have a normal conversation. Their menu had several choices  and and it hard for us to decide what to order.  My wife ordered the bread bowl clam chowder  and spinich salad. I had a bowl of broccoli cheese soup and a brisquit bacon burger. The food was fantastic  and very reasonably priced.  Would highly recommend you stop and eat here if you are in the area.
Marissa P.,Austin  TX,187,111,724,6/30/2016,4.0,So apparently my boyfriend is a BIG fan of BJ'S brewhouse  he was very excited when he saw there were some here when we moved. So obviously he insisted we go.The restaurant is very cute and clean  has a nice casual ambiance  good friendly and attentive service  and pretty delicious food and great beer. I had a blonde ale and my boyfriend got a flight with 4 beer samples  their prices for beer were VERY reasonable too  mine was only $4!!We were starving so we started with 2 apps  BBQ boneless wings and the fried artichokes. The BBQ sauce was delicious and the wings were really good  plus we got a LOT for the price. The artichokes were my favorite though  very good and different.For my entree I had Mediterranean chicken tacos and my boyfriend had the bison burger. He loved his burger and my tacos were amazing  I also loved the side grain salad that came with it!! Everything tasted very good and fresh  also the portions were good for the prices. I'm not usually a fan of chains but I was very pleased with our experience here  we'll be back I'm sure!
M. O.,Overland Park  KS,79,173,292,11/9/2016,4.0,My buddy and I are big fans of BJ's. Restaurants! Keep you head out of the gutter!Each time we visit the Austin area  we head over to the closest location to make sure we do at least one round of BJ's before heading home. The chain is in the same vein as Granite City  where you have a nice  slightly upscale bar-and-grill approach to the dining room. The food is uber-solid for the genre  and the beer here is super easy to drink across the entire line. No matter your preference  you'll find a very approachable brew with your name on it. This time around  I went for the whiskey barrel aged porter  and was not disappointed. Is it A+ beer? Negative. However  it's a solid  passable B all day long  and that's pretty good for a chain bar and grill.I've tried a good swath of the food on the menu as well. Among my favorites is the pizza.But  the thing that will keep you coming back is the Pizookie. Goofy in name but dead-serious in flavor  this has to be one of my favorite desserts  anywhere. It's a fresh-baked cookie  served oven-warm in a micro-dish with a scoop of ice cream and a drizzle of sauce on top. There are multiple flavors to choose from  and all are killer. On my last visit  our waitress  Ms. Marlie  enticed me with a bit of a tease about a Pizookie Platter  which she mentioned is like having five full-size Pizookies. It's now on the bucket list.Over three trips to Austin  I've been to one BJ's or another six times. Frequency alone ought to speak volumes  especially in a land of incredible food trucks and barbecue.I really can't figure out why almost every location of this franchise is rated 3 stars on Yelp. You people must not have been to your local Crapplebees or Chili's lately!Food = 4/5 Facility = 4/5Service = 4/5Ambiance = 3/5Value = 3/5
Krista M.,Saint Paul  MN,7,285,145,11/8/2016,4.0,This restaurant is beautiful inside. It was later on a Monday night so it was pretty empty. I could easily see us coming here again (if they were in our area) and watching a game. It felt warm  cozy  and very relaxed. It was nice to see that not all TVs were not on football. We watched a bit of arm wrestling which was surprisingly entertaining. :)The menu is huge. Too big  really. I was trying to decide between a burger  pasta  pizza or a steak. Everything looked delicious. They were out of the pumpkin beer  so my husband tried the Hopstorm IPA. He also tried the Piranha IPA. The Piranha was much better  much more hoppy.Their peach margarita was good. The glass was full of ice which is why I probably don't drink much when we go out - I always feel I'm not getting my money's worth. I loved the flavor and the peaches at the bottom of the glass but I should remember to stick to blended drinks. I switched to a mug of their BJ's Root Beer and that was excellent. Frosty  cold mug...yum. I'd buy that to bring home if I could. The hickory brisket and bacon burger was excellent. I would have loved more brisket  but there was plenty of bacon and the BBQ sauce was really good. The wedge fries were good  too. My husband enjoyed his vegetable penne. The service was great and we will be back before we leave town!
Rick O.,Austin  TX,0,3,,5/24/2017,1.0,"I\'m a regular customer at BJ\'s and very rarely complain about service at restaurants but the service here basically sucked! After numerous mistakes by our server and lack of attention I went to the bar to get refills on beer and soft drinks.The prime rib was WELL DONE! Who cooks prime rib well done.The server argued about what we ordered after 3 people told her she was wrong. The manager said she had an ""off night"" and came to our table and tried to soften the anger by joking about irrelevant inappropriate things then compted us for appetizers we didn\'t even order that was erroneously put on our bill.We are NEVER going to this location again Nd it had soured me from ever going to ANY BJ\'s"
Andrea S.,Austin  TX,24,1,,9/2/2017,1.0,The manager tonight his name was christian was really rude. I ordered a medium well steak it came out well done. Then i ordered a drink and a bug was in it. Then I ordered some wings and they gave me the wrong wings. The Manager did not try to compensate me at all. I ended up not eating tonight. This was ridiculous
Andy B.,Oltorf/East Riverside  Austin  TX,0,7,,11/10/2017,5.0,I stopped by during a shopping excursion because I honestly needed a break and a cold beer! I sat at the bar and Joshua the bar tender was fantastic! his knowledge of beers and spirits was superb and he helped to guide me to there Jeremiah Red (which I highly recommend). His service and attention to detail was above and beyond what I generally have received in the area. Hats off to Joshua for making my experience great with good conversation and spectacular service. I will definitely be back to see him again!
Yamil C.,Manor  TX,27,75,129,5/8/2017,4.0,I enjoyed my time at bj's this place rarely dissappoints. They are pretty consitent across their restaurants as multiple dishes i have had at other locations have identical flavors. My favorite appetizer is the calamari and it goes perfect with a cold house hefeweizen. I love this place will come back soon.
Camilla M.,Houston  TX,88,57,513,5/14/2017,4.0,We always enjoy our visit to BJ's. The waitress was nice and helpful. It took a while for our food to come out  but maybe because we ordered a pizza. Restrooms were clean. Restaurant was clean except for a dead fly & dust on the ledge by our table (right next to the lamp) The closing transaction went smooth. Would go again.
Jana N.,Austin  TX,124,363,93,1/20/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I'm still not a fan of chains. The apps were nice and the selection of drinks is great. I am not a huge fan of the food. The avocado on the tuna thing was tasty. The queso was great! Do you want to know the best thing?I thought so. Our server in the bar area was Jamison. Now that is a great idea for hiring a great employee -- attentiveness and Jamison.Thanks for your help.
Daniel A.,Ingleside  TX,11,6,3,8/17/2017,1.0,Friends you know usually I love the places I go the things we share together tonight I say this is the second worst experience my girlfriend and I have had to date forget this bj's the service sucked assholes and the manager defending the shitty ass service we got. I think I have been in member service for far to long for this in any way to be acceptable in any way. They get drinks all around us we got ignored great.
Lis F.,Austin  TX,3,71,18,3/28/2017,3.0,Wow what can I saw the fish tacos  tasted just like my husbands ex-mil Jans! She was from the great state of Nebraska. So she knows her seafood and I have always loved her shrimp salad (extra mayo!) you need to see her whole decorated salmon. So I got the tacos thinkin meh  they might be decent but man! They were just like Jan's!
Greg G.,Austin  TX,27,29,,8/21/2017,5.0,We have been going here for years for 3 reasons; great food  great beer  and outstanding customer service. We have never had a bad experience here. Nothing much to say  other than  go see for yourself. BJ'S is on our regular rotation.
Xochtil G.,Austin  TX,0,59,6,8/17/2017,2.0,"Curious a location to find in the Arbor Walk shopping center  yet not all its hyped up to be. It is nice that they offer a ""steak and beer"" option  yet seemed more like a hyped up ""Bennigans"" with its big burgers and average booths and some upscale touches to the decor. The entry was nice and the staff friendly  yet the food was not all that great. We each had different items from their lunch menu and some of us did feel that either it was not well seasoned on their burgers or their other items had some added taste that just did not do the item justice.       I would recommend at least try once  but if you are a beer drinker with no real interest in an actual dining experience; then come to this casual urban place at least once."
Alexa B.,Austin  TX,0,1,,8/16/2017,1.0,Visited to spend a gift card I received and everything about my experience was absolutely awful. The hostess looked like she hated her job and didn't talk to us. Our server obviously did not want to be serving us  either. She never smiled and was very short with all of her questions. She never once came to refill our drinks and when I tried to complain about my pizookie (I got the churro pizookie but it tasted like onions) she refused to stop at our table. The evening came to an end by her basically tossing the bill at our table and not even stopping to ask how our dinner was. This was my first and last time visiting BJ's.
Wendy S.,Leander  TX,125,110,120,10/17/2016,1.0,"I went there on Friday night with 5 of my gal pals before we went to the movies--easy parking--hostess stand was the issue  and not just one issue--I was the first to arrive (One gal pal was in the bar) I let the hostess know there would be 6 of us--she asked if I wanted to be seated now  and I said I would wait for my gal pals--ok  so 10 minutes go by  and we are all here--we all get up  I go back to the hostess  and say we are ready for the table of 6--Its going to go downhill from here--""You need a table for 6?"" she asked--yes  I just talked with you a few minutes ago--""Ok  let me get it set up  its going to be a few minutes""OMG--Ok  so we wait another 10 minutesAnd mind you  half the restaurant is emptyThey take us back to the VERY back by the dish tub  server station--I stopped walking when I saw where we were going--there was a huge booth that was empty and clean  and I said \'Can we have this one  it looks perfect?""She replies  ""Yes  but we need to set it up  so we need you to go back to the hostess stand and wait"" OMG--nothing to set up but napkins--but  I should have know better  as they werent going to sit us there--so  they take us back to the hostess stand  another few minutes go by  and they take us to ANOTHER booth directly to the right side of the other cr@ppy table that was in the back that we didnt want --Seriously? This is probably why I dont like chain restaurants nearly as much as when I was younger--Im not even going to review anything else  because seriously  if it is this much of an issue to sit at a nice table when a place is half empty  I won\'t be going back"
Eddie G.,Austin  TX,0,6,,6/14/2017,5.0,Always great food and great service. Plenty of healthy options and always happy to accommodate large groups with out reservations  you may have to wait a bit but well worth it.
Bill H.,Austin  TX,53,13,,5/4/2017,4.0,We meet here once a month so working on going through the menu. Everything has been good to date. Their menu is large so it has something for everyone. I am not into craft beer more like mixed drinks or water. One of the better chain options so I will continue my patronage.
Erik P.,Austin  TX,26,136,80,4/21/2016,3.0,"(More like 3.5 stars)I cannot count how many times I\'ve driven past this particular BJ\'s Brewhouse. Finally decided to give it a shot after hearing positive things. Overall I must say it was a positive experience and I\'d be willing to come back again. Everything we ordered was good but the only thing I noticed that could have been better was the food temperature. Although the Tuscan Tomato Bisque and Clam Chowder soups were warm at best  they were both good. The tomato and fresh mozzarella salad was exceptional  but it was real small. The half-sandwich with fries (the other part of our ""lunch combos"") were good and for $7.99 there are no real complaints here. Some friends told us that their Jambalaya is really good. One of them cooks that AND is from New Orleans  so I am definitely taking his word on that!    Until next time  BJs!"
Christopher S.,Pflugerville  TX,61,191,1279,7/19/2015,2.0,They actually have very underrated salads. Beer  yes. Atmosphere  yes. Hot and tired and need to duck in somewhere  yes you'll do fine. The pizza here is supposed to be one of their specialties. Sorry  not bad  just not impressed either.The wait staff was good  in fact very attentive. Yes I will go here  but I will be selective in ordering. This place is in a decent shopping district and could really blow it up with some food that was a bit more outside the lines. Unfortunately it is slight predictable and sometimes not all that flavorful. I am not saying not to come here  just measure you expectations for the mediocre.
Hanna J.,Dallas  TX,409,365,300,2/16/2016,4.0,I always come to BJ's when I'm not quite sure what I'm craving.Love their cream sodas. They come in giant mason jars. Alcoholic drinks are pretty average. I'm confident enough in my own cocktail abilities to not order them though  but they are pretty good. There's a full bar and a lot of options so you can't really go wrong!I'm usually drawn to ordering the fish & chips - the wedge fries are to die for  and I like the tartar sauce a lot. Their burgers are also good  and their salads are pretty standard. There is also a pretty good range of pizzas and pastas  fish  and healthier dishes as well. I think everything on the menu is decent - nothing amazing but you can't really go wrong. Price is a little high for what you get in my opinion  but there are generally large portions.Service is generally very friendly but it is hit or miss - one worker once told me I had beautiful eyes and it really made my day. Another server once forgot my appetizer order  which was definitely annoying. I let it go because I wasn't charged but just something to note.They play sports games on the televisions and have a good amount of seating  and a comfortable atmosphere. I think this is a good place to take a family for dinner  or a large group of friends with a wide variety of tastes  or an occasional date night.
Roger P.,Austin  TX,12,20,3,6/6/2017,5.0,One of our favorite restaurants  food is good  beer is outstanding and the wait staff awesome! Just about any restaurant can serve acceptable food  and many serve great beer...but few have a wait staff to equal this BJ's. They are the primary reason we drive 20 plus miles (one way) to eat there!
Tanmay T.,Austin  TX,75,17,5,6/17/2017,5.0,We went for dinner and were happy to see many options for vegetarian. Spinach filled mushrooms is a must try. They have descent thin crust pizzas and delicious pastas. Huge menu to choose from. Plenty of options for cocktails. Felt the quantity of cocktail is less for the price but it tasted well.
Melody T.,Las Colinas  TX,605,629,2722,1/4/2016,4.0,The pizza here is so good! If you are not into thick crust  make sure to ask for think crust! The thin crust pizza is super yummy and I love the BBQ Chicken flat bread! In addition they have 2 happy hours during the week. Monday-TR they have a late night happy hour from 9-11 which features their mini pizzas and a couple bucks off their cocktails! I love their chicken wings. I always ask for the a little extra crispy! Yum Yum! We had a pretty cool bartender that took good care of us!
Rich ..,Austin  TX,171,10,22,4/10/2016,4.0,A great place to eat with variety of choices...(I held back the 5th star ... we had a party of 12 and they were reluctant to seat us until more showed up  making us feel uncomfortable about even asking ... we were done with waiting in the doorway)
Cher E.,Austin  TX,69,133,45,2/14/2017,5.0,"We\'ve visited this BJ\'s location more than six times over the past two years and the food is always great. I\'m writing this review today because I went into this location yesterday with one of my girlfriends who was visiting from out of town to celebrate my birthday. Our server  Kelby was so patient and awesome. I was having trouble picking an entree and she asked me what I had taste for. I told her  ""Something crunchy  fresh...and healthy."" (I had indulged in junk food a little too much over the previous week  so I was craving something more healthy.) She suggested the salmon pita tacos with the quinoa side salad. I obliged and I am so glad I did! That dish satiated my palate gloriously :) As if that gesture wasn\'t yelp worthy on it\'s own  the manager  Desmond (whom I see there often and is always so cheerful and pleasant to the guests) came over  asked us what we were celebrating and I told him it was my birthday. He offered to bring us two prosecco in champagne flutes with strawberries in them. I hesitated initially because of my aforementioned indulgences of the week prior but he assured me that I would like it so we accepted. All was well and I will of course be visiting this BJ\'s location again soon."
Nat P.,Austin  TX,70,114,35,5/27/2016,4.0,"On 1st and 3rd Tuesdays of each month  I\'ll take my nephew out to dinner and I\'ll let him choose the restaurant. I\'ll ask him  do you want ""Chinese  Japanese  Mexican ..."" and before I can finish  he will scream in Trump-ian fashion  ""No  I want White People."" By that he means ""white people food "" and by that he means ""BJs."" Nothing defines WPF more than this restaurant. Delicious boneless  spiceless  souless  flavorless  fresh from frozen  3000-calorie delights are this chain\'s specialty. My nephew\'s young taste buds love it and since my own tastes buds never evolved from my mother\'s TV dinners from the 60s  I love it too. I highly recommend the potato skins  which taste way better than the ones at Cheesecake Factory. They are fully loaded and a true gut buster.My only complaint is the restaurant name has put me in an awkward position. My nephew has occasionally asked me  what\'s BJs mean? And since I don\'t like to lie  I\'ll have to say   ""Son  it refers to something two or more adults do to show they love each other and that\'s all I can say until your 18. Now finish your fried turkey sandwich and fries."" Then he stuffs his face and crisis is adverted."
Susan A.,Georgetown  TX,21,49,84,8/27/2016,4.0,My husband and I had our first experience eating at BJ's Brewhouse the other evening. We enjoyed our 1st time there so we will have to go back and check it out again. My husband had their homemade Rootbeer and I sampled some of their micro beers... which were awesome!! We ordered a pizza and calamari... Both were delicious!!
B L.,Manor  TX,0,22,5,3/24/2017,5.0,Just after the lunch crowd around 1:40  waitress very attentive food and drinks very good. Will be back to this in round rock. Hope I get the same waitress service was great.
Terri J.,Austin  TX,305,419,2276,11/5/2014,4.0,"I\'m not a huge fan of chain restaurants  especially because there are so many amazing locally owned restaurants in town. However  when I\'m looking for a high protein low calorie option  I will usually go to BJ\'s if my friends insist on going out when I\'m trying to ""behave"". Their enLIGHTened menu suits my purpose.Today I tried the cherry chipotle glazed salmon. Holy crap was it good. I substituted veggies for the cous cous. It comes with asparagus  which I love. But the asparagus was really dry. That\'s a crime. The veggies were a bit undercooked  but still ok. What I liked about this lunch was that they have a secret list (if you ask for it) that shows the calorie  fat  sat fat  sodium  carbs  fiber & protein content of all their menu items. I was considering the lemon thyme chicken  but omg way way way too much sodium. That\'s a shame.I\'ve eaten here on several occasions and their veggies are usually pretty good. Today was an off day. When I\'m not behaving  their pizookies are sooooo good. But I\'m still mad that they discontinued the red velvet pizookie. It was divine."
Elyse L.,Euless  TX,593,673,1971,11/15/2014,4.0,BJ's is a chain I can count on when I'm hungry and need a place I know will be consistent and have something both my husband and I enjoy. I always get the thai chicken mango salad off their enlightened menu but decided to switch it up and try something new today. I got the mediterranean chicken pita tacos and they were really good! So filling that I couldn't finish it. Two come on the plate with diced chicken  cucumber  tomatoes  feta  and a greek yogurt sauce that tasted exactly like sour cream. I thought they were fine without it. It's also served with 'bistro grains'. I couldn't tell if the grain was barley or farro but I did catch the red quinoa  corn  and black beans and thought they went well together.My husband surprised me by ordering off the enlightened menu too  but he got the bison burger that came with slaw and he cleaned his plate. We like to share something on the small bites menu as an appetizer sometimes and tried the fried artichokes today which I thought were just okay. The dipping sauce reminds me of a ranch but more tangy and the artichoke bites themselves could have used more seasoning. I think the biggest advantage of dining here is their rewards program which gives you points for every dollar you spend that you can redeem later for free food. It costs nothing to get their card  you just have to remember to check in with it at the hostess stand each time you come. Download their app and that way you will always have your card number on you.
Justin H.,Los Angeles  CA,66,41,,12/22/2015,3.0,Came here for a birthday dinner for a friend. Servers were great and on top of things: so no issues there. I ordered a mini pizza and expected it to be a larger quantity for its price. However  I was mistaken. I paid about $10 for a mini pizza and didn't feel that I got the value for its price.I'd recommend getting a burger if you want to spend an average restaurant budget ($10-15). It's way more worth it.
Eric D.,The Woodlands  TX,187,78,35,11/15/2016,1.0,"I\'m not even sure where to begin...Let\'s go with the easy part first. The food  it is what it is and that\'s all I can really say. It was decent and not as flavorful as you would think a place this size should be. I had the chicken Alfredo with chicken... 5 1/2 small slices of chicken that is. The Brockley that was in it was way overcooked and mushy.The service... This girl has got to go. Amy DShe made me feel like I was in a diner. She walked up asking  drink? I asked her about a particular beer and she didn\'t seem to have a clue as to what I was talking about.As I sat there  I would look up and see her wiping The sweat from her forehead  wipe it off on her apron  then walk around refilling peoples water and taking picking their glasses up with the same hand she wiped her for head with. When it came time for the check she had passed me several times  never checked on me to ask me how my meal was  never refilled my water glass  (thank God). A manager finally walked by and asked me how everything was and of course I mentioned I need my check and a box for my food. The manager delivered my check and brought me a box. I put my debit card in the check presenter  she ran my debit card  brought me back the check and didn\'t say a word. She then turned to the table next to me and told the family of four ""I hope you have a great night  it was my pleasure and I hope to see you again soon"". Made me feel like I wasn\'t even there. The good news is  I don\'t ever have to go back since apparently a party of one is an inconvenience to her night. My total time there was 25 minutes  less than anyone else that was around me.And whoever is reading this  please do not respond and don\'t offer me a gift card to get me back in your doors."
Lee D.,San Antonio  TX,0,2,2,4/7/2016,4.0,Sort of overdue as we have eaten here half a dozen times now. The food and drinks are solid. Havent had anything yet we didnt like. The pizzas are awesome and always have abbit left for 4th meal. LolDrinks are good if not maybe a bit pricey other than specials.Service is usually good. Maybe a little slow at peak times or later after staff cuts. Always froendly and accurate tho.Good for adults. Though kid aafe  id recommend people NOT bring very small kids  as ots more of a grown up place.
Matt M.,Waco  TX,1,3,1,4/2/2017,5.0,I've been to this location a few times since I moved here and I love it!!! The service is exceptional and top notch!!!!! The beer is amazing and the place is always clean and a great atmosphere!!! Today I went here for a good lunch and a beer at the bar!!! My waiter  Josh  is great! I recommend people come here Friday and Saturday nights and then on Sundays for lunch to have him as a bar tender! He's accurate fast and good personality!
Kim H.,Round Rock  TX,6,4,8,9/8/2016,3.0,This is not a lunch place specially coming from work. The service is so slow that you need an hour and a lunch even if you show up at 11.30.There are a lot of businesses around this restaurant so they are serving lunch to a crowd and I get that but they seem ill prepared to do proper lunch service.On the other hand I've not really had any complaints about the food here. It is actually consistently tasty and the deep dish pizzas are the only ones worth mentioning in Austin that I'd go for!
Janet F.,Las Vegas  NV,0,14,6,2/2/2017,3.0,Our waitress (Hollie) was excellent. She was attentive knowledgeable and very friendly. The shift manager  Derek was also very good. The food was a 3 star as well as the drinks my husband has to send back a Long Island ice tea.
Benetta P.,Shreveport  LA,421,347,2835,7/11/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Decided to eat something different  something  new. Not my usual dishes. I ordered baby back ribs with big poppa smokers sweet money championship rub  served with BJs Jeremiah red ale bbq sauce  with a side of white cheddar mashed potatoes and a house salad with a thousand island dressing. The ribs were good  meaty  and I really loved the rub and side bbq sauce. I did not get to meet Big Poppa nor Jeremiah. I guess they were gone already. Improvement... After serving your guest ribs  give them wet wipes or a wet towel  something  we eat ribs with our hands  at least I do.
Josue M.,Austin  TX,48,72,56,4/15/2016,4.0,I know most folks cringe at the idea of dinning at a chain. It wasn't until my second visit that my brother broke the news to me. By then it was too late. I was already reeled in. By now  I've had multiple visits and a few happy hours with co-works and I can't find much wrong with this place. Regardless of your dietary preference  you'll for sure find something to satisfy your taste buds. They have a huge menu  so you won't find an issue in that department...trust me. I personally keep going back to the appetizer and small snack section. I'm hooked on their avacado egg rolls  ahi poke  spinach stuffed mushrooms  and the fried artichokes. You'll also find a full bar with their in-house crafted beers. Well...not quite in-house. They have 6 BJ breweries in the US that brews for their locations. I was a little bummed when I found out that St. Arnold's Brewery in Houston would brew their beers. It wasn't until I spoke to one of their brewers at Denver's Great American Beer Festival that I found out why. Long story short: Texas houses more BJ's Restaurants then any other state (35)  so they obviously need additional help from a super awesome brewery. Next time you walk in  I highly recommend the Nutty Brunette and Jeremiah Red. Cheers!
Amy D.,Austin  TX,823,1047,4364,4/27/2014,3.0,"Ohhh a chain! As a Yelper I am not supposed to like this place right?! Well if you are seeking a decent happy hour  a variety of draft beers and a health conscious menu don\'t be so quick to judge.I am a fan of their La Crema Pinot Noir  during happy hour it is $6 (otherwise $11.95). And when I am craving some carbs the happy hour (smaller portion) flat bread is just over 400 calories. The ""enlightened"" menu showcases 750 calories and under cuisine. Will the dishes knock you off your feet? Probably not but your tummy will be filled without hitting your pocket book too hard. Tip: They have a rewards program."
Elizabeth Q.,Austin  TX,628,27,33,4/12/2016,5.0,Really appreciate all your support with the Fundraisers and 10% of Food and Non-Alcoholic drinks going to our charity of choice - Capital Area Food Bank.Also  I really appreciate the Gluten-Free pizza being actually tasty and yummy!  Great place for Fundraisers and meeting with friends - my fiance and I will be back at least monthly :)
Kris U.,Austin  TX,505,894,831,7/6/2014,3.0,"The menu here is comparable to the Cheesecake Factory  with an overwhelming array of options in all categories: burgers  pizzas  salads  sandwiches  pastas and other American favorites. The main difference of course is that BJ\'s has a larger selection of beer (their own) and Cheesecake Factory wins in the dessert category.That being said  I\'ve never really found my ""go to"" dish at BJ\'s  until recently. The Thai Chicken Avocado Mango salad was as delicious as it looked on the plate: a very pretty affair with mango slivers  red bell pepper  jicama  greens and sliced chicken  topped with a generous portion of avocado slices and dusted with chili powder and sprinkled with pine nuts.Their beer is okay  with something for everyone on their standard list. Of these my favorites are the Piranha Pale Ale and the Nutty Brewnette  but your best bet is to go with one of their rotating seasonal or reserve beers for something more interesting and complex."
Christopher P.,Chico  CA,3,33,5,10/3/2016,4.0,The beer is ok without being great. Pretty typical for chain brew house. I first went to a BJ in Temple TX up the road in 2010. This one in north Austin is pretty similar. They have a nice portabello salad that is tasty and good for vegetarians  but not filling. Staff is always well trained and likeable. They had an imperial stout on tap last time that was very good  but it's a seasonal.
Elle J.,Austin  TX,30,9,2,6/25/2017,4.0,I have often visited BJ's on several occasions and I have found it to be a very good restaurant. I would have given 5 stars  but today was not the case. My family and I arrived and were seated promptly with no problems  as it was not very full. There were 5 servers at the door. However  after waiting 13 minutes  I put a 2 minute timer on  because I wasn't going to wait longer than 15 minutes. With the countdown on  we finally got a server. He didn't wait on us because of the timer  he saw from across the restaurant that we hadn't been served. He came over took our orders and we received our drinks as fast as he could. After he walked away  the manager came over and offered his apologies. We were calm  and the rest of our meal and service was actually quite enjoyable. We offered a thank you for his service to Nathan...our server...and out of his own mouth  he said he just didn't want anyone to leave displeased with their experience. So BJ's  this is a good employee to keep. He was fast  pleasant  and made the children's dining experience a good one. The food was good and no issues except the afore mentioned mishap. I'll one back but I'll always ask to be served by Nathan. A veteran of our Armed Forces  and a model employee (IMO)!
Catherine B.,Austin  TX,256,105,253,3/20/2014,4.0,"Yes  I know it\'s a chain. Yes  I know there are plenty of other awesome places to represent austin. Yes  I know they didn\'t brew onsite. Yes  I am aware I\'m giving this place a 4/5 stars. I like this particular BJ\'s mostly because it reminds me of a similar family bar chain based out of Georgia called Taco Mac. I also like this place because of the bartender Joe. Poor Joe has seen us in there a multitude of times and it kills me that he still has to follow the corporate ""script"" of up selling and whatnot. We know he has to. I worked my way through Chili\'s for goodness sakes and they\'d send out secret shoppers to ensure we were even offering the Presidente Margarita to every effing lunch patron  otherwise we\'d be written up. But I digress. I\'ve always been there for lunch hours where their beers are on happy hour lunch prices. Joe has always been the bartender and he remembers us and knows my adoration for their Nutty Brewnette  which is a poor man\'s version of my favoritism beer on the plant  Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar. He is always accommodating and can suggest the yummiest foods. Looking for something unique  opt for the bruschetta bites as a tasty palate driver before your meal. Their chicken tortilla soup is the jam with a fabulous presentation. They may go a bit overboard with the cheese  which  let\'s face it  I\'m totally cool with. I\'m waiting to try some of their more gluttonous options  but I know Joe will always steer us in the right direction."
James B.,Scottsbluff  NE,0,16,10,5/21/2016,3.0,Not my first time at BJ's. Good food  casual atmosphere  and great friends. We decided to go a little later (around 1-1:30) to avoid the lunch rush  but our waiter seemed to be a little put out that he had to accommodate our large group (15).Excellent variety of food!Disappointing service.Cheers!
Shannon S.,Irving  TX,51,162,186,7/30/2015,4.0,"I like this spot for a late night snack and sports. It\'s close to hotels  not crowded  and the staff seems to be nice. Either that or this very tasty ""Angry Orchard"" has me tipsy."
Ashley P.,Dallas  TX,67,6,6,6/17/2016,5.0,Great food. We had the fried asparagus and California chicken club and it was all good. Really liked our waitress the most. Ashley S. Had Perfect timing  perfect service.
Lucy T.,Houston  TX,82,62,60,4/17/2016,3.0,Went here because the kids in my family acts like there isn't a BJ in Houston...But I believe service was great  BUT our food wasn't as expected. My chicken Alfredo pasta was hard  I usually never ask anyone to redo my plate  but that pasta was not inedible. Even with the second plate  some pasta was still hard. Our server was very friendly and everything was out on time and orderly! Only thing to complain in the food. No one really liked their food  but my boyfriend. He got the dipping roast beef sandwich! So I guess that's recommendable.
Eunji S.,Coppell  TX,39,21,43,1/10/2016,3.0,The food is pretty average compared to other restaurants of this sort. I got the grilled salmon with quinoa and it was delicious! The portion was pretty small for the salmon but my friends got pasta and their portion looked big. The atmosphere is very casual so it would be nice to come with your friends and coworkers to just chill and have a beer.
Dana P.,Fresno  CA,169,467,20,2/28/2016,4.0,Usually not a fan of chain restaurants  but I really like BJ's restaurant. The food is good  the beer is excellent and the service is always good. Had a bacon-guacamole burger the other night and was reminded what a great place this is.
Corinna V.,Austin  TX,79,322,3,12/11/2014,2.0,"Every time I come here  this place drops another star. The first time I came to this location  it was a 4 star. I\'ve now been here 3 times  and it\'s at a firm 2 star. I\'m fairly certain I\'ll be staying away.The food isn\'t bad here. (It\'s not good  either  though. Very middle-of-the-road.) What\'s been declining on each visit is the service. The last visit  I was exasperated. While our server was pleasant in the beginning  it became clear that she was in a rush to leave  or possibly go gossip with her co-workers. My 2 friends and I were buying drinks during our meal  (and had planned on continuing to do so after the meal  as well.) Unfortunately  our server made it very clear that we were over-staying our welcome. (We weren\'t loud  the restaurant wasn\'t busy  and our server had 2 other tables  so it wasn\'t like we were holding her up from leaving.)Sadly  we were tired of her ""checking in on us"" and suggesting to-go boxes and stopping by to ""see if we needed anything else"" every few minutes  so we left. She missed out on the opportunity to make a larger tip that evening  because I know each of us would have likely ordered at least 2 more cocktails a piece. I think we\'re officially done with this place.If you\'re wanting a quick meal  this place will work. Should you want the opportunity to enjoy your meal and talk with friends  you\'d be better off going somewhere else."
Susan C.,Austin  TX,0,13,1,10/27/2016,1.0,Disappointing.  A steak sent back and still not right. Of course  cold vegetables when the still raw steak returned. Lackluster service. Lackluster food. Hardly worth it.
Linda L.,Austin  TX,0,14,,10/19/2016,1.0,The chef leaves on the woody part of asparagus  so that you end up choking and spitting it into your napkin. It is a safety hazard and an embarrassment. The rest of the eateries in town know how to break it off above the woody part before cooking it.
Wade W.,Austin  TX,0,11,10,3/29/2016,5.0,As always every time we have came here to bjs brewhouse (the north Austin location) we get exceptional service! This is one of my favorite restaurants in Austin TX. The food has always been delicious and the atmosphere is nice and relaxed. The beer selection is amazing as well. I highly recommend the Jeremiah Red draft beer!!! I wish the same could be said for the South Austin Brodie location but they lack leadership  their service is poor and they should take notes from the leadership of the north MoPac location.
Tasha B.,Port Saint Lucie  FL,0,6,2,10/18/2015,3.0,This place has a very nice atmosphere. Service was enjoyable  our waitress Diane was exceptional. The food fell a little short. It was just average. I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich at $10.95 was quite a big portion I just really didn't enjoy the BBQ sauce. One thing that will keep me coming back is the Pizookie dessert. They are delicious! I believe with the food being subpar yet the service being wonderful a 3.5 star review suits this joint pretty well.
Ivy D.,Pflugerville  TX,204,19,148,12/5/2015,4.0,the food is good ! nice serviced . i love the mushroom satted with spinach and baby pork. Beautiful place open until 12am . Abslutely be back !
Alexandra H.,Austin  TX,84,69,7,2/16/2015,4.0,"Okay  so I\'m a HUGE fan of BJ\'s  but this location the staff is a little disappointing... They bring all the food out at different times  and even though you say ""can you please bring the appetizer first"" they\'ve brought it WITH the meal every time... Also our waitress felt it necessary to reach ACROSS our table... More than once.The food was still delicious."
Brian A.,Austin  TX,179,11,,10/1/2015,4.0,I really like this place. Prices are a little high but their beer is good and the service has always been acceptable. Pazookies are amazing and always put me in a sugar coma.Definitely go on fathers day because they give you a really cool glass beer mug with the date on it.
Scott F.,Austin  TX,347,20,5,9/15/2015,4.0,Upbeat staff  consistently good food and a vast assortment beers & cocktails has been my experience at every location I've been to so far. The Arbor Walk location is my current favorite and a great place for a lunch meeting (if you don't mind a little noise).
Jacqueline S.,Austin  TX,96,100,24,9/29/2015,5.0,The deep dish pizza is good with a nice crust. If you have a chance to enjoy a weekday lunch try the endless soup and salad offer. Chicken tortilla soup is excellent. Much better quality than competitors. Friendly service every time. It does get busy on most evenings but I've never been disappointed.
Sophia P.,Austin  TX,15,83,41,1/20/2016,5.0,Never had a problem here. Staff is always nice and pleasant. Mr.Deliciousness always brings out our food with a smile and joke! Root beer wings & avocado rolls are pretty dang amazing  along with the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. My favorite is the SALTED CARAMEL PIZOOKIE!!!!! So delicious! They have a cookie  in a mini pizza pan (hence piz-ookie) they put 2 scoops of ice cream on top and have some caramel drizzled. Yummy.
Javier A.,Cedar Park  TX,42,6,20,9/16/2015,4.0,The beer  the food  the ambiance. This place has it all. I have never had a bad experience here. And go ahead and try the calamari. It's sublime.
Sarah S.,Austin  TX,0,24,,9/20/2015,1.0,One star is generous. I've been to BJ's in San Antonio  and the food and service was stellar. I took my family in Austin here  hoping for the same experience. Avoid this particular BJ's. I do have hope for the chain  though. To compare locations...In San Antonio  at dinner time on Sunday for a table of two we had to wait almost 30 minutes for a table- the place was packed! At this location  my family of 6 was seated immediately in an empty restaurant. The waiter disappeared with our IDs for an awkward amount of time because he was suspicious. (Why would we use fake IDs with our elderly parents at dinner at a mediocre restaurant??)Despite being the only table in his section  the waiter mixed up our drinks and entrees. The vegetables were undercooked and looked brown compared to the bright green featured in the menu. The food was edible  but not spectacular tasting. Most definitely not worth the price tag attached.
Jennifer B.,Denver  CO,1029,1320,1778,5/5/2013,3.0,I completely forgot I even came here. In Austin for work and this was the choice by the group since it had a patio and was close. Nothing wrong with BJ's just nothing memorable either. I had a cold beer and a BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad (a safe bet). Salad was good with fresh ingredients. Other entrees I saw at the table was the Balsamic Grilled Chicken  a White Pizza of some kind and a veggie burger. All looked pretty good. You will receive good service  solid food Americanized style with little creativity and lack of flavor usually. I like to support local businesses so this is not on the top of my list for returning. If you're on a business trip and looking for a place that will appeal to everyone this would fit the bill.
Rochelle R.,Austin  TX,51,29,38,8/20/2015,4.0,This place is yummy. No wait in line. Service is fantastic. Quick. Friendly. Great presentation. The stuffed mushrooms and potato skins were some of the best I have ever had.
Violet O.,Round Rock  TX,1,25,2,1/23/2017,3.0,I've taken the kids here a few times. If traffic is bad on our way home I will stop here rather than sit in traffic. There's sports on the TV's  service is pretty fast and they give the kids the usual little coloring sheets to keep them occupied. The food is alright  pretty good. Last time we were here I put in the order for my kids food as soon as we sat down. Couple of minutes later I put in my own order. I thought this would keep them happy while I ate. However somehow my order got lost so my kids got their orders finished eating and I still haven't received mine. Management apologized and got my order out as quick as possible and it tasted fine but by then the kids for animals which made things difficult. It's probably just a simple oversight but it definitely made for a difficult evening and in the future I will be sure to place orders at the same time!
Charlie B.,El Paso  TX,17,74,154,8/26/2015,4.0,My first experience at this place was at the El Paso location  and I just wasn't impressed! The food was just not to my liking and too much on the plate! Fast forward to 2015 and my friend suggests this place in Austin. I noticed that the restaurant experience in El Paso and Austin differ from each other. Service was fast  friendly  and not a lot of chatter from the server  which I enjoy! I'm glad I came with my friend  because she is familiar with the menu and cocktails  she new I wanted healthy options! To start off I had the Twisted Spinach Salad  delicious with bacon crumbles  a light vinaigrette  and feta cheese. Next came the 2 grilled chicken pitas  never had this  and I loved it! I got so full  I was able to take the other one back to the hotel! It came with a side of some cold quinoa salad  very good  and I wanted more! The drink was also delicious  yes it had some kind of alcohol and strawberries  I just forgot the name. I'll be back  and I'll give the El Paso location another chance  3rd time a charm?
Mandy D.,Fort Collins  CO,481,59,277,1/24/2015,3.0,"The atmosphere and bar very nice. Comfortable to hang out in and watch sports if that\'s what you\'re into. Unfortunately  the prices of their mediocre food are jacked up under the guise of being an upscale restaurant. Most of the food probably is ordered frozen. They don\'t make a point to get fresh or local ingredients. I ordered a burger that was pretty middle of the road  and the slaw it came with was completely wilted.I appreciate that they include nutrition information on their ""enlightened"" menu  but it would be nice if they put as much care into the quality of the food."
Travis H.,Cedar Park  TX,10,15,2,7/15/2016,4.0,Went to BJs for our monthly team birthday celebration. Great service and good food. It is a chain but I would rather come here then Applebee's.
GG M.,Goodyear  AZ,0,42,6,12/22/2016,5.0,Excellent Food and service !! Had the salmon w quinoa and hubby had the rib eye..... both delish !! Service was above and beyond !!!
Riley L.,Denton  TX,128,175,58,4/9/2015,4.0,The beer selection is good and the BJ beers are almost all amazing. The menu is WAY too crowded and big and it's overwhelming  but once you find something you like you can always order it because everything I've had is great and worth ordering again.
Brett B.,Austin  TX,0,6,,7/6/2016,1.0,Getting to big for their own good  no pasta with our chicken Alfredo WOW. This place is a con. Recommended olive garden. UNREAL. even called to ask to add the pasta they said it would be an extra charge.
Sandy N.,Sacramento  CA,267,876,2176,7/6/2015,2.0,I ordered curbside delivery online. They were 10 mins late on my food. We asked for silverware and they didn't even give us any in the bag.n We didn't know until we got back to our hotel. Luckily  the hotel had forks for us to use.
Jacquelyn C.,Austin  TX,76,25,1,4/10/2015,1.0,"Will not eat here again. Came on a friend\'s recommendation... the decor was kind of upscale looking but really mixed and ill fitting. The menu had way too many items on it: totally a bad sign. They got steak  pizza  pasta  fish  you name it... which means it\'s all crappy. I wasn\'t terribly hungry so I got some small plates/appetizers  their ""gourmet"" macaroni and avocado egg rolls. Both were unappetizing  greasy  and nearly flavorless. The beverages are too sweet. The pizza was mediocre. The deserts were a messy abuse of sugar and chocolate. The host refused to seat us at a booth  when there were three booths open the entire time we were there and never occupied. The waiter was new but nice  but because of this service was slow and spent the entire time with our menus on our table and didn\'t order dinner until after we finished our appetizers? When I asked the waiter about what fruit was in ""seasonal fruit cobbler""  of course he didn\'t know. He went to his boss and asked  and came back and told me what ""seasonal fruit"" they had  which was melon  grapes  etc. I\'m like... that\'s a weird cobbler? He checked again and it turns out it\'s always a mixed berry cobbler. There\'s so much stuff on this menu that they don\'t even know what they serve! This menu could be cut down by like 90% and they could focus on quality over quantity.Overall  for not that much food for four people and poor quality food at that  we walk out of there with some ridiculous $110+ tab. We could\'ve gone somewhere decent for that much money! I regret the decision to eat there so much.Long story short  this is McDonalds level with a cruddy facelift. I don\'t know where these 4 and 5 star reviews are coming from at all. I wish I had my money back."
Sayeh K.,Austin  TX,6,12,5,3/3/2016,5.0,Almost 3 to 4 time a week I go to BJ's but in this week I been there almost every night because of the new chocolate beer  the best ever beer I had in my life  I am not a big fan of the chain restaurant but I really recommend it the food is great and tasty and this place has very nice atmosphere  nice service  the best thing is they are open until 12 or 1 am. Definitely be back.
Seon B.,Brooklyn  NY,94,266,343,3/15/2015,2.0,I like the south Austin BJ's location. My experience here was subpar. My burger I ordered medium well was well done  which killed it for me. The fries were decent. I had come here for acompany dinner and service wasn't the best either. A few other people had complaints with their orders as well. I won't be returning to this location hopefully it was an off day. I also had a frozen strawberry margarita  which was very very sweet. The corn fritters with corn aioli was tasty however.
Mike S.,San Antonio  TX,15,5,,2/4/2016,1.0,The food was okay  there are better locations. I went in around 7 and had the server by the name of Jesus and he was terrible. He barely said three words and never acknowledged us. I will not be returning to this location.
Jourdan D.,Seattle  WA,33,55,19,3/24/2016,5.0,I went here today to have a drink with my husband and I had excellent service from Sedrick at the bar! He was very enthusiastic about recommending beers for us and he gave us samples of other things that he thought we would like. We just stopped in for one drink and he still treated us like we were much appreciated clientele. We appreciated him! We also had amazing service the last time we were there. The food was delicious too! Those brussel sprouts!! Yumm!!
Bill G.,Austin  TX,50,169,94,7/24/2012,3.0,Stopped by BJ's real quick to have a drink and a snack. I've been here several times and the experience is just a-ok. Similar to TGIFridays  Chili's and Chotchkey's without all of the flair. Ha! Burgers are alright as well as the other appetizers. The drinks I've had have made me think about better drinks I've had at other places. Whiskey sour - OK  Margarita - Meh  Light Ale - Meh  Old fashion adult spiked cherry soda - Blah...they use Pepsi.OK  I've been here 4 times now but only for drinks and snax / app's. I will go again and have a real meal someday and I may change my rating. At this point though  I think someone may have to twist my arm to get me to go back. Maybe out of shear convenience. Good looking folks at happy hour is a plus.
Jesse W.,Dallas  TX,53,180,189,5/15/2014,5.0,Yeah  the lunch specials and the pizza.. Woo  It's a very nice place to go. I really enjoyed my time spent there.The atmosphere was really nice  calm and very well done. The service was very attentive  professional demeanor  and well groomed. Very enjoyable
Theresa H.,Pflugerville  TX,6,6,,5/27/2016,1.0,My husband and daughter in law and grandkids had dinner tonight. .first its really expensive ...I had the French dip and wedge fries....the sandwich was terrible and the fries were dry and cold...we won't be back!!!!
Quinn M.,Allen  TX,39,2,14,2/20/2015,1.0,Overall slow service here. I have been to locations in Plano with great service and food. Although it has been some time since I have been to BJ's  I was baffled to find the pizza I ordered did not come with pizza sauce. I was expected to order it separately from my pizza. Pizza doesn't come with pizza sauce. That is cheesy bread. Below average cheesy bread. Very confused why pizza would be called 'pizza' on the menu without pizza sauce.
Jeff L.,El Granada  CA,32,278,9,4/2/2015,3.0,This is exactly what you know it will be  McDonalds of Brew Pubs. But I can say that the service was great  the waiter refilled our glasses a million times with ice tea. I had a bowl of chili that was a 2 1/2 out of 5 but I had the Kale salad and it was pretty darn good. I had it before at BJ's and this was a little better than other locations. My partner had a pizza and said it was pretty tasty but he's from Colorado so he doesn't now pizza. I think that the burger is probably the best choice for lunch but I wanted a salad.
Daniel F.,Nederland  TX,0,23,3,7/21/2015,3.0,This place does everything well  but nothing amazing. The variety is huge and the service was above average. However  at the end of the day  it just feels like every other middle class American food chain restaraunt.I could see stopping here for a quick meal  but with so many other unique places nearby  this isn't the first place you should consider.
Paola V.,Jersey City  NJ,7,43,20,10/24/2014,1.0,"If you\'re going to have condescending waitstaff  at least make sure your food is on point. A group of us went last week and our server managed to:-ID ONLY the females in the group (even though the males were younger and everyone ordered alcohol)-Question why some of us ID\'ed females had out of state licenses (If you can believe this not everyone\'s exes live in Texas)-Question beer selection (""Why did you order that one? It isn\'t your favorite IPA is it?"")-Mess up a side salad order (Third time\'s a charm  right?)-Mislead about mac & cheese not being instant/out of the box when asked (Disclaimer: the mac and cheese is the same you can buy from a grocery store but we shouldn\'t have trusted our server when her description was ""Uh  it\'s NOT Kraft."")-Not inform us that BJ\'s does not do ""floaters"" for their drinks and charged double when a cocktail was ordered with a floater.BJ\'s  you try too hard with your menu and deserve a fail whale medallion."
Julie H.,Austin  TX,9,149,73,11/7/2014,1.0,"Horrible. Waiter in training kept calling the men at the table ""boss"" and then had a condescending tone with the women. What the heck? Food took forever and then we were told by the gum-chewing waiter that our order was ""stuck"" behind a huge party. The salad I ordered tasted like a bowl of soggy  soppy lettuce. I think they made the salad early and it just sat in a warm spot for a while. The burger they brought me when I sent back the old lettuce was wayyy over-seasoned. I\'m a saltaholic and I couldn\'t eat it. I seriously want my 2 hours back. Never again."
N S.,Bentonville  AR,0,24,,2/16/2016,5.0,"Honey crisp salad is wonderful and chicken fried steak is great and crispy with very tasty mashed potatoes and gravy. We didn\'t care much for the queso. It was kinda grainy and not very hot temperature wise but we did not tell our waitress. Her name is Ashley M and she is absolutely one of the best waitresses we\'ve ever had. Very attentive to our needs and friendly. I love that she never responded ""no problem"". She noticed that the chicken fried steak didn\'t have much gravy on it and asked if she could bring more. Ask for her."
John H.,Bastrop  TX,103,21,1,5/25/2015,4.0,"Like the ppl who ""dont get"" the 4 and 5 star reviews  i ""dont get"" the 1 star reviews when your only complaint was about 1 thing(incompetent server) or you got 1 app(greasy etc). I have never had bad food here  beer is always decent to great  but will admit that the servers can be spotty. But overall  i have great meals and drinks at this venue. Since its opened i go there at least 2 or 3 times a year(live in bastrop  hard to get to austin and way too many venues to eat at lol) But i have had the loaded baked potato which was awesome  my friend had the salmon which he loved on my last visit. I was able to introduce my buddy to great beers as well and watch the Rangers game so he wouldnt miss it. In the past ive also had other dishes that were really good  never bad. They used to have a decent chicken parm  which i was suprised at since there are some so called italian restaurants in austin that cant get even spaghetti right. (but of course there are others that are amazing!) So the only thing that is hit or miss for us anytime i go can be the servers. This visit it was a particular bartender that wouldnt talk directly to us while she was doing something below the bar so we couldnt hear her repsonses or questions clearly. She ended up leaving about halfway through dinner and was replaced by a pair of super friendly bartenders  a guy still learning and a woman that was just delightful  witty and charming.  Overall a great visit  yet again. always averages 3.5 to 4 stars in my book."
Leslie U.,Austin  TX,146,59,292,1/29/2014,5.0,I would eat at BJ's multiple times a week if I could afford it. I have eaten a lot of different things here and EVERYTHING is delicious. With their multiple page menu  you can get something completely different every time you go and trust that you will love it.3 words: FRESH BREWED BEER!Love their reward program  you get a point for every dollar you spend each visit. You can either use points at each level you reach or save them up to get more money off your meal or even use them for a fancy dinner or auctions they have.
Kim S.,Pflugerville  TX,79,291,27,1/9/2014,3.0,This  I think  is my second time here. I ate here with Martie H. She ordered a strawberry martini and had to send it back--it was horrific. bleck!! I had some potstickers that were pretty yummy--but really...again...how difficult is it to make a potsticker? I don't think BJs is making them from scratch...are you???At any rate...I keep trying this place b/c it's by my friends' place and or by my office--I'm just never overly impressed with it. It's good for what it is  though...I guess.
Michael B.,Austin  TX,11,127,50,2/28/2015,3.0,Roast Beef Dip was good. Does it compare to anything from West NY? No. But it's good.Service was decent. Atmosphere was good. Getting to this place was troublesome. Will I return? Sure  I'll try it again.
Scott W.,San Antonio  TX,0,5,,10/10/2015,1.0,Usually love BJs when we travel. The service at this location was aweful. Had to get hostess to take my order since my waitress didn't approach my table. Food finally cameout and was cold and not that tasty. Not to happy for $15 dollar entrees.
Philip T.,Humble  TX,0,28,6,9/29/2015,5.0,We had a party of eight and received stellar service.  Ashley was always there as if we were the only table. Great Job Ashley!!!
Aaris E.,Pflugerville  TX,2,20,4,10/14/2015,1.0,"The evening of Monday  October 12th will mark my final visit to BJ\'s on Mopac. I was entertaining a guest from out of town and thought it\'d be cool as her home town doesn\'t have a BJ\'s. Boy was I wrong! We were greeted by the hostess and seated. A waitress immediately provided us with water and said our waiter would be with us soon. We were seated in the center of the dining area at a four top table. Additionally  a waiter literally swept around us. I mention the location so that you\'ll know it was impossible not to see us. 10 minutes later we completed reviewing the menu and was ready to order however the waiter never showed. There were roughly four other parties in the dining area (all of which had waiters). At 15 minutes in a family of five were seated. My friend finally became frustrated and left the restaurant stating how ridiculous the service was. I stayed behind because I wanted to see just how long this fiasco could go on.  At 20 minutes in as a waiter served the family of five sodas I decided it was time to speak with a manager. I explained to the manager that we had basically been ignored. He stated he was certain it was not the case; that perhaps we were overlooked. I then walked him over to the highly visible area where we previously sat. He apologized and offered courtesy meal cards as he saw it was impossible not to have seen us. As he went back to the kitchen for the courtesy cards he was visibly upset with his staff. I saw him admonish staff and could almost imagine what he was saying by the hand gestures he used. As soon as he went into the kitchen the staff (a group of four or greater) literally began laughing at him. When he returned I told him I what I witnessed. What I didn\'t tell him was that this was not my first  but second HORRIBLE experience at the Mopac BJ\'s. Because BJ\'s has good food  nice atmosphere and an extensive beer/wine menu I\'ll continue to patronize it however I will NEVER go the Mopac location. The first time I experienced the horrible service (actually no service) I thought to myself ""things happen"". The second time showed that poor service is perpetual at the Mopac location."
Steven D.,Austin  TX,0,20,,2/19/2015,4.0,Got a couple of pizzas with the curbside pick up option. Very easy process and very good pizza. I have yet to eat here  but I would definitely come here to catch a game.
Eric O.,Houston  TX,1,45,1,8/22/2015,2.0,"I cam here with a few friends after rock climbing for beers and some food. I had never been before and someone had suggested it  I was down for it despite the Yelp reviews.We sit down and order a pitcher  the waiter asks us for our IDs followed by ""This one looks a little young "" pointing at one of my friends. Now  why the heck do you feel the need to single someone out and say something so asinine and rude? That was completely unacceptable and incredibly out of line.Fast forward a bit  we get our beer and food. I got the French dip. It was fine  nothing too special  and the fries were fine as well. We got a pitcher of their Jeremiah red though and the beer tasted a bit off / skunky  but maybe that\'s how it was supposed to taste...Overall the service was somewhat slow and the food was OK. I was put off by a few other comments our waiter made throughout the course of the meal  and probably won\'t be coming here again.To top it all off  I got food poisoning and was actually out on a date when everything set in. For the next few hours I tried to play off the fact that I was purging myself in the bathroom.Service - 2.5 / 5Food - 3.5 / 5Experience - 1.5 / 5"
Brad F.,Austin  TX,69,128,57,3/1/2016,4.0,My wife and I eat here all the time and their selection is incredible. We have not had a dinner less than good. Salads are incredible but don't eat desserts without being prepared to go overboard. Incredibly delicious.
Sajjad K.,Austin  TX,9,11,,8/17/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Ernest the Manager and Jamison our waiter turned a potentially disastrous dinner into an amazing guest services experience. We will definitely return to this BJs!!
Joe C.,Austin  TX,468,339,1252,10/23/2012,3.0,"I did it all for the Pizookie.The gluten-free Pizookie!If you\'re going to review a place with a dated joke for a name  you may as well channel Limp Bizkit... *shrug*This is an easy 3* review. I don\'t mean it bad. Some things they do well  some not so much.Beer: Sure... 4+ stars. Plenty of selection. The house-brand seasonal is the best pumpkin ale I\'ve ever had. I guess I\'m just easy  because I don\'t care if they make it in house any more than I care that the cheesecake place down the road isn\'t located inside an actual factory. Menu: 3*. Typical large disjointed menu. The gluten free menu looks like a brochure for a timeshare  and half of it is salads. Yeah  I get it. Leave out croutons  and your salads are gluten free. Execution of Menu: 2*. The patty melt was OK  not great. The calamari I had at lunch seemed like it sat in the window a little bit. At another location  the calamari was great. Service: we liked. The work-lunch speed is good. Our waitress at dinner was helpful and responsive. But....The gluten-free crust pizza is the real deal. Wife declares it the ""second best gf pizza in Austin"". The meatball topping is NOT gf  but unlike some places  the pepperoni *is* gf. And since her fave pizza is 20-odd minutes away (plus time to find parking on E. 6th) having a place in the \'hood to satisfy her pizza cravings is great. And... Then there\'s the gf pizookie.Cakey (in a good way) gooey chocolate chip cookie goodness  topped with ice-cream. Wife even asked (like she sometimes does when she\'s impressed) if we accidentally got the \'regular\' instead of the gluten free. The waitress said she prefers it over the regular one  and I don\'t really think she was exaggerating for our benefitIron out the kitchen inconsistencies  and it would easily be a solid 4*+ place in our \'hood. As it is  it may just be a ""pick up in a pinch"" kind of place for us. But the call-ahead curbside pickup is simple and efficient.Or  we\'ll just drop by for the pizza  beer  and pizookie..."
Henry Z.,Austin  TX,450,139,3,6/28/2014,1.0,The food here was really good  but the service is among the worst I've had. When we first got here  I ordered a drink and when delivered  a significant amount was spilled and the server said nothing. Then our waiter refilled everyone's waters except mine. But it was okay because I still had quite a bit.Then the Caesar salad came and it had barely any dressing. I did not have any utensils so I asked for some along with extra dressing. I never got my dressing so just ate basically lettuce and cheese shreds.At the end still no one had refilled my water so I asked the waiter for a refill one last time. I still never got the refill. In conclusion  no utensils  no apology for spilled drink  no refills  no dressing  and we were neglected most of the meal. When the check came  almost everyone's bills were wrong and my whole table had complaints. Stay far away or hope for a competent waiter.
Monte R.,Austin  TX,29,256,5,12/11/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Like  ugh  what happened to this place  BJ's Restaraunt? My god  maybe the most massive downslide so fast in quality since Pompeii.When BJ's Restaraunt first opened  we would dine at BJ's a couple times a month. We would order ALWAYS order their DEEP DISH PIZZA (BBQ Chicken) and it was divine  some of the best deep dish I've ever had. Super thick crust  like two inches high  served in a metal pan  like it's supposed to be made. Always filled us up. Service was solid and prices were higher than average but I gladly paid it since the food was good.But we moved house and it had been about nine months since we dined there. But we recently got a hunkering for their DEEP DISH PIZZA and we returned ... and that's when the horror happened. We ordered the deep dish pizza ... and it wasn't deep dish pizza. Instead  it was served on a regular white plate and it was just regular pizza  like Papa John's  maybe a half inch thick. We were like totally confused  man. We asked our waiter like  uh  this isn't DEEP DISH PIZZA. There is no deep crust. No pan. The pizza is relatively average in thickness. And the waiter was like oh  yeah  we changed our recipe awhile ago and this is now the DEEP DISH PIZZA. Oh  man  the horrors! What a bad decision. We still ate it  had no choice. But we were still hungry afterwards ... a $15 dollar pizza  to boot.Also  our meal for our toddler  the veggies come out half cooked. Had to resend them back  ugh. Total disaster.BJ's has gone downhill. For $50 bucks total with beers  we left hungry and dissatisfied. Go elsewhere  I say.
Jason R.,Cedar Park  TX,59,17,10,10/20/2013,3.0,I'll start off by saying I'm not a huge fan of this chain. It's just the right amount of impersonal service to rub you the wrong way. The actual hamburger meat here was decently seasoned and had good flavor  especially when put against the other pricey burgers I've had up to this point. The lettuce was lame iceberg considering the price and stood out like a sore thumb  but at least it and other condiments tasted fresh. Similar to the burger  the fries weren't great  but also weren't that bad either.Overall this burger/fry combo was decent  but not excellent. If you were forced to go to BJ's and are in the mood for a burger you could do much worse. With that said  in Austin  you can do much better for much cheaper.Read more burger reviews at burgergauntlet.com
Holly O.,Austin  TX,37,21,4,1/27/2016,1.0,This is heartbreaking for me to write because I love this restaurant... My office took me here for my birthday at lunch time.... We sat at a large booth to the left of the door. The food was great! Our drinks when we could get them were fine but the server lol - oh that server was the worse her name I believe was Audrey or something similar but she was what made the whole experience horrible... Your job is to be a server and with her customer service skill set she isn't where she needs to be  such a rude individual to have a job such as hers.. One of my co-workers was even trying to help her out lol and close the menu for her lol and her response for that was we have people that we pay to do that lol
Carlo G.,Austin  TX,1,15,3,12/28/2015,5.0,"Probably my favorite ""Chain"" restaurant. I always get the New Orleans Jambalaya  and every once in a while I will try something new and love it."
Walker F.,Austin  TX,252,648,177,10/4/2012,4.0,So food and drink here doesn't contain ingredients you can't pronounce or have never heard of. Or cost a billion dollars for three bites artfully arranged on a plate. And a lot of times  that exactly what you want. I frequent BJs when I'm in the mood for good  reasonably priced food  and a lot of it. I love their P.M. Porter. It's nitro conditioned which I've never seen in a porter  and tastes more like a stout to me (though I'm no expert).They have a ridiculously huge menu  but I usually stick to the pizza (during HH the mini's are half off!) or the salads (huge). Other HH specials include $2 off apps  and $1 off beer and well drinks  and HH is 3-7 M-F.Can sit in the bars to enjoy a game  out on the floor for more conversation  or on the patio (not bad considering this location is off Mopac). Service has always been great here  and maybe it's just us  but manager often comes by (and once  with coupons!).
Casey S.,Austin  TX,110,176,155,9/10/2014,1.0,Went here today for lunch with co workers for a first time. Had a very rude waitress who seemed very uninterested in her job. My pizza was soggy and cold and my salad was warm? Not sure how you accomplish that. I ate the food anyway  reluctantly. I wasn't back from work for 30 min before I was in the bathroom hugging the toilet. Had to leave work early. All in all it was a terrible experience and I must say I will more than likely never go there again. I guess that's what a fellow Austinite gets for eating at a chain restaurant lol.
Debra R.,Austin  TX,10,33,,11/13/2015,2.0,"Let me start off by saying I used to be huge fans of this place  but that was back before they kept taking off my favorite dishes. I came here a few weeks ago and was very underwhelmed by the whole experience. We sat outside because the weather was nice  which i appreciate that they have a patio area. But this is the second time that BJ\'s has taken away my favorite dish with no notice! But I know I can\'t expect a chain food place to keep something that they don\'t want to  so I digress. Once I realized that I would have to order something else I decided to try my boyfriend\'s favorite dish  the fish tacos. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time  but the tortillas that the tacos were served in were disgustingly stale. I took one bite out of them and my teeth hurt stale. I would have told my server this and requested fresh ones or something else  but no one ever check on us after dropping off the food. Granted  our server had a large table that was nearby  but we never even received an ""Everything tasting ok?"" walk by. A manager even came by and talked with the large table near us  but never stopped to talk with us. So after waiting for 10 minutes and seeing no server  i just ate the now cold fish out of my tacos. Good beer. Underwhelming food and service. Don\'t think we will be back anymore."
Bobby M.,Austin  TX,4,56,17,7/13/2015,5.0,I don't know why this place has such bad reviews! I went here on a date and it was the best time. Marcus was awesome and weirdly enough helped make the whole experience tie together nicely. The Pizookie trio he suggested was AMAZING. Oreo cookie is a must.
Angela H.,New Boston  TX,13,21,20,11/10/2014,4.0,Handmade burgers. Toasted buns. Skinny or wedge fries. Meat very good. Strawberry Margarita delicious! Sliders are handmade patties too. Very good meat. Make sure you tell them well done if you don't want pink in the middle. Salted Carmel pizookie is delicious. Would have given five stars but waiter was lacking.
Charlet A.,Chicago  IL,0,5,1,7/8/2016,2.0,Food was tasty  but extremly small portions. My fiance had the bison burger and steak with asparagus and mashed potatoes. The burger and asparagus were flavorless. Our waitress must have been new because service was horrible. The waitress forgot to place our order so we were waiting for a long time for our food. The drinks were watered down too.
Al N.,Austin  TX,0,18,,7/3/2016,1.0,"Haven\'t been to our local BJ\'s in Sunset Valley for about a year and then remembered why we stopped going there; just had the worst hamburger I have ever had  very highly over seasoned and covered in grease. When I complained to the waiter he said ""must be the new cook as he messed up one for the next booth also"" so? Sunday evening at 6pm and very few customers  go figure."
Jacob G.,Austin  TX,3,13,3,6/20/2015,1.0,First instinct was wow this place is big and has a great menu. Very expensive but great atmosphere. The table was sticky  seats were dirty. Waitress was very informative however extremely slow. Got our appetizer  it was delicious. Then the food came out. My mom's shrimp scampy was so Spicy it was unedable  my dads chicken fried steak looked looked like it was fried in cold oil because it was dripping and my chicken Alfredo has super hard noodles. The manager came and tried to correct the situation however we were quite done with the night. Expected more out of a nice restaurant like that.
Danielle W.,Austin  TX,0,2,,6/19/2015,1.0,"Have you ever had a burger that was so good  you called your mom and apologized because the next time you see her  you will have to slap her? That did not happen at BJ\'s Restaurant and Brewhouse. I went for lunch with a coworker and it was a celebration for a promotion for me so I was super excited. I had eaten at the location south before and so I knew what to expect in regards to the menu and service. Well  you don\'t know what you have until it\'s gone. We sit down and wait for about ten minutes to even be greeted by our server. She did not provide a name. We were next to a very large table of people  maybe fifteen or twenty in total  but they were not rowdy or noisy at all. They had just finished placing their order when we sat down. After waiting for a long time  we finally get a server and are able to order our drinks. Five minutes later  we actually get our drinks. We ordered lemonade so you wouldn\'t think it would take that long but that is neither here nor there. When she comes back to our table with the drinks  we place our orders. We both order burgers  her\'s medium and mine mid-rare (I like my meat to fight me when I eat it). Then we wait. And wait. And wait. The large table gets all their food  they get drink refills  they get asked if everything is alright  they are happy. We are left waiting like Leo DiCaprio waiting for his Oscar. Finally  food arrives. HAHA NOPE. Not our food  the runner got the wrong table and then asked us if we are sure that that food isn\'t ours. Yes  we know that we ordered two burgers  not three sandwiches. After 50 minutes and no sign of the waitress or really anyone  the large table is paying  getting to-go drinks and boxes  and is leaving. We FINALLY get our food. The fries are hot and tasty. Her burger is fine. Mine is like a hockey puck of overcooked sadness. I also asked for ranch for my french fries and I am only assuming that the woman had to go to the elusive Hidden Valleys themselves as she was never seen or heard from again and I never got my ranch. I take a bite of my burger as I am starting to eye my arm with a ravenous gaze at this point but no  I can\'t eat it. I just can\'t. Waitress is gone. She finally walks by  attempting to avoid eye contact but I manage to get her attention. We place an order to go for my other coworkers who stayed behind  two burgers with fries. She then realizes that we have no drinks left  we had even drunk the ice that had melted into water. Brings back two drinks and then scurries away. Never once asked if everything was ok and never gave me a chance to say ""hey  I can\'t eat this."" Just runs like Forrest Gump. After eight minutes  she brings out the to go order. So they CAN cook burgers faster than an hour  they just choose not to. Gives me the check and then FINALLY notices that my burger is sitting there in it\'s entirety  gently congealing. ""Do you want a to-go box?"" I can\'t help it  I laugh. Tell her no  I can\'t eat this now  I won\'t eat it later. ""Was there something wrong with it?"" Told her that I had ordered mid-rare and this is quite obviously well done  then prove it by picking up the burger and tapping it against the plate  making the clinking sound of WAY overcooked meat. ""Oh"" and walks away. Never apologized  never asked if I wanted something else. Nothing. No response other than ""oh"". She returns with the check and said that they took the burger off the bill and then walks away again. I am a grown up. I understand that sometimes  things happen. Sometimes  burgers overcook and nobody notices. Sometimes  its busy and you can\'t get refills for a table. Sometimes  Mercury is in retrograde and a ninja just killed your pa and you have to work four jobs to support your grieving mother and you get to those jobs walking barefoot  in the snow  uphill both ways. Ignoring a table and not following up on them is unacceptable. Maybe management needs a more hands on approach. Maybe this entire restaurant needs a sternly worded Come to Jesus talk. Maybe someone will ACTUALLY APOLOGIZE when they are told the food is inedible. I know that I will never eat here or at any BJ\'s again and I will try my hardest to never even drive by this location."
John R.,Pocahontas  AR,316,319,596,4/18/2012,4.0,"For months  I stayed away because the name alone. Then I heard it was loud and crowded  so that gave me another excuse to not go. Finally  curiosity took over and I went here with someone who made me see Titanic 3D all by myself. Because I\'m only 25  I took childlike joy in walking through the revolving door over and over (sorry  dining partner)! We were seated quickly. I was pretty puzzled with the erratic decor  but it somehow works. Our server was excellent and on my next visit  I\'ll make sure to request his section. For libations  I had the Nutty Brewnette and it\'s pretty great. Being a sucker for mushrooms anywhere  everywhere  all the time  I knew that I\'d be ordering the spinach and cheese stuffed mushrooms. They were pretty standard  which means that they were completely awesome. We couldn\'t resist ordering the fried artichokes  and the dipping sauce was delicious. For our entree  we split a vegetable pizza on a whole wheat crust. It nearly had me screaming ""PIZZA!"" over and over again  because it was without a doubt one of the better deep dish pizzas I\'ve ever eaten. I want to talk about this pizza  eat this pizza  and eat this pizza while talking about it. It\'s good. BJ\'s is a good idea and I will definitely be returning. And yes  I did another few spins in the revolving door on the way out."
Harrison C.,Snyder  NY,52,249,57,2/14/2013,2.0,Disappointing given how nice other locations are in California. This Mopac location starts with a freezing cold lobby  and ends up with slow service which resulted in overcooked food.We went to BJs for an 8:30pm dinner and the place was deserted. That apparently meant that the staff had shifted into slo-mo  because it took forever for our server to take our order  refill drinks  or give us an update on an overcooked burger and dried out ribs that took almost 45 minutes to get to the table.That time of night must mean the graveyard shift  because the place was out of most of the salads.Very disappointing food  inexplicably cold interior  and slow service.
Wes O.,Austin  TX,875,885,14,3/5/2012,5.0,"Imagine an upscale brewpub/sports bar with a menu approaching the variety of the Cheesecake Factory  but with excellent food. That describes my trip to BJ\'s last night.With the expanisve menu  we asked our waitress  Christina  for her recommendations. She was candid about the strengths of the menu  which were especially helpful with our appetizers. Both the meatball appetizer and the fried cheese were excellent. My dinner of the BBQ beef sandwich was excellent. The fried onion strings on top of it may have been the best onion strings I\'ve had in ages. The BBQ sandwich was more like a great roast beef sandwich slathered in BBQ sauce  reminding me of Jason\'s Deli\'s ""Deli Cowboy"" sandwich back when they served it.All in all  a very pleasant dinner surprise that I look forward to revisiting."
Jack N.,Austin  TX,240,351,37,2/13/2012,4.0,"We had a nice little meal here after running errands. In fact  the only way I agreed to run errands  much less brave the horror that is Arbor Walk  was to be able to stop somewhere for a bite and a brew.Veek suggested BJs  and after a short moment of considering the possibilities of what she meant  I agreed that the brew house would be fine. I wanted to try it  I had only been to a BJs one other time and it was fine  if not remarkable.We\'re trying to eat a bit healthier and one tactic is portion control  so a lot of times we split items  We both ordered a bowl of soup (pro tip - their ""small\' soup is well over a cup and plenty unless its your main meal)  but we split a burger. Lest you start worrying about our sanity  we did also split a pitcher of their house made hefeweizen. Calm down  we\'re old but not senile.The forced patter of the wait staff is somewhat off-putting: ""Would like you try one of our appetizers such as XYZ"" and ""Would you like something to drink  perhaps one of our signature cocktails such as the ABC""..... but our server was prompt  friendly and efficient. Really  hard to fault her for the ridiculous policies of the restaurant. It sounds for all the world like they took it right out of ""Office Space"".Food was good  beer wasn\'t bad  and service was fine. So BJ\'s is a viable option if you\'ve found yourself in that version of Hell named Arbor Walk. i suggest that you let your shopping partner loose to hunt and gather while you sit at the bar at BJs and chill out."
Jim L.,Austin  TX,0,5,,11/30/2015,2.0,On the recommendation of a friend  we went there last night. Let's just say it was a forgettable experience. The food was mediocre at best. The fried artichokes we ordered as an appetizer was overlooked. The entree mahi mahi was dry and flavorless and the creole shimp were tiny and the sauce had zero spice to it. Let me also add the prices were way out of whack for the quality of food served. The only reason it got an extra star was the service  which was quite attentive. Pass this one by.
Vinny P.,Austin  TX,0,11,,11/11/2015,4.0,The place has good food  it's a little pricey for what you get. But the food is good and the service is good.  The pizza is excellent and so is the tortilla soup.
Roberto E.,Austin  TX,38,23,11,3/13/2014,1.0,"Wow....honestly this place sucked from the time we walked in...The host greeted us  not by saying ""welcome to BJs "" but by asking if we had a rewards card. We said no so she told us to wait off to the side. After a very few uncomfortable moments of silence  another host motioned for us to follow him. The place was nice inside. Whatever--looked like every other bar/restaurant that seems to be popular nowadays. Waitress showed up promptly  asked us what we wanted  so we got drinks and calamari appetizer. The picture on the menu (hah  I know  pictures on a menu) looked pretty good. The menu was huge. I\'m not joking--the burgers were broken down into categories based on which piece of equipment you wanted it cooked on...not necessarily a bad thing...but strange. Everything served here is frozen food that could be prepared at home.Well--when we got that calamari...it looked nothing like the photo. It was $10  but probably had three or four bites of calamari. It was a very  very small plate of food. I never send back food. I work in a kitchen and I know how annoying that can be. But...this wasn\'t right. My wife asked if this was a normal portion  apparently it was. I told her we didn\'t want it. $10 is quite a bit of mula for a measly portion of food. Instead  we just ordered some food to try and hurry this trip up. We were both pretty ready to get out of there  but we were also hungry. Sadly--I think our calamari (which say on our table for awhile) was served to another table. Gross.Anyways--we get our food and it\'s not horrible. I had the jalapeo burger  which came with fried jalapeos. The burger had only a couple of jalapeos  but two different sauces...kinda weird but whatever. The Asian salad was alright as well. I guess the mandarin oranges and sesame seeds made it Asian.Whatever--this place just didn\'t do it for me. The staff was bad  the food was alright and the best part of our experience was leaving the restaurant."
Judy D.,Jenks  OK,0,28,2,5/17/2015,2.0,The seat in the booth was torn. The hostess was curt. But our server  Andy  was nice and the food was good. But I'd rather eat at a local place where the management cares about the customers and the atmosphere. Why wouldn't you repair a torn seat?
Martie H.,Galveston  TX,211,169,291,12/4/2013,3.0,My friend and I decided to eat here because it was getting late and it was close to home. They have an extensive menu  but not too many items to suggest a lot of frozen instead of fresher items. I expected something like Chili's and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't. They have small appetizers for people that want a small amount instead of a meal sized starter. Their prices are a little higher than I would expect for the items they offer  but not too high to be ridiculous. I had a specialty burger that's new to the menu and it was tasty  but quite greasy. My friend had pot stickers that were good  especially for a non asian restaurant. My one complaint- I ordered a Strawberry Martini and it was horrible!! I asked the server to take it back and she said no problem  that it was a drink that is returned 9/10 times.
Sadia H.,Austin  TX,22,33,9,7/2/2014,1.0,This place has a great atmosphere and is pretty  but that is all. Yes this is a chain but I was incredibly disappointed at the low quality food.I ordered the house salad which came out as a tiny portion and dripping with excess balsamic dressing. My entree of angel hair pasta with vegetables was extremely bland and badly cooked  the angel hair pasta was in clumps. This was also a small portion.Very dissatisfied and I won't be returning.
Summer P.,Austin  TX,29,117,34,4/29/2015,2.0,Reminds me of Cheesecake Factory - big menu with nothing worth a darn on it. I got a pasta dish with grilled chicken on top that was 75% fat. I gagged trying to eat it. I doubt I'll be back unless someone twists my arm and even then I will probably pass. Don't waste your time.
Stef S.,Austin  TX,90,262,116,6/9/2012,4.0,Come on  admit it: you've chuckled at the name  too. Regardless  BJ's is one of the better chains out there. I like to think of it as the Cheesecake Factory for Men: both have ridiculously large portions for what you pay for and extensive menus. There's something for everybody when the menu is the length of a novel. As with many brewhouse eateries  I think the house beer is made so as not to overwhelm the food. I can't think of one that's really memorable besides the berry cider that they have  and that's only sort of related to the beers. The berry cider is like a fizzy pinky-purpley glass of fruity Sprite. It's fantastic. I haven't had a beer here that I haven't liked  but I haven't had one that I'd go out of my way to seek out  either. They're all pretty simple brews--no strong flavors or complex flavor combinations. So  I suppose they're good to sip on with food. The food and service at this BJ's are the bigger reasons why I'd come back. Service was attentive. Even when I've just ordered a glass of water because it was past my bedtime (hey  get off my lawn!)  they made sure that it always stayed full. The food is a bit less salty and processed-tasting than many chains and for that  I'm thankful. The salmon is flavorful  flaky and huge. The deep-dish pizzas--while not a true Chicago-style deep dish--are still fantastic. They're like big  fluffy cheese breads with fabulous toppings all over. Their take on the southwestern eggroll is delicious and not over-fried to the point of being greasy and gross. Overall  it's pretty tasty.
Laura A.,Pasadena  TX,255,518,14,1/3/2012,5.0,We were very impressed with BJ's and suprised of all the negative reviews. Usually when we go to a brewery  I have found I dislike the beers and end up choking one down or getting a regular beer if available. Of the four beers we tried  we really liked all four of them. The Piranha was our fave  followed by the Brewnette and the red. We look forward to trying all the rest of them.We got appetizers for our meal. I really liked the mozzarella & tomato salad  and for only three bucks it was a good deal. The sliders were good  and we got a large pile of fries for just $1. The stuffed mushrooms were good too. I want to try the thai wontons next time. We noticed too late that the appetizer pizzas were half off  so we will have to try that next time.Also  we wanted the dessert cookie with ice cream (forgot what they call it) but of course we can't agree on a cookie or the ice cream. They can customize it  do 1/2 batter of one and 1/2 batter of your other choice and whatever two ice cream flavors you want! It was really good and hit the spot.I really liked the ambiance of the place... dark wood  cosy  clean restrooms. We are looking forward to going back to try more beers and some different food!
Karen Y.,Mansfield  TX,6,10,,7/26/2015,2.0,I visited this location last week when a group of us were visiting from DFW for a nursing conference. Our plan was to meet for happy hour and then stay for dinner. The drinks were good but pricey. I have never seen a restaurant screw up appetizer orders so perfectly. One order after another was wrong. It was almost comical. Needless to say we did not want to risk dinner! No apologies  no service recovery  no acknowledgement of a problem. I suspect this location suffers from poor leadership. As we were leaving I noticed a clue. At 5:30 in the evening (prime happy hour time) the place was almost empty.I am a BJ's fan and frequent them often at home. However  this location will never see me again. They lost out on a dinner tab for eight hungry nurses!
Dan L.,Austin  TX,95,156,55,2/1/2014,5.0,Jessica  our wonderful server  I am so sorry we had to leave. You were great  the food was incredible  and thanks for getting my margarita frozen! I am sorry that the family with the screaming child ended my date night. We were hoping to try those spinach stuffed mushrooms but the child was just too much. You were great and I promise we will be back. Thanks
Emily J.,Austin  TX,2,36,14,6/30/2015,2.0,Great food  terrible service. Every time I go to BJ's  the waitress doesn't seem to know anything about the food and they have messed up orders on multiple visits. Today I saw my waitress taking to her friends at another table for 15 minutes. We ordered 2 burgers and it took them 45 minutes to bring the food out. It wasn't busy in the restaurant.
James F.,Austin  TX,0,81,,7/20/2015,3.0,I used to go to this location all the time. It was great. Always clean  great servers  etc. I've always loved going there. But something has happened. I went there on a recent Sunday in July  and was surprised at how this location has slipped. The floor was sticky  and the restaurant had a less than clean smell about it. I'm sorry  I don't know what other words to use. I'll leave it at that. The hostess who greets you at the door was less than friendly. Very standoffish  like she would rather be somewhere else. It wasn't even that busy. Our server seemed to struggle with keeping up with her station. She was nice enough  but I think she had too much to handle. As a place to go  I'll continue to go the this restaurant. But never this location again. There are better locations with better service. I wish this location would improve. I really would love to go back.
Lupita L.,Pflugerville  TX,45,5,,5/4/2016,4.0,Everything was really good   not the best pia colada I've tried but it was ok. They forgot to put the shrimp on my plate   i told my waiter and minutes after manager showed up with my shrimp for my jambalaya yay!!
Jennifer Y.,Austin  TX,479,1020,9457,8/29/2012,3.0,Great service  clean dining area and restrooms. Just make sure you check your bill for over charges though.
Thomas B.,Austin  TX,1706,114,2048,10/23/2013,4.0,"So many great things on the menu  I know not where to start. Probably my favorite is their Culinary Creation ""Parmesan Crusted Chicken."" It\'s even better (and bigger) than Cheesecake\'s Chicken Bellagio. And the Lemon Chardonnay Butter Sauce! OMG At $14 for a lunch item  it\'s great to share -- everything tastes great  everything gets eaten  and your wallet doesn\'t explode at the end! Everyone I know who has tried this dish has loved it. I\'ve posted some pictures of it. Try it sometime!"
Christine A.,Austin  TX,857,1067,1199,9/11/2011,4.0,"Who names a restaurant ""BJ\'s""? I know that most men are thinking what I think they are thinking when they walk in the door. The guys I went with joked about it in the parking lot. ""Great  I want one for dessert!"" ""I\'m getting one for an appetizer!"" Sigh. So initially I knew it was going to be a macho place. And it was. Many flat screen TVs are positioned high on the walls for optimum viewing. But  like many sports bars  music is piped in through the sound system so don\'t go to actually listen to a game. The dining room is spacious with partial walls separating tables  booths and the bar and high end finishes in browns  blacks and neutrals. Service at BJs is timely and gracious. Though the BJs were not.Beer is the star on the menu and beer is on everyone\'s mind. Other than the BJ\'s. For a brewhouse  the food is surprisingly good. The guys enjoyed a delicious Mediterranean deep dish pizza and the girls had salads. My BBQ Chicken Chopped salad with shredded chicken  black beans  corn and jicama was great. I love it when someone else does the chopping and I barely have to chew my food. I\'m lazy like that. I will be going back because hubby will want to go back. Not for the BJs  mind you  but for the beer."
Irwin F.,Warren  MI,0,272,5,2/9/2014,2.0,"Had a very disappointing visit.Auctioning off food ""who had the....."" was a common phrase from the servers working our large group. No one came around to ask how things were or if the dishes were fine.The food was hit and miss. Some dishes were solid but others were not.The appetizers were just warm and cocktail service was ""beg and hope"" someone sees you and helps you.Spend your $ elsewhere - as this place seems to go through slow and unproductive motions."
Mindy T.,Austin  TX,49,32,2,1/24/2015,5.0,So packed on a Friday  of course. My boyfriend and I didn't wait too long though cause I caught a seat that was free. :) anyways sat down and was quickly greeted by a friendly waiter! (Daryus) super cool and funny. Anyways since it was super busy our food too about 30 minutes to come out. 30 minutes was worth the wait! The food was prepared excellent and was executed nicely and how it should be. I loved how much food there were for only $21. 2 filling sides and a big sized rib. So I had to take it home. Usually I get the pazookie dessert  didn't have enough room:( but I can tell you it's absolutely delectable. The brownie is hot and ice cream on top melting is so yummy.
Nathan I.,Austin  TX,1934,455,3203,8/1/2011,4.0,"When Dillard\'s has an extra 40% off sale  you can bet I set aside the day to expertly comb over the Ralph Lauren merchandise to find all the best deals. I\'ve never served in the armed forces  but this task is completed with military precision. However  before I could make it out to Lakeline to complete the Austin Dillard\'s Trifecta  I had to refuel in a big way. I figured now was as good a time as any to try the deep dish pizza that N and K had said that BJ\'s Restaurant and Brewhouse was known for. I never guessed they had a revolving door out front  since I never really grasped the size of the place when viewed off MoPac. The place is enormous; a slicker  pumped-up version of other chain restaurants with the added allure of doubling as a microbrewery. And while not as easily parlayed into cheap puns as \'Evil Wiener""  don\'t think for a second the name ""BJ\'s"" didn\'t have me giggling a bit. I may have used one on Facebook when someone commented on my check-in  though (Gary: I LOVE BJ\'s! Me: Who doesn\'t?). My God  was it busy. This was a Thursday. You\'d think the damned Super Bowl was on the way everyone was packed in like sardines around the bar. A bar  according to K  that uses hundreds of bottles of top-shelf liquor simply for show. Expensive items just for show? That\'s so up my alley. My little electronic beeper even had a note that said you could call ahead to put your name down as you leave the house. I guess that was for the days when EVERYONE in Austin decided to show up for chow  and not just half of the city like I witnessed. The hostess said there\'d be a 5-10 minute wait  which I found suspicious when she told the same thing to three other people who came in after me and absolutely no one was leaving the restaurant. I sat down on the only free edge of a bench to ride it out  even though a charming couple was taking up the enter thing. The man made a token movement down to give me more room  but the chick decided to remain splayed out. Keeping it classy  I see. Once I was seated  the din of noise and constant movement didn\'t stop. Raucous groups of people were knocking back micro brews; a Paris Hilton look-alike and her super hot boyfriend were chatting; and three moms and about a dozen kids rounded out the table next to me. Apparently  BJ\'s attracts a lot of different people. I began with a Tatonka Stout -- ""A classic style so rich and flavorful that it was once the private beverage of Russian Czars....Beer doesn\'t get much more intense than this!"" It\'s delicious and tastes like Guinness. It also makes you feel you\'ve just drank a loaf of bread. It was an extensive menu  with token light fare. I started with the small bite version of the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad. On top of a nice presentation  the appetizer was surprisingly flavorful  with basil  red onion  Parmesan cheese  and a balsamic glaze that mixed beautifully. It\'s a nice  light appetizer to hold you over before a heavier entree. An entree such as BJ\'s Classic Combo deep dish pizza with pepperoni  sausage  and mushrooms.The pizza is brought out and placed on a raised platform. It was cooked perfectly--not too crispy  and not too doughy. No one ingredient overpowered the other  and the cheese and sauce ratio was spot on. They were a little light on the mushrooms  but the Italian sausage was actually quite flavorful  and not just greasy little fat pellets like they can be. The waitress suggested a size ""small"" for one hungry person  and the portion was correct. A medium could be split  and I\'m not sure how many people are meant to chow down on a large. Thanks to their flashy slideshows by the bar  I was made privy to the existence of something called a Triple Chocolate Pizookie: An obscene chocolate cookie made with chunks of Ghirardelli chocolate and topped with two scoops of double chocolate ice cream with Ghirardelli chocolate chips and a Ghirardelli dark chocolate square. Oh--it\'s chocolate  FYI  in case you missed that. I only ordered it because I love Ghiradelli  having visited the factory during a trip to San Francisco. The waitress thankfully informed me that this dessert came in a mini size. Thank God  because what was described above would have sent me into sugar shock before the bill arrived. It may have skirted the line of decadence and tackiness just a bit  but you know it was awesome. Our waitress was polite and seemed remarkably composed during what I can only imagine was a veritable sh*tstorm of activity. She and a couple other waitresses who brought me my food were all blonde  attractive  and somewhat interchangeable. No one missed a beat  though  and the service was punctual during the entire meal.I know that it\'s a chain  and it\'s a little loud and cramped  but BJ\'s pleasantly surprised me. I\'d suggest it to fans of beer  pizza  and those who don\'t mind crowds. At the end I was glad there was a revolving door. After THAT meal  you could have practically rolled me out.4 Stars."
Gary K.,Austin  TX,472,494,1855,10/16/2011,4.0,A friend and I went to BJs on a Wednesday night  we were seated immediately by the hostess and giving our menus. Yes the menu is large which is fine; I like many choices  no Boo hoo here!My friend ordered the grilled burger melt with shoe string fries and liked both of them. I ordered the Tuscan tomato soup bisque inside a large bread loaf of some kind with the top baked into a piece of garlic toast and a small salad  the salad was the standard side salad and good   the tomato bisque was great.Yes it is large place with lots of dark wood  I like it  no Boo hoo here!Yes the prices may be a little high  but food prices have increased just as everything else has  Boo hoo  if you can't afford it  don't go!The service tonight was great!No comment on beer I don't drink it  but it looks like they have a large selection.Would I go back? Yes  I will I want to try the deserts and the grilled burger melt and the pizza.
tim b.,Leander  TX,29,325,1,1/1/2014,3.0,three stars for the beer.Grand cru belgian - very nice and 10 pts ROHSome type of red - smooth and easy to drinktwo stars for the food.I asked our waitress if the Steak sandwich was a good choice.  She said that it was excellent. Well the interior ingrediants were definately good if slightly overcooked - but the bread was a little stale and dry. Not surprising for a chain but that worries me if this is considered one of the better things on the menu.
Paul R.,Cedar Park  TX,72,536,53,5/16/2012,3.0,My business guest spied the BJs restaurant as were speeding up Mopac to his hotel. He proclaimed that he loved this restaurant when he lived in Houston and that we needed to go there for dinner. Really  a chain restaurant noooo. But being open minded  I've never been there  and seeing that it was his treat I acquiesced.We arrived right behind a family with a couple of small children and I leaped to the conclusion that we would be seated right near them. Wrong  the hostess sat us in a booth by the bar and the ginormous TVs  cool. While looking over the menu and the interior I realized that BJs reminds me of the old 99 restaurants I used to frequent when I lived in Boston. A family friendly pub - restaurant with good but not great food. Well the service was very good  our drinks were always full and our appetizers and entrees were served promptly. My appetizer a house salad was pretty weak but passable. My dining companion ordered the tomato soup and he said it was great. We both ordered steaks and they were OK not great but fine. My medium rare steak was really medium to medium well but it was seasoned very nicely. My companion had a couple of their beers and he said they were good.Bottom line a good place to go with the kiddos or to have a few beers and a decent meal with the guys.
Kirsten A.,Austin  TX,171,26,2,3/13/2015,5.0,Have been to a few different BJ's locations and have always had a great meal! Enjoyed the California flat-bread the last time and this time was a delicious and healthy mediteranean chicken pita tacos. Refreshing  and gave me the feta fix I was looking for!
Kat M.,Redondo Beach  CA,666,725,342,6/2/2011,2.0,"My hubby and I have been to BJ\'s down south numerous times and enjoyed it. I decided to meet one of my friends at the new location for lunch. It took almost 90 minutes for us to grab our ""quick"" lunch.Here is what happened. I ordered the cobb salad and clam chowder soup. He ordered the house salad with a spinach pizza. When his pizza came  it was an artichoke pizza. They had to bake him another pizza  which took forever. I was eating my lackluster cobb (maybe my least favorite cobb ever) and feeling bad that he was without anything for so long.What really annoys me is that it was the waiter who rang in the order wrong and the manager knew about all of this and did not even comp my buddy\'s meal. What is up with that? Our waiter was super nice and we both did not want to complain  but afterwards we were annoyed. This was going to be our go to lunch spot  but now I am not sure.It would have been nice customer service to have offered him another house salad while he waited  or an appetizer... Or comp the meal. I feel like BJs handled this situation poorly.The hubby and I have never had any issues down south. Maybe they are still getting things worked out at the new location. Oh  and my salad came with the croutons I asked to not have. This experience has left a bad taste in my mouth. I hope management sorts these issues out. A weekday lunch should not literally take 90 minutes."
Tony H.,Austin  TX,81,269,53,12/6/2013,4.0,"It\'s always so hard to pick something to eat here  not because the selection is great  but quite the opposite. There is so much good food here. I stuck with one of my favorites which is the Fresh Atlantic Salmon. Its always sooo good and the sauce is amazing.My only complaint is with places that don\'t advertise their drink prices. I was a little shocked to discover my ""House Margaritas"" were a whooping $8.50 a pop. I\'m used to a house marg being in the $3 to $6 range  but to be fair they were pretty big. The waiter also didnt seem very attentive to us  especially considering it was a party of like 10. Oh well... I still enjoyed the food  drinks  and company."
Melissa N.,Austin  TX,6,9,,5/3/2015,1.0,Came here for lunch today with my family from Chicago. We were not impressed. Food was not what I remember. Pizza tasted like it was from Pizza Hut. Mozzarella sticks had no cheese in them. Mediocre bar food.
Chris B.,Austin  TX,340,374,26,6/15/2011,4.0,"It\'s big  it\'s loud  and it screams ""I\'m a big chain restaurant!!!"" at the top of it\'s lungs. But you know what... it\'s not a bad place. We had a large party of 15+ people and we waited less than 30 minutes for a table  which was nice. The hostesses were very friendly and more than accommodating when our party unexpectedly increased in numbers. It was a good start. Our server was kickass. He took orders efficiently  didn\'t mess anything up  and he was friendly to boot. The kitchen had a few stumbles and food took longer than expected but the Manager stopped by and comped us a few items (as well as a few birthday desserts!). We had appetizers and beer only during our visit  but I must say the apps are quite good. The beer was sort of \'ho hum\'  but it certainly wasn\'t bad. I would recommend the Santa Fe Spring Rolls  the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Piranha Ale Nachos. The desserts were also yummy. I especially loved the Baked Beignet. It was warm and tasty with ice cream on top. I want some more of it right now. So yeah  it\'s a big EVIL national chain... but if you ignore that stuff  it\'s a decent spot to grab some apps.  Pros: Very Nice Staff  Accommodating to our Large Party  Apps Were Good  Service was SolidCons: It\'s Huge and Loud  The Beer is Just ""Okay"""
John B.,Round Rock  TX,86,260,89,7/13/2011,3.0,I was very surprised at the quality of the beer and the fish tacos. Everything tasted pretty good  and I have no concerns with the food.Atmosphere was nice - I'm not sure about the oversized barn they call a dining room  but it was very nicely appointed with artwork and lots of wood. BJ's seems to be suffering from a mild identity crisis as it strives to be a grown up restaurant while still maintaining its bar feeling with many TVs. My only real criticism is the reception area and the service. They seem to have some odd computerized system that tells the hostess where to seat people. I guess that is easier than just counting on her to do her job with training. The waitstaff is hot-and-cold  and they still seem to be suffering some growing pains.
Anna N.,Austin  TX,33,65,143,7/22/2011,4.0,"I am tempted to give this place five stars to counter the unfairness of all the low-stars reviews from when the place first opened (teething problem)  or in extraordinary situations (party of seventeen!).We\'ve eaten lunch here half a dozen times  all on Saturdays. Food-wise  it resembles Cheesecake Factory: chain restaurant with a well-researched and well-developed menu with much varieties and very consistent. Of special note are the flatbreads (see pic)  and the tomato and mozarella appetizer salad (tomato  mozarella  lettuce  basil salad with a balsamic reduction dressing (see pic)  for $2.95!!!). The wings are alright  not outstanding (see pic); it\'s tough to go wrong using Frank\'s hot wings sauce. We\'ve only had the roasted turkey Cobb sandwich (see pic): it\'s good but probably not a ""keeper"" for me; the shoestring ries are great  though.The service is always just right  if only a little too friendly and too chirpy!I have not sampled any of the beers  yet."
Nikolas T.,Austin  TX,0,4,,2/24/2016,3.0,I did not appreciate tall guy (I did not know his name) who waited our table. He was impatient. I felt pressured to hurry to read the menu to order. It was only few minutes after I ordered a drink. He come over several times. I kept telling him I will be ready in a little while. He should have shown the courtesy to wait for me to call him over when we are ready to order.It took a while for pizza order to be ready. A cook came over to apologize for mishap with pizza. He or the cook staff accidently dropped pizza. And  asked me if we would like salad. I assumed that will be at no cost because he apologized for pizza mishap.When we are ready to check out  I looked at receipt. Charge for the salads were on the receipt. There was communication misunderstanding. After the experience at that location  I do not think I will return to that place again. The whole meal end up costing more than I expected with half off offer for pizza.
Jaime G.,Chicago  IL,124,515,965,3/8/2012,3.0,BJ's is a cool little place to have a decent craft brew. While a chain  they do have a decent selection of beer and food. Had the nutty brown and porter - both good options. For apps  we had the wings (deep fried and served with no sauce - wing sauce and ranch served on the side) as well as these decant avocado rolls. Really good.Would come back again. 3 Starts for good food but they are a chain.
Rob K.,Austin  TX,285,382,739,1/30/2012,3.0,"Went on a Sunday night with limited choices  so ended up at BJ\'s. For beers  I had a Harvest Hefeweizen (not a fan)  followed by a BJ\'s P.M. Porter (big fan!). For meals  my gal had an ""Enlightened Entree"" (less than 550 calories); specifically  the Mediterranean Vegetable Pasta. And I had the Santa Fe Salad.The pasta did not look very good  nor was it filling as my very yummy salad was being pirated by the owner of the pasta. The Santa Fe was a delicious and huge salad with just the right amount of heat (from ground cayenne pepper) for me.While not a ""have to go to"" spot  it was comfortable and I will end up there again."
Ashlee M.,Pflugerville  TX,0,3,,7/9/2015,4.0,Come here with my husband a lot for weekend meals or the occasional lunch--have probably visited about 10 times. The food is always above average and the service is overall good. My personal favorite is the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad . . . it has all my favorite stuff. If you want an overall good experience and a great place to get together with friends to watch college or NFL football  give BJ's a try!
Tina H.,Round Rock  TX,55,96,2,8/11/2013,4.0,We generally don't go to chain restaurants here in TX because we want to fully experience the food here just having been in Austin for a year now but BJ's is always a safe bet if you want a clean place with plenty of TVs to watch in the bar area and decent food. We often end up here if we don't have a specific craving for non-American food and just want something we can depend on and is close to home. Some of our favorites:- Fish and chips- Spinach and artichoke dip- Chips and salsa (something about their chips is SO YUM!)- Grilled chicken club sandwich- Buffalo wings (bone-in) with ranch- Jalapeno Burger with bacon- Thin crispy fries- Pizookie with vanilla ice creamThe service has always been pretty good at this location. Doesn't matter what day or time we come  this place is always pretty busy which is a good sign.
Scott T.,Austin  TX,853,244,632,3/30/2013,1.0,Atmosphere is cool - but the food is pretty bad - calzones are supposed to have cheese.. Apparently they do not know that here? Also  waitress laughed when I asked the difference between specialty calzone and traditional... Not to mention a rude attitude to begin with... Rather have given the 40 bucks to the homeless lady at the corner of the street leading into the restaurant.
Linda V.,Elgin  TX,34,5,,6/4/2015,1.0,They have the worst steaks. My medium rare steak came out blackened and well done. They did not resolve my issue and I ended up eating a baked potato for dinner.
Eric G.,Norwalk  CA,43,16,,11/3/2014,2.0,Don't come here if you are picking up an order. This is the 3rd time my order has been wrong. This time they really messed up. The turkey burger sucks especially with the lack of tomato mustard mayonnaise and pickles that were suppose to be on it. They didn't even have the bake potato ready with my food so I had to wait for it. meanwhile my food got really cold but I was too hungry to make a big deal about it.
Andrew H.,Austin  TX,39,13,,3/4/2016,1.0,I sat at the bar once and a server come up and crowded me to flirt with another person at the bar. When I tried to say something to management when I was leaving the guy the server was flirting with got right in my face and threatened me and the staff just stood there and watche.
Nick M.,Medford  MA,0,11,,5/25/2015,5.0,Great food  great beer  great service. We had Marlie at the bar  she was courteous  prompt with service  and knowledgable about the many beers on tap. Of course  she also allowed us to sample beers before buying a full pint.The meal - pork chops with home made mustard - was excellent  the best meal I had in Austin during a recent week long business trip to the area.
MacKenzie M.,Bossier City  LA,35,4,,4/6/2015,4.0,Got take out last night pretty late and even though it was late and they were probably all tuckered out from a busy easter sunday  they were still in great spirits and the take out presentation was phenomenal. Plus  everything tasted great. Will be back!
Barry C.,Georgetown  TX,87,328,,7/15/2011,5.0,Just for happy hour. Fast review  great service for a table of 16  good drinks and an amazing mini pizza for half price.It was packed from the time we got there(5:30) till we left(8:00)  so you might have to wait to get a table or even a seat at the bar.
Ryan B.,Austin  TX,30,38,,8/18/2013,1.0,"Used to be an ""OK"" place  maybe three stars when they first opened. Went there last week for the first time in a year and a half since I moved back from South Carolina  pretty sure my dog was happier with her lunch that I left in her bowl.Ordered the half pizza/salad  pizza was stale and disgusting  salad was severely underdressed. Seems like they are pinching and being a bit more cheap these days than in the past.Oh well  another stain chain."
Lauren F.,Montgomery  TX,59,158,31,10/1/2013,3.0,We come because of the beer. The food is decent. This is your typical overpriced restaurant that serves pre-made food. The menu is gigantic. They offer so many entrees and appetizers. No way any of it is fresh. I can't say that they have one thing that stands out more than anything else. The beer is really good. They also brew seasonals  which is fun.
Danielle Z.,Austin  TX,50,81,15,7/6/2011,4.0,"I\'ve been to the south BJ\'s location before (and one in Colorado) but I really enjoy this north one more for some reason. My girlfriends and I went on a random Thursday around 6:45pm. The restaurant was surprisingly full  all the bar tables were full  and there was about a 10 minute wait to be seated which wasn\'t bad at all. We were promptly taken to our table which wasn\'t a booth but didn\'t feel like we were exposed like it sometimes feels when you\'re in the middle of a dining room.Our server was a little soft spoken but  in my opinion  hit all her marks in offering drinks  apps  etc. The girls and I were in the ""trying"" mood so we opted for quite a few things! Oh and we were there in time for happy hour which were a few bucks off beers and cocktails but none of that struck our fancy that time.First  we got a sample of the Berry Cider (hard cider!) and decided to get a pitcher of that. It was very delicious and tasted like berry champagne actually!Then we shared the appetizer sampler of mozzerella sticks (standard)  spinach and artichoke dip with tortilla chips (actually very very tasty)  avocado egg rolls (not bad)  and the santa fe egg rolls (yummy). The menu is very extensive but all looked great! I would find it hard to believe if someone didn\'t find something they liked here. So  our app plates were all cleared away and it actually took a little while for our entrees to come out but it wasn\'t too long that anyone said anything- but I know the girls were all thinking it too. I got the fish and chips which were tasty but were a little over fried (they were fried past the golden color and were a little more brown). I opted to try both fries- the thin and the wedge and both were good. The wedge fries reminded me of the fries from KFC. My friend got the parmesean crusted chicken and white cheddar mashed potatoes and she really enjoyed it and said they were some of the best potatoes she\'d ever had. My other friends split the Mediterranean pizza and said they loved it as well. After our food was boxed up by the server tableside (nice touch)  we ordered dessert. We split the oven baked beignet topped with strawberries  whipped cream  and a side of vanilla ice ceam. We also shared the red velvet cookie thingie (the actual name escapes me) which was also topped with ice cream. By the end  needless to say  we were stuffed  satisfied  and probably had a pretty happy server since she probably wasn\'t expecting 4 girls to give her the ideal ordering experience from top to bottom! All in all  I liked the food  the atmosphere is high energy  and there were all sorts of peole- couples  groups of friends  families  business associates  etc. I\'ll definitely keep BJ\'s on my list of places to take all of the above mentioned parties when in a bind!"
Kristina B.,Pflugerville  TX,97,95,101,5/29/2011,3.0,I think I can like this place. The food is nothing spectacular  but it seems like it would be a fun place to watch a game. We first attended the soft opening with its short menu. I hated it. Because I am vegetarian  I had one option  the Asian Chicken salad minus the chicken. It was awful  but not because it was gross  but because it is not something I would ever even order. I did  however  fall in love with the mash potatoes on my boyfriends plate. I don't think I have ever had such delicious mashed potatoes in my life. So it was worth a second chance. I kept it generic today with the veggie burger and fries and yum! I wasn't disappointed. The portion was huge so I saved half for later. Boyfriend had chicken fried steak with the same heavenly mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. His plate looked good and he finished it all up  so thumbs up.We tried one of their deserts  I don't remember what they call it  but some sort of pizza cookie. A chocolate cookie + Ghirardelli chocolate squares + chocolate ice cream= Chocolate Coma. The desert was definitely decadent and rich  not something you can eat every day  but definitely worth it. Our server was nice  but not very helpful. I think we had three different people bringing our food and water  so we were never lacking anything. I can't really say much more about the service. Next time I go back  I think I will ask for a plate of mashed potatoes and maybe some veggies.
marc s.,Austin  TX,96,149,15,2/20/2013,4.0,Our favorite wednesday night happy hour spot. If you just order whatever  you'll get what you get. But . . . here's the rules1. Tatonka Stout: unbelievably good with a 9% alcohol kicker  if they happen to be out (rarely) so are you2. Flatbread pizza: goat cheese is excellent as well as the more traditional types3. Pizookie: chocolate is excellent.For happhour  2 Tatonka  flatbread pizza  shared pizookie and generous tip runs you $20.Hit these 3 and I dare you not to be happy. If you order anything else  it's russian roulette.
Son N.,Houston  TX,145,84,800,6/13/2013,3.0,BJ's love the name but when I walked in it was a letdown of sorts...It's clean  the bartender was nice but there's just something that screams mediocrity. When I walk in the feeling of a forced hello is deposited on my ear drums. Perhaps they were having a bad day but I sensed no feeling of joy.I had their version of Guinness at the bar and felt ok with it. Nothing too bad but it wasn't great. I ordered a burger and it was ok as well.This place is good but not great. But oh well... it met the minimum requirements. A-OK indeed.
Biswajit G.,Austin  TX,0,4,,3/4/2015,1.0,Pathetic service   spent $100 on food  but neither the food nor the service was worth it !! Will never visit or recommend.
Steve W.,Round Rock  TX,593,113,117,9/25/2013,5.0,Southwest Egg Rolls and Tortilla soup are outstanding! Great environment  Service is always good. Have not been disappointed at any of their locations so far. That is a well run restaurant chain!
Kristine C.,Austin  TX,36,10,4,4/11/2014,5.0,I go to this place almost every week. They're a chain  but it's much better than Cheesecake Factory. Also  there isn't usually a long wait  staff is very professional and food is great. I especially like their new Enlightened menu choices. The only place I know that has a pretty decent barbecue bison burger. My favorite is also the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi. It's also pretty family friendly for a brewery and bar b/c the booth tables are the perfect height for my 2 year old to sit without needing a booster seat. The rewards membership is also great for getting money off meals or free desserts. I recommend the Baked Beignet. It's hands down better than any of the pizookies they try to push on you.
Robyn S.,Austin  TX,64,18,,12/30/2012,2.0,"Sad sad sad. I used to eat at B.J\'s when I lived in Southern California and I remember the delicious food plethora of beers and the infamous pizooki. At the Austin location only the latter two survive. We ordered take away so this may influence the weight of the review but it was truly awful. I ordered the fried shrimp I got some teeny tiny chewy over fried shrimp that would be more easily passed off as Long John Silvers\' rejects (btw not Gulf shrimp either but farm raised in Asia)The ""boneless chicken wings"" looked like the chitlins at the bottom of the popcorn chicken pile. I think the salads had a single cherry tomato and half a slice of cucumber. My man had the fish and chips and it was the only thing in the whole order that was not completely deplorable but even it was soggy and greasy. Not bad for $50 huh?Save your money and just go for an overpriced beer and the pizza-shaped cookie thing."
Cody F.,Austin  TX,119,9,,1/20/2015,3.0,The food was great at this place but where we were seated the table was attached to the wall and was vibrating non stop none the least it was very disturbing but because of how busy it was there was nothing i could do about it. The first beer i ordered the glass was cracked and didn't realize it till the beer was leaking out all over me. wasn't 100 happy but will give this place another shot sometime soon.
Kalanit K.,Austin  TX,0,10,3,1/12/2016,1.0,terrible service. Food was nasty. Took forever to get our food and some of it was cold (chicken  pizza) . We had to ask someone to heat it up. thought BJs was a great place before this....
Kiwe M.,Cedar Park  TX,6,41,6,8/8/2012,1.0,"People with Food Allergies Beware! My daughter and I went to BJ\'s to get some lunch - we are both allergic to egg. So before going I looked up their food allergy menu on their website. I found something that said it did NOT contain eggs. When at the restaurant we told our waitress of our allergies and confirmed again the food we were ordering was safe.About an hour later we both start to get SICK!! Sick sick! I called up the manager of the restaurant - asked him to confirm that the food we ordered was free of any egg. He checked and came back to the phone saying ""it contains EGG WHITE"" WTF?With hardly an apology he tried to hang up the phone. I called him out and he then apologized profusely and offered a refund. Oh geez - thanks for my money back now that we are SICK! We will NEVER go back to BJ\'s and recommend that anyone with allergies or sensitives beware. If you cannot trust their corporate food allergy list or the staff - who can you trust.Terrible Terrible Terrible!"
Robert L.,Austin  TX,32,17,2,1/13/2013,1.0,I ordered takeout from here because I assumed for the high prices it'd be a sure thing. Wrong.My fried shrimp were tiny  hard  and nearly inedible. The boneless chicken wings were more like glorified chicken Mcnuggets and laughable considering the price.Oops. Won't make that mistake again. If I want subpar  dispassionately-made food in the future I can get it for cheaper at Chili's or Crapplebees.
Sue E.,Cedar Park  TX,4,17,,8/23/2014,1.0,"Went to BJ\'s for lunch for the first and last time with my husband yesterday.1) The food is overpriced  and low quality for what it is. $12.75 for a chicken caesar salad. The chicken was cold  which I am totally okay with  but the caesar dressing was straight out of a gallon container. It was too salty  and I\'m pretty sure it was poppyseed dressing and not caesar.2) My husband got clam chowder. He said the potatoes were hot  but the clams were lukewarm. The soup was not hot  and too thick. ""Pasty"" is what he called it.3) Inattentive staff. We waited forever at our table before our waitress came over to take our drink order. We waited nearly 5 minutes after that before our iced tea and water came out. The place wasn\'t that busy for noon  either. She never came back until it was time to bring us a check  which she did while I was still eating. She never asked if everything was to our satisfaction."
Charlie G.,Surprise  AZ,2,34,3,10/31/2013,3.0,I've been to this chain in several cities in my travels and never really had much to say other than its basic food you can get at TGIF and the likes. The waitress made the experience pleasurable she was very attentive and even though I went off the menu so to speak she never flinched. I ordered the Bison BBQ burger basic without the BBQ sauce just the bison lettuce tomato  onions and nothing else. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and very delicious. Good food good times  my guest also commented that their food was very good. Guest one had a pizza the other had fish and chips all came out perfect......kudos to the cook.
Meghan B.,Austin  TX,8,3,2,12/13/2014,4.0,Brett  Riley and Nick rule this place. Go to them if you need anything. They have lots of good beer on tap  bar is great  service is good if you go through those I mentioned before. Yay for bjs.
Melissa W.,Austin  TX,0,5,,1/23/2015,5.0,Last night was my first time to BJ's. The food was delicious. My husband and I both really enjoyed the fried artichokes  the corn fritters  and our entrees. I ordered the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos  which were totally awesome. My husband ordered the jalapeno burger which he also really enjoyed. The service was fantastic. We will definitely return on our next date night!
William T.,Pflugerville  TX,8,4,,6/24/2012,1.0,Oh man this is the only time we will ever be here. just gonna make this simplecons:3 plates were ordered two of them salads. one salad was sent back. it took more than 20 minutes for the manager to come talk to us and apologize and even longer than that for the salad to come back. 20+ minutes for a reorder? on a salad?service was so-so and food really didnt make up for it. waitiress didnt even ask if we needed refills on our alcohol. i was looking for this place on their website and i couldn't even find the location on their own website. it only gave me the one in sunset valley pros:atmosphere was nice  my food was okay and my water refills were sufficient.
Lucy V.,Austin  TX,16,190,352,8/14/2014,3.0,Very similar to Cheesecake factory? What you'd expect at a major chain restaurant that basically serves everything! I had salmon it was fine. Nothing amazing  a pricey safe choice.
Chris P.,Spring  TX,8,4,1,10/25/2014,4.0,The food was great! Waiter was nice but the wait staff was abrupt and unattentive. Their house brew was tasty (piranha pale ale). We had a build your med pizza that was served perfect temp and taste good too. I would come back if ever in the area.
M F.,Pflugerville  TX,1,82,41,1/23/2014,2.0,"Don\'t be fooled by the atmosphere  revolving doors  and upscale uniforms... this is actually a dressed up Applebees with ridiculous prices  crappy service  sulky hostesses  and pitiful food that is way over salted or under seasoned. You\'re greeted with ""Are you a member of our loyalty program?"" ...What is this  Kohls or a car wash service?? Then when you say no  they go ""oh... please have a seat.""Terrible margaritas too!! & tell that girl with the high sideways ponytail that people aren\'t paying $12.50 per wine glass to look at that mess. Thanks. -Patron"
Rosco T.,Round Rock  TX,1,35,1,10/9/2013,2.0,Food is very average. Calzone was bland and small. It reminded me of a hot pocket. Service was below average. The Waitress was polite but inattentive.The beer was good.
David A.,Fort Worth  TX,0,25,286,7/27/2013,1.0,The place is nice   but I had the classic burger & the buns were too thick . The burger tasted more like bread then meat. I didn't like it. I will never come back .
Lori A.,Hutto  TX,2,68,15,10/16/2012,2.0,"My first time to a BJ\'s  and I was not very impressed. The place was almost empty about 9 p.m. on a Sunday  and you would think we would have received amazing service because our server had no other tables. Unfortunately  that was not the case. Our server was abrasive and  the majority of the time  just simply not around.Lack of service aside  the food was OK. Fried cheese was some of the best I have ever had - it really was exceptional. I got the Cajun Pasta  with blackened chicken. The blackened chicken was awful - the seasoning did not match well  the ""application"" of the seasoning was odd. The whole ""blackening"" of the chicken seemed like an after-thought. The pasta itself was cooked well  but again the seasonings were off. The flavors seems disjointed in the entire dish. I may go back and give them another chance - but maybe a different location. I was not impressed at all."
Megan M.,Austin  TX,13,27,4,8/24/2014,2.0,"This was our third visit to this restaurant who won our business by being in a shopping center and convenient to our route home. The service was pretty good but sadly we were quite disappointed with the food. My husband got a turkey club which was average but he felt that some how there was way too much salt incorporated in it. I later checked the nutritional information and found it has over 3000 mg of sodium! I had the chicken pesto sandwich which was on their ""light"" menu. The sandwich was extremely overpowered with red pepper flakes in the pesto which made it incredibly difficult to eat I left over half of the small portion on my plate because of the bad flavor. Pesto  Chicken Red Peppers and Mozzarella are usually a no brainier choice for me. I\'m sorry to say we will not return due to the low quality of food."
J P.,Austin  TX,25,110,1,11/17/2012,3.0,Service was friendly. But slow but they were very busy.Food was ok. Appetizer was very lacking. We ordered mozzarella sticks.They were border line cold. Everything else was decent. Will probably give them another shot.
Minna K.,Austin  TX,8,16,4,8/17/2014,1.0,I've been to different locations of bjs alot a few years ago and recently i started going back. When i went a couple months ago  everything was great. However  me and my bf went back for the same pasta and it looked different  tasted different and was just not the same. It was so watery  it did not taste like pasta at all. It was salty and the two breadsticks that come with it werent there and our waiter seemed to notice but didnt care until we asked him to give it to us. The waitstaff there is always so unwelcoming and shows that they do not want to be there  like they have to be there or something. I know cuz im a waitress myself  but man you guys are corporate and need to be professional. I know i wont be going back to this location ever again.
Dee C.,Georgetown  TX,0,51,5,4/28/2015,1.0,"We have been here a couple times but we don\'t come again. Ordered a pulled pork sandwich and when it arrived the meat was old  dry  and burnt. Can\'t swallow it without water dry. The manager came over and said she wanted to do something for us because of the experience. I said I did not want to wait for anything because my husband was just about done eating. She persisted and offered dessert because it would be fast. Well  it wasn\'t and we were still waiting and when I got the bill and found she charged me for it both my husband and I were shocked. She INSISTED that she bring something. I walked up to her and asked for her to remove the charge and she did. No ""I\'m sorry I did not mean to charge you for that"" . WOW! You mess up my lunch date with my husband and make us wait around for a dessert I did not want and then charge me for it. We won\'t be going back."
Christina M.,Austin  TX,1,1,1,10/9/2013,5.0,I had the best service by a beautiful almost white long haired female. She was so sweet even when some one sitting next to me skipped out on the bill. Mad props to her for keeping it cool and still being awesome!
Travis X.,Austin  TX,207,142,1,12/3/2012,4.0,"Atmosphere/Decor: It has a sports bar type vibe to it. Tv\'s along the wall playing sports  a large alcohol selection  dark interior etc. etc. Service: Service here has always been good for us. We\'ve come about 5 times at this point and haven\'t had a negative experience. They stay on top of refills pretty quickly  usually partake in minor chit chat and get the food out in a timely manner. Food/menu: I\'ve had 4 or 5 different things at this point and all of them have been good. I particularly like the Parmesan Crusted Chicken  just make sure to ask for extra sauce  they never seem to give you enough...or maybe I\'m just fat :PI can\'t comment much on their beer/alcohol menu as I generally do not drink at restaurants because it costs an arm and a leg and I\'m cheap!The food menu is varied with a good amount of things to offer. I would say the menu is large but not TOO large. I wish the selection of the ""personal size"" appetizers was a bit more appealing though. Price: The price isn\'t bad for what you get. You get a large plate of food no matter what you order.The price of the personal size appetizers are great so if you want to nibble on something before your meal  it will no longer cost you the same price as an entree which was a complaint I had about this place before.Overall: Though I get dirty looks and jeers from people for going to a chain restaurant  I\'ve grown to like this place because of the quality of food and service they\'ve provided each time I\'ve come."
Scott J.,Denver  CO,51,17,,9/9/2012,5.0,I've been a fan/customer of BJ's for years. I was so happy when they finally opened other locations around Austin (until 2010 there weren't any BJ's within 20 miles of me). They have locations all over Southern California (where I'm orig from) so cheers to them for opening up more TX stores.Today I lunched with my parents at the Arbor Walk location - this location is about 2 years old - awesome decor and menu updates. Our server  Andrew  although new (which he told us  otherwise we'd never have known) was exceptionally friendly and outgoing. He really took care of my mom and made suggestions for her drinks. The coursing was timed just right  and Andrew checked on us no fewer than 5 times  we needed for nothing. We notified Andrew's manager of his terrific performance and after sharing our appreciation with Andrew  the manager gave us a few 'thank you' gift cards. (PS I had the sesame chicken salad - was yummy).With an updated decor  menu and look - BJ's always provides a great casual dining experience. Their lunch menu (weekdays) also rocks and is awesomely priced - cheaper than grabbing something fast.
Monica C.,Austin  TX,6,9,,6/7/2013,3.0,My review is mixedas I like the food but the other day I ordered curb side. I ordered a pot roast dinner (which was so good) and a kids meal  with a regular size root beer and Kazookie (I think that's what it's called) and my bill was $33 before tip. I wasn't provided an itemized bill and it seemed like a lot of money to feed my daughter and I. The curbside service was slow and my chidren (the reason I do curbside) were restless.I like the food though...not the price for that food.
Linda P.,Austin  TX,5,86,2,12/14/2012,3.0,Met up with some friends before the Holiday's Hostess not very friendly  I asked if my friends had been seated  she said I could go and look.After I looked and saw they were not their I went back to the Hostess to get a table. She asked if I had a Reward card and I said no. It was like I had the plauge because I did not have a Reward card. ( I don't even know what that is? A new promotion?)Once we were seated things looked up  the waitress we has was fantastic  I wish I had remembered her name. The food was good. I find the menu a little over whelming...so many choices. All in all a good experience  I will be back.
Michael D.,Cedar Park  TX,20,5,,11/14/2014,3.0,The Christmas beer wasn't quite to my liking but the rest of the crafted beers are delicious. We really enjoyed the great white deep dish pizza but the deep dish appetizer with the fries was not up to the normal BJ's standards that we are accustomed to. The pizookie desserts are Awesome. The service was great.
Stephanie F.,Austin  TX,15,99,33,2/26/2012,4.0,Really enjoyed everything I experienced today. Came at 2pm on a Sunday and there was no wait. Waitress came over immediately and my fiance ordered a Chimay Red and I got a root beer with a double shot of Absolut vanilla. Sublime. We ordered the chicken pot stickers for appetizers and they were delicious. A short time later our entrees arrived. My fiance ordered the new mahi mahi tacos and really enjoyed them. I got my usual broiled Atlantic salmon with mashed potatoes instead of rice. It came with a huge amount of butter-soaked vegetables that I just pushed to the side. I got the chardonnay-lemon sauce on the side and it was SO good. Salmon portion was HUGE. Perfectly cooked.I ordered 3 drinks and was surprised to be charged $3.90 for the root beer all 3 times. I guess no free refills on that since I was ordering $10 worth of vodka. Thought they'd throw in the root beer for free the 2nd and 3rd times. Didn't happen. Our service was great  nothing really wrong  but just cannot give 5 stars. Reserving that for our dinner at Craft Steak in Vegas in April...I hope.Will definitely be back!!!
Suzie P.,Austin  TX,104,205,389,9/26/2012,4.0,Been here 3 times now  once with my best friend  once solo and then I had to take my family.... it was delicious! Lunch specials are remarkable and priced VERY reasonable... huge menu to select from. Dessert menu absolutely rocks! Lots of choices  and the few we've had  were delicious! Brownie and Ice Cream is by far  my fave! Stuffed Mushrooms are to die for. Really  they are that good. Such a small bite  but so much flavor  its unreal. Love the fries too... could not keep hubby's hands out of them  we had to order more! Very good. Light and crispy  thin  shoestring fries! Happy with the selections  happy with the service... overall a great experience  and we will definitely go back!
Thomas R.,Austin  TX,7,11,55,7/19/2014,5.0,Great food and service. Plus their iPhone app made it so easy to pay when we were ready!
Kathi H.,Austin  TX,25,5,,9/22/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Bjs has excellent salad  when you actually get the ingredients the salad is supposed to have  which is about 2 out of 25 times. I related having problems previously at the time I ordered. The waitress tonight didn't even come back to offer missing ingredients after being told what was missing and looking at menu herself. (To see if I was correct) I am astonished! After i asked about the ingredients  when the salad was 3/4 gone  well after she checked the menu  she told me she could check on it but they may not have ingredients on the menu. She didn't even check with the kitchen! So  bad service  inconsistent kitchen  uncaring attitude  incomplete meal.
Teresa H.,San Saba  TX,0,12,14,7/7/2014,5.0,I have been eating at BJs for 10 yrs. I am a caterer of 32 yrs   this is my fav place.
Jordan M.,Austin  TX,0,25,6,9/18/2014,5.0,This is the place where my entire family loves to go for our teice a month family dinner. It has a great kid menu. The adult menu is very big. Sometimes this takes away from the quality of food  but this is not the case. I eat something different everytime and I have been happy everytime. There are tons of BJs draft beer and they are all really good. All ranging from light to dark on their very explanatory beer menu. Highly recommend this place
Jesse G.,Round Rock  TX,5,76,4,8/5/2014,2.0,Service was good  only reason for two stars... Food is terrible tastes very out of box or microwave.
Nik H.,Vallejo  CA,82,4,,12/8/2013,1.0,"Food wasn\'t too bad  when we got it. Maybe three stars. But this review is all about the service  and that\'s a one star story. On a night that wasn\'t crowded at all it took over forty five minutes to get avocado rolls; the server\'s response when we grew impatient waiting the same amount of time for our drinks  ""everything will be out when it\'s out ok""...hmmmm surely there\'s a better response than that. Even the manager was a Debbie Downer. After the crazy wait  our food came out completely wrong! His response  ""well  it\'ll go to waste if I take it back"". I\'m all about being careful about waste  but in real life  it should have been done correctly or responsibility should have been taken or maybe a tone that reflected a sliver of good customer service. None of that. Not tonight."
Miss S.,San Diego  CA,0,18,,7/30/2011,1.0,Big menu of TERRIBLE  greasy  caked on butter food. If you eat here enough you will be the size of Texas. Service started out ok. Then came the waiting and the waiting. When I am done I want my check promptly. When I hand you a credit card dont tell me to wait AGAIN so you can clear some other tables dishes. Then wait AGAIN  cause you screwed up the bill. All the while my 4 year old is climbing the walls.Then comes the real kicker. The tall African American MANAGER followed me to the parking lot and stood at my car asking me what was wrong with the service!!! Who does that?  I will never go back there unless it is to piss on the walls.If you want a wide selection of fancy beers then this may be to your liking. Eat BEFORE you come to this junk.
Tiffany W.,San Francisco  CA,290,204,103,12/6/2011,3.0,Dear BJ's  I adore you for giving your patrons an option of thick wedge or skinny shoe string fries to accompany their burger/sandwich. Your thin & crispy fries are among one of my favorites. In fact  my stomach just grumbled loudly in agreement. Oh  what I wouldn't do for a cold scoop of vanilla ice cream atop a warm chocolate chip pazookie... Om nom nom...Peace  love  and good food & beer Tiffany
Mark G.,Austin  TX,134,275,41,9/6/2011,3.0,Take The Cheesecake Factory. Kick the decor up a notch. Kick the prices and food down half a notch. Swap in beer instead of cheesecake as the signature item. Make the menu only slightly less epic  add a few televisions and - voil - you pretty much have BJ's.I start with their house-brew pale ale - quite hoppy enough to pass for an IPA  and pretty darn decent stuff. Went well with the appetizer sampler platter  complete with all the requisite fried goodies - cheese sticks  southwestern and avocado egg rolls as well as spinach-artichoke dip. All standard-issue quality  though the avocado egg rolls vanished first. For entrees  my fish and chips was good  the cajun pasta passable  and the baby back ribs a bit below par. Portions were massive  so our plans for dessert were replaced with overstuffed moans and to-go boxes.Service was attentive but a bit schizo - we had a newbie waiter as well as his trainer serving us  so there was a fair amount of overeagerness and confusion about who was fetching what. No stars off for that but no bonus  either.All-in-all an impressive interior  a vast selection of passable but mediocre food (at least based on our sampling)  large portions and decent prices. And with the concept of the place so parallel to that of The Cheesecake factory  I'll have to remind myself not to refer to it as The BJ Factory. Ahem.
Kate  G.,Austin  TX,0,2,,2/5/2015,1.0,I will never be coming back to BJ's again after my last experience. Over the holidays  my parents came into town and we made a reservation at BJ's due to its family-friendly atmosphere (we had a 2 year old and 6 month old in our group). Our server appeared to be high and had a lot of trouble getting the order straight with our table. Ok  whatever  this is Austin - as long as the food comes out it will be fine.The appetizers and drinks came out with no issues. When the food came out  ALL but one order was incorrect. (We had a party of 7). None of the pizzas had sauce OR tomatoes. The one vegan pizza that was ordered was covered in sausage. The two year old's macaroni and cheese took about 40 minutes to come out and his fries never did show up. A manager came by to apologize about the macaroni and cheese taking so long  so we took the opportunity to let her know that all of the food came out with errors. Instead of apologizing and fixing the issue  she argued with us. 'The sauce is baked into the pizza.' We tore the pizza apart to show her  no  there is no sauce and the deep dish pizza promises cooked delicious tomatoes. She then took about 10 minutes and came back with an ice cold cup of ice cold chopped salad tomatoes. Again  never apologizing for our completely ruined dinner. No one but one person was able to eat their dinner in the restaurant. She re-made one of the deep dish pizzas into a thin crust pizza to go and came back and acted like she did us some big favor (even though it was not asked for and was not what was ordered). I could go on and on  but the unprofessionalism of the manager alone was enough to never bring me back. They took some money off of the bill  but considering that no one was able to eat and our entire evening was completely ruined  they should have waived the entire bill. I emailed corporate to let them know how things are being run at this location and was sent back a standard form email with a $25 gift voucher attached - even though I will never use it and never ever go back. I strongly suggest you go anywhere else. This restaurant would be great if they didn't have so many staffing issues and incompetent rude people. Too bad. I would give zero stars if I could.
Tony W.,Plano  TX,0,20,,12/27/2013,2.0,"Went here with a party of 5  and only 2 were pretty happy with their orders. 2 people ordered steaks with steamed veggies. The steaks were cooked to order but were only warm when served  definitely not ""hot off the grill"". Much worse  the veggies were barely cooked. Some people like broccoli  carrots and cauliflower raw  but most people prefer them fully cooked  especially on your dinner plate. The server was apologetic  but the damage was done. Probably won\'t return to any BJ\'s anytime soon."
Jamie P.,Barboursville  VA,0,11,,7/4/2015,4.0,We had the chicken potstickers and pepperoni extreme flatbread pizza....delicious! I also tried the draft root beer and was quite happy with it. Great service  as well!
Austin C.,Austin  TX,433,33,15,8/10/2012,5.0,This is my second time to go to BJs and the best is the flatbread pizzas with a salad which was filling to me. I was not too mindful about the TVs or the brewery. However my parents did order the Chicken marsala and it was PERFECT! compared to Cheesecake when leftovers are taken home... it results in a really not so cool leftover. However when noting perfection it was pasta being al dente  veggies with ample chicken breasts. My mom had a lighter menu entree the Mahi Mahi which was good and the fish was perfect also.When joining as a their rewards member it was worth the email perks and guests to be able to redeem for some awesome rewards.
Andrew B.,Austin  TX,80,266,,12/8/2011,4.0,Made my first trip to BJ's today with a couple co-workers. Even though they were on the lunch rush  we were seated right away. Hostess was friendly and attentive  and so was the waitress. We even had the manager stop by our table to check on our meal and bring us some more water. As far as the food goes  I had a lunch special of a half baked potato and a cup of soup.The half potato is huge! I would not want a whole one. The clam chowder was some of the best I've had in recent years. My dining companions had salad  pizza and chili. They both had good things to say about the food.The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is upscale casual. It's more like a really nice Applebee's. Cover Three has similar decor  if you're familiar with that restaurant/bar.BJ's is definitely a great addition to Arbor Walk and I know I'll be eating there again.
Melise L.,Austin  TX,27,47,7,6/26/2011,3.0,"They have a spiral bound menu so it\'s pretty extensive. Also  there are pictures which I like. More often than not if there are pictures on a menu I\'ll just point and grunt when asked what I would like. --Their snack size Caprese salad is pictured so I got that to start. It was SO good. The mozzarella balls were super fresh. When you combine cheese and balls  you better make sure it\'s topnotch or else you\'ll go home aching or with chlamydia. Most likely both. That was $4. --I then got the fried artichoke. Usually ""fried fill in the blank"" is good anywhere and this didn\'t disappoint. It\'s quartered artichoke hearts breaded and fried and come out in a little pile with lemon garlic aioli. It was a little lemon-y for me. Kinda perfumey in a way so I am gonna ask for ranch next time. These were $3. --I also got two mini barbacoa tacos. The corn taco shells were the size of a large cookie  and the meat was tasty (I know  I know that\'s what she said). They were $3.I think the service is on the over-eager side  but somehow negligent at the same time. That ain\'t easy to do. I think they are staffed with friendly people who are sometimes hindered by the new computer system. And management probably gave them a ""be friendly  we\'re new kids in town"" talk. I kinda like it  though I recognize this can be suffocating to some people. I like when if I\'m spending money at your establishment  you are nice to me."
Jason H.,Austin  TX,2,126,,11/7/2014,2.0,"It\'s ""Chili\'s"" on steroids. The faade is a little nicer  the prices a little higher  and some of the home-brewed beer options are pretty decent  but in the end  you\'re basically just getting sub-par fried food  chain-restaurant style."
Samantha S Y.,Austin  TX,37,81,27,10/24/2011,4.0,They have a great Gluten Free menu and the first time I have ever seen a gluten free desert (Brownie with ice cream) on any menu...I'm watching my diet so I didn't order it but I'll save up and try it next time. They also have several gluten free beer options  I tried the fruit one and wasn't impressed but I'll try the others the next time I go.Lot's of TV's kept my hubby happy.
Colleen C.,Austin  TX,0,13,,7/31/2014,5.0,Great service and food! Our waiter Kittrick was super attentive  friendly  and professional. And the food (salmon with cherry chipotle glaze....mmmm!) was delicious! Overall great dining experience.
Joey M.,Austin  TX,19,126,5,5/6/2012,4.0,BJ's is a great place to go when you want above average  consistent food and don't really want to think about where to eat. The menu is strong all around: good salads  pizza  wings  burgers  and just about anything else you could want. The beer menu is large  offering both in house brewed beers and others on tap. Prices are average for a brewhouse.Be careful about going here during peek times  especially on weekends. The wait can get long. The place sports a ton of flat screens  so it makes a great place to have a meal and catch the game. The staff is generally attentive and helpful  although we did have a newbie that was so nice it was borderline scary. It is great to be pleasant and friendly  but no one can be that happy working food service.Prices are reasonable  but you can spend a bit if you do appetizers  beers  and dessert. Go late for happy hour (after 9) to save some money.
Tim C.,Georgetown  TX,1,46,4,7/16/2012,2.0,"""BJ\'s"". Come on. A worn out formerly funny cliche from the 1970s.""Brewhouse"". Liar liar pants on fire.In a pinch  I hoped this would be a place for ""Suburban Factory Food the Safe Mom"". Nope. I would rather have spent my money at Chili\'s or McDonald\'s. And with the size of the building  I was hoping too for at least a halfhearted effort to have beer served that was actually brewed on-site. Nope.Service was slow and borderline of poor  the portions were smaller than I expected  and the beer was good but overpriced. The fried chicken --with a scant plop of gravy-- tasted similar to Chick-Fil-A so one star there.From Wikipedia: ""The BJ\'s Restaurants Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to support charities benefiting children\'s health care and education  with primary focus on the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. "" So another star there.=2 stars. Moving on..."
Amanda G.,Austin  TX,3,15,18,6/6/2014,5.0,We always love us some good BJ's! This one was great  as they all seem to be. No wait at 1:30 on Friday. Had the avocado egg rolls  Asian salad  and crispy jalapeo burger. All were great. The burgers are HUGE so don't fill up on appetizers. Clean and friendly. Go!
Stefanie Y.,Austin  TX,120,69,8,9/27/2011,4.0,"Service can really change your perspective. In this case  our awesome server Lindsay made me add the extra star. Tonight my husband and I went to BJ\'s and sat in a ""Tooth"" (our word for half Table  half Booth). We were greeted immediately by Lindsay. Let me tell you  she was genuine  knowledgable and suggestive without being pushy. I was a server for many years and she definitely had it. Chatty  but not too much so. Friendly  but not fake. She definitely made our experience.But on to the food....What did we have to eat and what did we think?Avocado Egg Rolls: I love me some avocado and egg rolls. So I have to love this  right? Meh.... A little bland. Wasn\'t too sure what the dipping sauce was  but all in all the dish felt like it was missing something.Fish & Chips: My husband\'s food... He said it was just okay. I snuck a bite and thought it was pretty good. Parmesan Crusted Chicken: I was super excited about this  but wasn\'t too crazy about it. I NEVER add salt to my food. But I did here.... it just was lacking a little flavor. Unfortunately  I also received literally 3 or 4 small heads of broccoli  so I felt like I didn\'t really get the full serving.Overall the food was good  but not necessarily worth the price tag. But the service was worth every cent. Other servers have alot to learn from her."
Steffi V.,Norwood Acres  TX,17,45,3,11/23/2013,5.0,I went there for dinner today for the first time & loved it! Had the pulled pork sandwich & it was massive. It was also super delicious :) my mom had fish tacos which she also enjoyed very much. Will deff go back. The service was great!
Robert G.,Round Rock  TX,372,360,1,5/18/2012,3.0,Ok is the first thing that comes to mind. I had the Ca burger and a Thai chicken mango salad.Both  were good. I'd not complain about it but I wasn't floored. I'll eat here again  I found the burger was tasty and the mix of avocado with chiles was nice. The beer selection was ample and overall the place felt like a grown up Applebees maybe?The salad was light and the mango paired well to lighten the dish. Good.Reading other reviews it seems like their food is consistently good from item to item and I wouldn't be opposed to eating here again. Nothing made me want to rush back immediately but it's...ok.
Jeffrey M.,Austin  TX,14,94,11,8/27/2011,5.0,I am rating this restaurant 5 stars only because you cannot give it 5MM stars.I was headed to Mighty Fine but the wife was not having a burger. So we ended up at BJ's --- up north --- first timer.Experience --- literally perhaps the best dining experience of that genre in my entire life.Restaurant is nicely done at a high but not obnoxiously level of finish. Clean crisp and brewery like but very nice w/ lots of booths. I love booths.Service --- Matt Bowman --- perfect. Not good  not great  perfect. Undoubtedly the best waiter I have ever been served by. Un - freakin' believable. I am going to have to hire this dude.Fabulous food recommendations and then the promises were met and exceeded.Ice cold home brewed root beer. Brewed on site. Fabulous. In an ice cold mug.The experience was so good  I literally cannot express myself.I will be back time and again.
Scott T.,Pflugerville  TX,66,205,4,4/9/2012,3.0,We have been to BJ's a few times and have enjoyed something different each time.Recently  I sat at the bar and enjoyed a personal pan pizza and a few beers. I can't remember what the beer was called but I do remember they have seasonal selections that change at a good pace. Great Bar scene but it also has a great dinnerarea for date night!
Michael J.,Austin  TX,190,108,13,6/29/2011,2.0,BJ's is one of my favorite chain restaurants. This one isn't. I've been to this one four times. The first time  if I had never been to BJ's  I wouldn't have returned. It has gotten progressively better  but it's still really behind the 8-ball when it comes to what I expect when I visit BJ's. The last visit was the first time our orders came out right  although out of order. The appetizer came after the main dishes.I have a lot of hope for this BJ's as it's the only one local for me. I've been to the one in Cupertino by the Apple campus  and the one just north of Dallas. It's a good chain and deserves better than the portrayal this one brings.
Erika G.,Santa Fe  NM,0,2,,5/9/2015,1.0,"Wow...what a place. Where to begin? So I took my family to bjs for an early mother\'s day dinner. The 1 star is a generous rating that I\'m only ok with giving since my grandmother was the only one fully satisfied with her ribeye steak. My sister ordered a turkey sandwich which had sour tomatoes and ham  she choose not to finish her meal. My boyfriend ordered mahi mahi  bland  dry and small portioned. My mother the mahi mahi tacos she was unimpressed. I ordered the house sirlion medium rare... Apparently this is foreign meat to bjs. The ""steak"" was tiny and over cooked and they forgot to load my potato....a nightmare that was just beginning  they took back my meal only to later bring me just a loaded potato...this was my meal. Then came another steak and potato  this time the meat wasn\'t even a steak more like a dry hamburger patty. Round 3 the meat again was questionable  I cut into it and no juices...plus the meat looked brown. ..meanwhile the potatoes wouldn\'t stop. At one point my boyfriend had to go find our waiter and beg for the potatoes to just stop coming. The 4th steak at least wasn\'t over cooked...BUT rare as hell. So i just gave up  enough was enough. Plus there was no toilet paper  my mother had to use toilet covers. That was my first and last visit to this over priced and poor portioned establishment. LEARN TO COOK MEAT!!Ted (waiter) get out of that train wreck of a restaurant and earn better money elsewhere."
Owen P.,Austin  TX,3,14,2,5/22/2011,4.0,"TL;DR: Good food  variety  lots of beer  sort of high prices  get there early. This is more like a 4.5 star review because I feel the prices need adjustment.We went at about 5:30 PM on a Saturday of opening week. We were seated immediately  but by about 6:15 the lobby was packed. You might want to call ahead  but this might change as the new wears off. The booth seemed a little small  but the dining area wasn\'t crowded. It was quite noisy though; don\'t expect an intimate date night. There were plenty of kids there but I\'m not sure I\'d call it kid-friendly. It was noisy enough people might not notice a loud kid though; that might be a plus.The menu\'s big and is all over the place. Pizzas  burgers  salads  fish; it was kind of like The Cheesecake Factory only not quite as bewildering. The pizzas look interesting  but I decided on a Pirahna Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger. My wife got some kind of cajun pasta dish. Neat tip: you can nix the chicken and go shrimp-only on some dishes even though the menu doesn\'t say so. Maybe we paid more for it; I didn\'t check.The cheeseburger was a true knife and fork affair; it was served open faced because no way could it be eaten like a normal burger. I found it quite tasty and prepared well  though the chili was much better than the burger part. My wife\'s pasta dish was a pasta dish; it\'s hard to get blown away by pasta. I was born and raised in Louisiana and no one ever seems to get that ""Cajun"" means ""spicy"". Portions were big; my cheeseburger was too much and my wife had 2 meals from the leftovers. This balances the prices; I paid $10 for a chili cheeseburger with fries and hers was maybe $15.Service was OK considering it\'s the first week. Some of the waitstaff seemed inexperienced  but everyone seemed nice and willing to please. I was *just* starting to think it was taking a while to get my food when I heard my waiter complaining to a manager that we\'d been waiting a while  then the manager apologized. They were *busy* so I wasn\'t concerned; the food showed up shortly afterwards.I\'m not a beer snob so I\'ll leave those reviews to someone else. I got the Pirahna Pale Ale and liked it  but my wife\'s Jeremiah Red was better. They\'ve got a list of brews that the restaurant makes and they range from a few lights to some stouts and porters; there ought to be something for everyone.It cost us $40 to get two entrees and two pints of beer. I think it probably should have been more like $35 and could have done with smaller portions to offset it. I\'d like to try a pizza and see if those are worth the price.My only regret is I got so full from the cheeseburger I couldn\'t order one of the pizookie desserts. It\'s a cookie in a deep dish cooked like a pizza smothered with various ice cream toppings; it reminds me of the Cookie Monster dessert at Cheddar\'s. I\'ll be back for it.I\'m not sure what could make this a 5-star restaurant. The food can\'t get much better without higher prices; trying to make it quieter ruins the sports bar atmosphere; lowering the prices doesn\'t really offset either of the two. I\'d say I walked in expecting a three-star experience and I got a little bit better than 4. Exceeds expectations."
Dave I.,Pflugerville  TX,49,17,4,10/9/2012,4.0,The atmosphere is a big plus here  its beautifully built and very slick. The food  so far  hasn't dissapointed either. Last two times I sat at the bar and the tv is huge  great spot to watch the game or games  they will sometimes split the screen into four sections (great for the Olympics). The pricing is high though  even with happy hour  so be prepared for that. Last time I went I sampled a beer and they gave it to me in a broken glass  I had to spit up the beer and the glass shards I almost swallowed.. the manager stopped by after to apologize  however I was suprised the didn't comp a single item  bad form.
David R.,Austin  TX,3,61,,1/25/2012,4.0,The food is solid  and the beer selection is first rate. Belgian  British  US specialty  you name it  BJs has it. In my view  it is over priced  so I only go here when I'm in the mood for some good beer. If I'm just looking for a decent casual restraint  I avoid it because of the cost. Great place for guys night out  though.
Carolynn B.,Austin  TX,0,4,,6/10/2015,1.0,TERRIBLE. Terrible service  terrible food  and the waitress rolled her eyes and popped a 'tude when i asked if they had gluten free beer. I wasn't annoying or rude  just asked. AND they messed up a baked potato. IDK how you even do that. i will never ever go back. Oh and in case you thought the crowd was gonna be young and exciting  i was probably the youngest person there by 30 years.
Fahad N.,Austin  TX,6,4,2,7/8/2012,3.0,Food is just ok. I like the creole tilapia and tomato basil soup. Going to try my pizzokie now. Last time i want there my soup was luke warm and when i asked for fresh pepper the waitress got it after i completed the soup and just slammed it on my table and walked away. I was surprised by her behavior.My creole tilapa was undercooked and i asked them to take it back. they got me a new one which presented in pathetic manner.A portion of tilapia was lying on the side of the plate. Was not impressed by their service. only plus point they are open late and decent place to grab food after 10 pm
Ryan S.,Austin  TX,95,48,1,9/22/2011,4.0,My girlfriend and I tried BJ's tonight. We asked the waiter why it seemed so similar to Cheesecake Factory. He told us that the current CEO of BJ's used to be the CFO of the Cheesecake Factory. Well  it definately shows. The menu is massive  the bar has rows of liquor bottles just like Cheesecake Factory  and the staff is knowledgeable and courteous. The dining floor is laid out with medium size walls that make it possible to have a private conversation in a crowded room. We tried the avocado egg rolls  the seared ahi tuna  the crispy fried artichokes  the spinach stuffed mushrooms  and finally the Italian Market Salad. I enjoyed the house blonde beer and my girlfriend had a chardonnay. Overall  we really thought that the restaurant was outstanding. The food was great  the price was reasonable  and the ambiance is nice. We highly recommend the Italian Market Salad  the Seared Ahi Tuna  the Crispy Fried Artichokes  and the house blonde beer.
Tenessa V.,Austin  TX,3,3,,10/1/2011,1.0,The food was good however the person who cleaned the plates off the table stole a wallet and the server screwed up on the bill twice the last time i wenti use to go there atleast twice a month before and never had any problems there deep dish pizza is awesome however do my last experience i seriously doubt i will be going there again
Robert S.,Pflugerville  TX,54,67,,2/10/2013,1.0,"I have always liked BJ\'s and have dined at several around the state. No matter which one I go to my order comes out wrong half the time. Once I ordered a small pizza and got a REALLY small pizza. About four inches across. The waiter said he misunderstood and ordered me the correct size which I wasn\'t charged for and gave me a small salad while I waited so I could at least have something to eat with the rest of my table. Another time I was asked if I wanted the shoestring fries or the wedge fries. I got the kind I didn\'t order. Today I ordered the open face Pot Roast sandwich and that is when seemingly all hell broke loose. Here is the menu description: ""Tender Angus beef pot roast slices are served on a toasted garlic cheese French roll and topped with white cheddar mashed potatoes and mushroom brown gravy. Served with oven roasted vegetables.""My waitress asked what kind of fries I wanted. I double checked the menu to see if I read it right and showed her that it came with veggies as it already had mashed potatoes. I asked her why I would want fries on an item that already came with potatoes and she just shrugged and said  ""You never know."" Now here is where things get complicated. If a menu item says a dish comes ""with"" something that means in addition to right? Catfish WITH coleslaw. Hamburger WITH fries. Am I not right?The server brings my food MINUS the veggies after what I had just gone through with the waitress. I call him back and he says he will go get them and brings them to me a few minutes later. This should be the end of the story but no. He makes a point to return to the table presumably to ask me if I liked the veggies to which I responded in the affirmative. He then makes a big point of saying he\'s glad and that he was going to ""take care"" of them to make me happy even though they don\'t come with the meal and that in fact the veggies mentioned on the menu description were already included on my plate.What was he referring to? The mushroom gravy on my potatoes? The celery garnish? The handful of shredded carrots?Had he just shut up when he brought me the veggies I wouldn\'t be writing this. Yes I know the customer is always right but he made a big point of saying I was WRONG but he comped me the veggies that should have been included in the meal to begin with just to make me happy. Big man! you gave 20 cents of ""free"" veggies. Happy now? Way to go! Make yourself look superior to a customer over a cupful of veggies that cost next to nothing. Had I accepted the offer to SUBSTITUTE fries for my veggies I guess it would have not been an issue but asking for something that was already included in my meal seemingly makes me a problem customer to the employees. I emailed the management saying they need to amend the menu description from just  ""Served with oven roasted vegetables."" to  ""Served with oven roasted vegetables and a free double helping of grief from the restaurant employees.""For the record the sandwich was delicious but I didn\'t enjoy it as much as I should have because the attitude of the employees left a real bitter taste in my mouth."
Lauren G.,Denver  CO,2,65,4,8/1/2013,1.0,Just ate shrimp tacos and almost immediately felt dizzy and sick to my stomach..... You guys need to cook fresh food  that was $10 thrown to the trash!
Antoinette G.,Austin  TX,425,242,2,7/16/2011,4.0,Our first time there was on a Friday evening a little after 5:00. It was already bustling with lots of people. The atmosphere was very nice--they have really nice big booths with granite tabletops. The menu is huge--takes a long time to figure out what you want--everything from salads to sandwiches to pizzas to regular entrees. We enjoyed our food and thought the prices were very reasonable. The service was excellent--our waiter was very efficient and friendly. We will return!
Katon M.,Colorado Springs  CO,6,12,15,6/17/2013,3.0,Great place. Good beer. Gets busy at lunch time.
Korey A.,Austin  TX,114,222,7,11/11/2011,3.0,We went there after a UT game. My dad was not very impressed with his burger. He thought it was over cooked and a little bland. My brother and I shared a pizza. The pizza was thick and pretty tasty. It could have used a little more pizza sauce. I don't know that I would go back there again.
Sondra S.,Austin  TX,166,95,6,1/2/2012,4.0,I am sick sick sick of all of the usual choices. There are so many restaurants that are so meh as to be unmissable  and the ones I do like  I'm bored with  so I was glad to see another choice pop up relatively close to home.We've only been once but the food and service were good and fast even though they were pretty busy (we went the day after Christmas). We would go here again!
K S.,Austin  TX,151,19,80,9/4/2011,4.0,We were there for the Grand Opening. They gave out free food and it was great! The place was very nice and they have a full bar! They even make the beer from start.
Jennifer P.,Austin  TX,59,103,2,6/11/2011,2.0,This might be a good place to get a few beers at the bar. But it wasn't a great place to get a meal. The kitchen has no idea what it's doing and the place is so poorly laid out that you have to ask other diners to scootch and press themselves into their tables in order to squeeze through the dining room.We had a table of 7. The shrimp lettuce wraps tasted ok but were really hard to eat (bad filling-to-lettuce ratio). The ribs were overcooked and tough. The ahi tuna had been seared at some point  but must have then been put in the fridge  because it was icy. The gluten-free pizza with extra cheese  came with hardly any cheese at all. Also  their gluten-free crust is herbed  which is a weird choice that I didn't like -- it overpowered the other flavors in the pizza. But the worst was my friend's dinner -- he ordered the salmon with spinach instead of rice. His plate came with rice  and no spinach. So he asked for the spinach  and a while later he was presented with a bowl of broccoli. Um  that's a vegetable and it's green  but still not spinach. By the time he finally got his spinach  he barely wanted it anymore. Not to mention that his fish smelled like it was slightly past its prime.The only food on the table that anyone loved was the broccoli cheese soup.We had one server who took our orders and checked up on us  and she was great -- the only positive aspect of our visit actually. But when the food was delivered  every single plate was brought to the table by a new and different person. I'll never understand that style of food service -- it's annoying to have to play air-traffic-controller with the plates and tell 7 different people where to place each plate. This style of service also held true for drink orders -- especially entertaining was the server who couldn't tell the difference between a pint of beer and a pint of raspberry cider. (Wow  really dude? The pink one is the beer? Really?)So  bad food  inconsistent service  and a dining room you have to squeeze and shimmy through just to move through it? No thanks.
Hannah C.,Austin  TX,2,15,,6/20/2011,2.0,Biggest menu of mediocre food ever. It's overwhelming. We were there around 9pm on a Friday night and had a small group of three. After taking forever to narrow down what we wanted  we ordered and then our waitress came back to tell us that 3 of the things ordered were out (we ordered appetizers and some side things to share). Seriously?! Why have such a HUGE menu if you aren't going to keep things in stock? After a little more time we finally were able to order and then the food was just meh. Nothing to really go back for. It was really loud and busy  so it took a while to get our stuff and all around we were unimpressed. SO bummed!I will say that the waitress was awesome. She checked on us often and made sure our drinks/beer needs were met. Not a place I plan to go back to any time soon!
Alex R.,Austin  TX,279,31,1,6/13/2011,3.0,"Went there for the first time yesterday for lunch.The good: the place is huge  nice decor  has flat screens everywhere if you want to keep up with games  getting seated took no time - great with a toddler. Plus  a very deep  diverse menu with a lot of options  including a full slate of options for kids. It\'s family friendly in that way. I didn\'t have any this time  but they have a nice selection of micro brewed beer.The bad: the prices are a bit steep  so it can\'t just be your neighborhood weekly place  since it is a bit overpriced. They have a ton of TVs so when we walked in  I asked the bartender if they could put one of the TVs on the Astros-Braves game and she said she would but never got around to it. Maybe it\'s because it\'s a chain  not sure why  but our server was over zealous. As someone who used to wait to tables  it\'s always better to check too much on a table than too little  but we couldn\'t even get a bite of food in our mouth before the server was in our faces asking how the food was - ""don\'t know  haven\'t eaten a bite yet - it just arrived this second"" - was my response with both the appetizer and dinner.In addition  when you\'re dealing with a toddler  if you look at him and ask him if he wants ""chocolate"" he will say yes - which is why a good server should be thoughtful of parents and look at the parents and simply ask if we want dessert - we had to cut our server off in mid sentence since we knew our son would create a problem being offered chocolate and us having to say no. Not OK for the server to go past us just to try and make a buck. The manager was a nice game and came over afterwards to check on us so overall  they are friendly  but they could relax a little more & have their servers tamp down their upselling and overzealousness. In addition  while the adult meals they brought us were good and had nice presentation  my son ordered mac n cheese and it was clearly the same \'instant Kraft\' we could make him at home. Overall  I\'d go back but they need fix a few things."
Monica Nelson R.,Round Rock  TX,68,3,6,1/12/2012,5.0,I really like this place. The food is great  there are big screens with sports everywhere  and the beer is really good. My meal was the Pizza (Italian) and the French Dip both of which were Awesome..yum!!!Can't wait to go back!
Ann K.,Austin  TX,53,136,6,7/19/2013,1.0,"The ""gourmet"" mac and cheese was some of the worst I\'ve ever had. Yes  worse than school lunch. Imagine sticky cheese and noodles drowned in milk  with way too much salt. Somebody needs to learn to make a white sauce  or just stick with velveeta if it\'s too much trouble. My stomach didn\'t feel too good after either."
Cindy O.,Austin  TX,0,90,1,5/27/2011,5.0,Well not sure about the other reviews but a new location opening can have its ups and downs. It's a Friday night so I had to wait about 50 minutesbut the food was very good as I remember of BJ's. The fried artichoke appetizer was crispy  crunchie and wonderfully complimented by the side of lemon alioli sauce and a cold brew. My mini pizza was awesome. I have always enjoyed this restaurant from my days living in San Diego. Try the deep dish cookie desserts......oh my! Did not have that tonight but have in the past and it is sinful.A special mention to my server Brad. Prompt  personable and did a great job. Never met him before but ask for Brad next time you go to this BJ's location.
Anh P.,Austin  TX,120,312,1,10/28/2011,4.0,I've eaten here only twice or so and honestly can't remember if it was good/great or average.I can say that every year I come and drink the DELICIOUS PUMPKIN SPICE BEER!Just try it!!
Chris P.,Austin  TX,1,22,,4/18/2012,3.0,BJ's is one of the most OK places to eat that I can think of. The service is friendly but can be slow or forgetful at times. Other times it's - not really a big deal either way.I've eaten there 3-4 times and every time my entree has tasted fine  but it hasn't been anything special or worthy of eating out. There are tons of better options for every type of food on the menu. The most disappointing aspect of BJ's is that their personally hand crafted brews are subpar to everything else they have tap. Fortunately  what they have on tap is a reasonable selection of good beer.The ahi poke appetizer is really good so I'm happy ordering that when I go. The other times I keep trying out new dishes hoping to find something really enticing. The pazookie is an above average dessert too considering how many of them they probably make.I like the TVs here  but it's not really a place I'd watch a game at. So yeah  BJ's is alright at every level. I don't dislike eating here  but I don't really enjoy it either.
Jared M.,Aurora  CO,27,34,5,6/25/2011,3.0,"This place has a huge menu of okay to mediocre food. It\'s almost as if several people collaborated to make a restaurant and the criteria was  ""what\'s your favorite restaurant."" After about ten people named their favorite they made BJ\'s and jumbled up a menu from those ten restaurants.  That leaves you with a variety of mediocre but far from stellar food. Thus the three stars. There are however  five star worthy highlights to this place. 1. Their beer selection is outstanding and their house brews are very good. My particular favorite is Tatanka Stout which every time I see that name I have to start quoting Dances With Wolves and thus I rename the beer buffalo stout. This place has the beer selection but not the great food to go with it. 2. They actually have a very good Tomato Bisque. 3. I am fishing for a third here but the wait staff is annoyingly helpful. Overall I have decided this place is where I will go to eat an adequate soup and salad and enjoy fairly good beer."
Texas F.,Austin  TX,0,23,,3/7/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,"The less-than attentive waitress really ruined a birthday lunch for a friend and I. We ordered a shareable appetizer  then decided on soup & salad for the main entre. Coffee arrived first without enough condiments; the waitress was gone a long time as coffee cooled. When she finally did return & inquired about our order  I said she would get that when we got more sugar & half \'n half for our coffee. Placed the order and within five minutes here comes the salad  on its heels the delicious chicken tortilla soup (my favorite)  which were served by other waiters. Again  our waitress (Abbie) pulled a Houdini. One of the waiters provided us more dressing for our salad. Then ""Abracadabra!"" here comes the appetizer. HA! My friend and I laughed at how ridiculous the service was as our soup cooled quickly in the wide-mouth  thick-lipped serving bowls. We sent the appetizer back; I asked for the manager  who appeared in time making lame apologies but not making any attempt to fix things. After his appearance  the waitress gave us the cold shoulder. One of their ""Pizookie"" desserts is offered for birthday customers  so my friend ordered one. It is an oversized cookie baked into an aluminum pan and served with a couple of scoops of ice cream. The dessert arrived and the dough was raw  not completely baked. It was sent back; the manager reappeared  saying  ""That\'s how we make it..."" as we wondered why would a restaurant serve undercooked cookie dough? I advised the manager to make it right and comp the soup.The full-baked Pizookie arrived later; our coffee was cold and the waitress made no attempt to offer more. After we finished what we wanted of the dessert  the aloof waitress swept by. without asking if we were through  and took away plates. When she brought our bill  I advised her to take it to the manager to get it right; he discounted my friend\'s meal and the dessert was ""on the house"" as her birthday gift  I suppose. All in all  it was really a very unpleasant dining experience  and after being treated so shabbily by the BJ staff  we won\'t be back anytime soon."
Andrew C.,Round Rock  TX,297,106,18,5/22/2011,4.0,I haven't been to a BJ's in ages and I was excited to try this new location out with a few buddies of mine a few nights ago for some happy hour. We arrived at about 6:30 and it was completely packed. We somehow managed to grab a table after just a few minutes of waiting  but for those wanting to beat the happy hour rush  I recommend arriving early or visiting during their late happy hour. It took a little bit longer than expected to find someone to greet us  but it's something that happens with any new restaurant that opens up  so it wasn't that big of a deal (hopefully this will improve as time goes by). Our waitress was very nice and was definitely trying her best. They had a nice selection of beer - my favorites were the hefeweizen and the blondie. I ordered the mini pizza (pepperoni  sausage)  which I had to say was quite hearty and satisfying. The pan crust was crispy on the outside and had the warm  buttery texture on the inside. We shared a huge sampler appetizer plate which also had some good eats.I don't think there was anything really wrong with the place  except the food being greasier than I'd like it to be. The inside environment and decor is trendy  but it doesn't feel Austin. I'll definitely come back again  but based on my overall experience  I'd have to give this BJ's location 4 stars.
William Z.,Round Rock  TX,24,169,2,7/1/2011,4.0,"My son said to make sure we ordered the bacon cheeseburger pizza and that\'s what we had. It was terrific! The deep dish crust was cooked to perfection! Had a ""Nitwit"" beer that complimented the pizza perfectly. BJs is a welcome addition to the Austin restaurant scene."
Christina P.,Pflugerville  TX,73,101,10,6/29/2013,2.0,I came here for lunch and it was a comedy of errors. Things started off well and then shifted after my coworker and I ordered. She has a lot of dietary restrictions and in the process of the staff working to meet her requests it all went to hell. Not only did they mess up her requested changes (so they had to redo the order) but my order (which had no modifications) was completely held up and delayed.  The amount of time from when we ordered to when we finally got our entrees was absurd. The manager tried to help in getting her order correct but not much changed. It felt like the manager  waitstaff and kitchen staff were not communicating. At the very least  they weren't communicating much with us. A bright spot was the chocolate pizzookie. I would go back for that alone. It was decadent and fabulous. I am going to give BJs another try and hopefully my second experience will be better.
Gretchen D.,Austin  TX,21,72,2,2/17/2013,2.0,"I was disappointed. We went at 5pm on a Saturday  as we usually go out early because of our 2 year-old. Earlier usually means fewer crowds and faster service. Well  it was not extremely crowded  but the service was SO slow. Initially  our server came fast and was very pleasant. But once our order was in  it took at 45+ minutes to get our food. I ordered the deep dish pizza  which was far from deep dish (I now read another review here stating their experience was the same - wish I had seen it before ordering!). It was basically a regular pizza  with slightly puffy crust. And upon our server stating that the small one was in fact really small (less than 6"")  I opted for the next size up. Yes  it was enough  but it was NOT worth the $15 price tag.My husband got a steak (which he loves to do wherever we go) and said it wasn\'t great. It looked pretty charred on the outside  even though the inside was the right color. (The only upside was the baked potato with everything on the side came with nice chunks of what appeared to be fresh-cooked bacon  although it didn\'t have a lot of bacon flavor.)My brother got the jalapeno burger and it looked yummy and big. In the midst of conversation  I didn\'t get to ask him how it was  but it didn\'t look like he had complaints. Perhaps the burger is the way to go. Overall  the prices are way too high for the food quality. It\'s decent food  but not worth the $60 bill (before tip) we had for two meals and a couple of beers."
L L.,Austin  TX,0,134,15,2/6/2012,2.0,"CONSweak beer (their brand)Lame veggie burger with ""steamed"" toast  wilted lettuce  (I guess the plate was stil hot from the sanitizer when they added my food to it) and pickle-sized tomatoes (though they did give me four of them).Few veggie options...and the menu is a spiral notebook of choices.

Edward P.,Austin  TX,9,30,31,9/6/2013,1.0,These is nothing good to say about the food. It will fill you up but leave you regretting your decision to dine here.
Richard M.,Austin  TX,13,91,6,6/9/2011,3.0,Well despite all the complaints about the service  our waitress was quite attentive and our drinks were never dry. The only mistake she made was after we finished our first beer she asked if we were ready for another round  we said yeah and reached for a menu. Before we had even picked it up she was already gone. We wanted to try something different but we wound up with refills of what we had already had. Not a real big deal and that was the only mistake.The good: They have an excellent beer selection and a fairly broad food menu.The bad: Nothing I'd really call bad.The indifferent: Although fairly nice  it DEFINITELY has a sterile  corporate feel  although far better than that sorry Brick House place up the road. I had the Cajun pasta  it was not very impressive  about what I'd expect from a chain. Certainly not bad  there just wasn't anything all that special about it. I had their porter and their stout. The stout was the better of the two. Their porter is nitrogen conditioned  which is something I don't really care for and if I'd caught that before I ordered I probably would have skipped it. The stout was far more satisfying but certainly nothing out of the ordinary. Even if I find their other in-house brews as average as the two I've tried so far (I intend on finding this out with another couple visits) they have many other beers I am familiar with that are very good.
Carrie S.,Austin  TX,195,62,127,6/16/2013,4.0,First time here. We went at lunch when it was starting to get busy. Sat at the bar top. No waiting. Our bartender  Joe  was quick and attentive. Explained the brews to us. I chose a seasonal Belgium. My boyfriend with the brunette brown. Mine was a little hoppy if you like that. The brown was very smooth. We decided to go with a variety of appetizers. We had the tomato bisque  BBQ chicken chopped salad  stuffed mushrooms and the mac and cheese. Our least favorite was the Mac and cheese. The 3 cheeses and bacon with bread crumbs was good  just a little dry. The mushrooms were yummy. The salad and bisque were the highlight of the day. The bisque was creamy and delicious. I would order both of those again. We signed up for their members perk program. They also have special dinners with highlighted beers. Looking forward to attending one soon.
Holly B.,Austin  TX,0,17,,4/23/2013,4.0,I like to come to BJ's as a treat  or whenever they're doing their 2 for $20 special (2 people - salad/soup each  1 pizza  and a pazookie  GREAT deal). The beers are good  the avocado egg rolls are heaven on a plate  and their pizzas/sandwiches are pretty decent too. All in all  it's a little too much on the expensive side for me to come here often  but I always feel happy with my meal  beer  and the service whenever I do.
Ricardo G.,Austin  TX,241,331,10,8/20/2013,4.0,This one is a very nice place. I like the food and it is cool just to look at everything that is in there. Great place to hang.
Sam B.,Philadelphia  PA,71,431,108,8/13/2013,3.0,Like the many different types of beer and drinks to choose from  and this location is not usually crowded. Food is ok too  lots of options.
CJ M.,Elgin  TX,0,4,,1/28/2014,5.0,My family loves this place. Has a vast selection of food and drinks that are good to the taste buds. Kid friendly with a very large childrens menu. Would recommend this to anyone.
Nancy S.,Austin  TX,18,14,,11/30/2011,3.0,So i ate here with a friend before going to the movies. it was 6 oclock ish  which is usually the dinner rush  and it seemed pretty full but we were seated pretty fast. The menu is pretty big  for drinks and food. We both ordered the Irish red beer which was pretty tasty.My friend ordered the santa fe salad which looked pretty loaded and delicious. i ordered the bbq chick chopped salad. His looked way better than mine... Full of avocado and veggies and a good dressing.. Mine looked like a bowl of shredded iceberg lettuce with a few pieces of chicken and random pieces of corn. i was kinda disappointed.. Someone else's review of this salad said it was awesome and delicious  so maybe they were having an off night? Although we also split a side of the mac and cheese and the cheese was watery  didnt really stay on the pasta.Our server was friendly  cant complain about anything there. She did check on us a good amount and stayed on top of drink refills and such..Atmosphere  good. Service  good. Food  ok.
Jenny P.,Pflugerville  TX,1,19,10,9/11/2013,4.0,Visited here Sunday 8/11 and had a great experience. I have been to BJ's before and honestly was underwhelmed both times. This visit was great and I believe our server was Cameron. He was awesome from start to finish and the gluten free pizza was just what i was craving.
Nick C.,Pflugerville  TX,2,107,,7/24/2013,3.0,I have been to the Arbor Walk and the one out in Round Rock near the outlet malls. This place is good but a bit pricey for the portion size. The food was served warm and tasted well prepared. The feel is very much California-ish. The booths can be small and some of the tables are oddly placed but it is ok for a change of pace. When you go you can play like you are in a real city in California and not in the hinterlands of Texas.Be nice if one of the televisions wasn't play sports and the noise leevl was addressed. All hard surfaces and the place can get very loud.
Gabriel D.,Austin  TX,40,19,2,7/20/2011,4.0,Just on a whim we thought we'd try BJ's for lunch and were pleasantly surprised. While the place was pretty packed we had plenty of space and our waiter Chris was right on time and helpful in every way. Everything was served timely and perfectly at temp.While we peeked at the regular prices (that seemed kind of high) the lunch prices were actually pretty decent. There were even handcrafted beers on drought for only $3. All together I think only spent about $21 for the two of us including some very yummy beer. The food portions were smaller of course but more than filling and very delicious. We'll definitely be back for lunch again soon!
Heather R.,Pflugerville  TX,61,34,11,12/11/2012,4.0,Went there this past weekend and food was very good! Service was OK and love the atmosphere!
Dawnielle A.,Austin  TX,32,19,3,6/26/2011,3.0,"Today was my second time going to this brand new place in the Arbor Walk area. The first time my boyfriend and I went during lunch. They have a great selection for a lunch menu. The soups are excellent! But what got me the most is that our server didn\'t know anything about the menu. I would ask the server what comes on the wedge salad (because I am a huge fan of wedge salads) and she replied ""I don\'t know.""The first thing I learned as a server or any position in the restaurant is to know your menu so you can sell it. The server couldn\'t sell me on anything.Again  today was the second time being there. The hostess was very friendly; however  told me that I could sit at a high top if I wanted to. It was just me and I don\'t want to take up a table that could sit 6 people. I asked if I could sit outside. There really wasn\'t a wait which was really cool. In the shade it felt fabulous!The person who escorted me outside was very friendly and helpful. I completely thought that he was my server. He was kind enough to get me some water while I wait for my server. That was very sweet of him!However  my turn-off about this place is that I sat outside for over 5 minutes with no one to greet me. I read the entire menu twice and was ready for a nice cold beer. Many servers came outside and not one said ""Someone will be right with you."" I could understand that if someone did say that but they didn\'t. I went to go talk to the manager not looking for any handouts. I just wanted to let him know about what kind of service I got so he can make his restaurant better. He was super nice and pleaded for me to stay. I told him that I wasn\'t into it anymore but don\'t worry I will be back. I will be back and I hope my next server will know what they are doing. I tell you your tip can be whatever you really want it to be if you just pay attention."
Jon C.,Austin  TX,43,34,1,2/26/2013,4.0,Awesome service! The manager and server checked on us even with a busy floor. Our drinks were always full and our appetizer and food came out quick! I told them I was under a time limit due to being called into work and they did a fantastic job! I had the Shrimp Scampi and will be back for more!! Thanks guys!
Adam M.,Austin  TX,67,130,38,2/20/2013,4.0,Good service  yummy food  good beer  very minimal wait-time. I will return.
Art C.,Hutto  TX,234,100,50,1/13/2013,3.0,I had a good burger on their second try. The first one was incredibly salty. They promptly remade my order and it was fairly enjoyable. I would go back and give them a second chance. Good beer.
Hillary H.,Austin  TX,3,4,2,5/18/2013,4.0,My boyfriend & I came here for the first time the other day. The burgers were in our top 10 faves. We liked the sampler of beer you could try. Pretty nifty. Our waiter was also weird yet friendly. I liked it. We will come back here!
Greg M.,Austin  TX,1,7,1,3/24/2012,4.0,Great place. We've come here dozens of times but it never gets old. Deep dish pizza is delicious down to the crust (My kid tried the gluten- free thin crust today  and it was superb!)  voluminous salads (Italian Market Salad is awesome  others like the Garden Medley Salad are soggy and not worth it)  terrific subs (I tried the Angus Roast Beef Dip  seriously some of the best stuff you can get)  large variety of appetizers that are all equally unique and yummy... And don't forget the draft beer! Service is usually great  although there are occasionally some dips. Huge TVs all around the vast room  just right for those sport fanatics to get enough out of their game while not so overwhelming for those who want a quiet meal. One of my favorites. I will be back!
Bill S.,Austin  TX,1,6,,10/10/2011,1.0,Atmosphere was nice  but the food was awful. We ordered Crispy Fried Artichokes and Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms as appetizers. The artichokes were awful and tasted like the vinegar brine that low-end canned artichokes come in. We couldn't eat them. The mushrooms were thoroughly bland and had no flavor at all. I had ice tea and my wife ordered a marguerita. She said her drink tasted like it had been made with ice in a blender rather than in a frozen marguerita machine. She said it barely had any taste other than ice. I had the Tuscan Chicken Limone. I chose a minestrone soup. The soup looked and tasted exactly like Progresso's canned minestrone. The entree tasted like it had just been warmed up in the microwave. The pasta did not appear to be fresh. The artichokes in it tasted just like the ones in the appetizer  a heavy brine taste. I couldn't eat them either. It was supposed to come with fresh steamed baby spinach. There were only 3 leaves of it on my plate. My wife had the Brewhouse Blond Shrimp. She had the broccoli-cheddar soup with it. It also looked and tasted like fresh out of the can. The description of her entree suggested a lightly battered  tempura-like crust  very lightly fried entree. What came on her plate was very dark  deep fried  corn meal encrusted  barely edible shrimp. My wife ate two of them. I tasted one and didn't want another bite. The cole slaw was inedible; however the thin crispy fries were very tasty. The service was adequate  but not exceptional. To her credit  our waitress took the artichoke appetizer off our ticket when we told her how bad they were. We are not restaurant snobs. We have favorite places  both chain and local. We like to occasionally try new places. We always hope for the best  but BJ's Brewery came closer to the worst. I would have considered the prices reasonable if the food had been tasty. It's too bad the food doesn't match the atmosphere of this restaurant. We will not return or ever recommend it.
Destinee W.,Denton  TX,99,163,20,12/7/2012,5.0,LEGIT... like too legit to quit; BEER is amazing; friendly service and from what i have had excelent food meatball  alittle sweet but very well made as is the peice of bread it comes with also the buffalo style chicken wontons (wowzza) and the were so price respectable. i know that this a chain but this place is great
Mario P.,Katy  TX,72,164,370,2/4/2014,4.0,Ok  I've been to a few BJs and when traveling   I often sit at the bar. Today was no exception. Brittani was my bartender and waitress in one . She did a fabulous job of taking care of me. Even when the kitchen ran behind on my spinach stuff mushrooms  she was able to fill the gap with great suggestions and timely visits to check. Though it did come out a bit late  the snack appetizer had a very good taste. I had a couple of beers to start  a Oasis ( BJs brew and a Stone Arrogant Bastard { love the name } and both were very good. Next I ordered the Limone Chicken Pasta dish based on her recommendation. Ok. Here's the skinny on this dish. The sun dried tomatoes and artichokes hearts in the dish  AWESOME  angel hair pasta  OK. Th chicken  I'm split on. I got 2 pieces and one was full of flavor and the other totally absent. I can't even begin to explain how that happened. The sauce was good. Oh   baby Spinach was ok. Overall the fish was a 3  service a 5 and beers a 4. Will I be back. Yes  especially if they keep great employees like Brittani around!!!
Rusty W.,Austin  TX,1,7,,9/8/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Yesterday was my second visit to BJ's  and I would have to stay it is a step down from my previous experience. I was seated fairly quickly with my party of 10 or so  and my server was pretty good. I tried my friend's hose made Root Beer  and I have to say it was excellent. I ordered the bone-in New York Steak cooked medium  with a side of clam chowder and loaded baked potato. The clam chowder came out first and I was surprised at the portion size  larger than expected. It tasted good  but was nothing special. The steak temperature was spot on  but the taste was bland  as if there were no seasoning  or if the seasoning was put on after the cooking  not cooked into the meat. The only complaint I have about service is that I asked for the loaded baked potato  which in my experience comes with butter  cheese  sour cream  and in some cases bacon bits. I only received the butter and sour cream  no cheese or bacon bits. This was not a huge deal for me personally  but is important as a service point and in presentation. I will be back eventually  but probably not for a steak.
Maureen S.,Greensboro  NC,17,35,8,3/3/2012,4.0,Great selection of beers on tap and knowledgeable bartenders. I highly recommend the avocado egg rolls the garden medley salad.
Ryan A.,Austin  TX,172,38,1,12/24/2011,3.0,"Generally speaking  I\'m a very forgiving person when it comes to poor service and/or bad food. I\'m a firm believer that everyone deserves a second (or in this case  third) chance to account for any unusual circumstances which are bound to happen in the service industry. Unfortunately  BJ\'s used up the last of its three chances today when a friend and I tried it out for lunch. We arrived around 2:30 or 3:00 to a mostly empty restaurant and a very friendly greeting from the hostess and were sat immediately. We were greeted semi-promptly by our server who took our drink order and returned with water (until my beer arrived) and a soda for my friend. He then asked me what I had ordered to drink because he forgot. Eh  it happens...no big deal. Five minutes go by with no beer. A few more go by before our server walks by the table and says ""What happened to your beer? They told me it went out!"" I jokingly say ""Where did it go?"" and proceed to speculate as to why my beer has now taken nearly ten minutes to find our table during lunch  when service should be much quicker than any other time of day. He left the table  went to the bar  returned to our table and told me that they were changing the keg at the moment. I attempted to order a different beer  in hopes that I would actually get it  but our server said that the beer I had initially ordered would be up when he returned to the bar. Finally  after at least ten minutes of waiting  I was sipping on a nice  cold  delicious beer. It was then that I decided that I would not be ordering another and that it would be best for me to make this one last throughout the duration of the meal.After the beer situation was sorted out  we went unacknowledged for a few minutes more before our order was taken. My friend tried to order a lunch item  which is only available Monday through Friday. Ok  fine  we didn\'t see the fine print at the top of the lunch menu...our mistake  but that doesn\'t change the fact that only offering a special lunch menu Monday - Friday is just plain silly. We ordered our entrees along with an appetizer and two salads. Tick  tock  tick  tock  tick  tock  tick  tock.....A stone-faced  emotionless server (not our own) arrives with the appetizer we ordered  sets it on the table  and walks away without a friendly greeting/salutation  or asking whether we needed anything else at the moment.Tick  tock  tick  tock  tick  tock  tick  tock.....A manager arrives at our table with both or our salads in hand and greets us with a very friendly salutation  asks if we need anything else  and walks away  never once acknowledging the fact that his restaurant is running at the pace of a dead turtle.Tick  tock  tick  tock  tick  tock  tick  tock.....Tick  tock  tick  tock  tick  tock  tick  tock.....Tick  tock  tick  tock  tick  tock  tick  tock.....Tick  tock  tick  tock  tick  tock  tick  tock.....Our entrees fiiiinnnaaalllyyyyyy arrive at LEAST a half hour after we ordered them. Our server delivered our food and acknowledged that fact that they had taken much longer than they should have to come out and that he had alerted his manager  who was in the process of ""yelling at the kitchen"" for the long time order. Food quality is consistently okay here and both my friend and I were satisfied with what we ordered. At $13.00 per entree at lunch time  you get what you pay for.An hour and a half  and $40 later  we found ourselves asking for the check ASAP after our food was delivered at our table  since we didn\'t know how long it would take for it to be delivered. Strangely enough  it was on the table a minute or two after we had asked for it. Hmmm....?!On my previous two visits to BJ\'s (both during dinner)  I\'ve not had anything to be unhappy about. The service was as prompt as could be expected for a moderately busy dinner shift  our server was extremely friendly and skilled  and the food was good. Unfortunately  this experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and I can definitely see myself not returning. The ONLY reason I could see myself returning is because of their awesome beer selection. Sorry to say it  BJ\'s  but unless you get it together and significantly improve your level of service  I\'ll steer clear."
Jim A.,Austin  TX,3,50,,6/18/2014,4.0,"Food a little better than average  and a huge menu means you will probably find what you want. Not a fan of the ""craft"" beers the sell and staff not familiar with the beer products. Overall a good experience and will go back."
Aaron L.,Ventura  CA,15,18,10,4/15/2013,4.0,I always enjoy BJ's and frankly it is a great place to have some pizza and drinks. I am a fan of this chain of restaurants. it has a great atmosphere and staff.
Janet Z.,Pflugerville  TX,163,16,,12/14/2011,2.0,I have tried this restaurant 3 times- twice for lunch and once for dinner. The food is pretty good- a standout is the thin crust pizza appetizer-- very good. The service is among the worst I have experienced. Wait times are very long and they often do not bring you what you ask for until 2-3 times asked. Would not return due to poor service.
Leslie P.,Austin  TX,0,44,,9/2/2014,5.0,Love BJ's! Everything I've had there has been good. Corn Fritters rock and the tomato bisque in the sourdough loaf is the bomb. I've always had good service (unlike some reviewers) Only 1 time did I have an issue but it was resolved. Great for lunch! Have never been for dinner so can't comment.
Angelica S.,Austin  TX,47,471,2,9/15/2012,4.0,Bj's is a little pricey but the service is good and so is the food  I recently went here with my family and ordered the fish n chips. My husband ordered the grilled pork chops and I am ticked that I didn't order those instead! The pork chops are soooooo goooooood. I'd go back just for that alone. yum!
Sandra P.,Austin  TX,22,7,3,2/28/2013,5.0,OMG! I love this place! Love it  Love It  LOVE IT! The food is awesome. Portions are not so big that you feel like you are eating at a trough. Just really good and delicious food. The tomato bisque tastes like Long Island pizza ~ so help me  it is true. Will be going back every chance I get unless something changes..... Thank you  BJR&B
Connie I.,Austin  TX,0,3,,4/16/2012,2.0,On quality of food alone  I would give this restaurant a 4  but given service is just as important to us  we give it a 2. We've been 4 times now and service has been poor 3 out of 4. :(We won't be returning
Nibbler ..,Seligenstadt  Germany,11,44,,8/7/2011,1.0,C'mon people  this is Austin. You don't have to spend your money eating aweful tastless food and washing it down with overpriced beer. It's Applebees with a beer selection. We immediately went to Draughthouse to wash the corporate taste out of our mouths. One star for our waiter that was actually pretty good.
Aiden C.,Austin  TX,28,16,5,7/21/2012,4.0,"I like the BJ\'s on MoPac. It is not a hipster hangout with live music and trendy drinks. What BJ\'s has is consistent service  American comfort food  and drinks that don\'t contain lavender or elderflower. My favorite cocktail  is the beverage named ""That One Drink"". The drinks are strong  have good flavors  and don\'t require a chemistry degree to comprehend. If you are looking for a place with lots of TVs to watch the game  a 20+ selection of beers on tap  and solid burger and food choices including several fresh salad choices  BJ\'s is a fine place to chill."
Marisa P.,Austin  TX,4,54,11,3/13/2014,2.0,"My Asian salad was great! The fries were tasty. The calamari portion was a joke (literally about half the size as the menu depicts). My husband\'s burger with ""crispy friend jalapeos"" had one crispy jalapeo...the rest had no breading and no crisp. The service was among the worst. Their cider tasted like Boone\'s Farm taking me back to my underage drinking days. No sign of a manager. Did I mention the service sucked? Do yourself a favor and order to-go if you absolutely must try their food. Their beer wasn\'t that great anyway."
Christina F.,Pflugerville  TX,10,2,,6/5/2011,1.0,I ate here for the first time ever for lunch on a Wednesday. Everything was going good until one waitress brought out our appetizer. She somehow tripped another waitress walking by and I got a full glass of tea and a full glass of water down my left side. I was drenched. It took the managers 5 minutes to come to our table and for someone to clean up the mess. When we asked for the manager to replace my drink which was in the line of fire and he asked my why. Seriously??? Since the mess wasn't our mistake  I was hoping that something would have been comped. When we got our bill  they only took $1 off each of our alcoholic drinks  so $2 total. I went onto their website the next day & told them my frustrations with their service  its been almost 2 weeks and have yet to hear from someone. Will never go there again!!!!!
Philip G.,Austin  TX,5,54,,7/28/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,UPDATE 7/26/12Had a not-so-great experience this last time. We sat at the bar  and that was a mistake. They make sure you know everyone's name behind the bar because they expect you to flag them down if you need something. Maybe it's just me  but I expect a waiter or bartender to check on me  not the other way around. As a result I had to wait a little too long to place an order and to get a refill on my drink.Maybe that's what led to the mistake that ensued: I ordered a calzone. I figured if the pizzas are really good  the calzones are probably just as good. But first I was served the wrong order. They brought me someone else's calzone  so obviously I sent it back. I got the correct one soon enough  but it was almost half dough. That was a big disappointment. Paying that much for just a loaf of bread just isn't right. I said as much to the server  who just agreed that yes  it was a lot of dough.I'm sure I will return here  but I have to lower the rating for now.*********This place reeks of chain restaurant  but that's not entirely bad. The ambience is raucous and loud  and given that there is a huge -- and I mean HUGE -- set of 4 TV screens behind the bar it stays like that most of the time. If you can ignore that everything else about this place is good. The TV screens obviously makes this place a sports bar type of place  but the food is a step up from that kind of food. If you've experienced Cover 2 and Cover 3  B.J.'s tries to be that kind of place.The pizzas are their specialty. They are very good  actually. I have had the Meat Lover's equivalent. I liked it. Unless you're barely hungry you should get a small. The mini is barely more than a pizza roll.The seared ahi tuna small bite is actually very good. Be careful with the wasabi  though. It's about twice as strong as any wasabi I've had with sushi  so it can be overpowering.My choice the past couple of times has been a salad. Their BBQ chicken chopped salad is excellent. This last time I tried the honey chicken salad. It was ok. Not that great  but still good. I tried it with the bleu cheese dressing  but the dressing had gone bad. If you try anything with the bleu cheese dressing ask for it on the side. It can go bad.Their beer selection is very good. If you're looking for a place to go just for the beer and some pub food to watch a game  this is an excellent option. They have seasonal beers that rotate in and out of their lineup  as well as plenty of other domestic and international choices.It's a great place for parties and groups.
Laura G.,Austin  TX,8,11,1,7/30/2011,1.0,"The boyfriend and I hoped visiting BJ\'s would provide us with a new local pub that served both great food and beer. I should have know it was not to be when my arm almost broke due to weight of menus the hostess handed me. The interior of this ""pub"" is not pub like whatsoever  it is more of a steakhouse decor than anything else. Dark  dreary and cold! We opted for the bar which seemed more inviting due to better lighting. Now to tackle that menu... I immediately had unpleasant flashback to Cheesecake Factory visit where I developed a headache reading the 50 page menu. BJ\'s menu is overwhelming and overpriced for what they offer. They are trying way to hard. The cheapest beer in the house was 4.95?? Oh but wait its HH the beers are all 1$ off (menu page 15 stated). So okay we try some of their specialty brewed beers and two appetizers (I\'ll stick to apps when a burger is 11$).Sadly the disappointment continued ... The beers were the best part of the visit  though not great they were solid (hence the one star). The app sampler plater that we ordered ""to try all our best apps"" was cold and unoriginal. I could have put this platter together gathering samples at Costco on a Saturday afternoon! The avocado egg rolls were literally disgusting (boyfriend disposed of his bite in napkin discretely). They were tasteless  oliy and mushy with a weird yet horrific honey sauce?? The mini burgers were better but hard to mess those up and for 10$ I will make my own.We got the check as soon as possible still hungry and thirsty. The service is unimpressive  the food is horrible and the beer you could find somewhere else cheaper. I wish this place would have stayed in Dallas because it has no place in Austin."
Konrad H.,Ozark  AR,8,137,33,5/17/2012,4.0,I've always had decent chain food at this location. I would not order a steak here it's not a steak house. They do a splendid job of having a Gluten Free and Food Allergy meny which lists the common allegens in their menu items. They also have a decent selection Ciders that are Gluten Free.
Alfred L.,Round Rock  TX,0,54,,11/4/2011,4.0,Personally  I think the name of the Restaurant blows (pause for laughter). OK  now that we've gotten the inappropriate jokes out of the way  lets get to business. I walked into Bj's already having information about the place. The CEO here once ran Cheesecake Factory  so I had great expectations. This place would be CCF if CCF painted their ceilings black  pushed the dimmer switch down a little bit more and placed several big screens around the place. It has a louder  more festive atmosphere than CCF. Its nice. A good place to bring a date and they stay open on weekends til 1am. Yay! No more having to go to the taco stands at Rundberg and Lamar with my wife backed up against me  her hand in her purse with her finger on the trigger of her Glock while I try to scarf down a few taquitos...The CEO brought along some nuances of CCF in case you missed going there:1. Waiters with aprons (white over black  instead of white over white)2. Telephone book menu that you need a Kindle to read through3. attentive food servers4. nice atmosphere5. large portionsI had the crispy jalapeno burger with fires. My wife had some huge salad  I think it was Sante Fe something or other. They were both very good. reminded us of Cheesecake factory  or have I mentioned this already? For dessert  we had a red velvet pizookie. Think cookie dough placed in the oven  then taken out at just the right time and slap on two scoops of vanilla. We rolled our way out to the parking lot minutes later.Price alert!! They call it a Brewhouse because they brew their own beer. No problem. The food servers go out of their way to steer you to their home brews. Good strategy  no problem. Each pint is $6.00. Problem. Well  problem for me anyways  b/c I'm a cheap ass  but for the record  the blonde brew house is a good flavorful beer but the pumpkin ale? It was like tapping into a fresh pumpkin with a straw. But I still drank it. So  if the price of their beer is not an issue for you then go ahead. For another $1  you could go to HEB and buy a six pack of Miller lites. Over all  I would still come back for the food and I'll drink my beer elsewhere.
Kellie H.,Lee's Summit  MO,45,57,,8/27/2011,2.0,We went here for dinner yesterday (Friday)  it was pretty busy but the wait wasn't long. After we got seated our waitress brought our waters then walked off not even asking if we were ready to order (which we were)  we waited another 5 minutes to order. Then we waited for our food for a good 10+ minutes which was very frustrating considering what we ordered shouldn't take that long. After we got our food the waitress only came by once and then disappeared for about 10 more minutes while we waited for our plates to be taken. My husband wanted to get the pizookie (which is delicious and a must at BJ's) so of course we waited yet again. I think we spend a good hour + at this restaurant waiting and waiting. I was not impressed at all. We lived in the Bay Area for years and every time we had bad service so it's not just this BJ's  unfortunately it's an all around bad service chain.
Kali R.,Austin  TX,7,80,,4/26/2012,1.0,This place is two for two for me in disappointment. The first time I tried it  months ago  I cut it slack because it had opened fairly recently  but my burger was on the stalest bun I have ever tasted. I brought it to the waiter's attention and he shrugged me off  but when the manager came by  I pointed it out to him as being inedible. Props to him for going back to the kitchen and discovering that the entire bag of whole wheat buns were in that condition. My meal was comped and I figured I would give it another try in the futureFail  part deux. This time I brought my mother along after a Dr. appt. in the area and she ordered the broiled tilapia while I tried the soup and salad combo featuring clam chowder. The chowder was hot and tasty; the salad was insipid and forgettable. But that wasn't the big problem. The waiter brought my entire meal out nearly 15 minutes before my mother's meal arrived. I was forced to go ahead and at least eat my soup before it got cold  while my Mom got the dubious pleasure of watching me. To top off the questionable experience (BTW  the waiter never came by before bringing her entree out)  Mom's tilapia meal was lukewarm. We opted not to spend the additional time for them to warm it up and again  when the manager came by  we pointed out the problems and suggested that when entrees like this are delivered  it is usual to bring the salad out ahead (if the patron agrees)  but not a great choice to bring the entire lunch for one while the other waits. He agreed and they comped half of the check. I don't know how they can survive with this kind of performance  but I will not be going there again. There are too many good options in that location.
Peylin F.,Austin  TX,66,137,,9/14/2011,3.0,BJs reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory (their menu is like a book just like Cheesecake's) but with lots of tvs for sports watching  so that is a plus. This review is only based on their pizza since that's all I've had the few times I've gone. People have raved about their pizza the most  so I figure why not try it? If you like Chicago  deep dish style pizza  then you'll like what BJs offers. The pizzas might not look that big  but since the slices are so thick  you fill up pretty quickly. The sweet pig pizza (Pineapple  seasoned tomatoes and oven-roasted ham) is just your typical hawaiian pizza  and the BJ's favorite pizza (Oven-baked meatballs  pepperoni  Italian sausage  mushrooms  green peppers  black olives  white onions and seasoned tomatoes) is just like a fancy shmancy supreme pizza. Both were pretty tasty and worth having again.We did take advantage of their 2 for $20 deal which comes with a side salad  a pizza to share  and a pizookie to share. I admit that I went with this deal because I really wanted to try their pizookie  which according to them is a deep dish cookie topped with ice cream. Supposedly this is what they are famous for (besides their beer). The side salad? Meh. Nothing to write home about. The pizza was good as usual  but the biggest disappointment was the pizookie. We ordered the white chocolate macadamia with vanilla bean ice cream. Any warm dessert a la mode is good  but I was expecting something bigger and thicker. The cookie was pretty thin  and it was a bit too sweet. The ice cream did balance it out  but in the end we had more ice cream than cookie left  which normally doesn't happen. I compare their pizookie to the cookie monster at Cheddar's  and the cookie monster is SO much better. The only thing that the pizookie has going for it is the fact that you have many types to choose from.If I come back again  I'll probably check it out during happy hour and take advantage of the half deal on their mini pizzas which is probably the perfect size for me.
David L.,Pflugerville  TX,3,19,,5/10/2012,5.0,Been twice already  enjoyed both visits. Our first time we went with burgers  hard to mess up burgers. Our second time  got the pot roast...delicious  but well under-portioned for the price. However  I will continue to return primarily for the vast beer selection. Being from Hawai'i  it's rare to see an island brew on the menu...they do! Also really enjoy their home brewed blonde lager...light and on point perfectly paired for a lunch meal  that's usually when we go.
Carolyn B.,Sparks  NV,1,5,,10/17/2011,4.0,Yay I was so glad to see they opened close to my house! I tried my friends gluten free margherita pizza and it was delicious. Our waiter had a great sense of humor and he was very helpful with our menu questions. Yes it was pricey but we'll be back.
Sandra O.,Austin  TX,0,24,,9/25/2013,2.0,We walked out paying $76 for a large pizza  calamari  4 mixed drinks! It's way too pricy for what you get. Their restaurant is nice and seemed clean but not worth the money. Not returning!!
Aaron H.,Round Rock  TX,264,79,19,8/8/2013,5.0,i always have a great time at bj's. food's decent and the environment is always pleasant. i particularly like the bar area with plenty of tvs to watch various sporting events. thus far  servers have been great all the way around.
Rebecca W.,Austin  TX,8,18,,8/12/2012,4.0,The Sesame Chicken Salad is yummy as were the Mahi Tacos  the tacos are prepared either grilled or fried. We have been there a few times and service can be hit or miss  as sometimes the waitstaff is a little slow. The other salad that we have both enjoyed is the Thai Chicken Salad as I'm not a beer drinker I would defer to someone else to comment on the beers brewed in house.
Larris W.,Houston  TX,24,20,16,6/5/2011,4.0,The staff and food was awesome. Good first impression!!
Bunnie T.,Austin  TX,0,5,,8/6/2012,1.0,This review is about the food. Ordered steak and vegetables. My ticket was dropped so my companions got their dinners and I did not. When my dinner arrived 10 minutes later the rib-eye steak was covered in pepper - and therefore tasted like pepper. Also the steak was raw inside. My companions were asked to check their steak doneness but I was not. The WORST vegetables ever. They were raw. Huge chunks of squash and cauliflower. The green beans were barely cooked. None of the vegies were seasoned with anything and the steak was over seasoned. Even my iced tea was watered down and tasteless. The wait service was not good either. Waiter kept interrupting us. He seemed fine with talking to us but could not remember to refill my tea. I had to ask many times. Also waiter did not know the beer menu. Speaking of the menu - it's way too big and the pages stick together.Expensive - you get much better deal at Applebees and food is much better.Lo-carbers BEWARE - BJs salads have carby stuff in them.We'll not be going back.
Kip C.,Austin  TX,19,127,,2/2/2012,1.0,What is in a name... Ahem! wink wink nudge nudge. Ok but seriously this place is terrible! Its always over crowded and the food $VCKS. I've only gone when I tagged along with a big group of people for a birthday not on my own free will. I lived in San Diego dbag city and these places riddled every exit on the freeway. I guess this reminds me too much of SoCal being so close to the domain. If you like bad food and beer I highly recomend this place!
Stephen P.,Georgetown  TX,36,72,7,7/16/2012,4.0,I went here for a good birthday lunch  had a nice steak with some steamed veggies and cheesy mashed taters  it was pretty baller i must say.. Plenty of room with a nice huge sports bar with huge tv's and paintings on the wall  almost as if this restaurant has different seasons you can experience.. The also brew their own beer and it is great! The stout was delicious! Worth a try for sure!
Jennifer H.,McAllen  TX,55,340,144,12/5/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,The avocado rolls were delicious  so stuffed with a nice sauce to dip it in. The fresh basil and Italian sausage flatbread nice and crispy. go for traditional wings and a drink at the bar  the bartender takes good care of you  and will humor your own mix of fruity drink you want to create on the spot lol. The place has cool happy hour atmosphere  great for hanging out with friends. They have big party deals if pizza  wings  sides  etc. must try.
Tom M.,Austin  TX,37,217,37,12/27/2011,3.0,Your standard corporate casual with a brewhouse included. Not bad. Because of the location it has been added to our lunch rotation. Service is adequate and they seem to get people in and out pretty well since we have yet to experience a lunch rush wait. What is with the Marxist art?
Jess V.,Austin  TX,0,13,,9/27/2012,4.0,A good old restaurant! I like the atmosphere and the food is pretty standard (in a good way). It's nothing fancy or out of this world  but it's just good food for a night out. I've been there 3 times now and everything I ate was great (pizza  burger  pasta). It can get a bit loud  so careful if you want a nice intimate night out  such as a date. It's a step up from Chili's  and it definitely won't break your wallet. Just a cozy fun place to be on a Friday night with friends.
David A.,Clarksville  TN,4,87,1,2/6/2012,3.0,Very good pizza with some decent beers but LOUD. We ate here as a party of four on a Friday night and had to wait for about 20 minutes. It is a typical mid-level restaurant so they gave you a buzzer and you had the option of waiting at the bar but it was packed. The service was below par. I had to wait about eight minutes for her to fix a drink order during which she passed our table three times (she forgot to bring a slice of lime with the drink). The brewery has some of it's own brews but nothing really stood out. The food itself was very good I thought. I had a small pizza and the cheese and ingredients tasted great. I would go back  but wouldn't make a habit of it.
Seth A.,Fitchburg  MA,0,5,,2/19/2014,3.0,Went to BJ's today for lunch to watch the end of the USA Olympic ice hockey game. When I arrived at BJ's there was a hockey game on all the TV's  but it was the Canadian game. I asked for the USA game to be put on the TV and they put it on one small TV. The last time I checked I was in America. If they want to watch the Canadian national team play  move the restaurant to Canada. The food was ok. I asked the server to 86 the tomato's on my burger and guess what  the burger came with tomatoes. It is the attention to details that would get this place a higher ranking. Well that and playing the USA hockey game on TV at a bar in the greatest country in the world  USA!!! I guess when USA plays this Friday  I will take a road trip to Ontario to see if I can watch them play there. Actually  I don't have to worry about that  as USA plays Canada. I guess we know which team BJ's will be rooting for. Here's a hint  they go by America's hat. In case you don't know what that means  here's another hint. The country starts with a C and rhymes with ana-da.
Steven P.,Austin  TX,6,20,15,7/23/2011,2.0,"We went on a Saturday  5:30 PM. GOOD: Creole tilapia  cream soda.NOT GOOD: Acoustics. I like a noisy restaurant  but the flat surfaces and mirrors bounce sound all over  making conversation and hearing the waitress difficult. Pot roast. When the plate arrived  it featured a pile of mashed potatoes like the one in Close Encounters bit.ly/pd27Pz   dwarfing the pieces of pot roast  which combined were somewhere less than six ounces  and at least one ounce of that was fat. We asked the waitress if that was a normal serving and she said ""Yes  let me get a manager."" Service. The waitress asks ""Is this your first time at BJ\'s?"" and we answered yes  but we didn\'t get any additional information for it  she just went on with the same presentation everyone else got. She asked how the drinks were before they had been touched. When the manager showed up (well after we had started eating)  it wasn\'t ""can I help you with something"" but ""the waitress said I needed to talk to you."" No thank you  we\'re done here."
Brandon L.,Austin  TX,0,5,,7/20/2012,2.0,You know  I've been looking forward to actually eating at BJs. I had been there a couple of times just for drinks. I finally had the opportunity to eat and I was kinda disappointed. I had a burger and it was just ok. Really! It tasted like a Luke warm sonic burger. The pics in the menu made it look so much better. It was bland and not worth my cheat meal. I'm kicking myself all the way to the gym! Boo  BJs!
Kaitlin F.,Boerum Hill  NY,0,4,1,6/19/2011,1.0,My boyfriend and I got food poisoning from the barbecue chicken pizza here. Worst experience ever. Stay away unless you want to go to the hospital.
Courtney E.,Pflugerville  TX,131,78,27,10/8/2011,5.0,My husband and I have eaten at BJ's in Sugarland  so we knew the food was good for a chain restaurant. This time  our server Amanda made the experience a true five star visit. Amanda was engaging  knowledgeable  genuinely friendly  and the food was delicious. We will come back and hope to see Amanda again! BJ's is lucky to have her on their staff.
Greg S.,Austin  TX,3,59,,11/11/2011,4.0,"Color. It\'s what any aspiring ""great"" restaurant must have in both food presentation and ambiance to be successful. BJs has both. Love a place that has a splashiness about it? Tell you one thing...it was packed pre-lunch hour. That tell you anything. It certainly falls under the same category as the old saying about what separates a good Chinese restaurant from a poor one. If there\'s a line outside waiting to get in the food must be aces. No line at BJs put the joint was jumping with celebratory and business-oriented (I suppose) conversation. The open bar is all the way open. Just enter and look to your right. In the right spirit for spirits? A colorful array of beer and booze enablers await you. After hearing my mother brag about the quality of the food on more than one occasion I had to make a point of stopping by. That\'s a use of at liberty time any Veteran\'s Day holiday observer would be proud of. The only places I can recall being this inviting from an interior standpoint would have to be Dave & Buster\'s and Pappadeaux\'s. They spare no expense to roll out the full red carpet of culinary enticements. The decor whets your whistle for what you\'ll soon be ordering. There\'s a long aisle full of booth space. You\'ll even notice candelabras off to the left. Onward and most definitely upwards to the food we go. I went with the safe bet house salad. Cucumbers were beefy. The carrots were a thinly sliced visual feast. The balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing had some classy zing to it. One thing I noticed about the croutons that isn\'t usually a given with most salads of this persuasion. They weren\'t overly crunchy. Your teeth sort of sink into the soft level of crunch. Fine by me. Gives me more room to savor the whole grain flavor. On this day the main course was plucked straight from the old reliable section of the menu known as SANDWICHES. Be prepared to either have ample leftovers or a best bud with a hollow leg who doesn\'t main doing his fair share to both satisfy his own cravings and keep those dollars rolling into the national economy. Exhibit A was the grilled chicken club. This monster\'s a two-handed job for sure. The marinated chicken breast was blissfully tender. The bacon was suitably crunchy. Don\'t take that last reveal for granted. I\'ve had bacon-filled sandwiches in some establishments where the bacon was tough and overly stringy. Those aren\'t two traits I like in my bacon. If it crunches and you can taste the beads of grease forming on your tongue I\'m the proverbial happy customer. I\'ll forgive the line staff for not omitting the roasted garlic mayo as I requested in my lame ass attempt to show a little restraint. It added something divine to the overall taste. The grilled sourdough bread it\'s served on at least in terms of appearance reminded me of the grilled cheese sandwich grill marks Mom made for me as kid. Trust me the sourdough is the perfect flavor match for what\'s sitting in between. All the sandwich possibilities that don\'t answer to the name of ""Burger"" come with either wedge-cut or thin and crispy fries. I ordered the latter. Time to get that best bud to  as you seem to always see articulated in the Sports section during crunch time moments  step up. Generous doesn\'t even begin to describe this heap of slashed spuds. You could pick your teeth with them to dislodge the sandwich remains. They\'re that thin. What they lack in size they make up for in taste. Neato with a capital N. Had I eaten them all there would have been no room in my gullet for...Dessert. Your physician shudders at the word. Your ultra-sensitive side seeks it out with Pavlovian regularity. I don\'t want to be part of a world where the possibility of partaking of it doesn\'t exist. BJs has you covered. I\'d have to have ""dumb"" writ large on my forehead were I to refuse one of their noteworthy Pizookies. Just say that word and you\'re six years old again. Two dessert classics I humbly bow down to are Cookies \'n\' Cream ice cream and Oreos. You wouldn\'t be considered quackers if  upon polishing off the Cookies \'n\' Cream Pizookie  you\'d officially claimed you just had a religious experience. Heavenly Oreo cookie  yummy be thy name  thy reason for being  let yourself be adorned by 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and Cookies \'n\' Cream mousse. Infidels need not enter the kingdom of decadence. Wasn\'t it Billy Joel who said ""I\'d rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints?"" LMAO.The waitstaff was on its game. Finished plates were taken away on the spot. My server  upon noticing I wasn\'t quite finished with dessert promised he wasn\'t trying to rush me. How often are you made to feel like a valued customer and not just a link in the table turn over chain? That merits three stars right off.BJs is way more than OK. It\'ll tantalize you inside and out."
Miranda W.,Austin  TX,112,111,17,6/3/2011,5.0,Glad to see BJ's on the North side  finally! Great atmosphere  lots of room. The Ahi Tuna salad is the best!
Divya K.,Austin  TX,10,20,,1/5/2012,4.0,Pros: good food  ambiance  huge selection of beers and specialty drinks  pleasant wait staff  and a decent selection for vegetariansCons: situated in a horribly designed parking lot. getting in and out is not fun. food's probably unhealthy.
Kelley D.,Austin  TX,4,35,2,12/30/2011,4.0,Had lunch here the other day. We were seated very quickly in the middle of the lunch rush. The waiter was very nice  speedy  fun  and helpful. Husband and I both had burgers with fries  he the steak fries and me the skinny fries. Both kinds of fries were great! Husband is very picky about burgers not being pink when ordering them medium well and he had nothing to complain about (this is unusual). We both had the house root beer  which was the best root beer I have had  well  ever. We will be back again.
Michael C.,Austin  TX,0,7,2,2/21/2012,5.0,I eat here all the time...can't go wrong when you build your own pizza with a Harvest Hefeweizen on the side
Manoj I.,Leander  TX,4,238,19,8/3/2011,4.0,very crowded on weekends and some week days  loud  great place for friends & families to gather. Wait times can be up to 45mts on weekends and Friday evenings.The location is excellent right next to Domain. The appetizers are awesome  the entrees are great. I usually go here for Happy hour appetizers and beer. My Favorited are the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps  Avocado Egg Rolls and Crispy Calamari. They have a really good beer selection  I prefer the Piranha Pale Ale or the BJ's Jeremiah Red. The wait staff is very friendly  and I have never had problems with what I ordered. If you are seated at the bar area it might take while before they came get your order. I often have to flag the waitress down to get their attention.
Gregory B.,Austin  TX,15,92,21,8/11/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Quicker service my 2nd time there. The food was still good. That is the reason from 2 stars to 3 stars. I've been hearing from others that go there more frequently that the service is either a hit or a big miss. Watch out. I got the Creole Tilapia which was good but lacking a flavor of balsamic vinaigrette on the greens which are the side to the fish and rice meal.. However the prices are still too high with a starting house salad at 5.50. The draft beers are still expensive. Basically your entree will not below 9.00. Despite the so called deep dish pizza a place with the same feel but lacking beers on tap with smaller prices is Cheddars.
Vizslas D.,Austin  TX,2,69,1,9/2/2011,2.0,My first visit left alot to be desired. The chip and salsa were terrible. We returned them and ordered Calamari. It was pretty good but a very tiny portion for way too much $. I ordered the Calzone and thought it was going to be the size of a medium pizza turned in half. It was about the size of baseball for $10! Are you freaking kidding me? I left as hungry as I was when I got there. Some things tasty  terrible value.
Jen S.,Cedar Park  TX,9,51,2,8/2/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I think they have the kinks worked out now. We went back last night and had excellent service (thanks  Brian). Our pepperoni pizza was yummy  as was the Nit Wit seasonal beer and Berry Burst Cider. We even randomly got a Pizookie on the house :).
Latif A.,Austin  TX,27,60,,6/5/2011,3.0,There are a growing number of brewpubs popping up around Austin. Most have subpar delivery in either the food or  surprisingly  the beer; and then there are the unfortunate few that fail at both. BJ's gets it right with quality house beers and a great menu.
Todd R.,Austin  TX,0,53,,11/24/2013,3.0,Good food. Nice atmosphere. My only complaint is that my wife and I ordered house Cabernets and they were $12.50 each. That's a pricey house Cab. Ridiculous actually.
Omoniyi O.,Austin  TX,43,30,,9/14/2011,3.0,This is definitely not a bad place for lunch. Also  not bad for a chain restaurant. They have an extensive lunch menu for under $10 and it's a lot of food. I had the fish tacos and I was definitely impressed. I'm giving 3 stars for now.....hopefully I can move up to 4 stars if i go a couple more times. It also seems that they have great selection of handcrafted beers  but i'm only going on what i've heard and what my friends have said. I'm not a beer drinker  so I wouldn't know anything about taste testing. I'm sure I will be back. This looks like a good sports bar to catch some good games.
Susan S.,Austin  TX,0,6,,1/31/2014,5.0,The pizza is amazing  service is great  and the management staff is always friendly! I love the Jermiah Red! It is the best beer besides Thirsty Goat that I recommend!
Larry O.,Cedar Park  TX,0,20,,1/26/2013,1.0,The call ahead seating is a sham.  We called ahead 20 minutes before arriving  were told there was a 15 minute wait  and had them put our name on their list.  We got there in the expected 20 minutes  checked in  and were told there was a 15 minute wait.  After 20 minutes of waiting  I asked how much longer.  The answer was 15 minutes. Then they started calling people that arrived after us  but had not called ahead.  I asked what happened and the hostesses (there were about 5 of them) seemed confused  then said we were next up.  Then after 5 minutes she called someone else.  We gave up and went across the parking lot to Mighty Fine.
Amber Q.,Austin  TX,18,38,6,8/21/2011,4.0,Its huge and has a nice new modern draft house feel mixed with a good variety in the menu. Lots of selection of beers and a friendly staff. The bartender wasn't on point the other day  but the ahi snack most certainly was! Yum. We'll definately go back to check it out more.
Stefanie H.,Pflugerville  TX,0,4,,9/17/2011,4.0,I recently have just came across this lovely resturaunt.. They have so much to choose from.. their deep dish pizza is amazing... and their chocolate pizookie is delicious.. I am in love with their bar though.. they have many drinks to choose from... My favorite is called A Drink Like That.. but the Throwback cherry coke and the captains mug is very good as well.. Maybe this resturaunt is so delicious to me because by the time I am done waiting I am usually pretty buzzed and by that time I'm starving and everything would be delicious.. but the sober people in my group tell me the food is delicious anyways.. so.. maybe it's just extra delicious.. lol.. my husband also enjoyed the beer taster thing.. which is a pretty good deal for what you get with it...I definitely think this is a great place for the young adult crowd...
chuck f.,Austin  TX,1,7,,9/1/2011,1.0,"I went in after running errands in the neighborhood & couldn\'t have been more disappointed with the service. I sat at the bar which was half full  and the bartender that took my order interacted with me as little as possible. Other bartenders were friendly & the mac & cheese was fine. Details are pointless and perhaps I just got the one bad apple in the bunch  but the above description of ""Applebee\'s with a beer selection"" is spot on. Austin doesn\'t need any more franchise restaurants. I should have known better."
Jesus G.,Austin  TX,46,21,,11/1/2011,4.0,I came to try this place out and I'm a fan! Linda  our server was outsanding! My brother and I were surprised to see that the food looked just like the pictures on the menu and was really good too. Definitely coming back.
Chris T.,Austin  TX,2,20,,10/9/2011,3.0,Overall  my first time was out with some coworkers. The food in my opinion is not enough to justify the price tag. Perhaps if the food was a little bit larger in portions I could give this another star. Sorry :(
Candace S.,Austin  TX,0,11,,6/28/2013,4.0,I love this place. I can always expect good quality food and avoid excessive waits. The menu is very extensive and I haven't had anything that I wouldn't recommend. This is a favorite place to grab a casual dinner while we're out and about.
DAVID S.,Austin  TX,1,21,,8/8/2011,2.0,"Quite honestly the most disappointing pizza I\'ve EVER had.After having lived ( and eaten ) in Chicago for over 12 years  I tend not to expect true Chicago-style pizza from a restaurant not in Illinois  but this example of Chicago-style pizza fails even when compared to the selection in the freezer section of HEB.The crust was nice and thick at the edges but it was even thicker in the MIDDLE of the pizza. The amount of cheese on this one was so sparse  the I could see single strands of the mozzarella close to the center of the pie.I ordered a regular pizza with sausage  mushroom and onion. At first glance  I was embarrassed for BJs... the sausage was in pellet form ( ya you know like on the frozen pizza referenced above). There was very little sauce  I guess using chunks of tomatoes satisfies the ""red"" part of the pizza.OK  I was embarrassed and extremely disappointed in the pizza... But the very surprising thing was that 2-pages of their large menu was dedicated to promoting their outstanding pizza  with multiple topping combos  piping hot 4 cheese blend. I believe BJs would be better served by instead of paying their menu authors they consulted a cook from Pizzeria-UNO   Genos East or Lou Malnatis to give them a hint what Chicago-style pizza was like.yuck yuck yuck2 stars given for beer  but their in-house brews were more expensive than the commercial brands  which is a little disappointing  since that is a small incentive to try the home-brewed beerService is good  but extremely choreographed  as they ask if you if things are OK  bordering on pestering. But if you do ask for something extra  it takes longer than expected.Decent establishment  if you were in crowded city  but personal service  individual attention to fare ( including beer) goes a long way in establishing repeat customers.I will go back if I am thirsty  but food (obviously pizza) is underwhelming."
Duane M.,Austin  TX,7,6,1,1/4/2013,1.0,Ok. We've been here several times and the experience is usually good. However  tonight we went for dinner and I had one of the worst dining experiences ever. Horrible service compounded by an inadequate manager's response. I ended up spending two hours not getting a cup of soup and a salad after sending back pasta that was overcooked and chicken that was just downright cold to the touch. All I can say about that is thankfully I have leftovers at home. This was just awful!
Tipsy C.,Elgin  TX,0,42,,2/20/2013,5.0,The BEST deep dish pizza anywhere! It's my preferred 'go to' spot for pizza. A little pricey  but worth it for special occassions.
John M.,Austin  TX,0,27,,6/13/2013,1.0,"This review is regarding the Arbor Walk location only. I like BJ\'s food.. unfortunately  I hate their services at the Arbor Walk location.. I was there twice this week.. first time for dinner with family. We walked in at 5:30pm Sunday and the place was pretty empty.. but the host seems per-occupied and not very friendly. She explain her computer is down and she would need to manually assign seat.. Anyway.. after about 10 mins wait and 8 or 9 additional groups of people showed up at the restaurant.. they finally was able to seat us. The server is ok.. but everything takes forever.. we ended up spending 2 hours there for our dinner. I went there again today for lunch at 1pm... this time  I was immediately seated... but it took about 12 mins for my waitress to come to my table for the very first time (and she didn\'t even apologize for the delay).. I already have decided what to order while I wait  so I gave her my order.. another 10 mins goes by.. she still did not give me my Water I requested.. I gave up and left the restaurant and went to Tino\'s next door instead.As I was walking out  I told the host to cancel my order and explain what happen to her.. she just said ""ok""... WOW.. terrible customer service! Luckily we have so many great restaurant in the area!"
R A.,Austin  TX,0,40,,3/9/2013,5.0,BJ's was selected for a rehersal dinner by a dear friend. I had never been there previously as I travel OUS substantially. I was impressed with the wide variety on the menu. The service was excellent. Have been a repeat customer at this and the South Austin location. Strong performance every time!
Ericca L.,Pflugerville  TX,3,7,,12/21/2011,4.0,I just had an absolutely fantastic meal! The hostess seated me right away even though my friend hadn't arrived (what a nice change of pace from others places!)  and the servers were all super helpful and prompt. My friend and I had the avocado egg rolls (delish)  caesar salad/tomato soup for me and ahi tuna salad for him. Big rave and I'll definitely be going back! Oh and sangria was great.
John D.,Pflugerville  TX,0,50,6,10/31/2012,5.0,Ok  in my way of thinking its not if you screw something up  it's when. Then the real test of a business is what you do about it. I have eaten at this location frequently over the past few months and have had good food & service. The only time I had a complaint about the service (waiter was a ghost - didn't even come by to collect for the check after he dropped it off) the manager gave us half off & a $10 gift card (never saw that waiter again). Great pizzas  good beer( like microbreweries) and nice variety of menu items - keeps me going back for more.
John J.,Buda  TX,0,21,,10/4/2012,1.0,went for third try - first two times were bad - poor  slow service from kitchen and bar - a mess both times. Went last night and once again  terrible service. Meal was not good - ordered full rack of baby back ribs and they were the worst I have had - waiter asked why I did not eat them and I told him - so manager comes out and apologizes and says we will comp them - then bill comes and ribs are still on bill! They are so unorganized the manager couldn't even remember to take the charge off. IT is our last time - 3 tries is plenty
Colin N.,Hutto  TX,0,4,,2/16/2013,4.0,Prices seem a little steep  but food and beer are awesome! TVs on every wall are cool too.
Jason S.,Pflugerville  TX,0,15,,6/24/2011,1.0,"This is a big building with a beautiful design  but the food is not good and is seriously overpriced. 2 Fish tacos with cabbage and 5  count them 5  chips with a ramekin of salsa was over $11. ""That\'s fine""  you say  ""if the tacos are awesome"". They were fish sticks in a tortilla. Tasted like Mom bought some Gordon\'s Fishermen sticks from HEB and put them in a tort with some mayo. Blah! No thanks. Service is slow at best and managers are condescending. I have given this place two chances and both visits I left with a similar opinion."
Kassie M.,Austin  TX,1,9,,12/18/2012,2.0,I hate this place. The food is pretty good but the people who work here are utterly incompetent. I have never eaten here when the waitperson has not screwed up my order. They either take forever  bring the wrong thing  don't bring other things that you ordered  or they don't even enter in stuff that you ordered. So then you have to wait another 20 minutes while they cook your appetizer that was supposed to be out before the meal. Something is wrong with this place. The only reason I didn't give them NO starts was because I do kind of like the food. However  it's not worth the hell you have to go thru to get it. Go somewhere else with servers and hostesses that have actual brains in their heads.
El V.,Austin  TX,3,126,5,5/22/2012,4.0,New lunch specials finally lured us in the door. Staff was great and place was spotless. Don't see many places with a revolving door! I had the en-light-end menu item with a half flat bread pizza (California) and it came with a tiny little salad where dressing was not evenly coating all the pieces of lettuce  a very minor thing. I want to reiterate  the salad was just tiny  but the half sized order of pizza was filling enough for a small lady like me. Nice touch leaving the cucumber and tomato on the side of the salad instead of mixing them in like most places do. The flat bread pizza was AMAZING! Crust was awesomely crispy and the toppings were just divine. My date had the classic burger with thin fries and it was fantastic. I would give 5 stars except that the staff was really trying to upsell us on appetizers and deserts to the point of being sorta annoying. Also tried to clear my date's plate while we were still munching on the last of his fries. Don't try to hurry us out when business is slow  if there were people waiting for a table we would've hustled but the lunch rush was definitely over. On the flip side we were checked on frequently and our drinks were always full  so great service on that aspect. I suspect the upselling tactic is an agenda pushed by management. Maybe I'd order the chips and salsa if they were not $5. I mean seriously  five bucks for chips and salsa (which many places give out for free) when the new chicken fried steak is only $6.50 until 3pm? What non-sense. Could write an entire second review on the beers. If you like beer you will NOT be left wanting. We will be back here again for lunch for sure.
Chasity F.,Austin  TX,0,1,,6/18/2011,3.0,We went to BJ last night since it had just opened. My husband ordered potato skins they were okay but needed extra cheese and the skins were very small  but you get 10. I ordered a bbq mini pizza and it was real doughy. What I didnt like was I ordered a virgin strawberry splash because i cant drink  when the bill came out they charged 8.60 for my drink  (so regular price). I was not happy about this. My husband ordered a berry ale beer was okay and price was 6.00. But overall I would go back bit try other items and not order a virgin drink 
Stephen M.,Austin  TX,4,35,2,6/4/2012,1.0,At BJ's Brewhouse North at Arborwalk on Saturday 2nd of June  2012 after a graduation. We had a group of 16 people. We all arrived approx within 10min of each other. Table was set adequately. We ordered drinks for 4 people while we initially waited  took about 15 min. After all parties arrived we ordered food which took over a 45min hr to reach our table. I ordered Angel Hair pasta Toscana. It arrived as Spaghetti and they didn't tell me it was going to be substituted. I alerted the manager. Nice guy. 20 min later the waiter came to tell me that they were going to substitute the pasta. It tasted good but dish would have been better suited with Angel Hair. They comp-ted my entree and it was a pleasant surprise. I was hoping for some free sour dough bread or salsa n chips but I guess BJs doesn't wanna give out those types of fillers for free. The raspberry tea I ordered was awful. Returned it and ordered regular sweet tea. Refills took about 45min to an hour. One server for 16 people. Our server said he had back up and the girl helping him told us she was helping out but bailed once the rest of our party arrived. Our waiter was very nice and apologetic. He got a good tip. Not going back to BJs anytime soon. Maybe  if someone I don't like is paying  I'll go. Maybe.
Jake O.,Austin  TX,31,76,1,1/2/2012,3.0,Three cheers for the mini-bruschetta! It's delicious and just about the right size for 3 bucks  even though it probably cost 5 cents to put together. I have been to this location twice now and sat at the bar both times. If you want great service  grab a seat at the bar. This location has a great beer selection in addition to their homemade brews. Not sure why you would come here to drink Miller Lite or some other watery beer unless you like paying $10 for a sandwich. Or $20 for a large pizza. Look  the food is okay. Both times I have gone to this location I ordered the pizza. Both times the dough-to-topping ratio has been way off. All dough and very little topping. Definitely not worth the money I paid for it. But  I'm a sucker for big screens and beer so inevitably I give in and order food. The Jeremiah Red is delicious. The Grand Cru (they already ran out)  even better. My suggestion would be to go during Happy Hour (3-7 I think) where they offer half price mini pizzas  $2 off appetizers and $1 off their brews. Or  just go for the beer and grab a sandwich from Potbelly next door on your way home!
Michael V.,Elk Grove  CA,1,43,,5/2/2012,2.0,The only reason this review got two stars is that the food was semi-decent. The service was terrible. The server started to take people's plates away even before they had finished dinner. Then after asking us what we wanted for dessert  he dropped the check even before we got dessert. You lost a customer because of shoddy service.
Van D.,Round Rock  TX,2,4,,7/5/2012,3.0,"I came here July 3rd and it wasn\'t busy enough for there to be a waiting line  so that was great. I loved the lighting  atmosphere and company was pleasant so I was pretty open minded with the food. As a heath conscious eater  I\'m kinda wary of eating out because I\'m never sure of the options available. And paying $10 for a salad? No. Just no. I can make those salads at home. So with my eating habit  I was grateful to learn that BJ\'s have the ""Enlightened Entrees""  which are all under 575 calories. I chose the Creole Tilapia simply because I like fish and tomatoes. My two friends got the Hawaiian Mahi-Mahi and a shrimp pasta dish  the name of which I couldn\'t remember. The guy who\'s not driving got a Jeremiah Red. The food came out about 10 minutes later  which I think is decent. My dish was pretty decent. The fish is well-cooked  the sauce is good  the side salad is not bad. For those who don\'t eat too salty like me  know that the tapenade is salty because of the anchovies. On the health perspective  the dish is pretty balanced: a third each of grain  protein and vegetables. Overall  I would eat it again. My friends had no complaints about their dishes.The Jeremiah Red  I had a small sip of at the beginning of the meal  is good even though I don\'t drink beer in general. We ordered a triple chocolate pizookie because we heard it was good. Personally  I was way to rich for me so sharing was a good idea. While it was good and my friends did enjoy it to  we didn\'t finish it simply because it was so rich. I am glad to go back to my 72% dark chocolate and home made ice cream after that. One complaint  the waiter was terrible with refilling water  terrible enough that one of friend got a bit mad and gave only $1 tip. And I got thirsty enough that I asked to drink from my friend\'s cup. I will probably come back  although not anytime soon."
Dawn T.,Austin  TX,0,23,,7/27/2012,5.0,Great beers  great food  great staff  great atmosphere. If you want fun and laid back  head to the bar. If you're looking for a sit down dinner  soft lighting  and some quiet  the main dining area is for you. Everything we've tried has been delicious. Standouts have been the pizza  BBQ cobb salad  and fried artichokes. We look forward to going every chance we get.
Mme B.,Austin  TX,0,32,,5/20/2012,1.0,"Beer is good but way overpriced and wait staff was slow and unknowledgeable. She didn\'t even look us in the eye and seemed totally pre-occupied. She got two things wrong with our order and ""forgot"" to bring my husband\'s beer."
Derek J.,Pflugerville  TX,0,3,1,4/28/2012,2.0,"Two stars is giving them the bonus of a rounding up from one star and change. The place was packed at 7:00p on a Friday and good for them  making money is why you\'re in the business after all. Don\'t set your expectations too high  it\'s not an uppity type of place  just what we were looking to try. Yes  1st time at a BJ\'s  ever.Very sticky floor on the way over to the bar. Something must\'ve spilled and wasn\'t cleaned up well at all. Our drinks were served within reasonable wait. We started with the Ultimate Iced Teas and chose to finish with them even though they were just okay ($10/ea.). Service was a very solid average. Reading the menu I notice the ""deep dish"" pizza. and think that\'s a great starter piece. We ordered the small sized (size #2 of 4) Classic Combo and added onion/pepper. The pizza came in expected time  however  it was just warm and not hot. The dough was chewy and seamed under-cooked. Toppings we distributed in an acceptable amount. Note: nothing ""great"" happening here  never mind excellent. Next we ordered the calamari. There was a reasonable amount and it was very warm  still not hot. But the squid was horrible. The tentacles were very hard almost crunchy and the rings were beyond chewy. This dish was clearly cooked wrong and long. We are no strangers to some fried squid and this dish had to be worst I\'ve ever had. Because of this  we closed out. Five drinks  two app\'s  no dinner."
Penelope D.,Austin  TX,24,3,,11/11/2011,2.0,I used to love you... now  not so much. Was exited to be the one recommending BJ's to coworkers for lunch. Waited 1:20 minutes for our food today and the customer service was terrible. Pull it together.
Claudia D.,Austin  TX,0,42,,12/30/2011,3.0,My first visit for this place. The place gets a five out of five for looks. Beautiful atmosphere. Starts with nice spinny doors  continues with pretty lights. Lot's of photos on the walls  mainly black and white. Clean bathrooms  which were done in brown tile and steel. There was a good variety of dishes  with pizza  steak  wraps  burgers  salad  soup  and pasta. It would be a four stars  but there was only ONE vegan choice in the entire giant menu. This was the veggie burger  which was made with beans and quite tasty. There were four sodas that were home brewed  which were root beer  cream soda  orange cream  and black cherry. The root beer was average  and the cream soda was great. We came with a big party of 12 in the evening  and the food still came in decent time. Overall  nice place  and it's a good place  and I would take a group there.
Josh H.,Georgetown  TX,82,7,,8/11/2011,2.0,"I will try to keep this short and sweet.  I looked forward to eating here because I have friends that rave about it. My main complaint is the service. No complaints on the food besides it being cold. We had to ask our server to check on it and then she brought it right out. I am assuming it had been sitting there for awhile. The place was very busy which is good for them but our waitress was definitley trying to rush us out the door. She asked us during the middle of eating our meal if we would be ""sticking around for dessert"". So I asked her to check back when we had actually got close to finished eating. We asked for a couple other items like ranch dressing  drink refill but never got them. Don\'t go if you want to enjoy your time. Decent food though."
Beth A.,Pflugerville  TX,0,56,8,6/13/2011,4.0,I know  this a chain...but it is a chain with craft beers! And tasty ones at that. BF and I went last Saturday night after we realized this place had opened. We have been watching the progress of the building in anticipation of trying their brews. BF had been previously but not me. The parking lot was jammed and we thought we were going to be in for a long wait...but to our surprise and delight  we were seated immediately since we were a table of two. That said  the table was rather tiny  but we made do. Despite the crowded restaurant  service was on the ball. Server came to take drink orders and since I couldn't decide (I am not much of a beer drinker)  she offered to bring me a sample. Be aware  samples are only offered once in a 24 hour period. How they keep track of that...I did't ask. I ended up with a Brewhouse Blond and the BF had the Nit Wit. We both thought our selections were good  nearly top notch. The appetizer we ordered was the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps. These were very flavorful  shrimp were chargrilled. They laid on top of some veggies  mango salsa and a nice spicy/sweet sauce was provided for dipping. The miss with this appetizer is the lettuce used for the wraps. It is Boston lettuce  which is very tender (good)  but too lightweight (bad) to hold the filling. We ate these with a fork and knife.Our entrees were served promptly. I had a new dish on the menu  the Creole Tilapia. It is one of their enlightened entrees that is under 575 calories. It's served with rice pilaf...pretty standard...and some baby greens and veggies with a balsamic vinaigrette. The greens were completely limp...maybe due to a heatlamp? The Tilapia was covered with a nice tomato olive tapenade.Very tasty combo  just wish the lettuce would and have been crisp and chilled. BF had the Tuscan chicken limone which was served over angel hair pasta and included nice size pieces of artichoke  sundried tomato and steamed spinach. This was a huge portion and two crisp slices of garlic bread were served along side. He ate it all because it was so delish!Prices are very reasonable. Get over your prejudice for chains and try this place out..great for sports viewing with several large flat screens scattered throughout.
William D.,Austin  TX,0,22,,7/7/2011,3.0,Went here for lunch once.  The food was OK and the waiter was very engaging. However the service was somewhat slow . I find the giant room atmosphere somewhat of a put off. The place is full of TVs which is great for watching sports but terrible for having conversations.
C J.,Austin  TX,0,73,2,1/25/2012,3.0,"I\'ve dined at this place a few times now both at lunch and dinner. Food quality  in my opinion  ranges from ""ok"" to really good. My recent ahi tuna there was sub par both in flavor and perceived freshness  but my expectations weren\'t high. It\'s not like BJ\'s is a sushi place. I\'ve experienced a couple hiccups service-wise  but overall I\'m happy with the prompt and attentive staff there. One thing  however  that I find really annoying -- and I\'m sure it\'s the management that drives this -- is the ""script"" every server delivers at the onset with the message: SELL  SELL  SELL. Each visit is accompanied with the host seating you and saying  ""is this your first time to BJs?"" and regardless of your response  they\'ll bring up their ""handcrafted beers...blah  blah  blah."" Minutes or seconds later when your server arrives  it begins with ""Can I bring you one of our handcrafted beers?"" This is soon followed by their attempts to push variously named appetizers. Enough already! It\'s annoying enough to me to deter me from visiting very often despite its convenient location."
