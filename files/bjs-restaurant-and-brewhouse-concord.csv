Leeann P.,Vallejo  CA,247,104,658,11/27/2017,3.0,I used to love BJ's but i feel like the quality of the food here has gone down and extremely salty. I do appreciate their lunch menu on the weekdays though  that give a pretty good amount of food for the price. Their avocado rolls are always on hit! Even though I'm always tempted to get a different appetizer  the avocado egg rolls are always a go-to.As far as drinks  I know this is a brewery but I'm not so much of a beer person so haven't tried any of those yet. But i have tried the mixed drinks and they are just not good at all. They're definitely on the weaker side. I got the margarita that was flat and then got a Long Island to try to get a buzz  and nothing. It's like the drinks were virgin and had no alcohol in them. That was a waste of $15.Anyway  BJ's is definitely known for their pazookies and i love those!!!!!! Whatever cookie you order is good! Tip: order ice cream on the side. That way your cookie doesn't get hard too fast ;)
Bree D.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,44,28,12/3/2017,1.0,"Absolute worst experience I\'ve ever had. Went here on a Monday night  it was pretty slow. Our waitress showed up 12 minutes after being seated. When she finally showed up she said  ""Sorry  I completely forgot about you. They cut the floor tonight because we\'re short staffed"". I couldn\'t believe she told customers she forgot about them  horrible service. We ordered our drinks  appetizer and dinner at once. The drinks didn\'t come out until the appetizer...and the ahi tuna appetizer was frozen! I\'ve been to other BJs locations and had a great experience  but this was by far the worst."
Dana A.,El Sobrante  CA,4,33,7,11/24/2017,5.0,"I\'ve never had a problem with my food order. There\'s always something good to try. My kids love the selection here and the crayons and activity menus.Pizookies are a must and child sundaes are cheap!Also just had great service from our server Daniel  he tastefully dressed his uniform with a few cool Disney pins. He was very laid back and informative on the menu. He was able to check if I could order a dish that was once on the menu but that they no longer ""carry"". He was very polite and checked on our table frequently.Thanks Daniel!"
Gene B.,East Bay  CA,247,634,941,12/4/2017,3.0,Not quite sure why I liked BJ so much in the past. My feeling about this place did a complete 180. Something about the food that is not clicking with me. I just can't figure it out. I need to make another return and try again. One thing you can't go wrong with is the beer. That's the truth.
Colin C.,Las Vegas  NV,54,176,161,9/11/2017,4.0,I have a hard time understanding why all the BJ's get 2.5-3 stars. They're all well above average!I am a bodybuilder and a true foodie. After my competitions  I insist on going straight to BJ's because it's one stop shopping for me. I typically get a small pizza  ribs with double fries  and the Pizookie Trio. They're all very tasty. If I went to a pizza place  maybe the pizza would be better. If I went to a BBQ place  maybe the ribs would be better. But everything is very solid and I am someone who is somewhat critical of food. The service was also friendly and prompt. My wife and I we're waiting on four other friends so we sat in the bar area when we initially got there. It was a Saturday night so they were on about a 60 minute wait. While in the bar  Carlos waited on us. He was super nice and took really good care of us. We ordered soft drinks and chips and guacamole. The chips were good  the guacamole was OK. I added some salt and it made it three times better.Shortly there after  our friends arrived and we went and got seated where all six of us could comfortably sit. We ordered a bunch of entres and all kind of tried a little bit of each other's. The calamari was good  the bison burger was good. I thought my ribs were really good as always. The pizza was also very tasty per the usual. One thing that I did differently this time was that we as a table got the pizookie platter (I think it was called) which was absolutely amazing. After having dieted for 20 weeks  I felt like I could eat three of them. It is huge  though. 20 bites in and I feel like I'm going into a food coma and a sugar high. Anyways  you get the point. I'm a big fan of this place. We live in Vegas and have been to 2 locations here and have also been to locations in SoCal and now NorCal. If you haven't been  go! Check out my photos for more representation of the visit!
Eric T.,Antioch  CA,85,538,5965,11/7/2017,3.0,Not a bad hippy place  but this place can be busy. Food is a star above Outback and their cocktails are pretty good. The garlic lemon chicken wings were good flavor but was a bit too dry from being in the fryer too long.
Adrianna T.,Richmond  CA,203,64,190,8/18/2017,4.0,I usually go here on a fluke  either for happy hour or because I'm craving a pizookie. Their happy hour is from 3pm-7pm I believe. They have draft beers and wine for less that $10  I think it was about $3-$6 per beer or wine. I know they also have cocktails on the happy hour  but I have yet to try one of them just because I don't really like mixed drinks. As for their pizookie's... Orgasmic. I mean of course  you can make your own cookies and get some ice cream together. But it's not the same to me... The cookie is so moist and hot  it goes really well with the cold ice cream. They have oreo  chocolate chip  macadamian nut  red velvet flavors  etc... Red velvet is my favorite! So far  the customer service has been great. I haven't had any complaints! Maybe next time I'll have an appetite and order something off the menu for a change  other than having dessert and alcohol lol.
May F.,Antioch  CA,4,22,56,11/7/2017,4.0,This place is our go to when we're here around the area. We came here for a late lunch and just waited a few minutes to be seated.We ordered spaghetti from the lunch special and it's a good portion and price ($10.25). Also ordered the best beginnings appetizer($19.25) and Peruvian Quinoa with Shrimp($14.25) Good costumer service!!!
Steph C.,Castro Valley  CA,2,20,39,11/24/2017,5.0,Came here on Black Friday to take a load off our feet  and I was extremely excited that I was able to get the unlimited soup and salad lunch special. Usually I only come on the weekends and that special is only for weekdays. I always just continuously order the tomato mozzarella salad (one of my favs) and the chicken tortilla soup. What made the experience more awesome was our server Daniel  who was quick and attentive and checked in on us enough that we weren't just sitting around waiting to order more. He also was very patient with our table and the millions of questions we had for him.Some other good food options are the double bone in pork chop  the fried cheese curds (especially when they are hot) and the rib-eye steak holiday special. And of course  their famous pazookie!!!
Catherine R.,Lincoln  CA,0,10,,11/19/2017,1.0,Really disappointed by tonight's visit. 30 minute wait turned out to be 45+. Waitress took a very long time to come get orders. 5 out of 7 meals were incorrectly prepared. Medium burgers were very well done. Cheese missing. One plate was 8 minutes later than the others. I'm not a demanding diner. But we just paid way too much for sub-par service  mediocre food and ridiculously long wait times.
Kimberly C.,Scranton  PA,28,23,24,11/13/2017,2.0,"Nooooope. They were so crowded and busy  and they did not handle the service well. They\'re menu is HUGE which provides the danger of not being able to keep up with the selections of doing each dish really well. We had a salad and deep dish pizza - both were under average. The deep dish wasn\'t baked long enough so it was ""doughy"". Also  there were not enough televisions to be able to watch sporting events for the size of building and people inside. Needless to say  we won\'t be returning."
Ameera D.,San Francisco  CA,100,117,390,11/2/2017,5.0,Favorite dishes:Avocado Rolls White macadamia pizookieBBQ Chicken Pizza
Jonathan L.,Pleasant Hill  CA,13,87,1,11/2/2017,3.0,It was ok. I came here for lunch with a few people  and the place was pretty empty. The menu is literally 20 pages long. The pages even have numbers on them. To me  that is always a red flag  as a huge menu usually means a lot of stuff is premade and microwaved.Service was fine  it wasn't slow  though it was weird that we had to flag someone down for ketchup considering we had french fries. Shouldn't it come automatically with ketchup?I had the prime rib dip sandwich. It tasted ok  the meat was basically roast beef. The au jus provided was salty but not much flavor. It was a tad skimpy on the meat as about 1/4 of my sandwich didn't have any meat on it. The fries were really good- skinny  had a nice crisp to them. It was about $13-$14 so quite pricey. Other people in my party had spaghetti (didn't look appetizing at all) and tacos (looked pretty good). In the end  it wasn't bad though its a typical chain restaurant. Basically a higher end  more expensive Applebees.
Justin K.,Chinatown  San Francisco  CA,4,71,39,11/1/2017,4.0,Great food. Good atmosphere. Just one thing needs to be worked on. The Togo. There is never anyone to help when u just stand there waiting  and waiting.. BJS if you're reading this. You should have the to go person at the desk at all times
Alicia A.,El Sobrante  CA,16,11,1,11/4/2017,2.0,Don't sit at the bar!!!I've never had fruit flies rest on my check ... good beer but the bar is clearly not being cleaned properly
Renee F.,Sacramento  CA,35,145,137,8/14/2017,3.0,Typical chain restaurant atmosphere. This isn't the one I usually go to but I've been here 4 or 5 times. I've always had good service and even if a mistake is made it is quickly resolved. It's at the mall so it's usually packed  but in my experience the wait has never been more than 20 min. I recommend downloading the app and adding your name to the preferred waitlist or calling ahead to add your name  that helps a lot. The deep dish pizza is always good but now that I'm working to stay low carb these days I like the salmon  blackened. I don't like the broccoli here (this time around was my second time giving it a chance) but I love the asparagus. Next time around I'll be subbing double asparagus with my meal. I'm sure I'll be back. If you're meeting people on a weekend get there a little early to find a parking spot. Since Round One opened the area is more busy than it already was.
Kyshia M.,Oakland  CA,480,250,192,12/30/2016,5.0,How can you not like this place? Full bar  tons of menu options and if you have room for a dessert  you better order a pizookie. Which is a cookie in pie form with ice cream!!!! I absolutely love the brussels sprouts with sriracha sauce appetizer. Pizza is the primary thing I order from here and I've had no complaints. One of my fav's is the chicken alfredo pasta. AMAZING!!! As far as the pizookie  I get traditional chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream but if you're sharing  I recommend getting the 3 in 1. You can get 3 different cookie flavors for those who cannot decide on just one flavor. The casual atmosphere is great for all ages  but kids cannot sit at the bar area. Can get really crowded on the weekends as it is attached to Sun Valley Mall.
April M.,Albany  CA,38,26,1323,10/7/2017,4.0,The chocolate chip pizookie is great! So are the Nashville hot wings! The sriracha queso with chili is amazing! And our server Isaac O. was awesome!
Kristin V.,Hollywood  FL,56,61,52,6/12/2017,1.0,What a disaster!! Horrible service  horrible mgt  worst experience. Food is always good and comes out on time though  (must give them their credit in the back).We were given 3 diff servers since they couldn't get it together. In fact the entire patio also had 3 diff servers! Oh  also out of every Cabernet! Managements fault for not properly training! The servers/staff are a direct reflection of mgmt! Period. The hostess and 90% of servers need to be fired!Save your sanity and don't waster your time here. Will never come back -
Sabrina J.,Fairfield  CA,91,121,652,10/30/2016,3.0,BJ's usually leaves me disappointed  but today's visit was actually pretty good.Of course everyone and their mom was here watching the Raiders play  blah!  but luckily the wait was only 10-15 minutes. It took quite a while for anyone to greet us and asks for our drink orders  I'd say a good 5-10 minutes went by and in my opinion  that is way toooooo long to wait to be greeted. When Taylor finally came by we ordered a white peach margarita and berry burst cider  both were absolutely refreshing and DELICIOUS!My friend ordered the tacos  which she thought were pretty tasty and I chose the blackened salmon with veggies and mashed potatoes. I was so surprised with how flavorful the salmon was and it was perfectly cooked and flakey! There was a nice butter sauce on top which really just made it super bomb!We of course finished lunch off with a chocolate chip pazookie  which was BOMB! How the heck do they make them so darn good?!Our server Taylor must have been busy because she didn't check on us at all. Pretty much once the food arrived  she vanished. My friend and I were pretty busy chopping it up but it would have been nice if Taylor had checked in once or twice. Overall service was MEH  but the food was really good and of course I had great company!
Gus D.,Fairfield  CA,56,6,,11/17/2017,5.0,Let start by saying it was a real treat to have been treated like we VIP at BJS our waitress Taylor was so helpful.Manager on Duty was always near also came over to make sure that our needs were being taking care of making us feel special. Thank you everyone.
M K.,Baltimore  MD,0,11,11,11/19/2017,5.0,So sorry  but the food is too great to stop to take an image.Ladies and gentlemen if you haven't stumbled into this establishment as yet  you are not being as great as I know you can be. The food was delicious and the service was fast for a late night food run  less than 10 minuets for hot food. The cooks are in the kitchen hitting those pots and pans hard to satisfy my appetite and they didn't disappoint. Cheers!
JT H.,Indianapolis  IN,0,26,5,9/9/2017,4.0,Nice atmosphere. Not a long wait on a saturday night. Only 25 minutes. Food was good. Wife had a pizza and i had mahi tacos. Mahi tacos were very good and very well priced.Pizza was pretty good as well. A little over priced for the pizza.Had a flight of their beer (7.95)  decent beer. Pizakookie is amazing. Definitely get dessert here
Elijah B.,Martinez  CA,197,361,406,6/11/2017,3.0,This place is always a good place to go IF you have a small party (less than 5)  and the service is adequate enough to get you by. Service when it is busy  slow  or in between  is usually always  the same  which is odd to me. Doesn't matter what time of day or how busy it is  the service is usually the same  in terms of time. The food comes out a bit slow  but if you're at the open bar  it is a bit faster.I recommend the open bar do to the fact that you can get seated faster. The happy hours are clutch  and so are the BOGO meals (offered every so often).I do not mind coming here and always treated fairly well  but I do not get exceptional service of anything like that.
David F.,Concord  CA,52,369,1584,12/11/2016,3.0,"Stopped by recently on a late Friday afternoon after catching a movie in Pleasant Hill. I had been anxious to try the Concord BJ\'s clam chowder as the same dish in the San Rafael BJ\'s had been fantastic.When we got there we were seated immediately as there were plenty of open tables  more people being in the bar area. But the restaurant quickly filled up and by 6:15 it was packed and hopping. One thing we were surprised by was the lack of Holiday decorations  this being early December. A handful of poinsettias scattered around was the sole nod to the season.My order of the clam chowder in a sourdough bowl was as good as I remembered it. The chowder was excellent  and if possible  the bread was even better - freshly baked sourdough worthy of a meal unto itself! My wife had the Vegetarian Pita Tacos  and although the pita was excellent  the meal itself was too oniony.For dessert we decided to try their ""world-famous"" pizookie  which is a freshly baked cookie in a miniature round pizza tin  topped by ice cream and sauce. Not cheap at seven dollars  so we split the triple chocolate pizookie. We were somewhat disappointed by this world-famous dessert. The cookie was good  not great  and the chocolate ice cream was nothing special  tasting like grocery store ice cream. The sauce  from Ghirardelli chocolate  was the high point.While we were eating a couple of large groups were seated in our area  and our server was tasked with the table of 12. Alas  that was the last we saw of him  and after a long wait we finally flagged down someone to get the bill  and after another wait  finally snagged someone else to take our card. That was a little annoying  and made me realize I would never want to come here prior to a Friday night event where I had to be somewhere at a given time.Although my meal was excellent  five stars  my wife\'s meal  the dessert  and the long wait at the end knocks Concord BJ\'s down a couple stars unfortunately."
Sarah L.,Rodeo  CA,52,179,606,10/30/2016,3.0,Second time. Food is expensive and its an ok food. I think i like Lazy Dogg more. Service is also slow. Our server didn't check up in us  i had to ask another server. I like the Peach Margarita. Well mixed  really good. It didn't taste like cough syrup. Happy hour is expensive. You inly get $2 off of the shareable appetizers  which are ranging from $11 and above.Drinks are expensive too.
Curt L.,Martinez  CA,0,47,,11/16/2017,2.0,The food is good here but the service is poor. They are slow and not attentive. I have come here 2 separate times with 3 kids  and it just really bothers me when we finish our food and the waitress/waiter just disappear. When I finally get the check they sneak off and I can't find them to pay. Don't bother going to the front and asking for help  they'll tell you that you have to pay through your server  all the while my kids are getting restless and the server is still MIA. I almost walked out the second time....
Anthony W.,Benicia  CA,84,98,298,11/17/2016,3.0,Hmmmm...BJs eh...My girlfriend brought me lunch from here for take out. It wasn't bad! Had the BBQ bison burger. Normally I need to always have cheese on my burger but this was a tasty exception. I've had brunch here at the one in Sac and it was reallllllly good! I need try this place out more! I will be back!
Rebecca J.,Concord  CA,11,4,,11/13/2017,5.0,Service takes a long time  especially for delivery. But the food is good quality and well cooked.
Anabelle P.,Fairfield  CA,94,12,1,9/18/2017,5.0,Okay So let me preface this with: The food is good. About what you would expect at a brewhouse/pizza place. Similar atmosphere to the Cheesecake Factory with way better service.What sells me on this is the service though. We were a party of 6  and we got sat next to an older gentleman that elbowed my friend's son in the back of the head a few times. After asking him to stop  the guy gave us trouble.Management swoops in to the rescue and got us moved. He checked in on my friend and his son to make sure everything was okay.Overall- They saved what could have been a really bad night for my friend's son (12 years old and not really able to handle this 40-50 year old macho guy whacking him in the back of the head because he wanted to put his arm around someone..)10/10 would be back. Kids LOVED the appetizer mixed plate  portions were generous for everything  and the GM on that night was a total life saver :)
Sabrina K.,Concord  CA,72,1,,11/12/2017,5.0,Five Stars for the manager Pat. Our waiter was horrible. I asked for a manager and Pat apologized  came back multiple times to see if everything was going good and lowered our check. Too bad more of his staff can't follow in his footsteps. Our waiter never even apologized. Pat needs a raise and an award! -Sabrina & Randy
Mae M.,Richmond  CA,0,2,2,11/1/2017,5.0,Went to dinner with a friend  We were concerned about something when our order came up  and Douglas came to save the day. He made us leave satisfied and happy. We are definitely coming here on a regular
Misty B.,Martinez  CA,11,40,20,8/26/2017,3.0,I received a gift card card for this placeMy friend Raquel   my granddaughter and myself went for lunch. First we had to wait about 10 minutes which was odd since there was a ton of open tables.Second  we ordered an appetizer..which they served with our meal...not before Third..i ordered soup and salad...the soup tasted burnt and the salad was wiltedLast. It took almost 20 minutes to get.our waitstaffs attention tonget our billWould not go.back for the food
Stefarn C.,San Jose  CA,166,23,9,8/4/2017,1.0,On a time crunch and decided to come here real quick just to grab a sandwich or something. We were told our food shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes so we ordered. We literally waited an hour just for them to tell me  the pork isn't ready but you can wait more if you want......... why did I have to ask 3 times and wait an hour just to hear that..Aside from that  I tried to be understanding because I saw people coming in and out so I figured okay it's busy let it slide..but the more I observe and look around  the more it pisses me off. If food isn't ready  customers should be told and given a heads up. There are so many people working here like I swear I saw at least 7 servers just standing around talking walking back and forth..one of them was even playing around with the manager in the front. I work in a kitchen also so I understand timing. But when something isn't ready or we mess up an order or over cook our steaks  we tell the customers asap. Just bad impression of this particular spot..i was super hungry and rushing to get back to SJ for business matters and because of their unprofessionalism  we are late
Alycia S.,Martinez  CA,54,19,,10/22/2017,2.0,I wish our BJ's was good. Bc I do like the menu but service here is always slow and crappy hahaha so don't come hungry. It's so slow I think they forgot I ordered or I would almost want my money back. Yes that bad. So bad that I may never return to this BJ's again when there is a lazy dog close by or lucille's next door. Food is good and drinks are good but service and them coming to refill a water or anything is horrible. So I'm taking my money elsewhere which I wish I didn't have to do. Bc dang it I do like it and I'll miss the monkey bread pazzoki.
Alan P.,Lafayette  CA,0,135,,10/21/2017,4.0,There seared ahi tuna salad is heavenly. Try it. The waiter is a little green and rushed us to order. Other than that  a very pleasant experience.
Jennifer H.,Berkeley  CA,251,3,7,9/24/2017,1.0,Waited 20 minutes to get served water. Waiter who finally came wasn't even aware they were suppose to serve our table.
Tony A.,Concord  CA,40,11,14,8/17/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Again I don't know why this place is insisting to make people stop going there this is my 4th incident in same location today I go there with one of my friends and after waiting for 45 minutes till we called in they put us in the table and keep waiting for 28 minutes with no one come over to my table asking to take my order  even when I did ask for the manager it took 10 minutes from him to come over this is not the kind of service that we should receive in such restaurant don't know what's going on there and they need some attention from the corporate office P.S the manger said oh I'm sorry lol This is an update review 08/16/2017Again last night ordered 3 soups came 2 only and ordered 2 salad with shrimp it canes with chicken Ordered 2 ordered of fried calamari it canes test burned and so dry This is an update review 08/18/2017I got a courtesy call from Mr. Pat to solve the issue he is a really nice guy he is the General manager there and he is so nice and he did promise to fix this issues on the future thank you Mr. Pat for taking care of your customers
Juan G.,Richmond  CA,0,1,,10/25/2017,5.0,I want to start of by saying  the atmosphere as you walk into the restaurant Is so pleasant and full of energy that put me in a great mood i would like to thank starting for the hostess for being so friendly and giving us a seat right away. Our server was outstanding he didn't took long to take our order food came out fast. And he would always check up on us to make sure everything was good.and are drinks were always full. The manager Douglas was awesomee it was like having a second waiter he was on itt!!! And we will definitely recommend this restaurant to friends and family... Thank you to all the stafff
Victor Sbm O.,Pinole  CA,117,1,,10/25/2017,5.0,Walked in on a Wensday afternoon  the place seemed busy but my waiter Chris did an extraordinary job! I recommend asking for Chris! Very attentive  my water glass was never empty! The Manager Douglas also checked up on us and asked us how we were doing! He's the type of manager that you want and the type that great restaurants need  Amazing guy! Great job Chris and Douglas  definitely coming back!
Gabrielle D.,Pittsburg  CA,37,23,20,9/28/2017,4.0,Most favorite dish here- the jambalaya. Seriously I just love Cajun! It's really spicy though so I'd recommend asking the server for mild. Service is fast in the bar area however anywhere else can take almost forever. I'd never expect fast service though  because trust me  you won't find it here. Anyways  I love their burgers and fries as well. Pizookies and ice cream doughnuts are a must have.
Cait H.,San Lorenzo  CA,48,35,7,8/21/2017,3.0,There were definitely goods and bads. I'll start with what was good. The pazooki was to die for. The shrimp in the pasta was amazing but the sauce was a little rich. We ordered delivery and it took forever. When the food came  I was surprised at how little there was. We order in a lot and usually get a lot of food for way less price. This was expensive and not worth the $7 delivery charge. It's worth the price in store  but unless you're getting a lot of food  $7 delivery is high.
Danika H.,San Francisco  CA,291,69,42,5/14/2017,1.0,"BJ\'s isn\'t a fine dining destination. I get it. At the very least  I expect average food  average service  and a Pizookie. I\'ve never really had a bad experience at a BJ\'s  nor do I ever mind minimal service at fast casual spots.Today\'s dinner was a downer though. Got there around 7:30pm... our party had been seated already and already had appetizers. Everything was fine at that point. Our server took our orders right away and everything was noted around 7:45pm or so. Our server went on break and then Mother\'s Day went from pretty good (The Warriors won!) to something that free Pizzokies all around couldn\'t even fix.An hour later  around 9:00pm  our food started coming in 15 minute intervals. Awkward when you\'re waiting for everyone\'s food to get on the table. But wait  here\'s the kicker... my mom (whose ""Day"" it happens to be) got her food last. Yikes! Food was cold  food was messy. People who were seated after and around us were already done with their meals and paying their bills.To be honest  if they had at least explained that the kitchen was busy or if there was a miscommunication between our servers  we would\'ve been fine. 1 Star for a disappointing Mother\'s Day."
Michael M.,Pittsburg  CA,67,2,,10/15/2017,5.0,shout out to katie y'all better give my homegirl a raisethis is what mlk died for  a black man praising a white woman
Sira V.,Conroe  TX,12,87,300,5/6/2016,3.0,The good: they have awesome drinksThe bad: the food is only okayThe ugly: is another sports bar/restaurant  so it's always noisy.Their BJ's Irish Root Beer is the best! Many of their drinks are very good. The bartenders know their craft very well. The food is okay... mostly. Tonight I had their new Ham & Swiss melt. I figured they should have an easy time with that. Well  it was obviously difficult. The sandwich was really greasy and not very flavorful. If it weren't for the drinks this place would get only one star.
Laney M.,Alameda  CA,1,10,1,7/31/2017,4.0,Went here on a date last night.  It was a Sunday night  the wait for the two of us was approximately 13 minutes. It was bustling with activity  but still comfortable and fun. Lots of groups  families  and couples on dates  and they all seemed to be enjoying themselves. Our waitress was adorable  fast  and attentive  and laughed when we prodded her with our silly jokes  so she definitely had a good sense of humor. We started off with the basic appetizer sampler platter. After trying all of the options offered  I will definitely be getting either the Avocado Egg Rolls (fantastic dip)  or the Spinach & Artichoke Dip w Tortilla Chips next time. Mozzerella sticks were good enough to get an honorable appetizer mention. The boneless wings were fairly bland  and not very original (kind of reminded me of the grocery store microwavable variety)  so I don't recommend those.  As for my date  he ordered the Chicken Fried Steak Burger. His side choice was fries  and they give you a variety of options in the preparation - everything from an egg  to cheese  bacon  or even avocado / tomato. I had a couple bites and thought it was fantastic  but he only made it halfway through the burger before filling up. It really is A LOT of food  especially if you order the sampler first.   For myself  I ordered the House Top Sirloin  with sides of mashed potatoes  and the Mozzarella and Tomato Salad. Really cool artistic presentation of Fresh mozzarella and tomato wedges  came on a separate plate. The side salad could have very easily been its own meal if I had ordered it as a lunch by itself  very tasty because it was covered in basil  red onion  and Parmesan cheese drizzled with balsamic glaze that I wish I could get a bottle of at home to put on everything!  I ordered my Steak medium-rare  and they did it a little closer to medium  but it was still delicious and well seasoned enough that I did not need to order any sauces.  We had planned to get dessert  but we only made it halfway through our meals before we were full past our limits. We got most of our food boxed up to take home  so there was definitely no room for that dessert! I think this is a fantastic place to take a date  but if you have a large family and want to get stuffed to the gills with comfort food  this is probably the perfect place for you!
Suzette V.,Vallejo  CA,13,10,1,6/11/2017,3.0,Been here plenty of times  definitely good for groups except the wait time can be very long!Came here with a group of 12 on a Saturday night around 9pm  was seated within 30minutes (not bad!)Selection of food is predictable  I always get the Parmesan crusted chicken  which this time around you could tell it was just sitting there for a bit cuz the broccoli was over cooked and dried out. Service at the front was nice  but our waitress could definitely have a better attitude. Checked up on us a handful of times and we needed refills on drinks...Nonetheless would come back again.
Justin T.,Pleasant Hill  CA,62,2,9,7/19/2017,3.0,I'm going to start off by saying Jeanne G. is literally insane and should probably use Yelp to find some help with that anger. I had Jimmy as a server the other night  which I found he was very attentive and proactive - like asking for refills. Out of all the typically not so great experiences at these restaurants  Jimmy stood out as an outstanding server and made sure to go give us the best BJ's experience we've ever had. For the food  it's pretty eh. The spin-dip is a must though  but I just mainly go for the beer. Restaurant itself is decent too- shmedium noise level  somewhat dim lighting  uuge bar area with TV's  etc.
Shayna W.,Ukiah  CA,84,1,,10/2/2017,1.0,Literally was of the worse servers iv had in a long time. Karen  was our server tonight and she just gave off so much attitude. Our food came out fine  but we asked for ranch and blue cheese right when the food came out. It took her 20 mins to get us the dressings because she kept forgetting. I'd understand if it was busy  but it wasn't. She had maybe 3 tables in her section but the only thin. She was worried about was talking to her coworkers and the boys that worked there. When it came time to leave  she gave us the receipts (we had split 3 ways and she knew that from the beginning because she asked) and so once we told her what was wrong she took 10 mins to come back just to find out she messed up on them again. While telling her what was wrong she was giving us attitude like it was a hardship. Horrible service in dinning area. Sit at the bar  you get better service there!
Jeanne G.,Walnut Creek  CA,31,1,1,6/3/2017,1.0,"WORST SERVICE!! We were sat at 8:02 Started out with a sweet waitress then after ordering letting her know about a coupon we had (6 of us total) she brought out 5 drinks and then said o I knew I forgot one...then we order our appetizers which is what we had a coupon for she again brought us 5 plates we ordered our food before the apps came at this point we find out she is going to break....so Jimmy P takes over...we had to constantly ask for refills. My husband ordered the new SPECIAL prime rib it came with a salad the salad came and then 45 mins Jimmy walked by in which we asked where our food was and he straight up said ""o I don\'t know..."" We asked for him to check...out comes 3 plates of food and a pizza for 2 to split NO PLATES OR PIZZA STAND...again we are missing our 6th person stuff and my husband\'s prime rib looked as if it sat for 3 hours under the hot lamp...he said he would reorder it also pizza was dry and cold so but kids were hungry so we just had them eat it...asked for mgr jimmy said he was on the phone...out comes a Caesar salad no one ordered and we ask for 6th person plate....it finally comes 10 mins later...prime rib another 20 mins later its HALF THE SIZE OF THE FIRST ONE!!! Manager finally shows up...O and did I mention its hubs birthday...we show him the 2 prime ribs and tell him about the pizza he says o well i\'ll take care of those for you....yeah duhhh I\'m not paying for that crap! Then jimmy comes by and says mgr wants to give you free pizzokie...ok fine...meanwhile table behind us has another waiter going over their refire check and exclusions so we FINALLY get our check yes pizza off yes prime rib off however the free app not off I HAVE A COUPON FOR THAT! Ohhh and all the while jimmy has no idea what we are drinking so every time we ask for refills we have to tell him...then we ask where our waitress is....break was over 45 mins ago...you ready for this...When they come back from break they are assigned a new area....are you kidding me...we didnt leave till 10pm...Med prime ribMed burgerSoupPizza 2 shrimp tacosShould not take 2 HOURS TO MAKE AND EAT!!!we have only been 2x in the last year because service has been crappy and now we won\'t be back...its a shame cause their food is AMAZING!! Done I\'m just DONE!! O and the manager wasn\'t very sympathetic or friendly!!! I didnt want a free meal I wanted a nice meal...my hubby wanted prime rib...shame on us house of prime rib here we come!!"
Deshaunna P.,Rio Vista  CA,0,3,,7/25/2017,1.0,After being seated no one came to ask if we wanted water no waiter are waitress came over sat there 10 minutes and they were not crowed
Melanie A.,Vallejo  CA,105,7,5,8/18/2017,4.0,Cat was our waitress and she was great. Very attentive and enthusiastic. The wait for our food was a little long but our waters stayed full and our appetizer kept us happy. The pizza ended up coming out cold but one of their managers  Douglas  kindly took care of it for us and we appreciate the customer service.
Samantha Y.,San Francisco  CA,4,64,9,6/20/2017,1.0,We should have just gone to cheesecake! Yes it's hot yes you were busy but dang it my salad should not have taken an hour and when it came out it was lifeless! I eat a lot of salad and I kno when my salad has been sitting out for hella long! Everything was sour! The dressing was hella sour.....They super over dressed my salad and my lettuce was seriously dead like mush and gross and stuck together! I can tell when salad has been let out sitting to long with dressing and from the looks of it...it sat out at least 30 min before It came to my table. I was hungry and pissed and when I told my waitress she totally brushed it off and told me it was suppose to look like that! First of all no! Salad is not suppose to look like dog food second of all you should try to fix it and not give me attitude....such a waste of money! Next time I'm sticking to cheese cake factory!
Lena M.,Hercules  CA,72,140,420,12/2/2016,4.0,They have so many options in regards to food and drinks. So many faves. I love their pizzas  pizookies and beer. It can get pricey so if you are on a budget  take advantage of their happy hour. I haven't been disappointed with any of their food items. They offer sampler appetizers  beer and pizookie which is great if you are indecisive. They have many screens for watching sports and a large bar area. The bar area is open seating but where they serve happy hour. Location is great. Right next to the mall and round 1. Kid friendly which is a bonus. Parking can be difficult depending on the day/holiday. Staff was supper friendly although service gets a dip on busy days. Overall  I recommend this place for great eats and drinks.
April B.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,18,,11/12/2017,2.0,I first experienced this place about a month ago at about 3:00 on a weekday afternoon when not many people were there. I sat at the bar area for about 20 minutes  and no one ever took my order. Lots of servers standing around socializing  though. I asked to be re-seated in the main dining area where I was promptly served. The food was okay  so I decided to give it another chance. Fast forward to today  Sunday early afternoon with a 10-15 minute wait. I took my mother and her roommate. Both are in their 80's and live in an assisted living facility. One walks with a cane and the other with a walker. Both are obviously frail. No one seemed willing to give up their seats in the waiting area  so I asked the greeter if there was somewhere my mother and her friend could sit while we wait for our table. The greeter said she would get 2 chairs. I waited a few minutes and asked again  as it appeared she had forgotten. She had not forgotten and said she'd take care of it. She never did  and she never asked her co-workers for assistance. I approached another worker for assistance who told me that another man had approached the manager and was taking care of it. That other man was a customer who had watched the entire interaction. He carried the chairs over and seemed just as disgusted as I was. Meanwhile  the greeter that I initially approached remained oblivious. When we were finally called to be seated  they seated us in an area near the bar that required going up steps. No harm was intended  but I was irritated by this point  especially since there were lots of empty tables in the main dining area with no steps. We were re-seated  and the service was decent from that point on. For that reason  I am giving 2 stars instead of 1. This is a place that clearly caters to much younger  able-bodied people. What a sad statement about their service. I just can't see myself returning when their are other comparable restaurants nearby that demonstrate far greater sensitivity toward the elderly and disabled.
Kathy B.,Benicia  CA,212,126,376,4/17/2016,3.0,They have a variety of food  drinks  appetizers and plenty of TV! I would only rate this place a 3 because the food is just okay for me. Came here on a Saturday night and there was a long wait so we sat on the bar area instead and its first come first serve.Make sure to make reservations if you have a large group.
Michelle V.,Oakland  CA,8,156,4,3/26/2017,4.0,Surprisingly easy to get a well balanced vegan meal here  and the service was very friendly.I ordered vegan lentil soup  a salad with mushrooms and pepitas (sans cheese)  and a side of fries. It was all tasty. Definitely a good choice if you find yourself hungry at the mall.
Jess P.,Oakland  CA,0,50,1,3/11/2017,3.0,Healthy food options as compared to other chain restaurants. I like that they always have a cider available and it isn't Angry Orchard. But it's usually something that's still too sweet. Great beer selection. Main problem is that it's always WAY too crowded. Some of the food items obviously came out of a freezer bag and were reheated.
Scarlet R.,Daly City  CA,52,24,6,5/28/2017,2.0,"I went here last week with my fianc to watch half of the Warriors game. It wasn\'t that busy because it hasn\'t started yet  and we saw a table at the bar and sat down. After 20 minutes we were never approached and a few employees already made eye contact. Even if the servers had a different section  someone could have told us ""someone would be right with you."" I was a server too  I get it  but for that long to not even have menus on our table is not acceptable. I decided to get up and tell someone if we could at least have a menu. Hailey was so kind enough to apologize and help us right away. At the end of our meal she even talked to her manager about the whole situation and took off our appetizer on our tab. She handled it very professionally and five stars go to great service because of Hailey  but I only put two because of the disappointment of the restaurant. BJs can use some help cus this isn\'t the first time it has happened to us."
Amy S.,Concord  CA,867,1777,13340,2/10/2017,4.0,I used to enjoy going to BJ's in Southern CA with my sister when we were in college. I stop in at this Concord location from time to time but it's not nearly the same trying to eat the Pizookie (cookie) dessert without her.However  I had dinner here with my boyfriend last night. We started with crispy portobello mushroom strips. For dinner  I ordered a soup/salad (chicken tortilla/wedge) combo and he had jambalaya. He also ordered a wedge salad to start. I asked that our salads be brought out together  thinking perhaps mine would be served with my soup  as an entree. The appetizer came out and was delicious. Our server did an excellent job of keeping our drinks full and checking in on us. When we were almost done with the appetizer  my bf's jambalaya was brought out. No food for me  and no salads. We told the girl who brought his plate out not to worry about his salad at that point  since he already had his entree. However  a few minutes later my soup and salad  and his salad  were all brought out together. Even though we asked her not to bring his wedge  it remained on the bill at the end of the night. Kind of weird to serve a customer's salad after their entree and then still charge them for it after they say they don't want it anymore. We had other things to do though and really did enjoy our server's good service  so instead of complaining and wasting time  we just left. Honestly  it's funny but the only part of our meals I didn't really enjoy was the salad. The chicken tortilla soup was excellent  and jambalaya very good too  but the salads were absolutely drenched in dressing and mine had almost no tomatoes on it while his was covered in chopped tomatoes. A little more consistency and a little less dressing would be nice.
Michael B.,Galt  CA,9,6,,8/2/2017,1.0,"My party of five was promptly seated. That\'s the highlight of this visit. First off  it was about 100 degrees outside and the air conditioning wasn\'t working or it wasn\'t adequately set. It was uncomfortably warm inside. We sat at our table for 20 minutes and were never acknowledged by any of the staff. We asked an employee if she knew who our server was. She replied  ""Yes  I know who she is. If she\'s busy  I\'ll take care of you guys."" We waited 10 more minutes and still we were not helped at all. My party and I got up and walked across to Lucille\'s. This is twice in the last two weeks that I\'ve received horrible service here. What makes it worse is that there were plenty of employees standing around. It\'s a shame because the food is pretty good here."
Brandon M.,Moraga  CA,0,1,,2/11/2017,2.0,I've been in there 10 times in 2016. 2 out of 10 times they get things right. I usually order the Chipotle Salmon and usually what happens is its undercooked and with a different sauce than what what described. One time it was so bad it has has gotten me sick...The 2 times they got it right was very good however... service was lacking. There have been times where it took an hour to get seated (understandable) then 1:45hr to get our food because the server forgot about us and served the other tables.Also  never forget your wallet because the manager refused to let me look under the table even though I knew it was there. When the customers left  sure enough it was there with all my money stolen....Positive: wide variety of food and some good beer
J C.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,17,118,5/22/2017,4.0,I have been here many times ordering the same food but sometimes the food taste too salty. Its like hit and miss. But overall they are good place!
Kevin C.,Missoula  MT,0,15,,9/13/2017,1.0,Placed my order online they forgot to check the computer so here I sit waiting for food. It's okay though because everything I ordered is easy to make. If you miss someone's order maybe have a better way to deal with it than just saying that. If it was so easy why wasn't it done when I got here.
Brian P.,Concord  CA,72,7,4,9/16/2017,1.0,Thought we would have a nice lunch. Walked in and stood there for a few minutes while 5 employees stood at the hostess station and did not even great us. Walked right out! Fail!
Cheryl W.,San Ramon  CA,2,51,,8/6/2017,2.0,I have had brunch at BJ's in Sacramento and it is very good. However  I had brunch at their Concord location today and it was terrible. Even though I asked for my eggs to be scrambled medium  they were over cooked and did not taste good. My bacon tasted like cardboard  and my pancakes were just ok. My mimosa had mostly champagne and little orange juice. My server came to take my order after a group that was seated after me. I will not return to brunch at this BJ's any time soon!
Michelle Y.,Brentwood  CA,1,55,573,3/7/2017,3.0,"Today  went for a late lunch early dinner. My son was very tired and fussy. Actually tried something different  today  I got the lettuce wraps and the chicken pot stickers. They were both good! Got the Chicken Wings for my lunch tomorrow. My hubby got the Ribeye and mashed potatoes  and vegetables for his meal. My son got the corn dogs and French fries  but  was very tired & sleepy. So  after he ate his meal  he fell asleep on me  and that\'s why he didn\'t want to sit in the high chair  he already had his own agenda  he wanted to sleep on me  while we ate.The service was good  our Waitress  kept coming back to check on us  to see if we needed anything  and check with us  on our meals and drinks. We were full  but  got the pizookies for dessert - ""To go"". You can\'t come here without having the dessert. I got the Chocolate Chip with the French Vanilla Ice Cream and my hubby got the Triple Chocolate Chip and the Ghirardelli Chocolate Ice Cream. The waitress even added some ""Chocolate Chips"" to go with our pizookies!Too bad  they ran out of Peach Tea  maybe next time I will try it.Wanted to try the Fish and Chips. But . . .   DID NOT  want to be disappointed  just like yesterday  BUT  at a Total different restaurant."
Lia S.,Brentwood  CA,0,2,,9/9/2017,5.0,Daniel B gave the best service   very helpful did an outstanding job. Will always come back because of him . Sitting in his section is a definite must!
Steve B.,San Francisco Bay Area  CA,103,205,120,7/7/2016,1.0,"Super disappointed with the hostess. She took my name and said it would be a about 10-15 minute wait. After waiting about 10 minutes I started to notice that people that got there after us were being seated. I asked the same hostess about the status of our wait to which her answer was ""we already called you."" I told her that she did not call me since we were standing right by the hostess stand and we did not hear her call my name. I did hear her say to another host to ""call Steve"" but he never did (I thought there may have been another party named Steve). I told her that I heard her conversation with the other host and he never called my name. Her reply to me was ""we\'ll seat you as soon as possible."" I looked at the other host and said  I said you never called Steve. His response was we\'ll seat you as soon as possible. No apologies  no I\'m sorry or anything. They both acted as if they were dismissing my concern. We decided to stay because we were hungry. After being sat 5 minutes later we were seated. Unfortunately  either the server was having a bad day or they hostess and host told him about our interaction. Our server had a nonchalant attitude. He was slow and it was another 10-15 minutes before we finally got our food. Fortunately  he was phased out and sent home and we had a different server. Our new server was 100% better. He was friendly and be took care of us. We took care of him by ensuring he got to keep the tip (cash- which was well over 25% of the bill)  and he did not tip out the other server  hostess or hosts."
K M.,San Leandro  CA,12,51,16,10/12/2017,1.0,I came here for a bday dinner for my friend. Our server (blondish red hair  guy in his early 20s) was honestly the worst server I've had in a long time if not the worst ever. He didn't show up for a long time  we were never asked if we wanted drinks or appetizers to start with. We all ordered our food  he was super quiet and barely acknowledged us the whole time. Everyone received their food except me. We tried to flag him down the whole time but could never get him. I received my food 20 minutes after my friends received theirs. There was no explanation when I got my food and unfortunately the food wasn't even worth the wait. I got cold spaghetti with burnt meatballs and the plate looked dirty. I barely touched my food and was never offered a refill for my drink. When we asked for our bill and wanted it split he rolled his eyes and told us we should just Venmo each other. He did eventually split our bills. Honestly it was a terrible night with horrible service and bland food. I won't be coming back here and urge others to steer clear.
Supreet K.,Tracy  CA,7,6,5,8/24/2017,2.0,I want with my sister the other day for lunch. We sat outside however their service is slow. We waited so long just to get our appetizer. I like the food but not the service.
Natalia L.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,2,12,5/11/2017,5.0,Nice place to have a dinner. Delicious food and tasty beer. Blood orange IPA is my favorite. If you will be here  ask for Jarred! He is super nice  polite and intelligent  helps to choose from the menu  and even if you forget your dessert after a good dinner  he will remind you and offer to take it to go with a beautiful smile.
Jimmy P.,Pleasanton  CA,182,19,1,9/3/2017,5.0,Thanks for the customer service pat . Customer service is a big deal in this industry!
Ophir S.,San Luis Obispo  CA,0,1,,11/6/2017,1.0,My boyfriend and I normally love BJ's but unfortunately our experience yesterday was less than pleasant. We came here around 2:30 for a late lunch; we had calamari as an appetizer and I had the pork chop while he had the New Orleans jambalaya. While we were eating  I noticed my pork chop was slightly pink in the middle but didn't think anything of it at the time. My boyfriend and I both had some of it and we woke up in the middle of the night with food poisoning. We're both feeling miserable and now I have to miss my college classes today  not to mention I have a midterm tomorrow that I need to study for and the most movement I can endure is from the couch to the bathroom :/
Cristal V.,Alameda  CA,0,4,,9/1/2017,5.0,It's been a while since I've been to BJ's Restaurant in Concord. I came in on a Friday night and was helped by a wonderful waiter by the name of Daniel. He was extremely attentive and super helpful. My party and I were very pleased with our experience thanks to the chill environment and our wonderful waiter Daniel. We'll definitely be coming back again!
Marcia B.,San Francisco  CA,5,98,,4/1/2017,2.0,"I ordered salad for takeout and I\'m still sitting here waiting for it 20 mins later. I asked the front person what\'s the status and he just said ""20 mins"". I asked ""another 20 mins"". To which he said ""I don\'t know. I don\'t work the kitchen"". So fucking rude. WTF Is taking so long. It\'s only a salad. Especially since the place is more than 1/2 empty.The girl taking the order was super nice. Hence the 2 stars. That\'s it."
Pamela Marie B.,Hercules  CA,0,1,,11/1/2017,5.0,Douglas was so friendly and considerate with my visit today at this Bj's location. This location is one of the best!
Karen V.,Richmond  CA,10,18,17,6/20/2017,5.0,Been coming to this bjs for a about a year and I've never had a bad experience. Waiters re very attentive and kind. Love this place.
Max B.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,1,,8/15/2017,2.0,The Dennys down the street has better service. I went here three times in the last month. The first time our server barely talked to us and actually gave us plastic spoons for our pizzokies. The second time our server left part way through and we didn't really get a replacement server to finish our orders. The final time (tonight) I met my friends here and for the entire 20 minutes I was here no one talked to my table. I also asked a server if someone could come over to our table and she later walked by our table a few times so we eventually walked out.
Justin O.,Riverside  CA,93,8,5,12/30/2016,1.0,BRING YOUR TABLETS!! You'll at least have something to do for their slow services.Came with four friends and ordered 4 mini pizzokies. The restaurant was not busy. We waited an hour before our pizzokies came. It took about 15 minutes at another BJs. To add to our disappointment  the pizzokies that arrived were cold! We waited over an hour for cold-not warm- pizzokies. Furthermore  we had to wait over 30 minutes to have our waiter hand us our check because he was nowhere to be seen. We also were never given the chance to have our water cups refilled. Terrible service and the long wait is not worth the time for the poor food quality.
Iris T.,Antioch  CA,149,77,28,1/7/2017,3.0,I've been to this BJ's about 3 times now and I've gotten different experiences each time. But this most recent experience was not a great one. We got seated right away which was great  and the server came to our table right when we opened our menus. So we asked him to come back in a few minutes. Well it was extremely packed which I get  but it was about 20 minutes later until he was able to take our order. We saw him running around to different tables so obviously he was busy  but wow we hadn't even ordered food yet.We finally order  and it takes about 30 minutes to get our order to us and it was only 2 burgers and buffalo wings.. when I tried my wings I realized they sat at the window for a while because they were just lukewarm..I do not suggest going here while it's busy.
Monica T.,Martinez  CA,0,1,,8/3/2017,1.0,We probably should have gone somewhere else to eat. Really bad service  probably the worst I've ever had. I understand it was busy  but from the time we sat down and ordered it took 1 HOUR to get our food. When we did finally get it  our Mozzarella sticks were cold and tasteless and our wings were tasteless too. Also our server never came to refill our water  actually just never checked on us except to ask for dessert; which we declined because we didn't want to wait another hour  and to give us the check :/ I really wish it was just a bad day  but this will not be my first choice in restaurant.
Simr P.,Santa Clara  CA,0,1,,7/22/2017,5.0,I love BJs if there is more stars  then five I would give them. Everything if super nice. Thank you all staff of BJs to make our evening beautiful.
Willy M.,El Sobrante  CA,0,6,,3/5/2017,5.0,I've been to this BJ's twice now and it has quickly become my favorite restaurant because of the great service provided by Douglas the Manager and his team. The first time my family and I had dinner here a few weeks ago Douglas came by our table to check on our meal  which was fantastic! We went in again for dinner and he recognized us. He then came by our table to greet us and check in on our meal! Who does that?! If that doesn't make you feel at home  nothing will. Our server Gabrielle did a wonderful job taking care of us  she was extremely friendly and knowledgeable of the food on the menu. I will continue to come back!!The brisket BBQ burger is a MUST!
Andy B.,Vallejo  CA,20,224,54,4/25/2016,5.0,I had the Ham & Cheese melt and the twisted BLT salad. My mom had the Personal 1-topping Pizza...I read enjoyed my lunch and so did mom. The service wasn't awesome but it was Sunday lunch and they had just opened an hour before. I will come here again and try other things as time wears merrily forward...All I can say bad about it is that they apparently have a psychotic OCD janitor who buffs the floor to an insane surface daily. I would advise you wear non-slip soles if you dare to eat here. Seriously  wtf? I think the floors were cleaner than my tabletop. But the food was pretty dang delicious.
Giorgio T.,Concord  CA,0,28,1,3/25/2017,3.0,So I go to this place very often  and the food is HELLA GOOD!!! I usually get the avocado rolls as an appetizer because they are so damn amazing.. as for the entrees I think they all hit the spot quite well. Love the soup and salad combos  the beer selection is pretty nice and the fancy drinks are just ok. (Light on the alcohol)I give it three stars because the service is pretty bad. Yes  the people are nice... but that just doesn't do it for me. Seems like they have new servers every time I go  but thats fine. They always forget napkins/utensils  I have to ask twice for water  and its hard to catch a server to ask for little things. (Such as ranch or sauce etc).Overall i still go to this spot because it simply does the job and its pretty alive  just wish the little things were there at the beginning.
pam w.,Concord  CA,1,22,12,7/23/2016,2.0,Service was good. Beer selection is outstanding and served at the proper temperature for each variety. My issue is one star for food. I ordered the lunch salmon on quinoa without peppers. It has asparagus and mushrooms. OMG NOT A SINGLE ASPARAGUS TIP! All tough stalk end pieces. All of it. Ridiculous.Tried posting a photo...didn't post for some reason.
Heather C.,Concord  CA,0,1,,7/5/2017,5.0,Great service  a table for 2 on a Saturday night and got seated real fast.Our waiter Diana V. had the best service! Like she knew when we needed her lol. Wait time for our food  perfect.Our food and drinks  greatWill be going back real soon.
Fatima O.,San Francisco  CA,8,25,3,6/21/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Avoid this place unless you want crappy service and hair in your burger. Granted they took it off the tab and offered to make a new burger but I declined. I was about half way through my burger and a long stringy hair came out of the burger. Ruined my appetite. Not sure if the servers are new or they just don't care but they forgot drink orders and forgot to include an appetizer. The only thing they can get right is the beer  unless they're out which has happened before.
Andre L.,Fairfield  CA,373,105,563,8/12/2015,2.0,BJs is of course famous for its brewery and pizooki: as far as service goes  not that high up on the list. The calamari was very soggy and cold! My girlfriend ordered the Angel Hair Pasta and the pasta noodles were waaaaaay over cooked (very mushy) she had to tell the waiter she needed a different dish. They didn't put it on the tab at least.
My Two Cents C.,Los Angeles  CA,193,30,1,11/5/2016,2.0,"First and maybe last time. I had to call 3 times as the first 2 times I was on hold for over 5 minutes each. When you\'re on a silent hold  that is a long time for a customer. After finally getting through  I placed a curbside order as I was not ""public"" ready.1-I had to call and let them know I was there after waiting close to 10 minutes past my quoted time. He offered for me to come grab it  but that was not going to happen. 2-He brings our order and comes without change on him. One would think they could come prepared to make the transaction smooth and quick. 3-I was about to walk in when I realize 1 order is wrong  but he came out. Without an apology for the incorrect order  he goes back to fix it. 4-Now my ice cream is melted and one person will have to reheat their food. Food is ok  but reheating could have been the issue.Curbside is a joke and took 20-30 minutes. I choose curbside thinking it would be quick and I was being lazy. Won\'t make that mistake again."
Ray R.,Fairfield  CA,5,34,,2/11/2017,4.0,I have a problem focusing on the negative and really my negative could be your positive. Here's my experience....I went with my family for lunch along with my two little ones. It was at lunch time so a wait was to be expected. We seated ourselves at the only available booth in the bar area  unfortunately it hadn't been cleaned and there was no bus persons available to clean our table  apparently someone called in sick. after about 15 minutes of waiting we went to the host to see if a table was available. After being seated we experienced great service especially because children can be challenging. My only issue was the place wasn't really the best setting for small children  it has more of a sports bar feel. We enjoyed our meal and liked the fact that they have a great selection of beer. Because of its popularity  it is well worth the wait!
Stacey L.,El Sobrante  CA,0,4,14,3/5/2017,5.0,Douglas Mezquita GM was very nice. Service was great fast and friendly will be dinning here again with friends and family.
Nat B.,Concord  CA,196,51,3,10/27/2016,3.0,So BJ's food is nothing if not consistent. We usually don't come because the servers are all young and seem over worked.their call ahead is a joke and whats the worst part?? calling in a curbside pick up. i did this and still had to wait 40 min after i arrived to get my food! i could have walked in and ordered togo and still got home to feed HUNGRY kids before my order i made way in advance.
Paola E.,Concord  CA,5,1,,7/20/2017,5.0,I went to BJs with my family and had an overall good experience. Douglas the manager was so kind to us. Our food took a long time to come. We asked to speak to the manager and Douglas came he was very kind he apologized and got our food out right away. The food was delicious. We will definitely return the menu is very varied  the drinks very good  the atmosphere very good the manager's service excellent.
Shana E.,Marietta  GA,24,22,12,4/17/2017,2.0,Probably the most saturated grease I have ever had in lettuce wraps.  Too bad I was excited. Good drink.
Kimberly C.,El Sobrante  CA,374,43,2,5/7/2016,1.0,Ordered the Santa Fe Salad! It came to me in the most sloppiest form without the Avocado! The calamari was not crisp in fresh oil  also sloppy with pieces in the sauce. Feeling a little nausea from my not eaten meals! Had to order the chicken as a replacement and it was not good at all!  so I didn't eat it as well! Going home to get some real food. Wow! No cauliflower appetizers?Just went to the one in Sacramento whereas I had salad and cauliflower and the food quality and presentation was excellent!This BJs needs to take lessons from the Sacramento location!
Christina M.,Hercules  CA,72,395,318,10/26/2015,3.0,I do like this place for the variety of food they have here and even the low calorie options they carry. Sometimes the service is a hit or a miss here depending on where you sit and what time of the day you come in. I came here last Saturday and decided to sit in the booth area by the bar so that my boyfriend could watch all the games going on. The food was definitely fast and delicious but our server at the time was just whatever. I feel like she only came by to take our order and then drop our food off. She didn't bother to stop by to check up on us and a couple of times we actually had to wave her down so we can order more beer. Food is good with plenty to choose from.Service needs a lot of work.
Albina I.,West Hollywood  CA,6,15,7,12/16/2016,1.0,Ahi tuna was the worst I ever had.. unfortunatelyThey have tea  but they don't have sugar. Silverware was dirty..
Spencer M.,Vallejo  CA,0,9,,1/16/2017,1.0,"Always terrible  they have messed up our to go order EVERY SINGLE TIME. Tried to give them another chance today: Phone rings  press 1 for take out but always goes to front desk who then sounds confused that I am asking for take-out. I am told I am being transferred  the phone rings a few times and I get hung up on. I call back  woman says she\'s so sorry but she doesn\'t know where the take-out person is  she said she will go physically find them but  ""it might take a while.""Normally  I wouldn\'t mind but I am completely done with the crew at this BJ\'s. If you can\'t even find your take-out person  I have no doubt you\'re going to mess up the order once again.I have ordered the pulled pork sandwich several times and every time I get just bread and meat  no sauce or sides. I have tried to order a simple pepperoni and seasoned tomato pizza and have gotten everything from extreme pepperoni to chicken/artichoke. I\'ve also waited hours for a table and have had some of the worst waiters I\'ve ever come across here. Funny thing is management seems to care because the one or two times I or someone in my group has complained they pull out all the stops to make it right. Just get it right and there will be nothing to fix."
Joseph V.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,20,10,7/8/2017,3.0,Visited for dinner snack...waitess was very busy and when order came in...was not complete.Manager was nice enough to discount the meal 2.00Dissappointed on service and meal was not same had it been served correctly.Might give em another chance.TyJ
Kate G.,Pleasant Hill  CA,6,24,,9/2/2016,1.0,Do not come here if you are hungry. Do not come here if you want any sort of quality food. Do not come here if you expect any sort of care from the chefs preparing your meal.The sad fact is that they don't care about any of these things  but will take your time and money and leave you with un-edible  subpar food.We ordered a classic burger that was so black  it didn't even resemble meat of any kind. Nor did the lettuce they put on top that was so brown and wilted. House sirloin steak was literally about 2 1/2 inches in size and thought it must be either a joke or a child's portion. The asparagus that came with it was so overcooked  the poor stalks were limp and bent over. And don't even get me started on the chicken club sandwich  that was neither recognizable as chicken or a sandwich. Dry  stale  rubbery chicken  with none of the avocado or cheese it was promised  but did include more of the brown and wilted lettuce  because we just didn't get enough the first time on our burger.It is so completely disgraceful to treat food in this despicable manner  and these chefs should be ashamed of themselves. If I were BJ's management  I would take a serious look at these reviews  and do something about these incompetent chefs.Have ordered take-out from here for the very last time.
Jeannie T.,Oakland  CA,90,226,907,7/6/2015,3.0,I used to love to come to BJ's but my most recent experience here was lacking. The service was great and our server  MacKenzie  was extremely helpful  but the food didn't wow me like it usually does. I'm not much of a drinker period so I asked our server which one she recommended. She steered me towards the Tickle Me Pink which I ended up ordering  but once I tried it  I really did not like it. MacKenzie was a doll and offered to take it off the menu in exchange for a different drink. I took her offer and ordered BJ's berry burst cider  which tasted so much better. I'd definitely recommend it. It's light and sweet but decent enough for someone like me with a really low tolerance to drink. In terms of food  our group ordered the chicken wings in spicy and Parmesan  avocado egg rolls  fries  and the flatbread to share. I have nothing bad to say about the appetizers except that the avocado egg rolls are executed better at CPK and the Cheesecake Factory. For my entree  I ordered the Asian chicken salad. The salad looked really pretty and tasted good. I ate the whole thing  but then again  I really love salads. My boyfriend ordered the mahi mahi. The couscous was cooked well  but the fish was tough and overcooked. At first  the tomato sauce paired well with the fish and couscous but the more you ate it  the acidity from the tomatoes became too much and it started to taste like the acidic bile from when you throw up. Pretty gross. Also  my friends ordered the shrimp scampi and the bison burger. According to them  the shrimp scampi was too dry with very little sauce and the bison burger was overcooked. The only thing that tasted good was the pizza. Lastly  the pazookie is always good. We ordered the pazookie trio with chocolate chunk  white chocolate macadamia  and cookies n cream. All were yummy. No complaints there. Overall  the appetizers were better than the entrees.
David C.,Concord  CA,0,15,4,6/21/2017,1.0,When we checked in at the desk we were told we could sit immediately at a table or wait 15 minutes for a booth. We waited for the booth. When we were escorted to our booth there were five other vacant booths and five vacant tables (most of the tables and some of the booths had not been cleared of dishes and food yet). The booth we were brought to had food all over the floor which we did not want to step in while eating our meal. We showed it to person seating us and she said she would clean it up. After 5 minutes standing and waiting she showed up with a broom and dustpan and swept the floor. Then I showed her the table next to us had food and a rib bone on the floor - she shrugged her head and walked away without cleaning it up. Gee  I wonder what the kitchen looks like :(
Jairus M.,Daly City  CA,13,24,21,8/30/2016,1.0,1: Didn't give us utensils. 2: Forgot my daughters drink. 3: Waited a long time for my drink. Service was horrible. Our surrounding tables were also complaining. We tried to give this place another shot but was let down yet again. I do not think we'll be coming back here again.
Christine K.,El Sobrante  CA,146,54,49,3/6/2016,4.0,"I love coming to this BJ\'s. I come here whenever I can  and this has become my boyfriend and I\'s ""spot"" to go for a fun date night. I typically get the Parmesan crusted chicken  it\'s amazing. one of my favorite dishes and always made perfectly. I\'ve tried other dishes including the jambalaya  ziti  steak  and burgers. I\'ve honestly never been dissatisfied with this place. with my experience  I\'ve never had to wait a long time for food. the call in ahead 30 min in advanced option is actually pretty convenient. my boyfriend and I will shop in the mall  and call when we are almost ready. a major perk to the location is the mall  so if you have to wait for a table walking around the mall is a great time killer! although some other people have had bad experiences here  I\'m glad I never have. I\'m definitely a reoccurring customer and always enjoy my meal. one of the best things about BJ\'s is the pizzokies  I love the Oreo one! all in all I love this BJ\'s and will continue to go for many more years. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the concord area or shoppers at Sunvalley!"
Danielle C.,Long Beach  CA,186,4,5,12/17/2016,1.0,I normally love BJs which makes this so disappointing. We were seated and 45 minutes goes by and the waiter NEVER came to our table. We never even got water!! Meanwhile we had servers keep passing our table  making eye contact with us but not once even asking if everything was okay. We ended just leaving without even ordering.I don't ever want to go back to this location.
Christina B.,Oakland  CA,68,57,78,4/17/2016,3.0,Service was cool  menu selection is awesome. However our food selections were not the best...I ordered the Deep Dish Ravioli and it was hella dry (had to ask for more sauce). We liked the calamari. The Honey Sriracha Brussel sprouts were pretty yummie (they looked burnt  and the sauce was on the bottom  but I liked them). My friend ordered the Spicy Hawaiian deep dish pizza  it was also dry (she returned it). The Hickory Brisket Burger was bomb.com -we all should hace just ordered that. Lol The chicken Alfredo baked potato and tortilla soup looked really good and my friend enjoyed it. I would go back  but would definitely order something different.
Bianca B.,Belmont  CA,2,5,,5/7/2017,5.0,First time coming to this BJ's. Unfortunately all 3 of our orders were wrong. The waitress was very apologetic  the manager (Douglas) came to our table as well and apologized and offered free desert. We received our order at different times but the food was very delicious and we were under the impression that desert was going to be no charge  but once we received our bill all of our meals were free. Even though our order was messed up and we all ate at different times the staff handled the situation promptly and professional. Thanks again to Douglas  we'll definitely be coming back.
Viclaire S.,Fairfield  CA,212,339,1900,3/18/2016,3.0,Nothing truly special about this place. If you ever been to a bj's its exactly the same everywhere. Food ok  beer ok  service hit or miss. We frequent this Bjs as it is centralized from our work office. We typically host large work lunches here. Sometimes getting awesome service  most times receiving ok service. I will say for the last experience we had  I called in the same day for a party of 12 and Rebecca answered and accommodated us right at 12:30 pm. She did not hesitate and welcomed us.
Yee W.,San Francisco Bay Area  CA,21,186,151,1/21/2016,3.0,Came here for a late lunch. Took about 5 minutes to get seated. It was pretty quiet.Sat in a booth  it was very comfortable  but still had crumbs of food from previous guests. Our server wasn't that friendly. Didn't catch his name either.Ordered Mac & Cheese  French fries and Apple juice for our son. The Mac and cheese seemed old and the cheese wasn't cheesy  kinda dried.I had the root beer BBQ ribs with slaw  but replaced the slaw with mash potatoes instead. Both tasted great! The BBQ sauce was flavorful  I mixed my mash potatoes with it.We also ordered the three trio for dessert. It was really good too. Too bad the cookies were damnear stuck on the pan & wouldn't scoop out.
Emily T.,Concord  CA,88,1,,2/26/2017,2.0,Greeted and was sat quickly  to be left unnoticed at our table for roughly twenty minutes. No drinks  not even water. There was a group of servers in the corner by their staging area chatting about. There were only 5 tables being served  granted one was a large party  with us being sat DIRECTLY next to said party with 3 employees passing us each time they came to that table  menus closed waiting patiently. Michelle greated asking if we had been helped already and then took our entire order. Entrees came out a few minutes before salads. All the food was delicious and worth the wait. But the wait staff left us thinking take out may be the better option next time!
Rise S.,Concord  CA,0,3,3,8/25/2017,5.0,Daniel was a great waiter who outperformed all expectations in customer service with timeliness on food and drinks. Food and drinks was great. I'll definitely be going back! Thanks Daniel your the best!
Michael N.,San Pablo  CA,0,1,,8/15/2017,4.0,"Good food  brews and atmosphere. Can get crowded  but the bar is a good place to grab a seat and catch the game. Like the new ""healthy choice"" menu options. They make sticking to your diet  but still getting a tasty bite possible (although the beer eats up the calorie count)."
Milko Y.,San Mateo  CA,0,1,,8/22/2017,5.0,Really nice experience with the service and also the food was amazing and tasty   the manager Douglas was a really nice guy and friendly as well  I really enjoyed my lunch today with my friends
Dna M.,Walnut Creek  CA,111,14,1,8/12/2016,3.0,The reason I give this restaurant 3 stars is for the following reasons: - the food was good but nothing special - our server was very nice but trying way too hard for a large tip- my party of 7 rolled in at around 8 pm  we were told it would be a 35-40 min wait. We were waiting for an hour and a half- the AC was blasting  we were chilling while waiting for our food and throughout dinner. I took a look around and at other tables people were looking chilly as well- and last but not least  the dim lighting made it hard to read he menu  the mood they were trying to set was not accomplished. Let's just say  I wouldn't suggest this place if me and my friends were to go out; but it wasn't horrible.
Christina C.,Antioch  CA,1,10,2,10/16/2016,5.0,Last night I came to this location and was very disappointed at first because the 30 minutes turned into over one hour 20 minutes. I could've gone anywhere else. I want to thank the Manager for his concern and my server Jamez for making the experience very enjoyable after all! Jamez was awesome and very attentive! I will definitely be back to this location
stephanie w.,Oakland  CA,1,19,,4/17/2017,1.0,"Worst place ever to eat at. Waited for f***king 30min for my dish and it arrived. Then they\'re going to lie saying ""oh your dish is taking longer than expected"" when in reality  they forgot. And it\'s on a Monday evening where it\'s raining so they\'re not busy at all."
Shannon A.,Scottsdale  AZ,83,13,8,12/7/2016,2.0,We have been here two nights in a row (out of towners) and we have sat in the same section both nights and the wait staff was mediocre. For example  one of the guys we were with did not get the burger he ordered and everyone's beer glass ended up empty without asking if we wanted anything else. The food was decent  recommend the mahi tacos! And  of course  there is a good selection of beer.
Stephanie M.,Walnut Creek  CA,33,36,43,10/8/2016,1.0,Terrible service. We sat at the bar high top tables and waited for a few minutes for the waiter to set us up. Another 5-8 min later he took our drink and appetizer order. Another ten minutes goes by and a girl comes by to take our order to which we explained we ordered and she says sorry what did you order? So we told her. Shortly our drinks and appetizer comes out. We finish and sit. Our waiter still hasn't come by to check on us or take our lunch order. I see him walk by reach out to him and ask can we place our lunch order. His reply. YUPBy time we finish lunch and I have to catch him again to get the dang check it's been an hour and 40 minutes. Trust me it reflected in his tip.
Jessica M.,Richmond  CA,0,15,7,5/19/2017,1.0,Usually good but today the kitchen couldn't get it right. We're regulars but today I had to keep asking for extra this and extra that. Drinks were watered down. Salad had barely any dressing. Sriracha brussels sprouts had no sriracha sauce on it. Server was nice though but the kitchen was just very disappointing today. Maybe there's new chefs in the kitchen. Not sure. Not coming back for a while
Derek S.,Pittsburg  CA,0,2,,8/26/2017,5.0,My Wife & I were in last night for dinner & were seated right away but once we had our table we weren't acknowledged for 10 minutes by a waiter/waitress for drinks or anything. Then Daniel walked by & we let him know our situation he immediately without hesitation asked for drinks as well as what we're having for dinner even though it wasn't his section. He found us a waitress made sure our food came out on time & make our experience absolutely enjoyable.
Melissa T.,Contra Costa  CA,42,101,218,6/10/2016,3.0,So it's a Friday basically morning we arrive at 10:57 am and I was under the impression oh we have a few minutes til they open. Go inside with half of our party and realize the place is pretty empty so no biggie. We let the hostess know that we have a group of 13 coming from an 8th grade graduation. They let us know they're getting the table together. Gotcha. So I run down to forever 21 real quick while the tables getting set and the rest of our group arrives. And I spent a good 15-20 mins in the store. So my niece and I rush back to our group thinking man they've probably already ordered..right? Soooo not the case. After I settle I ask what you guys order. And I get a look back at me that made me realize something is not right. Come to find out no waiter have been introduced neither has anyone asked for a drink order from us or even come by to check on us. To fast forward after two personal face to face attempts and a phone call that was put on hold to figure out what's going on. Do we have a waiter ? Is there an issue? We get nothing in return. Not even a courteous do you need help from neighboring waiters. It truly felt they were all ignoring us because we were staring each and every waiter down. So I go to the bar and actually ask a bartender for water for our table. And she thought I asked for a water for myself. And I reiterated that we all needed water for the table because after 30 mins we still haven't had a server approach us. Once I sat  a waiter who apparently just so happen to be in that area where we were seated noticed how famished we were. Asked if we needed anything? And we told him actually can you wait on us as a joke. He said he actually was going to wait on us but was told not to someone else was going to. So he said forget it I'll do it. We all started clapping  thanks to Saul or Sal!! He was excellent and didn't get anything wrong. As he was taking our drink orders the lovely bartender I spoke with prior had waters for us. And asked have we been taken care of? By the time we got our drink orders in  groups that arrived after us already boxed up their food. Which made us very upset. Again never upset at Saul he was on point although the the orders took a minute but by this time the restaurant went from 5 groups of her than us to near full capacity. I can't say if I'll ever return to this location it was so exhausting. We had two kids with us under the age of 7 and they both became very uneasy and irritable because they were even thirsty or hungry or tired of waiting. And a pregnant woman too. It was exhausting for ALL of us. I hope they really do fix this issue. Don't wish this on anyone. Everything we got was a process. A loooooong process. Not the drinks tho just everything else. I hadn't leave early to get to work but before we had to wait more than 30 mins for the bill. Very exhausting  unnecessary and unprofessional.
Riana C.,San Francisco  CA,243,196,14,6/3/2016,5.0,By now  everyone knows what BJ's menu serves.This review is for Matthew D!!Matthew D provided my family with the best customer service that we've ever received from a BJ's!Came here late aaafter a Warriors Finals game and he still gave my large party tons of attentiveness and quality customer service. The food came out hot and everyone was pleased with their meal. Extra touch of quality customer service when Matthew brought out a complimentary single pizzookie for the high school graduate that we were celebrating!Thank you Matthew D!
Jenny F.,Concord  CA,1,17,2,3/22/2017,3.0,"My friends and I were excited to come and have dinner here after work but not long after walking in we were very disappointed in the way Tiffany handled her mistake. We were told to wait to be called but after 15 minutes we noticed that everyone who was before and after us all got seated (big and small parties) I went up and asked Tiffany. She didn\'t say anything and started to look for our sitting down receipt. I believe she didn\'t even print it out to begin with. All she said was ""I\'ll sit you guys right now"" sounding annoyed and didn\'t apologize. THANKFULLY our server Ashely M. was a joy! She was attentive  talkative and overall very friendly. The food was also delicious. Thank you Bjs for hiring workers like Ashley."
Jessica G.,Los Angeles  CA,118,5,4,5/1/2017,2.0,Went here on a saturday night had no wait ordered the pozookie and others ordered the grilled cheese food was good and worth the price but the service was awful. When we were clearly done the server never came and checked in on us and took 30 minutes to give us our check and walked past us 5 times and then completely different server gave us our check. the whole thing was just frustrating. food was average
starlight x.,Vallejo  CA,38,51,7,9/15/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,UPDATE - I just couldn't stay away and have visited 2-3 times after my last review. Service has been noticeably better and so far no issues  food continues to be amazing and the variety is unreal  always have a hard time deciding what I want here!I downloaded the app and get discounts  etc. Also took advantage of 3 Tuesdays in which they were giving away a free pizookie with every order of at least 10 bucks. Used curbside service mostly  paid on app and via paypal - the hungry  lazy person's dream!
Angelia C.,Vacaville  CA,247,19,3,11/15/2015,1.0,I went to BJ's last night with my family even though we already know how crappy it is due to past experiences.... And Because el tapatio closed at 9 and Lucille's has their own problems...Anyways we go in to get seated and of course there's like 15 empty tables but we have to wait to be seated...We get seated and we have a nice waitress who brings us our drinks and appetizer. The appetizer was calamari and it was okay  not exactly fresh.My parents ordered some beers and it took hella long to get them.We get our food and everything is okay until I try my Mac and cheese. I realize it had a weird taste of cheese.... Kind of like NACHO CHEESE. What the fuck??? I have noodles with fucking nacho cheese?? What the actual fuck man... If you look at the picture you can see the little spices that are usually seen in NACHO CHEESE  the CHEESE YOU EAT WITH NACHOS AND NOTHING ELSE. Also  I ordered their bacon Mac and cheese and had no bacon on my plate  so they brought me a cup of bacon... In which I found a hair!!The my parents ordered two more beers and it took over 30 minutes to receive them. And we also asked for ketchup 3 times and instead had to have my boy Friend look around and find a ketchup. Needless to say this place was not packed at all... And every other table was receiving the same service. Ridiculous. Do not eat here. The manger came up and offered to take the Mac and cheese off the check which is good... But looked at me dumb when I told him it was Nacho Cheese. Everyone at the table who tried it said it was nacho cheese... I'm so appalled because Mac and cheese is my favorite and I have never been disappointed by it :( until now.I've had a pleasant experience at the Brentwood location if you really need to eat at BJ's. They had real Mac and cheese there!
Colleen C.,Haymarket  VA,0,10,2,8/4/2017,2.0,Came here for lunch & our poor waitress  Patricia  was given no support ex... Appetizer put on table by supporting staff but given no silverware  lunch delivered by support staff but appetizer plates not cleared. Patricia could have had some help bc she was back & forth carrying drinks for 2 tables at a time etc...
Kristen S.,Inner Sunset  San Francisco  CA,6,7,,1/6/2017,1.0,"TERRIBLE. Don\'t waste your time or money here! Wait wasn\'t awful since we called ahead. But my god. The food was so terrible that we each took 2 bites and that was it. Our server wasn\'t the sharpest tool in the shed  being that she messed up my order and then after a long time of waiting  she stops by and goes ""you guys didn\'t order entries did you? Oh wait  you did. Let me check on that."" A few minutes later she comes out with food about the temperature food is and tastes when it\'s been sitting under a heat lamp for 20-25 minutes. As someone that\'s been in the industry for years  if you go to a table that asks for the check and refuses boxes with only a bite or 2 taken  maybe use common sense that something was wrong. Maybe inquire? What a waste of $40. The only good thing about this meal was the IPA on draft I got. How is this place busy? We should have gone to In N Out."
Kelly G.,Aurora  CO,119,389,7756,12/5/2014,2.0,This was my second visit for lunch in the last couple of months. They were located near JC Penney's at the Sun Valley Mall in Concord. The first time I went  I ordered the Prime Beef Dip and my mom ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad. My beef was in little pieces and it was fatty. My mom enjoyed her salad and ate the whole thing.On our second visit  we both ordered the Unlimited Soup and Salad. The Clam Chowder was good  but tasted like canned soup. We had to ask for an order of Garlic Bread to eat with the soup. They did not have dinner rolls or crackers  We ordered a total of 3 salads. A Caesar  Wedge  and Garden. All were basic.I ate for free on Veteran's Day showing my DD214. The deal was for any entree for $9.75 or less. Most of the entrees I wanted to order were in the $9.95 and $10.95 range.We probably won't be back.
Jason G.,Pasadena  CA,4417,2341,5393,9/23/2015,3.0,Pretty good food but the best attraction or draw for this chain restaurant is its hours as it is one of the few restaurants in the area that are open really late. They have a bar menu and specials not only during happy hours but also in the late evening. The food overall is average  at least the appetizers.
Wenzel L.,Concord  CA,0,5,5,9/17/2016,1.0,So me and my friend both get some drinks  the cream soda and the black cherry soda  both in mugs that were in a freezer. We down our first drinks  but when we get the second ones  we notice something wrong with ours. There were random pieces of somethings floating in the black cherry drink that were definitely not supposed to be there. It grossed both of us out  and there were even weird black/brown things on both the inside and outside of the mugs! On top of that  my friend also asked for a well done burger  but one side of the whole burger was pink  not even the center of the burger. Be wary of this BJ's.
Miss S. C.,Fairfield  CA,1,63,1,4/9/2017,2.0,Went in last week ordere the spaghetti and meatballs tasted like a microwave dish not what I expected my daughter got the kids meal pasta that came with bread and guy forget twice to bring it neve filled our drinks. I was ready to leave!
Mrs.Kifle S.,Pittsburg  CA,0,8,,4/9/2017,5.0,Great Service ! Our waiter was so nice we repeatedly asked him for 5 more minutes we kept talking and getting side tracked from deciding on the menu !!! The drinks were so good and so was the food I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs the portion was really big I brought it for lunch the next day !
Jay R.,San Francisco  CA,1,2,2,3/10/2017,5.0,Great service and great food! What else can you ask for? I've been to this BJs a few time now and the service is what keeps me coming back! The servers are super friendly  the management team is awesome and the food is delicious! On this occasion the manager on duty Douglas greeted us with a nice smile and warm welcome! Both he and the server suggested we try the NEW chocolate mint Pazzooki and boy was I glad he did!!! I was totally in Pazzooki heaven! I'll for sure be back again!Keep up the great job Douglas!
Tricia N.,Walnut Creek  CA,71,170,116,11/3/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,If I could give this place 0 stars I would.I have given BJ's consistent business since they've opened their doors. Despite some of the incompetent  rude  and annoying staff that they have. The food is OK  the customer service sucks  and the customer is rarely right here.It is Tuesday  November 3rd. I called in to reserve a table for 10 on Saturday  November 7th. The employee I spoke with  said her manager communicated that there are no tables available. I find it hard to believe  that this massive chain restaurant is unable to accommodate me. Besides the large parties they're currently accommodating  I'm assuming they must prepare for walk - ins.Unless they plan on turning people away? The last time I came here (about a week ago); I asked the hostess if we could sit at a table closer to the TV (MNF)? She said no  kept running back and forth for permission. She refused to sit us at the tables I requested. She kept mumbling reasons that made no sense. It was as though seating 2 people was the most complicated and difficult task.BJ's needs to pay their employees more OR hire more competent staff.I think I'm finished wasting my money here. Save yourself the trouble. DO NOT EAT HERE
Andy C.,Concord  CA,1,17,,8/2/2017,1.0,Waited over an hour to get our appetizers  no exaggeration. Very frustrating  didn't get any attention from the servers or anyone walking by. Food itself was meh. Appetizers were frozen and microwaved  don't recommend them. Really got off on the wrong foot  very bad impression  won't be coming back again.
A R.,Martinez  CA,0,3,6,8/2/2017,1.0,Worst experience today. Horrible service  sat down with a party of 5. No server approached or asked if we needed anything for 20 minutes. Finally we stopped a server who said they knew who our server was and if she was busy she would help. 10 minutes passed and still no service. We left and went to lucille's and the service is already at a 10. My suggestion is to potential customers to avoid BJ's and give that hard earned cash to any of the other local establishments and hopefully BJ's will fix its self or disappear.
Temmara S.,Oakland  CA,155,144,561,9/9/2015,1.0,"So I come here ALLLLL THE TIME  and have great service(5-star for Andre)  but let me tell you about my Labor Day experience. On Monday night it was my friends 21st birthday  and he absolutely loves BJs and would eat there everyday if he could. Anyways  as we seated ourselves at the bar  5 of us  we were asked what to drink  or should I say some of us were asked what we want to drink. Okay  whatever  no biggie. Then it took foreverrrrrr to find our waiter. Okay  finally she came  took our order and went on with her life again. Mind you  it is about 10pm and it was very slow. Then she comes later and asked if we need utensils.... what do you mean do we need utensils?!? I guess we\'re supposed to eat our soup and salad with our hands... Before out food came she brought us the dirties/wettest plates ever and only brought four. Seriously you would think she is blind by the fact that she didn\'t see the food crumbs and how greasy the plate were.Then  out comes the food  from a nice woman by the name of Marsha(i think) and she asks us if we need anything and made sure everything\'s ok  now the birthday boy says  ""why can\'t she be our waiter?"" As we were about to eat our food we realize... we DO NOT have utensils... They also forgot my soup and it was cold... Onto dinner  the food was absolutely great as always  then we realized our drinks have been empty for quite some time now. Eventually enough was enough  so my friend  having experience in serving customers decides to ask for a manager  and boy was he an unapologetic a**. He sarcastically said  ""is here anything else that I can get you that you didn\'t get?"" Not once an apology  I almost wanted to ask for his manager. I guess when the manager is more like your friend you get away with giving shitty service. Then TIFFANI(our waiter) walks by and ask another waiter  ""Do you need help?"" WTF  what do you mean do she need help? YOU NEED HELP. We need help. Okay  so to conclude my essay  the waiter  who finally came out from hiding asks the birthday boy would he like a pizookie....................and he says no!!! wtf  what do you mean no?!?! He loves pizookies  but that literally how shitty our server was  she sucked the enthusiasm out of us  he couldn\'t even find her to order his first legal drink! So as you may know  when the check comes  they are sooooo nice. And sadly  me being me  still persuaded my friends to give her a 15% percent tip....... What a good night... pause  NOT."
Gina B.,Pleasanton  CA,6,30,4,1/3/2017,4.0,They have a really big menu and lots of tasty ones. Our family goes here for a treat now and then  but most of the time you do have to wait at least a few minutes for a table. Weekdays we've had shorter wait (or no wait at all). We've tried all the types of food they offer  and they are consistently good. Their pizza reminds me of Pizzeria Uno  which I used to love  so that's a welcome treat I can indulge in now and then.
Tracy D.,Albany  CA,110,103,185,1/2/2017,3.0,Service was super slow and it wasn't that crowded. Our waitress was nice but don't understand the slowness of service. Had clam chowder  cesar salad  kid had grilled cheese. Jut ok. But the Pizzookie was amazing. I'd just come here for that.
Avery B.,Oakland  CA,6,3,,1/22/2017,1.0,No Stars! Went here today and ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken and had like 3 or 4 bites looked down and the chicken was BLOODY and red. I told the nice waiter and he said he would take it off the bill and take it off my bill!!' Honestly think they should have the whole damn meal free. That is NASTY and I could get sick but the waiter said they he told his manager and he can take it off the bill!!! Really just the meal that was not cooked chicken!!!!! Please make sure your food is cooked before eating!!!
Rachel Ann C.,Irvine  CA,416,303,1458,8/15/2014,3.0,I've been here several times over the years and my experience has always been inconsistent. It's mostly about the customer service. Employees will forget about my table sometimes  neglect to come back or take my order  forget to get my beer. Other times  they are extremely friendly and courteous and are willing to serve you. I've had a waitress one time who seemed like she was flirting with a customer in the bar. Same goes for another guy serving a table of girls. Service aside  the food is standard BJ's.Their appetizers and entrees tend to run HUGE. Just look at the calorie count--it's definitely something NOT for one person. I tend to split the bigger entrees and pastas with another person as it's enough for two. The appetizers are DEFINITELY shareable between 3+ people. If you're looking for a more personalized one-person or small group appetizer  go for the Snacks and Small Shares portion of the menu. You'll definitely save your appetite and money. Most of their foods are huge  greasy and packed with flavor which makes you fill up. Not entirely healthy but... It is BJ's.Since it is a brewhouse  they have such a great selection of beers. For a light beer-cider blend  I love their Black Velvet beer. It's a nice brew of their BJ's Porter (coffee-chocolate-malt roast) and Cider blend. It's sweet but balanced well with their dark brew. I've heard of their other beers as well and people tend to generally enjoy them--just find what suits you!Overall  mediocre experiences altogether. Pizookies are usually a guilty pleasure and you can never go wrong if you're ready to indulge in those. A restaurant and brewhouse that packs on the flavors and sizes in their foods  good happy hour with a great beer selection  and mediocre service. Classic BJ's chain for ya!
Car C.,Pleasanton  CA,0,17,1,9/17/2016,1.0,Even with different location... The service sucks 2x in Dublin location and now here in Concord. Today  Simple orders of soup and appetizer took 45 min. It was not even busy. We got our appetizer n that was it. Ask for the manager to comp our appetizer -- Pat was apologetic and accommodating but too late my 85 yrs old dad wanted and ready to go. We headed to Lucille across the way. Maybe the CEO need to do an 'Undercover Boss' to restructure the weak links of customer service of this business. They have enough staff hanging around. Too bad they are not thoroughly trained. Three times too many to give it another chance.
Norm D.,San Francisco  CA,54,130,415,6/8/2016,3.0,It's BJ's for goodness sake. Everyone knows what you will get when you come in here. I came in here for a late lunch and a beer  and I knew exactly what I was going to get in food  service  and quality of beer. I ordered for lunch the Black and Bleu-House Burger with chipotle  bleu cheese crumbles  Applewood smoked bacon  tomatoes and roasted garlic aioli. I also asked for sliced red onions. Medium rare burger of course. I also ordered the HopStorm IPA as well. Beer was good (I had two in fact)  and the burger wasn't bad. Service was acceptable and friendly as well (it did take a while to get water). BJ's is the same everywhere  so it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.
Jessica B.,Pacheco  CA,41,9,1,7/27/2017,2.0,Great food but service was horrible. Didn't get greeted or asked for drinks for 10 minutes after we were seated. Didn't have the same server  different people each time throughout our whole meal.
Drew B.,Walnut Creek  CA,1,51,10,2/19/2017,5.0,My wife  mom and myself came here last night for dinner. We got 2 flights  2 pints and some awesome grub. I ordered the hickory brisket & bacon burger. It was soooo good. We had a good time and even helped sing happy birthday to the table across from us. Great service and our server seemed knowledgeable about brews.
Lauren C.,Vacaville  CA,369,70,844,11/1/2016,2.0,Late post. We came in a slow day (Wednesday) no problem getting seated right away for a party of 3 but was disappointed that when I checked in at the hospitality desk area they didn't ask if I was a bjs premiere rewards member or not. Therefore my mobile check didn't show up on my BJs app. Lately I've been paying via the app so I won't have the hassle of waiting for a long time to get my check by the server. We had two servers this day. I'm assuming one is a new employee and the other one is kinda of shadowing and guiding. It was confusing because they would both talk and we don't really know who we should talk to. As far as food it arrived very late considering there were hardly anyone at the time. We ordered our typical dishes but was underwhelmed with quality and taste. The server didn't come up to ask to refill my drink. Been drinking the heck out of my soda because the food was taking forever to arrive. This time around our food and service experience was huge MISS!
Mari A.,San Francisco  CA,0,3,,3/12/2017,5.0,Doug  the manager was very helpful since we first walked in. I saw him checking in with every table making sure everyone was good  great hospitality. My husband Salmon dish was dry and He called Doug and right away he fixed the problem. Very impressed!!!! We will be coming back more
Caroleann B.,Oceanside  CA,457,576,3885,9/3/2015,4.0,I was visiting in the area and my cousin suggested to meet here for a bite and drinks. We did come here at dinner time and on a Friday  so needless to say it was quite busy.The restaurant is located in the mall parking lot. Our server took a few minutes to get to us  but we were able to place our order. He returned with another server with our drinks and informed he was going on break and she will take care of us. Our food was brought to us after waiting a bit. Our server did check on us but it seemed like a long wait. And of course when you need something at the table they are never around  but finally got we needed. The food was good  fresh and hot so no complaints there.It being Friday and dinner time  it took awhile to get the bill. If in the area  despite the wait  I would return to have a bite and drinks.
Bong T.,Concord  CA,108,36,378,6/3/2016,5.0,"""There\'s no other way I would truly enjoy having a sumptuous dinner at BJ\'s Restaurant and Brewhouse in Concord rather than with our home town guests  \'COREY NAKAMURA\' and \'TYLER YAMAGUCHI\' from Hawaii who are \'Star Athletes\' of the WC Crawdads Baseball Summer League while joyfully watching the Warriors badly trounced the Cavaliers  104-89 on Game 1 of the NBA Finals. Their food was unbelievably delish! We had their yummy Combo Pairing Meals of Steak and Shrimp with creamy sauce. We Love their signature \'PIZOOKIE\' dessert of macadamia pudding top with creamy vanilla ice cream. A \'BIG SHOUT OUT\' to our amazing server  \'CORREEN\' for her \'phenomenal\' and \'hilarious\' service. ""THANK YOU"" \'C\'! Couldn\'t wait to be back soon! It\'s All \'Worth\' It Dining at BJ\'s People! #Warriors #DubNation #StrengthInNumbers #NBAFinals2016 #ABC7Now #BJRestaurant @julianedward_"
Ashley S.,Irvine  CA,222,33,,1/12/2017,4.0,Usually don't go to many chain restaurants these days but you can never wrong with BJs because of their extensive menu. BJs Favorite pizza  BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad and the Asian Chopped Salad are my go-to's!
Bobbi P.,Emeryville  CA,2,2,1,1/7/2017,5.0,5 stars for our server Nina with the bandana... It was our first time at BJ's and she was extremely helpful & friendly.. Amazing service  we will be coming back !
Ronald J.,Concord  CA,0,15,,7/22/2017,5.0,Our service last night was rather incredible. Our server  Sam  was upbeat and bubbly and even in the dead of night  as the clock was striking 12  she was still very attentive of our table and our needs; consistently topping off waters and taking orders with great speed. She also recommended the cherry chipotle salmon  which was amazing.
Myra P.,Pittsburg  CA,1,3,2,5/29/2017,2.0,Everytime I order something it's salty. I think the chef just pours salt on my order . I ordered chicken lettuce wrap. Omg I was so excited to eat it and it was salty. My husband ordered jambalaya it was also salty . The fries were serve hard and old . What a waste of money . So disappointed !!!!
Jim R.,Antioch  CA,0,1,,7/21/2017,1.0,The service of this restaurant is second to none  for all the wrong reasons  the staff not all just blatant ignore even the most basic of request it's not too much to ask to have utensils at the table but seems like here it is  our waiter was fine and he was I believe genuine in his embarrassment of co workers lack of professionalism and furthermore even more upset that his manager at his request and ours would. Not address the lack of basic service  so enjoy Bjs but realize no service included
Jacqueline J.,San Francisco  CA,173,117,553,3/26/2016,3.0,Food is alright here.. Kinda blan honestly. I mostly order salads at this place or their deep dish pizza which is probably the best thing on their menu. Customer service is is slow at times. If i had to choose between this or Cheesecake Factory because they are kinda similar in menu options  it def be Cheesecake Factory. bjs needs more variety in their menu! And hire more waiters/waitresses!
Travis W.,Vallejo  CA,109,77,23,4/22/2016,3.0,Food is good  drinks are better.The drink selection is very nice  I love trying new beers  went with the black velvet beer  VERY GOOD  poured correctly. The steak was good not great but good  I'm used to steakhouses so that might be it.Go here with the thought of drinking  they even have a pairing chart to help those who don't know how to pair drinks with your food  I myself didn't really know and it was very interesting taking a look at it.Service was okay  they don't seem to be very much into it  another thing I didn't like too much was at the booths it's hard to watch what's on TV  either you have to look straight up or look across the place to see.ONE THING YOU HAVE TO DO IS TRY THE PIZOOKIE!!! Pizza and cookie  not literally but just imagine a huge cookie with ice cream and whipped cream. I'm not big on desserts but love this.
Monica J.,San Pablo  CA,1,3,1,2/20/2017,2.0,"After shopping at the mall for a couple of hours  my family and I worked up an appetite and decided to have BJ\'s for dinner. It was a Sunday evening so we imagined it would be somewhat busy but not 30 minutes wait-time busy (there were plenty of tables open from what we could see.) Once we were finally seated  it took about 5 minutes to actually get a server come to our table. When he came back to our table with our drinks  he placed the drink on the uneven table and accidentally spilled my fathers drink and it fell all over his lap and phone. Luckily no damage  just a bit of stickiness  but we understand accidents happen. The bus boy was a great deal of help!After the spill ordeal  we were ready to order. The server had pens and notepads in his pockets but as we were giving him our orders  he never wrote anything down; pretty weird especially since it was a busy night and he was serving other tables but I just relied on his good memory I guess. My parents ordered soup and salad combos so their meals came out in a fairly average wait time. As my parents are getting through their meals  our server finally came with my plate but instead of the sirloin steak  he brought me a huge rib-eye steak. When I told him that\'s not what I ordered  he seemed confused and said that he could\'ve sworn I said rib-eye and even look at his ""empty"" notepad. So as my parents finish their food  I finally received my meal but at that point it was already late and I had to rush through it; not even able to enjoy it.The only good thing about this experience was that I had a $5 off $25 coupon. I think it\'s better to play it safe and take the extra second to write down orders and that way you won\'t waste food/time and get things wrong in the first place."
Gus D.,Fairfield  CA,17,6,2,1/4/2017,5.0,Let start by saying it was a real treat to have been treated like we VIP at BJS our waitress Alicia was so helpful to help us and the 20 other tables at the Bar we were just stopping on my best B-Day. And we're treat with gloves must stop by and will return visit is coming David the Manager on Duty was always near by andatentive to our needs. Gus and Jim cord.
Amy Y.,Berkeley  CA,1306,657,1960,10/21/2015,3.0,"I came here with some co-workers post work  and the food is great. The food is on the pricier side  but everything tasted good. The potsticker as my co worker says ""tastes like trader joes"" but we loved the wings. Stay away from the chicken potstickers. Definitely not worth it! The buffalo wing HITS THE SPOT!! The ranch sauce with it is amazing!! CHICKEN WINGS $10.50Drizzled with hot and spicy buffalo and ranch. Served with celery sticks  extra sauce and ranch for dipping. Or choose one of our signature sauces from the selections below. Signature sauces: Brewhouse BBQ  maui sweet teriyaki glaze  garlic parmesan  extra hot buffalo. It\'s perfect! The CRISPY CALAMARI $10.95 With marinara and lemon garlic aioli was okay. We also got some drinks and I ordered Very Berry Margarita with: Patrn Silver Tequila | Cointreau Orange Liqueur | Monin Blackberry | Strawberry Pure | BJ\'s Fresh Sweet & Sour | Fresh Lime | On the Rocks. It was basically tequila. I didn\'t like it too much. We sat outside so it was a great area  and we got a pretty big table. The server was overwhelmed with our order so she forgot our drinks multiple times. Someone also refilled my alcohol with water.. for some weird reason.. It\'s a good thing we went and got free food  otherwise I would not come here."
Liz B.,Concord  CA,0,2,,6/21/2017,1.0,This place is a joke. I was waiting for 20 minutes in the free sitting area. I got there at 11:36pm. The servers kept passing by not paying attention to our group of 3. We waited for them but they came around 11:50 pm telling us they already closed that area. They literally payed attention to us at the moment they were going to close but kept looking straight at us before without giving us menus or anything.
Teasha S.,Denver  CO,230,58,1,3/3/2016,4.0,I moved to the East Bay last year from Reno and I ALWAYS went to BJ's up there  but the negative reviews for the BJ's around here have caused me to stay away until recently... I'm glad I gave it a shot  because they did just fine and I missed their pizzas  dammit.We came here on a weekday evening this week and I believe our server was named Emily. She was attentive  quick  and efficient  and even made sure to put the half of the pizza with mushrooms facing my boyfriend (lol) since I ordered my half without. She seemed genuinely happy to help and it made me regret not trying the local BJ's here sooner. Give them a shot! Just remember that lunchtimes are busy  as are weekends  and the service might be slower at that time. Also  I think it's really weird that multiple Yelpers are complaining about Pizookies. I could not care less if a pizookie is kind of stuck to the cookie sheet. I would annihilate that thing anyway. Pizookies are fantastic.
Christy A.,Concord  CA,0,5,,2/5/2017,1.0,"Went to lunch here on Super Bowl Sunday (2/5/2017) and was hoping to have a good time. Not only did the service stink....I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and needed a take home box. I did forget it and left it at my table. Got to the car and in the rain ran back to get it.....(was MAYBE 4 minutes!)......The young man with a silly smirk on his face said ""oh I\'m sorry they threw it out"".......I could not believe it. He just stood there and stared at me! A classy restaurant (I know this from past experience) keeps the boxed food for up to 30 minutes as a courtesy for those people who sometimes do forget their take home box when they leave the table. Shame on you BJ\'s for wasting food and not allowing the benefit of the doubt for your guests....... think about it Management and make the necessary changes!"
Desiree N.,American Canyon  CA,1,20,14,2/5/2017,1.0,Please please please please please save yourself and avoid this BJ's restaurant at all costs. Let me tell you  I've been here about three times in my nineteen years of living and I've had bad experiences all three times  but let me tell you about the last time I went. So my friends and I were hungry and Lucille's was closed so we decided to go to BJ's  that was our first mistake. We were seated promptly and everything was going okay until we got our food. There were four of us and NOT ONE item was cooked correctly. I got soup in a bread bowl  the soup was cold and the bread bowl was burnt  so burnt that I could not break into it with my teeth at all. One of my friends got an artichoke dip and the chips were stale and the dip was crusting/burnt  we didn't know how it was possible to screw up a dip but okay! My other friend ordered a pasta and it had NO TASTE  we all tried it and none of us could eat it. So we called the waiter over and complained  she had an attitude even though we kindly explained to her that this food was something that a dog wouldn't dare touch. I knew that she would be no help so I told her to call her manager. The manager came over and was kind enough to have our food remade. Two of my friends were so disappointed that they didn't want their food remade so the manager agreed to have the food that we didn't eat removed from the check. The second batch that came out was great  food that we should've got the first time around  but we were happy that they finally got it right. However  when it was time to pay for the check  all hell broke loose. Our evil waiter carried her attitude the whole night and almost exploded when we asked to split the check and remove the food that we didn't eat from the check (keep in mind  the manager previously agreed). On the way out  we asked for our change (that our waiter neglected to return to us) and the waiter literally starting YELLING about how much of an inconvenience we were. It was so embarrassing and I couldn't BELIEVE what was happening. Almost everyone in the restaurant turned to look at us and as much as we wanted our change  we couldn't stand the negative attention so we simply left. As someone who has worked in food service for almost four years  I couldn't understand how she could do such a thing to paying customers  and get away with it. I called corporate and my call was never returned. There's not much I can do but I will make sure to pray for that girl.
Ellis B.,San Leandro  CA,19,65,56,12/5/2016,1.0,Over 30 mins wait for food  no water refill. Horrible experience. People were getting up and walking out. Bar maid knew no prices on beer. What a joke.
Charlene S.,Moraga  CA,0,18,1,1/26/2017,4.0,I was so excited a special friend gave me her extra slice of sausage pizza from BJs. I haven't been to BJs in years but I'm already craving it again! Even though I heated up the slice it was still so moist& sooooo delicious  w/ so much chz & fresh tomatoes :) I would love to give BJs 5 stars but I I wish their prices were a bit lower. However  your pizza is amazing& worth the visit!
Ploy A.,Richmond  CA,57,2,1,12/11/2016,2.0,We come here often but hosting&seating system never change.There a lot of empty tables but I don't understand why they won't seat people there.i give 2 stars because we love your beers not the service
Jenna K.,Sacramento  CA,0,10,1,1/21/2017,2.0,I went on a first date there last night. I noticed the protocol seems to be asking the table if they want separate checks or checks together  I think it's incredibly rude. Im sure it makes it easier to split the bill if you know ahead of time  but don't ask. Hand us the bill and if we want it separate WE will ask. Just made things a little awkward for us.
Myra V.,Martinez  CA,86,22,26,4/20/2015,2.0,"I\'m just going to get to the point in saying that I\'ve always liked the food here. It\'s ok  pretty good. Every once in a while I\'ll crave a pizookie and come by with my family. BUT THEN we\'ll come in and the service is so bad that it\'ll remind us why we don\'t come in so often. We prob haven\'t been to this location in over a year prior to today\'s visit. The service was just as bad back then. Today our server was Katie. We\'ve seen her here over a year ago so she\'s been around for a while. We used to see her in the bar area but I guess she\'s serving on the lower dining area now. We arrived at approx. 7:45pm and didn\'t leave until approx 9:10pm. We were seating for at least ten minutes before they took our order or even brought waters over. We ordered an appetizer (carnitas fries  they prob weren\'t worth the $6)  a pizza to share  my son ordered a kids meal  and we shared a pizookie at the end. When ordering  I asked Katie to tell me what was on one of the pizzas featured on the table that wasn\'t in the menu (I think it was called the Prime Veggie?)  and she had no idea but pulled an answer out of her ass. She proceeded to ask me ""What DON\'T you like  and I\'ll tell you if it\'s on there?"" I didn\'t have an answer for her but I told her I just wanted it to have artichokes. She confidently said that it did so I ordered it  but of course we later found out that it did NOT have artichokes. She didn\'t come by the table very much  and when she did we asked her for two ranch dressings. She only brought one. When we reminded her about the second one  she never brought it. We didn\'t order much but it took SO LONG for us to be served. I understand that sometimes it may be a little busy  but the service was bad as soon as we sat down. Another thing that irritated me was that for some reason the table next to us that arrived after we did (and had a bigger party than us) received their check before we did! UGH. I had to calm my boyfriend down because he was ready to just get up  leave  and tell the people in the front that Katie was taking too long to come by with our check. Bj\'s is nice  but not this location. The service here is horrible  and has been for years. Only come if you\'re not in a rush or have nothing to do for the rest of your night. And Katie-- I\'ve worked in the restaurant industry before  where I\'ve had to know what came with every single menu item and combination we offered. We know you\'re not new here  so I suggest you step your customer service game up. I apologize if this is harsh  but I believe that you did NOT deserve the 15% that I tipped you."
Alexa A.,Hercules  CA,111,26,56,6/11/2016,4.0,I love bj's  but they're good not great. The service was slow  but our waitress was very kind. We were seated quickly and promptly ordered drinks and appetizers. We had the combo appetizer with mozzarella sticks  artichoke dip and chips  avocado rolls and buffalo wings. It would've been perfect without the avocado rolls. They were just egg rolls stuffed with avocado  not very pleasing. After our appetizer we waited quite awhile for our main courses to arrive  some of the sides were messed up (fries instead of mashed potatoes) but were fixed quickly. Of course we ended our meals with pizookies! We ordered the trio which included 3 mini pizookies for $10. It was marvelous.
Marietta G.,Concord  CA,10,13,13,9/17/2016,1.0,We called ahead knowing full well it gets pretty crowded  the reception forgot to check us in when we got there.  We waited 20 minutes.  Our food was not fresh  my friend and I both ordered Ahi Tuna and the tuna looked dry and old. I ordered this dish several times and loved it  this time the tuna was hidden in the lettuce and cut in tiny portion. Not worth what we paid for. On top of that we both got sick.
Jay B.,Pleasant Hill  CA,104,409,359,3/6/2016,4.0,I am a fan for BJ!Came here on a random Saturday morning. I ordered the all you can eat soup and salad. It was well worth the price!!I couldn't believe it!I am surely a fan!!
Rachel S.,Pleasanton  CA,752,543,282,4/1/2015,3.0,My boyfriend and I came here after a long night of bingo playing. It was one of the only places that was still open at 11:30PM. I hadn't ever been to this particular BJ's  I knew it was by the mall...but I didn't know if it was on the other side of the freeway with all the other restaurants. Note: it's connected to the mall. Since it was so late  the dining room was closed and only serving in the bar area. That was fine  there was a good amount of people sitting in there. Service was a little on the slow side at first  but once our waitress came  it picked up. My boyfriend and I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip  wings and a flatbread pizza. The spinach and artichoke dip  we could have passed on. It was like it had been sitting out from earlier and they threw it in the microwave and reheated it. It was a weird quiche-like texture  instead of a creamy dip  like texture. I suppose that's what happens when you go to a restaurant late.The wings  we ordered half and half  different sauces. I got the garlic parmesean and my boyfriend got some hot buffalo flavored sauce. I liked mine  they were good with ranch. You do have to ask for an extra side of ranch though  if you have two different flavors because they only give you one. The flatbread pizza was okay. A little more greasy than I remembered from other locations  but overall we liked it. Our waitress was really nice. It was my birthday  so she made sure to bring out a personal sized pizookie. I understand that going to businesses close to when they're closing can change your experience a little bit. I wouldn't say that this isn't a bad location  but you could definitely tell that they wanted to get out of there ASAP that night.
Stacy C.,Antioch  CA,0,16,,9/13/2016,1.0,I have been going to this place since they have opened and it has definitely gone down hill. I was bragging to my boyfriend how great this place was and we have gone there twice in the last month and ended up just leaving because the server just wouldn't come to us. We sat there for at least 15 minutes and didn't even get a water! This place is a joke! I will definitely not be going back here again.. such a shame!
Patricia F.,El Sobrante  CA,0,1,,1/4/2017,1.0,If you are into beer and watching sports on big screen TV this is the place with over 30 beers on tap. The food is mediocre and service is slow. We started with clam chowder which was barely warm. The grilled Mahi Mahi tacos were a skimpy piece of fish covered in cabbage  served again barely warm  not good. I've had lunch here before never again for dinner and think twice about going back for lunch.The waiter was nice and offered a replacement entree but I didn't want to wait for it. I just wanted to be done and gone!!
Emily L.,Martinez  CA,0,2,,6/22/2017,5.0,I don't know why there are so many reviews about bad customer service at this location. I come here with a group of friends one to two times a week on average because they're the best. The food is not only fantastic and whether they mess up and bring you the wrong plate or they find something in the food. Accidents happen and it's a food establishment........ and they DO care and will handle your situation timely and appropriately but it's very rare that they do mess up because they're great! The service I would say is a big reason why we all choose to come back every week. You not only want to try everything on the menu because it is reasonably priced and looks great  but the way they treat you and care about you as a person not only a customer is hard to come by! Once you walk in the door you're most likely greeted by Katie the hostess with a welcoming smile and a genuine hello. Her and the other hosts/hostesses do their best to seat you in a reasonable time frame depending on the night you're dining with them always keeping you updated on the status of your wait and you can see them making sure you are taken care of. She really welcomes you and makes you feel like your business is really appreciated and it's a nice beginning to your night out! Once you're seated if you get Hailey as a waitress you are SETTTTTTT for a great dinner. One of the BEST waitresses I would say that I've ever had the pleasure in being helped by. She too will kindly greet you with a genuine smile and ask you how you're doing. She always makes sure that you have drinks  your food and that you are doing great overall. She also really cares about you as a person  always keeping a smile on her face as she asks you about your day and what she can do to make your visit great. You can also see her working extremely hard on the floor waiting several tables on a busy night but she never neglects one table over the other  making sure everyone is taken care of. Super professional but also funny and fun to have as a waitress! And even if it is a busy night she'll always be super generous  helpful and informative to you and your table because she wants you to have a great experience. Incredible service  go in and request if she's there you won't regret it. If you get Mia as a waitress you're golden as well because she too always makes sure that you're not only handled in a timely fashion but she lets you know that you're appreciated and that even though she's waiting other tables  when she's with you  you are at the top of her priority list. She also really knows what she's talking about when it comes to questions on the menu or anything in general and she again like Hailey always makes sure that you above all are doing good and enjoying your time. She's also extremely patient  looking at their menu can be tough because everything looks so good and she will help you sort out your options and offer to wait as long as you need to make your decision. There's no rush or pressure when you're being helped by her she's just super nice  fun and respectful. Wonderful service as well  definitely would recommend her too! Gabby as well is another great  fast and a wonderful server to have! She too is informative  nice  friendly and cares about you and who you're with making sure that you're not waiting too long and that you're always happy with your meal and your time in the restaurant. They're all so great at what they do  and make the experience of coming here so much more fun and overall better! I have always had extremely positive and great experiences when I come here and I truly look forward to it every week as it has become a weekly meeting spot for my friends and I to come out on the days they have great deals which is basically everyday  seriously get out there and look them up  you will be there every week too they're so great. The service is wonderful and again is what makes us want to come back and look forward to returning week after week. They may have a few servers that are not as great  but that's what really makes you value your time with the hosts  hostesses  waiters and waitresses who are above and beyond at their job! Also if there ever is an issue remember that people make mistakes and that it's a food business where nobody is always perfect and they do handle any complaint or dissatisfaction timely and are truly sorry and offer you something in return to make sure again that YOU are happy. They're all human  cut a little slack on the harsh reviews  they do a fantastic job at this establishment. Go in and check them out!
Alex G.,San Francisco  CA,177,19,,11/4/2016,1.0,After calling in to reserve our party before hand  we still had to wait 30 minutes for them to rudely tell us that it'll be another 40 minutes to be seated. It's truly baffling that people still come this sorry excuse for a BJ's.
Jenelle C.,Concord  CA,1,32,35,10/24/2016,5.0,Just want to say thank you so much to CORREEN!!!! She was super nice and very fast with her job. I didn't have to ask for anything twice which is a 1st  and what I loved is she brought me water to start without me having to ask. She is super friendly and if I ever come back here I will ask for her before they seat me.best customer service I've had all year... thank you so much correen for the amazing experience .
Tiffany D.,Pittsburg  CA,85,75,47,1/17/2016,1.0,"Went in today to pick up my online order on my oh so perfectly timed break... walked in look to my left there\'s a group of black shirts talking about another customer at the hostess stand. I make eye contact and they all scurry away like ants... no acknowledgement of my presence but hey that\'s no problem! I know how it is when your at work!Anywho  I stand waiting at the ""order pick up"" register to retrieve said online order that I can physically see eyeballing me from the back counter. My Santa Fe Chicken Salad is waiting for me and I\'m waiting for it too.... The host dude is still standing there looking at his list of NO ONE on his clipboard...While im standing there  the phone in front of me rings  same host walks over  picks up the phone greets and places them on hold. I\'m thinking ""yes! He\'s coming to help me pick up my food!"" Host places the receiver down and walks away... Mind you he\'s like 1 foot away. HE NEVER SAYS ANYTHING TO ME! Should I have been one of those ""um  excuse me do you work here"" type of customers? Appalled by the BASIC lack of customer engagement at the front of the house  I literally turned around and walked out. Thanks BJ\'S you ruined my lunch break."
Lisa C.,Walnut Creek  CA,250,284,366,1/25/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,The food menu can be a bit overwhelming. I love their appetizers  but when I ordered the avocado egg rolls they came out looking thrown onto the plate :/ The pizza was a but doughy. It is kid friendly with crayons and high chairs. They have very tasty shoestring fries for the kids at .95 cents it is a good deal  too. They also have kids cups. ODDLY our waitress brought us double what we ordered for the kids  she may have smoked a joint prior to her shift...I really like their beverage menu and famous pazookies. Unfortunately when I ordered mine it was touch and not ooey gooey chewy deliciousness I had hoped for. The small bites and salads loom healthy and tasty  with unique offerings. The stuffed mushrooms were delightful and packed with flavor  but again thrown onto the plate. They are big of flavor...However  we went when it was slow. Not busy at all  during the day...so I do not see why our meals were rushed and sloppily plated. I would like to make my way back there and give it a second chance. Parking is a bummer because of the mall  however it is convenient if you want to go shopping at the mall  anyways.
Isabel A.,Clayton  CA,23,6,,11/25/2016,5.0,Went here for lunch the good was great the waiter was exceptional! His name is thomas he was very happy and polite and helpful!
Susan P.,Yuba City  CA,5,6,,6/12/2017,1.0,"I brought my friend to the restaurant to enjoy a good meal. I have been  happily  to many BJ\'s including Natomas  CA  Sacramento  CA  Santa Rosa  CA (many times) etc... The Concord BJ\'s was a huge disappointment. The lite plate salmon came on a bed of woody asparagus (no removal of woody bottoms) and the salmon was lacking in sauce. Our server brought our drinks and we never saw him again for refills or any other aspect of service. I had to ask for the bill 3 times from other servers and after a good bit of time (10 minutes) the manager came and said that the meal was ""on the house"". I did appreciate this but would have much preferred a good meal with adequate service. Apparently  BJ\'s has not reviewed their reviews because this seems to be a chronic problem."
Kirk S.,Eureka  CA,111,116,42,3/21/2015,3.0,You call this shit #deepdish? Lol the entire Chicago metropolitan area is laughing and pointing at you BJ. To be fair  it tastes really good but just because you cook it in a deep dish doesn't mean it is. Also you gain and both lose a star for the root beer. Props for the frosty mug. This is the only proper way to serve root beer but it's not very good. It's ok. Not great.
Annalisia A.,Pittsburg  CA,0,11,2,5/22/2017,1.0,Came in last night for a pizooki to go. Arrived to curb side and waited 10 minutes  after no one came outside I called the front desk and told them I was at curb side for a take out order. I was told someone would be right with me. After another 10 minutes my boyfriend went inside to get the order. When he arrived the pizooki was not ready. After another 10 minutes my boyfriend got the food but their were no utensils or whip cream as we had asked for on the online order. When asked for it the hostess laughed and on her way back from grabbing the whip cream she dropped the food on the floor and continued to laugh. Awful customer service.
Kristin A.,Lafayette  CA,85,110,563,6/19/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,My most recent visit to this location I ordered and Bloody Mary ($7.95) and the Classic Rib-Eye ($21.95). As usual  the Bloody Mary was absolutely delicious. My steak came with a choice of two sides  I chose a baked potato and brussel sprouts. I ordered my steak rare and boy did they deliver! most places totally fail at preparing my steak as rare as I like it  but BJs knows exactly how to prepare a rare steak! My friend also ordered a steak  she got hers medium rare and she said it was cooked perfectly too. For one of her sides she ordered the Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad which I tried I couple bites of  it was pretty good  the onions were a tad overpowering in my opinion.Our server Mackenzie was really attentive and was so sweet about me asking for extra sour cream and chives for my baked potato twice. The first time she brought us steak-sauce  the bottle was pretty much empty and when we asked for another one  the second one was empty as well. We laughingly said screw it and ate our steaks without any steak-sauce and we actually didn't really need it. The steaks were so flavorful and juicy that I think that the steak-sauce would have taken away from that. The steaks here are really great and priced really well. This will definitely continue to be my go-to spot when I am craving a well-priced  rare steak.
Pia A.,Rodeo  CA,74,6,7,4/30/2017,1.0,First time coming to this place and I went during lunch with my family. The food was good  very yummy  I ordered the Fresh Atlantic Salmon and it was delicious  perfectly cooked  my mom ordered the Peruvian Quinoa Salad with Salmon as well and it was also good. Food wise it was pretty spot on  my only problem with this place is the service. Our first server was a gentleman  very nice and patient  and we were a big party of more than twelve  with some seniors and rowdy children. I applaud him for his outstanding patience. It was the other server  a young woman who was very rude and just utterly horrible to us that ruined a perfectly good Sunday lunch. She raised her voice while addressing some of our desserts and just was a totally horrible server  with an equally repulsive attitude. If I'm not mistaken her name was Justine. She completely dampened the mood. Hopefully management will be able to address such rude servers  it's bad for business. I will comeback again  hopefully  but maybe not to this location  I like to enjoy my meals in a pleasant mood  with pleasant accomodating  and POLITE servers.
Janice J.,Concord  CA,130,26,47,3/23/2016,3.0,3/22/16 came here randomly at around 9 on a Tuesday. The restaurant wasn't busy and we got a table after a couple minutes of entering.We ordered: ravioli  Siracha chicken bacon Mac n cheese  jambalaya and spicy Hawaiian deep dish pizza. The ravioli was good  the cheese was delicious and I would definitely order it again.The Siracha chicken bacon Mac n cheese wasn't that great. It was a new dish of theirs. It wasn't really Mac n cheese used penne noodles  sauce was watery and there was no spiciness to it. It was just edible.Jambalaya was great. It was spicy  salty and just fulfilling. I don't mind the saltiness but my uncle didn't like it said it was too salty. The spicy Hawaiian deep dish pizza was okay. It wasn't spicy  had jalapeos on it to make it spicy and the sauce on it...what sauce? I hardly tasted any sauce. It wasn't really a deep dish pizza if you know what I mean? It was just deep because of the thick dough. Idk I guess I'm used to Chicago deep dish pizza. I wish we had ordered a different kind but my uncles friend doesn't like pepperoni!?!?! Whatever.The waiter was friendly  he did his job well. Honestly didn't even feel like going out to eat but my sister made me. It was just one of those nights where you enter the restaurant  order  eat  talk a little  pay and then leave. So nothing really special.
Titus F.,Fairfield  CA,37,134,282,6/21/2015,3.0,My lovely Queen and I decide to venture out and out our money card to good use. At first we went by the BJ's in Vacaville but decided for a change of scenery. With that  we ended up in Concord. Since the crowd was bustling  we were given a buzzer for a 20-30min wait. W/in 25mins my hand was vibrating  alerting me that our table for two was ready. Upon re-entry in the restaurant  we were happily greeted and quickly escorted. But for the rest of the service  it wasn't as quick. Our waitress did not come until a good 10mins passed. After ordering and receiving our drinks  we ordered the Crispy Calamari and our entrees: the NEW Deep Dish Spicy Hawaiian Chicken pizza and BJ's Favorite Deep Dish (check the pics). Once we had a bit of a wait to receive our main course. Next time I'll do w/o the appetizer b/c it freaked me out a bit. Looked like fried squid and too rubbery...(shh  I found out after I ate most it that it's not fried fish!)In the end  the food was very enjoyable with tasty pia coladas. Service was a bit slow  but not too slow that the experience was a drag.
Danika Z.,Walnut Creek  CA,304,101,14,9/13/2016,5.0,By far the best bjs I have been too. Our waiter Geoffrey was so attentive and prompt. Brought my bf to bjs . It was his first time at bjs and he love it and very impressed with both the service and food.
Paul S.,Pleasant Hill  CA,2,26,6,10/25/2016,2.0,Sub par food and service  the pizokie and tvs at the bar are the only things that keep this place going
Lauren B.,Concord  CA,0,4,,7/16/2016,1.0,I don't ever write negative reviews  really. But this...was a terrible experience. We put our name down for 12 people at 6:30 and they said 20-30 mins. That's fine. They told us at 7:15 that they were waiting for one table to leave  ok! Then at 7:30 they sat a table for 16 people who arrived half an hour after us. A hostess came up to us saying that the other group had made a reservation and needed to be seated...and that it would be around another 45 mins. for us to be seated. We ended up leaving rather than wait another 45 mins  which would make our 20-30 min. estimated wait turn into almost 2 hours. I don't think any of us will be returning to this location- that was the most ridiculous experience I've ever had at any restaurant!
Jessie O.,Danville  CA,52,213,81,3/4/2016,3.0,We came here for a birthday celebration. We were disappointed upon arrival to find out that the happy hour specials are only good in the bar area while we were already seated at a table. I was trying to eat healthy  so I appreciated the calorie information on all the items. I was surprised to spend $20 on a starter salad and an entree. No dessert. No drink. That's more the price I expect to pay for 2 people. At least our server was nice and split our checks.
Jay G.,Clayton  CA,1,24,,12/5/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,BJ's is a great place to eat casual dinners. You can sample the starters and the side dishes and come away completely satisfied without even ordering an entre. The beer selection is very good  with both in-house and other common beers from which to chose. We usually head to the bar area where the tables are first-come available. There are probably 10 TV moniters spaced throughout the restaurant. The sound quality is very good  easy to carry on a conversation without shouting. There seem to be several wait staffers  but the bar area always has too few  so these poor girls are running all night just trying to keep up. If the kitchen misses something (like sauce for the wings)  you will wait quite a while for the waters to cycle back to you. Empty beer glasses sit for a long time before you are offered another one. All that  but the food is very good  dependable everytime we re-visit. Great variety  so everyone gets their choices.
Kim P.,San Francisco  CA,58,8,3,10/12/2016,1.0,Just had the worst experience at BJs. This isn't the first time the food has been sub-par and served luke warm or cold. We went there for lunch and ordered an appetizer which hadn't been delivered after 25 minutes. Let manager know we were still waiting and about 5 minutes later we finally got our appetizer. After being there almost 50 minutes  1 person at our table got their food which was soup and salad. The caesar salad was really pathetic looking  the soup was COLD. Went to manager again and told him soup was cold. After this  no one else received their food  so we told manager we were leaving. On our way out  one of the waitresses made a rude comment that we didn't know how to behave in public.... WHAT? Again  we had to inform manager on the way out what the waitress said to us. Since when is poor service and cold food not a reason to complain? NEVER going back again.
Sandy H.,Antioch  CA,40,95,151,11/22/2016,1.0,Veggies were under cooked. My daughter stared at her salad for 10 mins until they gave her a fork finally. Services was bad. They need to work on their service at this location. They need to take pointers from the Brentwood location which is amazing.
IshaqSana S.,Hercules  CA,0,8,3,4/4/2016,5.0,Give this place a 5 star the staff was very nice everyone knew what they where doing (unlike other places some ppl seem a bit lost) and very friendly  i loved the dessert menu amazing especially the strawberry beganet! and our food was delicious
Flavia C.,Fremont  CA,9,8,3,9/18/2016,1.0,If I could give negative stars  I would. This place is terrible. Their service sucks... Took over 30 mins for our food to arrive.
Y. C.,Oakland  CA,36,73,117,9/4/2016,2.0,Arrived and was texted to be seated...cool service...took our seats and its 30 minutes later and no drinks or foodit's an iceberg in here and if I would have read the reviews I would have gone to In and Out! 45 minutes and counting pizzas just arrived... No plates no salad.. Salad arrived 5 minutes after the pizza ...Spoke with manager ... Did I mention the salad and pizza work appetizers? Food was comped by the manager. Waitress was sweet ... Not coming back till they get it together !!!!
Joy E.,Lakeport  CA,22,3,,10/15/2016,1.0,Took an hour before anyone noticed we didit get anything to eat yet  asked the manager to see what was up he never came back to see if we were ok? We went to a horse show Calvera in Santa Jose all the way from Calistoga and had to drive home empty in our stomach maybe stop somewhere to get a bite. Kind of ruined the great time......
m f.,Alameda  CA,0,25,4,10/6/2016,1.0,Last night  my girlfriend and I were waiting for a table in the bar to be cleaned  after someone had spilled their drink and broken a glass on the floor. I witnesses the bus boy literally wipe up the floor  glass and all  then use the SAME RAG to wipe down the tables and chairs. We were sitting their watching  and couldn't believe how anyone working in food service could be so ignorant  especially with people waiting for the table  watching! It sucks because we eat here every so often  but we will NEVER be back after witnessing that. Who trains these people? Who manages them? Unreal.
Jr A.,Suisun City  CA,0,4,,4/29/2017,2.0,slow service but one of mangers he cool tho gave us free pizookie he real one...our servers took so long to give us our food and check not really happy I had to wait so long :(
Miko A.,San Francisco  CA,160,93,419,10/26/2015,5.0,I just come here for happy hr come mon to thur not that busy an the food get out on time love come here free parking an shopimg Afer lunch the place is nice the food an drink are good Will have a good afternoon have happy Monday to all of u
Nicokle I.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,3,,4/28/2017,1.0,The food is exactly what you would expect from a mid level chain but the service is TERRIBLE! Expect rude waiters and at least 20 minutes for even the most basic salad.
Alma M.,Concord  CA,1,30,26,9/14/2016,4.0,Tuna salad is the best. They have this little dessert cookie dough with ice cream OMG its delicious. Good place for dinner.
Shelli H.,Martinez  CA,362,249,1296,10/30/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Wow! Good job Bjs at stepping up your game! My mom and I regularly eat lunch here. Our server was William H  he was spot on our needs. I had the grilled ahi salad  not the first time I have had it but it was definitely the best. I asked for extra wasabi  it was delivered by a runner. Barely any wasabi. 1 bite in and here comes William with a big scoop of it. Excellent!! He checked on us constantly but not annoyingly . My mom had the new chicken pesto sandwich and she also enjoyed her food.. They must be listening to all the bad reviews because this time it was outstanding.. Good job BJs.
Alexis L.,Walnut Creek  CA,182,80,22,3/26/2015,4.0,The carnitas fries are my absolute favorite appetizer and of course I love the pizookies. It's like any other BJ's except this one is consistently filled at the bar and throughout the restaurant. I've always had great service here
Mondo M.,Concord  CA,45,12,11,1/29/2017,1.0,Worst service ever at this place. Went to eat Saturday for lunch it was around 1:30 we where seated pretty quick. Got our orders in  in a timely manner. We get out drinks I drink my $4.00 root beer and it took for ever to get a refill. My 2 daughters got chocolate milk they didn't get a refill the guy bring me another drink after I tried to eat the driest burger I ever had. The brisket Burger was a total let down. I sent it back they took it off check my daughters chicken tenders where also dry if not for a bottle of ketchup I don't think she would have ate them. I had the tortilla soup it tasted ok but gave me stomach problems first stomach pains then explosion as I nearly made it home. We are to sleek with manger he never came. Then the district manager called me I missed his call called him back and he said he would call me and never heard back from him. The first time we went to BJ the bar was set high the waiter was awesome drinks never got past half the food came out was on point. He made sure we had every thing we needed now we go and get crap food and bad service. Oh and when we got the food we had to wait to see server to ask for utensils because we had none at the table. I would not recommend going to BJ's anymore. I went to in and out after we left BJ's and the $4.00double cheese burger animal style was 100 times better then BJ's 15.99 brisket burger. If you want a good brisket burger go to Lumpy's..
Eddie W.,Oakland  CA,0,5,1,4/18/2017,1.0,Congratulations you got one star for getting my order correct! Maybe next time if you don't send all your servers home early you'll get more stars. Never come here for a late night snack  the service is horrible. The waitress tried to talk to me like she was my step mom. And everybody knows damn well they get no respect. Hopefully they'll come to your table before the have an attitude. She kept coming to our table complaining about other customers and management. I'm sorry is this a restaurant or a pity party? Try again motherfucker.
Angela J.,Newark  CA,13,9,11,9/21/2016,1.0,Wow ... Unbelievable that a well known restaurant like BJ Brewery in Concord  CA can prepare and present food that looks so unappetizing. The plate was dirty  pieces of avocado inside the rolls were smushed and falling out  and the garnish were scattered and looks as if someone grabbed some grass and threw it on the plate. Sorry  but food presentation must be appealing  not looks like it's was flopped on the plate from Folsom prison.
Veronica D.,San Ramon  CA,5,18,8,6/13/2016,1.0,We preordered.... They couldn't find our order... When they brought it out it was cold... The soup was cold the fries were not only cold they where hard... The fish was greasy. They brought me another order of fries. But they where not any better.. The salad even had some old pieces of Roman lettuce. The pizookie saved the meal.
Gory W.,Phoenix  AZ,23,54,5,10/4/2016,4.0,Friendly Staff  happy hour all day during any NFL game day. I had a ribeye steak  very tasty and 3 beers at the bar while watching the game. Met a few friendly patrons men and women who were enjoying 6 TV'S as the Giants beat the Dodgers  as NFL played on 5 others. A great place to watch the game lots of TV'S across the huge dining area. I will return
Anne C.,Napa  CA,1298,498,592,12/25/2013,4.0,I have never been to Bjs  but I was forced to come here and after two glasses of MacMurray Pinot Noir  I got their version of a Caprese salad. Then we got the appetizer veggie pizza. Then the mac n cheese no bacon. And then the Beignet. :) Yum. Fast service. Comfortable booths. Although there was a ten minute wait to sit in a near empty restaurant.
Mikaela B.,San Ramon  CA,176,71,82,6/20/2016,3.0,Nice waitress but wouldn't order the deep dish ravioli again  noodles where uncooked inside & it tasted bad. Looked like mush.
Bonnie B.,Pleasant Hill  CA,9,10,,4/22/2016,2.0,Good food. Terrible service. Waitress picked up previous bill and did not even acknowledge our presence. A simple hello would have been nice. I wanted a booth. Waited with dirty dishes in front of us for 15 minutes  finally sat at the bar. Bartender was great. Used to be a great place. Kudos to the kitchen!! Always good and reasonable wait time.
Judy W.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,15,,3/14/2017,1.0,This is the second time my friend and I went to BJs and had the same problems  so it will be the last. We were encouraged by all the 5 star reviews recently written and hoped they had improved  but we had the same problems with slow service. My wine was delivered almost immediately  but it took over 15 minutes to get water and the tea that was ordered at the same time. It took forever for the server to take our food orders too. My fish tacos which supposedly contained 'grilled' mahi mahi were so overwhelmed with cabbage salad that I didn't notice until it was too late that the fish was breaded and fried. The pieces were so small  it was a wonder I found them at all. So much potential and such a great menu  but it BJ's just doesn't deliver!
Samantha N.,Antioch  CA,116,5,,6/5/2016,5.0,The beginning of my experience was horrible. They lost my table reservation  and they tried to make us sit in the 100 degree weather with two elderly men and a child When the restaurant was half empty. But  as soon as we were sat  our experience changed around. Craig was such an awesome server he made our experience amazing. It was my little sisters birthday and it was perfect from the moment he took our drink order. Our glasses were never empty  he was always there when needed  and he remembered her name from only being told once. I worked at the cheesecake factory for 4 and half years  and I was a designated trainer  I know what good service looks like and he went above and beyond! I would definitely ask for him the next time! Thank you.
Anabel A.,Richmond  CA,0,1,,3/11/2017,5.0,This was my first time here at BJs. I will defiantly come back. The manager Douglas was very kind i loved everything he recommended. And our waiter Mel was one of the best!
Craig H.,Walnut Creek  CA,159,165,197,11/30/2014,3.0,This is a good place to come if you're looking to eat a sandwich or a flatbread pizza. One of my favorite things to eat there is the Barbeque Pulled Pork. They have many different types of house drafts also. For dessert you need to have a Pizookie it's the best thing to eat here and my favorite is the Triple Chocolate Pizookie made with Ghirardelli chocolate.  Overall the servers are pretty nice but the service is just average.
Concerned C.,Martinez  CA,2,34,,4/13/2016,2.0,SUMMARY:My best guess is poor management with no leadership.EXPLANATION:Where to begin....When we first started going here  they seemed pretty good. Good location with lots of staff who did their jobs  decent food  and not much competition. In the last couple years  we noticed the service and quality have dropped significantly. Sometimes there are lots of staff  but when there are  it seems they group together and talk...mostly about how dissatisfied they are working there. Other times there are few staff  and they still talk...mostly about how dissatisfied they are there. Of course  there have always been good  hard working employees also. A while back  we were helped by a relatively new employee there (Jake). We got to talking to him  and he explained that he came here from another BJ's location to help the manager create a better environment for the customers and employees--they ARE related. It was a great conversation that made us feel better about coming back. The last two times we have come here  we were somewhat enthusiastic about having Jake for a server. Each time  however  he just didn't seem to care anymore. Most recently  we heard him complaining about staff. We noticed that not a single other employee came behind the bar to assist him with anything. Apparently  in turn  Jake demonstrated his unhappiness  anger  or frustration by providing us with very short and rude service....oh and the food sucked. We left the customary tip  but I do not know why...As we were leaving  we stopped outside the door to get our stuff together. There. we overheard two employees (who were on a smoke break) complaining about working there. It is sad to see a place  that should be great (based on location  menu  and apparent backing) devolve to this level where nobody wants to be there. I can only guess that Jake tried to make the place better  but instead became a victim. Then ruined our experience. Sad
Valerie W.,Fairfield  CA,1,8,1,9/4/2016,3.0,My family and I had dinner today at BJ's. The food and the service were good  but I forgot to mention I have a loyalty card. I guess it's my fault  but the last few times I have eaten here I am never asked if I am a loyalty member. I think this is something that the servers should be prompted to always ask. What better way to ensure repeat customers  when they receive perks. In my party today there were a total of 5 adults and 1 child  we generally find a location after Church to have lunch or dinner. BJ's keep us coming back  please remind me to provide my loyalty information.
Jeff K.,San Leandro  CA,0,7,,3/5/2017,5.0,Take my elderly mother there and Douglas the manager made sure everything went well with the food  service etc.Nice to go out to eat and people care about your service that doesnt happen very often and when it does it makes you want to come back again ..Which we will...Thank you
Winston L.,Hercules  CA,64,49,13,11/8/2015,3.0,It's alright. It kind of reminds me of Buffalo Wild Wings. Decent beer. Food is ok  but I don't really want to eat it unless I'm going there for another reason (watch the game  another friend picked the hangout place  etc.)Our dinner:Appetizers were solid. I feel like almost no restaurant can mess up fried stuff or chip + creamy dip though.Pizza - meh. It came in a pan and was kind of like deep dish  but I wouldn't really recommend it unless you had a serious hankering for some pizza.Ahi salad - decentPizookie - this thing was pretty freaking great. A hot cookie in small pan with ice cream on top.I definitely could see myself having a good time here for a sports occasion (beer  burger  apps). I can't see myself coming back here for dinner.
Will C.,Garden Grove  CA,185,186,111,8/2/2015,4.0,BJ's was crowded at dinner time  but its 2b expected in a big shopping center on Friday night. We'd spent the day sight seeing and shopping in San Francisco. So we are meeting relatives and having a reunion. They had arrived earlier and put their name on the queue for a table. When we arrived they had just down and ordered. Service for us was just as quick but I guess that doesn't count because we didn't have to wait. Girlfriend and her son split the classic burger . I had a similar burger with fries. Everything was great. And although someone technically paid the bill  I added my BJs loyalty membership number onto the check and they gave me credit without having my member card on hand. Nice touch  on top of quick service at the busy time.Well recommended  we will return whenever we go to Concorde.
Stacy C.,Pleasant Hill  CA,11,139,49,9/10/2015,2.0,One star for the tortilla soup  an extra star for service.Nowhere in the 20-page menu does it describe their soups  nor the fact that the tortilla soup is garnished with the vile herb  cilantro. Once that was remedied  the soup was the best thing we got.Mediterranean Chicken Pita was HORRIBLE. Raw  doughy pita  4 pieces of chicken and cubes of tomato  onion  and cucumber. Yawn. Don't be fooled by the wild grain salad  it's mostly mushy quinoa.The rest of the overpriced meal was about the same. Pan pizza was meh  we'll get Round Table next time. Driest  toughest ribeye ever. Yuck. $4 for a dinky side salad. And the wedge salad tasted sweet. SWEET. Gnarly.I'd go back for the soup  though.
Demetrece M.,Oakland  CA,22,6,1,2/12/2017,1.0,If I could give 0 stars I would. I'll make this short. Worst birthday celebration EVER. Ribeye was dry our salads arrived after our meal service was slow it took 30 mins to get ranch dressing I could go on just know I won't be coming back. I suppose if we were drinking server would have been more attentive I noticed the tables around us recieved alot of attention and ALL of them were drinking lots of alcohol.
Fred P.,Rancho Cordova  CA,22,41,97,8/20/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Another wonderful meal and pleasant atmosphere. This is still one of my favorite restaurants in the bay area. Jambalaya again  it was cooked to perfection as always.
Isadora Q.,Hercules  CA,249,49,142,6/6/2014,1.0,Been here a million times but today I gotta say...worst experience EVER! Usually I get A-1 treatment :(Hubby and I ordered appetizers. ..but it came with our meal. We sat there starving waiting. Finally my spaghetti lunch combo came but the pasta was cold. The meat sauce was just a scoop or two. All bad. Im sorry but I need a little more sauce with my meal. I asked for grated cheese that came 10 min after the meal was served. Manager asked how my meal was because I had asked for extra sauce...I told her what happened. She credited me my meal. I was scared to ask for anything else in case something would happen to my meal. I was good at that point. Luckily  I had a soup and my drink. But my drink was wrong as well! At that point the waiter was not trying to wait on us and gave us the bill. Too bad. So many ways he could be corrected all this by just taking it in stride. Every thing is a learning opportunity! But from the looks of it....this guy aint gonna last too long. Just not his forte to deal with people and cleaning up his mistakes.I'm not counting BJs out! One bad apple didn't spoil it all for me. I will be back!
Shaunte P.,San Leandro  CA,0,7,5,2/11/2016,4.0,I work close by & frequent this BJs location for lunch. The hostess' aren't very courteous but the food is delicious & keeps me coming back. The last time I went I ordered the smothered fried chicken on top of mashed potatoes & corn  it was only $7.50 on the lunch menu. It was soooo good! The only complaint I have is the years worth of dust on the devider that splits the booths. It was pretty disgusting especially because it's at eye level when you sit down. Other than that i had a great experience  I will jus avoid that booth area.
Lynne C.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,5,,8/9/2016,4.0,I was here last week with a group of ladies. Prior to our arrival I read the mixed reviews so was curious to see how it was when we arrived. Our servers were accommodating and Kayla(?) was attentive and helpful throughout our meal.  8 out of 9 of us enjoyed what we ordered and were not disappointed.Most of us would go back again.
Andrew G.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,8,,2/21/2017,4.0,The customer service is always on point and one of my favorite places to go to from birthday dinners to a casual night out with friends!
Eddie F.,Clayton  CA,3,5,2,8/5/2016,5.0,We have been visiting BJ's in Concord for over two years now. We eat here often as the entire family likes nearly everything on the menu and we are not hesitant to try new entrees. They change their menu on a regular basis. The service is always great as well as their brewery. It's consistently a great experience!
Audrey S.,Shasta Lake  CA,12,63,,9/5/2015,1.0,HORRIBLE  HORRIBLE SERVICE. Iris was the only saving grace! She came over after my sis & I had been abandoned for +15 solid minutes right when being seated. She got our orders started before she was off  but that was the only decent part. Joycelynn(sp?) could have cared less about picking up where Iris left off....abrasively bringing our less-than-stellar drinks  presumptuously trying to take our not-empty plates & rudely trying to take our money before we were ready. We've been in retail & it's a slave factory with low pay  but you DOOOOON'T  DON'T DON'T not give at the very least minimal pleasantries!!! That earned her a tip and not in dollar signs.To re-iterate: We were seated. My sister went to the bathroom for 5 minutes  came back and we sat for another 10 or more watching the tumbleweeds blow by until Iris-whom deserves a raise/promotion-sympathetically came over and at least got our orders going. BLESS YOU  GIRL!! THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS NEEDS MORE EMPATHIC EMPLOYEES LIKE YOURSELF.Joycelynn....yeeeeaaaah. =__=P.S. This has nothing to do with race  but quality customer service. It could've been a Caucasian *serving* us with a great sympathetic African-American and Middle-Eastern bartender personally bringing our booze.
Martha S.,Alameda  CA,60,28,81,7/28/2015,2.0,After months of hearing my friends and family rave about BJ's  I finally had an occasion to visit the restaurant. There was a reservation for 8:00 pm Saturday July 25  arrived at 7:20 pm because I thought the reservation was for 7:30 pm. 8:05 the party sitting at our tables have yet to leave. 8:20 we are finally get our tables. By this time I am starving because I had not eaten in hours due to meetings and a gradation. I order the BJ's Classic Rib Eye Steak and asked it to be cooked to medium rare. When I finally received my food I was extremely disappointed. The rib eye was a horrible cut of meat  more than 30% of the steak was gristle and fat. It was nearly impossible to cut a piece that didn't have fat on it. I did not send it back because I did not wish to wait 40 minutes for another steak. I ate 1/2 at the restaurant and took the rest home as it was too much of a hassle to finish there. I did order a peanut cookie pizookie and it was delicious. I would like to add that our server  a slender woman with red hair (can't be 100 percent sure as the restaurant was so dark) was very nice. If it was not for her I would have given the restaurant a single star.
Kyrah A.,Hercules  CA,127,87,31,7/1/2014,3.0,The beer selection is great. The ambiance is nice. The staff is friendly. The food is pretty good. I do wish they had more of a selection  but if that cuts down on the beer selection in any way  I retract my last statement.
Steve S.,Concord  CA,59,317,116,5/28/2015,1.0,I was starting to become a fan here. Loved the new app that lets you seat ahead waiting list and order your food ahead of time. So this last time we tried using the app and seemed to work fine. App said you are on the active wait list that is currently 35 minutes. So we arrive within 30 minutes to be told the wait is 45 minutes to one hour. But I said wait we checked in on the app. And I was told time does not start until you check in at counter. Wait what!?!  that is not what the app shows. Very disappointed and probably lost my family and myself from returning.
Marissa M.,Pittsburg  CA,0,2,,1/28/2017,2.0,Ordering from this location is HORRIBLE! First time the girl was going to forget to give me the salad I ordered that was right behind her on the shelf so I told her to give me the salad I just paid for  she also forgot to provide me an my appetizer that i paid for and I reliazed once I got to my destination so I had to drive all the way back. Manager was nice enough to provide me a gift card  which entails me to order togo about two weeks later... I was on hold trying to order my food for literally 30 minutes  mind you it is 12am and the restaurant is not busy at all  only about 4 tables are filled when I get there to pick up my food. I am waiting another 15 min food to be ready and to pay and than the girl says the Tomato Bisque soup I ordered is not available!!!! And to top it off I am late to my job from lunch  all because of BJ's horrible takeout system!!!!!
Travis L.,Honolulu  HI,19,7,,12/15/2016,1.0,Standing waiting for a table. There are visibly more empty tables than seated tables. At one point one of the girls was standing next to the hostess stand just talking to the host. Party of 6 who came in AFTER us (party of 4) got seated first. When we asked the host  they couldn't find our name in the system and made like it wasn't a big deal. No apology at all.
Ethan W.,Walnut Creek  CA,128,39,7,4/1/2016,1.0,Food cane out cold for all 5 of us. Took two hours to get in and out. Our drinks took 25 minutes to come to the table. Lousiest service I've ever had. Feel neglected. Also bathroom was disgusting. Called other staff to our table for service but the other staff also had bad service.
Christina C.,Martinez  CA,3,10,10,3/29/2016,2.0,To start off  it took our waitress 10-15 minutes to even come buy to take our orders for drinks. By the time we received our appetizer we had not received any silverware. We had to ask several times for our silverware while our appetizer got cold. We order the spinach stuffed mushrooms for our appetizer which was delicious.
Scarlette H.,Oakland  CA,0,24,2,7/24/2016,5.0,The food was great. I especially like the chicken parm.. Everything else we ordered was great to such as the burgers  grilled cheese and soup! The only thing is that they gave us the wrong food but then switched it and took it off the bill. They are also very nice!
Janice T.,Hercules  CA,223,589,2819,3/3/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I've been meaning to return to this place ever since I tried their Pizookie. However  my husband is not much of a fan of these types of establishments. He only relented because we had out-of-state friends we wanted to take out for appetizers and dessert at 9pm on a Sunday evening  and this was the only decent place we know that was open late.  AMBIANCE: I see it as a typical American chain with spacious dining area and extensive menu at moderate prices. SERVICE: I am docking a star because service was super slow. Granted that we were seated right away and our server was super friendly  the food took forever to come out from the kitchen. To think  the place was not packed as it was already 9pm. We just ordered drinks  an appetizer sampler  and a dessert sampler for crying out loud. We were almost finished with our drinks when the appetizer arrived. To make things worse  after encouraging us to try the different pizookie flavors  our server forgot to put the order in. So we waited a long time for...nothing. Major disappointment! We had to wait another half hour for dessert. Bummer!  DRINKS:Piranha Pint -- $5.25 Pale aleLightswitch Lager Pint -- $5.25 Malt flavored light beerStrawberry Margarita -- $9.50 Made of Ketel One Vodka and strawberries.Strawberry Splash -- $9.25 Made of Grey Goose Vodka  Disaronno Amaretto  Pia Colada and Strawberry Puree. I am not into alcoholic drinks  but I was able to appreciate this cocktail. FOOD:Best Beginnings -- $16.95 Consisted of Spinach & Artichoke Dip  Mozzarella Sticks  Avocado Egg Rolls and Santa Fe Spring Rolls. Excellent for sharing. However  if it were just me and my husband  we would have shied away from the sampler and just picked the avocado spring roll.Pizookie Trio -- $9.50 We ordered the red velvet  chocolate chunk  and white chocolate macadamia. The white chocolate macadamia was the best of the three. It was as good as I remembered it. The other two flavors were disappointing. They were too sweet for my taste.  We should have just gone white chocolate macadamia all the way.  BILL: Our total bill without tax was $60.71. That's not bad for a party of four. We could have saved 50% if we didn't order drinks. Word to the wise  go during happy hour if you want to save on drinks...duh!  :) VERDICT: Be prepared to wait forever for your food to arrive. However  if you have lots of time to kill  then you'll feel right at home here.
Nessa P.,Richmond  CA,80,9,,6/9/2016,5.0,This BJ's has a lot of great servers! I've gone here for lunch a lot and every time their service is always A1. Doesn't take crazy long to get your food  plus they check on you once or twice once you do. That's always a plus for me. Also  if you're looking for a good starter  I recommend the Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts! Not usually a fan of the things but with honey sriracha they're delish.
Dory S.,Concord  CA,0,12,,5/19/2016,2.0,The drink I ordered was weak as usual. The service here has continually been bad with snotty waiters and waitresses. Other than that the food is pretty good for what you pay for. If it's a busy night the service is very very slow.
Michael A.,Concord  CA,23,3,,6/6/2016,1.0,Service thru phone sucks  got hanged up twice trying to place an order. When i finally got my order to be picked up. No f*cks given to the take out customers. Maybe cause its take out idk. Id rather drive up to folsom to get a better service than going here in concord
William J.,Berkeley  CA,0,8,2,1/6/2017,4.0,Went there for some pizza for lunch. Good service and great food.
Carlo C.,American Canyon  CA,7,52,1,8/5/2015,4.0,Daniella was our server and she was great! She was very polite and attentive even if the food was slow to come out... As always. And although I hate the fact that BJs at this location is notorious for their slow food service  even on a Tuesday night  I would come back if I knew that Daniella was our server.Note to BJ's: HIRE MORE KITCHEN STAFF (maybe then the timing and quality of the meals will improve)
Natalie R.,Seattle  WA,260,59,265,2/23/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,This place always looks like they've had there electricity shut off. I understand dim lighting may set the ambiance  but its more of a friend/family restaurant and I don't plan on making out with my cousin. Also  the floors in the bar area are dangerously slippery. Aside from that mess  the avocado egg rolls are *ahem* ON POINT making this spot a must  especially if you live in the Concord area where your dining options are limited after 10pm.
G-man B.,Vallejo  CA,77,62,94,5/31/2014,4.0,Spoiler alert  review contains puns. I'm overdue to review BJ's. Although the name references what pleasures I received in the past  but hey it crosses my mind how about you? Anywho back to the review  this place boasts beer and fine food. As I came BJ's delivered as expected and I was pleased as usual.I do recommend the IPA beer and the Mediterranean deep dish pizza. BJ's ranks among the best restaurants in the area.
Angel G.,Concord  CA,0,5,,12/15/2016,5.0,This is my Friday night treat. The staff is great  the food is awesome  and the overall environment is just fantastic. And it's conveniently located at the mall  so once you're done stuffing your face you can go get a good walk.
Dlorean C.,Martinez  CA,1,11,1,9/24/2015,1.0,started off well. walked in and immediately had a spot to sit........ BUT. service was atrocious  chicken tortilla soup was luke warm and goopy and the pizza was really doughy. At least the Pazookie was good. Hard to mess that up.Oh  and these cups sat here for about 15 mins
Bettina D.,Concord  CA,54,66,47,5/1/2016,1.0,The worse experience I've had in my life. We were given the worse table  right under the air conditioner  which was so dusty you could've made a sweater with the dust bunnies  we requested to change tables before we even order  but we were told no  even though there were 2 tables empty next to us. The table that we requested was given to a white couple. I felt that they didn't give us that table because I am Hispanic. I felt discriminated and actually considering to sue them. We stood up and left  bad customer service in that place. My money is as green as anyone else's  so I will take my money elsewhere.
Jaydee B.,San Francisco  CA,709,163,715,2/28/2014,5.0,Ask for the Gluten-Free menu!Had the steak  baked potato  and salad (no crutons).I didn't try it but they also have a Gluten-Free beer.Nicely done BJ's!
Bonnie Z.,San Francisco  CA,330,439,606,6/22/2012,3.0,What  a 20 minute wait on a Tuesday night?! That was a little whack  but my group of girlfriends already agreed to meet here for a birthday dinner. FOOD- Portabella mushroom pizza: I love the strong woodsy taste of the mushrooms  but everything else was a bit lacking. I wish I tasted the basalmic vinegar sauce a bit more.- Mediterranean pizza: This one actually packed a punch of flavor! Kalamata olives  peppers  feta cheese...my friend got this one and I nibbled on it a bit. Will order this next time.- Stuffed mushrooms: a very delicious appetizer full of mushroomy  cheesy  garlicky goodnessDRINKSOkay the big plus of all BJs? They have a full bar! I loved the Very Berry margarita...it was almost like an alcoholic smoothie. My friend had the Pink Cadillac--I would highly recommend if you are into citrusy drinks.SERVICEStars come off for this section...we were scooted into a booth and it took over 15 minutes for someone to ask us about drinks! Another 15 mins passed before we got them. And our appetizers were served first without any utensils. How did they expect us to eat stuffed mushrooms without a fork? Waiting for the check took a bit longer too  although we requested it to be split in 4.ATMOSPHEREI'm used to the roominess of the Brentwood location. The aisles in this Concord spot is very awkward and narrow. It's hard to navigate to the back of the restaurant for bathroom without asking other patrons to scoot in. Talk about a traffic jam when another customer or waiter walks towards you in the opposite direction.CONCLUSIONDecent place to meet up with friends for drinks; food is A-OK; I would check out other eateries in the mall or by Willow Pass Road if you want a more intimate gathering.
Amanda T.,San Leandro  CA,678,310,118,2/15/2014,3.0,Maybeeee it wasn't such a good idea to come here during Valentine's day. But anywho  I did and my experience was overall just OK. We called in ahead to reserve a spot in line and when we got there  of course there many other parties there waiting to be seated as well. The hostess gave us an option of either sitting outside at the patio or waiting for about another 45 minutes for a table inside. We opted for the patio  considering that it was 8:30 already. While waiting to be seated at the patio  there was a nice server handing everyone drinks and small slices of pizza. I thought that that was very kind of them. So  we waited for about 10 minutes because there was some disorganization  but we were finally seated. Yes  its outside  but there were heaters. At some point they turned it off and my feet were freezing. Our server Melissa was very sweet  kind  and friendly. She really made up for the chaos that was going about in the patio. There was a giant group of about 20 (with lots of kids)  a group of disgruntled older folks  and a whole lot of waiters and waitresses scurrying around. I wouldn't call this the ideal romantic Valentine's atmosphere  but I guess that's just what it is!Food:Calamari: not very fresh- I've had better. It was whatever~Clam Chowder: creamy and full of clams. It hits the spot~Baby Back Ribs: delicious! Tender meat that falls off the bone.You can't really mess this one up.
Kai R.,Pleasant Hill  CA,617,478,935,2/20/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Preview: The best part of the night (and perhaps my entire life!!) was when I took the first bite of dessert... *** - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - BJ's is pretty consistent  and I like that. I know that I can order the items I normally get time & time again in order to satisfy my cravings / expectations. That said  tonight our stuffed mushrooms were lacking something  they just tasted different for some reason. The calamari was just okay. Crispy and light  but not very hot tonight; not sure how long it sat around before arriving at our table. The scampi pasta was piping hot  which is a good sign of freshness  and it tasted just as I remember  yyaaayyy. The young man got the crispy jalapeno burger  and he liked it  so that's fine by me. Now he's on a virgin pina colada kick  so he had one and enjoyed it. ***The best part of the night (and perhaps my entire life!!) was when I took the first bite of dessert... their baked beignet with fresh strawberries & vanilla  OMG OMG OMyyyGaawwsh  it was absolutely heavenly!!! The experience is going to invade my dreams tonight and possibly every night until I have another one.
Fabiana C.,Concord  CA,4,86,,10/20/2015,3.0,Every time I go there there's something. The managers are really understanding though.Last time we were 3 and all our food took a very very long time and came luke warm almost cold. So they had to reheat or make again  who knows and some we ate cold because it took long enough.
T C.,Oakland  CA,113,785,309,1/28/2015,3.0,Not nearly as on it as the other BJ's in all the land. I usually love me some BJ's so  I feel badly that I don't love this location because lovin BJ's is my thing..it truly is.Took 20 mother-fuckin minutes for anyone to approach our table and it was after we flagged a few folks down. When we had a waitress who did focus on us  she was awesome. Sadly  she started at a negative because of the pre-crap.That's just the way the pizookie crumbles!I'd probably go back since it's close enough to work to enjoy what I do happen to enjoy about BJ's (usually) but  they better get their shit together. I have an MVP card here now.. don't fuck it up!
vita k.,Oakland  CA,154,177,79,6/15/2015,4.0,I was a first timer and wished I would have signed up for the app they have ahead of time. I really enjoyed the food and air conditioning! What I had: the chicken Parmesan or Parmesan chicken really good nice size portion.the mashed potatoes were to die for and the pizzokie..... salted Carmel yum!!!! I have to try some other things on the menu
Shantel W.,El Sobrante  CA,48,16,,3/24/2016,5.0,Great strong drinks  great food  great service for a large chain. Went on a Saturday afternoon so 5 minute wait. We enjoyed ourselves...service can be iffy some servers are kinda rude ours was great....
Mel L.,Sacramento  CA,604,575,3158,10/6/2012,3.0,This place is consistently good  even if the service can sometimes be sketchy. We came here for a business lunch  and I ordered a flat bread pizza with a side salad. This was just enough food...enough to fill me up  but not too much that I was afraid I'd fall asleep at my desk. The menu is so big  there is bound to be something for everybody. Save room for a pizookie. The party size is HUGE and perfect to share with a crowd.
Denise E.,Carmichael  CA,78,2,,8/1/2016,1.0,Very disappointed in this restaraunt! We have gone there 4 times now. Each time it just keeps getting worse. We will NOT be going back to that restaraunt again!! The service is slow. The waiters(waitresess) don't keep the drink filled  always have to ask for a refill. We went there for dinner one time and ordered a meal that said it had bottomless fries when we asked our waiter for more fries he said it was only at lunch time. When it didn't say anywhere on the menu that the bottomless fries were only for lunch time. I have been to other BJ's and the service at those are 1000% better!! Today we went for lunch and my husbands fork was dirty had to ask for a clean one and they took 10 min to bring us a clean one. They weren't that busy and it took 45 min to get our lunch. My husband and I both ordered sandwiches which don't take forever to make! Today our waitress came ip to take our order and all I could smell was cigarette smoke. I don't care if you smoke but I don't want to smell that when you are taking my order and it gave me an INSTANT MIGRAINE!! I had to take Ibuprofen instantly! Had to ask her for refills on our drinks. And where our food was because they were taking way too long!!  We won't be going back to this BJ's!! VERY DISAPPOINTING!!
Jeff W.,Pleasant Hill  CA,18,18,,10/21/2016,2.0,BJ's quality of food or service would have to be way over the top to make the hassle of trying to park at this location worthwhile. Neither is. We only came because it's near our house and we had a gift certificate. The bar was nearly full with only one bartender  who wasn't in any particular hurry. Took nearly 10 minutes just to get a beer. The guy next to us had been waiting far longer for his buffalo wings. The food is standard chain cuisine  though a little pricier than most. Nothing special about the entrees. The manager would not honor our gift certificate because we did not spend enough on food. We won't be returning in any case. There are other BJ's locations that have much higher standards.
Kara L.,Fairfield  CA,18,19,18,5/21/2015,5.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant tonight. I called ahead to be put on the ""preferred waiting list"" and it worked out perfectly. I like that. Scott our waiter was very nice  kind and patient especially will my busy kids. ""and he\'s cute"". Our food was good. Kids ordered the pizza and mini burgers. They ate it all. My husband ordered the bacon cheeseburger and of course it was good. I ordered the blackened shrimp tacos....EXCELLENT! And for dessert we had a variety of the Pizookie Trio. Oooooh  so good. We didn\'t leave anything on the table. Price was good so that I can leave more than 15% tip. My second time trying BJ\'s and the rest the family the first time they tried it. We will be back on Thursdays for our family night outing. Thanks BJ!"
Gian C.,Alamo  CA,0,2,,11/11/2016,1.0,The food was decent  the service was okay  and the plates were disgusting. After two times of asking for new ones  we were still delivered with dirty plates. It was unacceptable. I had to ask 4 different times for a glass of water. It must have taken 20 minutes. I am never recommending this place  nor coming back
Run C.,Corona  CA,4,13,9,4/1/2015,3.0,BJs is like a white frat boy who just recently graduate a prestigious Ivy League without learning anything useful so he rides his father's coat tails to a cushy wall street job. He tries his best to up his game and exude quality in his work. However  his attempts usually fall short  disingenuous  and tries to salvage the attempt by putting a humorous spin on his shortcomings. I'm rather confused as to what kind of restaurant this is. Is it a place for dinner? No  its too casual. Is it a place for lunch? Sure  if two hour lunches are part of your company policy. Just like the unfortunate millennial generation  it's surviving on handouts from their middle class parents. If you've been to on BJ  you've been to them all. Almost everything down to the servers are the same at every BJ. I'm not convinced that they're an equal opportunity employer. Ok  down to business. I use to think the food is less than acceptable. However today  I thought the food was good. I ordered a rib eye steak  medium rare with soup and mash potatoes. I enjoyed the meal. It's worth another visit if I get another coupon. I recommend ordering your meal ahead of time if you don't want to wait a long time for your food. +1 star: Order was correct  and the food was tasty. +1 star: Service was fine. The waiter came by a few times to check on us and remembered all our requests. +1 star: Online ordering option for take out and dinning in. Lastly  I don't get the Pazooki. It's just a large chocolate chip cookie with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. People treat this as the best invention since sliced bread. I've had ample opportunity to try it in the past and on all occasions I've been puzzled by the attraction people have to this strange desert. It's almost pure profit for the restaurant. That's why they always push this dish. I'd rather save the money and get a nicer entree.
Jenna T.,East Bay  CA,414,610,1229,1/11/2014,4.0,Went here with family and got seated at the outside patio. It was very warm thanks to their heaters. We waited for some time and then finally had to ask if we even have a server. Our waitress came out and she was super helpful and very cheerful. She definitely added to our dining experience. The food was good but it took awhile for it to get to us. The patio wasn't spacious at all  good thing it wasn't crowded or else we would've been very uncomfortable. Either there were too many tables or the chairs took up too much space. I was literally arms length to the table next to us.
Teo D.,Martinez  CA,186,55,134,3/26/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Good thing about this place is that it has many selections to choose from. The pozookie dessert is a nice treat. If only the service was better. A little slow but they continue to try every year since I have been going here.
Michael C.,Suisun City  CA,0,2,,11/5/2016,5.0,We had an amazing time! James was our server and was very entertaining! Just to be able to talk story with him about our jobs was great! It couldn't get any better. James  thanks so much for making our night even better!
Jocelyn T.,Hercules  CA,362,794,1098,3/22/2015,3.0,First time eating at BJ's at the sunvalley location. Ordered their sliders with fries and ahi poke appetizer plate. The sliders were a good size for mini burgers. Usually when I order sliders they come in rolls but the these sliders actually came in buns but smaller then a regular bun. The plate came with a side of pickles and lettuce but had to ask for ketchup and mayo from the server. I'd skip the poki. Totally flavorless  what a waste! Service was a bit slow especially getting our checks. For some reason they turned up the A/C in the restaurant and was very uncomfortable hence I knocked off one star.
Ro O.,Pleasant Hill  CA,18,10,,12/6/2014,1.0,1- Spinach and artichoke dip was dry and not creamy and tasted bland.2- Calamari was not fully cooked because they were stuck together and my daughter said  'I'm wondering if this is really Calamari?'3- My daughter liked their fresh squeezed strawberry lemonade 4- Steamed broccoli didn't taste good  tasted stale5- The steaks were decent.6- Wedged seasoned fries was okay.7- Mashed potatoes was a little dry
Sisi H.,Concord  CA,2,32,10,8/12/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I'm done with BJs. The service never improved so I started ordering takeout. My experiences ranged from tolerable to decent and they usually got the order correct. Recently I've experienced issues not receiving my side dishes that go with my entree so I've made a point to review the items before I leave (I really should be able to trust that THEY are capable of doing this  it's part of their job). Today I had my husband pick up the order and he got home with it and sure enough: they forgot my side dish (soup). I had been really looking forward to that so I was incredibly disappointed. My husband called to speak to a manager and was put on hold for 15 minutes with no explanation. He hung up and redialled and spent another 10 until he was able to get through a manager to get us a refund on my order. Honestly the food is not worth the headache I go through with them. This was the last straw for me.
Zach R.,Lake Jackson  TX,2,7,5,12/30/2015,1.0,After waiting for 10 minutes  we were finally given a table  even though there were multiple tables open right in front of us. Once we were seated  our waiter came after another elongated period of time. We didn't receive any silverware until halfway through our dinner. The soup was lukewarm  and our dinner didn't come with the complete items as said on the menu.
Dana H.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,7,3,5/11/2016,5.0,Don't know how this doesn't have a fove star! It's so yummy and drinks are always reasonable. Staff is great
Mike P.,Vallejo  CA,1,35,54,6/19/2015,4.0,Came here for my birthday dinner with my familia and the wait wasn't too long  maybe 5-10 min. Wasn't too packed  went in around 6 o'clock for dinner time. For our appetizer we had the lettuce wraps which were surprisingly very good and also we got the poki which was on point also. I ordered the bison burger and it tasted okay. I ordered it medium so it could be nice and juicy but it came out a little dry and the bread was soggy. Overall the experience was good but I would find a better main course next time.
Niraj L.,Sunnyvale  CA,2,7,4,6/13/2015,1.0,Good drinks and Appetizers. The worst deep dish pizza ever. It had more bread than the bread bowl and the toppings were not properly cooked. The manager were good enough to help. Best part was the yummy Ghirardelli Pizookie
Leah Anne B.,Oakland  CA,86,91,81,4/2/2015,3.0,"My boyfriend and I recently visited for dinner. Service was kind of slow for a weeknight. They forgot to give napkins  utensils  extra plates and even the lemon in the ""water with lemon"" that I asked for. I wasn\'t really too satisfied about that. Our server was really nice though. And food was okay. Their food is good but nothing really special about it. It\'s an okay restaurant. Tip though  be a BJ\'s Premier Rewards member  it\'s free. They send you coupons and you earn points every time you use your rewards card."
Tiff W.,San Francisco  CA,321,1286,143,11/23/2015,2.0,Very disappointed at the bar service  super slow and it took a while to flag someone down  she was just in front of me as well. Annoyed by the whole experience.
Jack L.,Milpitas  CA,541,56,17,11/25/2015,4.0,Hailey B. Is by far the best server I have ever encountered at Bj's and I am a frequent diner. Her customer service is phenomenal. She is friendly  personable and very attentive to us. Thank you Hailey for making our thanksgiving eve dinner a memorable one!!
Mike D.,Benicia  CA,764,96,208,11/21/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I swore I wouldn't come back after the last time I was here and I was hesitant to come here tonight  but they redeemed themselves.They have a broad menu and it really makes a difference in what you order. Some things they make better than others.They have some new items on their menu. One new item I tried was the deep fried artichokes as an appetizer. These were great.For the main part of the meal  I ordered the BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza and it was good too.I like the dark wood interior  the seats are comfortable  and I like the televised sports on multiple TVs.The experience was much improved over the last time I visited and I will likely come back.
Shane C.,San Ramon  CA,65,175,38,1/9/2016,4.0,I had tried another BJs and was very dissapointed so I had avoided going to another one for fear of the same bad experience. It was Christmas eve and my wife had heard the pizza here was great so we decided to give it a try. We sat at the bar and found out it was happy hour. Great drink prices and discounts on the small deep dish pizzas. We both ordered our own and they were lights out good. I had pinapple jalapeo and pepperoni and I polished it off. This is a happy hour we will revisit. The lesson here is do not judge an entire chain by one bad restaurant.
Patrick M.,Concord  CA,0,23,,2/19/2016,4.0,A favorite among my group. Takes awhile to be seated  but its pretty busy usually. Food is decent  nothing special  but the service here is great and the pizookies are good. Definitely would recommend
Bonnie S.,San Francisco  CA,441,215,216,12/23/2013,2.0,Never understood the long waits for food that was just ok. The only saving grace is the red velvet pizookie  coming from someone that doesn't even care for red velvet all that much.And note to the wait staff: if our waters are empty and you make us feel unwanted and uncomfortable  YOU'RE NOT DOING YOUR JOB.We still tipped over 18% though. You're welcome.
Abby L.,Pinole  CA,2,9,2,9/4/2016,4.0,"I really do enjoy BJS but the one problem I had his time was with the hostess at the front who referred to my friends and I as ""these ones"". Maybe an honest mistake but very unprofessional and rude."
Mona Linda R.,Vacaville  CA,0,5,1,9/16/2015,2.0,"Service was crap. Unprofessional server. Literally told my husband what he ordered wasn\'t a good choice and it gets sent back a lot. Took the order wrong and then when we brought it up she said ""oh  shit!"". This place has gone down hill!"
Gwen H.,Moraga  CA,0,5,4,3/25/2016,3.0,Decent prices  nice atmosphere and really great service. Numerous food and drink selections (maybe a bit too many items to choose from). Food was decent  but not rave-worthy. It's your basic american fare.
Monica G.,Martinez  CA,0,3,,3/19/2016,5.0,What can I say about BJ's? This has been my go to place for practically every week for either lunch or dinner. The staff's are always so kind and helpful  they always have the biggest smile on their faces. Which is always a great quality to have   as well as one of the manager( the younger one) is always so genuine and helpful. While  the older manager( with all due respect)  was extremely rude. However  one guy doesn't have to ruin it for everyone  right ? Also  the take out service is always so quick and helpful!!!! I recommend this place highly.
Janine G.,Concord  CA,0,4,,6/22/2015,5.0,I normally don't review a restaurant were the food is so mediocre  but our server was so good  it made up for the blandness of everything else. I think his name was Kenan  we all asked for his name wanted to be sure we are seated in his area whenever we go and since my family likes to come here  I am forced to put up with the lack of good food  we were there for Fathers Day! Once again Kenan saved it. Attentive  and professional and seemed like it was important to him that we had a good experience.
M S.,Hercules  CA,1,23,,2/19/2016,1.0,How is it possible to wait 15 minutes for a table  another 15 for a waiter  then another 10 to get water in a practically empty restaurant? After our third wait we decided to leavw. We asked to speak to a manager on our way out  and after 10 minutes of waiting (again...) we finally left. If you have time to spare  I'm sure this would be a great place but the service was slower than molasses.
Tony H.,San Ramon  CA,59,8,,3/24/2015,1.0,Went to BJ's tonight for dinner with a friend we ordered Barbecue bchicken salad waited 20 minutes for my salad to Arrive there is no chicken in my chicken salad Service was very badThe manager did not care or did not offer anything at all so we lift very poor experience The place is a joke
Diana T.,San Francisco  CA,16,102,8,11/16/2014,2.0,"Not a good option. First off  the food took FOREVER to get there and the place wasn\'t even packed. The servers were nice enough. The problem is with whoever is cooking the food. We ordered beer  the stuffed mushrooms (which were decent and the only reason this gets 2 stars!)  a deep dish pizza (TINY!!! tasted ok I guess...but it\'s really small!) and scallops dish (which I sent back immediately) and replaced that with the bison burger. Whatever the scallops were drenched in smelled really bad. The asparagus was cooked all wrong so you couldn\'t really eat it. Bison burger - I came out smelling like nothing but onions. Too much onions. They should\'ve grilled the onions at least  it would\'ve tasted SO much better. I felt like I just wanted to go back there and tell them how to cook it. They also included ""cole slaw"" - that was not cole slaw -_-..... it was some wierd salad thing (without the right sauce) made out of parsley  carrots and probably more onions. I brushed my teeth twice - still taste onions :( This place is crap."
John P.,Berkeley  CA,19,198,5,1/7/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I have to drop them from 5 stars to 3. They served me what they said was a deep dish pizza.... It was abysmal is what it was. They still get 3 stars because I will come back and stick to the thin dish but wow. When you are there google deep dish pizza images and compare them to what you get. It's not the same. Their deep dish is more like a thick crust pizza. They increase the pie pan size but keep the amount of ingredients the same.
Tarah M.,San Jose  CA,114,51,6,7/25/2014,1.0,I'd leave negative stars if I could!! Only positive is we didn't have to wait for a table...probably because people know better! 10 minutes to get a glass of water. 20 minutes to get a cup of coffee. $12.95 for what they call a Cobb salad consisting of a mediocre bowl of shredded romain lettuce  mystery cubed meat they call turkey  sprinkled with bacon & feta...When said salad was complained about and a manager was sent over  both manager & waitress agreed the salad appeared subpar when talking cost/quality ratio - yet the manager offers to take our credit card for payment (without us seeing the bill) and runs it for full charge of all disappointing costs!! My advice to BJs...quit spending so much money on your extravagant building aesthetics and allocate it to proper employee training and education about the importance of customer service! Rant over. Mic drop. OUT!
Val F.,Rodeo  CA,28,5,3,10/26/2015,1.0,My husband and I dropped in for breakfast and were so disappointed. The food  especially the avocado  appeared old. It looked as though someone had taken a bite out of my eggs. My husband had two pieces of bacon; one burnt and one raw. The manager came and took our plates away without a word. The server asked us to come back for dinner...it would be better. Really?
Terri N.,Concord  CA,533,725,2872,3/20/2013,4.0,"BJ\'s has been open at Sun Valley Mall for a few years now  and I swear they have been packed ever since. Definitely the most popular restaurant at this mall - if you\'re dining at peak times  be prepared to wait! But every bite will be well worth it. BJs is a conundrum - a gigantic menu but I\'ve only sampled a handful of items because what I\'ve had is so darn good I can\'t wait to go back and order it again! Nevertheless  some highlights:GRILLED CHICKEN CLUB - Delicious decadent sandwich  put over the top by being served on what sure do taste like garlic bread. My first and still favorite! AHI POKE - Presented as an app but I have made this my entre plenty of times. Always fresh and delicious!CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP - Epic and delicious  made super special by their unique presentation. You receive a large soup bowl filled with the chicken  chips  cheese and other goodies  and the soup is poured by your server over all the goodies from a little kettle. It really preserves the integrity of the chips and cheese  nothing arrives soggy. I was very impressed. BLACK & BLEU FLATBREAD - A really good portion of yummy steak and blue cheese in pizza form - brilliant! PORTABELLO/BALSAMIC DEEP DISH PIZZA- Doesn\'t seem to be on the menu anymore which is a shame  because this was EPIC. Sitting at the bar with a glass of good wine  chatting with good company and munching on this pizza - life doesn\'t get much better. BRING IT BACK!! ENLIGHTENED HAWAIIAN MAHI-MAHI - So tasty! While you definitely know you\'re eating a healthy dish compared with all the French fries and cheese that will be all around you  there is no shortage of yum on this plate of food. I loved it!BBQ BISON BURGER (from the Enlightened menu) - Wonderful! Delicious perfectly seasoned and well cooked burger patty  topped with pico de gallo  roasted pepper  with a side of slaw. Tastier than their regular burgers  seriously!And of course  Pizookies! The original  gluten-free and triple chocolate are all SO good  super indulgent and enough for I\'d say 4 people to have a good couple bites. Seriously one of the best dessert options in any restaurant I could name in the area. So thank you BJ\'s for great meals  and more to come!PS - There is an excellent photo op in the parking lot  signs for their curbside takeout that read ""Parking for BJs only"". Yep I went there. ;)"
Joshua P.,San Francisco  CA,0,1,,3/7/2016,5.0,The service was great  the clam chowder bowl was a amazing   way better than Boudin.Delicious tons of clams and they made the top into garlic bread and ran the whole thing through the oven sooo good.
Carina L.,Merrill  OR,0,2,,3/3/2016,5.0,Such great service! I love it here. Definitely recommend. Waitress was very friendly  and offered recommendations from the menu  and have great overall knowledge about what the items on the menu looked liked  and how popular they were.
Jose R.,Pittsburg  CA,0,6,1,8/31/2016,1.0,We came ad a group of 7 couple....our server was nice she took our drink order and right after took our food order. We waited about 30 minutes to get our drinks and hoestly I think it was because I asked a different waiter to bring drinks because we had been waiting for a while.
Kassi O.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,25,32,1/18/2016,1.0,They just gave themselves up. I used to like coming here. But lately they have been very disappointing. The food and drinks are terrible  service was slow. When we told the waitress the food was not that good she didn't give a f. Won't be back again.
Anna M.,Livermore  CA,38,74,91,9/10/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Ooops! Wrong location. For my prior review; that was for the Livermore/Dublin location. Leaving the average number of stars here so it won't effect rating.
Trang T.,San Francisco Bay Area  CA,60,69,52,1/30/2015,3.0,I've been to the BJ's in the Sacramento area and they seemed like a totally different restaurant. I only come to BJ's whenever my friends have a last minute plan to come together to get some drinks and eats. Although their entrees are average and seemingly generic to me  I think their fort is their appetizer selection. I really like their artichoke and spinach dip  and their fried calamari is really crispy and good.They have a good selection of drinks  but that's to be expected from a restaurant that specializes in homemade brews. My current favorite is the Gulden Draak Ale. As for the quality of service  expect some delays. Not sure what the reason is  but I always end up waiting a long time for my food. During the later hours  you go in and seat yourself  and it costs an arm or a leg to get the attention of a server. I don't think the atmosphere would be appropriate for a family with small children  especially because the frequent goers range from rambunctious high school students to stressed out white collared workers who wanna let loose at the bar.
Olga L.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,2,,8/6/2016,2.0,I go to bj's in Concord  California. Food is good  but they have an ongoing problem washing the dishes. I always see some lipstick on the glass or sugar at the rim of the tea cup. So  if you are not afraid of diarrhea  you should be fine .
L T.,San Pablo  CA,151,59,547,11/5/2013,4.0,"Celebrated a friends birthday here couple days ago. I forgot how busy this place gets so make reservations before hand. This place is usually pretty busy no matter what day it is & the wait can be anywhere from 10-45 minutes depending on the day and how big the party. For us  we only had 4 people and waited 40 minutes. Good thing there was a bar and outdoor public seatings. Lol. The pizza is one of the best choices to get. I love the calamari appetizer. For the drinks I loved the ""A drink like that"" ( Must try ) & the ultimate long islands. But just about any drink is delicious so you wont be disappointed. The servers are pretty amazing depending on the days. Free pizookie on your birthday !"
Jim C.,Danville  CA,19,34,4,12/20/2015,3.0,I have eaten here for both lunch and dinner on multiple occasions. Poor service and slow delivery of food. On several occasions  we ended up eating at the bar after waiting in excess of the time the hostess gave us for a table.
Caio M.,Corte Madera  CA,0,5,,8/20/2016,4.0,The place is ok. Been there feel times and like the food  customer service can be a problem sometimes.
Ron L.,Concord  CA,393,709,439,12/14/2012,2.0,"A very solid two-star place.I actually had little interest in going here. On the outside  it seems like a bar-and-nightclub experience  not a place to take little ones. Then Big Joe  a friend of mine from house church who\'s also a Yelper  told me ""Nah  nothing bad about it. I take my kids there a lot."" When my daughter won a coupon for BJ\'s at her school  there was our reason to go.Well  Big Joe was right. It\'s more of a restaurant. Sorta loud  like a place were you go hang out with the boys after work  or a girls night out with margaritas. Not bad for kids  and they have a kids menu. Similar to what I\'ve heard about Hooters  this atmosphere is better than it looks.It looks like the bar takes up the entire long side of the wall; I could be wrong on that. But the drinks are stacked in shelves all the way to near the top of the high ceiling. And the first five pages of the menu are their drinks. Yep  they take their beer seriously  not too good for a non-alky like me.Food looks kinda uppercrusty  with prices to match. Both my wife and I had chicken-fried steak  came with lots of vegetables; I wasn\'t impressed. We had to wait a long time to be seated  so I guess people come here for some reason other than the food. Then the bill came - and the dollars-off coupon wasn\'t included!I\'ll sum it up by quoting my hunny: ""Well  I always wanted to try BJ\'s once. Once is enough!"""

Sliders were worst ever with soggy undercooked meat and stale buns  My dog might even reject them! Macaroni was dry and tasteless with little cheese. $20. for this Crap! Please!!
w m.,Pinole  CA,0,39,4,10/1/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Went back to BJ 's today for first time in weeks. The service was extremely good and our waiter Antonio Mora was great. He anticipated our needs/ brought the food in a timely manner and seemed to serve all tables quickly and efficiently. This was quite impressive as the restaurant was packed. Food as usual was good and prices fair. Will be going back again soon.
Adyson S.,Grand Lake  Oakland  CA,58,74,62,11/12/2014,1.0,After my most recent encounter with this place  I will NEVER go back. I get that all big chain restaurants like this one are not healthy in the least bit  but when you don't really have ANY vegetarian options besides salad and fried cheese  i'll pass. I went for brunch with a co-work and ordered an omelette that came with an addition of HAIR. GROSS  sent it back waited 45 minutes to have another dish come that has MEAT. When I stated that I just wanted the same thing. The server kept bringing the wrong beverages to our table (I only asked for water  and got soda?!?) WASTE of money  and I would like to live rather than have a heart attack from too much sodium.
Loren J.,San Pablo  CA,11,9,55,5/25/2015,2.0,"Wow let me just start off saying....WOW!!! So I come here with my mom and my brother after a long day of shopping and getting new phones (which was stressful enough!!!!) to sit down and enjoy a meal cause yknow what\'s better than spending quality time with your family??? Hmmm well first of all we enter the restaurant and tell the person in the front our name so they could call it when the table was ready. Ten to fricking fifteen minutes pass and all we see is ppl who came in after us getting seated so we were like ummmm are you serious?? Is this a racial thing?? Probably. So the same front person that took are name asks ""are you guys ready to check in?"" Me being a hardcore yelper took it the wrong way so I didn\'t really understand what that meant but my mom was like UM ya we already checked us in. IT WAS THE SAME GIRL THAT CHECKED US IN BUT SHE SOMEHOW ""FORGOT"" ABOUT US. I am putting quotes bc this is probably has something to do with race. The fact that that was how our lunch started showed a lot. Okay so after we order our food and all that stuff we get our calamari  salad  and flatbread while I got my Cali chicken sandwich. What disappointed me the most was the calamari bc I know what good calamari is and that was NOT good calamari. It was cold and not crunchy at all which really disappointed me bc I love calamari so much. Another thing was their water!! It tasted weird and had a slightly odd after taste to it but maybe it was just the drought effecting our water but who knows! Anyway we were so disappointed we didn\'t even want dessert. I am sorry BJs but maybe you should change your name to ""restaurant with racist service and terrible calamari"""
Angela H.,Richmond  CA,52,725,180,8/1/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,So I've been here a number of times now  and their service has been a lot slower... once I came with a large group  and we happened to have a waitress in training  so she was shadowing another server. They BOTH wrote down our orders  but still it was wrong for three people  and everything took over an hour before it came out. Another time was during their late night happy hour  after 10pm  so the restaurant is nearly empty  but service was slow again  too...Food  however  is good. And their happy hour food specials are worth it.
Terry T.,Hercules  CA,304,1288,384,11/15/2012,4.0,We had another opportunity to have a Veterans Day meal because the legal holiday fell on Monday  and BJ's offered lunch on both days. After I read both Eric B. and Janice T. reviews I was sure I we would enjoy lunch and then I read Ivy R. review for the root beer for adults and I knew this was the only place I wanted to go.It was busy at lunch. I think they might have a stroller brigade that lunches here as there were at least six strollers parked inside near the door. I found the interior of the restaurant a bit too dark for a midday meal. We ate outside and the heaters made it pleasant.S had salmon on pilaf and a cup of clam chowder and I had the glazed chicken teriyaki. The food was good and I liked the taste of the clam chowder a lot. I also had the Irish Root Beer for adults. This tasty drink is made with Jameson Irish Whiskey  Baileys Irish Cream  Butterscotch Schnapps and BJ's Handcrafted Root Beer and served in a frosty glass. I really liked it a lot and I am sure happy I read Ivy's review and did not order something else
Janelle A.,San Francisco Bay Area  CA,11,9,4,8/22/2014,1.0,If I could give this place 0 stars I would or even negative stars. And it's weird to say that because I'm honestly very understanding and patient when it comes to going out to eat  and I understand how difficult it is to be a waitress so I don't mind patiently waiting to order. The first horrible service I received is when my boyfriend and I decided to eat here. We were seated promptly but then everything after was just bad. Not only were everyone else getting served around us it took us probably 15 min to get served water and so we ordered right away. Our waiter is no where to be found  and I keep reassuring my boyfriend that they are probably busy and try to get our minds off the wait. But after hunting down our waiter about our food  he tells us it should be out in a bit. AND 35-40 min later NOTHING. No water refill or anything  we give them another 5 min. And still nothing  so we finally walked out. I decided to go again w my family after we had a baseball game to give them the benefit of the doubt. And while our waiter was a young guy who communicated very well w my family. I just don't understand how LITERALLY every member of my family gets their food and of course my small deep dish pizza is no where to be found. My family ordered 2 other pizzas which already arrived  and the guy didn't even check to make sure we had all out food. We had to tell him about our food and he said he'll check on it. Then another 15 min later nothing so I tell him to cancel it. I am soooo pissed about this place I can't even explain. I tell everyone I know not to go here because of how horrible it is and that's saying a lot for me. Stay away from the concord bjs   but if you want great food and great service fr bjs go to Vacaville and you WILL not be disappointed.
Marissa D.,Fairfield  CA,0,8,,1/13/2016,4.0,"I went to a late lunch at BJ\'S today and had such a wonderful experience. 5 stars on the service. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. ""CRAIG M"". He was such a joy to have as a waiter! 4 stars only because their deep dish pizzas lack the pizza sauce itself."
Jess S.,Mountain View  CA,26,50,7,10/28/2014,3.0,First of all  I think the food here is a pretty decent  like 3.5 or 4 stars depending on what you order. Their avocado roll appetizers are super tasty  and personally  I thought my order of cajun chicken pasta was pretty tasty. My grandma though  ordered a cheeseburger and it was really really sad looking. It was also missing the cheese and the spread that they asked her if she wanted to put on. Oops. But the real kicker was that they had ads for this really sweet looking pumpkin fireball drink on the table  but the waitress didn't tell us they didn't actually have pumpkin beer (even though it was a Thursday) until we tried to actually order it. It was like omg what  why couldn't you tell us this sooner. Thank goodness they have other tasty beers  but it was still kind of disappointing. Service overall was just kind of really blah; not bad enough to make me never want to come again  but definitely not good. You could probably get better service at Red Robin's  but the non-burger foods at BJ's (and the beer) are definitely better (but more expensive).
Melody C.,Concord  CA,0,14,,7/6/2014,5.0,BJ's always has great food and good atmosphere. A great place to start the night with there signature beers or have brunch in the morning.
Semon J.,Arlington  VA,2,17,138,6/14/2014,5.0,Best dinner of my life We here for my birthday in June 2014. It was amazing. The service was very nice  the food was wonderful YOU GOT TO TRY PIZOOKIE!!!absolutely great
Rizzy B.,San Pablo  CA,0,44,1,4/8/2016,4.0,"Two words  well - four words  actually. STUFFED MUSHROOMS - FRIED CALAMARI. Both of these appetizers are always my faves and 100% winners. They give great portions so it\'s definitely feasible to enjoy a meal of appetizers alone and still feel satisfied. I used to love  love  love  the seared Ahi Tuna Salad  but it seems as if they changed the recipe. It used to come with full slices of Tuna  but lately  the tuna has been chopped in smaller portions. The sauce used to also have more of a ""kick"" to it which went very well with the wasabi on the side. With their new recipe  this salad went from ""WOW"" to just ""ok."" You also can\'t go wrong with the Long Island Iced Tea (top shelf only please) and they fried  naked chicken wings with the buffalo sauce drizzled on the top. The waiters are also extremely friendly as well as the hosts. They can get pretty busy during weekends  but during the week  there is hardly ever a wait."
Naomi S.,Pittsburg  CA,6,37,19,6/8/2015,3.0,Like everyone in the area  I've been to BJs numerous times because I like their food and ambiance. Because of this  I decided to throw my fianc a surprise birthday on Sunday  June 7 since their outdoor patio would accommodate our 40+ headcount. Let's get to it:Positives:-Manager Michael Gatto took the time to speak with me over the phone and go over my selected family-style menu for the day. He even offered to provide our 7 kids complimentary cheese pizzas! So nice!-Tables were set up and ready for our guests before our 1:30PM reservation time so no one had to wait to be seated!-Michael Gatto came out to the patio to introduce himself to me since we had spoke and emailed over the phone. He asked how everything was going and wanted to greet my fianc. I thought that was great customer service and I appreciated that he wanted to meet his guests!-Our servers Ceci and Dijonae carried themselves well. They didn't look stressed out handling such a large party and they always had a friendly smile on their face. I enjoyed talking to them very much!Negatives-The planning phase was terrible due to lack of communication. I emailed BJs on two separate occasions regarding their menu but did not receive a response. I also called BJs on two other occasions and left my name and number but received no call back. It wasn't until my third email that Michael Gatto got back to me (I should note that Michael was not the initial manager who helped me. Alyssa Alvarado was the dining manager who helped me book my reservation and sent me an email with the menu. I never heard back from Alyssa after I tried to contact via email and phone).-The entrees I ordered were suppose to be prepared on four different plates so that they could be placed on four separate tables to be shared family style. Instead  the entrees were prepared on one or two plates which required my guests to stand up and pass the plate to another table. Very inconvenient on a hot June day outside where space was limited. After the first few times this happened it was later corrected for subsequent entrees.-Since I had sent Michael Gatto the exact entree and quantity of each dish I wanted via email  and since he confirmed everything  I didn't expect there to be any hiccups with my receipt so I signed and left. I was wrong. When I got home I reviewed the receipt and noticed that I was actually charged for the cheese pizzas that were suppose to be complimentary. I also noticed that the quantities of each dish I ordered were incorrect (they were less). It was such a busy day that I'm not even sure if my guests just didn't receive all the food I had ordered  or if I received a discount. I doubt it's the latter because I saw nothing complimentary on my receipt. Although Michael Gatto was helpful  and our servers Ceci and Dijionae were great  my overall experience with planning a large party at BJs is three stars. There were just too many problems during the planning phase and the day-of the celebration for me to overlook. I still think BJs is a good restaurant and I would return  but I would never plan a large celebration here again.
Rosie H.,Vallejo  CA,51,56,1,10/6/2015,5.0,My husband and I love .BJ's! We go for the craft beers  great service  and fabulous food. Happy hour rocks too.
Miss C.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,58,,1/17/2015,1.0,"Have been to other BJ\'s locations with great experiences. Went to this one tonight  the margarita was WEAK and overly sweet  the potato skins were chalky & gross  they literally disintegrated into a pile if powder when you cut into them. Waiter left us for long periods of time. Asked other waitstaff for help  they said they were ""looking for him too"". Nice.Screwed up both of our orders...(2 cheeseburgers  one with fries  one with salad)  and they both came out wrong (and brought out by a different waiter). Pretty simple...asked for one plain  and one with onion strings. The plain one showed up with all toppings  and they put the onions for the other one on top of the caesar salad instead of the burger (WTF?!) Had to send back. Then we had some other guy come over  I assume the manager but he didn\'t introduce himself  asking us what was wrong with the order. We told him  he was apologetic  but then just walked away without comment.Then we were left again another 15 minutes. Empty drinks & dirty appetizer plates just sat on the table. Flagged down yet another waitress  asked to order 2 more drinks  she said she\'d order for us. Original waiter came by  with attitude asked what was wrong with our order  then just walked away. Another 15 minutes  no drinks. Yet ANOTHER waitress finally brought our corrected food. We asked to cancel the drink order & get boxes to take out food home. Funny  she said the 2nd drink order was NEVER PLACED. Then original waiter returned & left the check. I noticed they refunded the price of one meal they messed up  but nobody told us they were doing that. No tip. And we\'ll never go back. They have a HUGE staff working  and they are completely disorganized & few of them care about service. Bummer."
Rodrigo M.,Richmond  CA,0,1,2,12/24/2015,5.0,Went there for the first time with my girlfriend since I've gone to the mall. It had a nice environment and was not at all full which was great because our wait time to a table was about 6-7 min. We were greeted by our server Joseph D. He prepared me an awesome Bombay Saphire Straight with a lemon twist  although there wasn't a crystallization in the glass it was an amazing drink. We then ordered our BJ favorite appetizers. (Avocado rolls  and fried calamari). It took a while for us to decide our food since we were to busy enjoying our apps lol. But we ended up ordering an Asian chopped salad and their Grilled Barbacoa Chicken over brown Rice  black beans  and feta cheese. The chicken was good but there red sauce was a little cold and the dish felt like it needed a crunch. Overall the entrees were Good. But then he offered to get us dessert (on him) which overall topped of the whole experience. Our server Joseph was very attentive and came to our table several times for feedback and short convo. Also refilled our drinks and was very polite. We want to say that It was an outstanding dinner and the service was great. ! Thanks Jo ! Thnx BJ's! Happy Holidays.
Tone S.,Vallejo  CA,0,6,,12/23/2015,1.0,Put it this way  if you want to have a good ol' stomach ache then this is the place to be ! To be fair the service isn't bad but the food isn't good . This is the second time me and my lady have came home with a bad stomach . Not to mention we ordered the pizza and it was still doughy. If Wendy's and round table fooked you would get BJ's. Ol sucka butts.
Kaye S.,San Francisco  CA,33,49,26,10/11/2014,4.0,Server was extremely busy since it's Saturday but managed to check in on us in a timely manner. She was fast with our refills and didn't interrupt my boyfriend and me when she saw that we were engaged in our conversation. We ordered the Scampi Pasta (which was slightly bland this time)  the Buffalo Chicken pizza (mediocre)  and the traditional wings (best out of the 3). Servers are a hit or miss here but ALISHA was a speedy server and had very good service (thank you!).
Marck N.,Emeryville  CA,137,1037,58,12/7/2012,2.0,It's a chain restaurant. My experience here for lunch was average. I've had better service at another location. Our server was nice  but not attentive.  When my party's food came out  dishes were mixed up and the soups ordered were cold. They corrected it  but considering it wasn't busy  there really wasn't any excuse for the mishaps.  Maybe dinner service would be better  but I don't think I will be visiting this location soon.
Chad P.,Crockett  CA,4,131,37,7/4/2013,2.0,Not going to complain about the slow service because it was 4th of July and they may have been understaffed. Above all though this is a beer place and they need to get this right because I am a beer guy and I went here for beer. I am like Benjamin Blue of Forrest Gump fame except I go on and on about beer rather than shrimp.I was happy to see they had a tap of Pilsner Urquell. I ordered a pitcher  but when it came 35 minutes later it was a pitcher of IPA. Not a bad IPA but not what I was looking forward to.I told the waitress a mistake had been made.Twenty minutes later she brought me another pitcher of the same IPA. I told her the wrong keg must be connected to the Pilsner Urquell tap and settled down to drink a pitcher of IPA.A second waitress/assistant manager came by and asked me about it. I told her the kegs were likely crossed and she said she would check on it.Thirty minutes we flagged the second waitress down to ask about the kegs. She reports the bartender reported to her that the kegs were connected correctly.Here I sit with the aftertaste of American hops on my tongue and the feeling of grief that a perfectly good second pitcher of IPA or possibly a strong Pale Ale had to be poured down the drain. Also the the belief that the draft lines were never checked.Food was not bad but Cobb salad is not Cobb salad without blue cheese.July 13 updateThe real Pilsner Urquell can be enjoyed at DJ's Bistro in Concord.
Nikki Z.,El Sobrante  CA,4,55,,6/26/2014,4.0,This review is for the Pizookies. Yummmmo! I haven't been here since November 2013 but recently I came and they have new flavors! Salted Caramel and Peanut Butter - Delicious!!!I will definitely be back for these.
Jason D.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,6,1,2/11/2015,1.0,I've been to this restaurant 4 times and have NEVER once had a good experience. I've been too several other locations such as Redmond WA. This place should be on undercover boss....The manager is a jerk. He is rude to his staff  he does nothing to help and makes poor decisions when given opportunity to do the right thing.I went here Sunday night 2/8/15 with my friend. He ordered a small pizza and I ordered pulled pork sandwich and each of us had a beer.My food came out with an empty sauce cup and no fries. Waitress takes my food back for 15+ minutes  says the manager cussed her and the f-ing cook. By the time the food comes back out  my friend had already finished his meal. She said the manager was sorry about it.... but then they charged me 100%He should have walked out to deliver the food talked to me himself and either fix the bill or offer us a free beer or some other way.I really felt horrible for the poor waitress who was embarrassedBoth myself and my buddy will NEVER go back
Eduardo D.,Modesto  CA,0,1,,12/16/2015,1.0,Worst Thursday night ever. I ordered two shots of patron. The glasses were dirty as hell. Also instead of salt they give me sugar! On top of that my server kayla gave me a terrible service . She never checked on me. I ordered pizza and they brought it out to me. Kayla forgot to give me goddamn cheese and pepper. What a terrible service. All i wanted was a good night but my server messed it all up. I pray for all out there. DO NOT GET KAYLA AS SERVER.
Krissy L.,Bronx  NY,243,203,78,4/2/2013,4.0,Definitely my go to place. On normal days you get seated almost immediately. Always a good idea to make reservations though since the place tends to be packed in the evenings - like 15-30 minute wait. Ambiance is as you'd expect from a BJ's- it's like any typical american restaurant chain. It's pretty clean and it's moderately noisy here. I never had issues with the service. In fact it's always been pretty great for me. The waiters/waitresses I've had were always nice and helpful. They always have something good to recommend when we ask and even give out free samples of some beers to try out if you're unsure of your choices. The highlight is definitely the food and beer- always great here as in any other BJ's so you know it wont be disappointing to eat here.Overall  great place to head to when you want a beer. Best to make reservations if you plan on coming in on the evening but the wait isn't too bad on non-game nights.
Sal M.,Anaheim  CA,252,190,230,8/13/2014,3.0,Well  at least they have a happy hour with $4 beers (Haywire Hefeweisen!) and discounted appetizers and mini pizzas  and their pastas with chicken or shrimp aren't bad either.But they need to wash the lettuce a bit more on the salads  and take out the wilted stuff. Mine had dirt  was it just harvested yesterday? Service is a mixed bag especially on the busy nights  which is why I mainly come at lunch or happy hour  to avoid the two-hour dining experience. Most of the main menu  except for the light bites is $2-3 more than it should be. Although I lean toward Gordon Biersch or Pyramid for my chain restaurant beer  there are just enough reasons to come back here.
Brian W.,Benicia  CA,131,15,24,12/24/2014,5.0,Eric or server was amazing! Memorized our entire order and it was quick and accurate. Great food too! I called ahead and spoke with the manager for a last minute Christmas Eve birthday dinner reservation and he hooked us up. We were welcomed and seated within 10 minutes. Drinks and appetizers served in 15 minutes. Good food and nice Gluten Free Options.
Jen O.,Martinez  CA,63,23,15,9/24/2015,1.0,Worse service ever tonight never came to fill our drinks...Took an hour for my deep dish pizza to come out.When I took a bite it was undercooked very doughy. The manager comped the pizza but since it was the special I eneded paying for the two salads and pizookie which ended up being $25 anyways! They should have not charged me for the 2 salads. I would have been happy paying $15. Ive been coming to Bjs and this has been the worse its ever been.
Anan K.,Portland  OR,9,50,11,10/13/2015,3.0,Came here to get some dinner and pizookies but my steak was a little disappointing. It was too cooked when I asked for medium rare. The Pizookies however is delicious. Recommend the triple chocolate.
C P.,Pinole  CA,0,6,,11/8/2015,5.0,I love it here! I came here last night with my husband and we just wanted to order like appetizers or something but our sever helped us out and helped us decide. Cristian was a server and he did a great job. He was so friendly and very calm and quick. He brought us out samples of the handcrafted soda beverages that BJs makes cause my husband ordered one and was curious what the others taste like. Was great! Definitely coming back.
Cindy C.,Suisun City  CA,0,17,24,11/5/2015,2.0,Tonight was such a disaster. Food never consistent. Sometimes food IS BOMB. but tonight  was just nono. Food was drenched in oil  seriously... it was gross . Heart attack. And my chili was not chili  it was basically nacho cheese ): the lady taking my togo  even spelled my name totally different ( I even told her how to spell it ) jeez  it's going to be a minute before I come here. So disappointed .
Sandy L.,Pittsburg  CA,163,32,57,8/11/2015,2.0,I don't why I still go back to this place.. Maybe I try to trick my mind into liking their food.But I had a weird eating out day today.Randomly went into BJs because I was craving Pizookies.We ordered take out for the Pizookie Trips and let me tell you this- the Pizookies were soooo small and poor looking! They were half the size in comparison to the bowl they were put in.They had the sauces in different containers and ice cream scoops in another. I'm sure it would've been better dining in  but please BJs work on your take out! Also ordered the California Club flatbread appetizer. It was alright  some parts weren't even crispy and too skimpy on the avocado; that's the best part!My bill came out to be regular priced and I came around happy hour time  wondering why I didn't get the discount. I tried calling someone but no one would give me their attention.. -.- Overall I forgot about it and still managed to give them a hefty tip (I'm too nice). looolzzz. It's an alright place but I wouldn't bother coming here unless I'm coming for the Pizookie AND its dining in. Other than that  I'll pass.
Christina G.,Walnut Creek  CA,131,444,2387,3/6/2013,3.0,I came here with five of my coworkers for my birthday  and the food was just ok. I've had the enlightened mahi mahi before and it was amazing  but this time  the fish was overcooked. My coworker's teriyaki shrimp was drenched in sauce (and a considerably smaller portion than another coworker's salmon). I guess the food can be hit or miss  because the wings I had at happy hour the week before were tender and crispy and cooked to perfection. Their orange cream soda and pear cider have strange  astringent-like tastes to them. The cream soda  however was delicious. My pizookie was delicious though! That never misses!!
Brian H.,Benicia  CA,63,93,28,9/12/2014,2.0,They have lost their luster . It's rush rush rush . Took a while to be seated yet there were 12 open tables in the restaurant. Service : she was polite but in a rush then we didn't see her much after taking the order Food: pizza was not completely cooked   sausage was squishy like it was defrosted and was wet . The Parmesan cheese on her chicken wasn't cooked all the way and the green beans were like they just took them from the microwave . Appetizer : cold and crunchy .. I had the mushrooms . Strange I know . Drinks: she had the peach sangria which was very good . My iced tea was 99% ice and 1% tea. I asked for light ice . So in a nut shell . Lost its luster and we will be taking a break for a while . Looking elsewhere I guess .
Michael J.,Pleasant Hill  CA,29,15,3,9/9/2015,5.0,This place is swell. Well staffed and well run. I came here tonight for a family members birthday. We brought a party of nine and came during dinner rush. They were able seat us immediately  we were quickly greeted by our waitress who was just a doll. She brought our drinks and wasn't the least bit bothered that the rest of our party hadn't shown up. When they arrived she quickly gathered their drink orders and bought them out as well. Our food orders were taken quickly and the food was brought out just as fast. She even brought a dish out twice because my aunt forgot to make her corrections when placing her order. Customer service like this is why I'll come back. Thanks for putting up with my family Christine(I hope that's her name)  appreciate your patience and kindness.
Eric A.,Concord  CA,0,7,1,5/1/2015,3.0,I'm giving a decent rating because the food is consistently good. The bartender  Tyler  needs to relax. His ego  and the way he treats everyone he works with  makes the bar almost unbearable to sit at.
Lynne L.,Hercules  CA,0,28,2,12/4/2014,1.0,Every birthday or special occation  my kids want to eat at BJ's  unfortunately we will now find another establishment to visit.On November 25  we were at your Concord location celebrating my son's 16th birthday. Unfortunately  my son left his birthday card with a sum of money on the table. We contacted our waiter and he told us that he did see the card and had asked another coworker to bring the card to the front. After several conversations with the manager  we still have not received the card  nor money back from the restaurant.Therefore  we will NO longer spend any more of our hard earned money at BJ's because we do NOT trust this establishment.
Chrissy O.,Walnut Creek  CA,40,56,14,8/12/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"Went to bjs for a quick bite and a pitcher of beer.Sat in the bar area  got a seat right away. It was just me and my sister. We ordered a pitcher of beer and waters right off the bat. 15 minutes had gone by and we hadn\'t even seen our waiter. When we finally found him  he said the bartender had ""cut her hand or something""  and that\'s why it was taking so long. Another 10 minutes goes by. We finally get our pitcher after almost 30 min  ordered food  and waters (again). Food came quick and was good. We asked for napkins and forks  twice. Which never came. Our waiter (Salvador) seemed to busy flirting with some waitress at the bar then tending to his tables. The one directly behind was also complaining about their service. We finally flagged down a different waiter to talk to the manager. Before the manager came out waiter finally came out from wherever he was hiding and we asked again for silver wear and waters. By now our food was getting cold (calamari and Brussel sprouts...two things not good when cold) so we used our fingers. Boy that was pretty gross as the food was super greasy. Beer had been gone for awhile. The manager came out and listened to what we had to say and said he would take some stuff off our bill  but NEVER even apologized. Our waiter was MIA for another 20 min  and when he returned he didn\'t even ask if we wanted refills. We AGAIN asked for water and napkins. Finally got napkins  NO WATER. The manager took half off our food. We had to of course find the waiter and ask for our check. Another 15 min go by  and we have to find the waiter to even take out payment. By the end he was so FN rude I didn\'t even tip him. Maybe that\'s harsh but all I wanted was a relaxing night with some good food and beer. Anything but. Horrible horrible service. NEVER coming back."
Toni W.,San Francisco  CA,0,1,,11/25/2015,1.0,This was absolutely the worst service ever by Sal!!!! Do not go for their late night happy hour!!!!!!! The food came out cold and soaked in grease and the server could not articulate any part of our order. Got it wrong thrice and brought us the wrong check!
Tyko N.,Antioch  CA,24,32,2,9/15/2015,1.0,The new mahi mahi was nasty i was fooled by the picture. My friends soup was cold and the manager did not have any empathy towards us. Told us we were wrong. Never going back to a Bj's. McDonald's quality food at double the price.
Kent W.,Fairfield  CA,90,27,5,2/6/2015,3.0,Half time at Warriors Hawks game tied. Sitting at bar watching nice big screen and there are a few other vocal Warrior fans which helps vibe. Ordering Mac N Cheese.
Sean S.,Pacheco  CA,0,4,,11/14/2015,1.0,Late a lot of open tables still Had to wait . Mac an cheese tastes like nachos cheese noodles over cooked. This place sucks !
Michelle M.,Fairfield  CA,599,122,1240,8/17/2010,3.0,I come here mainly for the deep dish pizzas  particularly the 'BJ's Bacon Cheeseburger' ( thank you sister ) along with a randomly chosen appetizer  be forewarned when saucing up the chicken lettuce wraps--that spicy mustard sauce was more consistent of a wasabi soaked dipping sauce!! My sinuses were cleared up instantly and my eyes were watering up along with a few coughing fits. Other than that it wasn't that bad of an appetizer.But my main purpose for visits to any BJ restaurant (brewhouse to be more precise) is for the beers. The usual selection of beers. My choice being the Jeremiah Red or for a sweet note ask for the 'Jerry Burst'.Friendly service with a surprisingly prompt response though at some point the wait was adding up as more people trickled in. Not too much to complain about this time around. I will be back. No doubt about that. :-)
Sheila R.,West Sacramento  CA,182,6,77,3/10/2014,3.0,*Broad variety of choices on menu*Decent happy hr food*Deep dish pizza is good *Medium Priced *People spaced apart in such a way it doesn't sound noisy when at capacity*TV viewable from all areas
Amy R.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,25,1,12/16/2015,2.0,"Overpriced and Uninspired.1 - The mac \'n cheese came from a box. I am not kidding: tiny noodles  neon orange. The meal cost pennies per serving  and it\'s a bad business decision for any self-respecting restaurant. I have no complaint with boxed mac \'n cheese when I\'m lazy at home  but no one who cares about food serves boxed Macaroni and Cheese to paying customers.2 - My hamburger cost $11.25  before tax. $11.25! It was meh: not bad  but definitely not good. For $11  I expect my bacon cheeseburger to be dripping in some crack-based delicious sauce  possibly BBQ  with thick applewood bacon slices  onions - grilled or rings  and sharp cheddar dripping over a half pound grass-fed Angus burger on a fancy bun. No!!! At BJ\'s an $11 burger is rather pathetic: a smallish patty on a plain bun - no sauce  paper thin bacon  a slice of raw red onion  and the cheese was placed as an afterthought in that weird not melted but lukewarm sweaty stage just sitting on the burger. 3 - Shoestring French fries were so unhealthy and fried so many times they would\'ve been decadent if they had arrived hot or at least warm.4 - The ""healthy"" grilled chicken was so salty my kid wouldn\'t eat it. 5 - For a ""brewery"" BJ\'s offers no local  unique  or interesting beers.6 - Everything was soo expensive it made the mediocrity insulting.It would be one star except: - The service was nice. Staff were inexperienced  but trying. - The cookies and cream pookie! Still over-priced  but soo delicious. If I ever come back it will be only for that."
Ivy R.,Martinez  CA,135,1770,4653,3/25/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"Its been a long time since my husband and I went out on a Sunday for our regular lunch dates.We were shopping for beds at Sears and I said what the hell. Lets go try the cocktails over at BJ\'s. (We didn\'t drink last time)There are two mitigating factors to the one star bump. Their amazing cocktail menu and they have the calories listed in the back for almost all of their menu items.Now to the drinks. I started with a Pina Chococolada Martini. Number one weirdest combination drink I have ever had and it is extremely good. ""A decadent  creamy blend of Malibu coconut rum  Midori Melon Liqueur  Monin White Peach  pineapple juice and whipped cream  topped off with a chocolate swirl."" Its Delicious.Second drink was the BJ\'s Irish Root Beer. If you thought Root Beer couldn\'t get any better  well sister it just did. ""Root Beer for grown-ups! Made with JAMESON Irish Whiskey  BAILEYS Irish Cream  BOLS Butterscotch Schnapps  and BJ\'s handcrafted root beer. You can\'t drink just one."" I only drank one but I wanted other things on the menu.In between those two drinks we split a House Salad and a Grilled Chicken Pesto Pizza. The salad was good. Just a regular salad.The Pizza was very good. Its actually the perfect size to split. Each piece is 93 calories. Between the two of us we had 3 1/2 slices. It was a nice lunch and reasonably priced.For the last drink of the day I went with the Strawberry Confusion  Hpnotiq Liqueur  Stoli Razberi Vodka  pineapple juice and a splash of strawberry served chilled and straight up.It was very fresh like a thinner strawberry smoothie served in a Martini glass. I really liked it. Its a great summer cocktail.The service was great. Kind of slow but it was really  really busy in there. I\'m just really appreciative of their outstanding cocktail menu. I will be back more often now because of that."
Liz P.,Pinole  CA,18,69,1,5/29/2014,2.0,I want to give this spot more stars... but I can't. Their food is pretty good  I've never had a bad meal at BJs. But the last time I was here the service was ridiculously slow  and they were not busy in the slightest  so no excuses people! Co-workers and I came here for lunch at 11. There were only 2 tables that were occupado  so you would think that service would be snappy. That was a negative. Once our order was taken it took forever to get our food... were they hand making the pasta back there? De-feathering a chicken? I have no clue  but seriously people... step up your game PLEASE.
Mars D.,Concord  CA,4,3,,9/30/2015,4.0,My girlfriends & I went there last Sunday & had a good time~! Gaby was our server & was fantastic!! (Give that girl a raise  would ya!) All the other servers there were not on her level. Service-wise  Gaby was awesome! As for the food  it's simple  but it's tasty - good job! *Thumbs Up* :)
Dar W.,Concord  CA,0,4,,12/20/2014,1.0,First of all  call ahead seating/reservations is a joke! We still waited a long while. Service was very poor and inefficient. My meal was wrong probably because the waiter did not write anything down. He never brought a few things after being asked twice. After the manger took off my meal and offered a dessert  which I accepted a bowl of ice cream for my daughter  the waiter had the friggin' nerve to put that on the bill too. On the up side everyone was polite and pleasant!
Sziezel P.,Pleasant Hill  CA,201,6,69,3/26/2014,5.0,Got the usual desert (Cookie's & Creme Pizookie) It never let's me down!! They have a new flavor added to their wonderful  delicious pizookies  which is White Raspberry & Almond. My boyfriend decided that he wanted to try it  so we did. & it was just amazing! All of their pizookies are really worth trying!
Gabriel D.,Hercules  CA,173,133,740,4/1/2014,2.0,"It\'s not often that I give a place a bad review. This was one of the worst dining experiences I\'ve had in a long time.Time is valuable  and this establishment really wasted my sister\'s and my time.If the food wasn\'t good  I\'d probably never go back. Unfortunately the food here is good enough to come back for.Now for the story.It\'s Friday  March 28  2014. I just got home from work and my parents went to Cache Creek for the night so I brought my sister to BJ\'s (we were contemplating on where to eat for over 30 minutes until finally she decided BJ\'s).Before arriving my sister called to reserve a table for 2. So once we got there we checked in and they said we were next on the list.We waited for 5 minutes or so and were finally seated. After looking at the menu  we decided to order from their new ""Enlighted Entrees"" section (well new since the last time I was there). So then at ~9:00pm we ordered:Drinks: root beer and waterAppetizer: Calamari2 dinner plates: Mahi-Mahi Tacos (chargrilled mahi-mahi with chipotle mayonnaise and tossed in Santa Fe dressing  Napa cabbage  carrots  red onions and cilantro. With avocado cream sauce  fire-roasted tomato salsa and tortilla chips.)Lemon Thyme Chicken (Herb-roasted chicken breast served over brown rice  topped with sauted red onions  tomatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts in lemon thyme sauce.)After 5 minutes the calamari comes out pretty fast  so we eat that while waiting for our main courses. And the waiting commences. My sister and I talk about college  since my sister\'s a junior in high school right now and I just recently graduated from college  we talked about SATs and grades and which colleges she should apply.We already finished the calamari  and the time is now 9:45pm. My sister and I are wondering what\'s taking our food so long. So when the waitress walks by  my sister asks  ""Do you think you can check on our food?"" in which she replies  ""Yeah..it shouldn\'t be taking this long  let me go check.""9:51pm  our waitress does a squat so that we\'re all on eye level  and tells us  ""I\'m really sorry about this  but they lost your ticket in the back. They don\'t know what\'s going on back there. I\'m really sorry about this. I told them to cook them as fast as they can."" My sister and I are just like :| at this point. It\'s almost 10:00pm already  it\'s kind of late for dinner  and we\'re not as hungry anymore because we had calamari..Then our waitress offers us free salad  in which my sister and I happily accept. So we received 2 \'Fresh Mozzarella and tomato Salads"" that were pretty good.Then just 15 minutes later  both of our orders came in. My sister and I ate half of each  and they were both really good. Under 800 calories per plate  yet packed full of flavor.The food being good is why this experience doesn\'t get 1 star (as well as the 4 refills of root beer I had which made me pretty full).Our waitress apologized again as she gave us our bill  and my sister and I said np. We know it\'s not her fault for the mistake they made in the back. I just wish she could have been more attentive of it though instead of us having to ask her to check on our food.Probably coming back here again eventually...but I just hope that we have a better experience."
Alex N.,Lafayette  CA,4,88,,8/20/2014,2.0,Meh  I wasn't expecting much anyway  I was just killing time while my wife was at the mall. Tap beers were not as cold as I usually like.Bar apps took way too long especially given the fact that they weren't busy at all.
Cynthia P.,Clarksburg  CA,0,12,,6/24/2016,1.0,This is one of the worst BJ's branches around. The service is extremely slow and sloppy. Beer was kind of stale. The food was blah-blah. Altogether a thoroughly unpleasant experience....
Kevin K.,Concord  CA,8,191,,11/26/2012,4.0,"I\'ve been here several times and just never gotten around to writing a review - what\'s wrong with me? Took the family for dinner the night before Thanksgiving and was surprised that 3 of the 4 of us ended up with a seafood dish. Two out of the three (sirloin/lobster tail combo  clam chowder) were decent or above average. The third was the Mahi Mahi and while I knew it was pan seared  it came out very dry. The manager did a great job handling a return and recommending a jalapeno burger so she gets props for her service. I was surprised that I didnt even get a ""sorry  we messed up  here\'s a free beer"" offer but I guess that\'s the way it is in today\'s economy.The beers were good as usual. The waiter was hilarious and helped make an enjoyable evening of it.Tried the Call Ahead Service to get our name on ""the list"". The person answering the phone said they were not busy and there would be no issue so we said  we\'ll be there in 40 minutes. We arrived 5 minutes ahead of schedule and waited 15 minutes for a table. While it was probably better than the 20 other people waiting  I\'m not sure what the real bonus of ""call ahead"" is. We\'ll be back as the overall experience was positive and the one bad dish out of about 7 or 8 times there doesnt ruin it for us. Everyone goofs up occassionally."
Timothy P.,Martinez  CA,0,8,,12/4/2014,5.0,"My wife and I love this place! We go pretty much once a week. There\'s always great food  and the beer selection is inspiring.I\'m something of a beer snob  and I give their Stout a big ""thumbs Up."" The Porter needs a little work  but seems to have improved in the past year. The red  Nutty Brewnette and Hefeweitzen are also good. So many beers  so little time......"
Amanda H.,Concord  CA,185,81,13,9/6/2014,5.0,I absolutely love this restaurant !!! The avocado egg rolls are to die for! I would go there every single day for these if I could!!!! The customer service is usually on point and it's loud enough that I can bring my daughter and not feel like the loudest table at the restaurant. I definitely recommend this restaurant!
Chia V.,Walnut Creek  CA,92,16,9,2/1/2014,3.0,I come here a lot mostly for the happy hour deals. After tonight's visit I should stick to happy hour appetizers and pizza from now on. The jambalaya was extra salty and my bfs burger was tiny. For the cost of the burger  we could've gotten a much better bigger  juicier  and tastier one from red robin. I'll definitely only come back for pizza or the happy hour deals. I've had the Parmesan chicken  average. Tuscan chicken limone pasta  average. Blackened salmon  good. Fish tacos  ok. Stick to the pizza and appetizers. Get the wings. They're really good.
Lishyy L.,Pittsburg  CA,154,14,8,7/11/2014,2.0,I normally go to the Brentwood location & now I know to stick to it. First off our waiter was the worst took forever with EVERYTHING! We didn't even order a drink refill because the only time he came back was when he brought our check. & I wanted to order desert but he totally ruined that as well. The food was not tha bizzness. Lol ordered a shrimp ceasar salad & the shrimp tasted half cooked made my stomach hurt. My boyfriends steak was not well done really undercooked. The time we sat there was ridiculous we were seated waiting on or order to be taken for over an hour. Crazy right? But on top of that it wasn't even packed & ppl that we were there 20 minutes seated before had already been served with drinks & their meals came about 45 minutes before ours. Why we didn't leave? Because I decided I would be nice & give the guy a chance. Wrong choice! I will be sticking with Brentwood Bjs
Michelle Z.,San Francisco  CA,234,129,62,11/12/2012,3.0,I like this location because it's right next to the mall. If the wait is long  you can shop for a little bit (although the buzzers don't work inside the mall). Try the call-ahead list though  so you can shorten the wait once you get there.Service is mediocre here  even when they're not busy  service can be a tad slow. But the food is just like any BJs--big portions  and always tasty :)
Erica C.,Antioch  CA,208,53,245,3/9/2014,3.0,Came for lunch. I haven't been here in a lil while. Didn't have to wait for a table  which was nice. But our waiter was a bit off. He didn't get the order right & then gave us a wrong tab. (Which was less than what our actual bill was  but we were honest enough to let him know.) Food was ok but definitely need better waiters!!
Tom M.,El Cerrito  CA,52,34,84,6/28/2015,3.0,If you're looking for the American chain restaurant experience  you come to the right place. Decent food   decent service  and plenty of TV screens to watch your favorite sporting events - especially your Bay Area teams like Giants  the 49ers  and the Warriors. Come for their amazing assortment of home made beers on tap and stay for their Pazookie! (And deep dish cookie with ice cream on top!). So good!
Shelby S.,Moraga  CA,0,6,2,8/17/2015,1.0,The service was mediocre and so was the food. I have ordered the Santa Fe Salad before and it was awesome  but this time will be my last. There was barely any salad dressing and they forgot to add the cheese and avocado. Poorly done and disappointed.
Thaddius D.,Seattle  WA,124,11,,2/13/2014,5.0,B.J.'s. That must stand for BEST JOB by their employees. I have gone here several times and I am always happy with the service. I have come back several times because of how a couple of the employees have treated me. J.T. has always given me the utmost best experience every time that I go in. He knows the drink that I like and almost has it prepared the moment that I sit down which I think is absolutely amazing. I consider that top class service. I get a lot of great service from all of the employees that work here. It almost seems like a small family when I come in and the way that I am treated. There is great employees at this establishment. Eric has always been nice to me and the same goes for Andre. Andrew always greets me with a smile.Every time that I come here  I feel like I am coming to a family restaurant. It is always a pleasant experience. I like all of their home made brews and when I like to try new things  I try and mix my beers to see what they taste like. The bartenders here do an amazing job of helping the customer satisfy their pallet. I will take my wife and family here any time.
Tracy N.,North Side  Pittsburgh  PA,8,12,1,7/10/2015,4.0,Absolutely amazing service from Kayla! I am very happy she was our server tonight. I order food without onions-I have an allergy- and when we said that there were onions on my salad she informed the manager of this and they both made sure I got a salad without any onions. Honestly  having a server who cares about her customers is an awesome feeling and a manager who comes out and knows about his customers is great! I would give this 5 stars if there wasn't the cross contamination.
Russ A.,Danville  CA,54,27,31,5/14/2015,2.0,Food kind of sucks and is overpriced. Poor waitress was slammed but a great server. I don't think I need to go back.
Chris B.,Antioch  CA,0,33,,9/14/2014,4.0,It was a Friday night. We went there with a party of 4. We called in 30 minutes before to get our name in. When we got there  we had to wait an additional 5 minutes  but then we were seated. Waiter had us sit at a table as he told us there were no more booths available. No big deal. We ordered our drinks  and then a short while later ordered our food. It did take them a while to bring everything out but it wasn't too bad. I ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger  well-done  along with the crispy fries. I have to say  this burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had in my whole life. I ordered it well-done  and if you like well-done burgers  then you know that it has a special flavor to it when it's cooked correctly. Well they absolutely nailed it. The bacon was top-notch and the bun complimented the burger very well. I've had burgers from places like paddock caf where I also felt they were VERY good  but this was truly a gourmet burger  on another level both in terms of quality  as well as price ;) The crispy fries were also extremely good  making it pretty much a prefect dinner. They have a great selection of beer to choose from also  and I enjoyed being able to try a new beer.Only real downer is that the waiter was not very attentive to us. It seemed like the only time we could get his attention was by basically flagging him down. Everyone felt pressured to order a new drink during the few rare times the waiter came by  whether they were finished with their current drink or not  simply because you couldn't count on the waiter actually coming around to give you another chance anytime soon. The table we were sitting in was sort of in the middle of everything  which is the only reason we were able to flag down the waiter on occasion. If we had been on the edge or something  we would have been screwed  maybe seeing the waiter once every half hour or less. Even though this place is not particularly cheap  their service certainly is! For me though  the food is the most important aspect  and I really enjoyed my meal this time.
Stephanie V.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,11,,10/28/2015,2.0,Normally I love Bj's and I love their food  but not this time or location. The service was sub par to say the least. We were never actually greeted by our server  all of our appetizer dirty dishes were left on the table  the mustard and ketchup for my boyfriends burger never came  and we were never checked on  and the server rushed us out trying to get the bill from us asap so he could leave. Not cool dude. If you don't want to stay  give the table to someone else so I can give a tip to someone who deserves it.
Evelyn Q.,Pacheco  CA,148,146,6,9/8/2015,5.0,We came here on Labor Day. It was a Monday. Happy Hour was still in play even though it was a holiday! The margaritas were refreshing seeing as it was really hot in Concord. Did not try the food but definitely will come back for the drinks!
Emmette H.,Concord  CA,1,1,,10/24/2014,1.0,Service was terrible tonight we were promised a 25 minute waitAnd have now waited for 50 minutes they really don't know how to handle a crowd here at all. Don't eat here
Antonia M.,Novato  CA,10,279,56,4/7/2012,2.0,When I go into a restaurant  I expect good service whether or not it is a chain. The service here was just mediocre; we had to ask for drink refills and also for water refills. When the waitress brought our bill  I was shocked since the bill was over $90 and there were only 2 of us for lunch. She gave us someone else's bill; luckily we checked. That kind of mistake is just careless. Would I come back a second time? Eh  probably not.
Timothy T.,Fremont  CA,132,108,67,1/24/2014,1.0,"I come here often. But this time we got seated and we had to wait 45mins to get the news that ""there was a mix up and your food is getting maid right now"" thats bull crap. The people around us that got seated after got served first; one table came in 25mins after and still got serves first! ARE YOU KIDDING? The service should have had the common sense to double check.  I should have mad a big scene to get some crap out of this joke"
teri g.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,10,,10/21/2014,1.0,"Used to be a faithful patron  hadn\'t been there a while - took out of state friends celebrating a birthday....what a joke!!! I agree  it\'s nothing but a RUSH game - ordered several appetizers  four entrees with one added salad. Ok  salad arrives first  then after a long wait the appetizers then five minutes later the entres.....say what???? The waiter was never attentive and then when he approached the table and I explained what happened - there was NEVER ""I\'m sorry"" or try to rectify the problem - it was ""I\'ll have to talk to the kitchen"" - then another employee maybe some manager type) walked by  explained same to her but again blaming the kitchen. REALLY???never again - what a huge disappointment! get your act together folks  another trashy restaurant in the county!"
Alix F.,Walnut Creek  CA,1,37,8,7/27/2014,1.0,We waited 20 minutes for our waiter to notice our drinks were empty. He asked how our food was and left. So we asked for our check and we are now headed elsewhere for drinks.The santa fe egg rolls tasted like microwave taquitos. The fried calamari came with marinara sauce instead of cocktail. All around dissatisfied.
Gaby R.,Vallejo  CA,2,21,3,6/1/2015,2.0,Came here tonight for the happy hour. Waited 20 min for a menu and another 20 to order. Started out with drinks. My beer was fine but my boyfriend had to send back the Hef because it tasted like it was half water. He traded for the pale ale and was much happier. Unfortunately when our food came...much later..our experience took another nosedive. His sliders were tiny and dry. My carnitas fries were almost inedible. The carnitas meat was fried and then must have been baked to the point where the meat was just a rock on top of the fries. We were going to order wings but then thought better of it & went with the pizookie instead thinking this would be the one thing they couldn't mess up. Hence the two stars. We will not be returning to BJ's.
Jabez J.,Oakland  CA,21,115,48,1/22/2015,3.0,I had the artichoke and spinach dip which was subpar but what made the experienced great was the waiter  Edgar he's personable and accommodating; he multi-tasked very well especially with a table full of young ladies and a guy just coming from playing a game of soccer. If you ever stop by BJs ask for Edgar and sit in his area you will be pleased you did.
Shirley J.,San Pablo  CA,53,47,2,2/2/2015,3.0,Sadly I like the berry beer and Mediterranean pizza  however my last two visits have been pretty disappointing. Both times my waiters have been extremely inattentive. The potatoes skins were so greasy when you cut them grease oozed out. Anywho we were seated received out appetizers and did not see our waiter for another 10 minutes we were waiting for napkins  utensils and small saucers  truly by the time we received these our appetizers were cold?! I order the kids cheese pizza and it came out with a large scoop or diced tomatoes on top  I'm not sure what little kid finds that appetizing but maybe you should try something else...my 4 year old almost had a stroke when he saw those tomatoes on his pizza. Anyway hit or miss food to sum it up and the waiting staff may need some training.
Kris S.,Walnut Creek  CA,5,30,15,12/10/2013,1.0,I've been here several times before  but never really cared for the place  other than the fact that they have decent beer on tap. So my bf and I went in for lunch/happy hour on Sunday  and I ordered the mini pizza  and the spin dip. My bf ordered chicken wings  fries  and the chicken lettuce wraps. Everything seemed fine  the service was surprisingly pretty good  the food came out fast  we weren't too pleased with the lettuce wraps (the sauce was really sweet)  but we ate and left.Well a couple hours later I started to feel a bit groggy and my stomach was feeling a little uneasy. I figured it could have been from the beer  or maybe I just overate  so I ignored it. A few hours later I felt a sudden sharp pain in my lower abdomen  and began cramping severely  after which I experience acute  bloody  diarrhea. I ended up spending the rest of my night/morning vomiting  cramping  and craping blood. Needless to say  it was food poisoning  most likely from the chicken on my pizza not being cook throughly. I was sick  and in bed the following day  and am still cramping. My bf was telling his coworkers about the incident and ironically 2 out of the 8 present said they had experienced the same thing after eating at this Bj's. That's a high number for a such a small circle. I wonder how many other people have had food poisoning from this Bj's as well...
Robin W.,Pleasant Hill  CA,62,3,,10/29/2015,5.0,This is a great place to go for late night. I go here a couple times a week in the evening after class and zit at the bar. They have a pretty big selection of food and drinks for happy hour. The service is always great  friendly and attentive. Looking forward to going back ! All the food is incredible it's hard to chose .
Neil M.,Pittsburg  CA,5,2,,7/2/2015,1.0,The only reason I'm giving one star is because the service was good but the food is very very bad. The food totally sucks. I ordered the spicy meatball pizza and got sausage pizza with any spice. Friend ordered the salmon rice carp and all you can taste was salt on the salmon.
Eddie C.,Sacramento  CA,1,8,,2/16/2015,4.0,So my gf and I dined here on Valentine's day and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Everything from the food to the ambience  everything was great. Knowing it was a special day  we were expecting a long wait. Wrong! We got a table within a few minutes and the server was very accommodating. Our food and drinks came out quick and delicious. I had the ribeye ( medium rare) which was juicy  packed with that beefy  rich flavor you can expect from this cut of meat. You know its good when you don't need A1! My gf and I also tried the Irish root-beer which was sweet with a nice  mellow kick. Overall  we would definitely come to this BJs again. The only downer was that there were a few noisy kids who apparently were never taught how to use their indoor voice. Aside from that  it was a great dining experience.
Jen C.,Lafayette  CA,1,45,7,4/16/2014,2.0,Ordered dinner Friday night through Grub Hub. Food took about an hour and a half to arrive  which is understandable for a weekend evening. Delivery driver was really sweet  but that's where any positive feedback ENDS! We ordered southwest eggrolls  a santa fe chicken salad and a pizza. The eggrolls were edible but both the salad and pizza were absolutely not. They were the SALTIEST food items I have ever attempted to eat. The chicken in the salad (a seemingly somewhat healthy option) tasted like it had been soaking in ocean water then cooked in a salt bath and then dredged in salt. It was absolutely terrible. The pizza  aside from being horribly salty  was also undercooked and just gross. All this  horrible food  set us back $53 including a $7 delivery charge. After eating a few bites of this disaster of a delivery dinner  I reached out to Grub Hub for help (their online chat tool is really handy  fyi) -- They submitted the complaint with the intermediary between Grub Hub and BJs  and on Monday my request for a refund was denied.Update: A couple of people from BJs coprorate have reached out to me to try to resolve this issue and I appreciate their follow up. 4 stars for corporate customer service...food was still awful though  but I do appreciate the effort!
Sammy E.,Pittsburg  CA,104,44,26,1/2/2013,5.0,I've been to this restaurant many times now  i'm a big fan because the food is very tasty no matter what you order!i tried the Build Your Own Pizza on a whole wheat and it was awesome!! i will order it for sure next time!i also get the spicy chicken pasta  its flavored and light.i'm not a big fan of desserts but their bazuka was yummy for sure!sometimes the waiter may take a bit too long or forgets to get the necessary things to the table (napkins and sugar/ketchup..) but that really depends on how crazy it goes at their place!its always my fave place to eat wither its on a date or with a group of family and friends!
Cali G.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,63,1,6/14/2015,2.0,4 stars for the food  but only 1 star for the customer service. I absolutely hate coming here because of the customer service. It's horrible every single time. I've overheard employees cuss/curse/whatever numerous times in response to a wrong order (that was the servers fault). Service is slow and not friendly. Perhaps they are over worked and treated poorly by the company? Who knows. I be come numerous times and experienced the same problems. I won't be returning.
Margo L.,Concord  CA,0,4,,4/22/2016,1.0,We are regular customers of BJ's  we've been coming here for years. We visit at least 1 time a week. Recently they decided to down size a lot of the menu items but have not adjusted the pricing at all. We ordered calamari and received 1/3 the portion we received in the past and the price was unchanged. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad the portion was 1/2 the size but the same price. I am all for downsizing  their portions were on the large size however I don't think I should have to pay the same price. Have to say I'm disappointed and most likely will find a new spot to go to each week.
Adri A.,Hercules  CA,358,53,88,8/14/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,NOPE.I used to think that this place was all right. Y'know  your typical 'eh  I'm not expecting much' chain restaurant. Now it's like 'oh man what is this?'My boyfriend and I haven't been here for about a year  so we figured we were due for a cheeseburger deep dish pizza (our fave) and a pitcher of beer. It seemed like a good idea while watching a game of baseball  but...The cheeseburger deep dish pizza we loved... what happened to you? It's no longer served in the buttered deep dish we knew to recognize; it now just arrives on an extremely hot plate. The dough isn't buttery at all like before and the toppings were very skimpy. It seemed more like a regular pizza but with bloated dough--a more half-assed version of its former self. The kicker is that it isn't the worst part about the pizza.The worst part was my boyfriend biting into a small piece of plate in his slice.Yep. Apparently a piece of broken plate had gotten into the pizza somehow. It was small--about the size of a dime  but still very alarming. He could have damaged a tooth! I regret not taking a picture of it before letting the waitress take it to show the manager. Apparently it was hidden under the cheese and other ingredients which is why my bf didn't notice it before it was too late. We pretty much lost our appetite after our unfortunate discovery...The staff  at least  was very understanding toward the situation. The waitress apologized  took our pizza away and set up a replacement (which we didn't even ask for  but oh well). The manager was apologetic and told us that she ordered the kitchen staff to do a clean sweep of the kitchen  which was assuring. My boyfriend received a form to fill out about what happened and her business card in case he needed to contact her. In the end  we weren't charged for the pizza and its replacement (we ended up taking it to-go and carefully eating it at home). I thought the staff did a good job of taking care of the matter  but honestly we will not be coming back because our impression of this place is pretty much ruined.At least the beer was tasty.
Jenelle B.,Northwest  Portland  OR,168,92,177,12/26/2013,3.0,"I go here often and the service here is a hit or miss. Their menu is great and they have a great selection to choose from. They offer lunch specials that run from 3-5 or 2-5  I forgot. BJs also has a happy hour during the day and also late at night where a few dishes would only cost $4 $5 & $6. They offer call-ahead seating for your convenience. My favorites: Clam Chowder w bread bowl Lunch Special: unlimited soup & saladHad to add that their drinks are also a hit or miss depending on the bartender. I had to send my drinks back multiple times because it didn\'t taste ""right"""
Livia G.,Berkeley  CA,178,42,19,5/8/2015,5.0,I occasionally enjoy some food from Bj's but my last time here was all about my server Craig! He was amazing  knowledge about the menu  very sweet and professional! He came by quite often to take on my friend and I. He really did take care of us and midway in our dinner he surprised my friend with a puzookie for her birthday! Without either of us saying anything. I was surprised to learn no one else has ever made a yelp review based on his wonderful personality!
Kaitie R.,Chandler  AZ,14,6,1,5/6/2015,5.0,BJ's has always been one of my favorite restaurants  but our visit today was super exceptional! Our waiter was Craig and he was so sweet! Honestly one of the best servers I've ever had anywhere I've went! He's very knowledgable about the menu and gave awesome recommendations. I ordered a Nutty Brewnette beer that he brought with my burger and it paired perfectly! He even brought me a birthday pizookie (my birthday was the day before we went  he obviously saw when he checked my ID for the beer). I wish I could give him more than 5 stars  I should call ahead next time I go because I don't think I would want anyone else serving me! He has the perfect balance of professionalism and personal friendly conversation. I would definitely have him serve me again as well as recommend all of my friends to him! I wish I could give him 10 stars!
Ysa B.,Vallejo  CA,2,7,2,4/18/2016,2.0,"The staff appears friendly but they should listen better and be specific with what the order is. I ordered a New California Supreme Pizza and I received not what I ordered. It turns out the waiter only wrote down what he thought/assumed was the ingredients of the Pizza ""Spinach and Artichokes"" but not the NEW CALIFORNIA SUPREME PIZZA. Unfortunately when I realized what I had ordered  our waiter was on a dinner break and someone else took over. When I asked the waitress that took over ""Excuse me what kind of Pizza is this?"" she responded really RUDELY and said  ""What do you mean what is this?"" Then I asked that I could borrow a menu and I showed her what I wanted the NEW CALIFORNIA SUPREME PIZZA and she said  ""Well that\'s what he wrote on the slip  he wrote ""Spinach and artichoke pizza"" once again in a snotty tone of voice then finally she asked  ""Do you want me to change it? I can give you a new one."" Even though I was disappointed and I didn\'t want to ruin my evening  I just shook my head and said  ""no it\'s okay"". But I was not okay so this is the opportunity to express how I feel. I still gave a 15% tip but honestly with that kind of treatment and tone of voice I shouldn\'t have."
Auriyon J.,Richmond  CA,109,145,39,11/16/2014,2.0,This place could be so much better. They're unorganized. My date and I came in and they seated us immediately but at the wrong table. They seated us at a reserved party table so we had to move all our things. Then it was way to dark. I could barely see my menu. Even inside the bathroom was really dark! The waiter brought my date the wrong food. And they brought us our drinks with no ice. Who wants warm drinks?! The food proportions were bad. I ordered parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. I got three very small broccoli  and a very small scoop of potatoes. The food was very good! But way to expensive for the size! The dessert was awsome though. Beignet with strawberries and vanilla bean icecream  perfect!
Grace C.,Houston  TX,41,918,178,2/16/2014,3.0,Plenty of TVs to watch  but service was very slow on a Saturday night. I guess that's to be expected. We got an Oreo flavored mini-pizookie (free for your birthday if you sign up for their eClub online in advance of your birthday) and the stuffed mushrooms - both delicious! The prices are OK  a little high but not shockingly so.
Kayla V.,Sacramento  CA,2,3,,10/27/2013,1.0,Typically I love Bj's food  however this experience was just awful. You sit down and expect that the host/hostesses/servers don't stare you down but I guess that's something normal for this Bj's. I didn't realize how juvenile people are  until I was sitting in my chair and kept feeling people stare at me- only to look up and see a couple hostesses/hosts trying to block a server that is staring right at me and acting like a teenager in high school. I mean granted if you know me- say hi and if you think you might know me.. ASK. But if you know me and just don't like me- (which was the case in this scenario) don't just stare. Not only is this unprofessional but if it were anyone else  they may have embarrassed the crap out of you. Bj's should really reconsider what kind of people they hire  cause it's just a bad look. Just so everyone knows- the one star is for the food... And even then- what I ordered was dry....
Bethany C.,Walnut Creek  CA,63,12,4,12/17/2014,2.0,So I came here with my two very best friends. We usually go out to eat once or twice a week and try new places. And critique each place. It's a tradition we have had for years. Today the food was mediocre. Good flavor (slightly above average). The portions were average. The time it took to get our starters was decent. And the entrees came maybe 8 minutes later. The flaws of the night: Our server didn't use any type of note pad to take our orders. I have had this before but had a better out come from it. There were 3 mistakes made to our orders. Usually I give the server the benefit of the doubt  but since the expos (food runners) had the order slips in hand I could see that it was a mistake in the order taking. I will go into further detail of our orders and mistakes later. The server was very sweet at first. Until we asked him to split the check (which I had asked him to do when we were greeted)  he looked at us seemingly annoyed and walked away. This was the point when we had decided not to tip. Our orders are as follows:*Seat #1 (Me)Starter salad: Golden Beets ArugulaEntree: Toasted Chicken Pesto Sandwich  -Sub cup of Broccoli Cheddar soup (no greens salad)  -Extra side of pesto*Seat #2 Starter: Mini bruschettaMain Course: Classic Baked Potato -Add bacon  chz  & sour cream*Seat #3Entree: Mediterranean Chicken Pita TacosErrors:::No topping on potatoes (even tho it was an extra charge). Cup of clam chowder not Broccoli Cheddar. No extra pesto. My water glass had been empty for my last 10 minutes in the restaurant. I will give the restaurant one more chance to redeem it's quality of service.
James B.,Concord  CA,1,15,,2/28/2016,1.0,After checking in and waiting 20 minutes we were forced to change our minds. We got up and just walked out.  Multiple parties that arrived after us were seated  all the while we were left there  just waiting  like idiots.
Pat C.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,21,,3/18/2016,4.0,Good meal tonight while watching our golden state warriors beat Dallas Mavericks . Our waitress was super friendly and allowed us to sample some of the beers before buying. The calamari appetizer was excellent.
Xurxo A.,Concord  CA,25,20,5,3/30/2014,2.0,Food was decent. I liked my strawberry lemonade.Our table was forgotten... Uhm... not coming back.
Jen P.,San Francisco  CA,13,97,8,10/27/2013,5.0,Delicious  delicious pizza! And make sure you get a pizooki - their warm cookie served with ice cream... so bomb!PS they also have great lunch specials!
Jennie C.,Hercules  CA,15,155,162,8/6/2013,2.0,I arrived at BJ's a little before 5 pm expecting the place to have plenty of seating and attentive service. Instead my party was met with a fairly busy restaurant (so much for an early and quick dinner) and really inattentive service. It took quite a long time for our order to be taken and then half way through our meal the server went home for the night. The server that took her place seemed overwhelmed by the amount of tables she had to attend to. We ordered salads and entrees and asked if we should order our pizookies for dessert when we placed our order. The initial waitress said we didn't need to order a dessert ahead of time  so we didn't feel too worried. I ordered a wedge salad and a gluten free pizza. Our server didn't bring our salads. The person who brought our salads placed each salad in front of the wrong person. The lettuce was crisp  but the tomatoes weren't ripe.The entrees took a long time to arrive and when they did  the same thing happened with the salad...all placed in front of the wrong person...and to top it off they didn't bother to take away our dirty salad plates. We sat there for some time before we finally tracked down our server to place our dessert order (after considering going somewhere else for dessert because of the slow service). I ordered a gluten free pizookie. The dirty salad dishes finally disappeared but our dirty entree dishes remained (why?!?). The pizookies arrived and my table mates was so undercooked the manager removed it from the bill (thank you). With that said  we were there for TWO hours. Two hours?!? Why?!? service was sooooo slow. We should have just ordered our pizookies at the beginning - not sure that would have helped  however. I should also mention that we came in for a girls night out to celebrate three birthday's. I told the original server when we placed our order and even told the second/replacement server when she took our pizookie order. None of us received a candle or a howdy'do. I mainly chose this restaurant because of the gluten free pizza and gluten free pizookie. I'd been to the Reno and Roseville locations and had a great experience at both. I even did curb side service at the Vacaville location and everything was perfect. Flawless service and great food was found at three other locations...why not this one?? I'm disappointed in the service we received at this location. Based on this  I am not sure if I would return. So disappointing. Two stars for the gluten free menu. 0 stars for service.
Taylor B.,Brentwood  CA,212,28,72,2/14/2015,3.0,"okay. let\'s start this review with the beginning to end. first of all  we found a booth in the bar on Valentine\'s Day! We were super stoked. So that\'s not a problem. Our server Kristen approached us  room our drink and appetizer order which was perfect. I ordered a Raspberry Lemon Drop and my boyfriend ordered a Widmer Hefeweizen. The drinks get to our table and he tastes his beer and let me just say  it tasted like fireball was mixed with it. So we ask and the server goes  ""oh yeah they make it all citrusy and stuff  I don\'t know why."" ....... okaaaaaay? You could\'ve told us before we ordered it haha. Second  we did not see our server for a good 30 minutes. She passed by  talked to a couple other of her tables  etc. I\'m not one to bicker at the server because I understand they may be busy due to it being Valentine\'s Day. But I mean  go through all of your tables equally and just try a little harder to earn your tip. She was so nice but not the best server.It could\'ve been a better night had it not been so busy."
John M.,El Sobrante  CA,16,47,1,10/9/2013,3.0,We go here maybe twice a year. The menu is overwhelming  it's the size of a small novel. BJ's isn't bad and it isn't really great  it's just okay.If you have a family that can't agree on what type of food to eat then this is your place  the menu variety is what makes us choose this restaurant over others when we're in the area.
Janine C.,Eastside  Las Vegas  NV,0,1,,8/1/2014,5.0,Celebrated my 21st birthday here! I was just visiting this area and chose Bj's because I knew it would be worth it and it was! Our food came out hot and within minutes!(we preordered online). After finding out it was my birthday our waitress told her coworkers so I was wished Happy Birthday a ton! It was great! I felt like they genuinely cared.
Alexys E.,Antioch  CA,78,333,325,3/10/2012,4.0,BJ's is not just a one trick pony!Besides their pizza  their other main dishes are fabulous as well.1. The first time I went  I went with family. We had pizza  and must I say it was GREAT tasting pizza. 2. The second time I went I had their porkchops. I was expecting a double cut...it was close to lollipop pork chops but they were delicious and the potatoes that came with it were to die for. It came with sweet apples and mustard...it all tasted wonderful together. A great dish.3. Third time I went I had Parmesan crusted chicken breast with again their fab mashers...the broccoli was cooked to death though. The chicken came with this lemon and sun dried tomato butter.. It was so rich that I could barely finish it...but rich is a good thing.4. By the way  their raspberry lemonade is amazing. And if you're going to BJ's  you MUST have a pizzookie for desert. The place is pretty much always packed. The service is decent the food is above average. Loved it and will go back as soon as possible.
S. D.,Columbus  OH,28,42,,11/13/2013,1.0,This place managed to ruin my simple birthday dinner. Our sever was great and compassionate  the manager on the other hand was a bit inexperienced and uncaring. Our appetizers were okay  nothing to write home about  but okay. Our wine was excellent. Our steaks where bland and unseasoned  one arrived well done instead of medium and one arrived cooked okay. Now I remember about 6 months ago the steaks being delicious and tender with a garlic butter sauce  which apparently is what made it tasty and tender. Have you ever have a tough steak that was cooked medium  I didn't either until tonight. Our baked potatoes where not baked  they might have been at one point but they where nuked warm after being chilled  because nuking a baked potato the sits in the fridge makes it that solid non-fluffy consistently that I received tonight. Even boiled potatoes are fluffier than what they tried to serve me.So we complained to the manager  one meal was deducted  granted I ate more of mine but a 10% discount or having made my glass of wine free  on that plate would have been nice  because you not only ruined dinner but a birthday dinner. He did not try to apologize for the cooks  to me that says obviously he knows they are nuking cold things and does not care about the quality of the food  which also says inexperienced to me. Then they try to make me happy with a birthday dessert  I do not want dessert after an awful meal  no  that does not make amends. I will not be returning  not because of the server but because the food was awful and the manager barely cared. You've lost my business forever. I wish I could give zero starsUpdate: I was ill a few hours after eating here until the next night  avoid this place unless you like food poisoning.
Kitty D.,Alamo  CA,64,756,879,10/1/2013,3.0,Tried the happy hour in this strip mall location. Staff were nice and accommodating and we got the patio seats. The ambiance was OK but it was very mall like. Menu selection was varied and seatings were plentiful. We got the patio seat and I had a salad. Nothing outstanding.
Jack D.,Rocklin  CA,5,15,,4/27/2014,2.0,"We chose BJ\'s because it was familiar and they have a large menu so there is something for everyone.Service was good. They were very accommodating for our party of 7 plus service dog on a Saturday afternoon. Wait staff were attentive and pleasant. Food  however  was cold and bland. Not how I remember BJ\'s - maybe they sell enough booze they can phone it in with the food. The two of us who had alcohol were happy with their drinks. The coffee drinkers were disappointed that their options were limited to ""regular or decaf."" Next time in Concord  I plan to try somewhere else."
Jan Jeric M.,Sacramento  CA,168,45,48,10/22/2013,3.0,Dinner at BJ's is always a hit or a miss. You'll either like or dislike your dinner/lunch depending on how good the cooks and waiters/waitresses are that night.This night  my entire group was 50/50 on our meals.Three of us had soups  salads  and light dishes. All were very good; especially the tomato bisque! The other two had salmon and pulled pork. The salmon was over seasoned and the pulled pork with fries was not cold but not warm either. Both were okay.Dessert... that's an entirely different story altogether. We were all full from our meals but one of our party insisted on getting a pazookie party platter. Five of us on one pizza size pazookie? I didn't think we could do it. We ordered a red velvet  chocolate chunk  cookies and cream  and peanut butter. IT WAS AMAZING!!! I was a believer after that  and we finished every last scoop.Overal: 3.5 stars because the food and service is never consistent. It fluctuates between good and bad. But the dessert never disappoints. You can't leave BJ's without getting a pizookie!
ser s.,San Francisco  CA,10,26,52,11/9/2015,4.0,"Ok  I have to start out saying I really didn\'t want to go to this place this past Saturday nite solely based on the reviews. However  my S.O. was insisting on getting something to eat as we just finished a brief shopping sojourn at Sunvalley Mall  which in itself left me a bit perturbed as I kept repeating to myself ""I\'m not a mall person -- I don\'t like mall food  etc.!"" Anyway  I couldn\'t dissuade him and followed him in to this place  asked for a table for 2  and proceeded to wait until a table was available...15-20 minutes  which was not an issue as we had a beer at the bar....chilled me out...his intent I\'m sure. We checked out the quite impressive selection on the menu -- he chose Jambalaya (really well-seasoned and flavorful!) and I the lower calorie chicken pita wrap  which to my surprise was quite....tasty. Our servers were polite and our orders arrived promptly. So  what else than that do you want when you go to a restaurant in the burbs attached to a mall  or in our big insanely over-priced world-class city for that matter? Well  this place ain\'t too shabby! I\'m actually recommending it..just don\'t tell my S.O. that he was right after all. ;)"
Nic P.,San Francisco  CA,38,65,37,4/18/2014,4.0,The blend of the atmosphere with the dinning section and the bar section could be different it's is hard when in dinning section With a date and all u hear is cheering
Cherish S.,Newark  CA,46,28,7,9/22/2013,2.0,We ordered a pizza with no meat as we are vegetarians. My bf noticed there was a lot of missing cheese on his pizza then saw the ham. There was ham sprinkled all over the pizza then picked off. Tomatoes were thrown on at the last min. We couldn't find a manager anywhere. I'm giving them two stars bc they gave us a $20 gift card and made us a new pizza.
Trang W.,Martinez  CA,63,128,970,2/12/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,"I think the change in ownership also changed their food. I ordering their chicken tortilla soup off their new menu and when it came to the table  I had to asked the waitress if the soup was really what I order  I could not find ONE piece of chicken in the soup. Also I recall when I first came there  the soup bowl they had for a small was a good portion  and their large was LARGE...now it looks like they are resulting to big flat plates to give you the illusion of a big plate  but it\'s so small I don\'t even think it would be consider ""small."" BJ is getting to be like many good restaurants gone bad--started off with great taste with fresh ingredients to one that short-cuts their customers on taste and still charge them the same price.I thought I was going crazy but even my other friends who go there often said the food is not as good as it use to be. Kind of disappointed--thought we found a good place  now it\'s just another ""chili""--hit and miss menu."
Monica S.,Merced  CA,4,21,3,2/2/2015,3.0,Food was nothing special. Pizookie was good. Atmosphere looks nice enough but waiters are horrible. Our waitress complained about another waitress when i asked her if everything was ok (a general question). Killed the mood for me  will not return unless Im too high and want a pizookie.
Janice C.,San Francisco  CA,524,2157,5769,4/1/2011,4.0,I love BJ's for their deep dish pizzas  but on this visit we took advantage of their lunch specials. From their small bites menu  we sampled the crispy artichoke bites. These were lightly breaded and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. Although I think without the lemon garlic aioli  these would be bland.Then our server brought out the Ahi Poke. A generous serving of big chunks of ahi with yellow and green onions  served with crispy sesame wonton chips. I liked this a lot!I had the fish tacos which came with red cabbage  onions and delish chipotle mayo. It just worked well together. Dad had the clam chowder and wedge salad.We had a hard time finding our server at the end of the meal  but he worked his butt off considering it was a bit busy lunchtime on a weekday.BJ's has the great formula of keeping lunch specials (from 11am-3pm) under $12 for entrees  having a full bar and being conveniently located at the mall. This is so much better than the food court.
Jeremy K.,Martinez  CA,121,86,10,10/25/2014,1.0,Wow  if there was ever a moment I wish I was a woman it would be now. Sitting at bar  3 male bartenders  took 15 min for 1st beer. Put empty beer on edge of counter (indicating I would like another) going on 34 min  yes I am timing them and still no service. 3 women have sat at the bar on both sides of me since my empty beer has been getting dusty  both served 2 times already.....so your service sucks  I was going to order food but I need sleep it's Saturday and I need to work Monday morning. Last time here
Aisha J.,San Lorenzo  CA,4,8,,5/5/2015,4.0,I had my husband's birthday gathering here and overall I was very happy! My party of over 20 was given 2 friendly servers. Also  I really liked that BJ's allowed people in my large party to get separate checks! That way I wasn't stuck with a large bill of things my party forgot they ordered. The only real complaints I have is that they took forever to bring out the birthday pizookie. So  most of my guests left before we could sing happy birthday. Lastly  they gave me a scare when I called to confirm my reservation by telling me they had no record of my reservation. Luckily all was figured out the next day and good times were had.
Dusty N.,Emeryville  CA,21,219,13,2/17/2014,4.0,Came here this evening after a long day of running errands and it was the perfect place to unwind. We sat at the bar and had excellent service from a bartender named Shane. He was so nice and professional and gave us prompt service. It was happy hour so our drinks were only $4 each and the appetizers were cheaper than usual too. Great drinks  great food and great service. I will definitely be back! Note to the hostess stand.....there were like 5 people standing behind the hostess stand and it was really awkward feeling and intimidating when you all just stand there staring at us when we walk in and out. Why is it necessary to have that many people greeting and saying goodbye? It was just a weird uncomfortable feeling.
A.B. S.,GA  GA,0,98,,7/4/2014,2.0,"Stopped in to BJ\'s for the first time yesterday  after work. My colleague said he wanted to watch ""The Game"" and this was the place to do it. He also said to me  ""The food here isn\'t great  but I like the atmosphere."" So there it was  at the start and plain as day. Okay  I am game for (almost) anything  including lunch at a nationally-represented place.The HUGE  four-image TV was impressive  bit without sound  who cares? Bar was packed  but we found two seats at the far end. Bartender was busy  so much so that what should have been a 45-minute meal stretched into double that. She was perky  friendly but all business. I asked about special drinks and she convinced me to try a pear cider. Good  sweet and not too tart.Ordered two appetizers  as I prefer grazing and was not super hungry. Chose the Crispy (read: Fried) Calamari  with two dipping sauces  and the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms I saw on the plate of the diner next to me  who raved about them. My friend had the Moroccan Spiced Salmon. Then the wait began. The place was not super crowded  and yet it took almost 30 minutes for the food to arrive. My friend\'s tomato soup was brought to him  but neither of my dishes were forthcoming until his salmon showed up.Finally  a runner brought the plates and by then  I was ready to dig in. The calamari  a long-time favorite  was properly and lightly coated with a crispy  non-greasy batter and fried just barely past the well-done but still chewy stage. The alleged Lemon Garlic Aioli was more Ranch-like  but still better than the flavorless ""Spicy"" Marinara  which  at the very least  needed salt. These were not the large  sometimes-rubbery rings offered everywhere  but smaller circles along with nicely crunchy larger pieces as well.The mushrooms were another story altogether  and not a good one. The first bite of the half \'shroom I bit into had good fungus flavor  and that was about it. None of the promised flavors of a ""blend of fresh spinach  BJ\'s own spinach and artichoke dip  feta cheese  chopped mushrooms  herb bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese"". That is a whopping seven (7) items  all stuffed into one little cap. But that ain\'t the end. The almost final product is then  ""drizzled with lemon pesto sauce."" Perhaps. But the only real  pronounced flavor discernible was a vinegar-y tartness  tinged barely with citrus. None of the Feta\'s saltiness  no earthy Spinach or Artichoke notes  not even  again  salt.In the end  the cost vs. value was hinged on the fact that I was full  but not sated. It was a business lunch and next time  I take my business elsewhere."
Karli B.,San Ramon  CA,241,10,2,3/10/2015,5.0,Never disappointed  atmospheres great  food and drinks are always on point  and service is usually good. If you want to go for a more lively experience where I think the service is usually a little more prompt  I highly recommend sitting in the bar area. But if your not in a hurry and you want a more private date out  the dining areas great too.
Aaron P.,Concord  CA,5,21,3,10/9/2013,4.0,I ordered the clam chowder as well as the calamari appetizer. both were pretty tasty! the clam chowder could have been a little bit less viscous  but still tasty! calamari was great as well.for desert  I got the infamous red velvet pizookie. still can't say that I have every once had a bad pizookie. great food  and pretty good service as well!Not my first go-to place  but always a great backup to fall onto in case you want to dine late!
Jessica P.,Auburn  WA,24,62,7,7/20/2013,2.0,This was the 3rd time I've been here. And again was disappointed.Maybe they knew they were second choice  after we were told that Lucille's  (the restaurant across the way)  told us they had an hour wait. First we were told it would be a 10-15 minute wait. After about 20-25 minutes  my boyfriend went to go check where we were on the list  and it turns out they didn't even have our name logged in. They took care of it right away of course  after a very insincere apology from the manager. We were seated at a freshly wiped table and the waitress we had was very nice. However  the service was very slow. It seemed as if this waitress had too many tables to wait for. We didn't get silverware until our appetizers came. I had to ask for sides of ranch  twice. The food took forever. The whole experience took about an hour and a half. The only highlight of the evening was the food. Try their giant stuffed baked potato with chicken (with a side of ranch!). It was awesome. Their fried shrimp is also very good. The cocktail sauce has a kick to it.
Steven G.,Modesto  CA,78,945,143,3/1/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Wow this trip was so much better than the first and my love for BJ's has been renewed (get your head outta the gutter  ya hear?!).This time around it was lunch time on a Monday  soooo much better. We got a nice comfy booth  our server was not far behind after being seated and our food came much quicker than the last time.I ordered a Turkey Club and the hubs ordered a BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich. Mine was very tasty and hands down one of my favorite items on the menu. Hubs enjoyed his sammy too but got some stomach discomfort later on  no fault of the restaurant.We'll be back and I am currently starting up a campaign to inundate headquarters to open up a BJ's in my area. We'll see what happens with that ;-)
Darnella K.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,1,1,4/14/2015,1.0,I called to place a take out order. I saw online that the bacon cheese burger pizza was available; called the restaurant to order it and the staff had no idea what I was talking about and that it was not available. Please update the menu online. So I ended up ordering two DEEP dish pizzas that was $50. I went to go pick up the pizzas that looked like regular pizzas that could pass for Pizza Hut. I even asked the take out staff about the pizza  and they agreed that this is what their DEEP dish pizza is. PLEASE! The only difference is the crust looked like it had been puffed with air. Extremely disappointed I will be saving my money next time and just call Pizza Hut for only a fraction of the price.
Jack S.,Martinez  CA,0,43,,4/20/2013,2.0,I will not be going to this BJs again anytime soon. I have to admit  I used to go to BJs before it was a huge chain and when they basically only had pizza  the original one in downtown Seal Beach...My how far they have fallen.We went last night and a promised 20 minute wait time turned into 40. Then we had to wait for our table to be cleared while the bus stood around and joked. Then we had a 15 minute wait for a greeting and menus. Get the point? getting the check took another 15 minutes  and by the way  they gave us the wrong one. My daughter said the last time she came with some buds  they screwed up the check....twice. Getting the check picked up - another 5+ minutes.The food was average  the pizza not like I remember. I will give 4*s to the Hopstorm IPA  and the apps. But service is a 1*.The crowd is pretty lame  call it diverse ghetto. Fat ladies of multiple ethnicity with tats galore. Dudes with crooked hats and lots of bling  dropping f-bombs.And as we walk out  right past JCP  a bunch of employees were smoking  in plain sight  in an area designated as non-smoking. I smoke  but frick  show some class and when wearing your colors  be discreet!Anywho...find a better pizza joint IMO.
Jonathan Q.,Concord  CA,235,50,12,5/9/2013,4.0,haha I feel like I come here several times a month. Either cause I cant think of anything to do but to share a couple pitchers with friends or cause they have hella TVs and I just wanna catch a game. They're food is alright. Its like a fancier applebees or chilies. Very similar food with Yardhouse in SJ. But they're happy hour pizza and appetizers are cool. They have a cookie/ice cream dessert thing called a pizookie. Nothing special really but the ladies like cookies and ice cream...
Agnes B.,Vacaville  CA,1,30,,3/4/2014,2.0,"My husband wanted to eat here one night because of the beers  and he really wanted a steak. Our server seemed bored out of his mind and desperate for his shift to be over. He gave us the special beer menu  and after ages of weighing the different beer selections  my husband decided which one he wanted. When the server came back  he said  ""oh  yeah  we don\'t have that beer right now."" My husband\'s second choice? ""No  we don\'t have that one either."" Third? ""No  don\'t have that one."" Do you think perhaps this would have been good information to give us before you dropped the beer menu and walked away??My husband\'s steak was fine  but the sides seemed teeny-weeny. I swear  it seemed like he had six green beans and a mini scoop of potatoes. Maybe to make the steak look bigger? My entree  however  really ruined my night. How can you go wrong with fish & chips? Maybe when the fish is fried in the same vat of oil as the jalapeno poppers  thereby burning the mouth of someone who can\'t handle jalapenos. Instant heartburn too. By the time the server came back  my husband was nearly finished his steak. He did offer to replace the entree. Did I want to wait for another order of fish & chips to be made? This late in the game  no. I opted to switch out for a salad  which was incredibly disappointing... practically revolting... ice cold  obviously pre-made (who knows when?) and stored in the fridge  with chunks of ice-cold processed turkey that I would only expect to be on a salad I bought at a gas station. I ended up taking a few bites only because I was starving. Can\'t believe we ended up paying for it. We just wanted to get out of there. Can\'t see myself saying  ""hey  let\'s go to BJ\'s!"" ever again. Bleughhh."
Lisa Z.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,3,,3/2/2016,4.0,Great menu  and the bar area with the huge wall of TV's is very entertaining! The delivery service and curbside pickup is lightening-speed fast. All good!
Jasman B.,Danville  CA,0,2,,8/16/2013,1.0,Terrible service.My husband and I were starving after a day of running errands and we stopped here on the way home for a familiar  no-fuss dinner. Big mistake.Once we were seated we were unacknowledged for at least 15 minutes. We had to flag someone down to get a glass of water. Another 15 minutes later  we flag down that same waiter  who let us know our waitress was somewhere around  to place our order so we could eat and leave. 30 minutes and all we had was water? Our waitress finally showed up to bring by our meal and was unapologetic for being absent. We asked for tabasco twice until we finally received it--it was just awful service. I know it's BJs and not exactly high end fine dining  but a little bit of customer service would be nice.
Joe B.,Hollister  CA,95,226,35,11/30/2014,4.0,Pizza was good but it could use more sauce lots of beer on tap including racer 5 great service
Leslie H.,Irvine  CA,0,29,,3/29/2015,2.0,What a disappointment this restaraunt was today. Portions very small and food not great. Eat in southern California BJ all the time and I give them 5 stars. To top it off manager said he would make an adjustment. Got bill no adjustment. Chalk it up to bad experience. Won't be back
Kim L.,Walnut Creek  CA,92,46,44,1/17/2015,5.0,Absolutely the best pizza and wings we've ever had. Pizza is out of this world. The beers are exactly as great as you expect them to be! Our favorite is the blonde-but you can't go wrong with any beer you order.
Miguel E.,Fairfield  CA,23,5,,2/13/2015,4.0,Went to BJ's to have a few beers while my lady shopped  and Eric the bartender was seriously amazing. When it comes to customer service he knows what it takes. He touches the entire bar and makes sure everyone is satisfied and has a drink in their hand. He took a short break and the service wasn't that great  but when he came back you could see he makes a big impact on that place. Great job Eric. I gave this place a 4 cause of the 2 bartenders that took over when he went on break. They just ignored the whole end of the bar. One guy looked new  so that's understandable  but the other girl just looked like she didn't want to be there. Amazing job to Eric tho.
Debbie B.,Martinez  CA,12,14,2,9/21/2014,1.0,I was so disappointed last night 9/20/14 I have been there several times  but my husband has never been there. So for my birthday dinner we decided to go to BJ's .We were seated outside as requested. Got drinks right away. We ordered the flatbread pizza that when got to our table had hardly ANY toppings!!!! When the waitress came to pick up the plates she knocked over my wine glass that cost 9.00 for about the size of a 3/4 cup of wine. I caught the glass before it spilled on my phone but some wine spilled out!!! When I asked if she would replace it  she told me we can't do that!!! Horrible customer service!!! Then my daughters pulled pork hardly had ANY pork in it!!! My birthday meal was top sirloin with my two sides was mashed potatoes and broccoli when it got there  there was 3 little broccolietts . I was so disappointed for the cost you hardly get any food!! I wanted to add a photo but can't find where to do that!
Michael C.,Vallejo  CA,0,4,,7/22/2014,1.0,Can't stand this place. About a year ago me and my significant other decided to eat here since it was right next to the mall. We were seated and weren't even served drinks until 20 minutes later.We tried to be patient and smiled at the waiters and waitresses as they walked by and they never said a word or stopped to ask any questions. 30 min passed and we finally had to flag down our waiter to order. Another half hour later  not exaggerating  our food never came. Worse thing is that our original waiter took his break and never told any other waiter anything. We got up and left.Last week we decided to give it another shot. BAD IDEA. Again for no reason whatsoever after an hour of ordering  no food to be seen. Asked to remove the pizza from the bill since we were there with family. When asked where's our food  server seemed surprised. Never again will I come here. The workers are friendly but unorganized  forgetful  and unclear with their duties.
Darcy N.,Concord  CA,0,24,5,2/9/2015,3.0,Adequate service  adequate beer. BJ's strict corporate policy's ensure that if you've eaten at one BJ's  you've pretty much seen them all.
Amanda N.,Richmond  CA,0,20,1,1/6/2016,1.0,The lady was rude  she had a sarcastic attitude with me when I simply asked a simple question!
Richard N.,Honolulu  HI,204,257,105,2/24/2011,3.0,"A-OK. Right in the middle is a good way to describe this place. The service is okay  often messing up our order. Once we asked for a carafe of the sangria and the guy told me  ""we don\'t do that here"" and we took the menu and pointed to it and said  ""it says it RIGHT HERE that you do"". He came back and said  ""my manager said okay  we can do that"". I didn\'t know you needed to get your manager\'s approval to sell things on the menu... ? Also  they are horrible at getting your reservation sat on time. I understand that they are known to have big parties and that can sometimes interfere with time. But I planned my cousin\'s birthday here and we had a reservation for 8:00 and didn\'t get sat til 9:00 even though our entire party was already there. Portions are pretty good sized. Happy hour is pretty whack  not really a good deal and the late night happy hour doesn\'t start til 10.Avocado egg rolls = YUMPale Ale Nachos = YUM (ask for these with the shoe string cut fries  its like carne asada fries but BETTER  and even more delicious when you take your leftovers home and microwave it)Calamari = OKLettuce Wraps = OKRoot beer here is DELICIOUS and bottomless (I guess all soda is). But they are KNOWN for it. Its really sweet and comes in a giant frosted glass. They can make you a whole lot of stuff at the bar but they don\'t carry 151 (no cariboo lous). DO NOT DRINK THE RED HEADED SLUT. WORST DRINK EVER."
Jenn Z.,Orinda  CA,14,20,,1/31/2015,5.0,Sat right down in the bar. Service was friendly and quick. Great menu. This place is always a great place to stop in for lunch  snack  or dinner. Oh yes and save room for some awesome desserts.
Karabella C.,Concord  CA,56,58,2,8/2/2013,3.0,Very inconsistent food and service to be honest. Sometimes we enjoy everything. Other times its a horrible mess. They have a great kids menu though so we often go when it's family outing time. I love their rewards program and often redeem my points with no problem. The hubby enjoys their craft beers :)Really a 3.75
Lisa L.,Oakland  CA,41,76,9,10/31/2014,1.0,This is the Second time their service has been lousy  and the LAST time I'll ever set foot in this awful place. Soup and a salad  how difficult can that be? After waiting about 30 minutes  we were ready to walk out  just as my boyfriend's meal arrived. A few moments later my salad and side order of cold fries arrived. No setups  I suppose we were expected to eat with our hands. The course ground black pepper in the salt shaker meant that I had to unscrew the top and pour the pepper into one hand and sprinkle it on my food with the other hand. No  the place wasn't packed (1:30-ish in the afternoon)  but with the dirty knife in my setup napkin plus the slow service and everything else  it's obvious that this place is being managed by someone with little attention to detail.
S T.,Vallejo  CA,0,1,,2/8/2016,1.0,Horrible service!!! And pizza is just warm! And when you ready to eat  there are no silver ware!
Diana C.,Corona  CA,204,667,790,7/30/2013,3.0,Good beer  good cocktails  and average food. Like how they are their own brewhouse. The prices on pints are decent. I like that there is a lot of variety when it comes to everything. They serve big portions too. I always have to take a box to go. Wait time is a lot though. Especially on weekends. You have the option of making reservations M-F before 5:30pm.
Xavier R.,Oakland  CA,238,21,12,11/26/2014,3.0,"Overheard and associate say ""omg fuck this place right now!!"" there\'s a time and a place to talk crap about your job. But not in front of customers and coworkers. I like eating and drinking beer at this place but after I heard that  it killed the vibe. Makes me wonder if the associates get so mad that they\'d do something bad to my good or drinks."
Dani J.,San Pablo  CA,1,48,10,1/15/2015,5.0,Finally a good server ! Came here with my boyfriend and for some reason  no matter where we go  we end up with crappy service. Alex was our server for the night and he was fantastic! Really funny and genuine and was an overall great server. Food was great also !
Ashley L.,Concord  CA,10,25,8,1/13/2015,5.0,Waitress was friendly and attentive but not in a way she interrupted the meal it was very pleasant  not to loud.  I had salad it was extremely good tasted really fresh. Friend had sandwich and fries they were cooked perfectly. Would definitely recommend it.
Samm A.,Benicia  CA,23,22,1,1/13/2015,5.0,I was taken here today for my birthday by my friend Chris. I had the best burger. And then a mini Pazookie. It was so good. Our server was so helpful and courteous.
Jaynie F.,Oakland  CA,595,88,56,6/13/2013,4.0,The grilled Mahi Mahi tacos on the lunch special were off the hook. A delicious  and creamy avocado sauce and a salsa with a decent kick to add on top.I do not come here very often  however now with these tacos  I just might be back!
Marcus M.,Ventura  CA,765,138,332,10/24/2010,3.0,BJ Micro Brews from light to dark *note straight from the menu*BJ's Lightswitch Lager- well with mild or delicate dishes  as well as spicy foods.BJ's Brewhouse Blonde- pairs well with poultry and seafoods.Harvest Hefeweizen- good match with most salads.Piranha Pale Ale- excellent with spicy foods.BJ's Jermiah Red- is best matched with beef or pork.Nutty Brunette- pairs well with hearty foods and sauces.BJ's PM Porter- a great compliment to barbecued and smoky foods.Tatonka Stout- that pairs well with sweet sauces  toppings and deserts.Similar with most BJ's the interior appearance is the same. After plopping a squat at the bar I was greeted and ask immediately what I wanted. There's nothing like a cold one with a fresh glass of Ahi Poke. It was pretty good.But don't get the Fish and Chips. Breaded Parmesan Chicken  and the Chardonnay Salmon was deeee-licious! Pizooki's are the greatest desert. Good for groups. Surely you will enjoy!
Lisa H.,Walnut Creek  CA,112,777,172,11/4/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,After my dining experience last night  I am not really a fan of BJs. I prepared myself ahead of time with how slow I expected the food to take  but I swear the whole dining process took way too long! I was also irritated b/c our waiter asked us multiple times if we wanted appetizers or desserts  I think asking one and receiving a NO should suffice. I was really thirsty last night  but our water never got refilled  the only thing we got asked about were beer...i don't know if our waiter was trying to up his tip  but the lack of water  combined with the super long wait time for ok food  and the waiter just made this experience blah.The deep dish I had was not good....the pizza reminded me of pizza hut  just with a lot more crust....so the pizza should really be called extra thick crust pizza. None of the food at my table wowed me  I would really only come back to sit at the bar because then I would be able to get a drink when I wanted and be able to order the flat bread  which is the only thing I like here.
Sasha C.,Fairfield  CA,133,88,83,10/2/2012,5.0,Normally I come here for the pizza  but everything I've ever had here has been delicious.Last weekend I meet up with a couple of my girlfriends here to share appetizers. Potato Skins  topped with Shredded jack and cheddar cheese  apple wood smoked bacon bits and green onions  served with sour cream  and ranch dip. At lest a third of the potato skins did not contain enough cheese. Margherita Fresca flat bread  the classic mozzarella cheese tomato and basil  with Parmesan cheese. Was very good I would defiantly get it again.The new Black and Bleu flat bread  grilled skirt steak and bleu cheese  with mozzarella  caramelized onions  portobello mushrooms  red bell peppers and thyme; was my favorite!It wasn't until after we ordered that I noticed their Oktoberfest menu  guess I'll be coming back soon!
Jason P.,Dickinson  ND,4,105,255,6/26/2014,5.0,Didn't go here with high expectations but was proven wrong! Their house root beer is amazing!!! Presentation of all food was unique and taste was on point!! Our server was a young white bald female that I wish I could of got her name but displayed great service!! Kudos to her for sure!
Karlo B.,San Jose  CA,258,115,157,11/28/2014,1.0,I'm writing this review while I'm sitting at my table. Came here for lunch on Black Friday and it's not that busy. I've been waiting 10 minutes and still no server. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm still waiting. I'm falling asleep.........
Meg W.,East Bay  CA,265,884,371,9/6/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I should've listened to my gut and my previous reviews and not gone back here. 4 out of 5 silverware settings dirty2 rootbeer floats forgottenSteak ordered med-well came rareCrispy jalapeno burger was cold  had no flavor  and just looked sad. The beef patty itself was torn into three pieces. There were three little deep fried jalapenos smushed inside  but you couldn't taste them at all. The bun was ridiculously huge  dry and cold.Mahi-mahi rice dish embarrassingly small.Waiter's attempt at a bartender's slide of a glass of water across our long  long booth ended up in disaster  toppling over  streaming ice cubes and water down the length of the table and a cascading down to the floor. The waiter handed me four towels  asking me to clean it up.The California Club pizza app (flatbread with chicken  applewood bacon  tomato  and avocado) was good  but certainly not good enough to suffer through anything else here.Oh  and you'll have a good wait outside before any of the fun stuff begins. Maybe I thought service would improve since it's now been a while since they opened. Fool me once  fool me twice  fool me thrice. The End.
Jill E.,Clayton  CA,19,15,1,12/18/2014,5.0,I love this place! I love the food! I am a club member and am always treated well and take advantage of the deals whenever I can. I have had off nights here and there (cause I come a lot). Once my steak was a little more done than I liked and I just happened to mention it when the waiter asked how everything was The server INSISTED on taking it back and bringing a new plate even though I was just gonna deal with it. One night I came late and there was an issue with only one server. I could tell it was an off night but as I had brought a guest I felt disappointed. I wrote the manager a letter and not only did he issue me a discount but wrote me a personal thank you for my letter. I will always choose this place when I am looking for a wide variety of consistently tasty food and reliable service.
Josephine S.,San Pablo  CA,1,1,,1/21/2015,5.0,A friend and I went to BJ's for dinner since that's our usual go to place when we're out shopping. Our waiter was Will  he definitely made dinner awesome. Polite  funny and kept me laughing   even lit my candle for me on my desset . Thanks Will for the great service you provided.
Karene M.,Elk Grove  CA,91,3,,12/13/2014,1.0,I've never had such a bad experience at this Bj's before until today. First off  we ordered and waited for about an hour to get our food. 3 out of 4 of what we ordered were all wrong. And on top of that  everything tastes disgusting. I'm so mortified at my experience here!!! What happened? You used to be so good.
Matt H.,Concord  CA,18,10,2,10/22/2015,2.0,"I usually don\'t go to BJ\'s during my lunch break since it takes too long to get food  but I discovered their mobile app recently which I thought would make things very convenient to order in advance. Two days in a row now I\'ve had problems (yesterday my burger arrived with no cheese  despite the request being very visible on the receipt)  today they clearly didn\'t start making my food until I arrived to pick it up. They had sent me a confirmation email with the pick up time clearly stipulated  yet I spent half of my lunch break waiting for it to be brought out. My biggest problem in both cases was the lack of accountability for error  in both instances an employee gave me an excuse that was clearly meant to distance the restaurant from the problem  rather than accept responsibility. Yesterday it was ""oh well the order just didn\'t print correctly"" (they showed me the slip and it printed just fine)  today ""your food isn\'t ready but it\'s being bagged up"" (took nearly 20 minutes to ""bag"" my food  clearly a lie). To BJ\'s: take responsibility for your errors and stop treating your customers like they\'re idiots. You get two stars because the food  when it finally arrives  is quite tasty  otherwise you\'d have 1 star."
Azn B.,Oakland  CA,621,156,139,5/30/2013,4.0,Although a short experience  the food here was pretty delicious. Just food done right.SERVICE was spectacular. The servers look like they were on drugs  I swear! The fast moving  the constant talking before I can even answer their first question  making sure they heard my requests even when my dinner date cut me off with a question. They were on point  other than the fact that they gave us this small little corner table that was an add-on and the seats & tables were like a foot shorter than the others. We asked to change tables and they were debating it with themselves. Another older couple sat on the same table after us and they just plain left. Plus they served us piping hot food and left us staring at it without utensils for  what seemed like  forever. Complete torture.FOODSoup of the Day - Clam Chowder. Flavors were good  but it was incredibly salty. Unbearably salty. Inedibly salty! I was super hungry so I finished it with all of my oyster crackers. My dinner date agreed that it was way too salty and did not want anymore of it.Baby Back Ribs  full rack. SO DELISH! Perfectly cooked ribs. They were moist and finger lickin'! I was super full and I still ate a couple more ribs because reheating it wouldn't do it justice. My only complaint is that they didn't sauce it enough while cooking. A couple of ribs on the ends didn't even touch BBQ sauce. I'm not a big BBQ sauce fangirl  but at least a smidgen of it is needed on ribs!Potato Skin. Probably one of the better potato skins that I've had. It's cut into small segments (I hate them when they're way too big to eat) and pops right into your mouth! They look like they're fried because it was super crunchy and crispy. Beer - Snakebite. Super cold  which makes it so much more delicious! Really clean flavors. Best thing was that it wasn't an overpriced beer!
Layla P.,Isla Vista  CA,0,11,,6/8/2016,1.0,Shout out to the girl who decided to charge me extra money on the tip last Friday on my graduation. On June 3rd  I came to BJs after my graduation around 12am and I sat in the second table on the middle right side in front of the restrooms. My waitress if I remember correctly was a white blonde (maybe platinum blonde) girl. I ordered 3 of the mini pazookies for my cousins and which costed around 10 dollars. Sure I apologize for not leaving a good tip BECAUSE I HAD NO MONEY IN MY ACCOUNT. I had enough money to just be able to pay for the pazookies which is why I chose to purchase it only. My money has been going to college. I'm not a rich girl who won't notice any extra charges to her account. This waitress probably decided to add a extra 6 dollars to my account and thought I wouldn't notice. My account was overdrawn because of her and if I did not catch it I would have been charged a extra 25 dollars from my bank because of this desperate girl who thought it was okay to do what she did. This is not OKAY at all. Beware coming here because you'll get screwed over. STOP going here and go to Lucille's BBQ instead since it is right by it. I've been going to Lucille's since they opened and nothing like this has ever happened to me!! I hope karma gives this girl what she deserves.
Penelope V.,Concord  CA,62,77,,8/26/2013,4.0,I am a creature of habit and always get the same thing when I come here. I LOVE their BBQ Chicken Salad. It never fails to fill me up. The fried onion on top  YUM! i'm sure it's not very healthy for you but ohhhh so good. I'm not a huge fan of beer so when i do order beer here it's always on the lighter/fruitier side. The wait never really bothers me too much  i don't think we've ever had to wait more than 25 mins for 3 people. I come here with my daughter and my boyfriend  the place is loud enough for my daughter to not get on anyone's nerves. And they have a good kids menu. I've never had a problem with their service. Everyone is friendly and helpful.
Maximilian R.,New York  NY,53,61,12,12/31/2012,2.0,The service was slow and the portions were meager at this place: here's why (below)---1. 3 of us sat at the high tables near the bar it took 8 minutes for a waiter to come and just set our silverware. 2. I ordered the lunch salmon with rice & vegetables  but the plate was more like rice and vegetables sprinkled with salmon. Seriously  this was weak. (the server did bring out a side of tortilla soup though to make up for the lack of salmon). 3. The rice and vegetables were not that good. I have have better fried peppers and onions before. 4. The Arnold Palmer that I ordered was barely sweet. I was definitely disappointed with that. The Tea to lemonade ratio was off for sure. The atmosphere is also loud  so you have to talk louder than usual to have a conversation with your company. Keep in mind  this is a high volume chain restaurant so they serve tons of people everyday. On that note  the food felt rushed and again  the service was slow too. This place might be good to grab a beer and watch Sunday football  but not too much else.
Tammy H.,Warren  MN,0,12,2,7/6/2015,2.0,Nice place always great food.  This location has poor customer service at the bar. Never a smile. Bartenders laughing and smiling amongst themselves but treating the customer like a nuisance. This is the second time now I've experienced this.
Shaneka S.,Emeryville  CA,27,144,64,9/3/2015,1.0,First.....I want to start off by saying they serve an awesome pink Cadillac and the pizza is good when it's hot.....I was here yesterday and the pizza was Hella good and hot.....the first pizza I got today was cold in the middle....the cheese wasn't even melted all the way....after one bite I sent it back and the waitress said I would get a new one.....she brought the same pizza out reheated.....she offered it to me while a new one was being made.....but I refused to eat it....because it looked overcooked......the replacement pizza was slightly hotter.....but the Italian sausage was cold smh......I waited Hella long to eat so I didn't send it back but I couldn't eat more than half because by that time it was super cold.....when she asked me how was it I told her the truth.....it was only a little better.....she offered nothing.....pizza still was on my bill.....on the bright side I had three pink caddy's while waiting.....had she taken the pizza off I would have gave her a tip....comparable to the price of the pizza.....it's not about the money or free food.....it is about quality and if the kitchen fucked up she should have taken it off my bill.....
Noelle N.,Vallejo  CA,50,21,,1/25/2013,3.0,"Wait: Two starsFood: Three starsService: Five stars Hubby and I went to BJ\'s Brewhouse tonight on a whim. His first visit  my third. The wait for a table was almost an hour  but I kept telling myself the food was worth the wait. After we were seated  it was another 8 - 10 minutes before our server could get to us  but when he did he was friendly and courteous. We ordered calamari  the roasted veggie flatbread and chicken fried steak with green salads. The calamari was done perfectly - the breading light and crisp  the meat tender and flavorful. The aioli had a delightful garlicky bite that balanced the mild flavor of the fish beautifully. The flatbread was very tasty  although the toppings were very uneven - an oversight that was easily rectified. Then we were served our main course. I love chicken fried steak  and eat it only on very rare occasions and dug in with gusto. The breading was beautiful  dark golden and crispy. I took a bite and paused tasting . . . . nothing. I added some salt and pepper - still nothing. When our waiter came back  I explained the situation to him. He was immediately apologetic  offered us an alternative entree  and assured us that he would ask the manager to ""take care of it."" (And it was - far above and beyond what we expected) Their house-brand sodas are very good  the cheddar mashed potatoes were delicious. Aside from the chicken fried steak my only critique is the house salad which was straight out of a 1950\'s diner. Iceberg lettuce  cucumber  tomato  julienned carrots and croutons. BORING. Overall  a good experience."
Shazz S.,Antioch  CA,3,6,,12/28/2014,3.0,I love the food here but if your not sitting at the bar and you have a party of more than one be prepared to spend 1hr before your food is ready horrible with time!
Anna G.,Napa  CA,42,23,6,6/22/2014,5.0,"Earlier today I started raving on an internal survey after signing up for mobile pay with Bj\'s  and realized I really needed to share my experience here. I was ""that person"" arriving late with my sister for a Saturday night late for a quick bite... and by late I mean the restaurant looked like it was closing down. Shame on us  but we couldn\'t have been treated better by the staff. I had to do some searching for our servers name ( Will Hoss ) but I defiantly recommend sitting in his section if you want to feel like a VIP!!! We ordered a build your own pizza with the recommendation of our server! AMAZING to say the least."
Olivia S.,Pittsburg  CA,0,2,,12/16/2015,1.0,If I could give no stars I would  I went last week on a Thursday night and my server (Kayla) wasn't pleased at all to have us. She didn't smile once and was very unprofessional. Never checked up on me . Not sure if this is her first serving job but she DEFINITELY needs more training. The food was good but not worth it for this service. Won't be returning .
Zack R.,Lafayette  CA,16,2,,6/23/2014,1.0,I have loved BJs since we lived in Orange County 10 years ago  but the poor service and food quality at the Concord location have killed it for me :( maybe they will clean house and fix it
Brandi W.,Walnut Creek  CA,586,539,624,10/6/2010,1.0,Everything was way below my expectations. The waiter seemed to be trying too hard to get a good tip. Strangely enough  he kept winking at me at the end of every sentence. I felt really uncomfortable and slightly creeped out  but I tried to ignore it. The lunch specials are fairly cheap  but you get what you pay for. The soup was too salty  the Caesar salad was bland  and the pizza was just awful. The dough didn't seem to be cooked enough. It was the mini size  so I suppose I should feel lucky I didn't order the large. It arrived to the table lukewarm  and by the time I was halfway through it was cold  the cheese was rubbery  and I was not at all satisfied. Maybe I'm just picky  but if I order pizza  I expect it to arrive at the table piping hot  almost to the point where it burns your mouth. If I wanted cold food  I would have ordered a cold entree. The waiter didn't even refill my soda until we were done with our meal. What was the point of that? If you want slow service and a sub-par meal  then this would be the place for you. The menu features about 2 pages of beer and yet another of booze. So almost half of the menu is just alcohol. Now I know why. Maybe if I had been drunk  I would have actually enjoyed my food.
Andy M.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,6,1,2/3/2015,4.0,I frequented another BJ's location when I lived in Irvine a few years ago. It was one of the better restaurants if you wanted to be able to hear conversation. This one has a bit more of a sport's bar vibe  but all the same; the food is great and the prices are reasonable.
Randy P.,Concord  CA,0,6,6,2/3/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,"I did get a response back from BJ\'s I will certainly go back and give it a try!Dear Randy:I would like to personally apologize for your recent unsatisfactory experience at BJ\'s in Concord. There is never an excuse for poor service and we take your comments very seriously. I am very sorry for the experience that you had here with the appetizers and us not taking them off the bill. I have already followed up with our team to ensure that corrective action has been properly taken. We sincerely appreciate your taking the time to call us and let us know. This gives us the opportunity to apologize to you and to learn from our mistakes.Your loyalty is very important to BJ\'s. We never forget that you have many choices for your dining experiences and that it\'s our responsibility to earn the privilege of serving you. Please accept the emailed $25 courtesy card  not offered as an excuse or compensation for poor service  but offered with the hope that you will give us another chance to ""wow"" you with better service.Thank you again for taking the time and trouble to contact us  and for bringing this issue to our attention.Sincerely "
Jared P.,Benicia  CA,24,11,2,6/12/2014,1.0,Terrible service. Went in on a slow Tuesday night for happy hour & waited 11 minutes for anyone to stop and acknowledge us at our table (the manager walked by 5 times doing nothing). Once served  part of our order was forgotten and still on the bill (even though I let the waitress know) & took another 15 minutes to get my check so at that point I didn't want to wait another 15-20 minutes for that to get adjusted and just paid the full amount. I would not return here unless changes are made!!
Stewart B.,Castro Valley  CA,12,256,134,7/1/2013,4.0,We have come here a few times and we enjoy the food and beer. I am a big fan of Big Poppa Smokers and heard recently that BJ's was using some of BPS recipes for there Blue Ribbon BBQ. Big Poppa won the Royal Oak last year  so good BBQ was to be expected.The Baby Back Ribs with the SWEET MONEY CHAMPIONSHIP rub were awesome. That rub really is Money. We also tried the Fries with Jallelujah Seasoned Jalapeno Salt  WOW!We will be back!
JoAn R.,Oakland  CA,162,30,3,4/28/2013,3.0,This place is your typical chain brewery. Good beers and the food is ok. There is nothing on the main menu I would brag about. However  I do love the Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps on the appetizer menu. Its a bit pricey  so try it during happy hour (you get $2 off appetizers). The service here is usually good (not consistent).
Simon W.,Walnut Creek  CA,9,97,,11/5/2012,2.0,"Knowing it would be busy we called ahead from the Sun Valley Mall while we finished shopping and were told it would be a 30-35 minute wait for a table for 5. We killed another 25 minutes and turned up at the desk only to find that it was another 25 minute wait. Not the best ""call ahead"" service.The food and beer selection is pretty good with a huge menu. The jambalaya was ok but seemed to have been left under the hot lamp a little too long. One of our soups was forgotten as was our daughter\'s fries but the other meals were good. We heard the next table complaining that they were also missing a couple of items.I\'d recommend checking it out and if the wait is longer than a couple of minutes head down the street to Outback or the Elephant Bar.They need more staff on busy nights."
Jessicka L.,Pleasant Hill  CA,64,58,1,7/5/2012,4.0,Northern California  consider yourselves lucky. BJ's originated in so. Cal. (I used to go at least 1-2 times per week while living there) and  just like the Cheesecake Factory  it finally made its way to Concord and Livermore. Like I said...NorCal should be so lucky. Here's why:-If you don't like beer  BJ's will change your mind. Try the Jeremiah Red. You'll be wasted before you know it. -The service here has been phenomenal from the servers (not the hosts...they're terrible. Management should work on that). -The food selection can satisfy anyone. Seriously. Best appetizer? Spinach and Artichoke Dip. Best entree? I couldn't choose just one...But the gluten-free pizza is amaaaazing. So are the loaded baked potatoes. -You can't go wrong in a pubhouse setting. Sure  it can be noisy/busy  but as long as your server keeps you happy -- which he/she will -- the ambiance is pretty fun/inviting. Anyway  give BJ's a chance. I can promise you I've had far more experience than half these Yelpers and the Concord location is far superior in service than so. Cal. has ever been.
Sonia T.,Antioch  CA,0,4,,12/26/2015,3.0,I was there for dinner  my plate wasn't enough to make me full  it was very light plate and very pricy. I think it happens because they get busy n they don't know how much food should put on a plate. Like they are working in a dark place n cannot see how much food should be on a plate for an adult.....pricy   Not enough ...so i am not totally satisfied.
Butch P.,Pleasant Hill  CA,6,201,16,5/30/2013,4.0,I wish they 3.5 star rating because that is how I feel about BJ's. Mixed. My wife and I go there on weekends and sit at the bar. We usually get great service from Natalie and the rest of the staff. The beer selection is great! They offer at least 30 on tap.TV's at the bar and throughout the restaurant-also great. Service in the restaurant? Iffy..Sometimes it's good and others it is just bad. Never rude but they just seem overwhelmed at times. Now the food. Also mixed. we love the ahi poke and the flatbread pizzas. The ahi is good quality and they serve with won ton chips (you can ask for lettuce cups too). The flatbreads have a light and crispy crust. Their boneless wings never work for me. I ask for the hottest sauce they have and extra on the side. it just isn't that hot and I am not a glutton for punishment  either. And the wings almost always don't come out hot as if they have been sitting in the window for 8 or 10 minutes. I don't get it. the menu is HUGE! I guess it is true-when you try to be good at everything  you are rarely good at anything..Sit at the bar  enjoy a cold one. they have multiple happy hours throughout the day. Watch the 49ers or Giants on their huge flat screens. Cheers!
Candy R.,San Francisco  CA,146,40,5,6/18/2012,2.0,"Perhaps because we decided to patron BJ\'s in Concord on Father\'s Day  our experience left a lot to be desired!!!We walked into the lobby that was overflowing with people and no order! We decided to call ahead as stated by them  ""Call ahead and wait less time!"" - NOT TRUE!!! When we checked in the hostess told us 20mins. After waiting over 30mins in the stifling heat because the lobby was bombarded with people waiting  I checked back in to find out what was going on...they told me another 45mins!!! WTF??? OK  I get it! It\'s Father\'s Day; it\'s going to be crazy but jeez!!!The wait was one thing and I understand. But the food was NOT GOOD at best!!! We are a family of big body eaters and every single one of us had left overs due to lack of quality in taste! Pizzas were bland and dry! The salads were a bit too tart for our taste and the baby back ribs were dry!!!The worst part was that I had my 3 year old son\'s food didn\'t come out until everyone else was done with their meals! We ended up feeding him from our plates. By the time his food came he didn\'t want it anymore! The server stated that someone stole his plate off of the food line! Really? And yet  it took over 20mins more to get mini corn dogs and fries out to a child? I\'m adamant about good customer service. BJ\'s extended no hospitality to rectify our experience of poor quality of food and lack of customer service!I\'ll stick to what I know...BJ\'s in my hood always comes through. I may give Concord another shot if and when it isn\'t a day dedicated to special people but until then....BOOOOOOO!!!"
Andrew I.,Pittsburg  CA,472,221,394,2/15/2013,4.0,I come here for beer  TV  appetizer  pizza  and burger. I've come here with 2 people and with 10 people. If you make a reservation  you won't be waiting for a table  they'll sit you asap. However  come here on a busy night and you'll be waiting for a while.I really like their beer selection here! Lots of mixed beers  you have to try!! Also they have good size pizza  for a slightly more expensive price than the average. They use a lot of bread on the pizza  unless you get the flat  rectangular ones which are my favorites. Service is always great here  and I never noticed the long waiting for food time  because most of the time I'm just too busy with the beer  watching TV  or having a great conversation. So a really nice place to chill  but not if you're in a hurry. They have a large dining area  decent patio area (it's shaded)  and a good size bar area where you can just walk in a seat yourself. usually though the bar area gets filled first and fast. You can order the same food anywhere you sit. The lighting of this place is kind of really dim  but the booths are comfortable  the space is adequate  and they keep their bathrooms clean. Perfect for large groups or just get loud with friends.
Diane E.,Los Angeles  CA,297,1066,28,6/3/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Okay  I'm giving them 2 stars back. Came here today for a 'going away' lunch with my gym pals (who says you can't make friends with people at the gym when you go at 2:30 a.m.???) and lunch today was phenomenal. So are my friends who I will miss terribly after I move to Indy.Two of us had the Grilled Fish Tacos...what can I say other than YUMMY!!! Another had the Grilled Salmon and the fourth had the Mini Veggie Pizza. All were reasonably priced on the Lunch Special menu. Waiter was attentive without hovering. We never felt rushed although they were very busy.The trick with this place is to either go BEFORE the noon rush or well after. If you are a beer drinker  beer/ale is $3 at lunch. I didn't partake because I'm not a beer drinker...and some of us had to go back to work :-)I kind of hope there is a BJ's in Indianapolis...
Samuel R.,La Jolla  San Diego  CA,107,29,48,5/14/2014,2.0,Food is mediocre at best only reason worth going is the pizzokie.. and it's slightly over priced
Gregg W.,Martinez  CA,5,21,1,11/12/2012,1.0,Went at about 5 pm  Monday  November 12. Restaurant was busy but by no means full. Appeared to be plenty of wait staff. And yet  after 20 minutes no one even brought me water much less took my order. So I walked out. Based on other reviews and tips  be prepared for a long wait for your server.
Megan M.,Pleasant Hill  CA,54,52,,10/6/2012,3.0,"Pretty much what you expect from a chain brewery restaurant. I LOVE their hot wings. The stuffed mushrooms are good too and their flatbread pizzas aren\'t too bad. Last time I was there I opted for the avocado egg rolls and they were awful. after a few mouth fulls of luke warm avocado mush I just couldn\'t stomach anymore. If you LOVE avocado maybe these would be good. I like avocado but no the baby food texture. They need to mix some crunch in there. Ended up eating some of he beef sliders my husband got and I was pretty impressed a how good they were.In the past I\'ve gotten the shrimp lettuce wraps  which weren\'t too bad and low calorie. Trouble was the shrimp was barely cooked. When we asked about it they said that is how the dish is supposed to be. They did cook our shrimp some more  but I haven\'t ordered it since because I don\'t want to be that picky customer who\'s like ""can you really make sure the shrimp is cooked?""Good beer  good cocktails. Not the best happy hour  but we live close so I\'m sure we will back! Especially the next time I\'m craving hot wings!"
Rich P.,Antioch  CA,68,654,133,7/1/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,So  this is an update to my last review. Everything about my last review still stands - good food  good beer. Try their IPA and/or the Nit Wit - very good.Why the downgrade? Service. It was atrocious. The drinks came quick  which was nice. We ordered our food (two mini pizzas and a salad). It took 30min for the salad and another 40min for the pizza. During this time we heard nothing from our server. He was too busy with the group of 15ppl that had been seated in his section.When our food finally arrived  it was cold. It took another 5min for the server to get us some ranch. I get that the guy was busy  but at least check in or ask a co-worker/manager for some help.
Rose P.,Elk Grove  CA,11,16,,5/4/2014,2.0,"Let me qualify this review by stating that I have worked as a hostess and a server before  and so I know how difficult and chaotic the job can be. That said  this place really needs to tighten its gears when it comes to service. Most disorganized place I have been to in quite a while. A friend was visiting from Sac and we went here just this afternoon for a late lunch/early dinner. Neither of us know much about the restaurants in this area  but we\'ve been to various BJ\'s before and find them to be fairly dependable as far as food is concerned. We also know  from previous experience  that service can be pretty spotty depending the location and how busy it is  but this one took the cake. When we walked in the door  the manager and a host were standing at the host stand and the manager had to tell the host to stop talking to another employee and take care of us first. He left  and rather than seating us in the dining area or letting us know that there was a short wait for tables (it wasn\'t packed  but they only seemed to be seating in one area of the dining room)  she asks us instead to check out the bar area because it was open seating. This wasn\'t a giant deal (just a little jarring) so we checked out the bar area but found no booths available. We went back to the stand  and they were in the process of seating a group of 3 people in the dining area  so apparently there were free tables available. There were also plenty of tables open in the patio area  so I\'m not really sure why the first thing they recommended was for us to seat ourselves at the bar. In the end  because it was a nice day  we chose to sit outside. They have a pretty large patio area  and at the time  there were only three small tables occupied (two couples and a group of 3 girls)  but we still had to wait for them to wipe a table down before we could sit. While they\'re wiping the table down  the host seating us said  ""oh  let me get some silverware""--this will come into play later--and goes to fetch them. We\'re seated  and a couple of minutes later  our server comes to take our drink orders (two coffees  a water  a diet). She brings the drinks to us but has to make a second trip for sugar and cream for the coffee. We order our entrees. I can\'t say how long it took the food to make an appearance as we weren\'t in any particular hurry  but it did seem longer than our usual experience. My friend had a cheeseburger and fries. I ordered the fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the gravy on the side. When they put the plate down in front of me  I didn\'t know what to think. It was probably the blandest presentation of fried chicken ever (and I love fried chicken). The two breast pieces were much smaller than I anticipated  more brown than gold  and were just lying on top of a mound of mashed potatoes--this was everything on the plate. Luckily  they tasted better than they looked  but you eat first with your eyes  and it was not a sight that whet my appetite  to say the least. Furthermore  that silverware I mentioned earlier? They apparently never made it on to the table  so we had to flag another server down in order to get a fork for my mashed potatoes. We hadn\'t seen our server for a while  at this point  though she did reappear shortly after the other one went inside. There were just a lot of little things like this that overall gave the impression that no one in this place has it together. In addition to the above  about ten minutes after we were seated and while we were waiting for our drinks to appear  another server came to our table to ask if we\'d already been helped. On the one hand  it\'s nice that she thought to make sure  but on the other  shouldn\'t every server know which table belongs to who  rather than everyone having to follow up with all the customers to make sure no one is being ignored/forgotten about? Also  in the time that we were there  three different times  food runners came out asking each table if they happened to order the dish they were carrying--they had no idea what food was supposed to go to what table. (Keep in mind that there were only five tables there after another couple sat down  and three of them were already in the middle of their meal or finished.)To her credit  our server was friendly as was everyone else. It was just the general feeling of disorganization and chaos that really marred the experience. Hopefully they can fix these issues."
Monica B.,Clayton  CA,9,87,39,6/14/2014,1.0,"Ugh.... not good.What has happened to BJs? We came at an odd time today for lunch (2:30) and were seated right away. Love when that happens  but it was all downhill from there. The runner brought our appetizer without plates. He ran off before we could ask him for some. Our calamari was mostly the tentacles - you know  the spinely part of the squid. Then our entrees came out. The pork chop was really dry and hard to cut. Thank goodness I asked for the sauce on the side because it was cold and sickeningly hot/spicy. I would not have been able to eat the pork chop if it was served with the sauce on it. It came with green beans and red potatoes which were very dry/over cooked. My son thought he ordered a large baked potato  but we found out when they brought out his tiny  overcooked potato that they don\'t make those anymore. He also ordered a side of broccoli which was in a tiny dish where the broccoli was covered with dried out carrots. There were a total of four tiny pieces of broccoli in the dish. The pizza was disappointing - I would say a tad bit better than microwave pizza. This was their normal crust - the deep dish pizza that some of the other diners had looked more promising.Service was poor. Our empty appetizer plate stayed on our table the whole time  server forgot to refill my husband\'s tea when she said she would be ""right back"". Server rarely came by and never removed any of our plates."
Marissa F.,Martinez  CA,157,21,4,11/22/2014,2.0,I have been here multiple times & never had a problem until tonight. Everyone always tells Me about how much they can't stand this restaurant & I never understood until tonight. We came in on a Friday night at about 7pm & were told it would be a 30-35 minute & that they were out of buzzwords but she took my # & would call me when our table we ready so we went into the mall. 45 minutes past & I called & was told it would be another 10 mins so when another 45 minutes past we finally just went back in & the hostess argued w/ me saying they had called me a while ago for about 10 mins & no 1 responded & the girl who took my # just have just deleted it. I was so pissed that I will never return back. I now see what everyone has been saying.
Natan O.,San Francisco  CA,172,73,,5/12/2013,2.0,Going to a chain restaurant there are some things that you have to expect coming in...the vibe is usually the same across the board and the food is usually mediocre / semi decent. While BJ's met the vibe expectation  the food did not.I was impressed by the cleanliness of the restaurant and prompt service. The wait staff was spot on and they were very friendly. These positive statements were unfortunately overshadowed by the sub-par food. I ordered the California chicken sandwich  and if it weren't for the fact that i was starving I would not have finished it. The bread was soggy  chicken dry  avocado stale and just didn't taste great. French fries were clearly frozen and tasteless. The blonde ale I ordered was the only thing that got me through my meal.I will never come back to BJ's unless it's just to get drinks.
Sunny T.,Antioch  CA,64,43,8,8/4/2014,2.0,I think you need to be friends with the staff to get service here. Our food was good our server did not care if we enjoyed it or not she also really never checked back to see if we needed anything or bothered to refill our drinks I think Stacey was more into the table of boys than a table of mother daughter even though I am a great tipper I feel like it was undeserved I guess it would of helped if I was male.
Edrienne G.,Concord  CA,42,103,37,3/29/2013,3.0,I had a dirty fork and dirty knife  and apparently so did the table next to us because they complained about their utensils also.It took over an hour and a half to get two drinks and one pizookie. On a Wednesday night. -_____-I also ordered a pizookie to go  for my dad. She brought it out  and took the check  but came back like 15 mins later. by then  my dad's ice cream had already melted. They have good food here  but the service sucks.
Jon G.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,33,2,10/4/2012,1.0,0 STARS!A couple of these Yelp! reviews mentioned that BJ's carried NFL Sunday Ticket so I stopped in this last Sunday to watch my team. The restaurant was busy  but there wasn't a long wait and me and my roommate sat in a booth in the bar.The booth itself had not been bused from the last customers  but we were advised that we should take it before someone else does. I had to flag the manager down 10 minutes after sitting down to request that my table be bused. The server arrived 5 minutes later to give us menus without taking our drink order. When she returned she took our drink order and our food order and I proceeded to wait 30 min before getting my beer. I actually got my food before either my roommate or myself got our bar drinks.The burger I ordered was cooked right but was bland and the sauces I had requested on the side did not come with the burger  I had to ask AGAIN to get them. The water that I drank while waiting for my beer sat empty during the entire meal.On top of all of this  BJ's double charged my debit card. I am really not a picky person when it comes to restaurants as long as the food is alright and the service isn't horrendous. Our server spent more time flirting with the old guys at the table next to us than she did trying to make sure our experience was at all reasonable.Horrible service  unimpressive food and time spent reversing an extra charge. Will not return.
Frank and Carol P.,Martinez  CA,36,43,8,5/28/2012,2.0,Underwhelmed. Came here for lunch today  ordered the deep dish Chicago style pizza. I wasn't served deep dish Chicago style pizza. I was served an inch and a half of sponge like bread dough with a thin layer of toppings with almost no red sauce. The pizza was dry. A Chicago style pizza should have a nice hand tossed pizza crust  many layers of tasty toppings  cheese a thick layer of red sauce  and another sprinkle of cheese. Chicago style pizza this was not.So  if you're by Sun Valley Mall and you're craving good pizza  drive down the street four blocks and go to Melo's Pizzeria. If you are craving really good pub/grill restaurant go to Jack's in Pleasant Hill. It's not a chain restaurant  the staff is happy to see you  and the food is so much better for the same price.
Bobby H.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,4,,1/1/2015,1.0,This is our second time here. I swore I wouldn't go back to BJs again. Last time was about 3 years ago and again last night 12/31/14.Both times we found hair in the food!! YUK!!! And the service was unprofessional. Was ignored  the waiter was just standing around. Took a long time to get our beverages. The runner served us better than our waiter. We wanted to complain about the hair in the food and asked to talk to the Manager. The Manager never came  he was to busy kissing a female.The bar service is fantasic though. We had to go up to the bar to order our own cocktails.we were taken care of right away and headed back to our table.
Gina H.,Concord  CA,153,397,35,12/5/2010,4.0,A-Okay with me! Our server was quite nice to us this afternoon. It was a wet wet day and we didnt want to take our litle one out anywhere far... with the options among us we chose to come here for the first time as we knew the selection of food we could choose from would be plentiful. Despite the rain  our service was excellent. We were seated promptly and given a chance to settle in with our little one. Our server was very nice and recommded certain beers for my sig other while giving us a children menu and crayons for our little guy. We ordered a small BJ pizza and the meatloaf sandwich... not really knowing what to expect. He even gave us the mashed potatoes and applesauce for our little one on the house. What a great guy. I had a great time there. He was busy with other tables but made sure we were taken care of. Our food came out in good time  not the best  but I dont know how busy they really were as we were in a booth where you couldnt see much.I recommend this place if you have kids  its very family friendly . The prices are a bit steep for the appetizers... they cost the same as an entree so we nixed that step and went right to the food.The deep dish pizza  OMG  so good! It reminded me of Zachary's in Oakland's Rockridge area...since Zachs is a bit of a drive now  if we are feenin' for a lil Chicago style pizza  we may just zoom on thru to BJ's. The meatloaf was really good  needed some spicing up so I asked for Tabasco and the mashed potatoes could use a bit more butter and seeasoning as well but hey its not a 5 star place right?I would be back  probably for the pizza and to watch a game some time soon!
Stephanie H.,Hercules  CA,112,37,12,10/10/2012,1.0,Food was okay. Drinks were okay but expensive. No happy hour?? Maybe I wasn't informed that there was one.BUT I want to review our waitress of that night. I wish I could remember her name BUT I will just say SHE CAN NOT COUNT OUR MONEY THAT WE PUT WITH BILL TO PAY with rest on card!! Apparently  she didn't realize that she put the majority of our money out of the way when counting so my friend got over charged on his debit card. We told her and she corrected it. Couple days later  he realize they didn't reverse his charge on his card  talked to the manager and told him to file a claim/fraud with the bank to get his money back. WTF KIND OF SERVICE IS THAT?!!!IM NEVER GOING TO EAT THERE IF IM WITH PAYING CARD!! FRAUD!! Lesson learned: PAY WITH CASH!Also we waited like over 30 minutes for our dessert of pizookie. Boo this place! Hire new waiters or something.
A D.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,14,4,11/3/2012,1.0,I'm not even gonna give you a review on their food because no matter what you order  if you receive bad service.....it leaves a bad taste in your mouth altogether!I always have bad experience of SERVICE at BJ's. I don't know if that's how they train their staff  but this place had terrible service.Our waitress took our order....she had help serving the food since we were a big party. After that I never saw her again until one of my nieces had to get up herself and direct her to our table. She never even came back to see if we needed anything else. Somehow  we always have to wait at BJ's for additional items we might need for our meals.....never fails! We ordered dessert cause we had to wait for our other party to finish their meal....our waitress took our order and you would think at that point she should've emptied our meal plates to prepare for our dessert.....but no she failed to do that as well. Then she served our dessert and she still didn't take our meal plates away which at that point  I just pushed in the middle of the table. It was an awful experience. Our waitress thought she was gonna get a good tip from us....we were a party of 12 and to my husband's disappointment again at BJ's....he left her with no tip at all! My husband is a good tipper....he'll even tip our donut place $10 for a dozen of donuts  but this time....she could've received a good size amount of tip especially for our large party. TO OUR WAITRESS......you never know who you're gonna be serving......that's too bad!P.S......I know the logistics of being a Server since I was a waitress myself as my part time job while in school and my husband was a Chef. Other bad experience at BJ's....Daly City and Brentwood.....WTH....does BJ's train their servers this way!
Tam F.,San Ramon  CA,488,1397,252,4/5/2010,2.0,"I would definitely like this place better if I were a beer drinker or was out with girlfriends and wanted to try one of their fruffy drinks  but alas  I was here with the family for lunch and it was pretty meh.The place is like a sports bar/pub/chain restaurant rolled into one. I think as they have expanded the chain and what I can assume the menu  there has been a lot lost on the food but probably made up for in the drinks (or maybe they depend on the drinks to numb the taste buds?). We were seated right away on a semi late lunch for a Saturday afternoon and our server pounced on our table immediately to take our drink order and ask if we wanted an appetizer. While I appreciated her enthusiasm  I was a bit put off at the rushing feeling I had with her approach. I advised her it was our first time at the restaurant and it would take us a bit to figure out their large menu and she just shrugged and said ""oh  okay"". I think I am used to more savvy servers or something. We perused through the extensive menu and husband ordered a mini pizza( he was the smartest of the bunch) as the rest of the offerings were a mix between Cheesecake Factory and Claim Jumper rolled into one (but with smaller portion sizes). Daughter had shrimp tacos and I had a chicken club sandwich on sort of soggy bread that came with burnt bacon bits on the sandwich instead of nice strips of bacon. The fries that came with my sandwich were the best part of my meal  but the lack of service put me over the edge. I still don\'t get how servers can bring fries and not bring ketchup or even ask if any is needed? The waitress did not come to check on us until the meal was more than half way eaten and asked if we would be wanting dessert. I inquired as to how the bacon was supposed to come on the sandwich and she said it came to me the wrong way and asked if I would like something else. I declined that as well as dessert and she brought us the bill -all charges intact. Had I been paying and not husband  her tip would not have been so generous...We won\'t be back to this chain as there are others more worthy."
Joshua C.,Walnut Creek  CA,9,142,64,7/6/2014,4.0,I'm not a big fan of Chain Restaurants. Too much formula & usually average to below average food  however BJ's has some delicious dishes as does Pasta Pomadoro. Not eating pizza just now  but BJ's is good. Not Emilias or Cheese Board in Bezerkeley quality  but good. I also love their Poke Appetizer  with its homemade chips. At least I think they're homemade because I can't find them anywhere. I'm not a big beer drinker  however their beers  the many on tap & in bottles are some of the finest. And my fave bartender  JC  served me today. My initials too!
Jack P.,San Ramon  CA,21,318,314,8/9/2014,3.0,This is a large chain place. Good but not outstanding food and service in most locations. Better service if you eat at the bar. Open late night so good standby if your hungry and want a brew - large selection of beers on tap. Good prices. I like the chilli and a beer as a night cap.
Melyssa G.,Bethel Island  CA,40,187,306,7/9/2010,3.0,I've only been here twice. I did enjoy my personal pizza and salad lunch meal for $5.99. The service was slow that day  and I think it's because we had a big party and many of us ordered pizzas. I can understand the pizzas taking longer to bake.I went there again with my fam of 3 and a friend on the night of July 4th. I was surpised that they were open so kudos for them. We ordered drinks since we were parched. The lemonade was a bit icky  even my 4 y/o said it tasted funny.We decided to order the 3 mini pizookies. OMG that took forever. We waited and waited and waited. How long does it take to bake 3 tiny cookies? It wasn't even busy when we first got there.The 2 guys sitting at a table next to us just got up and left because no one was taking there order. I don't blame them  they did wait while.We finally got our pizookies 40min later. Are you freakin serious? All I know is that if you're going there for the pizza or pizookie  be prepared to wait a LONG while whether it's busy or not.
Vanessa K.,East Bay  CA,131,1005,485,12/18/2012,3.0,Came to watch the UCLA v. Stanford game at the bar. Our waiter was really nice and service was good. I used to love BJ's while in college  but no matter which location I go now  it's just not the same. Is it me or is the food lacking and depreciating? Also ordered the p'zookie afterwards and I was disappointed that the cookie dough wasn't spread all over the pan. I felt I was scammed a few bites.
Gina S.,East Bay  CA,787,70,1232,6/10/2010,5.0,I can't decide whether to give it a 4 or 5 stars. My friend and I come here practically every weekend after we get our mani/pedi done from My Nails and have to order the spinach & artichoke dip. That is sooo yummy  especially when the nachos are hot. Then we order the strawberry lemonade and some entree. I have tried THAI SHRIMP LETTUCE WRAPS  MAC N CHEESE  SHRIMP SKEWERS  MEDITERRANEAN DEEP DISH PIZZA  TURKEY BURGER  GRILLED CHICKEN PASTA  CHARDONNAY SHRIMP PASTA  CHICKEN WINGS  GRILLED CHICKEN PESTO FLATBREAD  CALAMARI  CLAM CHOWDER  AND BJ'S FAMOUS PIZOOKIE. Man  I didn't realize I've tried so many dishes already. But I guess when you have been coming every weekend for the past 2-3 months  you're bound to try a lot on their menu. Some of the dishes are on the salty side so if you're watching your sodium intake or on a diet  don't order the pizzas or pastas or read the back of the menu. You won't order 3/4 of the menu. So if I really like something  I just order it.When we go there  we usually go to the bar area so we don't have to wait. The wait can get ridiculous especially at night. Better to hit this place up after lunch. The waiters/waitresses are great. We always get this waiter who has a DJ voice or more like he's interviewing for an auctioneer or a voice-over. LOL. He's hilarious. Last weekend  I ordered an appetizer and a flatbread and they came at the same time. I like my appetizers before the meal so that I can have take-home for dinner. LOL. Anyway  I love the atmosphere and the pleasant vibes from the customers. The food is the best in the Concord area for sure and when you're done  you can walk it off at the mall. After all that  I WILL give it five stars after all!!!!!
Lynn S.,San Francisco  CA,9,20,16,3/12/2014,4.0,A broad selection on the menu. I had the Hawaien Mahi Mahi and my husband had the Parmesan crusted chicken. Both were delicious. Service was good as well. Bottomless mocktails.
Elizabeth G.,Clayton  CA,7,18,13,8/21/2014,4.0,We went here on a saturday night with my parents who have never been here before  so we sat in the bar area where it was open seating our server was William he was awesome and very knowledgable with menu he had great suggestions with the food and drinks. My dad is very particular with imported beer and hates to try new things but he knew exactly the beer that would suit him he was a happy man. The food was awesome and came out on time  i had a peachy-kean  it was way to sweet for me so i will stick with beer next time. So thank you WIlliam for the excellent experience my parents had a blast.
Timothy T.,Concord  CA,85,18,3,10/27/2014,3.0,Here at BJ's in this location services a bit choppy depending on where you sit within the restaurant doing to get great service or very poor service I feel that they do training in part of that store and they train on us the customer that being said they do have great food and I feel the clam chowder is a plus!!
Deniel P.,Walnut Creek  CA,21,25,,8/20/2014,5.0,GREAT place!!! love the pazookie!!!!!
Hylynly L.,Vallejo  CA,33,11,48,2/11/2014,4.0,love the appitizers & desserts. The entrees & pizza are good too but not for the price. The customer service is always a hit or miss. Ive been here many times and had awful service. But thank goodness our server (alexander?) today is really nice & attentive.
D R.,Martinez  CA,1,75,,3/21/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,We were so impressed with the food and service from our first visit we came back days later for dinner.I had a personal deep dish pizza and hubby had fish and chips.I'm a little confused about the service here  one waitress comes to take your order  another comes to check on your drinks  then another comes to bring the food??? confusing and we had to wait for refills and extra sauces (quite a long time).Our food came out and frankly I was so hungry from the long wait that I ate my pizza anyway when I should have sent it back. It was cold and rubbery like it was sitting under the heat lamp for quite a while.Hubby didn't care for the fish and chips.Don't know if they just had a bad night or if our good first experience was just luck...ehhh
Brandon F.,Hercules  CA,958,66,23,4/1/2014,4.0,BJ's is a chain. The pizza was great  and they have a nice selection of beer. I would come here again to watch a basketball game and munch.
Eric B.,Pleasant Hill  CA,2127,5344,4760,1/27/2010,4.0,"Gayle had a long day at work and came home just wanting to relax  talk  and be served across a nice table. She also wanted something that was not too pricey  casual  and close  and decided to try out the relatively new and nearby BJ\'s.Gayle and I thought that BJ\'s was very good for what it is. The location used to be Houlihan\'s in the Sun Valley Mall. And they\'ve done a nice job with the interior. It has a nice night club meets brew pub feel  and features nice woods  cool bar lighting  flat screen TVs  comfy booths and decent acoustics for good conversation. The interior of this BJ\'s is also much classier than the one in Southern California that I had previously been.We were promptly seated and for this Tuesday night  the place was full but not overcrowded. We both thought that the table service was friendly and accommodating  although the actual kitchen coordination was a bit slow.As for the food  my pulled pork sandwich was delicious and it went very well with the creamy stout that I ordered. Gayle had less luck with her fish tacos. The menu mentioned that they were lightly breaded  but I don\'t think she was expecting a fish stick wrapped up in a tortilla. In hindsight  Gayle would have ordered the grilled shrimp.I will be back  as I like these sort of ""guy"" places. Gayle is not so sure  except maybe to take one of her sons out for a meal. We also left speculating what additional dining options might be possible in the former Left Bank space within Downtown Pleasant Hill.Postscript: After we got home  Gayle mentioned that she wanted some chocolate. My immediate response was ""After all that food?"" Apparently that was the wrong thing to say?"
Diana G.,Dublin  CA,68,85,9,8/3/2014,2.0,I decided on having BJs for lunch because of the gluten fee options. I was also able to use some rewards pints to make it cost less. While the service I received took awhile  it was with a smile. I like when I order take out for them to show me my food. I had to do it myself. It looked correct and went home to enjoy. I orderd 1/2 chicken bacon Ranch and 1/2 pepperoni with sausage; no onions no tomatoes on gluten free crust. There were onions! :(. I even checked the order on the box and it says no onions. Very disappointing... I'm now eating my gf pizooki and it's not fully cooked. I did not order cookie dough! Took another star off :-/
Grace Anne D.,Concord  CA,258,355,576,2/4/2010,1.0,This place is only good for drinks and to watch football games.I went there once for my friend's birthday dinner and I thought the place was gonna be good since everyone else said so. I was wrong. Horrible service  the waitress rolled her eyes more than once when we were paying and asking her for things. The prices are high  and I wasn't satisfied.
Katrina F.,Concord  CA,113,55,8,6/16/2014,1.0,Worst service ever . I gave this place two chances and will not return for a third . I was with my family for dinner to celebrate graduation for my son. What a nightmare. We all got the wrong food and my son never received his food . When it was finally corrected the manager came to our table to apologize and informed us that our one appetizer would be on the house after waiting over an hour for the food to be fixed . Let's me say this if you want over priced terrible service you are in the right place .
Adrian R.,Concord  CA,2,11,26,8/23/2014,1.0,Fu*k this place with an aids dyck..food taste disgusting and the people that work here suck from top to bottom..one star for the beer which is impossible to mess up but the rest of the crap here taste like dog shyt!
Daniel D.,Concord  CA,826,461,314,10/31/2012,4.0,"Well  BJ\'s in Concord surprised my girlfriend and I last Friday night with great service and food. We were able to get a table (it was still early) and had a great time.B R I E F S U M M A R Y-- Parking lot gets full because of the mall  BJ\'s and 24 hour fitness-- This is one of the ""smaller"" BJ\'s so it gets packed quick-- HUGE menu like cheesecake factory-- Specializes in beer and pizza but offers a lot more-- Lots of TV\'s to watch sports and a bar  of course-- Happy Hour is always a win here-- Not personally a fan of their deep dish or new hand toss thin crust-- Thin cut fries or wedge fries  no regular fries-- Service is hit or miss depending on your server-- Soup in their breadbowls are BOMB (most people don\'t even know about them)-- Calamari was very good  fresh & the tartar sauce was the best-- Most entree\' portions are HUGE-- Save room for a pizookie for dessert! (I prefer the glutten-free)I would have to say that BJ\'s is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants. I love pizza but rarely do I eat it here. Instead I\'m eating their appetizers like calamari or chicken wings (they also do boneless - not bad either)  their chili or tomato bisque in a their delicious bread bowl  or a burger. I actually prefer their calzones over their pizza  go figure!Last weekend  I could not pass up the offer to try their new hand tossed thin crust pizza. From the description and the photo it looked like a hand tossed pizza crust but when it came out it felt more like a crispy flat bread pizza. It also sucked that it wasn\'t cut very well so I had to hacksaw it with my dull butter knife. Despite the crust  the pizza toppings and flavors were all there. I ended up with the new chicken bacon ranch and subbed spinach for tomatoes. It was a decent pizza but I will not be ordering the hand tossed again.Before we had our entree\'s we tried their calamari. It was very good and fresh but I wanted to mention how great the tartar sauce was. It was the best tartar sauce I have ever ate. It was very fresh and refreshing. It completely balanced the fried calamari. We finished it in no time.I always find it hard to believe that some people have not heard of BJ\'s famous pizookie. It\'s a small circle pan with whatever choice of cookie you choose served hot with ice cream on top. I\'ve started to prefer the glutten free option because it\'s a lot lighter but still has all the flavor as the original pizookie. Don\'t miss out on this awesome dessert!I wish I would have remembered our server\'s name. He was seriously the best server we have ever had. There were moment when we needed him but he had that ""spider"" sense and would show up when we needed him. We were very please with the meal and makes me wish the San Bruno location was more like this one."
Sarah H.,Danville  CA,215,358,85,2/5/2010,3.0,"This is a busy  BUSY chain restaurant. If you call ahead  get in line to get your buzzy thing  go to the bar  have a drink  then another  then get lit up by your buzzy thing and head to a table  you can count yourself lucky. PARTICULARLY if you kept your buzzy thing in your pants pocket.I went in knowing the wait  and I was fine with it. When seated  it took me some time to peruse the ginormous Cheesecake factory-like menu to make my selections. I really want to return to this place (after maybe running a marathon  because the calorie counter they include at the back of the menu nearly had me in tears) to try more of their appetizers and drinks. That\'s really what stood out. Fried avacado eggrolls were great  made even MORE awesome by our fantastic (no really  super high energy  high level of service  attentive but hella busy perky blonde) server  who noted my aversion to cilantro  and had the dish made without it entirely. The ""deep dish pizza"" was lame. I got the buffalo chicken pizza hoping to share it with myself for lunch the next day  and I only ate one piece  and it was just meh. Dry yet greasy. Bland and uninteresting. MEH. I didn\'t even bother eating the rest that I boxed and took home  it was that meh. I just suppose I\'ve been spoiled by the Chicago style glory that is Zachary\'s.Points for ambiance  and impeccable service. Tipped hugely  because I remember vividly how shit it is to work a so-so location where you biggest tips rarely even out your walk-outs and stiffers. So go. Drink heartily  nom some apps  and don\'t bother with the pizza  seriously. You can have better."
Cristi S.,San Francisco  CA,87,25,2,7/14/2012,2.0,SUUUPPPER SLOW. I've been there several times now  and each time the service has been extremely slow. They have a very wide selection on the menu and the food is pretty good. However  the extremely long wait time between being greeted  getting drinks/food  and getting the check  has always annoyed my party and I. Honestly  for the price of the food and drinks  I'd rather just head a few miles down the road to Walnut Creek and go somewhere similar like Pyramid or Cheesecake factory so that I don't have to spend 3 hours on a meal...
Tim W.,Concord  CA,0,3,1,10/13/2013,2.0,Slow service. Pizza came with no sauce. All onions on one side..... Clam chowder was great. Pizza still tasted good even with our the sauce.... Manager computer the pizza.... Don't go here if you are in a hurry... .
Sean M.,San Francisco  CA,81,477,8,1/8/2012,2.0,Where the 1% don't eat. My first clue about what the food would be like was seeing two thirds of the men hunched over their plates while wearing their ball caps indoors. The women were blond  real and otherwise  loud and over weight. TVs all over with the Pittsburg-Denver game on. So  what to eat? I went with the chicken fried steak thinking that would be one of the better dishes. The gravy was peppery and covered only half of the steak.But  the server brought more for me to pour. The spuds were fine  nothing special  A's were the steamed veggies. The service was very good and earned my two stars and a decent tip. I might give this chain another chance  if my only other choice was a Applebees or a Mickey D's.
Sarah S.,Santa Cruz  CA,0,5,,5/24/2016,4.0,i always get the best beginners! and always finish with an oreo ice cream cookie
Ashley L.,Walnut Creek  CA,23,38,12,5/31/2012,2.0,Came here with my ECE 250 classmates as a celebration of the last night of class. Very nice restaurant  nice flow to it  dim lighting  TVs  etc. The food was ok. A classmate and I shared a pizza and some pot stickers. The pizza we got was Chicago style  but that's not what we got. We got a soggy crust with minimal toppings. Chicago style has the sauce on top of the toppings. The pot stickers were good though. 3 of us shared a dessert which was delicious.I've been to other upscale restaurants and experienced way better customer service though. I mean I understand it was busy and we were the biggest crowd   but you need to keep up. I mean we got our appetizer at the same time as the entree... isn't it suppose to be appetizer  then entree? Afterward  when we all started to leave   got our check put some money in an waited for change. I had to ask for my change. The waitress wrongly assumed the change was her tip. WOW! That's a big no no. You give the customer their change and let them decide your tip. Overall   the BJ's looks nice  has some good food  but they really really need to work on their customer service and give their waiters/waitresses some training. I don't really see myself coming back here. I think this place is more for sports lovers with all the TVs they got.
Shannon H.,Brentwood  CA,749,1029,606,12/29/2009,4.0,Mmm....Do I love this place!I have been anxious to try B J's (what a name) since they opened as well as my friend  so we decided to have a pre new years celebration for the year to come  before the year to come and we celebrated it here.The atmosphere of this place is really aesthetically pleasing -very classic brewery style  with the dark cherry wood throughout along with the cool dimmed lighting and the lively atmosphere creates a great place for get togethers.A little loud for private parties or dates  unless you're not into your date and you want to be distracted as possible this is the place  over all classy and clean.So being the pre planner I am  I will pickup menus form places before hand or go online to look over menus before arriving (funny I know) so they had a menu online  I scanned over there delicious looking menu before departing only to arrive knowing exactly what I would sink my teeth into  I also didn't want to have to overwhelm my waiter with the thousand of questions I would have asked... Just saving time... : )So for Starters my gf and I had there pomegranate martins (which I had been anxiously waiting to try) my friend also agreed with me on my pre planned decision of the great white deep dish pizza  Which is creamy Alf redo sauce  white chicken  garlic  parmesian cheese and thick succulent tomatoes (we shared a small) which was more then enough.Martinis took a little while to arrive but worth the little wait -pretty in presentation and excellent in taste and might I add very nerve calming: ) So this was my first time trying a deep dish pizza and what a great first impression it had with the most flavorful personality ever! This pizza had it ALL!! Rich creamy Alf redo sauce  thick moist chunks of white chicken flavored with garlic topped with yummy parmesian cheese ohh!! And did I mention the thick chewy drenched in butter  soft to perfection thick crust (yes I know so bad) but out of this world good!! I literally could barely eat one piece wow!!So overall My one complaint is the service is a little slow and it took some time to get our dishes though our server was friendly.Other than that  food was up to par with flavor and the drinks were sweet and strong.They are a little pricey but not too bad consdering what your get. I will certainly be back again!
Angie V.,Antioch  CA,279,14,4,1/17/2014,2.0,"To celebrate a birthday I joined my brother  sister and significant others for dinner here. This was my first time here. Here are my thoughts:Parking: Shared lot with a shopping mall made for a bit of driving in circles before a spot became available. Host[ess]: I entered the restaurant by myself  there were no guests ahead of me. Still  I waited several moments for the 3 host/hostesses to come to a stopping point in their conversation to even notice me. Only one (the male) seemed concerned that I\'d not only been waiting  but listening to their irrelevant conversation. I then had to ask not once  but three times where the bathrooms were as the first and second times I received (from two different hosts) a very vague ""just over there"" with a hand gesture pointing somewhere to the back? bar? off to the left? Server: If I were reviewing the server alone  I would give him 4 stars. He was friendly  made eye contact  got our orders right without writing anything down  was quick-witted  seem to genuinely care and overall was quite a delight. (Alexander  you deserve some recognition!) Unfortunately though  none of our dishes arrived timely. I do not fault our server for this as we had a different server bring each course. In my opinion  the appetizers were really the only course that should have arrived untimely  as 3 of us put in our appetizer order later than the first 2. This theme carried on throughout our meal though. Entrees came one  then two and two (party of 5). The birthday girl\'s dessert came immediately after dinner plates were cleared and then the rest of us were asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu. The birthday girl\'s dessert was done before anyone came back to ask if we\'d like to order dessert. We did  and we waited an incredibly long time for that too. There is nothing I hate more than sitting  waiting for the arrival of the rest of the party\'s food. Those who got theirs  feel uncomfortable knowing their food is getting cold. Those who are waiting feel uncomfortable as they wait hungry  salivating over the food that has arrived. Inevitably  someone insists they go ahead and start. They do  and the hungry continues to wait awkwardly  only to receive their dish just 3 bites before the first served finishes. Food: Pretty good! The pasta was over cooked on one appetizer and the paired ""garlic bread"" was more like very large croutons - way over cooked. The mushroom appetizer had mushrooms of all sizes  mostly unusually large. Great for stuffing  sure  however I couldn\'t help but wonder where they came from (GMO  anyone?). My dinner  the balsamic chicken w/ mashed potatoes was just okay. The chicken was over cooked  but just barely. The mashed potatoes had good flavor but were very  very dry and not creamy. The balsamic drizzle was quite tasty  Small bites of balsamic  crispy onion garnish  baby greens salad and chicken made for a well rounded bite. The dessert  the berry pecan cobbler  lacked berries in a way that left me wondering if they warmed up a Costco blueberry muffin and served it with ice cream. If I wanted a dense  cake-like cookie  I would have order the pizookie. I wanted a fruit cobbler though  and that was definitely not what I got. Miscellany: No one smiled  except for our server at a joke that was made in his presence. The lighting was so dim that I could barely read the menu. Even more disturbing when I realized I could barely see my food once it finally arrived. My brother thought I\'d ordered dessert for dinner as the balsamic looked like hot fudge and the mashed potatoes looked like ice cream. I couldn\'t tell if I had a berry cobbler or a chocolate chip pizookie. So  would I go here again? No  especially not with any of my friends and certainly not with my chef husband! I\'d be so embarrassed!Do I consider this place kid friendly? No. The menu did not reflect children being taken into consideration. If I were on a playdate of sorts  with kids  at the mall and we needed to get lunch  I would pick BJ\'s over the other mall options though. Their lunch specials look appealing enough and certainly won\'t break the budget.As a pregnant woman  the booth was bullshit - I barely had enough room to carefully slide my swollen belly under the table. BUT I did come in late  not with the group  so how could anyone seating our group know? Who might like this place? Teenagers  young adults and anyone else who might not have experienced quality food or service  or those who are satisfied with mediocre. I could see a young person feeling ""grown up"" being in that environment."
Bruce D.,Benicia  CA,13,34,41,11/30/2010,4.0,Nice overall experience. Our waiter Natasha with her big green pen  is fun and enjoyable!Happy hour is great on Tuesday especially because it's half price on all wine  by glass or full bottle. And yes we did order the full bottle!
Rob W.,Pleasant Hill  CA,27,26,3,4/6/2013,2.0,I love BJ's  but this location isn't up to par. I asked about getting a growler of one of there brews and they fed my some BS about not being allowed to serve beer to go in California. If I didnt used to work at Gordon Biersch where we served growlers to go  I might have bought it. When I pressed them on why  they basically turned to another customer and ignored me. Whatever.That should have tipped me off to what i was in for. I was there to get take out  and when I got my pizza home wasnt fully cooked. Awesome.Go to BJ's. It's a great chain. Just dont go to this one.
Mark W.,Madison  WI,152,269,17,9/2/2012,2.0,We had pretty terrible service at this BJ's. Our waitress paid almost no attention to us  despite the fact that we were a group of 8. The food is pretty good  but almost all items on the menu will equal your total daily recommended calorie count. If you don't care about calories  the pizookie is seriously delicious and the only redeeming quality about this restaurant.
Jim K.,Pleasanton  CA,0,4,,10/27/2014,2.0,Sunday 10/26/14 approx. 2:00pmFood eaten Bison Burger & Wedge Fries1. Location was very clean.2. Wait time was satisfactory.3. Service was Excellent4. Presentation of food and fries was good. 5. Bison burger center was raw returned it and the 2nd one was mostly cooked but a small portion was still raw.10/27/14 Complained to management and they stated they would review problem with cooks managers. Considering the problems we have in this country with under cooked food I was surprised that this could happen twice in a row. I think this is either a cook not using proper cooking time or possible cold spot on the grill in either case I hope they take care of the problem. I doubt if I will return to them to find out if they resolve the problem as their is a lot of other fine restaurants in the area.
Greg Z.,Walnut Creek  CA,85,9,,7/29/2012,4.0,I drafted this review a while back and never published it so maybe it's a little dated. Oh well  here we go.I wanted to hate this place so much the first time I drove by it. Really? Another 'brewhouse'? *yawn* And they named it BJ'S. Are they trying to parody themselves?Then I tried one of their deep dish pizzas. I now fully endorse BJ'S and everything they stand for. They also have an Ahi Poke appetizer that makes me feel like less of a human being  for I will never know what it's like to be something so beautiful. Their Mediterranean deep dish may very well be tied for FIRST with a Round Table pizza.
Niki H.,Oakland  CA,13,30,2,12/10/2013,5.0,"Jeez  I don\'t know how this place can get less than four stars. The wait time is  meh  but it\'s worth it. I had my 21st birthday here two years ago and the person who waited on us was one of the best waiters i\'ve ever had. That\'s not an exaggeration. Probably THE best i\'ve ever had. He even created a drink for me and said I can name it! The bartender working at the time even came over and treated me to a shot and told me some ""breathing techniques"" to do while drinking them. All very very nice people. I remember my 21st very fondly and was very happy I decided to go there to celebrate it.I went again for the first time in a while (was out of the country for a couple of years) a few nights ago with my mom who is *very* nitpicky about restaurants. I was a little nervous she wouldn\'t like it... The waitress we had was adorable. She sat down at our booth (which was huge for only three people) and took our orders which I thought was cute. It showed she was comfortable with us which  in turn  made ordering fun. My mom ordered the Maui Glazed Pork Chop with a side salad and coffee... I  the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. When mom\'s salad came she took a bite and instantly loved it (This is only the salad  folks. The salad.). ""Oh  this salad is DELICIOUS. Niki  here  you gotta try this salad. It\'s so crunchy and the sauce is wonderful! I need to make sauce like this. Here  try it! Just taste the salad!"" Yay  the salad gets an A+ from my mom. Also  the coffee was the best coffee she\'s ever had at a restaurant. It had to have been freshly brewed because I tried it as well and it was ... so ... GOOD. Coffee gets an A+The main course arrived and  surprise  my mom was gushing over each bite. ""Oh. MMMM. This is so good. Try this. Let me get a piece of that chicken. OH. Yummy.""Main course A+And how could we forget the Pizookie? My ten year-old sisters absolute favorite dessert on this planet. It\'s literally a huge  fresh-baked cookie topped with ice cream. My mind was blown when I realized it\'s a combination of the word ""pizza"" and ""cookie"". I\'m slow  ok? We had the original (chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream) and devoured it all in under 5 minutes  probably. Dessert gets an A+BJ\'s gets an A+"
Robert R.,Concord  CA,332,728,993,8/14/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"This is where we decided to get dessert  and there was barely a wait. Can you say Trio? We had 2x Pizzookie Trios and tried all six Flavors. Peanut Butter  Triple Chocolate  Oatmeal Cookie  White Chocolate Macadamia  and Chocolate Chip. I forgot to mention Cookies and Cream and all of them were topped with Vanilla Ice Cream. These Desserts are smaller in stature  but big enough to share. (check out pic) We even lucked out and were able to sit in the Bar area and snag a large round booth. I kept looking for Reese Witherspoon to come out and ask me ""Wow  you got a baby in a Bar""  in that movie Sweet Home Alabama. What do I have to say? I got a Sweet Tooth."
Hayley S.,Walnut Creek  CA,15,9,2,5/24/2013,2.0,I went to BJ's last week. I got at least once a month or every other month. - It was busy  but the waitress didn't know what anything was  and kept asking us if that was even on the menu. -The runners kept trying to give us other people's food.-The food was meh-my friend got food poisoning from the shrimp scampi-the waitress never refilled our drinks. It wasn't until my friend asked her as she was running by  if she could have a refill. Even then  it took 20 minutes to get to us-The waitress didn't ask if we wanted dessert.
Kat T.,Vallejo  CA,28,21,3,4/29/2012,3.0,"I\'ve only been to BJ\'s a handful of times and this was my first time to the Concord location. I am ALWAYS overwhelmed by there menu and have learned to stick with the pizza which has ALWAYS been delicious. We walk in on a Saturday night and the hostess is on her cell phone. She takes my name but doesn\'t write it down  and motions for me to stand away from the hostess station. She motions to another employee while she\'s still on her cell and another employee takes our name and seats us. The staff is just ""ok"". They don\'t seem to genuinely enjoy there job which isn\'t really my problem. It just sucks when you want to go out and enjoy dinner and you don\'t feel welcome. Maybe it was just our waitress??? But wait... There was a point when 2 of the bus boys were arguing while clearing the table behind us and it lasted more than an awkward look between my dinner guests and I. BJ\'s is great because they have a diverse menu and there hours are flexible. I would definitely go there again with friends. I was probably the victim of being someones last table = )"
Emily J.,Concord  CA,375,1287,165,11/8/2009,4.0,I started with their basic beer sampler - blonde  pale ale  red and porter. I have had their beer at other locations and already knew that it was good and the sampler definitely didn't disappoint. They have an extensive menu. Burger? Pizza? Salad? Sandwich? Too many choices that all sound delicious. I highly recommend checking out their menu online before you visit. I ended up ordering the California Grilled Chicken Sandwich. This sandwich consists of a thin grilled chicken breast served on toasted  cheesy  sourdough bread and topped with avocado  green chilies  pepperjack cheese and chipotle mayonnaise. It was very tasty although the chicken was a bit too salty  at least for my taste buds. The fries are crispy and addictive. (Don't say I didn't warn you.) As is required for all large chains  the nutritional information is made available. This information is conveniently located in the back of the menu so you can make an educated  good (or bad) decision.  The service was friendly and there were plenty of staff readily available. I'm glad that BJs has finally arrived close to home. I will be back.
Greg A.,Concord  CA,1,20,36,12/20/2013,1.0,Food was great however Waitress was so bad everything came out at different times nothing was comped  then she Handed us the bill before we were done! BAD Service waitress name is Stacy if you get her ask to sit in another section
Bryan P.,San Pablo  CA,183,6,1,6/15/2015,1.0,"My friends and I came on a Friday night to have some drinks . Our waitress was not personable whatsoever. Once one of my friends ordered an old fashioned she obviously had to ask for an I.D and we complied. Keep in mind that my friend is not from this country and we wanted to take him out for a good night out but does have a drivers license displaying his name  photo  DOB  and exp date. The waitress was extremely rude when she had a hard time reading something that she wasn\'t used to. She gave us attitude and made stupid remarks such as "" if only I could read this"" while rolling her eyes. Manager came and asked to see the I.D and once again we complied. He said he has never seen an I.D like this. I explained he was from another country and he asked if he had anything from this country. Are you kidding me!?!? We left and went to Lucile\'s which gave us no problems. Next time learn how to treat others that aren\'t from this country with respect and if there is a problem address it in a manner that is respectful but straight to the point."
Trung N.,San Jose  CA,696,408,54,7/12/2010,4.0,"Silly friends that burst out laughing when one of them asked  ""Who doesn\'t like BJ\'s?"" Always a great time with them  and with a crazy group like that  there isn\'t anywhere else better than to spend a nice dinner at a restaurant/brewery such as BJ\'s.Good food  good beer  and my personal favorite in the non-alcoholic category: the root beer.Lovely waitress named Natalie will take care of you if you\'re lucky enough to get her. Wonderful time."
Camy C.,Walnut Creek  CA,31,18,,9/30/2014,1.0,Had lunch here with friends today and the atmosphere is nice. Sat down and ordered the bbq chicken salad and asked for no beans or corn and dressing on the side. The salad had beans so the waiter brought it back. It took a long time for a salad. Finally the salad came and the plate was dirty with other food smeared on it!!!!!!! The salad did not look fresh either it looked life someone's leftovers. So disgusting! We will not be returning!!!!!
Arna S.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,4,1,9/30/2015,5.0,Great menu with pictures! Waiters are polite and help with orders! I visited this place several times  because it's really tasty! My favorite delicious is pizzuki! It's cool place for events too. I really recommend it to everyone:)
Casey J.,San Ramon  CA,9,5,,6/6/2014,1.0,"Worst restaurant ever with the rudest servers ever!! Guess that\'s what happens when you have little to no standards when hiring your servers. We sat in the bar area and the place was dead. We ordered 2 drinks and an appetizer. Our server left our food and drinks on the counter for 10 minutes. We had to ask another server to go get her then asked her if that was our food sitting there. She simply replied ""oh yea sorry"" and finally grabbed them. Our drinks were warm and our food was cold. This is the most recent out of many bad experiences with this place. The food isn\'t good enough to say it was worth the frustration. I will never spend another penny here."
Leanne V.,Martinez  CA,76,23,2,4/22/2014,3.0,Nice convenient place to eat while shopping at sun valley mall. Large selection of food and appetizers. Spacious bar full bar with good happy hour.
John G.,San Jose  CA,0,7,,9/21/2014,5.0,Always consistent food quality and taste. We love going there for the upbeat atmosphere and very reasonable prices. We like that new items are added to the menu with creative combination of fresh ingredients. Our favorite dessert is the Baked Beignet. Here's too many good meals in the past and many more for the future!
Eileen H.,Concord  CA,344,329,94,9/29/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I'm afraid I'm going to have to downgrade BJ's based on their pizza. I realize that they're not claiming to have Chicago-style pizza  but when I hear 'deep dish pizza'  of course I'm going to hold it to a particular standard (being from Chicago  and all). BJ's deep dish pizza was not good. It was super salty  and the crust was pretty much on par with pizza hut. It was not buttery and flaky like good deep dish crust is supposed to be. Their fish tacos were so-so. Not the best  but passable. My peach margarita tasted neither like a peach OR a margarita. Tasted like a ton of sweet and sour mix with some tequila in it. Boooo.Service was still good and they have such a gigantic menu with items I'm sure I'd like that I'm not boycotting BJ's. I'm just not going to order their pizza (or the peach margarita) again.
Mae M.,Auburn  CA,192,282,22,6/30/2012,3.0,If you have a big group of four or more get reservations because the wait time is forever. But the wait is worth it!From their food to their drinks and their staff this place is wonderful :)Lunch time is hectic but their lunch menu is soooo good. Slider burgers are superb and desserts are very filling :)
Mikaella P.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,4,,8/1/2014,2.0,Ordered buffalo boneless wings and the celery sticks tasted like rubber.. The shrimp scampi was a tad too lemony for me. I'm disappointed for my first time here  but maybe I just didn't choose wisely.
Keith G.,Bedford  NH,2,22,,11/6/2012,5.0,Had an early dinner with wife & 11 month old daughter. Steak & fries were delicious  almost too good. We'll definitely be going back. Dessert was quite yummy  they call it a Zookie (freshly baked cookie in a small pan with a scoop of ice cream  way good.The service was prompt  the server was very attentive and atmosphere quite pleasant. Overall a great time. Only concern was the high chair buckle didn't work anymore so we had to tie it in a knot and keep an eye on our baby.
EM.cas C.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,10,9,6/16/2014,1.0,I was there yesterday for father's day it was the worst yet we got sat and nobody said anything to us so we waited for 20 min and we got out ....this is not the first time the service is the worst please don't go to this place  there's better restaurants ....
Jon F.,Pleasant Hill  CA,381,36,1,8/26/2013,4.0,This place has really good food  beer and atmosphere. There are tv screens hoisted up along every wall of this place. If you are a sports fan  this is a good place to watch a lot of sports (and eat and drink). Solid 4 stars.
Jennifer C.,Walnut Creek  CA,24,137,14,3/15/2014,2.0,Two stars for handcrafted soda. Everything else... meh. I've been there three times and they can never get my pizza right. The service can also be slow at times. As much as I love the free refills on handcrafted soda but without good food to go with it  what's the point of going to BJ's?
Louis H.,San Jose  CA,208,272,648,5/11/2012,4.0,Regular mega sports bar here. Enjoyment can be had by just sitting at the bar and watching their extra large split TV. The bar is long and has two rows of taps behind. The staff seem to be very nice at this restaurant and try to accommodate as best they can. My meal consisted of their roasted beef sandwich with au Jus. I ordered the skinny fries and a sampler of beer. I asked the bartender if they could cut me a rare piece. She said they would try. The meat is already packaged before it arrives so they can't very well uncook it. The meal arrived and to my surprise the meat was fairly rare. The fries were very thin and crispy. They were very enjoyable and tasty. The beer went like this: drink my beer  drink more beer  sit on stool for an hour  bs with my neighbors about sports. Go home and relax. Whats to complain about. {Individual beer evaluations at a later date.)
Sadie B.,Fairfield  CA,123,24,1,3/20/2012,4.0,"Overall BJ\'s is my favorite. I am a WING connoisseur! They have the BEST traditional buffalo wings ever.... better than any where I\'ve ever been. and I\'ve tried almost every wing spot you can find. I\'ve tried much of the menu and it\'s all pretty good food  esp for a chain type Restaurant. Drinks are pretty good and service has always been top notch. But I could do without the ""My Pleasure"" every time I ask for something... I know the servers are probably made to say this .. but seriously.. it gets to be a little weird after the 2nd or 3rd time you hear it in a 30 minute sitting. LOL The only thing I have had trouble with is Togo  every time (10+ visits) they have gotten my order wrong  even when i ask them to double check... check it before you leave :)"
Kristen G.,Walnut Creek  CA,1,8,,1/3/2014,5.0,I've been coming here for a few years with family or friends. The dining room is just ok service wise  but the bar is absolutely amazing! Jessie always makes us something good to drink and has made sure food gets there quickly! My best advice is to check them out on late happy hour and enjoy discounts with great service.
Darryl L.,Port Costa  CA,82,33,59,4/6/2014,4.0,"Friday night Happy Hour is decent. The menu of both craft beers and food is vast. And the prices are decent. Noise level is kept to a minimum even at capacity by cavernous dining area.Now for the staff. There seemed to be plenty of them  and they were pleasant enough but seemed ""inattentive"" or ""rushed"". We placed our initial drink and appetizer order. Our drinks arrived and we gave her our entree order. Our entrees arrived almost immediately after we started our brews and then they delivered the appetizers about 5 minutes later. WOW  slow down everyone. It\'s ""HAPPY HOUR"" not ""SPEED DATING"" we\'re here for. What made us giggle even more was that none of the many staff members that approached us notice or said anything about our ""untouched"" appetizers. We ate and took the appetizers home in containers for later (which I must admit were good)  but ""ill timed"". Staff was pleasant  but just going through the motions to turn tables. Not the pace that ""Happy Hour"" bar floor should be ran at so this is more a floor manager issue. Be nice to the staff...they deliver your brews and food.Will we return? The selection/price of the brews and people watching crowd draws me more than anything else. We might try the BBQ joint next door first though...hmmm."
Pushka G.,Brentwood  CA,12,286,10,5/6/2012,3.0,Clam chowder in a bread bowl.chicken tortilla soup  and calamari. The calamari was excellent. The bread bowl on the clam chowder was not typical in that it was baked and soup added. The Tortilla soup is interesting I suppose. You get the bowl and the soup is poured into it seperately? Strange but not super hot because it cooled off so much being in a seperate little pitcher. Crowded for lunch....yet comfortable. Service was fair.
Jason R.,Concord  CA,63,33,3,4/25/2014,2.0,Service is very slow. Part of our order was forgotten. The food was too salty. I finally rated the place after this has happened more than one visit. Overall  the service definitely needs improvement. Pricing is fair for this size chain restaurant. On a positive note  recommend their beer samplers since it is a good size serving for an individual.
Caro S.,East Bay  CA,354,618,564,10/25/2009,4.0,I came on opening day 10/19/09! Loved this place when I lived in Sac and loves it now that it's in my hood.Because this place is new I cut some slack on the delay in service. We had to wait about 40 minutes to get seated. I hope that this rush will die down after the newness factor goes away. Not to mention you can call ahead for a reservation. All o the food is great deep dish pizza and good brew! the crust on that pizza is like a heaven sent pillow of plush. The salads are yummy salads and plenty of sports to be watched. I love the wedge salad. LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT! You must try the pizzockie. Yes! Deep dish cookie with ice cream on top AMAZING!
Susan K.,Livermore  CA,0,2,,1/4/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Can no longer find my review on here  so thought I would re-rate.Don't bother eating here  the service is truly horrible  and they don't care at all. Took about two hours for them to serve lunch to my party of three people (cold sandwiches and french fries). Others arrived later than we did and were served more quickly. Complained to the manager the next day  who promised to look into the situation plus send us gift cards. The gift cards never arrived  and when I emailed to complain about it (I wanted their corporate office to be aware)  I never received a response. THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS AND I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!!!!
Ben S.,Martinez  CA,34,10,,5/22/2015,1.0,Table and menu are Sticking and GROSS. My glass of lemonade has been Empty for 15 minutes while waitress walked by a dozen times. Used to love this place but it's gone down hill. Friday night at 5pm and place is 3/4 empty. That should have been my warning. Won't Be Coming Back
Chanelle N.,Pittsburg  CA,616,185,502,4/18/2012,4.0,This is the best restaurant at Sun Valley Mall which is located on the border of Concord and Pleasant Hill. The menu is voluptuous  similar to the Cheesecake Factory. The food is quite good and high in calorie content ;)There are so many pluses to coming here. It's family friendly  there's a full bar  tons of TVs for sports  a patio (that can be covered and heated)  and convenience of being at the mall  right off the freeway.I would love this place if the staff were a little bit more friendly and accommodating. They do not accommodate large groups well. If you and your work peeps are planning a night of happy hour after work  this is not the place. They don't let you add extra chairs to your table for stragglers. I understand why  it's just frustrating. They are always busy  I get it. They do have a good happy hour menu but don't come with more than 6 people.
Jazmin R.,Pittsburg  CA,12,50,10,3/30/2014,1.0,The staff COMPLETELY forgot about our table. We had 3 different waiters and the first two forgot we existed. The first half of our services were fine  totally normal service. But then we asked for 2 deserts which were added to our bill but we received them 40 minutes after having ordered them  and AFTER we got our check and told the waiter that we just wanted to cancel them since we had ordered them so long ago & were already picking up our things to leave. The food was ok  nothing special. Definitely not going back.
Ben M.,Santa Cruz  CA,170,130,21,3/31/2012,3.0,I have only come here for drinks so I will have to do another review when I have the food. I love all of the options on tap! It's close to work & the gym  so often times I will see co-workers & friends here enjoying some ap's and cocktails after their day. Price is pretty average. The bar is nice  and the bar area is appropriate  although can get crowded.
Ms. V R.,San Leandro  CA,0,3,,4/10/2016,1.0,"4/9/2016 ~ HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!. Party of 45 came to this restaurant to enjoy a night of family and friends. We were seated on the enclosed patio outside. First there were not enough waiters/waitresses for our party. Secondly  they were taking two to three orders at a time  and it took them no less than 50 minutes to fulfill the orders. Thirdly  after bringing all the appetizers  sodas  water etc.  they never removed any of the EMPTY DIRTY dishes from the table. I had to remind the waitress twice of my order (two fish tacos & fries) which took almost an hour! I never received my water or my soda. When I could no longer tolerate the DIRTY DISHES on the table  I asked to speak to the manager. When he finally came  I shared my concerns with him; I stated we had a huge party of at least 45 guest  the DIRTY DISHES were not being removed from the table  it was taking over 45 min to receive our food  our drinks etc. and that was unacceptable to me. The first thing the Senior Manager ~ David Henderson stated ""was unacceptable that you guys are out here smoking marijuana."" WHAT!!!!!!!!! Excuse me ~ no one is smoking marijuana. David said he could smell it. What!!!!! First of all  no one is smoking marijuana and what has that got to do with my complaint regarding the poor customer service given by BJ\'s??? He was insulting and unprofessional. I demanded an apology  It took three demands before David apologized! That was the last time I will patronize BJ\'s Concord!"
Johanna P.,Hayward  CA,9,14,33,2/7/2012,1.0,Ughhhh if it was possible to give it no stars I would. I went to this place a few days ago with my friend and had a bad experience. Customer service: Terrible. We got there and was busy  I asked how long the wait was and the guy said 5-10 minutes. Wait for 25 minutes and my name wasn't called. So I go and asked  they gave my table to someone else. Really? I'm standing right in front of you plus I doubt there was another Johanna and my name was never called. Waited another 20 minutes finally get a table. Figured things happen and tried to stay positive. Waitress comes and everything we ordered she kept looking at us like we were ordering shit that wasn't on da menu. =\\...... Table was dirty  had to ask for it to be cleaned.Food: Disgusting.I ordered their Jambalaya  YUCK. A frozen dinner tastes better than that. I literally had to add almost half of bottle of hot sauce they gave us.My friend ordered a deep dish pizza. Elementary school pizza tastes better than that. UghWe also ordered a chocolatini tasted like Phillips medicine with chocolate. Irish Root beer float was actually good.Beer: it was ok. I much rather go to 21st amendment in San Francisco. Great service  beer and food. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY/ TIME HERE!!!!!
Dmitry O.,Oakland  CA,22,252,271,3/1/2014,4.0,me and my wife had salmon medeatrian and chicken parmesan  both were very good and delicious. salmon was just 3 skinny small pieces  well prepared  and served with some sort of rice that i didnt really like  but i ate mashed potatoes from my wifes plate.....  so next time NO to that rice and substitute with potatoes!!!!!my wife's plate was good and delicious as well!!!!regarding drinks  unfortunately they serve pepsi product and only strawberry lemonade.....

The crowds tend to be in the 30+ age range which translates to mellow & comfortable. There is plenty of seating at the bar with a view of 4 TV screens above one of the longest rows of beer taps I have ever seen. Other bar seating consists of tall tables that seat up to 6 people as well as several booths that seat up to 4. Everything is black granite...much nicer than my kitchen at home  to be sure.

Tuesday is  as our awesome server Becca informed us  half price wine night! I think it has a catchy name like ""Wine -down Tuesday"". We shared a decent bottle of Pinot Grigio  two pizzas  and chicken tacos. (The chicken tacos were on the snacks & small bites menu & always happen to be a bargain at under $4 even during non-happy hours.) Total bill? $30. Thank you very much.This may become a regular Tuesday night thing for me!

Cindy T.,Antioch  CA,0,10,7,2/22/2012,5.0,"So you have made it to BJ""S  from the moment you walk in the entrance and survey the scene you know that there are good times to be had! There is electricity in the air the crowd is buzzing with a mix of young and old and is also family friendly. People sitting at the bar drinking   laughing  talking just unwinding after a day of work  or that mother with her kids that just did not feel like cooking today. Whew feels good! I was with 6 friends all hungry and grateful to be able to relax and just enjoy good food as well as good friends. I ordered the vegetarian pizza  delicious  even meat eaters would have enjoyed this one  didn\'t miss the meat not one bit. Couple of my fellow diners ordered the ribs  they had no complaints and raved about how good the ribs were. Our waiter was courteous and gave good service while anticipating our needs. So if you are looking for good food with reasonable pricing  you can\'t go wrong here. have been back since this meal and it will be one of my favorite spots. As I said on my next trip I lost my keys in the restaurant They were missing for about an hour. Turns out  I threw them away in the trash with my paper towel. The staff diligently searched for them  one young lady tackled the job of ""trash"" diving  she found my keys  yeah! Can not remember her name  may have been Stephanie  anyway my dear here is your proper THANK YOU....THAT\'S WHAT I CALL SERVICE....... This one is a big thumbs up!  Cindy T. Antioch  Ca  the FOODIVA :D"
David C.,Concord  CA,0,44,,4/2/2016,2.0,We've eaten here many times since they opened. The food is actually good. I've never had a bad meal here.  I had the ribs today and they were excellent. The customer service is horrible and that's why we rarely eat here anymore  every time we go here it seems to be worse. Today was about the worst. It took about 15 minutes for our server to show up at our table. It seemed to be a bother to take the drink order. About 15 minutes later the drinks arrived and our order was taken. The meal arrived about 30 minutes later. You would think that with ribs you would get a warm towel like you do everywhere else  not here. After we finished the meal  I had to ask for a towel. I waited another 10 minutes and went to the restroom to wash my hands. I had to ask for the bill. We were seated at 4:15 pm and paid our bill at 5.45 pm. and there wasn't many people in the place. Just sloooooooooooow service.
Daniel C.,Honolulu  HI,619,543,1118,2/23/2012,4.0,The deep dish pizza here is very good! It's very spacious and comfortable. The menu is vast and has a healthy eating section which is awesome. They are open late night which is a plus because nothing is really open late in East Bay. Late night special here is very reasonable if you're craving a late night snack.
Bri B.,Concord  CA,28,64,90,2/17/2014,2.0,Every time I've gone here (which is a good amount) the service is horrible. I understand that the restaurant gets busy but waiting for an hour for the food to get done or waiting 30 minutes to even be asked what I'd like to drink is ridiculous. Other locations have been better.
Cynthia d.,San Mateo  CA,55,21,8,3/4/2014,1.0,To the rude and unfriendly waitress who helped us on Friday... Altering/changing the gratuity on customers credit card transaction is a big No No!!
Nick J.,San Francisco  CA,44,127,123,3/17/2012,4.0,BJ's is just an all around great restaurant that has something for everyone and really does well...except the service. They're improving little by little; definitely bringing on better  new staff. I was pretty stoked to see this open after enjoying one for years in Roseville. Great appetizers  awesome brews  and nearly every main dish is delicious. I gotta hand it to 'em on one in particular: Angel Hair Toscana. I don't want to offend any ma and pa genuine Italian spots but this may be the best pasta plate out there. It's simple but perfectly balanced with each ingredients flavor. And  of course  the pizookies. Indulge. Just indulge.Check in early on the weekends. The wait is horrible and the quotes...well  once again  staffing is their missing fifth star in my review. It's pretty bad. If you can get passed that  you're in for some good eats. Recommendations: avocado rolls  California chicken sandwich  BBQ chicken deep dish pizza (but all of 'em rock)  seared ahi salad  jambalaya  the aforementioned Toscana  the pizookie of your liking  and any of their craft beers.
I. A.,Pleasant Hill  CA,248,30,10,4/21/2014,4.0,What's there not to love about BJ's..??? Good food. Good ambiance. Good music. Can be crowded though.
C R.,Pittsburg  CA,0,99,,2/12/2013,3.0,Not bad of a place. Nice that they are open past midnight too (bar). Get their before their happy hours or you'll be waiting to get seat.I like their tomato bisque and fried artichoke hearts.
Crystal L.,Discovery Bay  CA,8,6,,5/21/2014,2.0,I have been to BJ's several times in the past and my latest visit was to this location which I have also been to a few times. The menu was changed which was extremely disappointing because I love the giant baked potatoes which are no longer on the menu. Since my favorite was no longer offered I went with what I felt was a safe choice and that was a french dip type sandwich. The sandwich was not very good. There were a lot of chewy pieces of meat that I had to spit out and also the au jus was pretty much a cup of grease! I was just all together disappointed in the food and the service wasn't much better.
Michele W.,Martinez  CA,4,32,2,6/28/2013,2.0,"Won\'t be returning to BJ\'s anytime soon... they kinda suck. Only eaten here about 6 or 7 times in the several years they\'ve been here- but the experience is usually about the same. I just finally asked myself  ""Why do you keep coming back?!"" I guess because it\'s a big enough place and noisy enough  that the kids like it... but it is just a tough place to bring kids- because of the LONG WAIT! Always a long wait  for everything! We usually try to go in off peak times  so we dont wait more than 15 mins for a seat... so that\'s fine. But it takes forever to get a menu  place your order  even LONGER for the food to come  and forever to get your check and get out. Seriously people-- what is wrong with you guys?! We went in (myself  a girlfriend and our kids-- 6 of us in total) and our food took about 30-40 mins to come out. And we didn\'t even order that crazy of stuff. Just some appetizers and 4 kids meals (which the kids meals were horrible!) All in all  just a bummer. The table next to us sat piled high with dirty dishes the entire time we were there (about 90 minutes!) and I saw tons of staff just standing around. The table behind us asked for silverware 2 or 3 times before they finally brought it-- all the while their food sitting there in front of them getting cold.Even when I asked  \'when is our food coming- the kids are getting restless\'... our waitress said  ""should be soon- you know  they can go run around out on the patio"" and pointed to their outdoor dining area. Yeah- like I\'m gonna let my kids go run around and bother the diners out there --even if there were only a few? Plus  my little one is LITTLE... I cant just send her off to run and play. That wasn\'t the point-- the point was - what\'s taking so long to make a salad and reheat some gross mac n\' cheese?! It really was gross  all clumped together and oily. I\'m done. While I feel the food is OK (pretty much just ok)... there are so many better places I\'d rather support that care about the customer. Bye BJ\'s."
Isa W.,Vallejo  CA,186,253,1450,3/29/2012,4.0,i LOVE BJ's everything on their menu is pretty good. the appetizer wings are soooo delicious too! this was my first time at this location  the waiter skills lack. It took so long for the girl to just get me water... it would be different if they had to make it or do something special.
Alma C.,Walnut Creek  CA,58,21,1,7/4/2015,1.0,This was my first time going to BJ's because of all the things I've heard about them. At first it was okay  the hostess's greeted us. But did not ask us if we wanted a table  instead  they told us immediately to go to the bar? We agreed anyway because we were hungry. We waited for atleast 15min to get noticed by the damn bartender  Jacob. I asked for the menu right away  and it took him another 10min to give us a menu  if I hadn't reminded him  he would have forgotten all the way. The food was cold already when it got to our table about 45min after ordering and we didnt waste our time anymore to ask for a replacement since we were starving. We were told by hostess that there is Happy Hour and when we got our checks  it wasn't there because apparently  Saturdays does not have happy hour. This place sucks and you should just take your money else where.
Dylan S.,Berkeley  CA,0,42,,10/13/2011,2.0,BJ's has some of the most bland food in the world  although the ambiance and drinks make up for some of it  service can be spotty but most of the help is 18-20 so it makes sense.Not my favorite place but i end up goin here once or twice a year
Maria C.,Sunnyvale  CA,3,5,2,11/5/2013,1.0,First time at this restaurant and was very disappointed! Went here around 3:30 for late pre-bday lunch on 11/3/13  we got seated right away since it's not even busy. It's a party of seven  two are toddlers  we ordered appetizer which took 35 minutes  we got our soup and salad first before that. The entree took 50 minutes to get to our table! Plates was hot but the food  side dishes and sauces are less than warm already and some are even cold to touch. My veggies are dry too since it's probably been in the food warmer too long and got dehydrated! Steak ordered was medium well and came out dry and warm not hot. We called the manager to complain about how long the food took before we got it and that it's luke warm and not acceptable. They convinced us to redo our order and will try to get it to us fresh. The steak came out more rare than medium well the next time around  we've been at this restaurant for two hours now and i convinced my brother not to complain anymore since it's been horrible already and we just want to leave! The manager did give us complementary gift card to use for next time which will not happen since the food was terrible and not worth coming back for!I love discovering new places to eat and this is the first time something like this happened to me that it's worth taking my time to write a review!
Patrick Z.,Concord  CA,108,319,34,2/7/2012,3.0,Took my sweet wife here for a welcome home dinner. Neither of us had been here before. We were seated almost immediately. All the food dished on the menu looked great. My wife got the Kung Pow Chicken and I got the Pork Chops with Tortilla Soup. The Tortilla Soup presentation was good and it tasted great. My pork chops were juicy and delicious. I got a taste of the Kung Pow Chicken. Wow! I was jealous. The chicken was tender  juicy  and spicy. At the end of the meal the waiter recommended a cookie desert that came in a mini deep dish pizza pan with ice cream. We took his recommendation without regrets.This place was good. We'll be back to try some other menu items that caught our attention.
Lin F.,Vallejo  CA,2,27,2,5/10/2015,1.0,Had dinner here last night and it was a nightmare. We sat for 15 mins before the waiter recognized us and finally took our drink order. When i got my ice tea it tasted like there was nothing but sugarin it. Than dinner came and i ordered the fish and chips  my fish had a piece of calamari stuck to it and i am allergic. When i told the waitress she asked if i was sure it was in my food when they brought it?? Accusing me of lying?
David P.,Alamo  CA,5,50,,2/7/2014,3.0,Plenty of parking aka it's in the mall. Lighting is great. Good beers as its a brewery. Food reminds me of good bar food. If you're hungry at the mall and don't feel like fighting the food court  BJ it up.
Jane S.,Pittsburg  CA,0,2,,10/24/2013,1.0,Horrible service!! I'm being very generous with this one star. It took 2 hours for them to serve 4 people. My table watched people be seated after us and leave before us. Our cups were constantly empty and when the food came out  the burgers were burnt  the breadsticks were hard as cement and the salad was just plain disgusting. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
Juice C.,Dublin  CA,2,69,9,2/12/2012,4.0,1. Ambiance is pretty good in the Concord one. TV's everywhere with plenty of space and a nice central bar. I have yet to find a place that competes with the selection of beers this place has. I did try the appetizer of guacamole rolls that was awesome!
Kathryn M.,Concord  CA,0,10,,10/7/2013,1.0,Stopped in for an early dinner on a Friday night. Once we got seated with menus  waitress finally came around  put her knee on the extra chair and took our order. We had no silverware which she noticed. She brought our water but no silverware. I noticed there was a bug or something in my water so we asked for the manger. We showed it to him and he took away the glasses. The waitress brought us new water but made no apologies. 10 minutes later came back and tossed 3 sets of silverware on the table. When we got our order  we asked the runner for water as we were out and no one noticed. She never came back with water so we stopped someone else and asked her. She was able to fill 2 of 3 glasses and we asked for a pitcher so we wouldn't have to keep trying to ask someone. She said she would be right back but again  never returned.French fries were cold on 2 of the dinners.Waitress never asked how our dinner was. She did come over at one point with another server and leaned around one of us  stated 'oh they are fine' and left again.Once again out of water  we were able to find her and ask for water. She brought enough for 1 1/2 refills even though there were 3 of us at the table. When we brought it to her attention  she blew it off and said she would go get more and the pitcher wasn't filled all the way and that's why there wasn't enough.We asked to speak to the manager again. We saw him talking to her but he never came to the table. So we asked another server for the manager. When he finally came over  she stated that she had not told him we wanted to talk to him!He knelt at the table and apologized and said he would talk to her about her service. While he was talking to us  the waitress leaned over him  grabbed the ketchup off our table and walked away! Some of this may sound picky and I know it is not an upscale restaurant  but the rude  inconsistent and often lack of service was out of control. We will NOT be back.
Ramak H.,Moraga  CA,1,3,,6/6/2011,1.0,My good friend worked for BJ's at another location and I love that place. So  of course  I go visit one near my house and end up having a horrible experience. My friend and I go to sit at the bar area where it didnt seem very busy and wait anxiously for our server to order our drinks before we start looking at the menus. First  we werent even acknowledged  we had to flag down the server after sitting for 5 minutes. She then brings our menus and takes our drink orders. Fifteen minutes go by!! We are watching the bartender and no sign of our martinis. Finally our drinks arrive and we order food and I feel like that was the last we seen of our server. Im easy going and hate to be a bother  but JEEZ  i almost felt like she was deliberately ignoring us. It wasnt that busy.....maybe she cant handle more than 3 tables at a time. O yeah  and when the food arrived....25 MINUTES later  there was no silverware  napkins  extra plates  or anything. The server herself dropped off the food and left the table as if there really wasnt anything missing.. we then had to flag her down again for silverware. Really wanted to say something  but I think my tip reflected the service much better than me saying something I might regret. Thanks BJ's
Sophea U.,Concord  CA,95,38,6,6/15/2013,4.0,This place is one of my favorites! Great selection of food  and very delicious all-American dishes. I love their moscato and stuffed mushrooms. The service is just as great as the food  and a wonderful ambiance. Not to mention very kid-friendly. :)
Ben C.,Seattle  WA,425,54,,5/24/2011,4.0,BJ's Restaurant is a great place to grab lunch for me and the crew. We like coming here when we want some good food and to have a decent atmosphere after a few drag in the classes.Their gourmet mac and cheese is amazing! It is very cheap and only costs 3-4 dollars  and it is pretty filling with a side of garlic bread.I also really like the soup here  as well as the sandwiches. I have rarely been disappointed with the food here  except the service can be very different  sometimes great  sometimes not so. Gotta take off a star for an unpleasant experience with one of the waiters  and that their utensils are not washed properly  but its not that big of a deal for me. Hopefully I won't find any food here that will make me sad :)
Danny T.,Vallejo  CA,0,1,,3/12/2015,1.0,"3/12/2015So I came to write this review based on the manager On duty Daniel . My family and I came to this bjs at 8:00 pm. We order our food at 8:15. Within 10 min out appetizer and beverages came out. In my head I was thinking we are going to get our food pretty quick. We finished our drinks and appetizer by 845 and enjoyed the game that was on tv. Around 915 I noticed our food wasn\'t out yet. Keep in mind it was not busy. At 930 our waiter (Amy) came to our table to explain to us the mishap that happened in the kitchen. She informed us that our food is on priority and will be out ASAP. In addition she informed us that the manager was going to come around to speak to us. Now I get it  nothing is every perfect and things happen. Our food came out 20min later and our waiter asked if the manager came around yet to ""speak to us"". I was not expecting a lot. I wasn\'t even expecting free food. The manager Daniel came around and asked us ""if there anything else you need or anything I can get for you"" we replied with ""no its ok"" and he went on and said ""if there is anything else you need just let the waiter know"". Now I\'ve worked in retail for a long time and things happen but for the manager to show ZERO EMPATHY was beyond my imagination. A simple acknowledgment that our food came out later and a simply apology for that would have made it a semi better experience. You are the manager duty of a large establishment and I would have expected more. Once again on the record I understand things happen  but for you leader/manager on duty to that type of demeanor is unacceptable. His lack of empathy left me with negative remark of this BJs establishment."
Melody K.,Brentwood  CA,152,274,395,3/29/2011,5.0,I love this place!!!Met a friend here for lunch and had AWESOME service! Waiter was attentive  nice and really on top of things! Food was great. Had the California Chicken and loved it..so tasty!I also saw the Happy Hour menu...good selection and good prices.Definately will be back again and again!
D R.,Pleasant Hill  CA,11,24,,2/4/2014,2.0,BJ's is hit and miss. We've had good experiences and not so good experiences. We were there last night (on a Monday) and the service was slow  the food took way over a half hour and wasn't brought out at the same time. The place was maybe 70% capacity so it wasn't like they were incredibly busy. The spaghetti sauce was runny and the burger was way too salty. Wine is way overpriced but the beer is decent and priced fairly. It's not a bad place to eat but there's a lot better in the area.
Tracy A.,Berkeley  CA,426,29,6,5/13/2011,3.0,The decor and lighting is nice.... service good so far. I will taste the food and see how it is.My chicken salad was delish!!!
Hanna W.,Concord  CA,2,15,,11/6/2012,4.0,LOVE their Mediterranean pizza! LOVE their boneless wings. LOVE their beer! I don't like that they don't take reservations and it's tough to find parking. It's recommended that you call ahead if you want your name on the wait list and I definitely recommend that you park on the side of the mall  near JCPenney  instead of in front  if you want to avoid driving around in circles.
Mike S.,San Francisco  CA,93,337,29,11/10/2011,3.0,it's an Ok place  another (Chili's or elephant bar)  but this one has the best brownie/ice cream dessert.Our order did a while to come out  and we had to ask for it several times before it actually came out. we didn't mind though  since my friends and I were actually enjoying the conversation
J M.,Martinez  CA,0,14,2,2/24/2015,2.0,Hit or miss  but mostly miss. Wilted salads  found a hair in my food- yuck! They do have bomb shrimp tacos though  pretty much the only thing on the menu that I like.
Michelle W.,Brentwood  CA,162,350,41,11/8/2011,3.0,We were surprised that on a Sunday we were seated right away at noon. It seemed like we got there just in time because 10 minutes later and it was busy.  It's not as loud as the BJ's in Brentwood so every little noise our 1 year old made seemed really loud. We ordered the calamari since our oldest loves it. It came our luke warm and the crust was soggy. Hubby got the french toast  again. Son  got the mac and cheese and I had the crispy jalapeno burger. The burger was awesome! Service was good and the waitress said that our kids were great. She did make a comment about how some kids should be on a leash which was kind of weird.
Danielle G.,Benicia  CA,0,3,10,4/2/2014,2.0,My husband ordered a Long Island and it was too sweet. Not usual for a Long Island! I had the skinny margarita and it was sweet also. Hardly tasted any liquor in either. I had mahi mahi for dinner and it was sooo dry. My daughters Kraft macaroni and cheese looked like it had been made the day before and warmed in a microwave. I can do better with the single serve in the microwave. I used to really like this place but I'm not coming back for a long time!
Jeannean L.,Sacramento  CA,8,3,1,2/16/2015,1.0,I absolutely LOVE BJs and have always had exceptional service and amazing food. I am from sacramento and came to this Bjs to take my niece out to lunch to find that sacramento and concord bjs must hold themselves to a different standards. The hottest was unfriendly and our waiter was slow and non responsive. We ordered right away however every table around us for their food before our appetizer. When our food finally came out I ordered the pulled pork. No fries they weren't done yet it was cold the onion rings were soggy and there was no sauce. My niece had turkey club it was dry and not very toasted as well as cold. I had them take mine back and left hungry will never return.
Jessica L.,Oakland  CA,113,169,34,11/9/2011,3.0,The food is OK. The service is OK. Their beer is OK.It is in a mall after all..........They have a lot of craft beers to choose from beside their own brews and they have a good happy hour special on their mini pizzas  half off.
Lyndi M.,Concord  CA,18,25,,3/26/2014,1.0,Had dinner here last night. Service was slow and server was not very friendly. Never smiled or even asked how we were. Took forever to get our drinks.Food was mediocre at best. Nope won't be coming back here.
Eli M.,Vallejo  CA,221,221,77,8/19/2013,2.0,Seriously we have had a bad experience the past few times we have come here! Today we had all dirty knives and forks  they forgot our Caesar salad  the food took 45 minutes to get. The original server was amazing but when you have 3 different people bring out your food the original server has no clue what all came out. Thank god he took the salad off our check! Bonus is he told us how many point we had on our rewards card so we got a free pizookie
Jim N.,Clayton  CA,0,18,,3/22/2014,3.0,"I have eaten here several times and am usually satisfied with the food. The menu has a huge selection to choose from. There beer menu is just ok. Their house beer is terrible. Don\'t fall for their dessert ""pizzuki"" it\'s a joke."
tabisky c.,Walnut Creek  CA,1,334,1,2/20/2012,3.0,Attentive staff and manager who accommodated our request to sit at a booth.The menu is large and the items are reasonably priced.However  my shrimp taco was not that great. Chunks of raw onion blasted my taste buds and the tortilla was cold and rubbery. My friend had the ahi salad and she liked it a lot and recommended that we try it the next time.
Sunny J.,Chatsworth  CA,33,81,3,11/20/2011,3.0,BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants. Why? Because the food has never disappointed me. The only thing that lacks from location to location is service. Any BJs I go to  service is always a hit or miss. Since it's always packed you would think staffing will be increased to produce quick turnover  but that doesnt fly normally with the BJ's family.Regardless i'll keep loathing for a pizookie and their pizza. The Concord location wasn't too bad... Service just could have been better as my friend waited 30 minutes for water.
Jeannie E.,East Bay  CA,2,5,,7/1/2013,3.0,I frequent often and the service has home downhill. Visited last week BEFORE the lunch crowd and just after they opened. Waiters white shirt was a mess. I inquired and he said he made a big batch of tea and spilled. Funny  it didn't look like tea  but I believed him. His apron had white stuff all over too. I wouldn't have thought much more of it  but we were seated next to the window and 30 minutes later  I noticed another employee parked in the very first parking spot (aren't they supposed to leave the good spots for customers?)  get out of her car. From a distance I noticed her shirt wasn't clean and as she walked past the window while tying her apron  I could see her apron was filthy. I can't believe management allows that. Things do get spilled in a food business and I assume there are extra shirts and clothing just in case. How can you allow an employee to start a shift looking filthy? That is unacceptable. I'm still considering speaking with a manager  but I doubt it will make a difference. I had to wait so long to pay after asking  that I don't think they care anymore. The food was good  but it still disappoints me with the changes they made in the soup/salad lunch special. I'd be willing to pay more if all the salad and soup choices were available daily like they used to be.
Ali L.,Antioch  CA,2,74,5,11/5/2013,4.0,I've had good experiences here. Food is good. Drinks are good. Pricey but hey when is going out to eat at a brew house cheap?
Christine C.,Dublin  CA,120,155,2,10/1/2011,2.0,I've always liked BJ's. The food isn't too original  but its always had a good consistent taste. With that said  I am not a fan of this particular BJ's. I have been going to BJ's since I was a wee little teenager and this is by far the worst BJ's I have ever been to. The service is either a hit or miss. I have had good service and I have had horrible service. There have been a number of times when I have had some of my order comped which is nice. What would have been better is if one my appetizers hadn't been served to me frozen in the middle or if my food had come within an hour. The food being comped was a result of me talking to the manager and I am not much of a complainer. The food is as decent as other BJ's have been  but with the less than appealing service  waiters with eyes full of judgement when it comes to everyone thats steps food in the restaurant and frozen/food that never came  I think I'll pass. If I ever get a craving for a Pzookie  maybe I'll go over to the one in Vacaville....it may be far but at least its next to an outlet.
Hannah K.,Tara Hills  CA,182,181,31,9/28/2013,4.0,Food was actually pretty good and the customer service was friendly. I guess it deserves four stars... so I am going to change it  but it can get noisy in the restaurant  especially when there is a football game going on.
Joshua E.,Miami Beach  FL,62,13,11,1/26/2014,3.0,Very fast and friendly service. Only reason I gave it 3 stars is because The food is mediocre when compared to the price.
Mike H.,Antioch  CA,8,29,,4/20/2014,3.0,Food is alright and the service is hit or miss  you can't mess up a beer and the beer has always been good but other than that a subpar experience
Mark H.,Hercules  CA,136,80,160,3/11/2011,2.0,I ordered the balsamic chicken and it's was really good. It came w/ 2 chicken breasts on top of a lil spring salad w/ a side of buttery mashed potatoes  drizzled with balsamic vinegar. Calories= (750). Wifey ordered the fish tacos  it came with 2 fish tacos chipotle sauce w/ cabbage slaw  chips  creamy guacamole and salsa. Calories (750). That was good too. As far as food was concerned it was pretty good. SERVICE= fir me my past 2 and only 2 times I've been here  the service really sucks!!!! They take way to long just to give u water. And our waitress was so slow and not attentive to service that we was ready to walk out both times. She would pass us up and not have our drinks and the food takes longer than usual to serve so.....I would never go back here based on my experience. Ur better off going to elephant bar or claim jumpers. Service sucks here at this est.
Food C.,Napa  CA,1,44,5,6/17/2013,3.0,First  call ahead when you are on your way. This way you only have a 10-15 minute wait on a Fri or Sat night rather then 45 -60min. Server was nice and informative. Pizza was good (hence not great). If they could have cooked it for 3-4 minutes I think it would have been hot all they way through rather then just warm. Toppings good and fresh. Beer good and when I couldn't make up my mind on which one to choice they brought me 2 samples to try. (nice touch). The management just needs to remind the young workers to make an extra effort to clear empty glasses and plates  make sure there are napkins & utensils on the table (or at least bring them after seating. People should have to ask for things like to be done). Overall I guess I would go again to try a different pizza but it wouldn't be my first choice.
Arianna B.,Hercules  CA,1,9,1,2/25/2014,4.0,Loved the Crispy Jalapeno burger!! Fried jalapenos  pepper jack cheese  chipotle mayonnaise  Baja sauce  red onions  tomato and lettuce. Perfect combo.
B H.,Martinez  CA,0,11,,5/27/2013,2.0,Just had dinner at BJ's in Concord. The wait was really long because there were at least 15 tables not bussed. Not a huge crowd waiting to be seated either. Finally after waiting 25 minutes for a party of 3 and having other parties that came in after us be seated first had to say something. The front desk girl finally bussed a table herself for us. Our server was very nice. House salad was plain iceberg (which had rotten pieces of lettuce) dressing and one slice of cucumber. No croutons or anything else. We used to like coming here but the past few times have been really lacking in food quality and cleanliness. Time to try a new place.
Paris G.,Concord  CA,1,2,,6/5/2013,4.0,Went here with a party of about 30 ppl. Service was pretty good and food was great as usual. Luv their fish and chips! Great experience even with the large party!
Bill D.,Concord  CA,26,7,1,1/12/2014,2.0,Came here for brunch and the waitress said they ran out of eggs. She then proceeded to tell us that they run out eggs every sunday. Avoid brunch here.
Jeromy G.,Foster City  CA,593,660,1032,8/6/2013,4.0,This review is for Happy Hour. My coworkers and I came here after work to grab a bite to eat and a drink. I have to say overall we had fun. We ordered drinks  the girls cosmos  myself a mojito. My mojito was made well and it tasted good and the girls said their cosmos were good as well. The servers were nice and really helpful when we were figuring out what to order. We got the artichoke dip  avocado rolls  mini deep dish and a flatbread. All of the items were really tasty and very cheap  around $4  $5 or $6 depending on what you got which is a good deal. The drinks as well  so you could get mixed drinks  beer or wine and it's included in the happy hour prices which was nice. So I got one of their beers and it was pretty good while the girls got a lemon drop that they said was their favorite. For desert we each got a glass of wine and the 3 pizookie which is a cookie topped with ice cream and we got red velvet  chocolate and macadamia nut. All were amazing  I'm surprised I never had it before. The happy hour deals are worth it  good food and drinks for a good price so I will come again.
B V.,Antioch  CA,0,15,,5/13/2013,1.0,WORST. BJ's. IN. THE. WORLD!Your food sucks  and so does your customer service.
Michelle G.,Pinole  CA,0,1,,2/15/2015,1.0,KATIE has the worst customer service. Don't asks her to split your bill because she won't understand  does not understand the menu. We felt so comfortable that we had to pay for our drinks and cancelled the order and leave.
Mark M.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,39,,2/15/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Thought I would give them another try. What a mistake. Will not give them another visit. This time  the fries were soggy. Sent them back and got crisp proper fries. The burger bun had been frozen and then blasted in an oven making it rock hard like a brick! The burger was bland and unseasoned. Needless to say only took one bite of this and sent it back. Glad I started with a iceberg wedge which was good. The meal was comped. Just wondering how this type of crap can get past quality control.
Vanessa S.,Oakland  CA,467,780,358,7/9/2011,2.0,I'm not really a fan of BJ's. I do enjoy their deep dish pizza and their music selection is pretty good. Other than that  I could live without it.
Daniel P.,Portland  OR,13,81,58,10/29/2009,5.0,Well I went twice this week and overall I had two great experiences. The first time I went for lunch  as I got to school right across the street and someone suggested popping over. The service was fine  it was in the middle of the day on a Tuesday so it was pretty slow  so there were a few servers attending to us.. I had never been to this chain before  but my friend had and suggested the pizza.I had the Cheeseburger pizza and he had the Great White  we both shared a little and I must say that they were both excellent!!! I got some of their house brewed root beer  it was pretty good but not amazing or anything. However considering it didn't really cost a lot and there were free refills I would recommend it for perhaps a long dinner. Their register computer was down so they gave us free ice cream without even a second thought and I really appreciated that. The next night we had a final and I suggested to someone that we go over to BJ's and that I had had a good meal the previous day. Now THIS was a good test of how well BJ's performs under pressure. I got there first with a friend and we got a table for 4  this was right during dinner time and they were packed but we got a table after maybe 15 minutes. Soon after that we were joined by three other friends from our class that had heard we were coming....and then six other people.....and then eight other people!!! Almost our entire class of thirty showed up when they had no tables and in the middle of the dinner rush!! SOMEHOW the good people at BJ's found seats for everyone  while providing seats to the people waiting in line  AND continuing to serve us without interruption. WOW.!!!So on to the food  I tried the spring rolls and the calamari  and I enjoyed the classic Angus burger for my entree. The spring rolls were fine  but sort of small for the price. The calamari was soggy rather than crispy and yet was cooked completely properly and had wonderful flavor  and usually I hate soggy calamari. I have had a decent handful of gourmet style burgers  and this one was one of the best. The bun was hot and toasted  the meat was flavorful  and overall the burger was a good size. Also the potato wedges on the side were tasty and definitely plentiful  I even shared them with a friend (and I HATE sharing!).I will definitely be going back sometime.
Diana G.,Martinez  CA,24,2,,2/9/2014,1.0,"I cannot begin to describe the level of incompetence that the wait staff exhibited during our visit. Yes we were a party of 13. But we were a reservation and a birthday party. The waiter did not keep track of who ordered what. We negotiated separate checks for smaller groups in the party. Food was ordered and not served for almost an hour as were beverage orders. Orders were misplaced. At the end of the meal  the bill was brought and it was one bill and we were told we would have to separate it out as the waiter couldn\'t recall who ordered what. Even after we separated and organized the orders for him  he STILL messed up the separate checks. This took another half hour to sort out. We were at the restaurant for over an hour trying to FIX the mess the waiter had made. The Manager was NEVER called. The waiter tried to ""make it all up to us"" by compting 25 % of the meals. This is no way to run a restaurant and yes I would know as my grandfather owned one for many years. We will NEVER be going back to this establishment."
Rochelle R.,Sacramento  CA,211,84,55,8/9/2011,5.0,I LOVE BJs as a chain and love the fact that after I moved from Sacramento to the Bay area 4 years later there is a BJs in my back yard now! I love the Pizzookie!!! (the Trio is the best so you can try three)Service is always great - I've gone for Sunday football  lunches  dinners  drinks  apps etc. Everything is great. There is sometimes a wait but BJs has a call ahead program where you call with parties of 2-9 and get seated within 5 minutes from your scheduled time for the call in.The pizzas are delish.Stuffed Mushrooms are to die for! Every time they taste great!I like the mozzarella and Tomato Salad as well. The new enLIGHTment meals (for those who are calorie/health conscious) is awesome! I love the new choices. Concords Locations is Great!I've held my birthday at the Roseville Location for a group of 25 and it was fantastic as well!
Sean W.,Concord  CA,3,123,,10/15/2013,3.0,This place has good food but the service is slow I do like the drinks and all of the tv's but the service sucks the margaritas are as was as the long island ice tea I personally do not recommend the house beers
Brian G.,Walnut Creek  CA,150,246,,10/16/2011,3.0,Obviously BJ's is a big chain  but this particular location I would go back to. BJ's has a large selection of beer for such a chain type place. They also have a lot of different TV's going on at all times in the bar. It's first come  first serve there too so you don't need to wait around forever if you're smart about it.Service and food was just ok  but based on the TV's and beer selection I'll be back.
John A.,Walnut Creek  CA,140,21,14,9/3/2013,5.0,Katie was amazing - I came in for a late lunch with my boyfriend  she was very quick  friendly and helpful. She asked us at least 5 times if we needed anything. Have not had service like this in awhile.
Christin V.,Pleasant Hill  CA,15,9,,11/21/2013,4.0,We had lunch here today and I must say that I was thoroughly pleased with the excellent customer service given by Natalie & the manager!
Maxwell R.,Eugene  OR,211,49,2,7/6/2013,4.0,OK  to be clear  BJ's isn't getting the 4-star rating here  their bar staff at this particular location is. Very pleasurable experience  much classier then competing chains. Our waiter memorized our elaborate drink order with a friendly face  even while the game was on and the place was packed. Clean  ambient atmosphere.
Jonathan R.,Concord  CA,257,879,1034,6/10/2013,4.0,Great beer and good food  what more can you ask for. I was greeted by the hostess who asked me if I wanted to sick in the cocktail lounge because it's open seating. I tell her no  just a regular table and her attitude seemed to change from happy to not so happy. But I was seated pretty much right away. While I was waiting for Terri to come in our server Chris brought us both water. I noticed both the drink menu and the table were a little sticky. Finally Terri comes in and we place our orders. She ordered the Bison burger which was on there under 600 calories menu and I had the jalapeno burger cooked rare. Thank god it was actually cooked rare  I believe this is only the fifth place I've tried that have successfully cooked my burger the way I want it. The fried jalapenos and the pepper jack cheese with the spicy mayo gave it a great kick. However it was very uneven. Some bites would have the full spicy bite  and others would have no kick to it at all. Instead of getting fries I decided to go with a dinner salad. It was OK but I've had better salads in less popular places. One thing I hate is whole tomato slices in a salad. I tried Terri's Bison burger and it was amazing. I would love to have switched but I knew that wasn't happening  haha. For dessert we ordered the triple sampler of Pazookie. Awesome stuff. We had the original which was a warm chocolate chip cookie and vanilla bean ice cream on top  raspberry and white chocolate cookie with vanilla bean ice cream  and red velvet cake cookie with vanilla bean ( my personal favorite.) Our server was Chris and he was very good  saying yes sir  no sir  very polite young man. One thing though is after he would ask a question  or after we answer one  he would stand and stare for a second and then walk away. I tried there Piranha ale  and it was delicious. Very good experience here.
Jada B.,Pleasant Hill  CA,16,105,86,11/3/2014,2.0,The two stars are strictly for the food. We came on a Sunday when numerous football games were on and they were busy. Despite that  our server was super attentive ( I would rate her 5 stars) and accommodating in every way. We were craving burgers so this is where we landed since we were already at the mall. My sister ordered the Double Deluxe Burger without tomatoes  pickles and any condiments (i.e. no sauce). I ordered the Brewhouse burger w/ bacon  no pickles. When our burgers came  both were seemingly dry of any condiments. I understand that confusion since my sisters request was kind of odd when you read the description of the burger and there probably was just a mix up with our table. No big deal to me. I just asked our waitress for some mayo (which my burger originally was supposed to come with) and added it myself with some ketchup. This burger was still so bland!! Just no flavor at all except for the few bites I could taste the bacon. And the bun was soooo dry! I ended up picking off parts of it to get around the dryness. It was actually a chore to try and finish this thing. My sister said her burger was good but half of the bun had a weird mustardy type of sauce on it. I got the wedge cut fries  her the crispy thin and both were very tasty. Next time I think I would try one of their signature pizza's. As a side note  as someone else mentioned before me  the table behind us also tried to order the pumpkin beer off of the advertisement on the table only to be told they did not have it.
Dan B.,Deltona  FL,0,2,4,6/26/2012,1.0,Do not go to bar if u r gluten free. Anne does not have a clue. To bad 4 people w/allergies. Never again. Manager was nice when i complained.
Ana C.,Hercules  CA,32,48,1,2/11/2011,4.0,Good beer  good food  and Dorene (the best bartender there). The overall service at BJ's is so-so. Sometimes its good  sometimes its alright. Now  I usually sit at the bar area. I love it when Dorene is the bartender. She makes great drinks and her service is great. She's always checking up on us to make sure our cups are full.
Tera M.,Pleasant Hill  CA,23,18,,12/17/2013,1.0,HORRIBLE! ! Ridiculously long waits. On last visit our waitress Sara was extremely unprofessional and RUDE! Don't waste your time or $$.
Justin G.,Martinez  CA,3,35,4,11/17/2014,1.0,Hi BJs. I went to your concord location this weekend for my brother's birthday. We were told an hour long wait for our party of 8. Waited an hour and twenty while tables sat visibly empty. Ordered pizza and appetizers. Pizzas all came out first which would have been fine if the four servers we had to ask for silverware had actually brought them so we could eat our food. And all this shit service was underscored by an unapologetic and apathetic staff. Pretty embarrassing if you ask me. Oh yeah  and learn how to get refills to people for crap sake.
Andrew H.,Castro Valley  CA,41,50,41,8/5/2013,2.0,I dont know if it was because our server was new  but we had terrible service here while sitting out on the patio  had to get up and walk around the restaurant to find her to ask for another drink 3 more servers had to come out and help her  wish i could have tipped the girl who helped us as opposed to our actual server. =/
Eva M.,Pleasant Hill  CA,93,73,7,9/13/2013,3.0,Pretty good place. One of the few places that the whole family can go to and find something they like. Hubby loves the fact that they have a goat cheese option on some of the flat bread pizzas (he is very lactose intolerant). I love the fact they they have healthy options for the kids menu and I've never had a server ask if we wanted desert loud enough for my toddler to hear. Long waits between 6 and 7:30 though.
Stacey T.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,12,,3/8/2012,2.0,I'm giving them two stars because I like the food  but the service is terrible! Something is always messed up when I go here. My last experience was we ordered two dinners  pizookie's  and root beers to go over the phone. It was a Thursday night. They said to come pick it up in 20 min. Well  AN HOUR later  they finally gave us our food. The manager only comped the root beers which is only a couple bucks. Definitely makes me think twice before going back there.
Justin R.,Pleasant Hill  CA,30,29,25,7/26/2013,5.0,Katie was my waitress  very professional with a wonderful smile! Was always on top of my drinks an food!
Maggie A.,Walnut Creek  CA,95,18,16,10/16/2012,2.0,Nothing is really special about BJ's. The food is just ok and universal  and the beer selection is alright  I have had better and good ones. The Happy Hour is really bad  (its juts a dollar off) and very very sweet cocktails. Not to mention  the floor is very very slippery and I think its very dangerous when you have a full bar  and serve alcohol drinks. I have seen many guests slipped and hurt themselves. I just go here sometimes because its the only local restaurant that has TV and play sports.
Laura P.,San Francisco  CA,321,197,134,5/30/2011,5.0,Ok  ok I'll finally give this place the stars I think it deserves. What pushed me to finally review? The Ahi salad. Seared fresh ahi  avocado  cabbage  FRESH baby greens (it's amazing how often they are not fresh other places) spinach  marinated cucumbers and tomatoes. UM yes please thank you.They also have gluten free pizza and beer.  What more could a girl ask for? Oh yeah  excellent service! Our server Chelsea was great.I'm not saying BJ's is up there with Michael Mina or anything  but for this category  this BJ's gets my 5 stars. Bravo!
Jacquelyn H.,Concord  CA,45,84,6,7/18/2013,4.0,We have been here a few times and no complaints here. I love the avocado egg rolls  yum! I didn't give it 5 stars because there is nothing out of this world about this place.
Christopher H.,Oakland  CA,11,21,,12/1/2011,4.0,1. The food. BJ's food is all pretty good for it's type  price  and location. Pizza is definitely their better dishes but I've enjoyed their pastas and burgers. Salads are probably their weakest dish.2. Ambiance is pretty good in the Concord one. TV's everywhere with plenty of space and a nice central bar.3. Waiters have always been pretty good and never had an issue with any of them. In fact when my girlfriends order was messed up once they took special care to correct it and give her extra.4. It's a good moderately priced place to hang. This is definitely my neighborhood restaurant.
Karen S.,Danville  CA,13,50,1,1/8/2011,2.0,Updated 6/2911 - I tried the vegetarian pizza for lunch and would go back again for it.While the restaurant is clean and pretty the food I've eaten here is seriously unremarkable. I've tried many things in my visits - salads  soup  pasta  burger  sandwiches and none of them have flavor and for as many calories as are jam packed into a meal I don't come away feeling satisfied. The ambience is great  the service is ok but the food is what makes me not want to go back. Maybe I should try happy hour there!
Grace L.,San Diego  CA,1144,621,560,7/22/2010,2.0,"Wow.....somehow I\'m the queen of ""let\'s go to an alehouse at the most inopportune time ever.""During this lunch visit  Concord High seniors just had their graduation  so the place was swarming with 17 & 18 year olds and their clans. On top of that  the bar was completely filled because of World Cup. One star for being seated somewhat soon despite being really busy.Another star for the food  which was decent. We had the chicken caesar salad and the fish tacos. One thing they forgot to do: dressing on the side. Big no-no. The tacos I enjoyed because they had this delicious avocado salsa to accompany it. Minus 3 stars for the service. It\'s been well over a month and I can still remember how unprofessional and snooty the waitress was. When we mentioned the ""dressing on the side"" issue  she responded  ""Oh sorry about that. Our kitchen is incompetent."" Wow. Seriously? I can interpret that in so many ways  don\'t even get me started. And maybe it was her fault to begin with for not writing down the order correctly.Unfortunately  I\'ll probably find myself here another time or two because of its vicinity to the mall. I\'ll just remind myself not to go on gamedays and make sure my waitress isn\'t a snooty you-know-what."
Frankie-Rain M.,Antioch  CA,99,3,,9/20/2013,1.0,Horrible service. We came here to celebrate my nephews birthday & it was pretty much soiled because of the service.
JM L.,Vallejo  CA,1,5,2,11/17/2013,1.0,11.17.13. Just left the restaurant...hungry and disappointed! Got there at about 8:40 pm. We were promised about 15 minutes of wait. There were a LOT of vacant tables  one section was completely empty. At about 9:10  for some odd reason - we were asked to wait for another 30 minutes. Unbelievable!
C M.,Santa Barbara  CA,33,101,162,8/10/2011,2.0,Blah. Meh. I can see why some people might like the bar  but steer clear of the restaurant. Granted it is attached to a mall so my expectations were low  but the service was the worst I've had anywhere in a long time. We waited so long for everything. Server was really nice but clearly they were shorthanded. Food was just so so. Bland bland bland. I had the pale beer sampler  they brew on site. All 4 came out warm  taste was decent  best was the hefeweizen. 3 in the group tried the house made sodas  those were really good.Only other possitive I can see is if you want to watch sports there a ton of TVs with all the games.
Ken F.,Martinez  CA,11,37,9,2/17/2011,4.0,"Went to BJ\'s last night and had some great eats during Happy Hour. My first time to BJs was a couple of weeks ago for a business meeting (Yes it really was a meeting). I had the Hefeweizen and OMG! - it was the best Hefeweizen I had ever had and probably one of the top 5 beers I had ever had in my life. (The best was the Guinness I had at the brewery in Dublin  Ireland.) Anyway....just had to go back and take my wife Michele. She got a glass of the BJ\'s P.M. Porter to start with. Our first order was for the calamari. Not the best calamari we had ever had  but darn close. Next came the pulled pork BBQ sliders  four of them on a plate with fries and cold claw. They were excellent but  \'What\'s with the coleslaw??""  What they served was a tease. About two good mouth fulls. I wouldn\'t be complaining if it wasn\'t so good. Hey BJs - how about at least doubling the amount served with the sliders!Another Hefeweizen for me (damn it was good!) and one for Michele  and we were just about done. Then came dessert - Triple Chocolate Pizookie made with some Ghirardelli chocolate. It is a chocolate cookie -(more like a thin brownie) made with chunks of Ghirardelli chocolate and topped with two scoops of double chocolate ice cream with Ghirardelli chocolate chips and a Ghirardelli dark chocolate square. The waitress was kind enough to bring me a small glass of the Stout to have with it. It was the perfect finish to a night out with my girlfriend. And we still got home in time to watch Survivor."
Christina S.,Oakland  CA,68,118,88,8/27/2012,3.0,I don't know how to put this... I feel like BJs doesn't care about me. This is the 10th time I've been here and it's always like somethings missing: literally. If it's not one fork/napkin roll on a table for 2 people...or we're waiting to order drinks for 20 minutes or they've forgotten I ordered something... I know why we keep coming back though: I like drinks  and my boyfriend likes this one sandwich. It's just a turkey club  but they put it on garlic bread. He loves it. So we have to come back. But even still  I'm constantly trying all the beers  drinks  and menu items  and he's getting the same thing he always orders: the verdict still stands. Not consistent. I've had 50% of my food be out of this world amazing  the other 50% sub par. All the drinks and their beers are great. But the service is really weak half the time  I thought that it was because it's always so busy there. Yesterday we came by for lunch and that's the time no one asked us for drinks until they took our whole order! Drinks  appetizers and entrees! I was like OMG if you bring them all out to us in 45 minutes I'm going to lose it. I need at least a glass of water RIGHT NOW.
Amanda Z.,San Francisco  CA,2,41,22,12/10/2010,4.0,Hostesses were a little off in their own world. I was standing there for about 5 minutes before she acknowledge me. Our waitress was great! Food was good (large portions).Drinks were made well. There was three of us and the booth tables are a litttttle small  but I still enjoyed the experience and would definitely go again.
Barbara S.,Concord  CA,0,18,33,1/19/2013,2.0,The service is usually slow and mistakes by servers or the kitchen crew happen often. The restrooms often need attention. Parking is terrible. Some of its servers apparently do not understand that it is not OK to run into occupied chairs or tables and that some sort of acknowledgement or apology is appropriate when they jostle a guest  especially when the guest is in the middle of eating or drinking something.BJ's uses an outside company to administer its frequent customer rewards program and this restaurant frequently fails to do what it needs to do to give guests the reward points they've earned for eating/drinking there. When a guest notices the problem and complains  sometimes the restaurant fixes the mistake but it usually takes more than 10 minutes to do it. Even worse  sometimes the management tries to blame it on the outside company and is not sincerely apologetic. I think this restaurant is extremely lucky. Much of its success is due to its prime location at the Sunvalley Mall.On the other hand  the steaks (when cooked to order) are usually superb  and many other selections are very nice. It's great that servers always ask guests who order steaks to cut into the steaks in front of the servers to make sure the steaks are cooked correctly.
Juhwi K.,Pleasant Hill  CA,27,39,11,11/28/2010,5.0,Yes I know this is one of those chain restaurants but seriously my bf and I LOVE this place!!!! they got great selections of beer ( try their bjs hefeweizen!! its pretty darn good =) ) and for food I know they got similar menu like cheesecake factory - thick and too many selections ) but their small bites menu is cheap and delicious for party of two and just dont go for their deep dish lol you can only get good deep dish only in chicago but Bjs got pretty good thin bread pizza =) and service wish depends on what time or what day you go if its really really busy you need to expect slow service but everytime we went  they were at least showing effort to keep our beer glass full =)
Annette W.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,48,1,10/16/2013,3.0,I've been here a few times. The service is usually pretty good. The sandwiches are great. I also like their choices for salads. Portion size is large to say the least. I did try the Fish and Chips and that is one dish I would not recommend. Very greasy. Good atmosphere.
Cindy N.,Bay Area  CA,153,30,26,10/6/2010,4.0,so i had my 21st birthday dinner here and i had reserved my birthday for 7:30pm the table wasn't even ready till 8:40pm that was like 50 min wait! i came in 10 min early just to tell them i was here but they still took hella long but i was fine with it in the end cause i guess it gave my guests to get acquainted with each other then when we finally sat down and my friends ordered some appetizers calamari which was pretty good which was $8.75 and the mozzarella sticks which i wasn't a big fan at the price $7.09 it was not worth it.Alex and Manny both had the hefeweizen they both liked it which was only $4.95 for good quality beer as all the guys told me which i wouldn't know since i never liked beer in the first place.My first drink of the night was PEACHY KEEN SANGRIA which was $5.75 this drink was really good it was made with Grey Goose L'Orange Vodka  Stoli Razberi Vodka  Beringer White Zinfandel  Monin white peach  pineapple and orange juices with a slash of grenadine which was in a pretty glass with a slice of orange and cherry i didn't expect it to be as strong as it would be cause i had a sangria at applebees and it tasted like juice to me.me and alex ordered a meduim great white pizza made with creamy Alfredo sauce with mushrooms  garlic  fresh Roma tomatoes  Parmesan cheese and grilled chicken breast which was hands down the best pizza ever bj's are famous for their deep dish pizza's they didn't have anymore medium great white so the waitress upgraded us to a large for the charge of a medium pizza wow super nice right? my second drink was the strawberry confusion omg she spilled some on my dress but she was super sorry about it and got me some wet napkins and got me a new one this drink has to be my favorite drink of the night i downed it so quick it was made with Hpnotiq Liqueur  Stoli Razberi Vodka  pineapple juice and a splash of strawberry this drink was $8.50 i got 1 and a half glasses of this drink so i was happy!then she came out with my birthday pizoozkie and everyone started singing happy birthday to me aww and omg it was soo good it was right on point =)our bill came up to $185.89 and i had 12 people together at my dinner so it was 17% gratuity hehe i had such nice friends that dinner was on them i love them so much!overall it was all worth it and i would come back anytime!
Joe S.,Pleasant Hill  CA,1,52,,8/31/2010,2.0,I only had take out from this place and it was on someone else's dime so I can't comment on service or price.The ribs here is surprising good. Not the best ribs I had  but certainly not the worse.The pizza here sucks. Don't get it.
Sun E.,Bay Area,529,153,1,6/9/2010,2.0,1.5 stars rounded up in their favor.This was a destination visit and holy crap...quite a letdown.The ambiance is spectacular.But that is where spectacular ends for me.Simply put...I feel it is overrated and overpriced as a whole.Service really needs a major overhaul...slooooow inaccurate and forgetful.Our visit was early lunch time; there were only a few tablesof customers in the place.It took over 10 minutes to be acknowledged by the server.And by golly  service only went downhill from there.Our appetizer order was messed up miserably; it should havebeen comped but wasn't. When the correct appetizer was finally served (after the meals) we were blown away by the poor preparation of the potato skins.Toppings were incredibly sparse.Some skins had no cheese at all  others had no bacon...really sparse and lame for a spendy fee AND consideringthe order had originally been messed up by the server.Simply put- a huge ripoff.Boo.My salad cost $11.25 and was missing an ingredient.I couldn't tell the server because he didn't get to our tableto check on us until we had almost finished our entrees.For $11.25  I had hoped for a HUGE salad...not.I was still hungry after finishing it. Can't comment on the beers because we don't drink.If you haven't already guessed...nope  do not recommend.
H. R.,Pleasant Hill  CA,45,49,3,10/21/2010,2.0,Food: OkDrinks: StrongBiggest bone of contention... I ordered a drink  they were out of orange juice. Someone brought me a drink and told me it was the one i'd first tried to order. When i explained i was told there was no orange juice the gentleman said oh they must have found some. I continue to take a few sips of this drink he brought me. The waitor comes back and says yea that wasn't your drink and TAKES IT AWAY!! At least give me the option of paying for it. He said he had to take it away. In my opinion if you mess up an order that's on your back  you never take away someone's food for your mistake. I worked in the industry  that's how it should go!
Sam A.,Benicia  CA,232,694,304,4/5/2011,2.0,I do not get the allure of BJ's - I have been to this location twice and a different one once  and I just don't see it. The food has been wildly mediocre. Sandwich  chicken strips  appetizers  pizza - none of it made me want to come back and have another. Cool atmosphere  nice servers and friendly customer service  but food that makes me want to cook rather than go out.
Vicki E.,Sacramento  CA,24,43,,8/22/2010,2.0,I've eaten at this particular BJ's on a few occasions  however.. I must admit that I was greatly disappointed by the service we received this evening. Server was polite  but once she took our order  she pretty much abandoned us for her other tables  which were getting much better service than we were.Food  as always  was wonderful.
Jeremy V.,Hayward  CA,71,75,2,6/29/2011,2.0,"Overrated. The food is decent  but the service  price and waiting time is not worth the while. The prices are on the steep side of ""moderate."" I have a difficult time seeing coming here and having a genuinely enjoyable experience with my money and time.However  there are some positives. The positives include the actual selection of beers available. The sampler is often a good  fun choice and the pizookie is pretty good  as well. Otherwise  I can find similar styles of food  drinks  and better service at a smaller box restaurant like TGI Friday\'s  Chili\'s  or Applebee\'s at a slightly lower price  in addition to a more-comfortable feel to go with it  as BJ\'s is huge."
Jim L.,Walnut Creek  CA,4,12,5,9/27/2013,2.0,Food has always been ok  but the service has overall been poor. 3 of 4 times I ate there I can say the service was mediocre at best..I was in food service for 8 years myself and not impressed with the waitstaff.
Patrick Gabriel L.,San Ramon  CA,699,307,1235,3/10/2013,3.0,Good location being adjoined to the mall is the redeeming factor. Service could have been better too. I like deep dish pizza  but I prefer Zachary's.
A. L.,Dublin  CA,42,78,14,7/21/2012,5.0,BJ's in Newark received 3 stars from me. Same food here. Better service. I live in the Easy Bay and my boyfriend and I drive all the way up here because their service has NEVER disappointed us. And they never question my cheese-free  gluten-free pizza orders ;)Food always gets delivered quickly and the servers are exceptionally awesome. I never get names  but we've had a fabulous server (and take out specialists) each time we go.Recommend this BJ's all the way! :)
Natasha A.,Vallejo  CA,80,39,2,4/4/2011,2.0,"This place seems to get worse and worse with each visit. The first time I went here was when it first opened. The service was just ""ok"" and the food was decent. I figured that since the place was new  they were still trying to get their act together. I have been there a few times since  and each time my experience seemed to be worse then the one before. The quality of their food has gone way down hill. Their sandwich combos are a joke. Sub-par sandwiches that I could have made better at home  and salads that are just soggy and wilted. Their soups have always been either too bland or too salty  and tasted as if they came straight out of a can. Their pizzas have also gone down hill. They are sloppily made  and have considerably less am mount of toppings then when they first opened (I know times are tough and places are trying to cut back  but skimping on pizza toppings to save a few pennies is not the way to do it.) They last time we went  I decided to order a bunch of the ""small bite"" items to share with the table. At $4 - $6 a pop  I thought these would be good appetizer sized items that we can munch of while drinking a beer. These ""small bites"" were literally 3 or 4 bites each. I ordered the friend artichokes (awful tasting and overly greasy)  and mozzarella salad (looked like a small mound of shredded cheese in brown sauce  and only have a few actual pieces of cheese in it) and the bruschetta (4 small sad pieces of cold bread with a couple chucks of tomato on top.) The items were so sad and pitiful looking  and they tasted so bland and awful  I should have just saved my money and used it to buy another beer. The only good this this place has going for it is that they have a wide selection of beers. Other then that  the food is horrible  and their service is slow  and even for the moderately prices menu I would not even waste my money on the food. I\'ll only go here again is my friends really want to go there (and if they pay for me) but other then that  there are many more places with better food to go to."
Lance C.,Citrus Heights  CA,32,54,1,7/26/2011,4.0,We had a party of 7 eat lunch here today  we all had the rootbeer for a drink  i was not a big fan.for appatiser i had the stuffed mushrooms  they were tasty.my main course was the soup and salad  both were goodthe service was really good
Maria T.,Alameda  CA,1,6,,3/8/2012,2.0,It's alright! not all that maybe only go there during lunch next timewaiting FOREVER for a table for 4 place was nice felt bad for our waitress every drink we ordered she came back to apologize that they ran out of this or that to make the drinks.. so..My food was alright ordered the Thai salmon Eh i could of made it better my wifes food and my kids food looked better than minedesert was probably the only thing I was happy about there...Oh not to mention the creepy girl that walked in with booty shorts and a tank top it's almost 10 pm cold as heck outside and she is just wondering around all creepy standing in front of peoples tables staring ( mind you no one even bothered to kick her out ) so this place was alright I guess..Might go back but def not a fave of mine
Michelle L.,Concord  CA,0,1,,12/26/2010,1.0,Lets start off with how terrible the hostesses are. They all sat around and did absolutely NOTHING while they all bossed one girl around that sat us to our table. Seems like they were more interested in criticizing everyone else than doing their job. There was one hostess that was nice and did her job correct but after being disheveled by the previous hostesses i was already upset and shut this one out. Server: TERRIBLE! Just as dramatic as the hostesses. Luckily i got the name. Sarah i believe it was. I came in with a big party and asked to split the bill. She split it in a way that was so inconvenient for me! Luckily i gottospeak with the manager. I could complain forever.Overall not a good experience.
Grace C.,Martinez  CA,28,15,1,9/17/2012,4.0,My husband and I went here on Sunday to watch the 49ers game. We got the party for two which was a great deal! We ended up waiting for over 40 min for our pizza. The manager came over and said that he would take care of our meal because we had been waiting so long. We never even said anything but the manager was really paying attention to the customers.
Chira E.,Concord  CA,185,309,27,9/27/2012,4.0,"Personally  I don\'t think there is much to be said about chain restaurants.   Mediocre food  and basic service is what I have grown to expect. After a fiasco at a so called ""M.A.C launch"" (another review  another time) my friend and I decided to spend time sipping on a glass of Cab at BJ\'s rather than standing in a horrendous line. The stars were aligned because we sat at the bar  and we were informed by the courteous bartender that all wine was half off on Tuesday! Word?!!? So not only was the wine half off; being the dutiful Yelp checker inner that I am  I realized that there was a special ( not on the menu  only privy information for us Yelpers). The special included two salads of your choice  medium pizza of your choice  and dessert pizza of your choice for...wait for it....$19.99! Word!??! I am quite discriminating when it comes to my pizza  and this pizza was quite good with an excellent crust. BJ\'s you are all right with me."
Telzey G.,Pleasant Hill  CA,15,172,23,3/23/2013,1.0,"All around bad...actually our server himself was very nice  it is just that everything was so slow. We had to ask for silverware 3 times and the cobb salad was terrible. Won\'t be back. I spent too much of my very precious time sitting and waiting. Also  if you sit outside  the ""smoking"" area is RIGHT next to the outdoor patio...so I smelled gross smoke the whole time."
Steve K.,El Dorado Hills  CA,25,545,21,2/25/2011,4.0,BJ's has always been a favorite... So  where to start? How about the Happy Hour half-price mini-pizzas (bar only)... Or the nice selection of Belgian beers? Or the fantastic deep-dish pizzas and home-style dishes like meatloaf  fried chicken  and pot roast? And  of course  the famous Pizookie dessert... I'd say you almost cannot go wrong with any of the food here.Their own beers are not bad  but they also have a very nice selection of liquors at the tall  full bar  and plenty of TV's to watch if there's a game on.You won't be disappointed with the food and drinks here
John Y.,San Ramon  CA,1,179,50,10/17/2010,2.0,Been here 3 times and wanted to like it more. Especially with the prices  I want to like it more. First off  the atmosphere is nice. Kind of like an Elephant Bar/PF Changs/Cheescake Factory type of place. It's like an upscale Applebees. The waitstaff is almost all the early 20's  1st or 2nd job out of high school type. That also seems to be their target audience. Young  college-age or young family types. The restaurants are very clean and everything is new. So  that's very nice.The service is o.k. Being that their audience is the young crowd  the waitstaff is also very young and maybe not so attentive/experienced  the way you would like. Our service has been o.k. overall. But  my most recent experience was that it took a very  very long time to get our food. When the food did finally start coming  the orders were wrong and the food was cold. The food. This is where this place fails miserably. They DO have generous helpings. Just about everything sets you up for a nice meal. The atmosphere  the prices  the niceness. Everything is just o.k. I wouldn't mind if the prices were less or the 'expectations' were less. My burger  was not cooked right/overdone. (I asked for medium rare). But  o.k. no biggie. It was lukewarm. It wasn't juicy at all. Not much in the way of condiments on the burger either. A simple mid-level burger and they messed up! I'd rather pay a lot less  get it faster  get it better at In N Out!!! I hate to be so harsh. The previous times I've been here  I never really liked it either. Just o.k. Nothing to write home about.  One good thing  is that they have a lot of beers on tap and they have a full bar. So  I think their audience is well served. Just don't go for the food.
Giacomo S.,Pleasant Hill  CA,352,13,2,7/4/2013,2.0,You know  the beer selection is great. The food is okay  but the service....they try. It just seems when I come in for dinner and wait for a seat in the dining room  they keep you waiting..just very slow service. When you are at the bar  the service is much quicker. This past visit  they just forgot about us  apps out in 30 minutes  dinner  fries cold  not out at the same time and incomplete order. Server was a nice kid  but overwhelmed with the way the sections are setup in the dining room. I would expect better service for the price. Never saw a manager either.
Helen K.,Lafayette  CA,74,378,37,5/12/2010,1.0,SLOW serviceBADfood.Good only for drinks but the acoustics are off. The place is cavernous and packed. I can overlook a lot when the staff tries hard (and they really do)  but even they could not save this disaster of a dinner. Strike three  BJ's you're out!
Jen G.,Oakland  CA,53,101,92,3/5/2013,3.0,I love BJ's!!!! I have been to 3 locations and I always enjoy the beer. Either the Blonde or the Hef. I usually get the artichoke/Spinach deep dish pizza. It is so good! But this time I was feeling a burger since I only eat them about twice a year. I ordered the Spicy Jalapeno Burger and it was definitely lacking. There were only 3 little jalapenos under the bun and the secret sauce they used was a mere squirt. I had to ask for extra sauce. I probably wouldn't order that again. Id go back to the deep dish or a salad. My boyfriend loved the Jeremiah Red and even bought a few 22oz bottles to go:) even though the burger was meh.....we will be back if we get hungry while at that mall.
M. W.,San Francisco  CA,32,30,3,8/19/2013,2.0,Too long wait to be seated  too long wait for just two kid's meal and one adult dish. (We waited 45 minutes for that.) The food was not that delicious either. I wonder if it is because they are short staffed in the kitchen  or short staffed on the floor. I suspect it is both.
Kymberli C.,Clayton  CA,136,1486,5781,4/30/2010,3.0,I used to LOVE eating at BJ's before they opened this location. Maybe it's lost its excitement because it's so close to home or maybe it's just this location but It just doesn't have its appeal anymore. The two times that I've eaten here  I got bad tummy aches following. I will come back when I am craving a pizookie.
Rebecca P.,Pittsburg  CA,0,5,1,1/3/2014,4.0,I love their happy hour... specially at night service is good but food might take a little long sometimes and their pozookie is just great
Rebecca P.,Concord  CA,1,1,,11/19/2012,1.0,Service was slow  the pizza was under cooked  and when we ordered an appetizer it came out with the dinner food I wouldn't recommend going here
Eleanor D.,Hercules  CA,143,148,171,8/28/2010,2.0,It's just your typical american cuisine bar food. I came here with a bunch of friends today hoping for some good quality food.We ordered Fried CalamariPot stickers& for an entree i ordered the chili cheeseburger.So for starters the calamari was heavily breaded  and the squid was non existent. The potstickers were basically the same as the ones you buy at costco and make yourselves. As for what i ordered.. I wanted to throw up after the third bite. The plus side of the whole experience was that our waitress was extremely helpful and nice.
Sophie S.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,4,,12/29/2014,2.0,Everytime I go here I complain. The food is just so BLEH and PLAIN. Nothing special about it all. Will not be going back.
Ann D.,Moreno Valley  CA,17,64,7,10/19/2013,5.0,Love it! My husband always wants to come here for the Cookies and Cream Pizookie or the white chocolate macadamia Pizookie. I in the other hand come here for the Alcoholic drinks  last time we came they had some sparkling strawberry lemonade with some alcohol. It was really good but not too strong. Food is also delicious like the calamari or avocado rolls. yumm!
SANDY M.,Concord  CA,13,89,,5/18/2010,2.0,This review is based on the pizza!! I had high expectations about their pizza  cus its deep dish! Sorry to say but mann....it was so dry! Very disappointing!
Denia S.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,40,,6/22/2012,2.0,"Hostess stuck up and rude today at our 11:15 lunch and had us wait even though there was no one in there. Service was good in the beginning  only because they want you to order and turn the table over. Our waitress pretty much harassed us into ordering and her comment everytime was ""have you made your selection yet?"" I mean  seriously?? And after thanking her she would say ""my pleasure""  once or twice with that was enough already. After we ordered our waitress was no where to be found. Had to ask for ketchup  refills  the check  and then she never came back for the credit card so I slammed two $20s in there and left. Very stuck up attitude in there with their workers. Yes  you are workers!!Food was excellent  though  so too bad about the crappy service. Clam chowder was excellent and so were our sandwiches. I\'d like to go back but I am big on service so probably won\'t return."
Adriel H.,Danville  CA,276,108,9,7/22/2010,4.0,Great lively atmosphere with a layout that makes it feel spacious  yet cozy at the same time. Plenty of seating indoor and outdoor  but there is usually a lot of people which is always a good sign. Plenty of televisions showing a variety of sports. Service is decent and up to par if not better with other joint semi classy restaurant chains (up to par with elephant bar  P.F. Changs; better than cheesecake factory service)Onto the food  THE go to spot for authentic deep dish chicago styled pizza in the east bay. The crust is a near perfect blend of chewy goodness yet crispy on the edges. The pizzas are flavorful with unique combinations. The root beer is of above par quality  where it is rich and creamy and authentic compared to sodas  these are far superb. The Bizookies for dessert are delicious! Scoops of ice cream over a warm chewy fresh cookie. Definitely come by here if you want quality deep dish pizza and root beer! Plenty of parking in the Great Mall lot. Good for large group semi formal celebrations to a casual date with a friend.
D C.,San Francisco  CA,15,306,152,6/3/2012,1.0,Service is just awful  and not sure why this is generating so much business. It's just another Cheese Cake Factory but without the cheese cake
byron s.,Concord  CA,0,5,,6/13/2010,2.0,Pros: Unlimited refills on house soda.5+ toppings priced as 4 toppings.Cons:Doesn't fully cook their Pizookies (repeatedly)Occasionally slow serviceTo Go orders undercooked and soggyDarkWhen you order a pizookie  make sure you tell them to cook it longer. They reliably undercook the pizookie  so that it is the consistency of dough. The edges are crispy  but the whole of the center is a gummy mess. Cookie dough is good  but warm? It doesn't taste good  and after the second time of sending the undercooked order to be rectified  it had better be frickin cooked.Pizookies taste great when properly cooked. The problem is  properly cooked pizookies are becoming a significant rarity.
Gogo M.,Oakland  CA,0,4,,12/21/2013,5.0,I joined the rewards program  maze well since I eat there now and then. I like there pizza which to me is one of the top 3 places to get a decent pizza.
Craig K.,Brentwood  CA,11,63,1,7/13/2010,4.0,First time visit  Tuesday at 11:30 for lunch. Not too busy  service was very attentive and food was served quickly. Lunch menu pricing is great  and portion sizes were just right. The Tomato Bisque with Grilled Ham and Cheese was terrific  and so was the Triple Chocolate Pizookie. House brewed root beer was nothing special. Henry Weinhardts Private Reserve Root Beer is much better  and should be the gold standard to which all other Root Beers  especially home brews  strive to be.Will definitely try BJ's Brewhouse again.
Mrs. M.,Concord  CA,9,6,,7/14/2013,2.0,We have been to BJ's several times. The food has always been good and  until today  the service was good. Tonight (7:00 pm) the service was horrible! We waited a long time until the waitress took our drink orders. No explanation. I asked for ice tea with lemon  to start. I received no lemon until I asked three different people. No sugar  no straws  again until I asked someone else. Our waitress kept on mysteriously disappearing. When our salads arrived  I had to ask for silverware. The food was good  but the wait was silly. Again  no waitress. When she brought our bill  we put our card out right away. Yes  again  she disappeared. I had to bring the check up to the main desk to have it run up because I had no idea where the disappearing waitress was. When the bill to be signed FINALLY arrived  no explanation. I did tell the front desk. They apologized  but honestly  someone needs to wake that waitress up! Everyone else was doing her job!No tip for her  either.
Jessica K.,Hayward  CA,0,6,1,9/28/2013,1.0,There was a CHOCOLATE CHIP on my pizza crust.. I will NEVER come back to this place. I am beyond disgusted. Now I would like to add the manager did try to rectify the situation by giving a complimentary soup and by bringing out another pizza but for this to even have happened in the first place?! eewww I now rank them right along side Applebee's... This is my 5th time coming here and I have had problem 3 out of the 5 times... Save yourself and don't eat here  maybe just grab a beer
Angelica B.,Concord  CA,11,85,15,3/29/2013,2.0,We stopped coming here a couple of years ago due to the slow service. We went back tonight and the service was slow. The deep dish pizza  kids meals  salad and chowder and pizookie were good.
rebecca f.,Pittsburg  CA,63,19,1,8/28/2012,4.0,Mmmmm. Love coming here. Great place for a date night Or girls night out. Hey i even took my Mom here on mothers day and had a good time. It can get really busy especially on the weekends  but i believe you can call ahead and reserve which is a plus. They also offer take out which is excellent considering they're food is delicious. Appetizers are cheap and yummy. A lot of there drinks are signature drinks created by Bj's employes from all over. Cool  I know. Any ways i like Bj's especially this location and will continue coming here for good food and a wonderful atmosphere.
Marakia R.,Berkeley  CA,87,119,2,2/13/2013,4.0,All I come for is the black and bleu burger and the heff. PERIOD
E. Y. G.,Pinole  CA,90,205,64,3/31/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"Went back this weekend and my kid got super sick after eating here. Something funny about their fries....they tasted like fish and onion. Maybe old oil? Is it common practice to fry fish in the same area as the ""veggie"" items?AND...my ""deep dish pizza"" was just fluffy bread with a like coating of toppings. WTF?"
Gary M.,Concord  CA,3,5,,9/13/2013,4.0,I always eat in the bar area and have fast and efficient service. The food is always excellent and comes out hot and at the appropriate time  like after the apetizer. Love going and watch the sporting events on the TV.
Christina J.,Walnut Creek  CA,4,28,8,4/23/2013,2.0,I've been here a hand full of times and each was a different experience in terms of service. Sometimes we have great service  sometimes it's okay and sometimes I feel like I need to stand up and wave my arms around to get the attention of the waitstaff. This wouldn't be my choice of place to go to eat dinner however  my friends and I used to come here for happy hour. I've sat both at the bar and in the main dining area. The food is okay  nothing special. We've tried a variety of different foods and nothing stands out and spectacular. I wouldn't come here unless someone else decided they really wanted to and invited me  even then I'd have to think about it.
Alex M.,Oakland  CA,0,42,,3/14/2014,2.0,I was super excited to eat at BJ's in Concord because I had a blast at the one down in LA  but I ended up being super disappointed here. I'm not sure if the food is prepared differently for happy hour or not.. we arrived in time for it. Every food item we ordered from the happy hour menu was greasy. The avocado rolls I have been craving forever were badly made with old avacados. The chips that came with the artichoke dip were stale. The pizza was ehh. Food would have been okay if I was plastered.. which brings us to the best part of the night- alcohol! The drinks during happy hour are good; 5 bucks for a decent mint mojito and 4.50 for any craft beer. Yiss.
Maria G.,San Pablo  CA,96,6,2,8/19/2013,2.0,Food was good service was sub par. Lighting inside was horrible might be to hide some things? I've been here various times so this isn't a bad experience review but 1 time did force me to come here and vent. Lets just say they need new management and a bit more thurough hiring process.
Rachel B.,Hayward  CA,122,684,102,6/26/2012,1.0,Disgusting microwaved  super salty processed food. Even a monkey could cook better at home.
Bob H.,Payette  ID,0,11,,11/9/2013,3.0,Are here yesterday evening. We did the pick up. I had burger and fries. Good meat  a little under cooked. That is why I give it a three star. The wedge friends were great. My nephew had the Salmon  and it was very good. I have had steaks here that were very good  but I didn't enjoy the salad that came with it. It a busy place for dine in or take out  but can be noisy too.
Melissa J.,El Sobrante  CA,1,37,1,2/7/2013,4.0,My husband and I love the appetizers here. We usually get the spinach and artichoke dip  egg rolls and the potato skins. Always delicious. BJ's is usually busy and it has a lively atmosphere. The best place for service is at the bar. When my husband and I eat in the restaurant area we have to wait an unusually a long time before we are asked what we want to drink and what to order. One time  a girl who was there seeing her boyfriend (her boyfriend worked there) had him wait on us because after 20 minutes or server never came. Granted this extreme happened once  we usually do have to wait a while before we are given service.
Krystal A.,Martinez  CA,1,12,2,8/23/2014,1.0,"Me and 5 of my friends went to the BJ\'s in concord last night and we literally had the WORST service EVER! If I could give 0 stars  I would. First off  we called about 40 minutes prior to us arriving for their call ahead seating for up to 6 people in your party. When we arrived at 8pm we told the host that we did the call ahead seating and stated the name is was under  they could not find my friends name that she put it under. Then they continued to explain to us that our wait time starts when we arrive  I asked what\'s the point of call ahead seating then and she said that she thinks calls ahead seating should only be for parties of 5 and under. So then  we waited our 30 minutes to be seated and then waiting about another 10 minutes before anyone greeted us. When our server greeted us he took our drink order right away  but then didn\'t see him for about 20 minutes. When he arrived with our drinks he then stated that he forgot to ring in one of my friends drinks from the bar  well we all already knew how long their drinks from the bar take so needless to say my friend was bummed that he was going to have to wait another 20 minutes to get his drink. After we got our 1st round of drinks he never asked us if we were ready to order or anything  he just dropped our drinks and left  he came back about 15 minutes later and took our order for our dinner (this is around 930pm  we\'ve been at our table for an hour before he took our dinner order). At the time he took our dinner order we all ordered another round of drinks. It took probably 30 minutes for us to get our dinner and when it arrived  my friend ordered a large pizza and my boyfriend ordered a small pizza  the guy who brought our pizzas didn\'t say watch your hands  hot plates  no he just slid the hot pizza pans across he table and almost burnt my boyfriends hand if he didn\'t move it on time. Then it took about another 15 minutes for us to get our drinks and this time he OVER ordered drinks  some of us didn\'t want another round and I even had a non alcoholic drink and I never got another one. Lets just say our server was VERY overwhelmed and desperately needed help with his tables. When it came time for our bill to come he just dropped it and walked away  I numbered everything 1 2  3 (there was 3 couples) and told him to just split everything with the numbers on the side of what was ordered  he then said ""I will try  but its going to take while to do this for you"" ... If I already numbered everything for you it shouldn\'t take that long. 15 minutes later he comes and just gives everyone a receipt with no booklet and he STILL got things wrong and put other peoples items on eachothers checks! We got there at 8pm and left at 11pm!! I have never had that bad of service ever! I just couldn\'t believe it  I will probably not be going back to that BJ\'s"
Justin M.,San Francisco  CA,1,7,,9/19/2010,5.0,Been to this location numerous time for happy hour and dinner. Great service and food every time.During happy hour I usually just order an appetizers and drinks with friends with friends. The appetizers are $2.00 off regular price  which usually comes out to $6.50ish. I wish that happy hour prices were half off like other places. I recommend getting the nachos and the spinach dip. They serve you a large amount and they are very good. Tried the calamari and the chicken lettuce wrap and they were just alright.For dinner the deep dish pizza are a must. Ive tried the bbq chicken pizza and it is my favorite one. The sauce was not too sweet or tangy  just right. Then the chicken was perfect and not over cooked. The only other pizza i've tried is the Mediterranean. This pizza was alright. I a little too salty for my taste. Toppings include pest  roasted garlic and sun dried tomatoes. For desert I get a pizookie. They give you the options for different kinds of cookie and to go half and half. I look forward to this every time I got to BJ'sThe service has always been great at this location  whether I am eating during happy hour or dinner. The hostess and servers are very friendly and always have great smiles. It doesn't look like they hate their jobs or are waiting to get off shift. One time our server forgot one of our appetizers and our pizza came out before it had. She asked us if we still would like the dish but we declined. Couldn't fault her  it looked like a busy night and it happens. No complaints from us or anything. The manager came up to us and apologized for the mistake and gave us the appetizer anyways  for free. This was soooo legit.Great food at every bj's location  but what makes this one my favorite is the proximity to the mall and the great service. I will continue to come to this location and eat great food.
Heather L.,Benicia  CA,4,48,,7/23/2011,4.0,Ate lunch here today. One thing I don't understnad is why the don't offer a lunch menu on the weekends. They said because most people have more time on weekends and the food on the lunch menu is designed to be made quickly. OK  but what about the poeple that don't eat those huge portions. SHe ended up letting me get a weekend lunch item. Which was very nice of her. Salad was good. BJ's is like an Applebees  but a little better. A good place overall for lunch. Drinks were quick  food didn't take long at all. Server had a smile on her face always friendly.
Peggy N.,Antioch  CA,239,324,3,1/5/2010,5.0,Now...let's get one thing clear. I LOVE me a good BJ  however  my event at the Lodi BJ's left a bad taste in my mouth.  ahhh... *smirk*The BJ's in Concord has redeemed my love of them and I'm here to give some lip therapy on my visit!I pouted about having to attend my husbands Christmas/Winter Solstace/Kwanzaa/Hanukkah dinner here. But I went because..well  he is my husband....and he promised to take me to Vinnie's afterward for a real drink. (score)We arrive  we are greeted and we are seated. Everyone orders a drink from very polite waitresses and we make small talk. The drinks arrive and I'm completely in heaven!They were good and strong just like I like 'em! Nothing else mattered from that point on because I was happy to have a great drink at a chain restaurant. My honey and I shared a sandwich and fries cuz I was full of booze (go figure) and not very hungry - from what I remember the sanwich was good.All in all I left impressed: from the service  to the bar to the food.As a bonus we left buzzed but walked it off with some last minute holiday shopping at the mall. As a bonus to that bonus  I did not have to run across town to Vinnies for a real drink.I'm happy to know we have great BJ's right here in Concord!
Mitra W.,Concord  CA,57,227,115,5/29/2010,3.0,Great beer and wine selection.Lot's to choose from (food).Nutritional information for EVERY dish in the back of menu.Customer service is hit or miss. Have had slow service when it was dead and fast service when it was packed. Never can tell. Mostly  everyone has been friendly.Prices are reasonable.Have had:Thai Style lettuce wraps-just OKChicken Pot Stickers-YUMMYAhi and Avocado Poke salad-Not bad at allBBQ Pulled Pork sando-SLAMMIN
colleen r.,Martinez  CA,23,27,4,4/3/2010,1.0,Some friends and I went here recently  and sorry I don't see what the big deal is. The food is lacking in quality  noisy and everyone and their brother in here. Why? I have no clue.I had the pot roast and it was terrible. The service was fine  but waiting in line to eat this crappy food is crazy. If you want some good food try Stanfords and WC. The ribs are terrific  they have flavor and the place has atmosphere. Unlike this dump.Run  run quickly away.
Bill B.,Martinez  CA,2,60,2,7/6/2011,3.0,"This place is OK  but I\'m not a huge fan of it. Service was quick and attentive  and they were quickly able to accommodate the large-ish group we brought along. Food was good  although the beef dishes tended to be overcooked. Their ""Rare"" is ""Medium"" everywhere else. Appetizers are tasty and generous in portion. Prices are fair.The beer is again good but not great.Atmosphere is crowded and noisy. Not good for a date  but if you have an after event crowd to feed  you could do worse.I hate writing middle of the road reviews but BJ\'s just stays right there in all respects. Go. You won\'t regret it  but you wont be cheering in the aisles either."
Lani P.,American Canyon  CA,13,3,10,1/11/2010,2.0,"Our latest visit to BJ\'s was a very disappointing one. Our server  while mildly polite  was horrible. Her name is Natalie. We ordered 6 sodas  only 3 of which had straws. Upon requesting more straws  she sarcastically said  ""I don\'t have straws with me  but I can bring you some."" She never did. We had to flag down the hostess who then brought us straws.She then gave us a stack of small plates for our appetizers at the end of the table. When we started passing them out  we noticed that several of them were dirty on the bottoms  with chocolate or BBQ sauce  which got all over our hands. Upon telling her about this  she said  ""It\'s probably just chocolate sauce. I\'ll bring you some clean ones."" She did not apologize at all for the dirty plates  and when we requested wet wipes for our hands  she said that you did not have those. Which was confusing  because on another occasion at BJ\'s  we thought we remembered receiving wet wipes with our buffalo wings or rib orders?Our food took a very long time to come. Throughout our meal she did not come back to check on us  or notice that we had many dirty plates and glasses to taken away and/or refilled. While we were there  the couple across the way from us were seated and ignored by her  so they ended up leaving without ordering.At the beginning of our visit  we mentioned that we had a birthday at our table and she patronizingly said Happy Birthday to my son. It wasn\'t until my mother-in-law inquired again before we left about something for the birthday boy  that she said that he does get a dessert. I don\'t believe she would\'ve mentioned that if we didn\'t ask.We had been excited about going to BJ\'s this visit  however  the experience was really bad. While we did leave Natalie a tip  it wasn\'t nearly what she would\'ve received if she had actually taken care of us. In fact  it was probably still more than she deserved."
Adam Z.,Concord  CA,62,14,,11/19/2010,4.0,Some really great beers with some good food. The pizza's are huge. I'm a deep dish fan and these don't disappoint. The BBQ chicken is great. The appetizers are one of a kind. Try the sampler  it's got a variety that you can't get at too many places. The service is a little slow. But I've never been in a hurry here. Just give me a Jeremiah Red or a Nutty Brewnette and I'm set. Those 2 are my favorite beers. The wheat is decent and their holiday pumpkin ale was awesome. The place is decked out with TV's and sports all day long. I loved going on Saturday's for college football. A different game on all the TV's. Not too loud and fairly comfortable seating. Bartenders are knowledgeable and they get to know you. Wait staff is nice and talkative.
Janet J.,Clayton  CA,10,24,,1/30/2013,3.0,I thought the food was delicious  but the service was way too slow.
R T.,San Jose  CA,4,108,3,3/3/2010,3.0,Last night was my first experience at BJ's  and it was super mediocre-- meaning nothing special. If it wasn't for our co-worker reunion  it probably would have been a terrible night.I ordered two Long Island Iced Teas  and it was too watered down (didn't taste the alcohol whatsoever). I was no where near buzzin'... but eh  what can you expect from a restaurant/bar? Not much  I suppose. The food was so-so as well. My pasta  Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo was quite dry. Not to mention the pasta itself was still hard!The service was horrible. Our waitress mentioned she had another big party like ours  but I guess she was more attentive on the other table... I don't mean to put you on blast  but our waitress  Mallory was horrible. She was rude  and rushing to kick us out when we were still eating our dinner asking if we wanted dessert. C'mon now! She's quite entertaining though  but that's about it. The automatic 17% gratuity isn't what you deserve. Trust me on this one  because our co-worker reunion was from a restaurant we all previously worked for. Been there  done that. Take some constructive criticism if you do happen to read this.
sharlyn g.,San Leandro  CA,50,143,87,10/7/2010,4.0,I love Bj's I hate going to the one in Newark though  because its soooo crowded ALL the time.Concord  on the other hand is busy but little to no wait for smaller parties. The service is always great   the food is good  and the Beer selection is WONDERFUL. a great place to unwind  and spend time with friends. =)
Jonathan R.,San Francisco  CA,678,47,4,6/13/2011,2.0,"I had heard so many great things about BJ\'s that I couldn\'t wait to go and try out their signature burger and their Ultimate Long Island. But there were too many things wrong with my experience:Strike 1: I tried their signature BJ\'s Burger with additional bacon  and the sandwich is served on a toasted garlic french roll instead of a traditional hamburger bun. Oddly enough  I didn\'t taste any garlic at all while biting into the roll. I had asked for my burger to be cooked medium-rare  and it was served medium-well. (At least the wedge-cut seasoned fries made up for the burger\'s lack of flavor and juiciness!)Strike 2: I was a bit disappointed in their Ultimate Long Island Iced Tea. It was watered down and had a dark amber color instead of the light blond color it should have. Lo and behold  with my first sip  my taste buds were assaulted with the sweet taste of PEPSI instead of the signature Coke. It also had notes of orange and other things that I do not believe should be in anything called a Long Island. (After drinking it  I looked up the ingredients online and realized that it is created with vodka  gin  rum  orange liquer  sweet & sour and Pepsi instead of the classic vodka  tequila  rum  gin  triple sec  sweet & sour  and Coke.) The mixture they serve is definitely NOT recommended.Strike 3: The area in which we were seated was facing a window at sunset. As the sun set behind the building  it suddenly came into view and the waitstaff could not adjust the blinds in any fashion to prevent the searing white light from blinding us as we ate. Apparently  part of the blinds above the window cannot be adjusted.Anyway  the burger and the ""Long Island"" cost me $30. I guess the only good thing was that the Dallas Mavericks won the NBA championship while I was there!NOTE: The floors are extremely slippery  so make sure you are wearing a decent pair of non-slip tennis shoes or boots that are made with recycled radial tires. Don\'t say I didn\'t warn you."
Michael L.,Benicia  CA,91,189,17,1/26/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Been here many times. Despite bringing me the wrong dish tonight  the server  Sandy  was superb. Won't order the flat bread pizza again  sausage was way processed  and not a bit over warm. Then pulled pork was outstanding as always  I am a regular here  highly recommended
Linda M.,Pleasant Hill  CA,396,604,61,11/27/2009,3.0,"This type of restaurant isn\'t my thing  but loving 2 guys that *live* sports  we thought we\'d check it out. I kept thinking Outback (with more focus on pizza and sandwiches over red meat). My guys were happy with all the sports on big screens  as was my son\'s picky eater friend with his meal  and I enjoyed the red beer. The service  though slow at times  was better than McCovey\'s  which has a similar sports bar vibe. We were prepared for a long wait  but were pleasantly surprised when the quoted 45 minutes was really more like 20. Plus they brought pizza slices around to give to patrons waiting for tables. Once we were seated  drinks and salad came quickly. Main entrees took quite a while. We\'d been warned about big portions  so hubby and I split the roast beef dip which came with a huge mountain of fries (choose thin and crispy or wedge). The sandwich itself wasn\'t anything to write home about and was much more bread than meat. Luckily  we\'d added the wedge salad (also to split)  which was  again nothing special. The kids meals came with drinks (although we had to ask for a lemonade to be removed from the bill and point out to the server that it was one of the drinks listed on the kids menu). Also they serve those nasty reconstituted happy face potatoes  which the kids didn\'t love. They should just use the fries they serve adults. You can add a good-sized kid\'s sundae for 95 cents. The kids were excited about their specialty ice cream on cookie dessert  the pizookie...so we ordered a ""trio"" which offered 3 mini versions of it with your choice of flavors. Of course they ran out of cookies and cream (aka oreo)  so both kids had to go with their 2nd choice flavor. Dessert took so long to come that we later joked they must have been baking them individually with a light bulb  easy bake oven style. The cookie part you had to dig out of a little metal pan. I\'d have preferred just a regular old brownie with ice cream to the triple chocolate version I tried. Food gets two stars  +1 for good beer  friendly (but slow) service and entertaining for my guys. Next time I\'ll probably try a burger."
Meena P.,Concord  CA,2,61,,5/22/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,So this place has steadily gone down hill! Hubby and i went for dinner on a Friday night a week ago. I use to love BJ's restaurant. So it being a Friday night  it was plenty busy but we didn't have to wait long for a table.It took forever for our waitress to come to us. She said she was swamped as they had just sat 3 tables in her area and she already had a full house. Ok  no problem.We ordered a cesear's salad  large veggie pizza and drinks. So this time since we had so much time while waiting for service  I started reading the menu. I read that the veggie pizza comes on their whole wheat crust - Aha! The previous time we came here I asked my server if our pizza was on whole wheat crust (again it was a veggie) and he assured us that it was not. I had my doubt as it tasted sweet and not like the usual crust. So  now after reading the menu I realized that our last waiter did lie to us about the crust. So this time I made sure to request the white crust. I find the whole wheat crust quite gross  it's so sweet and pizza crust in my opinion should not be sweet!Anyway  we got our salad and it was half the size it normally is so I asked the waitress if they had changed their portions and she said no that this was a side salad. Hubby and I were sharing the salad but the portion turned out to be fine.We got our pizza and it was ugly. It literally looked like the chef (and I use that term loosely) had just thrown our toppings on the pizza  not only that it looked like in the cutting they first cut it wrong and then tried to correct it. It was the ugliest pizza. there were areas without sauce or toppings just cheese. I should have complained to the waitress but we barely got any service.I will definitely not be returning to this BJ's restaurant. I have been to other locations and was satisfied with them. I had written a note to the customer service contact form on their website and have yet to have anyone contact me. It was such a disappointing experience!
Melissa R.,Patterson  CA,0,2,,6/16/2012,5.0,I've been to BJ's before for prom with a bunch of my classmates and we had the set menu with the pasta and pizza  but this time I went I had a different experience. I got to order off the menu for the first time. My aunt actually ordered the California flat bread as an appetizer  it was to die for! It is a must get! When it was time to order I ordered the lunch pasta and salad. I chose the Alfredo fettuccine with chicken. First came the salad and I wish it had more dressing but thats just me I like a lot. Then came my meal it was the perfect size amount for me. It is smaller than the actual dinner size. It also came with two garlic cheesy bread sticks and it was amazing!
Ruth R.,Vallejo  CA,32,149,13,12/10/2009,4.0,I called a day in advance with a reservation for 8-10 people at 6:00pm. Coming from an event in Oakland just after 5pm  we got stuck in traffic  so I did as they asked and called to notify them of my tardiness. We arrived at exactly 6:30PM  and we were told we had to wait. We waited for nearly 45 minutes. Our first dish came out at 8:08pm  which by that time  my friend had to leave to go to work. Everything was good  worth it the price  but that wait after reserving and calling was inexcusable. When we asked why we had to wait  they explained to us the whole process of what making a reservation meant  which is a little different from other places. I would not have been so disappointed if they had explained that over the phone when I called. If I had known  I probably would have made reservations elsewhere. Nonetheless  foods still great  service was great  the wait/reservation process needs some work.
Virgo M.,Bay Area  CA,221,766,81,11/10/2009,2.0,"Meh. I\'ve experienced better is right. All HYPE at this point in the juncture. Call ahead seating is a joke. 45 minutes was the quote...we arrived right on time and were told by one of the hostess cupcakes that the wait was now 1.5 hours. Are you fuggin kiddin me? So we sit and wait  and wait. Then finally the head hostess  told us their vibrators were broke. So..we had been waiting for nothing...really. Once seated  our waiter was Joe. ""Joe was my husband\'s name"" my 93-year old Grandma said. ""Joe is a common name"" said Joe. DICK! His serving neglect and off base sarcasm continued through the experience...total azz and example of when someone thinks their looks can carry them. ""He kinda looks like that handsome man from my soap opera that now left and has his own primetime show doesn\'t he?"" said my Grandma. It took me a minute to figure out who she meant. I decided he did sort of resemble Shemar Moore...but in a broke down thinkin\' he\'s hot  working at BJ\'s while probably giving some on the side sort of way. DICK. The food was okay...if you like egg rolls with hot avocado inside. WTF. I\'ll be back cuz I wanna try the pizza and hot cookie dessert. Hopefully we have a better experience cuz this one was more like bad hand job."
Jessica H.,Concord  CA,149,235,337,1/5/2010,4.0,I've been here twice to the new location and had two completely different experiences. The first was on opening day- went and had dinner. With the exception of my burnt pizookie  it was delish. The second time was during lunch. Decided to try the fettuchini alfredo- which ended up having a hair in it. I told my server (who later came back and asked if l had save the hair- huh???)  and the manager brought me a new plate at no charge. There ended up being not one  but TWO  fettuchini's on the bill. It also took about 90 minutes because she rang up the wrong tabs to the wrong debit cards. I would definitely go back  but not on lunch!
Sheila B.,Antioch  CA,169,19,,6/18/2010,5.0,been here twice and both times had a great experience.First time  i called for a reservation for 5 people and we were seated within 10 min. (packed Saturday night); Second time  no reservation for 2 people and seated within 20 min. (busy Thurs. night)The last time I was there  I ordered the CHARDONNAY SHRIMP PASTA and oh my goodness  it was ecstasy...paired with a MANGO MOJITO and it took all my strength to stop myself from drooling and making inappropriate noises. love the ambiance  and although we were pretty much surrounded by huge TVs  it didn't intrude our evening. i'm a big fan of low lighting and the effect it gives  so when I first walked in  I was sold. definitely will return here again. If you can  MAKE A RESERVATION  it does get packed.
Danielle T.,Pleasant Hill  CA,173,143,332,7/7/2010,4.0,Ok I heart BJ's so much...but it pains me to include a horrible experience there. I have been to BJ's like 4 times for dinner/late night drinks. One of those times included my birthday. All of the first 3 times I have been there  I had yummy food and drinks. It is sad to say that I did experience a buttheadish bartender. It was my birthday and the people who I were with were getting this unacceptable attitude from him. Hella rude. Thank goodness for Sebastian the other and much nicer bartender who was well much nicer. :) The last time I was at BJ's was for a late dinner  last Friday (7/2) the place was just starting to wind down. It took quite a while to actually get to see our server. He was very nice  but looked a little stressed. Once we finally saw him (20minutes after being seated) we order drinks and food. We were told this chicken dish was sold out  so my friend opted for the the country fried steak dinner. I ordered a shrimp pasta  but the angel hair noodles were out so I had to sub my noodles. Which was ok  we were hungry. Anyways  the wait for our food = about 45minutes. And my pasta came out luke warm. Not kool!!! We were informed by the manager like 40 minutes into the wait that there was a reason for the wait. The CFS was just freshly breaded and fried. I asked to have my pasta warmed up. Only good thing was free desert. Still I really love the food  when its hot. The opened sandwiches are A+. Always wanted to try the pizza. But really the Country Fried Steak is pretty awesome with the thick gravy and some hot sauce. Always wanted to try the pizza  maybe next time. Yes there will be a next time for me even if service it needs a little work.
Islandgirl G.,Martinez  CA,0,2,,5/12/2012,4.0,Our first time here and I must say I was impressed. Considering I wasn't expecting much as for the service and food  as to reading some of reviews on yelp. As we arrived greeted by the hostess and seated us right away. Our waiter was awesome making sure we have everything. The food was good - start off with appetizers  meal and dessert. My family was satisfied  definitely coming back again.
Dean M.,Martinez  CA,3,32,,2/1/2013,2.0,I have tried this place three times now.First time  Slow service on a Sunday. Out of food items and house beers  bathrooms look like a Greyhound station. Called district office  took a month to get a hold of me (I had to call back). Then the General manager calls me and comps me a dinner for a retry. The food and service were excellent. As any manager should do  he made sure we enjoyed our experience as a thank you for giving him the opportunity to make things better. Went in a third time  this time for the pizza and other foods. Pizza was almost raw dough in the middle  the service great again  the bathrooms look like a Greyhound station again (all three visits honestly) and the bar slow all three times as well. Very mixed feelings on if I will go again. They have great food potential with unfortunately very poor execution if the General manager is not looking over them like a hawk from my experiences.
jeffrey k.,Emeryville  CA,0,44,,1/14/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Went back a couple times and things were amiss each time. Same complaints as some of the other reviewers: lackadaisical service; skimpy toppings; unmelted cheese. Let me just stop there. Unmelted cheese on a pizza pie. Someone should lose their pizza license. Good beer is good beer  and the place is still a nice setting for beer imbibery. The food gets demoted to bar food.
Sherly M.,Walnut Creek  CA,98,60,81,12/11/2013,1.0,I really wish I would have taken a picture of my sandwich today because most of you won't believe me!! I was there from 12-1 pm today for lunch  sat in the bar area and had lunch with a friend. Well I ordered a half sandwich and soup lunch special. Tomato bisque soup was delicious. No complaints. My club sandwich came out next. I took a bite and I stopped because I couldn't bite thru the whole way. I pulled the sandwich away from my mouth to realize the wax paper that separates the cheese slices was STILL on the cheese!! Really!!!?? From the cook and then to the runner and for two people to not realize there's non-edible items in my food is just beyond me!! The waitress called her manager over. All I got were simple apologies from the both of them. And when the check came to the table they still wanted to charge me for the meal. Um  NO! My friend got up and spoke to the manager again for them to comp the meal. That's just unacceptable! Worst experience.
Paula K.,Downtown Berkeley  Berkeley  CA,7,21,4,3/15/2012,1.0,March 8 went for lunch. Six in our party including children. Server was attentive but overworked. Four members of our party received their entree and were finished before the other two were served. Mentioned to our server and wrote to company  no response. Will have to air their dirty laundry on Yelp:-(.
Alexander A.,Honolulu  HI,1,17,,10/30/2009,4.0,Since the recruiting office I work at is across the street  I was super excited about BJ's. Went their on an opening night  had pizza and beer. I am a huge fan of Blue Moon and because they have it on top this review just went from 3 stars to 4. Of course  their was a miss-communication between servers on the Happy Hour menu ( a little later on that). They have a gigantic TV above the bar which was pretty cool. The food was better than your average chain restaurant. I had deep dish pizza which was great. Now on Happy Hour. Its 3-7 p.m. Monday-Friday. You get $1 off of beers or tap and mini deep dish pizza (which normally goes for $10) you get for $5. And during NFL games and MNF  happy hour applies through the duration of the game.
J M.,Brentwood  CA,0,4,,6/13/2011,4.0,I absolutely love this place! The pizza is delish (BJ's The Works) and the fried potato skins which is the worst thing you could ever put in your body is scrumptious! I also like the chicken wings but I think they need to make that a little crispy.I enjoy the atmosphere  casual and the service isn't bad. I can't wait for the one in Brentwood to open in October! Pizza night will never be there same at my house when they open up the location here! Yeah!P.S. If you guys are ever in SoCal - the BJ's in Cerritos hands down has the BEST pizza.
Sarah W.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,24,,3/4/2011,4.0,Decent service  usually. I've had good and bad waiters & waitresses here. Its nearly always busy and loud. The food is usually delicious. I recommend the grilled chicken pasta or the great white pizza. The pizookie is a delicious way to end a good dinner as well  if you're not already stuffed!
Marie W.,Martinez  CA,36,174,,1/20/2012,3.0,Food was FOUR stars but our waitress was not very motivated at all. Soon. As we sat down  without even having our menus handed to us she wanted our drink order and our appetizer order. Asked for a moment to look at the menu. When she arrived we ordered soup as appetizers and she asked if we want it out at the same time as our dinner. We politely asked for it first. Our soup was served from another waiter and was so good. The soup was served with a waiter who likes his job.Not even two minutes later our dinner was out of the kitchen. Why ask if y our not going to listen. Asked for no tomatoes and still had tomatoes. I know people have off days and we are human  I did only take off one star. Also  we only saw her to place our order and drop off the check. No polite  is there anything i can get you  till she dropped off the check. And they were not that busy  Thursday night at six.I will still go back  as this has been my 6 the visit to this location. This has been the only time we had an waitress that lacked motivation.
Jac T.,Oakland  CA,413,289,24,6/19/2010,3.0,It is what it is. There's nothing horrible about it...it's a chain and it's consistent. It's not fab  and it's not special. I always love a good pizookie  so i'd go back for that....oh  and the bacon crumble on that baked potato ain't bad either!!it's great for groups  and fun for what it is....
TIM M.,Pleasant Hill  CA,12,96,41,11/30/2009,3.0,"Food is good quality and service is OK. I had the mini Pepperoni and a small wedge salad. Yummers on all counts.Having all of the calorie information available for your perusal before you order is kinda like a bad version of ""Scared Straight"". Visually the atmosphere is warn and inviting  but it us pretty noisy."
Jo Anne S.,Daly City  CA,31,7,,5/17/2011,5.0,Thank you BJ's of Concord. I had my granddaughter's 1st Communion reception for 35 people here on Sunday May 15th. The staff was friendly  accommodating  courteous and fulfilled every request. The menu was awesome....great combination pizza. This was the best package deal I have ever purchased. Food was in abundance... appetizers were yummy! Thank you so much for making this a very successful event. I will be back! Jo Anne S.
rosanna c.,Berkeley  CA,64,229,,12/24/2009,4.0,Hooray  there's a BJ's in the East Bay. Well  I guess there's one in Newark  but Concord is closer. I go to BJ's whenever the BF wants to go to a sports bar atmosphere and I want pizookie.This place has been open a few months (street level near JCPenney's)  but I couldn't tell since the service and food were up to par with all the other BJ's I've been to. Service actually may be a bit better here because there are so many servers  probably in training  standing near the bar. Like all BJ's  the wait can be long  and you have to stay in range of the beeper (sorry  no mall shopping). It's easy to get a table for 4 or less  but definitely make reservations if your group is larger.There's a dine-in promo until 1/8/10. Meal for 2: 2 salads or soups  1 med pizza  1 pizookie for $19.99. I'm not a fan of their beers  but do try their hand-crafted sodas. The cream soda is heavenly and a perfect pairing with any pizza. And they say deep dish  but they're not really. The deepness is in the dough  everything else is like regular pan pizza.
Josh B.,Pleasant Hill  CA,39,655,,8/17/2012,2.0,mushroom pizza was good  salad was WAYYYYY overdressed. I mean we're talking lettuce in a virtual ocean of honey mustard. Also a total  complete and absolute CF of epic proportions occurred when the doors opened - the restaurant was seemingly unable to seat anybody for 15 min  then put EVERYBODY in one section and totally hosed the servers. We wound up with free pizza to make up for the disaster.
Michelle N.,Hercules  CA,122,219,41,12/12/2009,2.0,The family and I stopped in at lunch on a pre-Christmas Friday to have something to eat before taking the little one to see Santa Claus. We arrived right around noonish and was expecting more of a wait but luckily we got seated right away in one of the last tables available. (We were very lucky -- just a few minutes later  all the tables were full and a long wait for tables started!!)This was the first time I've ever been to a BJ's so I didn't know what to order. Sis got the house made orange cream soda; I got a cream soda plus a lemonade for the little one. We also ordered some calamari to share. Eventually  my parents joined us and we ordered our entrees. Their lunch specials covered most bases and we all found something we wanted; sis got a hamburger  Dad got a french dip  Mom got jambalaya and I got some hamburger sliders. We also got a chicken tender entree for the little one.Our calamari came out maybe fifteen minutes after we ordered it  which wasn't so bad. The calamari itself was delicious! Very tender  well breaded and good sauces. Nice job  BJ's!And then came the entree wait. Even accounting for the lunch rush  we waited over a half hour for our lunch entrees AFTER our appetizer came out. If you've ever been to a restaurant with a fussy toddler  you know that this is torture!! Our waitress didn't seem that attentive though we got our refills without asking for them.When we finally got our food  it was still another ten minutes before my dad's food came. The burgers were pretty dry so we asked for extra mayo; it never came. The food itself was okay. I liked my sliders but would have liked them more if I had steak sauce or mayo to help lubricate the darn things. My mom liked her jambalaya and my dad liked his french dip but would have liked more au jus to go with it. Like me  sis' burger was pretty dry so she ended up just eating my mom's food.All in all  a pretty mediocre experience. I don't know if I'll be back  especially with a toddler in tow. While BJ's has a kids menu with a neat pack of crayons  I wouldn't call them kid friendly. The place is loud and the lights are low  two things which sort of set my easily overstimulated toddler into high alert. Their high chairs also seem sort of small. My little one is pretty small  at the tail end of the growth scale  but I found it extremely difficult to put her in the high chair and she seemed very uncomfortable in it.
Jen R.,Martinez  CA,15,42,31,7/4/2010,5.0,I love coming here! My friends and I come here all the time  and everything I have ordered I have really enjoyed! Wedge Salad...FABULOUS!

We also have always had good service....We will be back!!!!
Erin G.,New York  NY,20,52,37,10/24/2009,4.0,"Overall  despite being hectically busy and a bit rowdy with larger parties  I had a more-than-satisfactory experience with BJ\'s. My bf and I got there just before 6pm on a Saturday night  an intimidating mass of people already outside. As one person put it  ""there\'s no recession here."" For our party of 2  we were quoted 45-60 minutes; seated in about 30. Our server welcomed us warmly and took our drink order right away. The root beer made on site is tasty. I ordered a hot tea that came with a little kettle for extra hot water. A moat of hot water started to grow around the kettle and we figured out that the kettle was actually leaking. That\'s okay  though. It led to a pleasant conversation about rates of change  high school calculus  and physics (""Physics B is basically a place to learn gang signs. Right-Hand Ruuule!""); and the server we alerted brought out a replacement kettle in no time.The atmosphere was typical for a busy restaurant: people running all over. However  I never felt cramped. Yes  there are TVs  but they\'re high enough on the walls you can avoid looking at them. We were right next to a group of 10 celebrating a 20-something\'s birthday. Typical ""classy"" affair. Like the kettle-situation  it was also bittersweet. (""WHERE\'S OUR SERVER?"" followed by ""Shut UP  birthday girl."" cackle cackle).Our food came quickly. We ordered the Cajun Pasta and the Jambalaya  which came in quantities enough to take half home. Both dishes were tasty  though I preferred the pasta since it had subtler flavors. We also got the Pizookie (my first time here; I need to be initiated to BJ\'s). It came a little slower  but it was a nice substitute to the long-gone giant cookie sandwich at Elephant Bar. When we were finished  our server took care of our check in a timely fashion  bid us a great night  and we were out of there before anyone could sing a drunken Happy Birthday. I\'ll be back  but maybe until after the hype cools down."
Laura D.,Brentwood  CA,16,55,7,7/2/2010,4.0,I was a little surprised to see all of the bad reviews since I've been here four times and have had nothing but good experiences. I will add that I haven't been here during busy times. It sounds like this place has issues if you come during prime dining hours. I will return to BJ's because... They can make a dirty martini. They serve real horseradish with their french dip (why didn't I think of this?!)  but it could be considered a little dry if you prefer fatty vs. lean. Their chopped Italian and Cobb salads are flavorful. The low lighting and busyness give the restaurant a nice ambiance.
Danielle M.,Woodland Hills  CA,112,54,25,10/31/2011,5.0,Always love love alllllll the food here! Service has always been great  drinks are great. The tomato bisque soup is Soooooooo good and I love the Mac and cheese!!
Chris C.,Walnut Creek  CA,17,15,1,9/12/2010,3.0,Would give this place 5 stars for their beers (wonderful selection) but only two stars for their food.The beers  both their own and the guest taps  are wonderful. They have a wide variety and anyplace that has Monk Cafe Sour Ale on tap is great!!The food  for my tastes  is way too heavy. The quality is fair for this type of establishment  but just not suited for me. Everything is either breaded  deep fried or slathered in oils.....just not my preference. Others I have gone with really like the avocado rolls and wings.The burgers are ok  which is what I will usually order.........but hey...let's be honest: you're going here for the beer!!!
Annette M.,Concord  CA,3,19,,8/10/2014,1.0,Absolutely horrible service! We waited over 15 minutes to be asked what drinks we wanted because our waiter was chatting with another table of patrons. We were seated outside without being asked if it was ok. We ordered the Fried Calamari which took forever to arrive  our waiter even was shocked it had not arrived yet. When it did finally arrive it was soggy instead of crispy. I will definitely will not be giving this restaurant anymore of my business.
Aimee T.,Martinez  CA,0,3,,4/12/2013,1.0,This place is consistently a let down. When we dine in they are typically out of at least one thing we order and the service is slow. However dining in is the better end of the deal. I cannot even begin to explain how bad the curbside service is  but I will just give an account of our most recent visit. We ordered online and went to pick up. After calling to let them know we were outside  they did not come out for twenty minutes. When we called back  the gal working the curbside was not even aware we had called the first time  and our food was not ready. After she brought us out a complimentary beverage for our troubles  we were on the way home  about 45 min later than our pick up time. When we got home  there were pieces of the order missing. We will not be ordering from them again  they have consistently bad customer service. We were very unhappy.
Connie Z.,Oakland  CA,225,7,,1/19/2012,1.0,The first time i came here it was pretty busy but id assume they have enough chefs to take care of everyone in a certain amount of time. I didnt get my food until an hour later and half of it was cold and half of it was warm. I could barely even find the server when i needed something.The second time i was there  we were placed all the way in the back of the restaurant. It was the last table in the row. and honestly  it wasnt even a table. it was like an emergency table for when it get too busy and theres no where else to sit. but it was so slow! everyone else got to sit in booths & there was still plently of booths open but nooo. they had to place us at the ugliest table in the restaurant. and there was a column blocking one of the chairs so you cant actually sit comfortably. and yet again the food took a long while to come out. oh & i didnt even get a greeting when i entered the restaurant. they had us sit and wait to get a table when there was plently open. the person who guided us to the table was rude too  like come on now  at least a smile? i think the people who work here are racist! there was 2 white ladies that came in and they got a booth that could fit 5 people when there were small booths still open. and they werent even big people!
donna y.,San Ramon  CA,178,51,1,4/20/2010,4.0,I like this place. In the past 2 months my friends and I have came here 3 times. That's sort of a lot for a restaurant. So the food and drinks are good. Everything that I've gotten hit the spot. I'm surprised that people say the customer service was bad. One time we came it was for a birthday had about 15 people or more  our server I think his name was J was super nice and dealt with us drunk people.The other day we went for lunch and our server was so cute. She had a great personality and it made me think that the servers were always kind. Anyways come here  the food is good  portions are good. Nothing bad I can say about this place. :)
Azam H.,Concord  CA,64,43,1,1/19/2010,2.0,"I received a pre-opening invitation for BJ\'s back in October 2009. It was good for 4 people  so my wife and I invited another couple to join us there to try it out. The location used to be Houlihan\'s in the Sun Valley Mall. It\'s been completely gutted  redesigned  and rebuilt. It\'s very modern and upscale now with a great (and very long) bar with huge flat screen TVs above it. The menu is quite large (not as big as Cheesecake Factory  but big) and the food choices seem similar. The food was complimentary in exchange for a donation to the charity of the night  and we had to pay for any alcohol ordered. (More on that later) We were told to order four different meals to ""test the kitchen staff"" and were offered the choice of appetizer or dessert. The flat bread pizza appetizer was good as were the four meals. One annoying aspect of the evening was they kept trading out our waiters every 20min or so. By the end of the meal  we felt we had about 6 different waiters throughout the night. They said it was for training  but it left us feeling a bit discarded. Despite all these waiters visiting our table  a typical gripe still emerged: no one would remove our finished meal plates and you are forced to stare at them or move them aside yourself - a common theme at many restaurants these days. Now we\'re down to the last parts of the meal  (the plates are finally gone) the check has been dropped  and we\'ve already paid the bill. The other husband and I are finishing our beers  when a completely different waitress comes up and asks  ""Would you like me to top those off for you?"" I ask  ""You mean our beers?"" And she she says  ""Yes  top them off."" I said OK and she took our not-quite finished beers with her. She comes back with two full beers - and right behind her is our most-recent waiter with ANOTHER BILL FOR TWO MORE BEERS. I was totally put off by her topping off ""offer"" rather than making it clear she was selling us 2 additional beers. We weren\'t even finished with the ones we had - which we would have before ordering another round. They might not be good at picking up plates  but they sure know how to get another bill worked up and dropped off! Hell  he almost beat the beers to the table. I was all set to take this up with the manager  as I felt we were duped into purchasing more beer; but my friend ended up paying the second bill when I went to the restroom  thus avoiding any more involvement with their staff. I realize one visit and one slightly off putting experience do not a restaurant make  but I haven\'t found myself going back there yet to give them another shot."
nadia a.,Orinda  CA,1,10,2,12/27/2009,1.0,Ugh! Worst dining experience of my life. I normally never skimp on tip  but this place was just that bad. Let me list the reasons why:1) We waited 1.75 hours for a table  probably because it just opened2) Waitress spilled a drink on two of my friends  and still charged them for it3) Found a hair in my food and I think it may not have been mine since it was there before I started eating.4) Our plates were dirty when they gave them to us  we asked for new ones5) The to-go box she gave me for the pazookie I ordered was covered in dust...so unsanitary6) Slow service  the waitress was nice and she meant well but come on people...7) This isn't really anything to do with the service  but all BJ's lacquer their floors to a dangerous slickness. I didnt slip but I imagine that place is one old lady and a broken hip away from a law suit.In conclusion...don't go here!!!!
Christy P.,Walnut Creek  CA,42,165,123,6/18/2012,4.0,The first time I ever heard of BJs was in SoCal and I fell in love. I like their food and the happy hour. But get to the bar early cause it fills up fast. I usually get a wedge salad or a small meal. The pizza there is also good if you like deep dish. I am a soda kind of gal and this Concord location has the homemade root beer and it was really good. I also like the pear cider and berry cider.
Stuart M.,Pleasant Hill  CA,22,154,,1/1/2014,1.0,"Beer selection looks promising until you realize most of the tap handles pour their own mediocre brews. Service is indolent at best  insolent at worst. Asked a bartender for mayo for my burger. Fifteen minutes later I asked a barback to get it and the bartender went all passive-aggro furious. She came back every 2 minutes to ask ""is everything better now?"" in a syrupy-sarcastic voice  as if we were retarded children who had skinned our knees. And speaking of the food  do NOT order a burger here. Seriously  this was among the sorriest burgers I have ever been served  including in military chow halls. I have had better burgers in remote areas of Europe where they don\'t know what a burger is  and just give you a fried clod of mystery meat. I asked for it medium rare and got it charred well. Served cold  cheese not even starting to melt at the edges. Four-day-old stale bun  bone dry. Sad little remnants of pickle and tomato inside  cut from the stem-ends. Cold greasy bacon that smelled like a KFC dumpster. And all of this assembled in the strafing fashion  scattered across the plate like it had tried to run and been machine-gunned down. Even though I only ate part of it  I had a mild case of food poisoning that kept me on the dumper for most of the next day. But hey  I hear the deep-dish cookie is really good."
Dave S.,Concord  CA,0,13,,6/4/2014,4.0,My wife and I eat out often and are used to nice restaurants. While this restaurant doesn't have a chef on staff the menu was pretty large and the decor is modern and upscale. We were seated in a middle table which I was not thrilled with  but when we are just two this is to be expected. The server Ally was good and when we ordered our food we were offered to have our soup and salad delivered before the entree. Ten minutes later a different server delivered our entrees'. Eek! Eventually we did get our salad and soup but the meal was disjointed and the plates were so big that it was awkward trying to eat from both plates. The highlights of this dinner were the in-house brewed beer. Very hoppy just the way I like them. And the manager whose name was David came to our table and apologized for the mix up with our dinner. I know they were just trying to get the food out quickly  but I did appreciate that they apologized and did what they could to make me feel better about it. I gave this review a 4 star because the food was good and the atmosphere is pleasant and because they did what they could to fix a mistake.
Ivan W.,Pleasant Hill  CA,92,54,18,1/1/2010,3.0,Darn you BJ's for screwing up the parking at Sun Valley Mall! Minus one star!The wait sucked too  but it was nice that they came around with pizza samples. Still  we missed happy hour because of it.I thought the food was pretty good  but they messed up our order a little bit. The replacement came quickly  though  and after a quick check to make sure they didn't hawk a loogie in it or anything I dug in.I got a bbq beef sandwich and it was good  but greasy. I think the best thing they have going for them  though  is their pizookies. Two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream on a freshly baked cookie. soooo good. If i go back  i think i might skip the food and just eat a pizookie by myself.
Gabrielle M.,San Ramon  CA,0,4,,7/17/2013,2.0,So I came to BJ's last night and Katie was my server and to the say the least she was delightful.The beer she recommended was outstanding it was a mix of the berry beer and red ale and it was delicious Tonight was unfortunately a much different experience we sat at the bar it took about 5+ minutes to get greeted  and when we did we immediately ordered our drinks and appetizers  but our server Lara forgot to put in our order so we had to wait about 15 minutes for my beer to come up and a bit longer for my appetizer  which on my last experience dining there took about 5 minutes to come up Our server failed to check up on how our entrees were  so we got the manager's attention about our issue  which he was more than accommodating about.At the end due to our server's attitude we decided to tip the bartender who had to make up for our server's short comings  and I asked him to give the runner veronica who was extremely helpful a tip  and I mentioned that I knew she could not accept a tip because she was training  which then our server Lara proceeded to rush over with an aggressive disrespectful manner stating' she can take tips ill give it to her' and took the tip from my hand and stormed off to the back I plan to come back to BJ's  but due to the bad taste that our server Lara left us with I think I'll just go to the Dublin location for a better dining experience.
John M.,Vancouver  WA,15,30,,8/28/2010,3.0,For all the gluten-free people out there!This pizza is horrible at best! Actually  I think they just didn't cook the crust all the way through. For all the gluten-free'ers  you know that raw gluten-free dough does not taste good at ALL. The outside edges of the crust were pretty good  but the rest of it was doughy  chewy  tasteless and it was an overall disappointing experience. This place is all about volume  but they charge an arm and a leg  IMHO. Lunch prices are good  though!
Tyler I.,Pleasant Hill  CA,6,17,,1/3/2010,3.0,This place is okay their happy hour food specials are a pretty good deal.They told us it would take 25 minutes but it ended up taking about 8 minutes. I got the mini size Sweet Pig which is a Hawaiian style pizza. Dough puffy crust with pretty fresh ingredients although they could be fresher and it wasn't very hot either. Wait staff is decent but you barely see the same waiter twice. Home brewed root beer was excellent though  and I am a pretty big fan of Root Beer.lots of tv's with sports on around but takes the social life away because you usually have to look up and away from anyone else to see them  not the best place for families in my opinion.
Angela G.,Hercules  CA,36,68,81,3/1/2012,2.0,I never usually had problems at BJ's before but when I went recently with my family for my cousins 19th birthday there were a few problems. First of all  I went in about 15 minutes before my family got there so I got a reservation and I let the hostess know that there was going to be 7 of us. She gave me a buzzer thing and told me to let them know when they get here. When my cousins got there  they told us they had a table ready for us but it was only able to seat 6 people. Clearly  I told the hostess there was going to be SEVEN of us. So we had to wait an additional 10 minutes which wasn't so bad. Another host gave me another buzzer and told us it would go off when a bigger table was available. When the buzzer finally went off I gave it to the original hostess who was assisting me and my family and she looked confused and didn't know what was going on. So i explained to her that another host gave me a NEW buzzer. She then made us wait an additional 15 minutes. When we finally get seated  they put us OUTSIDE secluded from everyone. The heaters were not strong enough  and it was cold. Our first waitress was nice although she seemed like she hated her job. After her shift was over  she then introduced us to another server who would be assisting us for the rest of the evening. He was a lot nicer and lively but disappointed me when he said they didn't have any more beignets :(Don't get me wrong  it's a good restaurant but I do NOT like their customer service. We should've got a complimentary pizookie for the long wait/hostess mistake.
RENEE R.,Concord  CA,29,37,1,3/9/2014,2.0,Poor poor service!! Food just ok. Kitchen ran out of items but did not inform us until food was delivered. Never got refills. Good delivered without utensils on table.
John S.,Pittsburg  CA,28,35,,10/21/2012,4.0,Service was great. Prices are pretty good. Spend as much or as little as you want. Food was off the chart. Recommend to anyone who wants a fun place to grab a informal bite to eat  a drink  or watch the game. The atmosphere is great.
Nayla M.,Martinez  CA,82,35,54,6/3/2012,5.0,Our kids LOVE BJ's and so do we. It's always a good option when we want to go out and each time we get hot  yummy food. We are never disappointed.
Marilyn. E.,Sugar Land  TX,8,153,1,5/23/2012,4.0,We've had lunch here several times now and it has always been good. The Roast Beef dip is always excellent. Love the thin crispy fries. I had the new lunch item that is a Southern Fried Chicken Breast over cheddar mashed potatoes and with southwest corn for only $5.99 and it was excellent! Jessica's service was great the last two times we were there! We sit in a comfy booth in the bar and watch the split screen tv..it has on something for everyone.
Kathleen M.,Hercules  CA,30,13,5,7/19/2010,4.0,Had very delicious pizza  their mini-size is enough for me  but if you're super hungry I suggest buying some pasta fills you up more. But anyways  went there and ate the veggie mini pizza. it was soooo good! the pizza dough had a hint of this kind of butter taste  but it's up there with cheeseboard in berkeley for me as for pizza. Something you should FORREALS get when you come here is the PIZOOKIE!! omg so so good. was the first time i tried it and now i'm hooked. now up there with all my favorite desserts. they serve you a freshly baked ooey-gooey warm chocolate chip cookie (YUMM!) and top it off with vanilla bean ice cream and it just melts all over the cookie. ahhh soo good!
Dennis E.,Concord  CA,16,17,11,11/7/2009,4.0,Yes it is a chainGet over it!Good beer  good foodVery crowded but I like going in places where people are busy. If you can get a seat @ the bar incredible 4/screen HdTV so you can watch multiple sportsI probably wouldn't go with a large group as I don't do flashing vibrators in public & I really like sitting @ the bar where ever I goBottom line  the only true way to rate anything; is would you do it againYes  I'm going back
Jessica C.,Vallejo  CA,7,5,,9/10/2012,5.0,By far this place has the best burritos in town   I will not go anywhere else. There super burritos feeds me twice and my girlfriend twice for only $10.00... I would recommend this place to anyone
Rachel S.,Pleasant Hill  CA,2,90,,1/30/2010,3.0,Most of their beers are good (I prefer their Berry Burst Cider). Their pizza is delicious! Great Happy Hour! 1/2 off mini pizzas in the bar area. Lunch menu is extensive and reasonably priced.
Keith B.,Concord  CA,5,158,,1/29/2010,2.0,Pretty standard fare as far as food and beer goes. The pizza is definitely worth getting and the desserts are pretty good. The spinach and artichoke dip  although pretty good  gave me a massive case of heartburn  and I'm not exactly opposed to greasy food. The beer is alright  nothing mind-blowing  the Jeremiah Red is my personal favorite.Would probably be 3-4 stars if not for the hideous service at this place. The first time I went there  it was busy  but not packed. There were tables available and there was no wait to eat. Had to wait 20+ minutes for my appetizer  and even though I ordered the beer BEFORE the meal  the beer came about 2 minutes before the actual meal came. I complained to the manager and left no tip. I decided to give it another chance  and although the service was better  there were maybe 5 other parties there at that time and I still felt like I had to send up a smoke signal to get my waitresses' attention.Bummer.
simone x.,San Francisco  CA,0,19,,7/3/2014,2.0,"Server sucked her name is Kimberly. Heavy attitude. Never once checked to refill our water. Would ask if everything was ok as she ""passed"" ( and kept going) our table and kept on walking regardless if we answered  grunt or not. Poor customer service and when she did take some time and we acknowledged with thank you she would respond ""my pleasure"" as though it was beneath her and painful. We were apprehensive to ask for anything because we were OH SO inconveniencing her. And we were paying for this BS?!! WTF. We ordered a hamburger w/fries... no condiments. We had to get up and get it ourselves from another table. Needless to say she got a meager tip. It was NOT busy and this was in the bar area. BJ at Sun Valley Mall. I will not be returning. We spent $70 on food and drinks. Poor.."
Daniel M.,San Jose  CA,95,116,90,12/6/2009,3.0,"Came here with a group of eight of my cousins during Black Friday. 45 minute wait for inside  15 minutes for patio. Turned out that the patio table wasn\'t actually available  but they gave us an inside table after about a 25 minute wait.I had spent too much already during the day  so I jumped all over the lunch specials. The BBQ pulled pork sliders sounded really good and were only about $6. Those turned out pretty dry  but the amount of food was definitely worth the price. We also shared a pizookie party platter among us. They got the order wrong and brought out a regular pizookie. After realizing their mistake  they called it a ""sampler"" and gave it to us free of charge. Nice!Overall  a nice experience  but just so-so food.Summary: 3/5 stars+Pizookie  pizookie  pizookie+Our waitress was really nice-So-so food-Crowded"
Amanda M.,Dixon  CA,72,84,10,2/25/2010,4.0,I have yet to go to BJ's and not like my meal. I have ordered everything from a pizza  chicken strips  salad  crusted chicken - and it is all great! The appetizers are great as well. The house-brewed sodas are smooth and delicious as well! They're lunch specials are a bargain! I'm not thrilled with their selection of desserts. I am NOT a fan of the cookie dessert they push. If they could improve the desserts  they'd get five stars from me.
Van W.,Oakland  CA,213,282,1,11/24/2009,3.0,Wow  this place has grown in popularity in a short amount of time. I've gone to another BJs (San Mateo) and this place is pretty similar.It's not too big but they still have a nice selection of their beers. There is more and more of a wait each time we go -- good for them  annoying for us.Service is still I think a bit hiccup-y. Our orders usually get messed up and no one fixes things but nothing major. (2 people ordered thing fries  got wedge instead  when we brought it to the server's attention she said she'd bring us another plate but never returned except to give us our bill)The hostesses and servers are all very friendly and probably have been trained to do so  but I think some of them stop thinking and are on auto-pilot. It's a bit pricier  but the inside is still nice and we come here occasionally anyways. So apparently it's good enough. Oh right  the food is ok  mostly just whelming -- not over  not under. I tend to get the Angus Roast Beef Dip (French dip) and happy with that. I would not recommend their BBQ beef and Chicken plate -- small serving sizes and dry. That is just from one experience though so who knows.
Salonje R.,Sunnyvale  CA,194,278,41,8/3/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Tried the Medittaranian deep dish pizza. It is super yummy...also drinking the Berry Burst cidar beer. Just learned from the bartender that BJs went through the same company that makes their Pear cidar beer. Also tried a sample of some yummy mixture of this beer with a special berry syrup. I forgot the name but it was so delicious. I am beginning to like this place...
dina s.,Pleasant Hill  CA,217,150,34,4/21/2011,2.0,"We went to BJs for dinner with a large-ish group of people. First  they messed up our reservation. As in they didn\'t have it at all. Minus one point. Super! We finally sat down and our waitress came up and told us we weren\'t peppy enough. Maybe if it wasn\'t 9:00pm and we hadn\'t waited foerever  we\'d be peppy. Ok  whatever. Minus another point. She took our drink orders and my fiance got a delish beer. Plus one point. Our waitress came back and told us that someone else was taking over. No prob. New waitress- forgot to take our menus away after she took the order. Forgot to note that I wanted dressing on the side. Minus two points. Boo!I ordered the Great White pizza and my fiance had the BJs favorite. The crusts were good  the pizzas were alright. No points in either direction. The server who brought us the food tols us ""If you want something healthier  go for thin crust"". Thanks for telling us after we ordered. Boo! We lied and said it was someone\'s birthday. The waitress then told the guys- way to ruin the surprise. Minus one! But we did get a delish pizooki for the table because of the wait. Plus one!And then they messed up our bill. Minus one. We still had fun  so I guess plus one.Grand total: 2 points  BJs."
Kevin Z.,Concord  CA,71,99,12,2/7/2012,4.0,Good beer  nice place  generally new staff  and hit or miss on food.
Heather N.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,12/18/2012,4.0,I absolutely loved their food! Everytime I go here I am satisified  whether its the pizza  baked potato  nachos  ect. I love how they stay open late because gives plenty of time to enjoy their delicious bar drinks!They might want to lighten up on the waxy floors  i had to tip toe in my heels so i wouldnt fall :( Everything else is Great!!
Shane R.,Walnut Creek  CA,26,155,2,5/1/2012,2.0,This place is great if you are into over-paying for food just to have a nice enviroment. The food we have had here isn't bad  just not great. Its clean and nice enviroment  but I care more about the food than what the place looks like. Ide rather go to some small hole in the wall family restraunt thats is half the price with better food.
Ronald N.,Hercules  CA,198,399,94,4/2/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,After a few months absent from this place I still get great service. Jesse from the bar was very helpful and Doreen was amazing. Both of them are excellent server.
Maria P.,Pittsburg  CA,448,65,37,2/15/2011,1.0,Horrible service... We have been here 4 times since it's been open the only thing that has been consistant is the horrible service... I do love their root beer ;)... But that's about it...
Ashlee G.,Concord  CA,2,12,,8/11/2011,4.0,I was surprised at how quickly we were seated and served on a Saturday! We were immediately taken to our seats and had our app before they waitress had even brought over plates. We loved the stuffed mushrooms and the flatbread pizza. Overall it was a great experience.
K M.,San Francisco  CA,1,14,,6/16/2012,3.0,The service here is really a hit or a miss but it has dropped dramatically since it first opened. We've found pieces of meat in our vegetarian pizza. Utensils are almost always dirty. Condiments are brought out after asking 3/4 times. I've yet to be impressed with the service. Other than that  the food is great. Avacado eggrolls are scrumptious!
Stephanie G.,Concord  CA,38,22,9,11/11/2009,2.0,"I want to give this place a break because I know they just opened and how chaotic that can be for restaurants but the service was pretty awful and my food was less than mediocre. I want to know how many times you have to ask for sweetener before a server brings it to you...apparently for our server it takes more than 3 because we eventually had to get the busser to get it for us after my friend\'s""s tea had been on the table for at least 15-20 minutes. Same goes for ranch. This server was also incapable of bringing out our food because two other servers did that and a third and fourth servers helped out throughout our whole visit too. Its a shame that the guy assigned to our table is the one who takes home the pretty generous tip we left him. I would maybe look past the crappy service if my Cajun pasta was at least as hot as taco bell mild sauce! It would help if it wasn\'t dried out from being under a hot lamp for at least 20 minutes either! On the plus side my 4 friends did enjoy their food. I plan on going back on a less crazy night and ordering something different. I\'ll update then  but for now it was a disappointment. =/"
TJ M.,Providence  RI,218,21,2,11/10/2011,4.0,Definitely expensive for the food quality  but it makes up for it with friendly service  always getting seated right away  being open until 1am  and pizookies.
Kevin M.,San Francisco  CA,0,5,2,1/19/2010,3.0,BJs always has really good food. However  this Concord restaurant was incredibly disorganized. There would be many cleaned off tables waiting to be filled with the dozens of customers waiting at the cramped front  and yet it took them forever to put anyone at them. At the front desk  waiters and hosts would just be chatting with one another and standing around. I arrived there at 6pm (with my name called ahead). I did not get seated until 30 minutes after I was told I'd be seated. Salads came before appetizers (shouldn't have happened)  appetizers took forever to get to the table  and the order of fish tacos was ice cold. We did not get out of the restaurant until 9:15  and we are not ones to stay and mingle forever after we finish eating. BJs is still one of my favorite restaurants  but this was not one of my favorite locations due to its lack of organization.
emme n.,Concord  CA,3,29,4,12/3/2009,2.0,One notch above Dennys but 5 notches below Cheese Cake factory. Please Concord  bring something new and refreshing.This is NOT deep dish pizza. I first had BJs in SoCal when it was a small chain and the deep dish was Chicago style  but after getting bought out and going mainstream  I can now see its just another gross chain. Its really unfortunate this place will turn into another: Chilis  Chevys  Outback  Red Lobster  Fresh Choice etc etc etcBut it seems like its some what busy so some townies stuck in the suburbs must enjoy greasy and favorless food.
Kenny P.,Hercules  CA,9,53,3,12/30/2009,4.0,This is the third BJ's I've been to in NorCal and I'm glad a decent place to eat has arrived @ Sun Valley. BJ's has a nice SportsBar vibe with a good selection of beers  numerous flat screen TVs and some of the best pizza around. I agree it is not classic Chicago 'deep dish'  but it's so light and tasty it more than makes up for that shortcoming. I usually don't care for chain restaurants  but BJs - like PF Chang & Cheesecake Factory - are always consistantly good with a fun atmosphere.  Got a sweet tooth? Try a Pizookie!
T L.,Pittsburg  CA,5,30,1,12/9/2010,3.0,I'm not a big fan of BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse just because I feel like the some of the hostesses there are a bit rude and neglectful. But the servers are the best! I had Natalie as my server and I just really appreciated how she continued to check in with our table even during a busy night. I was a bit ticked off but the fact that she didn't forget us made the night a little easier to enjoy.
yoyo v.,San Pablo  CA,2,11,,4/26/2012,4.0,To put it in short. Our waitress Tammy is awesome! Service was promt friendly and professional. Me and my friends of nurses were well taken care of.
Lady K.,Oakland  CA,66,9,,2/16/2013,1.0,Place sucks. Slow service bad service. My family has been here two hours and my kids are just now eating. I will never come back.
Sonila S.,Concord  CA,0,7,1,4/25/2014,4.0,Love their pizza! Bufflo chicken pizza is the best at bjs! Customer service is good not bad  sometimes they are a little slow the waiter or waitress but overall not a bad place to sit down and enjoy time with friends/family.
Sara W.,Livermore  CA,30,497,173,2/22/2011,4.0,Great beer  good food and good service. Nothing remarkable or note worthy about the place... But at least it's consistent!
Natalie V.,Hercules  CA,91,14,35,1/24/2012,1.0,It took 15 min for someone to take drink orders.....took twice as long for food to come out! Why a LONG wait  especially when it's not busy! Service Sucks.... Root beer is Delicious! I should've learned after 2nd visit- thought we would give them them the benefit of the doubt- Never Again!
cupcakefiend L.,Walnut Creek  CA,1,16,,1/23/2012,2.0,my boyfriend and I went here for a late dinner after noticing that it was open. Big mistake.. At the beginning service was okay. The server got us our drinks and took or orders pretty quick. Then she served us our food and forgot we were even there. I had no silverware and she did not notice it missing from the table or me trying to get her attention. So I had to snag silverware from the table behind me which also wasn't wiped down properly. After we finished eating we had to wait 10 minutes to receive the check and another 20 after she took the card! Both the food and service the past 3 times I've been here have just been okay. But this time was bad. Would rather go to the cheesecake factory even their food is better & service over the top compared to bjs.
Sara H.,Frederick  MD,298,290,25,10/14/2009,4.0,I went to BJ's in Orange County on a regular basis. They have solid beer and good food with a wide selection. We ate a small 1/2 southwestern and 1/2 bbq chicken pizza. They weren't that different from each other--it was hard to taste much difference. Then we had a Pazookie-yum! I had the Robust Porter and my husband had the seasonal pumpkin ale. It was the best pumpkin ale I've had  but I don't generally like them. The spices were noticeable form the moment it my tongue but then the pumpkin hits. Overall we had a great experience. I'm glad BJ's is here and I'm glad there is a quality restaurant open late at night in concord. Mufasa the brewer was there but we didn't get a chance to meet him.
jamie j.,Walnut Creek  CA,144,246,13,2/6/2011,1.0,This place doesn't even deserve a star  but yelp wont allow any less. I went with a party of 8 people and it took 2 hours to a get a cobb sald (with dressing on the side)....no kidding. Took the waitress 30 minutes to tell me they don't have ginger ale. Cobb salad was disappointing and the meat on it was cubed processed deli meat (consistency of spam). I needed to leave early (since I hadn't anticipated that it would take this long to eat) and the waitress wouldn't let me pay since everyone wasn't leaving....what?!?!
Traci J.,El Cerrito  CA,1,12,12,3/21/2012,2.0,My friends and I did not have a good experience at BJs. FIrst of all  I ordered a fish taco. Now I have had fish tacos before but this was just awful. It was nothing but a big fish stick wrapped in a tortilla. Had I known that  I would have ordered something else. Not only was my friend's pizza undercooked  but it was brought out after we had almost finished our meal. I guess they forgot about her order. Last but not least  there were two strands of hair in the ice cream in the pazookies. Gross. The waitress offered to bring another one out but by that time  we were done.
Gio M.,Solano  CA,81,7,2,11/2/2011,3.0,The Waitress was very nice but she was alright  she forgot to put in my friends order and lied that the kitchen was taking longer on his calzone. I don't think it takes 15 minutes for the kitchen to finish up his calzone. I will be coming back for the food but not the service  i recommend the Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad.
M G.,Concord  CA,0,9,,11/18/2010,2.0,I have eaten here maybe five times. The service is SO slow. Don't eat here if you are in a hurry.The mixed drinks are good.The food is so-so to blah.Standard fare you find at other restaurant chains.I've given this place to many chances.
Alicia G.,Concord  CA,0,5,,12/16/2013,1.0,I went out to lunch with a friend here and the service was terrible! We walked in and no one greeted us and we had to ask for silverware and napkins... The staff is just hanging out and talking to each other and their friends in the front of the restaurant. Completely unprofessional.
Cam S.,Concord  CA,1,12,,6/9/2012,4.0,Food is good but we go mostly to get a drink for happy hour. Their beers are good I recommend Nutty Brewnette and Jeremiah red. What I really like is they have lots of beer on tab and a good selection of imported bottled beers. They stay open late on weekends which is nice because its walking distance for us.
Sun L.,Oakland  CA,126,21,30,9/7/2011,4.0,Went to this place during me and my girlfriend's 18 month anniversary for dinner  the format of the restaurant looked like Fentons and Chessecake factory  as of the welcoming service  two of the waitresses didn't gave a friendly welcoming and just stared rudely as if i were lost. My girlfriend and I were eventually seated shortly about just a minute after we've walked in. Ordered the Cajun pasta and New Orlean Jambalaya Pasta  they were delicious! and i practically felt stuffed by the Cajun pasta while i was trying to finish the last bits of it!! i would definitely order any of the two on my next visit  foods were good  but quite pricier than i thought since it came out to be $30  but can't complain since it was our anniversary  didn't had to wait too long  and food was great!
John W.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,5,,5/23/2012,3.0,I go here for lunch periodically  and usually sit at the bar. Bar service is good  with attentive staff. My experience has been somewhat different in the dining area. Last time I sat in the dining area service was slow  they forgot my salad  and when I did get it  it looked half finished compared to everyone else at the table (no croutons  smaller portion  etc.)Prices on the lunch menu are good  but does seem like portions might be getting smaller (chicken tenders). Can't beat the lunch time beer price for house brews  which is the main reason I go. Used to be $3  now up to $3.50  but still a good deal. Food okay  menu items can be hit and miss depending what you get.
Nancy M.,San Francisco  CA,1,39,,7/17/2012,4.0,I've been to this location at least 5 times. Their Calamari is delicious. Their beers are great although I am not a big beer drinker. I have ordered two of their cocktails and they are not the greatest. If I order a Martini I want a Martini not a glass of water with an olive. I have had their short order of ribs they were good  fell off the bone  but were a little on the greasy side  their Asian chicken salad was delicious  their burgers are good. My suggestions  is give your patrons a drink. Leave the watered down drinks for someone who doesn't know drinks. I'd give you 5 stars if the drinks were real  and the ribs weren't so greasy. The other foods are good
Audrey L.,San Diego  CA,1,25,4,1/21/2013,1.0,Last time I was here service sucked. We sat in this little table that was too small for both my boyfriend and I and were constantly subject to being bumped into by servers. In addition  our server kept forgetting my drink refillsAND my boyfriend had to keep asking for some horse radish for his steak and didn't get it until he was done eating. I wish I had remembered her name  but she was a white girl who was everything BUT attentive and good at her job. Today  I am here because I love BJs food  but service continues to suck at this location. Not only are tables sticky and chairs crummy upon seating new guests  but it takes a whole 15 to 20 minutes before you are approached by your server. Servers give guests evil glares as they are trying to get up from their tables  but happen to be in their way. All they had to say was EXCUSE ME. This place LACKS professionalism. I give only one star because I still love Pizookies.
Jamie G.,Concord  CA,113,18,,12/2/2010,5.0,The breakfast is GREAT... I love THIS PLACE! The parking is bad but the food is so good. The floor is slippery and my friend fell once! But it is worth it! (hahah)
Elizabeth D.M. A.,Pittsburg  CA,0,2,,2/22/2014,1.0,So my children and I arrived we we seated fairly quick  but we left after a 1/2 hr of no waiter. No one came to our table and offered drinks or anything.
Trent R.,Antonito  CO,55,73,35,1/16/2011,2.0,Pizza was OK...service was lacking. They forgot my salad....Beer is overpriced...imho
Rachel A.,Pleasant Hill  CA,24,21,2,11/18/2013,5.0,My fiance and I were trying to think of a place that we could watch sunday night football. I don't particularly enjoy sports bars  so we came up with a happy medium: BJ's. The bar has a humongous TV that shows 4 different sports channels  so we elected to sit there. The bartender  Shane greeted us and let us know that he'll be right with us. I really appreciate when bartender's do this because the majority of the time I'm not sure if they know I'm there or not. They have happy hour whenever there's a sports game on  so we definitely took advantage of that! We ordered about 6 happy hour appetizers and they were all delicious! Shane was very knowledgeable and helpful when it came to deciding on our beverages. We asked for a couple beer tastes and I decided on a Berry Cider and my fiance asked for something lighter that the beer he tasted. Shane recommended that we combine the Berry Cider and Jeremiah Red. OMG!!!!!!! I'm thinking of going back just to have that beer!!!!!!!!!!! My fiance loved the blend  so we got a pitcher :-) Delicious beer  great food that I didn't have to cook  attentive service  and football!!!!! It was the best sunday ever!
Vanessa J.,Antioch  CA,110,28,,3/17/2011,4.0,I LOVE this place! Excellent food and drinks and great service. My favorite is the parmesan crusted chicken and they have really good fried calamari. I find it hard to leave without finishing my meal with a pizookie for dessert!
Jessica B.,Martinez  CA,19,60,17,11/28/2010,2.0,I've been to other Bj's and really enjoyed them.. however this location can't get their service up to par.First encounter with poor service was with the hostess. We were told the wait would be 35-40 minutes. Well thats fine.. except it was an hour. When were finally seated we immediately ordered waters and cocktails. Our waitress (albeit very nice) was our second encounter with poor service. After assuming the she forgot our drink order completely our cocktails arrived but not our waters. We then ordered apps and a pizza and waters. After finishing out cocktails (and we're not fast drinkers) our pizza arrived and so did our waters. Two problems here  one we had no silverware and two what happened to our appetizer? We informed our waitress we would just like to cancel the app because we already had our main course. She said it was ready and would bring it to us  complimentary. Since there was no room on the table for it we just asked it be boxed up. 4 minutes later it was served to us by another member of their wait staff. Whatever.The pizza is good here  but the service makes it not worth it. Step it up BJ's!
Joshua G.,Ventura  CA,1,1,1,1/19/2013,1.0,Okay  so first off  after a strenuous day I was finally reaching the perfect situation to release the troubles of the week into the abyss. I was with my wife and good friend with beer at the table and awaiting the arrival of an amazing burger. After a reasonable amount of time  I was served some irrelevant sandwich- the same kind your weird Italian roommate would make in between football and a bizarre laundry ritual. I was not too disappointed at this point  and after some contemplation decided to send it back to get the real burger that I desired. After watching the people who I love enjoy their meals  my burger arrived. This time the meat was not thoroughly cooked as the pink was so bright it was as if they were mocking me. I felt so badly for sending it back a second time  because usually I just take what I'm given even with mistakes. It was simply not edible- I did not go there to enjoy raw meat. The manager came to the table to apologize  and she seemed sincere but I feel it was faade. I understand that being a manager of a restaurant and brewery is demanding  and I would feel the same. After all it wasn't her fault. But to express my experience at this restaurant  it was not worth what we paid  and to make multiple mistakes on one order is simply not acceptable. When it comes down to it  the Wendys in Fremont is so much more superior. Their Frosty's are impeccable  and the burgers are amazingly delicious without being overpriced. Wendy's in Fremont never disappoints  but if you head this way  you will not be impressed. We all make errors  but after a week of dealing with the problems we all face  Weny's in Fremont is the only place that can suffice.
Angela G.,Dublin  CA,40,14,,1/16/2012,5.0,All I can say is that I'm crazy for the Nutty Brunette draft beer. I did the little sampler and all beer choices were exceptional  but now when I visit this place with my husband that is my favorite drink of choice. the staff is wonderful and precise with our food. I also love that they offer the NFL Ticket there.
Chia C.,Oakland  CA,70,186,18,8/4/2010,1.0,This place was pretty terrible. The service blew my mind. I am in awe of how slow the servic was and how not on top of things the staff was. Hate to say it  but I will be back. I mean  there is nothing else in the mall worth eating.
Cammie K.,Brentwood  CA,0,15,,8/13/2010,4.0,In my opinion  great food and nice atmosphere. Cool selection of mixed drinks and various beers. Never too long of a wait  the most I've had to wait is 10 mins. Friendly staff and plenty of TVs for your entertainment needs.
Patricia R.,San Francisco  CA,0,18,,1/6/2013,2.0,"We\'d been to BJ\'s before and had slow service  but decided to give it another try. Boy  we were disappointed. Went in for an early dinner (5:00) and were seated quickly. Waitress walked by our table on the way to others several times and didn\'t stop or make eye contact. I think most people are ok waiting a bit (at least I am) if you at LEAST acknowledge that you know they are there  so perhaps a little more training on the basic customer service would be advised. Another party was seated nearby and they sat for about 5 minutes and a manager approached their table and asked if anyone had been by. She apologized and took their order. We flagged the manager down and explained we\'d been there a LOT longer and nobody had approached us either. She apologized and took our order as well. Did not write anything down. Server FINALLY stopped by and apologized for the wait too. After waiting about a half hour  the same manager walked by and said our meal was ""coming right up."" 15 minutes later  they brought it out. One of the meals was completely wrong (not what was ordered) and they had to remake it  which took - no kidding - another 30 minutes. A different manager brought out the corrected meal and said they wouldn\'t charge us for that meal. I explained what had happened and from that point on  our waitress was rude. I didn\'t bag on her at all  I just explained what happened during our visit. Before we ever received our meal  the other table that came in AFTER us had FINISHED their meals and already left! We should have left when we were ignored for so long and taken it as a sign of things to come. BJ\'s  we\'ll be checking out different mall options going forward! And as a side note - not a good idea for servers to wear heavy scents - the perfume was overwhelming!"
Ed Y.,Hercules  CA,0,25,3,7/8/2010,1.0,Should be zero rating. Do not bother to dine here. It was the worst dining experience of my life. Waited at least 30 minutes until they figured out who the waiter should be for our table while surrounding tables who were seated after us were already being served food! Then when we finally ordered  the first plate of food came 45 minutes later. The deep dish pizza was awful. The crust was not fully cooked and soggy. The pizza's taste was bland and salty. Don't waste your time  money  patience and stomach here. You are better off going to one of the places inside Sun Valley mall which isn't saying much. You have been warned! Walk away.
upper d.,San Francisco  CA,0,51,1,2/16/2011,2.0,I usually love coming to BJ's for the deep dish pizza  the wings  the beer  the atmosphere and of course the pizookie.But my experience at this particular location was a disappointment.I ordered my usual buffalo chicken pizza. They came out with the barbecue chicken pizza instead! I kindly reminded our waitress that I ordered the buffalo chicken and she took it back whit a smile on her face. I thought  no problem  just a little mix up  mistakes happen...To my surprise  they basically scraped off the cheese and most of the barbecue sauce  spread a little buffalo sauce  sprinkled some cheese and more chicken  put it in the oven and served that to me. It tasted nothing like the buffalo chicken pizza. All I could taste was the barbecue sauce and I just could not enjoy my meal as much as I tried! I was so upset but so damn hungry that I just ate it. I also didn't want to make a big deal since I was with a group of friends and we were all having such a great time. But I usually call the freakin manager over and make a scene and demand that they make things right or my meal is on the house.I still love BJ's restaurant and brewhouse -__-But next time my order better come out perfect.
Jessica J.,Concord  CA,6,11,,2/8/2011,5.0,If you are looking for delicious food at reasonable prices & brews this is the place to visit. I've been here quite a bit and I absolutely can say each time I visit it's GREAT!!! No bad reviews for me. This is definitely a favorite on my list.
Gordon C.,Oakland  CA,56,201,58,5/21/2010,2.0,If it wasn't for the large beer selection  I would give them just 1 star. It was over an hour wait when we got to the restaurant. We decided to just check out the bar and see if we get lucky and find a table and not wait for an hour. It was so crowded we could barely even drink our beers without elbowing someone. About a half hour later we got a table at the bar. However it took another 20 minutes to have a server come and greet us and take our order. We ordered a pitcher of their Indian red beer and a large combination. Beer was nice and cold. Pizza seemed like it was pre-made and barely warm or was sitting out for a long time. The cheese wasn't even melted all the way through. The server didn't even come back after delivering the pizza to our table for us to complain about the cold pizza. Very poor service. Come for the beer and sit at the bar.
Stephen B.,Folsom  CA,0,1,,1/3/2011,1.0,Food was very bland and left me feeling sick;Mens bathroom was littered with wet towels on the floor and pouring out of receptacle;Wait staff seems to be overwhelmed easily;One Manager in particular seemed to be acting very inappropriately with the 16 year old hostesses. Not sure the Manager's name but he had a Boston like accent.Just a terrible place to spend your money  might as well give it away to the Casino located down the road. At least then it's momentarily exciting.
Mike T.,Harrison Township  NJ,35,89,121,1/10/2011,2.0,"Like many other people have mentioned  do not go here if you have anything you are planning to do later. Slow. Yes it was busy  and I get that  but they were so disorganized! I laughed when I read the review about the hostesses not knowing what they were doing. There were 3 hostesses and a manger all standing in there little command center up front  and all with that wax museum or deer in headlights look. I turned in my name and stood with my wife (8 months pregnant) for over an hour. To be fair  I was told it would be 45 minutes  so I went to the command center to get an ETA on our table. She asked for my name  then asked me how many in my party. Um  no  I\'ve been standing here in front of you for over an hour  I didn\'t just walk in. I told her that I had checked in with her over an hour ago  and she calls a huddle with the rest of the crew. No one knew what happened  or how my name disappeared from their computer  so I was told that our table was coming up soon. The funny thing was  someone else complained about the wait earlier  and I heard one of the hostesses comment that there was a pregnant lady that has been waiting a long time too.Once again  I know that it\'s busy. But if you see that you are seating people ahead of people that have become a fixture in front of you  you may want to check on your ""system"". So we get seated at a table near the back of the room. A booth for the pregnant lady would have been nice instead of the wooden chair  there were plenty available  but whatever. We then wait 10 more minutes as servers walk by. A couple of guys get seated at a booth behind us and order drinks. I couldn\'t even grab anyone\'s attention to find out which server was ours. The guys at the booth behind us get their drinks. I was about to sneak water off one of the empty tables when I decided I had enough. I went back to the command center  but the manager had gone off somewhere  so I asked the Three-headed hostess if we had a server. They said they would check on it.Our server apologized  and was friendly  but everything was still slow. No refills on drinks  and took a while to get our check. Our server suspected we didn\'t have a great experience  so he got us a free dessert. Add one star.So 3 hours after we walked in  we were walking out to our car  wondering how we ended up in the BJ\'s time machine again. Were we going to some movie or something after this? Am I late for work? What day is it? Quick Marty  your parents are in trouble back in 1985  get in the car!"
Brett F.,Danville  CA,226,38,6,7/16/2013,1.0,"I have a bone to pick with this place  so first the service sucks! i mean really this is the worst. I feel like i\'d like this place more if they just spit in my food and gave it to me within a reasonable amount of time  then having to wait 30-45 minutes for a cheese burger. I am saying this not only during the slow times  but even in the busy times. I\'ve caught my waiter/waitress on their phones and chit chatting instead of refilling my drink  or while holding my freshly poured beverage. secondly  the foods not that good. lastly  i lost my wallet here about a year ago and it took over 2 months to finally get the General Manager to look at the security tapes. after seeing that he couldn\'t make out if i put my wallet on the table or not he concluded that he couldn\'t help me further and that\'s how my problem was resolved. oh and in those 2 months i was on the phone with some guy claiming to be manager  who kept saying he would call me back and never did. i ended up speaking to 3 ""managers"" and non could help me. I HAVE NEVER BEEN BACK SINCE! Try lucille\'s bbq next store! its waayyyyy better!"
Mary G.,Martinez  CA,1,3,,3/1/2010,5.0,I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoy BJ's. I am not a fan of restaurants at malls due to the fact that they are usually so busy all the time but BJ's is different. I've never had to wait long for a table and their employee's are super friendly. Their menu is extensive  which makes choosing something difficult with so many choices. Everything I've had there has been wonderful. They have a great full bar but I've only had their beers  which are great!! Its refreshing to have yet another choice for good food and beer in Concord.As I've stated before....sick of the Mexican & Chinese restaurants on every corner of the Bay Area. Great addition to Concord!!
Lindsey M.,Seattle  WA,8,151,,7/14/2011,3.0,Some good beers on tap (their own.) Some great salads  sandwiches  and oven brick pizzas. I love the pizookie and ice cream. Unfortunately I've experienced a lot more bad service than good service  even for their take-out! They've messed up orders  forgotten about us  my waiter ALWAYS seems to take a break in the middle of our meal so I always get a second server  and only once out of about half a dozen times has my salad dressing ever come out on the side  (my one and only ordering quirk.) Given the menu  it's a great alternative to Applebees and Friday though.
Michelle Q.,Los Angeles  CA,73,24,4,9/1/2013,4.0,BJ's is definitely my go to place when I want to grab dinner with friends. We arrived around 8pm and It was fairly busy. Theyre usually really busy weekend nights so expect a wait. However we got seated fairly quickly. Our server was Alex and he was quite friendly  they have a big menu so my friend and I took a while to.order but Alex was super helpful with the menu and patient with us. We took forever to decide lol. I ordered the creole tilapia and my friend ordered the tuscan chicken limone. Both were very delicious and for dessert we had the pizookie trio. It was yummy! Everytime I come here I always get the pizookie  its a must! The atmosphere is very chill and they usually always have the game on so its perfect for sports fans.
Fred D.,American Canyon  CA,76,8,,11/11/2012,1.0,Food was terrible because the service was awful please save yourself a lot of time and eat at a different restaurant
Marissa M.,Clayton  CA,2,54,3,11/12/2010,2.0,Had lunch with my mother here yesterday. It was Veteran's day so there was a 20 minute wait  understandable. We took advantage of the lunch specials  the specialty salad with added soup for 1 dollar extra. I had the honey crisp salad and my mom had the cobb. The salad itself was good but mine had like a chicken finger on top  and my mother's deli turkey. The soups were nothing special  we had minestrone and broccoli cheddar. The wine was good though (haha). The waitress was very nice  but the place was very busy. The gal that brought our soups was very short and pretty much threw the soups at us. I was a little disappointed because of the good things I'd heard BJ's.
S C.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,31,4,8/12/2013,1.0,On Saturday night  my kids and I were seated outside on the patio for dinner. After 20 minutes of sitting without seeing a server  another group was being seated next to us so I asked the hostess if a server could come greet us and take our order. Before the server  Jonathan  could get out  2-3 more tables had been sat after we had sat on the patio for all this time alone other than another couple who was already finished and just hanging out. Jonathan FINALLY shows up and proceeds to take all the orders around us and was heading back in until I spoke up. The service went even worse from there. My beer comes in a warm glass so it was barely cold when I did finally receive it. By now  the patio is filled up. 30 minutes go by and not a word from the server. Other tables around us were getting their food who had arrived and ordered after us. I ask about our food from another server who had brought items to other surrounding tables. She finally finds our food and my girls' burgers weren't even hot and my son's macaroni and cheese was a big blob with the top crusted over and dry from sitting under the heat lamps too long. Disgusting. He barely ate it and just had apple sauce. I would have sent it back but I doubted that we wold have ever seen it again so poor thing  he just ate what he could of it. My girls picked at their burgers and left most of it on the plate. Jonathan's customer service skills leave A LOT to be desired and if I was sat in his section again  if I ever go there again - which will be a LONG time - I would ask to be moved. Drinks didn't get refilled until we were literally minutes away from leaving. I had to ask for my bill and we waited 10 minutes for Jonathan to return with it so we could leave. I spent $50 for a horrible dinner and even worse customer service. For the money you spend at BJ's  do yourself a favor and go someplace else. Their service is ALWAYS  notoriously slow but this was ridiculous. I definitely feel like I got robbed of my $50.
A. H.,Benicia  CA,15,95,5,1/27/2012,1.0,This place is WHACK! only go here if you want to wait forever  be ignored by the staff and never get a drink... the food is decent but not worth waiting 2 hours for. Been here 4 times and walked out the last time  gave my $50.00 gift card to someone else  this place sucks.
Ryan E.,Woodacre  CA,0,1,,11/18/2012,1.0,sucks!!!! dont go to this terrible restaurant! rude servers  wait forever for food  awful!
Treesa M.,Russian Hill  San Francisco  CA,21,27,1,7/19/2010,3.0,Mmmm 1/2 berry cider 1/2 amber ale is so refreshing to drink on the patio on a nice day! Love the bruschetta. The menu is a bit overwhelming... I stick to the drinks and appetizers either at the bar or on the patio.
chris a.,Concord  CA,3,36,2,11/18/2010,1.0,"I went here for the first time back in October  for lunch. The place was pretty empty  yet they managed to take forever to bring me my food and the order was wrong (how do you manage to mess up soup?)So I decided I\'d give the place one more try. My boyfriend and I were seated very quickly  drink order taken and appetizer dish brought out fast! I was thining great...this place has changed for the better...that was my first mistake. After waiting over 30 minutes for our meal to come out  it finally did only his was the totally wrong dish! Not at all what he ordered. My drink was never refilled and at $2.25 a pop  I shouldn\'t have to chase anyone down for a refill. After another 20 minute wait he gets his order. My pizza was so so  not hot so it gets cold fast. It was awful that him and I didnt\' get to eat dinner at the same time.So we decide that we\'ll order dessert  ugh mistake number 2. We waited over 25 minutes for them to bring out a brownie dish  and it was not even cooked. That\'s right...it was RAW!! It took us over 1 1/2 hours to ""eat"" at this place  and that is just unacceptable. The manager did take the raw brownie and my boyfriends meal off the bill  however with two bad experiences here  I won\'t ever be going back there again.It\'s a shame that such a new restaurant is going down hill so fast."
Emily R.,Frederick  MD,29,67,,9/26/2010,1.0,There were so many tortilla strips in my salad  I thought it was a plate of nachos. Awful.
Jens M.,Antioch  CA,37,9,1,10/19/2011,4.0,I love BJ's Restaurant ever since my Dad introduced me to the place in Cerritos (one of the best). Now that we live just a couple of miles from the Sunvalley location I'm definitely going to keep coming back. I only gave it 4 stars because their pizza could use a lot more cheese. The last two pies I ordered from them barely had any!
Grace C.,Hacienda Heights  CA,85,5,2,4/13/2010,1.0,"WORST COSTUMER SERVICE EVER!i was there on march 12th wanting to celebrate my birthdayit was a friday so of course it was packedand i wasn\'t stupid so i actually called on the tuesday before that to make a reservation for 15 peoplei even called twice just to make sure that they got my time and date and everything rightmy reservation was at 9:30pm on friday and the manager did confirmed itokay  i knew that all of my friends were gonna be late so i even told my friends to be there at 9pmand a few of my friends actually got there at 9pm sharp  while i was still at another friend\'s place getting readyso when my friends got there at 9  i asked them to check in for me firstwhen i got there at about 15 min after 9  they were still waiting for the tablewell  that was reasonable since my reservation was at 9:30so i sat down and waitedwhen most of my friends arrived at around 9:30-9:40we were still waiting patiantlybut we waited and waited and waitedOMG! it was 10 o\'clock already!so i couldn\'t take it anymore and went up to the host and ask what was going on(since i asked once at 9:40 already and the host said that the last table is on dessert already so our table would be ready soon)and at 10pm  the same host  gave me an answer""your reservation was at 8 o\'clock and we kept it for you for 10 min but you didn\'t show up  so we gave the table to other people.""I was like WTF!?!?!?HELLO~then what was the point for me leaving my phone number here?and the last time i asked you said the table was almost ready?that just wasn\'t right and all of us were starvingso we just left and went eat at somewhere elsei mean  that\'s how you treat your customers?im never coming to this place ever again(i mean  just the particular location  i went to other BJ\'s  they were all pretty nice)"
Sheila T.,Oakley  CA,9,21,,8/1/2010,4.0,Okie dokie so 2 stars for the food  everything I have ordered here up to date has been very good   I highly suggest that if you like cheese sticks to order the cheese sticks  the ingredients used to make them is so fresh it is amazing. The ingredients used to make everything that they sell are so fresh its amazing. 1 star for how quickly we were seated  it was pretty packed and they told us about 20 minutes but we really only waited about 8-10 so I was pleased with their time management. 1 more star just because I like this place  the atmosphere is great and there is a bunch of huge TVs everywhere. Minus 1 star because our waitress was one of the fakest girls I've ever had serve me and she had the inability to actually listen. I orderd the fettucini alfredo (chicken free) and it came with chicken on it  which was fine I just took the chicken home to my dogs  but if I were on a budget it would matter because the dish is 2 bucks more with the chicken. For desert we ordered the chocolate pizooki with chocolate chips and batter and she failed to listen and brought normal chocolate chip  we did not want to wait for them to prepare another so we just ate it and it tasted good  however I still firmly believe that the waitress was a bimbo.So other than that  this place is good and you should still go there if you want good food and good if not great service.
Kathy B.,Pacheco  CA,1,11,,1/13/2012,1.0,Our recent visit was possibly the worst dining experience I have ever had. Service was slow and off  food was cold and bun on hamburger was more than stale  it was hard.Burger was broken into two pieces and way overcooked (no one asked how I wanted it done) Someone arrived at our table delivering our side of fries which we did not order - and looked at us as if we were crazy when we looked bewildered.The manager came over and gave us a long song and dance about how the corporation is great and personall oversaw the redoing of my burger and IT WAS WORSE than the 1st one. They did not charge us for the burger but I will likely never go here again. There are a least two places (not corporate) restaurants near by that serve great burger at way better prices (Chef Burger on Golf Club Rd & El Tapatio on Golf Club Rd - they have great mexican food AND great burger and steak sandwich)Take my advise and go local and stay away from BJs!!!
Ken L.,San Francisco  CA,88,407,28,6/17/2010,1.0,What the fuck happened to this place? It was average food for high prices to begin with  but now  where do I begin. Our lunch crew came here on Wednesday. We had to wait to be seated because it's always busy now for some unknown reason. Our waiter took a while to first come to us  and then he asked us what drinks we wanted. He also asked about appetizers  which I'm kind of tired of being asked about. I'm just here for lunch man - give me my food - let me the fuck out. And their prices are ridiculous already; I don't need to pay more for something none of us want. Our waiter disappears  then comes back with our drink orders  then takes our lunch orders...finally. He leaves  times passes  and some unknown dude  let's call him X  comes to our table with some soup. Who ordered the blah blah blah soup. You know who? Nobody at this fucking table! That's who. Ironically  sadly  my friend did order soup  but that one was not it. So our main dishes come out  which is served by some unknown person  let's call her Y. All around us it seems like they are trying to deliver the food by some method of random selection. Maybe if I just throw the food up in the air at some random table  maybe  just maybe  it will land at the correct table. Whatever system they are using  it sucks! Girl Y goes away after laying down 3 of the 4 plates of food  I think. It's gotten very confusing at this point  even for me. I can't remember who delivers plate 4  but my friend eventually flags down our waiter to bring out her soup. I look at her right after she takes her first taste of soup  or chili  or whatever it was. Uh  she looks like she has just eaten chili flavored with cat piss  which is what she says it tastes like. I wonder if it can really be that bad  so in my ignorance I try some. Wow  I don't know what it taste like  but it taste really weird  and I don't blame her for not eating another bite. On to the other friend's  who got sandwiches  delivered COLD! They are not supposed to be cold if you are wondering. Oh  and I think stale bread was pretty much the norm. My fish was okay  but the best part of everyone's meal was the chips  errrr  fries. We contemplated whether they ordered them from McDonald's though. I don't know if the entire regular staff was home watching the World Cup  which I hope is the case for them  but even if not  I doubt we will make our way back here. Massive Fail. Gargantuan Fail. Fail the size of Colossal Squid.Hrm  should I go there? Dear BJ's  your food now taste like bad cigarette tinged cum  and your wait staff are like the sperm that can't figure out how to make it to the damn egg. Was that in bad taste? Well  you are now in bad taste.
Dustin S.,Concord  CA,74,18,7,8/28/2010,3.0,"The beer is ok  the food is great! Very loud sports bar feel. I feel as though I\'m at the espn zone in Vegas. The pizza is fantastic! The beer is typical  nothing special for being a ""brewhouse."" Great place to go if you\'re trying to avoid the annoyance of the mall but still being at the mall."
Eric S.,Walnut Creek  CA,122,56,11,8/28/2010,2.0,"This particular BJ\'s was not good. I had the crispy chicken sandwich with the seasoned wedge fries and a Mt. Dew. First off Pepsi sucks and is a horrible way to start a meal. The chicken sandwich tasted like it had been fried in the same batter the fish was fried in  and subsequently tasted more like fish than it did fried chicken. And without seeing it  I would of thought I was eating fish... The seasoned potato wedges were under ""cooked"". They weren\'t even crispy in anyway and were almost raw potato in the middle of the larger wedges. The waitress was nice mostly prompt with her service."
La C.,San Francisco  CA,82,1051,44,6/16/2010,3.0,I guess we picked the wrong day for a birthday dinner celebration. The place was packed thanks to the Lakers/Celtics game. We arrived around 7 and were quoted a 40 min wait  we waited a little less than that. Our waiter took forever to come to the table and we were famished. We placed our orders and proceeded to wait and wait  finally we got our appetizer but 2 mins later our entrees arrived. The food is good and large portions but not gourmet by any means. I rather enjoyed the avocado rolls. We also shared the dessert trio and scored a free one for the birthday girl so we got to taste all the cookies  the peanut butter was my favorite. I do not know  if it wasn't for this being the birthday girl's request I would have left and happily ate at Claimjumpers instead. Parking was pretty harsh too  jammed packed. Overall ok and that's it.P.S. the TV went out for about 10 mins during the game and the manager came by to explain that their circuit blew out  we honestly didn't care but other patrons were freaking out.
Shelly M.,San Ramon  CA,0,5,,12/22/2011,1.0,Not gluten free!!!They don't substitute gluten free choices for the gluten containing items on the menu so your order is very sparse when it arrives. They clearly made a mistake on my order and scraped MOST of it off the plate to fix it. The waitress had no idea what gluten was. Stay away if you are intolerant.
margot b.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,55,2,7/4/2011,5.0,"Now I was only here for a pint while waiting for the Sun Valley Shopping Mall to open but I will definitely return. They have a tremendous amount of beers on tap including their own variety and Bartender Stacy was a delight to kill some time with. Love their seasonal beer ""Nit Wit."""
Christopher F.,Watsonville  CA,2,16,,6/30/2013,2.0,Food is good  service is dreadful. Hostess stands with back to the door and can't figure out seating. Absentee waiters abound. Only getting the second star because pizookies are crazy good.
Ashley Z.,Oakley  CA,0,15,,9/10/2013,2.0,I have been to several BJ's in the bay area and this one was one of the worst. It's quite a bit smaller than the other BJ's Ive been to. I didn't have to wait that long for seating  but my table was practically squished up against another table that was pretty noisy. They completely messed up the our order and took a good 30 minutes to correct it. It was lettuce wraps. I can't imagine how hard it could be to throw the ingredients on the plate considering the eater assembles it themselves. The chicken I ordered was cold and didn't have enough seasoning but I just wanted out of there so I decided to just pay and leave. Wont be coming back
Roberto F.,Twin Peaks  San Francisco  CA,0,53,,2/17/2012,5.0,Good food and I love the pazooki desert. Also very impressed with the management . The male manager who corrected our to go order was very professional. He even came out to personally explain the situation  and then brought our order out himself. He also credited our dinner for the delay. Again that made me very happy and completely made up for any issue. I will be going back soon.
Michael D.,Lafayette  CA,58,74,10,3/16/2011,4.0,The reviews are all over the board  but we had a great experience with the kids. Our servers were incredibly great...always there and yet not intrusive. I was even given a couple samples of beer to make sure I picked the right one. Very nice. They have an amazing selection of beers -- some of the best selections in Contra Costa County -- just don't always select the house brews which they push for obvious reasons. The pizzas and salads were top notch. Nice job BJ's  we will be back.
Jim L.,Pleasant Hill  CA,1,117,1,3/13/2011,4.0,"I love this chain. There are few places where you can get Black Cherry Soda and this is one or at least the chain is  not all the restaurants carry it but many do. If you\'re into beer or cider  this is the place for you.Ironically  I hated it the very first time I visited. Not sure why  it was a different restaurant though and not the one in Pleasant Hill. The place can be very crowded so I often opt for less popular times. Trying to make a ""reservation"" is a joke. They say they put you down on their list but I\'ve found this unreliable and simply don\'t go when I think it will be crowded.Service is pretty good for Pleasant Hill."
RedCub S.,Dublin  CA,21,85,,6/19/2011,3.0,We recently visited for lunch with my father in law and toddler in tow. So we needed a place that had something for everyone and we found it. The menu is expansive and the food was really good. Will definitely try again.
Suzie F.,Concord  CA,123,3,,8/26/2013,2.0,Went to a late dinner (8 p.m.) The waitrwss was unfriendly.  Food was fair  but not exactly what was ordered. 20 + minutes to get waitress to acknowledge us even though the place was not busy. Do not think we will being going back anytime soon.
J T.,Concord  CA,0,1,,11/25/2013,2.0,The food isn't bad tasting  but the wait for food and drink is horrible. You don't know what you are getting on your plate because the menu doesn't seem to describe it right. If you plan on having more than one drink I would order two at a time  or you could be waiting 20 minutes for your first beer. I've been twice hoping the second time would be better  but in fact it was worse. I will not go anymore.
Anne P.,Richmond  CA,1,11,,11/21/2009,2.0,"I love BJs and had eaten at the one in SSF and Vacaville... super-stoked to find out that it was opening nearby in Concord!! My BF and I arrived last Thursday night around 9pm. The wait wasn\'t long. We order a Sprite  beer  avocado eggrolls  soups  and 2 New York Strip steaks - I ask for ""medium rare."" Instead of Sprite  I get a watered down drink and ask the waiter for another one. After the fact he tells me that it\'s Sierra Mist  which is still fine. So after several minutes  I notice that that he still didn\'t replace my drink. I had to ask another waiter who was delivering my BF\'s beer for another drink. The Sierra Mist was watered down again  so I just asked for a Pepsi - tasted better. Then..... we get our soups and then our steaks... wtf.... what about the avocado eggrolls?? (I heard our waiter repeat the order and it did include the eggrolls.) They had been forgotten as the cooks in the back started to make it as soon as we mentioned we didn\'t get them. Anyways we start on our steaks  I not so adamently. The steak was already cold waiting several minutes for someone to bring us A1 steak sauce and kethcup - the manager finally did. At this time they realize their bad service.Great  so we get our eggrolls and then as I take a couple more bites of my steak and really look at it.... I realize it is not ""medium rare""... it is just rare... pink throughout and did not taste cooked at all........ WTF again! **Okay  who are you hiring.. were these people screened so you know that they can cook a freakin\' steak  right??** Anyone can easily undercook steak which is all about ""TIMING"" & attention. When you mess up on a NY strip  sorry  but it\'s almost unforgiveable.So finally after the waiter apologized sincerely and the manager offered free dessert and for us to only pay for the drinks (a small bill to pay under horrible circumstances).... I couldn\'t believe that this happened..... this has never happened to me before........... I gave a hefty tip because after all that  the manager and our waiter were trying to reach out to us and I didn\'t want to short-change anyone who was actually doing their job right."
Alyssa G.,San Francisco  CA,844,519,103,2/21/2010,4.0,"BJ\'s feels very much like a gigantic sports bar. It probably is. I joined a friend for Happy Hour here on Thursday. We walked in a bit early (nearly 4pm) and headed straight for the bar. Our bartender was energetic  helpful and very knowledgeable about all their draft beers....and trust me there\'s a lot! I like when places give you samples to try before you buy. She definitely helped us out there...I was able to sample a ""Nutty Brunette"" and a ""Jeremiah Red."" Gotta go with the red for round 1. After talking and drinking  I realized that I was starting to feel a bit loopy and ordering food would be the best idea.Mini Pizzas were 1/2 off  and so of course we had to get one: Margherita Mini deep-dish pizza. Not salty  felt a bit light yet filling enough to eliminate the buzz. That can\'t happen so we decided to order another round...this time she let us sample the Lindeman\'s Framboise  and a pear sparkling cider (sorry  didn\'t catch the name). Lindeman\'s Framboise was my choice  a sweet raspberry fizzy cider-like beverage. Not as heavy as a malt beverage like Mike\'s Hard Lemonade.By the time we were done  the restaurant had filled up and the room was a-flutter with people talking about how glad they are to be done with work for the day. Never knew there were this many people in Pleasant Hill. Good to know.Total: $25ish for 4 alcoholic drinks and a mini-pizza"
Angie M.,El Cerrito  CA,14,58,180,6/21/2010,2.0,Menu was not appealing whatsoever. I ordered ribs and they didn't even have any and this was Sunday in the afternoon (first day off NBA playoffs may I add)! First time experience was pretty lame. Doubt I will ever return.
Kris A.,Danville  CA,6,24,2,1/11/2011,5.0,Love the great white pizza and the triple chocolate boozkie.
Leo S.,Martinez  CA,46,3,,8/13/2013,5.0,Went there to have dinner with the wife. Say down and waited 40 min for drinks. My wife got her dinner before our appetizers it was just horrid inconsistent service never walked out of a place but this was ridiculous!!
Christine D.,Pleasant Hill  CA,4,47,74,1/3/2013,2.0,I have tried over and over to give this place the benefit of the doubt. The food is great but the service is HORRIBLE. Too bad because I really want to like it! They have an incredible variety of delicious food but I don't have 1.5 hours to spend on a lunch.
Chanel F.,Martinez  CA,9,35,,2/10/2011,5.0,This place made my top 5 restraunts as soon as it opened. Amazing food. Huge selection reminds me a lot of cheesecake factory. Love everything have yet to have bad food or bad service. I love their calzones  egg rolls  clam chowder and well everything else.
Rishi C.,Pittsburg  CA,2,2,,10/26/2013,2.0,Not so great service ... It is a Saturday afternoon 9 including me at the bar   sitting for 15 mins not even asked once if I needed anything while 2 bartenders standing on the far end talking ... Let's wait n see if I get a drink this afternoon ... Luckily the TV is on
Bebe E.,San Francisco  CA,239,107,7,1/4/2010,2.0,Let's get this straight  food gets 2 stars  management gets 1  but our server  Candi  gets a 5 star rating. I would even give her 6 if it was possible. But let me explain the distribution. My buddy and I came here one night  we hadn't seen each other in months since he'd moved out to walnut creek  and BJs is always a chill  laid back place to go  throw back a few beers  pay too much for barely decent food  but a fun sports bar atmosphere.If you want to actually read a review for the food/beer  please see others reviews on this place. Mine is for the service.Candi is an incredibly friendly  outgoing gal. Everytime I've been to a BJs in my life  the servers do the bare minimum to skim along acceptable service and recieve their tip. Candi kept my friend and I entertained all night  gave us great suggestions on the menu  I felt like we had bonded to become best friends in the 2 hours we sat at her booth. Basically  some of the greatest service I have EVER received  not only at BJs  but at any restaurant I've been to. And as I work in the restaurant industry  I should know how service should be. Anyways  as the night goes on  she tells us how ever since she had her son  guys don't leave their numbers like they used to. Well after we had paid  i prompted my buddy to leave our numbers because not only was it kind of an ongoing joke with her  but she seemed like a really fun girl for my friend to chill with. So on the way out  I ask to speak to the manager. Give him a glowing review of our experience  and walk out of the restaurant  beaming because she just made our night. Well lo and behold  she leaves us a voicemail later that night saying that her manager thought we had been friends of hers and she asked us to tell him that she had done a great job. excuse my language but WTF!?!?!?! how unprofessional can you be? Just because I'm a young adult and still in college  you disrespect my opinion? Well sir  I will not be gracing your restaurant with my presence ever again and to be honest  Candi is too good to serving in your dump of a corporate chain  and I hope she moves on to bigger and better things./end vent.
Charles O.,Fairfield  CA,0,2,,10/24/2013,2.0,The service makes this a poor choice for lunch. The service at this BJ's restaurant is extremely slow. I ordered soup and salad....a fairly simple request....but it took 25 minutes for the soup to get to the table. Your original waiter or waitress generally do not bring out your food so they have no idea of the quality of service you receive. Any requests made to the waiter/waitress usually gets missed by the person delivering the food. The menu offers numerous choices....most of which are good  but the quality of service over shadows the food.
Beatrice T.,Los Angeles  CA,303,357,101,4/4/2010,4.0,I try not to hit up the chain restaurants but for an oreo pizookie and cheeseburger pizza.. I am easily steered =) The bbq chicken salad is also really good but with all the cheese and fried onions on top  I hesitate to even call it a salad. And I actually prefer their jambalaya over the popular Cheesecake Factory version. Prices are a tad steep considering that the small pizza was ~$16? Regardless  I'll be back!
Mary L.,Concord  CA,65,10,,9/12/2010,2.0,We used to come here every Saturday for lunch  but I don't think we will be any more. The past two visits have been disappointing with orders screwed up and food tasting . . .well  just not as good  I guess. Just seems to be getting sloppy overall and it's too bad. The drinks are creative and the margarita flat bread pizza is tasty  but being told by our server that the Mac and cheese my son ordered was straight out of the box Kraft  getting soggy calamari and a chicken salad missing the chicken - well  I can find plenty of other places in this price range that care more about a customer's experience than turning a table.
Lauren S.,Lafayette  CA,102,153,25,2/18/2010,5.0,I love their happy hour menu!! Everything appetizer is $2 off and select drinks are like $5 each so I loaded up on shots and their California Club flatbread pizza! So good and its big enough to share between two guys and one girl. :) Staff is super friendly too and the bar area is huge! Ample parking outside and convenient location from the freeway! Can't wait to return for another happy hour rendevous!
Carl T.,Oakley  CA,58,12,,7/7/2010,4.0,"My daughter suggested this place the other day when we were at the Sunvalley Mall.I\'m glad we went  because we were not disappointed. The food and beers are really good. When seated  the first thing you notice is the extensive menu. I think it\'s over 15 pages long. Plenty of choice  that\'s for sure. We started with an order of the deep fried cheese sticks. They were cooked perfectly and the mozzarella cheese inside tasted like they had just made the cheese sticks by hand in back from fresh mozzarella. We asked our server if they were made fresh  but she didn\'t know. She promised to ask  but she never did  so I don\'t know the answer. I do know that we are  as embarrassed as I am to say it  cheese stick connoisseurs  and these were some of the best we have ever had. I had the Blonde beer as a drink. It was light and tasted like a fine ""German"" beer. I liked it very much. For my meal  I had the BBQ beef sandwich with the thin cut fries. The meal was delicious. The beef was nice and tender and had just the right amount of sauce. But the best part was the bun. Fresh  soft on the inside  just a little ""crunch"" as you bite into the bun. I would order it again  no problem. My wife had the potato skins for her meal. She wasn\'t happy with them. They looked good and there was plenty of them. However  the amount of cheese in them was anemic. Compared to the other meals we had on the table  you would think these things would be over flowing with cheese. Not the case. She only ate one or two of them and we brought the rest home for the dog. My daughter had a 1/2 pound Angus cheeseburger. She loved it. It was cooked just right and the meat was very tender. Once again  the bun was the star of the show. Toasted just right  soft on the inside  just enough of a crunch when you bit into it. The burger was so big that she only ate half and save the rest for later that day. The service was not the best I ever had. There was the inevitable ""I\'m going on a 30 minute break"" from our server and someone else took over our table. It wasn\'t terrible service  but it could of been better. But I\'m not done yet  because the next day we had the opportunity to visit BJ\'s again. We wanted the try the deep dish pizza that they serve. Me and my daughter order a pizza  but with no tomatoes. (They put fresh tomatoes on the top  not my daughters favorite) And of course  the pizza came out with the tomatoes on top. We pointed this out and the food server immediately offered for us to take that pizza home  which we did  and the food server went and put our order in again and had the pizza remade.  It was well worth the wait. The toppings were plentiful. But what really makes the pizza is the dough. The dough is crunchy on the outside and when you take a bite it just melts in your mouth. Is SO GOOD! Can\'t emphasis this enough. We really enjoyed the pizza. I highly recommend it. My wife had the french dip this time and wasn\'t disappointed this time. The roast beef on the sandwich just melted in your mouth. Plenty of cheese on the sandwich. The horseradish sauce was very tasty. For dessert we had a ""pizookie""  which is a fresh baked cookie that is baked in a little ""deep dish"" cookie pan. We tried the chocolate/chocolate cookie with vanilla ice cream on top. Just delicious. I highly recommend leaving room for dessert and having one of these. Once again the service was a little slow  had to ask for drink refills and settings for the table  etc. No  not the end of the world  but the service could have been better. They do offer the ""call ahead"" service so they can save a table for you  which is nice. All in all  the food is great. If you are going to BJ\'s  go for the food  not the service.  The only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars was the service."
N R.,Benicia  CA,2,7,,6/26/2011,5.0,This place is quickly becoming one of my new favorites. The baked potatoes are amazing. The service has yet to dissappoint. So glad a good restaurant has finally taken over this spot.
Timothy L.,San Leandro  CA,46,173,9,10/17/2010,5.0,I went here today with my aunt and uncle for dinner  they were pretty crowded but was able to get us seated within 15 minutes. The servers here are really friendly  and helpful when it comes to ordering. The food was great  i got the jambalaya  which had a nice little kick to it and had plenty of shrimp  sausages and chicken in it. The brewed rootbeer they had was a disappointment as it wasnt as carbonated as i would like it  but i didnt minus a star because when i asked him about it  he said that he would give me a sample of it and if i liked it  i can order it.
Jim T.,Reno  NV,63,20,,1/29/2011,4.0,Any time I've gotten pizza here  it's been excellent. The wait time can be atrocious  and I've had problems getting service as well. But the pizza is great.
Jenny C.,Concord  CA,3,21,1,6/6/2011,4.0,Happy our with friends on Wednesday night is a classic now!! Beers are delish  calamari super crispy  nachos are super good (specially with an ice cold beer!!) If not in the mood for beer  their cream soda is uber good  not to sweet  just the right amount. Don't care much for their entrees  except for the fish and chips. But then again  I just go for their appetizers.... and their beer =D
S T.,San Leandro  CA,2,163,9,1/18/2011,1.0,I was very very displeased with this place. I have been to other BJ's restaurants throughout California  and this is by far the worst one I have been to. I came here to celebrate my 21st birthday with my family  and it was the absolute worst experience. I was looking forward to a fun night out  but instead  I was disappointed. We called a week in advance to let them know we would be having a large party of 20 people. They seemed to be accommodating over the phone  but it was an entirely different experience when we got there.Our reservations were at 6pm and I showed up at 530pm since we brought a cake and wanted to be at the restaurant prior to our guests. We were told we could not be seated until half of our party arrived. Ok  no problem...so we sat at the bar. Service sucked at the bar! Then the manager informs my mom and I that we are sitting OUTSIDE!! Outside in January...i think not. He said that all large parties have to be seated outside which was a complete LIE since there was a large party of 50 seated down the center of the restaurant. Really?? Ridiculous. He said if we wanted to sit inside  we would have to wait an additional hour and a half. The outside ended up being semi-closed off with heating lamps but we were still cold and we could smell all the cigarette smoke from the smokers outside which made my guests who were pregnant to be extremely uncomfortable. As we get outside  they were seating us at SEPARATE tables!? WHAT!? By this point  i was extremely upset and wanted everyone to sit together. My mom  NOT the workers  had to put tables together and go inside to get silverware for everyone. Excuse me  am I paying my mom or the restaurant.Granted  we did have a lot of people so service wasnt going to be quick. But we only had one waiter for all of us and it took forever to get drinks and order our food. They should have brought in one additional person to help out. I did feel bad since the waiter was working his butt off to help and I was thankful for that. However  when I got my pizza that I was sharing with my dad  we were not giving any plates. My guests didnt receive plates for their food either! Then it took 10-15 min just to get plates and some of them were DIRTY! Later on  a random server brought a pazooki to my table for me to have for my birthday  but I was still in the bathroom. By the time I returned  the ice cream was completely melted and I had melted wax all over my dessert. That went into the trash...Even though the food was good  I was very displeased about everything in general. The manager gave my mom a gift card to return  but I moved out of town and will not be returning...so I did not benefit from this experience whatsoever. For being a restaurant that brings in a lot of customers  it is not large enough. Plus  they should have told us over the phone prior to me coming out there that we would be seated outside. I WILL NOT BE BACK!
Michy M.,Brentwood  CA,0,16,2,6/1/2013,4.0,Been here many times and the food is very consistent and tasty (never had issues with anything I've ordered). Love the beer and the happy hour is good...avocado rolls are amazing!!
William D.,Pleasant Hill  CA,238,209,80,12/10/2009,3.0,Stopped in on a Satuday afternoon with the girls about 1:45 & was told it would be a twenty minute wait.The buzzer they hand you for notification went off in about 10 minutes.The place was very crowded as you would expect around the holidays.Nice interior for a higer end bar & it seems very open & lots of bigs screens.Ordered the avocado egg roll appitezer ^ they were interesting & pretty tasty.For the main the misses & I split a cheesburger on a french roll with the string french fries & and a chopped cobb salad.Both were excellent.The Toots had a spinich sald & said it was pretty good also.For desert you have to try the chocolate chip cookie they bake in a small pizza ring topped with vanilla bean ice cream.Flipping excellent but you may want to plan a long run or gym workout the next morning due to the 2000 calories it contains.If this is a step above Dennys  I'm a little confused...(Way better then Dennys)
Colleen L.,Orinda  CA,13,27,1,1/13/2011,1.0,I was so excited to hear that BJ's was opening up around town! I used to eat at BJ's in socal quite often... satisfying my cravings for deep dish pizza  spicy chicken pasta  or pizookie!This particular BJ sucks. Absolutely sucks. We ordered the mediterranean which was bland and undercooked (BLEGH) and the Apple Berry Burst Crumble  which came out like.. a pan of microwaved jam and two melted puddles of ice cream. We sent it back and just got a good reliable pizookie. Guess what! UNDERCOOKED AGAIN. It was raw cookie dough  once again with two puddles of ice cream.Our waiter was amazing and responsive but the food sucked. Service was slow but I can't say it wasn't our server's fault. He was running around... seemed like the other servers were just getting paid to watch tv.Have I mentioned that this place sucks?
DANNY B.,San Francisco  CA,2,60,15,1/11/2010,1.0,This was the worse experience that i have ever had  my Pulled Pork Sandwich was dry like it sat out for a day then got put into a microwave for re-heating... Pretty gross .. I guess i will stick to the one in Newark because their Pulled Pork Sandwich was great...
Christina T.,Pittsburg  CA,0,2,,5/30/2010,2.0,"OVERRATED & OVERPRICEDWent here last night with my bf and his brother and cousin. Called ahead because I heard the wait can be ridiculous. anyway when we got there the  ""welcome"" hosts were busy with other people so I waited and when the crowd cleared the host greets the white lady (no offense) who just walked up next to me without so much as recognizing me ( young black lady with 3 young black men) She apologized when she realized what she did but still. We waited less than 10 minutes before our table was ready  ordered Jambalaya (nothing special)  some California sandwich ( very good) and several drinks including strawberry confusion ( delicious! tasted all fruit and no alcohol but i felt it. lol) adis mf that was not nearly strong enough to be called an adis mf...and a white peach mojito which was ok. We also order artichoke dip which was  really good but way overpriced @ $8.95 for chips and dip?!? Overall I probably wont be coming here again. The food was good but overall i think it was too overpriced for the food and service."
Erika B.,Hayward  CA,1,2,,5/26/2012,1.0,this is not the first time i have been to this particular BJ's  but this experience was absolutely AWFUL. I wish i could give ZERO stars for the service. Here is why....We arrived at 7pm for a party of 8 and used their call ahead service to put our name on the list before we arrived. Once we arrived and checked in  they told us it would be a 30-40 minute wait. An hour later  our buzzer goes off and we go to get seated. They take us straight to a table outside--but never asked if we had a preference and just assumed we would be okay with it. We were not. There were people smoking outside near the patio area and it was pretty chilly. We were then taken back inside and told we would be put back on the top of the list for the next available table inside that could seat 8 people. They didn't give us an estimated time of how much longer it would be  but just told us they have been waiting for another table to leave who had been there for almost 2 hours. FINALLY  we were seated...inside--almost 2 HOURS since our arrival. There were no free appetizers given  barely an apology--instead they just blamed it on the other table taking 2 hours before freeing up a table for us. Once we got to the table  our service from our server wasn't the best either. He took a while to get us waters  and once he brought them  he didn't even bring enough for the whole table. We finally ordered our food  they forgot a salad that was ordered and it just took forever to get anything accomplished. In addition  there was a large spill right next to our table and it seemed as though we were more worried about getting someone to clean it up  than the management was. We put down a napkin on the spill  so no one would slip and eventually someone came to clean it up.We were at BJ's for a total of 3.5 hours for dinner. Absolutely RIDICULOUS for a Friday night dinner. The food was delicious  but the service made the experience  less than appealing. Management NEEDS to do something to improve this  or they will loose a lot of customers.
Mouse K.,Bay Area,6,93,8,8/31/2010,5.0,I go here at least twice a week and enjoy it every single time. The food is never off. I usually get a chicken mustard salad and my friend gets the burger melt. The service is pretty good. I've been to the BJ's in Neward and Foster City all of them have been nothing but great.
Food C.,Concord  CA,0,1,,8/5/2013,1.0,Weakest service ever.. Ordered about three different kinds of beers each time the server came back saying they were all out of that. Wtf is it on the menu for..?? After there third miss I told them I didn't even want a beer anymore  service got even worse. I can honestly say ill never be returning to this chain brew house. Anyone considering save your self the hassle and time. GO SOME PLACE ELSE!!
Ivette K.,Concord  CA,98,43,,2/18/2011,2.0,I would only recommend this restaurant if your going to drink at the bar. The service is horrible. I went their on three occasions and each time was not a pleasant experience. Food wise well if they haven't ran out out anything it might be good. I think the only thing they have going for them is the poozkies that's about it oh and the deep dish. Over all this is a no no.
Tori M.,Fairfield  CA,59,107,7,10/1/2010,3.0,Came here after we rode BART back from an amazing Giants game! I'm not a drinker but the root beer is to die for. They serve it in this frosty cold mug and it freezes at the top  so delicious on this hot day! Food is OK nothing all that special  typical chain restaurant stuff.
Lee F.,Walnut Creek  CA,1,24,,2/16/2013,2.0,The food is good enough  but the service lacks.  I understand you're busy  but could you at least make eye contact and let us know that you haven't completely forgotten us?? Lack of communication makes for a bad dining experience. Unfortunately  the waitress actually got a good tip simply because I couldn't stand to wait any longer for her to come back with change. I figured this would cause me to stay another 15 minutes and I had somewhere to be.
Lincoln H.,Concord  CA,4,9,3,2/16/2011,4.0,We arrived there at 5:30 and had appetizers and drinks. I love all the Flat screens and the open area. I enjoy the selection of different beers. A little pricey for a hangout  but worth it on a once jn a while basis. Service is good.
Val B.,Honolulu  HI,496,164,75,5/23/2010,4.0,I liked the service here. I only had literally 40 mins for linner (lunch/dinner) because I was at work. I meet a group of girls there. They started with their cocktails. I came to the table. The server took my order immediately. I ordered the Honey Mustard Crispy Chicken Salad. Very Very Very refreshing and delicious! The food came out in about 7 minutes. My check came so quickly. I clocked in one minute early from lunch. Thanks!
Steve P.,Concord  CA,0,12,3,7/5/2011,1.0,My son and I went there because it was the only place open in the mall two hours before fireworks started at College Park. The hostess was nice and pretty and sat us two right away. Our server Andrew was pleasant and immediately asked if we wanted a house soda or ale. We opted for a root beer and cherry soda. I also ordered the seared ahi as an appetizer. The house sodas are served with no ice - I suppose because they are so yummy. However the mug was very warm from the dishwasher and the soda was super sweet. The root beer was strong but good  but the cherry soda was strong and just bad. I asked for ice and Andrew brought us a glass  half way attempt to add ice to our drinks  then gave up  mumbled something and left me to spoon ice into our drinks. After adding ice  the drinks were okay  but could have been more watered down for my taste.The ahi came and was alright. I had wonderful seared ahi at Outback a couple of weeks prior  and it was much better. When the ahi came I had to ask for utensils... because we had none - you'd think the server might have noticed that by then  maybe checked when the ahi was dropped off  but no.I ordered the chicken parmesan off the lunch menu and the boy got the classic bacon burger - both mistakes. The chicken I got was the worst I've ever had. It was hard and dry and the cheese was gross. There was no sauce  but it was served with spaghetti. The spag was overly spicy  but was the best part of my meal. As another reviewer mentioned  the burger is served on a roll  not a bun. The bun was gross and severely burned. The bacon was nasty on top of that burger. My son usually wolfs down a good burger. He stopped before half way and told me it tasted funny - the kiss of death for a ten year old. So I tasted it and he was right - gross. I tried a few of his fries and they were absolutely gobbed in some spicy stuff. I wanted to be in a good mood for the fourth  so I paid my bill and left  never to return.
Lets Go T.,Gold Beach  OR,0,26,36,1/9/2011,3.0,Best red ale  third trip. Not a disapointment consistantly good . Wide selection. Great pizza. The appetizers were great love spinich dip! Patricia did a great job on serving. Thanks.
Larry W.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,20,,3/15/2010,1.0,Nine of us had to wait over 40 minutes after we ordered for our food to be served. Restaurant was only 1/3 full. I had a BBQ rib dish that came with only can with a pototoe. No veggies. Food was barely warm & not very tasty. Some of the others said their food was good  others said food wasn't.Too many great restaurants around  I won't be going back to BJ
Tomo K.,Fremont  CA,3,100,,9/19/2012,1.0,On 2 separate occasions they forgot my food and brought me cold food! the very first time I just thought it was an accident and its hard to blame anyone because it could have been a server error or it could have been the cook not cooking all that well or what have you. But the 2nd time I went  not only did the server forget about our table  by the time he remembered us and brought us our very cold food  he tried to lie to us and tell us that they just came out and that it was a busy night  little did he know we were paying attention to all the other tables around us and they were getting their food before we were even though they sat down 10-15 min after us. Poor service  poor food quality  overall just a poor experience. I will never go back here.
Mich H.,Concord  CA,116,7,4,10/25/2010,4.0,Great selection of brews...and I love you can watch your favorite sports team from every table in the place!
Jac C.,Concord  CA,42,48,8,11/7/2009,4.0,I went to BJ's all the time when I lived in SoCal so I was really excited that a location opened in Concord. I really like their house beers and they have a big selection of other beers including bottled Belgians. They have really good mini pizzas but today I opted for the California Burger. It was really tasty and perfectly cooked. It's a hamburger patty on sourdough bread with cheese  avocado and green chiles. It came with some crispy shoestring french fries that were really good. To drink  I had a Pumpkin Ale and a Jeremiah Red. The Pumpkin Ale (their current seasonal beer) was tasty  kind of like banana bread mixed with pale ale. Jeremiah Red has been one of my favorite BJ's brews for a long time so of course that was good too. Service is really good. There are lots of friendly people around ready to help you whenever you need it.
Abby R.,Rohnert Park  CA,23,30,13,3/27/2012,1.0,We had a very disappointing meal here. It took 25 minutes to get our drinks and over 1/2 hr for our appetizer. It was about 55 min till our lunch arrived. The kids were never offered refills on their sodas or more water for my husband.... Our waitresses name was BIE..... Tattoo under right ear. She seemed distracted the entire time and when she did manage to come to our table she was looking around and not focusing on us. Her relief David was great. Would have asked to talk to a manager but we were pressed for time. Took too long ... And food was mediocre.
Daniel B.,Vallejo  CA,28,17,2,7/4/2010,3.0,"We go to BJ\'s probably around once every other month. Overall  we do really like them. but definitely have a few issues with them as well.Our usual order:*Appetizer - mozzarella sticks: I could just order a few plates of these and make a meal of it. *The wife - fish & chips: Some of the best around. Most places rarely get it right  but they nail it every time and their fish is very high quality. *Myself - roast beef dip sandwich (au jus): Consistently the best french dip I have ever had. Other things we\'ve ordered:*Pizza - Yea so i guess this is what they\'re known for. It was pretty good but still - It\'s just pizza  not like it\'s Zachary\'s or anything...*Pizookie - My wife enjoyed this dessert. I was a bit bored with it.*New York steak - oh this one was BAD. it was just a flavorless chunk of meatiness. Blah. So disappointing.The Experience:*The Dining Room -  Expect it to be loud - loud music  TVs  and loud wasted party goers abound. Expect a very long wait for a table  unless you feel like eating on the patio. The servers are always great though  once you actually get seated.*Take out - We just tried their ""curbside"" service last night. It was a complete joke. I called in our order and was told it would be 20-25 minutes. I show up 25 minutes later to find an abandoned take out counter. After a few minutes a girl shows up at the counter and confirms my order. She says everything is ready and she just has to go in the back to get it and disappears. She didn\'t come back for over 15 minutes!! Eventually a hostess offers me a complimentary drink and later had to page the girl that was getting my food. It was ridiculous! In all I had to wait for over 20 minutes from the time they told me to show up to pick up the food. We thought maybe the food wasn\'t ready when i showed up and the girl was just lying about it  but the mozzarella sticks and crispy thin fries were totally rubbery like they\'d been sitting for a LONG time. I don\'t know that we\'ll do the take out thing here any more."
Marcus R.,Phoenix  AZ,763,51,14,1/29/2011,5.0,Love the bar set up here....cracking on Fri & sat .....like the beer sampler and wingz....
Derek S.,Concord  CA,1961,156,53,11/5/2009,4.0,I've been to all the local Bj's Restaurants in the area (Sf  Sac  East Bay) and was very pleased both times i have went to this one. Staff is very friendly and helpful. My most recent time in  there was a small error with my food in which then very much made up for it. With free desert and meal. I will for sure be going back scene i finally have one close to home!! It is a lot smaller than the other Bj's and gets full pretty quick  but very glad to have one here. Beers are great  food is a above average in comparison to Elephant Bar and Cheesecake Factory.
dan a.,San Francisco  CA,115,150,,10/20/2009,2.0,i've been to BJs in other cities before  but AVOID the concord location until they get their act together...maybe it's because they just opened  but the service was HORRIBLE. when you eat at a chain restaurant  you can expect the same food  so of course service would make the difference. and it did... in a bad way.my party of 8 was seated 30 minutes after we had all been there (which would have been okay  except for the fact that we had reservations!). but the best part was that they seated us IN THE BAR AREA which is open seating anyways! the circular booth we were shoved in was obviously meant for 6 people MAX.do i need to continue in detail about how one of our plates went to the wrong table (so we got a new one late) and one of our desserts NEVER CAME?! as i was the one paying  i noticed that they comp'ed us the late plate  but failed to do anything but apologize for the missing dessert  AFTER I HAD ALREADY SIGNED THE CHECK WITH A FATTY TIP! It takes pretty extreme circumstances to make me a poor tipper  but if could have gotten my check back  I would have been one...moral of the story: DON'T GO! if you want a deep-dish pizza  spend the time you'd be waiting for a table by DRIVING to ZACHARY'S in either oakland/berkeley or san ramon and getting some REAL deep dish.
margaret l.,Pittsburg  CA,25,40,,12/28/2009,1.0,The good news we didn't have to wait. The bad news service was slow to poor  food was worse. The waitress asked me if I wanted a refill on my soda  20 mins later I got it. The food was horrendous  so much so both myself and my friends got ill from eating it. I had the chili cheeseburger  the fries were good (seasoned fries) but the chili tasted like the beer wasn't cooked out of it enough (all I could taste was beer). It took the waitress another 25-30 mins after we ended to bring us the bill.  I left over half of my meal. I will not go back  service is worse then the Cheesecake factory but at least there you get the cheesecake.
Lois R.,Los Angeles  CA,66,106,1,4/29/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Went in there for lunch. Baked potato with minestrone soup. One coffee  a sprite & bottom less soup & salad option. [I know  very light lunch but BJ's has huge portions] Btw this is between my homegirl & I. Her & I sat @ the bar & got immediate attention. The lady bartender running lunch was quite pleasant and super nice. She even split our Jeremiah. Loved the lunch crowd  their quite chill. Not bad for a Tuesday lunch.
Jack N.,San Francisco  CA,6,81,84,1/30/2010,3.0,i think this place is good  but the location in foster city area by san mateo is better. this place is new so it still has a few waiters getting used to the menu and taking orders (ex.: my waiter put jalapenos on my pizza  instead of on the side like i asked for which ended up burning my butt to infinity cuz i dont send food back and i really wanted to like him cuz he was starting his life over here after a tragic ending in san diego plus he was a nice guy and i felt bad giving him a shit time for such a small but painful gassy experience and ...anyway i'm getting off track)i recommend the southwest pizza. they have a beer  that's dark in color. definately a stout. and definately over 5% i'm sure (now errrbody in'a club gettin tipzz)good place  but maybe once every 2-3 months at the most for this one.can get severely crowded. waited about an hour for seating on saturday night.
Casey C.,Pleasant Hill  CA,360,101,1067,5/28/2011,3.0,good food  love the stuffed mushrooms  the pizza is ok not my favorite... every time I go the service absolutely sucks...
Benjina D.,Frisco  TX,839,187,437,10/26/2009,2.0,"I\'d tack on another half star to the two stars I\'ve given  but that\'s it...tops. I\'ve been to many BJ\'s Brewpubs  especially in Texas  and I have to say  this one sucked. So they\'re new  ok  I\'ll give them a break for not having their waitstaff together. But having bad food is no excuse  especially since what they serve is standard fare that is served in all BJ\'s restaurants nationwide. Brownie points for being seated on time  after having called ahead to be put on their list. Another star for giving us a booth (there were only 2 of us). I was disappointed at not seeing the chilli cheese fries on the menu. They used to have the thick cut fries  with chilli and cheese on it -- it was the bomb! So  we opted to get the nachos that the waitress recomended. It turns out  that they do offer the thick cut fries  they have the chilli and the cheese  so why the waitress didn\'t just offer to have the kitchen make them for us was just weird. Anyway  the chilli cheese nachos weren\'t done right the first time around. Not enough cheese  it had olives (we asked for no olives)  no sour cream  and no salsa on the side. Second round of nachos came  and they looked good enough. One layer of chips into it  we were out of cheese  and there was no chilli to speak of. It was all dry chips. After playing with the plate  and digging into the middle of the stack of chips  I finally found the chilli...all on the bottom of the plate  and stone cold. Wtf?On to the pizza. We ordered a medium with onions and green peppers  well done. The pizza didn\'t have enough sauce on it. I know  I know  Chicago style has sauce on the top...but trust me  this one did not have enough. And  not enough cheese either. The pizza dough was doughy  and not at all well-done  or crispy. The toppings were falling off the pizza as we lifted the slice. My husband pointed out the dry  sauceless  cheeseless parts of his slice to the waitress  who said  ""oh  you must have gotten a bad slice."" Really? How about the rest of the pizza? Must have gotten an entirely bad pizza  I guess. She never did offer to do anything about it  and simply walked off. We also had the Blackened Chicken baked potato  which was ok. The chicken had been re-heated  so it tasted really dry. The alfredo sauce was horrible. Tasted watery  and I wouldn\'t want it anywhere on a pasta dish  if that\'s the same sauce they use. The saving grace was the pizookie. It was awesome! We had a warm peanut butter cookie with chocolate ice-cream...mmmm! Also a plus point: Cowboy games! So  would we come back to this BJ\'s? Yes  but we\'ll be sitting at the bar  having a drink  eating a pizookie  and watching the Cowboys play."
C B.,Clayton  CA,0,63,,6/14/2014,2.0,Super slow for a Thursday! We came in to celebrate the last day of school & I think half of Pleasant Hill had the same idea along with those who wanted to watch the soccer game in Brazil. We arrived at 1:00. Our server was horrible!! After we were seated he took forever to get our drink orders & we were hungry & ordered an appetizer. After about 20 minutes he comes back to take our orders. Mom & daughter split a pizza & mom wanted a house salad to go with it. Her salad comes out BEFORE the appetizer & it is the saddest salad I've ever seen. It had 4 pieces of lettuce drenched in ranch dressing. It was a disgrace to call it a salad. The BBQ chicken on the pizza was DRY. My daughter picked it off because she couldn't eat it. Chicken tacos on the other hand were great. Our server never brought us our food someone else always did. The only thing he did do was refill drinks when we asked. A good server should be on top of the drink situation. After we ate we decide we need to eat a pizookie! By the time we got out of there it was almost 4 pm This was the longest lunch!
John S.,Chicago  IL,0,14,1,3/10/2011,2.0,BJ's is awesome.Regardless how awesome and amazing though... Sunvalley BJs sucks. Second time going  and second disappointment. The San jose one is great  so is the Reno one!First off the waiter [RODGER] was TERRIBLE. didn't give us refills on water  took forever to give us our food and take the order  never asked how the food was  and the group who arrived 20 minutes after us got their drinks before WE did! The food was good at least. We got less portions than at the other places. specifically the avocado rolls. we got a two topping medium pizza but he charged us for a three topping....?! Plus when we paid we wanted 20 cash and the rest on the card.... he put all of it on the card and just broke the 20 for us.... who hired this guy? Seriously!He spilled our pizza as well and blamed it on us saying we made him nervous. I don't see how though?at least the semi-new wildberry mojito was okay.
Jamie D.,Berkeley  CA,108,5,1,6/1/2011,2.0,I worked at this location for almost 2 years...since they opened. I finally had to quit because the servers were lazy and the restaurant did not run very efficiently. That is not to say that there are not a few Gems there. Of course  there are about 5 servers who are amazing  and a few menu items that are always popular. I would always recommend the Jambalaya and the Parmesan Chicken with cheddar mashed potatoes  but ask for extra chardonnay butter sauce...trust me. The pizzas I feel are a joke...need to be cooked longer than they are  and not worth the calories you will pack on! The problem with this place is that the menu is so F****ing big  and they add new items every 3 months (good for variety  but bad for server knowledge). They also make the servers go through all of these retarded steps of service  which are suppose to create efficiency  but makes us sound like robots that dont really care. I always ventured away from the steps of service  which low-and-behold made me one of the best servers  and I had a ton of regulars  secret shoppers of course got in the way...I decided it wasnt worth being a drone and quit! So I would recommend Bjs if you are looking for a fun place to kick back and drink some beer and watch a game in the bar  f the dinning room  and be really friendly to your server...trust me they get enough bs from the manager there! Good luck!!
Melissa M.,Bay Area,73,126,,11/3/2009,2.0,I went here last night for happy hour with some friends. The food was good  but the service sucked. Our server seemed out of it and made my husband repeat his order to him multiple times. Seriously  dude. Freakin' write that ish down already. I mean  it was a little loud  but if the server actually paid attention to what my husband was saying  he would've gotten the order. I asked him three times for new place settings  but I never received them. Luckily  I ordered pizza  so I didn't need a fork  but I still wanted a napkin. I was forced to use beverage napkins that were left on my table. I know they opened recently  but they really need to work on training their wait staff to do their job.
Matt H.,Oakland  CA,6,61,1,3/7/2012,4.0,I go to school near BJ's and enjoy going for lunch. Their beers are great and their food is always good. The servers have always been friendly and capable. Their desserts are quite popular as well. I went with a friend of mine who doesn't eat gluten  and their gluten-free pizzas are awesome. I definitely recommend this place.
Logan P.,Bay Area,103,184,39,11/8/2010,5.0,About a year ago i've always been hearing about Bj's from my friends and family. Never got to eat there until early this year. Now ive been there about 5-7 times and the customer service there is always friendly.. I was just there for my wifes BDAY and she made them take lots of pictures and the waiter didnt complain one bit. He didnt even look like he was irritated or anything. I like the fact that they have a pretty good variety of beer you can choose from and the food is definitely above average.. Nice place to go eat with friend and family. And its right next to a 24 hour fitness  if your feeling fat after you eat there. You can go work off your calories or whatever..
Yishra L.,Pleasant Hill  CA,98,49,1,3/29/2010,4.0,I think there's been too much hype about BJ's. The food is good  it reminds me of Cheesecake Factory but I like the food SO much more. It's a bit pricey and not as AMAZING as everyone made it seem but then again I get high expectations when people praise something too much (such as many movies) so I try and not listen to anyone's over enthusiastic comments about something. All in all  service is good & the food is yummy.
Kay S.,Concord  CA,0,7,,10/25/2010,3.0,Food was just ok. Service good but nothing special. Had the peach drink. Not worth your money at all. The atmosphere is good.
Christina S.,New York  NY,2,46,3,4/24/2012,1.0,Foods good if your lazy and don't wana cook or eat mcdonalds. Service fucking sucks even if you order to go.
Dale B.,Pinehurst  NC,1,14,,1/5/2011,4.0,Nice place to stop and have a quick bite before shopping. The happy hour menu has a good veriety and the prices are reasonable. Our server was very friendly and right on top of everything. The number of TV's makes it easy to watch sporting events.
Matt W.,Oakland  CA,0,101,,11/14/2009,2.0,Took forever to get a table  and the wait for the fun was about 30 minutes. And when the food arrived it wasn't even cold  and 1 of the orders was totally wrong. It took another 20 minutes to get a new burger out on the table. When I used the restroom  I slipped on the wet floor  and told a waitress who said I need to tell the manager (i guess that isn't in her job description). So when we got the bill we spoke with the manager Justin  who apologized and said he was going to give us coupons for our next visit  but after waiting 10 minutes and seeing a crowd of people waiting for a table we just left.I don't recommend this place.
Bob T.,Concord  CA,0,1,,5/31/2014,1.0,I just had dinner here a few hours ago and let me tell you it was the worst service I've ever experienced. The hostess was clueless and our waiter was an idiot and a racist because he acted differently towards minorities. A couple sitting next to us had to complain to the manager because the idiot didn't put in their order and next thing you know he starts taking his anger out on us and slams our waters on the table and he even threw a chair to the side! How unprofessional can you get especially in front of customers. All the workers act like they are all so busy when in reality they are just walking around and doing nothing! These people don't know what busy is  I've been to restaurants in the City that are super busy with crowds and lines going out the door and yet the staff manage to be friendly and professional. I know the future of this restaurant and let me just say it's not pretty  especially with a mediocre staff like that.
Rosemary M.,Berkeley  CA,0,24,,8/22/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"We took my mom there for her birthday lunch on a Saturday; we\'d been here a couple of years ago and enjoyed it. This time it wasn\'t good and we won\'t be back. Slow service  mediocre food; there were things wrong with every item ordered! Pizza was half BJ\'s favorite and half veggie  way too doughy  barely any sauce  lukewarm when it arrived and the pizza stand wobbled when you tried to remove a piece. The pork chop entree was overcooked (tough) and the green beans were undercooked (just this side of raw); we had to ask for a steak knife to cut the chop. The caramelized onion was asked for on the side and it never made it to the plate at all! The fish and chips were overcooked  almost burnt  and the fish (must have been pollack) had no flavor and was dry; the wedge fries were very good. The server constantly tried to ""upsell"" us from appetizers and drinks to dessert. First we were told cutlery would be brought  then we asked for it and finally when we were served  they still hadn\'t brought anything. The server did offer a complimentary pizza-cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a candle which was very nice of them."
D B.,Concord  CA,0,21,,11/15/2012,3.0,I have been to BJ's several times and have to say  they food is very good. For lunch you can sit at the bar and get good service. The problem is when things get busy. Last week we came by on Saturday with a group of 10. It took 20 minutes to get our order and over an hour to get our meal. One meal actually came 20 minutes after everyone else's. We called the Manager  who took off one meal. I wish he would have taken off the tip  which came to almost 3 meals! Again  food is good. But the service stinks when they are busy!
Jessie L.,Martinez  CA,0,66,,2/13/2012,1.0,I've had a bad experience at this particularly BJ's more than once. Last week I ordered take out. When I arrived it took them several minutes to come outside only to say they didn't have my order. 10 mins. later they realized they did have more order. It ended up being over 50 mins. before I actually received my food. I only stayed because they gave me the meal for free and a gift card. When I got home the food was overcooked and over seasoned. I do like BJ's. I've been to some in the South Bay and I have had better experiences. However  after this experience  II honestly don't know if I want to even bother going back to use the gift card.
Megan J.,Lodi  CA,3,10,,5/13/2012,2.0,I'm giving it a 2 because this use to be my favorite restaurant. I always enjoyed my service and food. Even though I have enjoyed goin here for years with my friends and family  I will never go back again after today!!!! That's a promise!!!! I can't believe the kind of service and overall experience I had there today. I wanted to cut them some slack on the fact it took so long to get our food  but that's nothing. So we get our food my sisters moms and my food were all cold. The waitress sees that we aren't eating our food and walks by 2 and still didn't ask what was wrong. The waitresses family and friends were at the table next to us what does she do she stands there talking with them and eating food (with her hands and mouth open so gross) and then goes and serves people there plates  nasty girl wash your hands. She finally comes over and sent my sisters food back. We went and food the manager ourselves  he didnt have much to say except he would talk to her I guess he did. Wait for this  as we get up to leave the restaurant the waitress is telling the table of people she knew how we told on her and what do they do the waitress and the whole table started yelling at my sister and calling her rude. Were classy people so we walked away and just politely told the manager after all the business we gave you we will never be back we pointe to the table and the waitress and they were waiving good bye at us like the one a match on being the trashiest people in concord  congratulations you won!
Christine P.,Daly City  CA,80,401,285,12/21/2009,4.0,"this is the 5th bj\'s location i\'ve been to (oxnard  cupertino  elk grove  san bruno  concord) and  because of this chain\'s consistency  i round it up from a three to a four.i normally do not like chains because i\'m pretty sure of the food is frozen or prepared offsite - which totally goes against my food religion. but i enjoy bj\'s because the chain itself has consistent service and food.my bf took me here for dinner and it was his first time. he didn\'t like how the waitresses were ""crackheads."" what that means is that they check up on you every 2 minutes and they\'re all SUPER HAPPY. yeah  i\'d have to say i don\'t like that either.he had a sour dough burger and i had the NY strip. both were good  but not outstanding. we did however LOVE the potato skins. i personally haven\'t met a potato skin i haven\'t liked - yet.we\'ll be back  but not before i can go down to costco and actually make our own burgers and steaks. they\'ll probably be more tasty."
Dorothy M.,Lafayette  CA,70,149,13,12/13/2009,4.0,I consider this restaurant a poor man's version of the Cheesecake Factory. Well it's not that cheap but more affordable than Cheesecake for sure! I like the many options. The food is usually executed well even when you order to-go. Pretty delish drinks as well!
Laura C.,Concord  CA,64,9,,7/12/2010,4.0,Been a fan of BJ's pizza for years but just tried this BJ's for the first time. Great deep dish pizza  italian chopped salad  and beers- just like always! We also had excellent service- we had only been seated a minute when someone came over to tell us our waiter would be right there. This guy took our drink order and our waiter was at our table a couple of minutes later with our drinks and ready to take our order. He checked on us throughout the meal and brought the check out promptly. We don't eat BJ's pizza often because it's not exactly healthy  but it is always a great treat when we do get it! Ooh  and don't forget to get a pizzooki for desert-YUM!
Jory S.,San Francisco  CA,193,118,2,1/12/2010,5.0,Great food  Great Prices  Great Service. Amazing buzz and energy there. LONG overdue to see a BJ's in Contra Costa County! Welcome to the neighborhood BJ'S!
Mark D.,Vallejo  CA,3,58,,11/14/2009,3.0,They're stuff is decent. It's like Cheesecake factory without the 2 hour wait (though I haven't been there during peak hours/days). They have a wide variety of items. Perhaps too wide a variety. Some things are great  and some things are ho-hum. Service can be pretty slow at times.All in all  not bad.
John Z.,Orinda  CA,10,99,12,11/9/2009,4.0,Been here a couple times  pretty decent food and great selection of beer. The floors are damn slippery though. Watch out!
Heidi T.,Sacramento  CA,1,25,,6/12/2010,3.0,I def wouldn't try to come here around dinner time  especially on a weekend. It seems to be the only hot spot in Concord where everyone migrates to after 6pm. For lunch I would recommend BJ's. I love their deep dish pizza. I've tried their specialty pizzas and they're great and so is their simple peperoni pizza. Great crust! However  the staff does need some work. One waitress was about to end her shift and she would not stop buggin every 5-10 minutes. She was so anxious on leaving and giving us our check and we hardly received our plates. She needed to chill out or have someone else tend our table bc she became so annoying. I understand you are in a hurry to leave but do not rush me!Another time late on a Friday night  there were two groups of people arguing. One girl took off her heels and you know somethings going to happen after that. They were  no doubt  causing a scene but not one manager or staff member did anything. This wouldn't have pissed me off as much if the girls hadn't picked up glasses and start throwing them. Of course  we would be right behind one of the girls who threw a pepper shaker so then a glass was thrown across the room back in our direction with inaccurate aim and hit someone at our table. REALLY? As if this couldn't have been prevented if the commotion was taken out of the restaurant at the time it started. Bad experience.Overall  decent food  slight overpriced  come when it's not so busy to enjoy your meal.
Chris P.,Livermore  CA,0,16,,6/10/2010,4.0,I absolutely love this place. The food (especially the pizza) is to die for.Service could be a little better and faster.
Colin P.,San Francisco  CA,27,597,42,8/21/2010,4.0,Good food and great atmosphere. A little busy on a Friday night.
charlotte c.,Walnut Creek  CA,111,6,,12/29/2009,2.0,Service sucks big time. Our food was late and kinda cold (I had pasta)  they messed up on one of my guests orders (their order wasn't made so he had to wait longer while watching everyone else eat)  I asked for a lemon wedge for my water (never got it)  the waitress accidentally charged us for 3 sodas when only 2 we're order and she argued with us until she realized she made a mistake  and the waitress lost one of the check receipts (our guest had to sign another)It was tempting to not give a tip  but to be nice  we did it anyways. It gets 2 stars because the food was decent.
Lead F.,Leesburg  VA,0,28,3,5/1/2010,5.0,This is the best BJs of them all! What makes it better? Not only do they have their own beers  they have an awesome selection of beers - mostly Belgium. Try the Bezelbuth from France and Scaldis from Belgium and Monks Cafe Flemish Sour Ale from Philly. Paradise on Earth in Concord!
Charles B.,Vallejo  CA,11,110,,10/27/2011,4.0,I like the lunch specials and the beer is great! Service can be slow and sometimes really disorganized when we come with 5 or more people. Where one person gets an incorrect order or their lunch does not come until almost everyone else is done eating. We really like their wedge salad and rich tomato soup. And we tend to split the cookie and ice cream for dessert.
Alex M.,Berkeley  CA,2,30,3,11/16/2009,2.0,Went to BJ's tonight  after being very excited about the new location opening up here. I had eaten at BJ's in LA  and I remember it being really good.Well  this time it wasn't really good. We went on a weeknight  so seating or wait times weren't a problem at all. But maybe that messed up their timing  because our food came all at once. So the salads hit the table  and the pizza came about ten seconds later. Another problem with timing was that when the server took my card at the end  she kept it for like ten minutes. If I have any bogus charges I know right where to go. Actually  they changed servers on us halfway through. The first gal came by every ten seconds to ask it we had saved room for a Pizookie  and the second was kind of distant. The service was pretty much whatever.The food was pretty much in the same boat. The salads were actually bad. I had the Caesar  and the lettuce came with a bunch of wilted pieces included. Also  Caesar is supposed to be made with romaine hearts  and this was mainly the tips of the leaves  so it was kind of tough and dry. My friend had the house salad  which wasn't much better. I had the house amber ale  and it was not very good at all. Almost a weird chemical taste. I didn't finish it.Ok  the pizza was actually really good  which it should be because it's their signature thing. No complaints here. Hot. Nice chewy dough  crispy crust. Tasty and satisfying.In summation  you can tell walking in that they basically hire a bunch of 19 year olds  and the dining experience really shows it. Nothing was polished  nothing was truly professional. One more quick example. My friend asked for water  and the dude only brought one. Pretty standard I think  that they should think to bring one for each diner. Its the little things. They have a great service where you can call ahead for a pie  park in these two special spaces out front  call em again  and they will walk the pizza out to you. I would recommend this  because while the pizza is good  the restaurant sucks. Get it to go.
Daniel A.,Walnut Creek  CA,85,36,1,2/22/2012,4.0,Honestly if it wasnt for the slow service I'd eat here more. I LOVE the ghiradelli triple chocolate pizookie. It's to die for  and with as many calories as it probably has  you probably will. The sourdough burger and fries are tasty but a couple times my food was borderline cold and would literally take an hour after ordering. This place gets busy so be prepared. Honestly I would come here just for the dessert! I almost gave it 3 stars but that pizookie....
Dane W.,Concord  CA,0,3,,2/20/2010,5.0,Very fresh flavorable foods and salads. Hand crafted beers  efficient and courteous staff. It has become a regular for us.
Dimitri K.,Brentwood  CA,237,14,,5/11/2010,4.0,Ok  Im not a big fan of chain restaurants  they always make me feel like IM eating some microwaved plastic in all so I rarely go to them. But my buddy and I decided to give it a flip and a whim and give it a shot. I was in love with the decor of the place. Liked the look of the bar and being an avid sports fan  I loved all the TV's. Had a wonderfuld server Amanda who was very attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. Had their homemade root beer and it was just root beer to me-nothing special. Followed by a fried calamari appetizer which I really enjoyed. The batter was real good  and the two sauces served with it were pretty good. For my main course I had the fish tacos. The halibut was fried to perfection which was a surprise since most of the chain restaurants overfry and destroy everything that they touch. My buddy had a bacon cheeseburger and seemed to like it very much. Overall  I cannot complain. For what it is  I would definitely repeat to go back for lunch or out for some coctails and apps. It was a real nice touch to my day
Angie E.,Livermore  CA,493,44,5,8/19/2010,1.0,First I will say that I've had dinner at other BJ's locations (and love their food and usually get pretty good service at other locations) so this is strictly my opinion on this Concord location only.It's a Wednesday evening and we had a group of 7 ladies. Parking at this location is a bear because it shares the same lot as a 24 Hour Fitness. Our car load of 4 circled 4 times up and down and finally just settle parking around the corner taking a little bit of a walk.Remember  it's a WEDNESDAY!!! We get there and they said that it was going to be less than an hour wait...I've NEVER had anyone tell me that at the other locations when I eat mid week. We had put our name in at 627pm. We're standing outside and their entire patio area is pretty much empty with the exception of 1 couple. Didn't think anything of it at the time and since there was 7 of us we just had good conversation while waiting. We checked with the front twice on our status and they kept saying that there were 2-3 parties in front of us...well what is it  two OR three? how do you not know? FINALLY at 737pm we got seated...the gal asked us if the patio was ok. we said yes (cause we're starving at this point). we get seated out in the patio and so did two other tables of two. We were greeted by a hot waiter which seemed to make the waiting we had done a little less painful. he asked us for our drink orders and brought them back to us. Then he took food orders and we ordered apps (potato skins 2 orders) and the rest of our food  nothing was weird or special about our orders  just ordered straight from the menu. The only thing they get 1 star for is having a nice  hot waiter and the fact that our potato skins came out right away and the fact that I can't give no stars or negative...i wish i could.we finished our potato skins and then a group of 14 ladies were seated next to us. the two couples near us had already gotten their food they ordered. still no food for us. waiting and waiting and waiting...finally a couple of dishes came out at 835pm. waited and waited and waited...nothing else. hmmm so we waited and waited and waited some more. a couple more dished trickled out at 845pm. got a manager involved. she apologized and said that she'd give us 50% off the entire bill. we were still waiting for one more dish. waited and waited and waited. by this time we had to get some of us home and so we said to give us boxes. the entire wait staff in the restaurant knew we were LEAVING....and what do they do  they bring the last dish on a plate when they had helped box the other stuff up. it was almost 9pm when that last dish came out....so they took it to get it boxed...15 mins passed  i was pissed. so i went to find the manager again...but the manager was apparently busy putting out other customer complaint fires (that's a red flag)...waited and waited and waited and FINALLY the last dish came. Opened the box to look at it and it seriously looked like someone threw up on my pizza. the toppings were everywhere and the crust was completely limp and soggy like it had been sitting there for 15 mins in the box before they decided to bring it out. so i took the pizza in to show the girl at the front. she took it to the manager and he came out 5 mins later. I said we're not paying for our bill period cause this evening has been absolutely unacceptable. he said he completely understood and that there were no words or excuses he would give me and he'd happily take care of the bill. the bill was for $120...too bad we didn't have drinks...that would have been better.so i ended up going to burger king on my way home and had a whopper jr for dinner at 10pm since my stomach was growling louder than my radio at this point. bottom line  never going back to the concord location ever again...not that i'm ever out there much anyway  we were just trying to accomodate a friend that lives out that way. and i suggest you don't go there either...one of the gals posted our adventure on FB and all of her friends were commenting on how they never go to that location because the service/kitchen staff sucks all the time.
jess r.,Santa Cruz  CA,0,21,1,11/4/2011,2.0,just waited over an hour and a half for food taxi. cobb salad a supreme disappointment. Even though I had the order read back twice  they failed to deliver blue cheese dressing. The seared ahi had a dressing that did nothing for it. The clam chowder was ok but lacking celery it fell short of making an impression. Only plus was not having to cook or go out with infant twins.
K V.,Brentwood  CA,24,8,1,11/4/2009,3.0,I like the rootbeer and jambalaya and the avocado rolls. Went there twice. Tuesday afternoon and Friday about 8pm. On both occasions they were out of calamari. Wait was very long on Friday  we were told the wait was 45 mins  ended up waiting more than an hour. I felt rushed leaving as our server interupted our conversation to ask if we needed boxes to go  considering we waited that long to be seated.
Katrina A.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,7,,9/19/2010,2.0,House brewed Beer = great! Food = boring flavorless and would be something I could make myself for FAR less money at home. I tried to order 3 different belgian beers and they we out of all 3! My pasta was under cooked and my chicken was overcooked. The meal itself was cold. Just not how I would like to spend $60 for my husband and I.
denise s.,Concord  CA,0,54,,8/30/2013,1.0,OK  I have been here 5 times but no more. I kept trying to give it another chance. service is crummyand food is always disappointing. went in last sunday to try brunch. one of my complaints is that after I am seated it takes at least 7 minutes for anyone to ask if I would like water!! with server after server passing me by and they aren't busy even! this last trip I was thinking about breakfast and asked my waitress how much coffee is as price was not on menu. She looks at me with a blank stare and says she doesnt know. OMG  really..you dont know the price of coffee. oh  and if I want to know she can check the computer. oh  yes..I would like to know I said as I might get tea instead. she left and did not return to almost 10 minutes. ok..now I have no water and cant find out the price of coffee. are you f'in kidding me. a different waitress passed by and I asked if she knows the price of coffee and she did! whoo hooo.. I explained my frustration and said I dont want to see that other waitress again. The new one took my order and was very sweet. Oh  but no  this isnt over. I said I want sourdough toast. She came back by once and said..now  you want sourdough toast  right? yes. Well  guess what...yep..they f'd up the toast. oh  also..I got something called an Italian baked omelet with italian sausage  and more. NEVER saw one bit of sausage and that omelet was soooo overdone it was like rubber. I asked for the manager who was very nice and said I would like a discount and he gave me meal for free. I explained my ongoing frustration with this restaurant. after 5 times of trying I will not be back... I can only give a place so many chances!
Brenda R.,Pleasant Hill  CA,0,30,,4/2/2010,5.0,My husband and I eat out once a week. We have tried several places in our area and have a few favorites. We are defiantly adding BJ's to our top 5 for casual dining. The service is incredible. If you take the time to watch the staff  you will see a well oiled machine working. Everyone pitches in where needed. Tonight  our waitress was extremely attentive and very friendly. She was a delight to talk to. She accidentally dropped a couple of glasses on the floor and the number of staff that came to her aid to help clean up was amazing. They even had someone standing watch over the mess to make sure customers didn't step in the ice and glass.Now for the food. I'm a fish taco snob. I try them everywhere  and I have say  their fish tacos are the best I've had in a long time! My husband had one of the hamburgers and he was very satisfied with his meal as well. Now the kicker. We had 2 beers  1 marg  two meals  great service  and a nice atmosphere for under $45.00!!!! We are used to spending $75.00 +++ for a great meal.You have to try this place! Just go early or call in for a reservation It is very popular.
Marie P.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,41,,11/17/2009,3.0,we tried to come here once before and peaced out because of the ridiculous wait  but we returned tonight and were pretty pleased...kinda like cheesecakke factory but a little more reasonably priced and although the menu is a bible here as well as @ cheesecake  it is not as overwhelming and doesnt offer as many heartattacks on a plate  so i GUESS its the better option? the food was pretty close to as good as cheesecake but like i said cheesecake has more original options which can be overwhelming but can also be interesting. @ bjs u wont really find anything youve never had before....we got potatoe skin platter  they were just perfect  not dry or overdone or skimpy on cheese and stuff..also split beef sliders good and average  not out of this world (oddly enough chilis is better) also split off the lighter side menu panko breaded halibut fish tacos which were very good and supposedly under 670 cal.... kinda hard to believe but ill take it... and only $7.50  pretty damn goodok so i really did like it and i will definatly go back i just dont feel it deserves a 4th star... it is too much like something else (cough cough * cheesecake factory) for me to be overly impressed and even tho prices are better its still not helping out americas obesity crisis thats for sure... but i would love for it to do well  and i think in these tough economic times its a great bang for ur buck!! next time you wanna pig out come here  youll like it  just dont expect a gormet meal across the boardp.s.* deep dish pizzas looked good  maybe bjs will earn their 4th star if i try them??
M A.,Concord  CA,0,3,,4/9/2012,2.0,Don't get excited and fooled by how modern this place is. Very clean  yes. Minus the pizza  much of the food seems similar to your basic chain brands (Chili's  Applebees  etc.) Service appeared to be slow on the day I wen't.
Jessica M.,Pleasant Hill  CA,22,78,4,8/24/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,food is ok  service is ok  watch out for the over waxed floors  it may be the death of you
yelper l.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,69,,5/28/2011,1.0,i went there to watch champions league soccer final. for 45 mins i was staring at the blank screen. spent 30$ for nothing. food was ok. but i went there for soccer. I should have stayed home and bought 15$ package for 1 month soccer. Thanks for enlightening me with the fact that Directv is unreliable. btw. so i went to roundtable and watched the second half
Sam K.,Martinez  CA,4,21,,6/21/2010,1.0,2 words folks..FOOD POISONING!. I used to really like this place but I went on 6/18 and got the pulled pork and holy smokes  belly not happy. As I walked up I remembered a coworker ate the chicken and got really sick when he called  the manager did say that a few people got really ill?!. But I thought  I'm not gonna eat chicken so no biggie. WRONG! Not cool.
Paola G.,Pleasant Hill  CA,88,18,2,5/20/2011,2.0,I can only speak for the Bar area  the service was horrible. Food was good but our server gave really bad service.
Naomi F.,Brentwood  CA,1,4,,9/29/2010,1.0,Terrible service...waited 15 minutes before flagging down a manger to tell them we have not even been greeted yet...food takes forever to get (almost 30 minutes). Have experienced this every time we go here...what is the hype about this place?
miriam l.,San Pablo  CA,0,2,,12/18/2011,1.0,Waited 30 minutes to be seated 35 minutes for the food & it was wrong! First & definitely the last time I'll ever go there. Waste of money!
Brick J.,Antioch  CA,1,1,,12/15/2009,5.0,Went here the other day and was very happy! We had to wait a while but it was cool because... you know the place is new AND its xmas time everywhere will have a year long wait! We were seated by a friendly hostess 'jessica' she told us about the handcrafted sodas YUM! And then another Jessica was our server... She knew her shit! She told us all about their beers and which ones she likes  which ones were the favs of customers and then we were able to sample some. She picked the hef  red  and some berry cider beer and we decided to try the pale ale- YUCK. She was right. It was like chomping on a leaf! haha. But the rest were great. We ended up with a pitcher of their Hef   We had never been to a BJs before so we needed time with the menu  and had questions. Jessica was patient and helped answer our Q's. which was cool because Im sure we were annoying. :) I decided on the grilled chicken pasta (its what the server recomended) and my friend got a pizza. Both were amazing! The food took a while... ummm.. so did the bar. But the place is new and PACKED. Everything came out right and it was all amazing. Concord has finally gotten a decent restaurant!!
Kara S.,Brentwood  CA,0,1,,12/13/2011,1.0,Lately  I have been having a lot of issues with slow service but this was by far the worst. My boyfriend and I got to BJ's at about 7 pm tonight and it was busy. I don't usually find that's a problem. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Once we were seated  we waited about 15 minutes for our server to come over and tell us he would be back in a minute(He did not introduce himself or anything). Ten minutes pass by and the manager comes by and asks if we had seen our server yet. She finds someone in the back to come over and take our order. We ordered everything at once(drinks  appetizer and main course) We got our drinks about 15 minutes after that in which our normal server dropped the drinks said his name was William then scuttled off. About 10-15 minutes later just my pizza came out. After the manager tried to fix it by bringing out our appetizer and telling her she would comp it  we left. Will never go to this place again.
Dave B.,Concord  CA,0,13,,12/6/2009,4.0,This place is good. Nice wait staff and servers. Their beer is really good.Try the 7 sampler...only $10.00.I had a classic burger that was charbroiled (tasty) and my wife had a turkey sando. Both were good and decent price.I will be going back for sure.
Chris D.,Martinez  CA,4,3,,8/15/2011,1.0,Just left bj's after a really bad experience. The hostess Samantha was very courteous and did her job well but after her this restaurant sucked we were seated and were not even acknowledged what so ever and sat there waiting as two other parties were seated after us and already were ordering drinks and appetizers. So needless to say we got up and left and made sure and let the service area know that their wait staff is not doing there job at all. I do not recommend this location at all and will not be returning.
Sony J.,Vallejo  CA,0,2,,10/27/2009,3.0,so I have been to the new BJ's twice first time great.... 2nd time not so much....first we order drinks sierra mist and club soda server comes back we are out or sierra mist i not having menu in hand ask what do you have similar he starts rambling root beers and lemonades then my husband orders a turkey burger and he goes to ring in comes back and asks if he meant garden burger or was there actually a turkey burger on menu bc he cant find turkey in the POS system  ummm shouldn't servers know their menus??? then we wait forever for our food the mgr had to get us refills cuz he saw us sitting on empty  then our server comes and asks if we have saved room for dessert mind you we hadn't even gotten our food yet! he says let me check on your food passes by us 3 times and never once said it will be right up sorry for wait nada...having said that i am giving a 3 star because i was very impressed the first time we were here which was opening day!
Catherine L.,Concord  CA,0,18,,5/17/2011,5.0,I LOVE this restaurant! The salads are wonderful. The potato skins were very good as well. My husband and daughter liked the pizza. I met some old classmates there and we stayed over 2 hours on a Sunday afternoon. From about 1 PM until after 3 PM. No one rushed us. We had long since finished our food. They kept the refills coming on the ice tea and never tried to get us to move on. I have been there several times now and still want to go back. Good food  great atmosphere.
Maria Y.,Vallejo  CA,0,1,,8/11/2013,1.0,We went there to have dinner yesterday. Worsed experience ever. Not only did we wait 10 minutes for the server to take our drink order but worsed yet 30 minutes to just get our drinks.when waiter took our drink order we thought that placing our food order also would expedite the process so we did. We waited  and waited....the server finalle shows up only to say that the salad we had ordered only came in a big size. She did not even notice that our drinks were not in the table so I told her which she responded that this was not her table but not ones did she aknowledge the fact that we had been waiting so long just for the drinks. She even Had the nerve to say it would take another two minutes to get our drinks never offered an apology .my question is were was the manager that is not looking over to make sure orders r taken on time And guest r serviced. Our food An hour to get to the table. Unbelievable. I get it it is a Saturday day night and the restaurants r bussy but to wait 30 minutes for drinks to arrive and an hour for food and waiter to not have sense of urgency it it completely of the parameters of customer service.
Elena T.,Dublin  CA,0,90,,4/9/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"I LOVE BJ\'s. I come here all the time and have been to this location close to 20 times. I love that no matter what I am in the mood for  it\'s probably on their menu and good. We always have great service  even when it\'s crowded. Until yesterday. So it\'s Easter Sunday. Our party of 6 gets there when the doors open at 10. We are the only party there. we sit down. our waitress with long black hair in 2 braids  takes our drink order (all sodas.) Just from that interaction  I had a bad feeling. She didn\'t seem all there or to know what she was doing or something. About 10 minutes go by and no one has drinks. A party of 2 has since come in. That\'s it...our party of 6 and the party of 2 in the entire restaurant. She was no where to be found. She finally comes back. one person ordered a regular soda  the rest are all diet. She stares at the platter of drinks and says ""Oh..usually i put 2 straws in the diet to tell it apart from regular but I guess I didn\'t  so we\'ll have to guess."" Then she realizes as she is setting them on the table that she put 2 straws in the regular. um..??? it\'s been like 5 minutes since you filled the glasses. She walks away-and SHOCKING-the regular soda is also a diet. REALLY? So 3 of us order from the breakfast menu (2 french toasts and a breakfast pizza) and 3 order from the regular lunch menu. so we wait. Finally 4 of our meals come out. The 3 lunch menu items and one order of french toast. so we all wait to start eating until everyone is served..and we wait...and there is no syrup or butter on the plate or table for the french toast either. Finally our oh so bright waitress shows up with the breakfast pizza and sees us all looking around and says \'whats the problem?"" Um..we still are short a plate and my dad asks for butter and syrup. ""Oh.."" she says. So she disappears into the kitchen and gets the other french toast. meanwhile-the rest of us have been waiting for all of us to be served  so now ALL of our food is cold. By this time  one other party of 4 is in the restaurant. So 12 customers in the restaurant...and this crappy of service? after she sets the last plate down  she says ""is there STILL a problem?"" My dad said ""I still don\'t have butter or syrup for my french toast."" She SIGHS and goes back to the kitchen like she is put out. Are you KIDDING? she brings back a syrup and butter for my dad that ordered french toast-but NOTHING for the other person that ordered the same thing. Who eats french toast without syrup and butter? That would just be warm bread! why doesn\'t it come on the plate instead of asking for it? By this time  we were all so irritated with the cold food and crappy service  that the person that got NO butter  just gave up and did without. NICE! We are very generous tippers  and I have to say  this was one of the rare times i didn\'t even want to leave a standard 20%. Our family Easter brunch was a total wash. we all left shaking our heads. Not sure if i will go back. if i do  and i am seated in her section  I will ask to be moved. And by the way  when we left  there were still only about 20 customers in the whole place. NO reason for the lack of service we received."
Sandra O.,Norwalk  CT,23,16,,3/25/2011,4.0,Good burgers  and salads. nice staff and clean inviting place.
Arthur T.,Concord  CA,0,44,1,12/18/2010,4.0,"Try the Irish Rootbeer! I always see these restaurants on the Food Network that have these great items that can\'t be obtained anywhere else except for that restaurant. Well I\'ve found that thing at BJ\'s. The Irish Rootbeer is fantastic. It\'s made with their homemade rootbeer and it will give you a nice buzz. I\'ve been to BJ\'s 3 times in the past 3 months. It is quickly becoming my favorite ""go-to"" spot when I want pretty good food with lots of options. My only complaint is that on Friday & Saturday nights you get the bar & club crowd which can be a little irritating. If you go during the day or on a weeknight you should be fine though."
Dino S.,Concord  CA,22,8,7,1/30/2010,2.0,The food was average  the beers were better. For a restaurant they do make pretty good pizza though. We have gone 3 times since they opened at this location and find the waiters/waitress were great  very friendly. However  we may stop going there because of a recent debacle with the restaurant manager. I caution you in advance if you plan to make reservations for large parties. We asked 3 times and 3 different hostess instructed us to call 24 hours in advance to make the reservations  however the manager argued with my wife that she could have made it days earlier. The afternoon manager on Jan.29th was a complete asshole. He needs to try to accommodate his patrons  but instead he was argumentative and rash on the phone. If I was there in person  I would like to see him talk to my wife or I like that. We are boycotting going there until he is removed from his position. We love going there  but do not respect the way management treats their customers. We are still waiting for his call back  his name was Mike.
Malena Y.,Berkeley  CA,8,8,,1/24/2011,3.0,"I went in to BJ\'s with my sister after shopping last Sunday afternoon. I was excited it was ""happy hour"" but really all that means is $1 off pints and a few dollars off appetizers. We sat at the bar and waited about seven minutes before the bartender acknowledged us. After tasting a couple beers  we both decided to try the Marin IPA (delicious) but none of the appetizers looked appealing. The prices were a little high - even with the small discount - and I didn\'t feel like eating fried food. I looked through the menu though  and found their ""small bites."" The mini tacos with spicy barbacoa beef were great  and really reasonably priced. They were a perfect snack. At first the service was shoddy  but then another bartender showed up who  after speaking with him for a minute  realized he is the same bartender that used to work at Stanford\'s restaurant in Walnut Creek. I believe his name is Jessy?? Anyway  he made our experience really enjoyable. The bar at BJ\'s is beautiful and Jessy is a great addition. I\'ll definitely go back after another shopping venture  but probably won\'t go out of my way to hit up their happy hour - it seems as though there are better deals all over the Bay."
Lori R.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,42,,4/24/2011,4.0,Yep I liked it. Two friends and I went last week  the meals we choose were Tai luttece wraps they were spicy sweet and yummy  one had the giant baked patato and the other had the shrimp pasta both were happy with their meals. I had the buscetta small bite it was cheap and tasty but even at the price not worth the $ it was four very tiny pieces of bread.
Steven O.,Los Angeles  CA,0,705,1,8/8/2010,4.0,Love the pizza and potato skins at BJ's...wish they had better wings.
Jo M.,Benicia  CA,2,2,,3/22/2011,2.0,Service was not bad. Only thing I did not like about it is that the floor is slippery. Didn't feel safe walking inside the restaurant.
Diane W.,STANFORD  CA,3,376,,10/21/2012,3.0,hawaii miah OK chicken OK shrimp thing was good
K T.,Concord  CA,0,2,,2/14/2011,2.0,Had lunch here with a friend  she had the shrimp tacos which she said were delicious. I had the Cobb salad which not only was the portion very small and had way too much dressing but the chicken was processed and cubed  not real. The service was very slow. We had to wait almost 15 minutes for our drinks  then our server never asked if we wanted refills  which we did. Other than the shrimp tacos  this was not a positive experience  won't be going back soon.
Laura A.,Martinez  CA,1,22,,9/6/2010,4.0,Avocado rolls are delicious. Balsamic chicken dish is very good. Mini Pizookie (warm chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream) a great hit with entire family. Service a little slow  staffed by young adults but ok overall. Called 1/2 hour before we got there to get on list and table was ready within 10 minutes of us arriving. Popular location.
Sasha V.,Oakland  CA,2,88,,11/2/2009\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I have been able to come here quite a few times now and over all the food has been really good. I have had the Cuban burger and the California grilled chicken sandwich recently and they were both good. One of the servers I had was Jason I think and he was an awesome server. Then I have had a few servers who were really good and some not very good at there jobs. I payed close attention to the bartenders lately and they are SO BAD AS BARTENDERS!!!!!!! I don't know if that is the way they are trained but WOW! They seem to be clueless on the most basic cocktails and then I saw a few of them making a drink that requires shaking and they don't add ice and barely even shake the drink. Plus they move slow and don't seem to have any confidence as bartenders. The beer itself has been inconsistent lately as well. There are times when lets say the Nutty Brunette is really good and then other times taste like dirty gym socks. I was able to try the sodas the other day and they are all good except for the cherry cola. And they are always out of the cream soda which is the best. This place is great but they need a lot of work and help to improve themselves. I know they are just your typical chain but even so they I haven't found myself liking them as much lately.
jjj z.,San Francisco  CA,0,56,,1/27/2010,4.0,Healthy portions of great tasting dishes win me over every time. My favorite dishes are the meatloaf sandwich for comfort food or the Italian salad for eating somewhat healthy.
Matt M.,Dublin  CA,6,121,13,12/16/2009,2.0,The hiatus is over!After a lengthy break from the world of Yelp  I am making my Ali like return to the ring...er web. Bj's...oh such high expectations going on. I love beer; I love the taste  the complexity of it it  the bitter aromas  everything. My better half went to the Newark Bj's with some friends a few weeks back and recommended I should try it out too due to my fondness of the suds. Long story short  we went to the Concord one instead on a busy Sunday night with some family. After a short wait which we were served snacks for waiting (very cool btw)  we were finally seated and I was ready for a beverage. After a few minutes  the waiter took our drink order  then came back and took our food order and then we waited...and waited......and waited some more....then finally got our drinks nearly 15 minutes after we ordered them (I had to ask the waiter if remembered). Then within five minutes  the worst scenario in eating out unfolded before our eyes....the near same time delivery of the appetizer and entree. Literally 3 minutes apart  no one at the table had even finished their salads yet before pizzas starting showing up on our table. Then to finish the scenario my poor 18monther's food was forgotten about and came about much later. What's strange is that similar to other yelpers  it too took our waiter nearly 10 mins to figure out the bill.2 stars for the good beer ( jeremiah red was excellent) but after that  I'll come back when the kinks are worked out.
mimi g.,Martinez  CA,0,8,,5/31/2010,2.0,If you dine in make sure you have alot of time on your hand. Service is slow. Takeout is not much better  whatever they quote the time your food will be ready just add atleast another 15 mins.
Mateo S.,Vacaville  CA,5,21,3,12/5/2009,2.0,The only reason they get 2 stars is because the Beer is Delicious and the food was good. Granted they only opened a month ago  the workers can't seem to get it together there. They all look puzzled. The place is WAY to small for a BJ's. The location in Vacaville is way bigger and better. Concord's only has one section for large parties so good luck on weekends if you have a large party. (we had a party of 8 and it took us 2 hours to be seated) When we finally got seated we had 2 different people wait on us (which I knew was bad news from the start) sure enough our order got all screwed up. One pizza came out before anything else so 2 people from our party were done eating before others even got their food. THEN to top of a wonderful evening we waited 45 mins for them to get our check right... they had to have the MANAGER come out and do the check cause the workers didn't know what they were doing with the computer i guess... Granted we did get 3 free pazookie desserts and $30 bucks in gift cards for the inconvenience.. all in all horrible restaurant expeirence  good food  great beer as always BUT!! if u have large parties (and 8's not even large) go to another location until this location can get the act together.
Maria R.,Benicia  CA,0,29,,4/4/2010,3.0,My hubbie and I went on Valentines day. Just now getting around to yelping. Food was ok. Plenty of tvs to watch  but they are a little too high for my neck and can't hear the volume. We sat near the back and noticed a lot of workers just standing around  which was sort of annoying since we were still waiting for our food. My Husband enjoyed his salmon and my salad was good.  Customer service was ok. Gave it another try several weeks ago  it was about the same. Appears to be a good place for a large group out for drinks and fun.
k o.,Martinez  CA,0,8,,3/14/2010,4.0,We were pleasantly surprised to find a well trained crew of waitstaff and bartenders to compliment a fine selection of beers and cocktails. The menu leans a little to the deep fried and overloaded plate audience  but we found some excellent flavorful choices like the Shrimp Taco and the Thai Shrimp wrap appetizer.
Ann S.,Concord  CA,0,24,,4/7/2010,3.0,I have been there three times in the past month. Their lunch menu cannot be beat when it comes to price. $6.95 for all you can eat salad and soup. It was nice the waiter kept asking me if I wanted a different soup or salad. Tonight I took my kids and we ate some appetizers from their little bite menu. The shrimp skewers for $3.95 was decent. It came with a few bites of veggies and rice. Perfect size to go with the yummy beer. I could just go there for beer. Service was a bit confusing and slow tonight  unlike the other day for lunch. The waitress looked tired. She did get a nice tip because she closed the tab quickly...I have to wonder if I was her last table!
anna i.,Concord  CA,0,2,,1/26/2010,4.0,I've been to BJ's a few time and haven't been disappointed yet! I'm a big fan of their spinach dip and deep dish pizzas. They have a tasty selection of house made beers also. Good food  good atmosphere  good service. Our server  Lindsey  was very attentive and friendly.
Hugh J.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,1,,1/19/2010,2.0,I arrived for my third visit since this location opened to meet a friend for dinner. Upon arriving I had to wait ten minutes for a drink. We were sitting at the bar. My friend had to ask for service for me. Neither one of the two bartenders noticed that I had arrived  and I had not been served. Monday night football had ended  and the restaraunt was not too busy. There were plenty of empty tables.  I intended to order food when I arrived. However the bartender that served me a BJ's Porter neglected to offer me a menu. Once I had finished my porter I was going to have a stout  and order dinner. After waiting over tfifteen minutes I finally became disgusted  and left.
Nicole D.,Martinez  CA,68,5,,1/5/2010,2.0,Worst service ever. Food was good  but I thought I would never leave! We sat down at our table and 15 minutes later they said that we were never assigned a waiter!
Melissa D.,Oceanside  CA,0,11,,11/4/2009,5.0,I went to BJ's for the first time last night  and the waitress we had I think made the experience 10 TIMES BETTER! I wish I could remember he name  but she was so nice and fun and actually cared about serving us. She said we weren't even her table but she saw that we had been sitting there for a while so came right over!!! I will go to this resteraunt as often as I can. The food is well piced  the beer is AWESOME  and other than some sloppy drunks hangin out at the bar  the atmosphere was perfect.
Alan V.,Hercules  CA,18,269,3,4/5/2011,3.0,the cheeseburger pizza could have had more cheese and burger  the scoop of ice cream over the cookie was good tho  spinach dip was just ok  i will come back and eat the same things
Lori M.,Albany  CA,10,5,2,9/12/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,went there again. service much faster. husband loved that he could see a t.v. no matter where he sat. food was good. would go again!
