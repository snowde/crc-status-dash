Jeff S.,Houston  TX,227,597,194,12/3/2017,4.0,Knowing that BJ's offers ample TV's and a lively atmosphere in their bar area  my wife and I visited twice during the World Series to cheer on our Astros with other local fans. We were thankful to snag a 4-seat high-top in the bar on both visits. With TV's positioned throughout the establishment  there was no shortage of good viewing angles.On both visits  the service was very good with everybody in the Astros frenzied spirit. During our first visit we enjoyed a variety of appetizers including buffalo wings and calamari.Our second visit was Halloween night - stay home and dole out treats or go out and cheer on the Astros? No dilemma here! On this night my wife enjoyed wings again (they were quite good first visit and she's been on a bit of a wings kick lately). I noticed that BJ's offers prime rib (a favorite of mine) but only on weekends. Bummer. So I opted for the ribeye steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was quite flavorful. We topped off our meal by sharing a chocolate chunk pizcookie topped with vanilla ice cream. Yum!BJ's offered drink specials during both games. We enjoyed both visits and agreed that venturing out to enjoy our favorite team is well worth the effort.
Kirbi S.,Houston  TX,16,114,26,12/3/2017,2.0,GNATS!!So many gnats at the bar. The bartender came up to take my order and disturbed the colony of gnats and they started swarming the entire bar area. It must be something that happens often because the bartender didn't flinch or even apologize. I've been to this location before but never the bar. The food was okay when I came in the past but I won't be eating here again.
Crystal C.,Houston  TX,143,131,183,11/25/2017,3.0,Decided to venture back to BJ's for a late lunch  early dinner today after a wonderful day of shopping and spending time with great friends. Since we have not frequented this location in over a year  it was nice to see the place was still an option in such a busy area. I'm a very friendly and outgoing person...in other words  I don't need a reason to be nice to ANYONE.My dining partner and I decided to sit at the bar. We often do this so we can chat and get great service/attention from attentive bartenders. NOT TODAY.I ordered a Bloody Mary at 2:45pm...our drinks came right away...we both ordered an appetizer & a main entree.There is no need to complain or provide any negative feedback about anything MEAL RELATED. THE FOOD WAS PHENOMENAL.  The SERVICE  however  was questionable. To be fair  only one person contributed to this lack of service. Hopefully  this review will shed a flicker of light on her unbecoming conduct  which was CLEARLY DIRECTED at my friend and me. Maybe she will take a moment to consider treating deserving and paying customers with a certain professional level of service despite her personal hangup. I tried to overlook her rude behavior  but  after she blatantly ignored us for over 25+ mins  I decided to simply enjoy my meal and not allow her to ruin my great mood.**Shift change**I was FINALLY offered a refill from the new bartender SINCE MY EFFORT TO GET HER ATTENTION FROM THE OPPOSITE END OF THE BAR WAS MOOT... #ThanksForNothing #NotEvenWater
Rex C.,Houston  TX,71,410,798,11/3/2017,2.0,Wish I could give a higher rating but the times we have eaten there and gotten food to go it was just average. ***MANAGERS**** DO NO PUT CELERY IN THE BOX WITH THE WINGS FOR TO ORDERS!!!! THE OTHER DAY I HAD SOME WINGS THAT TASTED LIKE CELERY BECAUSE OF THIS. ALSO ON THE RIBS DO NOT PUT THE COLE SLAW IN THE BOX LOOK HOW OURS LOOKED WHEN WE GOT HOME. THANKS the wings used to be really good. Now they are just average at best. The ribs are actually really good but the ones we got had hardly any meat. Lastly the deep dish pizza is alright. Maybe I'll go back and give them some more shots but as of right now this place is a 2 Star.Good is just average at best and the people cramming everything into one box for to go orders is super annoying. Thanks.
Art D.,Houston  TX,107,252,105,10/15/2017,4.0,This spot was cool We arrived about dinner time and was able to get a seat right away. Not much to say here. The service was good I had a burger and it was very good and my guest also had a burger which they said was good. I did not have to ask for any refills and was not rushed either. Overall good experience. When it comes to eye candy. I did see some candy in the bar area  it looks like there was some potential to find some sweets.
Jordyn W.,Cypress  TX,82,2,,12/3/2017,5.0,There pizookies are amazing! Every time I have gone to BJ's  I never have to ask for a refill. They bring the food out really fast! They have a lot of food and drinks on their menu so haven't been able to try everything but so far everything I have had has been cooked well and taste great!
Be S.,Jersey Village  TX,8,3,1,11/1/2017,1.0,Our food was lukewarm after they made the world tour of traveling all over the restaurant. The dude who was carrying the plates had no idea which table was the right table. I watched him stopping at three different tables  one by one  S T R I K EService was quite bad and we were less than thrilled. They were not even that busy. Bottom line: cold food + poor service = BJ Brewhouse
Kristin A.,Spring  TX,3,69,5,11/10/2017,2.0,"My wife and I went to BJ\'s today for the first time. She is a veteran and was going for the free entree offer for vets (up to $12.95 value). We opened the menu and were surprised to discover that despite the fact that my wife was supposed to get a free entree  we would still have to pay something for hers  because practically none of the entrees cost less than $13. The food was overpriced for glorified bar food at what is basically a gastropub. I think we saw two salads under that amount  and since she isn\'t a rabbit  she ordered a $13.75 burger. I ordered the supposedly deep dish ziti for $14.95. The food arrived after a long time  and we received another rude surprise: the small food quantities  particularly that of my pasta. I have never gotten so little pasta and paid so much for it. My ""deep dish"" ziti was only half full in a dish the width of a salad plate. I\'m a small woman with only a modest appetite  and the portion was so small I ate the whole thing! I have never ordered pasta at a restaurant and not brought home at least half of it. My wife ordered a buffalo brisket burger and the patty was small compared to the bun and the cheese was pretty skimpy as well. I will credit BJ\'s for friendly prompt service when we went (4PM on a Friday ) and the food was quite good. But it was still very overpriced and with the small portions  we won\'t be returning."
Darrell F.,Friendswood  TX,440,155,622,11/8/2017,5.0,The food was recommended by our server Tyesha. The food was served very fast  very tasty and didn't have to ask for anything . Top notch service and great food this time around
Erin P.,Houston  TX,26,70,47,12/11/2016,4.0,I have never had a bad meal at BJ's. They have many options to choose from on the menu and everyone should be able to find something to eat here. They used to have amazing pork chops  but they took them off the menu :( The deep dish pizza is amazing and so is the clam chowder! I'm not a drinker but they do have a full bar with everything from beer to cocktails. The restaurant is clean and comfortable and I generally enjoy my visit here.
Rina M.,Los Angeles  CA,57,63,57,10/5/2017,5.0,I came here for my bday lunch yesterday and received the best service from Stephanie! I think that's her name  curly hair with green tips and upbeat attitude . She was very attentive to our needs and when we had a slight issue with a salad having to much dressing  she took care of it right away even though we told her it didn't matter. As for the food i was vey pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I was craving spaghetti and meatballs and typically its just OK when i order it from restaurants that aren't Italian. The spaghetti here exceeded my expectations. The pasta was cooked perfectly aldente and the sauce was beautifully seasoned and thick enough to coat every pasta noodle perfectly! Definitely a thumbs up all the way around from service to food.
Tish P.,Houston  TX,891,404,1000,10/23/2016,3.0,Disclaimer: This review solely represents my experience with this business on one or more occasions. It is not my intent to encourage nor discourage anyone from patronizing this establishment but rather  to offer my opinion of the facts that occurred during my visit(s). I wouldn't pretend to be the biggest fan of the BJ's chain. I have visited this location a couple of times prior and it was ok. The time before last they served me burnt brussel sprouts with the sriracha sauce. I had this in the Katy location and loved them. Mad disappointed at this one.  This last time though  had a meal that's return worthy. The roasted salmon quinoa bowl gave me so much life! The fish was cooked just right  moist and flaky. I'm no stranger to quinoa but I had never actually tried it before. Delicious compliment with the tomatoes  mushrooms and asparagus. Ate the whole thing..scrapped the bowl...no shame in my game! I did get the dinner portion since I love salmon and its half the amount on the lunch. I've visited BJ's chain  easy 10 times between Katy  Pearland Willowbrook and tried different dishes each time considering how their menu is almost as extensive as Cheesecake Factory. Finally found my BJ's dish that I don't have to take a chance on...yeah!
Style W.,Katy  TX,0,8,2,9/23/2017,5.0,All I can say is the chicken wings appetizers were so damn good....season and cooked well.
Sylvia N.,Beaumont  TX,2,25,46,6/2/2017,3.0,I came here after being familiar with the BJ's location in Fort Collins  CO. I had dinner on a Wednesday night  I was surprised to see that this restaurant only had 3 stars but it was packed. Definitely a lot of people were dining here. Upon entering  the place had a slightly stinky smell to it.. maybe dirty mop water? Anyway  it didn't deter us from leaving yet lol.We ordered a chicken bacon ranch mini pizza  creamy mac n cheese couscous  Peruvian shrimp quinoa bowl  and honey crisp chicken salad. I was disappointed in the Mac and cheese. It was completely different than how I had it in Fort Collins and that was because it was crisply baked in the oven. It tasted just a bit under cooked. The quinoa bowl was mushy due to the tomatoes in the quinoa. The shrimp had good flavor though. The pizza was really good and the salad was good also. I also ordered the gluten free mini pizookie  so good. Hopefully I don't get salmonella because it was slightly under baked.. just slightly but was still good. I'm not sick yet so I think I'll be ok  haha.
Devon C.,New York  NY,156,147,102,4/14/2017,5.0,Had such a great time here today for lunch! Came in with my friend for lunch and a couple of beers....wow...Stephanie was a great server! Great service  great personality! We had a blast! Thank you  Stephanie for a truly fun afternoon! Xoxo
D S.,Waller  TX,19,17,8,9/10/2017,3.0,This place is always a fun atmosphere but last night it was disappointing when we opened up our silverware both mine and my friends and they had food stuck on it  our waiter Daniel which was awesome  immediately looked embarrassed and replaced it for us and apologized. the small things like this can ruin a place I suggest that the person that puts the silverware in the napkins please make sure and check I don't think you want your family to use dirty utensils because if a child would have gotten those silverware they would have just used it.
Ngoc K.,Houston  TX,122,50,64,1/16/2017,5.0,When in doubt go to BJs. I'm a regular here  got me a card and place in line all the time. Because I'm such a regular my points add up very quickly and I'm always looking to try new things on their menu. If you aren't a big alcohol drinker but don't want water  I recommend the raspberry tea. It come in a cup with a sugar rim. Love the sweetness of it  you can also ask for them to make it more sweet or less sweet since it's regular tea with raspberry syrup. Appetizers i recommend is the southwest rolls or if you are looking for simple you can't go wrong with the calamari or cheese sticks.My usuals are Atlantic salmon with extra butter sauce  clam chowder  or pasta. The salmon is amazing with the rice and butter sauce. It's a great compliment to the meal and is super filling. The clam chowder can be a bit salty  but it's still very yummy for a sick day. You can never go wrong with pasta. Some sides I like are the thin cut fries if you are looking to eat a burger. Mash potatoes are great as well  amazingly seasoned to compliment my taste buds. They're known for great dessert as well  so just give them a try if you are still hungry after the meal. Pazookis are as good as they are hyped. I recommend salted caramel.
Macy B.,Houston  TX,48,61,8,6/16/2017,1.0,"BJ\'s is one of those classic places where dining should be easy and relaxed and great service is expected  considering it\'s a chain with a good reputation. Tonight  however  defied all good impressions I once had on this restaurant. When we put our name down for a table we were told it\'d be a 15-20 minute wait. 25 minutes passed so I went to the counter to check on the status of the table. 3 people were behind the computer talking amongst themselves  obviously not caring if I heard because one of them said ""she\'s only been waiting 25 minutes"" (only??). Then I said we were told 15-20 minutes and the server argued back and said ""actually we told you 30-45 minutes and it\'s only been 25 minutes"". Good management is to never talk back to a customer and to make everyone feel welcome (neither happened). Finally  we get seated. The waiter made the whole experience so much worse for us. We were a party of 9 and he was constantly forgetting things  like to take someone\'s order at the other end of the table or to bring our drinks. We\'d ask for a fork or an extra plate and never get them  so we\'d have to share forks or seek another waiter to get plates. He brought out my fiance\'s meal before our appetizers  and before everyone else\'s meals/appetizer so it was awkward for him to eat alone.Then  he spilled water all over my fianc and cleaned it up so poorly that I had to take the towel from him and clean it myself. We heard a loud thump a few minutes later and it was our waiter who dropped all our pizookies on the ground!It\'s time for the check and we realize ours was very cheap  and we were thinking ""wow  he comped our meal for us!"" But no  he just accidentally placed them on someone else\'s tab. All in all it was a pretty disappointing night. I hope management reads this because I don\'t want anyone else to experience this kind of service again."
Anh L.,Houston  TX,537,666,1477,5/3/2016,1.0,Service here is always a hit-or-miss and so is the food. One day my dish would come out amazing and I would crave for it only to get something inedible  which is why I don't dine here anymore. I'd rather spend my money where the food and service is consistent. The last few times I went have all been really bad. The food is just not worth the price. Save your time and money and dine elsewhere.SHRIMP SCAMPI- shrimp tossed with delicate angel hair pasta in a light blend of olive oil  butter  garlic  lemon juice and roma tomatoes  topped with parmesan cheese  seasoned bread crumbs  and parsleyThe pasta is so soggy and clumped together that it was so hard to pick up pieces of it without the whole dish lifting into the air. It wasn't a light blend of olive oil.. more like drenched in oil  but ironically the pasta was bland and tasteless. I remember when it used to be so flavorful  but the past few times  it's been consistently bad and oily. The bread crumbs aren't even crispy. They soaked up the oil and so you'll be getting oil residue everywhere!What happened to the old BJ's? Food used to taste good around here. This is not cutting it.
Joshua A.,Cypress  TX,123,1,9,8/13/2017,1.0,I honestly went in here after a long day of work and I was looking to have a cold brew. But apparently due to the fact that I'm an illegal alien and the only reason I say this is because this was the only reason I gave them a Mexican passport and I was denied a drink. In other words I felt so discriminated I would never come back to this place ever horrible service.
Caron L.,Houston  TX,0,2,,8/8/2017,1.0,We tried eating here on a Tuesday night and was told by the greeter that it would be an hour wait. We had no problems waiting but after a two hour wait we still had no table. There were tables on the side but the Dinning Room Manager Richard Blosser insisted that since they had no waiter in that area he could not sit us there. We were waiting for a party that had eaten and were just sitting there talking for over an hour. This makes absolutely no sense  we decided to eat somewhere due to terrible service!!!! If you have a big party I would recommend choosing another establishment.
Abby R.,Spring  TX,24,47,262,9/28/2016,3.0,This place is always busy  so if you're coming for dinner  mentally prepare yourself for the wait. Because of the wait times I tend to gravitate towards the bar seating. I've had numerous items from their menu and overall the food is just okay. I haven't had anything blow me away yet.. except of course for their pizookies. If you're brave enough to dive into a chocolate induced diabetic coma order the triple chocolate pizookie. This thing is the bomb. If it weren't for their pizookies I probably would not frequent this place as often.
Tim Z.,Cleveland  OH,0,1,3,10/5/2017,4.0,"Great beers and fantastic food good specials. Would highly recommend...if the ""manager"" wouldn\'t have turned off a playoff baseball game in the 7th inning due to ""everyone asking to change the channel"" it was on one lonely TV while all others were on week 5 Thursday night football ( who cares )and South Carolina vs Louisville college football( really ). Oh and the 32"" TV in the corner on a hockey wrap up show. The servers were great and staff was very apologetic while ""manager"" hid in the back."
Justin P.,Houston  TX,0,10,3,7/14/2017,4.0,We had to wait for a little while  my food came out cold but they made the situation correct. so all in all good night.
Rich A.,Aliso Viejo  CA,0,1,,9/22/2017,2.0,Great service  food was decent  and everyone friendly.... 2 stars because my luggage (along with luggage from 3 other cars nearby) was stolen from BJ's parking lot in clear view of restaurant. My advice - Bring EVERYTHING you have in with you .... especially if you have a known rental car. Bummer to the end of a good trip and otherwise good experience!
Cecilia B.,Houston  TX,1,17,3,6/18/2017,3.0,We tried BJ's for the first time Friday evening. I ordered the potato skins for an appetizer  the broccoli/cheese soup in the bread bowl  and the prime rib and French fries for the main course. He had the spaghetti with meatballs. My potato skins were good  but they brought the soup out so soon after I really hardly had any; the same thing with the soup - although what I did have of the soup was delicious! My prime rib was very good and the fries were a perfect side. His spaghetti? Not so much....WHO PUTS JALAPEOS IN SPAGHETTI?? He was sick the remainder of the night...I also had the pazookie free dessert - monkey bread with ice cream. The monkey bread was to die for  but the ice cream tasted old.I would love to go back and try to eat there again  but I don't think he will be willing; with a few corrections (and no spaghetti)  I think it could work out much better than the first time...
Celeste M.,Houston  TX,137,121,112,8/31/2016,2.0,I ate here for the first time on Friday night with a friend... We waited a good 7 to 10 mins before someone came to take our drink orders than another 10 or so minutes to place our orders  when the place wasn't even busy.. But i looked over the menu for a while and couldn't find anything to order  I decided i wanted ribs i seen a order of ribs as a appetizer for $10 i asked the waitress how many ribs come with the appetizer she said 5 but i would do better getting a half of rack  so i took her word... My order came out and it was 6 small ribs and a order of hard fries.. So i ended up paying $18 for 6 ribs... My total bill $27.55 for one drink  6 ribs and fries...Our waitress kept getting lost came to our table maybe 3 times the whole night... I definitely feel like I got ripped off but with that being said I most likely won't be back just not worth it...
Leah G.,San Diego  CA,61,54,4,2/12/2017,1.0,"Since my 82 year old mom is not an active Yelper  I will act as her proxy. This is a long review  so be forewarned. My 82 year old mom and 7 of her 80+ year old friends from Sunday School decided to have their regular Sunday lunch at BJ\'s on 1960 today. She was happy to tell me how kind the young gentleman was that waited on them  but how upset she was at the end of the meal. The young waiter had allowed 4 of the elderly women to order off the children\'s menu. Either they asked  or he offered  but none the less  he allowed them to order from that list. Meal came  meal was enjoyed  and the bill came. The bill was delivered by Sarah  the manager. As she gave the bill to the women  she announced that from now on they could not come in there and order from the children\'s menu. She first announced it from one end of the table  and just in case they missed it  she proceeded to the other end and REannounced it again. Not only did the ladies hear it the first time  so did the other patrons in the crowded restaurant. (Some of which they knew from church)This not only embarrassed the ladies  but insulted them greatly. In front of a crowded restaurant on a Sunday afternoon  the ladies were horrified at the encounter.My mother  a STRONG Texas lady  was tempted to set Sarah straight  but trying to not add anymore anxiety to the event  held her tongue and left. She did  however  do what consumers of her generation do and fired off snail mail letters to the local restaurant and one to the CEO and CMO at the Huntington Beach  CA headquarters. (She may not use social media  but she does know how to Google!)So BJ\'s may not care about losing the business of 8 elderly women  but those women have kids and grandkids  with more discretionary income  that live all over the US. And for this San Diego Yelper  who lives down the street from BJ\'s and eats out about 20 times a month  I will not be going back unless my mom or I get a response on how this situation and future situations like this have been addressed. (May I suggest a customer service for Seniors training course!)In this age of the ""Graying of America""  consumer focused  hospitality businesses need to realize that our senior community cannot be treated like second class citizens. They have the money and the time to enjoy these amenities and will frequent those that are gracious to them. They are a loyal demographic and should be welcomed  not chastised. There are plenty of competitors of yours that offer seniors special deals or menus  the least you can do is be kind.And lastly BJ\'s I am borrowing this quote: ""Good Lord willing  you too will be a senior one day; whatever age that may be. And you too will want to be treated with patience  understanding and  most of all  respect."" I am sure that Greg Trojan  Kevin Mayer and Lon Ledwith will agree.UPDATED 2/13/17After the kind and thoughtful reply from BJ\'s Management (which came Sunday evening  I was impressed) I am hopeful that BJ\'s is taking this situation seriously and will do all they can to resolve the customer service situation quickly and professionally.Thank you BJ\'s  I hope after some follow up  I will be able to be back and positively reviewing your food and nothing negative!"
Rena G.,Houston  TX,203,166,266,8/29/2016,3.0,"This past Saturday we made the drive over to 1960 to celebrate a birthday and tried BJ\'s Brewhouse for the first time...long story short  we were not blown away. Like all restaurants on Saturday  the place was packed and we had a party of 7 meeting. Three of our family members were already there when we walked in and were waiting. The hostess told us that they could not sit us until the whole party showed up  no big deal since I\'m familiar with other places that have this policy. Then another snooty waiter guy told me that they could sit us if half of our party was there. Um  there were 5 people there out of 7! and they still did not seat us. (And yet larger parties than us were seated before we were  even though their entire party wasn\'t there-we noticed more people arriving after they were seated) I did not want to get upset since it was a special occasion  so when that snarky waiter guy told us that and yet still did not seat us even though more than half of the party was there  I was just like ""Jesus  take the wheel!!"" We were just waiting on 2 others which were a few minutes away. Finally  our remaining party guests showed up and then a good 10 minutes later  they finally sat us down. Not a good first impression already. When we were finally seated  the evening seemed to be turning up. Our waitress was really nice and on top of her game  and brought out our drinks super fast. I noticed that they have a large menu with typical items that you\'d find in other chain restaurants  ribs  burgers  salads  pizzas  etc. During this visit  I wasn\'t feeling a beer  so I opted for a strawberry mojito  which for almost $10  was not strong at all. For our entrees  I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos $9.95 (comes with mixed grains bowl) the bf ordered the mushroom burger with french fries. The rest of the family ordered  a southern fried chicken plate  vegetable penne  New Orleans Jambalaya and the Parmesan crusted chicken. To be fair  my food was good  no complaints and the other dishes at the table looked very tasty but to me  the food wasn\'t OHMYGODTHISISSOGOOD!! It was just ok. Nothing that will make me drive all the way back. Some of our family members ordered a few of their brewed beers and they all said they were really good but I did not try them during my visit. At the end of our meal  they were accommodating and brought out a special dessert that were ordered discreetly for the birthday boy. As I mentioned  our waitress was a doll. For the life of me  I can\'t remember her name but she was awesome  stayed on top of our drinks and checked up on us regularly.For me and the bf  our total was $59 (excluding tip for our awesome waitress) but to me  that\'s overpriced for 2 entrees a few drinks and one birthday dessert. Not worth it to me. Overall  I can say that I\'ve tried BJ\'s Brewhouse but it\'s not somewhere that I can see myself making the drive to try again."
Kat R.,Houston  TX,22,285,36,3/2/2017,2.0,We've been here a few times late at night and usually because it's kinda a last resort lol Food has been ok service isn't consistent at all BJs in the west coast for some reason is better than here in Texas. I think we're done
Emma M.,San Diego  CA,6,13,5,8/1/2017,1.0,"Was extremely disappointed with the terrible customer service that I received when trying to make a reservation at this BJs for my birthday dinner. When I called  a gentleman told me that they could not make a reservation because they have to be made 24 hrs in advance (I called at 2/3pm). Knowing you have a possible 8-9 people coming for dinner  you would think they would be more accommodating and make an exception since a party this size means a solid bill. When I asked the gentleman for more help  he put me on hold to ""talk to his manager""  came back and said that they could only do a call ahead for us. He stated the call ahead wouldn\'t guarantee us a table. I declined the offer and took my business elsewhere to another restaurant that was much more accommodating. Too bad BJs  you missed out on a nice bill."
Tom G.,Spring  TX,24,18,,5/29/2017,4.0,I wish it were a little cheaper because the food is good...but not THAT good  and I do love their beers (but not sure I love them at $8 per bottle). The menu's pretty expansive so you're pretty sure to find something for everyone and then you get a pizookie and you could just die of joy. A little cheaper and it'd be 5 stars and I'd go often.
Jahlik B.,Hockley  TX,0,6,,7/20/2017,1.0,My co-workers went ordered from BJ's last week. The food smelled so good I knew I had to try it. We decided to have them deliver to the office today for lunch. I ordered chicken Alfredo with broccoli. My first issue with the website is that it kept requesting we change out delivery time. We waited an hour and a half for a delivery from a place that is 3 miles aways. I received my food and my chicken Alfredo was missing the most important ingredient. There is no sauce on my pasta. None at all. It did come on side. It was not in another bag. How am I supposed to eat The pasta without any sauce. This was very disappointing. I don't plan to ever try this Bj's again. What a waste.
Kathleen R.,Tomball  TX,14,113,295,3/16/2017,4.0,I have been here at least five times. Sometimes it's crazy busy and sometimes we get a nice quiet dining experience. All of our servers have been fantastic  but there is one hostess that bears this attitude that she either doesn't want to be bothered or seating folks is inconvenient. Here lies the minus one star rating for FOH service or lack thereof. If really busy the hostesses will text you when your table is ready. You can also join a rewards program  ask your server for details! Despite that unfortunate hostess greeting  I think the food is pretty fantastic. The Wednesday Burger Special ($10  any burger) is completely worth it. I ordered mine medium and it came out perfect and pink! Fries are double fried and crispy  not greasy. The chicken lettuce wraps are a great appetizer or nice for a light meal. If you like beer  there's a plethora on tap and you can get a flight (4-sampler) for under $10. I really liked the Tatonka (dark beer). There's a large menu with something for everyone and it feels more upscale than some of the surrounding eateries. My only other frustration is the narrow parking. We ARE in Texas folks! I would definitely recommend a visit. Be aware this is a brewery so evenings may be louder and busier  especially during game nights  as there are TVs surrounding the dining room.
Krystle J.,Houston  TX,16,20,7,5/25/2017,5.0,Always great food and great service. I love having membership rewards  it's great to save money or get some free food! Menu is always changing so there is always something new to try too!
KC V.,The Woodlands  TX,48,24,14,7/21/2017,4.0,I've always found BJ's to be a great place to eat. My family always enjoys eating here. We've always had great customer service and the beer selection is wonderful. I always get the California Club flatbread and it's been amazing every time. The pizookies are a must at BJ's! Chocolate Chip is by far my favorite.
Bill L.,Oak Lawn  IL,0,32,,8/10/2017,4.0,I read other reviews and was surprised over the long wait and bad service comments. I have been to many BJ's in Texas and california. Never had a long wait or bad service. Maybe because we never had a party larger than 6. Sit at the bar or in the bar area and the service is great. Good but not outstanding food. Better than usual fare for a chain  very decent brews of their own along with guest beers. I like the nutty brunette and the stout. They had one of my favorite beers as a guest beer. Rogue dead guy ale.We shared appetizers  avacado egg rolls were delicious and filling. The roasted Brussel sprouts with sriracha sauce are outstanding and healthy. The calamari was a bit over cooked. Salmon tacos exceeded my expectations. Very consistent no matter the location. Good value for the money 
Mark K.,Houston  TX,26,123,13,6/5/2016,4.0,I love this place. The Brewhouse tavern pizza has that thin crispy crust I like on a pizza.My other favorite is the parmesan crusted chicken with garlic mashed potatoes Yummy. They have an interesting selection of appetizers of which my favorite is the asparagus. Of course this is BJ's so they have good beers and sessional selections.Now for the best..... Desert  Baked Beignet!!!!!!!Service has never been bad and on the occasion where there was a mistake on the order the manager and waiter took care of it and did not charge for it.
Renee G.,Houston  TX,60,5,,1/11/2017,3.0,"The food was GREAT! But this not the place if your on an hour lunch break!! Plenty of tables available but they weren\'t sitting people because ""the waiters needed to catch up"" we were only a party of 3. The food took a while to come out & they took forever to bring us our check. The waiter was very polite & apologetic but the problem is we only had an hour. Definitely will try again when not pressed for time."
Deep S.,Houston  TX,1,52,9,7/23/2017,4.0,Decent food  a good place for big parties. The menu has variety of food so people can choose what they like instead of being confined to a certain cuisine. Pazookie is a must try dessert  warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream  we get it every time. The appetizers avacado egg rolls and calamari are really good. My husband likes to get the deep dish pizza  and I like to always go for their featured dish. I'm glad they have new things on the menu every time I go.
British C.,Houston  TX,40,10,5,7/28/2017,3.0,Our waitress used a tablet to take our orders  but some of the choices on the menu weren't available for selection on the tablet. The food was good  but our waitress forgot to put in the order for our appetizer(fried calamari) as well as an order of fries. We asked her about them once our main meals came  & she said she was sorry for forgetting  & offered a free dessert  but we declined. BJ's is a good restaurant  our waitress  I feel was just having a bad day.
Phillip B.,Houston  TX,1,3,2,3/12/2017,5.0,Very good pizza and the drinks are great but by the looks of other orders you really can't miss I would recommend to any and everyone.
Benjamin P.,Northern Point  Tomball  TX,34,2,,7/25/2017,5.0,Came in after a long day at work. Alyssa was super friendly and knowledgeable about the specials. Her positive attitude and attentive service made it the best part of my day. A 10 out of 10. I will ask to be seated in her section on my next visit
Mercedy M.,Houston  TX,183,79,115,5/21/2017,4.0,I like their salmon dishes and drink menu. Good variety of food and great service every time!
Margaret R.,Houston  TX,21,9,,7/21/2017,4.0,the food is always lovely . I love the santafe salad . Yesterday had a chicken dish on rice it was great . the only problem I ordered directly from their site but the food was delivered by door dash. both times the drivers got lost   so our food was cold . Will still get my santa fe salad fix from them. Hope they will address their relationship with door dash
Natalie P.,Houston  TX,1,4,2,8/21/2017,1.0,I love bjs restaurants since I'm originally from Cali and have been going to them for some time. My boyfriend  daughter and I came one evening after work our waitress was a large African American lady I believe her name was Melissa I could be wrong. She was rude and very dry with us my daughter who is 2 went 15 minutes before getting a refill we watched our waitress go to other tables multiple times before coming back to ours! We noticed all those other tables were nothing but white people. My boyfriend is black I know that sounds weird since she's black herself but my boyfriend said she probably thinks we're ghetto and not going to tip that's why she's acting like that. Not only was customer service horrible my boyfriends burger was salty as ever I took a bite of it and it tasted like I just ate pure salt!!! Gave my boyfriend a headache actually! It was a real let down coming to this location just sad our waitress was horrible my boyfriend and I are amazing tippers normally $20! But we left her $1 instead yes $1! I called management after we left and he said he would speak with her I truly hope he did I would hate for any other family to be treated how we did!
Jose A.,Houston  TX,116,1,,8/13/2017,1.0,This this place was beyond rude I came in with a group of 9 friends and we were treated so rude one of our friends came in from out of town from Mexico he provided he's passport and was denied an alcoholic drink he's well over the legal drinking age he felt so embarrassed our waiter was so rude he rolled he's eyes and said you should have an American ID not this we tried to speak to the manager but was told he wasn't there at the time definitely never coming here again I
Carmela S.,New Orleans  LA,818,1042,3462,8/25/2016,3.0,We took a break from sitting by our friends bedside at the nearby hospital to grab a bite to eat. We requested a large booth for the three of us and the hostess happily filled our request.Let's be honest  we didn't come for the food  we came for the on tap root beer. There's something about that on tap root beer that makes life feel ok. We ordered and waited for our food to arrive.I got the boneless wings with buffalo sauce and bleu cheese and I also ordered the italian market salad. Our entrees came out and I let the server know that we never received our salads. She came back with them in a few seconds and I was a bit disappointed because I was then overwhelmed by food. I dug into the salad and it was limp  soggy and really lackluster at best. What happened I think is they were made and sat back there with the dressing on them until she brought them out at least 15 minutes after they were made; judging by the sogginess level. The bonesless wings were just ok but  the bleu cheese dressing was phenomenal. The wings were only half coated in sauce and really looked like tiny chicken nuggets. Also  the portion size was at least a pound which I find unnecessary.To me BJ's isn't really a place you plan to go to just like you don't plan to end up at Applebee's but  if you need something quick and it's right there then you go.
Adolfo A.,Houston  TX,31,2,,7/28/2017,1.0,I came here frequently with my fiance for their burger  steaks  and especially beers (my personal favorite is the Jeremiah Red). Today I decided to make another visit to the restaurant and had my usual medium rare ribeye which was very good. It wasn't until I started eating the mashed potatoes that I all of a sudden projectile vomited the potatoes and only the potatoes onto my plate  I was lucky to be able to conceal it under my napkin for the sake of the customers  however. This may be TMI but the potatoes had a very distinct rotten milk smell when it came out and I did not have any dairy product today either. I brought this to the attention of the waiter (he was still tipped very well for his service  for he was very friendly) who notified the manager who seemed to put the blame on food poisoning from something I had eaten earlier today and didn't have the decency to check on me personally. I did not feel well after and did not have energy to argue for any sort of compensation  rather I choose to never bring my business there again. I always order huge meals and tip VERY generously. Stay away from the potatoes!
Chris G.,Houston  TX,0,9,3,1/31/2017,2.0,What a mess.Made reservations for 15. Arrived and they had a table for 12. They said we called and changed the number. We didn't. 5.95 beers...ugh but BJs is not a good drink place. Knew that already.  Food usual fair  meh
Jae S.,Houston  TX,131,250,569,3/13/2016,4.0,Pizza night with boyfriend! I love it here! Our wait time was 5 minutes on a Saturday night! Our server Brianna was awesome! She was attentive  nice  and friendly. I really appreciated that she was so patient with us. They have a shareable appetizers  small bites  dips  soup  salad  pizza  burgers  tacos  pasta  special entrees  kids menu  desserts  BJs handcrafted beers  and much more! We started with his favorite BJs handcrafter root beer. He loves it. Then we got the Spinach & Artichoke Dip. It's super cheesy and creamy. The chips are thin and crispy. It breaks easily when we try to pick up the dip. Then we ordered the small deep pizza (6 pieces). We got BJ's Favorite without the green bell peppers. It's the perfect size for us. Sometimes we order a Medium size if we want to take some home. I also love their Margherita Fresca Flatbread Pizza. This appetizer I don't like to share. I also tried to make this at home and failed miserably.
Lina D.,Yucca Valley  CA,1,32,12,5/23/2017,1.0,Worse experience ever. Ordered wings as an appetizer and my son ordered a hamburger and I asked for an ahi tuna salad ($15). The appetizer came right away and a minute later our food came in also. No time to finish our appetizer. Then my salad  I had 6 very thin slices of ahi tuna and two little scoops of avocado!!!! For $15 is way too expensive!!! I refused to pay so much for a low quality salad. My son finishes his food and the manager came  it took him too long to come over and fix the problem. Linch hour wasted and no food for me!!!
Tamika J.,Houston  TX,114,47,43,3/25/2017,1.0,Only because we have to leave one star. They are at a zero in my opinion. I waited pass the curbside promised time! Then went in b/c of the wait  my order was messed up! So much for giving them another chance after several times of horrible service. This is my first time and last  after at least a year since service was just a nightmare!
Demietria J.,Houston  TX,0,18,,7/18/2017,1.0,I was here last Friday to celebrate my best friend's birthday. There were 15 of us and we were told the wait would be an hour. An hour came and went but we still had not been seated. My friend asked the hostess what was going on and he informed her that they were waiting on a table to leave who had already been there 4 hours. Clearly making more money was not important because we had watched that table close out their bills a while ago. It took for my best friend to go back up to the hostess counter and complain for us to finally be seated. It took a while to order and the food to come. Once it did the food was not hot  just warm. I was willing to overlook all of this until my boyfriend got hit it he back with a tray by one of the waitresses. It wasn't even the one who was serving us. She asked if he was okay and apologized and left. He had a huge wet spot on his shirt from the tray. I don't understand how she hit him especially when he was leaned forward. No one ever came back by to check on him it make sure he was fine. We were still waiting on our desert at this point. The service we had on a night where we should have been celebrating was horrible. I'm not sure if I'll be back.
Darlynne S.,Houston  TX,49,8,3,3/24/2017,4.0,We love this place! The pizzas are always on point! Had Mom's birthday dinner here tonight and received great service. Ask for Rachel!!!!
Alicia H.,Houston  TX,73,24,22,12/22/2016,5.0,Friendly servers  food came out fast and hot. The bar area was really clean and well kept.
Denise C.,Almeada Heights  TX,234,5,,1/28/2017,1.0,I've never left an establishment more upset than I did tonight. Our waiter accidentally spilled a container of soy sauce all over myself  my purse  my phone  and my leather jacket. He apologized and brought us towels to mop up the sauce ourselves all over the booth. If it wasn't bad enough I had to soak up the sauce myself from our table and my belongings  it took the manager over 10 minutes to come by. He was very unsympathetic and offered to buy the plate the soy sauce was spilled from then walked away. I was left with my pants soaking wet and feeling irrelevant. With people like the manager Alex running this establishment  I will never return. I understand accidents happen yet a simple apology goes a long way especially when my property was damaged.
Danny L.,Houston  TX,187,512,3883,4/1/2015,4.0,I'm not sure why this place has such bad reviews. Maybe they are under new management because my last visit here was good compared to the other ratings. I ordered the half sandwich combo with fries and a salad for $9.80 after tax and tip. For the sandwich  I got the California chicken club which was actually pretty good because of the buttery toasted bread and avocado. My question is  what do they do with the other half of the sandwich??? The fries were plentiful and crispy  and the salad was a nice contrast from the artery clogging fries.Service was friendly and food arrived on a decent time. This place isn't too shabby for a restaurant chain.
Kenya R.,Houston  TX,173,140,203,1/2/2017,4.0,My first time here and it wasn't a bad experience. It was your normal American chain restaurant so it wasn't that spectacular to me. Since I am still new to Houston I've been trying to try places I haven't been before and this was one of them. The menu was very typical so I just kept it simple when ordering. We ordered boneless wings  Brussel sprouts  and has traditional wings as well. Everything was good  but as I stated it wasn't anything too spectacular The server we had was very attentive and she didn't continue harassing us like some of the restaurants do. She met our needs and even provided us with a complimentary dessert. We had a child with us  and sometimes children take a long time to decide what it is that they want  but she was very patient. The restaurant was very clean and the atmosphere was welcoming. There were more families here than I would have expected. I didn't get a chance to order a mix drink  I think I was over drinking from the prior day activities lol  but this will definitely be a place I wouldn't mind going back to for a quick bite to eat.
Martell H.,La Puente  CA,78,28,18,5/25/2017,4.0,Pretty good atmosphere our waiter was very patient and there were 10 of us. Food was good and the pizookie at the end just topped it off.
Brissa M.,Houston  TX,0,6,,9/6/2017,3.0,the best strawberry lemonade ever but the service could of been better. also our appetizers were never brought so we asked to have them off our check  secondly our salads were brought almost at the same time as our entrees.
Cristhian G.,Houston  TX,0,13,,5/20/2017,5.0,I don't know who cooked and prepared the hickory BBQ burger today 5/20/17 at approximately 9:20 but that individual deserves a raise!! It was absolutely PERFECT. The sweet Potato fries and new fresh cut fries were a great addition. I am already Super satisfied and still haven't gotten that Oreo pizookie (the best dessert known to man kind)
Marlon S.,Houston  TX,18,33,45,3/22/2016,4.0,Had the deep dish pizza. It was very filling and had great flavor.The staff was great and the service matched. A nice place for a late night meal and seems like a nice bar to watch a game or a fight. I would definitely visit again.
Mihalis R.,Wiesbaden  Germany,25,67,144,4/8/2016,4.0,Nice food service was okay Nice restaurant ambient Many different bier Would go again
Linh H.,Houston  TX,1,5,131,2/17/2017,5.0,Enjoyed the Cobb salad and pizza.  Waitstaff friendly and checked on us several times
Stephanie C.,Houston  TX,0,25,,3/3/2017,1.0,The service is always good here  but MAN the food is blan. The pizza and Pazookies are good but that's it. Don't have the burgers  the ahi tuna salad  spaghetti  or anything else. I've given this place so many chances cause I live close by but sadly  it's always a disappointment. Sorry!
Kenny H.,Houston  TX,6,15,,1/2/2017,1.0,Horrible wait for mediocre food? I'll pass. This place doesn't even deserve to be busy as much as it is.
Michael S.,Spring  TX,55,2,,2/10/2017,2.0,Very disappointing.  Food warm  not hot  not tasty. Staff looking very unprofessional.  Standards?? Not here...anything goes...including my business.
Hannah F.,Houston  TX,1,23,5,2/9/2017,4.0,I came w/ my bff and we had a coupon for a free pizookie!!! shit was tight! good service  good food  great dessert! definitely recommend lemon thyme chicken!!
Kevin T.,Westminster  CO,2,436,12,1/23/2017,5.0,I got a to go order. The staff was helpful and friendly the food was ready when it was supposed to be. the food was very good
Matt R.,New Orleans  LA,520,509,281,10/10/2014,4.0,BJ's is your typical sports bar. A huge menu with a thousand lunch and dinner options  TV's everywhere  lots of beer  and a boisterous crowd. We stop in at this location a lot for business lunches and rarely have a negative experience. On my last visit  I had Parmesan crusted chicken  steamed broccoli and cheese infused mashed potatoes  all of which hit the spot. The server was great  and very attentive... the only issues we ran into had to do with food prep... my sister is a vegetarian  which she stated at the onset  yet her wedge salad contained bacon bits and had to be sent back  and the sauce she asked to be placed on the side for her sandwich  was not. Minor griping really... not enough to sour our opinion. BOTTOM LINE: A solid sports bar on 1960. Great place for a beer and some finger foods or a lunch break from the office.
Lucy L.,Houston  TX,0,5,,2/3/2017,5.0,Lemon-thyme chicken was amazing. It's always nice when you can find something healthy that tastes fantastic. Ask for Stephanie! She's friendly  knowledgeable  and funny!
Nikhil S.,Houston  TX,64,11,7,9/2/2015,4.0,Ambience: lively  Nice place! Service: Not as crowded as other locations. Not sure during game time.Pretty good service. Food: Pizzas are amazing! Tried the chicken potstickers; watermelon and feta cheese salad - pretty cool! Beer: Defn try BJ brewery beers!
Sunnysuraj P.,Houston  TX,22,7,9,11/18/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"Been here a few more times now and my mind\'s changed a little bit. I don\'t wanna be too harsh  but a few points stand out to me:The food isn\'t always warm. Side dishes such as roasted asparagus and mashed potatoes  and even main dishes such as the chicken or mahi-mahi tend to be room temperature when they arrive. Dishes which are not are usually things like pizza or soups. My asparagus was also not crunchy but really soggy. I\'d be okay if it was a rare occurrence but I\'ve come here a few times during dinner and this seems to be rather common. The appetizers are great  and usually more reliably ""fresh"" -- but the main courses tend to be lukewarm at best.Refills on drinks are alright; they\'re not the speediest but I\'m not crunching ice until the end of my meal. I get that this place is busy  though  so I\'m not too bothered by that. They do pretty well considering that  but it could definitely be a lot better. Service is otherwise incredibly friendly. They definitely seem attentive and do well checking up. What I love about this place is the spinach artichoke dip and their famous pizookies. They have a lot of great dishes  the quality of their prep could just use a little work."
Natasha A.,Magnolia  TX,17,38,8,11/6/2016,2.0,Bought two appetizers and two drinks and walked out paying $60. The drinks were watered completely down and tasted horrible and service was slow. I don't think I will be coming back here again.
Thu D.,Houston  TX,114,59,66,9/23/2016,1.0,We came in at 9pm and it was not busy. We had 8 people and they told us it was a 45 minute wait. But they kept seating people that came after us. I think it was because we were wearing workout clothes. Horrible customer service.
Ronal A.,RICHMOND HILL  NY,62,2,,6/11/2017,5.0,Been coming here for a while now ! Love the service here and the food always comes out tasty! Best place to celebrate a special occasion!
Ashley Y.,Houston  TX,104,426,478,5/21/2014,3.0,BJ is always one of my favorite restaurant and I have never been to this location before.I came here on a Saturday for lunch. I found the mahi mahi from the menu and it looked so good. Well. It came with scallop too. The scallop were pretty good still. The mahi mahi is a lit too dry.( Even tho it suppose taste dry but it is too dry) I did not bother to finish it. I also ordered ahi tuna for appetizer which was not bad. Overall I still like this restaurant in all the locations I have been so far. I guess next time I will still try not to order sea food there.
Tony W.,Houston  TX,417,12,9,11/6/2016,5.0,Food was really good service was great our server got triple sat and she still handle her business
Kori Y.,Grand Rapids  MI,48,362,31,6/14/2014,4.0,Great brewhouse.Had a great choice of beers. And better yet they had a beer flight so you could sample a varity.The Pizza was very good  and what goes better with good beer other than good pizza.I'll be back!
Mindy C.,Houston  TX,5,68,72,4/1/2016,3.0,Pretty standard place. Nothing great but it's decent. Had the veggie flatbread and it was good. Taste as it sounds nothin special. Friend had a regular cheese burger. Again basic cheese burger nothin special. Fries were good though.
Warren C.,Austin  TX,1155,99,1064,12/22/2015,1.0,Lipstick on coffee mug  second one the coffee mug was stuck to the napkin. Server mentioned coffee comes in a bladder type pouch (probably not the most appetizing thing you wanna hear) management really doesn't care - was looking over me as i talked - the last reviewer most likely had a pleasant lunch experience by himself - if it's busy at alllllllllllll - good luck- the staff doesn't have it together.
Tele 1.,Cypress  TX,13,28,7,6/29/2015,5.0,My family and I loved this place without question! Our waiter Juan was truly fantastic. He was very friendly attentive and very knowledgable of the menu. For an appetizer we ordered the avocado egg rolls. I don't like avocados but this was pretty good. It has cream cheese stuffed in there somewhere. The menu is like a book. So many choices!! Between the three of us we ordered BJ's Classic deep dish pizza  Chicken Alfredo  and wings. I enjoyed everything. We most certainly will return to try much more.
Tana L.,Nederland  TX,0,67,18,12/5/2016,4.0,Great waitstaff and cheerful atmosphere. Not impressed with the margaritas but the beer selection is impeccable! Had Mediterranean pan pizza and OMG!!! Awesome!!! Also enjoyed the crispy artichokes!
Ryan T.,Houston  TX,162,220,234,5/17/2015,4.0,BJ's is the spot where we like to run to for late night bites. My friends and I don't come here to often  but it sure suits our appetite! The pizza selection and their own root beer is what attracts me here. Oh  and their avocado egg rolls! These are must have items when dining in. You can't compare their pizza to any other kitchen. They have buffalo chicken  sweet pig  and many more types that make me eat to where I smile with happiness. The food always tastes great. One time  the avocado egg rolls didn't look too presentable and it was probably missing something  but it still tasted delicious. Sometimes I eat so much I forget about desert. If you have room for desert  definitely add a pazookie into your tab. You will probably regret it later after you leave  but it's so damn delicious! The service here is okay. I think the night crew is slacking a bit  but at the same time I can see how the size of the crowd here can take up their attention. I see they have some specials that they put out on their stand up displays. This chain also has discounts and offers via email. I gave out my recommendations so if you could do the same  that would be great!
Mel S.,Riverside  CA,48,61,77,9/18/2016,3.0,No matter where you are BJ's food is always good and doesn't change. Order the salad  the pizza...doesn't matter it's all the same. Good food  good place. Unless u have a bad waitress.
Duyen N.,Katy  TX,0,14,13,12/13/2015,1.0,Started off pretty well. Came in was seated right away  waiter came right away for drink order. Food came out good  and that's about where it stopped.Waiter explained he was ending his shift and asked if we wanted to be transferred or to close out. So we wanted to be nice and close out. He assured us the 'girl' that would be filling in after him would check in on us. Me and my husband with a pizza and only one glass of soda each. I didn't drink much of mine so  we ended up having to share my drink because no one else came by to check on us!! All the while our waiter who was 'ending his shift' is still walking around talking to the other waiters/waitresses!!! This is the second and last time I am ever getting horrible service from this place! Never ever coming back to this location. A bunch of useless employees who don't want to do their job but want people to tip well. I get that's how you make a living  but you get paid what you are worth. So useless service gets useless pay.
Karina P.,Spring  TX,260,155,114,1/31/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"After a long while since dining at BJ\'s  I finally came back this afternoon and I am so glad I did! I walked in at about 4 p.m.  so the place wasn\'t packed by any means. The service was quick and friendly  and our food was on the table about 20 minutes after placing our order.Since I no longer struggle with a gluten or dairy sensitivity  I deviated from my usual gluten-free pizza order (great selection here for gluten free folks!!) and settled on the Original Roast Beef Dip sandwich with their wedge-cut seasoned fries. After witnessing my mom\'s bad experience with the French Dip at La Madeleine  I was nervous to try the French Dip sandwich at BJ\'s  which isn\'t a ""French cafe""  but it turns out that I had nothing to be nervous about. BJ\'s does a way better French Dip than La Madeleine! The roast beef inside the sandwich is juicy and tender  and the French roll is doughy and soft-- a great contrast to the savory beef and caramelized onions that are fun to rip apart with your teeth. The au jus has just the right amount of flavor too. I was really impressed.I had a bite of my grandma\'s avocado egg rolls  which have always been and STILL are delicious. BJ\'s is back on my list of favorite chain restaurants. It\'s accommodating and delicious enough for everyone in my picky family of five to find something to eat."
Meka A.,Houston  TX,0,6,,8/28/2016,5.0,Went with friends on a Saturday afternoon around 4pm. No wait at that time; friendly  attentive waitress. Flatbread nachos were amazing; seared ahi tuna salad pretty good but seemed to be missing something; bloody mary was bland. Must repeat  flatbread nachos were amazing!
Erni D.,Houston  TX,109,327,251,5/14/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Solid choice I vw always count on especially if we are not certain of what we want. Great variety and always consistent quality.
Jedi S.,Washington  DC,0,22,6,9/21/2015,1.0,Terrible food  good drinks  nice ambiance! The food is definitely not fresh and tastes worse than a TV dinner. We were really looking forward to trying this location out  and could not even eat our food despite being hungry - left most of the food on our plates untouched. Steak meat was low quality  mashed potatoes were cardboard powder  veggies were stale and frozen. Chicken wings were ok add were the only thing we could force ourselves to eat.It's a shame they are not doing justice to the customer nor their brand. I will avoid this place for food and would suggest Chilis or Applebee's over them any day!
Kristen T.,Houston  TX,149,42,50,12/29/2015,4.0,"This is the first time I\'ve been to BJ\'s in over 5+ years and it was a nice experience. I order the potato skins for an appetizer and for my main course  the chicken fried steak. I was very impressed at the potato skins which were fried to a perfect crisp and loaded with cheese and bacon (yum). The chicken fried steak was pretty good. I didn\'t realize how much food I\'d be getting though. It was two fried steaks on top of mashed potatoes and gravy along with steamed vegetables on the side. To finish my meal  I had the cookies & creme ""pizookie"" which is essentially a fresh out of the oven cookie with ice cream on top. It was one of the best cookies I\'ve had in a while and I was impressed by how soft and warm the cookie was. The service was overall great  our server never let our drinks go empty and always came by to check up on us. I will be returning to this place soon. It was worth the drive to the Willowbrook area."
Jay B.,Cypress  TX,1,13,12,2/21/2016,5.0,Every time I come here I am always a happy person. Staff is awesome and engaging. Food is always warm and delicious. And the bartenders know how to do more than just pour a beer. Love the smooth of the mojitos. recommend this place for sure.
Alison C.,Spring  TX,219,186,2552,3/26/2013,5.0,The best of the menu is the first three pages:drinks  appetizers  and the deep dish pizza..They have their own little menu of beer listed from lighter beers to darkerand all of the ones I have tried are fantastic!I would recommend the Nutty Brewnette and the Hopstorm IPA ~Most visits my table starts off with the spring rolls  though I have had (and enjoyed) their calamari  before I move on to my all-time favorite pizza: the BBQ chicken pizza.Flavorful sauce  tomatoes  red onions  and large chucks of pizza on a thick dough with crispy edges. Delicious!You may have to sit through very mediocre service when you come to BJ's  though.In my experience  the server is either overbearing or doesn't know what to do and messes up the order.Not to mention the wait to be seated!Being on 249 and 1960 this location gets a lot of foot traffic  and I think being next to Whiskey River helps BJ's get customers for their menu of pizza  pasta  and potatoes to soak up all of the.. well  whiskey.
Sonia B.,Killeen  TX,18,23,28,12/31/2015,5.0,Great food and better service. Their baked ziti is delicious. I went during lunch hour and I didn't have to wait for a table. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. I would definitely eat there again.
Temmesce C.,Houston  TX,133,17,10,6/14/2016,3.0,"I would probably give them 3.5 stars I do not round up as it gives them something to work towards. I ordered the shrimp tacos (forgot a pic). They were okay. I\'ve had way better and it\'s hard to come anything of that nature once you have been to Torchys Tacos (shoutout). I had to send my first order since it came out cold. I mean I thought I could drop the shrimp into my water since my ice cubes were melted. I expected my meal to be cold since it took about 30 minutes for it to come out. And no they were not ""packed"" on a Tuesday evening. The bartenders seem to always make up here were the cooks are lacking. Can\'t go wrong with alcohol. The manager brought out my new meal and the coins seems to have stepped up there game. My shrimp had a lot more seasoning and my slaw was not so dry like in the first plate. All in all. Don\'t get a booth  go straight to the bar!"
L C.,Houston  TX,0,31,,8/6/2015,2.0,Been going here since it opened. The original menu had some wonderful food. Today it is an overpriced Asian restaurant.Tonight we were very disappointed. BJ's is now an Asian restaurant offering a few American entrees that are poorly done. In my opinion  their Pizza is great. Hamburgers are disappointing  and ribs are fair. Loved pork chops & Cobb Salad...but they are no longer available. If you want honey glazed  soy & sesame  you will love this place. Mahi Mahi is available prepared Hawaiian (Japanese) or Asian. All grilled chicken or fish are Asian only. If you don't like that  they will gladly fry it for you. Couldn't find one grilled chicken or fish entree. They offer two grilled beef entrees  rib eye or sirloin steak. Also have hamburgers but in my opinion  they are disappointing.  Have two Pork options  ribs or bbq pork sandwich. It was hard to find something to eat.
Dee T.,Kaneohe  HI,0,32,6,2/7/2017,4.0,I don't know if we were just hungry or if the food was that good! We had the beer sampler chicken quesadilla deep dish pizza stuffed mushrooms and the asparagus. . .all of it was delicious!!!! Very clean and friendly service!!!!! Would definitely go back!!!
Amber C.,Houston  TX,24,91,10,6/9/2016,5.0,I have NEVER had a bad experience at the place. The service is always GREAT! The food is always DELICIOUS! And there are MANY BEERS ON TAP. I love coming to the place.
jason j.,Pearland  TX,2,74,8,8/2/2016,1.0,Came here to meet family for lunch. Bad service  super long wait. Food was mediocre at best. 1. Sampler platter. Had a cheese stick that had no cheese in the center. Just a hull. The chips for the dip were supper greasy. The wings and eggroll was ok.2. Ordered a Dr . pepper. It was fine. But the refill came out flat. Told that I would need to wait on the mix to get changed out. Switched to sweet tea. Never got a refill and was never offered one. 3. Fries that came with my meal were overcooked. Must have had a fryer issue. Was not given or offered ketchup for them. Did not see my waiter again  so could not ask.4. Tried the chicken bacon ranch piadinas was ok  but seemed a bit overcooked.5. Did not see our waiter much. Other people brought our food out. I did not get refills or condiments. I will not go back. This was a very poor dinning experience.
Shay R.,Austin  TX,33,23,72,8/20/2015,4.0,I've been using this location for years and tonight  I learned why! I had curb side takeout but couldn't find a place to park as the spaces were in use. I called inside and let them know I was at the store and ready to pick up my food. Long story short  three calls and no food  work break is long over and people were waiting to eat....I flip out...and the manager...she does EVERYTHING YOU HOPE THEY WILL. She apologized and empathized  comped the food and delivered it to the car immediately. She brought a beverage since it was hot out and was warm and apologetic about the whole thing.
Becky P.,Murfreesboro  TN,0,20,16,7/29/2016,4.0,Love BJ's. Best place for call ahead seating. No have never had one of their steaks and it was awesome.  Treated my friends to the white macadamia pazookie.  They loved it.
Pablo H.,Houston  TX,74,2,1,8/7/2016,5.0,Great food! They literally have everything. I always use there curbside service on days I want to eat good but don't feel like getting off.
Nikki X.,Houston  TX,5,425,965,5/31/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,My most recent visit was disappointing. It took over an hour to get a deep dish pizza and the pizza had next to no toppings. The pizookies made up for it but I hope it was only a one time thing
Shardool S.,Houston  TX,56,19,9,12/19/2015,2.0,Dusty counters and ants all over the booth! I witnessed them seat 3 couples at the same table that had to move because of the ants ! Not coming back to this place
Todd W.,Buda  TX,78,29,,8/11/2015,4.0,I really like all of the different beers they have to offer here. I had the Hefeweizen and the PM Porter and they were both great. There is a wide variety of options here so it is a good choice for almost anyone. I think their prices are a little high for the quality of food(~$14 a meal)  but I still enjoyed it. If you like cookies then get the Pizookie. It's delicious! Overall if you like craft beer or are looking for something a step above Chili's  Applebees  and all of the other casual restaurants  then this is the place to go.
Leslie T.,Houston  TX,165,582,257,5/14/2014,3.0,"It\'s your basic Applebee\'s  Chili\'s  Ruby Tuesday clone with some specialty brews. My review should just end there.Anyone who knows those places knows there will be burgers and some fancy overpriced salads and some fried apps. And that\'s what the menu consists of once you get past the hundred pages of specialty drinks in the front of the menu.I had the basic margarita and it was very sour. I think they need to adjust their mix a bit. Margaritas should be limey tart goodness...but not too puckery. I have tried their brews at another location. If you like craft beers these are pretty decent. You know what you like so sit at the bar and ask for a taste. They\'ll give you a small glass before you order a pint.The little sliders were your basic tiny buns and tiny meat with some really good pickles. The French Dip was a basic Sammy  nothing to write here about. The thing that really made this place feel pedestrian was my salad.They had what looked like a tasty new salad on the menu: Kale and Brussels sprouts. Here\'s the outline: Baby kale  herb-roasted brussels sprouts  romaine  blueberries  red grapes  dried cranberries  goat cheese  cucumber  candied pecans  toasted pepitas and red onions tossed in strawberry vinaigrette. The waitress brought it to me. I love Brussels sprouts and couldn\'t wait. I dug around in the thing and there were no Brussels sprouts anywhere. I don\'t remember seeing blueberries or cranberries either. I told her there were missing parts and she took it away. She came back and said she was sorry they were ""out of Brussels sprouts. But they would be happy to make me something else"". Most of my party was halfway done with their meals and I just told her to take it off our bill. She did. But really? You brought me a specialty salad with Brussels sprouts in the main description on the menu and the kitchen said nothing about not adding them? It wasn\'t her fault. It was the kitchen managers fault. Kinda like ordering a bacon cheeseburger and having it come out without the bacon and yet they still charge you for the bacon cheeseburger. Not cool.The place is really loud. If you come in with a large party of 5 or 6 and they steer you toward a horseshoe booth ask if they have a table. Hearing across one of those big things is almost impossible."
Misty S.,Houston  TX,1,34,23,12/20/2015,5.0,Decided to eat here with my boyfriend and 3yr old son. They provided my son with colors. The waitress was super nice and patient as I always ask a million questions before ordering. She suggested drinks to us. My boyfriend had like four glasses of two different beers (forgot the names) that he enjoyed. I had the Alabama fruity alcoholic beverage and all I needed was one! Very good and strong. We ordered the lemon pepper wings! Hot and fresh! Didn't take long to come out! Definitely a favorite! Then we had the pepperoni and sausage pizza.. Deep dish. Also very good. My son had their French fries and spaghetti. He enjoyed that. And lastly we had the chocolate chip and macadamia nut cookie with ice cream. They even made the cookie half and half for us cause my bf doesn't like chocolate. Sooo good. Overall  great experience and we will definitely be back!
Twana C.,Houston  TX,107,81,264,5/19/2015,4.0,Pizza  Pizza  Pizza and drinks. Well the service was sketchy could it been that we had just come from a Color Run and was not appropriately dressed but I have to say it was not under the NO SHOES  NO SHIRT  NO SERVICE sign. I go here for the pizza and drinks mostly. Great place to hang out with your favorite people and have a good time. The other food is good  too. For the craft beer lovers there is a slue of beers to choose from. Never heard of most of them try the beer sampler.
Jessie L.,Cypress  TX,0,6,1,3/12/2016,2.0,I was told by my co-workers  that the pizza here is the best. Well... It's far from it. Luke warm when it arrived to our table after 24 minutes  and tasted like typical frozen pizza I could buy at the store. Not impressed. Our server Brandon was attentive  and apologized for the pizza being below sub par. I asked to speak to the manager but no one ever came. I'll just call dominos next time.
Lauren G.,Houston  TX,372,74,21,9/26/2015,4.0,I love coming here! The service is so-so and if you come on the weekend  expect a wait. It's also kinda loud on the weekends because it's connected to a country bar/club and the Parking lot can get pretty packed. They do have a cool app that you can download and earn rewards. And they have the option to call ahead and get put on the waiting list. My favorite things from here are the wings  the Parmesan crusted chicken  and of course  the double chocolate pizzookie!! Other really yummy menu items include the chicken lettuce wraps and the pizzas. They also have a nice happy hour.
Kenneth J.,Houston  TX,51,53,41,5/18/2015,3.0,This place is better than a lot of other similar restaurants/sports bars in the area with the same sort of menu. Clean  usually friendly staff  huge bar with lots of selections  curb-side carry out  and decent food. I've mostly come here over the years to get pizzas to-go with the Mediterranean being my families favorite. It's better than your average take out pizza from other fast food chains. I've also come here a few times for things like graduation dinners and overall everyone enjoyed the experience. Just a solid overall place of your looking to grab a quick bite to eat and a beer. They're open pretty late if your looking for a late dinner.
Jessica B.,Houston  TX,3,49,48,4/11/2016,3.0,Has a pretty good beer selection. The only problem was the staff knew nothing about it. Even the house brews
Jill S.,Charlotte  NC,4,12,3,4/28/2016,5.0,Excellent pizza!!! I had the buffalo chicken pizza and it was delicious! It has great flavor with a little bit of spice! I loved it! The service and prices are good too! Would definitely recommend!!!
Allison G.,Tomball  TX,4,1,,4/25/2016,5.0,Our server was by far the best server we have ever had at BJ's. She was warm  funny  eager but not pushy  gave us suggestions and she's a definite asset to your staff. My boyfriend & I go to BJ's quite a bit & we can't say enough about our server.
Margaret M.,Spring  TX,29,4,6,5/12/2016,1.0,Not the best  had better. My steak was to dry  the asparagus was way over cooked  broccoli was terrible. Just was not satisfied with my meal. We ordered the calamari as a appetizer and it was just burned. Not good all. Server was not very well either
Tom M.,Spring  TX,0,8,3,5/12/2016,2.0,All sides of the Spectrum represented here:Service was sub-par.....fried calamari was pretty frikkin fried  too burnt. My wife's sirloin was rough n tuff  the veggies were dry n bland. My cobb salad was good  and gi-normous!. My son's burger was cooked to perfection.The beer was good  but there was no need for a second....Utter than that  atmosphere was nice...Tables are placed too close to one anotherMy salad and my son's food saved this 2-star rating
Mark W.,Houston  TX,0,3,,11/26/2016,1.0,The manager was very rude. The food was greasy. The service was terrible. I've been to this BJ's before  it wasn't this bad. It was a big group  and I know that's a lot to handle  but they couldn't handle it. Manager stared me down as I ate. They didn't deserve my money so I left no tip but here's one for you  don't come to THIS BJ's
Lauren S.,Houston  TX,5,19,,1/28/2015,5.0,I usually would not amply promote any sort of salt-laden chain restaurant  but this is my go-to place to get gluten pizza  if I'm not making it myself. Huge place  always busy for dinner  but you'll never find yourself screaming at others for them to hear you. Seating is comfortable  waiters are friendly  but sort of absent when it gets busier. Full bar  they offer beer flights  decent lunch specials  and have a HUGE dinner menu. I don't think anyone could NOT find something to eat here. When I don't feel like anything greasy  I get a salad. Their salads are delicious here people. Delicious and huge  but definitely not calorie friendly if that's what you're going for. However I do believe they have a list of low-cal items on the menu  which is some sort of grilled (frozen) protein and a heaping serving of (frozen) steamed veggies. Come on  it's BJ's  it's not going to knock your socks off  but you're certainly not going to be disappointed that you came. I've never had a bad experience personally. Gluten Freers: Rejoice! This is the best  readily available  casual restaurant gluten free pizza out there (the upper scale pizza award goes to Coal Vines). Did I also mention it is a giant pie  and reheats (baked) well? I t's probably not better than what you make  but when you're feeling lazy  this is the place. They now even offer a gluten free 'pazookie' (sp?).
Von C.,Houston  TX,76,57,58,1/8/2014,5.0,I usually hit up the Chilli's location right next door  but I was looking for a change of pace when I found BJ's. The menu is extensive  and they have great lunch specials. I got a personal sized pizza and a large Cesar salad for about 7 bucks. I sat at the bar where the bartender was friendly and attentive even though the lunch crowd had her busy. The BJ's craft beers are only $3.50 at lunch so I tried both the Light Switch and Blond and I was very impressed by both. They give you samples of the beers to try if you are indecisive like yours truly. I found my new chill spot.
Elsa E.,Houston  TX,143,9,10,7/16/2015,4.0,They have an extensive menu. Prepare to be undecided. Lol our waitress was very pleasant helpful  and patient. (Her name is Jackie). The drinks are absolutely delicious! I had the Tickled pink and my bff had A Drink Like That. You have got to try them. They have probably the biggest drink menu I have ever seen!
Don C.,Jersey Village  TX,122,529,271,8/26/2012,4.0,"First time in- GREAT beers- I tried 3 different ones they brew. They had chicago style pizza- I was stuck between two choices the waitress suggested ""get half and half if you want"". Cool.10 minute wait on a Friday at 9 PM not bad- great place. A little pricey for pizza but it really was good- I went for the 2nd smallest for myself and a friend ate a piece- I was pretty full with just that."
Harrison L.,Caldwell  TX,5,114,120,2/6/2015,4.0,Always a great place to get dinner late cuz they don't close till midnight! Spring rolls are a great appetizer. I usually get the pork chops or salmon. Food is usually pretty good and it's always nice and clean inside. All the waiters I've had have been quite good. Prices are roughy $15 per person without drink.
Mike W.,League City  TX,1,19,16,2/9/2015,5.0,They have a great double IPA. Great service and the new spicy pig tavern pizza is perfect. The waitstaff are great.
John G.,El Paso  TX,7,3,,2/11/2015,1.0,New Tavern cut pizzas are super thin & way overpriced!!! If your looking for an expensive snack for yourself  then this is for you! Not sure what going on with the menu? Everything good has disappeared  Derek's meatloaf  grilled chicken pasta & now the hand tossed pizzas!
Matthew R.,Spring  TX,70,15,73,4/15/2016,5.0,Love this restaurant  great place  great service  great food  & great waiter! My wife  my child  and I were taken care of and then some. I wanted to personally thank Ayodeji F. for his awesome service! I will try to sit in his section again. Thanks again!!!
V L.,Houston  TX,1,61,55,12/18/2015,1.0,I've been to a Bj's in other states and the food was delicious there. However at this location  it was a completely different story. The food tasted terrible. The service was average  she didn't check back on us. Let me get back to the food it was a waste of money -- I could've spent less and went to a decent fast food place. It is seriously not worth it. I got the deep dish ravioli & Lemon pepper dry rub wings. They both tasted like TV dinners and the ravioli tasted like canned food. Flavorless and disgusting.My partner got the Sriracha Mac and Cheese. The cheese tasted so fake and you couldn't even taste Sriracha in the sauce. Moral of the story  I was paying double the price for nasty school lunch food. Will never be back here again. I will only trust the Bj's in other states.
Brandy M.,Houston  TX,208,3,,3/21/2016,5.0,Our waitress was awesome! We had two families with two babies and she was very attentive and patient. I recommended this place to the friends we had out of town and they loved it. We sincerely enjoyed our dining experience. Please let our server we had  thank you! ( from the families that didn't want mayo on their brisket bacon burgers)
Lucy L.,Houston  TX,4,89,24,1/5/2015,4.0,Bjs is pretty consistent with their food and service  I think bad service was one out of 10 for me. Every time I come at least I get one or two Hi meaning I exist and walking among living humans. That usually makes my minute  Since a day sounds too long or exaggerated. It's a jungle out there. I usually get their blue cheese burger because I know it won't disappoint me  and I usually do not like burgers so that says a lot  or to me t does.Their thin cut fried is awesome  blonde beer tall glass can be enjoyed over the meal and gives me the classy feeling not the chuck chuck chuck feeling hurry up eat your food and get out that I have at some other bar-serves-food places. I have been here more than 10 in the past 6 months and it still is my place to go for burgers. Pretty decent price also for a nice sit down restaurant to enjoy life with family and friends.
Miladie D.,Houston  TX,10,15,1,3/9/2016,5.0,Our server Alexandrea was great. She was very attentive but didn't make us feel rushed. The food was delicious!
Tenia O.,Houston  TX,362,225,306,8/27/2013,3.0,I've pass by this place millions of times. Was bored this past Sat. & decided why not give it a try...ended up being a good choice!The set up is like a bigger  better  tad more upscale version of Chilli's. The bar is gorgeous & huge! I dropped in around 11ish  so there were no children there  but this seems to be a place that you can bring the kiddos w/ no problems. Their special thing is their own craft beers. I tried the blonde ale which was pretty good. Food wise  I went for the fried wontons Thai style & the Corn & Bacon fritters...YUMMY!!! And for $3 each it was a steal. The dipping sauses for both were really good. Bartender was really sweet. They let you have a taste of the specialty drafts before you order which is a plus. Chatted it up w/ a couple of folks that seem to be regulars. Very nice vibe to the place. Noticed they hustled to keep the place clean & in order even w/ the busy Saturday crowd. The menu here is HUGE!! In fact  I think this is the only negative thing I can think of from my 1st run. There's sooo much stuff on the menu  it's almost overwhelming. Perhaps if it was designed better it would be a little more eye catching. You open it & there's just words/food everywhere. I will be going back to try some other things I saw on the menu. The guy next to me ordered the pulled pork & basically drooled on himself eating it. Besides  $20 for 2 apps  a couple beers & tip based on great service...not a bad deal!!
C G.,Austin  TX,22,129,49,1/29/2016,5.0,I've never had a bad experience here. The food is always good. The pazookies are THE BEST. The Moscow mules are delicious as well as the margaritas.
Raul M.,Houston  TX,96,178,202,11/21/2013,5.0,Finally there's a place where I can go enjoy a good cold beer with an tasty burger. The atmosphere here is wonderful here. We came here on a Friday night so it was pretty packed when we got there and we ended up having to wait. We waited around 25 minutes for a table for 4 including two kids.  Nit long after sitting down  we were fretted by our friendly waitress which offered drink and food suggestions. Of corse I ordered a beer  however I'm not sure what it was but it was good. The waitress said it was brewed locally. I ordered a burger which was huge and delicious. My wife and kids were also happy with their orders. Great place Great service Great food :)
Ambrianna F.,Tomball  TX,15,17,9,7/31/2015,4.0,My date and I enjoyed our experience here! It was a little loud  but we managed just fine. The food was excellent and the waiter was unobtrusive. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer; the breading was a little bland but overall it was good. I had the Roast Beef Dip as an entree. The bread was soggy but the meat was delicious! The crispy fries are amazing. For dessert we split a strawberry beignet  which was really just a mini cake  but it was the perfect ending. Everything was very fresh. I will certainly be returning!The one criticism was that the menu was quite large. It took us quite a long time to decide what to order!
Tony A.,Cypresswood Forest  Spring  TX,61,89,39,1/24/2016,4.0,Bjs is a well known and established place. They have their own brand of beer and each of which are very delicious. (I haven't tried them all) but they brew all varieties (light beer  blondes  dark  wiezen etc). The buffalo chicken deep dish pizza is a MUST try. I order this every time that I go. Service is okay  but it takes more than just doing your job to impress me.
Rob S.,Spring  TX,2,13,,2/24/2016,5.0,First time trying the jalapeno burger  won't be the last! Also  there pizza is hard to beat... awesome food there and good benefits if you're a member!
Rebecca B.,Humble  TX,2,64,3,1/23/2016,3.0,Fish and chips bland  and bland. Menu so big  but half are beers and drinks. Been to BJs near the woodlands and it was good. This one needs to do better in the cooking department. Service was good  place clean.
Carlisa B.,Houston  TX,92,63,63,11/2/2013,4.0,Omg that Oreo Pizzokie is fantabulous!!! It's warm with ice cream and Oreo whipped cream! We used the Google Offer for 2 for $19.95  which includes 2 salads  any Medium pizza (we got the 5 meat pizza...yummo) and the Pizzokie!! Good food...good service!
Suzy C.,Houston  TX,216,51,169,9/5/2015,1.0,2 words- HORRIBLE service! Won't even comment on the food. what's the point of dining in for horrible service. Poor management. Atmosphere is sluggish just like the servers. Take your money somewhere else. I used to go here for lunch all the time until something changed and now the food is just fair and the service is just ridiculous- long wait  no service with a smile! Swear we waited 20 min after being seated just to get our drinks  salads took another 40 minutes  when food came out 1 hr later the steaks were overcooked and soup horrible! Waiting for server to bring back our change and close out tickets...Never coming back EVER!
Trisha P.,Houston  TX,43,55,8,12/23/2015,4.0,Came here the other night to see what all the buzz was about. The food was pretty good. I had the parmesan crusted chicken with broccoli and white cheddar mash potatoes. I was a bit disappointed that i only got 2 semi big pieces of broccoli but it was still delicious. What really intrigued me was the Brussel sprouts. I would've just ordered that add a meal. I'm a veggie lover so don't judge me. Lol everybody else with me lived their food as well. The sting fries were surprisingly flavorful and my nephew who doesn't like broccoli enjoyed the broccoli in his pasta. Besides the lack of broccoli on my plate and the waitress Taylor providing just ok services. Everything was great. Would definitely come back.
Arturo Y.,Leander  TX,20,124,331,10/9/2011,3.0,"Decent food - like the Shareable Appetizers more then the Entrees. Like the Pot Stickers and the Wings -Like the BJ Beers also - Been going to this particular restaurant for several years - still very ""new"" and well maintained.(usually very good service - can be some wait if you pick a busy time...)"
Natalie V.,Huntsville  TX,21,68,88,12/29/2013,4.0,Pretty good. Was our first time. So we ordered the avocado egg rolls (recommended by a friend of ours) they weren't too bad.Got the Jeremiah red beer (Irish red). And settled with the lunch specials the mauhi mauhi tacos with chips and salsa.Delicious. First time and will probably go again.
Ryan B.,Rapid City  SD,107,11,2,12/22/2015,5.0,"First time going and it well exceeded my expectations. The service was excellent and the food was absolutely scrumptious. I personally ordered the ""Seared Ahi Salad"" and it was delicious. My girlfriend ordered the Italian style pizza and shared some and I have to say that it was very good as well."
Foodman T.,Flushing  NY,5,43,11,10/24/2015,5.0,Excellent food! Food has been consistantly great  nice selection of beer ! Very comfortable and relaxed environment ! Servers are very friendly and helpful !
Mark B.,South Burlington  VT,115,112,1,8/3/2014,3.0,"Take a standard chain of mediocrity  and add mediocre beer brewed in house. Not to say that it\'s a terrible place; it isn\'t. But it\'s not like super stand out either. I had a chicken dish that was very flavorful...it was a crusted parmesan with a nice sauce. Service was very good. Staff were friendly.Where it kinda goes wrong is with the beer. I\'m a beer snob  I\'ll admit. I\'ve had everything from Heady Topper to MGD  and I know how to make every style  and have tasted some of the best of each. Their beers are just OK. What makes it worse is the knowledge of the staff. First  you\'re not supposed to touch the tap to the glass  nor overfill above the tap. But that\'s a minor infraction. Where it gets worse is when you have no clue how to serve the varieties you offer. My IPA was served in a pilsner glass. That\'s the very tall  narrow  V shaped glass. Which totally KILLS the hoppy aromas of an IPA. You can\'t properly immerse your nose in them  like with a proper tulip or IPA glass. Then I decided to get a Paulaner Hefeweizen instead  as they had it on draft  and I figured that would be better. It was not served in the tall  curvy ""Weibier"" glass  but in a standard American pint glass instead. Again  the glass design enhances the beer - most places that serve Hefeweizen  that claim to be brewpubs  and make the motions would know these things. A Hefeweizen glass has the curves to catch sediments and the yeast  and also enhances the aromas of that style beer.I asked the bartender about it and he sheepishly admitted they only had the two types of glasses; he genuinely seemed ashamed that someone had called them out on it."
Keith B.,Pompano Beach  FL,134,438,2,5/23/2013,4.0,Out of town on business  we were looking for a place that had a variety.  We have BJ's near where I live  but never been to one.   This place was great.   Beers are awesome (I did a sampler).  We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and the yellow mustard sauce was awesome.I had a turkey burger with cheese and avocado and it was great.Can't wait to go to my local place when I get back.
Nathaniel M.,Houston  TX,87,14,30,6/10/2014,3.0,It's a cross between a restaurant and a bar. Have lots of TV for watching sports and atmosphere is pretty laid back. Portions are not bad and price is decent. I think they take a little long to get your food. If you have more than 8 in a group  expect at least 30 min wait to get your food. It was 3 of us that were there to eat and it took about a good 20 mins to get our food.
Susan D.,Cypress  TX,0,4,1,3/13/2016,2.0,We waited 10 minutes after being seated to have our drink order taken. We waited another 10 minutes to get 2 beers and 2 soft drinks. The restaurant was not crowded at all. We got there after 11:00 on a Sunday night. Our food took at least 25 minutes to come out. The food was tasty enough. My daughter asked for a drink refill and ranch for her french fries when her food was delivered. She was finished with her steak by the time the waitress came back by our table. We had to remind her about the refill and ranch. By the time it was delivered the fries were ice cold and she didn't need the ranch after all. Our feeling about our experience tonight would have been so much better if we had had service. There was no apparent manager checking on things. The bar tender stayed behind the bar taking constant care of the 4 people that were there. The hostess just stood there.
Alvin J.,San Jose  CA,176,388,2,3/14/2013,3.0,This place is pretty similar to Champps Americana and Brick House Tavern  but it feels a little nicer/more elegant  or as elegant as a sports bar can be. There is not too many nice places around my office but BJ's does the trick for work lunch  especially since the place is big and the service is quick. They have good lunch specials  and the menu is very long so there's a range of choices  even if you're vegetarian or are counting calories. My favorite is the soup/sandwich combo; their tortilla soup in particular is tasty.The beer is decent. Some good ones (Piranha Pale and the Hefeweizen) and some clunkers. All in all  for this part of town you could do worse
Zippy A.,Houston  TX,0,53,1,11/1/2015,4.0,Great food  huge menu  and always good waitstaff.I enjoy this place and its even open late!!!!!Also  this is a wonderful place to see a game!Wifi is free and you can get a BJ's rewards card to earn free meals! They also have coupons and bogo deals from time to time!!!! The pizookie is a must have!!!
Greg M.,Houston  TX,0,36,6,12/29/2015,4.0,Now  I know that Yelp gives it a 3.9 or so.....but we really enjoyed this place! Again  don't expect a 5-Star restaurant....it is what it is.....and what we had was great! Thin crust appetizer pepperoni pizza...rib-eye medium...calimari...chicken strips...hamburgers....it was fantastic  great....come on people...sometimes you are too critical....great bar  clean....nice decor....good draft beers.....If you have a little money...it is well worth it.....Good prices for what you get...nice serving sizes....
Monica T.,Houston  TX,227,108,18,7/6/2014,4.0,Came on a busy night  but was still seated relatively quickly. I ordered parmesan crusted chicken  and it was satisfying. Unfortunately  before I got the entree  they managed to lose my order in the mix  so I actually got it late  but then the waiter brought me out a full sized pizookie to make up for it. The pizookie was amazing  so I was pretty happy with my visit.
Daniel G.,Houston  TX,148,11,3,12/26/2015,4.0,My latest visit to BJ's was on Saturday Dec 12 2015. It wasnt too busy so our waiter was very attentive and friendly. I ordered a small deep dish sweet pig pizza which was AMAZING  a order of beef sliders which was ok  and of course for dessert i got a white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. The best part of my visit was def the pizookie! If i could remember my servers name i'd def give him a shout out bc he was amazing with the drink refills. I'd rate my visit a 9 out of 10 only because the sliders could have been better.
C D.,Houston  TX,1,55,22,5/2/2015,2.0,Extremely slow service. Staff doesn't seem well trained. Always reaching over you to serve someone else or to pour or serve a drink. The food is decent but I feel like you can get that average kind of food anywhere. I'd give it two stars just because service is lacking.
Judy P.,Hamilton  MT,21,12,,6/24/2016,1.0,My family went in two nights ago. I have always loved the grilled shrimp tacos....they have changed so much....not sure what that crap was on the top in placed of the cabbage slaw and the gaucamole sauce was so spicy i couldn't even eat it. The tacos was also spicy and the tortillas were very chewy. Another family member ordered the blackened shrimp tacos and they were also too spicy. Those prior tacos were the best in town....now the worst. IF IT AIN'T BROKE  DON'T FIX IT!!! We complained but nothing happened  the manager didn't even come to our table. Worst ever!!!!
Danielle L.,Houston  TX,40,14,3,10/15/2015,5.0,I love this place... the food is good  the service is great and if you have any issues they try to resolve them for you. Love love love the Peanut Butter Smores Pizookie!
Jan F.,Kingwood  TX,19,25,1,10/1/2015,4.0,I love this place. I've had many things on the menu  tasted most  if not all  of their beers  and haven't had a bad thing yet! I first learned of BJ's while working in CA. They're a little far from my house  but they are expecting to open another restaurant in my area  Kingwood/Humble. Can't wait!
Lea S.,Houston  TX,11,53,251,4/8/2014,5.0,I freaking LOVE this place! I have been here many times! Dates with the hubs  girls night out family time  & have even ordered to go The alcohol selection is FABULOUS! I can't wait to have this baby becaue when I do I WILL be coming here for my 1st drink after I have my angel on my 1st official girls night ;) All of the food is wonderful here! I ALWAYS try to get something different but it's hard knowing how yummy the avocado egg rolls are! The ahi tuna is fabulous but they no longer have it on the menu but you can ask your waiter for it & the chefs will still make it for you (winning lol). The deep dish pizza is out of this world good & would go great with a blue moon! My son loved his mini cheeseburger sliders he got too! Others we have enjoyed are: Fried Artichokes  gourmet Mac & Cheese  spinach artichoke dip  chicken lettuce wraps  & the sante fe rolls! Our service has always been good even when they are busy!
Mike B.,Cypress  TX,12,91,31,4/14/2014,4.0,Great lunch special. A coworker and I both ate for $18.00. That a great deal. He had the soup and sandwich.I had the BBQ lunch. The slider was excellent  the chicken was ok. Very big portions. Very clean and super service. Our waiter Troy was on the ball. He knew the menu   he was on top of the drinks and you could tell that he liked what he did. Try the tuna tataki. It is one of the best things on the menu. The manager at this location is on point. Super Clean restaurant. Fast Food. Excellent service. A greeter with a smile. What more could you ask for?
Matthias M.,Schweitenkirchen  Germany,4,1,,9/21/2015,3.0,Has seen better times. Been here at every visot in Houston. Seen beter service and food  before
Todd M.,Houston  TX,73,421,235,4/16/2014,4.0,I like BJ's mostly for the beer. They have an excellent selection of craft beer and at very reasonable prices. They also have bar bites like stuffed mushrooms and corn fritters for under $5. Restaurant is very clean  updated and great for casual lunch / dinner / family or dates. Staff has always been excellent. This is one of my top spots in NW Houston  249/1960 area for catching a beer and snacking on some bar bites.
Imagine P.,Houston  TX,14,70,115,7/2/2014,4.0,I've never had any complaints about bj's brewhouse  they have a wide arrange of food on there menu. The service is normally an A+ and everyone is very attentive food is always tasty! If you are a sucker for a great desert definitely have a pazooki and even better they have a selection of great beers! It's a chill place to go and have a good meal. :)
Ramonica C.,Houston  TX,184,3,1,2/7/2015,4.0,Visited this place last night and it was good. The lettuce wraps were delicious and drinks are okay. The have reverse happy hour from 9-11 pm the only spot in this area that does ... I believe. I've been twice now and I'd highly recommend it. Service is pretty quick  immediate seating no waiting  and comfortable environment.
Luar L.,Spring  TX,0,17,10,6/12/2015,5.0,We had a larger than normal group of 12 people. The wait was a bit long but expected with such a large group. They gave us two servers which were very attentive. Our drinks and food came out hot within a reasonable time frame. No complaints. Thanks
Shay T.,Houston  TX,134,58,175,10/28/2014,5.0,"For an Appetizer we had the "" California Club Flatbread Pizza "" which was Very Good!!! For my Entree I had a Salad "" Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad "" $12.95 which was Excellent!!! It was Super Fresh & pretty big as I struggled to finish it  but I just had to because it was SoOoo Good!! The customer service is always A1 here I\'ll be back soon."
Rhi M.,Houston  TX,38,159,16,5/15/2015,2.0,The service here was sad... As in it was painful to wait 90 minutes for food  especially with children!!! Food was average for a chain restaurant in Cypress.
Lamb C.,Plano  TX,45,9,,8/13/2015,4.0,Pretty cool. I had a the bacon  brisket burger. It was really good. Also tried the chicken Parmesan with lemon. It was also tasty. It tasted better after time.
Crystal S.,Cypress  TX,24,87,69,4/14/2014,5.0,Great food. I've ate here several times for lunch. I've had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes  the mahi-mahi fish tacos  and of course the pizza. It has all been delicious. The staff is always friendly. If you go for lunch  get there by 11:30. It can get really crowded
Coco B.,Cypress  TX,27,39,24,12/20/2014,4.0,Definitely try the BJ`s Burger. It was moist  fresh  and just plain delicious. They have a full bar and the house drinks are pretty yummy. I don't remember which one I got (it was that good). This is a cool place for a casual date night.
Ryan V.,Spring  TX,10,234,3,5/20/2012,3.0,Been here a couple times for the pizza  which is amazing!But at the end of the day it's just pizza  and this place is kinda expensive.They have nice tasty rootbeers though (like brewed I think  not regular ones)I haven't sought out BJs for a while though  and the desire just isn't really there :-/Good place though  would go back  just too chainey and busy in my opinion to go to by default.
Marshall J.,Austin  TX,627,480,270,8/7/2011,4.0,My wife and I have gotten consistently horrible service everywhere we've gone for the last two months. BJ's broke the spell tonight--our server was friendly without being schmoozy and helpful without being obtrusive.Great beer selection and variety for a place that  honestly  looks like a T.G.I. Friday's.
Jason S.,Houston  TX,3,91,14,9/13/2013,3.0,This place used to be great. Now it's just good.In its heyday  they had $2 crafts beers on Tuesday  $5 mini pizzas  happy hour restaurant-wide (you didn't have to sit at the bar for specials)  and a friendly consistent staff that took care of their regulars. But that's long gone.Now its just $1 off beers (so they're like $4.50 on special)  happy hour only in the bar  and varied staff with high turn over. Not quite the place it used to be.But that aside  food is still good - especially the pizzas. Their craft beers are expensive but good (though if you are already into craft beer  they are a little lighter in taste). And while the staff is varied  they are still friendly.Place gets packed at peak hours - so come off-hours or be ready to wait.
Jenn L.,Houston  TX,73,238,236,2/8/2014,4.0,This is my third time visiting BJ's. I would say their staff is friendly and the food is pretty good. I've tried their deep-dish pizzas  Spinach stuffed mushrooms  Gourtmet Mac & Cheese  Louisiana style Pasta  Jumbalaya  Pizookies  and cocktails.-Spinach stuffed mushrooms- I would say it's a 5/5. The sauce is pretty good and they don't drench the mushrooms with the sauce which was a plus.-Gourmet Mac & Cheese- 3/5  I would say it's a little different from the mac and cheese most people imagine. The cheese is on the light side and it's not saucey like most mac and cheese dishes. The presentation of the mac and cheese was really nice but I've had better.-Deep dish pizza- 3/5  the Gourmet five meat pizza is really good but when I think of deep-dish I think of Chicago style deep-dish. The pizza isn't as cheesy but the pizza is good. Meat lovers should try the Gourmet five meat. I've tried their pepperoni pizza and it was average.-Pizookie- 5/5 AMAZING. All of their pizookies are good. However  the triple chocolate is definitely for chocolate lovers. SO sweet and very chocolate-y/. I usually stick with Cookies and cream and White Macadamia nut pizookie. Red velvet is pretty good  too. You can sample 3 pizookies for $10. -Jack lemonade is pretty good. Definitely sweet with a hint of Jack. -Louisiana style pasta/ Jumbalaya- 3/5. Service is 4/5.
Bobby A.,La Grange  TX,0,46,4,4/7/2014,4.0,Good  fast  friendly service. Waiter knew his stuff. Food was good - lemon chicken with angel hair pasta and artichokes in a cream sauce. Good portions  well presented. Had the avocado egg rolls with tamarind dipping sauce - good mix of flavors. Only complaint is that the main course came out before the appetizer. I would definitely go back.
Linh P.,Houston  TX,0,2,1,7/4/2015,3.0,Ordered the BJ deep dish pizza. It was good but the service sucks!!! They didn't refill any of our drinks are ask how we were doing but when it was time to pay they were there in a flash!!
Jassmine B.,Houston  TX,0,5,1,4/8/2016,4.0,Great atmosphere and drinks. The salmon unfortunately didn't stand up to that. I can say my boyfriends barbacoa chicken was delicious. Will go back just won't be ordering the salmon
Spunke S.,Houston  TX,94,42,65,3/19/2014,5.0,I love this place! My work comes here often for lunches and we try to get here right when they open because after 12pm it is a mad house! I really like they chicken tortilla soup! Its the best and the presentation is spot on. My favorite drink to get here is a long island iced tea. I never have to order more then one! Plus on your birthday they give you a free pizzookie!
Diana G.,Houston  TX,1,8,,6/9/2015,5.0,Love this place. I've been there multiple times and it keeps me coming back. The service is good and the drinks/food are great!
Laura W.,Katy  TX,167,312,186,8/22/2011,4.0,You can't go wrong with BJ's. They have a very large menu so you're bound to find something at this restaurant that you're want to eat and it'll be delicious! They have everything from pizza  to pasta  burgers  sandwiches  salads  soups  and appetizers galore! And their drink and beer menu will quinch your thirst as well!Don't forget to try their one-of-a-kind pazookies for dessert! They even have mini ones that you can have just for yourself. I recommend the white chocolate macadamian nut one! Yum!I would definitely suggest BJ's for a girl's night out  a night out with the boys  a fun family outing or even a quick lunch.
Anji A.,Los Angeles  CA,127,124,930,8/26/2011,4.0,"Wow. I was pretty impressed! I don\'t usually go for the big chain restaurants  but it was a convenient place to meet an out of town friend. We expected to get maybe a pin or two of one of their delicious beers  and call it a day. But we walked in during the lunch hour  and seeing everyone else eating  we of course indulged in a few mini-plates. (Pigs  I know). Here\'s what we had:BJ Brewhouse BlondeNobile Sauv Blanc- yum!Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato SaladSeared AhiCrispy Fried ArtichokesMargherita Fresca PizzaSeriously  we walked out for all of these for just $30 buckaroos. The small plates were only $3 to $4 a piece  pizza about $8 and the drinks $6 and $7. I didn\'t realize they had such reasonable options  and having these types of ""bar bites"" was just fantastic. I\'ll look forward to stopping in to other BJ locations  I definitely had a surprisingly pleasant visit. :)"
Jacob R.,Houston  TX,0,5,,7/13/2015,4.0,I normally go to BJ's in Pearland to meet friends  but this one in the Willowbrook area is great! I came in with a small group and we had some great drinks  but the food was average this time. The pizookies never fail us  the salted caramel is my favorite.
Noor-Hal C.,Houston  TX,9,107,,4/13/2015,4.0,Went to have dinner for one of my friends because it was her birthday and we really enjoyed the food! We shared a pizza and got some appetizers. We got the Crispy Fried Artichokes and Crispy Calamari. We got as well the Classic Tavern Cut Pizza and it was delicious. The service was really nice  our waitress came frequently to check on us if we needed something  even though the place was crowded! Worth checking the rest of the menu :D
Liliana P.,Houston  TX,0,13,1,4/11/2015,4.0,Food is amazing! I had the crispy jalapeo burger  sooo good! Their wedge fries were also super good! I also had a strawberry patch mixed drink & it was the perfect balance of sweet & strong. The selection of beers is pretty extensive. It explains what category each beer lands on & what it tastes like. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5  is because our service sucked really bad. Our waitress would hardly come to check on us & we were constantly looking for her & waiting to order more drinks/condiments/etc. definitely coming back though for their food!
Isabel C.,Houston  TX,175,96,17,1/9/2014,3.0,We decided to go to BJ's for a co-worker's going-away luncheon. The invitation ballooned and what was originally a 12 person lunch turned into a 20 person lunch. The staff at BJ's was very accomodating and they moved us over to a small area off to the side and one of the managers stepped up to help take orders and move the dining experience along. It only took 1.5 hours from seating to paying the bill  which for such a large party is a great feat. Although the service was really good  I can't say that the food was any sort of spectaular  which is what holds my rating back. I ordered the Half sandwich  half soup + fries. The California Chicken sandwich  which seemed to have an abundance of mayo on it  was decent. I enjoy a dollop of mayo to add some fatty goodness; however  I don't enjoy having globs of it spilling out onto my plate and my fries. The chicken noodle soup was akin to what I could find in a can  but it still hit the spot and expectations. The chose the shoestring potato fries because I like the crispiness to starch ratio. They were well-cooked  but underseasoned.All-in-all it was an enjoyable dining experience and I appreciate the staff at BJ's for being able to handle our seemingly ever expanding party.
Nicole R.,Houston  TX,7,17,3,2/20/2014,3.0,The Morrocan Salmon was just okay..wouldn't suggest it if you are super hungry. GET THE PAZZOKIE!The restaurant service is good as well as the food I just didn't get the best entree that time.
Jay Theron P.,Houston  TX,51,47,9,1/13/2012,4.0,I love this place...except for some of their appetizers...but the local beer selection...darker beer selection is very tasty with great pricing. Tip: If you come on the weekend  get a seat at the bar area. You will be served quicker and your food will come out sooner...it's just weird like that. Every time I have been seated elsewhere  the service was less than appreciated and the food came out relatively cold.
Rachel B.,Houston  TX,444,193,103,12/16/2012,3.0,"I\'m really torn on my feelings about this place. I tend to frequent here with friends who live in the area because it\'s well known landmark in the Willowbrook area. The menu is really hit or miss. Must try: Any type of pizza and the southwestern spring rolls. Not to try: California chicken sandwich and pretty much any pasta dish. The real reason I allow myself to meander through their heavy double doors is for the beer. It is nice to go to a chain and find an exciting beer menu. The Hopstorm IPA is a personal fav. If you happen land one of their few and far between ""good"" waiters then I would advise you to pick their brain about what you should choose. Had a lovely girl give me a run down on the list. Much appreciated ma\'am.Waitstaff here makes me a touch mad. On 2 separate occasions I have had just bazaar incidents happen with different waiters. One man took 20 minutes to run my credit card on a very slow night. Second was someone who wasn\'t even waiting our table who delivered the food by slamming it down without a word and walked away. Rude.I\'ve been told there is a waiter here that looks exactly like Obama. I for one will continue to go back to get the opportunity to witness this myself."
Samir N.,Royal Oak  MI,216,472,1,10/11/2013,2.0,For a chain  the beer actually has flavor and is not different colored versions of the same watered down stuff. They had lots of TVs everywhere to catch Sunday football  but they were all along the outside walls so you had to contort yourself or strain to see them. Is this a Willowbrook thing? I also tried the pizzookie - vanilla on chocolate. It did not meet my [overly high] expectations. By the time I finished my beers  the check came out. I guess the waiter did not want me ordering other beers (they had non-BJs beer that I would have liked to try).
Betsy R.,Houston  TX,41,25,12,11/11/2013,1.0,The food was so-so but not worth the price or the wait that Jeniffer A. gave us by spending half her time gossiping with other waitresses. My fianc ordered the parm. crusted chicken  which I have had and loved at other locations. They ruined it. My jambalaya was okay though it shod have been spicier and they had nothing to spice it up. Waited probably fifteen or more minutes between empty drinks and refills. Our table was not buses between courses.Avoid if you can. Don't go in with high expectations if you must.
Ashley W.,Houston  TX,0,2,,5/20/2015,2.0,"We loved going to BJ\'s where we used to live and decided to give this one a try since it was close to our house. We won\'t make that mistake again. First  we asked for a booth and were told very matter of fact by the hostess that there were no booths available. Umm.. we spotted 2 open and we were being seated immediately upon walking in so we know they were not already designated for another table. I\'m assuming they needed us to sit in someones section to balance out the servers tables. Not my problem. Second  we end up sitting at a regular table and not making a fuss even though we can still see the two open booths. But the real problem began when our waitress introduced herself. She was as the lady behind me said  ""sour.. that\'s girl is just sour! No smile  no manners  just here\'s your food now can you pay?"" Lady  I couldn\'t have said it better myself. I worked in retail in college.. I know what it\'s like to work with the public. You catch more bees with honey than vinegar.The final straw was the mix up on our food. My husband ordered a salad to come out before his meal. 25 minutes after ordering... here comes our meal. No salad. So he stops another server because of course we can\'t find ours and the guy disappears. Here comes the hostess asking what type of salad it was.. 10 minutes later  meals are finished.. here comes the waitress asking what kind of salad it was? No I\'m sorry.. No discount on our meal.. Nope. Just some lousy excuse that it was put in a to go box and misplaced. Okay. Sure. Not buying this excuse. Just own up to forgetting to put it in for the order. Being humble is better than blaming someone else. Sad to say  we will not be going back to this BJ\'s."
Jessica M.,Cypress  TX,93,248,94,1/7/2013,4.0,I really like this place and Happy Hour is pretty good. Lasts until 7 I think but at the bar only I believe. I have never had anything I don't like at this place and I love the variety of beers.
Lawrence V.,Houston  TX,146,134,182,6/15/2013,5.0,Really good homemade tasting pizza
Hilary A.,New Orleans  LA,128,150,74,12/22/2010,3.0,"I went here for lunch with two friends today  a Wednesday around 11:30. The parking lot was packed! I had no idea it would be so crowded. When we went in  the hostess and the other people at the host stand ignored us; finally  a waiter addressed us (after looking around  wondering why no one else was). We were seated right away  and the hostess turned the menu to the lunch menu for us.When our waiter came  he told us he was sleepy. Awkward. I asked a question  and he answered it equally awkwardly  then walked away to serve another table. Yikes. I ordered a caesar salad and half a ""giant stuffed baked potato"" (which cost me $9 including 20% tip). The salad portion was very good and tasted and looked fresh. I asked for the baked potato to be loaded but without sour cream. They brought me butter with chives in it? That seemed strange to me. The baked potato also had way too much cheese on it (it was covered!)  and just looked generally unappetizing. One friend ordered the chicken fingers and had plenty left over. The other friend had a salad and the broccoli cheddar soup  which she complained was almost too stringy (melted cheese) to eat. I\'ve been to this restaurant at this location before  but not in awhile. I recall having a better experience in the past  and would also recommend the pizzookie.Tip: Lots of people were drinking beer at lunch  so don\'t feel too bad if you want to get your mid-day drink on!"
John E.,Mandeville  LA,90,20,,2/6/2015,2.0,"Boy  this place has so much potential with 5 star beer  but the food is 3 star  they fail so much on one aspect that is ridiculous. Wifi.  There is absolutely NO phone bars (T-Mobile) and then I go to their ""wifi"" and get to watch my phone and computer try to get connection FOR A FRICKING HOUR. I feel like I went back in time to my dial-up modem just to re-live the ultimate frustration of having the POTENTIAL of having internet  but failing at the last minute. Seriously  I have things to do  and don\'t have time to waste on waiting for something that even momandpop coffee shops seem to do  which is give me access to the world. Please let me know when you have decided to spend the extra $55 bucks a month for decent wifi  and I will reward you by buying more beer and possibly food. Cheers!"
Jason B.,Houston  TX,13,10,,8/18/2014,2.0,Quite expensive... over a hundred dollars for a few beers for a few friends. 10 dollar beers? Here ya go! Oh  also  allow us to have our ceiling drip water on you and your food  Thanks for comping an appetizer  but you might have considered moving us... Not good enough to revisit for me. Although food was decent  if expensive.
E. C.,Houston  TX,0,14,,1/1/2016,3.0,Ugh. I don't know what all the excitement about this place is about. I didn't enjoy the food or the atmosphere. Too noisy and tables are too close together. Food choices are unhealthy.
Chandra A.,Dallas  TX,77,31,25,2/16/2015,2.0,"Visiting from out of town and was underwhelmed with the preparation of their signature dish  Crusted Parmesan. Chicken ""breast"" was so thin it was dry on the edges and tough to cut. Another guest underwhelmed with her buffalo wings. Hard to tell if this was a bad day for the chef or if this site is not up to the typical BJ standards."
DeWayne R.,Sugar Land  TX,160,558,273,3/29/2013,4.0,Nice atmosphere and pretty good food! Great people!
Tom N.,Houston  TX,0,148,18,1/2/2016,4.0,I was invited to eat here. The food selection was not that bad. My server was friendly and attentive.
Jordan W.,Houston  TX,161,214,12,5/16/2014,5.0,When I ate there I experienced great service and nice drinks when I tried a strawberry lemonade. I then tried a shrimp pasta entree and it was a great entree with the shrimp and flavors infused in it. Another drink I tried was a soda that reminded me of Kool-Aid. Overall this was a great restaurant and I would recommend this place to anyone who is in interest of great and tasty food.
Cassie C.,Katy  TX,211,59,18,7/26/2014,4.0,Definitely enjoyed this restaurant. It was my first visit. Our waiter was very good and attentive and gave us his best work. The beer selection is AMAZING!! I am a beer fanatic and this has a full bar which makes this place that much better. (: I will recommend this place to others in the future.
Emre C.,Houston  TX,8,47,3,9/1/2012,4.0,Your typical Bjs. Service has been good the three times I've been here. A little better than your average chain as far as atmosphere goes  great for large groups or social gatherings. If you've never been here  the Pizookie cookies are amazing for desert. The pizzas are the same quality as pizza chains like Papa Johns or Dominos or w/e. The presentation is much better though and you can easily share a medium pizza with two people  or even three if you don't feel like stuffing yourselves.
Rate T.,Houston  TX,0,17,1,10/20/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I tried to give this place another chance a year later. Still such slow service. I won't be giving it another chance. Also as a weird side note  the waiter was REALLY dirty and was sweating like crazy. We were his only table so I'm not sure what was going on? Gross.
Chris S.,Houston  TX,205,227,107,4/19/2010,4.0,Being that it's closer to my side of town i dont visit here too often b/c it's just that good. Expect it to be crowded here on the weekends and sometimes during the week. Reading the menu will give you too much to choose from  an aid to picky eaters. A selection of salads  pasta  burgers  pizza any way you desire to devour  and great grilled chicken dishes. BJ's has everything from bar snacks to filling entree's proven to satisfy. I've been here well over ten times and have never had a bad experience. Attentiveness of the staff gives a welcoming vibe every time. Haven't been to the other location  but in Willowbrook size matters. It can host large groups comfertably. Hard enough to decide what to eat. I've had nachos for an app  shrimp alfredo pasta  and that eruptive cookie mountain ice-cream dessert dish that smothered everything i've already put down. My stumoch wasn't as happy as my taste buds  but the taste buds always win.Then there's the drink menu. Ya know it's a big menu when they have a separate book to look thru. Cocktails  wine  mojitos  and beer brewed in-house and imported. Drink enough and all of those big screen tv's will go from HD to blurry in a hurry. One of my favorite restuarants in the city  n'joy.
Richard B.,Fort Worth  TX,4,9,13,11/18/2014,4.0,A solid late night food choice and good selection specialty craft beers.
Melissa A.,Atlanta  GA,0,53,,12/16/2014,2.0,Food wasnt that good but they have a huge variety of foods. Lots of beer on tap but really that was about it. Its always packed too  not really worth the wait.
Nate G.,Magnolia  TX,63,3,,12/10/2013,5.0,I love this place! Food is delicious  service is wonderful and the in house beer to choose from is so good. Me my wife and my son are dinner there a couple nights ago  my son was getting a little uneasy being a 2 year old. The server on his own walked up and have him a little snack bag of gold fish. PERFECT held him over till the meal got there!We will most definitely be returning.
Mishel F.,Houston  TX,3,17,38,3/18/2014,4.0,I searched salads and this place was one of the options. I found a few things I may have wanted for dinner on their online menu. When I got there  I had to park in the back because there was no available parking. I walked in and the greet was awkward. Almost like they were forced to greet me. Mannerisms speak loudly. The place was packed. I was seated in a dining area in the two seater booth. My waitress came about ten minutes later to take my order. It was a fair wait because the menu was huge. When the waitress greeted me  I told her it was my first time there. I told her I was interested in the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos. She said it was great. So I paired it with a Chardonnay and a house salad. I asked for no cheese on the salad and it came immediately with no cheese (the little victories). Perfect size before meal-not too much and not too little. I should've asked for dressing on the side  because it was a bit much. It didn't matter so much because I was hungry. In the midst of my salad  my entree arrived by a new server who was just as nice as the waitress. She asked if I had everything I needed. I mentioned I was waiting on my glass of Chardonnay to be delivered. She went to to check on it. Within the minute  my beautiful glass of wine arrived. Served was two pita tacos and a relish type looking side with beans  corn  seeds  quinoa  oil and spices  cucumber  green peppers  cilantro and barley. There was also a yogurt based sauce for the tacos. The tacos included grilled chicken  feta cheese  cilantro and maybe some veggies. The pairing of Chardonnay was perfect! With a packed restaurant  that has been the best service and food I have had since moving here four weeks ago. Outstanding service was provided to a complete single stranger in town for business. I didn't feel judged or ignored. I will definitely be returning because the service was excellent.
Jenna D.,Fleming Island  FL,28,97,50,4/1/2014,3.0,Good place to eat. Nothing is very memorable here though besides the bruschetta appetizer. Kinda has the sports bar feel to it. Still trying out their menu and nothing has become my favorite yet so I'll update later.
Jason S.,Houston  TX,1,75,,3/11/2014,4.0,This place is one of my favorite places to eat. They have a very diverse menu  and most things range from good to excellent. The pizza is fantastic. The pulled pork sandwich is divine. Fish and chips used to be a go to dish as well. I've had the angus beef sandwich which is very tasty too. My wife loves their pastas and lately has been eating the chicken tortilla soup. The kids really love the boneless wings and all the sauces.They have an amazing selection of beer on tap (including one from Stone Brewery which I love to death  St. Arnold's Endeavor and Karbach's Hoppadilla). They also have a huge selection of Belgian bottled beer. The BJ beers are all excellent as well as the brewed root beer  cream soda  etc.As for service  they tend to be top notch.The one complaint I have is  everyone else seems to like it too ... it gets very busy at peak hours.
Paisley A.,Houston  TX,0,5,,11/10/2015,5.0,Seriously  what is not to love about this place?! The food is always amazing and service is great. I can never resist ordering the Oreo pizookie for dessert... My favorite!
Pamela H.,Houston  TX,56,65,156,10/26/2012,4.0,There is a wide selection on food. The enlighten dishes are really good. Santa Fe salad is one of my favs as well as the tapas dishes. Yum. Pizza is amazing. They have a great selection of beers many are there. They are a micro brewery. They do have St Aronlds brewery making most of them now since they do not have enough tanks to supply all their restaurants. They have a happy hour but its only in the bar area. Service is great and some times is horrible depending on who your waiting on you. It is loud with all the people plus the music is too loud. There is no outdoor seating like the one down by Bay Area.
Scott M.,Houston  TX,114,115,32,1/9/2012,3.0,"Yogi said it best. ""Nobody goes there anymore...it\'s too crowded"". I\'ve never been here when there wasn\'t a wait and the bar wasn\'t elbows and asses jammed.I always wonder why that is too.They seem to have a great staff. Service has always been good. There is nothing particularly memorable about the food  although their skinny fries are very solid.This last trip I had the baby back ribs. Tender yes  flavorful no. A little on the dry side too.Good beers  decent wine list  cool bar  and food that is average. BJ\'s is like a watered down gastropub. If they were really good the crowd would be impossible. Must be a location thing."
Suneel C.,Houston  TX,48,69,30,2/9/2013,4.0,Typical chain restaurant... I don't know what the reviewers here expect! Lunch specials are great... beer is good... service is the roll of the dice. Nothing more that really needs to be said.
Nicole H.,Dallas  TX,324,528,235,8/28/2012,4.0,BJ's is always a good bet for solid food and good drinks. I've been to this one a few times now  mostly for lunch  and the service is also solid and even when crowded  we haven't had to wait long for a table. I consider BJ's a step above a place like Chili's  with better food and atmosphere  but still with decent prices.
Peter C.,Dallas  TX,512,167,1374,1/17/2010,4.0,"I came here to watch the Cowboys/Vikings Game. This place is the BOMB BEEZY!! As the waitress took us to our table  I couldn\'t help but look at other people\'s food. It got me really anxious to sit down and order. This place kind of reminds me of Cheesecake Factory for some reason.If you look at my pictures  you can see what I ordered and don\'t make the same mistake I did and get the deep dish. The small was $10 and I thought to myself ""I could have just ordered from Pizza Hut and got a large deep dish for the same price!"" Don\'t get me wrong  the pizza was delicious  the price was just a little too much for me. Overall  I plan to come back again to sample other dishes. Reason for the 4 star is the pricing."
Britni G.,Sugar Land  TX,107,40,4,10/12/2012,4.0,If you are a root beer lover... You have to try theirs. They make it in house and it's amazing. The beers they brew are also very good. I particularly like the hefe. Appetizers are all very good. The spinach artichoke dip  wings  flat bread... All wonderful. If you are a salad person... Which I am... They have awesome salads. But if you like the heavier stuff... Which I also like... Wonderful pizzas. And lastly....if you like sweets .... Bazookie! A warm gooey cookie in a pizza pan served fresh from the oven. With ice cream.
Jennifer D.,McKinney  TX,0,37,2,7/7/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I received a reply toy first review of BJ's from a Tiffany a supposedly a representative . After two calls to her per her request   I have received No Redponce. Wow not really surprised after my experience at the Resturant.
Christy P.,Houston  TX,179,700,22,9/29/2009,4.0,I really love this place. What I do not love  is the insane wait to get a table. I would love to just sit at the bar sometimes  but that too  is way too packed. Last time I called ahead to put my name on the reservation list and they told me 30 mins. I show up 30 mins later  and they tell me that people answering the phone were quoting incorrect times and that it'd be 30 more mins. I left. :( not.cool. As someone else also mentioned  the seating is kinda awkward  especially if you go there with 1 other person. Usually end up with a big circular booth to yourselves  so you have to huddle up next to each other to talk  which could be a good or bad thing  depending on your date. ;)Anyway  on to what I do LOVE about this place is the FOOOOD! Obviously. The have so many great appetizers to pick from that I almost prefer those over the main courses. The thin crust appetizer margherita fresca pizza or the one with sausage are really tasty. They've revamped these appetizer pizzas lately  too  so instead of a small little circle of pizza you get a long rectangular plate of crispy cheese tastiness. I also tried their new thai shrimp lettuce wraps and they were GREAT! Good sauce  good shrimp  nice leaves of butter lettuce...they just fell apart when I tried to eat them. These are appetizers though  mind you.Also really love their california grilled chicken sandwich. Green chilies  avocado  melted pepper jack  what's not to love? I won't review every food I've eaten there  but I can honestly say that everything I've eaten there has been delicious. And you should try a pizookie (picture a big warm  fresh cookie in a tin with a generous scoop of ice cream) and a beer or the berry cider (for the ladies who don't like beer) if you go. I have never met a pizookie I didn't greatly enjoy...even the ones I initially turned up my nose at ended up being good. Ok  enough said. :D
Alicia J.,Austin  TX,136,303,14,8/9/2011,4.0,I feel like I've had an abnormal amount of gluten free pizza lately  but I'm just making up for lost time. I'm just thankful people are offering it now. BJ's isn't the best GF pizza I've had  but it certainly isn't the worst. (Looking at you  Austin's Pizza.) Bonus points to them for brushing an herb butter of some sort on the crust before baking  and for what looks like herbs mixed into the actual crust as well. Now there's something you don't find often in a gluten free crust.All of my love and all of my kisses for that gluten free pizookie  though. It's not often you find a GF item on the dessert menu that isn't flan/creme brulee/ice cream/sorbet and it was DELICIOUS. My co-diners said they couldn't even taste a difference in the cookie  and it was soft  gooey  and fresh-out-of-the-oven delicious when served.The best part of this dining experience (for me) was that I didn't have to ask if they had a gluten free menu. All GF items were clearly labeled and even advertised in the standard menu. I don't like people fussing over me or paying special attention  so being able to flip through and order from the same menu as everyone else was a really nice touch. Kudos to BJ's for giving me the best chain restaurant dining experience of recent memory!
Michelle N.,West Hollywood  CA,927,245,1930,4/1/2010,3.0,I was in Houston for ONE day for business and my clients wanted to come here. They are 2 middle aged ladies who most likely have a limited palate so they chose this place for our business lunch. Go figure..The restaurant is located in a very nice area - hello! Willo Brook! I'm from Dallas and I even know about the area. We walk in around 1 and the place is full of people in business attire. Yep... just as expected. It wasn't too crazy and there wasn't a wait. This BJ's looks like any other BJ's I've been to but I like it. BJ's are always clean and kept up. I open the menu and found new items on the menu! I decided to go somewhat healthy and ordered the Salmon Teriyaki dish. The menu indicated it was served over STICKY white rice. Hmm.. ok? Portion was just right for lunch.... BUT the entree itself was ok. They give you plenty of salmon so be happy to hear they don't skimp out on that. It was the sauce! Omg.. it was too sweet  salty  and thick for me. I was to the point where I was looking for rice where the sauce had not touched it yet so I could tone down the taste. Also  the rice is not sticky.. it's not just normal white rice. Or maybe its sticky because of the sauce?? *shrugs*Overall... the food is okay. I don't hate it but I don't love it. The menu is humongo so you should always find something you're in the mood for.
Keith B.,Houston  TX,1,52,,5/21/2015,4.0,This is the only location I've been to but the food is usually very good and the service to match. It depends as with any restaurant with how busy they are but usually it's great. The menu is a bit overwhelming at first but once you skim through it usually you have an idea of what you want to order. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for something new. The atmosphere is great and the food as well.
Emily A.,Miami  FL,25,46,56,3/8/2014,5.0,I had an excellent chicken Parmesan that was juicy and tender - the waitress was pleasant and sweet and thoughtful and she smiles frequently  which was nice. The first time I went to this restaurant was in Miami and I had deep dish pizza that was decent but.not fabulous. This time I got Parmesan chicken with cheddar mashed potatoes that were really yummy. Plus my green beans were cooked perfectly. Very nicely done BJ's!!!
Ruben Q.,Florence  KY,1,28,3,5/10/2014,4.0,Pretty dope place  the avocado egg rolls Are by far the best appetizer I've ever had  I usually get them with ranch instead for the sauce they come with it fits the salty taste way better. Hard to go wrong here sweet pig pizza is awesome. They will customize pizzas too.
Jessica H.,Houston  TX,0,20,,7/17/2014,4.0,I love this place! Im a huge fan of their chicken caesar salad! My boyfriend and I went their for lunch and we both got a dessert and our bill was only $25  thats GREAT in my book! Im also a member of their rewards program  so for every dollar I spend I get a point and those points get you great rewards. I love this place  I always end up having my birthday dinners and other special occasions here. The only down side is I've experienced both AMAZING waiters and absolutely terrible ones. However  the great ones always outshine the bad ones  and the food is still GREAT!
Stacey L.,Magnolia  TX,0,21,4,11/8/2015,2.0,Once upon a time I loved to eat at BJ's  the food was great  but lately  the last few times I've gone the food has gone downhill. The avacado egg rolls use to be my favorite but the last couple times they have been mushy & not sealed or wrapped very well  and end up as just big mess all over my plate. I also got the siracha chicken bacon Mac n cheese. IT WAS TERRIBLE!! $13 for a Mac n cheese made with powdered cheese!! I thought it might be just me  so I had the other 3 people at my table try it  they said the same thing  you could taste the powder  it was gross. And no idea where the siracha came in  it had no spice to it at all. I'm not sure if they got new chefs or what but the quality of the food is just terrible. Last time I got a burger  no flavor to it what so ever  it was just a burger  5 Guys is 1000 times better & way cheaper. The beer selection is the ONLY reason they got 2 stars from me.
Thierry T.,Houston  TX,143,188,324,1/9/2012,4.0,The food here is trendy. People come here for American food  but mostly for their brewery. They make their own beers. But one thing I hate  is that the wait is too long on a Friday night. Often times  you have to wait for more than an hour to be seated. The ambiance is hip. they have a huge bar and they have a lot of booths surrounding the bar. Service is often very friendly.
Hillary B.,Houston  TX,0,11,1,4/29/2013,1.0,"I ate here with family yesterday at 2 pm. I am absolutely disgusted with how a simple mistake was handled with the food. Besides being slow (nearly 40 minutes to be seated...well over the 10-15 minute quoted wait time) and having to ask five people for silverware  I had the pleasure of our waitress trying to cover up a burger having cheese instead of getting the kitchen to remake me one without cheese. I had ordered a burger without mayo or dressing (the menu lists a hamburger completely separate from cheeseburgers) and when it came  I checked o make sure it had no dressing. To my surprise  I saw globs of yellow in a corner - it looked like morons had stuck cheese on the burger and then pulled it off when they realized it wasn\'t supposed to have it on there. Absolutely disgusting. I brought it to her attention and she took it back to the kitchen - I figured that I\'d get a new burger...yeah  no. Two minutes later  she\'s back with the burger  claiming it\'s ""new"" (I know it takes longer than two minutes to cook that...and taking food from other diner\'s orders to correct a mistake is rather uncool). Nope. She lied. It was the EXACT burger with a corner cut off. How gross. So customers can\'t get what they order and when mistakes are made  get the mistake poorly covered up instead of new food? To make matters worse  on the other side of the patty  there\'s tons of cheese bits. I get the actress again and tell her that its the same burger and there\'s still cheese all over it. I told her I am allergic to cheese and she\'s arguing with me that it\'s ""meat juice"" not cheese. Yeah  no...I know what cheese looks like. Finally she takes it back and I eventually get a burger made correctly. Nothing\'s comped  I\'m disgusted by the way the food was handled (touching MY food that I\'m supposed to eat to cut a chunk out instead of getting a new meal made????)  and I\'m annoyed over how rude/lazy/incompetent our server is. I wish I had spoken to a manager  but I didn\'t want to make a scene and I just wanted to get out of that place. I don\'t understand how someone can mess up like that and then argue with me over it. I rarely eat here and now I have more reason to avoid this place."
Michelle H.,Houston  TX,518,662,673,11/28/2011,4.0,Very good. Love their flat bread pizzas. They also have a jambalaya and cajun pasta that's really good too.
Melinda A.,Houston  TX,41,24,12,7/8/2013,3.0,This place to me is just ok.  We mainly go for atmosphere and the husband likes the beer. I find the menu way too extensive and I always have a hard time figuring out what I want... I prefer the lunch menu. The quality of the food is inconsistent. I once had pork chops that were completely dried out. I do like the shrimp and chicken lettuce wraps. A nice thing is you can call ahead for seating... this place is always packed.
Allyson A.,Cypress  TX,213,681,26,11/22/2011,4.0,Mini pizzas are tasty and go great the a beer. Half off on Sundays while the games are on. My favorite is the grilled ham and cheese sandwich with tomato bisque soup. Yummy!!
Mike D.,Houston  TX,0,7,,5/25/2015,2.0,"Good food  poor service. Really sad. Waiter apologized three times for the ""delayed service"" which was just him. Other tables were grumbling as well so maybe it was just his section."
Nicolle R.,Houston  TX,0,6,2,2/21/2014,5.0,Love the beer!! Andres the server was excellent  great beer suggestions. I suggest trying the California Club flatbread it's delicious!!
Eric W.,Tomball  TX,0,8,,5/15/2014,5.0,Their deep dish pizza is okay. This place is a little bit overpriced for a slightly upgraded American restaurant. Only eat here if they are having their gift card deal. At least that way you can get something out of it.You know what I change my mind. Their pazookies are delicious and warrant 5 stars.
Vicente A.,Houma  LA,18,7,5,7/6/2013,5.0,Went here and i got the best BJ ever i was so happy my eyes were popping out of my head..Be sure to get the 10$ special!!
Harold H.,Houston  TX,26,12,,1/11/2012,1.0,Lunch time meal was horribly gruesome!!! Grandson's kids meal: How do you ruin a kids Mac and Cheese? Dry and not edible by a two year who loves Mac and Cheese. Papaw's Meal: Fish taco of questionable fish origin despite what the menu says.. The tacos was more cabbage then the over cooked fish stick in the tortilla. Nana's meal: 1/2 Turkey sandwich was made with hard bread that fell off the sandwich into pieces as she tried to eat it and served with greasy fries. BJ's used to be our go to place  but after this lunch fare today not anymore. A $37 lunch that was just a waste of money and a waitstaff that must have been trained to ask you every 5 minutes is everything alright.The only reason it got one star review is because we all had a salad that we could at least eat. Otherwise I would have given BJ's zero stars.Yuck!
Denis C.,Houston  TX,197,331,221,1/16/2011,4.0,I used to go the my local BJ's back home in Long Beach  It's small  comfy and usually never has a wait. This place here in Houston is huge and almost always has a wait. So plan your day around when you want to come; but that can be said in general about FM 1960 and the Willowbrook Mall. I recommend parking on the Whiskey River side of the parking lot  there's usually plenty of spots there if you don't mind walking about 50 yards.Back home  I'd usually stick to just the deep dish pizza  but since moving here  I like exploring the rest of their menu. Their salads are good; can't go wrong with fish and chips and their teriyaki chicken dish is awesome. I try to stay away from their chicken sandwiches as they usually disappoint me. No matter what you do  always leave room for a pizookie! Overall  I enjoy the food and the service staff rock. I usually drive to the restaurant but leave the driving home to my wife. The beer is good and their seasonal selections are worth trying. The Grand Cru is a strong Belgian-style ale that is served in a small glass (10% alc for those thinking about throwing down a few). The Irish Root Beer and Sangria(s) are also excellent.The only downside is the wait  but that happens everywhere in in Houston starting at 5pm  Friday-Sunday. So chill out at the bar with a brew. Oh...and about the floor near the bar/restroom. It's slick like a bowling lane so if you don't want to look like Bambi doin' the splits  be careful.
Emma S.,Houston  TX,8,16,3,7/30/2014,3.0,I went to meet some friends for dinner and it was suggested we go to BJs. It was a Wednesday night at around 8am and very busy. We waited only a short amount of time  enough to get ourselves a drink at the bar. I was happy to be seated at a booth as the tables looked uncomfortable. Our waiter came over with waters while we looked at the menu. We ordered the calamari as an ap which was pretty good  nothing special. For my entre I ordered the chicken fried chicken. It was suggested by the waiter as I was in two minds to get that  or the fish n chips. I was somewhat disappointed at the taste. It wasn't bad by any means  but just lacked real flavor. It tasted as thou it had been cooked in old oil and wasn't seasoned enough. The potatoes were good thou. I would say this is a great place if you want a nice dining experience without paying the $$. It is very affordable. My plate was around $13. It reminded me of cheddars. Maybe a slightly more upscale version. I would go back but it would not be my first choice.
Olivia K.,Houston  TX,403,363,319,11/6/2012,3.0,For a chain brewhouse restaurant  it's pretty good. It's a typical chain with the menu and food preparation  which explains why you can only find them in the suburbs of Houston. Personally  I'm not a fan of chain restaurants because they lack originality and uniqueness. I met a blind date here  so it wasn't my choice to drive to the suburbs to eat here  but I was pleasantly surprised. I don't think there was anything outstanding about the food  but it was prepared well with no problems. I'm just not a fan of oversized portions of typical American bar/restaurant food.I'm not a beer drinker and it was too early in the day for me to start drinking  so I opted for one of their in-house crafted sodas and it was amazing! For beer lovers  they do keep St. Arnolds on tap in order to keep the locals coming back  but still offer a full bar as well as bottled beers.The decor is dark and warm with a very swag cigar-smoking type feel  minus the actual smoke. I sat at the bar instead of sitting in the main dining area. I always enjoy sitting at the bar as a means of feeling like there is a different ambiance than being seated amongst the overwhelming number of families that use the main dining area. Being childless means that I'm not tolerant of your screaming baby behind me while I'm trying to eat and carry on a conversation.The hand crafted root beer alone was worth returning  but I may pass on having an actual meal and stick with an appetizer or one of the indulgent cookie desserts.
Mary K.,Spring  TX,25,93,9,8/16/2013,4.0,All I can say is YUM! Must try  and don't forget to save room for the pazookie!
Daniel L.,Katy  TX,7,31,1,11/13/2012,3.0,I like the pizza  their beer was OK  would rather have a St. Arnolds  the atmosphere is nice  But I am not impressed with the staff. We have been a few time and one time they were more interested in getting us out them keeping us there. Another time our waiter disappeared never to be seen again. Now I understand that people need to leave sometimes  but you would think him or the Manager (who was walking around   mind you) could say something. I will probable not go back and eat there  but I would pick up a pie from there to take home. If you have not been there I would say try it for the pizza just don't get made if you are ignored.
Laurie S.,Tomball  TX,265,129,8,10/11/2010,4.0,I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants  but of all chains  I have to say this is one of my favorites. The selection of beer is awesome  and their menu has tons of options.  I always have a hard time deciding because everything sounds so amazing to me!I took my mom here for Mother's Day  and she has wanted to come back several times since then because of their french dip sandwich.  I hate to say that I've never had their pizza  but it always looks absolutely divine. I just have that inner turmoil of what to order  and the pizza hasn't prevailed yet!Parking can sometimes be a PITA  but never impossible.
Mark M.,Houston  TX,0,245,1,5/19/2011,3.0,I rarely eat here  but always enjoy it. Their draft beer selection is quite good  and their deep-dish pizza is some of the best in the area. Service has always been prompt. Not cheap  but food value is good. Can't speak to the rest of the menu  though it looks good...
Laura K.,Houston  TX,13,40,,9/22/2010,4.0,Let me start by saying I traveled far to get to BJ's... well from inside the loop anyway... all for some gluten free pizza. Was it worth it?? I'd say so! Some friends of ours live near BJ's and go often. On a recent trip they noticed the GF pizza and immediately called me of course.So how was it?? Excellent! The gluten free pizza is a thin crispy crust that tastes exactly like regular thin crust pizza to me. I ordered mine Hawaiian style and hubbs opted for sausage and peppers. Both were perfectly prepared. GF pizza often has a tendency to not be properly browned but the BJ's pizza did not suffer from that problem. The price point was excellent and the staff was soo friendly! In short  we'll certainly be returning but not too soon considering the drive.
Alexander T.,Houston  TX,35,521,207,7/24/2008,2.0,Although I recently had been to a different BJ's  something about the service here left me wanting more. We had a large party (around 60) and they asked to confine us to several tables  even though we had more people then previously reserved. Service was very slow  and the happy hour wasn't impressive when you are buying 8 dollar drinks (it is okay for 3.50 drinks @ original prices) but if you want any of their 'specialty' drinks you are paying 7 dollars after tip per drink. I would give them 3 stars  but the service here was atrocious for a thursday night. I saw waitresses walk around with food asking people if they had ordered plate whatever  because she had no idea where to take it  as well as bartenders giving us attitude because we walked to the bar to get drinks since our waiter was being too slow.
Carrie H.,Houston  TX,22,11,,8/5/2011,4.0,Went there a couple months ago  it was nice...loved my BIG salad and those avocado egg rolls are to die for. In my inbox this morning is a promotional for Party for Two. This sounds like exactly what my hubby and I would enjoy  so we are going back tonight to see if it is 'all that'...and get a margarita or mojito 'cause its payday Friday! Woohoo!!It was a great dinner  will be back for this special deal (and another mojito!). He had a wedge salad  I had a house salad and we shared the all meat pizza and a peanut butter pizookie. He went nuts on the pizookie idea and was hard for him to share it...going to have to make this one at home I am told. It was tasty! Need to have a kid-free zone though..
Sara L.,Houston  TX,6,66,10,4/25/2013,5.0,So far so good. Been here twice and both times have been a great experience. The food is great. The drinks are great. The service has been great. MY favorite was the dessert! Highly recommend the white chocolate pizookie!!!!! It was to dieeeeee for :)
Aliza R.,Spring  TX,69,14,5,9/14/2013,4.0,Love the pizza here. The Great White is a fave!!! Fun place for a quick bite before a movie or even out with the kids!! And if you have room - a pazookie!! Their house brewed beer is very good too!!They seem to have some good happy hour deals - can't wait to try those out!
Michael O.,Houston  TX,0,11,1,1/7/2015,2.0,Went during lunch on a weekday. The service and the food was very slow  and the quality of the food did not make up for it.
Mathew N.,Austin  TX,28,63,6,6/13/2013,4.0,Fairly pleased with what I experienced. Our waitress was very nice and having witnessed her deal with customer complaints she still had a good attitude about it  although she did enjoy sharing her stories with us. I had the pulled pork burger and my friend had a shrimp scampi. In all the food was fairly decent although if I were to nitpick  the sauce was overbearingly sweet as was the dessert which was the white chocolate raspberry cookie with icecream on top. But it's dessert from a chain restaurant so I should've expected so. In all the experience was very entertaining and I would definitely return with company.
Peter C.,Chicago  IL,27,132,3,3/6/2011,4.0,Excellent homemade brew (try the pirana pale ale or the jeremiah red). The avocado egg rolls are amazing.The place seems to be always busy. You can't make reservations  but they let you call a bit in advance (ten or so minutes before you arrive) which helps.
Alan P.,Sugar Land  TX,6,58,1,6/10/2011,3.0,MMMM!! ordered a large buffalo pizza and a fried butterfly shrimp with fries. Shared it with 2 other friends. Buffalo pizza was awesome. Really tasted like hot sauce. Shrimp and fries were good. I like how skinny they make their fries. It's unique and fun to eat. I give BJ's a B+
Laurie S.,Houston  TX,15,14,,8/28/2013,4.0,This place has a great menu and the servers are always on the ball. My husband loves to go there for the brewed beer and fish and chips. I love the BBQ salad. Pretty much always a wait  but worth it.
Edward M.,Houston  TX,31,88,3,1/22/2013,4.0,1-8-2013 Wife and I went here a couple of times. The burgers are off the chain. We really enjoyed them. I also enjoyed the Shrimp Tacos. The service is great. Pint of Blonde was good and cold. The RR are very clean. Which is a plus. This place is useally busy. Next time I'm going for the Pizza looks good. Nothing bad to say about this place.
Kari M.,Houston  TX,221,517,724,9/8/2010,4.0,Went on a Labor Day evening with my entire family. There were 10 of us and they let us make a reservation about 3 hours before hand  which I thought was cool because they usually don't let people make reservations with that short of an advance.The drink menu was ridiculously huge. I didn't drink anything but water  but the first 4 or 5 pages are nothing but drink specials!I ordered the Honey-Chicken Salad and it was yummy! It had fresh egg slices and tomatoes. One of the best salads I've had in a while. We also had a deep dish pizza with everything on it. I had a bite of a slice. It was pretty delicious. I had a bite of my husbands bacon burger too....wow. That was not was I was expecting. I was really tasty and served on bread instead of buns.Our server was good on keeping my water full and bantered with us a lot. They even let us bring in homemade pies for my Dad's birthday. Pretty cool place!
Mai S.,Houston  TX,53,236,98,10/5/2010,3.0,I really like the Pizzookies from here. Get the classic chocolate chunk with vanilla icecream. Tasty.Food-wise. There's a pretty good cut of everything. The portions are big too. I never finish my meal.I like the Roasted Turkey Sandwich and the Gourmet Mac and Cheese is delicious. I love the steak cut fries too. I had the Pot Roast Sandwich before too and it was a little too salty for my taste. The pastas are ok but the garlic bread is great. The Garlic Parmesan Kettle Style Chips I would pass on. Kinda pricey for some chips in my opinion. The Mini-bruschetta is good though. I've had the potatoes too and they are good but nothing special. I think most people order the pizza from here. I think it's pretty good. I'm pretty boring so I order the Margherita pizza which is good.I tried the brewed root beer which again is okay.So  I like the margherita pizza  gourmet mac-n-cheese  steak cut fries and washed down with a root beer. Cheers!
Patrick G.,Houston  TX,285,6,,5/23/2011,5.0,Walked in on a lark. Boy was I glad I did.We were seated immediately  but the place was still well-patronized. The hostess was friendly and got to us immediately. Our server was a very friendly chap who had an encyclopedic knowledge of the menu  which was incredibly extensive.My wife had an excellent sex-on-the-beach  which she said was quite strong and delicious.The food was outstanding. She had the parmesan chicken and I had a personal artichoke and spinach pizza  which was just awesome.Everything came out fast  the server was a true professional  and I just can't wait to go back. It's a great place that I'd recommend to positively anyone.
Miss B.,Houston  TX,12,17,4,5/16/2013,4.0,"Stopped in here for a late lunch. I was a little disappointed that the lunch portions were so small. But hey  I guess that\'s why they are ""lunch portions"" to keep from over stuffing yourself. However  I like to eat so I\'m assuming I should have ordered a regular size meal. Anyway  went with my regular BJ\'s Cobb salad and yes  it was delicious. There wasn\'t a wait but considering the time I went. Friendly service; that\'s usually a hit or miss. Always been a fan of BJ\'s  espiecially the Pearland locaiton."
Maria S.,Houston  TX,10,36,5,5/21/2012,5.0,Avocado egg rolls + deep dish pizza. You will not be disappointed. And save room for a pazookie - the original chocolate chip is my favorite!
Sam S.,Houston  TX,0,9,6,9/13/2013,4.0,Te atmosphere is open  yet each table feels private enough. The food is delicious  and there are many options. While the lunch menu is reasonably priced  I feel like the other items are a bit too expensive. The drink menu is vast  even for non-alcoholic drinkers. The Facebook page always offers specials and there is a rewards program to get free food. Besides Marsala  I haven't enjoyed any of the waiters though. Food items are forgotten  refills take a long time  the waiters don't appear to be knowledgeable  and the hostesses act snobby. Of the past five times I've been there I haven't felt welcomed.
Laura L.,Houston  TX,6,33,,4/10/2012,4.0,BJ's is just a good dependable place to go to in the Willowbrook area. I have been here many many times and went again today to have a birthday lunch. Service was superb. Even though they are always so busy  the servers pay attention to the guests and the food is always what you expect. And at the end they brought a baby pazookie with a lit candle to the table. But they did not make fools of themselves by bringing other servers and everyone singing happy birthday. We sang ourselves  but a whispered version. Had fun!!!
Rho A.,Conroe  TX,25,4,3,6/9/2013,4.0,My husband and I ate here a few weeks back and it was our second time. We love it the creole jambalaya  Mediterranean pizza  pizooki and strawberry lemonade is always delish. We went to the location in the woodlands  tx and in pearland  tx and both times we were pleased. Even the appetizers are great we recommend the sampler.
Butters B.,Houston  TX,13,97,317,7/11/2012,3.0,Pretty good--Family friendly. Would like to try the beers. Had a good chicken Thai salad. The avacado egg rolls left something to be desired. Practically tasteless. Would go back to give this place another try.
Richard M.,Houston  TX,1,32,,1/2/2010,3.0,"If you\'re looking for a traditional brewpub type experience you\'re sure to be disappointed with BJ\'s Restaurant & Brewhouse. This is a chain where the food is just mediocre and the beer ...well the beer obviously is not their first priority. Houston is the home of Bud  Miller  etc.  if you want GOOD home craft brewed beer at a restaurant/pub you\'ll have to go to Austin or some other city for that.The interior of this place is set up very nice and open with a clean modern look. They have bar and restaurant seating offering table or booth seats. I\'m not really sure how they get away with calling this place a brewhouse since they don\'t actually make any beer at this location nor have I ever seen any working brewery equipment. As far as I know the beer served in their Houston restaurants is still contract brewed at St. Arnolds Brewery. They really need to change their name to ""BJ\'s Restaurant"" and just drop the ""Brewhouse"" altogether.I\'ve been here a few times and have had an opportunity to try a few of their beers (or should I say St. Arnold\'s beers). They have a list of beers they regularly stock and a few seasonal/specialties on tap. The beer is not bad but the prices are a bit outrageous  you\'ll spend the same for one beer as you would for a six pack at home. I\'ve had the BJ\'s PM Porter which is pretty good if you like really dark beer. Overall BJ\'s would be better off if they just offered a wide variety of craft beers that people are familiar with...Their menu is all over the place  from salads to fish to pizza to sandwiches/soups to tacos. The portions are pretty large but the food is only mediocre. As mentioned by others the avocado egg rolls are good. Stay away from the fish and chips as I found it to be very tasteless. I had the fish tacos on their lunch menu recently which was actually pretty decent (the fish is breaded and fried which I don\'t normally like). They serve a warm 5 inch diameter chocolate chip cookie with a scoop of ice cream (it\'s not an original but it is tasty).This place would be better if they focused on doing a few things really well instead of trying to serve EVERYTHING with only mediocre success.I\'d like to give this place two and a half stars but I\'ll go ahead and round up..."
Carl M.,Houston  TX,94,88,13,8/13/2012,5.0,Good pizza (not anything like Chicago deep dish)  but where they excel are in their homemade brews. All the food there is decent though.
Melissa N.,San Francisco  CA,31,164,1,6/2/2012,3.0,"came for lunch on a monday  it was crowded but not terribly so. the wait for a table for 4 was about 5 minutes. the host mentioned surreptitiously that if i asked the waiter for samples of the different beers  that they had to give them to me. i tried the jeremiah red; it was a little too bitter for me but not bad. i ordered the barbacoa tacos off the lunch menu for $5.95. i couldn\'t believe how cheap they were and that they were off the ""enLIGHTened"" menu boasting healthier choices. but when i received them  i understood why. they were TINY. like  nacho chip sized corn tortillas with a light smathering of barbacoa and a few bits of cabbage up top. it came with black beans and starvation. i was still hungry after my lunch. i also have trouble believing it\'s healthier other than the small size because the tortillas were drenched in butter which made the entire dish taste like popcorn. my friend  whose southern fried chicken and mashed potatoes dish also came off the lunch menu for $5.95  was disappointed too by how small her dish was. The chicken parmesan sandwich for $6.95 with fries is a nice filling portion however  wayyyy too much mayonnaise for them to claim any sort of healthy choice option there. i like BJs because it has a fun lively atmosphere and the restaurant always looks spic and span clean  but i think the quality of food is mediocre at best. i suppose my expectations are too high; it is just another chain after all. but maybe my real disappointment came from my table who didn\'t want to order a pizookie. i\'ll be back for that---just won\'t order from the lunch menu or i\'ll make sure to eat first before eating here..."
Cat R.,Olton  TX,0,36,15,5/5/2014,5.0,Really good food  a gluten free menu  and excellent and attentive service. We'll be back to this location for sure.
Lauren J.,Houston  TX,66,254,6,4/27/2009,4.0,This is the meeting place for myself and a friend of mine since it is about halfway between us. I could live on their Avocado Egg Rolls. I also enjoy their deep dish pizza  calzone and grilled chicken pasta. The portions are hefty and make great left overs.We have had a few quirky waiters  but hey.. who isn't a little weird sometimes..? Quasi personal sidenote: My friend left her number for our waiter (per my kind and slightly forceful request) and went on a date with him. awesome.
Melody F.,Houston  TX,137,229,126,11/20/2011,3.0,We arrived just in time! Went on a saturday night with a 4 year old and a 9month old. So the prompt seating was nice! Our waiter was new or not very smart or both. I am gluten free so like bj's for the gf pazookie. I tried their mint chocolate martini after explaining to the server he could substitute the goose for kettle. It has been done. Kettle is a potato vodka not wheat. I sucked that drink down it was fabulous! My husband ordered a delicious chicken rice and zuchinni meal. I ordered a soup and salad. No go on the tortlilla soup it was gross. Being a bartender I dont like dirty glasses and dishes on my table. There was no prebussing. Martini glass and dishes remained on table entire meal. Took a long time for food to come out. My whole family finished their meal before I even had a spoon for my soup. Waiter kept trying to joke about his crummy service. He never refilled our tea glasses  dirty dishes  food not right and kept forgetting to check back! I joked back and said the gluten free pazokie should make up for all the bad things. It did indeed. We all even the baby fought over the pazookie.
Thomas R.,Cypress  TX,0,18,,8/10/2013,1.0,"This place was quite busy so I assume the products they serve are decent enough  but I don\'t think I\'ll ever actually eat here. My wife and I tried to eat here this evening  but the hostesses wouldn\'t let us. We were told a 25 minute wait for the two of us  and after half an hour my wife checked on the wait and they admitted they forgot about us. No big deal  they said they\'d give us the next table so forgive and forget I say. Well  20 minutes later and after seeing many other people get brought to their tables  we had been forgotten about again. My wife angrily put our buzzer back on the hostess stand and said we were leaving and while we were walking out  we received a very catty  ""thanks and have a nice night"" on the way out. Absolutely disgusting behavior by the front of the house  they lost two good customers tonight."
Celso N.,Houston  TX,21,21,24,6/18/2012,5.0,Excellent place!! The artichoke appetizer is amazing!! Different kinds of beer and pizza  are you kidding me? This is heaven!!! Btw.. Pumpkin spice beer is one of the best beers I have ever had anywhere!!
Ashish K.,St Petersburg  FL,5,25,32,4/17/2012,5.0,There bjs brownie is a must try. It's served in the dish it is made.. Heavenly taste.
Clif W.,Houston  TX,97,23,2,3/30/2011,3.0,"A-Ok perfectly describes how I feel about BJs  and with gas prices where they are right now  I\'m sort of glad I don\'t have a desire to drive down here all the time. Its got a nice  generic restaurant feel and the food is definitely tasty. I agree with reviewer who said they should drop the ""Brewhouse"" from their name since they now contract out. Their beer is definitely enjoyable and decent  but like I said  nothing that is enough of a draw to get me out to BJs on a regular basis."
Muna M.,Nashville  TN,5,6,,2/23/2010,5.0,5 stars for a chain restaurant u ask? I can't help it. I just moved to Nashville TN and we don't have it here... So i miss it! :(I love their deep dish pizzas  the BJ's blonde and their avocado egg rolls. I order the exact same things every single time. Sometimes i go there just for their Avocado Egg Rolls.. They are the best!! I miss u BJ's!!
Michi A.,Houston  TX,18,27,12,5/28/2009,4.0,Hits-Avocado Eggrolls-Spinach artichoke Dip (although I don't think i've ever come across any I didn't like - so it's not that its just spectacular here  it's just that its yummy any where.) -Deep Dish Pizzas  BJ's Special and the BBQ Chicken were good. -Blonde beer  tart and refreshing-Open Late (a big issue out in the burbs. We went on a Sunday and they were open till 11 pm  unheard of!)Diss-Seating is wierd  uncomfortable. Either the booth is way too big or the tables are way to small with all that they bring out. Big plates  and pizza and such. -LOUD  but hey its a quasi sports bar
Gloria C.,Spring  TX,0,31,,11/14/2012,3.0,We ate at BJ's last weekend for the first time. I will say it was just a bit above okay. The appetizer we ordered was pretty good. I had a burger  I didn't think it was that great just ok. I did not like the french fries. My daughter ordered Salmon and it was a bit dry again  just ok. I think there will be a next time for us because we did like the atmosphere. Next time  I will try the Root Beer and Pizza.
Lindsay S.,Rowlett  TX,33,317,32,3/26/2012,3.0,I just ordered take-out when I was staying nearby. I liked the deep dish pizza  but it didn't settle well. When I went in to pick up the food  the place looked busy  so I have to believe it's a good place to go when you don't know where you want to go.
Stephany C.,Arlington  VA,26,24,,1/12/2012,2.0,I have no idea why this place gets so packed. The menu reminds me of Chessecake Factory but the food is no where near as good (and Cheesecake Factory is just above OK in my book). Don't waste your time waiting for a table  because every time you go there will be a wait. We had the stuffed mushrooms (rubbery) and the mini brushetta (I've had better) for apps. BF got the turkey burger  which seemed to me was just a frozen turkey patty from your local Krogers and I had the Angel Hair Toscana (noodles tasted like they were cooked in the same pan as an Asian dish). No need to return.
Rudy M.,Houston  TX,116,159,34,11/1/2009,3.0,"BJs is one of the best values for lunch in the suburbs IMO. The restaurant has a great lunch menu with a variety of choices. My favorite is the half sandwich and soup or salad option. The meal comes with fries! All that for about $8  you can\'t beat it. My only regret is that if you are on work time  you can sample the beers offered. Boo.Also  boo to the staff or manager who did not take ""tax exempt"" status when we fed our non-profit org\'s work group there. WTF? Most likely will not go there for work options again."
Ronald M.,Cypress  TX,0,5,15,2/18/2014,1.0,Where do I start? Let me say first that the food and service has always been very good. Brought my family here last weekend a party of 6 adults and 1 baby  told the hostess what we needed  that 2 adults & baby had not shown up yet they seated us in a large booth. When the rest of the party showed up we had already ordered drinks & appetizers she saw that we needed a high chair and said they are not allowed to have a high chair at the booth  that's fine but instead of reseating us at a open table they said it was spoken for & they were going to make us get up and wait on another table so we went and got the car seat and stayed in booth with car seat stuffed in between us. Now the food...we ordered beers everyone except one were brought their drinks  after 5 minutes we told waiter we were short 1 beer he said he would check after 5 more minutes we reminded him again he then said they were out of the brand ordered. At what point was he going to tell us!!!! Remember the appetizers I mentioned? We ordered a spinach artichoke dip and when it came out we grabbed some chips and were HORRIFIED!! To find an old dried up lemon wedge in the chips!!! Are they putting used chips back in the chip bin???!!! Do not know why at this point we just didn't get up and leave?? We we ordered burgers and steaks and nothing was cooked to ordered!!! Needless to say I WILL NOT!! Be back...WHAT HAPPENED??? Oh yeah they were not that busy when we went. If I knew how to rate them a zero I would!
Apr F.,Panama City Beach  FL,5,40,5,4/16/2012,3.0,Great food  great service  but manager sucked!! Our waitress constantly kept asking him to change it to a game... Took more than 5 attempts before he changed it... & to the wrong game  at that.. Terrible. But thank you so much to our waitress  she was great!
Lisa S.,Katy  TX,0,8,,4/14/2013,3.0,We eat here at least 4 times a month. usually good food/service. very disappointed on last visit. waiter was very inattentive...had to ask for drinks  to take our order etc... one of our dishes looked (and tasted) like the salt shaker exploded on it. I sent it back and asked for a salad thinking it would be quick and I'd be eating most of my meal with my companion. it took forever to come out and I wound up eating by myself. we had to even ask for the check and [unbelievably] while the sodium overloaded dish was taken off the bill  we were charged for the salad! We were floored. we left a $5 tip and our waiter should be happy he got that.
Ashley B.,Houston  TX,6,13,,3/31/2011,2.0,I went here for dinner last night we a couple of friends and it was very...Meh....the avocado eggrolls were really good. They didn't have much flavor by themselves but the sauce that comes with it makes the eggrolls pretty amazing. Other than that  not much else to report. The beer was pretty good but not great. I tried the Blonde and the Hefewiezen. We were corrected by the waitress that it is pronounced with a 'w' not a 'v'. I hate when people correct you with an incorrect correction. Anyways  I ordered the BJ's Favorite small pizza. It was loaded with toppings  which I loved! I went in for my second mouthful and was met with under cooked dough. I guess with all the toppings it is difficult to tell that the pizza was finished. I ended up just not eating the middle parts of my slices. The service was so-so at best. We sat a lot waiting for refills and silverware and other things that we needed. The price was ok. For 2 meals  2 beers and half of the appetizer it was a $40 bill before tip. There was pizza left over which was taken for lunch today. I can say that I won't go out of my way to eat here again but wouldn't not be totally against it if my friends  who live near here  wanted to meet up. The company makes it far more worth it.
Paul B.,Spring  TX,0,104,4,5/13/2010,4.0,I enjoy BJ's period  but this location is better than most. I've been twice recently and both times I've experienced excellent service. One of the waiters was named Stephen  and he is absolutely amazing.I particularly enjoy the Jambalaya  but pretty much everything is pretty good. If you save room for dessert  definitely try the pizookie: fresh cookie topped with ice cream. If you go on the weekend  expect a wait. This place is well known.The house beer is average. I'd go with a national brand  but that's just me.Flat screen tv's all over. Its a great place to watch sports  and eat some good food.
Ty D.,Spring  TX,1,29,13,2/18/2012,5.0,Great beer and food! Can be a wait to get in but worth the wait. Get the beer sampler if undecided on what to try. The palzookie is a must after dinner!
Stephanie F.,Spring  TX,11,10,,6/15/2012,4.0,This place is great. Always busy so sit in the bar area. Tuna appetizer is DELICIOUS. It's open late  and very laid back
Sarah H.,Magnolia  TX,68,84,62,6/29/2011,5.0,One of my new favorite restaurants. Great atmosphere  huge menu with something for everyone. Must try: their pizzas  homemade root beer  and the pizookie for dessert!! Great place to watch sports also  as big screens are prominent.
Crystal C.,Tomball  TX,11,118,7,8/5/2011,3.0,"A few nights before we went my friends started telling us all about this place  how they make their own root beer and how all the food is fantastic. I had a cream soda and my husband and sister had a root beer. We all ate and thought everything was good  but it wasn\'t like ""best ever"". I thought it was a little hard to move around  very bar like atmosphere  without the smoking of course. The food is much better than at a bar  but nothing I would go again and again to."
D.M. R.,Cypress  TX,80,116,4,1/10/2011,3.0,"We came here for a snack one Sunday afternoon. At 2 in the afternoon  we were surprised by a 20 min wait  however  we chose to sit in the bar and there was no wait. They also had happy hour specials since it was football season. $2 off all appetizers suited us just fine. I got some SW eggrolls and my hubby got 2 of the personal sized apps. He liked his little taco\'s  even though they came out incorrectly prepared. He asked for no tomatoes  they had tomatoes and when the waitress finally noticed  she asked ""if this was ok"" instead of saying she was sorry! Kinda weird. Nevertheless  they tasted good once he picked all the tomatoes out. My egg rolls were decent but not anything like the ones at Chili\'s  which are awesome."
Stephanie T.,Los Angeles  CA,66,95,,11/24/2010,5.0,I do a lot of theatre in the Willowbrook area and after a show  the cast usually likes to go out and get some grub and drinks. BJ is a favorite of ours becasue not only does the menu seem neverending  but I've never tasted any dish that wasn't absolutely delicious! Oh yeah  and the fact that they brew their own beer which is also delicious!! While I find the food and drink to be a little pricey  I find it to be well worth it. It is tasty and very high quality. The beer is actually a great deal. Any pint of their homebrew is $4.95 which is an average price anyway. I've tried quite a few of their beers and enjoyed every one of them!! Also  the staff is always friendly and accomodating. Especially since we usually have large groups late at night. Thanks for the great food and service BJs!!!
Mike J.,Memphis  TN,46,225,,2/2/2011,4.0,Went with a family unit including 2 year old SWDH. She  of course  was perfect the whole dinner through. As a result of her eating routine we went in at about 5:30 which seemed to be just ahead of the big crowds. We had an excellent booth with plenty of space for SWDH to entertain herself.I am not normally a fan of chains and BJ's is a pretty big chain. This is the first time I have been to one in a long time. First  I was impressed by the beer menu. Not only did they have a good selection of their own beers  but they had a really good selection of other beers  both draft and bottled. To be just a bit persnicketty  I would have liked it if they had an IPA in their beers.We started with a flatbread to share amongst the 6 of us. It was really good and there was plenty to go around. The menu variety was also very good  there were plenty of interesting choices. The pictures in the menu also looked very good. I selected a cuban burger. I ordered it cooked medium and the waiter didn't argue about that. It came cooked very nicely medium. It was very good. The fries were mediocre. Everyone else commented favourably on their food.Our waiter was good. The place was quite busy  but he managed to be on hand just about every time we needed him. He was cheerful but did seem like he was just barely hanging on.I found the price OK  maybe a bit high  but I suppose it didn't help that I ordered the most expensive beer they had on the menu.
Joe R.,San Marcos  TX,2,19,,4/25/2011,4.0,I've been to this place 3 or 4 times now and every time I'm back in Houston  I always try and make a trip here. Admittedly  most of the time I order a Piranha Pale Ale  New Orleans Jambalaya  and then split an Oreo Pizookie so I can't say I've had a wide selection of the menu  but it should say that they make a mean jambalaya. Everyone in my group is always satisfied with the food they get. It's a smidge on the pricy side but I don't mind as it's all very tasty. I may re-rate this to 5 stars if I ever decide to order something else and am equally pleased with it.
Sam V.,Houston  TX,149,375,20,2/18/2008,4.0,My days of enjoying the microbrew craze ended a long time ago. I think you could even correlate it with the closing of all the Houston microbreweries/bars - but I hope I was not the inciter of the demise of these places. One can only handle so many hops.But this place has staying power just because the menu is so good. American fare that has been cared for - they truly make it worth coming here for. The deep dish pizza is great and the kiddie menu  although simple  is excellent. The pasta dish I had recently here (with chicken alfredo) was bland  but almost everything else I've had here was very good indeed. Even their blonde beer is good (I am SO tired of how every microbrew has to be full of hops and this one is not). Service here has also always been attentive and fast every time I've visited.They also have a long bar with plenty of TV's to view a game  if that's your thing. So it can get loud in here when it fills up.
Andrew G.,Houston  TX,9,61,49,3/10/2012,5.0,ok i went there on saturday night at 10pm it was slammed but it's ok me and my wife waited 15 minutes at the bar so while we waited we drank a mirtini called strawberries confuzion it was real good and strong also when we sat down the restaurant was very busy but it did not bother me i oredered the texas fried steak it tasted real good and the side order was very stasty and my wife ordered the deep dish pizza with her own toppings the pizza was hot and tasted very good and during the time we ordered a midori super sour drink and man it is super sour but taste great and strong i love this place this is the very first time i ver ate at this restaurant me and my wife were very happy we went here i strongly would recomment this place to friends and family i would come back again again
Anthony B.,Houston  TX,59,146,,6/23/2008,4.0,I like going to BJ's to try a variety of their own brews  which here in Houston I understand are brewed under contract by our very own St. Arnold's. It's nice to see this brewpub successful when so many in Houston have gone under. It seems we like beer here  it just has to be Bud or Coors in tonnage  rather than 'taste'.Their menu stretches across a variety of ethnic items but often with an American twist. Service tends to be good but sometimes struggles when busy. Ordered food comes fairly prompt  and the waiters seem to know when you're babbling instead of ordering  and will take/place a salad or appetizer while you continue to yack and sporadically read the menu.BJ's does suffer from a common fault of too many restaurants - deafening when busy.
titus d.,Spring  TX,5,28,71,11/9/2010,5.0,90% of the menu is fantastic! If you're looking for a traditional brewhouse this is not it. Bj's does everything their own way. The deep dish pizzas are great and the pastas are scrumptious. And they are opening a new location in the woodlands tx. Try the jerry burst brew. It consists of half Jeremiah red beer and pear cider. Try everything on the menu EXCEPT the steak this is not a steakhouse. My favorite dish at Bj's isTuscan Chicken Limone  and the avacado rolls are a great appetizer.
Ash D.,Houston  TX,0,3,,8/22/2013,3.0,I love the food here  I have had many items off the menu and nothing to complain about. I have sat at the bar the last fee times and have enjoyed the atmosphere as well as the televisions. I have to say that this night is a little different with the red head bartender. She makes it a different experience. She seems to be doing good on the well for the employees but as far as the bar she seems to be blind to. Not very friendly nor is she helpful towards the other bartender. The other bartender has been helpful and made the experience worth the while. Maybe it was a bad night for her but kinda rude and unfriendly for a bartender. As for Jevan (the other bartender) he made up for her poor attitude. For the restaurant it's self I would say its worth a visit. Awesome food and environment.
Lacy S.,Elgin  OK,0,1,,8/7/2013,1.0,I usually love BJ'S brewhouse  but we couldn't even get seated. The hostess was so lazy  she was laying her head on the hostess station. She told us the floor was closing in five minutes and told us to sit at the bar. There were at least 3 bar tables that hadn't been cleared. We stood in the bar area for ten minutes and no one even acted like they were going to clear tables. I get that it is late  but at least you have a job. The establishment wasn't closing for an hour  but the servers seemed to be kicking people out.
Lacey D.,Houston  TX,135,76,34,5/12/2010,4.0,I love a good tomato soup and BJ's is the best mmm sourdough bread bowl. I'm not much of a beer person so I can't really appreciate this place like some of my friends do but! their mixed drinks are good  pricey  but good. They used to have one on the menu that tasted just like a caramel apple it was really sweet so thats probably why it got the boot  I liked it though! This last time I had Irish root beer which tasted just like root beer which was great  I loved it. This place really has a lengthy diverse menu sooo many things to choose no one should have a problem finding something they want.
Andrew M.,Houston  TX,8,181,,10/13/2007,3.0,Went here with a couple of my buddies for beer and some food. There was an alright selection of drafts  your best bets it try one of their own brews (which are brewed in Clear Lake). This place is supposedly know for its deep dish pizza  so I tried one. I was not terribly impressed  the dough tasted like something you would get from Pizza Hut and it was lacking in the sauce department. Overall  it was slightly better than a Domino's pizza. Good place for a beer  but I could give or take the food.
R V.,Houston  TX,0,10,,5/5/2013,1.0,"Ate here last night. The server was scatter brained  got our drinks after the appetizer. My glass was filthy  the inside had some greasy film on it. Speaking of greasy....the floor was slippery beyond belief  everyone was walking around like they were on egg shells. Told the server and his reply was ""that\'s why we wear slip resistant shoes"" 10 minutes later another server slips and falls with a full tray of empty dishes. The floor looked like it had months of grease layers on it. We couldn\'t eat in peace  the server kept asking if we wanted dessert 5 minutes into getting our pizza. All in all bad experience usually I have great service  food and atmosphere....tonight was not the night."
Janet W.,Spring  TX,13,12,2,11/5/2010,5.0,"Who said there\'s no such thing as a free lunch? Along with approximately 90 000 other people in the community  I was invited to sample the menu at new BJ\'s Restaurant & Brew house  renowned for its microbrewed beers and delectable manly portions. Facebook is abuzz with diners who have already been there.I was invited to accompany a good friend  Annette  and one of her other friends  ""Barb."" After exchanging greetings in the chilly parking lot  we entered BJ\'s to a warm reception where we were greeted by a very friendly hostess named ""Courtney"" who informed us that our server would be ""Allison."" A charming ""Austin"" appeared instead  which was certainly alright with us  and who good-naturedly went along with the joke  as we called him ""Allison"" for the duration of our meal. First  Allison (Austin) took the drink orders. Annette ordered an extra dry martini Stoli with extra olives. Talk about a \'call\' drink. I didn\'t know martinis could get that fancy. And blonde Barb ordered a Brewhouse Blonde. (Say that four times fast after drinking an extra dry martini Stoli with extra olives.) There were so many drink choices that I was confused  so Austin (alias Allison) appropriately suggested a Confusion... Hpnotiq  which is a blend of vodka  cognac  and natural exotic fruit juices including a strawberry puree  raspberry Stoli  and a splash of pineapple juice. Now that\'s a drink! After downing it halfway  I was even more confused  but convinced that I was drinking healthy.It was suggested that we each try something different from the menu  which is always more fun so you can graze from each other\'s plates. Barb ordered the Sweet Pig Pizza...a deep-dish pizza with ham  pineapple  and roasted tomatoes (ordering the smallest size.) For a pizza crust so thick  it was light as a feather. Incidentally  you can order your pizza gluten-free. Annette ordered the fish and chips. Being kitchen-impaired  I\'m assuming the fish was fried in a beer batter as BJ\'s certainly has enough beer on hand. It wasn\'t that cornmeal batter like everyone uses in this area of the country. It was a thin  crunchy crust over flaky fish filets. (I\'m not a food blogger  but I\'m actually beginning to sound like one.) I was glad Annette couldn\'t eat all the fries  so I could finish them off. Typically I never order fries because they don\'t have any flavor  but these were thick and delicious. I usually order something I would never be able to prepare  so I ordered the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo. You can order this grilled or blackened  and since I can\'t do either  I asked our server  Austin  to make a recommendation. The people who work in restaurants have usually sampled everything on the menu  so I value their opinion. He recommended the grilled chicken and assured me I would be pleased with it. I know  a lot of restaurants serve this dish  but not like the one I was served. The chicken wasn\'t in little chunks like you get out of can of chicken. It was slices of breast meat that were so tender  you didn\'t have to use a knife. I\'m not savvy enough to tell you what seasonings were used  but the chicken was seasoned to perfection. And there was so much fettuccine pasta left over  that I had enough for a \'to go\' box. While waiting for our meals we oohed and aahed over other menu selections that were being served up around us. The salads were beautiful  and the burgers were huge! This will definitely be the place salad lovers will frequent for lunch  and the brews and burgers will make this a \'guy\'s night out\' hangout.We opted for a desert instead of an appetizer  and unanimously agreed on the Pizookie. With my limited Italian  loosely translated means...a large cookie prepared like a pizza  thus Pizookie. It was half cookie with chocolate chunks  and half with white Macadamian chunks  topped with vanilla ice cream. Rarely eating desserts for lack of a sweet tooth  this dessert was a melt-in-your-mouth reward that really finished the meal off in fine fashion. In addition to a quality meal  one thing I especially appreciated was the quality control. Andrew  not to be confused with Austin (alias Allison) or is it the other way around. I\'m still confused  and I\'ve only had one Confusion. Andrew  the Quality Control trainer was following up on Austin\'s service  to ensure the 7 C\'s were being addressed: Community  Connection  Caring  Consistency  Control  Compassion  and Courage (an integral part of BJ\'s culture.) We suggested they add Charm and Charisma.With the exception of the alcoholic beverages  the meal was complimentary. If you please  a voluntary donation to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation is politely suggested  and would benefit a great cause. November 8th at 11:00 a.m.   is the official opening of BJ\'s. For more information about BJ\'s  visit bjsrestaurants.com Now that I\'m familiar with the menu  I won\'t be so confused when I return. I just hope they don\'t remove the Confusion from the menu."
Brandon J.,Tomball  TX,0,11,,12/6/2012,5.0,The food here is phenomenal! The menu is massive (literally 18 pages)  and everything I've ever had there was amazing. Couple the food with their own brews and decent prices  and you can't beat BJ's!
M B.,Houston  TX,0,50,1,6/17/2012,2.0,Went in on a Fri about 9pm. Had 7 in the party. Called ahead to get on list. Parking was a real problem. Had to eventually park next door. Said wait would be 25-30 min  but was only about 5. We almost left. Food was good as always but service was awful. Slow  slow  slow  and did not check on us at all. Very disappointed. We have always had a fairly good experience here  but not tonight. And  we had bragged on this place to our group we were with. Waiter also tried to have food passed down the table  by us  as opposed to serving each person as he should. May go back  but not sure.
Julia S.,Houston  TX,117,294,355,11/20/2009,2.0,Food is mediocre at best. Maybe a slight step up to Chili's. I ordered the Field of Greens salad with grilled chicken. Decent salad except for the pecan shells (yup  on verge of breaking my teeth a few times) and the salt overload. Who puts salt on a salad? I ended up not finishing my dish.
Robyn H.,Houston  TX,4,80,35,1/8/2012,2.0,Unfortunately I've had better experiences at other BJ's than the experience at this location. We were seated in a reasonable amount of time and the waitress was attentive (it wasn't the service or restaurant that was the issue)  but it was the food that was sub-par for what I am used to from BJ's. First  our salads arrived before the appetizer (minor inconvenience and easily overlooked). For an appetizer we ordered the potato skins. There was barely any cheese on them. I'm used to the nice cheesy cast-iron skillet of potato skins and apparently they've changed them to be more 'fancy'. This means they arrive nicely organized on a white plate with barely cooked bacon and no cheese. The ones with cheese tasted okay  but really the rest I took home so that I can add more cheese and eat them later. My Parmesan chicken was all right (the chicken was cooked nice and tender)  but the pork chop my husband ordered was like one of the those fake plastic food items you find in kids play kitchens. It was really thin and came with only 4 small red potato halves. Next time we'll avoid the pork chop. Maybe it was an off-night  but I expected better food.
Shannon G.,Spring  TX,0,99,2,11/22/2011,2.0,Food was excellent as always but server was pretty bad. We asked her for things and she didnt return with them. Nor did she act like we asked for anything when she came back. Sorry  but ive been to better ones so ill avoid this one.
C S.,Houston  TX,13,11,12,8/19/2011,1.0,I must say that I dine out quite a bit and have never had an experience as the one I had Thursday night while dining here. I came here to have drinks and dinner w/ a friend and while eating at the table I looked down to see a roach crawling on the top of the table near the attached wall. I was absolutely revolted  I couldn't eat any more  I called the hostess who was closest to me for her to see this and she said she would get the manager. Another 3 mins later the waitress came and said the manager was coming  and she was going to see if he was taking something off the bill. After another 4 mins of waiting the manager came over to apologize and said they spray often but sometimes the roaches still come out of the wood. He didn't offer to take care of anything on the bill even though we were clearly revolted. I paid my tab and went somewhere else for dessert. Based on this I don't see me EVER returning and I love bj's.
John M.,Cypress  TX,1,113,,3/21/2011,4.0,Agree with the latest reviews  this is a great place for an outstanding micro brew and lunch or dinner. Was there for dinner with some friends the other night and even though it was busy we got a table within 5 minutes. The host was great  telling us about the beers available and getting us settled. The waiter arrived in minutes and took our drink and appetizer order (pot-stickers and bruschetta  both outstanding). I had the BBQ sandwich with onion strings which was delicious and my friends had a spaghetti and specialty salad both of which received great reviews. Definitely a great corner spot for a nice meal
Jeff S.,College Station  TX,0,8,1,8/26/2011,1.0,"My wife and I went to BJ\'s for lunch one Sunday. I was pretty optimistic and excited due to the fact that it was a brewhouse and it always seemed like there were a crap load of cars in the parking lot. When we got inside we waited for approx. 20-30 mins. for a table  not a big deal. Once we were seated it took over 10 mins. for someone to come get our drink order and it seemed like it all went down hill after that. After the drink order was placed it took another 10 mins. to get our WATERS and somehow the appetizer we ordered with our drinks never made it to our table. Finally got our meals 45 mins. after sitting down and when I asked the waitress  Ashley I believe  where our appetizer was  she informed me that she forgot to put the order for it in. She then asked ""Is that ok?"" Well at that point it kinda had to be. We already had our meals and my pregnant wife finally had something to regulate her blood sugar.  No apology or any other form of compensation was made for this mishap which I prob. could have lived with if the food wasn\'t just mediocre at best. Definitely won\'t be eating there again..."
