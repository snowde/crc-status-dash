Bruce A.,Corona  CA,20,44,22,11/17/2017,4.0,Mini Sweet Pig Pizza is my favorite.Couple that with a wedge salad  and some appetizers = I'm quite full.No room for a Pazooki today.
Amado S.,Tustin  CA,0,7,1,11/21/2017,1.0,This review is based on ordering take out.Two nights ago I ordered boneless wings  avocado egg rolls  2 side salads and a pazookie. My girlfriend went to pick it up about 25 minutes later since they told us it would be ready in 25-30 minutes. 45 minutes later  I get a phone call from her that the food is still not ready. About 10 minutes later from that point  I get a call that she finally got the food and she was on the way home. We live literally 2 minutes from this location. When she got home  the wings and avocado egg rolls were soggy and cold. How were they like this if the food was not ready on time and we supposedly got the food right as it was prepared? To top it all off  the pazookie was burnt. I love BJ's and have never had a bad experience dining in  but their take out was terrible. It was a waste of my ~$35 because I tossed the wings  avocado egg rolls and pazookie in the trash. At least the ice cream was good..... guess they couldn't really mess that one up.
Anna K.,Irvine  CA,190,89,151,11/21/2017,3.0,Service was surprisingly awesome but the food was cold and sub-par. This was the first time I'd been to this location of BJ's but I've been to different locations countless times so I have an expectation of what the food should taste like and needless to say I was quite disappointed by the food. We ordered a pizza  steak  salads  and sliders and EVERYTHING came out room-temperature or cold. The Fries tasted like they'd been made hours ago and just heated up. The pizza tasted old as well. The only redeeming quality of this location of BJ's was that the servers were super friendly and nice. I'd definitely give this location another shot just on account of the good service... hopefully the kitchen was just having an off night... hopefully.
Debi R.,Irvine  CA,295,155,55,10/8/2017,4.0,My favorite trio: Chocolate Chip  Oreo  Peanut Butter Pizookies. The #1 reason I come here.Service is always good whether you're seated I'm the bar area or the restaurant.
Aaron E.,Orange County  CA,94,1409,2102,10/14/2017,2.0,Poor taste passed off as gourmet.It is a chain you have been to and you didn't care for it either. Sticky booths  screaming day drinking suburbanites  and fair weather football fans. All of that plus a terrible deep dish. I tried the Buffalo Chicken variety and you are 100% correct  I deserve what I got. The pie is all dough and no go. Dry and wood-tasting chicken breast chunks are combined with diced celery  red onions with a sloppy drizzle of ranch dressing  buffalo sauce and... well  that is the good part! The bad part is the 3/4 inch of too soft  almost mealy  doughy crust these things have going on. If this is an attempt at Chi-Town pie  BJ needs to actually go to Chicago someday because this is a disgusting attempt at a deep dish. Bleh. This pizza stings like a first divorce  or that first Newport... Whichever hurts you more. The second star is for having Stone IPA on draft and Famous Dave's is conveniently located next door. Moonwalk past BJ's.
Gus L.,Tustin  CA,210,76,54,10/31/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,The location is nice and clean. The employees are super nice and attentive to their guests. The venue is very open yet intimate. I do enjoy the layout. I've always liked coming to this location because the bartenders are extremely nice. I highly encourage others to come visit this location. The music isn't too loud which helps and allows you to keep a conversation. And they have tv sports going on at all times. James and Lisa the bartenders are just great
Durell B.,Irvine  CA,393,144,802,7/5/2017,4.0,This is the other corporate chain spot that I can get down with because they are consistent across the board (which is what chains shoot for  I know) but they have a GOOD consistency; which doesn't always happen with chains. While I have been to other locations  I am happy to report that this one is the closet for me and probably the best. The last time I was here was (7/2/17) with fellow Yelper Candice K and we had a good ole time. We sat in the bar area left hand corner  which had a great view of multiple TVs. Candice wanted to check out the Angels game and it was on the big screen. The staff is very accommodating with the TVs (I assume as long as they have the channels and no other guests care too much). On this particular day our server was Bianca and she took great care of us. Initially we were catching up and talking for a while but that didn't stop her from checking in on us frequently which is much appreciated. We finally were ready to order and we decided to go with:*App*Root Beer Glazed Wings --- I ordered them extra crispy and they came out very nice  crunchy but full of that sticky flavor glaze. Cooked thoroughly  so there are no complaints here. I would order again. *Entrees*Full Rack Of Ribs --- Good glaze. Meaty and not too dry. I was kind of surprised because you never know if they will be too dry but I would order these again. Rib Eye --- A very nice slab of meat. Cooked medium. Good flavor. Juicy*Sides*Green Beans --- Tender. Juicy. Not much to say. Overall good.Asparagus --- Seasoned well with the right amount of crunch. *Drinks*House Blonde --- Cold and good tasting.*Dessert*Pizookie Trio --- Monkey Bread. White Chocolate. Peanut Butter. The PB was the definite hit out of the 3 for us with WC coming in second. MB was ok but may have been a little too sweet and not as soft  but it was ok. I believe this is all we had and the experience was overall good. We were also able to take advantage of a BOGO entree which wasn't a bad deal at all. And our server was cool about it. I say that because I've been to places where you would present a coupon and sometimes the server would seem like they had an attitude with it or something. My thing is  if they weren't meant to be used then the company wouldn't have made them. And with that being said  make sure you tip appropriately; especially when you're getting a deal. A lot of servers work hard and coupons shouldn't cut into their bottom line. All in all a good day and a good job from Bianca. I will be back.Cheers  Beautiful People!!!!
Nick D.,Irvine  CA,0,2,,12/3/2017,1.0,One specific server is very rude. Her name was Cynthia and she had an attitude when my son asked for the kids meal. She laughed and rolled her eyes at my son. No customer should ever be treated like this. I understand there is policy but there are ways to officiate them. The food was also very poor.
Tara L.,Seattle  WA,207,326,675,6/12/2017,4.0,I've been going to this location since I was in high school  so almost 10 years now! Overall  I have always had excellent service and great food. I've tried everything from pastas  burgers  salads  and tons of their appetizers. The main food items I would recommend here are their: avocado egg rolls  deep dish pizzas  and of course  the pizookies. On this particular trip  I went for a healthier option and was not disappointed. The meal itself was the perfect amount of food and tasty. I ordered their Peruvian Quinoa with Shrimp bowl. The shrimp tasted pretty fresh and the meal itself wasn't as bland as you might think for a healthy meal. I would get this dish again and I definitely intend on returning here.
Jessica N.,Garden Grove  CA,90,294,777,6/10/2017,4.0,Staff was great and super attentive. Parking was great too for a weekday lunch.BJs is known for their pizzas and pizookie desserts  so I totally recommend those  but not really anything else except their root beer.I got the unlimited soup and salad and it was honestly disappointing. The soups tasted like they were from a can  especially the clam chowder and chicken tortilla. The chicken tortilla was a disgrace by the way. It was thick and way too salty. Chicken tortilla soup should be clear and light. The salads were kinda unhealthy. Definitely ask for dressing on the side because they liked to drown their salads. I got the wedge which was covered in ranch and bacon No thanks. The tomato salad was whatever. House salad was the only decent one because it was pretty much a normal salad with romaine  spring greens  carrots  etc. But hey  it's unlimited  so I brought some home.I like their normal cookie pizookies  so I decided to try the monkey bread version. Unless you like dense and thick chewy bread  this is your thing. I like my monkey bread fluff and light  so this was disappointing. Ice cream was delivered though  especially the chocolate Ghirardelli.Anyway  still had a good time and will definitely come again and get a pizza.
Randy L.,Irvine  CA,141,191,270,5/27/2017,5.0,DEEEEEEP Dish Pizza with EVERYTHING on it is simply delicious and awesome. You will take some home. Food at BJ's is always great. Have not had a bad meal or poor service YET. Great for a date; lunch or dinner meal time; groups large and small; business or causal dining. For groups  make sure to make a reservation FIRST  or you will be waiting a long time  but they always try to accommodate the drop in groups.Food and service 5-Star  HANDS DOWN!
Sunny S.,Irvine  CA,28,85,283,8/16/2017,3.0,"Overall good experience could\'ve been a 4 star but will stick with 3 for now. -Service was somewhat decent. It\'s hard to judge when you have multiple people serving you. -Food quality was very good; the only comment I have is on the pizza; please put enough toppings specially when you\'re charging extra for jalapeos etc. Oh also  check your receipt before you pay as I discovered I was charged for an extra appetizer and when I brought it to my server attention her comment to me was ""I\'m glad you caught it""."
Jessamine A.,Tustin  CA,11,300,271,8/26/2017,4.0,"The family and I came here on a Monday for the ""half price pizza"" deal. A large pizza plus potato skins was definitely more than enough. The leftovers were lunch for the hubby for a couple days after that. All for under $30.00! You can\'t go wrong with that to feed a family of four. Unfortunately the pizza and potato skins were too good we ate so much that we didn\'t even have room for a pizookie. I know  I know...I\'m a bad mother! Shame on me. LOL! The potato skins were quartered pieces fried crispy then baked/broiled with the toppings of cheese  bacon and chives. Served with sour cream and ranch dressing and just the right amount of pieces to feed us all. We love their new wireless/remote service the servers have for placing our orders to the kitchen. It sure speeds up the drink and food delivery to the table. Did you know you can also pay your bill via the BJ\'s mobile app? Pretty technology savvy!"
Michelle D.,Santa Ana  CA,0,4,,11/28/2017,2.0,"Great if you are there....not a great grubhub delivery experience.Got our order on time  however it should have been 2 burgers with fries and two add on wedge salads. Received 2 burgers  no fries and 4 add on salads...which they charged me for 4. When I called  they said  ""that must be frustrating  your fries are here if you want to come pick them up."" Really? I paid $2.99 for them to pack up the food. Paid 15% tip. Paid the delivery man $5 tip and paid a fee for Grubhub. Soooooo not worth the chance to get food delivery. Better to call it in  go  check it  leave and go home. Saves nearly $20 that way."
Bryan M.,San Jose  CA,373,3,,11/28/2017,1.0,Went there late night on a Saturday after work. Hostess directed us towards the bar. We sat waiting at our table for ten minutes  only to be passed by the bald waiter as he greeted a table who walked in during the ten minutes after us. He then proceeded to walk back to the POS station near the bar. I had to physically walk up to him and ask him for assistance. I was hungry and refused to wait to be noticed any longer but if I had who knows how long it would take to be noticed. Our table was in plain sight. Super annoyed at service  or should I say the lack thereof.
Alva T.,Santa Ana  CA,0,13,7,10/30/2017,5.0,Great service and awesome food! Their exclusive alcohol suggested by Brady were delicious! Speaking of Brady... she was simply the best. Her smile and really friendly attitude makes me want to come back again and again  thanks so much Brady for a memorable night with people that mean so much to me. We created great memories tonight and you were a part of that. Thanks again BJ's!
Jacqueline K.,Diamond Bar  CA,885,150,856,6/18/2017,1.0,Stopped by around 11pm because of late night cravings for pizookies. First time trying BJ's pizookies & was such a disappointment!! Ordered the SALTED CARAMEL pizookie & BJ'S FAVORITE pizza. Both were awful & tasted like store bought/pre-made food. I could've bought Albertsons' cookies + vanilla ice cream + frozen pizza & had a more delectable meal. To top it off  service was meh & seemed like they all hated their jobs.
Rebekkah C.,Orange County  CA,595,380,3719,12/17/2016,4.0,SOLID FOOD and GREAT SERVICE! Complimentary meal valued under $12.95 to all Military Veterans. Staff were nice and friendly. We were greeted with a smile and was seated outside to enjoy the fresh air.Food we had were good and came in a timely manner. We had..-AVOCADO EGGROLLS- Yummy!!! Crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside. A bit greasy but tasty.-SPAGHETTI and MEATBALS (lunch portion)- Portion was still big and easily filled me up. Meatballs were perfectly cooked and noodles weren't soggy. It was delicious and I'd get it again. -BISON BURGER- El Hubby enjoyed it. It was his complimentary meal. Grilled buffalo patty with bbq sauce  green chiles and pico de gallo. It was lean yet very flavorful and delicious. Highly recommend it. -TATONKA STOUT- A rich dark beer with hints of coffee or chocolate. Get it. Our server was really nice and attentive. She checked on us and made sure we had everything we needed. She was also knowledgeable with the menu esp with drinks. She recommended her favs and gave El hubby beer samples to try. Overall  it was a good experience. I highly recommend this location.
Thomas V.,Irvine  CA,810,103,301,1/11/2017,3.0,I really do enjoy their food  but it can be hit or miss at times. But that seems like a common theme among most chain restaurants. However  the food I generally get at this BJ's is usually well made. This particular BJ's is situated at the Tustin Marketplace among a variety of different restaurants. It is located on the corner of Jamboree and Irvine Blvd. Parking can be an issue at times since the area is packed with many different shops and restaurants  but I usually am able to find parking without too much trouble. This BJ's is pretty large and there is a waiting area for those waiting to pick up food or waiting to be seated. The inside is usually pretty clean and the tables are well kept. The food is the same food you would find at any BJ's  so I'll talk more about the execution. I've had the sirloin steak at several different BJ's and have never been disappointed by the quality of the steak at this location. I've also had several other dishes and have usually not been disappointed. The service at this BJ's is also usually very good  all of the staff and friendly and helpful.Overall  this BJ's is a solid choice if you're looking for some good quality chain restaurant food.
Joy G.,Loma Linda  CA,1,4,,9/16/2017,5.0,Had fabulous service. No waiting 4ish on Friday. The best cauliflower tacos I ever eaten!Even meat lovers eod enjoy these. Soft warm pita filled with sauteed cauliflower topped with shredded lettuce  cheese and a yogurt sauce. Absolutely a feel good meal!Of course top it off with a white chocolate macadamia piezookie to finalize the feel good sensation!
Larry M.,Tustin  CA,0,5,,8/22/2017,1.0,Recently informed by a very unhappy family member that there is now a membership rewards program that seats you prior to those unregistered and previously waiting!!!If that be the case then this 10 year plus attendee and family will be taking our business across the parking lot for future dining...............No matter how much I like their Jeramiah Red!This is a terrible marketing idea.
Grace B.,Huntington Beach  CA,235,456,277,4/22/2017,5.0,I am the last person that would ever be up for a corporate establishment for dinner. I just prefer my hole in the walls. The other night though  we were celebrating a birthday and this is where everyone chose to go so I made the best of it.It must have just been my night  cause we started off with impeccable service by Sam. He was one of the most genuine and friendliest servers I have had in a while. He patiently answered all our questions  was quick to acknowledge us if we ever needed anything  and consistently came by our table to check on us. We started with his recommended appetizer of the sampler plate since we didn't know which ones to choose from. It came with buffalo chicken tenders  mozzarella sticks  spinach artichoke dip with chips  and avocado egg rolls. We all devoured it.Next  for my meal  I chose the barbacoa chicken and substituted the brown rice for coleslaw. The chicken was seasoned wonderfully and the flavor of the whole dish was great.My husband had the buffalo burger wrapped in lettuce and preferred my meal to his. Others ordered regular burgers and had no complaints. I couldn't keep my fingers off everyone's fries. They really do their burgers and fries like a burger dedicated restaurant. I'm pretty impressed  they're definitely doing something right!
Christina S.,Irvine  CA,146,118,40,8/15/2017,1.0,Service from the hostess the last few times at this location have been unpleasant and rude. We just went this past Sunday as a party of 10 and my friend called me to let me know that she called in to put her name down. When I arrived  I told the hostess  Liza or Elisa (was given both these names from different people)  that we had reservations for 10. She told me that there wasn't any reservations under that name and that there wasn't any reservations for 10 people.  Fine. She continues to look at me with a blank stare so I asked her to put my name down and she said FINE. Straight out glared at me and had so much attitude that I really was ready to walk out. Does she not know that she's the greeter and is supposed to be pleasant and inviting? No one taught her this working as a hostess at a family restaurant? We were never asked if we were ok with the patio and that's where our table was set up. It was 90 degrees out and the ceiling fan was basically a joke. We were drenched in sweat.This was definitely an unpleasant dining experience all around.
Yoshie M.,Hemet  CA,4,35,29,6/17/2017,5.0,"My husband and I have talked about going to BJ\'s many times before but never did  until today. We got there around 6pm the day before Father\'s Day. The place was packed with 30 to 40 min. wait. My husband HATES wait! However  the hostess suggested because we were just two of us we could get seated at the bar tables. So we did. Thanx to the hostess! A server came right away! Tiana was very friendly  attentive and knowledgeable. We ordered 2 Ribs Pork Chop and 15oz Prime Rib. Pork chop was at least 2 inch thick  and perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned! The best pork chop I have ever tasted. Prime Rib was tender and flavorful and minimum of fat. Pizooki came with Prime Rib dinner. Huge  freshly baked cookie ( many choices) with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. Yum! My husband said he would definitely come back  which he rarely say. Great food. Great service. Btw  they gave my husband a ""Happy Father\'s Day"" glass and a 20% off coupon card for Father\'s Day. Nice!"
Derek T.,Tustin  CA,7,3,1,7/6/2017,3.0,I always get take out here and the food is good most nights but every time I order something they almost always forget something! Either my burger doesn't have fries  the balsamic I asked for is Caesar  or just not paying attention to special instructions. Want to give a good review but it's about what you'd expect from a chain; although even as a regular I'm sometimes disappointed.
Susie L.,Irvine  CA,24,14,45,8/22/2017,4.0,My mom and I love coming here for happy hour. We've tried a lot of their food and they're all tasty. We usually share a salad and pizza with beer  it is really amazing. The service and the atmosphere there is always great.
Charles N.,Orange County  CA,151,92,48,8/29/2017,4.0,It's a great place to grab a drink  munch on some chicken wings  hang out with a buddy  and watch a game. If you come here with that mindset  you'll love this restaurant. Don't expect to get gourmet meals. You go somewhere else for that. Service is always great. It can get very crowded  especially during Happy Hours. As for #Thinsulin approved green light drinks  go for the wine or hard liquor on the rocks  but avoid the red light drinks such as beers and mixed drinks since they spike insulin.
Abbe W.,Irvine  CA,619,616,1249,8/24/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"My family and I were there last week and found out that they now have a rewards plan. Through the sign up  we found out about the Prime Rib Tuesday Special so we came to check it out. It\'s a three course dinner meal for $27.99 (I think). The appetizer course had a choice of soup or salad. My first choice was The Wedge but I really wanted to try the Twisted BLT  which was very good and light. There wasn\'t any ""L"" but more of ""S"" for spinach. Perfect size to get started.The main course was of course the Prime Rib. My meat was medium rare. It was done perfectly and paired with Roasted Brussel Sprouts  rice pilaf and 14oz goodness. The au ju\'s and horseradish were very nice addon. I couldn\'t finish it so brought some for lunch. The dessert course was the signature pizookie. My husband and I thought it was the mini pizookie but instead it\'s the full size. So we had two pizzokies. I would have been happy with just a mini but the full size definitely filled up the sugar level!Overall  it was very nice dinner. The special is only on Tuesday selected BJ\'s so please check your local BJ\'s. It\'s also limited so go early for dinner."
Karis K.,Irvine  CA,26,14,,7/20/2017,1.0,I know this is a chain and it's convenient to go to  but spend your money elsewhere.Some family and I went last night as a group of 4 and I called in 30 minutes ahead to put our name down on their 'waitlist'. Once we arrived  the host checked us in  but then said the wait would be another 20 minutes? Why would I bother being on the waitlist then? Luckily we were seated within 10 minutes not 20.SERVICE: Waitress was nice  but never came to our table at the right time. I had to FLAG DOWN waiters or waitresses to take our order  add to our order  and get refills many times. Our drinks were never filled unless we asked and even then  they would only fill the person who has the least water  but not everyone?! FOOD: We all weren't feeling pizza so we opted for 3 pasta dishes and their new quinoa dish.-Thai Soba Noodles: Poorly cooked and came as a mush of broken soba noodles. Flavor was okay.-Fettuccini Alfredo: Super sticky-Jambalaya: I asked for pasta instead of rice  which maybe was my mistake  but this was the WORST Jambalaya I've ever had (and this is a go to dish for me at most restaurants). SUPER BLAND. How could you do that to a Jambalaya? The noodles had absolutely no flavor at all except for a bit of olive oil and the peppers  shrimp  sausage  and chicken were all poorly seasoned. DO NOT ORDER NOT WORTH THE $.-Quinoa dish: Unless you really need to watch your weight  no even then I wouldn't suggest this dish. Absolutely NO flavor. My mom had to put Siracha with every bite just to eat it.Pizookies were good so there is a star for that  but they should be good it's their signature.Just think twice about coming here because things have changed at this chain and not for the better. I used to go many times about 4-5 years ago  but now I won't be back for a long while.Sadly disappointed.
M J.,Santa Ana  CA,0,19,9,7/16/2017,1.0,Yeap all the reviews are true. The service from the staff is badddddd it's sad because I visit different locations and they all have great food and service but not sure what's wrong here. Oh well I guess the manager doesn't care about training his staff to be more helpful or at least try to serve us that we just come to eat something good enjoy the food but can't when everyone here has long faces and can't even come to see if we are okay.Will not come to this location.
Mariella Jacqueline K.,Los Angeles  CA,209,69,131,8/30/2017,3.0,The menu is very overwhelming  just ask for a kids menu :) anyone can order off it. A full white meat (chicken breast grilled) with broccoli and carrots and it's cheap. The easy thing is the free birthday Pizookie if it is your birthday :-) yummy chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top but however I cannot enjoy this so everyone else should!
Tina S.,Tustin  CA,0,7,,10/14/2017,2.0,We have been to other BJ locations in LA and other cities. It's a decent restaurant and with the new menu they have added a lot of different cuisines as well as vegetarian choices. I would usually rate them 3.5/5.But this BJ's Jamboree location disappoints me third time in row. Each time we have gone the service has been below average. The server comes once to take your order and that's it. If you need plates  want to order any additional food or drinks  you have to wait forever.First 2 times we went  we ordered vegetarian pizza  explained them no meat. Yet both the times we found meat pieces in the slice. We thought of trying third time today after almost a year since their menu was changed. But neither the deep dish pizza was good nor the service. I will never go back to this location. BJ's seems to have lost their baking recipe for a good deep dish pizza.
Cristi R.,Tustin  CA,0,6,,11/26/2017,5.0,Delicious food and great service. We placed our order ahead of time using the BJ's app. Once we arrived at the restaurant  we were seated quickly and our drinks were brought right out  followed quickly by our appetizers and pizza. As much as we love the pizookies  we decided to try the beignet for dessert this time. I highly recommend it! It was light  fluffy and deliciously covered in ice cream  whipped cream and strawberries.
J H.,Rancho Santa Margarita  CA,16,18,,8/17/2017,5.0,My daughter and I just had dinner at the BJ's in Irvine and it was great! The brisket loaded burger was really good and the bacon cheeseburger was also. Really glad I tried the house berry cider  at the recommendation of our waiter  Sloan. Speaking of Sloan....He gave us enough space to be able to enjoy our meal  but also added just enough conversation and personality to make it fun. And yes  we had pizookies :)#pizurro
Jake A.,Irvine  CA,528,167,53,4/6/2017,4.0,My wife has been talking about half-off pizza Mondays for... a long time. So we got the large deep dish classic BJ's whatever pizza and it was sooo good. We normally grab domino's or little caesar's on the go or a quick slice or for group events  and I think I forgot what a good deep dish pizza tastes like! Obviously  I'm not comparing to authentic Chicago deep dish or anything like that  but you know what I mean. It was only about 12 bucks and it could definitely feed three people.The avocado egg-rolls may say that it comes with six pieces  but it's really six HALF PIECES. When I bit into the deliciousness I forgot how upset I was about feeling jipped on the half pieces. But I won't drop 11 bucks for that again.
Brian S.,Irvine  CA,17,86,,7/9/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Wow. This experience was horrible. Crazy wait and a server who should not be serving to customers. She was short and uninterested in our food or service. We waited for our food for 45 minutes and asked for a manager and he came over and provided excuses why there was a delay. We also shared the server was rude and vocal to another table regarding the delay. He seemed uninterested in really correcting the situation or leaving a positive experience with us. It was like pulling teeth to get refills for iced tea. The ribs were ok but not the best they have provided. Grey had a very heavy pork smell and needed additional BBQ. I asked for additional and finally got it when I was nearly done eating.
Brandon J.,Las Vegas  NV,1,19,16,9/28/2017,5.0,We paid a visit to California and on our way through we stopped at BJ's Irvine  sure glad we did..They had the new Pumpkin beer on tap right now  really excellent beer! They also have a new menu and happy hour since we have last visited which is also definitely worth a trip back. A Must try also for the Crispy Fried Artichokes and the Sliders. Our server Maili was very attentive and pleasant and kept checking on us  two thumbs up for her and a thank you.
Dave C.,Los Angeles  CA,20,9,1,8/15/2017,5.0,First time here. Nick  our waiter  was funny and personable and mostly left us alone to re-connect. Thanks  Nick! You rock!Anyway  both the salmon dishes we ordered were delish as we're the drinks. I'm from LA  but will come back next time I'm here with my local cousin.
Ali B.,Vancouver  WA,1,24,3,8/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,I've learned to come to the bar top to be taken care of. Didn't catch the bartender's name but I came in at 10:00 on a Sunday night. He was a really nice guy with a beard. I asked him to make a dirty martini and if he had bleu cheese olives. He said no but he would go ahead and make me some. As a server I know what a freakin PAIN it is to make those olives (admittedly  sometimes I'll say we don't have any to customers because I don't want to go through the pain of making them)  and for a bartender taking care of a million people  I imagine it can't be easy. So thank you  nice bearded bartender  for making me a delicious martini with my bleu cheese olives!
John P.,Irvine  CA,0,1,,10/31/2017,5.0,As someone who works in irvine I can't emphasize enough how great it is to have a place open to get a drink at after 9pm. Miley the cocktailer and Phil the bartender always take the utmost care of us and make our night after work always perfect. We will always be back to BJS in irvine just due to them!
Abby G.,Costa Mesa  CA,0,3,2,8/22/2017,1.0,Oh boy. We have enjoyed visiting BJ's for weekly date night for years with the understanding that we are guaranteed an ice  cold West Coast IPA Green Flash. We noticed it was not on the menu for many months so they discontinued recently because it was not ordered often enough. Very strange. The best part was that we found Lazy Dog serves it (not as cold) and we went there to find all the servers from BJ's at the bar drinking Green Flash. Do the people who are actually in the restaurant (patrons/employees) have any say in decisions? As loyal customers  this is such a scam.
Terry P.,Irvine  CA,0,4,,11/23/2017,5.0,My family and I been regulars here for 15 plus years. We've had some good experiences and some not so great experiences. A couple days ago we went back  after a couple month absence. Our server  Andrea  was the most on the ball server we've ever had. Rivaling many fine dining restaurants  the food was as good as ever. I fully recommend this place.
Cuong N.,Irvine  CA,7,226,345,7/29/2017,2.0,We've always gone to BJ's for father's day as it's a small tradition amongst our family. Unfortunately  the past few years have been abit trying.We were seated outside. It was hot this father's day. If you're planning to seat us outside  please at least turn on the ceiling fans and have fans for use outside.But more importantly was the food.  It tasted like frozen food reheated. My sister in law she ordered the prime rib special. They asked for medium... it came out well done. It was dry and salty too. Another person in our group ordered pork chops but they were just way to salty. I bumped this to 2 stars because they did replace the order with baby back ribs.After eating here  I'd say I'll take my chances with Norms rather then eat here again. My wife used to eat here alot when she went to college  but says the food has changed alot since then (that was about 10 years ago) (she's just referring to the chain as a whole...other locations we've had the same sub par experience)
Rabia A.,Irvine  CA,0,1,,11/22/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,So my friend and I wanted to go to BJs after a very long day and knowing that this place is very crowded  we asked ahead of time to be informed that the wait was only 30 minutes. Because we love the food at bjs  we decided to wait. However  after roughly 40 minutes I asked again and they said we had to wait another 30 minutes. Angry and hungry we decided to go someplace else to eat but on our way there  about 10 minutes later  we got a text from bjs saying our table is ready. This has caused me to lose all respect for BJs and I urge people not to go to this restaurant especially on a busy night. Not only is the wait ridiculously long but the waiters do not know how to manage the wait times. Never going to this restaurant again. Waste of good food. The waiters are also incapable of serving food. They don't give out utensils or napkins and forget about the food
Jacob L.,Moreno Valley  CA,210,12,3,10/19/2017,5.0,When my family and I went to this BJ's  I think one of their devices/programs were down  but they worked really hard to get us seated and serviced. Once we were seated  our server Briana W. did an excellent job and was attentive and extremely helpful. She gave wonderful suggestions and did not rush us at all. My family and I were very thankful for her service and I think that this service alone deserves 5 stars for the restaurant. The food was very good and came out quickly. Awesome job  BJ's.
Patrick W.,Irvine  CA,47,19,19,6/6/2017,1.0,This place sucks. Waited over an hour and all they kept saying is 'your next'. After we are seated we ordered and pizza took another 20 mins. Worse part when the pizza arrived it was just warm. Cheese hard and totally tasteless. When I told our waitress she asked if I wanted it to be reheated. Wtf?! Reheated?! No I don't want you to nuke it in the microwave. All along we are still waiting for our salad. After having almost done eating the pizza the salad arrived. Apparently the salad department was backed up. Lame. After not having been there for quite some time  I don't think I'll ever go back. What for? The pizza is not that great. I'd rather order deep dish from little Cesars than pay $25 for bj. Do yourself a favor  if you have to wait over 30 mins for this place  just go elsewhere.
William B.,Whittier  CA,0,20,2,10/3/2017,5.0,Very friendly waitress  food was prompt   delicious. They didn't need up on my order (no onions allergic) .
Margaret L.,Fullerton  CA,23,122,52,5/15/2017,4.0,"We came to BJ\'s for my graduation celebration. Initially  one month before my graduation  we had talked to an employee named Daniel. Daniel allegedly arranged everything for my graduation celebration. My boyfriend spoke to Daniel on several occasions. On the Thursday before my graduation  my boyfriend decided to go to BJ\'s (in person) to confirm with Daniel  for the last time  about our graduation accommodations. Daniel was not there. My boyfriend then talked to another woman  who was in a managerial capacity. The woman said she had no idea who my boyfriend was  and that no reservations had been placed under his name  nor mine. We were outraged. The woman then put our names in  and told us she did not know what Daniel had arranged  but she would TRY and accommodate us. On the day of my graduation celebration  we did not have the sides of the patio. Our guests did not get to eat ""buffet"" style  as people generally tend to eat more when it is in a ""buffet"" style. Rather  we were crammed in two elongated tables  with little to no room for anyone to mingle and talk. The guests segregated themselves as the way the tables were set up did not allow anyone to mingle with one another much. I was very displeased. It was then that my boyfriend and I got the attention of a general manager  Ricky. Ricky did everything and anything to accommodate us. He made sure my two tables (along with our guests) were well taken care of. He basically saved the day. The four stars I am giving BJ\'s is for people like Ricky. Ricky was a people person that day. Because of him  I was content  my guests - happy and full. Many of the guests that I was with even said that they would be coming back to BJ\'s because of their exceptional service. THANK YOU RICKY. The lack of the 5th star is for people like Daniel. Because every employer is responsible for their employees (as BJ\'s is for Daniel)  they should honor what Daniel had agreed upon with us  and hold him accountable. Although we did not get the side of the patio as was previously agreed nor did we get food served in a ""buffet"" style as opposed to ""family"" style (which is what we got)  our guests  nonetheless  ended up content. We had plenty of food to give the guests to take home. Upon leaving BJ\'s  I ran into another one of my fellow law school graduates. I made sure she knew about Ricky  and told her that if she needed anything  to definitely talk to Ricky.Again  thank you Ricky for saving the day!"
Stevo L.,Newport Beach  CA,13,105,20,7/12/2017,4.0,"So they overcooked my burger twice! Yes twice! So why am I giving them 4 stars? Keep reading. I was really pissed and didn\'t want anything to eat at that point because the others at my table were done eating. So my waiter Sloan saw I was picking at my burger pretty much because I had to eat something. He slides one more attempt onto the table and says  ""Hey if your gonna pick at something  try this one instead"". Ok  nice approach and guess what  it worked. The burger was perfect as I saw on the menu. Delicious and moist and wonderful. They came by to give me a $15 gift card and a free pizookie. To say this was a miraculous recovery is an understatement. Well done manager Maggie and well done Sloan"
Amy L.,Costa Mesa  CA,451,142,357,4/22/2017,4.0,This is one of the better locations. It's cleaner  livelier  bigger  and more attentive. Came here for their pizookies because  hey that's what their known for and it's a dessert to surely satisfy any sweet tooth. You can't go wrong with any variety. Had the salted caramel one and sampled the double chocolate one and omigoodness that was some heavenly chocolate. It tasted like a chocolate brownie topped with chocolate ice cream. Chocolate lovers would approve. Good chill vibes!
Rob L.,Irvine  CA,4685,403,1602,4/3/2016,4.0,I haven't been to a BJ's in maybe 10 years or longer. My initial impression when I visited the Irvine location today was that nothing much has changed. I was actually quite surprised by the lack of technology at the reception area.They don't use any form of pagers. They don't ask for your phone number or text you when your table is ready. Instead  the hostesses will scream your name at the top of her lungs in the noisy lobby when your table is ready. Just like the way they do it in those traditional Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.However  the menu has changed quite a bit since the last time I was at a BJ's. It was definitely more extensive  and more contemporary and creative.We ordered a BJ's Brewhouse Classic flatbread which was topped with pepperonis  Italian sausages  and fresh mushrooms. The potions of the toppings were very generous. The cheese was what they call BJ's 5-cheese blend and it was very tasty  with a rich flavor of mozzarella  which I like. The sauce was light  slightly tangy and sweet. The crust was baked to almost perfection.We also ordered an Asian chopped salad and we were impressed that we were able to custom order it without green onions and cilantro. (CPK on the other side of the Market Place would not and could not do it because their salads were pre-mixed). BJ's is certainly a winner here and beat CPK by a TKO!The salad was made with a wide variety of baby greens  romaine lettuce  napa cabbage  shredded carrot  mandarin orange slices  among other goodies. All the veggies tasted very fresh. The thick slices of grilled chicken breast meat that came with the salad were yummy and tender. The final magic touch was the delicious honey ginger dressing which sealed the deal of making it an amazing salad.Service has been friendly and efficient throughout our meal. The mostly 70's or 80's classic rock vibes are cool. The atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing. Overall  it was a very nice dining experience and quite a pleasant surprise. Will definitely be back soon!
Ricardo A.,Irvine  CA,153,135,84,4/23/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Unfortunately lost service quality.I'm a TUSTIN resident and usually go there for a burger with friends and today ordered 3 burgers at the bar area and waited 30minutes+ for a semi-cold meal.Thank you Howard for your reply on my comments.Unfortunately service problems were not only experienced by me. Looking at other reviews the majority of complains are about staff. I understand the difficult task of hiring and the high turnaround on this industry  however a more intensive training and perhaps addition of floor managers can maybe help.
Erica L.,Irvine  CA,0,3,,11/17/2017,4.0,This place is one of our fav spots! Their cherry salmon plate is delicious  it's usually what I get when we dine here. Their pizzas are delicious too. Most of the time the wait is long but worth it! Their churro limited time pizookie was so good!
C.R. V.,VALLEY VILLAGE  CA,161,34,4,9/14/2017,3.0,I love BJ's  I really do. I have been to several and can say that they are one of the few chains whose food is consistent. (Consistently YUMMY!) They have a great selection for adults and kids  as well. They train their wait staff very well for customer service  The reason why I am giving this location only three stars though is because whoever buses the tables needs to be trained as well. If someone gets up to use the restroom that is not a queue to clear the table. Seriously!
Mark M.,Irvine  CA,1,8,2,10/3/2017,5.0,Great happy hour. Great prices at happy hour. Great food. Great atmosphere. I don't think I could afford this place normally. I had the bacon wrapped hotdog and it was great. Lazy dog is open till midnight. It is lots of fun. Call ahead and find out the hours.
Steve E.,Los Angeles  CA,329,5,10,7/25/2017,2.0,Last and only trip to that location for sure. I've been in fine dining 40 years and had a corner table which gave us a panarama view of utter chaos. Dirty plates left sitting by POS terminal for ages before being picked up.Wrong food going to wrong tables.. long delays between courses  and it was mid afternoon  not rush hour.Over cooked skins  a decent jalapeno burger  the small pizza was good. Pizooki was burned around the edges. Need I say more. Amanda had downloaded your app.  And has now deleted it since we were so disgusted. Thank you! Steve
Britany S.,Anaheim  CA,82,70,4,6/27/2017,3.0,I don't know how many stars to give this place...We've been here twice in 6 months and I have mixed emotions. Our server tonight was very nice but wasn't the most efficient... he never cleared plates and the table got very messy and cluttered. We started stacking plates and they still weren't cleared until we were paying our bill. Our last visit the waiter was very nice but very slow and had too many tables so the service took forever...Both times we have come  the avocado egg rolls have been burnt  which is slightly disappointing; but they are still delicious. The pizza tonight was burnt as well and so was the balsamic chicken... maybe the food is spending too much time under the heat lamps while waiting for the servers and runners to take them to the table...? Overall  I always recommend BJ's but be prepared to wait and eat burnt food...
Suzan L.,Irvine  CA,23,17,2,9/13/2017,3.0,It's a good happy hour but food service during happy hour was very slow they were not fold the capacity like they have been the past couple years
Trudy L.,Buena Park  CA,11,304,333,9/5/2016,2.0,I loved the quality and happy hour price of appetizer ahi poke. The server even replaced poorly cooked dry rice with avocado cubes and green lettuce which was a surprise!However  that mosquitos bite turned me off  after I felt comfy in an air conditioned area. I'll come back to try other foods but will remind myself to wear pants next time.
Judith G.,Tustin  CA,7,31,47,6/26/2017,4.0,Always have a good experience here. The service is fast and the servers are very friendly and willing to give helpful tips on the menu. They have specials for everyday in week!
Ellen G.,Tustin  CA,0,2,,9/14/2017,5.0,Stephanie was Awesome!!!! She was an amazing server! She was sweet and kind and always had a smile! It's amazing that our bill was low but she still managed to take care of us so well! Thank you! Thanks friend!!!Note: she always says friend!
Bev R.,Upland  CA,0,4,,11/6/2017,5.0,I decided to have a surprise party for my daughter at BJ's yesterday. Honestly  I can not imagine a better staff than the ones I met here. The managers  Al  Maggie and Kaitlin went above and beyond to make this event run perfectly. They worked with whatever I requested and made it seem effortless. The wait staff took extraordinary care of us. Big parties are not easy to handle but BJ's did it perfectly! Thanks for the great time!
Nicole E.,Irvine  CA,17,76,83,8/14/2017,5.0,Ok BJ's you have pleasantly surprised me with your brunch. Everyone knows them for their infamous pazookie's  but I never thought they would have a great brunch. I came here at 10:15am this past Sunday and granted it was a ghost town because they had just opened. It definitely worked out in our favor because service was fast and ON POINT  kudos to the Sunday morning team! Mimosa's only 4 bucks  amazing and a majority of their breakfast dishes weren't priced higher then $10 bucks which was also a pleasant surprise. So pricing was a total win and the food was delicious! I had the breakfast tacos and they were just perfect!! Not too much  but not too small  just right! BJS you made me fan :)
Monica R.,Santa Ana  CA,3,17,2,7/2/2017,1.0,Had dinner last night and everything was horrible. I ordered a chicken tortilla soup  which is my favorite but last night was so disgusting. They loaded it up with disgusting chicken and to top it off it was cold! We ordered a medium pizza and was cold as well. We had to have our server warm it up and after she did it wasn't hot. I was over it by then already! I'm a regular here but it seems like their employees are not putting an effort on their food and that's sad. I won't be coming back to this location  maybe I'll give another location a try. Sad  sad  sad.
Elana R.,Aliso Viejo  CA,238,40,19,8/16/2017,5.0,Wow!! This BJs is definitely one of my favorite!!! Our waiter tonight is so on point. Truly one of the best waiters I have ever had!! Thank you Nick for getting our complicated/not so complicated order right!! When you come here you know the food is always great and normally the waiters/waitresses are too!! But I have to say this waiter Nick tonight seriously is one of the best waiters I have had the pleasure to be waited on by.
Kate B.,Irvine  CA,229,237,343,8/1/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Thank you for the reply Howard (GM). We are back tonight: (Monday August 1st) and our server recommended the Barbacoa Chicken to my father this evening. I mentioned my experience last time to the waiter and he said this time should be better. We are anxious to try it again and intend to raise this review to a 5 star. Again  thank you for replying to me and I'll email you to let you know how it comes out this time. Ok it came out kind of the same. Better but still could be improved. I've attached pictures of the pizookie and how thin it is. It's not even an inch thick anymore. I remember when they filled the tin to the top. It's covered in ice cream  too much. I googled pictures from BJs website to show the drastic difference in the size of the cookie in the pizookie. Unfortunately  I don't feel any need to raise my review to 4 or 5 stars at this time. (Previous Review)Bjs is a lot of fun. I like the style of the restaurant. It's spacious and has a cool industrial vibe. Inside is surprisingly quieter than the outdoor patio at this particular location. We almost ate outside to try to beat the wait and it echoed so badly out there that you couldn't hear yourself talk. It was filled with huge parties of almost 30 per party. Probably quieter on a less busy evening. We lucked out and the hostess just put us at the first open table inside that she saw. That was so nice. We came in a few days ago and I ordered the quinoa with salmon. It was so good that I hyped my mom up on it and brought her back tonight. So I ordered her that and I decided to try the barbacoa chicken. It was served on a bed of brown rice with black beans  sprinkled feta  Greek yogurt creme sauce and cilantro. It came out looking like it had been under the heat lamp for about 5 minutes. The beans looked baked together and there wasn't enough Greek yogurt creme sauce so I requested more which made it a little better. Thankfully my moms salmon lived up to my hype and she loved it. We ordered the pizookie trio: blueberry lemon  salted caramel and chocolate chip for dessert. The ice cream overloaded the cookie a little too much for the miniature pizookies and made it real soggy. The pizookie cookies are a little on the thinner side. They would be awesome if they were as deep as bjs deep dish pizza. Service was a little slow tonight and food came out at different times but within 3 minutes of each other. but they were busy  that's understandable. Salmon was a score. Pizzas are very good. I wouldn't order the barbacoa chicken again though unless it was a little better prepared.
Anisa L.,Tustin  CA,128,2,,6/26/2017,1.0,Thanks BJs for the worst experience of my life. This past weekend I went to go eat there   they walk us to our booth and while I was looking through the menu a big cockroach was crawling up my foot! I jump up from the table ask to speak to a manager. By the time the manager got there she step on it and took us to a new booth . By that time I was already sick to my stomach. When I look up they had already put a new couple in that same booth to eat....that wasn't the worst part the worst part was that they never clean up that area and left the cockroach there never cleanup! So gross! Never going to bjs again . That whole restaurant needs to been cleaned food was everywhere on the floor.
Sarah A.,Aliso Viejo  CA,0,5,2,8/30/2017,5.0,The happy hour is really great and within walking distance from our apartment. Ask for Bonnie  she is attentive and a very personable server. We have somehow become regulars here due to our close living accommodations and the late hours we keep. Tip your sever well and according to the bill before happy hour discounts! Don't be a cheapskate!!!!!!!!
Brian B.,Orange  CA,7,25,1,9/9/2017,1.0,I'm not crazy about the greasy pizza they sell here but the other food is marginal at best but once in a while I have to come for the pozookie. It is awesome. However be prepared for consistently poor service especially at this location. I live across the street so it's close but it's worth the drive somewhere else just due to the crappy service and dirty tables!
Nathan L.,Irvine  CA,37,1,1,4/5/2017,1.0,Worst take out service I've ever received. Ordered my large pizza at 6 pm and was told it would take 20-30 minutes. Sat and waited for another 30 minutes for my order and asked multiple times for an update and was ignored 3 times. Hostess then asked if there was a name change on the order AFTER she took my payment because she LOST my receipt with my name on it. Manager brought out my order after an hour and when I asked if he lost my pizza he said they were just running behind which was a lie because my pizza was cold. Got home and one slice of pizza wasn't even a BJ's favorite slice. Horrible customer service and communication. They never even apologized for the delay. Not sure how the pizza isn't even a full pizza but it's disgusting to think they threw old slices together in the kitchen. Loss of appetite.
Kiki H.,Lake Forest  CA,6,25,4,8/3/2017,5.0,I eat at BJs all the time all over because I love the food  always have great service  and pricing is affordable but today I had such an amazing experience with my waitress Andrea. She was so friendly  fast  attentive. I didn't have to ask twice for anything. I would come back in this location to have another experience with her.
Jennifer N.,Irvine  CA,2,59,65,10/13/2017,5.0,My sister and I get consistently great and friendly service every time we come here. On my most recent visit  I ordered the sunset peach iced tea  sweet potato fries  and the soup and salad combo with a bread bowl of vegan lentil soup and a house salad topped with vinaigrette dressing while my sister got hibiscus tea  chips with salsa  and a vegetarian version of their spaghetti without the meatballs. I enjoyed my soup in a bread bowl  and was pleasantly glad that the bread bowl wasn't stale or hard as a rock like I've had at another establishment in the distant past; in fact  it was delicious  and I only wish I didn't get full so quickly so that I could actually eat the bread bowl itself. At the end though  one of the servers or food runner/expo came by our table and dropped off another sunset peach and hibiscus tea even though we had already paid our check  so there was a lot of confusion between my sister and I over what happened.
Claudia Z.,Aliso Viejo  CA,153,372,200,12/12/2016,2.0,"The food here was quite good  this poor rating is a reflection of poor service from a particular waitress. We came in for a late lunch and was promptly greeted and seated right away  good start. As soon as menus were handed to us  the waitress asks ""can I get you something to start? maybe a calamari?""... um  literally just handed me the menu  I haven\'t even opened it yet... so I said we need a few minutes  just waters for now. I don\'t know if she took offense to that or something  but from then on service was SLOW as heck! The kicker was that she brought us the bill before our dessert even arrived!! I\'m okay if they leave the bill and say ""take your time"" while I\'m still eating my last dish  but asking me to pay BEFORE I even got my last dish  that\'s just rude  and a sure fire way to cut tips in half. At least the food was decent  otherwise I\'d have not tipped at all."
Jonathan D.,Irvine  CA,590,300,1976,1/25/2017,5.0,I'm really glad there's a BJ's locally. There's plenty of parking which I really like. Location is really big and is walking into large parties.Open late which is a huge plus for those days would you end up working late and still want to grab something delicious.When you come here you can never go wrong with the deep dish pizza or the Parmesan chicken.This location like all BJ's locations gets five stars from me!
Melissa P.,Oceanside  CA,122,4,,5/3/2017,5.0,Erin C. was our server and she was awesome!! We were a party of 25 and all needed separate checks. She handled it! Very friendly and was very accommodating and patient. 10/10
Al Y.,Irvine  CA,17,4,2,5/14/2016,1.0,USE CAUTION  I GOT SICK EATING AT THIS RESTAURANT!!I made a complaint to the manager about the quality of the chicken being low on a previous visit. I ordered boneless wings and was given breaded RAW CHICKEN!! I sent them an email as a health concern so others don't get sick. I sent them pictures.I called the next day in the middle of a solid boit of food poisoning trips to the restroom and was told the manager I sent the email to was off sick  and the on duty manager was just too busy to speak to me. Concerned for public health  I drove to the restaurant ill to speak with the manager  I was told the manager was too busy talking to a customer on the phone! I informed him of what happened  and showed him the pictures.
Albert W.,Orange  CA,696,1801,60,12/24/2016,4.0,People come here because it's an all around okay place for pizza and beer. I'm not a big fan since I tend to like mom and pop but I could do a lot worse.
Christine L.,Los Angeles  CA,837,519,1381,12/17/2016,5.0,Gluten Free Pazzookie!?!?!?!?!?!? Life changing! I must eat here again and again!!!! Super gluten free friendly options. Nice service. Comfortable atmosphere. Stays open pretty late.
Joseph J.,Garden Grove  CA,23,32,1717,7/5/2016,5.0,I've had Chicago Deep Dish from Chicago and I like BJ's pizza more. It just tastes better. The crust is more buttery. Blasphemy you say? Perhaps  but people always interpret the bible differently. Whatever floats your boat. I am not a purist. I just want something that tastes good to me! I love their pizookie. A thousand calories of fun! Is there anything special from other BJ's? If there is I don't see it but that shouldn't bother anyone. You go to a franchised restaurant for consistency and knowing what you want and expecting it. Come to think of it  if there is anything special it might be the patio. It does have a beautiful view of the vegetation. That is all. Over and out.
Kayla Q.,Irvine  CA,73,254,200,10/19/2016,3.0,Pretty good spot. Ive always enjoyed BJ's food and this location is no different. Their queso as an appetizer is awesome. I got a chicken Asian salad that was decent  but nothing fantastic. The people I was with all really loved what they got- the jalapeno burger  grilled ham and cheese sandwich  and turkey avocado club. We didn't get a pizookie this time  but those never disappoint! My only complaint was the service was very slow and it took quite some time to get our food.
Mike R.,Tustin  CA,0,4,1,8/3/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"I know Bjs isn\'t a ""sports bar""  but you could at least get a cable system that works. Check your dish location or box. The last two years or so  the system goes out out for certain stations like FOX sports when there are weather issues. And there were no weather issues tonight. A joke. And yet  next door at a competitor  all is well. Not good. Should not be an issue."
Matthew A.,Rancho Santa Margarita  CA,250,27,2,3/12/2017,5.0,Food is great.Restrooms are somewhat clean. Awesome service.Jordan the waiter was the real MVP here. On top of everything.
Bill B.,Irvine  CA,3,3,,10/20/2016,3.0,I don't like this place very much. The only item on the menu that doesn't make me nauseous is Caeser Salad. The fries or chicken tenders or rather anything that is fried seems like it swam in grease and then was squeezed to death. My wife likes the Balsamic Glazed chicken and to be honest I can't even get on board with that. I can cook better at home and given the option of BJs or eat at home  I would rather starve. I give stars for service and se
Stacey H.,Irvine  CA,81,210,13,10/28/2016,1.0,Food was poor (and only sort of warm) and service has been awful both visits. Servers stand around the computers right next to the booths complaining and arguing. Will not be back  too many better choices in the area.
Nahla B.,Tustin  CA,51,4,1,3/13/2017,5.0,One of my favorite places to dine. Menu has big varieties to choose from. I love their Avocado Rolls. Prices are very reasonable.
Matt K.,Irvine  CA,12,261,396,10/6/2015,4.0,BJ's has a really cool vibe  I especially like the bar area. There are high top tables  bar seating  but also booth seating within the bar area. I put my name down for a regular table in the dining area for Thursday Night Football  but while waiting I was able to snag a bar booth instead. It's a great atmosphere and you get waited on just like you are in the dining area  but you get the noise and fun of the bar. They serve regular American fare such as wings  burgers  pizzas. I think their deep dish pizzas are just ok  it's nothing like Chicago deep dishes  the bread is thick  but it's pretty full of air. Not a dense tasty deep dish. But the other dishes I really enjoyed like their wings and salad. They have great quantity as well so you will be full.They are also famous for their pizookie desserts. It's a mini-pizza pan  but filled with cookie and topped with ice cream. I would definitely try this  it's good to share and it's really tasty and well cooked.Service was really nice and we were even alerted of happy hour deals when we didn't know it was even happy hour time! Happy with the portions and taste of most items  the deep dish pizza could improve  but I still like the experience you get at a BJ's. Their craft beers are great too.
Darien S.,Irvine  CA,454,7,,1/25/2017,3.0,I'd consider BJ's an alternative to Yard House  but more family oriented. The service has always been great  and accommodating. For what it is  BJ's brewery is a solid lunch/dinner spot  but definitely not a huuuge favorite of mine by any means. I've been to both the Westwood UCLA and Huntington Main St. location one time each  and the Tustin Marketplace location 3-4 times. But to me that's not very many occasions at all having lived around many of them for the past 6 years! My one complaint about food would be that I wish the pizza could be saucier. That might be preferential  but the last time I went  I felt like our 'BJ's favorite' was overloaded with all the toppings  but terribly dough-ey. I doubt that is a trademark of deep dish but could be wrong...so my thoughts on that are... find a pizza that can do both! Other menu thoughts are that the boneless wings are really good! AND of course the ultimate menu standout ......you guessed it....THE PIZOOKIES are amazing! I especially LOVE the red velvet one....yummmm!
Jon H.,Lake Elsinore  CA,0,10,1,8/20/2017,1.0,My brother and I went here for lunch around 11:30am. It took about 20+ minutes to receive the appetizer (sliders) and pizza. The pizza was fine  but they did not bring the parmesan cheese  no fries with the sliders  and no refills for another 20 minutes. We had to ask 4 different people just get our items. By the time they brought the fries and parmesan cheese  we were already done with our meals. We spoke to two different supervisors/managers and they tried to fix it  but only the last guy actually took action. After I told them of the poor service  they offered free sliders. They had a lot of staff on the floor but they seem to be all scattered. Poor leadership. I forgot to mention  the sliders were actually very good and the pizza was not worth mentioning. I have to agree that the quality of the food and service has gotten down over the years. For the price you are paying for  I expect better service. It is better to just order pizza from Dominos or buy frozen pizza at Albertsons.
Danny T.,Irvine  CA,95,11,12,5/8/2017,3.0,Always busy  hard to find your waiter. Everyone is all over the place. Rude employees. They can be more organized
Jennifer H.,Orange  CA,45,151,17,11/20/2016,2.0,"Overall  I guess it was mediocre. There\'s a few reasons why I deducted two stars. First reason is plates were dirty. And when I say dirty  I mean wet with dried up leftover pieces of food like an onion or something. Second reason  service was not exactly the best. I mean  the waitress herself seem nice enough but she wasn\'t such a great ""waitress"" if that makes sense. Maybe she was extremely busy  I don\'t know but her service was definitely lacking. And my final reason is the food was not hot. For appetizer  I ordered the spinach stuffed mushrooms. This is a dish I\'ve had many times before and usually it comes out so hot that I would burn myself. This time it came out room temperature  borderline cold. Same with the pizza but it was a bit better. Still not anywhere close to ""just got out of an oven"" hot  but it was still somewhat warm. Now if you\'re wondering why I didn\'t complain to the waitress  well she wasn\'t exactly around. Our appetizer came out and we had no small plates. Our pizza came out and we had no red peppers or cheese. We needed to ask for every single thing  that is if we can find her. The food itself is not bad though. It would have been perfect if only it was hot."
Rachel T.,Irvine  CA,67,964,233,3/29/2016,3.0,3.5 BJ's has always been the bomb since day one! I remember when my sister first started taking us there in the HB location and I thought it was the cats meow! I still feel that way especially since their menu is forever changing and evolving! Sometimes we'd have lunch at the HB location while in the area getting our nails done but now that she's moved to Irvine and we've moved out of state things are so different now :(I was in town for 2 days to see my sister and we came here on our last night and I couldn't believe how packed it was for a Wednesday night! OMG! Just about every table was filled and bigger parties were coming in by the droves! Luckily my sister walks extremely fast and was able to snag a table in the bar area LOL! In the beginning the service was spotty  it took quite a bit to get menus and water  our server was slammed and was constantly on the go so I can only be upset at management not her because their wasn't enough employees. Once she was able to get us menus and drinks  we started with appetizers! Coming to BJ's is the best place for appetizers! They have so many to choose from  some to eat by yourself  some to share with your pals! We started with:-Bone in chicken wings (we like ours with sauce on the side so we can enjoy the wing on its own and dunk our own sauces on it) Their wings are always on point  I've never had a bad order of wings  their always crispy and never soggy!-Potstickers: These are my go to! I wish they gave you more! We can easily sniff these up! Their always delicious and the dipping sauce is great too! -Cup of clam chowder: The chowder is nice and creamy  not too watered down  I wish it had more potatoes but other than this is a solid choice everytime!Down to the entres LOLMy mom and sister both went for burgers and I tried one of their new Piadianas and was kind of disappointed :/ In the picture they look super ooey gooey and cheesy! However without any kind of sauce it is really dry  and the cheese was melted properly so it was kind of thick and coagulated :/ Other than that everything else was just delicious! Service got better throughout the night and my sister took home a Cookies and Cream Pizookie! I was too full and sleepy to try it but she said it was delicious! This is going to be are go to location since it's close to my sister's house and the food is always on point! ^__^
James C.,Tustin  CA,26,69,44,6/10/2017,4.0,Pick up is ok. But not when the restaurant is charging me tip without my consent  especially for take-iyt
Debbie M.,Orange County  CA,554,38,34,4/12/2017,5.0,I've always loved BJs but only recently did I begin coming for lunch. They have fantastic lunch specials and the service is always great  despite being usually busy. I also noticed their enhanced technology integrations lately  with the waitstaff taking orders on tablets and the ability to download their app and order ahead. My friend and I tried that last time we went for lunch and enjoyed that our food was ready right after we arrived.
Karim S.,Irvine  CA,287,128,348,2/24/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Ok so came in to pick up an order today and the Latina lady at take out was so unbelievably rude it was ridiculous ... Just huge attitude was talking down to me like I was stupid her whole tone was just confrontational and rude... She also was reluctant to give me napkins and utensils when I asked her for extra ... Like she was too bothered... just horrible... Food business can totally be stressful I understand... I've worked in it but If you hate your job then find somewhere else to work.
Frank n Gaby T.,Tustin  CA,0,20,16,1/8/2017,3.0,Placed an order through GrubHub was 15 minutes late. Ordered a BJ's Brewhouse Burger no cheese  crispy thin seasoned fries  two house salads avocado egg rolls  bacon cheeseburger with wedge cut seasoned fries and a salted caramel Pizookie for a total of $64.45. The burgers were really greasy very old produce  the egg rolls were soggy The Salted Caramel Pizookie was not the size that you get in the restaurant and it was $7.50. One of the burgers was not supposed to have cheese and there was grated cheese burned onto the bun. The vegetables in the salad are old and wilted. The french fries were cold they did not provide wedge fries they were both shoestring so the order was incorrect everything was so greasy the only thing we ate was the burger and that is just the meat we just wasted $65 McDonald's would have been Gourmet compared to this will never be eating again from this establishment! So angry right now. Update to my review: my husband contacted the restaurant directly to put in a complaint spoke with Evan and Elin who were both very apologetic and handled the situation very professionally thank you to you both we were advised to contact GrubHub directly to deal with the issue and they credited our acct. Immediately! They also offered to remake our food and send it out with one of their own drivers in addition to a gift card which was a very kind gesture. Thank you Evan and Elin for your excellent customer service! We will give BJ's another chance.
Zari B.,Irvine  CA,12,25,21,7/11/2016,5.0,Went there on Friday & ordered Salmon with quinoa It was delicious  service was great & food was yummy!I'll definitely order the fish again! My daughter ordered salad & she really liked it! We were very pleased with everything!
Bassel ..,Irvine  CA,0,5,,9/2/2016,1.0,I LOVED coming to BJ's with friends probably 2-3 times a month. Nothing beats being able to grab a pizza  a steak  pasta  or dessert at 1 in the morning. That was until yesterday..... I feel horrible leaving this review but feel compelled to.I got to the restaurant and was greeted and seated very quickly (so far so good). I look over the menu and see the soup bowl made out of bread. Looked amazing. I didn't want the soup though so I ordered my normal tavern cut pizza along with a bread bowl. The bread bowl was amazing (for now). The pizza  so-so. It's hit and miss for some reason but I always tend to come back anyways. I eat up everything and get the tab.... $10 for a piece of bread?!? What on earth. My friend ordered the SOUP AND BREAD BOWL for $9.50. I asked the waitress why it was $10 for the bread she stated that it can't be discounted. Ok fair enough but why not charge me $9.50? AND WHERE IS MY SOUP...? That makes absolutely no sense. It's not even about the $10. I would have paid $30 for the bread if that was the cost of the bread. But don't charge me full price PLUS $.50 and then not tell me it's the same price as a full meal. Or at least give me my soup. Just didn't make any sense. Not sure if I will be returning honestly. It's sad because I truly do love BJ's. It's a great atmosphere with friendly people and close to home. I guess only time will tell.
Erin M.,Irvine  CA,144,61,14,4/13/2017,1.0,Turned off by their lack of service and weird attitude. Our server got a little spunky towards my friend when she gave her an expired ID. She keeps both with her in case of emergencies and handed her the wrong one. Also  I requested no chicken on my Cobb salad  so at the end of the meal I simply asked politely if I could have a discount for the chicken since I didn't get it on my salad. I did get a tiny bit of bacon (but I could've held that  too). The manager then came by and said they don't have a way to do a discount on their computer system...so yeah...weird response and I just felt that I didn't matter as a customer. I think in this day and age  doing a tiny discount for people who don't eat meat or who do without some meat isn't a big issue. What if we was full vegetarian and wanted a Cobb salad? There's no way to ring it in without meat for a discounted price? That's a little confusing for everyone. I work in a restaurant part-time and take off $6 on salads and lunches without chicken  beef  and fish. If it's a corporate policy  I'd gladly like to speak to corporate. Our food was okay. Hot appetizers didn't come out hot at all. Our first server took a break and our second server was really busy. But he was polite. I enjoy going to BJ's when I sit at the bar- I feel like I get better service and it's faster. It's still a good place to get a cold beer and some good pizza. *Side note- isn't it cheaper to order a plain cheese pizza rather than a pepperoni pizza? My point exactly.
Regina O.,Irvine  CA,1400,668,1920,3/25/2015,4.0,I've always had good experiences at BJ's. I usually go for their pizza's and pizookies. On my most recent trip here  my boyfriend and I ordered their Spinach & Artichoke dip  their new Spicy Hawaiian Pizza--pineapples  jalepenos  roasted tomatoes & chicken and their Balsamic Chicken Entree.The spinach and artichoke dip was really good. My only complaint is that they could've added more spinach to the dip and if it wasn't so runny. The dip was really thin and I prefer my dips to be thicker. Once we were done with the dip  my boyfriend asked our waitress for some salsa which she brought out for us with no problems or extra cost! Great way to eat up all those left over chips hehe.The Spicy Hawaiian pizza was also pretty good. I don't know what it was missing but it wasn't as delicious as we had imagined it to be. I did like how the pineapples added some sweetness to the pizza while the jalepenos added spice. It was a good twist of flavors but something was missing. Maybe use ham or bacon instead of chicken? I did like how thick the cheese was... you could literally pull and pull at it before it'd break apart. The Balsamic chicken entree is one of my boyfriends favorite plates to get here. We got it upon his request. The chicken was tender and not dry at all. The mashed potatoes was seasoned very well and I like how they added onion strings on top. Everything just paired very well with each other and it's actually a pretty generous amount of food. This place can get busy and happy hour is ONLY at the bar :/ Kind of a bummer because I hate waiting around at the bar for a table and I would rather eat my meals elsewhere. I hope they change that in the near future!
Diane W.,Rancho Santa Margarita  CA,0,5,,6/25/2017,5.0,We had an awesome dinner at the Irvine BJ's. Great service  great ambiance  great food. Although we had provided our BJ reward # to the server  it didn't get entered in the system  and then we didn't ;eave the restaurant with the actual check #. Called Howard  the manager  the next day and he went above and beyond to search for our check #  and then link it to our BJ reward #. Howard - THANKS for your extra care and concern.Also - kudos to Nick our server who also provided excellent service. We were entertaining guest from out of town and everyone was pleased. THANKS!
Cindy S.,Irvine  CA,258,311,542,4/3/2016,3.0,bj's is predictable so a nice place to go for good bar food. pizza - check  wings - check  beer - check. pizza comes in 2 forms- deep dish and thin crust. we did the deep dish and it was good but heavy. I'd recommend thin crust; all the flavor without the guilt. the wings we did with the buffalo sauce on the side. this was a first at bj's but good. wings were crispy and much better without the sauce. waitress was kind of clueless. let me give you a tip that could help you. if you want a good tip  don't tell people a girl's age!
Janelle J.,San Juan Capistrano  CA,905,390,914,8/22/2015,4.0,Tasted the pizza with banana peppers  tomato  pesto for the first time ever! It was so good. Next time I would get thin crust because it was bready for my taste. Strawberry lemonade was great! Wish we didn't have to beg for refills. Party of 10  but the waiter handled our table great. Ended up being $140 for ten people (not including the alcoholic drinks) with us ordering 2 appetizers and 3 gourmet pizzas. PAZOOKI! awesome as always. The tripleChocolate was VERY rich. My favorite was the classic chocolate chip.
Eric C.,Irvine  CA,36,62,13,8/30/2016,1.0,"So I feel really compelled to write this Review. I ordered curb side take away at 6pm for a Medium BJ Fav. Deep dish  Cobb Salad  and Bone In Lemon Flavor Wings. I called and was put on hold for 10 minutes to take my order. Basically they forgot about me. I called back again and again they said "" Can you hold on for a moment""?I mentioned I was on hold for a very long time. So they took my order. First mistake. The lady on the phone was so out of this world  I had to literally spell out my order. I even asked her to repeat the order back. Curb side take away  so the food was on time. The lady at the take out desk brought all my food. Even opened the pizza box which showed my pizza really fast. I asked again  "" Is this deep dish""? She replied  Yeah yeah  no problem deep dish. Second Mistake  trusting a BJ\'s employee who just wanted to get off work ASAP. Came back home and opened all the food  cobb salad  regular NON Deep dish pizza  and some of the DRIEST CHICKEN NUGGETS ON THE PLANET.( no bone inn)I called to speak to the manager  THIRD MISTAKE. Lady on the phone replied"" Can you hold on for a second""?After holding for 7 minutes  FORGET IT. I\'m through with BJS at Irvine Blvd/Jamboree. To be fair  when I picked up my order. The place wasn\'t even busy at all. They really train their STAFF and Execute. WONT BE BACK."
Mahesh S.,Irvine  CA,809,380,259,2/26/2016,3.0,Its always a hit or miss at this place. but I go here for the deep dish buffalo chicken pizza which is my absolute favorite  and for the pizookie  so the service never bothers me. They can smile a little more  and ask if you need water or something a few extra time  or bring the salsa before you finish your food  but oh well. just dont get any complicated order beyond getting a pizza  and you will be fine! and note to self: dont order the steak here. take your $$ and go to TAPS next door. your money mind and wallet will thank you!
Jamie N.,Costa Mesa  CA,625,506,3728,3/21/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Okay  I know BJ's is a chain with guests packing the house nightly  but what I find most worthy is their selection of bottled beers. If you love Belgians  this may be the go-to spot you hate to admit going to  but the list is pretty legit.My brother is a fan of Belgian beers with Chimay Blue at the top of his list  but he often ventures into sours  trippels  dubbels  and IPAs. And believe it or not  BJs is also one of his favorite places for beers. We decided to grab dinner and some beers. He got his Chimay Blue and I tried something new  a sour! I had Supplication recently and although I liked it  it was much more tart than I expected. Petrus Oud Bruin is a wonderful introduction to sours as the dark  caramel brown ale has a slight sour tang without being overwhelming. I totally dig sours now! Can't wait to try more :)For dinner  I wasn't very hungry  so I just got the usual bar fare and a salad. I rarely eat salad as a meal  but roasted beets has been a favorite recently. This one was superb and only $4! It's in the healthy section lol. Dried cranberries  sweet yellow beets  strawberry balsamic vinaigrette and arugula - I would love to have this again.And then I ordered wings. Theirs is drizzled with a buffalo ranch  but it's pretty sparse so it doesn't sog up the crunchy wings. Bro got a burger sandwich or something with their famous potatoes wedges. It's a must have for him  the potato wedges haha. After finishing his Chimay  he also got Goose Island's Sofie  a Belgian-Style Saison (Farmhouse) Ale. I used to come here for pizookies  but now I'm all about the beers. Impressive! I'll be back lol
Sanjay D.,Irvine  CA,195,34,33,5/31/2017,5.0,One of our favorite dinner places in Irvine. We've already visited BJ's on Jamboree several times  and few times with my parents on select occasions. Today was no different. My father and mother gave a nice dinner party to their grandson Rohan for graduating with Aerospace Engineering degree from UT Austin and finding a great job at SpaceX. We enjoyed the hot appetizers (Fried Asparagus  Stuffed Mushrooms and Spinach/Artichoke dip) with shots of beer (whereas I don't drink  I saw that my family enjoyed the samples.) The food arrived quick  smelled great and was freshly prepared. The main course was even better... entrees ordered included Veggie Quinoa  Deep Dish Pizza  Penne Pasta  Tacos and Portobello Burger. Each entree was prepared well  served hot and tasted awesome! The pasta was just a bit heavy with red tomato sauce. We pretty much finished all our food except a couple of slices of pizza (which will make a nice lunch for one of us.) A trip to BJ's is never complete without the final guilty pleasure... I mean the Pizookie. We were so stuffed though... so we only ordered the mini-version for our parents. They loved it! We laughed  talked loudly  shared stories and just had a fun time. Look forward to our next BJ's outing in the future...
Kevin J.,Huntington Beach  CA,111,129,262,10/6/2016,3.0,"Came in for #nationalpizookieday the other night. If you spend $10  you can get whichever pizookie you want!! I haven\'t been to this location in years let alone a BJ\'s in general. This location is pretty big like most locations and has a lot of ""outdoor"" seating with televisions everywhere. I love how you can basically sit anywhere an at least see the screens. It\'s a great place to watch sports games on Thursday  Sunday  and Monday. I\'ve been here in the past and all I can remember is that the beer is actually pretty good and the pizza is pretty average. I came in the other night and did not order either. Instead  I ordered a flat bread pizza because it was later at night and it seemed like a lighter options. We had the Italian pizza with sausage and peppers. It was pretty average just like the deep dish. It wasn\'t packed on with toppings and had a lot of crust. I probably wouldn\'t get it again. The highlight of the night was the free pizookie. I got the monkey pizookie with vanilla ice cream. This was actually really good. Instead of a cookie  it was a cinnamon bun that was nice and moist. I loved every bite of it and would totally order it again. Lastly  I thought the service was excellent. Our server brought me back refills without me even asking. Overall it was a good experience and I would come back again!"
John A.,Santa Ana  CA,2,33,5,2/2/2017,1.0,The worst service you can imagine. I work nearby and I regret every time I have come into this place. I usually say review the food  but I left after waiting 15 minutes to order.
Yvonne R.,Irvine  CA,3,32,1,4/18/2017,1.0,I've gone here at least 5x giving it a chance every time. From mistakes on order  being forgotten  long wait time and incorrect billing  my boyfriend and I previously went to catch a hockey game and ordered the pepperoni pizza deep dish. The server was incredibly helpful and friendly. However  I got food poisoning and within hours of eating had the worst sickness I've felt from a restaurant. Scary  so I won't be visiting this location again.
Luis L.,Los Angeles  CA,0,10,,6/16/2017,5.0,I jut finished having dinner with my dance team (our banquet for the end of the school year and performance year at UCI) and Mackenzie E. was absolutely amazing. She was beyond graceful  funny  had a real personality and I appreciated her service more than she knows (especially because I was a server too). She handled everyone's orders with such ease and brought me both my Pink Cadillac and White Peach margarita so quickly. The drinks were perfect. Not too much alcohol  just the right amount. I hope that the company really looks out for and appreciates the work Mackenzie does because if the job is draining on her  she doesn't show it one bit. Thank you again Mackenzie. -Lulu (the guy with the purple hair at 88.9 FM)
Salina G.,Tustin  CA,595,48,1857,8/6/2016,1.0,I tried to mention the free appetizer with check in on Yelp and she changed subject and never brought it ?!
Lina S.,Irvine  CA,4,27,10,8/3/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Horrible experience today. We went to celebrate daughter's graduation.We ordered a salmon entree from Gluten free menu and told the waitress my husband is celiac  please make a note saying allergy. And we even asked the manager to take care of the order himself. Both waitress and manager promised there won't be any problem.After we ate half way  we were curious what kind of gluten free sauce made the meal tasted so good. Actually it alerted us. We asked the waitress to ask the chef what kind of sauce they put on the salmon and rice. Surprisingly and disappointedly enough  the kitchen messed up!!! They put the pasta contained rice pilaf in a gluten free dish!!!!We have been put Bj's as a regular eating out place just for their gluten free menu  this was really unacceptable!! Please take every order seriously!!!!!
Dennis H.,Irvine  CA,211,621,557,12/22/2015,4.0,Oh man  I've been here over 30x and I didn't realize I never wrote a review.Well  my fav place to hang out during football season. Find a boot in the bar area and kick back for the next 3 hours (or 6 :D ) BJ's food is good but nothing great. BUT it keeps me coming back. Some of my fav items (btw always happy hour when there's an NFL game)- Avocado Egg Rolls- Sliders- Brussels Sprouts (it's new)And of course the PIZZA!! The flat bread pepperoni one is great if you don't want anything heavy. But I say 80% of the time I'm getting deep dish. Until recently I didn't know you could do a 50/50 on the deep dish meaning  a supreme on one half and cheese lovers on the other.Where have I been!??!!Drinks are great! BJ's own brews are always good. I particularly like their mixed beers like their Snake Bite which is half Guinness and half cider ale.
Ken C.,Irvine  CA,184,37,77,11/8/2016,3.0,I been here few times and realize this each time... the front staff needs to be more welcoming. When I walked in  no one greeted me and no one acknowledged me or the two other people behind me. The delivery team were polite and did a great job but I think the server was just A ok. Not very engaging and helpful with our questions. I thought the food was a bit overpriced for what I received. Overall solid experience but could have been better.
Nili H.,Irvine  CA,0,24,1,8/31/2017,5.0,Excellent food and beer can only be framed by fantastic service offered by Nick whose natural ability to make you feel fully cared for after a long day at work makes a memorable night on a Thursday. This is a chain restaurant but is ran like a neighborhood joint. I first tried this place because of my company's Christmas party. Now My friends and I love coming here with friends for their great customer service  thin slice pizza and it's proximity to work. I will definitely come back here with my friends.
Kenneth W.,Irvine  CA,0,9,,5/27/2017,5.0,Just enjoyed tonight's dinner at BJ's. The finicky kids always find something they like here. Food is as good as usual. But I want to give an extra kudos to our server  Justin. I left my credit card behind at the restaurant by accident  and Justin waved us down just as we were pulling out of the parking spot to return my credit card. That's going above and beyond! So thank you Justin!!! I hope management recognizes you for your outstanding service! Will be back here soon!
Emilio D.,Tustin  CA,23,7,3,5/26/2017,1.0,Came here for dinner with my wife. Friday  9pm. Waited a few minutes then we were shown to our table. Then we just sat there for TWENTY MINUTES and no one came to serve us. NOT A SINGLE PERSON. Finally we got up and walked out  to Lazy Dog Cafe next door. Before leaving I made sure to let the manager know what happened and he just shrugged it off. Never coming here again.
Faud H.,Costa Mesa  CA,49,63,30,7/24/2016,3.0,The food is inconsistent & not too GR8. But this is one of the bigger BJ's and have a nice bar & patio area.
John B.,Tustin  CA,77,1,,1/22/2017,5.0,The tvs have issues during rain.  We had to go next door to watch the playoffs on the same satalite channel because bjs tvs were out.
Bob R.,Irvine  CA,2,25,6,12/7/2015,2.0,It use to be my favorite to spot heading home. No more great happy hour. The bartenders aren't happy  customers including me are not. Prices are alot higher as an example my chicken wings (5) were $4 until 7 pm now are $11.95 with 10. Beer is $1.00 off. I walked in tonight with Monday night football normally packed. I had a choice of 7 seats in front of TV screens. The regular customers I see nearby at Dave's BBQ and Islands which have great beer prices and better food choices also until 7 pm. I use to come here 5-7 times per month. Now it will be once at best only because of great bartenders. My suggestion switch back. Whoever made these changes at corporate needs a course in what brings crowds to a once great restaurant. I know blame it on Donald Bren  but this income level has to be dropping. Hotelconsult@aol.com Bob
Lyndsi B.,Costa Mesa  CA,0,3,,10/29/2016,3.0,We have visited a number of bjs locations in the past few years but this was our first time at this location.  We were not impressed and will not be returning.  Many staff members were standing around doing nothing even though the restaurant was clearly needing to be serviced. They took over 30 minutes to bring out three meals and forgot to bring my side of toast. They finally brought it out as I was finishing the rest of my meal.
Sarah K.,Orange  CA,0,63,5,3/25/2017,3.0,Bjs is always packed but the food quality is better than bar food quality and the menu is giant so it keeps me coming back. The biggest highlight of bjs is for sure the pazooki ( a giant cookie baked in a cast iron skillet) which is always the perfect way to end a meal!
Scott H.,Tustin  CA,126,4,,6/30/2016,1.0,Went for my dad's birthday (6/28)  he had a terrible time. He ordered the salmon grilled  they brought it out blackened. No big deal  they said they would bring him another. The rest of us are eating our meals while my dad is eating his veggies and baked potato as his salmon is being prepared. His salmon comes  it's completely raw in the middle  sushi raw. How do you mess up twice on one person's order?Manager comes to speak to us  this guy is the most socially awkward person I've seen manage a restaurant. He doesn't understand the scenario prior to arriving to the table  and just thought my dad ordered the wrong thing  then laughs when he hears what happened. Didn't apologize about the restaurant ruining his birthday dinner  just says the salmon would be taken off the bill. Obviously it's taken off the bill  he never got the salmon! There was absolutely no point for him coming to the table  he did nothing productive. I actually never complain at restaurants  nor do I write bad reviews  but this is an exception.My dad went home hungry on his birthday  great job BJ's.
Mark B.,San Antonio  TX,44,145,63,1/27/2016,2.0,"Was having a casual business dinner and was encouraged to sit at the bar tables. Without any customers in the entry area both hostesses were standing around. We asked for a booth near the bar  but we simply got a point in the general area  so my colleague and I went on a search. The seating at the bar area was very limited and not conducive of a business dinner. We went back to the hostess and found a small crowd now. We were asked to sign in and had to wait several minutes for a table. I felt as if we should have just been given a table to begin with.Our waitress was very rushed and eager to get away from our table. She actually walked off ad my colleague attempted to order an appetizer. Our appetizers came out a short while later and we\'re great. Our waitress eventually surfaced again for a fly by ""you guys doing ok?"" She was already gone before we could respond and tell her we wanted to place an order. After we flagged her down we placed our orders. I was unhappy to find that the pork chops I have come to love are no longer on the menu. I decided to order the fish and chips.BJ\'S has always had good everything so I was sorely disappointed when my fish was the worst I have ever had. The bottom of the dish had a pool of grease that the fish was sitting in. It left the batter greasy and soggy. There was so much greasy batter that I eventually had to peel it off to get to the fish. There were so many misses during my visit that I will not be a returning customer."
Marjorie N.,Corona  CA,99,314,30,7/25/2016,3.0,"Service was  eh. We came late on a Saturday night for a ""small"" dinner and but mostly beer for hubby. Hostess said our wait would be 15 minutes which surprised me because there were quite a few people waiting before us. Thankfully it was more like 20. Anyway  our waitress was nice enough. She took our drink and dinner order promptly. We shared a small California pizza. My husband had three of their different beers that he didn\'t care for. Waitress wasn\'t very helpful in suggesting anything. As soon as he stopped drinking beer during our dinner  her visits to the table to check up on us were much less frequent. Had to ask her to refill my water a couple of times. Thankful that I decided to check reviews here and saw there was a coupon for a free app or pizookie. We were able to end the dinner on a good note because that was delicious."
Kate K.,Orange  CA,55,26,1,5/9/2016,1.0,I won't be going back to this location again. We went for Mother's Day and surprisingly  were seated in less than 10 minutes (for a group of 6)! The food was decent and our server was great. We paid and left. Great.The next day  my fianc checked his bank account and noticed he had been charged twice. The first time was at the time we were in the restaurant  but the second time was almost 3 hours after we had left! My fianc went back to BJ's the next day to speak to the manager. He said she couldn't have cared less. She took the receipt and went in the back and did who knows what. She finally came back and said oops  yeah  you got charged twice. You'll have a refund in a few days  bye!What kind of service is that? First of all  how does a card get double charged...HOURS apart? Did someone there take the credit card info down  then run it again hours later? The manager offered no explanation for what happened. She was unapologetic and completely unconcerned. Definitely won't be back.
Ariana R.,Anaheim  CA,87,234,163,11/4/2015,3.0,"Came here last Friday. I absolutely love Bj\'s. But food is below standard now. Major love/hate relationship. I wish the pizza\'s were more flexible-like a build your own on the ""speciality"" line of pizzas they have; but not cost $20. Pizookies and beer are always solid. Bathrooms very very very dirty.Let\'s get it together people."
K K.,Irvine  CA,2,28,,7/2/2016,2.0,Not the BJ's it used to be. I used to come here very often back when food and service was actually solid. Portions used to be very generous too; avocado egg rolls used to be so big one would get me satisfied. Now  they're tiny and obviously unsatisfying. Service used to be very attentive and enthusiastic but I don't sense that anymore. This place is going downhill slowly.Careful BJs. Lazy Dog next door is booming with customers all the time. If I were the manager  I'd take these negative reviews very seriously. I already know a few people who don't go to BJs anymore and prefer to head over to Lazy Dog instead.
Grant V.,Irvine  CA,5,117,23,2/24/2017,3.0,Food is ok. Beer is good and pretty much the only reason you come here. Pizza was average. Chicken wings were average. They were out of the daily special at 7 pm. Pazookie is always good.
Hannah M.,Village of Oak Creek  AZ,12,17,11,6/25/2016,1.0,Very disappointed in the service from the second we walked in. I started out as a hostess and moved my way up to waitress so I know how important it is to properly greet guests at the front. We didn't even stay 30 seconds. We walked in and there was a hostess and a waitress and both of them gave us dirty looks and had major attitude. We didn't get any greeting when we walked in the door. They actually said nothing they just looked at us until we asked for a table for four. We spoke to the manager briefly and he didn't seem to care enough to keep our service so we left and went to Famous Dave's next door. Much better choice! This place needs a serious re-haul of front of house staff! I'll be sending a letter to corporate.
Matt R.,San Clemente  CA,135,85,25,4/28/2016,1.0,"NOPE! Literally sat here for almost ten minutes whilst several servers walked past us. We weren\'t even acknowledged or looked at  none us given and not even an ""I\'ll be right with you."" We just got up and walked out and across the road to Lazy Fog Cafe. Sorry BJs. You lost paying customers forever with this."
Jackie D.,Irvine  CA,2,93,2,2/12/2017,5.0,It's the best BJ's in OC because management will ALWAYS make things right if the service is not excellent. We have been here for office parties  huge super bowl take outs  dine in  etc. and the food and service met our expectations every time. They offer a party take out @ $130  which includes 2 pizzas  chicken wing or strips  salad  and another appetizer for 10 ppl. An extra star for their rewards program and the BJs AP - very easy to use.
Michelle T.,Sunnyvale  CA,477,471,701,8/28/2015,2.0,Came here with a party of 10-12 ish. It was a while ago  so I forgot. It was around dinner time on a weekend  so the place was packed. sWe all ordered appetizers  drinks  and entrees.They brought out small plates for us so we could use them for the complementary bread and butter. First time they brought the plates out. Dirty. Ew. Requested newer and cleaner plates. 2nd sets of plates come out. Dirty again. Ok  nasty. I am barfing up my insides. If these plates aren't clean  then I have a feeling all their other utensils  plates  bowls  glasses are just as dirty. Most definitely not coming back here.Now for the food. Honestly  I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you want some pizza. The pizza is good  but everything else is meh and mediocre. BJ's is known for their pizookies  but c'mon people! You're just paying for convenience  as you can buy a dozen cookies and a gallon of ice cream for probably cheaper.
Bruce K.,Tustin  CA,66,63,35,8/11/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,It's always a pleasure coming here. The servers are amazingly nice and great. They do their best to serve you well. The pizzas are great there! The place is pricey for a well rounded restaurant. But dates are a must here because they absolutely have the best dessert. Their pazookies are to die for! They're amazingly delicious with the warmth of the cookie and cold vanilla ice cream  with whip cream is incredible. Update: I waited 20 minutes just for someone to take my order. I've had many waiters/waitresses come by past me and my friend. I am giving 3 stars because I'm nice and patient. (I'm also tilted) Update 2.0: Same visit  I changed it to 5 stars because the waitress is a Harry Potter fan. Also she gave us a free appetizer.
Banoo F.,Irvine  CA,1,11,3,5/14/2016,1.0,9:30 pm on Sunday  when we came in the hostess was chit chatting with the other coworker  didn't even ask us if we want to be seated  sure enough I asked them if I need to be seated .what I received was ruling eyes.Great!!! Waitress took forever to come back after she brought us water  to take the order ...really???
Paul R.,Irvine  CA,1,283,2,10/4/2017,5.0,we enjoy BJ's whenever wherever they are consistent great food great prices great specials great happy hour great service the fundamentals of any good restaurant
Milee S.,Irvine  CA,306,1076,503,10/21/2015,4.0,I think BJ's has a love/hate relationship with patrons. Either you love it or hate it. I really enjoy BJ's. It seems to please all palates  the beverage list is great  and the food is filling. Plus  how can you pass up a Pizookie?I have been here a ton of times  so my review is not specific to one visit. I've had reasonable to outstanding service  and when something just didn't come out right  the manager has turned it around. I tend to favor the bison burger or the deep dish mini veggie pizza. I find the small is good enough to share so I've done that with a salad. Keeps the costs and calories low. But they do have great burgers  pasta dishes  soups  combo plates and fantastic calamari. If I'm drinking  I like the Berry Burst. I will say the Bloody Mary is a go-to.There are usually large groups of high school students dining here on weekends  or families celebrating birthdays so beware of that. Parking is easy and they have a membership card  so get those points to get the free Pizookie!
Melissa S.,Irvine  CA,0,4,,3/22/2017,5.0,The food is AMAZING! i go at least once a month because i need a pizookie every now and then. The employees are incredibly nice and helpful when it comes to selecting a food entree.
Janice O.,Irvine  CA,28,139,76,12/27/2015,3.0,Food- 2 1/2 stars First time at BJ's with my boyfriend. It was okay. Let's just say that I expected more.. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. We got the calamari appetizer  sirloin steak with the clam chowder & rice pilaf  mini BJ's pizza  and the chicken Alfredo. The calamari was just your basic calamari with marinara and tartar sauce. Steak was soft and good  but the rice pilaf tasted frozen and kinda gross along with the clam chowder that was not even hot and way too salty. BJ's mini pizza. I was so disappointed. And my boyfriend's chicken Alfredo was sooo undercooked. We were starving and didn't want to send it back cuz it would take too long and we had to go. I would give BJ's another chance but hopefully this time  we order the right things.
Stacy F.,Chino  CA,0,10,5,4/16/2016,1.0,Absolutely HORRIBLE! No words can explain how unorganized  dirty and just rude servers. We waited 30 minutes to be seated at what was the smallest table! Our appetizer came out with our main meals appetizer was cold. Our spoons knives and forks all dirty I washed them myself in water. They messed up our bill adding 10$ for no reason. Waited another 20 minutes to find our server to fix the bill. We finally left FINALLY and now my husband has food poisoning he had a glazed salmon. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!
Casey T.,Irvine  CA,165,40,72,5/5/2016,4.0,What's not to like. Came in on a double date and were seated in a very timely manner. Our server was rather new. She was still being trained with another server but she did an awesome job. We ordered the avocado egg rolls to start and devoured those hot delicious beauties quickly. We then ordered a great white pizza and it was sooo good. I might order thin crust next time because they're so huge and bready a bit more than I like but I still loved the flavor of the pizza. Ad to end our meal was the always amazing Chocolate Chip PAZOOKI!!! I love it and will be back for another very soon!
Christina D.,Irvine  CA,9,41,237,8/28/2015,5.0,To corporate: let people order off menu items like the artichoke spinach again. It's our favorite pizza and half the reason we come to bjs (the other half is pizookies)To Donna: thanks for being awesome and getting your managers to let us order our favorite pizza even though it's some new rule that we shouldn't be able to. That's great customer service.To hostess: thank you for changing our seat. We hate to be that person but that corner seat sucks (we also saw 3 other couples ask to move so we know everyone hates that seat lol)
Bri S.,Buena Park  CA,213,4,,2/9/2017,5.0,Came on a Thursday night. We were seated right away. Jennifer greeted us not really knowing if we were her table  but she noticed we hadn't been greeted. She apologized for the wait and took amazing care of us for the rest of our visit. Very personable  attentive to detail  extremely nice. Clean restaurant. Wish we lived closer so we could visit more often  but we will be back if we're ever in the area.
Jeff G.,Tustin  CA,38,55,29,7/25/2016,4.0,A great place for a quick bite or a casual lunch. The appetizers are highly shareable and delicious. Wash it all down with a craft beer.
Silvia G.,Orange County  CA,632,668,3195,9/9/2014,3.0,I've only been to BJ's when it's been suggested by friends or like last weekend  we went to redeem a gift card we got years ago.I've had the pizza and its not bad but not something I'd crave.This time I decided to try the Honey lime Scallops and unfortunately couldn't find anything positive about it. Scallops were seared to the point they looked a bit burnt. Rice was bland. The asparagus were just old and chewy. After combining the sauce with the rice  it was more flavorful but the sauce was too peppery.To top it off  my strawberry lemonade was too sour and my free salted caramel pizookie (free if you sign up to their rewards) was toooo sweet. The ice cream was ok but the cookie portion was packed with sugar (and I have a sweet tooth too!!!)I'd give them 2.5 stars for the food I had but our server was nice and attentive (refilling my lemonade before I asked  etc) so I'll round it up to 3.Sorry BJ's  unless we get another gift card  I wont be seeing you soon.
Val S.,Carlsbad  CA,0,34,6,4/22/2016,1.0,This place was exquisitely bad. First they handed us a pager for when our table was ready  pretty normal. But when it went off they had us get in a line with a bunch of other people whose pagers went off  which defeats the purpose.We didn't have utensils for the first 30 min. The whole thing took over 2hrs.The boneless wings did not taste like chicken  more like a mix of plastic and some sea creature you aren't supposed to eat.The deep dish pizza was basically a pile of wet bread with almost no sauce and glue like cheese.The corndogs were burnt on the outside and raw dough on the inside.My baked potato was gray and slimy. Seriously how do you mess up a baked potato? All it takes is an oven and a potato!The sliders were sickly sweet and the buns looked like they had been colored with a yellow highlighter.The queso was fuzzy. That's the only way to describe it  a fuzzy texture in your mouth.Even the fries were weird. Who leaves most of their fries uneaten? That never happens  but at this place it did.Afterwards all of us felt ill.Gordon Ramsay would have dropped F bombs in all directions here.We should have know after seeing the huge and confusing menu. Potstickers and jambalaya and pizza and pasta and burgers and seafood. This place has no idea who it is. It's searching or itself on a long road trip across America and making bad decisions in bars.Do yourself a favor  skip this place.
Anthony D.,Laguna Niguel  CA,15,40,37,5/23/2017,5.0,"Oh BJs... How I\'ve loved to hate you at times; due to inconsistent service at several locations throughout southern Cali. But not last night. I was LITERALLY blown away by the service we received. I rarely walk into retail or restaurants within 30 min of closing  simply because I know how one or two tables straggling in late can slow down the closing process. I confess I was that guy last night  coming in late and sitting at the bar already having my order ready when the server came by to grab our waters. ( my GO-TO: buffalo chicken deep dish  no celery  no onion ). I could tell the gentlemen taking care of us might have been a bit tired after a long slow shift however that did not stop him from flashing a welcoming smile and going above and beyond with waiting on our table. He was stealthy on our H2O refills without us even having to ask or do the casual ""look around for your server cause I\'m getting thirsty"" neck turn lol. He didn\'t seem bothered by simple requests like more buffalo sauce on the side or extra lemon for my glass of water. The pizza hit the spot as always and he made sure that we were 100% satisfied with the meal. We ended up scarfing our meals down before they even hit closing time which was perfect seeing how the dining room/bar was still 25% full at the time we left. Couldn\'t have been more happy with the quick bite to eat and great service we encountered. I gladly tipped our server 75% because give credit when credit is due should be practiced more often in food&beverage business\'. I threw away my receipt so I will update this review with the great servers name for any of you fellow yelpers looking to get the best BJs experience in the good ole OC. ( server: tall gentlemen  clean cut  with a few small arm tats). ILL BE BACK"
Taehee Y.,Santa Ana  CA,1,3,,10/15/2016,2.0,My family and I have been going to BJs for many years and it has been an enjoyable place to eat and just spend time with family. However  our most recent experience has broken this perfect image of BJs due to the impolite and insensitive behavior of our waiter. The waiter was very rude with her actions and seemed to be trying to do the least amount of work possible. She was extremely hasty and rudely commented back as we asked a question. Every year we go to BJs bringing our family and friends with higher expectations knowing our service will be ecstatic. But  due to this one experience I think it will be hard to think of BJs as the once welcoming place it once was.
McKenna F.,Berkeley  CA,160,4,,10/16/2016,2.0,"Came here a few weeks ago for snacks and dessert for my birthday after receiving terrible service at another restaurant. We ordered a few snacks and the pizookie platter which were all delicious. Our waitress  however  could not have cared less about our table. We watched her talk to another table  possibly with people she knew  almost the entire time we were there. She never came to check on us. At one point my friend\'s phone slipped between two pieces of the booth seat and could not get it out. We asked her for help while she was still taking her table  and instead of helping  she says ""hold on  I have another table to check on"" and walks to the table right next to us to ask them how they\'re doing! Meanwhile  we\'re taking apart the booth seat to attempt to retrieve the phone. Unreal. Food was fine. Service was terrible."
Thao P.,Irvine  CA,0,8,,2/14/2017,3.0,We waited a long time to get our food and Jennifer our waitress was kind enough to recognize this. She brought Caitlyn the manager out even though it was a special valentines dinner for my family nothing else was offered accept an apology.  Jennifer came out and took the initiative to make things better and for that I am grateful. It really is not about anything other than recognizing the shortcomings and doing something about it. Thank you to the best server at BJ's! P.S. In all fairness when the manager Caitlyn heard that the pizza was cold she came out and took care of the dessert that Jennifer offered.  My compliments on the teamwork.
Christina M.,Hillsboro  OR,21,382,727,11/9/2015,4.0,BJ's is a great place to come watch a sporting event. I really enjoy their deep dish pizzas and they have an excellent chicken fettuccine alfredo. The fettuccine alfredo has been hit or miss as of late but when it's on  it is very good and is my favorite place to get that dish from. I highly recommend ordering the root beer to complement whatever entree you decide on.The service really varies depending on who your server is. We have had excellent service on some visits and during others it seemed like the waiter / waitress forgot we were there.This location does tend to get quite busy  especially if there is a big game on. You can call ahead to put your name on the wait list or add it online. It's nice to not need a reservation way in advance but still be able to reduce the amount of time spent waiting at the restaurant. 4 stars.
Cheyne T.,Tustin  CA,1061,746,277,3/10/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Their actual food is just okay  I usually stick with their deep dish pizzas because those are decently good. Most of the time I just come here to get their famous pizookies for dessert! It's not listed on their main menu  but you can order a mini size for about $3 if you can't finish the regular size. Also you can split two flavors in one pizookie. Customer service isn't the best  but I don't really expect it here I guess. Be sure to sign up for their rewards app program so you can earn points towards redeeming rewards!
Natasha N.,Orange County  CA,861,314,3613,5/8/2014,4.0,My boy friend got together about over 20 of my friends to surprise me at Bj's Restaurant & Brewhouse on my birthday. I was totally thrown off and thought we came here to say happy birthday to one of his guy friends. I was in total shock when I saw my friends *TEARS* and very amazed how they all kept quiet for a WHOLE month! You guys are awesome!!! :D Our party was sat out in the patio area with two long tables side by side. It was easy enough for me to migrate back and forth to each table to chit chat with my buddies. The service was amazing for us and they made sure that everyone placed their order  got their order  and came back to make sure if anyone needed anything else. They also gave me a pizookie for my birthday (: and was searching for my cake  but we were holding it already (haha). Food I've ordered in the past: Avocado Egg Rolls - so crunchy and tasty!!! Totally recommended! BBQ Chicken pizza - delicious! great combo with the bbq sauce and chicken (they are known for their pizzas) Mediterranen Pizza - very interesting and exotic type of pizza Food we ordered on my birthday: Pork Chops - the meat was so soft and the potatoes were so creamy and buttery Jalapeno Burger - super yummy! if you are into jalapenos then this burger is for you!Calamari - super crunchy and the squid taste perfect! Pizza (others got many options) to share with each other) - usually very good! Fettuccine Alfredo - my best guy friend said it was delicious The Jambalaya Pasta - couple of friends ate this dish and they said they really enjoyed it Drinks:Adios my friend - it is exactly what it sounds like! ahahah Buhh Byeee to meehhh!Island Sunset - it is almost like another version of a Long Island (: Overall  this is one of the top birthday events I ever had! Thanks Bj's  my boyfriend  and my friends for making this wonderful event happen!! :D
Kenji U.,Irvine  CA,3,47,81,7/3/2016,3.0,Food is good but pretty pricey. I usually just come when my girlfriend wants dessert. The pizookies are pretty good but pretty heavy on the sugar side. One of those restaurants you'd go out to on a special day when you want something fancy. Try it out!
Nijole T.,Los Angeles  CA,3026,6297,4928,5/2/2015,2.0,There is really too much great food in the area to end up at BJ's.That being said I still did and was not really thrilled about it.Full  noisy  overworked staff that got my order wrong.It took so long to flag her down and let her know I was over ordering something else.I had some of the pizzas we ordered for the table and they were fine.Nothing stellar  pretty pricey for the quality and there would be a ton of places I would rather go for pizza.Location is nice  but filling it this much with people really ruins being able to have a descent conversation.Not horrible  but I wouldn't bother coming back.
Kayla H.,Garden Grove  CA,31,53,222,6/6/2016,3.0,Food was decent. Came out in a timely manner. -2 stars is because our waiter forgot to give us utensils. It was a bit of a wait for them. She didn't even bother to give it to us I had to ask the lady who came out with our food.
Rick M.,Tustin  CA,45,8,13,1/25/2017,4.0,This BJ's (Irvine) was very good tonight. I ate their Shrimp & Asparagus Penne  it was delicious! My wife had their Roasted Salmon Quinoa Bowl and loved it as well. Good food  Good service  Good time.
Henna K.,Irvine  CA,0,4,,4/30/2017,1.0,We used to love coming here - we would come at least once a month. We had a horrible experience at our last visit. I don't know if we will be going back here. The food is great  service is TERRIBLE. It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to get your menu or for any of the waiters to recognize that you are there. I don't recommend going here if you are looking for excellent service that will get your check correct and won't overcharge you.
Jonathan S.,Irvine  CA,1,26,1,1/6/2017,1.0,**Not a place to bring your family - unless they all drink and love to be loud**My wife and I were having a casual date night on a Friday. Place was fairly crowded and we felt fortunate to get a seat in their extended seating area. Soon after sitting down we didn't feel that way though.An entire area of the seating section was dedicated to a group of about 20 people who were doing shots and other libations all while screaming and laughing - playing their drinking game I guess. There were families with children around us and you could see the discomfort on the parents faces. It was useless for my wife and I to try to have a conversation over our dinner because it was so loud. As we were preparing to pay and get out of there we asked if the manager was available to talk with and draw his attention to this issue. After giving him our feedback he was ambivalent in his response. I think his calculation was this is a group of 20  paying top price for each of their drinks  2 customers don't matter.  So sad  I liked BJs until I talked with the uncaring manager.
Erika R.,Orange County  CA,108,197,592,5/9/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"Came back again after 2 years since my last review only because 11 of my family members wanted to come here AND a few of them were from out of the country. Unfortunately  my previous 1 star experience still stands. LONG STORY SHORT: Conveniently  the 1 person who paid with a $100 bill didn\'t receive his $80 in change at the end of the night. Everyone -with the exception of him- was personally handed their check inside a black book. Our server  Devin B  claimed that she left it on the table and had the nerve to say  ""Maybe one of you guys took it!"" Rude! After my aunt explained the situation to the manager  he went to investigate and came back rather quickly with $80 in cash and stated that Devin didn\'t have any extra money on her. Suuuuuuuure! Now  not only are my bf and I FOR DAMN SURE not coming back  neither is my family! Adios again  BJ\'s!! =]"
Susan G.,Santa Ana  CA,40,24,,2/2/2017,4.0,Although I hate to write reviews regarding chain restaurants the Ahi salad is pretty darn good  tasty fresh and served quickly. Lunch is busy but still was served quickly.
Stephanie A.,Irvine  CA,19,42,,12/19/2016,1.0,They sent me a promotion for 1/2 off ur 1st delivery so I was happy to try it. The food came cold. When I called to complain  the mgr said that it was because of the cold weather & that they didn't have warming bags to deliver with. I'm guessing that if ur going to enter the delivery market  u should get the rt equipment to keep food warm. I waited for the mgr to apologize but she never did. Do not get food delivered from bj's unless u r ok w warming ur food at home.
Kaila K.,Irvine  CA,12,72,53,5/14/2016,3.0,Good food bad service.Receiptionist Stephanie was the worst  very rude and straight up blew me off when i asked her how long the wait would be
Gabriela S.,Laguna Niguel  CA,49,288,1087,9/21/2015,4.0,For once we had a great waiter who was enthusiastic and on a top of things as well as flexible with some food substitutions.The Bison Burger is always fantastic and the chicken Mediterranean pitas were great as well.I do wish they had more bottle beer choices (import) as not everyone likes brewery heavy beers and their light beer is like watered down ale.I do have to say that the hostess should either start taking some happy pills or change her profession- she was so miserable and unfriendly that if it wasn't for already being 2pm and us needing to eat before heading up to Pasadena I would have gone someplace else. How can you have a front person with such a lack of customer service?
Alisha G.,Holladay  UT,24,28,12,10/31/2016,1.0,The WORST!!!! Our server was barely present  we asked for an extra spoon and waited almost 15 minutes  our soup became cold and when we asked for it to be reheated waited 20 minutes (Clam Chowder was overly thickened with flour and had a floral hint to it  Calamari was under fried and oily  too much sugar in the tartar sauce which is a sign of it being jarred  the pizza...ALL DOUGH...it was way to processed) !!! The restaurant and bar are far from crowded so there was no reason for the unprofessional service. Oh well...next time I want to go out I will avoid coming here and suggest you do too.
Jessie L.,Sacramento  CA,54,109,122,10/2/2015,5.0,My favorite BJ's! If you are a beer fan  try the Jeremiah Red. It is tastey! The parking here is decent. Haven't not waited to be seated when coming to any BJs  unless we snag a random bar seat or we have call ahead with large groups. I don't mind the wait since I love their food. Rarely get a bad server. We did get one girl here with a big group once. She had a huge attitude and was very rude. Not to worry she got the tip she deserved. Nonetheless the service is good 99% of the time. I must say there are a few things here I secretly desire like always. The tomato mozzarella small bite  the sweet pig deep dish (droooool)  the pazookis  and their beer on draft. My counterpart part can't help but order the black n blue burger everytime. He says it's hit or miss with how well the do the blackened part  but still says it's good nonetheless.Attributes: plenty of Tvs with games on  good for loud parties  large parties  vegan/veggie friendly options  best pizzzzza  beer on tap  easy to find location. I recommend all day long.
Tienanh C.,Costa Mesa  CA,14,38,12,3/9/2016,2.0,If it's your first time here  be prepared to do some reading...their menu is a book! I've heard many times that they're known for their pizza  but I just don't have enough time over lunch to wait for the pizza. After realizing that I've spent way too much time going through the menu  I settled on ordering the Salmon  which was good  but the portion was not very filling. We also ordered the artichoke dip  which was good  but not anything spectacular. So for the food  overall  it was just okay. Maybe I should have tried the pizza.The pricing for a place like this was not out of line...I just expected a bit more food for what I paid. The service was fine. Food came out in a timely manner. Server came to check on us routinely. I probably would not come back here  unless I was meeting someone else for lunch. It's not that the place was so bad  but more so that there were plenty of other restaurants around (some of which I've been to and had a much better experience).
Aaron C.,Irvine  CA,0,39,1,12/4/2016,3.0,I love the fact they serve breakfast. Always a seat and you can watch the early games. Good service. Good management. Only downside is every time I order eggs over easy the eggs are cooked too hard and the bacon is over cooked. They need to monitor the cooking time. Please change this and I will keep coming but if I have to send the eggs back again  I will need to go elsewhere.
Jodie L.,Orange  CA,0,28,2,6/11/2017,4.0,Good service and good pizza. Save room for a pizookie as dessert. The chocolate chip flavor pizookie is definitely tasty!
Patrick A.,Anaheim  CA,7,281,58,4/11/2016,3.0,Stopped in here before a basketball game down at the terrible MMTSC down the road and enjoyed an appetizer and beer at the bar. Great selection of beers  Masters on TV and friendly people working and hanging out. It was one of the better experiences I've had at a BJ's bar.
Corey E.,Lakewood  CA,188,199,330,6/7/2015,4.0,This is the perfect place to come for a nice night out with the family or to watch the game. The atmosphere here is awesome and the food is great.I had the deep dish Mediterranean pizza and it was awesome. They have a nice selection of draft beers and a full bar. What will really get you in trouble are the nice desserts. I highly recommend this place.
Paul L.,Orange County  CA,32,74,8,1/14/2016,1.0,I've been to this establishment 3 times. Each time  my experience would get worse and worse. Just recently  the 3rd time was it. I obtained food poisoning the first time  negligent service the 2nd time and 3rd  rude and unprofessional treatment from the general manager. I wont go in detail about the lack of treatment in this review  but no one should be belittled by the manager or anyone for that matter. I suggest if you had to to talk to a manager  suck it up and leave or dont bother talking to them.
Jessica D.,Irvine  CA,0,4,2,8/9/2016,1.0,I like this restaurant  but today  my friends and I were sitting on the patio and our waiter tried to pick up too many items at once  dropping several glasses of water and drenching me and the two people beside me  and also my entire purse. Accidents happen but he didn't even try to comp us for anything when we were clearly scrambling to dry ourselves and I was wringing out things in my purse to dry everything. It was so baffling to me how strange the situation was and how the waiter so easily made the damage he caused seem like no big deal.
Mike C.,Irvine  CA,5,3,2,2/29/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Really happy with the re-introduction of thin fries to the menu here. Also  the aluminum plate style for this burger is excellent. Allowed me to spread patty juice all over the place and not feel like I had to keep it contained to a restaurant style plate. As always  bar service from excellent bartenders like Lisa was perfect and I can't recommend happy hour here enough!
Heather W.,Anaheim  CA,153,50,7,10/30/2016,4.0,My fianc and I came here today to watch some football and get some lunch for our anniversary. Our waitress was Julia and she was super sweet. If you're looking for somewhere relaxing to watch football I would definitely recommend this place. We had the rootbeer wings for the first time and they were amazing!!! We will be back.
Adithi R.,Tustin  CA,0,14,1,11/3/2016,5.0,I love BJ's I go here all the time with my family. The waiters and customer service is nice and also the food is amazing I would recommend this place. Only negative is that it is a little pricey. But other than that great. Try their pasookie
John K.,Newport Beach  CA,26,20,31,11/13/2016,5.0,just like another bjs like anywhere else. but the service speed here seems faster and friendlier than others. also for reservations make sure you got min. of 6 or more in a party. great job guys keep it up.***why are there so many upset people here.. i swear people are just too crazy into writing bad reviews like there some kind of big shot restarant reviewers.. also if writing a bad review write the pros and cons and how others might benefit from your visit.. if only they knew how hard it is to run a restaurant.. they would have some sympathy for the owners and staffs.
Jan B.,Santa Ana  CA,0,7,,11/26/2016,1.0,Ordered the monkey bread pazooki to go  hold the ice cream. Imagined how disappointed I was when I got the container home  opened it  and found almost rock hard pieces of monkey bread  REALLY? I had a flat bread appitizer  avocado  tomatoes  chicken (maybe?) and a spinach salad  both were VERY good. Don't order the monkey bread pazooki  GROSS!
C C.,Costa Mesa  CA,1,17,,11/26/2016,2.0,Ordered takeout yesterday and the toppings were minimal on both pizzas we ordered. The pepperoni large pizza maybe had 15 pieces of pepperoni and 2 pieces were pepperoni free. The BJ special pizza was much lighter on the toppings as well. Their pizza isn't cheap so disappointed in the quality.
Sue B.,Laguna Niguel  CA,0,9,1,5/27/2017,2.0,Love the call ahead for not a long wait. Justin our waiter was very nice. Out of 5 meals ordered 2 meals were terrible. Ribs dry and prime rib sandwich tasted like packaged deli meat. Not a fan of the food.
Vinnie N.,Huntington Beach  CA,459,355,82,1/20/2015,1.0,Chain restaurants are disgusting in general and BJ's is no different. It tries to be hip and cutting edge but everything on the menu screams mid-west. As in it only seems novel to those who live in a one horse town.So if Olive Garden is your idea of a fancy Italian dinner then BJ's is the place for you!This review is only based on the food as the service I usually receive here is decent or good. Happy hour prices and menu is decently priced but again  all the menu items are forgettable. I eat here for the same reason I eat at TGI Fridays  to remind myself of what horrible  boring food tastes like.
Michael T.,Foothill Ranch  CA,344,214,537,12/8/2014,4.0,This high-volume BJs is always busy  so it is usually loud and crowded. The staff does an excellent job handling the chaos.I've had multiple lunch meetings here without any incident. Keep in mind  it isn't the quietest place but it is clean and the service is usually good.The food so far has also been great. If you know BJs  you know they have great options for whatever you might be in the mood for. Just thinking about it makes me hungry!
John C.,Newport Beach  CA,11,203,5,4/22/2017,4.0,We were not expecting much since itwas chosen by a grandson. Yet we were surprised by how tasty the food was. The prime rib   served only on Fridays & Saturdays  was as good as any priced more than twice as much without the included soup or salad plus the specialty dessert. The wait staff was attentive. The place does get crowded towards the evening. This place provides good food for the money. Do note that you cannot get there via El Toro road but via a side street off El Toro. Cheers Just noted that this review was on the Irvine last cation even though I had meant this to be for the El Toro one.
Michaela B.,Orange County  CA,5,24,11,2/19/2016,3.0,My friend and I came here for the bogo lunch deal. It was pretty cool that you can choose from any of the entrees and that there aren't limitations to the deal!I ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya and the Grilled Chicken Alfredo. The jambalaya portion size was okay  there was a good amount of chicken and shrimp  which was a plus. However  the jambalaya was actually pretty salty. The chicken alfredo was really bland and I had to add salt and pepper to it. The dishes pretty much balanced each other out. I had the Chocolate Chunk Pizookie with vanilla ice cream  which never disappoints! I love pizookies.Service was good  and the server suggested that I sign up for the BJ's rewards  which is actually a pretty good deal! Overall  the food was just okay. I'll probably order something else next time. I can't complain since service was good and one entree was free!
Sheila F.,Irvine  CA,0,4,,5/24/2017,1.0,I have emailed bjs twice and still no response . We had the worst service ever. Our food was not prepared correctly  we ran out of drinks and our server was busy chatting with another customer . We usually order a pizookie but the server never asked us. We are loyalty members too. The hostess was very good she kept us updated on our booth request. You would think management would want to rectify our bad experience . ...
Spence L.,Irvine  CA,0,8,1,10/22/2016,1.0,The cooks should be embarrassed of their ability (or lack thereof) to make a pizookie.Today we ordered the trio  one of which was a peanut butter cookie (one of their classics). It was undercooked and doughy. I told my server  who was very nice about it  and she brought out another. It was clearly less cooked than the previous peanut butter pizookie - much blonder- and needed probably 4 more minutes in the oven. Not only did I not want to eat a plate full of cookie dough  but uncooked dough is a health hazard. It can cause salmonella in a normal healthy adult. I am pregnant on top of this  and it could be dangerous for my child.I was absolutely appalled at this location's inability to produce their classic dessert with two tries.
Abigail J.,Anaheim  CA,0,6,,5/11/2017,5.0,Me and my friend just had a great experience with our waiter Jordan  he was slammed with tables and was still able to check in and deliver in a timely manner. Also he was the friendliest waiter I've encountered in about 2 years! Promote him!
Jacqueline R.,Los Angeles  CA,2483,923,2566,10/31/2013,4.0,I had an INCREDIBLE experience when I dined here a few days ago! I've been to my fair share of BJ's locations  and they've all been pretty mediocre. However  I came to this location with my boyfriend this past weekend and had by far probably the best time I've ever had at a BJ's. It was pretty packed because it was the night of some local high school dance  and annoying super dressed up teenagers were all over the place in their 20+ people parties. I thought it was going to take us FOREVER to get seated  but it only took us five minutes (basically the whole time I spent using the bathroom LOL). Then  the seating hostess originally took us to a table that's located in the back section of the restaurant that is in this echo-y  different room where they had basically seated all of the loud and obnoxious teenagers. As soon as I saw that we were being seated there  I felt uneasy and was already regretting it. Either me and the seating hostess had telepathy or she could just see the expression on my face  but she then asked us if we wanted to wait for a table inside  far away from the teenagers. We said yes  and she took us back inside and was able to find us another table to sit at which was MUCH better.Once we were seated  we were immediately greeted by our hostess who was very attentive and friendly. She took our orders and it literally took like...10 minutes to get all of our food. With the restaurant being super busy  my boyfriend and I was very surprised that our pizza came out speedily! The only reason why I give this restaurant 4/5 stars is because we had ordered regular sized pizookies  and the ones we ended up getting were the small sized. However  we were not charged for the full size  so it was ok.Good job  BJ's! This might be my new favorite location.
Weon L.,Irvine  CA,82,93,1973,2/15/2015,4.0,BJ is chain restaurant which is famous forhandcraft beers from light to dark.If you want to find best one  you can try to ordersampler to drink several kinds of beersat the same time.At this time of night  we tried to drink Hefeweizen  Jeremiah Red and Light Lager.For appetizers  we ordered Avocado Egg Rolls  Thai Shrip Lettuce Wraps  Crispy Calamari Nachos Chicken Wings   Pizza etc.Most of them are delicious and good matchwith beers.There are indoor and outdoor place to drink  so it is spacious for a lot of people.It is good place to watch sports and drink handcraft beers together.
Sherry K.,Tustin  CA,752,323,829,12/10/2014,3.0,5 stars for service; our server (name escapes me) was fantastic  super nice  a good experience due to him. Bestie and I hit up BJ's because we both felt like going no further than the Tustin/Irvine area for dinner  and neither of us felt inclined to go anywhere more interesting haha!Santa Fe Spring Rolls weren't bad  not superb. certainly I could do better at home  but they arrived quickly and were a share-able quantity for more than just the two of us. We managed just fine though thankyouverymuch!I opted for the vegetarian deep dish pizza. and a house salad. The salad was tasty  definitely more than iceberg lettuce on that generous plate. The pizza was more than a bit dry though  the olives were just barely warmed through  and the cheese was hardly even melted. Bland pizza isn't how I recall BJ's of meals past!Still  like I stated before  the service was on-par  so I'll give 'em another shot one of these days :)
Kristy M.,Irvine  CA,16,77,33,9/13/2016,4.0,Make sure you sign up for a free membership to get free pizookie and points towards food. I've been here twice on Monday for the 50% off large deep dish pizzas and tarven cuts. Such a deal! ~$13 for a pizza enough for 3 people or for left overs.
Ellie Q.,Irvine  CA,52,98,137,11/8/2014,1.0,Terrible take-out food and service. It took 40 min to get our food. Everything we ordered was barely warm when they gave it to me. By the time I get to the hospital (my daughter was admitted) the food was cold and dry and hard. Yuck! We ended up only eating the two mini pizzas between the four of us. We tossed the cold cheeseburger with hard bread  the so overcooked potato skins  all the fries and BBQ beef sandwiches. Very disappointed in this BJ's.
Jorge S.,Santa Ana  CA,1,9,,10/4/2016,5.0,I love this place!!! Came in with a group of friends after out beer league softball and found seating at the bar. Our waitress (Bonnie) came up to us within a minute of sitting down  gave us menus and said she'd be right back to take our order. She came back about 2 min later and brought us waters. Took our drinks order and gave us some awesome recommendations for some grub. My buddy ordered a salad (don't judge him) and he said it was good. On her recommendation  I ordered the Irish Root Beer and damn that thing is bomb! She took our order and gave us great suggestions! Our overall experience with Bonnie was great. She cracked jokes with us throughout our visit  checked in on us regularly  and made us feel right at home! I'll definitely be back!
Yelp Is Bullshit B.,Irvine  CA,24,152,14,11/12/2015,2.0,Loved their happy hours  it saved me a few bucks. I only ordered one item from this chain  the Santa Fe spring rolls. It never failed me. However  I would not come here just for this one item. This BJ's location had better  more efficient customer service than some other ones of its chain.Food = Not good 1/5Environment = Decent 2/5Curbside Takeout Service = Decent 2/5Customer Service = Adequate 2/5Overall Satisfaction = Needs Improvement 2/5
Dave W.,Tustin  CA,44,16,6,7/3/2016,1.0,Bad service  expensive drinks and food  long lines for no apparent reason...this will be our last time. Our waitress was awful...inattentive  forgetful  and had the grace of an orangutan. This place really has kinda turned into a joke. $17 for a Flatbread medium pizza  for reals? Are you guys like Spagos now? $9 for your own home brew? Come on. Anyway  I'm sure you'll get a few suckers to pay that maybe once or twice until they figure out you're 3rd rate in every way.
Azzy O.,Orange  CA,156,106,17,10/3/2015,2.0,I decided to not pay anymore patronage to the location at The Block due to horrible customer service and give this location a try after so many years. First off  at 3:00PM it was very empty. There were booths available for at least 4 other groups of parties if needed. We were a party of 5 and a child and the hostess put us at a table w 4 chairs and where was my 2 yrs old to sit  on my lap? I asked for a booth so she won't fall or even get a highchair and she said she couldn't because there were so many reservations. As long as I remembered  there were only reservations a day ahead for parties of 8 or more. So I had to ask and she did confirm that you only need if there were parties of 8 or more and that's why we couldn't sit there. After we sat  she sat a bunch of parties of 2 or 3 people per empty booth. Why didn't her excuse as to why we couldn't get bigger table applied to them? My point was that it's not about table or booth  it's about how she was seating other 2 or 3 people that had no reservations where she could easily sat us with a child. This is not our choice of place to eat but where my daughter loves the pizza so it's the initial reason why we are here. I also let one of the manager know and he truly apologized how she handled us. Tip to hostess  when you see a child (offer highchair)  someone disabled or elderly... try to make their visit comfortable. It's not difficult because it was pretty empty at the time. There are plenty of other places to eat nearby. I was just trying to make my child happy on her birthday for her favorite pizza and pizookie.
Kayla L.,Irvine  CA,123,35,,8/20/2016,3.0,Pazookies are to die for. I also usually order the fries and the mozzerella sticks for appetizer. The pizza is excellent and so is the chicken alfredo. A little pricey though. Service is a hit or miss.
Marissa M.,Placentia  CA,28,8,,8/31/2016,1.0,Went for a quick lunch today with my mom. Found a dead fly in my roll up next to my fork and knife. Will not be coming back!
Page H.,Mission Viejo  CA,121,39,27,10/17/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"I\'ve had multiple unsatisfactory services at this BJ\'s location  and I continued to go back because it\'s near our home...but after today  I am NEVER going back. Again  this is a complaint on their customer service.This complaint is about our service on October 17th  2015  and it began at 6pm.My husband  8-month old son  and I arrived at 6pm to meet up with my parents and brother. I told the hostess that there was a reservation at 6pm under my father\'s name; instead of checking to see if they were already seated  the hostess said  ""I\'m not sure if they\'re here  but feel free to walk around and see if they are."" What?! You can\'t check to see if they\'re here?! I\'M the one who\'s supposed to do YOUR job? Ridiculous!As it turns out  my family had not yet arrived at that point; but after they did arrive  the seating hostess sat us at the BUSIEST aisle  knowing that we had a child that required a high-chair (that had to be placed in this very busy aisle  which was by the kitchen). My son\'s chair was pushed as far in as possible (so that he wasn\'t in the way)  and a bus boy STILL came rushing around the corner and collided into my son. My son got startled and started crying  of course  but I was glad that nothing had spilt on him (like hot food or a stack of plates).Right afterwards  a man named Chuck (I\'m guessing he was the manager/supervisor) came up to our table and asked us if everything was okay. We told him that  for the future  it would be best not to seat parties with a child requiring a high chair in the busiest aisle of the restaurant. He apologized and asked if he could get us anything; since we were still eating our dinner  we said we were okay at the moment.We were going to stay for dessert  but everyone was upset about the service that we decided to get dessert somewhere else.When we got the check  we were shocked that we weren\'t comp\'ed for a meal or given a discount. I was so upset that I just wanted to get the hell out of there.WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! You\'re so lucky that my 8-month old kid didn\'t get hurt! I\'m not so angry with the bus boy as I am with the hostess and manager. The bus boy was very apologetic  and I can tell he was very remorseful. But the seating hostess needs to do her job (and use common sense)  and the manager needs to know how to handle these situations better. We are NEVER coming back here."
Cindy Y.,Boston  MA,568,332,877,9/5/2014,4.0,"When you walk into BJ\'s  you are greeted with absolutely beautiful decorations  with huge TV\'s mounted high up on the walls and that intimate ambiance. It\'s definitely a great place if you just want some drinks  dessert  or a nice dinner. Service is great and food arrives pretty promptly  despite the fact that they are so busy!I came here several times  mostly for pizookies  once for brunch  and several times for dinners. While most things are ""A-OK "" what I definitely recommend are the pizookies and the pizzas!PIZOOKIES: they have a ton! There is a new one (salted caramel)  white chocolate macadamian nut  cookies and cream  triple chocolate  smores  and the classic chocolate chip (also available gluten-free). Out of those ones  my favorite has got to be the white chocolate macadamian. It\'s actually the least sweet among all of them  and that works well  in my opinion. Since this is practically ice cream and cookie  you\'re going to get a lot of sweetness. When the cookie isn\'t too sweet  it provides just the right amount of chewy  yet delicious  goodness that melts your ice cream and delivers heaven to your taste buds. The macadamian nut is amazing  because you get white chocolate bits and macadamian nuts as you bite into it. Provides a nice crunch that is great!PIZZAS: what\'s special is that their crust is thick. They do it well. The crust is thick  yet so soft but crispy on the outside. It tastes absolutely amazing. My family and I got the White Pizza  which was great. The alfredo sauce really gave the pizza a nice creamy flavor that paired well with the tomatoes on it. The mushrooms were also absolutely tasty. I had a hard time trying to stop myself from finishing all of it so my family could have some.Overall  come here for the pizookies and pizzas! Haven\'t tried their drinks  but they look great. We also got the pastas  which weren\'t that great. Not much flavor to them  although the shrimp scampi definitely wins out over the chicken pasta. Whenever I\'m craving that pizookie or thick crust pizza  I know where to go."
Rajat K.,Irvine  CA,0,33,2,2/13/2016,4.0,Dylan at BJs is a guy who goes out of his way to make rhings happen.Been going there for 10 yrs. they do a great job for the most part. They are humans and is impossible to please everyone all the time
Brenna P.,Orange  CA,34,59,2,10/16/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I came here tonight for my birthday with a group of friends  and there were 10 of us in all. Our server  Joseph B  gave some of the worst service I have ever received. He rarely refilled our waters and we had to ask multiple times  with no apologies from him. It took a while just to get sides of sauces we asked for in the first place and had to remind him. But this wasn't what really upset us. Upon paying the bill we were 62 cents short (I held the tip for later) so my friend put in a dollar then I put in the tip money ($16) and he kept it all without giving us any change. We would have given it to him anyway but we saw him shove the money in his back pocket. This was so unprofessional that he did not even give us back any change and I am not sure if that is even legal. By far the worst service I have ever received. I'm not sure if I will ever return to this location.
Kurtis C.,Anaheim  CA,154,351,56,10/27/2014,4.0,This past weekend I went to BJs for a friend's birthday dinner. It was busy  but the service was still good compared to how hectic it must've been for the staff. Anyway  my girlfriend and I ordered food a little bit after the rest of the party ordered. I don't think it took us over 5 minutes to get our order in.The food arrived for everyone else  but after they finished  our food still hadn't come out yet. I wasn't really hungry to begin with  I just didn't want to hold everyone else up because of our order so we decided to cancel it. We were by no means upset  but they tried to rush our order out anyway. In the end  they offered to comp our food which would have been fine if they cancelled it  but they also brought out the food! I felt really bad because I felt like they thought we were a charity case or some freeloaders.I won't lie  the food was really good  but it still didn't feel right. Anyway  I just felt like leaving a review saying thanks and I hope we didn't get anyone in trouble. :)
Alycia M.,San Diego  CA,434,14,1,10/4/2015,2.0,Originally ordered the mahi mahi and shrimp and it was terrible covered in a soup likeSauce  and tasted so bland and impossible to chew. Then had Santa Fe salad that tasted like cafeteria food.. Ordered pizookie which was good. Should have gotten pizza to begin with  NEVER coming back. Waitress was very nice.
Marie AK C.,Orange County  CA,1158,342,1854,1/9/2014,4.0,"Love coming here to watch sports in the bar area. Wish they showed UFC/boxing events. They have great happy hour specials. My faves are mini BJs favorite pizza  spinach artichoke dip  lettuce wraps & buffalo wings. They have a pretty extensive menu that includes pizza (of course)  salads and pastas. Make sure you save room for their famous pizookie. Believe it or not  I can kill a ""pizza platter size"" (intended to serve an entire family) by myself! Proof is in my photos :)Pros: Great menu selection. Good service. Awesome happy hour specials. The bar is a great area to watch games and sporting events. Cons: During peak hours  especially on weekends  you will have to wait to be seated."
Jerry M.,Tustin  CA,3408,776,589,1/7/2015,3.0,Good beer  i liked the red ale. Otherwise typical bar food resturant. If you like beer with pizza  burgers  chicken and something sweet for desert  you could do way worse.
N C.,Irvine  CA,1,141,787,11/10/2015,4.0,Love their happy hour specials :). Staples we always order and are never disappointed with: avocado egg rolls and the Mediterranean pizza- minus chicken  add corn. Oh. So. Good.
Emily K.,Chino Hills  CA,531,285,1669,10/1/2015,3.0,Decided to come here on a whim for one of my friend's birthday tonight. Our friends arrived first and put our name down for a table  I wasn't there to witness this but she said that the hostess looked like she hated her life and was leaning over the counter on her elbow with the bottom of her palm on her forehead when she was asking how many was in our party. Meh  I'll let it slide  maybe she had a long day. We had a party of 7 and all ordered our own dish  everything was pretty whatever. My friends split a pizza and said it tasted like a pizza hut pizza and that it was super dry. The avocado egg rolls were bomb though and so was the appetizer platter but I felt it was a little too pricey for what it was  some mozzarella sticks  egg rolls  chips & dip and youre tryna charge me $17? bruh. But anyways  I ordered the cajun pasta which had a really good flavor to it. My only real complaint would be that a lot of the noodles were stuck together as if it'd been sitting for awhile or maybe not cooked properly? I also had a few of my friends' fries that came with his burger and they were soggy. The servers were very attentive though and came by pretty often to refill our waters and drinks. At the end after we gave the bill back to them  we told them to keep the change but they brought it back anyways? lol. The service was kinda all over the place today  everything was either hit or miss I guess. Probably won't be back just because the food is meh for how expensive it is  but I guess they do give pretty good portion sizes.
Megan M.,Tustin  CA,51,4,,2/4/2017,1.0,So disappointed with the service. Came in and was told they just needed to clean a booth for us  no problem. Waited about ten minutes was taken to a dirty booth  was told they would clean it  waited another 10 min watching the bussers talk at the booth they were supposed to be cleaning  while other people were being seated  I was already pissed. Sat and waited and waited  finally a server noticed we were not being waited on she came and apologized and ordered drinks  but we waited about another ten minutes just for drinks. Asked to speak to manager and she wasn't really interested  like I was bothering her. I am a restaurant manager/server for 14 years now and I would be ashamed at my wait staff  food was alright  we only come to bjs for the amazing tomatoe soup  but will definitely not be coming back here  SECRET SHOPPERS ARE NEEDED FOR THIS RESTAURANT  find out what's going on with management because they are dropping the ball
Nina B.,Newport Beach  CA,111,16,,7/9/2015,3.0,The pizza is not as good as it looks  even the BJ's Favorite. The atmosphere is definitely family oriented  at least in late-afternoon. The service was okay  but no better. Floors were sticky and table was sticky. I might try it again to check out the burgers  but if I go back  my expectations will definitely be lower.
Melissa C.,Long Beach  CA,13,114,178,12/21/2014,2.0,"1st... a positive - it\'s pretty cool they have happy hour during NFL games. The California Club flatbread was $4 & tasted just like a club sandwich. Perfect size for snacking. For $12 we got 2 Titos vodka drinks & the flatbread. But it\'s really  really weird that they have a full bar & can\'t make a Moscow Mule. It\'s a very popular drink right now. I would totally understand not having copper mugs & serving it in a rocks glass. But to actually say  ""Sorry we don\'t make those"" is really just weird. So we settled on Vodka sodas - sadly the soda was flat. No wonder this place didn\'t make it in Belmont Shore (Long Beach). It has a very corporate  chain restaurant vibe which it so...well executed on the corporate  chain  blah vibe. The service in the bar  we were at a table  was mediocre. The server made zero conversation with us & barely cracked a smile when we joked with her."
Stacy F.,Orlando  FL,1285,1429,6896,9/12/2014,4.0,We had a great experience at this BJ's and having just moved to the area  we are happy to know that this location is now close to our new home. We headed in because it's a chain place that we both enjoy and feel comfortable eating at pretty much anywhere we go. We were on a time crunch and picking something we knew was the best option for the night.There was a bit of a wait - 15 minutes  but we were seated in about 10. We let the waitress know that we were in a bit of a time crunch and she was extremely accommodating of it. She took our order right away and had the food out quickly. She even got us our bill right after she confirmed that our food was to our liking. We had a great patio seat with lots of fans over head for the little bit of heat that was still sticking to the day before the sun completely set. The place was busy  but everyone was on their game and seemed to be handling the rush with ease and experience. My honey chicken salad was amazingly fresh and delicious. Their homemade root beer is delish. Wish we had time to get a Pzookie  but it wasn't to be. Next go-round.Overall: AGreat staff. Sit on the patio. Order a root beer.
Judy G.,Chino Hills  CA,7,3,,7/31/2016,1.0,If I could give zero stars I would. I went in on 7/30/16 early evening around 4:00 pm. It was the worst service I've ever experienced in a restaurant. I was placed on hold for fifteen minutes  when I entered the establishment  there were three employees standing in the takeout area conversing instead of attending to guests. The management actions were deplorable and the environment is not inviting or professional at all. They were not busy  yet the staff acted as if they could care less about returning guests. No warm smiles  please come again or simply have a nice day  do yourself a favor  go to Lazy Dog  where they know customer service. I wish I had read the reviews of this establishment  the census is not favorable.
Steven N.,Orange  CA,40,79,137,10/16/2015,4.0,Woah! Everything was almost on point tonight! My friends and I came in and waited for about 20 minutes to be seated. When we sat down  our table was clean right away. Great! Both of my friends ordered a vegetarian pizza and I got an entree of Cajun pasta. The servers are very nice. They all smiled  asked if we're okay  and answered our questions nicely. It's not my first time trying BJ's and my friends really loved their's. The only problems we had was that our food took so long including our check too. The waitress forgot to print us a new check since we asked her to split it in 2. But that's not much of a big deal. We also got a $10 off deal for spending at least $35 on our food. Anyways  we will come back again soon if we're in the mood for some Italian food!
Peter H.,Torrance  CA,380,131,301,11/30/2014,3.0,Been going here for years with friends  family  clubs  and organizations. The staff is friendly and the food is decent. I highly reco mend their deep dish pizza if you are looking for something filling and delicious at the same time Oh and to add to their food  they supposedly make this root beer in house so it is really delicious when tey add ice cream to it for a root beer float!!
Vero G.,Thornton  CO,0,54,1,10/11/2015,1.0,Just left the restaurant and I was very disappointed. The food was good as always but the service.....HORRIBLE. We walked in around 10pm and no one greeted us nor came to seat us. There were 2 girls at the togo counter one was on the phone. Finally the young lady comes gets the menu and ask for 2? No greeting Hi How are you....nothing. We sit down restaurant is pretty empty everyone's at the bar. We waited about 4 minutes to finally meet our server. The whole thing was a disaster. Manager was gossiping alot with servers at one point my server was laughing away with her manager instead of getting me refill. I understand restaurants get busy and things take a while  but it wasn't busy it was pretty empty in there. Our server didn't deliver any of our food to us. Thank you to the kitchen staff for bringing out our food. And to top it off as we are eating a gentleman took our cheese and pepper to refill it. I don't understand why that couldn't wait. Very disappointed in the service!
ritu p.,Newport Beach  CA,1,2,,2/3/2017,1.0,The service just sucks....first time here it's been 20 minutes and we still don't have our food. Disappointing experience.
Jason F.,Anaheim  CA,3,10,54,9/26/2015,4.0,Came here for a drink. Bartender James made me an awesome Bloody Mary... Morrissey playing on the tunes.. not a bad way to wake up on a Saturday.
Krystal N.,Irvine  CA,92,571,5,11/13/2015,3.0,A-OK! I came here for a birthday dinner and had an enjoyable experience. I got the kale and roasted brussels sprout salad which was actually really good! Service was good too. All the food and drinks came out seamlessly and she pretty much knew how to split the checks by section without asking. BJs is generally a crowd-pleaser for large groups and this one is no different.
Marylin P.,Irvine  CA,0,35,17,8/13/2014,4.0,I have been coming here for years. I always see new faces working here. A lot has changed. I think the customer service has improved a lot. I recall when this place use to have mainly good looking servers with poor attitude. Today this place is great. My friend is a regular here and she always requests Brandi. She's a great server!
Andrew C.,Irvine  CA,285,2,2,5/23/2014,1.0,"I came here to watch the Super Bowl with a group of friends and the cheeseburger I ordered gave me food poisoning. That aspect of my experience can be forgiven. What makes me give this place one star is my experience with Howard  the general manager. Howard is a complete jerk. I came in today to complain about my food poisoning  and was referred to Erin. Erin was very considerate and professional. He brought back his general manager however  who basically accused me of lying. I told Howard that I had gotten sick the night of the super bowl  and that the next day I called in to complain. I told him that they referred me to human resources who told me they were going to send me a gift card for compensation. Upon waiting a few weeks and receiving nothing in the mail  I called back only to have an employee tell me they were going to personally send me a gift card. Again  i waited a few weeks and received nothing. I happened to be in the area today  and decided to complain in person. Upon telling Howard my story  he questioned me as to the names of the HR person and the employee I talked to. Considering that this happened a while ago I couldn\'t remember. He then proceeded to say that my story ""didn\'t sound legitimate"". He asked me how much i wanted on the gift card in a manner that suggested I was being unreasonable. I told him ""however much"". He replied by saying ""since the burger you ordered is only $10 I think that\'s how much you should be compensated""I chose not to call him out on his attitude considering I was with my little sister  but was very tempted to go off on him. not only was he unapologetic towards the fact that I had food poisoning and was forced to miss class for a week  but he was trying to make it seem like I was making stuff up just to get a gift card. He turned to Erin and said ""whatever just put $10 on the card and give it to him"". He then proceeded to walk away from me as if I had just wasted his time. I want to make a point in this review that Erin displayed an exceptional attitude. Upon giving me the gift card  he made sure to thank me for my time and told me to have a good day. He was very polite and attentive. It is beyond me how that douchebag of a general manager got hired to run this place. He is incompetent when it comes to customer service. $10 in no way makes up for the experience of getting food poisoned  being stuck in bed  and being forced to miss important class time. I will be sure to take my business elsewhere in the future to watch sporting events with my friends."
Thomas A.,Santa Ana  CA,0,27,5,7/26/2016,1.0,Not very good service at all. Took over 35 minutes for the waitress to come over and even take order.After that the food reminded me of something that Pizza Hut will be making. I had a steak that was terrible and about the size of the fork. It's most unfortunate but they concentrating on making beer. The service and the food go down the drain. Once iconic Southern California favorite slowly going away. There are far better choices around in California. Too bad it is like the good old days when I was just one little pizza joint in Santa Ana.
Big Y.,Irvine  CA,0,7,,8/11/2016,2.0,One of the most mediocre meals I've had in a long time. Did BJs used to be good or did I just not know any better? Basically microwave dinner status.
Lauren R.,Santa Ana  CA,22,52,37,4/23/2016,4.0,I'm always pleasantly surprised when I dine at BJs. Everything I've ordered off their extensive menu has been delicious. They have a great wine selection at reasonable prices. A good place for date night as well as the family. Great selection  atmosphere and superb customer service!
Charles R.,Irvine  CA,149,167,271,12/29/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,"Sort of disappointed tonight with my meal. I usually love the Jumbalaya. But they first delivered it with bell peppers that I specifically asked to not have (I get violently sick from them). Then it was served with the chicken and andouille sausage overcooked.Brandon gave us very good service! He did tell us that the manager had ""taken care of"" my meal  which in fact he didn\'t. It was subtracted from my bill only after having been entered twice."
Clara C.,Irvine  CA,1977,769,2646,5/14/2015,4.0,I always thought BJ's had good food  but what stops me from frequenting here is the wait time. It takes a good 5-10 minutes for a waiter to take your drink order  then another 15-20 minutes for your food to come out. If it's a busy night  you may have to wait a while just to be seated. At this location at the Tustin/Irvine Marketplace  it gets busy quickly. I love that BJ's has a huge menu: appetizers  entrees  salads/soups  desserts. On top of that  their drink selection is pretty impressive. Sometimes it doesn't help if you are indecisive..everything on the menu will start to sound awesome and you order too much food! My favorite appetizer is the stuffed mushroom  although they added more items on their appetizer menu like the flatbread and carnitas fries. My favorite entrees here include burgers and pizza. I love their deep-dish pizza - so many great choices like Great White  Sweet Pig  and BBQ Chicken. My fave salads include Thai Chicken Mango and Santa Fe (I love avocado!). For dessert  you cannot go wrong with the famous pizookie. Their newest on the menu is the smores peanut butter. (Note: you cannot get this one in a mini/birthday size) I tried red velvet  triple chocolate  and salted caramel  and I still prefer cookies and cream. The previous three are VERY sweet.HAPPY HOUR: Mon-Fri 3p-7p and Sun-Thur 10p-close. (Yes  they close late: midnight!) Their happy hour doesn't really work for me  but $5 martinis! For this location's happy hour menu  see their website here: bjsrestaurants.com/sitesThe reason they get four stars is I received excellent customer service from Craig. He was great with checking on our drinks and making sure we had everything we needed. That particular visit I had an email coupon  and he had already applied it when he brought the check. This really impressed me because most times the waiter makes me wait another 20 minutes to correct the bill with their manager (sometimes it still comes out wrong)  especially on my trips to BJ's.Tip: join the BJ's premier rewards program! I get free food :) Here is the link to their website bjspremierrewards.com
Nermeen A.,Irvine  CA,0,2,,2/5/2017,1.0,I wish don't put any stars the restroom is very very dirty and not clean at all I feel I throw up and the smell is very very bad
Richard J.,South El Monte  CA,0,18,6,1/18/2016,3.0,There are a few things that come to mind when thinking of a great place to dine.. One is obviously the food  this place has it. Variety  mid-range meals  bargain meals and beer! The other things are ambience/environment which it has a bit of as well. The last thing is customer service/experience. That is where this location falls short. I've been a customer of several BJ's restaurant and this one for quite some time since I work nearby. The wait staff is usually chipper but I always seem to get stuck with someone who isn't very nice. I have a high tolerance for issue and not complaining because I'm considerate to things that may be out of their control but bad service is just that.. bad service. My recent experience there was on a Monday night for the College Football Championship. I arrived shortly after 5pm and grabbed an open booth at the bar  good enough to see multiple TVs and enough privacy for personal conversation. Our waitress was a very good looking gal who seemed like she was in a rush when greeting me at the table. I had obviously just sat down and without hesitation she asked me if I knew what I wanted to order. I get that she may have asked for my drink order but I felt it odd that she asked if I wanted to order food without giving me a second to look at the menu. I know I've been here multiple times but it was how she said it. I then began to feel like she was rushing me because she knew that I was going to watch the game and most likely  she didn't feel that I would be ordering throughout the game  which I did do. I was waiting for a friend so I was very patient when ordering my food/drinks in anticipation that my guest would be a few minutes behind. Nonetheless  I ordered some wings  a personal pizza and a beer. As my guest arrived he asked for menu and he simply did not get one. After we both finished our drinks  she comes back and asks if he was ready to order. similar to my experience  he felt rushed because she had not even left the menu the first time nor did she bring my water that I asked for several times. All that to say  during the start of the 4th quarter of the game I was about to order a final beer when the waitress came over and said that she would be leaving for the day and before she was going to introduce us to our new waiter  she wanted to close out the tab/check.  Not knowing what to say  we agreed to close it out. I know this was done because she wanted to cash out on the tip which she did deserve but that was definitely awkward and unprofessional in my opinion. I ended up making a mistake about the tip and I over tipped because it was a split bill. Just a disaster of an experience. I'm sure that doesn't speak for the entire staff however  this isn't the first time I've been to this location and the service wasn't great. BJ's I still love your chicken wings  don't hate me for my feedback ;-)
Jessica V.,Tustin  CA,143,78,8,5/27/2016,2.0,Nice ambience and great service from the servers. The hostesses are not interactive nor helpful  and are pretty stand off-ish. I've worked in the restaurant industry before and I have to say  this is by far one of the worst customer service. Purely the hostesses that are working (5/27) aside from the sweet Asian one that sat us. I live right by here and gave this place a shot because it's my sister's birthday and she really wanted to come. But probably won't be coming again.
Jack C.,Anaheim  CA,15,38,7,5/19/2015,2.0,Summary: Wrong orders everywhere during none busy hours. Not coming here again. Go to TGIF instead.Explanation:We were seated quickly and served our drinks. Our waitress got orders wrong.Friend 1: Asked for skinny fries with his burger. He recieved Potato Wedges.Friend 2: Asked for Medium Burger and a side or ranch. No side ranch. Burger overcooked.Friend 3: Asked for a bowl of tortilla soup. Asked another waiter who brought Clam Chowder. Told the waiter the correct soup. Brought it out after everyone finished.Friend 4: Ordered Totonka Stout. Never recieved it. Waitress didnt even put it on the receipt.This is honestly bad service on the waiters and waitresses side. The food was good though which merits the 2 stars but I'll pass this location.
Bahman P.,Tustin  CA,0,11,5,7/13/2016,3.0,We eat out all the time   been to this BJ's location many times and last night the service was so bad that I decided to finally write a review.  Receptionist are not polite and somewhat rude.We were served by a young lady name Tierra. Simply putting it she was rude  cold   arrogant  unfriendly   don't care !!! I always leave 20% minimum gratuity when eating out .my wife who is always lay back and cool about everything said to leave her $0 . I still feel bad and left %10 on a $90 bill !!
Sharon B.,Duarte  CA,118,11,240,1/29/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Needless to say we took them up in their offer! My daughter and I had an awesome lunch here today. BJ's management and their staff really do care about their customers' satisfaction. So we will continue to be regulars here!
Samuel B.,Irvine  CA,14,35,162,7/8/2015,5.0,Love it. Beer. Pizza. Pasta. Pizookies! Pi-friggin-zookies!!! Genius idea. Atmosphere is also lively and I dig the coverage of sporting events on the tvs  especially when it's 3 at once!!! So cool. I would have to say I wish it could be a tiny bit cheaper  but I can't be too picky. If you love pizza  get any of their pizzas. They are thick and fluffy and packed with flavor. Make sure to make a reservation though! The place can get packed  especially at night!
Carolina N.,Irvine  CA,0,5,,6/17/2016,1.0,This BJ's location has really proven to be a huge disappointment once and for all. This is the second time in two weeks we have attempted to have dinner here but the wait time has been over an hour and twenty minutes long. The first time we understood but didn't want to wait as it was late and we were hungry. Today  however  we decided to give it a second try but it was the same story. We couldn't even be seated at the bar. Very unacceptable. I'd give more stars for the food but we never managed to stay long enough. We will no longer be visiting or recommending this location anymore.
Cindy L.,Los Angeles  CA,401,663,2002,2/11/2013,4.0,"This review is for their happy hour! I get off work late and I\'m always hungry ... so I always ask ""what\'s there to eat late at night around irvine?!"" I decided to give BJ\'s a try!Happy hr: Mon-Fri 3-7pm & Sun-Thurs 10pm-closeI ordered the Spinach & Artichoke dip. It was a happy hour portion so it wasn\'t too big but the ooey gooey of the warm cheese with spinach and artichoke was off the wall served with the colored tortilla chips. Also got deep dish mini pizza and tried the Chicken Bacon Ranch (it\'s a new one) and I was anticipating a creamy ranch sauce but instead it was a little dry and very bread-y. But then again it was deep dish so what do I expect ... $6 for a mini pizza. Not that worth it in my opinion but originally it\'s 10.95 so it\'s a good deal. Service was excellent. Server was really good about getting our drinks  order  and bill in a timely manner. I also really like the lighting of the place. Way more lit than Yardhouse & TGI Fridays during their happy hours."
Devin C.,Orange  CA,164,1,,4/16/2016,5.0,Wow such great service. Today at BJ's My server was Jordan. After having him as a server before  I knew this visit was going to lift my spirits up. Such a great guy. He took our order with enthusiasm and made us laugh. Looking at him work making guests laugh makes me wonder where all the other good servers are. Will be going back  not only for the hot wings  but for the hot service too! Way to go Jordan! Thanks for making this visit memorable.
Ashley Z.,Huntington Beach  CA,138,208,124,10/1/2015,5.0,Yum!!!! I hadnt been to BJ's in years! My friend called and invited me  and I'm so glad she did!! My lunch was absolutely delicious!!! I ordered the 1/2 sandwich and salad lunch combo. I chose the pesto chicken sandwich and the caprese (tomato/mozzarella) salad  with crispy french fries. The salad came out first and was to die for. It was soooo so good!! I could eat it everyday for the rest of my life and be a happy girl!! The sandwich and fries were also delicious!  Our server was AWESOME (I feel bad that I didn't get his name  because honestly  he was one of the best servers I've had in a LONG time)To top it off...it was FREE pizookie day!!!! 1/2 peanut butter for me 1/2 chocolate chip for my friend....heaven!
Anthony T.,Santa Ana  CA,0,2,2,4/3/2016,1.0,Unorganized  my name was called to be seated but made us wait 15 min more to be seated   meal was no worth the wait
Cal7amg ..,Birmingham  AL,0,3,,6/24/2016,4.0,Great IPA  great food  chill atmosphere  I loved it here. Eric was a great server!! Give it a try  I will be back again in the future!!
Sundos S.,Santa Ana  CA,77,18,27,3/16/2014,4.0,We love this place. Consistently great tasting food  always buzzing with a laid back vibe.We usually head towards the bar area for self seating and no wait. Same menu & sometime better service! I've tried a variety of things here ranging from veggie jalapeo burgers to yummy happy hour finger food. The winner of my BJ heart definitely goes to their Jambalaya plate. They are totally open to substitutions  since I don't eat meat they always don't mind giving me all shrimp rather than their trio of meat/shrimp. It's spices  balance of veggies/protein/carbs  and filling deliciousness is perfection.This time though  we decided to switch up our order and got the avocado egg rolls & stuffed mushroom appetizers along with a medium half buffalo chicken half vegetarian deep dish pizza. Wayyyy too much food for two people  definitely could have gone with the small pizza! The avocado rolls were delicious  light and flavorful. Perfect appetizer  love the taste of the slightly warmed avocado in just the right amount of crispy.Sometimes  some food just makes you moan close your eyes and thank the heavens for good food. Those were the stuffed mushrooms for you. Little and delectable  the appetizer portion comes as six lil scrumptious mushrooms. Comes with a slice of lemon  we asked for more  squeeze em on for the most epic finishing touch to these guys.The pizza was good  the crust was phenomenal and so soft it was heaven in ma mouth. My vegetarian half came with roasted tomatoes  bell peppers  olives  and artichoke hearts (which I substituted for the onions). Good flavors  fresh ingredients  but for some reason I wasn't impressed. Good  but probably wouldn't order again.Overall great place to have a nice meal or have drinks and watch the game-we've never gone wrong here. It'll always have a place in our hearts  and our bellies!
Bill S.,Irvine  CA,269,23,,7/20/2016,2.0,This review is on takeout. Ordered Alfredo pasta with chicken and broccoli. Requested extra broccoli and chicken on the side. Should have checked my meals before I left. No extra broccoli and chicken in the pasta. Not too happy about the situation. But I will take the blame since I did not check the order myself before I left. Just disappointed
Lidia W.,Irvine  CA,1,5,,7/8/2016,3.0,I really only came for the pazookie. They have so many cookies its hard to decide. I ordered the hickory brisket and bacon burger. It has smoked brisket  applewood smoked bacon  Cheddar and Jack cheese  red onions  bbq sauce and mayo. It was really filling. The only reason I am giving 3 stars is because my burger wasn't cooked how I ordered. I wanted medium and it came to me well done. Absolutely NO pink. Why ask how I want burger cooked if it won't be like that? Other than  I enjoyed my time there.
Dawn M.,Costa Mesa  CA,341,108,20,8/20/2015,3.0,The food is typical delicious BJs  but I made the mistake of ordering curbside. 100% pointless. I thought it was going to be quick as I was late to a meeting  and it took foreverrrr. Sat in my car running the air for 20 minutes. Might as well have gone in  sat down and ordered a drink! Not doing that again...
Camila G.,Jamul  CA,15,27,4,6/2/2016,4.0,I absolutely loved the meat pizza I got  as well as the pizookie. I think BJ's may be my favorite chain restaurant. On the flip slide  I came here at around 7 pm  so it was packed  and we had to wait quite a while (probably half an hour) at the bar before we could be seated at a regular dining table. Overall  service is decent  waiters are nice  wait is bad  but I loved the food.
T G.,Huntington Beach  CA,5,135,143,4/16/2016,3.0,I'm not going going to lie  the balsamic chicken on babay greens was mad good! The chicken was cooked to perfection! I thought it would come out dry on the outside or inedible on some parts but it was juicy and I ate every bite! What was a disappointment were the drinks. Neither of our drinks came out good. Our server was super sweet and amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting outside with the hockey game on one TV and the baseball game on the next one. Although our drink experience was less than stellar this visit  it's BJs so no doubt we'll be back.
Audrey H.,Irvine  CA,10,7,7,4/1/2016,5.0,My review is for the customer service the manager Caitlyn and server Miriam provided. (See my Taps review from next door.) Caitlyn accommodated our requests without hesitation. She knows what it means to be customer service oriented. Miriam agreed that the customer should be put first. The food rocked too! Thank you BJ's!! WE WILL be back!!
Kirsten H.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,33,23,,9/26/2015,2.0,Went here last night with my husband and it was fairly good to start  our service was decent. However half way through our server said she was going on break and so and so was taking over and she took off. At the time she went on break I was in need of a refill and she didn't notice and walked away so fast I couldn't ask for one. Then the breaker never came by to check on us til she decided we were ready because she brought the check. I felt very rushed and was irritated I had to eat my dinner without a beverage. To top it off  both my husband and I ended up sick in the middle of the night.
John M.,Tustin  CA,1,7,,3/23/2015,5.0,Love this location. All of the bar staff is amazing and the menu always has something to hit the spot!The beer selection is top-quality as well and I frequent here after work because I love the atmosphere.
Phil S.,Placentia  CA,2,24,,5/30/2016,2.0,Not too good. Might have been different if we had pizza possiblyApps- calamari was burned and chips and guacamole were average. Entrees - mahi mahi tacos ok. Bbq chicken salad tasted like it was out of a bag. Chicken entree was also ok. Pizookie is what you should come here for and that's about it.
George G.,Beverly Hills  CA,0,71,1,12/10/2016,2.0,God forbid they refill your drinks or bring the apps before the main course. Why is this location always sooooo bad and why doesn't corporate do something about the service here already? One thing consistent is the lack of good service at this location. They smile as they screw everything up.

Clare S.,Irvine  CA,625,70,116,2/16/2015,4.0,"BJs is a pretty solid restaurant - impeccably clean  good quality food  decent service  and a great ambience. Only grip is that the service is kind of slow  and the wait can be long. I used to always get the Steak Salad  but I\'m sad to say that I don\'t think they have this anymore. So the last time I was here  I tried something new - the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon (see picture) over a bed of fluffy Israeli couscous  spinach and asparagus. I found this under the Enlightened section of the menu  so I expected something small and light since it was boasting a low calorie count. I was pleasantly surprised at how large the portion was. I could barely finish it! And I was delighted to find the dish to be VERY delicious and flavorful. I was ""mmm""ing at every bite  and baffled at how this could only be only 590 calories. Seasons 52 better watch out! I liked this salmon A WHOLE lot more than Seasons 52\'s low-calorie salmon dish (and needless to say  Season\'s 52 is also a lot more expensive  and the portion is smaller). I think I\'ve found my go-to  guilt-free dish here... Also  I usually get beer  but this time I decided to try the Sparkling Raspberry Lemonade Mocktail (see pic). This was a tad too sweet  but still good. $3.50 felt especially worth it because of the unlimited refills. Next time I\'ll probably get another Mocktail instead of beer. All in all  4 stars. I won\'t be frequenting place TOO often cause it\'s a bit expensive for my taste (I can buy two meals elsewhere for the price of one here)  but I\'ll definitely be back with friends in the next couple of months."
Joe D.,Tustin  CA,0,19,5,12/3/2016,5.0,BJ's is a family favorite. Tonite we took our daughter and grandkids for dinner. Everything was excellent from our server Brandon to our dinner and finally to our Pazookies. We had sliders  pizza  grilled cheese sandwich and an excellent Cobb salad. Brandon gave us the best service we have had in years! He was on top of every need before we even asked. Great job Brandon! Many thanks!
Samantha M.,Corona  CA,3,138,32,3/12/2016,1.0,Nasty  dirty   no refills   waitress never came back she could care less we found dirty things my moms food was disgusting please save your money won't be coming here again
Nichelle W.,Irvine  CA,57,10,,3/23/2016,2.0,I am a Bj's regular. I came to this location near my house after a night with family  we came to just grab a quick dessert  it was very packed for a Wednesday because of a nearby function going on. There was no one at the reception desk for about 5 minutes  and both servers that We did find were very rude and short with us  Haley R  and another server. I'll leave it to maybe it was a bad day for them but really not even a smile? It was overall horrible customer service.
Julie T.,Dana Point  CA,0,10,,11/28/2016,4.0,Service at this BJs is great. Waiters and waitresses are very friendly. Food came quickly  and the pizookiis are the best!
Ash R.,Santa Ana  CA,1,8,1,11/28/2016,5.0,THEIR PAZOOKIES ARE DANK AS HELL!!!! 10 OUT OF 10 I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! Potato wedges are gr8 as well. Waitresses usually have some sass to them but that's okay  I'm into it. Overall  great eatery  I would def go again
Randoll C.,Los Angeles  CA,624,1410,5810,5/16/2012,3.0,BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is OK.I wouldn't consider it comfort food however  it's definitely consistent; you know what to expect and you know what you're getting. So  yesterday  when friends suggested meeting up here for dinner  there was no argument from me. Lots of parking as it's in the Marketplace of Jamboree but know that there's a handful of restaurants nearby so though there's parking  you might have to walk a bit. Service was pretty good last night. Our server (forget her name) was pretty attentive even with our party (6) being seated out on the patio. She was on the spot with refills with our adult beverages as well as not argumentative when we let her know that the appetizer plates were all dirty. Food was OK. We all split a pizza  Jambalaya and some fish dish. Again  the food is OK. it's not great though it's definitely not fast food. This is a chain so like I mentioned  you know what to expect.The selection of beer seems to be growing from what I remember. As a fan of craft beer  I appreciate how there wasn't ads for the inexpensive  domestic beer that you can pick up anywhere. If I were just reviewing the brewhouse  my rating would be one star more  but for the most part  and in general  BJ's is OK in my book. Not my first  second or third choice of places to go - but I won't argue too hard if others want to meet up there.
Ben C.,Clovis  CA,4,14,7,2/11/2015,1.0,Shocking meal there tonight. Ordered a rib-eye steak medium rare with cheddar mash and sprouts. 30 minutes later  out came a rare rib-eye steak  sprouts that looked like they were cooked yesterday  mash that was flavorless and worse yet  all of the meal was cold. Sent it back to be told they would redo it straight away. After 20 minutes of waiting I cancelled the order as everyone else had finished and just asked for the bill. A further 10 minutes later that arrived!Terrible service  none of the party I was with enjoyed their meals either with similar complaints of lukewarm food.Hang your heads in shame BJ's - you ruined what should have been a great culinary night out. Won't be back.
Nikki D.,Huntington Beach  CA,3,13,1,5/27/2016,5.0,Had dinner with the family today. They said 30 to 45 minutes wait but we got seated in 15 min. We ordered a little too much. We ordered pizza  traditional wings  chicken tortilla soup (btw.. This soup is really good) spaghetti with meatballs  ravioli  watermelon salad. The portion are big too. We can't finished it but they were all very good. Bjs improved the food choices a lot. The marinara sauce is so much tastier now. I like our server. She was really nice. She checked up on us at least more than 3 times. And the brew rootbeer is very good.
Ahmed I.,Irvine  CA,0,8,2,12/11/2016,5.0,One of the best places to dine in. Actually  I tried the pizza  soups  salads and burgers they are all awesome. With respect to desserts  they have their famous pizzokie  if you are a chocolate lover try the chocolate one!!!
Srujan N.,Irvine  CA,0,5,3,12/9/2016,5.0,This was my first time at a BJ's restaurant and had a great experience. Service was good and their jalapeno burgers were yummy.
Ami T.,CA  CA,7,36,37,5/18/2016,4.0,I like that they are opened late. Food is good for the bar (nothing really special). Whenever everything else is closed  it is a perfect place for a light dinner  you can always get a salad or soup and they are not bad at all.
Margaret J.,Riverside County  CA,1,12,1,10/21/2014,3.0,Came here Saturday night around 11 to get something quick to eat so we ordered some appetizers. Got the stuffed mushrooms  carnitas fries  and the Mac n cheese. Everything was great except for the Mac n cheese. In fact it wasn't even cheesy...First time we got it we took bites from it and there was absolutely no cheese on it...like literally none. We told our server and he apologized  he was very polite and helpful. He brought us a new one and it was the same thing. Quite disappointed b/c I've had it before and know what it's supposed to taste like and this time both were just baked noodles in oil. Check out my pic to see it for yourself. 3 stars bc service was good
Jessica R.,Boulder  CO,110,239,32,2/9/2014,3.0,"If you\'re in the mood for stuffing your face with pizza and beer  BJ\'s is always a good choice. A friend and I had just done the Tap\'n\'Run in Santiago and decided that after running and drinking beer  we definitely needed some eating and drinking beer.I\'d been here once before for happy hour  but that was on a weeknight and I couldn\'t remember if they did weekend HH. When we walked in (still dressed in our silly outfits from the run)  the hostess looked at us and said ""two?"" and I answered ""Actually we were going to grab a seat at the bar if it\'s happy hour - is happy hour happening right now?"" to which she wandered away to ask someone else a question  then came back  picked up our menus and said ""No."" I followed up with ""Oh  ok  we weren\'t sure if you did Saturday happy hour."" Her response was ""we do  but it\'s not going on right now."" Uhhh  for one  it was 4 pm  so I would think if you were doing HH it\'d be happening. Two  you aren\'t helpful if you don\'t tell me what time it happens so I can know for next time. Whatever. She just had that tone that made us not want to talk to her any more than absolutely necessary  so we let it go.Other than the less than stellar interaction with the hostess  everything was just fine - same as you would get at any other BJ\'s. Friendly service from our waiter  pizza came out as we ordered it and the beer is always good for a chain.If you can avoid interacting with the hostess (maybe just walk in and beeline right to the bar?) and you need a fat-kid beer and pizza fix  this might be the spot for you."
Jim G.,Covina  CA,154,439,2,6/2/2014,4.0,OK  4 Star for what it is. BJ's is what BJ's is. You go there like so many other chains because you know exactly what you are going to get.Food is extremely consistent and you are going to get a quality dish  ample portions and usually pretty solid service.So if BJ's is what you are looking for  this one will not disappoint.
Katie L.,Irvine  CA,5,37,26,1/17/2015,1.0,Man this place sucks!!! Food was mediocre at best  one of our entres came out 15 minutes after we got all of our food... And they never even offered a discount or comp anything on the receipt after their error. The deep dish pizza we ordered was horrible. I swear there wasn't any pizza sauce on that 'pizza' or maybe it got evaporated from over cooking it and bringing it to me burnt. Really? You see a burnt pizza and think 'I bet they will love this'.?!?? You would think this place would be good for kids... But it is not. The waitstaff gave us dirty looks as they passed by our table and saw our toddler throwing it's nasty mac & cheese (that we bought for six dollars) all over the floor! I don't blame him for throwing the food... I wanted to do the same with mine!I guess it boils down to this... There are so many options around this location to choose from... If you want your restaurant to succeed  you need good customer service  and the two times I've been there  the waitstaff is horrible and the food is inconsistent. Yelp ANY other restaurant nearby and choose that one!
Emily J.,Orange County  CA,186,427,1477,5/24/2015,4.0,Solid (food and service) every time we come here. I've tried most of the menu by now  and I don't think I've ever left disappointed (or hungry).
Lonnie T.,Carlsbad  San Diego  CA,0,19,1,12/15/2014,1.0,"Wow Where do I start. I should\'ve listened to everyone that told me that every time they came here they have had bad service and bad food. It took forever to get seated  there was soo much trash and cloth napkins underneath the table where we were sitting that my girlfriend almost twisted her ankle. I Ordered angel hair Classico pasta  when the food arrived it almost looked to be a child\'s portion. I brought this to our servers attention whom which was sporting what I can only describe to be a dog collar  classy lol  and she replied with ""oh  that\'s because it is a lighter serving"" and I replied ""no sh*t  but where is the rest of it?"" She said ""that\'s the way it comes sir  I\'m sorry"" and walked away. Also not once did a manager ever come around to our table  or anyone else\'s in that matter.I ate my 4 fork scoops of pasta  paid my bill and away I went. next time I\'ll go to Denny\'s"
George M.,Tustin  CA,84,22,4,5/3/2016,5.0,The prime rib special and 1/2 off wine brought us in. It was so perfectly done that I was very pleased. Our server Tom was always anticipating our needs and did not abandon us once. I was amazed at how hard he worked and it made our stay more relaxed.
Y a.,Tustin  CA,0,43,1,2/20/2016,2.0,I used the BOGO deal on this Saturday to order the roasted chicken and spinach quinoa bowl. On the menu  that entree shows one piece of juicy plump chicken and says this is lunch portion shown. I think I got ripped off because I got the lunch portion (one piece of thin and rubbery chicken) when I got charged dinner price (there is no lunch special on weekends). Very disappointing...
Angeli O.,Buena Park  CA,5,33,125,4/5/2016,4.0,I haven't been here for a while so I was excited to try it again. They changed the menu up  which is great since BJ's has been around for a while now. I got a side salad to start  I would recommend getting the dressing on the side. I didn't ask for it on the side and I had way too much dressing on this salad. I got the vegetarian penne for my entree (new item) and it was delicious  I think next time I will ask them to sprinkle a little cheese on top. I also got the monkey bread (new item) and it was amazing. I love the chocolate chip pizookie (classic) but the monkey bread was just as great! If you love cinnamon  I would highly recommend it. Our waiter was attentive and the food came out pretty quickly  not common for the prior times I had come to this location. I am hoping they implemented some changes and can keep the service at this level. I would come back to this location for sure  especially for the monkey bread.
A T.,Newport Beach  CA,36,42,139,2/23/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,So so bad. Wow couldn't even get the waitress to crack the pepper over my salad. Meanwhile i i type this into my phone a group of waitresses are giggling and really not working.. Sad . I come here all the time and it really is a hit or miss with the service  ... Actually the service here is terrible. I feel completely un attended for . While i wait for a long time to get some pepper. My entree arrives and i still have a full plate of salad. God . Nothing makes me more mad ... Sucks simply sucks
Anh D.,Orange  CA,197,18,9,3/22/2014,5.0,Honestly this review is mostly for our (my best friend and I) server. I honestly don't even remember her name (I'm so sorry!!!!:/) but she was half Japanese & she was so adorable and attentive and friendly and just a ball of greatness. I would come back just for her (unlike one of the rude food runners we had; he glared at us & was not polite at all).PS for those of you reading for an actual food review  I always get the cookies & cream pizookie  sooooo amazing!!!
Mary L.,Fullerton  CA,329,33,3,1/14/2015,1.0,Came here for dinner. Arrived at 6:50pm. Asked the front how long the wait will be for 2 people  she told us 25-30 minutes and that it won't be 30 minutes for outside patio. We said okay! The time was 7:30pm  we went up and asked how long is it going to take and that we waited over 30 minutes. She said another 15 minutes. After hearing that we have to wait another 15 minutes we left hungry and upset. If she would have given us the correct wait time I wouldn't have been too upset because I could have decided not to wait and just went elsewhere instead of waiting 45 plus minutes. But she gave us the wrong time and expectedly us to wait even more... Forget about! Never coming here again!
Lauren M.,Seal Beach  CA,12,19,6,12/30/2014,2.0,Came here for drinks and apps and it was a typical BJS experience. The food is ok as long it's served to you while it's still hot.Service always seems to be amateur. Our group had a round of beers. Obviously we weren't all ready for a second round at the same time. Finished my beer and was ready for another. Our waitress seemed to have a bit of an attitude when we only order apps. She pretty much vanished upon hearing we didn't want more food but I was patient waiting for her to return. When she did return she left our bill and took my glass  without offering a refill.Awesome  love a side of passive aggressiveness while out with friends.
Marc E.,Los Angeles  CA,2,16,1,1/30/2015,1.0,I'm not one to bad mouth  but I just think they need to do a little more training on etiquette. BJs has always been good food and great times. But whatever just happened is the complete opposite. It took a while to be seated but that's normal. After being seated and given our menus  it took about 20 minutes for someone to notice us. And even then  the other servers saw us and didn't talk to us once to let us know someone would be with us. No one even came to bring us waters! It wasn't until 22 minutes that we had to get up and tell the front that we hadn't been served. After waiting another 2 more minutes  we waited and still no server. Never ever have I had to walk out of a restaurant for not being helped. Please  don't let this happen to any other guest! It's not good for business.
Cat B.,Costa Mesa  CA,24,47,208,6/19/2014,4.0,We came here for Happy Hour a couple of days ago because the BF was craving pizza. The restaurant and bar was packed at around 6pm on a Tuesday. Our waitress Jennifer came to our table and asked for our order. I have to say the service was exceptional throughout our meal. Even though the place was really busy  she was attentive and refilled our drinks and was always checking up on us. We found the Manager after our meal and told him that we had a great experience because of Jennifer.The food:I ordered the new Angel Hair Classico pasta with blackened chicken. It came out a little salty but it was still great. We also ordered the BJ's Favorite and Great White mini for $6 each (HH pricing).The best part is that we had just signed up for their rewards program and received a free pizzookie. If you download the app  you can order and pay your bill with your phone! I think this is a great idea especially if you have a big group and like to pay separately. You can also put your name down for a table and order with your phone so the food is ready when you get there. I'm hoping other restaurants will start doing the same thing. Also they have BJ's 30 Under $10. 30 menu items under $10. I'm just bummed they took out the Tilapia from their enlightened menuWill definitely be back to this location
Alex T.,Irvine  CA,0,16,4,12/31/2015,3.0,"The reason why I\'m giving 3 stars is primarily related to poor service. They offer call ahead seating and told me it would be about 20-30 minutes. I arrived after 20 minutes and after being ignored by all 6 of the hostesses standing around talking I was told it would be 15-20 minutes more! After 30 more minutes waiting at the restaurant we were seated and was given sub par service by our server. She wasn\'t very friendly nor attentive. Towards the end of the meal she offered to refill my fiancs water  and when it didn\'t even fill halfway she said ""oh I thought I had more in there"" and never came back to fill it up! Lol I wouldn\'t go with too high of expectations."
Amanda C.,Orange  CA,0,3,1,10/31/2016,5.0,Just tried the curbside pick up for the first time and I was super impressed! Online order was very user friendly and simple  called when I arrived and it was brought out to my car within 2 minutes. Jay was very friendly and even double checked to make sure we got everything we needed - amazing customer service  Jay! We will definitely be ordering curbside again - so convenient and easy!
BettyLou H.,Irvine  CA,161,180,8,10/28/2014,4.0,I had a very unsatisfactory experience when I went to the BJ's in Huntington Beach  but we had a great visit at this BJ's. Definitely get the root beer. I had a great burger that was flavorful and delicious. My lunch buddy had a wrap. The only downside is that even though it wasn't overly busy  the sound travels and it was sometimes hard to hear. Overall a definite recommendation to hang out  watch TV  and enjoy some good grub.
Chris W.,Tustin  CA,0,4,,4/28/2016,5.0,Been going here for almost three years now.  Great food and beers. The dining staff is excellent.  Only complaint would be the to go staff acting indifferent at times.  Definitely recommend this place
M-K C.,Irvine  CA,0,73,61,6/21/2015,4.0,Tried brunch hereLiked the food. Delicious and lightLoved the tomato soup but clam chowder was too salty thoughService was good  friendly  attentive.Will come back for more especially on game night
Mel H.,Orange County  CA,281,409,2643,7/21/2012,2.0,"BEWARE of BJ\'s ""EnLIGHTened"" menu:!!!!!! (Just because its on the ""light"" doesn\'t mean it has to taste like crap. Blah. ) EnLIGHTened Thai Chicken Mango Salad: 2 stars! Chicken was terrible!! Blah. It felt like eating rubber or plastic. Well  at least the rest of the vegetables and the mango on the salad made up for it. I was ready to ask the waiter to take it back and substitute my meat for fish or something. But my cousin who was with me made a good point. She ordered a regular Sesame Chicken salad and the chicken there was fine. So she explained that it\'s not that they have bad chicken or can\'t cook it. It\'s either a different part of the meat or that it\'s steamed and not grilled like normal to avoid using any oils or fats. Because honestly this chicken was so tough that I could barely get my teeth through it!!!"
David C.,Rancho Santa Margarita  CA,69,40,54,8/5/2014,4.0,BJS has always been one of my favorite casual restaurants. They have good beer and good food.Today we went for something light. They seem to have a new under 750 calories menu  but we went with the Flatbread pepperoni extravaganza and the lettuce wraps! Both delicious  one quick tip on the lettuce wraps  make sure you just add a little bit of the spice mustard  if not your eyes will get watery very quickly!To end the perfect dinner at Bjs  their home made cookie with Ice cream (pizookies) is as a must have!
Ryan H.,Orange County  CA,108,17,6,7/6/2015,5.0,The wife and I live a few blocks away  and we come to BJ's on a fairly regular basis. It can get crowded at times  but that is to be expected from any great restaurant. Just grab a beeper at wait at the very large bar area. Time flies when you are having a great beer or cocktail!Service is always friendly  and food comes at a normal quickness. They have an expansive gluten-free menu as well.Their brews are exquisite and very fair-priced. Their Hopstorm IPA can rival most SoCal breweries. Not to mention  they also carry multiple guest beers on tap as well.Overall  I have never left BJ's unsatisfied. Would recomemmend to family  friends  and enemies alike.PS - I almost NEVER write reviews  especially at this length  but I felt the need to sing BJ's praises. Bring the family  meet a date  or swing by and catch a game on the many TVs. You will NOT be disappointed.
Matt H.,Orange  CA,215,749,215,2/23/2014,4.0,One of the few places (oh Numero Uno  where have you all gone?) doing deep dish style pizza  with all the greasy goodness of the crust. I usually head there when I am on my own for a meal  which I fine  as I sit at the bar and have a cocktail or two with my small pizza watching the giant TVs cycling through various sporting events.And if you want dessert  get the pizzookie. Don't ask  just... do it.
Naima A.,Irvine  CA,32,5,4,8/1/2014,4.0,I went with 3 other people later in the evening on a Friday. It was a bit packed but we were seating pretty quick. Atmosphere was chill not too noisy.vService was nice and quick. We came for dessert and ordered 3 Pizookis and were served shortly after.I got the double chocolate and it was good and pretty heavyyyy. Do not have this after a meal you won't finish it.
Lisa F.,Yorba Linda  CA,324,145,47,11/18/2014,1.0,This is in regards to the take-out service.  MY company orders lunch for the office several times a month. We decided we should try BJ's out and informed them over the phone that we had 20 orders to place. When we picked up our order and got back to the office  we noticed 6 ENTIRE employee meals were missing as well as a few appetizers.We called them back and they did not seem to care  but we went to go pick them up since we were charged for them.  When we got there  no apologies were made and they ended up forgetting three coleslaw's that were supposed to come as a side with the three BBQ platters  an order of Fritos Nachos  the french fries that come with the burger  an order of avocado eggrolls  and a mini pizza was STILL missing. Apparently they don't double/triple check their to-go orders and don't seem to care about customer service and keeping their customers happy.Since we order group lunches often  we KNOW for CERTAIN we won't be calling BJ's.
Allyson S.,Costa Mesa  CA,197,3,1,9/13/2016,1.0,My sister and I have been coming to eat here a few times a month for a couple of years now and have experienced this problem twice now  so I felt it was time to say something. We sat in the bar area because we were going to order off of the happy hour menu. After sitting for 5-10 minutes without any service  our server  Bonnie  finally came up to the table and very coldly asked us for our order with no smile or anything. She rarely came back to the table and each time she did  my sister and I were shocked at how rude she was. Not sure if we will be dining here again  but if you come in to eat  steer clear of Bonnie!
Cassidy J.,Orange  CA,161,327,573,4/8/2015,3.0,BJ's is pretty good! I was very impressed with the customer service that our large party received eating there. We had a few different types of pizza.. the buffalo chicken and the BJs favorite.. And I will be totally honest.. it was good.. but for the price it wasn't amazing. I would have expected a bit more. Now  I am sure there are some really great things here on the menu.. which is large.. but expensive. I am not convinced that BJs is worth the price. The pizookies.... are honestly why I come. They are so dang good. Just cookie ice cream goodness that you just can't go without. Even if I try not to I always have to get one. Always worth it. Overall... BJ's is good.. but in my opinion overpriced. Maybe just come for the pizookies!!
Mary J.,San Pedro  CA,9,23,3,10/23/2016,2.0,We ordered delivery last night through grubhub (I already posted the same review through them too). We were in the area visiting friends and decided to order food to our hotel. Our kids had been running around all day and we knew they were too tired to be able to go out to eat and behave even moderately well. So  we ordered from BJs. I placed the order at 5:50 and the delivery time was showing 60-70 minutes. We didn't get our food until almost 8pm  after we called the restaurant and they flagged down their delivery guy. The order was incomplete and was missing an appetizer  the food was cold and it took 2 hours to get to us. The total order was over $130 for 4 adults and 2 kids meals. It was a pretty big let down and the added joy of hungry young kids crying for the hour it was late icing on the cake. I'm not sure if it's the restaurant or grubhub who employ the delivery drivers (or if it is the fault of the delivery person or the restaurant)  but either way it's a representation of your brand and it was significantly lacking.
Hazel M.,Santa Ana  CA,0,27,5,3/6/2016,3.0,3 stars because ever other time I've come here it's been a good experience. I would rank the actually restaurant at 5 stars but NOT the service we got last night. My friends and I came here came here last night ad had the worst waitress. Natalie? She had such a bad attitude and would throw around sly remarks when she could. We didn't get a single smile out of her. How Rude. I've worked in customer service before and I know how you're supposed to act. We had to send back 2 pastas because they weren't great  so coincidentally our pazooki took 45 minutes to bake  and was extremely dry..hmm....unfortunately her unnecessary attitude out a damper on my best friend's birthday.
Vaibhav V.,Irvine  CA,110,106,,3/4/2015,3.0,The only reason why BJ's is a significantly frequent evening destination is because of the great vibes and the pizookies -- a simple and elegant dessert invention. I have been here around ten times due to everything from birthdays to team bonding events. It does the job but doesn't hit the spot. I recommend the chicken jambalaya and the cajun pasta -- both filled with flavor and well-cooked. Try the deep-dish pizza  as those are rare in Southern California. The barbecue pizza is meh and lacks the flavor to continue onward after two slices. Of course  don't leave BJ's without a pizookie.
David D.,Tustin  CA,186,19,16,10/7/2014,3.0,"Ehh  compared to a lot of other BJ\'s I\'ve been to  this location has the worst service. You don\'t get that usual friendly warm welcome from the staff as you do with the other locations. I only go here for convenience but would much rather visit the BJ\'s in Huntington Beach  Orange or even Puente Hills if they weren\'t so far.The food is consistent with all other BJ\'s so I won\'t spend too much time reviewing the food. I will note though  that 2 out of 3 visits here (when I actually ordered food instead of just getting drinks at the bar) I had some sort of misfortune. First time (back when they still had the marina meatballs) they forgot to order it so it took 45 minutes for it to come out. Second time the bartenders were changing shifts and forgot to order our spinach and artichoke dip so the new bartender had to re-order it for us. On that same visit  there was hair in our pizza between the cheese and the sauce. Granted  they took care of the spinach artichoke dip for us  but no love for the hair in our pizza? Just a ""sorry about that."" I wouldn\'t expect to them to take care of it since we ate most of the pizza before finding the hair  but at least a more genuine or sincere apology would\'ve sufficed.Overall  if you\'ve never been to a BJ\'s before and this is the only one within reach  I wouldn\'t stop you from coming here. I would  however  suggest going to another location if you\'re looking for outstanding service."
Catherine L.,Irvine  CA,6,81,106,1/30/2016,3.0,Came in with a 17 people reservation. The place was extremely packed with students from a school event so I guess that was why the two pasta dishes we ordered were both extremely undercooked. Regardless  the service and pizookies were on point as always so the visit was enjoyable nonetheless.
Rachel D.,Laguna Niguel  CA,0,7,,9/18/2016,5.0,We went here for my friends birthday and had the best service ever! Our servers name was Kelly and she really cared that we had a good experience. She was very attentive  extremely friendly  and answered my many questions. My friends and I come about three times a month  we are going to ask for Kelly every time.
Jennifer Q.,Tustin  CA,771,360,367,8/13/2014,2.0,so ive been here a few times and finally decided to write a review on this location. for the most part i have had good experiences with staff and wait times  but during happy hour times at the self seating area there is trouble with getting servers to come check in on us and take our orders. i have had multiple good experiences with having huge groups coming here to eat and being seated promptly and taken care of but usually only with big groups. ill be honest i havent had the best experiences here but its not a terrible location.but lets get down to the important stuff... the food:-Cheese & Tomato Large Pizza ($15.25): thought because it was so simple it wouldnt be good but oh boy.... DELICIOUS highly recommend because the crust is delicious and everything else tastes so yummy on this!!!-Pizookie ($5.95): it was okay but i dont think these are worth the hype. i do prefer the chocolate flavor over the others and i mean if you are going to try this then get the chocolate flavor-Classic Burger ($8.95): thought i could not go wrong with a simple  basic burger but i had a weird tasting burger. the meat was flavored very strange and overall was not good... DONT GET IT-Spaghetti with Marinara Sauce ($9.95): TERRIBLE! im a sucker for basic marinara sauce pastas and this was the worst!! im not sure if its the sauce or just idk it was not good... DONT GET!-Happy Hour Sliders ($5): simple  delicious  and lives up to the standard slider. for five bucks you get three (i believe) simple sliders with cheese and a side of fries to go with it. i would get this again!overall.... if you crave BJs then go here but i prefer to head to different chain restaurants unless its for the happy hour or pizzas!
Harrison C.,Irvine  CA,0,10,,3/18/2016,5.0,My family and I come here on a regular basis  and we are never disappointed with the food or the service! Staff members are super friendly and often check on customers to see if they are satisfied with the food and have everything they need. Whoever the chefs are  I am happy to give them huge compliments for the great food! I have tried the Jambalaya (my favorite!!!)  the Southern Fried Chicken  grilled chicken  some burgers  salmon w/quinoa  and some items in the lite menu  and I am always satisfied with the seasoning and cooking. The crispy brussel sprouts are a nice starter as well... So addicted! This is one of the best BJs I have been to  it keeps me coming back for more!I have never tried any drinks since I do not  but I have eaten with friends who were more than satisfied with their drinks. Beer and cider are definitely their specialty when it comes to drinks. A great place to stop by for a satisfying meal with family or friends!
Nancy M.,Westminster  CA,35,33,3,10/9/2015,3.0,Sometimes service is great sometimes it's like the servers don't care. I notice the ones in the green apron are more assertive and attentive then the ones in the other apron. Why don't I just ask for a server in a green apron next time just to have good service. Food is okay. Spinach dip isn't that great. Too much cheese. The deep dish pizzas are my favorite. Happy hour is fun there. Decent price drinks and food $6-$9 for drinks and food.
James L.,Garden Grove  CA,1101,934,1820,4/16/2013,3.0,Decent Happy Hour- probably doesn't trump Lazy Dog or Yardhouse for me though.Among the things I tried  I would get the mini pizza again.The spinach artichoke dip wasn't that good; nor were the sliders. I was disappointed by the boneless hot wings... they looked like shriveled up version of McDonald nuggets.I can commend the service being on top of their game all night- that was the saving grace. I would come here if you don't have picky taste buds.
Sa N.,Lower Peters Canyon  CA,5,2,,2/21/2016,1.0,I had a terrible experience: NEVER BOOK HERE FOR ANYTHING. They messed up on our reservations  took 40 min to prepare the food  did not provide us utensils before we got our food  and our group was eventually separated. Never COMING back again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sam T.,Brea  CA,0,48,4,10/4/2014,2.0,The food was phenomenal as always  however  I was very disappointed by the service. I've frequented BJ's over the years and this was my first time at this location. The hostesses seemed very flustered and didn't even bother greeting us. We ordered a deep dish buffalo chicken pizza. Our server had placed our plates on top of the stand for the pizza... Later  when a different server brought our pizza out she just stood there staring at us. We didn't realize that the plates were in her way. She could have asked us to move them but chose to stare at us until we got the point. Our server's shift ended and he introduced us to our new server. She did not refill our water once and barely said 2 words to us. When she brought our check she dropped it on the table without even glancing in our direction. I will say that the food and drinks were great but I will not be returning to this location due to the lack of hospitality.
Shannon M.,Oceanside  CA,26,8,,11/15/2015,1.0,It's literally killing me to give this place the minimum 1 star in order to post the review. That 1 star will go to the waiter  who was calm throughout our horrible experience. Calamari? Undercooked  giant blob of crap. Artichoke hearts? Overlooked and they tasted like they were cooked in old oil. Root bear wings were decent but the celery was old  water loved and the tops of the stalk (who eats that?). Oh  and then came the pizza...complete with the hair. I couldn't take any more. I got up and walked out while the GM was trying to defend the horrible food. I will never come to this BJ's again.
Walter M.,Oceanside  CA,1859,1606,606,7/10/2014,3.0,Some companies get it and others don't. Some things are convenient and others not so much. As many of you know BJ's can be hit or miss in terms of wait/service. Case in point. I've literally come during a rush and been told 30 minute wait  driven to another BJ's 30 miles away and been seated and eating before my friends who I left there was. That's the kind of massive discrepancies you'll find at some BJ's. It's very area and time dependent. As an early adopter I'm all over online ordering  mobile apps and of course rewards programs. Chipotle gets it  easy  fast  quick to navigate  accurate  convenient. BJ's online ordering is the exact opposite. Their large menu is not intuitive  it's not fast  it's accurate  but when you pull up into curb side and call in  maybe they pick up  maybe they don't. Maybe the ticket on your foot says 21 minutes before pick up and maybe your food comes out 14 minutes late. Maybe you eventually come inside and see the dining room pretty empty. Who knows. I haven't and certainly don't have the time to track and document the rushes here  but I can tell you if you want to get back to work in a reasonable hour and think that curbside or ordering ahead will work. It will not.As with most BJ's the food is solid. You can't really complain as their menu selection is good and they have solid items and great beer pairings. It's not a sports bar despite their full bar and TV's and dark wood. It's not the cheesecake factory with their way too big a menu and lack of more salt of the earth items. My go to items are the avocado egg rolls and santa fe spring rolls  balance  bold and I like the avo cream sauce for both  when fresh are excellent appetizers  seared ahi tuna salad and a cocktail or craft beer. Don't expect too much local  but I'm a fan of their Tatonka stout. They have a very middle eastern seaboard brewing style across their in house offerings. Love the craft root beer  but too bad it's not free refills. Nothing is overly hopped (except Hopstorm)  seasoned  roasted or IBU'd so it's a basic  but full offering.Service is ok  it's pretty good when you come here late or early  but in between  forget about it. Staff is very polite and usually apologetic so I generally sit at the bar for faster more attentive service. Classic dark wood  wall window ambiance. I dig the gluten free menu options and the small bites offerings. Spinach stuffed mushrooms have tons of flavor packed in single bite sized eats. Baked  not fried. Fried artichoke hearts with just lemon are just fine  no need for aioli aka mayonnaise. Don't get the mac and cheese  it's a kinds of failure. Something about the mixture of meats and cheese for a deep dish really separates the supreme pepperoni from the veggie options. The classic is ideal for the sausage. It's maybe kinda close to the style they do in Chicago  but very corporatized. Burgers are ok  tons of fries  but it ain't no red robin  they need work. Higher heat  better meat mixture  the burgers are well put together. I prefer the pork chops over the steaks because honestly if it aint prime steak it's not worthy. The pork chops are almost never dry and it's a hearty meal. Spaghetti and meat sauce are pretty solid a backup when carb loading. Appetizers are pretty large in general and shareable which is why the small bites are so good for those who eat alone.Pizookie is excellent  even to go. A must try is the salted caramel with the extra caramel sauce. Literally this 1 item is the saving grace to an otherwise mediocre restaurant. I'll keep coming back for that alone  love the 3 pack  but a variety sampler of all would be great  sure you can do it on your own  but ordering is a pain online like this.They are open late so your ideal is for people who get out of work late or those looking to wind down with a nightcap  but more often than not the experience will keep them mediocre.
Jennifer L.,Long Beach  CA,134,10,,8/18/2014,1.0,Pass on this overpriced waste of time! They messed up my order  made us wait for our food for 20 mins. No bread nothing! No water refills and messed up on the bill (charged for two drinks and only ordered one). You think we would have at least gotten a free cookie for dessert!1 salad  1 burger  1 soup and 1 soda = $45And the food was bland  greasy and left a rancid aftertaste in my mouth!
Yash M.,Fullerton  CA,201,69,32,2/21/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Ok. Gave it a shot to give them another try. Walked in at 11:20 pm. Hope  thats not an issue coz they are open till 1am. Been over an hour . Ordered 2 appetizers and 2 beers.2 beers came right away.. ( money maker ) 1 appetizer (chicken wings) came 35 mins after. The other appetizer (stuffed mushrooms) not to be found over an hour . Not looking good.
Elizabeth B.,Orange  CA,2,32,14,9/7/2015,5.0,Natalie was our waitress and she was wonderful ! She kept our drinks refilled and our food was hot when it came .
Joyce G.,Irvine  CA,6,4,,8/25/2016,1.0,Very poor customer service from the front check in counter. Whoever was working as Hostess on the front desk around 12-12:30 on August 25th should not be working that position. I understand hostess doesn't cover the bar area but if she could see a booth open up there and ask the person who seats people to hold the booth  she surly could have told those waiting for a booth that one was available if they wanted to seat themselves. Then when asked what why she had a smirky smile just repeating they don't seat bar area. Doesn't make sense. Left and went to another restaurant. I had been eating here on a pretty regular basis and a member of their Premier Rewards but that kind of service and attitude I don't need.
Taylor M.,Tustin  CA,106,3,,9/12/2015,5.0,I came to bjs tonight with a bunch of my friends and Stephanie L took care of us and she was so awesome ! She's one of best servers there ! I'll definitely ask for her next time I go.
Jeff M.,Orange  CA,19,509,2,11/27/2014,4.0,We went to BJ's to watch the UCLA vs USC game this past weekend..place was very crowded and full of energy. We both ordered off the light menu...I had the Mediterranean Chicken Pita tacos while my friend had the turkey burger. Both were very yummy...especially given they were relatively healthy. Give this place a try....nice place to watch your favorite team and I hear the pizza (deep dish) is good.
Paul A.,Stanton  CA,28,8,36,8/2/2014,2.0,I am giving 2 stars for this reason. ....we had placed our order (given that we did take a while to order..) and still waited 1 hour for our food.We finally spoke to the manager (Scott) and we advised him of situation (meanwhile Ray fell asleep)  and he jumped in and handled the issue.I am not sure if i'll come back to this place  but if I did  it would be because of Scott.If waited on by jessica  I will leave and never come back.Good note  the food was goood especially the bison bbq burger.
Lauren N.,Irvine  CA,57,33,21,1/9/2014,4.0,Happy waiters  variety of food  great cocktails  and of course... Pizookies. I usually only come once or twice a year but I discovered they had peppermint icecream and have been going to get Oreo Pizookies with that on top with friends. There is usually a wait but I've always been able to find room in the bar which serves the full menu  too!
Robert F.,Laguna Niguel  CA,0,49,50,10/9/2015,1.0,We love BJ's  but like all food establishments  CONSISTENCY is the name of the game. We have met some of the corporate guys (over the years) whose job it is to make sure each restaurant is following the corporate formula. Today  I ordered the PORTOBELLO and MUSHROOM SWISS burger  NO BUN. At the Tustin store  it was pathetic-looking on the metal tray. Not at all appealing  as it arrived at the table. At the Laguna Hills BJ's it looked great (the way it was presented)  with the sides (lettuce  tomato  etc) neatly placed in the corner  the two sauces in a little metal serving pods and the burger  with a good-sized mushroom on top. At the Tustin store  it looked like someone threw it on a plate as an afterthought and no side sauces.
Asraa A.,Irvine  CA,6,11,17,8/29/2015,1.0,Worst service ever  we came with party of 15 including kids. The front desk girl after making us wait for 20 mins she took our party outside when it's 95 degree outside  also when no one else from.entire restaurant was sitting. Bad
Andrew L.,Irvine  CA,61,17,,7/31/2016,2.0,Disappointed. We have come to BJ's a few times because it is close to where we live. I usually get the pizza. Nothing fancy. Tomato and Cheese. The last few times  the pizza is just not that good. A bit burned on the top and not much cheese. The cheese just doesn't look appetizing. I love deep dish pizza. I used to go to a place in the valley called Numero Uno. My mother-in-law also got a regular salad. It was almost all greens. There was slim to no tomato or even carrot. What's going on. It's always busy but I am just not impressed anymore with the food.
Kevin K.,Irvine  CA,1,13,1,3/25/2015,5.0,Well I do not post many reviews unless exceptional service was provided...or if it's something really worth posting. PRO - As for this review I must say that the one thing that makes us come back each time is the pasta and pizza and the great service that Bonnie provides on a consistent basis. She remembers our names and even how we like our orders when we return... Thanks Bonnie for provided such great friendly personalized service!CON - As for the waits sometime it's so crowded it's not worth a 45+ wait so avoid it on the weekends and or if a major sporting event is on if you want to get in and out.Possible Suggestion for Management -maybe consider better weekday sun pm - thur pms happy hour prices and times.... You have tapas the new brewery coming and they will give you a run for the money if you don't do something to lower the wait times and your rewards program needs to lower their limits and or should include total bill price towards rewards. Also your front doors should be adjusted to open easier for all guest. Overall thank you for a great place to eat in the market place.
Chapsim N.,Newport Beach  CA,1,40,6,2/23/2015,1.0,It pains me to leave this comment but after so many issues I had too. Over the past year the service and quality of food has declined immensely in the past year. I've been an avid customer since this location first opened.The accuracy of our orders are never correct which is severely unfortunate due to the number of food allergies we have. Calling in is a waste of time   not one person of the staff truly cares .
Bonnie T.,Rockaway Beach  OR,7,17,4,12/23/2015,5.0,Seating was terrible but all else was excellent! Our waitress was the funniest waitress I've ever had. I love her and her sky diving story! She made the night!
Steven U.,Honolulu  HI,1024,236,1805,10/17/2013,3.0,Went to BJs with friends. This is the closest one to my house so this is the one I go to the most. I wouldn't say I am a regular  but I am a huge fan of chicago style pizza. There is no real substitute for pizza from Chicago  but sometimes it subsides the craving.This BJs is pretty much a machine. Moving people to their seats  feeding them...getting them out. Service is usually pretty quick and food is usually good. I normally get BJs favorite. Texture is good and ingredients are usually prety fresh tasting. No real complaints.3 stars
Rayne L.,Fountain Valley  CA,44,10,,1/25/2015,5.0,"I didn\'t eat at this location  but I just ordered take-out and I was so impressed I had to say something to someone about my experience. The staff was super friendly and even though the kitchen was obviously busy they made it a point to check on special items I was looking to add to my order. Both of the people behind the counter were helpful and kind  they allowed me to add sides that weren\'t ""normal"" options (an extra piece of beer battered fish). When I thanked them for being awesome  I was met with a thank you  followed by a statement (from the guy behind the counter) about customer service being his job. I explained why I felt the need to tell him and his coworker that they rock  we laughed  and it was good. Also  this location is the only one in the area that offers bottled beer for sale. I love that I can come here to get my favorite beers that they make. I will absolutely be returning here to get take out  eat in  and generally enjoy myself. This is my new favorite location!"
Jaqueline Y.,Tustin  CA,429,273,334,1/9/2013,4.0,I'm a fan! I've gotten great service at this particular BJ's  and was even comped my meal on NYE when I received less than stellar service. We usually order The Great White  which is a nice creamy Alfredo pizza with mushrooms  tomatoes and grilled chicken. My absolute favorite appetizer is the mini-Bruschetta. I don't even like tomatoes  but BJ's makes this dish so well. Over the holidays  BJ's had a 2 for $20 special - 2 soups/salads  one medium pizza and one pizookie. We chose a half/half concoction for our pizza: The Great White & the Bacon Cheeseburger. Bacon Cheeseburger was surprisingly good. The only thing I would say is that it's a bit heavy compared to the rest of the pizzas at BJ's. Another time we went  we chose half/half of The Great White and the Buffalo Chicken. I have to say  this is now one of my favorite pizza combos ever. The Buffalo Chicken was so good - the pizza was drizzled with just the right amount of ranch and buffalo sauce (not overpowering at all)  topped with diced celery and grilled chicken. The diced celery gave the pizza the perfect crunch and texture  I was in love from bite number 1. As for appetizers  we've tried the clam chowder soup  the broccoli cheddar soup  tortilla soup and Caesar salad here. Everything is great  but soups are a little too salty. Tortilla soup is presented in an awesome way  with the toppings served in a bowl and soup poured over at the table. Pizookies are always great - my favorite remains the original chocolate chip cookie  but the Oreo and Triple Chocolate are yummy as well. If you ever need to take your pizookie to-go  let your server know and they'll have the kitchen bake your cookie in a tin pan for your convenience! Love it!
Enio D.,Kaneohe  HI,7,8,,7/24/2016,2.0,Service is poor  once the food is served hard to get someone. The portions are big  but uninspired at best. The pizookie is good.
Christine M.,Fullerton  CA,0,1,,7/18/2016,1.0,WORST SERVICE EVER. Each time I come to pick up my take out no one is ever at the desk to help me out. AND no one is ever at the front desk at the entrance to greet any of the guests.
Jasmine C.,Northern  VA,0,101,6,6/22/2016,3.0,Ordered for curbside pickup at 11:00. Arrived at 11:05  phone rang for over 60 seconds before someone answered and tried to put me on hold without even letting me speak. I was then disconnected and had to call back. Food didn't come out until 11:14  and it was the wrong order. Sat waiting until 11:19. Didnt leave til 11:22. The food earns the 3 stars. Service gets 0 stars. What kind of restaurant lets you leave with this kind of experience without any attempt at restitution?
Jeff L.,Newport Beach  CA,22,271,2042,10/13/2013,3.0,Good BBQ chopped saladPizza isn't as hearty as it used to be and a little on the bready sideBoneless wings were good though smallish on the portion side.
Kayla L.,Orange County  CA,125,252,50,4/9/2013,2.0,Food was alright but the SERVICE was what really made me never want to come back here. We were seated pretty fast  but our server never handed us any napkins  no utensils  and when we asked for things it seemed like she completely forgot about us and we had to flag her down. One of my friends was using his piece of bread as a fork because he didn't have anything else. Sad  sad  sad. This place is so loud  too. Talking to other people at the same table I was sitting at was near impossible we should have just resorted to texting each other. They need to get some much better service out on the floor because the only reason I keep coming back here is probably because I look forward to ordering a pazookie.
Larry L.,Tustin  CA,135,122,751,7/25/2014,4.0,I like bj's   they are solid and service is good. Happy hour is a good deal if u come early and get good seats  this location i font like the layout  better the one at block of orange. The flat bread pizza) california is good and no too much dought  Gin and Tonic is tanquerai
Sara P.,Irvine  CA,243,577,248,5/31/2011,4.0,I have been to this location 2x for the happy hour. I'm in love with the Nutty Brunette Brew.. YUMMMMM They are usually pretty busy for happy hour and the quicker you can get in the better. The ahi appetizer is amazing! The last time we got a mini pizza that was soooo yummy and mushroom tops. They have great HH prices and the servers are always really friendly.
Carol B.,Anaheim  CA,0,25,,6/4/2015,2.0,Used to love BJ's for their Chopped (Cobb) Salad. A year or two ago they took it off the menu  but you could still order it. Last time we went there I couldn't even order it. What restaurant doesn't serve a Cobb Salad? Very disappointing. I won't be going back.
Katie N.,Irvine  CA,1,8,2,4/20/2014,1.0,I've been coming to this BJ's for years and I've never experienced any major problems with service or food. In fact  I would have given 4 or 5 stars  but my visit two weeks ago was enough to knock all those stars off. We came on a Tuesday night as a party of 12 for a birthday celebration. To start  we were nicely accommodated considering we had so many people arriving at different times and we hadn't made a reservation. We had a nice table on the patio outside  and we ordered drinks  appetizers  and food without a problem. We even got a complimentary pizookie for the birthday boy! Our servers were adequately attentive despite our party size and disorganization. Everything was fine  and when the check came out  I was really happy with how the main server was working with us. She told me that we could write numbers next to each of our individual orders so she could split the master check into smaller checks to bring back for each of us. How nice was that??The glaring problem began when one of my friends handed her credit card directly to our server to pay and never got it back. It was nearing closing time and we waited around for a bit  everyone got back their cards and signed off on their checks  and we were still missing one card. We decided to ask our servers what was going on  and they were confused  as if they had never received that card. They went to look for it; the main waitress came back a couple of times to tell us she'd had no luck finding it. Now  I understand that large parties can be more challenging to take care of. It was extremely kind of our server to even offer to split our bill with that numbering method. I understand that mistakes happen. But every time this server came back to our table to give us the bad news  she didn't seem apologetic in the least. In fact  she acted like it was one of our faults that the card couldn't be found. Maybe it was the fact that it was now well past closing and she wanted to clean up and go home  but her attitude was completely unprofessional. I was surprised that the manager didn't even come out to address such a big problem. The waitress essentially told us to pay that portion of the bill because we hadn't given her the card  and that my friend could call back in the morning to see if it had turned up. Talk about a buzzkill for an otherwise good night!Oh yeah  and after my friend had already cancelled her card  BJ's found it the next day in one of the check books  just as she remembered giving it to our server. Maybe the waitress just wasn't in the mood to look very carefully that night. I can't say I'll be coming back any time soon.
Jesus V.,Rancho Santa Margarita  CA,119,86,41,4/24/2014,2.0,Not a fan. I came with my roommates and the server was rude and incompetent. Another server had to come and bring the check after a long time of waiting. The only good thing was the piece of pizza we got while waiting to be seated. Probably won't be coming back any time soon.
Erika K.,Fresno  CA,2,24,22,5/30/2016,1.0,"Just left BJ\'s with my family.Service:Very poor service. In the beginning we waited a while but then the manager came to take our drink orders because the server was ""busy."" After waiting a while longer our server finally came to take our orders. We were very patient until it got to a point where it was taking too long to receive our appetizers. After 45 minutes  we asked if they can please check on our food and it FINALLY came later. The appetizers came with the entrees and we were waiting for plates so we could eat... After realizing she wasn\'t gonna bring it  we asked for plates. We sent back the calamari because the batter was sooo greasy and bitter. We asked for ketchup many times for our French fries  and we received it when we were almost done eating it. Even though service was bad  I thought maybe the manager would come apologize. Nope.. I was wrong. He was busy making jokes with the servers. The kitchen staff was bringing the food out to the tables  and everyone around us was frustrated because of how slow and bad service was. Overall  they need to train their servers and managers because this was ridiculous. If the server came and let us know that the kitchen was backed up  we would\'ve understood. But they never checked up on us and only gave attitude. At the end of our meal  a different server came and cleaned our table and brought the check. We will not return to this location again."
Kristina M.,Tustin  CA,538,76,39,4/11/2014,4.0,This is my favorite BJ's location! Tonight I went with my two boys (6 & 8). We were seated right away  but it was still early for a Friday night. The waiter was helpful. The boys got Pizza and Grilled Chicken. The sticky rice was done perfectly! I got the Santa Fe Salad. Delicious! They do offer an allergy menu  if you ask in the front. It has all the main menu items marked with the top allergens. This makes my life SO much easier  although it is a limited selection. Also  they now have a Gluten Free Pizookie!!! Yippee!! I'm not going to lie...that's why we come. :)
Ly L.,Orange County  CA,19,75,384,2/18/2013,2.0,1. Cold fries2. New fries were drenched in oil. Not oily. Drenched. 3. What kind of BBQ chicken pizza doesn't have BBQ sauce? I only give this place 2 stars because our bartender worked his butt off that busy night  and he did a great job.
Pooneh A.,Irvine  CA,0,40,2,11/7/2015,1.0,We ordered pene pasta. We received another kind! We asked them to change  the second time the pasta was not cooked at all!
Ron H.,Irvine  CA,144,54,7,2/4/2016,1.0,I am a frequent customer to the BJ restaurant chains. This visit to the BJ's in Irvine was very very disappointing  especially when I was here to have my good friend celebrate his birthday. It was all good until our food order was placed by our not so happy waitress. Usually BJ's waitress / waiter are super friendly and smiles a lot however this time she wasn't. We placed our drink order  4 appetizer  and our 2 large entrees with 2 sides. We waited for a little bit of time and we got one of our side dishes the tomato capree salad first to share as an appetizer. After we waited for quite a bit of time ALL OF OUR FOOD came out at once which includes all 4 large appetizer  2 large entree dishes  including full rack of ribs with fries. Immediately I was very surprised how all of these came out at once. I am betting someone forgot to bring out our appetizer as all of the appetizer were cold. We had the calamari which seems it was friend twice and was not hot from the fryer. We ordered another round of drinks but it never came. So we asked for it again and still nothing.!! The buffalo wings were cold like it's been sitting out for about 20-30min. Our California Club flat bread pizza was also cold where the cheese already started to harden. The full rack of ribs was cold and the outside skin was burnt where you taste more of the burnt skin and heavy BBQ sauce. We were hungry and I was embarrassed to even tell my friend this a great restaurant where I often visit frequently. None the less we ate as much as we can bare. After we finished most of the food  we told the waiter it was our friends birthday so we got a free mini boozkie. This requires some time to make but NO ONE EVEN bothered to take our finished plates away. We sat there and chatted for over an hour and when the desert came our mini table was still filled with used dishes. The waiter didn't even bother to help clean up the table so we stacked 3 piles of plates. While the candle on the ice cream was melting. The waiter came back and took 2 of the pile and left the biggest pile of large plates on our table. He never came back for it  no one wished my friend a Happy Birthday  and we had to take pictures with piles of empty plates on our table. I wanted to say something but no attention was given to us. We dined for about 2 1/2 hour and I wanted to get my check but my waitress was no where to be found. Being the tech guy I am I paid over the BJ's APP and continue to sit and chat for another 30min. No one thanked us. Honestly I am very disappointed with the service here  the quality of food is terrible and i'm questioning the temperature of the food to even meet health code standards.
Jordan D.,Irvine  CA,0,3,,1/7/2016,5.0,I had one of the most enjoyable experiences at BJ's today at lunch all because of Stephanie. Stephanie has such a bubbly personality and made us laugh a lot. She didn't cut straight to the point to ask us what we wanted to drink  but engaged in conversation. She was very honest when we asked her thoughts on our entrees. I hope the next time we come back to BJ's we get Stephanie as our waitress.As for the food  the pesto chicken sandwich was a tad spicy for my taste  but the caesar salad complimented the sandwich very well. We also got a peanut butter s'mores pizookie and that is now my favorite pizookie. I'm looking forward to my next visit.
Jon T.,Fremont  CA,934,869,43,7/8/2012,3.0,Came here on a Friday night with some friends to get some drinks/food/desert. We had a party of 7 and were sat very quickly which was great! however that's pretty much where the good service end. While our server was NICE he was not a good server  he checked on us very rarely and we waited FOREVER for all our orders to come out. it wasn't until we had to wave him down and told him to cancel our orders that he said that they were almost done and he'd bring it out. and the place wasn't even that busy when we went so i really don't see how he could have been so occupied with other things. Still had a good time though  but the pizza here wasn't as good compared to the other BJs pizza's i've had before  we had the ranch chicken one and it was VERY bland  not sure if it was because of the lack of sauce or what but i felt like i was eating white bread...
John N.,Irvine  CA,2,7,,11/28/2015,1.0,When you need a steak knife to cut your pancakes. Fail. But the server was great. Seriously though  do they make the pancakes with plastic flower? Don't go here for breakfast  unless you are teething.
Nick D.,Laguna Niguel  CA,114,71,47,11/4/2014,3.0,Never a good start wen you sit at the bad and it takes at least 5 mins for the bartender to acknowledge you  and a few mins later to get a water and a menu. I understand they are busy and all  but still.
Stephen P.,Los Angeles  CA,154,1099,2739,5/1/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,3.5 stars A major upgrade from my last visit.Where to go on a late Sat night for a casual drinks and food? BJs is a great option. It's not too packed at 11.30pm  nor a graveyard shift. How much would you expect to pay for 2 specialty beers (stout and Piranah)  2 appetizers (slightly bland  but spicy advocado egg rolls and can't go wrong with chicken buffalo wings...stingy on the celery sticks) and a dessert (fruit burst crumble; not too sweet and a la mode with cheap vanilla ice-cream)? The bill was $38 + tip and we were stuffed. May be skip the dessert next time ;)
Katie B.,Irvine  CA,27,230,,4/26/2014,2.0,This is my least favorite BJ's location. I've been here 3 or 4 times. The enclosed patio is always loud  and it's hard to have a conversation. The service is slow  and usually unfriendly. The menus are dirty and sticky  as are the tables. While the food is on par with other locations'  I'd avoid this one.
Hannah C.,New York  NY,548,388,992,8/11/2014,5.0,One of my favorite parts about this restaurant is the service. Every waiter we've gotten has been so nice and so welcoming. The food is always good and the place is always lively; people either dressed up for a fancy dinner or a family dinner. I love the versatility of this place!
Qui C.,Huntington Beach  CA,730,838,191,8/17/2010,4.0,***Happy Hour Review***For some reason  Bj's is always so freaking packed! Luckily for us  we found 3 empty stools at the bar and our bartender was very attentive and nice. He explained the happy hour and recommended some good appetizers. Happy Hour:$1 off cocktails and drafts$2 off appetizers50% off mini pizzas50% wine on TuesdaysGreat White mini pizza - This is their most popular pizza and i totally see why. It's creamy  flavorful  delicious without being overwhelming. It seriously tasted like a plate of pasta but perfect in every sense. 5 starsPizookie Trio - we got Chocolate Chunk  Triple Chocolate and Peanut Butter. The Triple Chocolate was good the first 1-2 bites  after that  it becomes too much! My gfs and I love chocolate too but damn  that's intense. The peanut butter was good  had real chunks of peanuts and that gave it a nice crunch. The chocolate chunk was the best  BEST!LOVE THEIR PIZOOKIES :)
Geeyoung L.,Irvine  CA,60,242,451,9/5/2014,3.0,I came with a party of 7 for lunch on a Friday. We ordered 3 of the 2 for $22 special which includes 2 soup or salads  1 medium pizza  and 1 pizookie. We got the lobster bisque  caesar salad  and clam chowder soups. The lobster bisque did not taste very good  and was definitely not a favorite to any of us. The caesar salad had pieces of brown lettuce all over in it  and it was drenched in salty caesar dressing. We were pretty disgusted at the lettuce. The clam chowder soup was the best out of the three  but it was very salty. For the pizza  we got the Great White  BBQ Pizza  and half Buffalo/ half BJ's Favorite. The Great White pizza was very bland  I couldn't taste the alfredo sauce at all. Most of us didn't really like the Great White pizza and were disappointed. The BBQ pizza was very bland as well. The flavors were dull. The BJ's Favorite tasted just like a combination pizza from any place. The buffalo pizza was probably our favorite out of the four  although it was very salty. It was somewhat spicy  and had a ton of celery on top. After  we got 3 pizookies - the peanut butter  cookies and cream  and salty caramel. I asked for the peanut butter smores pizookie  but the waitress brought out the peanut butter one  so I just kept it. The best part of the meals were definitely the pizookies. Although they're really sweet  they were tasty. The service of this place was horrible. We constantly asked them for water  more coffee  etc. but they did not come back for the longest time  forgetting what we asked for. It was pretty frustrating trying to get them to bring what we asked for since they kept forgetting. I let them go for bringing the wrong pizookie out  but this just shows how uncaring the waiters were. I would rate this place overall of 2.5  but I'm rounding up.
Natalee O.,Temecula  CA,131,27,84,6/5/2013,3.0,Great service!! Friendly staff. Except for the super quiet hostess. Could barely understand what she was saying to us as we walked to the table. I ordered the Mini Deep-Dish Mediterranean Pizza. Ohhh my goodness. It was sooo delicious. Would probably taste a lot better if it wasn't sitting out before I got it. It was not even hot. It was on the border of cold and warm. My dad's dish came out warm. He ordered the shrimp tacos. But he said he didn't like the tortillas  I guess they were too hard. So he just ate everything in the tacos lol. The only thing we enjoyed in the meal was the chocolate chip pizookie. At least that came out hot. As always  it was sooo good. Just melted in my mouth.
Gary G.,Fort Mitchell  KY,0,1,,3/30/2016,2.0,I ordered the half sandwiched and soup. The soup was salty and the fries were cold. They only brought out the sandwich only after I mention it. They have a problem with quality of their food. This problem also goes to their east coast restaurants.
Schel H.,Greater Los Angeles  CA,652,1742,1509,5/2/2012,4.0,Ok something I wont often admit... I am a fan of this particular chain. I am a fan of BJs for a few reasons; service  beer  and grub.But this location was a fun meetup for a lunch with my parents. So The munchkin  my parents and I were relaxing and having a great meal.But this place has some great things going for it IMHO. Plentiful free parking  clean facility  well trained staff  big tv's all over showing all the games... Ok now onto the food. PRO TIP #1: The craft root beer is outstanding if its a fresh keg  if not its flat and bleh.Alright I have had almost everything you can imagine from this place:*Pizza Deep Dish 4.5 stars*Lettuce Wraps 4 stars*light menu porkchops 6 out of 5 stars (ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS and its under 600 calories)*pizookie 4.5 stars*burger 3 stars*craft root beer fresh keg 5 stars*craft root beer old keg 0 stars*craft beer depends on which one but they all seem pretty tasty to me*the munchkin almost always gets the mac n cheese *the munchkin loves the happy face fries like nobody's businessPRO TIP #2 You can get craft beer swag (T's  glasses  etc) if you want to.Service at this location has always been a 4 star kinda deal... I can just say that this place is really tasty and that I have always enjoyed coming here. Perhaps I will see you here sometime.
Rosemary T.,Tustin  CA,532,675,2393,11/27/2010,4.0,Pizza  pizzoki and chicken wings are the three best things here. I always have to get the spinach and artichoke pizza when I'm here! And  it's always macadamia nuts and white chocolate pizzoki  buddilicious. If I'm extremely hungry that day  i would add a side of hot wings as appetizer. But  I try to get my wings at Buffalo Wild Wings  the best wing place EVER existed.  The best time to come is Monday through Friday from 3:00 ~ 6:00pm. You get HALF PRICE on all pizza  $1.00 off for appetizers  and $2.00 off for drinks. Imagine paying only $5.00 for a mini pizza instead of the regular $10.00  oh yeah! Best deal EVER ^^
Jamie B.,Irvine  CA,3,19,,10/2/2015,3.0,I have frequented this BJs probably over one hundred times. This by far is the worst service I have ever had. Yes  it's a busy Friday night. However  basics like taking my menu after I order  refilling my drink when it's empty  and giving us plates to eat from when you bring us a pizza are basics. Very disappointed. Also  being quoted 20-25 minutes  then waiting for 40 is not great customer service. Only giving 3 stars because my gluten free pizza was good.
Jenn D.,North Las Vegas  NV,4,78,45,4/19/2015,3.0,It took them over 25 minutes to give us our food. We had to cancel our salad order because our pizza got to our table before our starter salad. I would have reminded our waitor Joseph Y about the salad had be ever checked up on us. The pizza and pizookie was tasty though
Jan B.,Irvine  CA,14,125,22,4/12/2014,2.0,"Food is just average. Food is the same low caliber as TGIFridays  Red Robin  Applebee\'s - where nothing is cooked at the restaurant. Everything is frozen and all they do is heat them up. Service is also just meh. Our server would not hear what we\'re saying and would say  ""What?!"". Sounds uneducated. If it weren\'t for my companions saying I should tip at least 20%  I would\'ve tipped nothing."
Becca H.,Lake Forest  CA,72,201,131,8/10/2014,4.0,My boyfriend and I have got take-out from here two times. Each time the person on the phone taking our order is very nice  and doesn't rush us with our order. Our orders are always correct  and still hot when we get home. The buffalo chicken pizza is really good! We also got the ahi poke appetizer which was great! We also got two mini pizookies to go and they were still got! They put the ice cream in it's own container and separate bag. Overall the to-go service is great- let's hope dining in is just as great next time.
Theresa G.,Austin  TX,253,163,15,3/10/2014,3.0,Decent Happy hour-never really cared about the food. The staff is pretty rude. I went around 3 to meet up with co-workers and a young blonde girl (hostess) just kind of looked at me like wtf do you think you're doing? Other then that the waitress we got was wonderful-she accommodated our large group.
Art V.,Los Angeles  CA,0,12,,12/3/2015,4.0,Love the place for some beers and grub at the bar. That's what I usually come here for.Beers are outstanding and the HopStorm IPA never disappoints.The crew working the bar is very friendly and always down for a joke or occasional rant about what's going on in the game on TV...which is nice and makes you feel welcomed.Speaking of TVs  they have a great setup at the bar  and I never had a problem getting whatever game I wanted to watch on one of their screens.Come here. If anything just for the beers. Damn...now I am thirsty.
Mona M.,Irvine  CA,479,248,14,6/29/2014,4.0,I came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend. They said the wait would be about 20 minutes  but I think we got seated within 10. The bar is open seating. Our server was very kind  efficient  and helpful. I loved their pan pizza. It was super filling and had a good amount of toppings. The fried avocado rolls were delicious  as well as their ceviche. They also have a good selection of beer. For the service and selection  I'll definitely come back. Not worth waiting a long time for though.
David B.,Irvine  CA,0,15,,12/18/2016,4.0,"I think that this BJ\'s does a great job overall and we always enjoy our meals and service almost anytime we visit. They also have a great selection of brews  which I just love. However  even though The Margarita surpassed The Martini many years ago as North America\'s favorite cocktail they can\'t make a decent one here no matter how many times they try. Even their ""top shelf"" margarita sucks and is always inconsistent. A friend & I visited the other day and both ordered The Top Shelf margarita and they each had a different color and a different flavor. The main reason is because they insist on using a mix that appears to be made up of simple syrup  orange juice and some artificial color from something; it is just awful! I hope that they read this because you first start with crushed ice (not ice cubes from a machine)  3/4 oz. of fresh lemon/lime juice  1 1/2 oz. premium tequila (Casamigos  Don Eduardo etc.) 1 1/2 oz. triple sec or Contriue  shake well & pour into sea salt rimmed chilled margarita glass and that is it! I would pay $20 every time for one done right but will no longer order them there and will stick with Lightswitch Lager etc. Sorry for the rant ;-)"
Michelle L.,Irvine  CA,1217,1090,156,5/15/2012,4.0,I like BJ's. There's nothing that bad about this place. I've been coming to BJ's for years now and while I don't love it any more than I did a few years ago  I don't love it any less. It's one of those places that stays consistent and that is what I like about it. BJ's has a pretty wide variety of food. It's not going to be the BEST thing you eat  but it's tasty and will fill you up. It's also open late  and has a nice atmosphere. And if you're like my boyfriend and need to be in front of a tv during a game  they will change the channel for you. So it's a good thing all around. I've tried a lot of things on their menu and everything tastes pretty good so go ahead and order whatever you desire. Their pizza is probably the safest choice. Or the burgers. BUT...if you're like me  you're not at BJ's for the food. You're there for the PIZOOKIE. Just get it. I don't care if you're full. GET A PIZOOKIE. It will make your life 10 times better and you'll be left scraping at the bottom of the pan for more. Delicious!!!God I need a Pizookie right now. 4/5
Kim T.,Orange County  CA,1155,1047,2823,10/15/2012,4.0,Always been a great place for casual food and drinks. They carry one of my favorite drinks  Framboise. I love ordering the giant baked potatoes topped with veggies and grilled chicken. Recently had a pretty good steak here too. Pizookie's are always a must.
Jerome T.,Huntington Beach  CA,183,55,48,10/21/2014,4.0,Good customer service from the employees. The waitress was very attentive. Ordered the barbecue chicken pizza and they cooked It to perfection. Good overall experience.
basla N.,Torrance  CA,0,21,2,3/18/2016,1.0,Terrible service!My friend and I were having a drink at the bar. After few beers  we had to go to the restroom. When we came back after 2 minutes  our table was cleaned and someone else was sitting there which is odd since we did not pay yet. That is not why i am complaining here though. I am complaining about what happened next.They first asked the couple sitting at our table to move  but we told them that is not necessary. We were sat at another table. We then asked for our beers that they took and half the appetizer that was left on the dish. What they did later was totally disrespectful. They gave us half a beer each and they discounted half of the appetizer we were having without asking if we wanted another one. Maybe i was still hungry and wanted to finish the food. It was their mistake and they gave us half a beer which could be less than what i left in my glass. The waiter explained that they could not fill our glasses more than that because of California law????Looks like we have to find another place for our happy hours.
Jason L.,Irvine  CA,56,43,96,2/14/2015,1.0,I hope you are wise enough to avoid this specific franchise location. Normally the chain is decent with a solid menu. Unfortunately this place had staffed the WRONG work force. From hostesses that turn up their noses when you enter to incompetent wait staff that can NOT get your basic order correct. I strongly recommend you AVOID this specific location like the PLAGUE.  don't waste your hard earned money. Better off hitting anywhere but here.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.
rowena h.,Irvine  CA,3,13,2,9/16/2015,1.0,Horrible service!!! They charge us for ordering soda water  WTH??? Our waiter never checked back on us and this is a Wednesday night. We tried to call other waiters but everyone was too busy. Never coming back to this location.
Lindsay L.,Riverside  CA,258,25,45,10/3/2015,5.0,This review is purely on my experience tonight with our server Nicholas (Nick). Even with the big homecoming party going on he gave us the right amount of attention and gave us excellent service. I have been to this BJ's many times and have never received such great service. Thank you Nick. We will be back to visit you.
Liceth R.,Anaheim  CA,0,2,,5/5/2016,1.0,Worst experience ever!! Our waiter didn't check-up on us to make sure we were doing ok. Also  I called over our waitress to order a second beer and she didn't bring out. When I asked her about my beer order she was confrontational and said that I never ordered the beer. The waitress was not happy to help us out  some entrees and appetizers came out cold  the service was just horrible.
Jeff H.,Irvine  CA,0,3,1,2/6/2016,1.0,"Tried to have lunch with a group of friends today. It was an absolute disaster. After waiting over an hour for my pizza  a simple cheese one  it arrived stone cold. The waitress said they ""forgot to bring it out."" My wife ordered a salad. It came out at the 1.5 hour mark. One other of our friends had to leave early and ordered an entree and a dessert. Her ice cream came out first. Her entree never arrived. It certainly appeared like no one was in charge there today  and the place wasn\'t that busy. They are lots of other places to eat around there  so we\'ll skip BJ\'s from now on."
Allyson M.,Seattle  WA,187,668,391,10/21/2010,2.0,Maybe I'm more fond of the Yardhouse because BJ's is just meh for me. But it's all relative because next to that restaurant across the parking lot (yelp.com/biz/lazy-dog-ca)  this place is like 5 stars!We've been here a handful of times  but I guess I haven't reviewed it. On our most recent visit  the service was pretty bad. But I guess we reaped the benefits. First  my bf got the big fat fries instead of the shoestring ones. Someone must've noticed because they then brought a plate of shoestring fries a few minutes later. I looked around and felt BAD because it seems like everyone else was waiting eons to get their food! The couple next to us ordered salads with no meat at all (yeah  I was eavesdropping  I guess... but there's not much space between tables) and I swear it took at least 1/2 hour for their orders to come out. Anyway  my order was eh (which is one step down from being meh). I got a mini deep dish pizza. The texture was like mush. I would've gladly waited 30 minutes if they could've cooked it a little bit longer. Heck  I might as well have taken a flight to Chicago. @_@And no... didn't order the Pizookie. I was too scared that I'd get Pizough.
Vanessa H.,Bakersfield  CA,299,987,78,2/6/2012,3.0,Once again I break my No Chains Rule to review an establishment whose food  service  and overall experience is meant to be uniform no matter which location you enter.Normally BJ's is a 4-star kinda place for me; I'll admit it. Their pizza is deeelish  and the Great White is one of my favorites. They have a good selection of beer  including their own house brews  and are usually clean and well-kept. But because of my solidly 2-star experience over the weekend  I'm averaging it out to 3 for this review.We had a group reservation  with a preset menu  for 21 at 6:00 on Friday night. The idea was that our pre-ordered food would be ready AT 6:00  and we could begin eating immediately. At 6:00  however  the front of the house folks insisted that we needed more people in our party in order for us to be seated. I get that you'd need this for a regular reservation (and it's a long shot to think that all 21 people would be on time)  but for a group event where the food should ALREADY be ready  I'm not sure what the point is of making people wait simply because we haven't met some imaginary quota.Well  come to find out that the food ISN'T ready  and won't be ready for another 30-45 minutes. This was irksome not only because it wasn't what we had signed up for  but because some of us had pre-paid the event organizer and needed to grab a bite and leave early (and it would have been even MORE irksome to pay for food that we didn't end up eating). It was a disappointing experience -- not enough to prevent me from coming back  but enough to make me think twice about hosting a group event here.
Alyssa J P.,Naperville  IL,259,855,59,6/13/2012,2.0,I came here for a rehearsal dinner that was buffet style. I was very happy that the Powers That Be at the restaurant made vegan meals for Jeff and I  but honestly they could have done more than given us 1/8 pound of pasta with a 1/4 cup sauce on top. I left extremely hungry (considering that everyone else in my party got a ton of pizza it was unfair) and wound up buying 2nd dinner. Oh well.Also  according to my sister  the pizookie was overrated and kinda sucked.
liza V.,Los Angeles  CA,12,61,11,8/23/2015,5.0,First  we love this place! We look forward to this being our cheat meal and enjoy every bite. Today was even better because of the customer service we received from our waiter  Ian. He was very attentive and was overall great! I even had to tell the manger what a great job he did and how I noticed the whole team really hustling to provide great service. I noticed a bus boy (sorry  I'm sure that's not the most appropriate name for it) carrying huge loads of dishes and clearing tables like a mad man! I stopped and complimented him too (his name is Ramiro). Overall  the pizza was awesome but the service was the cherry on top!
Andrew L.,Irvine  CA,943,115,2211,6/19/2014,4.0,Pros and Cons Pros 1. Wonderful selection of pizzas  sandwiches  and appetizers.2. Tasty Food 3. Large restaurant with very spacious seating Cons 1. Crowded often 2. Slower Service I really enjoy coming to BJ's Pizza for lunch or dinner. They have a wide selection of deep dish pizzas  sandwiches  and salads. All of the pizzas are very good especially the Hawaiian and the BJ's special. The crust is soft and there is a generous portion of toppings. The prices are affordable and there are plenty of choices. Also  the restaurant is very spacious and there are several tvs to watch to keep up with sports games.
Katrina S.,Tustin  CA,0,5,,10/10/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Stephanie S is amazing. I came in to meet my friends and she greeted me right away  got my drink quick and always came back to check on us. She has a good personality and definitely has the strength of a server. I'll come in and ask for her each time. Good drinks and wings too
Junqing G.,Irvine  CA,109,140,7304,6/15/2014,3.0,We came here for dinner on Father's day. Took advantage of the new BJ's mobile app to order ahead of time and to get a prefer position on the waitlist. Got there before 5pm and the place was already packed but we waited no more than 5 minutes and got our table. We ordered Fish and Chips  Hawaiian Mahi Mahi  Avocado spring rolls  Angel Hair pasta  and Spaghetti with Marinara sauce. Overall the food was ok but on the salty side. We also paid via the mobile app so from start to finish it was relatively quick without all of that waiting before the mobile app. There are so many other restaurant choices so we will come back but maybe not too soon.
Nick K.,Aliso Viejo  CA,42,32,8,9/10/2014,4.0,Have a craving for unique high quality pizza? Then this is your next place to visit! From the wide variety of pizza topings available to the great low-key atmosphere  BJ's has it all. Plus  there beer selection is definitely worth trying out! They have some great brews for a fairly reasonable price. OF course let us not forget the best part about BJ's: Their Pizookie! This is an incredible taste of freshly baked cookie with cool ice cream on top. It really is difficult to select a favorite at BJ's  either the pizza or pizookie! The price is pretty reasonable and a great place to catch up with friends. The food quality is always exceptional and I do enjoy their wide variety of food options available. The restaurant decor and atmosphere is relaxing. They have very comfortable booths for seating as well as several TV's for people to catch the local sports game and a full service bar. The only downside to BJ's is the service. I have been to BJ's for several years and always loved and enjoyed the food and quality of it but the service was nothing more than average- especially if you have a large party  more times than not the service will be slow and take a while to fill requests. I understand that it is difficult to handle a large party but it would have been nice for the restaurant to have an additional server to assist to ensure our requests have been made.
Kevin W.,Irvine  CA,0,6,,2/24/2016,1.0,WoW true greed. I slipped and fell due to us-safe slippery floors. They took my info but not so much as a phone call or a free drink. wow also not even a sorry from managers i think it would be a different story if my lawyer gave them a ring watch your step no really watch your step.....
Chris W.,Tustin  CA,0,6,1,11/8/2015,4.0,Good food and good prices.  I have not had a bad experience dining in and they have been very accommodating to my large family.  Their take out however ternds to be rude and has messed up my order several times.
Adam H.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,70,9,15,8/9/2015,5.0,Enjoyed our food and service. Our server Amy took the time to suggest something better and was on top of our drinks. I would definitely go back and request her.
B S.,Irvine  CA,1,39,8,11/5/2015,4.0,This is the spot for sporting events and beer. Great deep dish pizza.
Vy S.,Orange  CA,394,328,303,8/21/2010,3.0,"BJ\'s Restaurant is like that old pair of shoes you never want to throw away - they\'re comfortable  you know exactly what purpose they serve  and you can\'t seem to try something new. This BJ\'s location is no different than any other I\'ve been to - packed full even after 7pm on a Thursday  service was standard rather than stellar  the food was familiar and the beer was frothy cold - that\'s fine by me.I came in for happy hour with my boys  which runs from 3-7pm (there\'s also late night happy hour after 10p). Make sure to get your orders in before 7pm because if they enter it in and the computer has already switched  it\'s full price for you.My go-to drink is the Jeremiah Red mixed with the Berry Burst Cider - affectionately known as the ""Jerry Burst"" - drink it  love it  and savor the smooth beer cider medley. Also  my friends and I tried the new flatbread pizza appetizers - actually a decent choice and pretty light compared to their deep dish pizzas. A pretty good happy hour outing if you ask me!"
Sarah P.,Torrance  CA,94,17,1,7/31/2015,5.0,Wow! I love this place! I would compare it as going into a Toyota dealership and leaving with a Lamborghini. Bonnie was outstanding...she was so prompt  as soon as I sat down  she was there with menus in hand and a smile on her face. Her service was of the highest quality and every time I come back  I will always request her as my server. The food was top notch and Bon Bon's service was the icing on the cake.
Kelley M.,Las Vegas  NV,23,13,3,3/15/2014,4.0,I enjoy BJ's Happy Hour for wine once in a while after work. I never really cared for the food  but the appetizers are yummy. The bartenders have always been very friendly. The only downside is that the bar is usually packed and there is only about a foot in between each table. You're super lucky if you can find an open bar seat!
Eric G.,Orange  CA,0,7,2,2/12/2015,1.0,Great food. Love bjs. Service here is absolutely terrible though. I've been sitting at a booth in the bar for over 30 minutes and not one person has stopped to help us. I even flagged a waitress down to ask for menus... Still no menus.... This seems to be a reoccurring theme for this bj's.... I'm an idiot for coming here... Smh...
Christa K.,Tustin  CA,177,86,45,6/17/2015,5.0,We love our server Kerrie! She is the sweetest and remembered us. She takes such good care of us and we love coming here for happy hour after our long day working at the restaurant.
Jenn P.,Irvine  CA,223,285,230,1/14/2014,3.0,There is really not a lot to write about BJ's. it's your typical american chain restaurant.The inside resembles a brewery  decent sized bar area and lots of tables. The bar gets busy during happy hour and on game days so be prepared for a bit of a wait. I unfortunately found out that after opting for a table when the bar was full on Sunday  that we could not get HH if seated in regular dinning.BJ's offers a pretty large menu that can meet most people desired meal. The pizzas are big and made deep dish style. I think these are BJ's best menu item  besides the pizzokies of course. Everything else it good but not stellar. Average salads  pastas  steaks  etc. I do enjoy the large variety of soups though. The tomato basil is my fav. And last but not least the infamous pizzokies. A warm cookie with your choice of ice cream. Can not go wrong with these.Full bar  decent HH. Decent priced items.Service has always been friendly.
Alexandra T.,Tustin  CA,17,5,1,2/12/2015,1.0,The service here sucks. I sat at my table with my boyfriend for over 30 minutes just to get menus. Then another 15 minutes with the menus waiting to order to be told the kitchen is closing soon. No shit that's why we got here 45 minutes ago.... Need to find a new bjs this one has terrible service.
Imran K.,Walnut  CA,3708,718,48,10/5/2013,4.0,This is a one huge and clean BJ. The parking was packed and the restaurant was at full capacity and we got a superb table. The service was quick and the server awesome. The order came in quickly . Loved the Santa Fe Spring Rolls which Crispy spring rolls filled with tender chicken  black beans  fire-roasted red peppers cilantro  sweet corn  jalapeos and Monterey jack cheese. Served with our Santa Fedressing and avocado cream sauce  then garnished with green onions  fresh redpeppers and red cabbage.Had the Barbecue Pizza and this was delicious too.had a great time.For dessert the macadamia nut cookie and vanilla ice cream was delicious.
Helen L.,Irvine  CA,91,29,2,6/17/2014,4.0,BJ's always have a great selection in food. The food is always warm and fresh when served.This is a great place for hangout and casual setting.They have their own great beers selection.
Daniel M.,Irvine  CA,62,9,2,10/1/2015,5.0,Ian was our waiter and was fantastic! We had a big group  which is already hard and he went above and beyond to fulfill our needs! He is a great waiter and the devotion he has for his job is amazing! Best dinner I've had in a long time!
Catherine K.,Corona  CA,188,1,,7/28/2015,1.0,Not the one to write yelp reviews but the other night service was something else. Came there after work around 9:00ish with some friends and sat at the bar. Waitress gave us attitude all night and only checked up on us once. Horrible!!!
Will M.,Santa Ana  CA,554,638,2411,10/25/2009,3.0,We usually visit this place every month of two. This latest trek was on a Friday afternoon at 1:30 PM. What a difference this place is when there aren't a boatload of teens and/or little kids jumping on the seats and proving how they can manipulate their parents in a public place. You can appreciate how nice the place looks. They've got lots of big screen TV's  and is super crowded when there are big sports games or events. Some of the servers go home at that post noon rush time. So you may get much better service or not. Inconsistency is one thing you'll often experience with BJs at this location. I only live a few miles away  so this is a convenient place for me if I want some microbrew and a decent meal. Ome of my favorite items here is the Asian Chicken Salad. They use Napa Cabbage  red cabbage  carrots  chicken slices and green onion all put together with a creamy sweet sour sesame dressing  and topped with a pile of fried noodles  I really like it  but it's $13 now  and at that price  it's not a great value IMO. Neither are sodas at $3 now. It's going to make tap water a better option. Water is better for you anyway  and I'm finally beginning to eliminate the ordering of cokes or beverages. But being a beer fan I will keep ordering micro-brews on tap which I can't get at home very easily. BTW  in years past  Tustin's tap water was rated by some agencies are better than average.I also like the Balsamic Chicken also $13. It's got two chicken breasts  a rich sweet balsamic vinegar served with greens and potatoes  though I asked and got white rice instead. This dish is filling. There are lots of good chicken dishes  including fried chicken breast and the lettuce wrap appetizer. With a glass of one of their lighter beers  it's excellent. Some other favorites are the lunchtime meals with a half sandwich or pasta dish  and soup or salad. There are other combinations are well for about $12 but it varies depending what you get.The star of this place is the deep dish pizza. I know lots of people prefer the thinner crust crispier pizza. But I like their deep dish crust so much I could just have that with balsamic vinegar and olive oil  and a glass of merlot. My favorite is the works  the $20 for large combination pizza with a little of everything on it. We always order the large  and is perfect for 3 people. With 2 people  you'll probably take some of it home. The really talk up the pizookie  and it's good warm served with their porter beer or coffee. They have a really good happy hour deals at 10 PM at night. I once rented out one of my rooms to a fraternity guy at UC Irvine  and he and his friends used to go at least once a week for their great deals on a college budget. I like the food at BJs a lot  but be prepared for inconsistent service.
Christina P.,Tustin  CA,90,244,102,10/22/2012,3.0,I'm a regular? Well  I guess that would happen when it's walking distance from my house. It's FREEZING cold inside. Which is fine with me  when I remember to bring a jacket :)The hostesses are pretty efficient. Enough so that they have time to chit chat with each other and check their iPhone's to see what's going on in the Facebook world...We have been pretty lucky with our servers for the number of times we've been since I moved in - in January. They have all been knowledgeable  attentive  and quick. Minus the one guy that did not seem to understand that when someone was out of a beverage  they probably wanted more... Other than that  they've all been great.The food is okay. Nothing to write home about. I do like that they have been working really hard to re-vamp their menu with healthier items. Even though I still order whatever I want  regardless of nutrition facts.Their pizzookie's are great  but I recommend getting your own  because one bite  and you're not going to want to share anymore :)
John K.,Santa Ana  CA,3,3,,10/21/2015,5.0,I come in to BJs frequently  I must say Bonnie is one server that I have had the pleasure of interacting with many times. Her consistency of great service is a great trait and she is an asset to BJs. She always gives great service and is one of the reasons I come back again and again. Bonnie = great service. Great service = repeat business!!! Thanks again Bonnie for all your hard work it is much appreciated.
Sarah C.,Redwood City  CA,335,283,124,1/11/2012,2.0,"This BJ\'s is definitely better than the one back home in Tanforan. Every time i\'ve come here it\'s been really clean and there has never been a wait. The food is okay too  but if you really want to score a deal come for happy hour.Ah yes  happy hour! Half off deep dish pizzas  a couple dollars off of appetizers  and depending on the night really good deals on drinks. My only problem with this is that i\'ve never had good service when i\'ve come for happy hour. I understand the bar area gets busy but it\'s still no excuse for bad attitude  messing up on orders  and extreme waiting times. On one occasion our waitress gave my party serious attitude and then decided to complain about us to the bartender. WOW. You do realize we\'re sitting a few tables away and that we can hear what you\'re talking about right? The second time was more recent and my boyfriend and I went to happy hour for a few snacks. The waiter was obviously frazzled from all the tables he was dealing but that\'s no excuse for forgetting to put in an order! I ordered a tomato and mozzarella salad it never came out. I know you think you\'re cool and you can remember people\'s orders but if you\'re going to screw up you should probably write it down in the future. I also asked for ranch and he completely forgot about it until I reminded him and he was like ""oh yeah you asked for that"". The manager was going around some of the tables asking about dinner. He went to the table next to us and the people complained about long waiting times. It ends up the waiter forgot to put in their order. Too bad the manager didn\'t swing by my table  I would\'ve complained about my missing order!"
Tania S.,Irvine  CA,453,262,398,12/13/2014,4.0,"I\'m not a beer drinker so my review is strictly about food!This is another restaurant that has been in the neighborhood for years. It\'s a very popular spot for beer and pizza lovers! During football season this is the place to be. They have tons of TV\'s throughout the restaurant even in the patio area. They also have the most AMAZING wings and you can choose ""wings only"" instead of drumlets! I love wings and these are my top 3 favorite place for wings.The white pizza is also very unique and popular but I prefer the New York pizza crust over the super thick pan crust. Once in a while I do crave a nice pan crust and that\'s when we head out to BJ\'s.The pizookie is one of the most famous desserts at BJ\'s. If you never had one you MUST order one. It\'s a hot cookie with ice cream on top! How decadent does that sound? The white chocolate with macadamia is my favorite! Mouth watering dessert! Nice contrast of hot and cold. Definitely a party in your palette. Good place for a good time with friends  lively and happening every day!"
Jae K.,Irvine  CA,23,25,37,12/14/2014,1.0,Horrible customer service. Waiters and waitresses shows attitude when they get busy. I had to wait more than 15 mins to order  so we just left. Never going back again.
Desiree D.,Irvine  CA,1,8,,8/7/2014,1.0,"Let me start off by saying my family and I love Bj\'s Restaurant. We frequent the restaurant and being that it\'s a favorite of most everyone in our family it\'s always an easy option. This being said our last visit to the Irvine location was anything but satisfactory. In fact it was downright rude  the service lacked but the food was enjoyable. Giving the benefit of the doubt to maybe the servers we had come in contact with were just having a bad day we didn\'t complain. It\'s understandably human nature to have an off day. However  this is what set me over the edge refusing to go back to this location. Our family consist of three children. Needless to say we went to the bathroom a few times  one two wash before eating  once to take my younger daughter  then again my oldest daughter accompanied my son near the end of our meal. That last trip took longer than expected so excused myself to go check on the two leaving my husband and younger daughter at the table. Upon my return my husband says that he very distinctively heard a server at the station near us say  ""watch them"". Excuse me  I was appalled. Our family is not the type to cause a big stink so we paid and quietly left. I will not be returning to this Bj\'s to be treated second rate for whatever reasons we were on this day. Our family really enjoys Bj\'s and have never received this sort of service at the two Huntington locations  Brea nor Orange. I would rather drive further to enjoy a meal peacefully. It\'s so very sad in this day and age that this sort of stereo typing is still occurring. My review represents the service and not the quality of the food."
Heather G.,La Mirada  CA,6,50,26,4/25/2014,3.0,The reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because I've been to this location 3 times and sat in the bar area each time ! Everytime I've been I've had to sit and wait a minimum of 10 mins before I finally flag someone down to help - once someone is available the service had been great but having someone pay attention to you before that   not gonna happen- Plus there happy hour prices are dumb  they are 1/2 price appetizers for 1/2 the portion that's not any kind of deal people ?!Yard house is a million times better
Jessica C.,Tustin  CA,0,10,,9/11/2015,3.0,Can here for lunch the other day with my husband. I ordered the light salmon and quinoa dish. My husband ordered the steak. Our server was very professional and nice but the dish was the problem. So the salmon and Quinoa is supposed to be a healthy dish  it arrived soaked in oil at the bottom! It definitely wasn't pleasant to eat. The waitress returned it to the kitchen. While my husband is eating it took them 30 minutes to bring back my food and he was already done. I just took the to go. It's not the first time either  they should change the chefs or something.
Kenny K.,Irvine  CA,43,15,1,12/14/2014,1.0,Came in today for lunch... Left with nothing. Got seated quickly but then it turned into a 20min wait of nothing. I have come into this bjs plenty of time but this was the worst. No service. Different waiters walking past us staring at us. We just ended up leaving. Don't know if I would want to come back here again....
Iliana G.,Anaheim  CA,0,4,,2/10/2015,1.0,"So  this place needs to teach their servers manners. I came here with my husband for lunch and it took 20 minutes for them to notice us. I believe the only reason they noticed was because my husband got up to go to the restroom that\'s when the waitress Bonnie came and didn\'t introduce herself she just quickly came and I quote ""what can I get for you?"" Really not even hi I\'m Bonnie and I will be your server today how may I help you? She seemed bothered when she walked up to take our order since she had to stop her conversation with another server. Really? It\'s like wow I didn\'t know that it bothered you that much to do your job. She brought out our waters one I requested with no ice and lemon She brought ice in both and no lemon and it\'s ridiculous. Never coming again. Management needs to be out on the floor and pay attention to the servers attitude towards customers."
Janeth L.,Downey  CA,0,7,1,8/1/2015,4.0,Today we had my daughters softball team and parents attend this store  I have to say the overall customer service experience was great. The servers where attentive to our needs and helped out our softball kids have anything they needed as well. Great job guys!
Jane D.,Irvine  CA,0,9,3,9/19/2013,1.0,"I feel bad writing bad reviews  but people should be warned... this place is disgusting! I actually like ""bad"" food (7-11 pizza slices  grocery store potato wedges and whatnot) but man... BJ\'s is serving the idea of bad food in an actual bad food reality... like  over-processed food that tastes like cardboard  or like something that could be acquired through a box... I ordered the safest thing on the menu -- a deep dish pizza -- and it tasted so artificial and cold(!)  that I couldn\'t even eat it to be polite... the fact that they charge $15 for this  is what I found most mind-blowing... I could have paid much less for a frozen pizza  and would have enjoyed it much more. I\'m amazed that the place was so packed/that they even get business  but I guess there\'s a first time for everyone  maybe. Beer was fine (Orval in a bottle)  and the server/manager (the server brought the manager over because I couldn\'t eat my pizza  and I felt like such a tool  but what can you do?) were both so nice and efficient  so one star for them."
Lisa A.,Irvine  CA,141,585,110,11/6/2011,4.0,We had a really good time last night at BJ's.I asked to be seated outside  but upon arriving out on the enclosed patio we discovered how loud and hot it was out there. The girl seating us was so nice and brought us inside and found a little table right by the windows for us.I had two Kicked Up Sodas (Jger and cream soda) and it was really good! I haven't had jger to drink for awhile and I'm not a fan of licorice  but the flavors paired well together. The man had a root beer and said it was delicious...I'm all for an establishment who handcrafts sodas and beers!Food!We stared with an appetizer of Santa Fe Spring Rolls and mozzarella and tomato salad. The spring rolls were delicious  perfect portion for two people and two really good dipping sauces. The avocado sauce was my favorite. Then the mozz and tomato salad...yum! It was on their small bite menu and for $3 you got tomatoes  mozz cheese balls  red onion and some olive oil/spices on a bed of lettuce. It was fantastic and refreshing.The man got jambalaya for his entree and I thought it was pretty good! It was spicy  like a back of the throat spicy. And the portion was huge! Really good and highly recommended.I got the crispy chicken sandwich and added bacon and cheese to it. I also eliminated the honey mustard and added chipolte mayo to the sandwich. Excellent sandwich  huge sandwich to boot! The fries were ok...I got the thin ones and they didn't really do anything for me. Crunchy yes  but other than that they weren't anything special.The service was really good  our guy was attentive  nice and even offered his suggestion on the fry type. Though I didn't like the fries hahahI'll be back.
Tasja W.,Newport Beach  CA,110,76,160,12/21/2014,5.0,OUTSTANDING SERVICE FROM JOSEPH the manager. I always have big group event for my mtn bike Meetup. We usually have 25-50 people. Joseph is the best. He is very organized  great customer service and our events are a huge success there. Just had or Christmas party there last week and we did thanksgiving too. If you are looking for a place for a large group hands down this place is the best.
FreeGirl H.,Irvine  CA,0,14,1,8/28/2014,5.0,I am writing about one specific dish - the Kale and Brussel Sprout salad with Blackened Salmon. THE BEST!!!!! You can also get chicken or shrimp as your protein. Since I tried it  it is the only thing I ever get  it's SOOOO delish!  The balsamic chicken is really good also!Plus the salted caramel pazookie? Fuggedaboudit!!!!
Stanley C.,Orange County  CA,558,417,10,6/15/2012,5.0,When need of a bar or a good hang out place in Orange County  I enjoy coming to BJs. It's very lively  definitely on the louder side  but always a great time. I especially enjoy their happy hr 3pm - 7pm and 10pm until closing. They even have this for Fridays (yes there isn't much to do in Orange County)Happy Hour:$1 off cocktails and drafts$2 off appetizers50% off mini pizzas50% wine on TuesdaysI've gotten more and more into Beers lately and they have a nice selection and seasonal beers. Easy to drink and love the taste.
Elyse F.,Cincinnati  OH,44,348,817,1/5/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,BJ's Pizza seems to have changed their pizza. The texture of the pizza is different & they no longer serve the pizza in the pan. The pan was not for ascetics. In no longer serving the pizza in the pan the pizza is barely warm by the time it reaches the table. We went back a second time after the change and found the same problem. Also  out pazookies were so overcooked they crumbled when being chipped out of their pans. Frozen pizza & refrigerated cookie dough would have been better.
Porter R.,Tustin  CA,0,56,2,8/4/2013,1.0,"BJ\'s used to have the best deep dish pizza. We used to go here once a week in Huntington Beach. In fact  I was so fond of BJ\'s  I proposed to my wife with a pazooki (the ring was in a small plastic egg  encased in vanilla ice cream  on top of the cookie).We moved to Tustin and continued our weekly visit to BJ\'s on Jamboree. Then they decided to use pre-baked Boboli pizza crust instead of real  deep dish pizza. The soft  doughy bread that you usually find under the sauce and cheese....GONE! Now you need a knife to cut your pizza because you\'re pizza is now a week old pre-baked dry P.O.S. with all the ingredient\'s heated on top. What a joke.You\'re better off going to Little Cesaer\'s Pizza and getting their ""Hot and Ready"" deep dish pizza. No joke. BJ\'s  your pizza has gone to the birds  so I won\'t be coming back. Sorry."
Tristy N.,Orange  CA,28,11,4,12/10/2015,2.0,My friends and I went there for friendsgiving. When we left while waiting for other friends in the restroom one of my friends stepped on something and she thought it was chocolate BUT NOPE! It was POOP! Ewww! The waitress didn't do anything when we let them know. She laughed at my friend. My friend had to ask for napkin to clean it. Then while my friend went to restroom to clean up  one guy from the kitchen came out and used his towel to picked up the POOP! And the manager asked us if it was ours? Wth? How the heck we carried poop with us? We told her we saw it when our friend accidentally stepped on it. No sorry or fast cleaning up. I don't think we will go back there because we won't know if they will use the same towel that picked up that poop to clean our dishes
Roxana M.,North Hollywood  CA,0,11,2,8/13/2015,5.0,Visited Bjs Tuesday. Food was great  love the Santa Fe chicken salad. Service was great! The restaurant was nice and clean. Loved it!!!! Desert was specially delicious. Most important of all the staff was very friendly and professionals. I will definitely go there again!!!
Jacelyn C.,Irvine  CA,20,447,297,5/16/2014,4.0,This is near to home for quick bites. Good food  decent portions  and reasonable prices. Dont forget the pizookie! Ultimate dessert bomb! :)
Natasha G.,Laguna Niguel  CA,64,12,14,4/27/2014,5.0,For a Saturday night you would think it would be packed for a party of 5 people  but got seated almost instantly.The waiting room was very elegant and roomy.The staff here has excellent attitude towards customers and to making sure what you order is exactly what you wantedOur waiter was dedicated to his job!I would definitely come to this location again!
Chriss L.,Fullerton  CA,41,506,252,11/14/2011,5.0,If loving our experience at a chain restaurant is wrong  I don't wanna be right.I know it's a chain  but when you get great service & phenomenal food  you can't help but..... WOOT.and woot  I will.It's so hard these days to find a place that has:a) great serviceb) exceptional foodc) reasonable pricesBut two outta three aint bad.Hubby had a steak with horseradish potatoes & steamed beans. I could not believe how tender the steak was! We could have (but didnt!) given it to our baby  it was so melt-in your-mouth- tender! The gravy over it had plenty of flavor without being overwhelmed with salt.I had the sesame chicken salad. It was big  but small. Does that make sense? hm. It was too much for me anyway. The dressing was light and not overpowering the salad  and they let me sub lettuce for cabbage (not a raw cabbage fan). I only wish it had more oranges & bell pepper.For dessert we enjoyed a PB pizookie  and let us have the ghirardelli choco icecream. I like pizookies  but I've never wanted to leave my husband for one until now. I could eat this winning combo every nite. It was all the flavor of a REese's PB cup poured into the deliciousness of a warm cookie and frosty icecream.The cherry on top of our evening was an attentive & friendly server (I didnt get her name).
Jane P.,Santa Ana  CA,0,14,,7/2/2015,1.0,Great beer and atmosphere. But the food has gone downhill and I often leave feeling overstuffed but unsatisfied.Worst of all  my then boyfriend (now husband) who looks very young but was in his late twenties at the time of our visit  was grilled by the manager because of his appearance and his foreign ID when he tried to order a beer. She acted like she was Homeland Security  asking questions about how long he was staying in the country  what the purpose of his visit was  etc. Not at all appropriate. She was way out of line. He was so upset afterward he was shaking  and we could not enjoy our beers. I seriously hope that woman is gone now. I wish I had gotten her name and written to corporate but it's too late now.
Claudia R.,Milford  CT,93,677,2,12/18/2013,4.0,Surprisingly  we got a table for 7 at 7:30 on a Saturday night! It must've been our lucky day.On this night  we received the best service I have even gotten at a BJ's. Our server was extremely nice and attentive. He was more than happy to accomodate my vegetarian junkfood needs.Had a yummy burger with a veggie patty and some great skinny fries. Everyone in my party was very happy with the food AND the service.
Jami A.,Irvine  CA,44,123,22,3/31/2015,5.0,BJ's is definitely one of my favorites. We always get the pizzas here. Either the bbq chicken or the mediterranean. They're mouthwatering! We just had the shrimp wrap appetizers recently and we loved them. I love their drink selection too. So many beer options for the bf and tons of cocktails for myself. My personal favorite is the raspberry lemon drop martini. And of course you have to get the pizzookie to top it all off (if you're not stuffed to the brim). Our bill is always over $50 when we come here so it's not very often but it's always a great meal and great service. Not just this location but all the locations we've been to.
Sean S.,Tustin  CA,2,12,6,11/2/2014,1.0,Being a server for many years I know good service and bad service. Long story short we order a few meals and aside from the order coming out wrong we had to deal with a manager who was more than rude. He came to our table asking if we had an issue with the meal. We proceeded to tell him that the meal came out incorrect and he rudely denied and walked away. We checked the menu on the way out to find that we were correct and the manager did not even know the menu correctly. On top of that being a server appearance is very important  this manger looked like he just rolled out of bed with his shirt half tucked in and a beard that was not maintained. Not a pleasant visit.
Alberto D.,Chino  CA,94,17,,4/8/2014,4.0,Went in for dinner last night and ordered the California flat bread as appetizer. It was really good. A little too crispy for my liking but overall it was good. Ordered the grilled chicken pasta as entree and it was delicious! Pasta was nice and creamy while the chicken was cooked to perfection. Service was pretty good. Forgot to bring us condiments we asked for but that's about it. Overall good place for a simple dinner
Christian F.,Rancho Santa Margarita  CA,53,65,3,6/3/2013,1.0,Do you like waiting for your table  and then after being seated  getting ignored while other tables fill up around you? Do you like trying to make to make eye contact with the wait staff while they take drink orders of the guests seated nearby  after you were seated? Would you like to spend your money in a restaurant  only to be rebuffed? If so I highly recommend BJs Restaurant & Brewhouse in Irvine  off of jamboree. Stop by today!
Shiva A.,Irvine  CA,265,315,151,5/2/2012,4.0,I come here so often it's ridiculous. Quite a few of my friends work here so i get to eat out and visit them all at once! I actually like BJ's beers  the blonde and the hef are my favorite. The Jeremiah Red is a little much for me  but it's very popular and has the highest alcohol content hah.I've tried almost everything on the menu  but the pizzas and flatbreads will always be my favorite. Awesome spinach dip too. BJ's has a pretty decent happy hour. Half off mini pizzas and apps  a dollar off mixed drinks and two dollars off draft beers? Starts at ten. Good place to hang with friends and watch sports....I don't care how full you are  you still have room for a pizookie. Why else did you come here???
Sandy P.,Orange County  CA,164,218,37,12/4/2013,2.0,The service was excellent.  I wish could say the same for the food.  Wow......not good at all. We started with the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps.  The shrimp and the Thai sauce were flavorful  however  the lettuce was so thin and limp that it literally broke apart in my hands.  What a mess and ended up just giving up all together.  For my entree I ordered the fish and chips with wedge cut fries. Fries were great but the fish was almost non existent.  When the plate was served to me my first thought was that there was so much fish I would not be able to finish it all. NO  there was so much breading that the dish was deceiving.  I had to literally break apart each piece only to find a very small piece of fish. By the time I was finished I had a plate full of fried breading.....yuck!   BF ordered the BBQ Chopped Chicken salad.  He complained that the dish had absolutely no flavor. Very bland. Again  service was great and the only saving grace.  Not certain that is enough to get me to return.
Sida B.,Irvine  CA,58,129,689,5/29/2011,2.0,"BJ\'s...we need to talk. I\'ve been coming to you for years and you really disappointed me today. Normally  I like you for your delicious pizzas  yummy pizookies  and my guilt-free favorite  the Honey Crisper Chicken Salad. You made your honey mustard sauce my all time favorite sauce  and i recommend it to everyone. Then. Today happened. I come in  I forget my camera at your table  and I call in to ask if anyone found it. You don\'t. But...that\'s not right  I know for a fact it\'s on the table. Please check again. I get put on hold for 10 minutes. I call back again  I get transferred to 3 different people for a total amount of 20 minutes. You finally tell me...""I\'m sorry ma\'am. No one\'s seen it"".I\'m heartbroken. I just bought that new Sony camera! Still  I drive 20 minutes to you to make sure  to double check  that my camera isn\'t lost forever. When I arrive  I shamelessly ask the people occupying my former table to clear out  and i check under the table  around the seat. Finally  a manager tells me ""oh  here\'s your camera. One of the servers found it but left it on the front desk drawer...withOUT reporting it"". So...if i didn\'t come back  I would\'ve never known it was missing? Why wouldn\'t you report something worth $250+??? Were you planning to hide it in the drawer  then take it home later? I\'m sorry BJ\'s. That\'s really shady. I\'m not sure if the honey mustard can still tempt me to come back. You broke my trust. :( I\'m pretty sure BJ\'s policy has some sort of lost-and-found issues in terms of documentation of items."
Elise E.,Irvine  CA,340,16,22,1/1/2015,3.0,I came on a Tuesday night and didn't expect it to be so crowded. My boyfriend and I started off with soup and salad combo. To be completely honest  the clam chowder was a little bit too salty for me and the caesar salad was just a little below average. The barbeque chicken pizza however was quite divine and equisite to my taste buds. The only thing that it lacked was a harder crust because it nearly fell apart the moment I tried holding it. The taste of the pizza made up for it even if I had to use a fork to eat it. And I got to say  BJ's definitely lives up to having the best pazookies! We ordered the cookies n cream one. The warm cookie melted in my mouth while the ice cream cooled it after. It was the perfect balance between warm and cool. The perfect dessert to end our meal in which we devoured in less than five minutes. I definitely recommend ordering it!
Terri S.,Santa Ana  CA,11,119,,3/22/2014,2.0,Great menu. The food is not consistent in flavor and temperature. We love Joe Young the server and Aaron the manager. We continue to go back. So Aaron left and the managers seem nonexistant. Since Vanessa left the feint staff could care less that you are there to dine with them. The food quality and taste jas gone downhill / so very disappointed. Heard from the General Mgr Howard who would like to address the issues and is suppose to get back to me after the holidays / we will see how that turns out.
Carrie R.,Orange  CA,87,164,163,3/3/2012,5.0,This is my ABSOLUTE favorite pizza place! Great pizza ... light and buttery crust ... If you like garlic  be sure to ask to have fresh garlic added to your pizza -- DELICIOUS!!I also luv to order the avocado egg rolls as an appetizer! Super Yummy!Oh ... and you've gotta save room for a Pizookie for dessert! We had white chocolate mac nut with ice cream! DEEE-Licious!!!!!Just be prepared .. if you go on Friday or Saturday night ... be prepared to wait to get seated. And it gets real loud in here!You can also take your food To-Go!
Edmen M.,Santa Ana  CA,0,49,14,4/28/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Another great Tuesday wine half off amazing what can Bonnie you are amazing Stephanie  great ( waitress) .. Enjoying our wine and pizza nice and relaxing good time to chill and talk- wit bestie
Marvel Z.,Irvine  CA,524,249,276,5/5/2013,4.0,I rarely compliment a restaurant for their service because when I sit down at a restaurant  I expect good service. I went in for happy hour to celebrate a friend's birthday today and was overwhelmed by the endless customer service we received. Everyone was so nice and attentive from the moment we stepped in. The funny thing is that we came for happy hour and ended up ordering nothing but a few beers from the menu. Their were some great food choices on there such as the flatbread or lettuce wraps but we just were not feeling it that day. Always order their deep dish pizza. My favorites are the buffalo chicken  Mediterranean  and white. For dessert  everyone is obsessed with their pazookie and did you know that you can mix two cookie flavors? My favorite is the red velvet and white chocolate macadamia nut topped with vanilla ice cream. This place is dead quiet during lunch time but so jam packed for dinner so time accordingly.
Kimberly U.,Fountain Valley  CA,189,47,14,9/3/2014,1.0,HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! I went with two of my friends out to dinner we are all in our 20s so not sure if they pre-judged us and assumed because we were a younger crowd that we would not tip but they could not be more wrong! We are all in the service industry. The first server we had was extremely rude! Then in the about 20 min later she left our table and we had another server who was even more rude. She even rolled her eyes at us and did not check in to see how we were. The food is great at Bjs so that was not a problem but maybe they should be more careful about who they hire as servers. I will not be returning to that location
Paulette P.,Irvine  CA,72,59,3,11/17/2013,2.0,Meh. Food was okay  nothing great. We went with a bunch of family. The hostess told us before we were seated that we can only stay 2 hours  they don't write separate checks and gratuities will be added in! Our waiter was training another server. It took them quite a while to put our order in the computer-out drinks need refilling and not one of them could do that? Some if the family complained to the manager. Then we got better service... Drinks were way over priced! A margarita is $9.25! Had I known I wouldn't have had 2.  Not a place we frequent because the wait is too long. Drinks
Julie B.,Irvine  CA,1057,727,427,3/12/2009,5.0,I love BJ's... heh heh.Came here last night and totally demolished the following (along with my ever failing diet):- thin crust appetizer pizza (the one w/ tomato  basil & sausage)- hot wings- grilled shrimp tacos- (2) berry burst ciders to wash it all down- ... and a chocolate chip pizookie - DUH!!!!!!Did I mention that I LOVE BJ's??
Kat S.,Huntington Beach  CA,124,388,31,2/20/2014,4.0,"Came in here on a Saturday night with a friend. We didn\'t want to wait for a table so we went to the bar. The bar is packed with tables for two. They are sectioned into groups of three  and there\'s about a foot in between each one. There is just enough room between each section for servers/customers to walk thru. It was crowded when we were there  but not to a point where I felt penned in. We had no one next to us for a while  and were conversing in girl chatter when a mother and daughter sat down next to us... dang  now I gotta watch my potty mouth!!! Service was good. We both got a beer (didn\'t really like the Heff) and the flat bread ""pizza"". My friend got the black and blue which was loaded with goodies. I got the club flatbread (chix/bacon/tomato)... and while it was good  there were far less on top than my friend\'s order. I didn\'t make a fuss because a) I was hungry  and b) I figured it was fewer calories for me to run off the next day!Not wanting to indulge in one of the obnoxious pizookies (although the pizookie sampler looked good)  we just got some vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup (not enough choc syrup in my opinion  but then again  I drink it right from the bottle!). Again  the service was very good  and the communication was great. I didn\'t like losing out server 1/2 way through the meal(mandatory breaks)  but our replacement was spankably yummy!"
Bob S.,Los Angeles  CA,3,9,,8/30/2014,4.0,Loud and noisy at times but it is good for sporting events. good bar good food overall good price.
Patrick F.,Lakewood  CA,165,13,31,3/6/2015,4.0,Favorite spot to watch any sporting event and enjoy good drinks and food! Happy Hour specials are always great and the beer specials are decent.
Brandon L.,Irvine  CA,0,7,,11/16/2014,4.0,BJ's is a regular hangout of mine  and this particular location usually hits the spot. The food comes out fast and hot. (I like the Corn Fritters with Bacon Aioli and the Spinach Artichoke Dip off the appetizer menu.) They have an alright happy hour  but the specials at Lazy Dog right next door are probably a better value.Service is always good - the bartenders and servers are accommodating and friendly.
Huy T.,Corona  CA,20,80,190,2/7/2014,4.0,Can't go wrong with the pizza and the Jeremiah Red! Chill and relaxing place & the avocado egg rolls are pretty good.
Tiffany H.,Indianapolis  IN,740,1078,2658,7/4/2011,4.0,BJ's gets 4 stars only 'cause of their amazing pizookie. It's always delicious with the perfect ratio of cold ice cream and warm ooey gooey cookie. Yum. The service here is pretty consistent - I've been to this location 4 times - twice with large parties & twice with smaller parties. But food-wise  GAH their ribs were not so bueno. I know - why would I order ribs here right? But  I've had their pizza so many times (which is another thing I'd recommend) that I decided to venture a bit. It was dry. Asked for BBQ sauce. Their sauce was NOT the same as marinade. :/So in a nutshell  stick with the 2 P's: pizookies and pizza.
Jodie Y.,Irvine  CA,1,17,1,3/29/2015,2.0,Came here for my birthday because I love the avocado eggrolls. This time they were okay but I think they forgot the rest of the ingredients. It was just avocado. No flavor. I got the new deep dish lasagna it was terrible! My entire meal tasted like a can I assume because that's how they serve it. everyone else seemed to be okay with their meals. Nothing great. Even the pazookie wasn't good. Won't be back. Suggesion: stay away from the canned lasagna!
Daniel G.,Irvine  CA,129,168,6,8/23/2013,2.0,Been going to this place a few times. Primarily I come for the happy hour which equates to me ordering Beer and Pizza.Pizza is average. Its a thick slice (i.e. not the thin crust a la California pizza kitchen). The ingredients are average (typical of what you find in chain restaurants) and pizza is never too hot (i..e won't burn your tongue). So its a good option for parents and their kids maybe?I usually like getting the berry burst cider/beer combo drinks (1/2 cider + 1/2 beer  usually an amber ale). its a good option and probably one of my only reasons to really visit.parking is decent  despite being in a shopping plaza with other restaurants  this place always seems to be busy for dinner. There are times when I come with a group of friends and after finding ourselves stuck in a 30 minute wait  we usually opt to try to snag a table at the bar. This is good because we get seated sooner  but bad since they dont serve all your normal food they would to you  had they seated you at an actual table. but w'evs. the rest of the food here is mediocre. pastas are bland  salads taste processed and i really haven't had the courage to throw money away by trying anything else because really  how terrible must you be to mess up pizza and beer.Oh yeah  service can be hit and miss here  there are times when i literally had to take the bill up to the counter because for some reason or another  servers refused to pass by and take the bill. annoying. And then  another time my friend had crutches  and they completely forgot to bring them back to us  which was also kind of annoying  so we had to go and ask for them back. it would have been a convenience but turned into an inconvenience due to their lack of awareness.
Sally C.,Santa Ana  CA,38,28,16,3/7/2013,1.0,:I I wanted to give this place a better rating. Be nice about the first time I came to this location. Well  the very first time they apparently messed up my pasta so they had to remake it. So the boyfriend and I waited for a very long time. They even forgot my bf's salad that came with what he ordered. I understood that it was busy and passed it off as nothing too bad. The waitress was very nice and did come check up on us. The reason why I am giving this location a 1 star rating is because of today's visit.We got seated at a table which seats four people  which I found weird  but understandable since there weren't many seats available. It all started to get bad near the end when we wanted boxes for our food. We waited for our server to come by so we could ask for a box. Tons of seats started to open up  people started leaving. Our server passed by us many times to attend to the one large table of people. All we wanted was a box and our check. I believe it took 20 - 30 minutes and she never even bothered with us. She had like 4 tables or less to take care of. We just wanted a box. Before the box deal my bf asked for a refill for me. She says she'll get me my refill then disappeared for a long while and then we had to flag her down to ask again. What really bothered me was the boxes. It took 20 - 30 minutes to tell us they were out of large boxes. I just wanted to take home my potato. Another server had to box up the pizza for us and still I waited for them to find a box for me. They finally found a box and then we got our check after a few more minutes of waiting. I was kind of irritated that she put our check in a cup. Uh  I doubt you ran out of those black check books. I didn't want to be pissy  but I was getting sleepy and tired of waiting for a box. She should have had someone deal with that simple task first if she was going to be busy with the ONE large table. The check in the cup  not sure if she was being a jerk to us by doing that. I just thought that was ridiculous. We didn't complain to her about anything  we just waited patiently for her to simply check up on us and she couldn't really even do that.I was treating my bf out tonight so I paid with cash. In like less than 2 minutes she had change and everything back to us. Really? You could do that in 2 minutes  but not grab us a box in even 10 minutes. Just really not sure about their customer service here anymore.
Dennis P.,Huntington Beach  CA,657,12,,7/24/2014,2.0,The service was terrible waited 45min to put us outside in the heat the manager never came outside to apologize or let us now that people would be outside flys all over the food the worst experience I've ever had
Rachelle Z.,Tustin  CA,39,70,6,2/22/2015,3.0,To start  we needed a table for a service dog  we were brought to a table that hadn't been cleaned yet. We then asked to be sat out of the way in the patio area  were they hesitantly accommodated us  maybe no server? We were brought wet dirty plates  for our appetizer and pizza. The food was still quality  the service was just less than par  this outing?
Bonnie C.,Santa Ana  CA,0,48,,11/17/2015,2.0,I don't get it . The only reason this place is busy is because there service is awful . Food has been better lately but service is always sub par
Beth T.,Irvine  CA,114,38,,7/4/2014,2.0,I'm so frustrated with this place. We've had extremely polarizing experiences here  but at the end of the day the issue is with the staff. The management seems to need a complete overhaul and while some of the waitstaff is excellent  they seem to be constantly struggling. My Family ate here on a thursday night about 3 weeks ago- It took us 2 hours to get through service without alcoholic beverages or appetizers. We waited *Forever* for our food and our waiter was so busy  he had no time to be apologetic. We attempted to use the app for bill pay but something happened and we ended up waiting another 20 minutes for a bill. Also  they screwed up 2 of the three orders. The food was not bad  but the service was so deplorable that I said we would never go back. Yesterday  at 3:00 however  my daughter *HAD* to have a pizookie  and since it was 3:00 on a thursday I figured they couldn't possibly be busy. We were seated immediately- not welcomed  just how many and right this way. We took our seat  and about 10 minutes later (this is too long) a young man came to the table and told us that our waitress Stephanie was busy and he was helping her. We ordered our drinks and appetizers. The drinks came almost immediately  the appetizer did not. We sat and watched a group of staff next to the bar and a man in a blue button down and a tie have a fairly jovial conversation  and we continued to wait. The Young man then came back telling us that Stephanie was still our waitress  however he was going to go ahead and take our orders (at that point isn't he our waiter?) we ordered and waited about 20 minutes for our food. All said and done the meal took about an hour- which is fine  but I feel like a restaurant like this should have service down better. This is where I really started to struggle  my child was tired of sitting and rolling around in the booth. I couldn't find the young man and I had seen a young woman with HUGE eyelashes one time (Maybe he was stephanie? if she was she didn't introduce herself?) She didn't want the pizookie anymore  but if she had we wouldn't have been able to order it because we SAT FROM 4 to ALMOST 430 WITH NO SERVICE. NOT EVEN A HOW WAS YOUR MEAL OR CAN WE CLEAR YOUR PLATES. I FINALLY grabbed a young woman who was not our waitress and demanded our check  at which point she walked over to the man in the long sleeve blue shirt who brought our check and gave me the LEAST sincere apology I have ever experienced. He told me he would take care of our check  I handed him cash and he walked away. HE HANDED IT TO THE WAITRESS. HE DID NOT EVEN BOTHER TO RING IT OUT KNOWING THAT I WAS UNHAPPY. Apparently his time is more valuable standing next to the bar and chatting with the staff. This is my perceived experience  but any business owner should understand that to your customer perception is reality and in my humble opinion you have a huge attitude and staffing issue and those problems clearly start with your management. You should take a lesson from the BJs in cupertino I've been there on a number of occasions and never once had an issue with the service. This is disappointing since we live in Irvine  fairly close. I will never eat here again and every time anyone brings up BJs this will be the story I tell them.
Edson H.,Irvine  CA,306,183,106,6/22/2013,1.0,As a long time customer  I'm so disappointed at this BJ's. I just paid $25 for what I could have gotten at Pizza Hut for $10 -- no exaggeration. My wife laughed it off but to me it's not funny at all. It was supposed to be deep dish too but wasn't even close. Completely unacceptable! I seriously hope BJ's takes this review to heart.
Vitaliy N.,Irvine  CA,0,3,,5/9/2013,1.0,Ordered honey crisp chicken salad to go  bring it home  about to take a first bite look at the chicken and its raw in the middle...How can you possibly trust a restaurant that can't cook chicken properly?Eating here COULD kill you. Never going to this place again.
Maite H.,Huntington Beach  CA,603,469,2336,12/9/2010,4.0,I was invited to a Holiday luncheon yesterday at BJ's. I haven't been to Bj's in years and I was pleasantly surprised with my dining experience. The restaurant is located in the Irvine Market Place and offers plenty of free parking. Our party of 8 was initially seated in the patio area but it felt like the heat lamps were on so we requested to move to an inside table. The host of our party ordered the following appetizers: (1) Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo - $15.95 An assortment of four appetizers: spinach & artichoke dip served w/ multi-colored corn chips  mozzarella sticks  avocado egg rolls and Santa Fe spring rolls. Nothing spectacular and kinda pricey. 2.5 Stars (2) Calamari - $8.95 Breaded calamari fried crisp and served with spicy marinara and lemon garlic aioli. Yummy! 3.5 Stars I ordered the Tuscan Chicken Limone as my entree for $11.95 2 Chicken breasts sauteed with garlic  artichoke hearts  sundried tomatoes in a lemon butter sauce. Served over angel hair pasta with baby spinach. My lunch entree was delicious because of the budda sauce. The chicken was tender and savory and the pasta was cooked perfectly. 3 5 Stars If you dine at BJ's for lunch (Mon - Fri.) turn to pg 12 of their menu and you'll find a page of entree deals! The other orders from my party included: BJ's Mini One-Topping Pizza & Salad  Half Sandwich & Soup or Salad  Fish Tacos  and Handbreaded Chicken Parmigiana. All the lunch specials ranged in price from $7.00 - $9.00. We had BJ's Triple Chocolate ($6.25) and Cookies & Cream ($5.95) Pizookies for dessert. Order these ahead of time because there was a wait until they were served. The wait was worth it! I wish I had known about these pizookies because I would have ordered one as my lunch entree. Delish and sinful. 3.5 Stars.We received great service during lunch. Our server constantly checked on us to ensure we had everything we needed. The food is 3.5 Stars but the excellent services earns an additional .5 Stars = 4 Stars
Dan L.,Temecula  CA,0,2,,6/24/2015,2.0,I came her with friends 2 weeks ago. It was their Sons Middle School Graduation. The food was ok and pizza was good. We ordered a salad to split it never came  we ordered a hamburger it was ok but no condiments came. I asked twice and by the time we got them the burger was cold. We got refills of iced tea but no ice  so it was tepid tea instead. It looked like they were too busy and understaffed. I've had a much better experience at the Temecula chain where I live 
Megan H.,Orange County  CA,10,119,32,8/6/2014,2.0,Not the biggest fan of this place. Went here for a night out with friends and two of the items I selected on the menu they said they were out of. The staff didn't even seem to care or offer suggestions. I feel they are over priced for the food your receiving. The only thing that gives them two stars is that delicious cookie!
Enrico C.,Los Angeles  CA,0,23,,4/28/2015,5.0,Great food  service is okay (gets pretty busy on weekends) and the ambiance is very comfortable. Definitely a place to take friends out for dinner. The bartenders there make an awesome Margarita! Highly recommended.
Janet D.,San Jose  CA,104,1213,1378,10/10/2014,5.0,We had a rough start for our wedding rehearsal dinner here at BJ's but the manager on staff went above and beyond to rectify the situation. We had placed a pre-order for pizza  pasta  and salads to be ready when we arrived but the manager who had taken the order forgot to put the order through. The kicker was 1. we had received a confirmation 2 days before and 2. had showed up early and confirmed with the hostess that yes things were going to be ready for us a the time we scheduled (730pm) kudos to our server she was awesome and super apologetic. She made sure everyone's drinks got replenished and really took care of us. Though we had to ask for some kind of discount  the manager had no qualms saying he'd fix it right away. I knocked off a point because we HAD to ask for something but I still think they did a great job. Then I added an extra point because another member of the party (after a generous discount from the manager) requested free pizookies and the manager gave them to us. if I am in the area craving bbq chicken pizza or deep dish pizza  I will definitely give them another shot.
TonyAndMychelle G.,Orange County  CA,4,41,38,7/12/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Just to let everyone know.... after I made my review 2 weeks ago... Tiffany from BJS sent a reply asking me to contact her. I called her less then 45 mins after seeing her reply and left a voice mail fir her and to this day NO return phone call. I'm not surprised  as this is how they have handled customer service or lack of I should say. Very disappointed and will definitely be taking our weekly dining experience elsewhere. NOTE TO BJS: I won't be calling again so save your reply.. it means absolutely nothing furthermore  it is your responsibility to contact unhappy customers once an issue is brought to your attention  not us having to chase competent personnel down. I'm done playing cat and mouse with you!
Hailey C.,Placentia  CA,10,41,32,8/22/2014,5.0,Bjs or bust. Favorite place in OC. Pizza and beer. And small bites and pizza and burgers and pizza and calorie watchers and pizza and pasta favs and pizza and special entrees and pizza and bread bowls soups and chilli and pizza and wait for it...........wait............and .......wait for it.  Pizookies! !!!!!!!!!!   :-)  Thanks James. We miss LINZO. Hi Maria
Jim A.,Irvine  CA,0,1,,6/7/2015,1.0,Just visited BJ's in Irvine  had terrible service at the bar (waited 40 minutes for spinach artichoke dip). Then I ordered a simple cheese pizza with extra sauce to take home to my family. Once I got home I found out I had a large cheese bread. No sauce could be found anywhere. How hard is it to make a cheese pizza with extra sauce? Extremely dissapointed in the food. You can go for a good brew but expect mediocre food and so-so service.
Troy L.,Irvine  CA,0,17,1,2/11/2015,5.0,How can you go wrong if the restaurant named after your favorite thing to get from your gf?
Anthony C.,Temple City  CA,823,673,991,9/29/2013,5.0,This place is like any other BJ's. I've been here a million times and I've never had a problem
Jessica C.,Laguna Hills  CA,10,60,4,12/29/2014,3.0,I want to love this place but every time we come its worse..their biggest problem is expediting food...pizza cold...salad and appetizers come out after pizza (why bother?)...the pizooki NOT fresh out of the oven...just sad because it could be ssssoooo fantastic
Joyce C.,Irvine  CA,4,11,2,7/24/2014,2.0,It a hit or miss with this place. The first time I came I was insulted by the hosted. But I have also had great service. But today I ordered the hawaiian mahi and my fish was over cooked  dry and overly fishy for mahi. Our server hardly checked in on us and missed getting our condiments.
Cheeza J.,Riverside  CA,5,6,1,3/6/2015,3.0,BJ's would be first coming to my mind whenever I want to have American style foods. The place is passionate  and their service is well trained and friendly. My favorite is the Baby black rib and Newyork steak (medium). They always provide a good quality of food  but the taste vary each time. And I love their Ahai tuna/claim chowder soup/Tomato soup as appetizers  but sometimes I feel like my steak is over cooked. But still  a good place with reasonable price.
Valerie D.,San Diego  CA,351,146,132,11/11/2011,4.0,"This place ain\'t bad at all.I get so tired of ""typical"" pizza!!!I want more veggies and flavors to feel like I\'m eating something DECENT.BJ\'s was impressive with their pizza  loads of flavor and not too much freakin\' cheese.Just wish there were more BJ\'s close to me!"
Justina B.,Tustin  CA,16,13,5,2/3/2015,3.0,I absolutely love the food here but management needs to work on having more servers. They completely over work their servers with 6/7 tables and some even a party so we get bad service.
Dave P.,Tustin  CA,101,40,57,5/27/2013,1.0,"Having reviewed this restaurant before  I am changing my personal views after this latest experience on 5/26/13.It was my daughters graduation day from college  we hadn\'t a thing to eat all day and we were starving. We thought about going to Lazy Dog and Cheesecake Factory  but since BJ\'s was close this was the decision.Bad decision  complete terrible dining experience....Food delivered cold and burgers  the ground beef was raw  fries cold...manager didn\'t give a crap  he was more concerned in counting his hourly totals. I am sorry was heard by our waitress not only at our table at least 6 times  but the tables all around received the same "" I am sorry "" treatment like us...I don\'t care how good the environment or the beer may be  if the food and service is like this  you can expect the worst.Time to step up your game BJ\'s  its not about comping meals and $20.00 gift cards to say I am sorry....Too many other restaurants in town that will definitely earn the business!"
M C.,Torrance  CA,0,6,2,2/6/2016,5.0,We have been regular customers of BJ's for the past 5 years. The manager is doing a great job running this branch! We have never left disappointed in terms of food and service. Once when the food wasn't cooked properly  the manager came out and made sure we got a new plate. Great place to go if you are looking to have a good time (place is filled with TV's :D)  great service  and AMAZING food for reasonable prices!
William N.,Irvine  CA,36,20,11,9/7/2014,2.0,A great place to football and beer. However the service and attention to customers is lacking. Food is average and not always well prepared.
Hui C.,Irvine  CA,6,9,1,12/19/2014,2.0,Here it is. I have been here several time. It's almost always busy and wait is long. I had a group of 8 ladies. We only require 2 tables technically. I didn't think the wait will be this long on week night. My party of 8 came early around 7 to wait for a table AND somebody called around 6:45 to get a call ahead seating. We did NOT get a table until almost 8 and only reason we got food quickly is because we ordered food BEFORE we got seated. Then after all this crazy wait  we were seated in their indoor/outdoor patio area where there was some kind of company/large gathering party going on. Their patio area is pretty big and it can hold close to 100 people. Well  there were more than 50 people SCREAMING and being very loud because they were drawing raffle for the group for the party. I asked for a manager on duty and asked 1) if we could be relocated( answer was no because he told me that we will need to wait another 30+ minutes) and 2) if he could talk to the big party to turn down the volume little. The manager keeps telling me that the large party will calm down as soon as Bizooki(sp?) comes out. He never said we will try to make the situation better or we will give you free customer service item  such as additional discount or dessert. The manager did not know how to handle this kind of situation well. How can he call himself a manager???Anyway  food was ok but this whole experienced left me with very bad taste in my mouth and I doubt I will ever go back with a large group or during busy hours. I also plan to contact their corporate office about the bad customer service.
Gabriela V.,Tustin  CA,41,153,141,10/27/2013,3.0,Our service was great. That being said  I think it was just ok (this visit... I used to love BJ's but I haven't been here in years). In a nutshell:Calamari (appetizer): just ok. Not crispy. Dipping sauces were bland... particularly the red sauce. We thought it would have more flavor but it was like a bland marinara.Thick crust veggie pizza: crust was great  skimped on toppings/cheese but I liked it. Regular crust cheese pizza: completely mediocre. Nothing special. Pizzookie (for my niece): always delicious. Good way to end dinner. Chocolate milk (niece): I had a sip and was disappointed for my niece. Hardly any chocolate. Kinda gross. My niece didn't finish it.
Tiffany T.,Los Angeles  CA,54,24,13,2/3/2013,2.0,"I won\'t put our waitress\'s name but I described how she was..she was blond and a lot of curl. She said ""I will take care of you!"" as a magic word that she automatically said to all around our table  no charm  just like robot. Then she doesn\'t take care of us. She says she will come back to take care of our refill and water but she didn\'t bring our drink nor water.so there is one kind waitress noticed us and took care of us.Then  the table right next to us also got mad at her bc she didn\'t care of them either. then another table left to us got really mad at her. He screamed to her. Well she deserved that. then very polite manager came to took care of them. I won\'t say this BJ is bad. I think Manager and other hard worker-waitresses are totally fine  but one waitress... she is a problem. can you imagine she made three table mad at the same time???"
Donna L.,Irvine  CA,0,1,,2/1/2016,5.0,Waiter last night 1/31  Christian deserves a BIG thank you. He was so friendly  attentive (we were a party of 8}  polite and efficient! Also one of the managers (dark hair glasses) tended to us to apologize for small pizza delay-my --grandson thought he hit the jackpot by getting a complimentary Pizzuke. It is just as important to offer a thank you ...we always remember to say something when it is a complaint.
Oscar R.,Irvine  CA,2,63,3,12/12/2014,3.0,Came to BJ's for a couple of beers last weekend since co workers said i should try. I sat at the bar and took the bartender 15 minutes to take my order and was not nice. Afterwards i was helped by other bartender and was much better. Met some cool people and may return.
Kimberly W.,Brooklyn  NY,341,241,215,2/18/2011,5.0,This place has evolved over the past 10 years I've been coming here. I used to come here just for the spinach dip... thought it was the best thing ever! Then they changed the recipe and I stopped coming for a bit. Now... I'm SO SOLD! They make the best mini appetizers ever. Last night I ordered all but the tacos and they were pretty freaken fabulous. Mac and cheese is what originally brought me in... pretty much the best I've had so far  a nice balance of creamy and crunchies on top. Pizza's are half price during happy hour... spinach artichoke is my fav. Bruchetta I've had before and ordered again. Here are the newbies... stuffed mushrooms... I was on the fence after reading the menu  but after tasting... Yup I'm a Fan! and OMG Fried Artichoke Hearts! Yes!!!! Seriously I had a mini buffet with all the different options and I was in heaven. Yup... nirvana of food. I'm ready for my second round now... mmmm... can't wait to go back!
Kaleigh T.,Orange  CA,133,12,3,1/17/2015,2.0,We made reservations for a small birthday lunch on a Saturday afternoon. They called 3 times to confirm the reservation. The table wasn't ready. The service was not good. They brought the wrong drinks out. I had a Bloody Mary and the best part about it was the pickled green bean and pepper. The pizza wasn't very hot  must have been sitting around for a while. We sent it back to to be reheated. I just wasn't impressed. The crust is good  but I didn't enjoy the taste of the buffalo chicken pizza. The salad was decent. They brought us a free pizookie (for my sister's birthday) which is an excellent dessert. It's a baked cookie with ice cream on top. But that's about the only thing I enjoyed about the meal.
Jason M.,Costa Mesa  CA,19,139,33,9/6/2013,4.0,Be sure to sign up for the rewards program. It's free and gets you lots of good food and drink and money off the bill!The service here is always awesome. We come here for a lot of birthdays and gatherings. I love the fried artichoke with extra lemons. They are not those big soggy ones you get from the jar. They have a light batter around them  with the lemon and dipped in a little of the sauce they are delicious. Another delicious apetizer and I think 150 calories is the fresh watermelon and feta salad. Refreshing and nutritious. The new handtossed pizza is delicious  I usually order it with pepperoni  mushroom  jalepeno. It's cooked to perfection. For desert the strawbery beignet is very good and sometimes I like the berry cobbler. I love hot cobbler with ice cream. Awesome location and great with large parties really amazing! Thanks BJ's Tustin
Brittaney P.,Garden Grove  CA,8,64,17,11/17/2014,5.0,Bjs has average quality food although this location deserves 5 stars because of the service I received. Out of all the the BJ restaurants I have been too  this is by far my favorite. My server Mia provided excellent service and I would be happy to recommend this restaurant to anyone because of her uplifting personality. Good service is hard to come by-dine in Mia's section!
Jane W.,Baltimore  MD,1137,632,1484,7/15/2013,3.0,"First time I went to BJ\'s  and my experience overall was pretty positive. Ordered:- calamari: I would not recommend this dish. It is $10 for the appetizer and the portion was smaller than expected. Also  they only gave us marinara sauce and two slices of lemon as condiments  and I was expecting a few more options (cocktail sauce would have been nice). In addition  the batter was kinda soggy and the calamari itself relatively flavorless.-Hawaiian mahi mahi from the ""enlightened menu"" (i.e. fewer calories): the fish itself was somewhat bland  but it was soft and the consistency was nice. Also  the flavor of the rice was able to balance out the fish  so I enjoyed this plate quite a bit. -BBQ Chicken pizza: Didn\'t order this myself  but tried a slice and thought it was meh. Probably personal preference  but the lack of sauce and rather dry chicken didn\'t cut it for me.-Pizookie trio: white chocolate macadamia  red velvet  and chocolate chunk. Delicious  but felt kind of sick after the sugar overload. BUT worth trying!"
Lisa D.,Chicago  IL,524,256,21,8/29/2015,3.0,Although I enjoy the atmosphere of BJ's  I am consistently disappointed by both my service and my meals here. The extensive menu seems to cater more to quantity rather than quality and while the portions are large  I have not been impressed by the actual taste of my food. The drinks are the same way. When paying for a $12.00 drink  you would expect to be served a drink that contains some measurable amount of alcohol. The drinks I have ordered tasted weak and were far overpriced considering their quality. The service also seems to take longer to deliver drinks to the table than food. During my last visit to BJs  my table had to wait over twenty minutes to be served our first round of drinks. Considering a few in my party ordered bottled beer  this wait time seems ridiculous. I would suggest visiting BJs only when prepared to spend more time waiting for your food and drinks and less time actually enjoying them.
Chelsea M.,Fullerton  CA,625,572,155,7/3/2011,5.0,Located in the Irvine Marketplace on the corner of Jamboree Road and Irvine Boulevard  it's a great location that makes them stand out from the crowd. This shopping center has a lot of restaurants to choose from - Lazy Dog Caf  IHOP  Opah  to name a few. The story started here in our OC stomping grounds  Santa Ana circa 1978  with a great recipe for deep dish pizza. Now  they have locations from California to Louisiana. Their vision is to be the very definition of WOW for the casual dining experience. Their promise is to be the best - never compromise. They certainly do not disappoint.Half Sandwich & Soup or Salad Lunch Special is quite a deal - your choice of a large bowl of soup or a small house  Caesar  or wedge salad with half a sandwich (Classic Turkey  BBQ Chicken  Roasted Turkey Cobb  Southwestern Chicken  Grilled Chicken Club  or California Chicken) and your choice of crispy-thin or wedge-cut seasoned fries. Today's pick was a small house salad  Classic Turkey sandwich  and crispy-thin seasoned fries. The portion is just right to keep you fired up for the rest of your work day. Thumbs up with 5 stars!
Belinda M.,Orange  CA,6,141,,11/12/2014,2.0,"We came for dinner a few weeks ago and it was good. Service was great  food was good  the ambiance was nice (we came early  so wasn\'t crowded or too noisy  until we left. The only real complaint we had was  how can you call yourself a \'Brewhouse\' and then run out of one of your advertised  ""special"" brews? On Friday afternoon? Really? Were you out all night and the weekend too? There should be better planning involved with these \'specials~seasonal\' type brews. That\'s all. Nothing terrible  but nothing special. Maybe we\'ll be back  maybe not."
Lily T.,Los Angeles  CA,967,527,2726,6/21/2011,4.0,I don't know about other BJ's  but this one has great service! I've been here multiple times and every trip has been pretty consistent. I came here the other day with a couple of co-workers for lunch and the wait wasn't bad at all. They have decent lunch menu  which is less pricier than their regular menu. I had the chicken parmigiana and their chocolate chip pazookie. Chicken pamigiana was good and a good portion  not too heavy if you don't plan on finishing the whole thing right before you go back to work. The pazookie is always delicious and just the right amount of cookie and ice cream! :) Our waitress was very attentive and always refilled our drinks and even gave my co-worker a second order for free because she made a super minor mistake on her original order. We all left happy and full :)Oh  and their happy hour is not bad either. Starts at 10 pm  $5 mini pizzas! Yumm :)
Tiffany Y.,South Pasadena  CA,50,45,9,11/29/2014,3.0,I've been a customer at BJ's many times since it opened  but I cannot remember the last time I had great service. Our food usually takes entirely too long to be served and we are usually missing a part of our order! I come here regardless because I love the deep dish pizza and pizookies. My favorites include the great white pizza and the original chocolate chip pizookie. Don't forget to mention your birthday! You'll receive a free pizookie. Keep your eye out for the 2 for 25 deal! You receive two soups or salads  a large pizza  and a pizookie to share for $25. The pizza alone is regularly $25!
Rebecca H.,Anaheim  CA,63,56,13,4/5/2013,4.0,My first time at BJ's- pretty good experience! I came with 2 friends at 6:00 on a Friday. Oops. It was super crowded! But what did we expect  really?If you want you can try your luck finding a table in the bar in the back. We put our name down and also went to scope it out. After about 30 minutes we finally claimed a table. (Our buzzer thing hadn't even buzzed yet  so it might be a good idea to do both if it's very crowded and if your group isn't too big.)It was still happy hour when we went(pretty decent times- until 7pm on Fridays)  so we got a great deal on our food. I got the Happy Hour Wings  Angus sliders and the three of us shared the calamari appetizer (not on the happy hour menu). I also ordered the strawberry mojito.Everything was very good and I loved that I was able to get variety with the happy hour prices. The best part was the service. Bonnie served us that night and was very kind. She made sure we were taken care of and I was never frustrated with the service. We waited for a bit in the beginning but after the initial wait  our food came in a timely manner!Next time I'll try the pizza because that's what they're known for (says my friend).
P B.,Irvine  CA,143,11,67,4/5/2014,1.0,"Sorry for the novel  but I\'m pretty upset. This was not my first visit to BJ\'s  but it may very well be my last. Our party of 7 arrived at 5:10pm on a Saturday  and were promptly seated at 5:13. After we browsed the menu for 2 or 3 minutes  I was expecting our server to come by and introduce himself/herself to us and possibly offer to place our drink order. The dinner rush had not yet started  and I noticed that a group of servers were seated  chatting  at one of the empty tables on the other side of the patio. The diners that were seated around us were either eating or their food had just arrived  but none of those servers seemed to look in our direction. After waiting over 10 minutes  our server STILL had not come over...not even to tell us that he/she would be right back or to apologize for the wait! I was getting pretty impatient  so I decided to try to catch the eye of any servers/managers walking by. Finally  the hostess who had seated us saw my pointed stare and asked if we\'d been helped yet. I replied  ""Not at all!"" And she promptly went to retrieve our server who had been MIA for so long. By the time Jessica came to our table  I was able to give her our entire order (including drinks and appetizers)  and the 4 kids in our party had finished the entire activity/coloring menu. She whisked our menus away  and promised to place our orders right away. I was starting to get pretty thirsty  so I was hoping she would bring our drinks out right away. We saw her come back to our area multiple times to check on her only other table  but every single time  she did not have anything for us. Tables that were seated AFTER us recieved their pitchers of beer  sodas  and even appetizers  while we were left to sit and watch as the other patrons finished up their meals and ordered dessert. We did not receive our drinks until 5:45!! I have never been to any restaurant  whether busy or not  where I had to wait THIRTY MINUTES for mere tap water. It was ridiculous!! Jessica seemed very concerned about taking care of her other table however  and came to check up on them often! We did not get the same quality of service unfortunately  and when our food finally arrived (on her third trip to our table in an hour)  she had accidentally ordered a kids chicken dinner instead of the kids chicken pasta. Our pizza was lukewarm and our fries were limp. Tables that had been seated after us had finished eating and had left. The dinner rush was now in full swing  and the hostesses were coming by to look at our table  probably wondering why we were still sitting there  taking up space. I let it go because I was starving  and we had a mediocre meal. When it came time to pay for dinner  I had 3 gift cards. One had $50  one had $25  and one had $15. (I always write the gift amounts on the front of each card). Jessica came back with our bill and said the card with $25 had $25 on it  but the one that was supposed to have $15 only had $10  and the card with $50 had $0 left!! I was shocked  but she didn\'t bring me my 3 cards back so I can double check their card numbers against the balance slips she brought over. I asked another server to kindly return our gift cards with my writing on them  but she came back to our table saying Jessica said they were gone and they could give me 3 empty gift cards in return. Wow! Why do I need empty gift cards? I sincerely hope Jessica was brand new  but because of tonight\'s ruined dinner  I have 799 Premier Rewards Points and I don\'t think I\'m going to make it to 800. This was the WORST BJ\'s experience I\'ve ever had  and probably the worst dining experience of my life."
Aaron V.,Anaheim  CA,158,3,,5/2/2013,5.0,Great Happy Hour  Great Beers (especially te Jeremiah Red  Nutty Brewnette and Tatonka Stout!)  and a great option for a more family friendly restaurant with good prices and sports on all T.V.'s.I would recomend call ahead seating for weekend nights and booking events early since this is the place to host your events in Irvine at a reasonable price for a quality experience.Servers and Bartenders like James  Bradi  Dale  and especially Caitin take hospitaliyand proffessionalism to the next level. I'll b a staple in this building as long as they keep doing what they do.They are also very involved in the local community  supporting many schools and community events through their volunteers and charity work  plus every Pizookie purchase earns a donation to the Cystic Firbrosis foundation.I love this place!
Joseph T.,Irvine  CA,221,57,10,8/25/2012,3.0,Good service and food is what you expect of BJs  however my friend ordered a Jeremiah Red and it did not taste right. There may have been something funky going on with the taps that day. Overall not a bad experience  just not spectacular.
Crystal N.,Los Angeles  CA,661,177,271,7/19/2010,3.0,"Never thought I would have to begin a review with a memory like this one but I cannot believe how my night here at BJ\'s ended and trust me  you would have never guessed it.I ended my night here helping a 6-year old little girl with a bleeding nose in the restroom. I couldn\'t find her parents and she refused to leave the restroom to find them with me. There\'s a time when it\'s good to be Miss Independent but not when you\'re 6-years-old AND with a bleeding nose  babygirl! Anyway  so that was the bloody highlight of my night. Other than that  the food was just mediocre and of course  overpriced just like the many other American chained restaurants. We started off with a flatbread pizza. The fresh basil with italian sausage sounded amazing but it was the biggest let down ever. I was able to count only 10 little booger sized ""sausages"" with watery tomatoes toppled on the ""flatbread"" with a pathetic amount of cheese.What saved the flatbread pizza was their Crispy Calamari. It went perfectly with the pitcher of beer the waiter recommended to us. Onto main course: the Southwestern Deep Dish Pizza. It was supposedly one of BJ\'s favorites. To me  it did not taste anything special. The chicken was too dry and I could barely taste anything but random bursts of spice that wasn\'t too impressive. The whole time i was munching  i was craving for a BBQ Chicken Pizza from CPK!Then came the mouth watering dish titled Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta. Eh? The waiter claimed that was his favorite dish. Umm  does BJ\'s pay waiters commission now? I did not taste anything in the pasta but was quite impressed by how plumped  juicy and fresh looking frozen shrimps could be.I left stuffed however. 200% carboOVERload. If only I was signed up to run a marathon the next day  I\'d feel slightly better.Overall  I have to give props to the waiter. He was quite attentive and quick with what we needed.Before I left  I went to check up on the little girl. She was still there pinching her nose. You go girl  handle that nose like the independent woman you already are at age 6. BJ needs to give that girl a complimentary pizooki!"
Justina W.,San Gabriel  CA,2,27,1,1/5/2015,4.0,Came here for a friends birthday dinner. The food and drinks were yummy. We ordered a variety of pizzas and appetizers. The service was okay. They seemed annoyed by us because we were a big party.
Andy L.,Anaheim  CA,166,190,101,6/18/2013,4.0,It was on a father's day that me and some friends  and acquaintances came here to eat lunch- late lunch actually.The parking was plenty but it was packed when we arrived  so we had to wait a lil while. Since we reserved for the occasion  we were seated on time. By the way  it was for a couple of dozens so they had to send us in the very back  outside  in the corner where wall fan is not accessible. It was so hot  and I was perspiring the whole time. As for the food  we had the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo  it was so plain and simple  yet creamy and tasty. We also had the baked chicken with mashed potato  and streamed broccoli on the side. The chicken was so tender  I really liked it. One of my friends commented on their mashed potato that it tasted like cream. I don't know if it was bad or good. To me  it was fine  it was creamy. The broccoli was perfect. We also had BJ's Classic Combo  Vegetarian  Mediterranean pizza and they were all great tasting  though they weren't exceptional. As for the appetizers  we had the Avocado Egg Rolls and it was fabulous. The Mozzarella Sticks were so chewy I couldn't chew em  but it was fantastic. I ordered pink lemonade  it was so refreshing. I also tried their strawberry lemonade  and it was even more refreshing  it tasted like fresh and it was sooo sweet. I also had the BJ's Famous Pizookie  freshly baked cookie topped with ice cream- it was delicious  but I couldn't finish it.The customer service was phenomenal. The staffs really were so busy and overwhelmed  I could tell. There were just couple of flaws like I asked for water no ice  and it took them forever to get me one so I had to request it again. The brochure for their beer weren't given to us in an appropriate time manner  as requested.Nevertheless  the place was huge  their menus were amazing  the service was remarkable.
Em H.,Yorba Linda  CA,8,65,,12/7/2013,3.0,Pros: service was great! We were a table of 16 and let me just say that our waiter did an excellent job. He was busting his ass and that's the reason we gave him a $150 tip. Cons: food was okay. A little greasy but not terrible. The main reason I'm giving it only 3 stars is because of our time limit. 2 hours maximum. Really? We racked up a $800 bill...we could have kept going! I felt a little rushed and had to chug my $10 glass of wine. Wine isn't meant to be chugged! Had I known we were going to be timed  I would have chosen a different place. All in all  it was a great time....I just won't be back with a large party because of the time limit.
Dee K.,Los Angeles  CA,1167,18,8,6/28/2014,4.0,Server was great  food was a little salty in my opinion  i got to Lemon thyme chicken with the Brussels sprouts and brown rice. After my table tried the chocolate chip and cookies and cream pazookie. I loved the chocolate chip cookie one! The cookies and cream was okay. Other than that  I love bj's for the various choices they give you! Definitely a good place to have a party or celebration.
George P.,Santa Ana  CA,0,5,,2/4/2015,2.0,We've been coming here since it opened and recently the food quality and delivery has been terrible. Yesterday  one diner got fish and chips. We couldn't find any fish within the breading. Huge pieces of breading with no substance. Plus  it arrived medium warm with cool wedge cut fries. After waiting another five minutes the Southern Fried Chicken special arrived nicely hot  but the chicken breast was tiny. The chicken in a Chik-fil-a sandwich would have been bigger and more satisfying. BJ's used to have a great chicken marsala dish but deleted it from their menu. Maybe we'll go back if they bring back chicken marsala. Very disappointed. Still hungry.A Taps brewpub is going up nearby  seems like it will be more expensive than BJ's but hopefully it will be more satisfying.
Crystal W.,Aurora  CO,0,37,,12/17/2015,3.0,Beer was okay. I've had better brews  but they make their own so... Food was okay. Nothing to write home about. My mom ordered a pizza and raved about it  so she really liked it.
Lin D.,Westminster  CA,43,33,1,4/9/2015,4.0,Wait was supposed to be 40 minutes - only waited 15 - good start - started with the ahi poke appetizer - the slaw underneath had flavor but the poke really did not - WILL NOT ORDER THAT AGAIN - my partner ordered the pot stickers - soft on top crisp bottom very good and he really liked the dipping sauce - a little sweet for my taste  for main meal I ordered the bison burger with the blue cheese topping  apple wood bacon - special order as that is not on the menu with bison but they obliged - ordered it rare - came that way and VERY flavorful  wedge fries thick and tasty - partner ordered the pulled pork with BBQ sauce on a whole wheat bun - stated it was excellent - did not taste as this is NOT in my flavor wheelhouse - he had the house cream soda said it was excellent - not too sweet - no dessert - nice atmosphere - well decorated - wait staff is confusing as at least 7 different people did something for us which keeps table clean and service crisp but u do not know who to ask for anything specific - WILL GO BACK to try a few more items - bill was less than $50 for 2 apps  2 meals and 2 soft drinks - NOT BAD BJ.
Kelly J.,Irvine  CA,65,6,,10/22/2012,2.0,We've been coming to this BJ's for several years now  once and awhile we had some bad service but overall things were good and it was one of the best BJ's we had been to. However  lately it seems like this place has gone down hill. The service has been consistently bad -- bad attitudes  long wait times  dirty tables and or silverware  and you're just kind of made to feel like you don't really matter and the staff is annoyed that they work there. The food has been pretty bad the last few times also. We were just there on Saturday and I ordered the chili giant potato  when it came out it smelled kind of funky and then I found a long  tubular  weird thing in the potato that looked like it had grown inside. After I took it out there was hardly any actual potato left. You could also see where it started on the outside of the potato and looked like there was possibly dirt on all the gross part.. It was pretty much a rotten potato that they cut into and put chilli on top of... so gross! After letting the server know  the manager came and was pretty patronizing and said oh you just saw a little black right? And was getting ready to explain how potatoes have dark marks  etc. No. It was straight up a rotten potato and I didn't even get an apology from him or anyone! They did take it off the bill and asked if I wanted something else  but no I wanted to barf after that.Can't believe that the cook would see that (he had to have seen it) and send it out  I could've gotten really sick and after thinking about it we had gotten sick the last time we ate there but thought it was something else. I'm just blown away that I didn't get an apology and no one was even a little bit remorseful about the situation except for me for the fact that I went there. Also  my daughter's macaroni and cheese looked like it had been sitting out for awhile when it came (and it's not the first time it had come out like that) so just totally over this place and if I ever return it won't be for a very  very long time.
Jean L.,Chicago  IL,428,704,1105,5/4/2011,3.0,mmmm.. not terrible  not great.They have a nice happy hour  but nothing super impressive.I would pick Yardhouse's Happy hour over BJ's any day.The food (in general) isn't terrible  but really nothing too impressive. In fact m I wouldn't pay full price for anything ( I only go for lunch and happy hour) because I truly don't think it is worth it.My favorite part  though? Great lunch specials...and even beer specials during lunch!!! (they used to advertise this much more than they do now).
Garrett M.,Huntington Beach  CA,34,43,8,8/27/2012,1.0,I go to BJ's for their Pizza. And unfortunately I will never be going back. Yes  those are harsh words  but when something is good  you don't change it; BJ's doesn't seem to think so. Let me explain  I ate at BJ's 8/26/12 and their pizza tasted disgusting. Literally. After some research  I come to realize that their corporate headquarters chose to switch to a premade  partially baked crust just the week before. LET ME CLARIFY  THE CRUST IS ALREADY COOKED AND TASTES LIKE CRAP. Better yet  their executive chef who was responsible for the crust actually quit his job last week because corporate made this switch. Those are the facts  I urge you to go try the new pizza. Personally  I'm not going back until they go back to the old crust. Until then  Selmas pizza it is!
Chris C.,Aliso Viejo  CA,8,79,5,9/23/2014,2.0,Not a bad place to go for drinks and appetizers after work but boy they really hover over you and try to hustle you out of the joint  well before closing. Had half a plate of appetizer left and over 45 minutes before closing and the server was so insistent on getting the check paid and getting out of here it was really obnoxious. When I used to wait tables that would never have been accepted.
Andrea S.,Costa Mesa  CA,12,11,,12/17/2014,1.0,"Waited an hour to be seated granted it was 9 of us but they ""couldn\'t"" make reservations when we called days ahead. Then we are seated rudely letting us know only 2 hours and can\'t split checks  we didn\'t get enough waters asked multiple times then one girl never gets her food after oh it\'s coming right now shpeal. Just overall horrible service on that night. Never again"
Katie C.,Irvine  CA,141,11,,2/13/2015,5.0,I love this location! My husband and I go here all the time. The menus is great but we've always had a great experience with all our servers. The wait- even when packed- isn't ever as long as expected and the app makes is easy to reserve a table ahead of time so you don't waste a lot of time standing at the front. We love the happy hour in particular. The pricing is great and the vibe is much more relaxed. The restaurant is clean and well-ventilated. I hate coming home smelling like the restaurant and I don't have that problem here. The menu is great for people that like options but can be a little much If you're indecisive! Plus  who doesn't love a pizookie?!? Would definitely recommend this location!
Farah R.,Irvine  CA,47,34,2,10/25/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Wow. Once again we came here and they changed 3 servers on us!!! Waited for a clam chowder for 15 min and my husband asked for a refill 3 times. It is nice that the G manager contacted me (I just saw his note here).
S S.,Marina del Rey  CA,279,61,3,9/13/2013,4.0,Pizookie is amazing. The best part of this place.Food is average nothing special. Good selection of beers. Fun to come watch a game. Great for families especially with kids
Robert L.,Foster City  CA,6,74,,5/31/2013,2.0,BJ's is within walking distance from my house  but I never come here because... well  it's a chain sit-down American restaurant  which I normally avoid  they specialize in beer  which I don't drink  and they supposedly have great deep dish pizza  which I think is terrible. One random weekday night last week however  we couldn't find anything to eat that was open so we decided to give BJ's another try.It's hard to find something to order when everything on the menu has like 2000 calories  so eventually I ordered this weird bento-box thing that came with sliders  an avocado eggroll  salad  and fries (there was no calorie count on this item). It took 35 minutes to get my order! That must explain why my food was cold. The sliders were possibly the worst I've ever had -- the beef was super dry  overcooked  and there was no flavor or sauce of any kind. The fries would have been good had they been hot  but the avocado eggroll's skin tasted like tree bark. We did get a pizookie at the end which was decent and the reason I'm giving 2 stars  but not as good as I remembered. I can make a better pizookie at home with store-bought cookie dough.
Mike F.,Orange  CA,0,28,,1/19/2015,4.0,Very close to giving them 5 stars  as good as most of the food is  every meal has had some sort of little glitch  item we didn't like  item we like gone  plus the overall this is NOT an inexpensive place to dine out  so BJ's has to stay in our treat category.The have some of our favorite drinks  lots of soda options and specialty drinks.The have several appetizers and side dishes we really like as well  but we haven't settled on any entrees we are 100% with.
Noel H.,Tustin  CA,61,25,9,6/14/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Gave BJs another chance. Sat on the patio because inside was freezing. This time  we had a big table. But again  the service was terrible. We asked for silverware setups and went 10 minutes without them. We had to walk over to an empty neighboring table to get some. Server kept forgetting things and was stretched way too thin. I asked for the salad to be chopped and he forgot. He was running around like a chicken with his head cutoff. The servers here always seem to have too many tables and too much on their plate. The managers need to find a way to improve service at this location because it is just unacceptable very time we go. Also  some things are overpriced. We feel bad with spending so much money there and leave feeling terrible with what we got for that money. Such a shame.
Trang B.,Los Angeles  CA,263,175,190,5/14/2011,3.0,Probably more of a 3.5  but the price is WAY too steep for what it is.Deep dish pizza--okay. I get mixed feelings about BJ's stuff. Sometimes  it comes out piping hot. Other times  slightly warm and very greasy. So overall  their pizza is just o-k  nothing to get too excited about. However  I do like the softness/fluffiness that deep dish brings. Try the Sweet Pig.Pastas: mediocre  really. Very basic  and no WOW factor. If you're gonna get something  the rotelli with cream sauce  grilled chicken  and broccoli is good. Chicken Parm is okay  too.Entrees: Chicken fried steak is my fave... But still not AMAZING. On their best nights  this is almost good.Drinks: strawberry lemonade is off and on. Sometimes  it's just a little too tart  and is hard to drink. Rootbeer float  delish. Beer sampler  always fun and probably the best part to BJ's.Dessert: WHITE CHOCOLATE MAC PIZOOKIE. No questions asked. Just do it.*Wait on a Friday night? Expect about an hour.*No reservations
Eric M.,Savoonga  AK,9,844,434,7/10/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,This review started as a two (2) star because we waited five (5) minutes just for no one to stop by and get us water. I had to walk up to the front and explain to the manager that free drinks were in order -- kinda funny because we both had water! Anyway  the server at the next station over took charge and was the BEST  hence the now five star rating.That other server should be branded with a hot iron and sent home tarred and feathered!
Derek H.,Cerritos  CA,76,27,,11/27/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,The food is simple  and nothing special  but the number one thing that changes this place  are the pizookie. Nothing could ever finish a meal so perfectly like that. It is the best desert of my life.
Drannab V.,Irvine  CA,3,114,18,6/23/2014,2.0,It's bar food  so I shouldn't expect much. The food was good  but service was inconsistent and the dishes was abso-freaking-lutely filthy. Sticky  slimey  spotted  and streaked cups  silverware  and plates. As a rule of thumb  if you can see dirt  there's bacteria. I didn't get sick  but I will be eating at a hobo's cardboard mansion before going back to this store.
David L.,Dublin  CA,142,177,,8/15/2014,3.0,The Margarita was delicious but overpriced and the small buffalo chicken pizza was enough to satisfy two guys on a Friday night. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. Nothing makes BJ's stand out from anywhere else though.
David P.,Los Angeles  CA,367,138,121,5/11/2012,2.0,Want to go deep? (TWSS)Must-haves: Pizza [B]  Pizookie [B]Skip: SaladBJs will give you deep with their deep dish pizza and slightly deep dish cookie also known as a pizookie.Typical BJ's. Nothing different. Gotta try the Pizza's and the Pizookie's. They are the reason why you go to BJ's.Service is below average  they took forever to seat us in an empty restaurant and our server was condescending when my friends were asking questions. Who does that???Food: B | Service: F | Selection: C | Experience: C- | Overall: D+
Jennifer T.,Irvine  CA,30,286,2,4/19/2013,5.0,Pizookie Pizookie Pizookie Pizookie!!!I'll definitely get this dessert every time I visit BJ'sGreat menu selection and prices are affordable.Dish sizes are pretty big  sometimes it's just too much food for 2 people.Waiters/waitresses are friendly and effecient. The restaurant is very clean and equipped with several TVs
Candice C.,Newport Beach  CA,1363,167,1440,8/19/2010,4.0,"I\'ve been coming to this location for 5 years. The hosting staff is always welcoming and accommodating  the servers are always on-point  helpful  and well-deserving of high gratuity  and the food is always served in a timely manner - and of course it\'s always delicious.When I was pregnant with my daughter (4yrs ago) I used to come here frequently for the deep dish pizza  and as I became a ""regular"" the staff started to note my habits  my regular orders  and were even more friendly and welcoming than usual - I loved that. It\'s always so nice to come in  and now that I come with my daughter it\'s nice to come in and see regular faces.My favorite dishes:- Avocado Egg Rolls- Chips & Salsa/Guacamole- BBQ Pizza- Buffalo Pizza- Asian Salad- BBQ Chopped Salad- BBQ Ribs- Oreo Pizookie- Oatmeal Raisin PizookieOf course  during football season  or any type of sports season - this is the place to be. The bartenders are always on-point during game season  and I love that it doesn\'t get too rowdy here.Doesn\'t matter who the bartender is - they always make great martinis here. I\'ve been to many other BJ\'s locations  but for some reason the bartenders here just do it right. I highly recommend having any of their specialties  or having a lemon drop  raspberry lemon drop  or dirty martini.Definitely come here if you love great food  excellent service  and an overall great dining experience."
Jim R.,Bellflower  CA,0,17,,12/26/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,These guys cannot get it right. Tonight a take out for 2 items (BJs favorite and Cobb salad) proved far too much for the BJs staff. I arrived as directed  only to be told I had a pineapple pizza and a Cobb salad. Rather than continue waiting for them to get it right  I just walked. You would be well advised to do the same and if you decide to visit this restaurant  then do not say you have not been warned.
Maria L.,Tustin  CA,0,43,20,3/13/2014,4.0,Entrees are pretty good but the best part is the selection of pizzookies! YUM!!! Servers are always super nice. It does get busy after work & if there's a playoff game. Better to call ahead for a table.
Jimmy P.,Irvine  CA,71,9,2,1/3/2013,3.0,Not really sure what I'm doing reviewing a major chain  but since I frequent this place much too often  I suppose I should give it some love. Generally I'm more in love with this place when its happy hour and not packed up the dickens. BJs used to carry the Dunkel which is still perhaps one of my favorite beers. If this beer comes back  ill bump my rating another star. Otherwise  cheap beers and plenty of appetizers  I really can't complain.
Chris C.,Washington  DC,625,473,249,2/4/2011,4.0,I've been to about 5 or 6 different BJ's locations  and this one is my favorite. It's a little more spacious than some of the newer ones they've built  and they also have a really large indoor patio area that can seat really large groups for birthdays and other celebrations. I've been here with a group of 25 people before and we only took up maybe 1/4 of the patio. I really like their house beer selection here  especially the Jeremiah Red and some of the other lighter ones. They have a beer sampler where you can try 8oz. glasses of four different beers in case you're not sure which one you'll like. As far as the food goes  I usually get one of their deep dish pizzas and end up splitting it with someone. It's probably the best deep dish pizza I've ever had at a chain restaurant. My two favorites are the great white and the buffalo chicken  which I think are two of their more popular ones. The fettucine alfredo is decent and so are their sandwiches  but I think the one thing BJ's does really well is the pizza. I also like the root beer floats!But the one thing that separates BJ's from the other similar chain restaurants in my opinion are their pizookies. An oversized  warm cookie with melted chocolate chips with scoops of ice cream piled on top...so delicious. I've come here just for dessert before just to have a pizookie  which is something I probably wouldn't do at almost any other restaurant. The service is hit or miss here  but i've had more good experiences than bad ones. One time the wait was so long that they actually started bringing out mini sample slices of their pizza for everyone that was waiting to be seated  which is certianly something you don't see every day and I thought it was a nice gesture.
Tam L.,Irvine  CA,93,339,1648,8/1/2010,5.0,I was in the mood for pasta so I took the risk and ordered their jambalaya chicken pasta and was pleasantly surprised that the pasta was cooked al dente and the chicken breast was cooked perfectly. Living in Irvine where most restaurants close by 9pm  BJ's is a great place for a late dinner without the wait.
Albert Y.,Garden Grove  CA,94,5,,9/21/2014,5.0,3 stars??? I don't know why people are complaining about the service. Service was great (I think her name was Carla) and the food was great like always. People need to eat a pizookie and chill out.
Hiep N.,Irvine  CA,94,481,565,6/23/2012,1.0,Bj's was good at one time but they have decided to reduce the level of service and the quality of the food preparation. When we arrived on a Saturday night for dinnerwe were greeted by our waiter. We ordered water  the traditional wings for an appetizer  and the BJs Favorite Pizza without onions for our dinner.The wings arrived and they were great. We enjoyed them and neatly stacked our side plates onto the platter indicating we were finished. We assumed the plates would be cleared in a timely manner.  This is where the evening took a turn for the worst. We waited and waited for our plated to be removed from the table. Our water glasses were empty  no one noticed or cared. Our waiter passed by our table 15 times and the empty platter full of chicken wing bones  and side plates remained uncleared. Finally  a busboy cleared our appetizer plates 25 minutes after we finished. This would be acceptable and tolerable if our waiter was busy or preoccupied. Instead our waiter was bantering with other coworkers. After the busboy finally removed our plates we waited another 10 minutes for our BJ's Favorite Pizza to arrive. When it arrived it arrived cold and with onions. We kindly asked the waiter to re-heat the pizza. We waited an additional 15 minutes for our pizza to arrive and it arrived luke warm. We grabbed a slice for each of us. Then flagged down our waiter  explained it was still cold and requested that he box it to go. The manager brought our to go box back to us and some what insulted my ethics. He stating the box of the pizza he was holding warm. I explained to him first of all the pizza arrived with onions when I ordered it without onions  and furthermore  the waiter removed the pizza from our table within 2 minutes of delivering it a second time with his bare hands. He didn't use the pot holders and that clearly indicated the pizza wasn't hot. The manager responded with the metal pan doesn't retain heat. His response was unprofessional and condescending. I wouldn't return to this location.
Nida A B.,Anaheim  CA,214,101,69,3/25/2013,4.0,can't go wrong with BJs! American food  so many options  and all in all great service! :)
Sergio A.,Irvine  CA,2,17,7,5/27/2013,3.0,Good beer  very average chain restaurant food. All the people that rave about bj's pizza or food  are your typical weekday frozen diners that don't know any better. Deep dish pizza?!... That shouldn't exist  if you want to try a real pizza try a Neapolitan pizza.
Alannah E.,San Diego  CA,137,67,169,4/17/2013,3.0,went here after a Disneyland trip. not my first time at a BJ's but my first time to the location. i'm a fan of their deep dish pizza  especially since no deep dish pizzas compare to Uno's Pizzaria in which the San Diego locations unfortunately closed ... anyways  i digress! the pizza is yummy  the cream soda and the orange cream soda are super tasty! the calamari is good. i also had their caprese salad. it was a nice  refreshing bite :) and what BJ's meal is complete without a pizookie!? pizookies are always good  no matter what time of day you're at the restaurant.
J. C.,Irvine  CA,16,202,1,4/13/2013,4.0,I've always liked their pizzas and their in house brewery but we were going to go next door to iHop for some breakfast and iHop was way too packed so we decided to see if BJ's had breakfast which to our amazement they did. I had their CA BJ'S scrambler and it was awesome!!! I chalk this good experience to maybe just not expecting anything great and getting something well great!!! If you want a good breakfast get the CA BJ'S scrambler with sour dough toast.
Daniel T.,Kailua-Kona  HI,0,8,2,12/5/2015,5.0,Ashley made the experience 5 star. Food and drinks were good  but service put it over the top. We had a large party and she took care of us  top notch.
Olivia G.,London  United Kingdom,98,46,22,8/3/2014,2.0,Really awful slow service. We waited 15 minutes for our order to be taken  another 15 for our 2 beers  another fifteen for our food  and it wasn't even busy. Food was OK  jambalaya was very greasy  but not terrible tasting. Fish and chips were OK  nothing special. We won't be back.
Kim N.,Orange County  CA,64,83,238,3/20/2014,5.0,My boyfriend and I have been coming here for happy hour on and off for the past year. Recently  we came across a very sweet waitress named Brittany. My boyfriend instantly liked her and I found that she was very attentive and good with customers. Today we witnessed something surprising and astonishing. We witnessed an act of kindness  something that I think is lacking in our society these days. My boyfriend and I entered the bar and found the last open table at about 6:05PM. A few moments later  a man came and looked around for an open table as well; there were none. He stood patiently against the wall and waited. Around the same time  Brittany had begun her shift and was walking around the tables introducing herself. Anyway  a table opened up about twenty minutes later; the man and another group from the other side of the bar got to the table at the same time. He generously gave the table up to them and went back to wait against the wall. I felt so bad for this guy and wanted hurry up and finish my meal so that I could give him our table but we were still waiting on some items to come out of the kitchen. Other waiters and employees walked back and forth  passing the man and ignoring him but Brittany noticed that he was still standing around and approached him. They talked for a minute and then she went to the front and had a few words with what looked like a manager. She came back to the man  directed him to the manager  and they sat him down in the main dining area. Brittany brought him the happy hour menu. Poor guy waited forty five minutes and made it just in time to order before happy hour was over. Props to Brittany for noticing him and helping him out. That was really awesome of her. My boyfriend and I were very moved by this and we honestly don't know if this happens often or not but we have never ever seen this take place before. I thought it was a really nice thing to do. Hell  it's almost midnight and I'm still shocked by the whole incident. FOOD: I love the mini buffalo chicken deep dish pizza and my boyfriend is obsessed with the avocado egg rolls. A friend of mine always orders the potato skins. Mmm. Both the deep dish and egg rolls are $6 during happy hour. They have some good deals going on at that time. Happy hour takes place between 3PM - 7PM (which is why I like BJ's...I get off of work at 6PM and by then  most places no longer have happy hour) from Sunday to Thursday. We will definitely be coming back again soon.
Nelson E.,Irvine  CA,0,23,,10/23/2015,2.0,"Had been a returning customer for many years when the food & service were always good. The last visits (other than takeout pizza that is still good but over priced) were bad on both ends  even just happy hour at the bar. Too bad because I do enjoy the wide selection of beers. On one occasion  not only did my wife\'s fish come out later than my meal  it came out raw. The first person I flagged down was a manager. We conveyed that we had a bad experience on our last visit and all we got was a quick ""well I get right on this"". I appreciate the urgency he showed but I guess I was just expecting a little more."
Joseph K.,Irvine  CA,94,29,20,7/5/2012,3.0,I frequent this place with my friends for pizza and beer. It's not spectacular  but it gets the job done. Great deep dish pizza and cool craft beers. I haven't explored much else on the menu  but their wings and chicken sandwiches are pretty good. Stop by for lunch specials  which are actually pretty good deals.Pros:-Pizza-Beer-TVs EVERYWHERE-Friendly staff-Open lateCons:-GREASY HIGH CALORIE FOOD-Joseph
Jennifer P.,Irvine  CA,0,23,,11/26/2014,4.0,Love this place! Service is always impeccable and super friendly here. Warm and friendly atmosphere.Pizookies are wayyyy too sweet to my liking  though. I'm always obsessed with the pizza here!Needs to work on making the dishes nice and hot when they're served!
Andrew B.,Irvine  CA,17,151,1,3/14/2013,2.0,It's a BJ's  so you should know what to expect. Stopped here on the way back from the airport  because it was one of the few places open late.Service was terrible  and the food was nothing more than OK. I mean  I can't say I won't be back  because it's quick  simple  and easy  but I won't go out of my way to eat here again.
Todd S.,Fountain Valley  CA,3,18,,10/18/2015,5.0,Had a great time this evening. Went to watch the baseball game and they changed the tv for me so I could watch the baseball game instead of the football games. The server did not rush us and always made sure we had refills. I always love going to BJs but never realized how great it was to watch sports too.
Amy L.,Irvine  CA,25,80,16,3/31/2012,5.0,This is one of my FAVORITE restaurants even though its a chain restaurant. Surprisingly my favorite things to order on the menu aren't the pizza dishes which is what everyone seems to love above everything else. Here's my top 3:(1) Medium rare rib-eye steak with crispy thin cut fries and a jumbo baked potato. Normally it comes with just sour cream and butter but my servers always gladly gives me a generous free side of cheese and bacon.(2) Any of their burgers!!! their HUGE and totally worth the money and they come with those crispy thin cut fries that i love so much as well. One of the newer additions  BJs bacon cheeseburger is a new favorite of mine. (3) Gourmet mac and cheese... I always loved mac and cheese so of course I always like to order this. 3 cheeses and bacon included with bread crumbs on top. Best of all  it's only 4 dollars... too good to be true.Did i mention how big their jumbo baked potatoes are?! There's probably loads of reviews on the pizookie already. Must save room for that.
Thomas E.,Orange  CA,0,1,,4/26/2014,5.0,A group of friends and I met at bjs yesterday. We didn't have a reservation but to our surprise they weren't super packed and the very friendly hostess seated us almost immediately on the patio. Brady and Devin took excellent care of us! We were pretty unorganized but they were super patient with us even though we were not in the dinning room. Our drinks were kept full and everything went smoothly even though some of my friends are pretty high maintainance! They even separated our check with a smile!Great service! Great food! I'll be back for sure!!
Seema R.,Irvine  CA,1,1,,4/27/2015,1.0,"We went for a late lunch little after 1PM on 4/24/15. It was not very busy. We ordered food and lemonade for drink. Food came but no drink. We could not locate our server so asked another server to find ours as we need our drinks with our food. They located her and she came apologizing with the drink. We needed a refill. Took us few minutes to locate her. We requested her to get us refill. 20 minutes passed. Neither refill nor our server came by. We again asked another server to help us locate our server or refill. Our server again showed up surprised  "" Oh  you did not receive your refill ???? Let me go get it.. "" This time drink a few sips of lemonade and all ice. We asked her to get us refill as it was only ice. Another 20 minutes passes  our food finished. No sight of server or refill. We again asked another server to help us get our check. Our server showed up and was again surprised   "" Oh  you did not receive your refill ????"" We were speechless. On the way back we asked at reception  "" Is it usual to get refill after the food finished ? "" We narrated our entire experience. BJsresponse thunderstruck us. They calmly replied  No its not usual. Sorry about that. Please come back again."
Bryan N.,Irvine  CA,11,43,111,10/11/2014,5.0,This is our go to place for weekend brunch and Sunday football. Food is good portion and prices are reasonable. My favorite beer is the Lindeman Framboise
Ming-Jou C.,Dallas  TX,1068,875,388,1/9/2010,3.0,Yeah  second BJ('s) of the week. The jokes are endless. First visit to this location  right on the corner of Jamboree and Irvine Blvd. Party of 1 and seated right away for lunch on a Saturday. 10 different games on the screens going on simultaneously  but I just ordered me up a Pirahna Pale Ale chili baked potato  stuck my nose in my People magazine  and munched away. My potato was definitely smaller than the ones from the Torrance location  but only by a little bit. Size does matter  even when it comes to potatoes.I've come to realize that the chili as a stand-alone meal/soup was probably not that good as it was a tad on the thin side  but as a topping on a baked tater  or on a burger (as I also saw on the menu)  I think it's muy simpatico. Service was fast and friendly. I realize $9 is maybe a lot to pay for one baked potato  but when you gotta have it  you just gotta have it.
Diana Y.,Irvine  CA,479,433,356,5/23/2012,4.0,It's your basic American fare  Pizza  burgers  sandwiches. I like that they have their own beer and the happy hour deals. Four stars for being close to my house so I can conveniently stumble home any time. Oh and their chicken wings are pretty good too.
Taylor R.,Irvine  CA,0,23,3,4/17/2015,1.0,I came in for dessert which was great. But our waitress was pretty horrible. Once she noticed we were only getting dessert she was extremely rude  didn't greet us  dropped the check off didn't say goodbye or thank you  actually she didn't say anything! Very rude. Didn't smile. Awful. Made the experience uncomfortable. She was a middle-aged woman working the evening shift and had a ribbon tied around her pony tail.
Danielle D.,Irvine  CA,120,328,146,2/7/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Silverware still had old dried up food on it. Absolutely disgusting. We asked to speak to management and management never came. food was good as usually luckily I ordered a pizza which is finger food and don't have to depend on the disgusting silverware they serve. It definitely makes me question if the back of the house is up to date with current Heath code. Really grosses me out and makes me question what is in my food!!!!
Peter P.,San Clemente  CA,0,9,2,10/7/2015,1.0,The WORST possible service. Not only is the whole hostess unplanned  but once you are actually given a table  the waiter is always slow and literally takes forever to show up. After this fiasco  you have to wait for much to long to actually get a drink. Plan for 35 minutes from arrival till you have a drink in your hand - at best
Riggz D.,Irvine  CA,0,3,,5/13/2014,1.0,Let's start off by saying  BJ's lives up to its name  it sucks dick. Most servers (in this location) are snobby  uneducated  selfish  and self entitled imbeciles. I cannot believe how careless they are about their customers. For instance  my girlfriend asked for Parmesan and ended up asking the hostess. How is that appropriate? Come on give me a damn break  Blow Jobs! How can you treat or let your servers commit to such atrocious behaviors? Maybe you should send them to server boot camp to actually hone their skills in serving customers properly not carelessly and idiotically. Another instance  I was there with my grandparents for their 70th anniversary for dinner. Our server took forever to take our orders and drinks. This server had curly blonde hair. After 20 minutes  she finally takes our order and by then my grandparents were very irritated. When the food came  I was very happy until I found a curly pubic-like hair on my fries. I was absolutely disgusted and it ruined my dinner with my grandparents.I honestly cannot stand this location. Just passing by it makes me vomit. Please close down or fix your staff because it's extremely negative for your business. I will never come back here again....hope the general manager reads this because it is urgent.
Brandon C.,Trabuco Canyon  CA,1,34,1,10/4/2014,4.0,This location represents what BJs is all about. Service was great  way better than the Rancho location which we stopped going to months ago...even though it is right down the street from our house. Ordered kids meals  chicken salad and a pizza. We went for lunch  the service was great and very attentive  even when it was getting busy. Finished our meal with pizookies and everything was great. The management and team training is far superior at this location compared to Rancho which is a total train wreck. This experience will bring us back to the BJs chain.
M M.,Irvine  CA,1,37,41,7/3/2010,5.0,What more can I say about a BJ's Pizookie besides it is a deep dish pan of incredible cookie goodness! I selected the original chocolate chunk Pizookie topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. The cookie was soft and chewy and oozed with milk chocolate chunks. The edges cripsy and chewy.The Pizookie is $5.95 and easily serves two (or one hungry Cookie Sleuth!). Peanut Butter  White Chocolate Macadamia Nut  and Oatmeal Raisin Pizookies are also available.

Yazeyn P.,Tustin  CA,0,2,,11/8/2014,5.0,Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo is delicious I love!!.. The Avocado egg rolls :D.... The whole thing is good :D.....
Allison M.,Huntington Beach  CA,0,3,,11/6/2014,4.0,Went in for dinner with friends. Our server seemed like a know it all but we made it through that and he was actually pretty attentive to us. The pizza is one of my favorites so keep it up. It was crowded but that's expected.
Courtney M.,Irvine  CA,1,13,1,4/9/2015,1.0,Tonight is just the straw that broke the camels back  as much as I love there food I am not going to spend the money if every time I go in I receive below average service. Last two times I have gone in I ordered an appetizer and yet again tonight  just like last time our entrees came before our appetizer. Then the server says I am sorry we can make it up w/ a free dessert and it took 15 minutes for the dessert that is supposed to fix the first mistake to come out. Worst part is the dessert tasted like it had been sitting Ready to go for a while  and the ice cream was basically a puddle. And lastly you think if the manager is notified the guests service has gone wrong he would make an effort to come over and apologize or make sure we are okay  but nope instead he just comped the cheaper dessert and left us to pay the more expensive one. Overall just so disappointed because there is nothing worse then loving a company's food but being drove away by continuous poor service!
Ann M.,Anaheim  CA,95,253,2,11/7/2012,2.0,I've eaten at BJ's - this location in particular - multiple times  but felt compelled to finally write a review after my last two experiences  one of which was last night. While I generally like BJ's food (don't come here for fine dining or anything exotic but for decent pizza and similar fare it's pretty good)  my last two experiences have been disappointing. About a month ago  my uncle and I came here for an early lunch. Despite the fact that we were among the first to arrive for lunch at about 11am  service was slow from the get go. Basically  the staff did not seem ready to start their day  let alone the impending lunch time rush. They were slow to offer even basic services (appropriate place settings at the table  refilling drinks  getting the check  etc) but the food was OK and we managed to have a decent meal despite the lackluster service.Last night  my boyfriend and I came here for dinner because his mom sent us a giftcard. Thankfully  the service was greatly improved from the last visit  but our pizza was awful (our appetizer and salads were ok). When we were presented with the pizza  it was obviously a rush job done by somehow who didn't care and/or wasn't paying attention because it just looked messy - the toppings (pineapple and pepperoni) were not added in anywhere close to even amounts and the distribution was completely uneven. Also  the pizza was little more than luke warm when it was served to us so it had obviously been left sitting and waiting because a pizza from the oven should at least be hot if served immediately. Furthermore  upon biting into the pizza  we both wondered if any sauce was even on the pizza. I pulled off my cheese and saw the tiniest bit of sauce in some of the crevices of the crust - it actually looked like someone put sauce on the dough and then wiped it off.  It was a disappointing visit and a waste of a gift card in my opinion. I'm unsure if I'll come back to this location again due to the spotty service and food quality. It's too bad because it's convenient.
Kevin L.,Fontana  CA,326,20,13,6/28/2014,3.0,"I like BJ\'s  but this place was just ""okay"" in terms of food. However  my review is based on just the food itself. Our waiter and waitress were very friendly  (though I wish that they had noticed my empty water cup more frequently) but they were very accommodating even though we came around 11 PM with a group of almost 10. Located in a nice area  maybe it was just that day that the food was just ""okay"""
Carlsbad Family F.,Carlsbad  CA,0,6,,2/18/2016,1.0,"Getting worse and worse every time we visit. First of all  the first time we ate here  we walked in at opening which was 11am; we were told to wait for a table. They did not want to sit people right away  all the tables were available  not until we ""heard"" the manager tell the hostess ""start sitting people at tables."" The next time we ate here  we arrived at 11am  we were told there are no servers available so we would have to sit at the bar area if we wanted to be served. Really? Then  I ordered the all you can eat soup & salad lunch special  I order a second bowl of tomato soup. The waitress tells me  ""sorry  we don\'t have any more soup ready  their making it in the back it\'ll be awhile."" This location of BJ\'s is unprofessional  not ready for customers when they open  they don\'t have what you order available  my husband and I will NEVER go back to BJ\'s on Jamboree Rd.  I predict in time this location will go out of business."
Kimberley H.,Laguna Hills  CA,21,171,19,11/18/2012,4.0,"This is a regular bar spot for me and some girlfriends  but this review is for a regular dinner I had last night with a friend.Our waitress was Ashley (I think? Blonde and under 21) and she was FANTASTIC. Personable  friendly  checked in with us on a regular basis without being annoying and really added to the experience (which is great to say because two very large groups on either side of the room began SCREAMING the ""happy birthday song"" repeatedly - so even with that annoyance  Ashley made it a really memorable dinner experience.THANK YOU ASHLEY! (I really hope that is your name  LOL)"
D M.,Chino Hills  CA,0,10,,8/22/2014,1.0,Worst customer service I've ever had . I went there at 6;00 n after waiting for 30 min The waitress didn't even greed me . After we got seated   the menu that I got was very greasy n oily . Waiting for 30 more min n nobody even stopped my our table or even offer water Seriously I will never go there again .
Liz O.,Anaheim  CA,0,5,,9/19/2015,1.0,Management is the worst. Horrible service. A few weeks ago I came in  the water glass was filthy and had all kinds of stuff floating in it. Last week my daughter and I came in for a bazooki and pizza  someone broke a glass in the patio and the server lead us to walk right over it. This week  we are watching the USC-Stanford game  they change the game on the 4th qtr and refuse to chage it back. Who does that? Terrible service too many times  not quite sure why I even came back today. Won't make that mistake again.
Elle C.,Irvine  CA,63,662,598,10/11/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Inconsistent service. Most of the time  it's been very pleasant; other times  we've been assigned inattentive servers. Our recent visit was very S-L-L-O-O-W-W! It wasn't busy (3 P.M.)  yet it took 1:15 to be checked on after our initial order was delivered. When I requested more water  my glass was only 1/4 filled. We've decided to hold off on returning to BJ's for a while.
Emily K.,Irvine  CA,274,13,2,7/25/2015,1.0,usually when I come here I don't have a bad word to say. however yesterday's visit was something I had to let off some steam because it still isn't sitting well with me. so my boyfriend and I came here for a late lunch around 3 and it was dead. we got seated pretty quickly so that was good. however no one brought us menus or took out drink order for at least 10-15 minutes. then after we order drinks it took another 10 minutes to receive them. then out waitress never came around to take out food order until much later. when she finally did she seemed really rushed even though it was practically empty. our food came out at an okay speed. not the fastest but nothing too extreme. our waitress came by once to ask how everything was we said it was good but asked for a glass of water. well she never returned with our water and after we finished we sat there for another 30 minutes waiting for our bill. we finally got so sick of waiting we put down some cash thinking it would more than cover it.food was good. but the service is what killed it for us. horrible wait staff. we couldn't even get a simple glass of water or even our bill. very subpar and disappointed overall
Shawn B.,Irvine  CA,17,114,24,12/31/2012,3.0,Went here for the first time ever on Christmas Eve with my very large and loud Chinese family. Probably the best way to try a ton of items off the menu all in one meal.... We started with calamari and spinach dip.... Meh. Wouldn't order them again there. Tried the BBQ chicken and Thai mango chicken salads (I think) which were good. The ribs were good. We got an all meat pizza and a BJ house special pizza I think and they were ok.... I wasn't a huge fan of the crust. We skipped dessert but my cousins swear by that cookie ice cream monster!
M L.,Irvine  CA,379,412,196,8/10/2012,4.0,I remember when I first heard of pizookies  I thought  what a stuuupid name. But I've fallen in love with them. I don't care how ridiculous it sounds. Nothing has me salivating like BJ's chocolate chip pizookie. Nothing.This is my hands down favorite dessert because it is so simple  yet so delicious. I just wish they served it with a glass of milk. If you don't know what it is  it is a fresh out of the oven  warm  gooey  giant chocolate chip cookie  with a couple scoops of french vanilla ice cream. The pizza here is pretty good too. Not Chicago style  but decent deep dish pizza. It is a little pricey though for what it is. It is a very light and fluffy pizza  rather than dense and thick. They charge a dollar for toppings on a mini pizza which is ridiculous. Because that's like 3 pepperonis  and 5 jalapenos for me. Minus one star because the servers here seem to constantly be on their period. More often than not  they are pretty bitchy and unpleasant.
Emilio G.,Santa Ana  CA,122,20,7,1/4/2012,2.0,"I have been a client of this particular location for many many years now  I have been here at dinner time  lunch time and brunch. I have been at this place waiting outside in the cold for over 45 minutes when they are slammed  I know quality and service at this place  that\'s why I have to give them this particular harsh review.THere are 2 things I like about my food  my food being fresh and I like asking questions about my food so that I can educate myself and the person who is waiting my table educates me  it is a give and take situation for me. I am very open minded and tolerant when it comes down to food  and since I have worked at waiting tables before  i know how difficult it could get. During my last visit  I noticed it was not very busy  not a lot of people eat out on a tuesday night. I had a great date at the Laguna play house and I thought I would close the date by having dinner in a place I knew and introduce my date to something she had never experienced  that went sour really fast. It took a very long time to get our drinks ordered and since my date was new to the place and BJ\'s brews their own beer  I asked the waitress to explain the differences of beer to my date  the flat out answer was "" beer is just beer  just darker colors"". I felt offended and I thought about leaving inmediately and ask for a manager but my date asked me not to. Next thing  was ordering an apetizer  I love the avocado egg rolls here  but that night  they came with ice  that\'s correct  you read correct  the sliced carrots that came with my hot egg rolls had Ice in them  when I asked where the ice came from  I was told it came from the freezer. I asked for my bill  got up and left. I ended up in tacos de anda in downtown santa ana that night eating burritos and drinking horchata and happy. I will never come back to this location on a tuesday night. I hope people who run this place train all of their staff to be poeple friendly and give proper explanations of the products they are serving."
Dom R.,Irvine  CA,0,1,1,8/16/2013,1.0,Worst BJ I've ever had! First of all my soup came out before our drinks. It was cold. Sent it back only to have cold soup in a burning hot bowl. Microwaved? Yeah probably. Then when we got our food  our server was no where to be found. I was scared to finish my drink knowing she may never return. Then the most important part. What the hell happened to BJ's pizza? I was expecting a thick crust pizza  not a piece of cardboard with toppings. Never again will I throw money away like that. Next time I want BJ'S ill stay home!
andrew c.,Englewood  NJ,0,19,2,7/10/2015,1.0,This place is garbage. The female blonde manager at the bar wouldnt accept a photo ID of my passport for a beer and didnt even glance at my ID. I have graying hair and some gray on my beard. Really? Also told the dumb manager I was Veteran. Will never go here again. Also the bartender kept brushing me off as if he didnt want to bother serving me and my wife. First and last experience for a restaraunt named after a wholesale supermarket. Pure garbage service. For my veteran brothers Do Not Waste Your Hard Earned Money Here! Blacklist! I will do all in my power to make sure nobody I know goes to this establishment!
She M.,Mission Viejo  CA,0,35,2,7/25/2014,4.0,Had happy hour there today. What a great way to end a very stressful week. The bar area has open seating and allows for both large and small groups. Great place for impromptu meet ups.
John M.,Orange  CA,0,8,,9/27/2015,5.0,OLU homecoming dinner was great for the kids and the bar food doe parents. The wings  pizza  and old fashion made the night very enjoyable for all.
Teresa P.,La Habra  CA,309,197,273,6/22/2010,3.0,Went here for a birthday dinner. Birthday girl was expecting 20 people. We got seated at two parallel tables in the back of the restaurant.11 people showed up at the reservation time. Birthday girl elected to hold off on ordering to see if some stragglers would show up. Our server repeatedly checked on her to see if she was ready to start. Finally  an hour later (in which only three more people had appeared)  he told her that he wasn't going to start taking orders until she gave the go ahead. Thankfully  she finally gave the go ahead.I paged through that thick menu over and over. I never found the secret cheaper menu.I ordered the parmesan chicken and a side cup of clam chowder. Our server was very cordial  and took the time to answer my questions about the soup. He even moved closer to me so he could make sure he heard what I was saying. He even smiled and said he liked the parm chicken  and that he usually felt sleepy after eating it. I really really liked him.Unfortunately  a few minutes later  he introduced his replacement  since his shift was ending. (Remember  we waited for an hour before ordering  not his fault). His replacement was indifferent. She brought the food and not much else.I saw other servers milling around  including one guy who looked perpetually surprised. He was fun to watch  until I realized that he just always looks that way  and that there wasn't anything continually surprising him.One of the girls from the other table came over and sat with us for a while  bringing her drink with her. The restaurant is so loud  I couldn't hear what she was saying. I ended up watching dads bring wayward kids out to the back walkway to burn off energy. (BJ's really needs a PlayPlace at the back of the restaurant).The chowder came very quickly. It was tasty  thick and meaty. Not too salty. I couldn't identify what they'd used to thicken it  though.The parm chicken also came quickly - shortly after I'd finished the soup. It was better than I thought it would be: two big flattened chicken breasts with a crispy golden parmesan coating. Served with a paltry amount of broccoli and a nice mound of white cheddar mashed potatoes. The lemon butter sauce under the chicken was quite tasty. I liked it a lot  but there was too way little of it. There was also too little of the grated cheese and tomatoes. Parts of my chicken tasted just a bit off.I ordered a pizookie to go. Because of this  our server held my table's check. Once one of the guys finally convinced our server to bring the check  I noticed that the drink of the girl who had joined us had been added to our bill  while remaining on the other table's check. It was a big hassle to get it removed. Our server brought another server  who didn't want to deal with taking it off and said she wasn't authorized to take it off. Eventually it got taken off.I needed a to go box. Our new server took initiative and brought two boxes for the couple who'd ordered pizza. She bypassed me completely. It was like pulling teeth to get service out of her. The couple ended up up using one box  so the server gave me the other.The pizookie to go was packaged with the warm cookie in a bag  and the ice cream in a cup  separate from the cookie.In short  food's okay  with large portions. Service varies from pretty good to awesomely awful. Food comes out quickly at least. This isn't a place I'd choose to visit  but if people want to celebrate here  I'll probably come.
Michelle M.,Aliso Viejo  CA,631,943,154,2/5/2012,3.0,Service here is really slow  even at 9pm at night! Other than that  this is a typical BJ's with beer and wonderful pizza that we all know and love!
Chris C.,Los Angeles  CA,3238,810,14322,9/10/2013,4.0,Have you ever heard of the infamous Pizookie? If not  then what planet are you from??The Pizookie is a fresh and warm baked cookie (white chocolate  macadamia nut  chocolate chip  etc.) topped with ice cream and served in a mini pizza style pan. BJ's Restaurants Inc. is credited for creating this mouthwatering dessert that most of us enjoy. Not to mention the fact that this restaurant and microbrewery chain (with over 130 locations nationwide) also creates some enticing entrees that makes me cringe as to whether I should be eating something with such high calorie content.The Irvine location is always packed in the late evenings because the city is such a quiet community  that everything closes before 10PM. I've never really had any issues with the service here  except that they do sometimes rush you since there's so much foot traffic waiting to be served. The only other problem is finding something to eat  meaning I categorize my decision based on - Should I eat something fattening or go with something healthy? And the word healthy in this case  isn't all that safe and sound as you think.HERE'S YOUR BJ* Pick your style of pizza (deep dish  flat bread  hand tossed  gluten free thin crust). They're known for creating some delectable pies and these are my favorites - California Club  Black & Bleu  Great White  and BJ's Favorite.* Appetizers - Spinach & Artichoke Dip  Avocado Egg Rolls.* Roasted Turkey Cobb Sandwich - Roasted turkey breast  tomatoes  avocado  Applewood smoked bacon  bleu cheese dressing  lettuce and Dijon mayonnaise. Served on a toasted garlic cheese French roll. Don't forget the pickles  potato wedges  and ranch dressing.* Fresh Atlantic Salmon - Flame Broiled or Blackened Salmon fillet served with Lemon Chardonnay butter sauce  rice pilaf  and steamed vegetables.* BJ's Brewhouse Blonde Shrimp - Lightly fried Panko Crusted butterflied shrimp (made with BJ's Brewhouse Blonde beer batter)  served with thin fries  creamy coleslaw  house made tartar and cocktail sauces.BJ'S AWARD WINNING  HAND CRAFTED BEERS* LightSwitch Lager  Brewmaster's Reserve Blonde Lager  Brewhouse Blonde  Harvest Hefeweizen  Piranha Pale Ale  Hopstorm IPA  Jeremiah Red  Nutty Brewnette  P.M. Porter  Tatonka Stout  Brewmaster's Reserve Imperial Red Ale  Annual Grand Cru  Oasis Amber  Nit Wit  Oktoberfest  Pumpkin Ale  Field Day IPA  Pook's Pilsner.PARMESAN CRUSTED CHICKENFor some strange reason  this dish always moonwalks onto my bill. Marinated chicken breast coated with Parmesan cheese and crunchy Panko bread crumbs  lightly pounded and pan fried till it's golden brown. Paired with white cheddar mashed potatoes  I add onion strings to replace the steamed broccoli. All topped with Lemon Chardonnay butter sauce  sun dried tomatoes  fresh basil  and Parmesan cheese. It's what I commonly refer to as - THE GAME CHANGER.
Kristin T.,Irvine  CA,0,8,,7/12/2015,1.0,"Servers were very friendly ""when you cld find one"". Order came out all wrong. Took them FOREVER to bring out the right stuff. I think they make their food at another location & ship it here!!!! Also manager is an idiot. She came to tell us sorry then comped us for a meal we never got!!! Why the heck wld I pay for a meal they never gave us!!!!"
Andrew M.,Los Angeles  CA,477,506,127,7/25/2010,4.0,Sure  it's not really a special restaurant. But after not going here since senior year of high school  I was enthusiastic about coming back.Service was fast and really attentive. My friend and I ordered a medium barbeque chicken pizza and it was every bit as good as I hoped. I actually liked it better than the pizzas I had at California Pizza Kitchen; I guess I just prefer deep dish pizzas more. The pizza was really fresh from the oven and the ingredients were all tasty. Pizookies are awesome! Try the mini trio to get a taste for variety.
Zul C.,Irvine  CA,12,4,2,9/8/2014,3.0,BJ's in Irivine feels pleasent and inviting when you first enter. You are greated warmly and attentively. So the people working here are great. The food here leaves me wanting. The several dishes I have tried here is not very tasty. Especially the pasta dishes.
Rick G.,Tustin  CA,0,6,,9/5/2015,3.0,BJ's is a nice place to go if you want to watch a game and have a couple of beers  or to just meet some friends for a get together. Will be back.
Herald L.,Irvine  CA,447,52,49,5/15/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,FEAR NOT. SHE HAS NOT LEFT US.My favorite waitress is still at BJ's (see previous post). Chalk it up to bad luck that we haven't seen her for months. She was pissed at me for the last post and she asked me to do a major edit  so per her request  I add the following:She NEVER slept on public couches while waiting to check in again.During the course of the Reno bender  she vomited in her own pants.Update over. Lemon  out.
Eric M.,San Diego  CA,41,69,24,1/29/2012,4.0,So BJ's has hundreds and hundreds of reviews  we all know what kind of place this is and what it brings to the table. The reason i feel the need to comment is this. Typically this is a three star place  my review is based on Happy Hour when mini pizzas are half off and beer is discounted.  Mini pizzas have the perfect amount of everything  i honestly think they taste way better than the full size pizza. They are a taste anomaly  they shouldn't be as good as they are. Yet they still manage to be mouth watering.  As far as beer goes  Jeremiah Red is a good one  my go to beer when at BJ's. A Pizookie is a must  its a fat kids dream haha.   So like i said  this a 4 stars only during happy hour when everything is discounted. Otherwise i usually tend to pass on it. On second thought  im giving the Pizookie 5 stars on its own. Those things are just damn delicious  lets go get one right now. Your buying.
Chloe H.,Tustin  CA,26,46,9,8/20/2015,2.0,This review is based off of one bad experience I have had here. My friends were already seated and had a drink/food order placed before I got there (I was just joining them for a drink)  the server came back around once I was seated and asked my friends how they were doing without even acknowledging a new person was at the table and I was sitting closest to the edge with no drink and an open menu (clue that maybe I want to order??) Well she started to walk away still without even acknowledging me! I had to flag her down and let her know I wanted to order  I understand she had a lot of tables but she didn't even let me speak before trying to walk away. Also once she walked away my friends mentioned she had quite the attitude which was very apparent! She had the attitude of she did not want to be working and was not trying to make our experience enjoyable. Before we were ready to leave we mentioned it to some woman who was walking around to tables (she was a fill in manager or from another location - cant remember exactly) and her solution was to offer us free dessert  which granted that was nice but we had said we were full and would pass  well she came around two more times trying to get us to take the free dessert! After multiple times of telling her no she finally brought the check and said she was sorry for our bad experience and that they had sent the server home (which they did - we saw her out in the parking lot). We were surprised she didn't comp anything off the bill as we didn't take the dessert. This wont stop me from coming back to BJ's in general but I will be avoiding this location from now on.
Capabel P.,Newport Beach  CA,32,68,1,5/1/2012,4.0,New to the area so tried out BJ's since it was close. There was a NBA game on so the house was packed. The wait for 2 was 30 min so we found a seat at the bar. Tiny seats  but no waiting so it's all good. Tried the beer sampler and it was really good. Then we ordered the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. I was surprised it came out in 10-15 min because there wasn't an empty seat in the house. The waitress was cool  but didn't bother bringing a spatula for the pizza. No big deal just dig in and grub. Pizza was really good and the thick crust was great. Needed a little extra sauce and although we asked for some it never arrived. Seems like the waitress was new so -1 star for that. Tired a pazuki (however you spell it) and it came out fast and was pretty good. I always enjoy BJ's and this new location was just as good as the rest. Hopefully I'll get a waitress that's on the ball next time!
Jamie W.,Marina del Rey  CA,679,957,356,6/2/2010,4.0,"We have this running joke at our house where every time I see something going out of business or a ""for lease"" sign up in RSM I always say  ""Hey... maybe they should put in a BJ\'s..."" Doesn\'t matter what it is either. I will stand by the idea that the under performing church on my street should be renovated into a BJ\'s immediately.We\'ve been going to this BJ\'s in particular since we moved to California. The food is always good  the service is decent and the prices are okay for a trendy brew house. My favorites are the Cobb salad  the chicken strips and of course any of the pizzas. The only things I don\'t care for is the parking situation and that it\'s always stupid busy (doesn\'t matter what time). Because of this I go the take out route once in a while. It\'s interesting that they put a Lazy Dog Cafe in the same parking lot. I\'m sure the people at BJ\'s were less than impressed  especially since it\'s half way decent. Anyway  I\'d probably weigh 500 lbs. if there were a BJ\'s within a stone\'s throw from my house so it\'s probably a good thing that we have to travel to get to one."
Fred B.,Glendale  CA,507,122,,11/20/2011,3.0,TIP: Iphone users - this BJ's is one of those special ones that has an app that you can download and reserve a table from the comfort of your home!  (I wish the BJ's near my house had this) We arrived on a Friday night  and were told there was a 40 minute wait. (Damn group of 45 ahead of us.. always makes things interesting) We were waiting next to the host check-in table when two ladies walked in and got seated immediately. Which made me ask questions right away! (Queue: Iphone app) We had some beers and a party platter pizooki. (Perfect for parties of 5 or more...) Our party of 3 killed the entire thing. I'm still licking my chops... Remember the Iphone App (Wonder if Siri can do that) and the Party Pizooki! TFR
Bryan D.,Newport Beach  CA,0,3,,7/5/2015,1.0,While I have loved every BJ's experience I've had up to this point  this was a pretty bad one. The hostess brought us to a booth that had syrup all over the seats  which I conveniently found out after I sat in it. After un-sticking myself from the booth and walking over with syrup all over the back side of my shorts and shirt to let them know  no one even apologized or seemed to care. As an employee in the restaurant industry  any classy establishment would have handled differently. If you don't want to deal with a rude  careless  and standoffish staff  there are plenty of other great options in the area.
Sarah H.,Yorba Linda  CA,2,26,3,1/3/2014,2.0,Honestly  this used to be my favorite place to eat in Irvine. Now I don't think I'll return. Last time I was there  the service was terrible  the restaurant was so loud that I couldn't hear my friend talk  and they had gotten rid of one of the few things I can eat there as a gluten-free person: the potato. The only things on the gluten-free dinner menu were ridiculously expensive. I ended up with an overpriced  mediocre steak. The server wouldn't work with me at all on my gluten-free diet restrictions. So disappointing.
Brian C.,Irvine  CA,38,122,24,8/22/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"went here saturday nite for my first nephew\'s birthday. it was a good dinner everything was great except for the dum expeditor brought our two pizzas to the wrong table next to us...i dont mind the mistake  we all make them  but upon hearing from the party that the pizzas were not theirs  she continued to let the pizza just sit there while laughing and talking up a storm about how the numbers got all mixed up.i mean  by all means  get the pizza off their table and to our table immediately. dont let it sit there while subjecting it to other customers\' and your saliva spray while in the meantime getting it a bit cooler. fortunately  that other party was a party of gentlemen and gentleladies they knew it was ours and just smiled and did not say much other than answer ""no"" to the expeditor\'s questions. so it was only the expeditor\'s saliva spray we had to worry about.however our server was a smart and quick guy. someone i suspect would be moving on to other better professional jobs and higher positions just on the basis of how he worked. unlike that ditzy expeditor; im sure she\'ll be retiring there."
Tiffany L.,Huntington Beach  CA,38,46,83,4/18/2014,5.0,I LOVE coming here. I always get the Irish Root beer made with BJ's root beer. Pizza is always amazing. Deep dish is hands down the best. I have eaten the Angel Hair Classico twice already and love it every time. Tonight I drank the Berry burst Cider (fruity and not too much). And always a must is getting a pazookie at the end of your meal. I got the mini  unless you are sharing  get the large.
ChickaPea P.,Newport Beach  CA,17,410,3,5/26/2014,1.0,bleh- what happened? I used to frequent this place last year but due to my work schedule haven't had a moment to swing by. Decided to order to-go during this holiday weekend and the pizza was awful! it was so soggy and oily and lacked flavor. I should have just ordered papa johns and saved the money. The only thing that was decent were the wings and dessert we ordered. VERY sad about the quality of pizza we received.
Anita D.,Huntington Beach  CA,52,187,65,6/14/2012,3.0,Plan on rushing in and out and focus solely on food and ordering if you come here. The service is very rude and impatient with a lot of forgetful  inexperienced staff members. Food is okay  just like Cheesecake factory with a huge menu selection  but not the best food quality.
Mabel T.,Irvine  CA,0,8,,7/27/2015,3.0,Bj's is falling thru the cracks. What used to be a good restaurant with a nice atmosphere is now becoming outdated with its eight page menu and appearance. But much worse then that is their lack of keeping there restrooms and dinning room clean.
David W.,Santa Ana  CA,22,44,63,11/7/2010,3.0,This was my first BJ experience and I was left a little disappointed. I figured since it's a brewhouse  I couldn't miss with a house beer. So I ordered their seasonal Pumpkin Ale and it was very mediocre  at best. My brother ordered their new IPA and he said it was poor. Even their porter  which the waitress obligingly switched it out for  was just fair. I sent my beer back and went with a Hoergaarden in the bottle because I knew it would be good and  in all fairness  they have a strong selection of excellent beers brewed by others.I ordered their Jambalaya for dinner. I have never been to Cajun country  so I can't compare BJ's to one from New Orleans but I can say it was the best Jambalaya I've ever had! The shrimp was cooked perfectly  with just a bit of crispiness but mostly tender. Of course  you can't go wrong with Andouille sausage and the chicken was blackened  which added a nice flavor. The vegetables were cooked down into a delicious  spicy sauce but not so much so as to become indistinguishable one from the other. The portion was generous enough that I took half home for lunch tomorrow.The servers were friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere was fun. I also had a great view of the football game. All-in-all  it was a fair experience  so I'll likely go for more BJs.
Ryan J.,Tustin  CA,0,1,,7/25/2015,5.0,This place has the best food I would come again.The server that you want to pick is glen he's the best
Sonia G.,Tustin  CA,29,18,1,12/23/2014,2.0,long wait time to be seated (all the time) & service is ridiculously slow! food is good  but not worth the wait.
Jannelle W.,Tustin  CA,33,25,13,11/24/2013,1.0,"This event happened a year ago  but I didn\'t notice that the review failed to post until now. What prompted me to post it after so long is the fact that this restaurant made me wait 45 minutes to process my payment  added back an item that was complimentary removed by the manager  and had the audacity to add gratuity after the server forgot to do so the first time he came by with the check. I went here for my close friend\'s 21st birthday party. This is by far the WORST dining experience I have regretfully not enjoyed. First of all  there was a hair in my avocado egg rolls. I politely told the sever  so they removed the item  and the manager brought out a new avocado egg roll. So that was perfectly fine. However  we asked to split the check for a party of 11. The server informed me they don\'t split checks for parties of 8 or more because it is ""easier for the servers."" I politely asked for it to still be split since I know it can be done. I waited 45 minutes for this split check to be done and charged. My boyfriend had to go to the hostess podium to request someone over to charge our checks. On top of all of this? The manager apparently charged the avocado egg rolls AGAIN after removing them on the previous check. Thank you to our server  Rob  for ruining my friend\'s 21st birthday."
Rama N.,Tustin  CA,111,39,15,8/10/2012,5.0,As a vegetarian I love going to places that have a whole slew of meatless options to choose from. My favorite item on the menu is the spinach/artichoke pizza and YES and they can make it for you on a gluten free crust (which tastes better than the real crust). For those that want options (especially large groups) this is a good place to go to.
Chris E.,Palo Alto  CA,38,10,9,8/21/2011,2.0,"We went for lunch this past Friday.I had the California Chicken Sandwich and it was yummy!So why the 2 star review? Because the service was crap. Crap I tell ya.The hostess was rude. And this wasn\'t isolated to us  I watched her interaction with everyone else that came in while we were waiting. ""Stand to the side"" got the same perplexed face from each guest she threw it at  but she\'s either socially clueless or just doesn\'t care because she used the same approach with everyone.And then there was our waitress. She was pleasant enough  but kinda clueless and definitely didn\'t care. I asked for one of the specialty drinks i saw on the sign in the entryway (the one we just waited in at the hand of the rude hostess). I remembered the ingredients but not the exact name. The waitress didn\'t know those drinks  which I suppose is forgivable  but instead of offering to go figure out which one I was talking about (there were only 3 on the sign) she just asked if I wanted something different. And then I ordered a salad instead of fries with my sandwich but it came out with fries. Also forgivable  except that the sandwich came out via a runner who quickly scurried off and the waitress didn\'t do the ""did everything come out ok? anything else I can get you?"" visit. With so many food options out there I can\'t imagine we\'ll be going back to BJ\'s  though I admit the Pizookie is tempting.BJ\'s = Meh."
J S.,Irvine  CA,86,399,11,5/26/2011,4.0,Beer is pretty good. I like the porter.  I also like the beers they have on tap  as they carry a couple of Belgian beers that I prefer.Service is very nice.  They are attentive servers and bartenders.They have a good happy hour.  I wish there were fewer people here  and they were open til 2AM.  Lazy Dog seems like a better place to go to for late night happy hour  and later closing hours.
Mary J.,Seattle  WA,407,169,230,3/24/2011,4.0,Food: 4 starsAll their Giant Stuffed Potatoes get a 5 stars--- huge  delicious  generous toppings.Avocado Egg Rolls: 6 stars out of 5 :) Rich and tastyPizookie: 4 stars Fresh hot deep dish chocolate chip cookie with scoops of vanilla ice cream. Mmm.Beer Selection: 4 starsService at this location: 2 starsI went to get a to-go order  which should take fast since I didn't need a table  I felt as though I had to jump through hoops to get the staff's attention. Hope the experience is better next time!
E D.,Orange  CA,2,11,,12/27/2013,1.0,If I didn't like the food so much I would never be back...the services is the worst I have ever had the last 3 times. First they offered me food that wasn't mine 3 separate times. I had to literally flag someone with my napkin to get the check. I asked for a refill  she filled the glass half up and never came back with more... food was good but the aggravation was not worth it... lazy dog here I come
Isadora T.,Garden Grove  CA,1,9,,1/5/2013,4.0,Steak nom nom nomAnd the potato fries and broccoli weren't bad either. Dined here for my brother's mission leave  he really enjoyed his pizzookie. Excellent service but was packed.
Shanna C.,Pasadena  CA,0,5,,9/13/2014,1.0,Horrible Service!!! The server didn't show up for 15 min after we had a table. And the District manager showed up and he was so rude... what's going on with these people? They are not ready for customers? He needs to learn what the basic service is..We will never come here again!!!
Steven C.,Santa Ana  CA,4,3,,3/19/2014,1.0,Rude waiter and asked for my burger with no pickle.. After telling my waiter he took it back to the kitchen and just removed the pickles from my burger. The bums still have pickle juice on it and yellow/green stains so I knew they just took the pickles out.. Honestly I would expect this service from a mom and pop burger stand not Bj's.. For this reason I prefer Lazy Dog's food and customer service!! Cheaper for better quality too..
Charlene P.,Irvine  CA,102,146,192,8/1/2009,3.0,"I\'ve been here so many times for birthdays/get-togethers/award ceremonies/going-away-parties/end-of-the-year-parties/socials/ice-breakers...But  I still don\'t know what the ""BJ"" in ""BJ\'s"" stands for. And  no. Not that.Anyways  what makes BJ\'s such a popular place for eating and meeting and mingling? I\'d say it\'s the atmosphere over the food. Lights are always dim (Yard-House-esque) giving off that sophisticated feel  there\'s a fairly good amount of room between tables  good accommodations for large groups/parties  there\'s a bar available (it is a brewery  isn\'t it?)  and  let\'s face it  these restaurants are EVERYWHERE!So  convenience comes to mind when I think of this place. So that\'s a good plus. But  as for the food...The last time I came here I had:Chips and Salsa -- DO NOT order this appetizer. The salsa\'s just too soupy and the chips tasted stale and way too salty. Save your tortilla chip cravings for Albatros.Mini Vegetarian Pizza -- A-OK. Not spectacular. If you\'re looking for a good selection of their deep dish pizzas  don\'t get the vegetarian. Try the buffalo chicken; trust me  it\'s a lot more flavorful. But  I guess for what it is  the veggie pizza here does fulfill its purpose and isn\'t too bad. It\'s a bit pricey though ($10 for a mini).Pizookie -- Tons of vanilla ice cream smacked on top of warm cookies of your choice (macadmia nut  oatmeal raisin  chocolate chip  etc). I think it\'s pretty good the first bite  but if you eat too much  you\'ll fall into a food coma faster than when you ate the deep dish pizzas. The ice cream is kinda whack -- I don\'t think it\'s real. But  try it out for a cool treat  if not for the novelty of the idea. At least they give it free for your birthday (if you tell them it\'s your birthday)!I also had a few bites of other entrees/appetizers  but nothing here has yet to impress my taste buds besides maybe the Avocado Rolls and the Buffalo Chicken pizza. Definitely give those a try.I think that I\'ll never escape BJ\'s  just because it\'s so convenient. But if I had a choice  I\'d save my $20.Oh  and service is all right. Pretty good at this location."
Michael T.,Reseda  CA,6,3,,8/5/2014,1.0,If it were possible to rate this restaurant 0 stars I would. This was Absolutely  hands-down the worst service I or my five co-workers have ever encountered! The server took our order twice  because she forgot. It looked like she was writing it down the second time  however  she mixed up individual orders  shrimp instead of chicken  the wrong kind of beer  and a forgotten beer for one guest. She forgot to place a food order for one guest all together which was delivered to the table after everyone else finished eating. She ignored multiple requests for drinks and water  then tried to make a joke and brought three waters to the one guest all at one time. This server took a desert order  forgot  again  and asked if we wanted desert a second time describing the deserts  once morel until we reminded her that she had already taken the order. She then told us that she had just been crying in the back and described to us her personal issues she was dealing with as an excuse for poor service. This story even included a Murder!!...Really? All of this while she continued to admit her horrible service  laughing  uncomfortably. Another water was served in a dirty glass. The water tasted sweet  as if there were a drink previously served in the same glass... Yukkk!!. At that point we asked for the manager who was less than apologetic. We started this evening asking for separate checks which also was forgotten by our server  who had to then take more time to separate our bills and comp our meals while we waited  when All we wanted to do was get the Hell out of there as fast as possible!!!!!
Kevin M.,Costa Mesa  CA,34,110,71,4/6/2012,3.0,VERY busy!! Happy that our friends used the BJ's app to get our table before we even left home. We walked in and only had to wait a minute or two to be seated. There were others still waiting  so the app worked GREAT!Our waitress was friendly and professional. We had an appropriate amount of time to chat amongst ourselves. Beer was delivered briskly. We split three small plates  Seared Ahi  Fried Artichoke hearts  and Stuffed Mushrooms. All very good! My wife and I split the the pasta dish and we still left a little.Solid performance for only our second visit. Though good  I'm not sure I'd wait too long for dinner there.
Lucy R.,Irvine  CA,0,1,,6/6/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Devin - Is an amazing person and server. We appreciate her great personality. We come to BJs often with our family and we have had the pleasure of Devin's consistent pleasant service with a smile every time... She also knows how to cater to family's and that helps makes dining with kids a much better experience. If you take care of any parents kids first and ensure their food comes out fast then the rest of the meal is good for the family. Also a great positive attitude is not something everyone has - it's either you have it or you don't and Devin is a shining star that helps us to want to come back to BJs. Thank you for great service !
Jackie K.,Kansas City  MO,3,45,8,6/4/2012,5.0,The only reason I am giving them a 5  instead of a 4  is because everytime they mess up my order (which is almost everytime)  they make up for it by taking it off my bill  or giving me an extra of whichever they messed up.I usually visit this particular BJs when I crave their Pizookie. Ive rarely had bad service  and the food is always good. Well  the pizza is always good. I have strayed off the pizza trail a hand full of times and was dissappointed. I do not like their pastas  sandwiches  or burgers. I usually stick to a buffalo chicken pizza  ceasar salad  and pizookie. ALWAYS AMAZING! Their Lightswitch beer is also quite tasty.
Melanie F.,Irvine  CA,15,14,,7/27/2011,1.0,Wow- I have finally reached my breaking point with BJ's in Irvine. If I could give it negative stars I would. We have dined here several times  and also ordered take out. AND every single time (with the exception of one time) the orders have been messed up. Our last time was this past Sunday night at 5:30pm. We were seated promptly with no wait. We brought a bottle of wine with us  since they now offer a no corkage fee on the first bottle. We were greeted pretty quickly  and when I asked for a wine chiller for my white wine she said she would be back in a minute with one. Well  5 minutes went by and she came back and said they were preparing it at the bar. At that point my husband order a beer. So the server promptly got his beer. When we asked about the wine chiller she now said that they didn't have any since the Restaurant only carries 2 wine chillers. WHAT? She just said they were preparing it?? Plus  what restaurant only carries two wine chillers? Obviously this one! So  at this point I just asked for a wine glass and some ice. She said she would be back with both. She never brought either  but instead came back 10 minutes later to take our appetizer order. At this point I had been sitting there for 20 minutes with no drink and a warm bottle of white wine. So I asked AGAIN for the wine glass and ice. She eventually brought the glass but not the ice. Really? Is this rocket science? I gave up on the ice. Then to top it off 40 minutes later the manager approached our table to tell us the server forgot to put our order in.....What?? At this point I really just wanted to leave  but decided since we were with my in laws to sit it out. Needless to say I will not be eating here again. This is the reason why I avoid chains. They lack service. They offered us free desserts  but in reality I have no problem paying for my food. I just want good service and a freaking wine chiller. In past take out experiences  they have left out the dipping sauce for my calamari  left our dressing for salads etc.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else like Bandera in CDM or Nicks in Laguna. They offer fantastic service  the same prices as BJ's  no corkage and plenty of wine chillers.
C C.,Tustin  CA,7,4,,4/18/2014,3.0,BJ's is always great for a quick bite...well not so quick if you're going on a Friday night. Use the call ahead seating option. Food here is decent but can't say it's great. I do like their pizza even though it's not the traditional NY style that I grew up eating.....If you like watching sports while eating  this is the place.
Rachel W.,Beverly Hills  CA,30,14,,6/12/2015,2.0,food is great beer is great but 2 nights ago I had the worst food poisoning from eating there ive ever gotten. not the best experience ever.
Coby J.,Aliso Viejo  CA,19,74,3,5/1/2012,5.0,Love this placeeverytime i come here i am satisfied. great food and service!
Paris N.,Irvine  CA,1,28,12,9/21/2014,1.0,"After a long day of studying and since we didn\'t have any food at home  my husband and I decided to go to BJ\'s for a late dinner. We ordered our drinks and an appetizer (fried calamari)  and our food. We waited almost 45 min before we called our waitress over to ask her why is it taking so long for our food. She said the kitchen messed up and she apologized and said they are making our food. She brought another fried calamari.40 mins went by and no food. We called her over again and we asked her about our food  she said "" what food""....OMG I could not believe what I was hearing. I asked her if she was on drugs because this was unreal. We only ate our appetizer (the first one  but we didn\'t touch the second one she brought) and to make the matter worst  the manager came over very unprofessional  and all he had to say was ""I came over to offer you guys a gift card"". I could not believe what was going on. Not even an apology. We just left without taking the gift card  mad and hungry. I hate this place and I would never go back to any BJ\'s restaurant ever again. No wonder they only got 3 stars. Honestly they deserve only one star."
Meg R.,Irvine  CA,410,558,322,1/5/2011,4.0,I actually like BJs. for this style restaurant theyre probably my favorite  like  over dave and busters and yard house. I think they have a great menu and im addicted to their balsamic chicken. mmmm its so good  prefectly cooked  juicy chicken with a sweet and tangy balsamic glaze  served with cheddar mashed potatoes and grilled onions as well as crispy onion strings. Not to mention the pizookie  have you tried one?? theyre awesome - hot  fresh cookies  with ice cream on top. parking can be a real pain in the ass here  but be persistent. Overall  good food. though i usually get it to go so no comment on the beer selection or interior.
Tobi U.,Santa Ana  CA,49,47,3,2/13/2014,4.0,We eat here a couple times a month. The service is always great. We never wait to long to get a table. We love the avocado eggrolls!! There the bomb!! Food is always great!! Price is always fair. It can be really loud sometimes!!
Dan G.,Irvine  CA,88,75,61,7/28/2012,4.0,I looooove BJ's!!! Hahaha!!! Always great food at the BJ's locations I've been to  and they have a great Happy Hour! I've tried loads of different items on their menu  and I can't say that I ever found one that I didn't like. I'm not a big drinker  but they brew some pretty tasty beers.Two thumbs up from this guy! Keep up the good work.
Katie L.,Irvine  CA,16,193,32,12/25/2011,5.0,This is a great place for birthday celebration! Especially when you make reservation to do their buffet. It's a great deal with tons of food. (All you can eat pizza  pasta and salad plus drinks!) I've been here for 2 family birthday celebration and I've been very happy both times. Hubby and I were just here a few days ago for family birthday party. Great service  great staff and kudos to the management! They went above and beyond to make sure all our needs are taken care of. That's rare when you have a big group of ppl. Great food + Service = I will be back!!!Plus they have Raspberry Fromboise on tap! yum!!!
Tamara M.,Orange County  CA,199,475,37,10/19/2011,2.0,Hadn't been to BJ's in a while because last time I was not happy with the quality of my food. This time we ordered the big nachos to share and it was basically a pile of chips. There was hardly any cheese or chili  etc. For $10 bucks or whatever I expect some loaded up nachos. Pumpkin beer was decent.
Mark R.,Tustin  CA,0,82,5,10/25/2014,2.0,"Most BJs are ""okay"". This one seems to be particularly busy  so you\'d think they\'d be prepared for that  but they are not. The quality suffers. The service is really not that good. For To Go orders  the wait is LONG. I\'ve also ordered from this BJs via delivery services. The delivery service typically gets a bad rap for the slow delivery - but  in the case of BJs Irvine  it is all BJs fault. So  dine elsewhere  or order elsewhere  at least until this BJs gets their act together and improves service. PLENTY of other (and better) choices."
Donna C.,Irvine  CA,2,48,,5/31/2011,4.0,Try their avacado eggrolls for an appetizer...I've been hooked ever since I first tasted it. Also  this place has really good Mediterranean pizza. It's very different from a traditional pizza  but it tastes delicious. Strawberry margaritas aren't too bad here either. Fun place at happy hour  and for a night out with friends. They're open pretty late  I think they close at midnight. Some of their hosts/hostesses need to work on being a little more attentive when you walk through the door that late. I was standing around for at least five minutes before anyone bothered to seat me...Some of the waiters/waitresses were trying their best to ignore us for some reason. Maybe they were just lazy or tired? Aside from that  this place has pretty good food  and the atmosphere has a modern edge to it. Very nice overall.
Christina F.,Santa Ana  CA,0,23,3,8/31/2014,2.0,I gave this location 2 stars only because I am a regular and 7 out of 10 times I have no issues with the food/service. It's definitely hit or miss and not always consistent. However  tonight I was extremely disappointed. I placed a pick up order at 12am at this location on a Saturday night. The man who took my order seemed winded but still very friendly considering the time of night. I usually try and avoid ordering from places shortly before they close but tonight I got off work late and I was exhausted  suffering from sciatica and not in the mood to cook. I work in food service so I mostly understand what goes through the kitchen staffs mind when they see an order placed an hour before closing which is why I kept it simple. Mini deep dish cheese and tomato only. My usual. My boyfriend picked it up for me and when I opened the box  there was a black film under the cheese that was caked onto the top of the pizza bread. This has happened before and always late night. I had previously assumed it was just burnt cheese but considering this only happens late night  I was irritated. All I wanted was my pizza. I was starving so I still ate it but I had to peel back the cheese and peel off the film. I get it  it's late and the staff wants to get all their pre-closing done but come on! If this film on my pizza is a result of just wanting to get out on time I'm really disappointed in the way management runs the kitchen. I still love their food but I'm probably going to find myself a different late night eatery.
Kaung K.,Rancho Santa Margarita  CA,17,6,,6/25/2012,4.0,"So I got invited to BJ\'s Restaurant & Brewhouse  Irvine to celebrate a friend\'s belated birthday. (Yes  I have friends and yes  I get invited to parties!)Environment: What can you say  it\'s in Irvine and at the Irvine Market Place so it is a pretty busy neighborhood with many stores and restaurants nearby. Which is a good thing by the way. I mean you don\'t want to go to a restaurant that is at a quiet dark corner yonder  do you? I don\'t think so! You don\'t have to worry about parking space either because there is a huge lot. I cannot guarantee you will find a spot but since I went there at night around 10 PM  there were many open spaces. It might or might not be the same for peak hours or ""day hours"".Service: The place is pretty packed even at that late hour! Both outside dining areas and inside are packed! I was just a ""visitor"" so the seat for us was already reserved (by walk in). I cannot really talk about the wait time to be seated (sorry!). But from what I\'ve observed while waiting for my food to come  out of starvation but without hallucinations from hunger  I noticed new customers were seated fairly quickly. Even a large group of 10-13 got seated within at max 5 minutes. So  I guess not much of a wait time. (Again  keep in mind I\'m talking about the late night hours).The waiters and waitresses are dressed in the BJ\'s nice uniforms; they all look formal more or less. I felt like eating at a high-class professional restaurant  except with some noises around from other tables. I mean what can I expect  right? Our orders were taken quickly and the waiter made sure we got everything we need by constantly checking up on us. Very nice staffs there! A waitress even helped put my leftover pizza I ordered larger size out of greed into a to-go box on my behalf! Thanks for that!Oh  the waiters (not sure about waitresses  and NO I am not checking out the guys - I don\'t swing that way) seem to have mood or Hawaiian or some sort of wrist bracelets. Maybe that\'s how they keep themselves all cheerful or how they cast yummy spells on the food they served! Who knows! It\'s a world full of wonders. Yup.Nobody said Thank You or Bye when I left though. I felt ignored. Somebody there owed me a hug! (Message me on here for preferences of the person who should give me a hug! Haha just kidding!)Food (Full Menu Here: bjsrestaurants.com/menu):They have varieties of food and drinks. Here  I am just going to talk about what we ordered  especially me (no  not being conceited). You can check out their menu in the link I posted above though! Prices are aright for everyone and the food served can be shared too because it\'s a good size for a nice price!Wine & Beer: We ordered wine and beer. I don\'t know what kind because I don\'t drink much and I always let people order for me or jump into the easy bandwagon while ordering by saying ""Same as her/him"". But wine we ordered was pretty good and satisfying  so were the beer few others ordered.Pizza: or PIZZA!!! I ordered their new Gourmet Five Meats (Housemade meatballs  pepperoni  oven roasted ham  salami  Italian sausage and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.) pizza small size. Trust me  small is still big considering they have ""mini"" size below it! It came with about 5-6 slices; you can actually check how many slices each size is composed of on their menu  so you can have a good estimate. (Menu in the restaurant for sure  not sure about the online one). It was delicious!!! You can taste the mixture of everything. You know  sometimes the taste of meat and toppings did not sink into the crust/bread so it\'s like eating them separately. But BJ\'s pizza  mmmm mmmm!!Oh I think you can special order birthday cakes and have celebration too. Check with BJ\'s if you do need one!Noise: Just the usual noise you always hear at the restaurants with bars attached. But it is nowhere half as loud as Yard House though!!! (Or Dave & Buster\'s)!!! I\'d say that\'s good.- Ko (Tweeper @KaungKo on Twitter)"
Sany N.,Chicago  IL,325,386,208,1/22/2013,4.0,Came here to watch the NFC Championship game and it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be. There were plenty of seats and lots of TVs. It was happy hour so we took advantage of their chicken wings deal. Their chicken wings are pretty darn delicious. Their pazookies are always winners. I prefer the original over any other flavor but the raspberry one was pretty delicious as well. The service was quick at the bar  and the server was attentive. I really liked this BJ's over the one i've been to in north SD.
Frances J.,Berlin  Germany,2,57,,1/28/2013,1.0,If you are reading this review and contemplating whether or not this BJ's is worth your time  let this review be the one to convince you not to waste your time. If you can find another restaurant  (which there are alot of in the surrounding area) please do so. If you are dying for BJ's  please go the extra mile and do not give this BJ's in Irvine your service. I am not giving a poor review on BJ's because of their food  but on their service. BJ's in Irvine HAS TERRIBLE SERVICE. DO NOT GO HERE.Our waitress BRANDY was obviously having a terrible day and was not paying attention to our table at all and was throwing back all types of attitude during our entire stay. Never in all of our lives has a waitress thrown her finger at us to tell us to wait (really?). WE ARE NOT DOGS. WE ARE NOT CHILDREN. WE ARE CUSTOMERS  PLEASE HAVE SOME RESPECT. That immediately was an EARLY indication that the service here was poor. For the rest of our time here  she didn't look us in the eye when speaking and again  was throwing all types of attitude. REGARDLESS of the terrible service  my companions & I remained calm and cordial. She gave us the check and forgot the pizooki (really?) and we waited another 20+ minutes to order  get the check revised  and get dessert. Way before the dessert reached our table  my mood had already gotten sour. We wanted to complain. All of my companions and I have worked in the food industry and have NEVER been treated like that nor have ever treated any of our customers like that in our life.A second waitress came  she was not too much of an improvement from Brandy. We asked for her name  and she just did not want to give it to us (really?). As we told her the situation from the previous waitress  it was so obvious that she was DESPERATE for us not to speak with the manager. Regardless  we are calling management soon to let them know of the situation in hopes that another group of people just trying to eat a meal does not have to suffer the same crappy service we did. I had higher expectations for this establishment and it let me down. BJ's in Irvine was a definite dissapointment. All I was trying to do was have a decent meal with companions in a chain I was familiar with. As I said earlier  if you are wanting BJ's badly  make the effort to eat at another BJ's...otherwise pick another restaurant in the surrounding area.
Jim B.,Orange  CA,0,4,,4/4/2015,1.0,Went there (Irvine) for dinner and asked for their creamy garlic salad dressing. Got some lame excuse why they do not have it anymore. The waitress needed to stop talking at that time. So we settled for a different dressing. Then we asked for her to bring some rolls with the salads before the Pizza. Then she said no rolls. We left the restaurant.
Nick D.,Anaheim  CA,10,4,4,6/7/2011,4.0,Its a cross between a loud sportsbar and cheesecake factory...The menu is extensive (like cheescake fac.) but you'll be lucky if you can hear yourself talking on a game night.Food is good esp. the pizza. Best beer is Jeremiah Red.Only negative is the wait..always 45 mins on fri or sat nite.
Danny Y.,Irvine  CA,302,42,1,7/11/2011,4.0,Great Pizza  Great Root Beer and Great Pizookies! Perpetually crowded  BJs is one of those places that my wife and I will always crave on a regular basis. This location surrounded by thousands of residential units give it a built in regular customer base. I can highly recommend their pizzas which are made with tastey crusts and grilled tomatoes. I always get garlic with any pizza to enhance the flavor and I am always happy with the quality of their pizzas.I also always order their hand crafted root beers  which they serve in a chilled mug  just like they would a cold beer.Finally  there are few better ways to end a meal than with a warm cookie topped with ice cream. The warm sweetness of the cookie go so well with the cold creaminess of the ice cream that I wonder why more restaurants don't copy this dessert.Always reliable  great food and great place to catch the game.
T P.,Orange County  CA,1,503,178,1/22/2015,5.0,My husband and I come here once every 2-3 weeks. We have a great time here. We prefer to sit in the bar because it's more casual. The service in the bar area is always positive. The servers are super attentive  friendly and they hustle. Our most recent trip was this past Sunday when we watched the Seahawks come back to beat the Packers. What an amazing game  huh?We ordered the spicy buffalo wings to start - awesome! Definitely recommend!!!! The drinks we had: bloody mary's  margarita's  strawberry mojitos . . . all delicious and fresh. I had the California Club flat bread and my husband had a chicken burger which he devoured. Both were amazing!BJ's is consistent: their employees are friendly  their food is always tasty and spot on  the drinks are perfectly made and the prices are great. Obviously  I recommend and will return. Great place to watch sports because there are many tv's  the noise level is perfect and the people are professional and you don't have to worry about a bar fight breaking out (okay  maybe over who gets the last chicken wing).Their happy hour is valid when games come on - great savings and many choices!
Javier J.,Los Angeles  CA,1658,1996,248,10/19/2010,3.0,"Oh BJ\'s  the name of the place that you\'ll have to snicker and giggle about suggesting some BJ\'s for dinner only to have your significant other roll their eyes because you\'ve made this joke ten too many times before. I have a love/hate relationship with Chicago style pizza. I hate it because you really can\'t call it pizza. Not in the same respect you call a flat style pizza pizza. Chicago style pizza is a sort of lasagna with pizza toppings and dough. You even have to cook it differently  so why still call it a pizza? Why yes  I would like to order a Chicago style pizza. Please serve me a trough of round bread with a bunch of shit in it. Can you make it really fucking slimy and awful? Thanks in advance  Chicago. You\'re the greatest. Chicago style pizza is the second most corrupt thing to ever come out of that city. Want proof? Well how about trying what we had this night at this fine Chicago style pizza establishment in the form of a Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza. Yeah  you heard that right.. we tried the Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza. Yeah  I\'m confused by this decision. I mean.. it\'s for people who can\'t make up their mind on if they want a burger or a pizza.. and it\'s Chicago style so add in that you can\'t make up your mind on if you want a Lasagna either. The burger was disturbing in the taste. I didn\'t get much bacon out of the flavor  so that was one misrepresentation right there. You can taste the ground beef and the pickles and cheese the most. Which I\'m not sure is the greatest thing to want to taste on a pizza. Service was pretty average and considering the large party we had  it was pretty attentive all things considered. The beer is tasty and well  that cuts across all the BJ\'s board. When you consider that they aren\'t a bud or miller sort of company  the fact that they are making such good quality beer is a note worthy item. Over all  it\'s probably the location most ""date nights"" end up for the folks who live in this suburban sprawl area and considering the alternatives to choose from in chains  it\'s one of the better choices.. even if the pizza is a pile of grossness."
Anne N.,Albany  NY,126,406,322,11/1/2008,2.0,I'm assuming this was the place at the Tustin Marketplace...I heard about this place from a friend and ended up coming here for another friend's birthday. My first assumption was that it was just like Cheesecake Factory-esque food. I was about right in terms of quality and quantity. Great food here. I tried the Parmesan chicken. That was a delight  loved the sun-dried tomatoes.For dessert our friend got two Pizookies for his birthday and we all shared that. I know this place is famous for it and everything  but you can technically make the same dessert at home. Still good I supposed. I was super full from the chicken!The main reason why this place is a 2 star place  it's the service here! I wouldn't mind to give it an average rating  but I can't. We made reservations that one person said we could do. Another said we couldn't the first time we called to confirm and were told we had to call a half hour before. Did that and came to the restaurant. No table. 1 hour wait. Finally got a table and then we ordered. Food took forever to come out. Then the bill took about 40 minutes to come! Ridiculous.I'm sure other Yelpers have said the same thing  i think it could be a hit or miss with the service (and maybe food  I have yet to try other stuff). The servers weren't jerks  they were just super busy and the place was packed (as always I'm sure).
Candace C.,San Francisco  CA,141,147,49,6/22/2011,5.0,"I love going here when there is a game on. I went during the NBA Finals Game 5 and everyone was getting really into it!! (But it\'s most likely cuz it was a really good game) I always get the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. I love that it has a little kick. The angel hair pasta is my second fav. I had Daniel as a server :) and he\'s always workin\' hard  lookin\' cute. haha. Oh yeah  I always use their call ahead. That way I can still get an estimate as to how much longer I can lag to get ready and some stuff done  while I\'m ""in line""All I have to say about their Red Velvet Pizookie is that I wish it were socially acceptable to be draped in velvet.Also  they have this REALLY TRIPPY 3-D TV thing while you wait. It\'s really weird/AWESOME."
Sofie Z.,Burnaby  Canada,20,25,99,10/31/2013,3.0,"This chain pizza joint is an ok rendition to the Chicago deep dish. When you\'ve tried authentic Lou Malnatis in Chicago  this one will have to do in SoCal. The options are great and the servings here are pretty big. We ordered a mini to share with meatballs mushrooms and green peppers. They definitely loaded the pizza with meatballs. I like how their ""build your own"" come with fresh marinated tomatoes  If you like tomatoes this definitely adds that juicy bite to the pizza. I do have to say that our mini was more bready and airy than a deep dish should be  but it was less oily which was a plus. We also orders the nachos that came with no shortage of cheese and a surprise hot beans sauce on the bottom which was a nice compliment. To end  a gluten free pazookie was ordered. It came warm with two scoops of vanilla ice cream. The first few bites were nice but once the ice cream starts melting you realize the cookie is way too sweet. This dessert is what BJs is known for  I\'m glad there\'s a gluten free version but toning down the sugar in the cookie recipe would have been better"
Michael C.,Irvine  CA,111,40,40,4/4/2013,2.0,Loud  slow service. Slow to seat  had to wait while others passed us up. Food is decent but the service really is subpar. Waiter spilled water all over table and didn't clean it up.
Georgia B.,Orange  CA,74,127,37,9/10/2013,4.0,Came on a busy night for happy hour. Average service  once we seated ourselves at the bar it took around 5 minutes for someone to come around and notice us. Nonetheless  BJ's has a pretty good happy hour! I love their Lemon Drop martini and their Strawberry Mojito. They also have call drinks and beer for $4 (recommend their Oktoberfest)  Cosmopolitans and other martinis/mojitos for $5  and wines for $6. Some appetizers like flatbreads and sliders. Also  if you have never had a Pizookie you are a sad sad individual because a FRESH BAKED COOKIE A LA MODE sounds delicious (and fattening) to me! They also have a gluten free option if that's your thing.
Bailey L.,Irvine  CA,0,9,4,2/1/2014,5.0,Ok... Been here 25 plus times and the quality is always superb from there pizzas to their Cesar salad and ofcourse their piezo okie
Joe R.,Santa Ana  CA,2,55,106,12/7/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,I gave them one more chance I tried their pizza and ahi salad it was great. Also the beer was good. They probably had a bad cook the last time I was there. Enjoy the ahi salad it's great
L C.,Irvine  CA,10,9,4,6/7/2013,2.0,"I like BJ\'s Pizza for well...their pizza....I just LOVE pizza!!!!This location is very popular so it\'s kinda odd they made the place so small. The food is really good but I\'ll never forget  I went here for my birthday and since we had leftover pizza we asked for a box. Well the server INSISTED she box it for us and all but two slices fell on the floor. She apologized and brought the check. UM??? No comp no ""well make you another one"" no...on my birthday I walked out of that place with two slices instead of 6!!!  Breaks my heart anytime I think of it!"
Jordan D.,Irvine  CA,628,171,154,3/2/2011,4.0,what can you really say about chain places like these? You know the foods going to be good or else they wouldn't be a national chain so here is my attempt at this.I come here pretty frequently  but never been here for happy hour  but all I hear are really good things. During Fridays and the weekend you should try and call in because the place is extremely packed  with wait times going from 15 minutes to about an hour depending on your group size. Good thing is  is that you can go to the bar and watch some sports and drink there while you wait. Don't want to wait? well you can even eat at the bar if you want to. Food and alcohol...can't go wrong.This place is known for their pizzas and their delicious pizookies (sp?). I love the BBQ chicken pizza and their chicken fettuchini alfredo. The pizza is perfectly made and the chicken not dry at all in both meals. I love taking the bread they serve and dipping it in the alfredo sauce. The sauce was rich and creamy but not too creamy. Id recommend both meals for anyone. O and you cant have a meal there without getting a pizooki  ice cream scoops on top of a freshly baked mega cookie. This may be the greatest thing on the menu there. Cookie is baked to perfection and the entire meal just melts in your mouth when you take a big bite. SUPER DELICIOUS. The beers are really good as well. I personally like the jeremiah red and the tatonka which is very strong and rich  not recommended for people who enjoy drinking bud light or coors when other beer is available. But for the most part their house beers are all pretty good.Everything is pretty pricey during regular meal hours  but i mean you are getting what you paid for. The service here is pretty solid and most of them are extremely nice and talkative  making sure your meal is wonderful  except for one time the waiter must have been having a horrible day because he couldn't help making us think that throughout our meal.Other than all that i'm sure I'll be coming back here again in the near future.GO EAT IT!!! .xxxx.             |(o)(o)| ( (__) )  | ( ) |   NOM NOM NOM!!!  \\__/Jordan
Nazeli S.,Glendale  CA,42,120,4,1/1/2013,5.0,BJ's is always good  but this location is my favorite! They really pile up their salads which is great because the Glendale location really skimps out ingredients so you can definitely see a difference. As always their pazookie is yummy and the service was great!
M F.,Irvine  CA,0,48,6,3/11/2012,4.0,Holy crap  does this place have everything or what?Great food  good beer and....TV screens!!! AAAHHHHhhhhhh!Ordered a pizza  the clam chowder and the *warm* avocado egg rolls as an appetizer. Surprisingly good.Have gone several times. Service is good.
Todd G.,Orange County  CA,78,22,7,4/17/2013,4.0,I really like this place and am a member of their rewards program. I have had quite a few things off their menu and have never had a bad meal. Their rib eye steak was really good and their pizza flat bread is good too. Their signature pizza is deep dish but it is really tasty. They also have hand tossed but I have never ordered it.In my opinion their beer is only average and I have tried all of it. So I just order Stone's IPA  which they have on tap. You may like their beer but I'm a bit of a beer snob.The best dish on the menu is the by far the Jambalaya. Remember to order it half spicy unless you want your mouth on fire. I love spicy food and never order something half spicy but their Jambalaya is WAY TOO HOT. Order it half spicy and it is the best Jambalaya in Orange County. Whenever I go to a restaurant I always order Jambalaya if it is on the menu. So I have had it at half a dozen places and theirs is the best. Chaparosa Grill in the District in Tustin used to be the best but they closed. BJs has fair prices and you won't leave hungry. You probably won't need dessert but if you can eat it the Pazookie is great! The service has almost always been fantastic. The only knock on the place is that there is always a long wait unless you call ahead or come in at off times.
Kirt F.,Pflugerville  TX,118,22,3,10/18/2011,3.0,Good food  good service. Their Flat bread Pizza appetizer (Basil and Italian Sausage) was EPIC!!! Their main courses were decent enough. Although my wife had a chicken type dinner with rice pilaf and the rice looked and tasted incredibly similar to Rice-a-Roni. Really off putting for her. The highlight were the drinks  my wife and our guest had a selection of seasonal beers and my son and I had their Cream Soda Soft velvety smooth delivery that finishes with a slight hint of butterscotch goodness.All in all  not too bad. Not sure we will make a trip to Irvine again for this place  but if we do  I will order two Flat Bread Pizzas for dinner accompanied by a frosty Cream Soda  served in a frosted mug. =)
Eddie Y.,Irvine  CA,11,10,,3/24/2013,1.0,I've never had a problem at any other bj's location but this one seems to disappoint without fail. Long wait times to put in orders  long wait times for food  attitude when you kindly ask them to.change the channel on tv   problems with splitting checks every single time. This is THE WORST managed bjs of any location.
Spaz B.,Irvine  CA,91,16,,5/30/2014,2.0,I came here for dinner on a Friday night. I placed my order and fifteen minutes later my waitress went on break having never put my order in. A half hour or so later  the waitress who took over our section asked if we needed anything else or if we wanted the check. I let her know that we still hasn't received our meal. She was very apologetic and told us that she would put the order in to the kitchen for us and let management know. The manager passed through our section several times without saying anything to me about my meal until I finally flagged him down to let him know I was very dissatisfied with my experience and the wait. The manager said he had already made sure the kitchen was on top of our order  however after waiting for an hour to get our food they didn't comp or discount anything on my bill. Not even the drinks. I am a manager in food service and I would never let a guest of mine leave with an experience as sour as this without at least offering to comp something. Honestly this was terrible customer service on behalf of an otherwise great restaurant.
Jeri A.,Gardena  CA,59,20,20,9/1/2013,3.0,Went for lunch yesterday...we usually love the caesar salad but this time there was barely any dressing on it so we asked for a side of dressing. Then the pizza was ok just needed a little more sauce...and just a suggestion to use regular lemonade and not pink lemonade in the Arnold Palmer drink.  Just a suggestion.  But still all in all ok. They have great deals!
Anthony G.,Irvine  CA,8,12,1,1/12/2014,3.0,I went there for my girlfriends birthday with a party of 10. Made reservations in the morning  but when we got there the hostess said we would still have to wait 1.5 hours to be seated. However  when we talked to the manager about it she was nice enough to seat us right away. The server was very nice  but our order never made it back to the kitchen for some reason. The chef ended up coming out and personally apologizing saying we could have free salad and appetizers while we wait for our food. They also made up for it by giving us a free pizookie platter for dessert. The food was great  the server and hostess should not have made those mistakes but the manager and chef recovered nicely.
Alex G.,Santa Ana  CA,75,51,30,11/6/2013,4.0,food was great. I really recommend the spicy maranara
Liz H.,Irvine  CA,15,167,22,6/15/2011,5.0,BJs has been a favorite for a long time for me. I've never had bad service  the food is always delicious  and it's a great place to meet up with some friends and enjoy a meal and a couple of beers.Everyone raves about the pizooki  and rightfully so - it's just that damn good. The last time I went I had a balsamic chicken dish on top of fresh arugula - absolutely delicious. My friend had a seafood dish (I'm not sure which one) and enjoyed it. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. I was going to take one star off because I don't actually think their beer selection is that fantastic  which is disappointing. I've tried all of them and found them rather boring. But their mixed drinks are always strong and well mixed  so that redeemed the star. If you go  ask to sit in Bill's section. You won't be disappointed.
Rebecca P.,Anaheim  CA,86,67,,4/4/2011,5.0,First time at this location and it's my FAVE! Not going to lie it's pretty loud!! but the employees are friendly.... except the 2 girls at the front!! :/But other than that it was a good experience....FOOD is DELICIOUS!! I had the Veggie Burger (it's a BIG portion) which could be good or bad!! in this case I ate half and half to go! Yum
Amanda Y.,Irvine  CA,87,25,10,8/3/2013,5.0,Good pizza  awesome pizookie! Fun atmosphere. Stopped in recently for lunch and it was super affordable and yummy!
Christi P.,Tustin  CA,3,54,16,1/2/2013,1.0,Seriously...disgusting. I think it's just this BJ's location. Been here over 6 times and keep giving it another go  but I think I will not be coming back. Service is slow  and once the hostess was playing with a packet of bubble wrap the entire time we were waiting- right in front of our face!Once the appetizer came out after the entree  and the shrimp tasted like it was over a month old! Then the pizza came out and it was ice cold. Just...disgusting. Do yourself a favor and go to the one in Huntington Beach. Management  wake up!
Angel Q.,Irvine  CA,7,342,70,8/10/2011,2.0,First time been here and my experience was mediocre.  I am easy going and generally don't get too picky about restaurants.  Well the waitress who served my table had a little attitude problem. Since i showed up late  I heard someone at my table said something and the waitress hardly came back. She walked around and talked to other customers but avoided our table. Doesn't matter if your customers offended you by what they said  you still need to be professional about it.  When you choose to be a waitress  you choose to take crap from your customers and thats just part of going into customer service fields.  If your pride gets in the way of doing your job  then being a waitress is not what you should be doing.  Waitress/servers is the one person who you have the most encounter at the restaurants and is representing the restaurants' image. What these waitresses do can make or break the view of a customers view of the restaurants.  Really? I am surprise to shock you little waitress with this new revelation. I hope you learn from my honest review and take a little attitude check before you annoy more customers.  Over all  i love BJ food even though i think its pricey. I probably would go to another location more often than this location though.  This is my 2 cents.
Shelly J.,Los Angeles  CA,679,398,105,7/2/2010,4.0,Chicken wingsssss!! is so good. Best chicken wings.Pizza  pasta  all good. I have my reservations about their sandwiches =PFinish off the meal with THE Pizookie. OMG *Love
David B.,Lihue  HI,10,72,663,8/31/2013,1.0,Why do I even try to go to this overpriced poseur of a restaurant? They don't take reservations  the wait is always longer than promised  the staff tries to upsell everything  the TVs are all on different channels  and the food is mediocre. This is definitely my last trip
Chelsea C.,Santa Barbara  CA,8,25,15,9/28/2014,2.0,Awful service. Took forever for our waitress to notice us. Our pizza came before the appetizer. We ended up having several waiters because they were so short staffed. Only good think about the night was the pizookie.
Lanna K.,Irvine  CA,43,197,24,5/19/2011,4.0,VL and I have a mini obsession with BJ's. I even crave their house salad once in a while which is really odd but I can explain. Their lettuce is always really cold and crisp and their ranch is one of the better ones I've had! I also really like their chicken wings and avocado egg rolls and spaghetti with spicy tomato sauce and.... ok I'll stop. But really  their pizzas? Love them! VL and I usually like thin crust but we make an exception for BJ's. The crust is the best part because it's crispy on the outside  chewy on the inside. The only thing the bar is good for are their beers. Jeremiah Red is my favorite and I always make a point to try their seasonals.The only down side to this place is that there is always a ridiculous wait which is fine because I prefer to sit at the bar area anyways but they just recently made their bar tables TINY. Ugh. Also  their service is spotty. Their servers are not exactly cream of the crop. They have rude ones  snobby ones  clueless ones. You name it. Anyways  for that  I almost gave BJ's 3 stars but I'll give them a break. Yay chains! ....
Lea T.,San Francisco  CA,24,214,24,11/18/2012,2.0,I often travel to this area for business  so decided to give BJ's a shot. I went once and sat at the bar and ordered an appetizer and a couple of drinks. The food was exactly what I expected - good  but nothing to write home about. Service was a little dicey. I had a hard time getting the bartender to notice me when I needed something  but other than that  it was an okay experience.The second time I went back  I went with a business partner and we sat in the restaurant. We went early  so were seated immediately and I must say  I really like the relaxed atmosphere. The lighting is really nice and it feels like a great place for a conversation. I didn't notice this before  but they have the calories of everything listed on the menu. I found this really depressing as everything worth ordering was chock full of calories. I ended up ordering something that seemed reasonable calorie-wise  but I have to say I felt like it was not even worth going out once I saw how fattening all the food was and what my reasonable options were. Anyway  waitress was nice enough but our food was not prepared as requested. Some will say this is NOT the waitress' fault  but it is her job to check the food before bringing it out (I used to be a waitress) and she clearly did not as it was obvious the food was wrong. My friend sent back his meal  but I kept mine as it was not that wrong and the kitchen was relatively slow in correcting their mistake. There was the awkwardness choice of me eating my food while it was hot and then having to sit there with no food while he got his or just waiting for his food to come. I chose to eat unnaturally slow so that I would have something left on my plate by the time his food came. And then to be nice  I shared some of small meal with him so he could eat too. When his food came  he offered to share  but I didn't like what he ordered  so I ended-up with half a meal that night.I was shocked that the waitress made no attempt to compensate us for the problem with our food. I was expecting a free desert or something given how long it took for them to correct the problem.
Casey L.,Tustin  CA,3,2,,12/5/2014,2.0,"I like the food but...Sadly management ""skirted"" their responsibility of keeping a neighboring boisterous and loud large party from disturbing an entire room of customers. The party was so loud I\'m shouting still to be heard by my dinner partners  who are less than 2 feet away across the table. We asked politely that the manager ""manage"" the situation and quiet down the party but we didn\'t observe any action taken or hear an change in the situation after he left. We came to celebrate and felt ""Dissed"" over dollars since the other party was at least double the size of ours....what happened to customer service  leadership and the proprietor...ensuring a quality dining experience for all customers. Managements attempt to try and resolve the issue wasn\'t followed up on making it an uncomfortable dining experience."
Ashley G.,Irvine  CA,4,16,4,6/11/2013,5.0,"Cannot say enough GREAT things about this place! Even when slammed pack the food is still prepared delicious. There deep dish pizza\'s  avocado rolls  actually the ""best beginnings"" sampler is the way to go! Its all amazing  then we ordered the pizookie trio with red velvet  chocolate chunk and white chocolate raspberry macadamia nut. OMG it was heaven in my mouth. The waiter also brought out a peanut butter pizookie ON THE HOUSE because the kitchen accidentally made an extra one. I thought that was awesome of the waiter. Most definitely will be coming back!"
Akta A.,Orange County  CA,8,36,1,11/24/2010,4.0,I am a fan of their deep dish pizza. My favorite is the Mediterranean pizza and I replace chicken with some vegetable. I like the other vegetarian options as well.For starters  I recommend their Bruschetta  Artichoke Spinach dip & Mozarella sticks. I really like the pizookie. It is a must have when you go to BJ's.
Robin W.,Orange County  CA,380,710,318,4/2/2011,4.0,This place is always crowded so avoid it at peak times. Stick to the pizza -- it is deep dish and delish. All other menu items are forgettable.But really  all I want to talk about is the Pizookie. Dessert heaven in a skillet. Hot  fresh  melty cookie in a pan topped with ice cream. Your choice of cookie flavor.I could easily skip all other food choices and just go with the cookie nirvana that is the Pizookie.
Dee I.,Westminster  CA,126,271,209,4/9/2013,4.0,I came here for a pre-game snack with a friend. This was my first visit and I have to say  it was really good. I don't normally drink beer - I think the last time I did was 20 years ago in college doing quarters - but thought the occasion called for it. Had no clue what to order  but the waiter was very helpful and suggested the blonde(?) for this newbie. It was actually pretty decent...and matched up perfectly with the calamari  the happy hour wings and deep dish pepperoni pizza we ordered. I'm normally very picky about my calamari. I want it quickly fried to give it that crispy bite  but not long to cause you to feel as if you're chewing on an old tire. And that's exactly how it was served. Crispy on the outside  and perfectly cooked inside. The sauces  a marinara and a tartar type sauce was fabulous. If I wasn't in public viewing I'dve picked up those tiny little containers and emptied it out into my gaping maw of a mouth. Yeah  that delicious to me. The wings  I guess happy hour style means  just fried...but I liked that. Often times they drench the wings in sauce  and I prefer the lighter hand when it comes to sauce. I didn't try the deep dish pizza  that was all his  but he seemed happy with.They've got a pretty good selection of food and although I'm not into big chain restaurants  this served it's purpose and I'll be back. Those lettuce wraps looked tasty...
Lauren H.,Irvine  CA,57,32,23,6/3/2011,4.0,This place has great food that will accommodate everyone in your party. The main food you MUST get here are the pizookies. Other places can't quite make their pizookies as delicious. They have a wide variety of different types of cookies that you can choose from. In terms of actual food  I would recommend the gourmet pizzas here! All of the other food here is decent  so you can't really make a bad choice.This place has a great atmosphere with very helpful waiters and bar area up front filled with television screens for sports. It is great for parties and hanging with friends  but if you are looking for an intimate place  this is not the one.
Syndie P.,Colorado Springs  CO,97,21,12,6/1/2011,4.0,Best place for gourmet pizza! I have been to this particular BJ's over a dozen of time's and I even had my baby shower at this location. What I find so neat is that they actually train their employees here and I have yet to get someone that hasn't been awesome. Happy hour is great here too if you don't mind sitting in the bar area and having appetizers.I was at this location once  sitting in the bar area  and this lady was with her husband. She obviously was mad at him for some reason and was hitting him every once in while  she even threw her drink on him once. She had way to much to drink at some point during that day  so the manager came over to try and handle the situation. At this point  the lady was out of control  yelling at everyone and demanding more drinks. So long story short  the manager sat with her and talked to her just to calm her down and he had also called a taxi for her since her husband had left her there. I thought the manager did an outstanding job as far has how he handled the situation. Bonus points there!Why do I always wait to talk about the food last? It's always the best part  right?! Their appetizers are all very good  try to check out one ever time you visit. Their specialty pizzas are the best though  the mediterranean one is my favorite by far. The more bizarre they seem  the better they taste so don't be afraid to branch out. They have a nice variety of food if you don't feel like pizza  so it's really a great place for everyone. I know by the end you are probably stuffed and will be getting a to go box  but you absolutely must try their pazooki for dessert.Those that are beer drinkers  the Jeremiah Red is delicious. They have a ton of beers and specialty drinks  so check them out! They also have a ton of tvs and are always playing the current sport events. Check this place out! I have only her great things from all of their locations.
Gina S.,Orange  CA,4,7,,12/21/2010,5.0,"This really isn\'t ""just pizza"" it\'s more like  kiss-your-baby-daddy-all-night-long- pizza! Oh  you have to eat it to believe it! It\'s super thick  deep dish pizza with something secretly special in the crust.... I call it ""crack crust"" cuz you WILL become addicted. You keep coming back for more and simply can\'t get enough! The toppings are always really fresh. I go with tomato and mushrooms. I also get a side of pepperoncinis! If they are cooked on the pizza  they become really spicy.  My husband gets the shrimp tacos  he says they are fab (he also has a slice or two of my pizza  of course).I wouldn\'t recommend getting the mini. It\'s too small for the ""deep dish effect."" The toppings sort of fall to the middle. Nah  I get a small or a medium so I can have plenty to take home and eat the next day. It\'s wicked tasty warmed up in the microwave.  And the absolute best part  you can call your name in when you leave the house....when you get there  you will be seated immediately! I love the dirty looks I get from the waiting customers. Booyah! It goes a little something like this: ""Hey! ....What?...Are you kidding me?...We were here first!"" Or my personal favorite  both arms straight out  palms facing up  ""What the hell?!...How did they...?"""
Dave L.,Irvine  CA,526,100,61,11/13/2010,4.0,The decor is open and resembles the inside of a brewery + sports bar but clean and sophisticated. It you go on a weekend night  you'll have to wait up to an hour. The menu is extensive with lots of choices including healthier items like salads and lettuce wraps. We go to BJ's once a week and usually split a salad and a pizza. This is the most economical way to go. The salads are more finely chopped with all the ingredients included. The pizza is deep dish Chicago style with lots of toppings to choose from. My son loves the French Dip sandwich.A huge plus with BJs is their special deserts. The bazookie desert is what they are famous for. It's giant chocolate cookie baked in a flat pan with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. It comes to your table hot from the oven and you eat them with a spoon. Yum. Overall  it's a fun and dependable place to have a nice meal. Enjoy.
Susie I.,Orange  CA,108,5,3,11/22/2014,5.0,Excellent food and service! Love their pazookis. I recommend this restaurant to everyone.
C T.,Santa Ana  CA,3,18,,11/3/2012,2.0,Ugh  this is probably the worst BJ's I've been to. I don't know if it's just because it was a Thursday evening and it was pretty crowded because they were playing some important game on their TVs  but the service for our table was retarded. - The hostess sat us down at a table that was 2 chairs short  so my little brother and I had to wait there picking our noses in the middle of the crowded place for a few minutes until they got our chairs  while the rest of my family were already seated.- Our blonde waitress derped on giving us those extra plates to eat our appetizers on  so we had to sit there having to reach over everywhere.- Blonde waitress did not clear out the drink glasses that were finished. She left those there throughout the entire dinner. And our family of 6 was squeezed onto a small-ass table  so....those glasses got in the damn way.- Blonde waitress was not on her game when we needed drink refills.- Also the food quality was not impressive that night. Maybe I was just in a bad mood that night  but BJ's derpy service over there did not help.
Nessa C.,Irvine  CA,54,90,61,4/14/2011,4.0,4 stars  but more for service than food. Ordered the fish tacos and it seemed like they just stuffed a fish stick in it and then piled the toppings on. I also got the strawberry lemonade  it was tart and definitely had real lemons in it  but strawberries not so much.Ambience was fun and we were seated in the back patio. The service was top notch and accomodating..food could use some work.
Bobby M.,Newport Beach  CA,15,56,10,4/12/2011,5.0,Tons of beers  tons of comfort food and of course Pizza. I'm sure you've been to a B'Js Pizza before  no need for a deep review. Enjoy~
Dee N.,Fountain Valley  CA,1050,428,85,3/13/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,TRIPOD OF DOOM!!!The pizza pan shook violently toward me when I tried to get a slice of pizza--and not because it wanted to eat me instead  but rather  because the tripod holding the pan was LOPSIDED!Imagine a hot pan of pizza collapsing onto your lap  due to the carelessness of a sucky server!Yeah  not fun!I was a lucky duck that it didn't topple!I found a manager after the scare  and had him trade the tripod. I would have liked for him to trade the server  too...but I'm not one to cause a scene at a restaurant.Anyway  the white pizza was delish (as it always is ) but the BBQ Chicken pizza SUCKED! The BBQ sauce was burnt--and tasted like ashes!Mac n Cheese was pretty good--great price on that too  but the avocado eggrolls were just okay this time...very bland.Overall  food was a dismal 3 stars  and service was definitely 1 star  so...I'll be sticking to the HB location from now on!
Chris C.,Orange  CA,200,79,15,4/6/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Yeah  I'm supposed to be on a diet since well....... big plans are coming up. Supposed to be doing the Paleo diet (basically  only natural foods our cavemen ancestors ate).Well  some friends invited me out to BJ's  and I could NOT resist and the diet was over :( Hahaha. I love BJ's deep dish pizza. I know there are people like that the thin crust  but nothing hits the spot better for me than when I grab a slice of that Sweet Pig pinapple and bacon pizza  or I sink my teeth into a Great White cheese pizza!! I love how the crust is nice and think and crunchy and crisp!After eating here  I'm dying to hit up Chicago; Yes yes  I'm sure the pizzas there are different than what I had at BJ's in Tustin  but wow... SO delicious!
matt C.,Newport Beach  CA,3,42,3,8/27/2013,4.0,Was by myself for a tuesday lunch  stopped here around noon. Crowded but no wait. ordered the Santa Fe salad with blackened salmon  a glass of pinot (1/2 off tuesdays)  was out the door for $26. Great salad  fun bar  lots of sports to watch  etc. Service person was a little too attentive  maybe she had read some of the service reviews below? The pizza that other people around me got looked & smelled great  was wishing I had ordered one until my salad arrived. Can't find a thing to complain about.
Nate P.,Costa Mesa  CA,351,8,5,1/10/2014,1.0,doors open so its cold. very long wait. bathrooms are a wreck. food cold. my son's bday gone wrong. he said worst bday he ever had. :(.
Linda Y.,Irvine  CA,366,549,21,4/15/2010,3.0,I never really liked BJ's. I never understood why people rave about their pizzas. Is it really that good? Yeah  they're alright but if I wanted pizza I wouldn't think to go to BJ's. We walked in  easily found a seat  but did not easily find a waitress. That doesn't make sense. Anyway  on to Happy Hour. It's $2 off the appetizers excluding the little plates like kettle chips and bruschetta. $1 off drinks. 1/2 off mini pizzas. The pints of beer are not expensive. They're like $5 each which is a pretty good deal in my book.For 3 people  we ordered 2 mini pizzas (buffalo and mediterranean)  potato skins  and nachos. I'm not gonna lie  they were all pretty good. Except maybe the mediterranean pizza. It had olives  sundried tomatoes  feta  pepperoncinis  and chicken. The feta and sundried tomatoes made the pizza taste dry. The buffalo pizza was pretty bomb though. Great buffalo sauce flavor  chicken  celery. The nachos were huge and was topped with chili made with pale ale. The potato skins were pretty good too. I do like my skins crispier though.We paid about $10 each which is great but I don't know... I left feeling full but not satisfied. Nothing is spectacular about this place. I'll go to Happy Hour somewhere else next time.
Andy H.,Turlock  CA,41,2,,10/17/2013,1.0,Service started off fine then once we got our food  never saw our waiter again. Took about 50 minutes for them to bring out a coffee... A coffee..... We finally just said forget the coffee and the dessert. Last time I will be coming here. Too bad too because the beer is good.
Jj F.,Tustin  CA,38,5,,10/23/2012,1.0,If I could give them 0 stars I would. Service was horrible ... There was hair in my food and the plates where dirty... I will never in myLife visit this location again. I love bjs but I guess I'm going to have to love the brea and Huntington Beach locations because management does not have a lid on their basic cleanliness which even a hole in the wall taco joint could get right. If anyone from corporate reads this understand I'm a suit myself and you CANNOT SCREW UP LIKE THIS. It's like if Bank of America lost your money out of your checking account... It's a foundational necessity to be clean in a restaurant.
Carinna R.,Irvine  CA,31,10,1,12/30/2012,2.0,Firstly  the calamari was neither crispy or stylish. Just a glut of rubbery squid made for the fast food generation. The deep dish pizza was rotund  thick and packed with stodge just like the fat cats who own this chain. Happy hour more like miserable hour. It can be good though  not tonight Josephine.
Calvin C.,Irvine  CA,4,82,1,4/8/2013,3.0,I think the overall yelp rating of 3.5 stars is about right for this place. Their burgers are good but doesn't stand out in my mind. Good deals on happy hour and t he pizookie is an eye opener. You'll wonder where that dessert has been all your life when you try it.
Morgan M.,Rancho Santa Margarita  CA,169,159,58,5/8/2011,3.0,I have had wonderful food at the El Toro location  but this time i was not impressed. I ordered the Ahi Salad this time. I had debated with my usual  the sesame salad  and with something spicy  the creole talipa. I definitely wished i had opted for something else! This salad just seemed confused...it didn't know whether or not it wanted to be Italian (based off the dressing)  Asian (it had crispy wontons)  Mexican (avacado and tomato on the side) or Mediterranean (interesting choice of greens...). The dressing tasted bitter  and the ahi tasted as if it had been seasoned with steak seasoning. I was definitely disappointed  especially because the waitress raved that it was her favorite and their most popular salad. I HIGHLY doubt that. I love BJ's but I will never order this salad again.However  i did order pazooki for dessert: half red velvet  half cookie :) delicious! The pazookie is what saved this review from only 1 star.
Karen Y.,Irvine  CA,1,4,,7/30/2013,5.0,Here's a tip that I would like to share for those going to BJ's during the dinner hour. It's tends to get crowded especially during the summer months. Sign up for the BJ's Premier Rewards and be sure to show your card when you check in. It doesn't guarantee a wait time but I know we get in a lot faster. About 10-15 minute wait. Also don't for get to get a mini pizookie. It's a perfect size for two or if you're a family then get the bigger one. Enjoy.
Jeff K.,Anaheim  CA,1196,934,2711,1/4/2011,3.0,more like 2.75/5 stars.i came here for my birthday dinner and sadly to say  it disappointed me.first off  they got my reservation wrong. i asked them to reserve a table for me for a party of 17 for 8pm. they wrote 7pm. when i show up at 8pm  they said i didn't make the 7pm time and that we had to wait for the table to open up. WTF.  i got the full rack of ribs  potatoes with soup. The potions are pretty filling for anyone. 20$ for the full rackmy gf got half greek half great white pizza. (its cool you can split pizza cuz for indecisive people  its a god send.) abour 14$ish for the pizza.my friend bought me a snakebite  and it was very delicious. the server seemed like a new guy  cuz he didn't know what a black/white pazooki was. black/white = chocolate chips and white chocolate chips with macadamias nuts. they forgot to give me the complementary birthday pazooki  my friend had to ask for it...and when I did receive my birthday pazooki  the cookie was not cooked properly. they do not split checks for large parties  but you can always just write how much you owe with your credit card on the back of the receipt. sat outside  but it was surprising semi warm. the server seemed very busy  but he forget to re fill up our waters and forget to bring extra water for friends who were missing h20.
Karen V.,Anaheim  CA,2,5,,10/28/2014,2.0,"We came here for dinner and to watch the world series while dining. I will start out with what went well - the food. It is consistent with other BJ restaurants that I have been to. I will also give a shout out to the waitress that we ended up with Tierra (they changed servers after our drink order) - she is the only saving grace for the night. She was a good waitress and had a pleasant personality and was the only person that made us feel welcome. Why am I rating them a 2 stars? First of all the greeters at the front desk - anything but friendly. I wish I got their names....but they were 2 younger girls. I hope they don\'t have aspirations to be much more in life than where they are sitting - because their attitudes sucked! They had sour faces when we came in. All they did was take our name and hand us a buzzer - they are not even the ones to seat people!  I asked if we could sit outside at the patio - one of them said ""yes - if i can find a server for out there."" Not sure what that meant..... because people were seated out there already. We searched the bar area  but it was packed due to all the sports events that were taking place...... our name was called in about 10 minutes. The greeter now informs me that she cant seat us at the patio because a party of 17 will be seated out there (yeah we get it - more $$ - whatever) and she cant accomodate us.  The seater now takes us to our table....which is near a busy walk path and UNDER NEATH the TV screen.  I told her we didnt want this table - the whole purpose was to SEE the TV while we dined.  She said ""i\'m sorry. Are you sure you dont want this table? I will have to give it to someone else"".  I said ""No  I don\'t want it and secondly  dont say you are sorry  when I know darn well you could care less where you seat us.""We ended up fending for ourselves and grabbing a table in the bar area....barely.  The first waitress we had in the bar brought us our menus....didnt get her name though... when my boyfriend inquired about a specific kind of beer....she says ""all our beers are listed in our menu."" - which is fine  we didn\'t expect her to list the names of everything on the menu - but it was the ATTITUDE and TONE that was conveyed.  if i could guess what she was thinking  it felt something like ""read the menu idiots  I don\'t have time for this."" The next thing we knew - SHE wasn\'t our waitress anymore and our new server took care of us  which was fine.  She was the only person that was upbeat and positive and acted like she CARED.I don\'t mean to seem trivial and I am not a high maintenance customer - it really all boils down to the ATTITUDE that one person after the next at this location conveyed while interacting with customers.  These were all primarly the Greeters and Seaters.  If they aren\'t friendly - who wants to continue with eating there?Service with a smile. Treating everyone like they are welcomed and that you are happy to answer any questions or concerns..... not at this BJ\'s.They could care less what their customers want. Just get them seated  served and out for the next person.  I will still go to Bj\'s - just not this one."
Lauren J.,Las Vegas  NV,266,296,106,10/22/2010,3.0,Love/Hate. Love: I love love love love love the food at BJ's. My favorite pizza is the Sweet Pig without tomatoes. (The tomatoes are huge chunks that probably come from a can). I love to dip it in Ranch dressing. I can put down a personal pizza in about 10 minutes  but it's very very filling. I am fan of some of the other menu items as well like the bruschetta and the spinach & artichoke dip. I cannot say enough good things about the pizookie! I crave these things. Sometimes  I will order on to go and pick it up :) If you are eating dinner with me  you better be prepared to fight me for the HATE: the service!!! the service sucks at every single BJ's I've ever been to. Sorry to people I know from high school who still work at this location. But  you guys SUCK.
Andrew L.,Irvine  CA,0,6,,11/29/2013,3.0,Props to the place for staying open late! The food is ok but even if you don't enjoy the meal  if you have a pizookie  you forget about everything else... so good!
Gabrielle A.,Irvine  CA,48,76,29,4/2/2012,3.0,I think you can't go wrong with their pizzas and pizookis. Everything else is MEH or not worth the calories. But between their buffalo chicken pizza and bj's favorite pizza...the bjs favorite is 200% better.
Richard T.,Irvine  CA,3,56,,5/28/2013,4.0,I am not much of a fan for chain restaurant. BJ is a convenience since its only a mile from home. We do both take-out and dine-in. The food is good and the service is very good. The joint is professionally run including attentive service. The food is not greasy and my kids love it so I am a fan.My 8 and 10 year old sons love the spaghetti with meat sauce. The meat sauce is like catnip to them. For take-out we order the regular size spaghetti with extra meat sauce. I usually boil up extra noodles and mix it in with the extra sauce to feed both the boys.My kids are a fan of calarmari. BJ's calamari is fairly good but the portion is terribly small for even two young kids.When dining in  the child size spaghetti easily feeds each of them. My wife loves the mahi mahi with pineapple fried rice. Our first time experience with this dish included lots of pineapple. This made the dish very tasty. However  when we ordered the dish during our return trip  they sparingly added pineapple to the dish. This totally changed the dish and made it much less appealing. Their deep dish pizzas remind me of the old Numero Uno pizzas. Thick and slightly sweet breaded type crust with a large variety of toppings to choose from.BJ's beers are bold in taste and also have a big bite to them which I am not particular to. No problem  they have a good selection of common commercial brands available.
Simone C.,San Diego  CA,32,28,3,11/2/2012,2.0,A friend and I went to BJ's for a late dinner recently and it was a less-than satisfactory experience. Starting with the good  our food was BJ's usually high quality  and that's what saved this meal from failure.Now for the not-so-good.We were seated at a visibly dirty table that had pools of fluid and crumbs on it. The first server who came by put our drink napkins down into the mess. When she took our drink orders we asked for someone to come clean the table. The person who did was quick and efficient  and then put the same (now) dirty napkins down on the table. The server who brought our drinks wasn't the same server who took our drink order. The server who took our food order was different  too. As was the server who brought out our soup. As was the server who brought out our food and first delivered it to the wrong table. Nobody came back to check on our meal after the food was down  which was particularly bothersome as nobody had brought us silverware. I went and found someone to give us silverware and brought it back to the table myself. The only server continuity we had was at the very end and she refreshed our long-empty drinks and brought us our bill.Only the very first server and the final server introduced themselves and it was overall a chaotic and confusing dining experience.
Vanessa L.,Anaheim  CA,696,680,59,4/6/2008,1.0,The food at chain restaurants are usually uniform. This is a review of the service. The service was horrible the evening that I came. Granted it was a party of 14 on a Friday evening and maybe our server had a hard time dealing with a large crowd. But I was really disappointed; our server forgot orders and would come out with three drinks in his hands and ask someone from our table to get up and grab a drink out of his hand and serve it to our table. At that point  he could have opted not to carry so many drinks.He forgot our orders. He had our table waiting a ridiculously long time. Our bill came out with a mandatory 17% gratuity charge. Our table split the order and I paid by credit card and he added an additional 17% gratuity on my credit card charge. I asked him if he could do anything about it and he said no. He did this with the other two persons paying by credit card also. I am not surprised to hear that other yelpers have had problems with their bills here.I am not returning here ever again.
Lorena M.,Garden Grove  CA,0,6,,9/20/2015,1.0,I have never left a negative review on Yelp as I have never experienced such horrible service at a restaurant! I should've known the minute I walked in! The restaurant was scorching hot! The next indicator of poor customer service happened as soon as our buzzer went off and we arrived at the hostess station. No one greeted us indicating that we would be seated next. We were just left standing there while the servers talked amongst themselves. Our section was hot but we just thought perhaps it had to do with the fact that we were seated near a window on a 100+ day. We later found out that the air conditioning was not working. Our server was subpar. I ordered the lunch combo and she said it was unavailable on the weekend. (Then why is it on the menu I thought to myself.). Rather than offering a similar meal  I had to find a replacement while she stood there acting frustrated. Fail! We suffered through the heat and it wasn't until I got up to go to the ladies room that I realized that I was drenched from the heat. So  I asked if there was an issue with ac and she said yes  that I was not the first to bring it to her attention. I told her that I was there to celebrate my friend's birthday and we paid a decent amount for our meal and asked if there was something she could do. She said she'd get the manager to come over. The manager came over and he was annoyed. I informed him about the situation and he gave me a list of excuses and never apologized. He begrudgingly gave us a courtesy discount for our next meal and simply dropped them off and took off! This was the worst customer service / experience I've experienced at this type of establishment! I will NOT be going back to this location and I recommend that you forgo this location and try another one. I recently went to BJ's at The Block in Orange and the experience was a very pleasant one!
Rick D.,Irvine  CA,0,5,,9/23/2012,2.0,"Two star rating only because the food and beer is passable. HOWEVER  you can have the best kitchen staff around  but if the servers are rude and incompetent  customers stay away.When we walked in the door to a mostly empty restaurant  3 workers who I assume should have greeted us and sat us  were busy chatting among themselves  just pointed and said ""You can sit at the bar."" When the bill came  we paid using a credit card  which the server ran twice. Once for my bill  and another time for someone else\'s. He could have apologized for the mistake  and I would have corrected it with my bank. Instead  he never said a word  smiled at us and accepted our generous tip. I had to find the extra charge in my bank statement.Food and beer is OK.Rude and dishonest wait staff.Management can do better."
Emily P.,Cerritos  CA,122,353,39,8/16/2012,3.0,I have been to quite a few BJ's and this one seems to let me down quite a bit. I got pretty horrible service this time  even having eyes rolled at me and my group when asking about our appetizer that didn't come out before our food or even at all. Then she offered us a pizookie for the inconvenience and charged us anyways .. Customer Service goes far .. I know mistakes happen  but this visit was one mistake after another and the manager did not stick to her word
Melody L.,San Francisco  CA,36,517,104,2/6/2011,4.0,You know  this is another bar restaurant  but I actually like this one. I think because they keep the bar area more separate  and give the same amount of focus to the restaurant area. They are definitely a lot more family friendly. When I've been here  I've gotten a sandwich  and the shrimp alfredo - both were really good. I've had their famed Pizookie too  and I can see why people are such a big fan of it. For me personally  I kind of start to panic when my ice cream is melting and I don't like cookies too much..But BJ's is always a solid dining experience for me - I've never gotten any bad service. Except maybe the time they didn't return my 4 cents in change after I paid  but apparently a lot of restaurants do this. I don't know why  because it's still MY 4 cents  and if I wanted to leave it as a tip I would do so AFTER I get it back first!
Danielle S.,Tustin  CA,18,16,24,5/15/2013,4.0,I went here for Mother's Day brunch  the food was good  had their baked Italian omelets  nothing special. in general I wouldn't go back for breakfast  rather go to a place that had endless mimosas
Mooki x.,Irvine  CA,0,331,2,10/14/2014,3.0,We had to wait a little while but that was ok. The service was just ok. Not sure if it was because it was crowded or just didn't have a great server. Ok place if you want loud atmosphere but be prepared to wait.
Michal T.,Tustin  CA,310,65,6,1/28/2011,5.0,This review is for the last time I went here.The server was a bit of the shy type  but definitely knew his beer and the little hints and facts he gave us were definitely appreciated. The beer recommendation was also solid advice.As per usual  I ordered an off-menu item  which they were more than happy to make  to my enduring gratitude.Simply put  this place is always awesome. I love coming here and whenever I'm back home of if I find a BJs near me  I will not hesitate to take a group of friends with me for a night of good food and drinks.Cheers!
Kimberly S.,Irvine  CA,0,2,5,6/20/2013,1.0,"HORRIBLE!!! WORSE PLACE TO GO TO!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND IF YOU WANT TO GO AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHAT YOU EAT! A FLY in my drink!! AND I DIDN\'T HEAR A SINGLE APOLOGIZE FROM ANYONE.!!! They were RUDE about it and obviously just wanted to take that drink from me ASAP to ""clean"" up the mess... Just came back from a late dinner and had the WORSE service...ruined my day... NEVER want to go back to this nasty place.Went in after 9pm. Not that many people so waited less than 2 mins. to be seated. Our table was messy and our seats were all wet... Had to clean it myselfOrdered a drink and some starters.. they came out fast.. but no plates. So I asked my waiter when she walked by for some plates..what does she do?? Doesn\'t even answer me and immediately goes to this other waiter and orders him to give us plates.. it\'s fine.. I don\'t care. I got my plates.. I was about to eat when I see that my starts were CONTAMINATED. the Dishes were not washed completely and I had some residue on my water cup as well!!! Wait wait... but this is the highlight. Fly in my drink. I told my waiter that there was a fly in my drink  again she doesn\'t say anything and just takes it away! then this other waiter comes and just asks  ""Do you want another or no?"" WHAT??!?!!no apologies. nothing. I\'m done with this place."
John K.,Irvine  CA,61,14,2,4/30/2013,4.0,The pulled pork and the pizookies are the best. It's a great family restaurant and bar. Enjoyed watching games on tv here with friends and family.
Sean C.,Upland  CA,75,6,,3/19/2011,3.0,"I was initially gonna give this place 2 stars  but I reminded myself that BJ\'s is a chain and it\'s not their fault if they don\'t serve high quality food all the time. Keep in mind that this is just a review on the items that I had during my visit and is not a review of its entire menu.Pros: The wait staff was amazing. I know this is hard to believe for some people  but we were taken care pretty well by our waiter. We initially had 6 people in a booth  but several of our friends showed up and we managed to fit 10. Despite it being a busy friday night  our waiters helped us accommodate for our larger party size. I found this quite nice that they brought us more chairs and they didn\'t seem to mind that we were spilling into the aisles. Our glasses were kept full of water during our entire meal. The waiters were polite and timely with our orders and they accommodated with our several credit cards at the end (all of which is probably not new to most of you who have eaten at restaurant chains).Anyways  the real reason why we\'re here  the FOOD. Ok  honestly the best thing I had were the fries and they weren\'t even mine! I know you\'re probably just thinking ""it\'s only fries...."" but I\'m very picky with my food and I love when the little things are done right. The fries were great because it had a great crisp and crunch on the outside and the taste of mash potatoes on the inside. Perfectly salted and great with or without ketchup.Now on to what I had for dinner  DO NOT get the jambalaya. If you\'re gonna go to BJ\'s just stick with their pizza! A little overpriced  but their pizza is definitely what they\'re known for (although that\'s not saying much). Anyways  my jambalaya was unbelievably salty! The spice level was good (I expect as much when ordering jambalaya)  but everything else was either bland or salty. There was no flavor balance and that\'s what killed the dish. The amount of food was decent  but given that you\'re paying 15 bucks that\'s not saying much.I also had their pazookie for dessert. It was good  but honestly I think you can save yourself a couple bucks and make it yourself. Baking cookies and buying ice cream to put on top isn\'t very hard.Overview:Pros: staff 4 starsCons: Jambalaya 2 stars      Fries 3.5 stars"
Winnie T.,Los Angeles  CA,111,332,21,6/18/2010,4.0,Bjs Restaurant & Brewhouse holds a special place in my heart. It's the go-to place for my cousins and I when we get together for holidays or have a break from school/jobs.. Anyway  we had a party of five and came to this Bjs for the lakers game 6 this past week  and had a great time. We came an hour early to grab seats at the bar before it got TOO crowded for the game. The bar was already full  but a nice lady had a few friends who canceled on her and offered us one of the two tables she was saving.Happy hour at Bjs is 4-7p  and wine is half off on Tuesdays...perfect! Half off mini-pizzas  two bucks off appetizers and a dollar off cocktails. We got some refillable sodas  the mediterrenean mini pizza (my FAV)  southwestern mini pizza  mini pizookies  and a couple glasses of wine. Service was great- waiter came by every ten minutes or so to check up on us even though the place was nasty packed. Our friend's pizza took a while to arrive  so it was comp'd. A tiny fly decided to go swimming in my wine glass halfway through  and they replaced that quickly. Refills came quick and food was delicious.Line was out the door  as hopeful late-birds waited for seats to open. I'm sure on a non-game day it's not as hectic  but I'd definitely come here again to take advantage of the happy hour menu :)
Janice K.,Cerritos  CA,0,3,,10/6/2011,4.0,I love BJ's.I particularly love the ambiance. The lighting is just right and the noise level is also just right.However  the customer service is kind of iffy. But  it's not all that bad. Out of all the BJ's I've eaten at  I enjoyed my dinner the most at this particular one. Especially because I LOVE the bruschetta and I've seriously ordered this dish at EVERY restaurant that actually has it on the menu...Therefore  i know what I'm talking about....So basically  what I'm trying to get at  is that this BJ's is pretty darn consistent with everything. Definitely try out this place...plus  the happy hour is pretty amazing.#loyal customer
Jay W.,Fountain Valley  CA,0,12,2,9/28/2014,5.0,Omgosh! Devin can sing happy birthday in FRENCH! I am sooo impressed!  she didn't have to or even want to sing to my friend but she really took care of us and went above and beyond the call! Thank you Devin and thanks to BJ'S for hiring such a fun person !
Anne M.,Deerfield Beach  FL,24,274,4,9/7/2010,3.0,Why  why can't I like this place? Seriously  even with my super lenient Irvine rating scale I can't find it in myself to give this place more than three stars. My friends love BJ's so once again I'm Debbie Downer who reluctantly has to sit through another meal here.So it's a pizza place but the pizza is a strange foccacia  deep dish  CPKesque concoction. I really don't like how bready and greasy it is  but clearly I'm the minority. So I've tried lots of other things on the menu...giant stuffed baked potato with chicken in Alfredo sauce  sandwiches  pasta  soup. Pretty much everything other than pizza. Thus far  I have only found one menu item worth mentioning and it deserves mentioning in a big way  the PIZZOKIE! Here's something that can't go wrong. Cookie dough baked in a pizza pan served pipping hot with a scoop of ice cream. So after years of trying menu items that have been all but pleasing  I've finally learned to skip dinner and go strait to Pizzokie!This place is always packed so be prepared to wait. The outside patio is a nice alternative and they have generous heat lamps so it's comfortable year round.
Daniel M.,Laguna Beach  CA,0,13,,10/31/2014,2.0,II Never order take out  always online. But  I was between my office and home so didn't have the chance. Wtf  Terrible service  already triple the wait time they told me when I ordered. And  the staff has a whatever attitude about there lack of service. If the food wasn't worth it  I'd walk.
Gustavo C.,Orange  CA,1,13,,7/15/2013,5.0,Recently brought my wife for her birthday here. Wow did we get full and didnt even finish our food. Correction! I did  but I was helping her finish her large spaghetti plate. The pizookie is awesome!! The waiter was attentive and quick. The staff were all over trying to get those orders out there  turning tables. Overall  for my first experience at bj's. it was great
Sergio B.,Riverside  CA,54,3,2,5/4/2011,1.0,The service here was horrible! They called us for our table but it wasnt even ready yet. We had to awkwardly standing in the middle of the dining room while they finished getting it ready.Our server took our drink order and never came back. It took forever to order. She forgot about us. We saw her take the order for people who came in after we did. By the time she came over  she gave us attitude. Like it was our fault she hadnt taken our order. They got our order wrong twice. The turkey burger came out a regular beef patty. The peanut butter pazookie came out a chocolate chip. If you have a choice  dont come here!
Samantha N.,San Jose  CA,94,60,9,8/21/2010,3.0,"Meh. I don\'t get why everyone orgasms over the pizookie. It\'s a warm cookie underneath some ice cream. It\'s good  but it\'s not like ""omgwtfbbq!!"" good.Anyway our waitress was terrible. She was incredibly s-l-o-wwww. My drink was empty for like 20 minutes before she came and refilled it. I drink lots and it\'s not like it was just water. She was also VERY slow at giving us our bill and picking up our check. I would say it took her 10 minutes from the time she gave it to us til the time she picked it up. We were ready for her to pick it up within a minute of her dropping it off. It wasn\'t even busy. She was probably just lollygagging around in the back. The pizzas looked good  but I didn\'t order it. I got the fettuccine alfredo  which was alright.This place is just meeeh. I wouldn\'t go back."
Lynn D.,Irvine  CA,0,25,,3/23/2014,2.0,The food is mediocre. I've gotten the ahi poke many times but it's always a hit and miss sometimes being way too salty. At this location our server was extremely rude. I felt like I was not wanted there. I got out as soon as I could.
Sher M.,Orange  CA,187,57,15,1/7/2013,5.0,Im giving this particular restaurant 5 starts solely on their customer service! My friend and I went here for dinner  my friend felt faint and started getting really sick. One of the hostess noticed and she took it upon herself to make sure my friend was ok  they got us seated right away  brought her food and water. They constantly check on us throughout the night. They were so helpful and so nice/caring. Many of the employees where checking on us all night  a couple managers  chef  and servers. I was very impressed!
Faris M.,Irvine  CA,5,3,,6/26/2011,4.0,BJ's in Irvine is located at a very nice location. The ambience and feel there are very comfortable and cheerful.The food is here is among the best you can get as far as casual dining goes. Whenever you come into this place  you MUST order their Chicago style pizza. It is amazing.
John C.,San Francisco  CA,381,183,4,12/22/2010,3.0,I chose BJ's for our group dinner because I've had many positive experiences from other locations. When we walked into the waiting area  someone was serving sample pieces of pizza  which was pretty awesome. However  the service the rest of the night wasn't that great.Some of my complaints include:- There were different versions of the menu printed  so when I ordered a taster of 4 of their beers  the ones I got were different from what I was expecting (they took care of it  so it's not a huge deal  but still...)- We had to constantly ask for more plates/silverware because our waitress hadn't brought the proper amount out; she wasn't very quick about remedying the issue- My cousin ordered a kid's pizzookie for her son  which cost $1.95; all the adults wanted one of the same size; the waitress said they could do it  but they would each cost $2.95. What a farce! We get the same product as the kid  but we get charged more for it!?I've had good experiences with the BJ's chain before  so I don't want to knock it too much  but this particular location wasn't very good in terms of service.
Maria S.,Orange  CA,0,10,,10/10/2014,1.0,My family attended this restuarant for a bday party. We were sat in the outside area and the noise was moderate to bad. The server was overwhelmed and after about 25 miins she got our drink order  she arrived back approx 10 mins later with the drinks ordered and my guiness drink which was just black zero cream head as is per usual. I remarked on the Guinness drink and she responded that 'oh the bartender said we are having a problem with the gas!' I declined that drink and asked for a beer which again arrived delayed and was completely flat so I accepted it anyway. When the food finally arrived one of my daughters was incorrect and my meal never arrived. She finally brought my meal out when we were awaiting our bill and I said well I am not going to eat it now but she did offer a take-out box!!!!The restaurant seemed like a disorgnized mess....I did write a letter of complaint and they never even responded...so we will not be returning
Denny B.,La Mirada  CA,29,102,5,11/7/2012,4.0,I only get the ribeye steak here. Its nothing special  but pretty good. Everytime I order  the steak comes out how I want it.
Holley L.,Richmond  VA,122,141,131,7/25/2012,5.0,Went for lunch  great appetizer specials! I'm not really a beer person but my friend suggested I should try one. I asked the waitress what she would recommend  what she thought would be the most like blue moon. She recommended the Nit Wit  a lighter beer  I surprisingly really liked it. I ordered the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad  it was delicious! My friend ordered the avocado egg rolls and the ahi poke. The egg roles were to die for  especially that sauce! I'm not a fan of ahi...but she said it was phenomenal.     Our waitress was really good  our drinks were filled the whole time and she was very attentive. The other BJs I've been to have lacked in customer service  but not this one :). Maybe I will go for dinner and see if it's the same  hopefully it is! As always  the pazookie...ohhhh the pazookie. Favorite Thing Ever! The pazookie never fails  if all else fails  just order the pazookie and all will be right with the world haha. Highly recommend!
Steve L.,Costa Mesa  CA,4,92,2,3/27/2013,2.0,Slowest service I've ever experienced in a upscale place. 20 minutes for waitress to take our order after being seated  and another 20 for food. On a lunch hour this is HORRIBLE. Btw we showed up at 1:00PM
Kevin C.,Irvine  CA,0,30,,7/30/2013,3.0,Solid choice for a casual night out.First Impressions: The place can get pretty busy for dinners  like 30-45 min wait kind of busy  but if you wait it out it's worth it  because even when it's a packed house  service doesn't suffer and food times don't slow down much  if at all. During lunch it's much more relaxed. Service: Never had a bad experience here. Friendly  knowledgeable and attentive.Food: The pizza. I've had their burgers  pastas and a handful of other apps and entrees and they've all been tasty  but the pizza is something special  especially with the tomato topping. Definitely one of my favorites around town. Add to that a solid selection of beers (the house beers aren't bad either) and you're in for a good time.Oh  and l'm not really a dessert guy  but the pizookie is too good. Not only is it delicious but the contrast of hot cookie with cold ice cream is very intriguing.
Michael C.,Las Vegas  NV,39,249,17,8/29/2010,4.0,Had the chicken fried steak  delicious. Service is great  and the prices are right. Although I don't drink anymore  I have had the stout here  a beer smoothie as I like to call it  and it is outstanding. Very flavorful and will give you a buzz in a hurry.
Heidi M.,Irvine  CA,69,8,,3/20/2011,3.0,Pizookie  pizookie  wherefore art thou pizookie?Man  I love those things. Have you ever had one? It's like heaven in a little dish. On the seventh day  God rested  and had a pizookie. I'm serious.I should probably tell ya'll what exactly a pizookie IS. Because chances are  if you're reading this  you have not been to BJ's and therefore have not had a pizookie. You have also not yet lived. A pizookie is a thick  hot  melted  chewy  cookie in a little pan with ice cream on top. I know  it sounds like any standard dessert  right? WRONG WRONG WRONG!I don't know what they do. I don't know WHY it is just so good. But it is. You can choose from Macadamia nut  chocolate chip  brownie  and oreo cookies  and chocolate or vanilla bean ice cream. They are all just so fantastic. I know it's just a cookie and ice cream  but I can't help but express my love in this overly extravagant form. My family and I shared a white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookie pizookie with vanilla ice cream and a brownie cookie pizookie with chocolate ice cream. The cookies oozed chocolate and were perfectly hot and delicious  and the ice cream was creamy and complimented them perfectly. YUM.The restaurant in general  however  is pretty meh. It is a chain. It is known for its overpriced but fairly tasty pizza and beer. The service is actually quite fantastic; our waiter was super friendly and prompt with his service. Still  the food is pretty generic  and overall the restaurant itself is a little more buck than bang. I ordered the Mozzarella Salad for my appetizer  which is this quaint little salad with lots of delicious mozzarella balls  tomato chunks  and thickened balsamic vinegar drizzled on top of a lettuce leaf. I love the firm  smooth texture of the cheese and how the tangy but sweet balsamic vinegar compliments it. The tomatoes also add to the tang  and the lettuce leaf gives it some crunch. I love this tiny salad  which is the perfect size for me  and it's only three dollars!As my entree I ordered the California Chicken sandwich  which consisted of lean  grilled chicken breast  tomato  avocado  garlic mayo  lettuce  and garlicky white bread. They were a little stingy with the chicken  which was also a bit bland; it could have been spiced a little better. There was a PERFECT amount of avocado  however  and its creamy nuttiness definitely saved the sandwich. The tomato and lettuce were fresh and crisp  and the mayo was a nice garlicky touch. And the bread was fantastic. They took white bread slices  toasted them  and added some butter and garlic  which really made it tasty. Overall  it was a decent  rather good sandwich  though at eleven dollars it was a tad pricey.Now  for the french fries. I love thin french fries  so I heartily enjoyed these. They were crispy  and I'm sure they were fried to death  but they were so tasty. A little ketchup and ranch  and I was in heaven. They were spiced well  so they were also delicious without any sauces.The menu itself is fairly limited to generic American food. The calorie contents are displayed on the menu  which I suppose is nice for calorie counters but the fact of the matter is that people don't go out to eat in order to watch their physiques. I found the calorie contents quite off- putting; it's hard to enjoy your food when you're worried about the damage you're doing to your butt. Do us a favor  BJ's  keep your caloric information available  but only upon request. It does not help you to have it right on your menu  especially since the numbers are HORRIFYING. I really should work out tonight.....All in all  BJ's is a solid place. It's not great  but not bad. And it's a wee bit overpriced  but you can't really avoid that if you're eating out. Go ahead and give it a go if you're near the Tustin Marketplace  which is a great location. Just try not to wince at the caloric information. Honestly  I think from now on I'm just going to go to order dessert  and I won't need to look at the menu to know what I want :)
Brett I.,Anaheim  CA,0,20,,9/30/2014,1.0,What once was a premier eating establishment has now become mediocre  due to the malaise of the management. There was such a feeling of discontent on our last visit  my family has decided to take our business elsewhere.
Arnold W.,Irvine  CA,709,1575,987,8/20/2010,3.0,First time I came here back in college was about oh 8 years ago...it was really delicious!! The salmon was juicy and fatty  huge baked potatoes. But ever since I've been here  it's a hit or miss! Sometimes it's good  sometimes it's just okay. The food is okay here. The good thing about this place is that they're great for large groups!
c s.,Orange  CA,3,53,16,6/29/2014,1.0,Rough night tonight. Really slow service  took 25+ minutes for 2 pizzas  fish tacos and a kids meal. Wanted dessert but didn't feel like waiting another hour for them to make a cookie. Even had a coupon for the free pizoookie. Waiters seemed clueless about how to handle unhappy customers. Food wasn't even that good. Pizza needed more sauce and my tacos were flavorless. As I said rough night. Oh did I mention its about to get worse since they just sat 30 high school age soccer players with huge appetites. Kitchens gonna freak!
Brooke S.,Costa Mesa  CA,0,7,,9/25/2014,4.0,Everytime I go here  I sit at the bartops because is it self seating and the servers are pretty aware whenever you sit down. Service is always great  and the food is nothing to complain about either. Their pizza is to die for and you can't leave without their signature pizookies!
James A.,Tustin  CA,15,1,,8/19/2014,5.0,I come here all the time after work. Late night is the best! My favorite servers are Deven and Bradi. They always take care of me with my picky orders and always get it right. When going to other BJ's I don't get the same level of service as I do here. I go out of my way to come to this one for the service!
Stephen J.,Westminster  CA,0,15,,9/20/2014,5.0,Food was great and service was even better.. we were a large party but Amy  our server  handled it like we were a party of two.  We all had a great experience. .. highly recommend.
Chris G.,Los Angeles  CA,99,6,,6/21/2014,1.0,"I took my wife and our friend Brea out on a date tonight. We normally love BJs but tonight was another story. We ordered appetizers and drinks and the night started off great. Then we all ordered our food and that\'s where the normal pleasant experience ended. I ordered a pizza  my wife ordered a pizza with no onion and no mushroom  our friend ordered an Ahi Tuna salad. When the food finally ""arrived"" my pizza was perfect  Brea received an Asian salad  and no pizza for my wife. We sent back the Asian salad and asked for my wife\'s pizza. They then delivered a poke salad to Brea and a pizza WITH onion & mushroom for my wife. We sent those back and then Brea received ANOTHER poke salad. Once we sent THAT back Brea finally got her Ahi salad that she ordered. While she was eating it  another Ahi salad showed up... My wife  then got her pizza STILL with mushrooms. Our waitress  Mia (?)  who said she was new  called her manager stupid at one point and insinuated that one of coworkers was suffering from ""old age"". Another manager stopped by and told us the meals would be covered. My wife FINALLY got the pizza she ordered  after 2 hours! The ONLY pleasant thing about this visit was Nikki  another waitress (not even our waitress) who kept stopping by to make sure we were ok. Mia should shadow and train with Nikki... PLEASE ask for Nikki or her bf Craig (he works there too and is great) if you decide to eat at BJs!"
Kimberly C.,Aliso Viejo  CA,17,41,4,12/28/2009,3.0,After being shamed by my 12 year old family friend for never having been to BJs  our families finally decided to hit it up while all of us were home for the holidays. I would describe it as a beer drinker's Cheesecake Factory. The menu is HUGE  and it has lots of photos too  which always wins me over. Each of us had something different but none of them were anything to write home about. I had a turkey burger  but wasn't blown out the water (the cheese wasn't even melted!) The game changer here was definitely the Pizookie (sp?)  which definitely lived up to the hype. The cookie was super gooey and just the right amount of sweet. We were fighting for every last bite  and scraped the pan clean! So maybe all 7 of us ordered the wrong thing? Doubtful  but overall it was a nice place to be with family  with a delicious dessert to top it off.
Brian G.,Irvine  CA,0,7,,6/27/2013,1.0,Let me first start by saying I love BJ's food and have never had an unpleasant experience other than at this location in Irvine. And let me add that I have had SEVERAL unpleasant experiences here.First off  the wait time is UNBEARABLE. And unless you go at 10:30 PM you can expect to wait AT LEAST 45 each time if not more. And they look at you when they tell you the wait time as if they're doing YOU a favor. This is a chain restaurant. I am certainly not going to wait that long for a chain restaurant. There is no recognition at this location that anything is amiss. I say skip it! It's not worth the frustration.
CA R.,Orange County  CA,155,146,23,9/18/2012,5.0,Came here for dinner tonight and it was soooooo good! Elise served us and she was so attentive and friendly. Ours salads and pizza were awesome and the triple chocolate pizookie was ahhhhmazing. We can't wait to come back again - the best part.... the entire dinner was $20! Really great value and quality and a great location in the Irvine Marketplace
Karen K.,Mission Viejo  CA,1,26,,12/30/2011,2.0,I was disappointed the last time at BJ's service was not good. It took the waiter a long time to come to our table. It was very noisy and hard to hear our conversation. I feel that BJ's is not as good as it used to be. Were they perhaps taken over by new owers?? Karen K.
Alena V.,Tustin  CA,4,41,,2/23/2010,3.0,"BJ\'s is a pretty good choice for dinner and drinks with friends. Their food is consistent  their beer is pretty good (I like the Nutty Brewnette  the Porter  and the Red)  and they have a ""secret"" menu of specials near the back of the big fat menu. These specials are served ALL DAY EVERYDAY and make eating here very affordable. You can get the SAME mini pizza as on the regular menu for multiple dollars less. Or you can get half of the giant baked potato with a salad/soup for $6.95! What $6.95?!?!?! Yes  less than 7 American dollars. whoa. And the giant baked potato is truly giant. Even half is way more than I can ever eat and it is GOOD. Also they have the Pizookie. yes  the Pizookie. You may feel ridiculous ordering it but it\'s warm  gooey  and very tasty. So why only 3 stars? Even though it\'s plenty good nothing stands out. Also the wait on just any old night (even mid-week) can be pretty long. And when it gets busy the service invariably slips. And many people are bringing you items  taking orders- sometimes they don\'t communicate with each other and you don\'t get what you want."
Myung S.,Artesia  CA,308,220,1433,3/29/2010,4.0,I don't know what they did recently but the quality of everything went up couple of notches especially food. I love their Cajun Pasta. Clam Chowder is always good too. My compliments to the head chef! Great work and thanks for good food.
Romey B.,Costa Mesa  CA,47,42,11,6/28/2014,1.0,"Appetizers were served at least 10 minutes apart. We had to wait a long time for our drinks. The kicker was when I ordered my burger with a Wheat bun. The waiter never explained to me that the restaurant was out of wheat buns until he served the food. Even then  he placed my burger on the table  said ""sorry we are out of wheat buns so we have wheat bread""  and walked away. If I wanted a beef patty on a sandwich  then I wouldn\'t order a burger. On the bright side  those avocado eggrolls are still amazing. Can I eat this without the sloppy service. I used to go to BJ\'s in Westwood all the time while I was a student. Service is much better at that location."
Michael B.,Anaheim  CA,110,85,6,10/25/2012,4.0,Amazing salad was so yummy. U have got to try the BBQ salad. Then finished it off with a nice warm cookie and ice cream. The tropical tea is refreshing as well. Love this place. Server was spot on and amazing.
Selea S.,Los Angeles  CA,259,41,40,11/29/2012,5.0,ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESTAURANTS EVER!!!! I seriously love this place so much and it just reminds me of home. I definitely recommend getting the barbeque chicken deep dish pizza. That's my fav. And also the grilled chicken pasta and of course the chocolate chip pizookie! Go here  you won't regret it!
Kyrk S.,Burlingame  CA,191,203,18,11/9/2009,4.0,"""I like pizza  I like bagels  I like hot dogs with mustard and beer  I\'ll eat eggplant  I could even eat a baby deer."" - Homer SimpsonI may go to same fancy places  but deep down I\'m a simple guy. I like  no love  pizza and beer. So BJ\'s is a no brainer to me. Their thick  bready  well-seasoned crust is so bomb with just the right amount of oil and flavor to complement their toppings. Add to the aforementioned delicious pizza a wide selection of beers and you got a recipe for one happy Kyrk. But pretty much everybody knows that these are facts  the only reason I feel this BJ\'s deserves a review is that they seem to have better service than the rest. Most BJ\'s are  in general  decently friendly  although some can be very ""take your order  deliver order  ask how it is once  then deliver check"" with not much pleasantness. At this one the employees seem to be much more engaging and nice without being intrusive or slow. Not only that  when I came here for my 21st  they let me take a dish bucket home in case my I had to gloriously yack out my drunken dinner. Definitely a proud moment for me hehe...but in my experience most places just give you a crappy plastic bag and send you on your drunken way...not that I\'ve done that......So yeah  this BJ\'s knows what\'s up. Friendly and cool people working there along with bomb pizza and beer."
Traci F.,Newport Beach  CA,266,9,3,6/20/2014,2.0,Went here to celebrate my birthday with some friends. The server seemed to be kind not there. The food was great. I noticed the server was telling her other tables she was handing over the table to another server  which is cool. I'm a server too  I get it. But she decided to keep us. I was still eating dinner when she took our dessert order (which I thought was odd) I figure she would at least wait until I was done with my food before she sent it out. Next thing you know I turn around and they are shoving a pazookie in my face while I have chicken in my mouth. I was only half way on my entree. I can honestly say from server to server  even if I am in a hurry  or want to go home  I would never send out a dessert while someone is clearly still eating dinner or even make guests feel rushed. It was blatantly obvious she wanted us to hurry the hell up so she could get on with her life. Awesome. Happy birthday to me :/
Brittani B.,Irvine  CA,0,14,,3/19/2012,2.0,"I came here with my best friend on Saturday. I was extremely excited to come especially once I saw the stuffed baked potatoes.We started off with 2 appetizers. First was the Spinach Artichoke Dip.I have never in my life disliked any Spinach Artichoke Dip  Never! This was by far the worst. I believe it\'s due to the Alfredo Sauce they use. It\'s insanely bland and really has no flavor at all. Then we had the Chicken Wraps:These were actually really good. Nice crisp lettuce and the hot mustard sauce hits you like Wasabi. It MUST have wasabi in it because nothing clears my sinuses like Wasabi. It was great!Next I had a ""Wedge Salad""Now let me say.....I have NEVER disliked Blue Cheese....NEEVER! It was so gross. It was sweet...and tasted nothing like blue cheese. It also had some type of green seasoning in it...Again...I was disappointed. Then out came my Entree....Chicken Alfredo:silly me  I should have known to change my order once I tried the Spinach Artichoke Dip.This meal was horrible to say the least. It tasted like.....nothing.....it\' really had no taste at all. It was a flavorless sauce  with flavorless noodles  flavorless broccoli and four tiny pieces of chicken. I was going to suck it up and eat it....but then I thought to myself....I paid way too much for this to have to force myself to eat it. So I sent it back and ordered something else. The General Manager came over  he was VERY nice and approachable. I explained my concerns about the flavorless Fettuccine and my issues with the salad. He brought me out a Bacon Cheeseburger and took the Entree and Salad off of my tab. He did what he could to make it right.But of course ONE last jab...my thoughtful best friend waited for me to get my food before she ate....she ordered her Burger WELL DONE....and it came out bloody....so now here I am with my food....and she is waiting for hers...At this point....the baked potatoes that had my mouth watering in the first place....wasn\'t even an option anymore....I wasn\'t in the mood for anymore disappointments.It became so insane that we just ended up laughing about it.....never will we come here again....but it was kind of funny."
gene d.,Irvine  CA,301,359,141,1/6/2010,3.0,Where to start? I've been here many times for birthday dinners  dates  and even just for desserts or beer & football. The food is pretty consistent  but depending on how busy they are  the service can go down (which forced me to give 3 and not 4 stars). One time  the waiter got two orders correct  but had the sides on the wrong plate. And I've had to try and track down my waiter once for more drinks. But then there has been other nights when everything is perfect and the waiter is there for everything (was a mid week dinner). If you go on weekends  be patient and just enjoy the food.As for the food  they pretty much have something for anyone and they are happy to make substitutions as well (salad for fries  rice instead of pasta  etc.). Lots of good appetizers (lettuce warps  wings and beer)  sandwiches (meat loaf is a winner)  baked potato (all of them superb)  chicken (sometimes on the dry side)  ribs (really tasty)  and of course their deep dish signature pizzas. The crust is well seasoned and the toppings are very fresh. Oh  and can't end a night without their much copied pizookie (a large scoop of ice cream onto a warm soft and chewy cookie). Yum...
Moises M.,Tustin  CA,124,180,82,12/5/2011,3.0,Come here for there happy hour deals. They have half off their mini pizzas (fatty greasy goodness)  $1 off beers all while the games are on. If your a NFL fan they have there deals going as long as a game is on  which is practically an entire Sunday. What mainly brings me here is their beer  a wide varied all brewed in California and distributed throughout the locations. My favorite is the Tatonka stout  it's creamy smooth coffee/ bitter dark chocolate taste that some say is a tad sweet  but it tickles my fancy. The there's their Harvest Hefeweizen  crisp citrusy with light hoppy night that lingers. Both are great beginner beers that I must recommend.
Tracy G.,Irvine  CA,0,12,,7/10/2014,5.0,Thai Shrimp lettuce wraps were very good. My husband had the Mahi Mahi and my son had a deep dish pizza - all very good service by Brady was great and food was fast and hot.
Diana A.,Huntington Beach  CA,166,28,1,8/23/2012,3.0,Hubby and I ventured out of HB for a date night. Staff wass ranging from really nice to rude. The giant baked potato with veggies I ordered was delicious even though there were hardly any veggies on it. My husband ordered the Jambalaya and it was so spicy I thought he was about to bursdt into flames and I choked when I took a bite. The pazookie was to die for of course.
DOUGLAS K.,Tustin  CA,0,30,4,1/22/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"Just got take out  order number 319153. I ordered a small classic combo pizza(sausage  pepperoni  and mushrooms) and specifically entered a special request online for pizza to be well done and a small salad with Italian dressing(w/ carrots  cucumbers  tomatoes  shaved Parmesan and croutons). Picked it up at take out counter and cashier confirmed my order  I agreed and he politely put it in a take out bag. I had to ask for a fork  napkins and Parmesan cheese packets. Isn\'t it just good service if he asked if I needed any of these instead of just handing me a bag and a receipt? Manager problem. Well  stupid me for trusting the cook and the cashier and not checking my order before I got home. I open up my salad and there are no carrots  tomatoes or cucumbers and very little lettuce. Oh well  I think  I\'m hungry so I just ate it. Then  I open up my pizza and notice that half the pizza is just cheese  there is only one slice of pepperoni on the entire pizza with a few small mushroom slices and a few pieces of sausage on half of the pizza and it was not crispy nor cooked well done as I requested. Again  stupid me for trusting their competence and that they actually care about quality and a positive customer experience. Again  a Manager problem. So  I call BJs in Irvine and speak to a Manager named Chuck to reiterate my frustration and dissatisfaction as described above. Chuck immediately goes into his trained managerial corporate lingo and actually says ""Sounds like you got the wrong pizza."" Really Chuck? Monday night at 8:30pm? Really? How bout this Chuck? How bout you and the other corporate bean counter managers get out of your office and get your eyes on your kitchen and wait staff to confirm service and quality are consistently being delivered? Just a bunch of sense of entitlement HS and College kids who work here with no work ethic  not a clue on what customer service means  it\'s just a playtime workplace. And  really no difference in the Manager\'s competence. So  keep counting your beans  watch your sales and stock price continue to drop and try to figure why your customers are not returning. You won\'t  instead you\'ll just find a way to decrease the portions and quality and increase your prices. I\'m done. Never again! America  Stay with your local owner operated businesses. Boycott the corporate restaurants! They only care about their profits  not your experience or value received."
The O.,Tustin  CA,0,36,2,10/16/2011,2.0,We've been coming to this location for years and have had decent service. The last visit  however  was a different story. A large group of us went for a weekday lunch. It was quiet when we arrived  and we still had to wait to get seated. Our appetizer plates had caked-on food still on them  one-third of us had meals that were not what we ordered  and service was extremely slow. When we asked for the manager  he was borderline rude to us. Our waitress did the best she could. She apologized  and comp-ed us on the messed up items and threw in the desserts. We certainly won't be returning here for a group lunch.
clark n.,Costa Mesa  CA,3,24,2,1/13/2011,3.0,It's me again.. 3 criteria (crowd  service  food)I went in during a sunday because that's when they have their game day happy hour the whole day.. $2 off drafts  half off all shareable appetizers & 1/2 off mini pizzas (of course only in bar area). The crowd was fun & family oriented. We got lucky with our seats but it wasn't too packed to find available tables. The service was good  not excellent- we had to ask twice for some things. We ordered many mini pizzas (my fav was bj favorite  cheeseburger pizza- they also had BBQ chicken  & some flat bread pizzas too)  the calamari (delish- ask for extra marinara sauce.. A must)  and of course to end a meal their pozookie (my fav was white chocolate cookie with cookies & cream ice cream). If u haven't been here ya gotta give it a try!!
Gabrielle G.,Menifee  CA,55,101,69,7/14/2012,5.0,This particular BJs has the best service out of all of them. The service in Temecula is consistently terrible and the two in the Huntington Beach area are always so crowded and busy that it affects the service. I love their deep dish pizzas and Caesar salad. Their tomato bisque has always been a lunch favorite too.
Lisa N.,Los Angeles  CA,688,702,179,8/18/2009,2.0,"this BJs location is pretty spacious. it was able to accommodate our large party. that\'s the only thing i REALLY liked here. other then that  it\'s your typical  busy  hustlin and bustlin kinda place. crowded  loud  chill atmosphere. the service was..well  it wasn\'t horrible  but it definitely could have been better. i realize it\'s hard to serve a big party and it was a busy night  but..i don\'t know  for a big location like that  hire more workers or something! it took a LONG time for them to actually come around and take our orders...no  we don\'t want to order appetizers  but can\'t we just order our food already then? not wait another 20+mins before you come back and take entree orders. i ordered the chicken and ribs combo  only to be told about 15mins later that they\'re ""out of chicken and ribs."" well  which one was out? the chicken or the ribs?!? err. that kinda sucked. i don\'t think i\'ve had many experiences at restaurants where they run out of a certain food...esp not if it\'s a big chain restaurant like that. ahh. my bf and i opted for a bbq chicken pizza and a giant baked potato. bbq chicken pizza is really nothing super special. yeah  it\'s good  but nothing extraordinary. definitely not worth paying $14 for a small one. it wasn\'t as crispy as i usually like...=( guess deep dish pizzas aren\'t for me.classic giant baked potato was good  but again  nothing extraordinary. definitely something you can make at home  and again  bacon was not crispy. sniff* i love crispy. chocolate chip pizookie was heavenly  deliciousss as usual  but again  not something too difficult to make home..it\'s a nestle toll house cookie with vanilla ice cream. not worth whatever we paid for it. and if you drink here  just opt for a pitcher  only $14. it\'s a better value than just getting a glass. i wish they had more beers on tap though  like other ""regular"" ones. i know they brew their own beers and all  but i\'m not adventurous. i\'d like a pitcher of blue moon with my food  not some unknown beer that i might not like."
Tiffany D.,Costa Mesa  CA,229,425,54,5/30/2009,1.0,Ick. Ew. Blargh. Growdy.Run for the hills!! Run like you stole something!I actually haven't been back to this place in over a year- that is how bad this god forsaken place is. :PLast I went the service was HORRIBLE  with a capital HORRIBLE.The waitress was a biiiizzzzatch. Mean little cooo---unt. Food was way late  I was dying of thirst.. I stopped a bus boy and asked for a refill......He comes back after a few minutes.. pour the water in... BAM!... in with my water and lemon is a straw wrapper and bits of food(?).O...M..G... Whatthefuckjusthappened?  That was the last straw (wrapper).  NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER!!NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!! Why do you forsake me food lord?!!?!?!?Granted that may have been the wrong person to ask.. but what the fuck is shitty trash dong in the water refiller thingy?!!??
John O.,Newport Beach  CA,33,230,36,10/24/2009,2.0,Bj's is one of those chains that should be better than it is. Is it the management? I love the menu and most of the restaurants (except the dumpy one in downtown Huntington Beach) are nice.I experienced something at the Marketplace BJ's that I've had happen to me at numerous Bj's  and that is my appetizer and entree came out at almost the same time. Isn't an appetizer supposed to come out BEFORE the entree. And in the case tonight  all we ordered was a salad and bowl of soup -- doesn't that take a couple of minutes to do? But sure enough  after waiting for a little too long  the appetizers came and then a couple of minutes later so did the mini pizzas we ordered.While I love BJ's deep dish pizzas  mine was screwed up. When I got the pizza I noticed a couple of slices of pepperoni on my pizza -- but not so much as to think it was a pepperoni pizza since I had ordered a tomato and cheese and the person I was with actually ordered a pepperoni pizza. When I looked at the bill  indeed TWO pepperoni pizzas had been ordered. So I'm not sure what I got because if that is all the pepperoni they put on a pizza it was laughable. At the same time  I really didn't want pepperoni  just tomato and cheese.This is why I eat out less and cook at home more. Why spend good money for mediocre food and so-so service. Maybe if there were MANAGERs at these places that gave a damn the food and service would be worth while... Oh  and to the white trash in the booth behind me with the little demon seed that couldn't stay put or quiet  get a BABYSITTER next time. Not everyone thinks your brat is cute or interesting!
alli t.,Torrance  CA,11,252,229,5/30/2010,3.0,Today's review is for the takeout  although I've sat down to eat here several times. Take out is just like the sit down food  except it comes in plastic take out containers.Today's order included Santa Fe Spring rolls which have a tiny kick and come w/avacado cream and a spicy Santa Fe dressing  chicken tenders w/bbq sauce  bbq pulled pork sliders (4 to an order)  the bacon cheeseburger pizza and cobb salad. My favorite today was the bbq pulled pork sliders...soft roll  tender pork  bbq sauce plus fried onions.
Paul C.,Irvine  CA,70,12,,8/25/2012,1.0,The food was very bland starting with the steak being overcooked  then the pizza being served cold  and my french dip tasted like leather no matter how much aj jus there was.
Daniel C.,Irvine  CA,0,4,,2/18/2013,5.0,Very good service and food.Had a blast with my family and they made me feel like royalty! A little expensive but well worth it. Will come back soon.
Sher L.,Manhattan Beach  CA,581,179,1489,4/25/2011,1.0,A MUST READ! You'll definitely regret booking a birthday party here. I made reservations here for my bf's bday party. We thought it would be a cool and fun atmosphere and good for all ages since my nephew and his friends were attending and some are just 21 years old and the rest of us are in our early 30's.I had to change the number of guests a few more times than expected as many of our guests weren't prompt with RSVP'ing on the E-vites. Every time I called in to make changes to the number of guests  the rep had to put me on hold for a long time just to get a manager there to verify the bday reservation. So annoying! They also told me that if I was over 15 minutes late  they would give my table away. Unbelievable!.. as I had 15 guests RSVP'ing thus far.When we got there  the place was seriously so packed with literally NO tables available. It was so busy it made the economy look like it was booming again. It had a really nice casual feel but way too loud. The hostess walked us to the patio area where all the birthday reservations were held and I noticed that they broke up my party into two separate rows of 10 seats per table as if a cafeteria style. I was like wtf! How could my guests enjoy each others company if we're all broken up? So I ask our server if he can move the tables together in one straight line and he said there wasn't room for that. He was so reluctant to accommodate us that my guests had to rearrange the tables ourselves.So we all get seated and the waiter takes over 20 minutes to come back for drink orders. I thought I'd start us all off with a double shot of chilled Patron to kick off my bf's bday. 15 minutes go by and drinks arrive. The alcohol was so warm and never even chilled at ALL! I tried to flag our waiter down again to no avail. After another 15 minutes waiting for him to return to the table  he re-appears and I tell him that the shots weren't chilled. He just acted nonchalant and took it back. By now  everyone's so irritated because the wait was so long that most of our guests had already drank their shots. The waiter takes my shot back  has it chilled  and comes back with a bill for my bf. He pleads with us and tells us that he won't be seeing us again and that he's going on a break and asked if we would mind closing the bar tab so he can go. My bf  being the really sweet guy that he is  paid him about $220 cash and another $20 for tip. New waiter comes  takes orders  re-appears after 25 minutes and randomly lays down a bunch of orders on the table and left. So I started asking everyone what they ordered because nothing looked familiar. To my surprise  the waiter only got two guests' orders right and the rest was NOTHING anyone else ordered. At that point I am livid because the waiter disappeared again and I'm looking around trying to see if I can flag ANYONE down to help us. For the last hour  no waiter came by to check on us or ask us if we needed anything. Another 15 minutes go by and he finally returns. We send back all the incorrect orders. An hour later  half my guests are still waiting for soda! Some are just tired of waiting and the other half finally get their food. It was so unbelievable that the waiter disappeared again and didn't even ask anyone if they needed drinks  let alone refills  and or condiments . My guests just gave up at that point  ate whatever was brought to them with or without drinks and or condiments. There I was  spending 90% of my time trying to keep my eyes open to flag a waiter down again for the 25th time! I finally decided to get up and find the manager. I waited about 5 minutes near the cashier's podium and asked our initial waiter for the manager. He immediately asked me if I was going to report him and I said I was reporting the other waiter. Little did he know  had it not been been for the great Facebook group shot he took for us  his ass would be grass too. Manager comes by and I tell him the entire story. All he did was say he was sorry and to call him next time we come again and handed me his business card. I told him I would never come here again and it was the worst service I had ever experienced in my life. It seemed he couldn't care less. Fed up  we just decided to end the night and close the bill. The bill totaled over $300 with a mandatory gratuity of 20% included. When my bf paid cash for the bill he added ANOTHER 20% on the bill without knowing it was already included! It's no wonder NONE of the waiters gave a rats ass.. They were already guaranteed 20% on the bill. Imagine if we actually itemized the bill! There would probably be a ton of orders that wasn't ours. Too bad we didn't discuss the bill until we got home. I thought about calling the manager but I figure it would just create a lot more stress on us and we were just happy to have the nightmare end. We seriously could've had a better experience at Chuck E Cheese's!
Jennifer M.,Tustin  CA,94,12,1,7/9/2014,2.0,I went here 2 nights ago with my boyfriend. We are barely 18 years old were just on a date. The food is always pretty good here with slowish service but friendly waiters/waitresses. However  since the restaurant has gained speed in service  the friendly atmosphere and amazing food went downhill. Our waitress  Devon  rushed us the entire time. We got an appetizer maybe a minute before our actual food. Then after 5 minutes at most of trying our meal  we were rudely asked if we already wanted dessert and after saying not yet  she quickly added how it would take a whole 10 minutes to make so she needed to know. After another 5 minutes  the same thing happened. I said yes for the heck of it and we got the bill set on the table before the dessert was set down. Not to mention that during the service  we overheard her talking to another waiter about how we needed to hurry up eating and that she was trying to rush us out. So rude! I ended up feeling sick afterwards from having to rush enjoying the food. We were in and out of that place in under 40 minutes - including the time it took to seat us! Ok Food + Rushed + Rude Staff = Not Coming Back.
Alyssa C.,Whittier  CA,80,54,6,6/5/2012,5.0,"Obviously home of the pizookie. They are all amazing and they have trios if you want to try more than one flavor. Also  their pizzas are on point. The managers sometimes allow happy hour prices in non happy hour areas. I have sat in dining  outside and in the bar area  all service is good  restrooms are clean  I haven\'t had anything that didn\'t taste good. My friend swears by a beer combo called ""Jerry Burst"" Jermiah Red and Berry Burst."
Michael P.,Santa Ana  CA,0,1,,4/27/2014,5.0,Devon and Alex are the best servers in this place. Fun and personable for sure! This place treats you right
Josh S.,Mission Viejo  CA,183,650,160,10/23/2007,4.0,Lets get one thing straight  you're not here for cutting edge cuisine so if that is what you expect  go away. If you're looking for a somewhat generic American menu  with some interesting deep dish pizzas  homemade BEER  a ton of flat screens and last but not least  THE PIZOOKIE  you're in the right place. I don't come here often but when I do  I'm ok with it. We were here on Saturday night with the college football and Red Sox Game 6 going  with a group  needing some drinks and food before hitting the Improv. The wait was long but we stole a table in the bar within a few minutes and gave away our seat buzzer to another group. I had a pint of the Blonde and another of Hef and ordered their Ribs. I'm a big ribs fan and had never had them here. I usually get a pizza or sandwich but this just sounded right tonight. I have to say  damn good ribs. Extremely tender  not charred  good BBQ sauce made with their Red Ale beer and they fell off the bone. What more can one ask for  except some wetnaps.  Plus you finish it off with a pizookie  hot gooey chocolate chip cookie with some vanilla on top. Great! This place serves a purpose and does it well.
Chago M.,Santa Ana  CA,0,14,,1/20/2012,2.0,"I have been eating at BJ\'s for over twenty years. I always get the Bj\'s Favorite Pizza. Tonight I got the worst Pizza ever. The toppings were all bunched together and some parts were just crust with no toppings. To add insult to injury  the pizza was sliced horribly so that the pizza fell apart if you tried to serve youself a piece. This ""large"" Pizza was almost $25! Prices have gone up and quality has gone down. I will not come back."
Lauren G.,Placentia  CA,328,311,101,12/14/2009,4.0,Had a late lunch  early dinner  even earlier beer thirty here yesterday. Parking sucks in the Marketplace but it wasn't too bad to turn me and my friends away. The wait was lass than 5 minutes and they sat our party of three. Pitcher of Jeremiah Red for the table and one of us ordered an Irish Root Beer. Said cocktail consisted of Bailey's Irish Cream  Jameson Irish Whiskey  Butterscotch schnapps and one other thing? It looked yummy. Pizza was a large Spinach and Artichoke which was delish  though I could only eat one slice Service was speedy  though it is a little pricey. All in all good food and nice atmosphere.
Jon N.,Garden Grove  CA,225,548,58,6/29/2009,4.0,Now that I have a job I can upgrade my college diet consisting of Papa John's pizza and Coor's Lite beer to something more white collar like BJ's pizza and micro brewed beer. As you can see the contrast is absolutely stunning. Yeah! Life is good. Lots of people take their dates here. I love people watching  especially couples or people on dates. You can easily see how the date is going by the amount of conversing  hand gestures  eye contact  and facial expressions. I've seen some girls who can't wait to get out of there  and some where they don't want to take their eyes off their date. This one time this guy and girl was sitting in front of us and I was watching them. It was obvious they were on a date but there was no chemistry. The guy was watching the Laker game most of the time and the girl would try to strike up a conversation but he always responded to her questions with typical male grunts as he was watching a sports event. He would only pay attention to her during commercial breaks. Near the end of finishing their meal he went in to casually hold her hand (maybe because the Lakers won??) but she pulled it away. Crash and burnnnnn...The pizza here always comes out great. The crust is always crispy but not overcooked. The verity of toppings that comes with it always complements it nicely. What I love is that BJ's pizza always reheats up nicely in your oven at home. I actually think the crust is even better if you reheat it just right. The only thing I don't like about this place is the long wait and the chicks taking down your name are always a little snobbish  although it's always a different set every time I visit.
Brandon H.,Irvine  CA,19,8,,6/23/2012,4.0,"I rate this place a 4 stars because I enjoy their food  IF you order it correctly. As a big fan of chicken wings  I don\'t really like the way BJ\'s prepares it  however  if you order them ""TOSSED"" and ""EXTRA CRISPY"" you will get them the way wings are supposed to be served and they are very good. Prices aren\'t bad during lunch and happy hour  but if you are here besides those time frames expect to be overcharged for an average beer. There is nothing special about BJ\'s in general. I do like the bar tenders at the Irvine location  they are friendly. One major tip... do not go there on a Thursday night and expect to find a seat in the bar area  for some reason it is always packed."
Aaron D.,Anaheim  CA,421,415,27,3/4/2009,4.0,Conveniently located near the Marketplace in Tustin/Irvine. I think I am a bit jaded toward chain restaurants but BJ's has great beer. As for BJ's - I often avoid going there because I don't really like any of their appetizers. They are not awful they just also are not great. They need to work on more variety in the menu and on adding some complexity to their recipes. Most bars can make the appetizers they are offering. The Lettuce wraps are pretty good. If you eat meat then the Angus sliders are ok. But  in general: the appetizers are not great. Appetizers don't make a restaurant; but if your a brewery you better work on your appetizers or people will eventually quit dropping in for a beer.As for the beer - I really enjoy the refreshing quality and flavor of the Brew house Blonde and the two varieties of Pale Ale. The Heif at BJ's however has a nasty aftertaste. The Jeremiah red is fantastic. And the freshly brewed Root beer is worth trying. Its also delicious with ice cream as a dessert.On to Entrees. The Salmon is not very good. It could be that its because its farmed and from the Atlantic. Unfortunately many restaurants have not learned that cheap  farmed  crappy  Atlantic Salmon is not every going to taste elegant or amazing. Its going to taste like cheap  farmed  Atlantic Salmon. The clam chowder is pretty tasty. They don't always consistently deliver it hot but when they do its wonderful.The Chardonnay Shrimp Pasta is delicious. They sometimes bring it out with some nasty bacon on top but other times they don't. And some people probably prefer some bacon on their pasta. But  the sauce is fantastic on it. The Jambalaya is pretty tasty here too.They have a fantastic pazookie. Its a giant cookie with a nice scoop of ice cream served right in the middle of it. Its really a bit much for me but there is nothing wrong with that.This location is much bigger than some of the Oceanside locations. The service is pretty good. Some times its very busy but there is a lot of seating. I assume BJ's makes big bucks. This is a fun place to hang out with friends at.
Alex O.,Santa Ana  CA,0,16,,9/11/2012,1.0,Went to the restaurant Sunday September 1st. Not the first time there or any other. The server was too busy  the person that brought the drinks was rude and the food did not have enough ingredients. How can you serve a pizza without the main ingredient.Overall experience at this BJ's was bad. Not going there again
Robert C.,Montebello  CA,26,3,74,5/29/2011,4.0,The pizza is good  great flavor  soft crust  but the service is slow at the beginning. A couple of times it took 20 minutes before anyone came around to take our drink orders. But the pizza is great...
Philip S.,Irvine  CA,15,201,31,1/19/2012,3.0,Beer sampler is good but you should split if among two people if you intend to finish it in the time it takes to eat a meal.
Marshel S.,Phoenix  AZ,12,37,6,3/21/2009,3.0,"First the upside...For a micro brewery/restaurant BJs is par for the course. If I could give it a 3.5 star rating...I definitely would.The Mediterranean Pizza is wicked good. The Jeremiah Red micro brew is a nice Irish ale  and the place is usually packed---especially if there is a sporting event going on (Lakers game  March Madness  Football game  etc.). It is all you can ask for in a sports bar micro brewery restaurant.Now the downside... I had only one bad experience with BJs out of the few times I\'ve been there. I tried to call ahead to have a table ready for a surprise party for my wife--and they said that they could not accommodate. By the way...I was asking for a table for 4--not half the restaurant. They do have this ""call-an-hour-ahead-to-put-your-name-on-the-waiting-list"" thing  which is totally bogus. So I played their call ahead game  and then they said that they cannot take reservations. So I called and spoke to someone else  and they took care of it  only to arrive and find out that they didn\'t put my name on the ""call-an-hour-ahead-to-put-your-name-on-the-waiting-list"". When we arrived  they took care of it anyway  but overall they took something simple  and made it very difficult.Next time---I\'ll plan a surprise party at a place that takes traditional reservations."
Jay N.,Irvine  CA,1,46,,11/2/2013,1.0,My wife and I try to come here regularly and regularly we are disappointed with the service  poor food quality and out right poor managment. What was once a great BJs is no longer. We came in last night Nov 1st. around 10 pm after the Wasa Sushi was closed earlier before 10 pm and ordered a simple dinner here. .. to our dismay the pizza we were told was made wrong and we had to wait. It happens so no problem we did the place was full... well after over an hours wait later the pizza comes in and its wrong again. I'm saddened that the service here is simply terribl. They have teeny boppers running around waiting on tables and managing this place... the kids need support help maybe some traing with service. The table next to us had similar issues... when our server noticed the pizza was wrong and we were seemingly upset he said he will bring his manager... well after a 10 min wait his manager he mentioned was busy and couldn't come. Just terrible... we're very limited around the ranch here in choices for good pizza places and had even more issues with CPK pizza across the street before...but looms like we may start going there again...
Valerie P.,Tustin  CA,9,12,5,8/26/2013,1.0,Horrible says it all! Went to enjoy a nice dinner with my husband tonight and it was a huge disappointment. First the server forgot his salad. When we asked her about it  she tried to BS us by saying that it comes with the dinner...like we've never eaten out before?! Really just apologize and get the salad! Then after waiting over 30 minutes for our food  we asked for a manager. He went to the kitchen and came back assuring us that we were priority and our food would be right up. 45 minutes comes and still no dinner  while all of the tables around us were being served. We asked for the manager (Joe) again. He looked our way  went back in the kitchen and we didn't see him again. We walked! Nicely done...we won't be back and we will surely share this experience with everyone we know...and anyone who reads this review.
Shannon L.,East Bay  CA,1348,2568,3287,6/30/2007,4.0,I love BJ's happy hour! Mini deep dish pizzas and other appetizers are all discounted. The pizookie is so yum and I give them many stars since I don't know any other restaurant that came up with this delectable dessert.My favorite is the BBQ chicken or Great White (alfredo sauce) pizzas. This place is definitely good for groups or sports fans because they have a couple big screens and TVs all around.I'm not much of a beer drinker and they have a lot of tasty  light beers.
Traci D.,Costa Mesa  CA,226,715,21,11/14/2007,4.0,BJs is a pretty cool brewery. The food isnt anything to brag about but the bartenders at this particular BJs are really cool. The Pizookies and microbrews are somethings to try. Also I am giving BJs four stars for their Jerry Burst (a combo of two beers...i dont remember which one or if that is even the right name....but its good). My friends and I usually go on thursday nights and its not too crowded but it wasnt empty either.
Erica C.,Garden Grove  CA,79,31,1,3/25/2009,5.0,Always come here for lunch when I'm in the neighborhood. The first time I came here  I ordered the tomato  basil  sausage thin crust pizza. The manager brought our food and insisted on serving my first slice. As he lifted the first pizza slice off the pan with the spatula  the slice tipped over unto the table. The look of embarrassment that washed over his face was just priceless! He just stared at the sad little pizza slice splattered on the table for a moment. It was no big deal but he apologized profusely and later offered a FREE PIZOOKIE!!! Nothing can get better than a free PIZOOKIE.
Karen C.,Riverside County  CA,2,22,14,6/16/2012,4.0,Good food  moderately priced. My daughter and I split an entree (Parmesan crusted chicken). It was delicious and more than enough food for both of us. If you are looking for something lighter in calories  try the balsamic chicken (my favorite). And of course we had pizookies! They are SO good. I think we have tried them all now. My daughter likes the red velvet and I like the cookies 'n cream (yummy!!). The service was very good as well (alert the media--finally waiters who were attentive and helpful--yay!). My restaurant experience is SO much more pleasant when the wait staff is engaging and actually appear to care about what they are doing! Love it!
Bill H.,Folsom  CA,9,72,,4/10/2012,3.0,I generally like BJs. Had the classic chicken club which was very good. Service was a little slow so they get 3 stars. Also the fried cheese was really good. one of the best I have had
Kat L.,Mission Viejo  CA,312,456,40,12/12/2008,2.0,Pizookie = good service = needs improvementlocation = pretty spaciousoverall = just right sweet to hit the spot.. although too much of it! lolThe Pizookie was a little overdone for my taste b/c each second it got tougher and tougher.. and fast! Still I like the Pizookie and that was the sole reason we came here. I normally now avoid BJ's like the plague. My sister is going to kill me when she finds out I went.. and paid for myself without her. She offered to pay over Thanksgiving and I just scoffed at her O=9Tonight  I wanted to end the difficult meal with something sweet and good. A pizookie sounded nice but there were some difficulties in ordering. Still at least I got my pizookie fill for the whole year. I don't think my sister will like hearing that O=9
Keisha V.,Long Beach  CA,16,67,6,2/19/2012,5.0,I love BJ'S. Obviously their pizza is amazing. But  I live for their avocado egg rolls and I die for the parmesan crusted chicken. HOWEVER  how could I forget PAZOOKIE HEAVEN! Best dessert ever ahhh!
Robert M.,Corona Del Mar  CA,1683,1251,47,5/4/2009,4.0,This place is insanely popular. I read an article that claimed that this particular BJ's Restaurant and Brew House location was the most profitable out of the whole chain  and I believe it. It's almost always packed. My theory on that is this - once the area around it became saturated with single family residence homes  families wanted a fairly kid friendly place where they could go and get a beer  glass of wine  and martini. In support of this theory  I'll note you'll often find families here  but there are also groups here (just saw a baby shower here last week)  and sports fans in the bar watching the hockey/soccer/basketball/baseball/football game on the big screen. The food is good  and some of it  like the famed pizookie  is unique. The shrimp lettuce wraps (new) are nice  and the beers are okay. The fact that they are open later than surrounding businesses certainly helps also. For a chain  a nice place. Service can be wildly varied depending on how busy they are.
Kari H.,Tustin  CA,2,10,4,2/21/2014,4.0,I went to BJ's with a friend that had never been there before. We had a great time. We had Bonnie as a waitress and she was awesome! Friendly  courteous  knowledgeable about the menu and quick to refill drinks. The menu is large  so most any taste can be fulfilled. We started with the avocado egg rolls and loved them! I have the Sweet Pig and my friend had one of the burgers. Other than having a hard time hearing each other  the experience was great!
Chris S.,Irvine  CA,8,64,13,6/28/2009,2.0,I had lunch here once with coworkers  great food. So I tried to take gf there a couple times for dinner  both times I ended up leaving totally unattended because I got tired of waiting for someone to take our drink order  let alone dinner. So I guess that means  horrible service.I guess if you are cool with waiting a really long time to be part of the in crowd of irvine's young people  and being serviced by them (with an obvious hiring focus on looks over ability to do the job  that being serving people)   this is your spot.
Thu N.,Orange County  CA,347,340,255,12/3/2008,3.0,This is a pretty balanced score. I'm not too fond of their overall menu  but if I have a mad craving for pizza  BJ's would be my place to go. I love my pizza thick  and simple---so I always order their Pepperoni pizza. 2 pieces would put you over the top since it's so thick  yummy!I also hate to sound like a broken record but their Pizookie is superb. My favorite has to be the Peanut Butter one. When you combine the saltiness of the PB cookie and ice-cream  that's just PMS heaven for any girl out there =) Altogether  It's a scaled down version of Yard House  but their Happy Hour is my 2nd favorite place to go. Only thing is  it ends at 6. Their girly drinks aren't as good as Yardhouse. I would say it's more of a place to chill with your buddies to watch a game  whereas YH is a combination of both socializing with new people and/or hanging out with your buddies. Wait time sucks anytime of the day. You're better off stalking those who are seated at the booths in the bar area  and just staring them down until they leave. Decent local spot  but don't drive more than 15 miles if that's what it takes to get there.
matthew p.,Anaheim  CA,18,252,134,1/13/2012,3.0,buffalo chicken wantons were disgustingsweet pig pizza is yummychickens tenders and fries on lunch menu is a good bargainservice is really really slow at lunch time
Kathleen B.,San Diego  CA,128,462,83,4/6/2009,4.0,Yes mediterranean pizza!!I like that they scoop the pizza out for you - otherwise I wouldn't know how to handle all those toppings. Yelpers  I may be selling out since I am not reviewing a mom and pop pizza shop.. but I won't deny it. BJ pizza's are good and plus they were open late when we needed a place to chow. Everything in Irvine closes at 10 or 9 or 8:30!!!However  I would not come here on a saturday or friday night because of the wait nightmares.. Last night when we came by (sunday night) it was mildly busy and not not so dead that we felt we were inconveniencing the staff by eating there (maybe I'm the only one who gets that way when you're the only group in the restaurant) AND we were able to get a seat quickly :)Claps BJs -- CLAPS.
Black X.,Los Angeles  CA,227,692,14,11/18/2008,2.0,"Oh brother. If I hear one more thing about how great ""Pizookie"" is I\'m going to jump off the Fairview Bridge and wave to South Coast on the way down.This place reminds me of ""Office Space."" The tacky restaurant Jennifer Aniston works in--or ""Clown Burger"" in a movie called ""Don\'t Tell Mom The Babysitters Dead."" You cannot believe people actually enjoy spots like this.Their pizza is thick crap. Just laughable and not half as good as Round table--for twice the price. Nothing unique. Just semi-cheesy cardboard.But this Pizookie fascination. Why? Go to Border\'s Books--buy one of their stupid chocolate chip cookies and throw some crappy Dreyer\'s Vanilla Ice Cream on it. Wow! You have your amazing customized dessert.I saved you ten bucks."
Jasz J.,Hollywood  CA,206,198,155,5/7/2011,4.0,This is a chain restaurant that I don't mind at all. Their handcrafted draft is very well stock and the Jeremiah red (A Silver Medal winner in Strong Ales at the 1996 Great American Beer Festival. This Irish-style strong ale is brewed with a secret blend of five imported specialty malts. Not too hoppy in order to emphasize the complex malt flavor and fruity aroma.) is my favorite  very tasty beer and well balance. Perfect location for food and sport game watching. With their deep dish pizza and pizookie (freshly baked  hot out of the oven  rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish. Choice of Chocolate Chunk  White Chocolate Macadamia Nut  Peanut Butter or Oatmeal Raisin Walnut?) for dessert  oh it's a girl playground any date. Lol!! As I am a crazy fan of NBA  totally sexy to come here cheering away with the crowd. Lakers all the way!!Good crowd  food and environment make BJ wanted all the time!
Albert J.,Irvine  CA,23,32,,12/19/2009,3.0,"I went to eat lunch today with the family. It\'s a popular place so I expect a wait. Today (a Friday) was 15-20 minutes. The parking lot is always a zoo  but that\'s expected as well.We took my 5 month old baby girl with us  and she was in a stroller. I mentioned this as we asked for a table. Unfortunately  they made us take her out and sit her in a high chair adjacent to the table because of a ""fire hazard."" However  next to us  there were two tables with strollers adjacent to the table. Hmmm  you say. Yes  I say so too.The waiters/waitresses at BJ\'s are hit and miss. Some are exceptional and really do try to make the visit a pleasant one by staying on top of what we need. Today was inbetween. Things just seemed to drag on and on.Overall  the food was okay and nothing special. It\'s a bit of chaotic atmosphere  but that\'s expected as well. I wouldn\'t recommend it as a place to go often  but maybe once in a while."
Loretta R.,Whittier  CA,10,103,12,2/25/2012,1.0,Worse bj experience our server only took our order and got our check. We had to ask for refills  our party of two was ignored except when we paid. Yea the server came quick then.
Phyu A.,Irvine  CA,98,52,6,8/2/2011,4.0,The pizzas are delicious  but I LOVE their pazooki. They actually have a new one called red velvet pazooki which is the bomb dot com! Other than that it's a decent place.
Niloo S.,Yorba Linda  CA,44,188,234,7/23/2011,4.0,Always good food  good service  have something for everyone. The pizookie is super popular  im not a huge fan but ill eat it. There pasta and sandwiches are all really really good ! The pizza is good but it can get a but heavy sometimes dont be afraid to try other things there all really good !
Kristine W.,San Francisco  CA,2,26,,7/30/2012,4.0,i thought this place was great! i went to both the Happy Hour bar and dine-in for dinner and both were awesome :)Happy Hour is pretty long from 3-7pm but i'm not complaining! the cocktail i got was perfect for me cuz i like them sweet and not too much alcohol in them. they only subtract $1 off of cocktails in Happy Hour but hey any discount is a good discount. i had their half-off mini pizzas before too and those are really worth it and can fill you up.for dinner  i tried their BJ's traditional deep dish pizza and it was AMAZING. the bread was so light and fluffy and the toppings and sauce was just amazing.i shared a pizza with friends but now i wish i had a whole one to myself cuz it was just that good. yummmmm.and then i had their pizookie and got it half red velvet and half milk chocolate. IT WAS DIVINE. i never had a pizookie this good before and i think it was cuz of the red velvet. the milk chocolate was just whatever but that red velvet cookie was FREAKIN' AMAZING. i was about to gobble it up in seconds but i was sharing it with friends so i had to hold myself back. lol. service was also really good and very attentive. my only complaint was that that you get a 6-inch pizookie for $6 and i found that really expensive. i expected the pizookie to be bigger so i was disappointed with its size cuz it was so so so tasty T^Ti really would give them 5 stars in terms of taste but price and portion size subtracts one star for me. all in all  i do really like this place though!
Ryan D.,Santa Ana  CA,196,2,,1/2/2015,5.0,We had a birthday over the holidays here for 11 people at 930. When we arrived we had arguably the worst server. She took over 15 min to bring us our water as we saw her standing by the register talking to her coworkers. The restaurant at that time wasn't too busy so there was no reason for it. The wait on the food was normal and the food was good. However several of my friends did not even receive their food or their water. We decided to to talk to the manager Chuck to explain how terrible our waitress was. He apologized to us  asked if there was anything we needed  comped our food (minus alcohol)  and saved this bjs trip for us. More than anything though he split (what was left of our) bill  something that she couldn't do. I mean she sees 11 21 year olds and straight up tells us 'no I can't split the bill for you guys'. In addition chuck also brought out spoons and have us a free party platter pizookie. Chuck  thank you for being a good manager and saving our birthday dinner.
Gigi M.,Huntington Beach  CA,1001,687,2181,2/19/2009,5.0,All I gotta say is 5 stars for the following: ~PB Pazooki ~Avocado egg rolls ~Beer selection ~Menu filled with delicious of variety of different flavors ~Chill/sporty/contemporary design Have never left dissatisfied at any BJ's!
Jocelyn M.,Inglewood  CA,53,430,238,9/22/2011,5.0,hard to beat half price mini pizzas  $2 off appetizers and cheap drinks for happy hourand PIZOOKIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!thats what we got when i went with my friends. mini cheese and tomato pizza  spinach and artichoke dip  drinks (3 of them) and a pizookie. it was heaven  and less than $50  sweet!!!
Matt R.,Orange County  CA,20,419,238,2/16/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I rarely update my reviews and I am not a huge fan of reviewing chain restaurants  period  or chain restaurants. However  I recently moved within walking distance of this restaurant and have the opportunity to experience it on a different level  more often.They have a very good selection of beers on tap. While not huge  they have some decent microbrews  including their own  that most places just don't have. For example: I'm a huge fan of stouts and porters. If I am LUCKY a place MIGHT have Guinness on tap. They have a house porter and IMPERIAL stout (high alcohol content.) They also have a red ale  which no one seems to do anymore. I guess there aren't enough Englishmen in OC to make it worth the while for most places. They do a happy hour on Sundays with pints around the $4.50 mark. Not bad at all. They do not  however  discount their appetizers during their Sunday HH. The food is ok. I liked the avocado egg rolls a lot. The avocado becomes very creamy and it comes with a sweet and sour sauce that goes very well. Their spinach artichoke dip is pretty good  but it's got a lot of cream cheese in it  almost to the point where it feels like filler.I hate  hate  hate the name 'pazookie'. Did a 7 year old come up with that name? Regardless  it's good. Cookies should be warm and covered with ice cream. I like that you can get three minis and mix and match. That was a fun way to try a few. Their cookies n cream was the best  being an Oreo based cookie.Their pizza still is not good. But  I hate deep dish pizza. I don't like eating a soggy pizza flavored  meat pie. If I want pizza  it should be crispy crust  whether thick or thin.Their menu is way  way too big. It's seriously a dozen pages. It's just tacky. Maybe if they had the bar and food menu separate it would be better  but I have to sit there and study a spiral bound menu for 15 minutes at the bar. I would say they have a 'little' of everything  but they kind of have a lot of everything. I can understand having a couple sandwiches  burgers  etc. Instead they have about 10 kinds of burgers  a dozen sandwiches  several steaks  multiple dinner salads  it's overwhelming and irritating for the customers.Service has been excellent here. The bar staff knows their beer and are friendly and prompt. One of the few places where they are good at letting the customer pace their meal  instead of either rushing them or disappearing for eternity. Their bar area is a little too crowded. The tables are stacked right next to each other with barely room to get in or out. I recommend sitting at the actual bar  if you are going to be in the bar area.Good  cheap beer and friendly service will keep me coming back. Overwhelming menu with average food will push me to other places  but keep BJs in the rotation.
Kevin S.,Santa Monica  CA,1,22,1,2/12/2012,4.0,You always get the high level BJ's standards. I am never disappointed. MMMMM pizookies!!
Annie C.,Newport Beach  CA,0,3,1,6/21/2012,2.0,I was just here last night and first off bad impression when the hostess called our name to be seated we were walking right behind her then she said oh actually we need to wait longer...our group was big it was hard for us to walk back out without blocking other people at the same time. After we were seated we waited 20minutes just to have a waitress to order our drinks....maybe our waitress had a bad day but as customers we do not deserve to be a part of it. when she came back out with only 4waters (even we are a group of 9) one of my friend asked for one of them even though he had ordered a beer. another 20mins went by the waitress came out with our beers and one of my friend needed a water she told my friend who asked for water earlier that it was not his water and why was he drinking it...FOR WHAT I REMEMBERED FROM RESTAURANTS EXPERIENCES...ISNT IT NORMAL TO BE SERVED WITH A ROUND OF WATER NO MATTER WHAT YOU ORDER TO DRINK???I do not recall giving any attitude or problems for the waitress but right after dinner I had a stomach ache...I wish the waitress im writing about can read this because that is why you do not deserve our full 18% tips.
Jesse G.,Ajo  AZ,56,158,9,6/10/2012,4.0,Awesome food and excellent beer! Their Tatonka Stout is the shit.
R. P.,Orange  CA,0,1,,6/9/2012,1.0,Once was enough! For $85 you've got to do more than serve good food; in the hospitality business atmosphere is key. If guests are treated well  a decent meal can be elevated to fantastic. Conversely  indifference can cause an over-all great meal to be demoted to unpleasant. Our family of five went for an early Thursday evening dinner to celebrate a birthday. Although the wait staff loitering at the entrance watched us walk in  no one greeted us. Shortly after arriving  we were seated at a booth so small we had no elbow room. We sat near the doors that lead to the outdoor eating area where wait staff congregated regularly to wipe sweat off their brows and clog the doorway. Our waitress was efficient but certainly not friendly.Our reviews of the food: ENLIGHTENED THAI CHICKEN MANGO SALAD - awful. Not a piece of mango in sight and the lettuce was unappetizingly wilted. BREWHOUSE DOUBLE DELUXE BURGER - delicious. CHICKEN FETTUCCINI ALFREDO - especially tasty. SCAMPI PASTA - very good  lots of shrimp. CRISPY CHICKEN SANDWICH - well liked. Pazookie - scrumptious.
Howard R.,Corona  CA,9,105,51,8/7/2011,2.0,Crowds  staff is not very friendly and too focused on the tasks at hand to give you good service. After three times finding lipstick on my glass when I received a drink...AND the third one was AFTER I told the manager about it  I stopped going here unless friends demand it. Lazy Dog (across the parking lot) is better  cleaner  and customer service is better.
S L.,Los Angeles  CA,28,173,,1/8/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,The sampler isn't too bad! Good amount of alcohol with good tasting beer.
Zack P.,Tustin  CA,213,14,2,11/21/2011,4.0,Love BJs and this location is no different. I come here for their deepdish pizza and great variety of drinks and I always leave very satisfied. It's an awesome place for birthdays  it can manage large groups  or just a few happy hour drinks. And if you have room after a delicious dinner  their pazookies are awesome.
Cody L.,Irvine  CA,0,13,,12/18/2013,3.0,Neat place for some drinks and pizza afterwork. They got a fully stocked bar. Wait staff is friendly and attentive but their menu is exhaustive. Takes forever to get cover to cover. I got the balsamic chicken. That was actually really good. Don't forget to end your meal with a macadamia nut pizooki.
Brian B.,Santa Ana  CA,15,11,,9/22/2013,2.0,stopped by here for lunch on a saturday (13/09/21). greeted at hostess counter by what appeared to be a manger. he asked how many  we said two  then he directed us to a girl who would seat us. neither asked if we would prefer indoor or outdoor seating. the girl lead us outside  past many open indoor tables. neither of us is a fan of eating outside  but the weather was decent so we settled for the outdoor tables rather than make a fuss. we noticed almost immediately a very sour smell in the air that we determined must have been sewage. it remained throughout the entire meal. we also spotted trash on the floor.we were greeted within a decent amount of time by our server who was very nice  however when my girlfriend asked for the available soups our server was unsure and listed them with no certainty - telling her the soup of the day was broccoli something. when my girlfriend had a follow-up question about the soup/salad combo our server didn't know and actually resorted to taking my girlfriend's menu (i guess assuming my girlfriend had not bothered to look at it herself before deciding to ask the question) to research the answer and ultimately did not find or provide one. while researching she did note that the soup of the day was in fact chicken noodle and that my girlfriend's menu was missing a page. we ordered a water & salad and a club sandwich & iced tea. food was good. the tea tasted funky. not bad really  just strange like it was made in an unclean container with remnants of a previous batch of who-knows-what. it did not taste like regular iced tea should taste.while we waited for our food i felt something on my arm. i lifted my arm and found a small spider dangling from a web on my elbow. i flicked it away. our food came out very quickly which was nice. during our meal though we were annoyed by a persistent fly. with no screens around the outdoor area and with the stench of sewage in the air the only surprise here is that we only had to deal with one.both of us decided we just wanted to leave and when our server came to check on us we asked for our check. that was the last time we saw her. we immediately put our card with the bill and waited (and waited) for it to be picked up. finally  a server for a nearby table  who i'm assuming saw we were waiting  came over and handled our bill and brought a box for our leftovers.admittedly  we probably should've just requested to sit inside from the beginning  but we feel these problems are problems regardless. we've eaten at BJs many times but this was an exceptionally bad experience. we will not be coming back any time soon.
An L.,Anaheim  CA,44,15,1,10/28/2011,5.0,I drink at BJ's too much. They have great berry cider. I only like berry cider from BJ's and The Studio Buffet(Las Vegas's M Resort buffet). I've tried others  but I can't find a better cider. They have a new red velvet pizookie now that tastes pretty good. This review will be exactly the same as the one in HB because I was there 3 days in a row.
Ivan L.,Santa Ana  CA,405,411,30,6/22/2011,4.0,Not bad! It's a chain and great everyonce in a while.... I feel like I gain 5lbs whenever I eat here though.... the beer pretty awesome so I give it 4 stars..... my favorite being the NIT WIT and its in season woot woot.... don't sleep on this flavor
Mr B.,Orange  CA,2,86,57,8/17/2013,4.0,Four stars for the late night happy hour. 2 1/2 for everything else. BJ's used to be really good 15-20 years ago but now they are just another huge generic chain that does everything ok and nothing well. The late night Happy Hour is good though. Five bucks for a pizza and cheap pints. The Tatonka Stout and Jeremiah Red are pretty good. Not quite up to micro brew standard but way better than the mass produced stuff served by most big chains. Be prepared for mediocre food and an extremely long wait if you go on a Friday or Saturday night. (1 - 2 hour wait is norm)
Jennifer B.,Costa Mesa  CA,226,42,6,8/3/2011,4.0,This is a local Irvine hangout  the waiters and waitresses are very nice. They have very good drinks.
Amy K.,Irvine  CA,121,336,2,9/27/2008,2.0,It's really a hit or miss with this BJs. Thing I love about BJs are they 1) pizookies (who doesn't love ice cream off a steaming freshly baked cookie?) and 2) the variety on their menu.The food at this particular location is sometimes great  and other times just OK. One item that is always good is their clam chowder...the half sandwich w/soup combination is generally a safe choice. Their pizza can be a hit or miss.Their service  however  is usually on the poorer side. Also  expect at least a 20 min. - hour wait about 90% of the time.
Suzanne M.,Kapolei  HI,152,156,142,6/11/2011,4.0,HH brings in the crowd. It is a fun place and the prices are great for the food and drink. I like the flatbread pizzas. Though I try to change it up and try something new. Go early for best seating.The bartender is helpful and I think he liked my daughter so he was very attentive!
H L.,Irvine  CA,13,53,3,7/13/2009,4.0,I generally avoid chain restaurants  but when my family goes out  this is the only place we can agree upon. The pizzas are great--they let you order half and half for one pie--half of us are vegetarians  so we get the delicious spinach and artichoke pizza. The newish Thai lettuce wrap appetizer is great  and always save room for a pizookie. Best beer: Jeremiah Red Favorite non-pizza dish: Santa Fe Salad without tortilla strips The service is usually always friendly  and they do a good job offering recommendations
Gee M.,Cypress  CA,0,24,,12/17/2013,3.0,Best pizza you can get. The pazooki is AMAZING!!! Service always seems to be just OK. Not sure why but seems to be the standard there. They seem to be slow always.
Austin S.,Kansas City  MO,503,732,94,7/13/2008,4.0,"I came to this location the other day  probably for the last time (because I just moved from Irvine back home to Pasadena and my 2 friends from my old church small group who are the only ones I really still talk to wanted to meet up to say ""goodbye"")We came for happy hour and more times than not  we always come for happy hour. Though sometimes getting a table can be tricky since the bar area is first come first serve and we always try to grab a booth. This time though  we were lucky that an elderly couple was just getting up  so we waited only a quick couple of minutes.I\'m not much of a beer drinker  but the far and few in between times I do decide to get beer  I typically go for Hefs with a lemon wedge.I also got a small size pizza with sausage  chicken  and mushrooms.The service here is typically pretty good  especially in the bar area. I think maybe once the server was a little slow  but whatever.Our server this time was funny because at one point  all three of us were messing around on our blackberrys and when she came up and saw us  she started commenting on how she just got one and just absolutely loves it and continued to make other comments a couple more trips after that. Plus she also went along when we were razzing each other about this and that. I just like it when the server seems like they\'re really chill and enjoys being there as opposed to just doing their job."
Edgar ..,Tustin  CA,3,5,1,1/19/2014,4.0,BJs annual Grand Cru gets two thumbs up and I highly recommend it to all beer enthusiasts.
Maganism M.,Pico Rivera  CA,5,78,15,12/22/2012,1.0,Was put on hold  after I asked the staff to check for an item that i left at the store. The wait was about 18 minutes  and only to be asked by another staff why i was put on hold... highly disappointing
Troy H.,Huntington Beach  CA,1041,827,183,6/30/2008\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Decided to give this place another try. 1st time: Chicken and ribs combo really sucked. Took 3-4 year hiatus before I came back. 2nd time: Service was horrible. Met a friend and her kids here. Took forever to get my damn beer. Took even longer to get the desserts. I even ordered them during dinner  and they came way after everyone was finished with their food!!!3rd time: Tonight  the pizza was decent. Cooked fairly well. The chicken wings were fair. But again  the service sucked. Don't know what the big deal at this place is.......
Jackie O.,Austin  TX,0,24,8,3/2/2013,2.0,"I went to this BJ\'s with some family from out of town when I was 8 months pregnant. The place was packed and we waited maybe 10 minutes for a seat... No problem. We got seated and had a middle aged male waiter. Everyone ordered their alcohol  then it was my turn. What I like about BJ\'s is that they have fufu (non-alcoholic) beverages with refills. So I order some fufu flavored lemonade and as we chatted away  4 of the 6 dinners come to the table. 10 minutes later the remaining meals arrive. At this point my drink is empty and as my husband is ordering another beer he tells the waiter that I need a refill as well. The waiter looks at us and in a rather annoyed tone says ""you\'re going to have to pay for the refill!"" I protest that their menu states that my drink has free refills and the waiter stares at us with a look of annoyance as my husband says ok to the charge for the refill. Of course as we were leaving the kids that work the hostess stand were too busy to discuss the charge. It wasn\'t about the additional $3 or $4 for the refill  it was his horrible attitude all together. Needless to say we have not gone back. Ill go to the BJs in Temecula where the waiters are human and know their menu! Call papa johns if you want pizza  don\'t waste your time here!"
Gary Royale T.,Orange  CA,976,346,107,1/9/2009,5.0,I have to disagree with one of the reviewers on here about the Pizookie. It is a brilliant idea to add fatty chocolate chip cookie thats the size of a pizza with 5 kinds of fatty ice cream. The guy that invented it deserves mad props  and pregnant women all over love it!I have reviewed BJ's before  you can find my opinions about the food here: yelp.com/biz/bjs-pizza-aAs far as this particular location  I did notice that they have more lunch time specials then other locations. They also offer a 5 for 1 free lunch card as well.On a side note  some of the waitresses look great from behind in those tight black slacks. Needless to say  I tipped very generously when I am provided with a great view.
Silver L.,Orange County  CA,0,6,,2/3/2009,4.0,Their pizookie is a must have. Every now and then I have sudden cravings for it... For those of you who don't know what a pizookie is.. it's a big big warm cookie topped with like two or three scoops of ice cream.. seriously it's a genius dessert. Their shrimp scampi is also superb... all the flavors that they put into it blend well. I got full off the shrimp scampi (but I still managed to eat pizookie.. of course) because the portions for it could easily serve two people. My boyfriend ordered the make it yourself pizza which was really good. The bread they use for the it is super soft and warm.. mmmm.. It comes out in a hot iron/steel(?) pan so it stays warm.. Service was good  no complaints. I usually get a guy server every time I go coincidentally... and they tend to be really funny and nice.
Marti C.,Canton  OH,48,232,89,3/25/2011,3.0,When you go to Bjs you should really stick to the tried and true. Usually I get a pizza. The crust is buttery deliciousness and it's thick and savory. I think over the years I have tried every version of pizza and they are all good. And the perfect end to every meal at BJs the pazookie - my fave is the peanut butter it is melt-in-your-mouth fantastic.Went last night and decided to off roading and ordered the pot roast sandwich with white cheddar mashed potatoes and oven-roasted vegetables. Yea. Mistake. It wasn't awful it just wasn't as delicious as the pizza. The white cheddar potatoes didn't even taste like potatoes all you could taste was the cheese. They were too heavy and overpowered by the cheese. I rated the potatoes first because that is what was most plentiful on the plate. Next came the vegetables: onion  carrorts and celery. They were only lukewarm and still hard. Hardly oven roasted. They were drenched in the brown gravy for the meat that was surely out of a can. Again not unedible just not uber tasty. Finally the meat  for a second I wondered if it it too came out of a can. Maybe the meat and gravy came together  not sure. When I think pot roast I think melt in your mouth meat that comes in big hunks that just falls apart. Well this was in like strips of preformed meat or something. I don't know. Again it was edible for the most part. I left more than half of it on my plate.The service at this particular location is always sketchy. Our hostess definitely thought she was the mostess  but she was not. All attitude  not fun. Our waiter was nice just sparse. He was more interested in flirting with girls at another table. I gave this trip a 3 based on my memories of the pizza and pazookie.
Shirleystyleshair H.,Irvine  CA,182,6,76,7/28/2013,4.0,this restaurant is always hopping great food the triple chocolate pizookie is to die for and the best beer ever.
Stephanie L.,Irvine  CA,57,193,2,3/17/2011,4.0,BJ's specializes in two things: beer and pizza. I'm happy to say they succeed in both. Nothing is more disappointing than when a restaurant can't live up to what it claims to be good at. I come to BJ's during two times of the day: during happy hour and late night happy hour. They have great specials on their beer and appetizers. A bonus is when you come on Tuesday and their bottles of wine are half off. Gotta love a place that's open late with good beer and pizza.
Heather G.,Indio  CA,14,34,9,6/18/2012,3.0,Bj pizza lovers beware! Stand up and raise your voices! I will start by saying that my star value on food would have been a 1 but when you factor in service from both the management and our waitress I gave BJs a 3. My husband and I love this chain and frequent it often. Which can be hard since we do not have one within a 60 mile radius. Needless to say we enjoy the atmosphere  the service and the pizza. Sadly we might not be able to say this for much longer. Last night we arrived waited 45 mins for a table for 4 of us  normal for a Saturday night  and we were fine with it. But we were famished once our dinner arrived. The sweet pig pizza looks a little different than normal  dry to say it kindly. After one bite we were all immediately disappointed. And despite how hungry we were no one at more than one slice. The pizza had NO flavor  it was dry and fell apart when you bite into it. Not BJs style. It was so bad that I had to ask out waitress if something had changed. I was not complaining or sending it back that is not my style. I just wanted to know if I was off or the pizza was. I was even a little embarrassed when I asked her. Because really how could a pizza place change their signature dish to something as plain and unappetizing as what we were just served. But sadly I am right  BJs in the Tustin market place is testing a new 6min pizza. Yes I said 6 minutes and that's not a typo! It is a piss poor attempt to fool you the consumer into thinking you are getting a quality made to order pie  when in fact half of the pie is pre made before you even walk in the door! Dominos doesn't even do that! And may i mention Dominos tastes a hell of allot better than this new pizza and is half the price. So if you are eating at this BJs or any or for that matter and the pizza is off don't think the establishment is having an off night. Say something to the manager on duty or we we all loose the yummy pizza that made this chain so popular! Or if you do not want to risk it simply call ahead and ask if they are serving the 6 minute pizza or their traditional recipe. That's what we are doing. Good luck!
Jeannie C.,Orange County  CA,53,175,42,9/5/2008,4.0,I don't know what it is about Sliders  you know  mini burgers but BJ's has some really good minis. Today  I went to BJ's after work for happy hour with my girlfriend and I ordered the sliders  the cheese and tomato mini pizza and my friend ordered the chicken lettuce wrap. Yes..I love food and I was so hungry.I thought the sliders were perfectly executed. The Angus beef lies in between a soft  small  round bun with just the right amount of ketchup and of course  lettuce  tomatoes and pickles on the side. Gotta love them pickles with the sliders.The mini pizza is a small deep dish but it wasn't too doughy or was it too heavy  it was just right in my tummy.Although I thought the chicken lettuce wrap was decent  maybe cause I was hungry  my friend didn't think it was all that good. I mean you can't expect to eat authentic chicken lettuce wrap at a brewery  right?During Happy Hour  the appetizers are two dollars off and the mini pizzas are half off but keep in mind  this is only valid at the bar area during the hours of 3PM - 7PM. I don't drink alchy so I didn't pay attention to the Happy Hour special. Sorry.I do recommend you should go there early to grab a table at the bar during happy hour  because it does get packed. My friend and I found two seats by the bar counter and we needed to constantly wave down for the bartender/waiter to come assist us.
Susan D.,Irvine  CA,0,218,,10/19/2013,3.0,A nice place to have lunch in the Market Place. The Tuscan Tomato Bisque is quite good and you can have a refill which is nice. The Brewhouse Blond Fish and Chips could have been better. Someone mentioned that the BBQ Wings are great   so we might give it a try next time.
Jack H.,Orange  CA,1,2,,12/16/2014,4.0,love the pizza! service is always great! never been let down here... i know theres a wait but its always worth it!
Mike O.,Newport Beach  CA,21,19,10,4/16/2009,4.0,"score! I am a complete convert to this place...used to hate the ""micro"" brewed beers  but have since overcome any aversion to their tastes..or ""finish""...the piranha (sierra nevada)  jeremiah Red (my favorite  thinkin\' kona brewing co\'s firerock pale ale) and tatonka (guiness stout) are my fav\'s with a ""hops"" content reminiscent that\'s not too over the top..well  close enough if you\'re on pints #4 and 5!so...we\'re cruisin\' for some grinds  and nothing decent is open in OC at this hour  and definitely NOT on a weeknight...(I miss LA so much!!)...but we happen to be craving deep dish pizza and behold BJ\'s is open!oh  and the best part? 10pm til closing is ""happy hour"" again! (as in pricing) cool staff and fairly packed even on a wednesday night - crowd\'s cool  and multiple flatty\'s beaming sports talk all over the room (killer!)...brews are flowing and the samplers and pizza\'s are apportioned just right  so you can keep consuming (brews) without getting full...ahh...eating and drinking after the dinner crowd is absolutely the way to go...that said  I can\'t remember eating  playing or consuming before 10pm anyway! :P"
J C.,Irvine  CA,2154,428,8,12/16/2008,3.0,I used to go here pretty often  but finally got sick of it..The burgers are pretty good. The pizza is very good  I rank it higher than alot of other pizza chains.Some of the appetizers are bad  like the spinach dip - one of the worst Ive had. Also the fries suck here. The sliders are average - OK  and cheap for happy hour. The pizookie is usually very good if cooked correctly. Get the ice cream on the side  as it ruins it for me.  The new dark chocolate pizookie I didn't care for.  I've always wanted to try the party pizookie  but never had the balls to order it. The price has increased as well over the years.The happy hour is the time to come. I find the laguna hills location less busy. This location sometimes you won't find a table available in the bar. With the economy in the crapper recently  it may be easier now. The place is open pretty late  and my friends like the beer here. I haven't tried it. Don't expect 5 star restaraunt service  although we usually have no problem getting stuff comped or replaced when we speak up.
Jonathan C.,Irvine  CA,77,34,8,5/11/2011,5.0,get a seat in the bar area n get drunk!! stay away from the outside patio (unless you want to re-enact the crowd noise at the sinking of the Titanic.... never let go Jack..
Sharon C.,Irvine  CA,114,175,,8/11/2008,4.0,I  clearly  have no problem with chain restaurants. Not even big ones. The thing I love about BJs is... their pizza. I LOVE their pizza. Because toppings mean everything to me on a pizza. At BJ's  anything more than... 5(?) toppings.. it cost the same! So I pile it on. I can end up with 10 toppings sometimes. I'm generally not a fan of deep dish but theirs  I love.*mouth watering*It's packed on busy nights and it's loud and yada yada yada. I don't care. Love the pizza. Will revisit.
flo c.,Irvine  CA,147,775,98,5/9/2008,4.0,"3 1/2 stars. 4 star for Happy Hour  3 stars for normal hours.A bunch of us yesterday came after work or so. I\'m not sure if there was a wait to get a table in the bar area  because I was a bit later than everyone else and they had already secured a table and started ordering. By sitting in the bar area (which has normal tables)  we got to partake in the Happy Hour menu. I missed what the discounts were and all my co-workers could remember was that mini-sized deep dish pizzas were half-off and that mixed drinks were discounted. The service is nice but spotty. BJ\'s was PACKED to the brim. They were actually people waiting the entire time we were there. Thus  it\'s a bit of a challenge to find/flag down a server. However  once you get one  they\'re quite nice and experienced. I tried:-""What a Peach"": ABSOLUT VANILIA  Dekuyper Peach Pucker  BOLS Peach Schnapps  orange juice  pineapple juice  grenadine and a splash of Sierra Mist served on the rocks. -Buffalo Chicken Mini Pizza: For Buffalo Chicken Wing lovers - diced celery  red onions and grilled chicken breast marinated in hot and spicy buffalo sauce  drizzled with ranch dressing. Served with extra ranch dressing for dipping. (Incidentally  I never got extra ranch dressing for dipping  not that I would\'ve wanted it.)I really enjoyed both items. The drink was definitely fruity and light. If you aren\'t much of a drinker  that\'s a fabulous choice. I mostly tasted juice and nothing else. The served on the rocks thing was definitely true because there was A LOT of ice after I was done  and it wasn\'t because I drank it super fast. The pizza was good and not too spicy or heavy. I like deep dish pizza  so I could be biased.Final total: The drink was a dollar off.The pizza was half priced. With tax  it was a little over $12 total.In the past  I\'ve also had a friend celebrate a birthday here and rented out the patio area. There\'s a set menu  buffet style  that you can order from with pasta  pizza  etc. That wasn\'t bad  but it wasn\'t really exciting. It is AYCE (I think) and for the price  it was pretty good for AYCE."
David S.,Santa Ana  CA,162,33,,11/14/2013,4.0,"I\'ve come here quite a few times with different circles of friends and I\'ve never had a bad experience. Their beers haven\'t really stood out to me but the menu is huge! I actually like having a big menu  some people might not  but I really like the huge selection of food they seem to have. When I\'ve gone there I\'ve gotten their Calzones and their personal pizzas and like I said they\'ve been perfect every time. The dessert ""the pazookie"" is amazing my friend and I usually get it every time we go there... Assuming we have room after our dinner. I\'ve also tried their pasta and it\'s been perfectly fine as well. The waters/waitresses have always been pleasant... I think I may have had one time where one wasn\'t all that attentive but for the most part it\'s been perfect. It seems to get pretty crowded at night so sound may be an issue but it\'s never really been a big enough issue for me not to enjoy going there with friends."
Rebecca C.,Orange  CA,11,5,3,8/31/2011,1.0,I went here last night with my girlfriend and we both woke up with food poisoning! To make matters worse  she's a nursing mom and her baby is sick now too! STAY AWAY.
Kari P.,Valley Village  Los Angeles  CA,81,45,2,4/10/2008,3.0,Why do I bother?Oh wait I remember why  becuase you are centrally located in between all my friends! Pretty much that's it.Okay so I will give Bj's kudos for taking my reservation for a large party and actually having a table ready for us when we got there. That was cool  rarely has that ever been the case anywhere I have gone. I thought it would be fun to go to Bj's with 11 lesbians (and 1 straight girl) because who doesn't love the name Bj's more than lesbians...oh the irony of it all.The waiters were quick. I'll give them that. Although one friend arrived late and never got her drink. She was charged and the waiter took it off of her bill but no apology. (I think he figured that for parties over 10 he is getting an automatic 17% gratuity anyways as is written in the policy) A little hint buddy you would have gotten an extra $20 but what ev...  The food  always subpar. No one ever really finds what they want on this menu  yet no one ever finds anything that makes them yak either. Mediocre for sure. I did have the pizza last night and you know what!!!!....It still wasn't good. I managed to get two pieces in the 'ol gullet anyway. Probably just because I had lubed the eating tube with two berry burst ciders first. Now that is one reason to visit this establishment. So over all. Ok service  Ok food  Great Looking table of hott lesbians...for that Bj's you get 3 stars.
Arthur W.,Northridge  CA,55,59,15,1/16/2011,4.0,I love coming here to this bj's. I think this one is more open. Although during the very hot and cold weather  i wouldn't suggest sitting outside. The atmosphere isn't that great and I am very sorry to say but the service is slower than inside. Yet  we have had really good service while being inside. The only problem we had is when they are busy  they do tend to forget things. It was my birthday that day  and i guess my brother reminded our waiter 3 times about my birthday that day  which isn't much of a concern to me  the food was great. i was already planning to order a pizaookie anyways.. but my bro had told me he had to tell other waiters about my birthday and then when they did get it  they brought it to few wrong tables  and yeah. But  Bj's food is good.. i enjoy eating the filet with the 2 choices of sides. or rigatoni with chicken (my favorite dish amongst)...and of course we always have a bbq chicken pizza large as an appetizer.. bbq chicken pizza flavor is very good. it has sweet onions which makes the pizza sweet in flavour.. and has tomatoes.. like big tomatoes that you can see on it.. so as to food .. they are vey consistent on detail and taste. I'd wish for the chicken rigatoni.. they have an option to add more rigatoni noodles... instead of me having to order 2 dishes.. lol.. or 1 dinner and 1 lunch dish.. oh well.. thats about it.. !
Jonathan Z.,Cypress  CA,589,1174,1174,9/11/2008,4.0,Good eats is good wherever you find it. Bj's is a chain  but who cares. It has some great tasting food. Have a great greasy pizza and cold beer. Gluttony at it's best.
Theresa F.,Tustin  CA,1,20,1,10/8/2011,4.0,Fun atmosphere  great food. The pizza is pricey but so worth it. It's the closest we have to east coast style.
Rod M.,Santa Ana  CA,0,5,,7/22/2013,1.0,Unprofessional employees. Caught the server taking about our party to her fellow employees on how she was giving us attitude. Never coming to this location again.
Twelve J.,Anaheim  CA,75,29,7,3/26/2011,4.0,this location is always busy in the evenings and on the weekends. the bartenders were attentive and took our order even though we were standing. there were lots of servers  hosts and bus boys wait for the table was about 30-40 minutes. service was prompt and food came out pretty quick since we only ordered a few appetizers. pulled pork sliders (4) with thin fries. awesome. even good the next morning!avocado egg rolls with some sweet dipping sauce. they have a slight tang and the mix of textures makes every bite a little different.ordered the new ahi poke  the tuna looked fresh and thick. cubed pieces served on some lettuce with fried wontons. not too soggy but not as scrumptious as a sushi place.had some beers and appetizers with friends on a friday afternoon for about 2 hours. didn't feel rushed even with the crowds.
Yralla L.,Orange County  CA,10,373,,5/29/2010,3.0,My favorite item to eat at BJ's is the artichoke dip. I also like their selection of beers. I have had their soups  salads  burgers  and pizzas. They have all been okay. The soups are usually too salty. The salads are okay. I found a gnarly pubic-like hair in my cobb salad and that made me want to barf. Yuck. The burgers are okay. I am not a big fan of the deep dish pizza. It is too greasy and too bready. I forgot to mention that the pizookie is the bomb. The food at Karl Strauss and Yard House taste so much better.
Christine J.,Tulsa  OK,30,205,27,6/17/2008,2.0,OATMEAL RAISIN PIZOOKIE.Get it to go because it's usually crowded.Other than that  the food is barf  barf  barf  barf  barf  and barf.The end.
Judy B.,Lake Forest  CA,0,10,,8/29/2013,1.0,I went there because my friend said they had great food. Well maybe  but mine wasn't. I ordered a medium done cheeseburger-how can you mess that up? Well  it came with no sauce (thousand Island) so I had to find a waitress and send it back  then it came back and of course it was cold and the meat was dry and well done-fries were cold too-yuck-waste of $12.
Pete M.,Huntington Beach  CA,0,45,1,4/19/2013,5.0,Wife and I went here for lunch after a long bike ride through the canyon. Place was packed but we were given a booth near the bar immediately. I had a burger with side salad and a nice red ale. Wife had a black and blue flatbread and salad combo with iced tea. Food was good and hit the spot. Beer was a recommendation from our waiter and went very well with my meal. We both agree this is a keeper and would order our meals again. The whole lunch was $24 and sooo much better than some of the numerous fast food joints in the area. No plastic chairs  fouresent lights or ordering from the counter. Everyone was really nice from greeters  to the runners and especially our waiter Ryan C. Keep up the good work... We'll be back!
J P.,Tustin  CA,7,22,3,4/19/2010,4.0,"no cork fee!! bring your own wine!! the mediterranean pizza is bomb but the salads are a rip off. seriously  the slalds are a bit on the ""wee-man"" side i would reccomend this resteraunt If you are trying to impress a girl by taking her here instead of your regular dive bar."
Ryan L.,Irvine  CA,23,36,,3/3/2011,4.0,Great beers  great pizza  great pizookies . good atmosphere. This place has it all  just go and splurge on hearty food  lifes to short not to enjoy it! :)
Jason P.,Irvine  CA,0,2,,8/25/2013,3.0,At BJ's you pretty much know what you're going to get. Corporate style brewery with decent food and pretty good service standards. Servers tend to be hit and miss but you can tell that the effort is there. On the last few visits the host stand seems to be the biggest opportunity in the restaurant. It is definitely a difficult area to manage especially with long waits  but hospitality needs to improve. They need a little coaching on being friendly  smiling  and treating guests with respect instead of like a heard of cattle.
Deborah H.,Medford  MA,0,21,,8/20/2013,4.0,Solid food  great selection of drinks  and satisfactory service. I've also held a small event here and all the catering went very smoothly. Everyone was a pleasure to work with and the food was very reasonably priced.
Cali F.,Manhattan  NY,0,29,,8/18/2013,2.0,Hope this gets management's attention - I've been to BJs once every few weeks since it opened with my family and was always happy with the service and food. However  the past few months  especially the last 2 times  have been disappointing in terms of service. It takes way too long to get our food and the restaurant is not even half full. The food still tastes great but waiting over 15 minutes for lunch is not acceptable. Last month  the manager at the time realized the problem and gave us one lunch free. Last time  my son finished his soup and salad before the rest of us got our lunches (just sandwiches and salads). BJs Management - please fix!
Brian L.,Placentia  CA,0,11,,8/9/2013,3.0,Giving three because today was an aberration  but today was some of the worst service I've ever had anywhere. We were ignored the first 20 minutes after seating and it took forever to get refills on drinks or anything else we needed. To be fair the waitress was clearly a trainee but her trainer did nothing to correct the horrible service we were getting. Food was good as always.
S R.,Irvine  CA,10,195,88,10/6/2010,2.0,This was pretty bad. All the beers I tried tasted stale and the food was overpriced and tasteless. Service was pretty mediocre as well.
Dee D.,Aliso Viejo  CA,2,7,,5/17/2011,1.0,i love BJs.. just not this one. Theyre so rude  not efficient  and i've been there three times. i love the BJS in HB and Laguna Hills WAY BETTER. This location sucks
Rachelle L.,Irvine  CA,81,25,1,5/18/2010,1.0,I've been to this BJ's plenty of times. Unfortunately  it seems that the last 3 times I've been to this BJ's it has just been disappointing. I thought that now that they have competition next door with Lazy Dog's they'd try a little harder to impress you with the service  but no  they probably don't care. The last three times  my friends and I have gone to a late dinner around 9:30  which is not a very busy dinner hour  service has been pretty bad. It took over 15 minutes to get anyone to come up to us to take our order. Before that  all the servers just looked at our table without asking if anyone has helped us. It wasn't until after I asked another waitress to send over our server did our waiter come over (after another 5 minutes). On top of the late service  they forgot to get us place settings; they screwed up our order; and they'd drop off food and drinks and walk away so fast that we would not be able to ask them to get us condiments or to tell them they screwed up the order. I'm not one to complain about service that easily  but these servers do not have have the courtesy to ask if you need anything else or even apologize for their mistakes. So I give this BJ's location 1 star  not because of their food  but because of their service. I am probably not going to go to this BJ's location again  especially since there is a Lazy Dog next door with impeccable service and great food and beer.
Johanan L.,San Francisco  CA,34,213,1,1/24/2008,2.0,Ehhhh. This ain't Chicago pizza. I mean  it's oook. But don't call it Chicago Pizza. True Chicago-style pizza has everything inverted except the crust. It goes like this. Crust first  then toppings  then cheese  then sauce. Get with the program.5 stars for the Bazookie  0 stars for the pizza  get the average and pretend I suck at math and think rounding down is correct  and you get 2 stars. LOL.
Paul A.,Irvine  CA,685,105,63,4/25/2010,4.0,"Not exactly ""authentic"" Chicago style deep dish pizza (from what I\'ve been told...personally  I have not been to Chicago so can\'t comment on the authenticity). The main thing I come here for is the pizza. Authentic Chicago style deep dish or not  I find it to be quite good. My favorites are ""B.J.\'s Favorite"" (a sort of \'the works"" type pizza with everything on it) and the ""Great White"" (Alfredo sauce & chicken). I\'m a sucker for artichoke and spinach dip so I usually get that as an appetizer  it\'s good here but I\'ve had far better. They do have a pretty eclectic menu...not as eclectic as Cheesecake Factory but pretty close  they offer a variety of different items; burgers  salads  pastas and such. For many  the main attraction are the beers. I\'m not much of a beer drinker (I like my Scotch) but will on occasion partake  I\'ve had the Harvest Hefeweizen  Piranha Pale Ale  and Honey Blonde..all of which I enjoyed. Their Scotch selection sucks. The service here is pretty inconsistent...sometimes good  sometimes bad. Something of an oddity that occurs EVERYTIME I come here is that random servers attempt to deliver food to my table that no one ordered...I think one of these days we\'re just not going to say anything and take the free food :)This place usually has a mad wait on Friday and Saturday nights  so arrive early or be prepared to wait awhile."
Dave S.,South Pasadena  Los Angeles  CA,357,247,11,11/6/2007,4.0,"This is one of the nicest BJ\'s I\'ve ever been in. I was only here one other time when it was ridiculously crowded  but last night we came after a gorgefest (i\'m really into ""fests"" for some reason today) at Honda Ya and it was barren and quiet. I like it much better that way as I\'m not a big fan of crowds. at sports bars. ever. We had come down for one thing and one thing only: Pizookie. For those that don\'t know what a pizookie is it\'s a personal pan pizza sized fresh baked cookie that\'s left in the pan and then topped with three scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. So simple  yet so good. I had the peanut butter cookie  I highly recommend it. So yeah.. four stars for this experience.. good idea  Frank."

The Blackened Chicken Pizza used to be an item on the menu but got taken out for some reason. They still make it however  and is probably the best pizza they have to offer that's not Great White. I love the great white  but sometimes  I'm just in the mood for some marinara sauce and corn on pizza is always good.The California Chicken sandwich is their best sandwich that I've tried. Roasted red & green peppers in melted mozzarella cheese is such a good combo that I often overlook. I suppose it's all about using just the right amount of cheese.You may enjoy the onion strings  which I think tasted Ok. I thought it was too difficult to eat cause the strings were too thin and small. The APPEAL = 8Looking forward to coming back anytime  though not anytime soon cause we go there a bit too often.Pizooke!
James D.,Woodland Hills  CA,1,21,,7/8/2013,3.0,"This place is OK. Their beers and appetizers are good (not great). But their ""famous pizza"" is a disappointment every time I have it. It lacks in cheese and especially in toppings."
Raymond S.,Irvine  CA,336,192,28,10/17/2006,4.0,BJ's has become the obvious first choice when it comes to planning a get-together dinner party/event...or if you really crave Chicago-style pizza. Why? There's so many reasons. The food; the location; the hours; the good times...oh what the hell  who are we kidding here? It's the alcohol!\r Seriously though  BJ's is all about great food and having a good time there while at it. It's no surprise the stars of the place are their Chicago-style deep dish pizzas and their wide selection of inhouse brews. \r The Tustin location is especially large and classy looking  making it the ideal location to host large parties for any sort of occasion or just to hang out during playoff times. There's huge TV screens at the bar to watch all the latest sports playing. Just be prepared to arrive early as this place gets crowded on most week nights  especially the weekends. Service has been good for the countless times that I have been here. With larger parties that are out in the patio  service can be on the slow side occasionally. Your mileage may vary.\r The food is great. While nothing particular stands out as the greatest or the best  BJ's does serve pretty good meals that will fulfill your hunger. Their signature Chicago-style deep dish pies is one big reason to come here and a definite must if you're a first timer. Their pizzas are as thick as they are tasty - that's how Chicagoans roll. I especially like the barbeque chicken pizza and blackened chicken. But even the plain tomato and cheese will hit the spot.\r If pizza ain't your thang  then there's the pasta and sandwiches. I can't really comment on these as I almost always get the pizza when I'm here  but the pastas are quite filling and large. Pizzas can range anywhere from $9-20 depending on size. Of particular note: I wasn't too satisfied with their buffalo wings. It lacked that spicy punch to it but still decent.\r Then there's the brews. A half dozen selections of house beers  hefs and dark ales. All pretty good but I mainly come here with friends for the ciders. The berry burst cider is amazing as it's sweet and tangy yet strong without you knowing it. We order at least a pitcher or 2 of this stuff and then it's all over for us... The cider is so popular  on two occasions they were sold out so we opted for pear cider instead which is equally as good.\r Finally  there's dessert. You can't end the night at BJ's without some pizookie ($4.95). It's so good  it's deadly. Literally. Even though it's really just a big warm and chewy cookie topped with ice cream  one has to wonder just how much sugar they jack into these things cause it's just insanely uber sweet. I'm sure these babies will make one diabetic in no time. It's almost ridiculous!...but mmm...so good! a love/hate thing  indeed.\r But maybe the reason BJ's is so popular is that they open late every night till around midnight. That makes it a good hangout spot late into the night when hunger strikes or for just when you want to eat with your buddies. Whatever the reason  it's good times fo sho.
Edwin H.,Chino Hills  CA,2,23,2,11/25/2010,4.0,Went here with my girlfriend. Great Service! They had a new kind of steak on the menu that they asked us to rate (I forgot the name of it) but it was pretty dry. otherwise Great Visit!
huong d.,Anaheim  CA,26,18,2,10/6/2010,2.0,Service was pretty good until the check came.... I took out my credit card to pay and placed it at the edge of the table. No sign of the waiter  the manager walked passed our table at least 3 times and looked at our table and just walked away. So finally after sitting there for about 10 min. the waiter finally decides to pick up the check. what wonderful service we had from the manager!
Kenny H.,Cleveland  OH,220,457,8,3/26/2006,2.0,If you have 3 hours to kill by going to dinner (or lunch for that matter)  then by all means  go here. Yes  the food at times is great and there's some decent brew here as well. The downside? This location is always crowded (not sure that it warrants this type of attention)  the service is sub par  and the amount of time it takes to get your food is obscene. There have been at least 3 times I've been here where I've had to talk to management because they either got my order wrong  forgot something on my order  or it took 30mins+ for a friggen pizooke. Try out some of the other BJs locations  which are much better. As for this one  skip it.
Anthony S.,Los Angeles  CA,64,184,1,7/22/2008,5.0,Sunday morning and you are trying to find a place to soak up last night's booze. Your hazy gaze sends you into the Costco version of a strip mall - The Marketplace. The last thing you need as you nurse a hangover are choices. By the 11 o'clock hour  sober as Billy Graham on a Sunday  or hung over as a red head from Minnesota  the choices are busy. Me and my woozy friend sought out IHOP  but the idea of waiting didn't seem appetizing. Then  like a hidden oasis in the middle of an overdeveloped suburb  BJ's revealed that it now serves brunch. You mean I can drink a pitcher of that luscious beer and have eggs and toast. The gods are smiling on us. Well me  not Alison  she's done after two bites of the toast (which will end up the primer for a new coat of paint on the passenger side of my car).Considering the choices (oh so many  too many for any American) this place should be bookmarked. The servers are eager to please. The booze is there if you need. And the potatoes are sooo f**king delicious.
Gabrielle S.,Irvine  CA,137,6,,3/17/2013,3.0,i have gone to this BJ's for many many years. i mostly go back just because its a fun place and the food is pretty good. i stick with the classic cheese pizza and the chicken brocolli alfredo pasta. nothing is exceptionally good but i dont think they over price and ive gotten to know a few of the waitresses which is nice. i think the service could be a helluva lot better but thats the food industry today!
Farakh Z.,Long Beach  CA,41,158,10,8/23/2010,4.0,Food was good service was lacking. Had five different servers so couldn't figure out who was helping us. The pizza is always delicious and the portions are large. Wish they prices were a little bit less expensive  but overall you get a good meal.
Arnold E.,Orange County  CA,428,582,333,12/15/2006,4.0,Believe it or not  but BJ's is actually a 'healthy' restaurant. Think about it: oil  grease  and carbs cancelled out by alcohol  fiber-packed veggies  and strenuous talking  laughing  chewing  and staying awake! Pure genius...if you've been reading all the latest research...But seriously  I love this place. The beer is great and is available in several varieties. You can order a beer sampler 'appetizer' or (if you're hosting a small get-together) a mini-keg to wet your whistle. The pizza's excellent...though I only order the BJ's Favorite (I'm not too keen on pizza with white sauce  barbeque pizza  or Hawaiian-style pizza). Pretty much everything else on the menu is good as well. My wife digs the potatoes  the salads  and the bbq  too. If you're into dessert with a pizza-like twist  order the Pizookie (no  it's not one of those crappy cinnamon/sugar pizza desserts from Pizza Hut or Domino's).This BJ's is almost always crowded so expect to wait anywhere from 15 minutes to a week. Just kidding. During football season  Monday nights are hectic. I've been to the ones in Brea  Huntington Beach  and Cerritos  too. Quality's very consistent from branch to branch  so the food's always good. If you haven't already visited BJ's should go soon.
Me Y.,Seattle  WA,43,82,36,9/15/2013,1.0,"call and order the two person party (med pizza  two salads  a big ol\' pizookie for $20) - ""your order will be ready to pick up at curbside service in 15 mins."" I wait 20 for good measure and can\'t find an empty curbside service parking spot. Park elsewhere and walk in. Take out section is full of people waiting. My turn  I give them my name  ""your order isn\'t ready yet but I can ring you up now. oh  I need a manager to ring this up"". I pay with credit card and see that my order is 3rd in line.  I wait  I wait  I notice that the people who were there before me are getting their food  shouldn\'t be too long now  more people come in and order takeout  they get their food  I haven\'t seen mine yet. I ask ""how much longer for my food?"" guy trots off to go ""find out"". Don\'t see him for awhile again. Mgr comes over and asks if I\'ve been helped and I say someone is checking on my takeout order. Wait some more  wait  wait  guy comes back  gives some food to some other people that ordered after me  and I ask again ""how much longer for my order?"" he says he\'ll go check on it. I wait some more  wait  wait  mgr asks if I\'ve been helped  I say again ""how much longer for my order?"". He trots off to find out. By now  it\'s been an hour since I arrived. I locate another employee and tell them I want a refund. She has to trot off to find the manager. Mgr arrives  re-swipes my card  fumbles with the touchscreen menu for several minutes  says it will take 4-5 days before it drops off my account. No  I\'m really sorry  I\'ll comp you a pizookie  here\'s a coupon  this has never happened before  just nothing except a blank face that doesn\'t even seem to register what just took place. Nothing near the way a store manager should respond to such a f*&K up. I\'m pretty sure they need a new manager  maybe two or three."
Andy C.,Irvine  CA,51,123,6,1/3/2007,4.0,This place is exactly what OC diners gravitate towards. Comfortable  consistent  unimaginative  yet priced fairly. They have good microbrews for $4 a pint (get the red  blonde or hef) and awesome appetizers (santa fe springrolls  nachos  thin crust pizza). If you get there from 4-7 or after 10pm on a weekday  you get 1/2 off mini deepdish pizzas and dollar off pints too. Their deepdish gets overall thumbs up from most people but isn't anything insanely good or authentic  but it grows on you. I think their classic bjs burger is excellent and the turkey sandwich is good if you drown it in some kind of sauce. The blackened chicken stuffed baked potato is good  and the calzone are crispy and satisfying. There's a lot of little things that are good if you take the time to order stuff other than deepdish.On the other hand  there are some downsides to BJs... If you don't sit in the bar area  be prepared for some slow service  I mean  order 2 drinks at a time because the waiter won't be back for a while. If you avoid going there during peak times (6-8:30) then you should be seated okay  but I prefer finding a spot at the bar  which is first come first serve. As for their food  sometimes their salad is old and gross but just ask for a new one and it they'll get it to you without question. Pasta isn't special at all  so i'd avoid it because meat and potatoes is where they shine. Oh and if you're on a diet... just avoid this place altogether  even their salad is drowned in bacon bits and dressing.I can't say i'm a meat and potatoes kind of person  but I find myself craving BJs a lot more than other restaurants that I'd call great. After 3 pints of Jeremiah Red and a mountain of nachos  there's really no way you can dislike the place  so let yourself be fat and happy at BJ's  it's great.
Andy P.,Cypress  CA,82,728,133,1/4/2010,4.0,I've been to this particular location many times  mostly for birthday parties. I suppose there's only so much seating here for large groups b/c the wait is impossible  even with a reservation (having to wait for previous parties to finish). The pizza is good here  and so are the fries. Haven't tried the beer here  but heard it's great.
Joseph H.,Los Angeles  CA,28,103,23,2/13/2008,2.0,"Very good food  but this restaurant really gets dinged by the poor service.Is it just me  or do a lot of the waiters in Orange County kind of have a ""I\'m-so-much-better-than-this-job"" attitude when it comes to their occupation?The result is evident at this B.J.\'s. Except for being served well one time (maybe its because of the large group + alcohol?)  the waiters just don\'t give a damn. I swear  most times our food could have been delivered quicker if I got up and fetched it. It is not uncommon to see a group of the waiters conjugate at the front of the restaurant  chatting it up  only to remember that they have a job to do  not because they want to or are obligated to  but because they would get fired by their manager. Oh wait  the manager is over there chatting with them too. Damn  I wish I were having as much fun as they were...P.S. lunch is surprisingly good here (tons of lunch-portion menu options). P.P.S. I must have become tolerant from all the bad service I have received in this County to continually return. At least that\'s how I justify myself."
mike a.,Orange  CA,12,31,1,12/14/2010,4.0,Went by for a quick dinner  really enjoyed the decor and the menu was full of great choices. I had the Italian Market chop salad and a couple of Margaritas  my wife had the pot stickers and BBQ chicken salad. We sat in the bar area which I recommend  try to avoid the patio area  its too noisy...The food was great !
Steve T.,Irvine  CA,0,1,,4/5/2011,4.0,Never had much food here  mostly hang out at the bar for a few pints.Service at the bar is hit and miss; if you go on a night when Michael is there you're in good shape; if you hit a night when Kim's there  well you've hit a streak of bad luck.Stick with the RED   you can't go wrong.
ashleigh j.,Phoenix  AZ,0,12,,10/12/2012,5.0,always good  they have great deals for family size take out and are always open until 11 or 12 at night. perfect for the late date or getting off work late.
Char S.,Irvine  CA,2,14,2,12/11/2011,1.0,Probably the worst dinner experience we have had in a long time. Sitting on their patio in the evening is a nightmare. They seat their large parties there and the noise is deafening. The service was very poor because the large parties took the attention of the staff. The large parties did not sit but walked around acting like it was a private room. Really  really bad!
Eugenia Y.,Oakland  CA,50,95,1,4/7/2008,4.0,I don't know why  but it seems all the restaurants in Irvine like to skimp. If you go to BJ's somewhere else  like say  in Riverside or another more MODEST community  food isn't skimped on. It's still good though. i enjoy having to use a fork and knife to eat my pizza. Greasy as always  but it's pizza  what do you expect? I usually eat the pizza and rarely eat anything else that is offered. Their pizookie is awesome! The tastiest thing there. You get a free one if it's your birthday too! The Beers  i haven't really tried. But everyone I go with loves them.
Veronica R.,Santa Ana  CA,2,3,,10/21/2012,1.0,So  we get there and they say the rest of our party has been seated  but lo and behold no one is there yet. Forget to check in to refill our drinks. Waited forever for appetizers which were cold. Had to ask for our pizza which was also cold and tasted bad. Manager discounted our concerns. Never again.
Maome S.,Emerson  NJ,28,209,4,9/15/2006,4.0,Great pizza  beer  and pazooki!Get the peanut butter one with vanilla ice cream!
Yogi B.,Irvine  CA,0,37,4,4/3/2007,3.0,"A nice middle of the road restaurant that makes their own beer. That alone is interesting  and pretty darn tasty. I wish they had better displays of the brewing process going on and I am a little suspicious of are they actually making the beer there or is it just for show. Back in the late 80\'s early 90\'s there was a terrific brew house ""Gorky\'s"" in Hollywood. Now that was FANTASTIC because you could smell the different processes going on to make the beer. Well the beer at BJ\'s is good  and that is what matters.The Fish n\' Chips are just okay. OMG the jalapeno pizza was delicious and the worst culinary mistake of my life. I was crapping fire for days. I was flaming in a place that really concerned me  but I couldn\'t mention to anyone. Did the maniac doing the cooking put too many on the pizza  was he suppose to remove the seeds? I don\'t know  but that it is a wicked meal that you will never forget.  Oh wait  I have also ordered their enormous baked potatoes with all of the toppings. You can\'t go wrong with that and is a pretty good take home item as well. A casual place  at a casual price  for a pleasant meal. The waits are long a peak times  so call to see if they take reservations."
Jordan P.,Tustin  CA,42,605,194,12/1/2009,4.0,Jeremiah Red! Just discovered this beer here and its now one of my favorite beers. 7.5%  happy hour  can't beat it.
Melody K.,Irvine  CA,30,211,11,7/18/2007,4.0,Their food is good all around American mix. BJ's pizza is really good too  but a bit expensive if you ask me.They have a good happy hour but its only in the bar. Good Luck trying to find a spot to sit in the bar. I once waited a half hour trying to get a table but the wait for a regular table was faster! =/They brew their own beer that tastes great!! BJ's has them on tap but they don't have any other beer brands on tap.**NOTE**The wait staff does not know which table is which  especially if you sit out on the patio. Your server is not always the person to bring out your meal and I don't know if that's one of the problems. They will either try to give you someone else's food or try to give someone else your food. I have had to flag down the waiters carrying our meals so that they serve it to the correct table. I have learned to watch the wait staff when they walk by with food to see if its mine.
Ashley K.,Irvine  CA,419,38,6,1/1/2010,4.0,i lovooovoovoe bj'sthe appetizer sampler is gooooooodthe piiizzaaa iss so thick and crusty yummand the pizookies are so warm and gooey and perfectfour stars for the qualityi would have given five but i just don't like the overpriced menu. i mean  you can bake your own pizookie and it'll cost you less than five bucks but a pizzookie from bjs is at least ten bucks [? not sure] but i know it's expensiveALSO  the service was kinda ehhh...i guess the waitress thought she could be a b-head to us cause my friends and I are high school kids  but we were'nt being rowdy  rude  etc. and we had to wait ten minutes drooling over our pizookies for sppooons.tip: go with a group of at least sixwe each paid 15 dollarsand we got the appetizer sampler  2 medium pizzas (ithink) and a large pizoookie(note; these were teenagers..with big appetites :] )
Debbi P.,Brentwood  CA,33,136,5,3/6/2008,3.0,"Haven\'t been to Chicago yet so can\'t really say if this is truly indicative of Chicago-style or not  but it\'s still good Pizza  deep dish but nothing new or fancy. The service was so average it\'s not even worth mentioning.The 3***:The desert however  was sickeningly yummy. You know  that kind of \'so-good-I-can\'t-stop-so-I-think-I\'m-gonna-be-sick-now"" desert... it was a deep dish white choc mac nut cookie... (Pakoozie something or other) ...couldn\'t resist. I am the cooki monster after all"
Terry T.,Placentia  CA,433,14,,8/24/2011,1.0,"Where do I begin... i hate writing bad reviews being in the industry but i know how long things should take and steps of service. if seating in the bar is self seating then bussing should be done efficiently. We waited for a booth for 10 mins. My girlfriends lemondrop martini was severely under poured. We ordered our food and let our server know we were going to be ordering dessert at the end of our meal... the food came out ""likitty split"" but with no set ups. Half way through our meal the check was dropped (big no no) and our server disappeared  we were never asked if we wanted anything before last call. He came back to pick up the check and we informed him that we wanted to order a pizooki he took or order and litterally ran to the kitchen. Only to come back and inform us that the kitchen was already being closed down. At this point he should have inform the manager and have him touch our table  but the manager was nowhere to be seen the whole night. Needless to say we were pretty pissed considering we let him know that we were going to order dessert when we were done with our meal. It sucks cause I know he was in the back doing his closing sidework trying to get out asap and sacrificed quality of service"
Kirun M.,Manhattan  NY,114,429,,6/2/2009,4.0,When you have lived in Irvine  you're forced to review chains because that's all they got! For happy hour this place rocks! For lunch  the service is a little slow...but the food is great. I love their minestrone soup! It's so delicious. Their pizzas are SO good-duh. The sandwiches are hit or miss  but you live you learn. Their stuffed baked potatoes are incredib(ly gigantic). What else...their appetizer food is yummy especially during happy hour...why pay more?
Tim H.,Orange County  CA,134,336,2,5/12/2007,5.0,The menu is comprised of mainly simple recipes that might not seem THAT impressive at first but once you've tried it  you'll love it. Honestly  the best thing to get here is the pizza. They serve it in a deep dish pan so the crust is always perfect. This place brews their own beer so if you want  try the beer sampler for a taste of each of their best brews. Finally  you need to get dessert. I don't care if you're full  you need to get the Pizookie. Ice cream on a cookie doesn't seem all that great but once the cookie melts in your mouth with the ice cream  you'll want more. Recap:BeerPizzaPizookie
Alex L.,Tustin  CA,130,54,1,8/5/2007,5.0,Its obvious that happy here is a greatd deal. In enjoy the bbq chicken pizza. The chicken tenders with buffalo wings sauce is a must have for me. I just like it. For large groups you cant go wrong bcs of the variety and good food. It is always consistant. This location does get really crowded. The wait can be up to 1 1/2. Yikes.
Miche A.,San Diego  CA,5,182,,9/24/2007,3.0,"I\'ll begin with why I love BJ\'s1) Pazookies...warm cookie pizza with Ice Cream = scrumptious2) All the drinks are amazing  I\'m not a beer drinker but I\'ve heard nothing but great comments about the many different drafts they have. And here is where I had the best cosmo EVER...seriously...best EVER!!!3) The pizza is delicious! And I\'ve ordered many different things on the menu and never been disappointedNow for the bad part......1) Wait  wait wait! No matter the time or day you will have to wait. Last week I met a friend there for dinner...5 pm on a TUESDAY and we still had a 20 minute wait...2) Don\'t go in big groups  they can\'t handle it. I decided to have my 21st birthday dinner there and lets just say that it took 3 days of phone calls back and forth and me hounding the manager (they kept ""transferring"" me from one person to another) to get a simple reservation locked down. In total I was put on hold for over 45 minutes.... definitely a let down3) I have had many rude servers while eating here. Servers who completely crossed the line of appropriate behavior to a girl who just could have cared less...she literally brought the dishes out and just left them on the empty neighboring table and told us to ""grab which one is yours""....now I don\'t expect to be treated like the queen of England but isn\'t distributing the dishes to the right person a requirement of the job???4) And the last time I ate there we had multiple problems with the bill. They charged about $30 more than I signed for. And again  I was put on hold forever when trying to get ahold of a manager who could take care of it. AND AGAIN it took about 2 days of back and forth phone calls to get the problem corrected. Needless to say  I come here for drinks and appetizers (or pizza). They do take to go orders as well. Just a shame  they could easily have 5 stars if they did better at screening who they hire."
Ray R.,Newark  CA,41,163,7,10/17/2007,4.0,SWEET JESUS.You can feed a third world country with one of their pizzas.And that cookie and ice cream thing; HOT MESS!
Thomas D.,Irvine  CA,84,238,2,10/31/2009,4.0,Love coming here with a big group of friends. Food is decent  nothing amazing but good enough. The reason for the 4 stars is the pizzookie. One of the best desserts out there  party platter for me and a few friends or two party platters. Always amazing
Billie B.,Garden Grove  CA,70,67,17,1/9/2009,3.0,Went for lunch today with two friends. Told you I go out often. It's becoming quite insane. :)Anyways we put our name in for the wait. We decided to be 'table stalkers' in the bar area(you linger til someone pays their bill and bolt for the table)...and it worked  within 2 minutes we had a choice of two tabletops and a booth  we took the latter. We had no setups  aka silverware and napkins..had to go ask for some  after our app. came(wtf?) The app was good-southwest eggrolls..I got the tomato bisque soup-sooooo yummmmmy!!! I totally recommend. Friend got a loaded pizza  I got a mediterranean pizza(delish!!!!)  and other friend the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and veggies(It was GIGANTIC!!!!!)..and we all 3 got strawberry lemonade...server was obviously super busy  and nobody seemed to want to offer refills  so I asked the server..then waited like 5 min  so I asked the busser and he brought my refill back  then 20 sec. later she brought my orig. refill..oh well...everyone seems to be understaffed these days...damn economy...I love their food...the service was decent. She was busy  but come on bussers and hosts help a girl out....
Cecilia H.,Irvine  CA,0,13,,8/23/2012,2.0,Food is okay. I had a wedge salad and it was the worst salad. Very little dressing and two tiny pieces of bacon. Awful! Always their featured beer is expensive. Not worth it. Like bjs too. Oh well.
chris b.,New York  NY,79,200,3,10/26/2009,4.0,This Bj's is a fun one to go to. Crowded  lots of TV's  noisy. Waits can be quite long on busy nights. Bar seating can help bypass the wait but even that fills up easily. I like going to this Bj's with big groups at non peak times like weekend lunches. Or going here in small groups works too for dinner at the bar. No comment on the food (except Got Carbs?)  it's commercial BJ's fair and the same as any other location. The crowds that move en masse to this BJ's are both the positives and negatives of this BJ's vs all others.
K C.,Irvine  CA,13,47,1,1/14/2012,2.0,This place used to be a favorite but the quality of food and service have gone downhill. We went for a birthday lunch recently and were seated quickly  but when I told the server we were expecting 2 more people she said to inform the hostess. So we did and then nothing happened and our guests were actually standing because they had no where to sit. Finally my husband dragged another table over and 2 chairs to add to ours. The whole time we could see 3-4 servers standing around chatting inside while we were managing ourselves. Then my friends order didn't come but the food was so meh that after telling the server and still not getting it  we cancelled it.
Alex M.,Irvine  CA,6,21,,3/16/2006,4.0,If you love deep dish pizzas  this is the place for you!My family and I used to go to the BJ's in Brea until they finally opened one close to home. But try to go before or after dinner or even lunch unless you want to wait about 30 minutes for a seat. Although sitting at the bar cancels out any waiting unless that too is full.Some of the greatest Deep Dish Pizzas reside here at BJ's. You can get the usual pepperoni  sausage  etc. but it's best to try some of their original pizzas. I LOVE the Buffalo Chicken Pizza which has buffalo chicken  celery  onions  and a side of ranch dressing. Even their standard pizza with pepperoni and tomatoes is great. You can get the pizza in a nice mini size for those who want their own pizza but I like to get small and bring the rest home for the next day.If you're not into pizza  you're in luck because BJ's has some great appetizers and sandwiches. Occasionally I get a Chicken Breast Sandwich on the Garlic Cheese Roll. One of my favorite sandwiches of all time.But you can't forget the Pazooki which is a signature BJ's dessert. They put cookie dough into a deep dish pan  cook it  and top it off with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. The best thing about this  apart from the taste  is that you can get it in whatever cookie flavor you love. I usually get a Black & White which is half Chocolate Chip and the other half White Chocolate Macadamia Nut.The only small problem I have with BJ's is how long it usually takes for the food. It's best to get drinks  appetizers  and a few friends so you can forget about the wait and just chill out.
daniel b.,Orange  CA,5,13,,2/26/2010,4.0,"one of my favorite spots to come to late night. love their micro-brews and i like all of their food. it\'s mellow and not too much of a ""scene""  although there is some talent that comes through.the only downside is the seating at the bar gets limited during their late night happy hour (10pm-close) so you have to either get their early or wait around for an open spot. service is hit or miss  depending on the server; there are some good ones  but the bad ones are really bad.dependable spot if you need a place for solid drinks and food."
James J.,Tustin  CA,0,2,,6/24/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Bj's is a great restaraunt.. But im giving it a 1 star for this location because i had visited her one night and i usually come here on a lot of occassions but on my visit for my anniversary i had the worst visit everI made reservations and still waited 30min for our table when we MADE reservations.. Whats the point of a reservation if we have tomwait as long as the customers who didnt??The waitress took forever for drinks  gave very very rude attitude  had no respect  made me go to the bar to get my drink  gave me hassle getting the happy hour price  then the bar tender was just an a**hole argued with me on what time it was because i wanted the happy hour price when clearly i showed him the time and he then said i didnt know what time it was but its a dissappoint me i went thru so much hassle for a beer.. Seriously??.. RULE # 1 Never argue with a customer. Find a Soultion first!! Then we waited an hour for our food...I will never suggest this to people for special occassions.
Walter M.,Huntington Beach  CA,27,9,,4/6/2010,5.0,We always have great service and good food. We eat there regularly and are always happy to go back. If it is busy the staff always does their best to make it easy on you. The pizookie is really good.
Aaron C.,San Diego  CA,45,7,1,7/19/2010,4.0,Standard BJ's experience. This place has a full bar and all the food selections  unlike the smaller BJ's at the beach.
Lina K.,Los Angeles  CA,0,43,3,7/14/2012,3.0,they're known for their pizookies  so don't leave without getting one for dessert.
Mary D.,Glendale  CA,1,14,,5/16/2010,4.0,I went to Bjs in Irvine for the first time with my aunt . She invited me and took me there. I'm happy I went there  everyone was smiling and looked happy and that's what i 'm looking for when i go any where Also  the service was awesome they take good care of us. The food was yummy Specially the Pizza!! Thanks to my aunt for took me there and definitely when i go to that area i should stop byt BJS .
Dru C.,Orange County  CA,654,833,2240,8/16/2008,3.0,I have a love/hate relationship with chain restaurants. The quality of food and service can be so wildly inconsistent  yet I keep coming back for more. This time around  I met a few friends and co-workers after work on a weekday  and this place was already packed with people stuffing their faces with those ridiculous moon-sized pizookies. I've always been a fan of their house-brewed beer  especially the Jeremiah Red. This and the other flavors go down so smooth  that after a few pitchers you'll have to prevent your face from falling flat in a deep dish pizza.
Daniel w.,Tustin  CA,10,62,,3/27/2009,5.0,"I have dreams about their pizza. To anyone who points out that their ""chicago style"" pizza isn\'t chicago style at all... who gives a shit? This is awesome pizza! I rarely try anything else  but when I do  It\'s great as well. Now  we get to the beer. Great beer! You\'ve gotta respect in-house brewing. My personal favorite is the Nutty Brunette. They also have tons of flat screens which are viewable from anywhere in the restaurant (except the patio seating)  so you can catch a game if you like. In short  I love BJ\'s..... oh yes."
gretchen c.,Fallbrook  CA,86,102,11,6/26/2008,2.0,I stopped coming to this BJ's because the parking lot is a nut house & you always have to wait for a table. If you are in the area  I would go for Opah or Bucca over BJ's.
John R.,Tustin  CA,0,37,2,10/8/2009,4.0,I went to BJ's yesterday to see the Angel's game and it was a little crowded. I still waited for a table since their Deep Dish pizza's and hot wings are the best. I would recommend to everyone to go there for Happy Hour. I would also recommend getting there early to get a seat @ the bar.
Sean B.,Livermore  CA,426,31,4,10/4/2008,5.0,They have really good pizza. I went here for my fraternity bid dinner and it was a great place to have dinner.
ROBERT F.,Tustin  CA,0,22,,5/25/2010,5.0,This place is always good. We had a waitress  Monica  who was exceptionnel. She was super nice and accomodating. She went out of her way. Ask for her station. I ordered the lunch special which came with a mini pizza and salad--good deal.
Francisco C.,Garden Grove  CA,5,302,,6/30/2011,4.0,Delicious deep dish pizza and great desserts. I like the ambience and their dishes are reakky tasty. Will definitely visit this place again.
Christine C.,San Francisco  CA,255,195,224,6/4/2010,4.0,been to this place so many times. love their bbq chicken chopped salad and pizzas. and of course the pizookie. only down side is you usually have to wait a good 1 hour before u can get seated on fri/weekend night. service is usually pretty good as well
Michelle J.,Irvine  CA,0,61,8,4/14/2013,2.0,I wanted to give this one star but because I've had good happy hour here i will give it a 2 star. My husband and I came for lunch on Sunday. We were told it was a 10 to 15 minute wait. After 35 minutes  I told my husband to go ask what happened. he was told we were still on the list. Then they call another party that came in after us. Finally we find out they say their computer system is down and instead of a party of 2  they have us as a party of 4 with a baby! Ugh  so then we get seated and they had the nerve to tell us that it's not THEIR fault  the computer is down. Umm  excuse me but you gave us the buzzer and it never went off  you were still giving other diners the buzzers and also telling them 10 to 15 minute wait. If it's not your fault  whose is it?Then we get seated. The menu pages are stuck together with FOOD. I'm afraid to order food now. FINALLY a waitress comes and takes our order. I figure coffee would be good and a salad. She brings the coffee and my husband's beer. We get our entrees and I ask for a coffee refill. After 10 minutes  no refill  no waitress. I ask another waitress because my husband is ready to go to the bar with the empty coffee cup. She brings the coffee - but no cream! How hard can this be! The servers here have not sense of wanting to actually SERVE anyone! The entrees come and they are just ok. The table next to us has their entrees served wrong - the salad wasn't tossed and the dressing wasn't served on the side - they are complaining. the table across from us gets a dessert that they never ordered - the server is wandering around trying to find where to serve it. Then I get my cream for my coffee. Here is a piece of advice: let the servers assigned to the table actually serve the food and take responsibility for their guests. Your serving system stinks! If you order an appetizer be prepared for it to be served with or after your entree. The timing of this restaurant makes no sense. They have redone the menu and it is very confusing with too many choices and the menu selection is just plain dumb - they have 3 chicken sandwiches?!! Why? There is a reason the Lazy Dog Cafe next door is doing so well. We don't come here much anymore and now I remember why. If you just want a pizza and a beer come here. Otherwise  go to the Lazy Dog Cafe next door - where they know how to serve food and drinks. Also  we looked for any NEVER saw a manager on duty. If you are the owner - you might want to ask yourself where your manager was on Sunday!
Mari J.,Upland  CA,8,208,3,9/27/2006,2.0,I've been the this location a couple times. The service is ok  and I guess I went in the off hours because it wasn't especially crowded  but the food is thumbs down. I don't get why everyone loves BJs. I think the food is very mediocre and the tomatoes on the pizza taste like they are straight out of a can. I had an all right chicken sandwich once  but wasn't good enough for me to come running back.
Susan F.,Irvine  CA,0,21,,12/10/2012,1.0,waited one hour at the restaurant for a scampi pasta for take out! and still was charged for the item. not until we asked the manager for a refund did we receive a credit back! really? customer service is severely lacking at this location!
Kyle V.,Los Angeles  CA,101,339,15,3/26/2007,1.0,"oh boy! i\'m going to rip bj\'s a new one.A few friends and myself decided to go to BJ\'s after work for a little happy hour action. When told we were in for a 45 minute wait for a table I went directly to the bar and got a drink. After looking the place over now that I had my drink and I was just getting comfortable  I noticed something disturbing. What I had just noticed is that at least 80% of the patrons in this establishment were fat  ugly  white  middle aged  and lame. DANG!! The quintuple strikeout. OKAY. At this point I ask my friend why he likes the place. He says  ""It\'s just a really chill place."" I guess if you consider an Applebee\'s atmosphere mixed with a hint of McDonald\'s chill you would be correct. We finally get our table and the rest of our party arrives. Immediately we are bugged two or three times by our overweight  ugly server for drinks. We had asked her to wait but she didn\'t know how I guess. We get done with introductions and are ready to order. Fugly comes back an IDs everyone before we order. One friend has an expired ID and she says she won\'t serve him. Okay  she\'s doing her job  but do you still have to be ugly and fat?? Some of us already had a drink so we decide to get one round and then bounce. We get a sampler and the dude with the expired license takes a few sips. He is obviously of age (25) and the license just expired. The manager then comes over and recards everyone (wtf) and threatens to kick us out of anyone not of age drinks. Since we are all of age we continue to drink and 5 minutes later the manager comes over and asks us to leave. If you are into places where lame middle aged  boring  white people congregate to talk about buying new SUVs and their OC watchin\' little kid\'s soccer practices  then GO HERE!!! If you like ugly  boring  fat servers who have no personality  then GO HERE!! If not  go next door to Opah."
Scott B.,Irvine  CA,14,40,6,11/28/2007,1.0,"Double billed by BJ\'s on 11/19. Good thing I used my AMX and they reversed the charge immediately. Two years ago  they added a ""1"" to the front of my tip  increasing it by $10. Once is an oversight  but manipulating my check TWICE is absurd. I\'ve only been there a handful of times. I\'ll never return and I\'m reporting them to the BBB."
Amy S.,Anaheim  CA,1,42,2,5/10/2010,3.0,I ordered their pasta with chicken and broccoli. It was pretty good and satisfied my craving for pasta but did not impress me. The price was pretty high too. The thing I went here for was the Pazookie. Everyone tells me about how great it is. Well all it is is Toll House Cookie Dough baked with ice cream on top. Nothing to extraordinary. I didn't enjoy it here.
Gayle K.,Anaheim  CA,6,28,4,10/31/2006,4.0,Great pizza  for huge sport fans they have a big screen T.V. at the bar and for dessert the pazooki.
Marcy O.,Costa Mesa  CA,56,72,2,1/24/2007,4.0,Great place for happy hour and to catch a game. The avocado egg rolls are to die for. They have personal pizza's on special at happy hour that are delicious and satisfying. They brew their own 'berry burst cider' - a good alternative to beer. Although  I always appreciate a good BJ's brew.
Allie R.,Irvine  CA,34,3,,3/9/2013,2.0,"This has been a go to spot for take out that was not Mexican. This time the whole experience was terrible. We called to place an order and took a few calls to get through. That should have been a warning sign. When we placed the order they told us it would be 15 to 20 minutes. We arrived 20 minutes later and there were 3 people behind the to go desk. One was using the register and the other two were there I guess for decoration since they didn\'t bother to greet me or use the other register to ring up my order. After my order was paid for I waited for a good ten minutes and one of the waitresses tells me that she saw my order and it was almost ready. 15 minutes later she decides to check on it and  well  she disappeared...another ten minutes another person goes to check and then comes back with some food  but not mine. He goes back again and disappears. Finally after waiting 30 minutes there  almost an hour total  they come out with the food. They said that they had to redo the pizza after they messed up on it. Seriously they couldn\'t go and find this out and tell me?! When we get home we find that the burger we ordered was completely cold  the Santa Fe salad had a blob of something in it  and the pizza was hardly warm. What ever happened to the service and why was the pizza that they had to ""remake"" barely warm? They only get two stars because previous experiences were okay."
C T.,Irvine  CA,0,41,2,6/4/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,after this post and a similar email i received from their website  they quickly emailed me and apologized for the poor service and offered me a $50 gift card to try them again. that was a very classy gesture and for that i would returned to the same bj's. i love their food and their pizookies!
Troy L.,Irvine  CA,0,8,,11/8/2010,3.0,Don't do curbside! For a deep Dish Chicago style pizza you can't go wrong  and that is the only reason why I come back to this establishment. I understand they are busy almost all the time though the some of the young staff can be so incompetent and lack customer service skills. I usually order to go as you think it will be quicker than waiting. Though in most cases I have waited much longer than the 15-20 minutes they usually tell me. So now I go inside to pick up. One time after lagging 25 minutes to get there I still waited another 25 minutes for curbside delivery. Even after one took my money promptly and brought me change  I had to call again to get them to acknowledge me  meanwhile the food was sitting there getting cold. After I complained sitting for almost an hour at curbside for my personal pie  I was offered a free soda! Which I declined as I was starving and grumpy by than. When I got home 5 minutes later the cheese was barely melted  and the meal went back into the oven to be re-heated.
Lily P.,Spokane  WA,62,329,53,12/31/2006,3.0,Why do people wait for hours for your standard food? It's ok if you don't have to wait  but not worth it if you do.
Maggie H.,Buena Park  CA,207,202,47,2/4/2010,4.0,the food is pretty good. nice deep dish pizza  variety of drinks. and great service. they happen to forget my order and completely took it off the bill since it came out late. and can you go wrong with a fresh cookie with a scoop of ice cream? i've had the chicken fried steak which was ok (take into consideration that i'm very picky on my southern comfort foods tho  since i use to live in texas). pastas are decent  blackened chicken alfredo fettucine is a dish i've ordered more than once. they have a good selection of mixed drinks on top of their beers.
Jonathan Y.,Monrovia  CA,61,198,1,9/2/2006,4.0,Good food  good brew  but yes very busy. It's near UCI so of course there's college kids. But the TVs are huge (main TV is multiple large projection type)  so if you're going to lounge and are not on a time limit  come here!
Michelle N.,Irvine  CA,42,135,26,10/3/2007,3.0,Bugger. I read all the reviews and thought this place would be relatively tasty  and it turned out to be slightly good. I got the buffalo chicken pizza (mini) with a salad and then split a chocolate chunk pazookie for dessert. Salad was yummy (but it's a salad) but then the pizza came. All I have to say to it is 'meh'. The crust and dough were nice but there was too much salt and spice going on in the topping to really taste anything else and the chicken was dry with crunchy edges. The ranch dressing dip was also bizarre. It sorta tasted ranch-ish with a touch of bleu cheese and  errr  water. I only used this to tame the spice and salt in my mouth and found it left an odd coating. Meh. My friend's pizza (the BJ's fave) looked good  but she wasn't too impressed with the flavours (too salty)  and the sandwiches were all right.I give this place three stars though because of the really scrummy pazookie. Dear Lord. We (6 women) decided to split one because we were so full (they were  I was just feeling kinda icky from that dip) and suddenly spoon fights erupted as people vied for the gooey chocolate chunky bits with the ice cream. See  the pazookie is a cookie baked into a small circular tin with two scoops of vanilla ice cream on top  and is the best thing since sliced bread. Seriously. This place also gets stars because the servers and hosts were super friendly  and they even had the Euro Championship Soccer Qualifiers on  which just warmed my heart. So  come here for the beer and the pazookie  but just say no to the pizza.
Graham W.,Sacramento  CA,69,69,1,5/22/2007,3.0,Standard corporate fare. I thought the amber beer had an unpleasant aftertaste or I woulda really liked it.
marlon e.,Los Angeles  CA,666,798,128,11/20/2008,3.0,great beginnings as they call it everyone calls it appetizers... most of the time thats what i order just because i come here for beer and some munchies.. i don't expect a really great meal from places like this... don't set your expectations too high so that you wont be disappointed... well the service here gets kinda annoying and slow plus they get really busy... i don't know whats the deal with people loving their pizookie so much... its just so easy to make at home damn it... unless your too lazy to heat up a cookie then pile it up with ice cream!
Lolo S.,Santa Ana  CA,0,18,,8/11/2012,4.0,love this place its great! i love the jambalaya and the southwest salad and the pizza. beer is good not great but good  but with everything combined i love it here. i think the turn around of staff is high because every time we go we don't really see familiar faces so the staff can vary but its never been horrible.
John K.,Tustin  CA,17,105,2,6/10/2007,4.0,This is a great place for lunch. Sit outside if the weather permits. Avoid if there's a big game... unless you like a rowdy crowd. The pizza is a nice biscuit type of crust. Very flavorful.
Christina F.,Irvine  CA,8,25,1,6/13/2007,4.0,i've always enjoyed eating at BJ's. they have great service and great food!! the kids meals are winners too! happy face french fries!! the kids love it and if you get a seat facing the big screen tv's...it's a great place to take a family. you don't have to worry about the noise level too since it's already lound in there. great place to hangout and have tasty deep dish pizza. the buffalo chicken pizza is an all time favorite!! the pizookie is also something you gotta have before you leave. the only complaint i have about that is that there isn't enough vanilla ice cream!! not a bad thing!they should open more around irvine since there is always a long wait if you don't go early or make reservations!
katie j.,Irvine  CA,19,20,2,2/13/2008,4.0,you don't fully understand life until you have had the avocado egg rolls.avocado  sun-dried tomato  cilantro  chipotle peppers  cream cheese.....ex nay the tamarind sauce and ask for the south west sauce...its an orgy of flavors in my mouth like i have never experienced.same goes for buffalo chicken pizza. and the Oreo pizzooookieand if you go at night about 10 ish. everything is half off?you cant go wrong.the only reason why i give you 4 stars is because you charge me for a class of tap soda water  when i know it isn't from a bottle and should be free. 3 dollars doesn't cut it man!
Alix L.,Newport Coast  CA,316,171,61,12/19/2007,3.0,This BJs has a really nice bar and private outdoor setting  real fancy... 2pizzas 2bazookis and 6rootbears = $80... WoW.... talk about getting a new job... Not only does it lose a star for the price... but... the place isnt that sanitary either... and no.. you dont have to visit their bathrooms... just stare at your root beer glass the next time you're finished.... and try to scratch off that lil something in the cup (thats why i dont use dishwashers at home.. )... other than that... great place to hang out with RICH friends...
jenny t.,San Diego  CA,5,12,,4/8/2008,4.0,It took me a while to like this place...and I would have to say the food gets better over the years. Out of all the places that serves pizza...I would say BJ's has the best pizza around.... YUM!
David R.,Tustin  CA,2,60,,5/10/2009,3.0,"Decent food  reasonable prices  but always crowded at dinner time. Pizzas here are not something I would order here considering its ""sauceless"". For me I need some tomato sauce on my pizza to consider it a ""pizza"". Baked stuffed potatos are not bad. Burgers  sandwiches  and pastas are comparable to any other establishment that is like this. Lots of tvs all over the restaurant which is a plus. They do take reservations for big parties on the outside patio too. If you want pretty good bar type food this is a place to definitely check out. Hefz and amber beer is pretty good here too."
tamara w.,Irvine  CA,169,174,1,10/6/2007,4.0,Oddly enough  I've already been to this location the same amount of times I had been to the one in Cupertino. Which is only twice. But still. Came here once for dinner and once for happy hour. The dinner time we shared a BJ's Favorite Pizza and a salad I can't find on their online menu which is okay because it wasn't super great. The pizza was really good because I was hungry  it was quick  hot  and had a deep crust which is my favorite part.  The time we came for happy hour  we got there a little too early. So we ended up ordering the appetizer sampler first and two mini pizzas and two pizookies once happy hour started. The appetizer sampler was perfect for the four of us. By the time we got the pizzas  I was only able to eat one slice - of the same pizza I had gotten for dinner. It wasn't as hot but still good. The pizookies are ridiculous. One person in our group loves whipped cream so they were stacked with it. Oh so good but oh so bad for you.  I so want another one now. Service has been good both times.
Michael K.,Great Neck  NY,2,95,,9/16/2007,3.0,Went here for dinner while my fourteen year old bro was playing basketball in the maccabee games. We were brought by the family that he was staying wth. The salad was bland but most salads at places like this are. My brother's friend got some chicken appetizer that he couldn't get enough of. The shrimp scampi was a huge portion but pretty good for a place like this. Th deep dish pizza that my brother had was not good at all but I'm more of a thin crust man myself and I should have had it in chicago first. The dessert was the best part as it was this huge cookie (about the size of a large pizza) with ice cream on top. One of the best desserts that I've ever had. The cookies you could choose from are oreo  chocolate chip  macadamia nut and peanut butter and oatmeal raisin. Alright place for a night out  but not an amazing meal.
Jack D.,Huntington Beach  CA,0,2,,7/6/2008,1.0,Save yourself the time and hassle and go to Oggi's in Tustin. Much better beer and their pizza blows BJs away. Never heard of pizza without sauce - my money goes to OGGI'S in Tustin!
Jason Y.,Irvine  CA,35,52,19,1/21/2007,4.0,the waits are usually pretty long for a table  but I like the food. you have pizza  salads  pasta  and a wide selection of food to choose from. pizookie for dessert is a must with the warm chocolate chip cookie and vanilla ice cream.
