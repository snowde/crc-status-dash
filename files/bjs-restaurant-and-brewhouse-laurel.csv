Rashonda J.,Laurel  MD,32,45,101,8/25/2017,4.0,I have been to this location more than once. I have always had great service and good  tasty food. I recently started transitioning to becoming vegan. For my most recent visit  it was easy to choose vegetarian options from the menu. I chose their Italiano Vegetable Penne. It was delicious! I would definitely order this entree again. I'm sure the salads are great  but I'm glad I chose this over a salad. For dessert  my friends and I decided on the Pizookie Trio - mini churro and white macadamia nut pizookies. So good!!
Sonday K.,Brandywine  MD,26,40,78,10/17/2017,2.0,I don't know where to go with the star rating. Went this past Friday. Long wait. Service was okay. Our wings came out looking pale. We got half dry rub  half hot. We all bit in to give it a shot...cold! Almost frozen in the center. Gross! We told the server and she just gave a look and asked if we wanted new ones. No apologies. We got our main dishes before the wings were replaced. The manager did come with new wings and an apology and took them off the bill. The wings looked COMPLETELY different... Actually like the picture on the menu but much less meaty. So how did the first batch make it out looking so pale? They were fully cooked this time but the meat is gross like they were cooked from frozen and contain a lot of fluid that was cooked out when actually cooked. Look  I'm all for bar food. I will eat bar food with my beers (the beer was good though! Only reason for one of the stars) but come on. This stuff is gross.It seems so promising. There are so many things to choose from on the menu. The roast beef was full of gristle. My kid refused to eat it. The flatbread pizza was okay. Hubby had the Jumbalaya  just okay. The bill was high. Completely NOT worth it. I eat out often and don't concern myself with the price. If it tastes good  I pay. This was a total waste of money. I would only go back to have beer or sit at the bar before or after a movie. That's all I recommend you go there for!!
Jessica B.,Upper Marlboro  MD,142,323,1306,8/6/2017,3.0,So  I tried to come here two times before this third time (first time it was close and the second time the wait was too long). Is third time the charm--hmm...It was a busy Friday night when we came in and while we were seated right away  I can tell that the server was swamped--because he would take a really long time to check on us and take our drink and food orders. I will say that he was polite. We decided to do the beer flight and get dinner. For my entre  I got the Cherry Chipotle Salmon and my dining companion got the Fire-Roasted Barbacoa Chicken. He enjoyed his meal--He noted that the chicken breast was tender but didn't care for the feta cheese. As for my meal  it was okay but nothing to write home about. I was hoping that the salmon would have had more of a kick since it has chipotle but it was pretty mild--more sweet than anything else. Overall  it's not a bad spot but I guess you shouldn't expect fine dining or anything. This might be a better spot for HH--drinks and bar food.
Jackie A.,Laurel  MD,26,284,,8/24/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,All pizookie's $3 tonight. I'm starting off with this dessert  this time around - because this dessert is off the wall good. If I wasn't trying to lose some extra pounds  I'd be eating BJ's pizookie's left  right and sideways! A too big for one  though not wanting to share - caramel blondie brownie-like dessert  topped with large melty mounds of vanilla ice-cream and a fat drizzle of caramel.Started off with a feta watermelon salad  better than I thought it was going to be. The sweet small chunks of watermelon and crumbles of feta  worked well with the sweet/zingy  minty dressing. My prime rib sandwich was greasy goodness  though the accompanied horseradish dip  needed a bit more bite. After my previous visit  I was hesitant to return and now I'm truly disappointed in myself  that I waited so long.
L B.,Washington  DC,0,7,133,11/3/2017,3.0,Had the Chipotle salmon which was very good. Sat at the bar but the bar female bartender was not quite nice and took 10 minutes to take my order because she rather talk when I said I wasn't ready. Service from her could have been much better but I still lefy a nice tip.
Dexter S.,Norfolk  VA,3,9,,11/23/2017,2.0,I used to go to the one back home which was pretty solid. I decided to give this one a shot here in laurel and it'll more than likely be my only visit. The beer flight was still pretty good  I actually like their beer. The tavern pizza ( I think that's the name)was overpriced and not crispy enough. The server was absolutely trash  the bar area was somewhat busy he spent no time on us. I was forced to flag him down to even serve us which took a while. It seem he'd rather please his other customers first  maybe thought we weren't worthy enough or something. Gave it a shot but I wouldn't recommend it  especially with all of those other restaurants nearby.
Catrina P.,Annapolis  MD,6,51,56,12/5/2017,5.0,This is my go-to spot to hang with the girls. Nothing ever really wowed me. I always got what I expected and the food is consistently good. But  I never really deviated from my normal burger and beer. I promise  that is changing  from now on. This review is for the beer dinner that was held on Dec. 4th. It waa a 5-course dinner  paired with beers and palate cleansers. $40 prepaid online and $45 at the door. We started with the spinach stuffed mushrooms...OMG. Those things were great! Then we had some chili and a brussel sprout salad. They were good but didn't wow me. The prime rib...*angels singing* well seasoned  just the right amount of fat and cooked to tender  buttery  melt-in-your-mouth perfection!! The desert was some snickerdoodle baked thingy that was insanely delicious. We even got to keep our glasses. The experience was worth every single penny. They do beer dinners 4x a year. We decided we will be at Every. Single. One. The service was excellent and the manager leading the dinner was charismatic and engaging. Please  even if you're a regular  do a beer dinner. It completely changed my perspective about this place.
Ugochi M.,Lanham  MD,195,111,169,7/15/2017,3.0,We came in on a Friday night after happy hour. The host quoted a 25min wait and we were seated within that time frame. Even though I knew otherwise  the host kept insisting happy hour would start again at 10 . It was around 9 so we decided to wait it out a bit and ate. At 10:15 we asked our server if it was HH and she said no  as I knew. I wanted to slap the host  lol. Anyway on to food...My sis-in-law and I ordered the jambalaya dish  while my other sis was set on having a pizookie for dinner Lol. She also later ordered the couscous Mac n cheese. I don't know WTH happened but my rice was soooo damn hard. It's like the chef literally took a scoop of uncooked rice and added to my dish. I was sooo hungry and didn't want the hassle so I kept eating it  hoping it was just a bad scoop. But NOPE! The whole dish was hard and uncooked. I mentioned it to my server who brought me out cooked rice w/o the jambalaya sauce tho  wth. I didn't make a fuss or big deal at all. The manager ended up removing the dish from my bill. Thank God Bc that was horrible. Strangely  my SIL w the same dish had perfect jambalaya. Her meal was well cooked and even tasted different from mine  so weird. Still hungry  I ordered the mini Salted caramel pizookie for dessert  so good. I got the chicken alfredo pasta to go for my husband and that was also good. According to my SIL  the couscous Mac n Cheese was pretty basic. Our server was nice and attentive. I'd possibly come back here to try HH and definitely if I just wanted a pizookie for dessert. But idk if I'll be back for dinner.
Demond S.,Silver Spring  MD,105,179,357,9/30/2017,2.0,Recently bought lunch here. I ordered lunch to go. Service was good at the bar while I waited. One of the items I ordered was the Ahi Tuna Asian Salad. I have ordered this particular salad a few times from another location 15 miles or so away. The presentation on top was nice. You could clearly see the romaine lettuce and ahi tuna with the dressing and wasabi garnish on the side. Upon arriving at my destination for lunch  as I started to dig into the salad  I found what appeared to be wilted lettuce  the white heart of lettuce (explained to me later)  pickle-ish looking cucumbers (apparently were bad). This was underneath the fabulous presentation of the salad you could see. So of course I took it back and spoke to the manager. I am just surprised by the quality of food that came from what I understand to be a well established restaurant (chain).
Jill S.,Hyattsville  MD,84,292,655,9/29/2017,2.0,It's great that they are opening more options for dining in Laurel  and the food here is good  but I can't handle how slow it is. The service and the kitchen are incredibly slow. Even during lunch  when the place is packed with people trying to get back to work after lunch  it's super slow... The plus side is that they have a lot of options (besides pizza)  from healthier salads and light sandwiches  to entrees  to gluten free options for almost everything including pizza  to desserts. They specialize in beer  but also have ciders  cocktails  and wine. The place is huge and can definitely accommodate large groups  as long as you don't care when you get your drink or food!
Angel B.,Waldorf  MD,385,118,259,7/10/2017,5.0,I love this place. Nice decor  decent atmosphere  all the food I've eaten has been delicious  lots of options  and the service is typically pretty good once you get beyond the host stand.The burgers awesome. the pizza awesome. they changed the fries. they are still good but the old ones are better.The creme soda is a complete winner. I've only had one of their ipa's. It was good  just not spectacular. Great place to hang out with friends and have a informal date. Its nice an open and there are tvs that you can see from most  if not all  seats.You're at the mercy of shopping center parking but worth the walk if you end up a lil ways away.
Justin P.,Silver Spring  MD,82,242,394,3/17/2017,3.0,Came here on a Wednesday and they have this burger deal with unlimited fries all day. So I definitely enjoyed that. Food was great! Beers were a tad bit on the expensive side but they have so much beer (and other drinks) to choose from.Definitely come here if they have a happy hour special or if you want to try different beers.
Christina O.,Baltimore  MD,208,144,1289,12/30/2016,4.0,What more can you asked for ^_^I came here for lunch on a Monday after my birthday with a friend. I saw online they had half off deep dish pizzas . So you know I had to jump on it!!! The inside was pretty empty I guess because it was the holiday seasons. The atmosphere is pretty nice and modern. We sat at the bar and our server was very attentive and nice. He suggested some of their popular items from the menu. I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and my friend ordered the jambalaya and he said it was good. I had a taste of his jambalaya and he was pretty good but a little bit more spicy for my taste. The buffalo chicken was to die for! I will definitely ordered this again. Just FYI if you're wearing heels be careful the floor doesn't have any grips so walk cautiously.
Rotem K.,Washington  DC,677,90,35,5/17/2017,3.0,Went there with friends to watch the Wizards game.The TV screens are relatively small(for such a big space) so it wasn't a great choice.The pros - 1) many beer options2) diverse menu3) good saladsThe cons - 1) The service was SO bad. everything took forever. our waitress was so slow... The other waiters looked like they work in a good phase  actually. It was just our waitress who was walking there like she's on the beach.2) pizza - really dry  not recommended.I guess I need to give this place another try before eliminating completely.
Tisha S.,Capitol Heights  MD,521,341,214,3/24/2017,4.0,We came on a whim looking for quick bites before the movie. We was able to get seating quick at the bar. Never been here before either. Bartender was very attentive  and even changed a game to the middle tv to make it easier for some guys next to us to watch. We ordered the sampler and it was great. They even have mules from around the world...We going back tonight
Soaad A.,Laurel  MD,36,10,,10/7/2017,3.0,The pizza and pizookie are really good. I normally dont have issues with service  but I did one Friday night. Service was slow. The waiter took awhile to ask us for something to drink and then 20 minutes for our order. We saw people who came after us that got their food before us  but they had a different waiter.
Kim S.,Temple Hills  MD,144,315,599,10/25/2016,4.0,Monday night. 845PM.Nice crowd.Waitress was kinda out of it. She barely raised her head to speak to us. She managed to ask us if we wanted a table for 2 then she gathered the menus and walked off.Being the jerk that I am  I didn't follow her. I wanted her to TELL us to FOLLOW her! lolShe realized that we weren't behind her and she waved us over to the table.We ended up asking to be seated somewhere else. She mumbled. I thought she was hilarious - my man  not so much.Food was delicious.The ribs were fall off the bone good. I could've used more BBQ sauce. I asked for some onion strings that I saw piled on a salad and the chef obliged #happinessServer was great.Price was right.I'll be back again and again.
Kelcie J.,Annapolis  MD,19,16,5,9/18/2017,5.0,Definitely one of my favorite restaurants. The place is huge and beautiful inside. It is always clean including the restrooms and every employee we have ever had is always very friendly. After 10+ visits  we have not had any issues with our food no matter how busy they seem to be. They have several gluten free sensitive options including a bun to enjoy their yummy burgers or sandwiches  gluten free pizza  gluten free warm Pizookie desserts and other GF entrees. They are doing a great job here and pricing is very reasonable.
Katrina L.,College Park  MD,555,197,632,8/4/2016,4.0,"Sometimes  I think people have Maestro\'s Steakhouse expectations at places that have much lower price points. Get real  and know it is what it is. BJ\'s is not going to deliver world-class gourmet food  but it will deliver tasty cheap American fare and good drinks. If you\'re coming here expecting anything other than a step above TGI Fridays  you and your wallet should head North on 295 in search of something a little more ""high-class"".Because I know who and what BJ\'s is  I feel comfortable delivering a 4-star review. I\'ve never personally had bad service here  and I\'ve always left satisfied with what I ordered: be it a burger  a ribeye  tacos  wings or pizza - it\'s all good in the hood of Laurel for me.It\'s a great place to enjoy company - whether it be on a date or out with friends  and eat a good meal that won\'t hurt your wallet."
Travis S.,Washington  DC,2189,154,96,1/15/2017,3.0,I decided to try BJs again since I came here before with one of my colleagues. Upon arrival it was crowded so I was able to secure seating fast. I'm not a rocket scientist but I couldn't understand why I was seated 10-15mins went by I didn't even get a drink order in. After getting up to mentally yell at the hostess  she finally sent someone to help. The server/hostess because that's who she was didn't have no social skills the thought just because she was young and smiled that we were suppose to roll over and ignore her tardiness and non management skills. I finally ordered the root beer glaze wings and avocado egg rolls for an appetizer. I ended up getting the brisket burger as well. Please help me figure out why all came at the same time 35mins later to be exact. We finally got a waitress she was awesome and kinda allowed my son to butter her up lol. Perhaps I came on the wrong day  in the end my brisket burger was fire. I would have given more stars if the service didn't start off so terrible.
Aisha P.,College Park  MD,60,101,136,2/19/2017,3.0,"I came here on a Saturday afternoon after a friend of mine chose this place to meet up. Our original place was vetoed because she was bringing her baby and the other place was too small and did not want to deal with the hassle. So  we came here and it was packed! The only table available at the time we arrived was a table right by a baby shower  which at the time  we thought we didn\'t mind. But  it may have been a bit much. I say all of this to say  that this may have impacted our inconsistent service. Our server seemed new  or maybe he was overwhelmed. But  our service was patchy and slow. At times  he would come back quickly and other times  it would take him long periods of time before we even saw him and that was usually the times we needed something the most. My friend ordered the appetizer sampler and I ordered some calamari and wings. The calamari was average in taste  but chewy; and the wings were pretty good. I will likely get those if I ever come again. I also ordered a pear cider and they brought me something totally different. When I realized it  they switched it out. It was weird that they made a big deal to come back and tell me they were taking the other drink off my bill. Uh  of course you are. You brought me the wrong drink and I only took 2 sips of it. Yes  that should be a given  not a perk. Also  my silverware was dirty  but the server took so long to come back after our food arrived  that I never got a chance to swap it out. Luckily  I didn\'t really need a fork. But  yeah  our server disappeared after we received our food and we had to flag him down to get a check and he took about 20+ minutes to come back to process our check. He did have some help as it seems the manager was walking around helping; the manager was actually the person who changed my drink and took my order. So  in sum  it was an average experience. I like to think that service would have been better had it not been so packed and we weren\'t sitting next to a baby shower. However  I would have liked some more ""check in"" from staff. The food is average American restaurant fare  nothing spectacular. But  it is a nice  affordable spot to just stop in for an average meal."
Alfredo M.,Joint Base Lewis-McChord  WA,1,3,1,6/21/2017,2.0,I've been to BJs all over the country and this time they messed up my order pretty bad and took a little longer than I could tolerate. I ordered curbside and showed up promptly on the time I gave online. Now I understand that it takes a while to make the food and package it so I gave them the benefit of the doubt despite having an increasingly fussy baby in the back crying his head off. I let that part go and even gave them a tip. Now I messed up because I didn't look in the bag to check my order. My son was crying like crazy and I had a 20 min drive back home to start. Come to find out I arrive home and my sides for both my meals were missing. I am disappointed that someone didn't check the receipt before the order came out. I got home and do not have the energy to go back and explain the mistake. I'm very patient and will probably still go back in the future but I hope the staff reads this and at least brings it up to the take out crew. Food that I did get was good though.Update: burger I ordered had a old piece of avocado on it as well and the pizookie was also not good. Called them up to inform them of the missing sides  the burger  and the long wait time. The person on the phone was nice enough and offered a courtesy card for a free burger  but honestly I just hope they focus more on the curbside or scrap it altogether because I don't think this would've happened if I was standing there in front of them waiting for my order. Gotta say that the server that came out to my car was extremely nice and offered another free pizookie I declined because of the crying baby in my backseat. I just wanted to get home.
William G.,Fort Meade  MD,0,2,1,10/21/2017,2.0,"BJs is a nice little spot. The atmosphere and over all vibe was nice. If you like sauce on your pizza  don\'t waste your time ordering any pizzas from BJ\'s. My wife and I ordered BJs favorite ""pizza""  and it was pretty much sauceless. As soon as I picked up my slice of pizza  my toppings were falling off."
Chantel M.,Allentown  PA,79,39,17,7/9/2017,2.0,Nice ambiance  but here is the problem with that it's too DARK!!!!!  I was able to see my menu because I was directly under the dim  dim lighting  the blinds were closed so no sunlight was coming thru to help see better  as I'm looking across my table I see my family as well as others at the next table using their cell phone flashlight to see the menu!!!!!  Next my waiter was all over the place  he would ask us a question and turn his head to pay attention to something else and had to ask us to repeat what we said. Not to mention this place is way over priced. I gave this place 3 stars because the food was not horrible  but wasn't great. I honestly said twice after looking at the menu could we go to the Outback Steakhouse which was right across from B.J.'s I could have gotten a better  cheaper meal and not strain to see my menu
Khoi N.,Silver Spring  MD,229,250,609,1/27/2017,4.0,A lot of my friends have been coming here for years for happy hour so I thought I'd give it a try. Food and service here is great especially in Laurel where it's rare to find. They have HH specials in the afternoon and late in the evenings. Typical American food here with craft beers and they have personal dish pizzas! I ordered the $18 whole rack of ribs special on Thursdays. It came with 2 sides 1 salad and dessert. It was a lot of food for $18. My friends ordered the fish n chips and baked ziti. Everything was delicious  seasoned well and the food came out quickly. This might be my new bar food spot in the area. Place was really busy when we came in the evening. Restaurant is great for large parties and families. Highly recommend this restaurant if your looking for some good beers  bar food and a place to catch any game
Christopher D.,Frederick  MD,2,24,1,8/1/2017,4.0,First time here the other night. Definitely a sizable layout/floor plan and nice bar area inside. Sat out on the patio which could have been a bigger space but the accommodations were nice and pretty comfortable. Service was quick and attentive  unfortunately I didn't remember to get the waiter's name. Good selection of food and drinks  menu almost seemed too thick to get through at firsts. Ended up keeping things simple with an app of avocado rolls which were really tasty. I had the Ahi salad which I really enjoyed and my friend had the spaghetti and meatballs which looked good. Both were very generous portion sizes. I definitely look forward to going back and trying some of the other items on the menu here soon. I tried the beer sampler where you can pick 4 of their in house brews. I thought it was a little pricey for the smaller glasses (think DuCLaw) but otherwise I found a couple of like and ended up ordering a couple of extra beers. All in all I enjoyed the atmosphere  drinks  and food. I do plan to go back in the future and check things out some more. Nice change from the usual franchise spots.
Daniel B.,Laurel  MD,2,175,270,6/4/2017,3.0,I've been here two times and both times were ok but not great. During my last visit I ordered the great white pizza and my guest ordered a build your own pizza with pepperoni. I enjoyed my pizza but unfortunately my guest wasn't thrilled with their pizza because they put sasauge on the pizza and not just a few small pieces but it was overflowing with huge pieces of sausage. My guest was too bashful to request the pizza to be remade even though she dislikes sausage. The service was not great but not terrible either. The server did come by one time to ask if we needed anything and did refill my drink one time. The pizzas are way overpriced. Our small pizzas were $14 each but smaller than a $5 Pizza Hut personal pan.
Elise R.,Mount Airy  MD,0,4,,10/8/2017,2.0,"We arrived pretty hungry. We\'ve never been to a BJs before so were unaware of the giant tap list so my husband asked the man that seated us about the tap list. He looked at us like he\'s never heard ""tap list"" before and said I think its in the menu. My husband ordered a flight. The oktoberfest beer was skunked. He told a runner and our waitress. Both offered no solutions. My husband wanted the prime rib special but it was out so we both got a wonderful bison burger. We wanted to order the trio if pizookies but they didnt seem to offer the flavors we wanted in the trio. I asked the waitress which versions we could have in the trio and it was confusing. We finally settled on the peanut butter  monkey bread  and chocolate chunk. The only one of these flavors we were actually excited about was the monkey bread which was quite good  but the other two were raw in the middle."
Love R.,Greenbelt  MD,0,20,3,8/20/2017,5.0,The avocado rolls are just wonderful! The pizookie is just amazing and the cucumber mint sparkling water is just refreshing!! My favorite dish used to be the baked ziti!! Omg!! Sooooo good Before I went vegan:-) I love that you can get on a waitlist  earn points and rewards  pay for your food all on their app! BJs
Tivona R.,Laurel  MD,8,25,7,9/16/2016,1.0,So I ordered a entre sized blackened shrimp Ceasar salad.................WTF is this. 1. Entre size where?2. Blackened shrimp?3. This was $16.43?????????Ok....
A C.,Odenton  MD,0,1,,11/12/2017,5.0,Came here for Veteran' Day. Everything ordered at my table was delicious and service was fantastic! The prices are comparable with chain restaurants  but based on the taste and quality  you know there is a legit chef(s) in the kitchen.
Louis D.,Woodstock  MD,9,11,,3/11/2017,1.0,Not happy with the service. The waitress is good but the length of time for food is way too long. We were seated at our table for 1.5 hrs before the food came out. We had a party of 10 but that's way too long for meals. Oh and the table behind us with a party of 10 was seated after we were yet they received their food well ahead of ours.I've been to BJs before on a couple of occasions and have always had a good experience until now.
Seneca U.,Mount Rainier  MD,5,7,62,7/2/2017,4.0,This Sunday's lunch  I was impressed with the quality of beer and the food they have  it is super excellent  one of the things I really like is the service and friendly atmosphere we experienced at this place. I highly recommend everyone to visit BJ's R&B. More over; I would like to thank the Bartender for her professionalism and dedication to perfection. She indeed made my day  taking care of us at the bar and making the experience very comfortable  encouraging us to comeback without a doubt. By the way  her name is Carolina and I am sure she will be the best Bartender for you on weekends.
J F.,Laurel  MD,4,42,6,7/31/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"So the manager sent me a message ""reaching out"" about the bad service my mom and I got  but then never responded to any of my emails. So no  I shall NOT be back."
Penni L.,Rockville  MD,32,108,56,2/26/2017,4.0,Today  I met with a group of Vets for lunch. We selected this establishment because it has a vast selection to choose from. Everything on the menu looked appetizing  which made it difficult to choose one entree.Each of us ordered something different and each of us really enjoyed the food; so much that we plan to return soon.The food  prices  food selections and staff are wonderful. I can't wait to return. See you in a few weeks.
Carley M.,Silver Spring  MD,17,156,203,3/19/2017,4.0,Carolina was a great bartender. She had a few hard customers but was still attentive. My food was great and when i couldnt decide on a drink her recommendation was perfect. White peach margaritas go hard! Mmmm. The pizookie wws good too. Gluten free options  but i wish the spinach dip was gf too...there are no apps for people like us. Hopefully that changes. Otherwise good.
Mike B.,Hanover  MD,2,20,7,1/6/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,"Ordered the fish tacos  they came out within a reasonable time except they were missing the fish. When i pointed out this small detail to the server she immediately took my plate to the kitchen to correct the problem. When she returned  the kitchen had placed the smallest possible fish they could find in the middle of the taco. Lesson  do not order the ""fish"" tacos."
Ivan G.,Upper Marlboro  MD,154,34,70,2/26/2017,4.0,My fianc and I had a meeting with the wedding party at this restaurant last night. I highly recommend making a reservation because they were packed. Noise level was above moderate but I'm sure that was due the large groups.Tasha was our server and was amazing to say the least. She was on point with everything.What kept me from giving this place 5 stars was the super sized menu! There were too many choices. The beer menu was great but the food menu was ridiculous. I get wanting to cover every option so everyone can dine there but come on. From pizza to seafood to burgers and wings then ribs and salads  whoa! I ordered ribs by the way and they were tasty my fiance had the shrimp tacos and she enjoyed them but had they been a focus on the menu I feel it would have been better. Just my opinion.
Brooke T.,Baltimore  MD,513,544,424,6/21/2016,2.0,Slightly underwhelmed. In the 'new' Laurel Plaza. Heard its good for a drink or whatever. Fair parking  wait was pretty awful. Not sure what was going on. Had a toddler with us  despite telling the hostess on at least three occasions  they did not provide us with appropriate seating. We ended up sitting in the bar area without a high chair. Odd. The flights are cool  and decently priced. The food was alright. Brussel sprouts were grilled nice  the salad that I had  the Sante Fe was pretty large  decent. Food is just okay  service slightly less than that. We were seated in a high traffic area  but felt that we were forgotten about. Download the app for deals. Can't say I'd purposely return  maybe I'd try happy hour.
Elain X.,Baltimore  MD,264,141,47,12/21/2016,3.0,Have you ever walked into an establishment and no one spoke to you and no one was around to greet you so you stand there awkwardly waiting.... that was my first impression of this location. I've been to the one in Tysons Corner and I do like that one.When we were finally greeted by the hostess  who was so rude  it was almost as if we came in to bother her. We told her we had made a reservation for 6:45 PM and so she looks around then looks on pieces of receipt paper and told us there was no reservation under our name. We called in earlier so we could avoid the wait but there was nothing for us. She went to the back and came out to tell us someone else had spoke to us about the reservation but didn't write it down. She was very short with us and told us there was a wait so we asked to speak with the manager. The manager came out and I explained the situation to him and he said they didn't take reservation and only call a heads and we had to wait anyway. Well  maybe you should train your staff to tell people that instead of writing names on pieces of receipt paper laying around or not even writing it down. While we waited the hostess had a confrontation with a man behind us with a similar situation. Not an organized establishment at all!We were seated about 10 minutes later and my fork had crusted on stuff on them  TWICE. Our waitress was really nice though and she came back to refill waters and checked up on us. The food was decent. I got the Ahi Tuna Salad and for dessert I got the Chocolate chunk pizookie  which was really good. I would hesitate about coming back here. Definitely not my first choice at all.
Jeff T.,Silver Spring  MD,1351,52,90,7/3/2017,5.0,This place has some amazingly good BBQ ribs. You do not want to pass these ribs up. The unlimited soup and salad lunch deal is a steal
Heather M.,Honolulu  HI,413,167,258,12/16/2015,3.0,Went for a going away thing and we have a lot of people. It was pretty crazy whenever food/drinks came out because the runners didn't know who ordered it so would just be going up and down the line yelling whatever it was. Then everyone would be yelling it down the line haha. Would of been better to assign seat numbers for everyone that worked that table. I was impressed when the server did our checks though. She kept the checks separate for everyone which was nice. The place lacks many vegetarian/vegan options. I opted for the baby kale and brussels sprout salad. It came with blueberries  grapes  seeds  goat cheese in a raspberry vinaigrette. It was pretty good but was kinda skimpy on some of the things and I was still hungry after. Fianc got the brisket burger and he said he enjoyed it. At a previous visit  I did get the portobello mushroom burger and that was really good. If you take off the cheese  it could be vegan. Make sure to specify that you want the all vegetarian burger because the original has some meat in it still.
Talisha R.,Upper Marlboro  MD,51,105,95,6/26/2016,5.0,Came here for dinner with my family and it's was a great choice. Every dish that came to the table  I tried a little of each. The ribs was moist and tender and comea with two sides. Both my niece and nephew order them with shoe string fries and they enjoyed every bit of them. My husband order the deep dish pizza and he almost finished a medium by himself. I had the cobb salad that was packed with a good heaping size of all the veggies. We also ordered calamari and mozzarella stick for our appetizer. The drinks were specialty with homemade iced teas and lemonade. The service was pretty fast and pleasant.Great solid restaurant that I look forward to visiting again.
Brian M.,Seattle  WA,0,13,,10/12/2017,4.0,BJs is one of my go-to dining choices when I travel for business. I ate twice at the bar at this one this week. Bar tender was friendly and attentive. I love their pulled pork sandwich and ribs. They also have a great soup snd salad deal for lunch. Always a good place to eat.
Ashley N.,Alexandria  VA,0,14,2,6/18/2017,3.0,The food is blah. It's okay  but not great. The waitlist app is a good option. You get a free pizookie if you sign up for the online points program but I'll warn you it's not the full size version at all. I'm not even being ungrateful I just think that's totally tacky if you ask me. What I do give an extra star for is the healthy option. (I know I just complained about a cookie. That was for my husband) The root beer wings are amazing.Peruvian quinoa bowl was decent but I could make it at home easy. Nothing special.The Salmon was dry. I've had that Brussel sprouts super salad before and it was soooooo tasteless.
Marcus M.,Washington D.C.  DC,108,15,28,2/10/2017,4.0,Nice casual dining experience. Portions are decent. Our server  Tasha  was attentive and offered recommendations since we were first-timers. We'll return!
Camille M.,Springfield  VA,59,16,12,8/10/2017,5.0,First time coming here. Came when they first opened at 11am. My friend ordered Chips & Spinach Artichoke Dip  soooo yummy and the chips were freshly made. I ordered a House Margarita which tasted just like a lemonade with a punch! I ended up getting two of them. I could not decide on what I wanted to order so I ended up combining two different grilled cheese's that they offer...I basically got the Buffalo Chicken Grilled Cheese add Bacon (make it like the Chicken Club Grilled Cheese) with pickles added and ranch instead of blue cheese. IT WAS SO GOOD! I was full off half of the sandwich but could not stop and ate the entire thing. The French fries are THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!! Would definetly come here again.
Julius L.,Southern Maryland  MD,18,52,111,1/28/2017,5.0,My crew and I stopped in for lunch. Pleasant atmosphere  bartender was very cool. Had the shrimp tacos and a side of steamed spinach. Food was good  i would go back.
L V.,Columbia  MD,1,30,2,11/9/2016,1.0,Been here a few times and quality has gotten worse and worse. Tonight we ordered a steak... We got a hockey puck and an ice cream scoop of potatoes. When we brought it to the attention of our waiter and the manager (who stopped to ask how things were)  neither offered anything to remedy the situation. So now we have bad food and bad service. Save your money... Go somewhere else.
Kelly K.,Northwest Washington  Washington  DC,1,11,24,8/6/2017,2.0,I've been to this BJs several times over the last year. When we first started going  the food and drinks were really good. The food and the service made you want to come back for more. We even took our kids a few times. Now fast forward to today. The service is ok but I would rather have a server that didn't wipe their nose so much! Every time I looked at our server  he was wiping his nose across his arm. That is nasty and unsanitary! The food was ok but could have been better.
Valencia S.,Bowie  MD,39,21,54,1/28/2017,4.0,I have to admit service started off rocky but Ariana saved the day. She was absolutely wonderful. I ordered the fish and chips which was recommended hubby ordered buffalo grilled cheese sandwich with the root beer wings. Everything was so tasty. Ariana stay sweet
Karl D.,Silver Spring  MD,158,90,114,1/11/2016,2.0,"I came here with my family of 4 for lunch on a Saturday. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated  which was fine. We decided to come here because of their promotion of buy one entre  get one entre free during lunch from 11 am to 3 pm. We asked our waitress right away if there was a way to use the deal for all of us. She said  ""We could have 2 separate checks so we could get 2 entres free."" We were glad that we could do this. However  later when we got our bill  our waitress told us that we can only use the deal once per table even though she said we could make 2 separate checks so we can use the deal twice. We felt that we were misled. I would rather have them tell us that we cannot use the deal twice than telling us that we can and then when we already had finished eating tell us that we can\'t. Now on to the food part! I got the buffalo bison burger  which was okay but the edges were too charred giving a very bitter aftertaste. The salad that came with it was not good  they should change the dressing that they use. I also got the chance of tasting the lemon thyme chicken and the toasted chicken pesto sandwich. They would have been good if they were not too salty. However  get the appetizer called the Best Beginnings Appetizer Combo. It comes with yummy avocado egg rolls  chips with spinach and artichoke dip  mozzarella sticks  and Santa Fe spring rolls. Everyone will be happy  especially when you cannot agree on what appetizers to get! How can I forget their scrumptious pizookies  which is a warm cookie contrasted with ice cream. The greatest combo ever that will leave you very satisfied!"
Dorrie S.,Ledyard  CT,33,2,,7/19/2017,3.0,Server was slow. Food was cold and I had to send it back. After dinner we waited over half an hour for our dessert. Not sure when or if we'll be returning.
Rummy V.,Columbia  MD,315,225,951,10/23/2016,4.0,It was my first time here and we came with a party of 14  the table was reserved with no issues! I had the salmon with asparagus and mashed potatoes and it was soooooo good! I had to order a side of fries because I found myself eating my friend's fries  they were thin and crispy just like I love! The food was excellent and the service was fast and great! For a large party they were smart to provide two servers. However  it took a while for the food to come out (45minutes). There is coupon attached on Yelp and it applies providing $10 to 35+. There are tvs everywhere for your entertainment. Where we sat was near the doors and it was freezing...That was my biggest complaint  the doors are very close to seating and that cold breeze brings discomfort but besides that we all loved it and wouldn't mind coming again!
katrina h.,Crofton  MD,4,15,15,12/3/2016,3.0,Pretty cool spot. Nice selection of beer. Make sure to use the app to get the call ahead seating.
Nia A.,Washington  DC,5,3,2,5/13/2016,5.0,This is def one of my new fav spots now! The food is freshly prepared. The drinks creative & tasty. Atmosphere is nice too. I'd def return. Nice spot for different occasions as well. I tried the White Peach Margarita & Jumbo Meatballs & Spaghetti. One Word: Delish.
Sakeena J.,Rockville  MD,61,22,4,7/25/2017,1.0,"This place was meh. We had a really sweet server named Shannon. We came for ""happy hour"" before walking to the theater. Happy Hour is in quotes because they don\'t have happy hour on Friday????? Weird. I wanted Mac and cheese  but instead of Pasta they use quinoa. No thanks. The ribs were just ok. They tasted very gamey. I didn\'t like the strawberry mojito. My spinach came in a bowl with water. It was too wet. Do they boil them? Blech. Somehow my asparagus had pepper on it. Super spicy. Not good spice because I like spicy food as long as it\'s flavorful. The asparagus were very small and had a dull color  I don\'t think they were fresh. My baked potato was fine.That\'s hard to mess up. I don\'t think my meal was worth $40. Parking was easy."
Shannon W.,Takoma Park  MD,0,26,1,7/23/2017,2.0,We must have come on a bad day; no CO2 therefore no soda or beer. Ordered a Cobb salad which was so-so nothing to write home about. Also had sliders for an app which were flavorful but the meat on them was the size of my thumbnail. Wouldn't recommend with so many other options in the area.
William S.,Washington  DC,13,5,7,7/7/2017,4.0,Love the Avocado Spring Rolls and craft beers! Good atmosphere for dinner  happy hours or catching a game.
Candace G.,Laurel  MD,68,96,212,5/16/2016,3.0,Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable but the wait time for our food was entirely too long! We didn't order appetizers and our food still took over 30min to come out smh!Besides that I ordered the Mediterranean chicken tacos which came w/seasonal grains. It was very light and tasty. Definitely good for those like myself who are on diets lol.I'd say try this place out if you have absolutely nothing to do after.
Laura K.,Ellicott City  MD,24,57,3,9/16/2017,5.0,Was worried by mixed reviews  but I had a wonderful lunch here today. Server was good. I had a berry cider  chicken club flatbread which is HUGE  and we did the trio of cookie ice cream things. Tried churro  monkey bread  and the caramel cookie. I loved the cookie one  the monkey bread one tastes like a cinnamon roll with ice cream and was really good  and the churro one was ok but my least favorite out of the three. I will be back!
Courtney K.,Annapolis  MD,352,1731,2151,8/3/2015,3.0,"Bottom Line: Better than most chain restaurants with a decent beer selection. Located in the Towne Center at Laurel. I\'m really not a fan of chain restaurants but I never mind a trip to places like BJ\'s or Cheesecake Factory because I generally find that the staff is a little more refined  the food is better quality and the drink options are plentiful. Here is my take on the Laurel BJ\'s:- The menu at BJs weighs about three pounds and is as long and varied as that as the Cheesecake Factory\'s. Having said that  the nice thing about BJs is there is something on the menu for everyone. Although BJ\'s is known for their pizza  my favorite dish is the Parmesan crusted chicken with blanched brocolli and cheddar mashed potatoes. - As should be expected when you have ""Brewhouse"" in the name  BJs offers a great selection of drought craft beer and their house beer is decent as well. Their beer menu is nicely displayed on the wall in three sections: craft beer  BJ\'s house brew  and local craft beer. I\'m not one for girly-fruity drinks but on a hot summer day I actually do like their BJ\'s Berry Burst cider. It doesn\'t taste much like a cider to me but rather a carbonated fruit drink  but not too thick  sweet or heavy. - This BJs isn\'t as large as other locations I\'ve been too but that is ok with me since less people means less noise. The open air concept here and lots of hard surfaces can make for a noisy experience but during off-peak times the restaurant is quite comfortable."
Jamie W.,Silver Spring  MD,35,139,7,9/5/2017,3.0,Overpriced  crowded and my food was not memorable. I'd give it another try but there are so many other restaurants to choose from.
Sandra A.,Greenbelt  MD,69,2,,4/10/2017,1.0,Horrible food and they take forever (aprox. 50min) to bring the food to the table. I won't be back.
Vonnie J.,Oxon Hill  MD,13,89,174,5/13/2016,4.0,"I would give this place a 5  but sometimes the wait can be quite long. I have eaten at this place since they opened. The service is always great and so is the food. The place doesn\'t have enough lighting for me  but I see well enough to order. The nice thing about the menu is the have healthy and non healthy lol. I have had really good burgers with bacon and I have had really good salmon. No matter if I am watching my calories or is I just don\'t care I always have their famous ""Pizookies""  girls gotta live a little. My sons and friends love their deep dish pizza and the prices are not bad. This place is worth a try  Sat eve seems to be the most crowded time. Enjoy"
LaToya E.,Baltimore  MD,444,572,789,5/6/2015,2.0,I wanted to wait until I made a few visits before writing a review for this place  mostly because i thought maybe they were just having a bad day.. I guess I was wrong! Each time I went the same problem presented itself  the service was extremely lacking! The wait staff would barely check on us and would frequently forget things. Once I went with a large group and the waitress took everyones order except mine and walked away from the table.. she was flagged down and brought back to only realize she knew she skipped me. The first time I went my dinner guest had to get up  go find the waitress and bring her back to our table to take our orders! The only reason I have returned is because the drinks are decent! As far as the food its been a real hit or miss.. The deep dish pizzas are good and ive had a few appetizers that ive enjoyed (the sliders are my favorite) but sometimes ive been disappointed with the food. The worst offender was the California Chicken club that came out so burned others at the table could smell it!
Carolina G.,Bethesda  MD,26,5,1,4/11/2017,5.0,My husband and I have been going to this location since we moved to Maryland almost 4 years ago and out of all the times there was only one ocation where the waiter was not pleasant at all but all the times we can say we've been satisfied with our food  we recommend to go for beer and pizza but anything you get from the menu will be delicious. Staff is friendly and courteous.
Toya J.,Greenbelt  MD,1541,406,357,4/13/2015,3.0,BJ's is cool if you want a drink and a few small plates. Not necessarily the place you should come to expecting top notch food and quality dining. The food 3 stars  the customer service is more like 4 stars. When we arrived they were ready and prepared; took no time for them to come around and get our orders. The one lady waiter was holding it down  she was very attentive and courteous. We were able to enjoy happy hour prices on our drinks due to a server giving us incorrect info over the phone a week prior; Happy Hour is from 3 to 6 then it stops and picks up later that night from 10 until. The server told us 3 to 10pm  so the manager Jared was kind enough to honor what we were originally told.This is a good place to come back to watch a game  drop into quickly. They have quite a few vegetarian selections and a lite calorie menu as well. We sampled the avocado rolls (spring rolls) served hot with a soy dipping sauce. I had the chicken lemon thyme dish with mash potatoes; sounded and looked better than it tasted  by sole reason of the seasoning and sauces being average. The chicken wings weren't bad; fried hard and crispy  drizzled with buffalo sauce and ranch dressing. My HH special lemon drops were decent.Not a bad choice for a casual group after work. It was cool  I can say for our first PG UYE this was a pretty good choice-a common meeting ground with affordable drinks and food prices. I'd definately stick with happy hour.
Hope L.,Fort Washington  MD,494,284,847,4/10/2015,3.0,"Went here on a Thursday night to meet a group of friends. Upon arrival I gave the hostess our name for reservations  she looked up the reservations  told me she would be right back and that was that. She was gone for about 15 min. Finally another hostess came up and I asked her was everything ok and she said ""yes  she is getting your table ready."". I\'m thinking geesh would\'ve been nice if the 1st hostess had shared with me why she was leaving instead of giving me a weird look (like uh oh your reservation isn\'t on here)  say she\'ll be back and leave me with thoughts of ""is everything ok? what\'s going on?"". She returned about 15 minutes later and showed me to our table. It was a long table set up for about 15 people. Seating arrangement definitely could\'ve been a little better. It was a little cramped because we were right up against a wall and the path between us and the next table was very small. Our waitress came over shortly after and introduced herself. Her name is Carolina and she was a doll. Unfortunately  throughout the night you could tell that she was overwhelmed because we had to wait a good 20 min before we placed appetizer orders  she was gone for long periods of time throughout the meal. Especially at times we really needed her. Like to order more drinks  clear the dishes off the table  etc. The entire ordering  eating  process was long/delayed. I\'m assuming they were short staff but I really don\'t know. Here\'s what I ordered and what I thought about my food; Cajun Pasta - I added shrimp for a extra few dollars. The shrimp were very small and when I am paying a nice coin for a pasta dish with shrimp I expect for my shrimp to look like what I paid for. That was a little disappointing. Overall dish was a little too oily but it was good. Not sure if I would order this again but if I do I would leave the shrimp out. Santa Fe Spring Rolls - Filled with chicken  black beans  fireroasted red bell peppers  cilantro  sweet corn  jalapenos and jack cheese. Topped with pico de gallo and served with our Santa Fe dressing and avocado cream sauce. The wrapping wasn\'t crispy. Inside was mushy. Wasn\'t too pleased with this dish. Ultimate Long Island Iced Tea - Weak. Tasted more Coca-Cola than anything. Wouldn\'t order it again unless it was a different bartender or s/he learn to make a good Long Island.Apple Martini - Too sour. The first thing I tasted was sweet and sour. Ugh! Was really off balanced. I should have listened to my fellow diners who said the Lemon Drop and Cosmo were the best Martinis. The Hostesses were very in-personable when I arrived. The person in this position is the first impression you get sometimes at a restaurant and I personally think you should be interactive with your customers especially when they first walk in. That wasn\'t the case this night because the both of them were very stand-offish when I arrived and didn\'t communicate clearly on what was happening. The DINING experience was decent. Carolina did a good job. Wish they were fully staffed so that she could have tended to our table a little better. The DRINKING experience was disappointing. Bartender needs a little lesson or mixing drinks. Maybe I will return at some point but have no plans to do so anytime soon."
Tanya T.,Pasadena  CA,0,76,,7/6/2017,2.0,It seems like a theme at bj restaurants; crappy service. The one in Pasadena  CA has the same crap service . waited 10min for menus and water.very inattentive waiter.
Junaed S.,Hanover  MD,166,64,70,10/9/2016,5.0,Only ever had dessert here  but that's enough to earn this place 5 stars. Service is great  and dessert options are plenty. The custom brewed sodas are good! Try the baked desserts. Will definitely be back for a real meal!
Maureen M.,Santa Monica  CA,18,140,528,4/9/2016,5.0,Great brew house. If you like fruity beer...that does not taste like beer  try the BJ'e Berry Burst cider! You can get it by the pint or the pitcher.
Danielle C.,Laurel  MD,0,15,,6/16/2017,4.0,Ate here recently and had never been in before but was curious to see what it was like. The ambience is wonderful for a chain restaurant-especially the patio section. Ordered appetizers and wings during HH and the fried asparagus was to diiiie for. Wings were ok  and so were the mozzarella sticks. Didn't drink at all sadly so have to come back for that because they have an extensive drink menu. Overall good service and definitely worth a try!
Jubilee C.,Silver Spring  MD,1,28,,2/18/2017,2.0,This restaurant sometimes has some good dishes like the artichoke appetizer  other appetizers and some of the pizzas. It's also pretty popular. I just wish the food options were healthier. So many fried foods here with unhealthy sauces. Otherwise  it's an ok place to try at least once.
Tyron H.,Washington  DC,38,126,43,8/6/2016,4.0,I visited today for lunch and the drinks were on point. The bartender chick is definitely a master at her craft. They have tons of menu items for every appetite. I had shrimp with mahi mahi. The quality was a little above average. The ambiance is relaxing and family friendly. I recommend.
Michael B.,Hyattsville  MD,1,20,2,5/16/2017,2.0,I used to love this place until we had a catered party of 45 that we had at this location. What happened next was very disappointing. Empty buffet table. People waiting for 30 minutes until they brought out more food and servers who could care less because they put an 20% gratuity automatic gratuity. The attitude of the manager and servers were less than satisfactory.
Sheisakeeper T.,Laurel  MD,29,4,5,12/6/2016,5.0,This place is awesome!! From the rootbeer bbq ribs to the brussel sprouts with Sriracha ! Cocktails were delicious.A decent priced family style restaurant some items are a little pricey but it's worth it the pizza is phenomenal too.
Rose D.,Washington  DC,13,50,64,1/16/2016,3.0,"This is a ""go to"" whenever my dad and I are out of ideas as to where to eat in the area. We tend to go around lunch/early dinner  and even before the nightly crowd  it gets pretty crowded.You can either sit at the bar  which is very colorful (to me)  you can sit in the middle where you can hear the hustle and bustle from the televisions in the bar but still maintain somewhat of a conversation without being distracted  or you can sit on the opposite side of the bar  which is far away from the noise and you can actually listen to your fellow eating mates. This is a nice restaurant  but there\'s nothing spectacular about it. To me  it\'s just a fancier replacement for the Greene Turtle (which closed a while ago). I always order their jumbo meatballs and spaghetti. Pretty nice dish; they add hot crushed pepper in there for ya  and it comes with a nice fluffy and crunchy (good balanced) garlic bread. Service is a hit or miss. Usually the waiters are good when it comes to serving their guests  but we had one (I know  it was JUST ONE) who 1.) got my dad\'s order wrong  and 2.) charged us twice for my dad\'s meal (once for the mistake and once for the correction). It was one waiter  but still  this waiter had two strikes.Again  this is a nice restaurant in the area. Food is pretty good  the environment is fun (let me put it that way). But don\'t hesitate to check out the other restaurants that are close by!"
Sanjana S.,Arlington  VA,1,3,,8/13/2017,1.0,We used to love their food but when we went there recently the food was horrible: stale lettuce  super salty  etc. Never going there for food!
Paul S.,Columbia  MD,118,227,,9/9/2016,3.0,Decent food  huge menu of choices. Sat at the bar and service was just OK. May return if I'm in the area
Linda S.,Laurel  MD,19,6,,1/3/2017,1.0,This was our last attempt at eating here. 1st there were plenty of empty clean tables but we had to wait for a booth. 2nd the place is so poorly lit you can barely see your date let alone the menu. 3rd they don't carry Budweiser!! That alone made my husband want to leave. However  we ordered drinks and our waiter disappeared again. My husband went to the bathroom  came back still no sign of our drinks. Told the hostess to cancel our drink order  we went someplace with good lighting  fast service  Budweiser and warm bread. Next door at Outback. Going there now to give them 5 stars for rescuing our evening.
John W.,Silver Spring  MD,0,6,,5/12/2017,3.0,"The service was good  waitress friendly and attentive  the appetizer was very good. I ordered an entree salad and was just slop  I couldn\'t eat it. I was shocked when I told the waitress that I didn\'t like it and she could take it away  her response was simply ""ok"". No question about why I didn\'t eat it  no offer of another choice. Not going back."
Candle P.,Washington  DC,145,24,8,2/10/2017,5.0,Excellent customer service! Came in 20 mins before they closed and still was treated like royalty! The bartender Brittany was great on suggesting drinks along with food! Definitely will be back
Autumn A.,Odenton  MD,23,8,27,9/30/2016,4.0,Everything s good here!!!!! Foods wise. We had the salmon  baked ziti  kids mini corn dogs  fried mozzarella sticks  everything tasted great! However  I could not say the same about the service . The waiter we had was slow on everything and was not attention at all. Hope to see improvement on the service.
Nat F.,Washington  DC,11,97,58,6/21/2016,3.0,Food is not that good here unless you are probably drunk. I will  however  recommend the Jalapeno cucumber margarita on ice. It was absolutely divine.
Sylvia B.,Odenton  MD,342,344,2263,11/15/2015,4.0,I really enjoyed my dinner here at BJ's l was recommended to go here from the lady that do my nails. She lives in the Laurel md area and she recommended it. She said she came here with her family one Saturday night after work and had the pizza. She also stated that the flights were free. I knew that couldn't be possible because how could they make money giving away free beer flights but l wanted to try them out anyway. Especially since they had fruity flights. Woo-hoo l enjoyed every bit of it. I never drank a glass so fast in my life. It was delicious! Especially the berry and the Raspberry. Those were my favorites. I really enjoyed all 4 flights and the pizza was sooo good. It was thin crust and only 110 per slice. Not bad at all. It was called BJ Brewhouse Classic. Very crunchy and seasoned just right. I don't normally do thin crust but that pizza was on point. Good for 2 people but if you're sharing with a larger group you might want to get something bigger. We definitely enjoyed our visit and we didn't have to wait long for our table. The waitress was also very busy but she tried to stay on top of things. The only wait was when we was ready to pay. They started to get pretty busy.  I would definitely recommend and return.
Michael K.,College Park  MD,0,58,,1/3/2017,2.0,Dinner Monday 1/2. I guess a lot of employees phoned it in  because at 6 pm the service was nonexistent. Kitchen was running out of everything (pizza  pasta). No refills offered during dinner. Multiple tables around us walked out after waiting 30+ minutes with no service. Apparently kitchen staff and hostesses were pressed into service as wait staff. Evening manager strolling around the restaurant avoiding work couldn't have been more useless if he was dead. Food  when delivered  was cool or cold.Note to self: if you walk in and see multiple tables that haven't been bussed  service won't be up to BJ's usual standards  so turn around and leave.
Dana And Danielle C.,Carrollton  TX,45,33,77,6/10/2016,1.0,We've always been a fan of BJ's ribs because they are simply amazing! But this location definitely left something to be desired. It was a combination of either under done or over boiled. The ribs were not tender AT ALL!! The mashed potatoes were luke warm and the asparagus was drenched in butted. When it came out it looked beautiful; but this was one time where looks were deceiving. The service was great; but I wouldn't recommend the ribs at this location to anyone. Stick with pizza here!
Maxfactor C.,Laurel  MD,14,50,,1/13/2017,3.0,Loved the set up  love the craft beers... but food was bland. Perhaps I will return and try something else.
Lady T.,Charlotte  NC,44,15,50,2/13/2016,5.0,What a great dining experience! Went with my bestie for drinks and appetizers! Pleasantly surprised! The service was AWESOME... thanks Dave! The calamari was the best I have ever had! And then the dessert... Peanut Butter Smores ... HEAVEN!!!
Tiffani C.,Fort Washington  MD,41,50,8,8/13/2016,4.0,Sat down on a Friday evening with a couple of friends who already vouched for this place and they were right on. It was better than decent food and drinks at a  coupled with an attentive staff. Menu is LOOOONG and it took a while for me to select  but I settled on the Bacon  Avocado and Tomato Grilled Cheese. It was very good. The aioli was a great match for the dish. I still go there for lunch runs w/the coworkers. They enjoy their takeout dishes as well  and I've had zero complaints. Love their APP too.
David D.,Beltsville  MD,4,15,27,2/18/2017,4.0,Great beer great food great tvs. Nice place to go chill. Get a seat by the bar booths.
Danielle L.,Washington  DC,23,16,,3/22/2017,1.0,"I called early in the day to set a reservation in the evening for a party of 10 and I was told ""we do not do same day reservations"". Umm it\'s in the middle of the week in Laurel! I refuse to believe BJ\'s will be so crowded that they can\'t reserve a spot for 10 people. I wish I could give no stars because they would not work with the me (the customer). What restaurant would rather lose money because they didn\'t want to push a couple tables together?? Horrible"
Amy A.,Silver Spring  MD,0,43,18,3/10/2017,5.0,"Great atmosphere. Great food for dinner and great dessert choices- better than any other chain restaurant or ""typical"" restaurant. Today  they have sine new items on the menu that work for me as a non-meat eater (apparently I\'m not allowed to say vegetarian  my brother  the meat-eater  tells me). The selection of beer is the largest for this Laurel  MD area that I know of so far. Oh yea....there\'s many TVs turned to various sports channels for those that like sports."
Bobby H.,Laurel  MD,16,17,,3/5/2017,5.0,We've only been in Laurel a couple weeks  but the service and food was so good at BJ's Brewhouse that we've already been back for more. The staff is extremely polite  and the food is absolutely amazing. We've had the new pita bread nachos  very good  and the deep dish pizza is really good as well. My wife has had the Salmon and Cod dinners  she preferred the Salmon of the two but said both were really good as well. My daughter always gets the pizza from the kids menu  which is plenty serving size for her and she really enjoys it. Cozy laid back atmosphere with great people.
Eve H.,Laurel  MD,0,20,,5/12/2017,1.0,I was ordering take out and the cashier informed me that my card was declined. It was very weird considering I had more than enough funds to cover the 23 order. So after using another card  I received a text from my bank (the first card) stating that I needed to confirm an attempted fraudulent transaction. Whatever was going on in their system put my bank on notice  and they blocked the card until I confirmed I had tried to make the purchase. The next day the card that did go through had two fraudulent purchases. I will only go to this place if I have cash. Oh yeah the food....average nothing to sing about.
GleamoGirl J.,Rockville  MD,31,9,,2/16/2017,5.0,Darius was a great server! Made my birthday lunch experience a fun one. I enjoyed my pizookie.
Nikki Y.,Waldorf  MD,0,5,5,2/12/2017,5.0,The food was great (including the hot coffee). As an appetizer had flatbread pizza (I can't recall the name) but it had a avocado  chicken and tomato. For dinner we had a burger topped with bacon  beef brisket and BBq sauce. We took a deep dish pizza to go. Try the homemade soda and the monkey bread and ice cream for dessert. The place was full so we sat in the bar area. The service was fast and the menu offered so many choices. If you're near Laurel  MD I highly recommend them.
Mercy M.,Takoma Park  MD,18,26,18,8/2/2015,2.0,I really wanted to give this place 5 stars because the food is delicious but I really enjoy great customer service when I go out and they did not have that.I ordered the avocado rolls which were delicious. For my main course I ordered the rib eye well done. Fifteen minutes after I placed my order the manager (Mark) came over and told me they were out of rib eyes. He asked if I wanted the sirloin steak instead. After looking at the picture on the menu I agreed. My steak came out fifteen minutes after my friends food came out. When it came out  I noticed it looked nothing like the picture. It looked like a toddlers plate of food. I tried to brush it off. When cutting it open it was pink! I specifically asked for well done. I asked our waitress for Mark. He came over and apologized and asked if I wanted a new one. It would take fifteen minutes to cook. I gave up and told him I didn't want anything. He said that I should pick something else so I picked the deep dish ravioli. It was delicious. Mark took care of me and it was on the house. Our waitress was horrible. She tried to remember everyones order instead on writing it down. She messed up my order and another friends order. She then started to get attitude when Mark got involved. We had to keep reminding her about to go boxes and drinks. It was just bad. I felt bad for Mark because I'm sure he had better stuff to than to do the waitress job.Come to this place for food. If you want awesome customer service go somewhere else unless Mark is there.
Terence P.,Washington  DC,110,23,1,12/23/2016,4.0,The crafted brews are REALLY good! I tried one called.Black Velvet  which was a mixture of BJ PM Porter and BJ Berry Burst Cider. Outstanding! And their New Orleans Jumbalaya was out of the world. For desserts  I recommend one of their Pizookies. It's an oven baked cookie topped off with ice cream. Eat  drink and enjoy!
C A.,Pasadena  MD,0,13,13,8/4/2016,1.0,Wow. Ok  I had been warned by a friend about the service but decided to check it out. Ordered appetizers. First came the calamari (lukewarm) chips and queso came 20 minutes later for whatever reason. Waitress was almost nonexistent. Every drink at the table was empty for awhile before she showed back up. The food might have been better warm and if the sides showed up - I mean you can't catch a burger going out alone on a big plate with no fries or chips? If I go back I will probably sit in the bar area as it looked like they were a little more on their game in there.
Anik I.,Columbia  MD,1,10,3,12/14/2016,5.0,Fantastic food. Had a BOGO coupon that made it that much better but the food here is pretty great.
Deanna C.,Cambridge  MD,66,18,24,6/29/2016,3.0,Okay  we were greeted and seated very quickly! The restaurant was pretty empty  the hostess sat my party of 2 at a very large booth. The table had not been cleaned off  so she picks up the tray  sets down the menus without wiping the table and walks away. That was not okay  thus only 3 stars. The waitress was amazing and the food was delicious. She was very pleasant & attentive!
Lilly E.,Bryn Mawr  PA,2,95,82,8/5/2015,4.0,Husband and I had been traveling for a few hours and after settling at our hotel went in search of some food. We didn't want to eat heavy since it was 9:30pm so we were just gonna have some appetizers and drinks.We were greeted by the manager who was very welcoming. Our server  Tamara  was super sweet and I asked her to pick me a nice crisp white wine and since they were half price that made it taste even better. She chose Kendall Jackson Chardonnay and it was perfect.Husband had Hefeweizen which he gets nostalgic over since he used to live in Germany.Then we ordered the fried calamari - perfectly cooked - wasn't chewy - it was golden. The garlic aioli dipping sauce was yummy!Husband ordered a flatbread that had bacon/chicken/avocado - he was enjoying it.I had the stuffed mushrooms - it was full of flavor - spinach pesto was very good!We enjoyed our time here and there was a lot of people for that time of night during the work week. If we lived closer we'd probably come here more often.
Kee C.,Washington  DC,19,40,163,5/13/2016,3.0,Pros: Nice establishmentLots of flatscreen tv'sFully stocked barNice seatingCons:On busy nights (Fridays)  they tend to fall short in the service area. We ordered appetizers as we had a movie to catch and it took 30 min to get them. The mozzarella sticks we ordered were luke warm and required me to ask for a manager to have them either heated in a timely manner or removed from the bill altogether. The manager ensured us they would give us fresh mozzarella sticks in two minutes (and he did bring them out in a couple of minutes as promised). He didn't remove anything from the bill for the inconvenience  which was fine since we ate them once they were corrected.Overall  this place is nice for drinks and to kill time...but I wasn't a huge fan of the food.
Elle Z.,Odenton  MD,129,131,220,9/26/2015,3.0,A mediocre attempt at a brewhouse  they have only about 6 different beers that you wouldn't find everywhere else. Food has generous servings (burger  kids mac and cheese)
Daniel S.,Beltsville  MD,0,9,,1/11/2017,5.0,Best place to get a random Beer you have never had. I love the atmosphere here. Its a refined version of BWW with a stronger Bar.
Rae M.,Bowie  MD,338,368,508,4/10/2015,4.0,"What a wonderful addition to the once desolate Laurel Towne Center. Located to your immediate left as soon as you enter the new shopping center  a small parking lot is adjacent from the restaurant  but your best bet is to park across the street in the bigger parking lot. Myself and a few others planned an outing here with a group of 11 awesome people  on a Thursday evening. BJ\'s is known for their large variety of beers  I didn\'t partake  but I heard positive reviews about them. Our server  Caroline  was rather busy with such a large table of people  but she stayed on top of our table\'s needs. She did all this while being extremely pleasant and helpful. With such an extensive menu  it was really hard to decide what to get. Who am I kidding  I\'m on a pseudo diet  so I knew I couldn\'t order what I really wanted...a burger or pizza  so I ordered from the ""enLIGHTened"" menu. Every item on that particular portion of the menu is under 795 calories. I decided on the Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos with a side of bistro grains. I don\'t have a clue what the bistro grains were (even after I ate it) but the entire dish was under 700 calories and they were really tasty  so I wasn\'t complaining. My meal as a whole was actually really good. I could see myself ordering it again (clearly while on this pseudo diet though). Our table also indulged on a few appetizers  one of which I can\'t remember the name of  but it was good. The one I remember was the avocado egg rolls and they were surprisingly really good as well. All and all  a good time was had by all. The service  the food  the lively atmosphere  and of course the fabulous company were all truly wonderful! I will definitely be back in the future...clearly after this ""diet"" has died down! Beer and burgers....HERE I COME! PS I love the colorful and festive bar area. Check out the HH. Happy Hour is Mon - Fri 3pm - 6pm / Sun - Thurs10pm - Close. Come in on Tuesday\'s  Half Off Wines all day. They also have appetizer specials for HH."
Colleen D.,Kensington  MD,265,22,,12/9/2016,3.0,This place really isn't bad. I know that chains can be scary  but they actually have pretty good beer. I also ordered a flat bread pizza appetizer and it was yummy and filling enough to be an entree for me. Generally good place  good bar  and clean bathrooms.
Deana O.,Rockville  MD,0,5,,6/25/2017,1.0,Service is always slow even when there is minimal people here. Food seems to always get sent back not just our table. Menu's are sticky and never clean. Food isn't that good either. Nothing to rave about.
Meg L.,Laurel  MD,8,94,124,8/31/2015,2.0,To be so new  this place went down hill fast in my book. Came here once and loved it. Place was new  food was good  people were nice. 2nd go around --- it wasn't worth my time & money. Food didn't meet expectations. Wait was long. We were rushed in and out#3 & 4 --- gave it more chances. Both times for happy hour. Was disappointed time #3 because appetizers were too expensive to be so small. Skipped the apps and got burgers time #4... Couldn't finish the burger it was so greasy....
Terry G.,Silver Spring  MD,0,1,,1/1/2017,1.0,Usually enjoy my experience at BJ'S Laurel  but today was quite the contrary. From the cold reception upon entering to the server who seemed completely put out by having to wait our table. When the food finally came  we had to continue our wait for utensils. Meatballs in spaghetti dish were undercooked and pasta was mushy. Siracha rub was tossed on chicken and covered the entire plate as if it were an after thought. Had to ask twice for a manager before the person who finally showed never introduced himself nor did he offer a resolution. Will wait for Grand opening of Columbia restaurant before patronizing BJ's again; hoping they can redeem themselves.
Jerry S.,Beltsville  MD,170,517,673,4/1/2015,3.0,3.5 stars. It's a pretty new and pretty popular place. The first time I tried to go  there wasn't an open seat in the house. Comfy room  subdued lighting but there are downward spots so you can actually read the menu.The headliner here is  of course  the beer. I got a sampler of four house brews for $7.95. All were well made  true to type  and just a bit edgy  showing that the brewmaster was going for good and not just good enough.Feeling hungry  I went for the full rack of baby backs. The ribs were tender and moist  with a sauce/glaze that was savory and just a bit sweet. Not a hint of smoke  though. A tiny bit of chiplotle would have gone a long way. Mashed potatoes were excellent in flavor and texture. The roasted Brussels sprouts were a great idea as a healthier choice  but poorly executed. They were quartered  which lead to uneven cooking  and dry. I use Jacques Pepin's recipe  using the slicing blade on the food processor and tossing with a bit of olive oil. Service was friendly. There is free WiFi but like many places you need to open the browser and agree to the terms. There are some good HH specials  and quite a few lighter options. Fairly large wine list  but the prices seemed a bit high.Half a step up from TGIF or Applebee's  worth a stop but I wouldn't go too far out of my way.
Leonard H.,Hagerstown  MD,0,15,3,3/25/2017,1.0,"Really disappointed. Reasonable wait for a table- about 15 minutes. Was seated and waiter took our drink orders - they came fairly quickly. Then didn\'t see waiter for over 15 min. Finally got order placed - wait staff brought out the salad  placed it on the table  and left. But there was no silverware. Waited for waiter to come by. Was a no show. After being in restaurant for about one hour  no food other than salad on table. Got the manager  expressed our disappointment with the sub-par service  and left. Went to Outback next door and had a great meal and experience. Loving me some ""No rules! Just Right"""
Charles K.,Largo  MD,128,130,33,4/10/2015,4.0,Atmosphere: Quite nice. The bar was inviting and I was immediately drawn to it. I was a little sad when my party already had a table in the back. The rest of the restaurant is nicely put together. It attracts friends  first time daters  and families young and old.Food: I was hungry  but the menu was overloaded with items and I could not make up my mind. This reminded me of the menu for Cheesecake Factory. There are a lot of choices  which is great  but I wasn't feeling the food. The lack of eating is partly my fault because I should have reviewed the menu online before I entered the restaurant.Beer: I ended up having a lovely Tatonka Stout beer. This beer was malty with notes of chocolate. It was a great way to end the day. I will definitely try more of the beers considering BJ's offers beer flights. I also like the fact that the coaster that comes with the beer highlights the name and a few notes about the beer.Conclusion: I can give this place 4 stars on atmosphere and beer alone. Not sure about the food  but my friends seemed to thoroughly enjoy their meals.
Helen R.,Hyattsville  MD,0,17,10,6/25/2016,5.0,Great food  great service. The ambient is chill  the staff is very attentive. My husband and I went there for the first time and order appetizer  the avocado eggrolls and the cryspi calamari and they were yummy. Greats taste  fresh out the kitchen. The entree was also fresh i had the lime chicken and my husband had the sourdough soup (for got the name) but it was very delicious. And we also had the dessert:) everything look so good as you can see we order alot but definitely will come back again. I was not very sure on going here when i read the reviews but i walked out with a different impression!! I love this restaurant  one more on my fav list!
Sarah M.,Takoma Park  MD,72,210,104,3/7/2015,4.0,Dope vibe. I didn't realize that Laurel had a nice shopping center  but BJ's is one of the newest digs in that area.I dined at BJ's with a group of friends on a Friday night. Casey was our waitress  and she was awesome!If you're into beer  order the Berry Burst Cider. As an appetizer  try their smothered fries.As a meal  try any of their deep dish pizzas!
Cati C.,Ellicott City  MD,53,1,,9/6/2016,1.0,Went here on labor day with a party of nine. Service was super slow from the start and after waiting an hour to get our food two of the people we were with didn't get their food because of problems in the kitchen. When their food finally came it was cold and they wound up just not eating. Also the manager and waitstaff was very rude and not apologetic for the mishap. Seriously disappointing experience
Reggie Y.,Upper Marlboro  MD,157,2,1,12/7/2016,2.0,"I was looking all around town for a Deep Dish Chicago style pizza! I was excited when I found out there was a new BJ\'S in Laurel that sells them. The ordering process was smooth and simple online. I created my own deep dish pizza that came to a total of $24. I wasn\'t to thrilled about the price  but I thought if it cost this much it must be amazing. You know the old saying  ""you get what you pay for."" Well in this case you don\'t! I got my pizza and was highly upset. It wasn\'t deep dish at all! Just thick crust! If I wanted a fake deep dish pizza  I would have went to little ceasers and saved $15! In conclusion  if you\'re looking for Chicago style deep dish pizza like they sell at Uno\'s  BJ\'s is not the place!"
G W.,Burke  VA,3,161,15,2/20/2016,2.0,Stopped in for a couple of beers before heading to the cinema. Only had beer  no food.Beer: 2 stars. Not undrinkable  but nothing close to being on par with any other craft beer out there. Tastes like it's brewed by AB or Miller.Service (Bar): 2 stars. Indifferent  but not awful. It wasn't busy  but bartenders seemed like they thought they had better things to do then attend to their customers.The only reason I would be back would be to grab a beer before another movie  and then only because there are no other options in this plaza.
Dyonna B.,Silver Spring  MD,340,124,48,8/12/2016,4.0,Ok. I'm a fan. Went to this location yesterday for happy hour. For a thirsty Thursday  the cocktail areas was not packed. I was able to quickly find a high top to accommodate all 4 of us. The cocktail area has 3-4 large Tvs that are in great view. Staff was friendly and accommodating. I started off trying the berry blast cider which was pretty yummy. BTW for anyone that doesn't know  this location makes their own beer and ciders. After my taster I ended up getting a pint of it. FYI the alcohol content is very little. I believe around 3.8%. After enjoying that cider  I didn't feel adventurous to try any other beers  so I jumped right back to bud lites. lol I shared some calamari with a friend and I swear  so far this has been the best fried calamari Ive ever tried but the portion size is not a lot. Later on I ended up getting the parm crusted chicken which was super yummy and plentiful. I will def be back. I saw a deep dish pasta that I want to try.
Katrina L.,Temple Hills  MD,16,6,14,4/9/2015,3.0,This was my first visit. I ordered a strawberry mojito which took almost 30 minutes to get it. I couldn't taste s ny alcohol in it. It was more like a strawberry lemonade. I was with a party of 10 people. The waitress  Carolina  was a peach but was clearly overwhelmed with such a large group along with other customers because we had to wait at least 10-15 minutes before we saw her. It was almost an hour from the time that we entered the restaurant until we received our food. The black and bleu house burger was pretty good but a little dry and the fries were greasy. The triple dessert platter was a sure winner. I had the cookies and cream cookie and ice cream. It was both warm and gooey with a perfect combination of sweet creamy ice cream. The manager came over to say hello but didnt ask us how we enjoyed our meal. It was an average dining experience.
Brandon G.,Silver Spring  MD,736,146,45,1/13/2016,5.0,So I went here on a Saturday and it was pretty busy. Not too bad though. So I don't know what the other days are like but Saturday's seem pretty nice to dine.The service was great. Our waiter was prompt  graver her opinion when needed and most of all kept our drinks filled!The atmosphere was nice. Pretty intimate  the way the seats are but still has like a restaurant/bar type feel. Very unique. Not too quiet   not too noisy.Now let's get to what everyone really wants to know. THE FOOD. Bruh  the food was great. I had a simple cheeseburger. What got me was everything else. The appetizers were great. I had fried calimari  along with some orange type of cocktail that was one of the best I've ever had! I also saw a lot of people order their deep dish pizzas. I'm not a huge fan of deep dish  however the pizza did look good. Lastly  the deserts were good as well. Had one of their cookie desserts   which I can't remember the name  but just know it was decisions. Over all I would def come here again!
Jeremy J.,Glen Burnie  MD,0,19,4,6/1/2016,2.0,Losing It! This is the probably the last time we come to BJ's. The service was sub par and the food was cold. Three of us ordered medium pizzas and all three were barely warm. If we had more time  we would've had them made again  but we didn't have time. I ordered BJ's classic pizza... see the attached. Notice that the onions and green peppers  while fresh  are basically raw...like they weren't cooked with the pizza. My family originally loved coming here but this makes the second time in a row that we have been majorly disappointed. Additionally  if you sit in the patio and it is slightly breezy  expect a lot of dusty in your face and on your food as the patio was very dusty.
Chandani C.,Glenarden  MD,56,162,113,4/8/2015,3.0,I went on a Friday night with two friends and understandably  there was a 40 minute wait. Luckily  the weather was nice that night so we just stepped outside and the time passed quickly.Our server was very nice  though he kept making jokes under his breath to entertain us and expected us to laugh  but we could never quite hear him so it just turned into an awkward 5 seconds of silence each time. I am not sure if it was just a really busy night or if the kitchen isn't well staffed (or both) but it took foreverrrrr for our drinks to come out and then another foreverrrrr for our food to come out. This wasn't much of a problem for us since my friends and I had a lot to catch up on  but it's not the ideal spot if you are in a hurry.I ordered their jalapeo burger which was good (and huge!)  but not far as tasty as the description on the menu makes it seem. With all of the new restaurants in the area - there wasn't anything quite memorable about this one that would make me return rather than try out a new place.
DeokHo K.,Beltsville  MD,89,17,6,10/26/2016,4.0,Pizza my heart.Went here on a saturday and it was pretty packed. So  naturally  gravitating to the bar was the best option for quick service. Ordered a pizza and some rootbeer flavored boneless wings. The pizza was awesome. It had that homemade feel without it being homemade. Does that even make sense? Let's try that again. The pizza reminded me of when i was a child and was first introduced to pizza. The dough was cooked perfectly and not runny like some other pizza places that add a lot of toppings on their pizza. What won me over was how the bottom of the pan wasn't drenched in grease. You could literally eat off of it...The boneless wings were okay. Maybe root beer wasn't the best flavor to try...The waiter never told us his name.
Darylevuanie J.,Laurel  MD,51,35,26,2/22/2015,4.0,Our Sunday funday date night included dinner at BJ's. We grabbed some drinks at the bar while we waited for our table. They text you when the table is ready. The bartender was very friendly. She suggested the 10 Handcrafted beers that you can sample. You can sample 4 at a time for less than $10. The beau's least favorite was the Nutty Brunette. Favorite was the Blonde. The Piranha was very good as well. I got the White Zinfandel. Can't go wrong with that. We were seated as soon as we got our drinks and was able to have them sent over instead of walking through the restaurant with them. I got the Lemon Thyme Chicken with brown rice and veggies. Amazing! Low calorie too! Other than the fries being cold the beau got the double bacon cheeseburger and rated it an 8 out of 10. The waitress seemed as though she really didn't want to be there tonight. So the service was subpar. They have a very diverse menu. I love having options! I will for sure be coming back.
Marce D.,Burtonsville  MD,4,60,139,3/24/2016,3.0,I usually love BJs. Today not so much. It was a nice day so I decided to go and sit outside and have a nice meal and drink. It took several times asking for water and utensils from our server who seemed super overwhelmed. She even mentioned to another server she was stressed. We got appetizers. No small plates. Had to send something back. It was on the check twice. Not a good look.
Elo R.,Marietta  GA,70,19,22,1/17/2016,4.0,Here from ATL visiting my boyfriend and not only did we go last night (Saturday) to watch my Cardinals beat Green Bay but went back today again. ... Saturday we were greeted immediately upon arrival n the hostess had us a table within a minute  however we chose to sit at the bar instead. Bartender by the name of Eric greeted us as soon as we took a seat.....We chose to take advantage of their happy hour specials and started with a pepperoni flat bread pizza ....delish!! I also had the small spinach salad ...that was tasty.Of course...drinks..both the sangria and the Tickled Pink ...great!!For our meals my bf had the bbq brisket burger and he smashed that ..lol..he loved it. I had the wings and they were good but I've had better... think this is why  deducted a star .Today ...I wont mention exactly everything we had because well...we pigged out ....but drinks...pizza...bread bowl ...service ...AND dessert...ALL was top notch. Thank u BJs staff.
Sarah S.,Laurel  MD,0,12,6,5/17/2017,3.0,They have a great variety of foods to offer  and the appetizers I had were alright. The drinks are good. They have a bunch of microbrews that seem kind of fun  but I didn't get to try the ones I wanted (like berry-flavored) because they were too pricey. Nice place to go if you have friends over and want to get out of the house.
Melanie B.,Bowie  MD,0,13,2,2/20/2016,4.0,The beers are good and there's a decent selection. The food is pretty good  but the service is the best part. Prompt  friendly  and helpful. I came here tonight (not the first time) and it's unseasonably warm for February. We only wanted to grab a few beers before going to see a movie. They opened up the outdoor seating just for us so we could drink outside since there was no room at the bar  and we didn't have to wait 45 minutes for a table or booth. Will definitely come again :)
Bri H.,Washington  DC,1551,128,1357,12/4/2014,4.0,"I came here Monday night for a random Happy Hour with my friend  which was much needed after the day I had. I actually wasn\'t originally going to go to BJ\'s but my friend suggested it. Although I really wanted to go to one of my ""go to"" spots for Happy Hour  I decided why not....lets try something new! It turned out to be a GREAT NIGHT! I love this place so much! Right when you walk in  the hosts are very sweet and nice  and the ambiance is incredible. It was packed! We sat at the bar and we were greeted immediately by one of the bartenders and he told us about the HH Specials. We decided to get the HH Pizza  HH Comso  HH Egg Rolls  and the HH Strawberry Mojito. Let\'s start with the drinks .... The Cosmo was okay  not as strong as I would have liked but it still tasted pretty good. The Mojito was a little too sweet for my taste but my friend seemed to really like it. I would say they could up the liquor measurement a bit  just a splash or two. Now the food - INCREDIBLE! So tasty and it came out super-fast. The pizza was crispy and flaky while the egg rolls were PACKED with flavor. They are a must if you visit BJ\'s. After two more drinks  we thought  ""We are at a brewhouse and have yet to order beer  THE HECK"" hahaha so we did just that. We ordered the beer flight tasters and we chose two beers each to drink. The best and I mean the best beer was the Grand Cruz! I could cry it was sooooooo good! MMMMHHMMM. We then decided  why not get fatter? So we ordered wangs to go with our beers and ordered the BBQ & Parmesan Wings. They were actually pretty good. They parmesan wings aren\'t my cup of tea  but the BBQ wings were on POINT! Overall  the staff is super nice (the bartenders are funny and easy to talk to)  the food is amazing  and the drinks are good but could use a splash more of the good stuff. Lmao. I will most definitely be back for future Happy Hours! :)Favs - HH Pizza and HH Egg Rolls are phenomenal. Definitely signature items for them. The bartenders were very nice and attentive. Great STAFF!! Would Change - HH Drinks were weak ... I go to the HH mainly for the drinks sooooo it was semi disappointing."
Rebecca C.,Washington  DC,24,143,46,1/5/2016,3.0,"A perfectly fine choice for a date-- not dazzling but not bad either. The ""pizookies"" (warm cookies with ice cream) are especially good. I don\'t usually love cookies-and-cream desserts  but that pizookie was the best-- I\'ll get it again. Salted caramel was also very good  and Ghirardelli chocolate was good too (we got the $9.99 ""pick 3"").As for the rest of the food-- I had the stuffed mushrooms at the recommendations of Yelpers  and was not disappointed  as well as the ""twisted BLT salad "" which was... a salad... also not disappointing. Husband got a bacon cheeseburger. He commented that it felt like a pre-formed patty and wasn\'t impressed with that. The thin-cut fries were tasty.Calamari was kind of a disappointment. The quality of the calamari itself was very good (way to go  BJ\'s)  but it was too greasy-- probably the oil wasn\'t hot enough-- enough that I was blotting pieces on a napkin before I ate them. Could have been the kitchen\'s mistake and not how they normally do it; if it hadn\'t been for that  it would have been pretty great  with a nice lemon aioli.Ambience is ""brewpub."" Overall it\'s better than some of the other brewpub options in the area. Service was pretty solid. They have a nice discounted movie ticket deal with the local theater. Location is excellent  in terms of PG county; the theater is right there  as is Climbzone (seriously  adults should try that place too-- it\'s super fun).I\'d eat there again  and recommend it if you\'re in the area."
Kapri J.,Laurel  MD,297,96,132,12/29/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Came here on 12/29 at about 7 and I have to say is  If this place is busy  expect your drink order to come out after the entre and the entre to come out uncooked. All we got from our server was that they are experiencing poor management and when we pointed out the uncooked pork chop was told they would take it off the bill. Another server showed up only for our server to run over and say he talked to a manager and they already took it off. needless to say I am leaving dinnerless :( probably not coming back unless I am the only one here and how likely is that?!?I think the saving grace as always is the fruit beer called Lindeman's Framboise. I may come back for that it's he only beer I like.
Ieesha J.,Washington  DC,512,310,392,11/26/2014,4.0,As a Cali girl  I am a fan of this establishment. When I found out they were opening up a BJ's across the street from me you can imagine my excitement. I'm not typically a fan of chain restaurants except for BJ's. I've been here 4 times since they opened a little over 2 weeks ago and my experience with the food was consistent. I always order either the Pizza or the Santa Fe Salad along with their famous Pizookie for dessert. YOU can not enter and leave without having a Pizookie - that would be just wrong. The BEST server I've had so far was Patricia. Very funny  knew the menu  was quick on her feet and didn't have us waiting. I had 2 visits and the servers weren't as great but I will give them a pass since its a new restaurant- however I will ask for Patricia the next time I visit. Gotta stick to what you know right?All in all - I'm excited that my fav place is around the corner. The place is pretty packed in the evenings so make sure you're prepared to wait if you come during game time or after 7.
Chanda G.,San Francisco  CA,127,35,11,12/22/2014,2.0,These are all over California and decided to meet my mom and sister here when I got into town for the holiday. Too bad I couldn't have anything I actually wanted because their 86 list was 50+ items long. No cider  out of 9 beers and basic liquors like Stoli and Jim Beam. The manager came over after my FIFTH attempt at ordering a drink and said it was a distributor issue. New place  totally understand if they haven't worked out their ordering yet but don't blame it on a distributor that you're out of standard beers. Sad because my family definitely won't come back after this experience.
Joseph J.,Clarksville  MD,0,98,203,5/21/2015,4.0,4 of us arrived on a Thursday evening around 6. Had a 30 minute wait. No problem. We got drinks at the bar & hung out until our table was ready. Waitress came over fast enough & took our app order. Carnitas & fries...came very fast. Good. I had the bison burger. Wow! Awesome! Tender & juicy like I expected bison to be. Wife got shrimp tacos...very good. Kids got pan pizzas & said they were delish. Overall a good experience. Will be back.
Howard S.,Millersville  MD,0,1,,10/21/2016,5.0,The food was great and the service was one of the best I have had in a long time thanks bjs for a great date night for me and my wife
Michael L.,Bowie  MD,0,3,,10/19/2016,1.0,I've been to BJs twice now and both times the experience was much the same. On the latest occasion we arrive on a Wednesday evening around 5:30 and tables are about 30% occupied (so not very busy). We are seated promptly and placed our order with no problems. Drinks came quickly.After some time passes (we aren't in a hurry) the waitress stops by the table to say the kitchen is backed up and there will be a delay. This repeats some time later. The food arrives and one plate is hot and the others just warm. My burger tasted like it was cooked in a microwave  an even brown from surface to middle. No seasoning and full of oil on the lower bun.  The taste is bland. Another in our party had the pulled was so salty she ate only a few bites. The fries were barely warm so no one ate them. My wife had ribs with potatoes and asparagus. The asparagus was over cooked and stringy and the potatoes cold  lumpy and dry. Overall the worst meal we've had this year.We had a similar experience some time ago when we stopped in for a late lunch around 1:30 on a weekday. Service then was slow and the food quality poor. At the time we chalked it up to a relatively new restaurant at an off hour.BJs is off our list of acceptable restaurants.
Jasmine R.,Silver Spring  MD,3,9,2,6/6/2016,1.0,I'm saddened that I have to write a horrible review as I am a huge fan of BJs. My boyfriend and I came into the restaurant for dinner. We had horrible service (no utensils on the table  slow service  and didn't receive our food for an hour and 15 minutes). I spoke to the manager who apologized for the service  but the waitress  tiara  came back with an attitude. I will never dine at BJs.
Jamie B.,College Park  MD,150,128,196,1/27/2016,5.0,For the price point  portions  atmosphere and drinks  I give BJ's four stars. We had a great time at happy hour  ordering lots of apps. I was in a reasonable group (6) but the bar area was cramped for a party that size. We got Santa Fe spring rolls which were beyond amazing  and we also got the spinach and artichoke dip - also fabulous! I ordered a basil and watermelon margarita  and it might just be my new favorite drink. Initially  the service wasn't great (so the initial arrivals from our party informed those of us who came later) we got a much better server. Carolina took exceptional care of us and was funny to boot. We had a great time meeting here for HH and I hope we do it again soon!
Ravon H.,WINDSOR MILL  MD,137,230,149,7/22/2016,3.0,Good beer and pizza. It's. A little hit and miss for the service. I went once and sat in the bar area and their service was outstanding. It may have been because it was just me though. The pizza I ordered was great and I like the house beer on tap. The second time I came it was with a large group and we sat in the dining area. It was me niece's 33rd birthday and we had a event in the area so we decided to grab dinner here. I ordered wings and a side order of fries. I probably should have stuck with the pizza but I wanted to be adventurous. Service was much slower than the first time I was there. I chalked it up to the fact we had 10 people at the time and not one waitress. When I got my wings they were cold and not very flavorful. Beer was still good and I got a flight with 4 small pours to sample what they had. Over all I would probably be back for the pizza and beer. Hopefully the service will be a little better next go round.
DL D.,Lanham  MD,0,5,1,3/9/2016,4.0,Lamont is a great manager ! Go see Victoria at the bar.Menu for days like you are reading a Harry Potter book. Good deals   not fan of their brussel sprouts though!
Danyelle J.,Baltimore  MD,203,193,248,11/7/2015,3.0,Very spacious! Nice big tables for big family size dinners. Happy hour pizza the best. The delivery of food was speedy. I think that the waitress could have been a little more friendly.
Michelle A.,Hanover  MD,9,29,23,11/7/2015,4.0,I went in on a busy Friday night.Nice ambiance  good for small groups having a date night  birthday  etc.I personally did not have much  I have a limited diet right now. However  the menu is extensive. Calamari appetizers  flatbreads  sliders  sandwiches  couscous dishes  jambalaya  an interesting salad selection  etc. And the dessert menu looked delicious  they have a pumpkin bread dessert that I will be back to try before the season is over.My besti ordered the jambalaya  one of her favorite dishes and completely cleaned her dish  lol.My other friend ordered the chicken club that comes w/ extra crispy shoe string fries. She has culinary experience and kept talking about the bread of the sandwich was perfectly seasoned. She believes it was something about garlic butter used to toast the bread.We also ordered the beer sampler (it's worth trying)Or you can ask for .50 cent samples of any beer you want to try. We also ordered some black cherry  whiskey drink that was not worth it.Portions: The portion sizes are good  they do fill the plate and you might have leftovers. Service: I had a great waitress  I think her name was Tara. The food came out hot and within 15 minutes. Overall  no complaints  I will be back.
Mitchell M.,Rockville  MD,0,57,6,2/19/2016,4.0,Only tried desserts and came out thinking that pizookies are over rated. Everyone was telling me to try it and at best its Meh. I actually enjoyed the Fried Doughnut with strawberry sauce and whip cream. And the adult root beer float was also tasty.i would like to try BJ's again in the future.
John A.,Upper Marlboro  MD,55,171,117,10/26/2015,3.0,I have been to 3 different locations of BJ's Restaurant and all 3 have resulted in different reviews. This past visit to BJs was certainly not one of the best but it is understandable given the size of the restaurant and the amount of people out on a Saturday night. Food was served hot but nothing spectacular. Calamari was slightly undercooked and deep dish pizza was just notches above pizza hut...So why do I keep coming back......the beer is cold and the choices are plentiful.....its a love hate relationship....after a few beers this place kinda grows on you.....the bazoukee is by far the best part of the meal....A1 desserts for sure
Sharde D.,Alexandria  VA,36,1,,6/7/2016,3.0,I'm giving three stars because I had an amazing attentive friendly server (  David  ). The drinks my girlfriend and I got were really good but the expectation of the food wasn't. She had eaten here before and has had great food but we tried something different somewhere different and neither of us were happy. Her alfredo pasta was dry and under seasoned i got the shrimp and asparagus and my shrimp was under cooked . The atmosphere is nice but the expectation to be great should be an all around experience. We are both chefs and this was a let down for the both of us. Next time i do hope the experience will be better.
Sean W.,Haddonfield  NJ,38,5,1,9/7/2016,4.0,Went on Labor Day on our way home from Richmond. We were seated right away  but waited a little bit before we were greeted by a server. Our server was very friendly and she offered good recommendations. I ordered the hickory burger  my girlfriend ordered the bacon guacamole burger  since she's a vegetarian she ordered minus the bacon and with a veggie patty instead. Our food was out from the kitchen within a reasonable amount of time  but without the guacamole on the burger  which was promptly brought out after we brought it to their attention (We're easy to please). My burger was fantastic  it's so hard to find a chain restaurant that cooks a proper medium burger  but they nailed it. The burgers came with shoestring fries  which I don't always care for  but they hit the spot. The handcrafted root beer and vanilla cream sodas were very good and we left satisfied customers.
Darnisha T.,Laurel  MD,174,32,70,12/19/2015,4.0,I was able to come here with my family for the first time. My parents spoke highly about this place. I tried the avocado egg rolls and I wasn't too thrilled about them. It had a kick but I felt like I've had better. I was able to get the BJ's classic ribeye with white cheddar mash potatoes and asparagus. That steak was everything!!!!! It was cooked to perfection. Great flavor and it wasn't dry. The mash potatoes and asparagus were great as well. I took some of my brother's fries and they were yummy. I tried some of my mother's sparkling raspberry lemonade and it was amazing. I recommend this place for anybody wanting a good steak on Laurel.
Liv D.,Washington  DC,2,19,2,11/30/2015,5.0,"Can you say ""Good BEER""Ah! I love beer! They have the best hand crafted and beers on Tap in TOWN.The food is good  can\'t complain too much it holds the beer down.:) When I was there someone was celebrating their birthday party and it gave me an idea  to celebrate my birthday there. Serve is good  food is good  BEER is great!"
Kelleen N.,Columbia  MD,109,56,42,4/28/2016,1.0,No no no no no. My latest experience here was AWFUL. My husband took me here for my birthday which turned out to be a huge mistake. After waiting 15 minutes for our waiter to get to our table we ordered waters with lemon then waited another 10 for the water and an additional 10-15 for the lemons which my husband ended up going to the bartender to get himself. Should have left at that point but unfortunately we ordered our food and only got 1/2 of our order to which we responded by talking to the manager who also had to talk to the other 2 angry tables next to us that had a similar experience. He told us that he would box the other half of the meal that we'd canceled and comp what we already had payed for. Well  I still have a $20 charge on my card. I'm pissed and won't be returning anytime soon. Oh! Also  called the restaurant a couple days later to speak to a manager and was told I'd receive a call back  never did :) going to corporate now
Anthony B.,Manheim  PA,198,35,9,10/5/2015,2.0,"UPDATE** they just changed the happy hour 2 days ago. The happy hour specials are terrible now. They went from the best possible happy hour to the below mediocre. The food is still good but what a major disappointment! New happy hour is 1/2 off mini deep dish pizza  $1 off draft beer/wine  and $2 off shareable appetizers. COMPLETE disappointment. My fianc and I will be finding a new happy hour location. We are thoroughly annoyed. BJ\'s  shame on you. This was ""our spot"" where we loved coming after a hard day of work. Bring back $4 you-call-its. I guess it\'s time to find a new happy hour location. ***OLD REVIEW: Best happy hour specials in Laurel  hands down. My fianc and I go here almost once a week. They have an incredible personal deep dish pizza  wings  and all your favorite foods. Drinks are made right and the food has never let us down. One of the absolute best parts of BJs is the selection of beers on tap. We usually go around 4:30 on weekdays. The bar is usually pretty quiet so we sit right up and unwind after a hard day of work. The bartenders are great and friendly as well. I look forward to my visits here. TIP: On Sundays when the NFL is on  it\'s often hard to find a seat unless you get there early because."
Daniel C.,Rockville  MD,0,4,1,4/19/2016,1.0,I recently celebrated my grandfather's birthday at BJ's in Laurel. I was deeply disappointed with our experience with this establishment. The appetizers took 40 minutes to come out  only to find that they weren't what we ordered. On top of this  one of my family members was forced to wait an additional 20 minutes for his entree. The food was tasteless  and considering the prices it's safe to say that they're basically robbing their customers. I'll never dine here again.
Linda C.,Annapolis  MD,8,17,23,12/11/2015,4.0,The soups are BOMB! I had a hard time choosing between the lasagna and the salmon. I went there with my family and friend  it was great. The server are super friendly and helpful. I recommend the clam chowder on de bread!! My brother had the guacamole burger and he loved it.
D S.,Washington  DC,4,37,17,10/28/2015,2.0,I've eaten here on 3 occasions. I can't recommend the food. I think I've only been here more than once because it's convenient and I think I wanted to believe I just got unlucky once  or twice. But after eating there and NOT having a drink. I realized this place sucks. No alcohol to trick me into thinking it was mediocre. The food is boring and bland. I should have known when I was handed a menu that looked more like a college text book that this wasn't going to be a good look. Too many food options means a restaurant likely doesn't have anything all that great. Trying to be too many things to too many people is hard to pull off. Cheesecake factory manages to pull it off  but this place. Nope!And it's not all in my head  I've eaten here with others who reported the same thing. Bland. Boring. Unmemorable. Overwhelming menu selection  underwhelming taste.I've done the Salmon - Bland  not horrible. Just mediocre.I've done the fish and chips - I hate string fries for one. And fish was bland and mediocre bordering on nasty.My date had some sort of pasta. Shrimp and linguine. She complained that the shrimp was still opaque/undercooked. She then complained the food was also down right bland (you see a theme here). The saving grace was the garlic cheese bread that came with it. Mind you this women eats any and everything. I have never seen her turn down food. And she's definitely not picky so hearing her say this place sucked is saying something..
Joshua A.,Westmere  NY,9,36,,8/12/2015,2.0,My family and i step into BJ's for a bite after a long day of travel so we figured go with the chain place that had decent Yelp reviews. The hostess was sweet to the kids  quick  polite  and knowledgeable about the menu. Our server was training  I assume because she had a tag along but didn't say why  they were polite and knowledgeable at the beginning.We order a few apps  the were okay  not how the menu described or pictured ( few things different) but no real issue.Then we waited 30 minutes our food  no drink refills  and one dish out of seven came out and we all drooled while only one plate of food was on the table. We had been told the fryer went down but the only dish at our table that needed frying was the fried chicken and that was the only dish at the table.I ordered a pizza because It had a whole menu page and the server mentioned it so I figured it's a dish they do well. BUZZZZZ! Wrong answer  go to Harris Teeter for pizza (I did after) it is in the same plaza  cheaper and tastes 100% better.The best part of the night was the Root Beer they make in house but I only had one glass because after the servers could see we were bothered they stayed sparseWould not bother with this place try Mission BBQ (same plaza too).
Krystle L.,Beltsville  MD,100,5,,8/13/2016,5.0,Awesome food and Wonderful Service!!! I highly recommend the burgers and seared tuna salad. I will definitely return in the future!!!
Sean F.,Beltsville  MD,177,371,58,8/5/2015,2.0,Slow  slow service. I've been pretty excited about the couple new craft beer places popping up around Laurel and didn't think twice about meeting up with some co-workers for the happiest of hours. Unfortunately this slowly turned into the saddest of hours. The place is pretty nice and the hostess was friendly  courteous but then the downhill slide began. I got to happy hour at BJ's with about 45 minutes to go. Order a beer  the house stout in nitro  and asked for a happy hour specials menu. At the same time my coworker ordered a bottle of Budlight. 20 minutes later none of the three had arrived. I understand a nitro beer doesn't pour quickly but a bottle of bud and a specials menu shouldn't take anymore than 10 minutes at most. 15 minutes later her beer came out a little warm  my beer came out fine and the food menu came out finally. 25 minutes later our server came back around but it was now past happy hour prices and I had no interest in spending any more money at BJ's. I can't say you should steer clear but be wary. I ended up meeting up with another and eating elsewhere. Side note: My nitro house stout was one of the better stouts I've had. It had a creamy  smooth mouthfeel and good notes of chocolate on the nose and coffee in the body. It would've probably pair well with that chocolate brownie pizookie but I never had the opportunity to try that combo. Pro tip might be to grab a seat at the bar instead of the dining floor.
Shellie M.,Laurel  MD,0,17,36,5/9/2016,5.0,I Order takeout for my son all the time and my husband and son go together to pick it up - my son has autism and the bartender was veryyyy nice to him made his day I wish my husband had gotten her name she was very attentive to him and sweet to my son which means a lot because my son was ecstatic thanks to how she treated him - I will edit this if I get her name very awesome !
Dilon W.,Washington  DC,5,31,13,11/28/2015,4.0,Still impressed with BJs  I wish I checked in as often as I go. You should definitely check this place out. The menu is extensive  it will a while to move through it all. I had the deep dish pizza and it was delicious. I like that it comes with its own personal holder for the pan. The beer selection is premium as well  you can even mix beers to create your own unique flavors. Check this place out!!
Carol P.,Silver Spring  MD,0,18,,7/31/2016,1.0,I wish i could give this place zero starts. We came for dinner at the bar. Food was brought cold  they actually said we microwave it again. I was like wtf. Manager and wait staff was rude. We came for the delicious mahi mahi with quinoa and shrimp. They can with a cold disgusting plate that appeared to be someone leftovers.Never coming back this place is disgusting.
Harley L.,Adelphi  MD,44,1,,7/30/2016,4.0,Sport bar feel. The wait was long to get a table but to be fair it was a Friday evening. The food selection was great and the portions were good. Server was very friendly  respectful and overall she was great. I would recommend it to a friend and would go again but not on a busy Friday night.
George B.,Severn  MD,5,10,,1/21/2016,3.0,Had a deep dish pizza from here  it wasnt that good  imo. Felt like it was pre made dough with cheese warmed up on it. But on the flip side the bar and my drinks were awesome  the long islands are good.Went on a friday night  wait was only about 20 mins and my server was really cool. Maybe next time I'll try a different meal but the pizza is better at Uno's if you looking for a personal deep dish.
Samasama P.,Maryland City  MD,4,7,13,10/9/2016,1.0,"Food was great as always. Server was horrible he took our order after that we didn\'t see him no more he walked past our table multiple times and didn\'t even see if we needed refills or anything. I noticed he didn\'t check on ""people of color"" but did check on ""Caucasian race"" which I found very strange. Even one of the other workers said he needs a good slap  I\'m guessing this isn\'t the first time. Anyways we had to get the manager and he apologized and was very helpful including discounting us for such a long wait and horrible service from the waiter. The waiter came over and was like ""the food will be out now the manager told me"" we was like ok we was wondering because you never came to our table and checked in with us. He was like ""do you need anything"" No it\'s too late and on top of that he was being a jerk about it. He needs to be retrained other than that I would go here again but a better server !"
R David S.,Dallas  TX,18,168,114,5/9/2016,3.0,I went there for a NBA game. Good place  good options of food. Nothing different. It is a regular chain restaurant. Is good for meet someone  to watch a sport event but if you are looking for a different kind of food  something special this is not the place. Solid food but nothing special. Again  for a sport event is a good option.
Jay S.,Hyattsville  MD,118,39,23,5/9/2015,1.0,WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED. It's very disappointing because the food is actually decent. However  the service is unacceptable. Our waiter paid little to no attention to us. We sat down at 9:51pm  and only received water at 10:15. (25 minutes later!)After he came with the water  we decided it was best to place our appetizers. 10 minutes later the appetizer came  and our waiter was never to be seen again. He completely went M.I.A. We were so frustrated and upset  we decided to go to the host get our check and leave. Because of this experience I will never go back again to B.J brewery again! Our waiters name was Darian. Worst WAITER EVER! If you have him make sure you ask for another waiter or leave. You will not be happy.
Jocelyn S.,Baltimore  MD,236,9,,5/26/2016,2.0,I love the atmosphere of the place  unfortunately the customer service is not up to par. I called to make a reservation and was spoken to in an extremely condescending and snotty manner  I let this go although my reservation was clearly not placed. I won't discredit the franchise; they have decent food and a great place for drinks. However  I will not be returning due to the customer service including our waiter.
Sarisa K.,Silver Spring  MD,138,32,20,5/9/2015,1.0,I've been here a few times and both times were not memorable. The service was severely lacking  I waited 10 minutes for someone to even greet me. While that was me being patient  it took 15 mins to get my drinks.... my appetizers came out before I even got water..The restaurant was not busy either  the food was even more disappointing. My sandwich was burnt as well as the salmon my bf got. They gave him asparagus ends for his veggies. Not edible at all! Overall  avoid this place. Go to Nandos or panera instead. 5 thumbs down
B R.,Laurel  MD,0,3,,1/6/2017,4.0,I mainly get take-out from here  but I've eaten inside a few times. More vegetarian options than most places  but fewer than I'd need to give five stars. Avocado egg rolls are love. Stuffed mushrooms are a close second. Deep dish pizza is a bit bready  but I like it. The enlightened brussel sprout/kale/cranberry/etc salad is my go-to when I want something healthy but a bit fancy  and is quite satisfying. Lots of TVs with sports inside. Prices are maybe a little high on certain items  but it's overall a good value  especially if you look for a coupon (which they've had regularly on their website through the holidays). Head's up  though  fellow vegetarians  this location does not have veggie burgers as far as I can tell.
Taylor P.,Clinton  MD,1,4,1,4/4/2016,3.0,"Went there last night. The Server introduced herself then we got a different waiter due to a ""shift change.""I included quotes because the young woman continued to serve two tables so don\'t know what that was about. Our service wasn\'t bad  but it wasn\'t great. Mediocre."
Eric L.,Elkridge  MD,9,238,5,8/22/2015,2.0,We had a mediocre experience on our first occasion and decided to come again and try different items. Overall  the food is decent  but not great including their signature pizza. It can get quite loud and many people in here are just getting drunk so it borders on not being a family friendly environment. The service was also pretty slow on our last trip and the restaurant was not full. I can't find a good reason to come back. There are many places like BJ's in the area.
Jon R.,Laurel  MD,732,94,2,9/24/2015,4.0,We have now been there three times. The first time was a fluke. Last minute trip that ended up really lovely. The next time was for my birthday with my parents. Again  lovely time and good food. The last time was just recent--- went there for my wedding anniversary. All three times we have had excellent food and wonderful service. The only complaint is the price is a wee expensive for a Brewhouse. But it is still excellent and we are total fans!
Wilfred B.,Burtonsville  MD,0,13,9,11/13/2016,3.0,Went to happy hour with my love. $2 dollars off food items and $1 dollar off select alcoholic beverages. I ordered spaghetti with meatballs  the pasta was good but the meatballs were bland. My love ordered the Santa Fe Salad  which she thought was sub par and will not be ordering again. We also ordered Garlic Parmesan chicken wings that were very delicious and was the only reason for 3 stars.
Young V.,Washington  DC,0,103,21,11/21/2015,1.0,Gross pulled pork. Rather chunks of pork dog food. And cole slaw that was merely a few large chunks of cabbage.Fried chicken wasn't terrible  but side salad  mashed potatoes and corn were all blah.Third and last time going here.Plus the beers are misses. Wish they'd put a duclaw here instead.
Lucas C.,Ellicott City  MD,52,5,1,5/14/2016,5.0,Our server was excellent. The food here was pretty lit. Staff is very efficient and the wait time goes by quick on a busy day. Our servers name was Evelyn. And Mark the manager a very stand up guy.
Patrice J.,Silver Spring  MD,7,48,4,2/11/2016,1.0,Craptastic! Horrible service  undercooked food and the dining room is uncomfortably cold.
Timothy S.,Norfolk  VA,0,33,10,5/28/2016,1.0,30 min+ wait for food every time. Don't come here unless you aren't going to be hungry in an hour.
L. D.,Laurel  MD,0,5,,11/22/2016,4.0,I tried this place out a week ago. The beer was very palatable not too hoppy. I ended up ordering dinner. Salmon was fresh and well-prepared. It was a little pricey. Otherwise there was nothing not to like.
Jackie G.,Silver Spring  MD,35,28,54,3/24/2015,3.0,I went to grab drinks and some food on a Friday night. The dining area had a wait of 30 min. I sat at the bar my waitress looked like he didn't want to be there. I ordered barbecue wings and brewhouse blonde. I asked for my wings to be cooked well done there weren't. I enjoyed the brewhouse blonde beer. It's great atmosphere and great to watch basketball games. Since they have numerous TVs mounted on there walls.
Tianna W.,Silver Spring  MD,10,15,,7/5/2015,4.0,Went there for a work party for a fellow employee. Note - if you want to have a private party here  just know it won't be private. They don't have private rooms  so they can only reserve you tables in the main dining area. Overall food was great and service was ok - we all got our drinks after we finished our appetizers (this includes water). Some people really didn't like that  so thats really the only minus. However  I feel like the food is worth 4 stars. We had the pepporoni  bbq  and veggie pizzas plus bbq salad and house salad. Everything tasted great  cool atomsphere. I would visit again minus my coworkers lol.
Rene R.,Baltimore  MD,19,177,,8/25/2016,5.0,My first visit to the Laurel location and it did not disappoint! We added 4 people to our party after we had been seated and they worked quickly to get us re seated and did not make us feel like it was an inconvenience (though my years working in a restaurant tell me otherwise ). The bathroom was super clean and it appeared that in the 2 hrs we were there it was freshened up. Even on a busy Friday night. The service was wonderful. And the food was delicious. With 12 people at a table we ate a variety of foods. I do regret that none of us saved room for dessert. I had the salmon with brown rice and veggies. The salmon was so flavorful  the veggies were lightly sauted and the brown rice was surprisingly tasty. If you've ever made brown rice at home you know it isn't the most delightful grain without some help. There was also pizza that was very good. And my husband and coworker enjoyed their jambalaya. And we had crispy calamari to get our meal started right. The kids had Chicken tenders and wings with fries. (I loved the fries). All in all it was a wonderful meal. And we are very glad there's a location so close. My sister and bil take their kids weekly for pizza - we'll be joining them more frequently.
Jeanie L.,Laurel  MD,3,41,113,2/11/2016,5.0,Great food. Great beer. Fantastic service. Wandered in because we were treated rudely at Outback and we were so happy we did!
Phlzgud G.,Greenbelt  MD,0,8,,12/5/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Nice place to go  bar always full. Great selection of beers and the bartenders are friendly! Only downside lately  the pot sticker dipping sauce has changed and is now practically super sweet syrup!
Crystal L.,Columbia  MD,34,91,137,9/1/2015,4.0,Chic  modern & still very family friendly. The environment gives me an upscale TGIFridays vibe with a mind blowing drink selection! I've been here twice and I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. The staff were all very friendly and the restrooms were clean. Oh- if you will be visiting the movies they currently have a special if you purchase your tickets from them.
A R.,Laurel  MD,0,8,5,12/2/2016,5.0,Love this place! Great appetizers  pizza  and pizookies!
Fuck F.,Savage  MD,0,1,,6/5/2016,1.0,"Horrible service  kept us waiting for an hour  and the food was cold by the time it was ""ready"".Waitress offered a very half - hearted apology  clearly not wanting to be there as much as we did not.Go to Mission BBQ across the street - theyre awesome."
Andrea L.,Capitol Heights  MD,0,12,11,8/16/2016,3.0,Wait time isn't the greatest  food is sub-par. Probably cool for just drinks  at the bar.
Chi C.,Silver Spring  MD,0,5,2,11/24/2016,4.0,They have a amazing selection on food and huge . You will find what you are looking for . Even there beers are good . They have happy hour when I went not sure the day it was but the food drinks good . The services was ok because the one lady was new at this place . But she new enough to get my stomach right ! Thanks
Laila M.,Baltimore  MD,7,26,11,4/6/2015,2.0,The food here is always good. But the customer service is lacking. Our waitresses acted as though she wanted to be anywhere but here. She rudely dumped our plates on the table. Never checked in on us while happily talking to other patrons. And just really came of as rude and inconsiderate. This has been pretty consistent with our experience. Last time we came our waitress disappeared for over twenty minutes in the back and another waitress named Daniele had to get us water and help us. All in all new servers need to be hired. Edited****We actually talked to the Manager and she let us know this was her best server. And the servers attitude went down hill after she found out we asked to talk to a manager. She didn't look at us just rudely placed the check down and haughtily walked away. The same when she picked up the check. We won't ever be returning. If you're having a bad day and work in the front lines with customers. Call out don't come in. Don't ruin others experiences by not even pretending to be friendly.
Christina S.,Severn  MD,179,54,12,6/11/2015,5.0,I've drove past this restaurant a few times and figured I'd finally come in and give it a try. Man was I impressed. The dining room areas was competent full. Always a good sign. The hostess told us that there was one booth at the bar available so we sat there and were greeted almost instantaneously. My boyfriend and I each got a couple of their specialty beers which we were both pleased with. He ordered a deep dish pizza of some sort and I ordered the spicy pig tavern pizza. Both were amazing. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. We will be coming back and I can't wait for my next visit.
Shatekia M.,Las Colinas  TX,3,26,27,6/22/2015,4.0,Awesome place! Stumbled upon this place while in the area and so glad I did!! Loved the ambiance..wasn't too loud..and I didn't have a problem finding a seat on a Saturday evening. I enjoyed the best ever stuffed mushrooms and personal pan pizza I was really good although I wish it was a little hotter. I felt like perhaps it had been sitting for a little while. I would definitely come back. Nice place in a nice area in Laurel :-)
Rebeca F.,Pikesville  MD,49,182,,5/27/2015,4.0,There was a mix up with our reservation  but once we got it sorted out things went pretty smoothly. Nice beer selection  and you can order it in a pitcher. The pizza here is really good! Can't wait to go back and try it again! Hopefully next time I'll have room for dessert because they looked amazing.
Rhonda S.,Laurel  MD,14,102,2,1/1/2015,2.0,Whenever I visit California  I usually go to a BJ's. It's a good chain with great food.Now  lets talk about the Laurel location. I have given them two tries and both times it took forever.The first time we arrived around 7pm and ordered a glass of wine  4 waters  1 pizza  1 appetizer and a pazookie for dessert. Easy enough. The wine took 20 minutes to come out and the whole dining experience took about two and a half hours. That's how slow service is. The food was pretty good  but I don't have all day to sit at this establishment.The second time I ordered carryout. I parked in the alloted space and called the number on the sign upon arrival as directed and..... no answer. It took about 3 minutes for someone to pickup. Finally a friendly guy came out to our car and took my card back in to charge it. What is this  1992? With all of the technology now available  as well as credit fraud  why does BJ's force this kid to run all over the place? Get an Ipad and let the customer swipe their own card. I mean  I have been to locations where you can pay on your phone at the table  so why this antiquated method of payment? After all of this  our food still wasn't ready and we ended up waiting about 20 minutes for carryout we called in 30 minutes prior.This location needs help. I have visited the Gainesville  Va location as well and they are on point. I am not sure if the Laurel location needs new management  training  or if it sucks because it's Laurel  but seriously get with it if you want good clientele to continue to come.
Uche I.,Laurel  MD,0,17,2,4/15/2016,2.0,My issue with this place was the dinner ware. My napkin was dirty because it still had dried  crusty food on it. The silver ware had a cloudy look to it. The plates had finger prints.  Other than those  eat on folks!!!! :oD
Cheeyaka I.,Laurel  MD,5,22,,3/23/2015,4.0,I did a girls night out here with some friends and we definitely had a great time.It was on one of those game nights  so the bar was packed with a bunch of folks watching a football game. I rolled up in there with 4 other girls and the attention from the males was crazy. Unfortunately for them  all the other girls were married but hey single ladies  this might just be your spot to meet a nice guy out and about.We even got free drinks from the bartender. No complaints at all.The food was good  the menu is very extensive like a Cheesecake factory kinda deal so it was slightly overwhelming but the service was good and quick.All in all  we had a good time and I wouldn't mind checking this spot out again.
Elizabeth P.,Fulton  MD,40,9,,5/12/2016,5.0,Very friendly staff. Helpful and personable. Zach was wonderful. Twisted BLT salad was good. Roast beef dip was great.
Krystal M.,McDonough  GA,0,15,,5/6/2016,5.0,I love THIS PLACE. LIVE THE PEOPLE and live the food they are great the pizza is amazing never had the beer but heard it's amazing
Akilah U.,Jessup  MD,5,29,39,2/20/2016,4.0,pretty good food and drinks (depending on bartender)-ive had to return drinks a couple of times. Service is good.
Sheree W.,Charlotte  NC,43,166,142,4/11/2015,5.0,I've been to BJs three times so far and I've yet to be disappointed. They still serve salads the way they used to...HUGE! It's our new favorite spot. It gets very crowded so I always put us in the wait list. And their drinks are great as well. The wait staff very friendly.
Joseph W.,Columbia  MD,74,229,47,1/28/2015,5.0,First time here with the wife and kids. I enjoyed the beer sampler  since I couldn't figure out what beer I wanted. I had the salmon with the cherry flavored sauce. The waitress was great she came around every few minutes to check on us. It was crowded to be a new place  but I will definitely come back again. Almost for got the dessert. Don't remember the name but it had a cookie at the bottom and chocolate Ice cream on top and a chocolate sauce. NICE NICE NICE
De'Leisa N.,Washington  DC,126,226,24,3/11/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Much better service but still had to wait for refills and the check. Extreme Veggie Pizza good. I forgot the name of the dessert but the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream is the bomb.com. 5 stars. I worked it off by beating my boyfriend in Michael Jackson experience on the Wii...lol. Strong 3.5.
Banji E.,Laurel  MD,1,8,,9/8/2015,4.0,awesome service and great food. Loved the vibe too  makes you feel like ur not in laurel.somewhat pricy tho. Our food didnt take long and our server was the most charming person though i didnt catch her name. Most definitely recommending it to my fiends and relatives
N I.,Burtonsville  MD,0,24,,6/2/2015,3.0,"I came to BJ\'s shortly after it was opened since I love beer and brewhouses. Initially I was disappointed because their beer is fairly mediocre. I\'ve tried a few items on their food menu and most of them were just ok  until I had their deep dish pizza and pizzokie. Those two things are the saving grace for this place. I am not a huge fan of deep dish pizza  but their deep dish pizza dough tastes amazing. The pizzokie is amazing. I\'ve tried several of them  but their oreo cookie pizzokie is by far the best. Service can be hit or miss. There were times where they are really slow and not terribly friendly  but there are a few servers who really do a great job and make you feel welcome. Their mobile app is neat as it lets you ""call ahead"" your spot  and this place can get pretty busy on weekends.One thing that was disappointing is that one day they ran out of mini deep dish pizzas. I don\'t know that this is a fact  but if you can still serve medium or large pizzas  wouldn\'t you be able to make a mini pizza  too? Unless  you are using pre-cut frozen dough. If that\'s the case  that\'s pretty disappointing. It tastes great  but it just bugs me that it would be frozen or pre-made in some other manner. I still return occasionally for a black & tan  deep dish pepperoni and ham  and an oreo pizzokie."
Tylvia E.,Washington  DC,192,35,8,1/7/2015,4.0,I have been here only once  and I plan to go back so I will probably update this review.One of my best friend's and I went here post-workout  so we were looking for some healthier options. I ordered the watermelon salad which was delish! The feta cheese and watermelon worked amazingly together. Next  we split the pork chops entree. I was great  and I would order this again. My only complaint was the Brussel sprouts which were brutally roasted.No dessert this this!
Jeremy C.,DeRidder  LA,5,19,,3/7/2016,5.0,I don't know why I haven't reviewed this place sooner. I go here every once in a while and typically try a new burger or some other red meat option and I always love it  however  I had their ahi salad tonight and was blown away. The ginger/lemon vinegrette was amazing  the ahi was seared to perfection and then chilled. Their beers are fine but I don't come here for the beer. If great staff and good food are what you're looking for  look no further.
CanUHandleTheTruth S.,San Jose  CA,2,4,1,5/5/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Hoping they have change the new manager  until then Galaxy Nail Spa team won't coming  thx for nothing
Amber J.,Washington  DC,33,147,44,11/14/2015,5.0,We came on a Friday and it was a wait. We waited for about 30 minutes. We were greeted by a nice server who was accommodating. The spinach and artichoke dip was really good and piping hot  I have to come back for it :) We had the beer sampler which was awesome they give you some generous portions I'll be back for that too ! I ordered some fish tacos which were ugly and piled with garnish. After sending it back I ordered the margarita flat bread which was good....overall they have many choices to choose from and my food was good....I'll be back soon....
Mama M.,Laurel  MD,2,5,4,11/24/2014,4.0,Decor: outstanding. Food: delectableService: ummmm  dont know if BJ's is hiring experienced staff...Daniel (black lady with blonde hair) took and unusually long time to take my order....she does NOT know how to multitask....LOOOOOOOVED ERIC behind the bar!!!! Awesome personality and great bar artist.I'll be back.....
Tony H.,Eglin Air Force Base  FL,0,20,3,6/12/2015,5.0,100's of beers  awesome signature apps & meals. Unique selection of pizzas. Hood for singles or a family and very affordable. Service is consistent. Been here multiple times. Check it out
Andrea F.,Laurel  MD,138,6,,4/1/2015,4.0,I've been to this restaurant a few times now  and I really enjoy it.My first time  I went during lunch with a friend and sat at their bar. Since it was slow  the bartender was always there when we needed her. I enjoyed their deep dish pizza (which is now something I get every time)  along with trying my friends BBQ Lunch Platter. The chicken was sooo good!!I went back another time with a different friend. She was very indecisive  and despite being busy  the waitress was patient. She also gave great recommendations. I tried the deep dish lasagna  which I wish had more pasta. I found it to be a bit over loaded with cheese. My friend ordered a mixed drink that was recommended by the waitress as well. We found the drink to be entirely too strong and sweet  so it was hard for her to finish.At my third visit  I took my boyfriend  who has a gluten allergy. He had the gluten free pizza and really enjoyed being able to pick his own toppings. I ordered the deep dish pizza again  and had a side of their fires (they are to die for!!) Overall we had a great visit  with one exception. We were seated near the bar area  where there was a large group of extremely LOUD women. Although that was no fault of the restaurant  it did hinder the experience just a bit.At my most recent visit  I took my office staff for lunch. I again had the deep dish pizza  but this time with a Cesar salad. My boss had the BBQ platter that I recommended  two of the girls has Chicken Club Sandwiches with fries but they were only able to finish half  as they were large portions. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Our waiter was slightly less attentive  but it was a busy lunch hour. One thing they did was constantly brought out new soda before someone would finish. It was nice but I found it odd they never asked if anyone would like water or a different drink.I have found that their food is great  and their service is sometimes a little off. Overall I really like this new addition to Laurel!
Denny M.,Beltsville  MD,6,14,1,9/26/2015,5.0,You can NOT go wrong at BJ's! When you want good food and good drinks locally in Laurel - head on over - sooo happy this was added to the Town Center. Absolutely everything we've had has been great! Call ahead!
Deanna D.,Vienna  VA,17,11,1,5/1/2016,1.0,I'd give this place no stars if I could. We rolled in 8 people deep and waited 20 mins. for a table which is typical. Once we sat down  we waited another 10 minutes for our server  Lamont  to take our order. Cool. While we waited  we didn't at least get our waters. We're f**king parched at this time. After 20 minutes  our server comes back and asked to run down the orders again because he couldn't read his own handwriting! What the hell was he doing for the past 20 minutes?! WTF! We got the manager to come by  and we asked for our drinks and made a complaint about our server. He apologizes  and I assumed he went to talk to the server. No body comes back for the next 10 mins. Every table around us  including who sat after us  got their drinks and food. Still no water for us. As soon we saw a table who sat after us get their drinks  we just got up and left and walked over to Outback! We waited an hour for this BS.
Dee M.,Hyattsville  MD,0,18,,5/6/2016,1.0,I wish I could a -10 review. This place does not even deserve a 1 star. We went for happy hour at this place. The bartender Brittany passed by us multiple times w/o asking us what we wanted. It's not like it was busy. After we finally got our drinks... When our drinks were almost empty she did not even ask if we wanted another one but wait she had time to ask both the parties sitting besides us if they wanted drinks.. Never ever going on to this place. The gentleman who was working with her was nice.
Diane K.,Laurel  MD,0,2,,5/24/2015,5.0,I should have stock in this company by now! I have made my way thru this huge menu and it is all excellent food! Not to mention the craft beer selection nice bar area also the service is great and I find I am going there exclusively with my besties!O I forgot to mention the non alcohol drinks such as peach tea have been highly recommended. I cannot say enough about this brew house! It's all good!
Katie M.,Laurel  MD,12,41,2,9/26/2015,4.0,BJ's is a solid choice for late-night or happy hour dining  and a solid addition to Laurel Town Center. For seated dining  they can be a bit chancey depending on who your server is and what time of day you're there. However  I've always had good luck in the self-seating bar area in the evening and during the night. It's always fairly easy to find a seat  the service is standard bar service  the beer is cold and plentiful  and the food is better-than-usual bar fare. I love their different take on pizza and (of course) their pizookies. Altogether a solid choice  as long as you know what you're in for!
Janet H.,Laurel  MD,182,151,49,11/24/2014,4.0,3.5 stars rounding up. not bad  not wow'ed  pretty solid chain.we had the mango thai salad and definitely enjoyed it. we also had their bison burger and it was decent  not over-done  cooked well  just lacked a bit of flavor. we also had their flat bread appetizer (which came out at the same time as our meal  and so the table got a bit crowded fast)  that was ok as well. all-in-all it's not bad. it is a chain and it has the typical solid chain feel/taste/comfort. like other BJ's i've been to  this is similar to the rest to make me feel like it'll be consistent in quality  hopefully.this is in the new laurel towne center and just opened up. having said that  the servers were all trying to get use to the menu  as are we of them being around (wasn't sure what came with the bison burger.. cole slaw? a side? fries?). so i give them a little lee-way in that regards. with that in mind  they were definitely trying and were on top of filling our drinks  taking away our plates  etc. our particular server seemed a bit nervous!  but i think that wasn't because of the patrons but actually the other waiter watching from behind  all the time.. guess he was a newby in training.. poor guy =P
Tay H.,Hyattsville  MD,0,5,3,1/17/2016,5.0,Great environment great selection of food and drinks amazing sliders and great selection of beer ...very clean and staff is very helpful and pleasant
Kristen H.,Elkridge  MD,11,10,,1/11/2016,4.0,We've been here three times now and our family loves it. The hand formed veggie burger is delicious. The fact that it's fresh not frozen is huge to me. The bun is tasty  the fries are really good too. They have cream soda on tap which is really good too. The pizookie for dessert was delicious. We've had the pumpkin  cookies and cream and now the chocolate chip. I have to say cookies and cream is my favorite. I didn't give it 5 stars because while the servers have always been friendly  they are a little slow. It's also extremely cold in there so bundle up! I can't wait to go back
Kyra M.,Bowie  MD,102,45,21,11/22/2014,4.0,Went here today on A whim and I must say I am glad I did. For an app we had the pork loaded fries. I am not a fan of this appetizer as the shoe string fries are not my favorite also the green sauce I was not a fan it was tangy and bitter not ideal.For drinks we both did the sampler of 4. Which we enjoyed but the ones you end up not wanting you are stuck with. As for the meals I got the Southern Fried Chicken which was tender juicy crisp and well seasoned. My BF got the ribeye which had fat all the way through which he is not a fan of. The desert was delicious  we ordered the 3 trials i forget the name. We got the peanut butter smores one  cookies and cream  and salted caramel. Delicious heaven  I don't typically eat desert but the waiter talked us into it and I am glad I did.Overall I will def go back. Want to try the pork chops when we go back and the alcohol root beer float.
Lawrence W.,Beltsville  MD,51,10,,10/4/2015,1.0,The waiters  servers  greeters curse among themselves in front of customers. Very unprofessional. Obviously the management doesn't care.
Sarah M.,Laurel  MD,211,74,10,11/25/2014,2.0,As a new brewery in Laurel I was excited to join. But I won't be returning here. First of all its a lawsuit waiting to happen. The floors are super slippery  it feels like you're ice skating & even the staff will admit it to you. The food is pretty pricey $25 for a pizza. (It was good.) The handicap section is notAccommodating as well  it's too tight & uncomfortable. The main reason for the such low review is the management. He did take a percentage off the bill but I wasn't complaining to get things for free. I won't be returning.
C J.,Severn  MD,2,63,15,11/25/2015,4.0,I ate lunch at the BJs Brewhouse in Laurel  MD. It was clean. The waiter was really nice and pleasant  came by several times to make sure that I was okay. I had the jambalaya. It was tasty and spicy like I like it. It has shrimp  sausage  chicken  red and green peppers with onions over rice. The food came quickly. I enjoyed this visit and would recommend this place for lunch.
Neville E.,Rockville  MD,44,7,46,8/28/2015,4.0,I went to this place on my birthday. It was kind of dark in there for my taste  but I love it anyways. The drinks and beer all were delicious . I got myself the BJ's Classic Rib-Eye it was very tasty and done the way I asked. Along with the order of the Parmesan cheese wings (they were also fantastic!) my night was awesome.
Beverly H.,Laurel  MD,86,3,,9/14/2015,3.0,Let me start out by saying that I LOVE that Laurel now has a BJ's. It's a hip  nice looking chain with good management. As one other reviewer mentioned  the vibe is cool.  I also like their happy hour options including the $5 lemondrop martinis. Their black and blue burger is the BEST in this area! When i stray past the burger  though  I sometimes get disappointed. Sometimes the other meals come out well  other times  not so much....Management is great  though  and if they give you a bad meal and you complain they will redo it for you...
Wendy W.,Laurel  MD,5,25,6,7/1/2016,5.0,My husband and I were among the many who anxiously awaited the opening of this upscale restaurant in the new Laurel shopping center. We were not disappointed - never have been. The food is very good and the service is too.
Scott W.,Washington  DC,1,17,,12/19/2015,1.0,Well not very good. Our food set under a light probably 30 to 40 minutes before we ever received it. It came out looking dry and cold the waitress asked if the manager came over and spoke with us we said no. She said she would go tell them to come back which he never did and all he did was take off one of our appetizers. Which is fine but at least come over and say something. The beer was good that was about it.
Melinda S.,Laurel  MD,41,63,114,8/10/2015,1.0,They have never gotten my burger right. I'll never go here again! They don't know what a medium burger is  all their burgers are tough and burned with no seasoning. They put every topping that I said I didn't want  on the burger  same with someone else in my party. There was some unknown object in my mayonnaise  the fries were completely COLD and the calamari was soggy and tasteless. Did I mention nothing was edible and the manager didn't even comp the meal? We waited an hour for food that they messed up twice and gave up and returned the terrible food. Only to get one or two items taken off and another one added to the bill when the manager offered it as a substitute. Umm why offer it if you're charging for it? This is the worst restaurant in laurel. Can't even make a simple burger. And for some reason they hire 10 women to stand at the hostess stand and socialize.
Michelle R.,Columbia  MD,0,27,39,6/19/2016,4.0,Nice restaurant  great for groups  a quick bite for lunch or before a movie or shopping. The sample of beer for .05 is a must. I don't drink beer but found this to be a great way to sample the many brews they offer. I like the variety of dining options including the self seating bar area. You can sit at the bar or if you don't like sitting at the bar you can self seat at one of the pub tables. There is a middle section with small booths and a eating area for larger groups. Service has always been acceptable.
Sanovia P.,Bowie  MD,1,31,9,5/30/2016,3.0,This is based off of appetizers and beer. We had the siracha dry rub and root beer wings and an order of the Brussel sprouts. The wings were okay. The Brussel sprouts were dilicious. We sampled a few beers and I had a cider from the tap. I gave it 3 stars because the service at the bar was good. We would go again if we had to wait for another movie.
Eunice C.,Columbia  MD,6,37,6,9/22/2015,3.0,I think this is a nice place to hang out with friends. I think the food tends to be on the saltier side and is not all that impressive. They have a good selection of beer and I like how the place is decorated. The staff is nice but I don't like to be called honey or dear by people who look like they're young enough to be my son.
Melanie W.,Laurel  MD,25,43,18,9/1/2015,3.0,BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse is good pretty much only for happy hour. The drink specials are great and the appetizers they have on special are awesome. However  my two experiences with going inside and being waited on by a waitress have not been good. My recommendation - stick to happy hour.
Trevelyn O.,Miami Beach  FL,154,28,26,12/29/2014,1.0,Service not good ..trust meLong wait for foodIt's pretty bad when the people who work their think it's bad .
M H.,Wiesbaden  Germany,0,7,12,9/25/2015,5.0,Being from California  my husband and I were thrilled to discover a BJ's nearby! It has great service and the food we love and have missed so much. Pizza and pizookies! The best!
Gray M.,Rockville  MD,29,81,82,8/6/2015,4.0,Food is very good. My favs are the clam chowder  any of the pizzas  sliders  strawberry lemonade  berry cider and the berry burst (cider mixed with berry lambic framboise)  and the cookies n' cream pizookie! All very good. Good prices. Decent service. I mostly use curbside pick up. The noise level can get somewhat high. OH ANS MAKE SURE TO SIGN UP FOR THE REWARDS PROGRAM...it's free!!!
Rhonda G.,Laurel  MD,0,3,2,12/12/2015,5.0,I am a regular customer. Always something different to try. Seasonal drinks are amazing! Service is mostly great. Some exceptions but it's not the norm.Try it once. You will return.
Ebony B.,Bowie  MD,9,82,5,7/30/2015,4.0,Good happy hour prices and nice and spacious. I had the club pizza..it was just ok. Too Much bacon for me but others enjoyed it. Everyone that ordered..their food looked Amazing and complimented the food. The drinks were not strong but very good flavors.
Tom D.,Burtonsville  MD,46,115,104,7/22/2015,4.0,I can't believe I am saying this  because of my desire to stay away from chain/boxed restaurants  but I like this place! So far the staff have been very helpful and friendly. The fried jalapeo burger is amazing  great mix of flavors  and spice. They have real food...My wife loves the salads. You can eat here  get good food  and even eat healthy....But please save room for the Pazookies!!! little cookie cakes that are to die for! I love the cookies and cream Pizookie  but I have tried a few others and all are amazing!!!
Maria M.,Laurel  MD,35,22,5,8/22/2015,3.0,First time ever at BJ'S! We arrived and had minimal wait time. Seated and server explain they were short staff but service was great by Danielle. Ordered variety of things: chicken wings  Brussels sprouts  calamari & thin crust pizza. Food came out quick. Calamari was excellent  chicken wings could have been crispier but still good. Pizza and Brussels sprouts were good too. Tried brew house blonde and really enjoyed considering I'm not a big beer drinker. Will come back.
Pooh l.,Savage  MD,0,19,1,12/7/2015,2.0,"Lovely set up and good food & drink options but it\'s the 2nd time I\'ve been here and it\'s freezing cold. The bathrooms are freezing and so is the bar area. No hot water in the bathroom either. There was a terrible smell (dead rat) at our table. We asked Miguel our waiter who could smell it too and the best explanation was ""maybe the manager turned the heat on & there\'s something in the vent. Or someone just walked in with the smell"". Absolutely disgusting. Ruined an otherwise lovely evening."
Rianna D.,Glen Burnie  MD,0,14,2,11/29/2014,5.0,Our deep dish was delicious! We ordered a sampler and got 12 of their hand crafted beers  liked all of them. :D our waiter was soooo friendly and the atmosphere was great. We cant wait to go back! We walked to the movie theatre after dinner and it didnt take long  great location.
Jack P.,Laurel  MD,0,4,,11/20/2015,5.0,Went on a date here and really had a good time. They have a couple deals on their website that are not advertised on the menu or elsewhere in the restaurant. It's what you would expect from an upper-middle tier Americana chain restaurant - clean  not too loud  friendly servers  interesting decor  etc. The food itself was really  really good  and while it's a little pricey  it's not over-priced; definitely glad I went  definitely looking forward to going back!
Michelle S.,Arnold  MD,0,4,1,1/25/2015,1.0,"I hate that I\'m even giving this place one star. It was our first time coming to this restaurant  and upon walking in  we were told it would be 15-20 minutes to get a table. No problem! 10 minutes in the hostess asked if we wanted the table ""over there"" (in the bar). We said  ""sure  no problem"". As we stood there  she says  "" you can go on over there"". *** This is super disappointing since we didn\'t know ""which"" table we were walking to  and there was no greeting or any kind of service at this point. Once we arrive to this table... It was dirty  and not even ready. So we go back to the hostess  and she says  ""just go over there and sit down  they will clean it for you soon"". Once we wait for THAT to happen  we sit and wait for a server to come over and get our drink orders or ANYTHING for that matter  and 10 minutes later..(no joke) he comes with a napkin and says  "" I\'ll be with you in a minute"". 15 minutes for that  10 minutes for refills and 20 minutes for the overall checkout process. For nonalcoholic drinks  appetizer and two burgers  it took 1 hour and 45 minutes. Quite disappointing. For the food aspect: Burgers were over greasy  and one was overcooked. Fries were thin type fries and floppy. The California flat bread was great (the best part of the entire visit). Overall  I will NEVER step foot in this place EVER again. Worst $45 I\'ve ever spent."
Shake N.,Bowie  MD,0,19,6,5/29/2016,1.0,I have been to this restaurant twice. Each time I had a terrible dining experience. I have worked in the restaurant industry before so mind you I'm very patient with my servers within reason. The first time I went with two friends and no one greeted us for maybe 35 minutes and we were sitting at a booth by the bar  so finally we ordered an appetizer of buffalo chicken and potato skins. They brought our food before the appetizers and the food was cold and very poor quality. But the icing on the cake was the buffalo chicken they brought out was literally tysons frozen chicken nuggets warmed up with hot sauce lightly drizzled across the top. The potato skins were freezer burned and the potato was deflated it was literally just the skin and it was burned. Needless to say we weren't please our waiter barely came to our table and our drinks from the bar took an hour and my drink was never even put in. The second time I went I went with a friend and he ordered some type of beer sampler and that came out nice but I ordered a patron margarita and the server forgot to put my drink in  and then he also barely checked on us the entire time  and my food wasn't that great I ordered a personal pizza and the cheese wasn't fully melted it was just awful. I'll never be going back here
Charlie P.,Laurel  MD,34,1,,5/26/2016,1.0,I will never return to bj's brew house in laurel or any bj's ever again. Will never never recommend this place to anyone
Joe J.,Gambrills  MD,564,246,1182,3/23/2015,4.0,If you don't mind a crowd  and a potential wait if you don't book yourself on the guest list. Then this is the place. I took my lady here for valentines day  and we had an amazing time. The only draw back is getting seated in a area with a loud large group  when you're trying to have an intimate conversation. However watching a woman order an entree and have damn near every appetizer on the menu being brought to her at the same damn time  while punishing cups/shots of alcohol was very entertaining/impressive to say the least. The food was really the highlight of the evening. I had a rack of ribs that wouldn't quit  and she ordered the jambalaya. We were both thoroughly impressed with our food  and that was especially good seeing as how it was a special night for us. I will repeat though that this place seems to stay packed  but the food and service i received was excellent. Sometimes a place is so packed because they are just good. There is a high demand for there services  and they seem to be delivering quite well. With all the people visiting here I'm sure you'll read a bad review or 2  but remember that a--holes eat out too. This is one place i will say you should judge for yourself. I may not do valentines day here again  but I'm damn sure going back! The food/Service the wait . I'm a fan.
Kai S.,Washington  DC,3,16,9,7/12/2015,5.0,I eat here at least 3 times a month. The customer service is ok i guess. No  they need work. The food is amazing though  I never had a dish I didn't like. The parmesan crusted chicken is bar far my favorite item on the menu  its a must try. The pizza is great  everything is just so good. And the salted caramel cookie with ice cream on top...OMG...I can't.....literally....
Yuwa A.,Owings Mills  MD,3,56,12,4/2/2015,5.0,I'm familiar with the Woodland Hills Location in Los Angeles. My favorite dessert is the chocolate chip pizzokie. I visited the new location in Laurel and I had an awesome time. The burger was delish! I tried the salted caramel pizzokie but I didn't like it. Oh service was great! I give this place a 5 star!!!
Angela O.,Laurel  MD,32,16,,7/1/2015,2.0,The food quality was mediocre and the food prices were too high. The service wasn't great. I was disappointed. The long island ice tea I ordered was terrible and since there wasn't a price on the menu I was shocked to see it was 10.50. Everything about this place was off.
Kafi H.,Severn  MD,25,7,,10/21/2015,2.0,The food is amazing! However  the wait staff left a lot to be desired. They were scares and when the did manage to get around to you they acted like they didn't care. The two stars were for the food. The staff just didn't want to help. The Worse and I mean the worse experience I've every had with food service and that includes McDonalds.
Ashley Z.,South Side Slopes  Pittsburgh  PA,1,4,,7/17/2015,2.0,The first few times i visited this location  i received an excellent meal with a longer than usual wait time. The last time i went was horrible service. My friends and i were told an hour wait when there were about a dozen empty tables clearly visible and no other people waiting. We chose to sit at the bar. No one approached us. We asked 3 staff members if someone would wait on us  finally the 4th did. Again  slow service and the waitress had a major attitude. Overall  the food is good and the facilities are clean. Disappointed in the service. Unfortunately there arent a lot of nice late night places to go in the Laurel area so this place will have to do
Tiffany P.,Dundalk  MD,0,3,4,10/17/2015,1.0,Tonight was my first and last time at this resturant. Latasha was my waitress poor customer service and inappropriate language. She called me baby and sweetheart  unacceptable! The food wnd atomosphere were nice but I will not pay for poor service.
Village B.,Savage  MD,0,22,,10/16/2015,3.0,Hubby and I decided to try them out for dinner one weekend. The food was good. Friendly staff. I would definitely try it again.
Sue S.,Odenton  MD,0,4,,10/15/2015,1.0,Went for the second time yesterday for dinner. Got the pulled pork. It wasn't pulled. It was hard chunks and the sauce wasn't very flavorful. I had the Cole slaw on the side and I didn't even bother to eat it; it looked awful with chunks of purple cabbage and what looked like thousand island dressing in it. The onion straws were just soggy onions with the breading coming off despite me having everything else (sauce and slaw) on the side. The shoestring fries were nice and hot at least. The draft root beer was awful - flat and dull. Last visit big had ribs that were so tough I could barely eat them. At least the draft beer made me not care so much. We'll find another place to take our work party of a dozen people elsewhere next time. This time or server was attentive which was bette than last time.
Kiona C.,Laurel  MD,31,3,,10/15/2015,5.0,My fiancee and I went for a celebratory dinner. First thing that I must mention is our server Miguel  he was fantastic! He certainly set and carried the tone of our great evening. The food was delicious and everything came to the table very fast. Now the dessert.... OMG the dessert. We had the smores peanut butter cookie and the 3 mini pazookie sampler (boy were we celebrating). Everything was too delicious for words lol. I'm thinking of the dessert as I type this! 5 Stars!
Steve E.,Laurel  MD,56,83,84,6/9/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,"My 3rd time here but first time sitting at the bar by myself. I was here to watch the NBA Finals game 3. The bartender did not have a name tag or introduced himself or maybe I didn\'t hear him. Ambience was not loud  i was able to talk on the phone with no problem. I ordered the shrimp tacos(3) with a side of nacho chips and a Brewhouse Blonde  one of my favorite beers here and it complimented the tacos well. The shrimp tacos where good and came with 2 sauces (green creamy spinach yogurt flavor and a red hot spicy flavor). Both sauces were delish on the tacos. I then realized the bar has a beer I recently was introduced to and like ""Big Wave"" from Kona  Hawaii. my tab came out to around $22-23.00. I left $30.00 because I didnt\' want to dig in my wallet for exact change and tip."
Kerri W.,Baltimore  MD,22,18,12,12/30/2014,1.0,This is one of those times I should have listened to the reviews... Granted it was quite busy for a Tuesday night but the service was atrocious and I saw enough servers and bussers around that I was expected a better experience. First off  we felt extremely rushed to order everything. It was my friend and I's first time here so we were checking out all our options. Our drinks didn't come out for a very long time  and after asking if they would be out soon they miraculously arrived leading me to believe the bar wasn't as backed up as the server stated. We ordered our appetizer first then the server came back to take out entree order. Lo and behold our entree came out before the appetizer! Which of course was then blamed on the kitchen as well. Honestly the only reason I gave this a one star was because the food was pretty good and the drinks were pretty good as well especially for the reasonable price. As for the service itself  we felt extremely rushed and if I'm going to be rushed I at least expect the product to come out quickly.. Which it did not. When our entree arrived before our appetizer we didn't even have any silverware and after asking for some  we waited for a bit then received two forks on top of a black napkin. I had already looked around and saw other customers with black napkin rolls of silverware so wondered why we did not receive the same thing. I then had to ask for a second napkin since we had only received one and also for the side of sour cream I had ordered that did not come out with the food. I also asked the food runner when he brought the food out but didn't get it then either. I was made to feel like I was being demanding but all I was asking for were items necessary for eating the meal that I shouldn't have had to ask for. And to top it all off our food and drinks were cleared while we still had a few bites and sips left but if our server bothered to ask us we would have asked for a few more minutes to finish. Then she dropped off the check without a word and without asking us if we wanted dessert. Which we had ready decided we did want and had to try and add on as our server zoomed by. Just so disappointed with our experience even though the food was good...
Genevieve D.,Elkridge  MD,0,10,,7/5/2015,5.0,I had the dessert platter  which is 3 different cookies (that are warm) with ice cream on top. The cookies were AMAZING. My fianc and I had eaten at another restaurant and had only went in for a few beers but i couldn't pass up their desserts. We both regretted not eating here. We will be going back to try their food and to have their desserts again. Their beer was decent too. We sat at the bar so the service wasn't bad  but it was really busy so I can understand other people's complaints.
Paul P.,Columbia  MD,78,18,30,11/18/2015,4.0,Beer selection was great. I had the French dip sandwich. The sandwich was a little small compared to what I was used to but for a lunch portion it was OK. I liked the shoe string french fries. Service was a little slow but server was polite and friendly.
Patricia L.,Laurel  MD,2,51,70,6/24/2015,2.0,The food is okay  nothing to rave about. Had the spinach stuffed and the Cherry Chipotle Salmon. Appetizer took 30 minutes  dinner took 55 minutes and its only Wednesday. If speed does not improve this location will not last as there is too much competition with just as good food if not better and quicker service. Waiter was friendly.
Michael S.,Laurel  MD,39,7,1,3/13/2015,4.0,Five stars from me  my boss and i went in for lunch  first time to any BJ's. It was crowded  but our server was great  refilled our drinks  explained the menu  i got the Southern Fried Chicken dish  it was amazing  freshly battered golden brown  not tough in anyway  you can tell the chicken is fresh and they change the grease as they should. The dish i got was huge and only $7.75. My boss got the personal pizza and was happy with it as well. Will surely be back.
K.J. Y.,Hyattsville  MD,2,30,2,5/5/2015,2.0,Came in for a late dinner on a weeknight. We were greeted promptly and seated pretty quickly. The restaurant seems to pride itself on its selection of beers  so if you're not a big beer drinker you might be missing out on what this place has to offer. The food itself wasn't bad tasting  but the kitchen definitely needs to work on it's prepping. I had a California Chicken Club sandwich  the avocado slices that came with my sandwich still had rind attached! The kitchen just sliced the avocado like a tomato and put it on my sandwich! Also another person in my party ordered the flatbread pizza. The entire pizza arrived unsliced and my dinner guest had to cut it herself with a knife & fork. I would give this place another chance but at the same time I'm not going out of my way to dine here again either.
Jennifer C.,Washington  DC,91,21,,3/2/2015,3.0,I went back a second time last week with my boss and a few others from office  having had a great experience the first time around. As usual the wait time was 20 - 25 minutes but we found a spot in the bar area. The service was great but unfortunately someone in our party got food poisoning from the fish. Bummer to be up for four hours throwing up. Go  but don't order the salmon.
Kisha S.,Columbia  MD,1,34,13,6/20/2015,5.0,I go here all the time with friends  took Mom and Grandma for Mother's Day and they LOVED IT this place never disappoints! From the drinks to the food to the wonderful staff it's always a great visit. Laurel really needed a place like this
J. O.,Silver Spring  MD,0,10,5,9/8/2015,4.0,Good looking bar. Large menu. Pleasant experience. Service was quick and friendly. I will definitely visit again.
Steven F.,Fort Meade  MD,15,6,,7/8/2015,5.0,Not too shabby a place. I haven't had the opportunity to sample any of the in-house brews due to going there with my family (I will not drink in front of my children)  but the food is awesome. If you're in the area and would like to try out a good place to eat  this is the place.
Duane Q.,Silver Spring  MD,2,18,1,7/6/2015,2.0,Was ok and nothing great I heard good reviews about it but food was just average first and last time eating here.
Kerri B.,Fort Meade  MD,2,51,,5/3/2015,3.0,We decided on BJ's for our 25th anniversary dinner. The service  top-notch. We had spinach topped mushrooms for an appetizer  amazing. We both ordered the rib eye steak. All I can say  is don't! Unless of course  you LOVE salt. Could not enjoy the wonderful taste of a great cut of meat because the salt was way too potent. Dessert  I believe it's called cookies and cream pizookie. YES!!! Order two!!!
Rozalino W.,Alexandria  VA,0,5,,2/26/2016,4.0,Excellent beer selection (of course). If you're a sports fan this is the place for you! Tons of tvs and great food.
Pina R.,Mount Vernon  NY,36,109,35,4/2/2015,5.0,I like this place! I was visiting for the weekend and came here for lunch I like the fact that they have a beer sampler. That was pretty good. I ordered the mahi-mahi tacos that was pretty delicious; anyhow the food and the crowd and staff are good and the service was prompt. I really like this place and will come here again next time I visit. It's in an open shopping mall.
J C.,Millersville  MD,21,29,1,8/10/2015,3.0,Food is great  pizza is yummy  kinda high compared to other restaurants  service sucks  there are a very few who actually seem like they like there job  overall ok
Cheavaun C.,Chevy Chase  Washington  DC,5,20,5,5/7/2015,5.0,Great service!! Had us seated soon as we walked in. Happy hour prices are good. Southern fried chicken was top notch!!! Will be returning.
Milton C.,Silver Spring  MD,0,2,2,12/13/2014,1.0,Worse service ever! Don't come here unless to want to wait 20 minutes to order  40 more minutrs to get your food;15 to get the check and after 10 minutes they still have my credit card and holding me hostage! No food is worth that abuse!
Gamal H.,Laurel  MD,64,10,,2/9/2015,4.0,My wife brought me back a pulled pork sandwich. It was amazing! Definitely the best I have had in this area. Famous Daves has an OK pulled pork sandwich and Red Hot & Blue has lost a step with theirs. This place has an all around great one. Big  stuffed with meat  soft bun and they got the Cole slaw right. Not runny so when I put the slaw on my sandwich and bit in  not a bunch of juice dripping out. They went with slaw chunks which gave a nice crunch when you bit in. I'm not a fries person but these were nice and seasoned. They gave the fries that resembled shoe strings  reminded me of the ones I would get at Houstons. Only reason I didn't give 5 because I got the sandwich cold by the time it reached me from wife's travel and I had to warm up in the microwave. It was really enjoyable even reheated so I would love to taste it fresh out the kitchen while dining in. I highly recommend!
Jon Z.,Laurel  MD,9,1,,7/22/2015,1.0,Horrible service waited for 20 minutes to be seated not even busy at all  this place is racial profiles white couple in front of me got seated immediately when we walking just same time.
Char W.,Laurel  MD,0,4,,9/5/2015,4.0,It has quickly become Laurel's new hotspot. I have tried a variety of food and beers. I have loved all of them. Their deep dish pizzas are very good. Their happy hour specials and beer flights prices are also worth a visit. The wait staff brings out food though  then randomly calls out of the name of the dish as they walk along their bar. You can easily grab a dish or two for free. LOL. They clearly need a better system for the bar area.
Sara L.,Silver Spring  MD,0,10,,7/21/2015,4.0,It nice place. Okay prices and good food. Staff is really nice and friendly. Only thing is that it is very dark. Hardly any light.
Katie R.,Laurel  MD,79,4,,8/31/2015,5.0,They are always so good about cooking their Gluten Free pizza! They are kind and fast! My son has never gotten sick and we go back monthly to treat him yo pizza! We love their food!
John T.,Silver Spring  MD,0,2,,12/29/2014,1.0,First time here  Slow service and ran out of burgers at 5pm on a Monday night.. How do you run out of a staple like burgers especially on a Monday night? Cancelled our entrees and asked for our check which took another 20 mins to get. Manager was apologetic but I'm leaving hungry...Big disappointment  go somewhere else.
John H.,Randallstown  MD,10,103,4,1/11/2015,4.0,"Despite being open for a few months now  I only managed to dine here on for the first time on Friday night. I had the fish and chips which were pretty good. The waiter was also able to score some cocktail sauce for me ( which is rare because most places don\'t even serve it with their fish and chips  which is beyond me!) Nice atmosphere and the crowd was pretty lively. It\'s a shame they don""t have live music here  it would be the icing on the cake. Great place check it out!"
Heather G.,Virginia Beach  VA,33,2,,3/20/2016,4.0,Had the Spinich and artichoke dip as an appetizer which was amazing. Also had the deep dish ziti which was delicious. Would definitely go back. Server was a bit slow and came back infrequently.
Isaiah E.,Laurel  MD,0,1,,1/10/2015,1.0,Terrible. The parking sucks and we waited for our RESERVED seat for a long periolodically time. The tables are nasty.
Melissa Q.,Washington  DC,20,8,3,3/14/2015,2.0,This past Friday my friends and I called ahead to reserve a spot at the restaurant. What a horrid customer service experience! It took us 30 minutes to get a table even as we called ahead. And the waitress 'Latasha' treated us in a very unfriendly way. She rushed us with the checks. My corn fritters were over cooked  and my ahi poke had two little  measly pieces of avocado. This is definitely a hit or miss experience because a couple of weekends ago  I went to the bar and had a good time with great food. Maybe this is a place to visit on a less busy night.
Elaine H.,Arnold  MD,42,88,11,2/10/2015,5.0,Went here for lunch. We had a beer flight you get to choose 4 for $6.95 the calamari was ok just a bit greasy but the clam chowder is out of this world  loaded with clams. Try it in one of their toasted bread bowls. Make a great meal!
Jason C.,Key West  FL,36,28,19,11/26/2014,4.0,Finally  something truly new and fresh in Laurel. What a great addition. Sunday went with my kids. Great and friendly service by Gabrielle. With the addition of this and Regal movies no more Arundel Mills. Went back for happy hour...Mojito's need work..Avocado Spring Rolls delicious...overall a happy customer and welcome to Laurel.
Karen F.,Elkridge  MD,4,120,,2/6/2016,4.0,Stopped here for lunch. Had the sliders  calamari and pizza/salad lunch combo. Food was good  nice portion size and prices reasonable. Service was friendly and knowledgeable. Tried the draft root beer - was excellent. Nice atmosphere - good place to hang out  have a few drinks and some apps.
Rhomm M.,Silver Spring  MD,0,3,,11/12/2014,5.0,I went in yesterday just because I wanted to try the West Coast renowned Pizookie. This was their 2nd day being opened for business. The service was great! The food was great! And the Pizookie.........WAS EVERYTHING! I ordered 1/2 Chocolate Chip & 1/2 White Chocolate Macadamia. The kitchen messed up & made 1 of each. So they gave me both at no additional charge! WINNING!!!!!!!!!
Ozzie P.,Laurel  MD,0,4,1,11/30/2014,3.0,Most of the other reviewers are correct. The food  in my opinion  is excellent. The service is lacking  bringing down the rating. Maybe I just got the newbie server. I will come back though  and hopefully  if the service then is better  I can change the rating
Melinda R.,Beltsville  MD,115,11,10,1/1/2015,5.0,The wait was LONG but I had a huge party of 20... but once we were seated we all agreed it was worth the wait. The food was delicious  reasonably priced  big portions  and a friendly waiter even sang a solo rendition of happy birthday to me upon request after I caught him singing while cleaning a nearby table! The mgr apologized for the wait and all was well!
D W.,Bowie  MD,3,36,27,1/25/2015,4.0,Good food...nice atmosphere...we live the root beer! Lots of choices for wings...the burgers are great (they are huge)! The kids menu offer lots of choices too! Try the beignets for dessert...delicious!
Prissy C.,Laurel  MD,15,18,4,12/23/2014,4.0,"Went here for dinner this past Sunday for the first time. I tried the scallops dish because I love scallops not realizing it was under it\'s""Enlighted section of menu meaning healthier options. And not only was it only 370 calories it was filling and very good."
Val W.,Washington  DC,0,2,,2/23/2015,1.0,"I came here on 2/18/15  after hearing rave reviews from friends. What a disappointment! The host was unwelcoming and unaccommodating with our seating preference (even though there was availability). Next up  our server arrives and has an accent so thick that none of us can understand anything she says. Ugh! Now to the meals - the lasagna was just ""so"". Very underwhelming. The double cheeseburgers were good and cooked to order. The ribs were overcooked and dry  but the mashed potatoes were a hit. The side of broccoli was four florets that had been blanched in water and thrown on the plate.Once was enough for me. I won\'t be back. :o("
Kristin P.,Parkville  MD,0,27,2,4/22/2015,5.0,Me and my husband and my son just went there for lunch and we will definitely be back for sure we loved the beer and food ! The dessert was amazing we had s'more with peanut butter it was amazing love love love !
Amy B.,Laurel  MD,0,16,8,2/10/2016,5.0,Love the food great drink selection. Friday's they seem to get busy but the service is pretty good. I love coming here for drinks and appetizers.
Jayme D.,Parkville  MD,50,10,20,12/6/2014,5.0,The food here is great. There is so much to choose from. The house beers are great! Hefeweizen and Oasis are my favs! I will be back!
Jodi K.,Jessup  MD,0,12,1,1/26/2015,2.0,2 stars for the atmosphere and that's it! I've gone twice and both times they completely screwed up my order. The first time I had to wait 40 minutes just to tell them my med rare steak was med well! I'm not a fan. For just opening  they need to get it together!
Trina B.,Laurel  MD,0,4,,12/15/2014,2.0,Called ahead for seating at 4:30. Arrived at 4:15. Didn't get seated until almost 5pm. I was furious and management didn't seam to care. The Hostess had a terrible attitude which is not good for customer service. The food was just okay after all that. Will not be dining here again.
Lisa B.,Beltsville  MD,51,7,4,3/1/2015,5.0,Love love this place. Its our weekly lunch spot. The ribs are awesome. The jambalaya is wonderful. Great atmosphere and the bar attendant (blonde hair) is wonderful.
Barbara R.,Laurel  MD,6,13,1,2/28/2015,3.0,Very slow  not enough staff  didn't like the mani tacos  the salmon was good  drinks were great 
Stacey H.,Washington  DC,0,2,,1/16/2016,2.0,I love the drinks here!!!. However the food........... Should be taken off the menu. I have come here a few times  hoping it would get better with time. Yeah  didn't happen. The food is either over cooked or just...off. The pizza is terrible  and the burgers are.....for lack of a better word  undesirable. I would recommend this place for drinks anytime  just eat somewhere else before you come.
Shelley R.,Hanover  MD,2,10,2,12/20/2014,4.0,Really good food  great beer selection. Our server  Ryan was awesome. Made awesome selections and recommendations for us. It was busy when we came  but he made us feel like we were his only table. The food runner was less than pleasant though. He basically threw the plates on the table. And when we asked if he could clear the couple of empty plates  he rolled his eyes  huffed and snatched the plates from my hands. He was probably having a bad day. Other than him  I had a great experience.
Donna M.,Laurel  MD,24,9,2,11/30/2014,4.0,"I LOVE this place don\'t get me wrong with ALL the televisions on SPORTS imagine my surprise when within 2 weeks of them being open I was there eating and having a gr8 time watching a game and I cheered loudly when Mark Schwartz one of the mgr on duty came and told me to keep it down because ""this is a family restaurant"" ...........really??!!!  BREWHOUSE???!!!! so while I was completely embarrassed and turned off I vowed never to go back but I will...why?? I want to be there on a Ravens Sunday and if I hear ONE person cheer they better get checked too! OAN Mr. Schwartz learn some tack on how to tell someone to be quiet in a bar!"
K. T.,Baltimore  MD,24,14,1,10/19/2015,1.0,I had the most disappointing meal I have had in a long time after waiting outside in the cold for my order for an extra 20 minutes for curbside AND tipping for the privilege. The tacos literally had two slivers of fish the size of nickels and three of the smallest shrimp I have ever seen in my life. I asked for cheese and sour cream on the baked potato and paid for it but got neither. I feel totally ripped off and won't be ordering from there again.
Clyde M.,Beltsville  MD,0,21,,9/17/2015,4.0,Super service  menu is limited. I had the jambalaya  the best I had in this area  but it doesn't beat Louisiana's.
Amirrah P.,Laurel  MD,156,2,1,9/11/2015,5.0,"Amazing!!!! I have only been there one and I loved it. The vibe was great  the food was great  and the house brewed beers are great. As someone who is only a occasional beer drinker I enjoyed their house brewed stout very much. Will be making this my ""let\'s grab a drink"" place."
Patricia J.,Washington  DC,4,42,33,1/26/2015,4.0,First visit  was great stop. I had the jambalaya which was perfect  presentation was also nice. The service was great. Low lights  overly eager guys walking around stalking for dirty dishes was annoying. My service was great.
Jo W.,Ellicott City  MD,0,23,,12/7/2015,4.0,Good food. We had excellent service on the last visit. Busy place but pleasant atmosphere.
Madeleine F.,Jacksonville  AR,1,12,,8/7/2015,4.0,We love BJs  but we only go and sit in the bar area. The service isn't that good anywhere else in the place. They have a great happy hour menu and the drinks are reasonably priced. In the fall  be sure to get their pumpkin beer. It is amazing!!
John D.,Laurel  MD,0,14,,10/20/2015,2.0,The food is decent  the drinks are usually great. But timing is off. I think the kitchen staff is asleep. I like to go but it can never be a quick bite. I need to make it an event. Step it up guys  you have a great location and the product is outstanding. Are there managers working to oversee the operation?
J. M.,Washington  DC,0,41,,1/6/2015,2.0,"Came in on a whim looking for dinner. It was a Tuesday night and they were pretty busy. Most of the tables had someone at them. It apparently was half-priced wine night. They have about 30 national as well as craft beers on tap. They also have 11 house beers on tap that BJ\'s allegedly brews  uh  somewhere  but not here apparently. Food arrived in a relatively timely manner. I tried the carnitas fries which were served in a deep mini pizza dish. The fries were okay on top  but got way too soggy on the bottom. I got a small 9"" pizza which was warm  not hot  and some of the cheese looked like it was just starting to melt. The pizza is deep dish  which I usually like  and it is similar but not as good as Pizzeria Uno\'s  in my personal opinion. The service was okay. At first they were checking on me too much  then when I wanted to pay my bill  I had to wait. Overall  the prices for the quality of food they serve are a little too high. For 1 soda  1 beer  1 appetizer and a rather small pizza it was almost $40 with tip for one person. I give them a ""Meh.""  and can\'t say that I would come back..."
Brent P.,Laurel  MD,0,13,3,9/26/2015,5.0,My favorite dish is the Mahi Mahi. Cooked perfectly with the pineapple fried rice which is unique w/ carmelized pineapple chunks with rice  onions and a few sprigs of cabbage I believe. The Pizookie is a delicious dessert... sampler or all one flavor on a warm pie cooked cookie. Yes  drinks are a smidge pricey but the staff are great and environment is good also  not your average chain restaurant.
IslandQueen 1.,Columbia  MD,0,3,,9/14/2015,1.0,Ribs to salty - sent back. Replacement steak also too salty and this time cheddar mash potatoes saltier too. Uncomfortable wait times for initial service and replacement meal. I had finished my meal and ordered a second round of mushroom caps while waiting for my date to finally be able to eat. While manager was actively canvasing for customer feedback  he was ineffective in mitigating the situation - no discount or extras offered for salty food and excessive wait time. While the drinks were tasty and decor pleasant  the temp was uncomfortably cold. Overall impression  we won't be returning.
Jack K.,West McLean  VA,0,514,,5/19/2015,4.0,Very nice experience. I liked my cheeseburger--large  well-prepared and fresh ingredients. I order the fried artichokes on a total whim (I am not an artichoke guy). These were awesome  slightly addictive. Our server was very nice and attentive.
Pat H.,Laurel  MD,0,9,,8/19/2015,4.0,Great food and service! Definitely a place to visit even though service can be a little slow sometimes  however  the food is worth the wait.
K B.,Bowie  MD,0,41,4,7/25/2015,4.0,Good food  service and atmosphere. Pricing is average and as expected. Large menu and selection of food and beer. It was busy when we came late on a Saturday night  but only waited 5 min to be seated. Our server was friendly and attentive. We had the mahi mahi tacos and Hawaiian mahi mahi and both were very good.
Marcel N.,Chantilly  VA,0,3,,12/18/2015,2.0,I came here a few times after they opened for HAPPY HOUR and found it to be appropriately priced for a relatively good quality of bar food. Nothing special but not bad and also affordable. Half price wings  sliders  flat bread s  etc. $4 drafts. Happy Hour...right? As another reviewer commented here  the happy hour specials are terrible now...an absolute joke. You only save $1 off of $7 beers and $2 off of a $12 serving of appetizer wings. There is nothing HAPPY about that. Other appetizers are now priced in the same $12 range...and you get to save a meager $2 for Happy Hour. Appetizers used to be half off and were priced at around $9. You could get a plate of wings and a draft beer for about $10...Now  you better plan on $20. You actually pay more now at Happy Hour than the original full price. You now pay $9.25 for happy hour wings that used to be $9 at FULL PRICE and $4.50 at happy hour. I will take my business to one of the local establishments that isn't intent on gouging people at Happy Hour. I mean  really...who goes to Happy Hour to pay $18 for three draft beers? Took my wife there for Happy Hour and was very disappointed when the check came...don't go here expecting to save money at Happy Hour. We saved $8 on a $60 check. On top of it all  the service is very slow. There is only one bartender on duty at Happy Hour responsible for the entire bar area in addition to making drinks for the restaurant. Management has certainly found a way to increase their profit margins...one bartender and inflated prices. TGI Fridays  Applebees or even Famous Daves offer a much more affordable happy hour. If you do make the mistake of heading here for Happy Hour...be sure to bring plenty of patience and cash. You have been warned.
erwin g.,College Park  MD,44,1,,4/5/2015,1.0,nice looking building and setup... service is not good. even for not so busy hour. waitress forgot half our order and did not check on us. did not bring my water after I kindly asked her for it 4 times. not happy and will never come back.
Gagandeep K.,Sacramento  CA,76,15,15,11/29/2014,3.0,I'm from California  so when I heard that there was a bjs restaurant opening nearby  I was thrilled to go there. I've been going to BJS for the past 7 years so I know what to expect. My visit there yesterday 11-28-14 for lunch with my husband was Ok. It could've been better. The prices for some reason we're higher then cali. Also the menu was different. For appetizer  I ordered shrimp thai lettuce wraps and they were delicious. My husband ordered a small Mediterranean pizza and enjoyed it. I ordered lunch size pasta which on the menu was $8.95 (it was 8 something) but was charged 13+ for it. Their reason was because I ordered shrimp instead of chicken. I wish I was informed prior to ordering that 8 small shrimps on my pasta would've been $5 extra. And when you can count your meat  it's not good. I was not very happy with that. Our server apologized and that's about it. Overall service was good. Our food came out on time. Prices are high here so be prepared.
Joelyne K.,Laurel  MD,30,119,18,1/2/2015,1.0,"My husband and I have been there a handful of times and have tried to give them the benefit of the doubt because they are a new location. Unfortunately  each time has been the same and we actually take tally now of how many times we think they will mess up our order(s)  before we arrive. For one  they are extremely slow. They do not refill your drinks unless you ask and no matter what you order  don\'t expect them to get it right. I wish I was exaggerating but I am not. It is truly a shame because their food is very good and they are going to loose business over this. While their food is good  they are very stingy on the vegetable toppings on pizza and pastas. If you ask for mushrooms  I literally think they count 3-4 of them and throw them on your plate  just to say they gave you extra. Then they charge you $2.00 for the extra toppings. It is ridiculous. Same goes for other vegetables. They are very skimpy on pasta portions as well. The service is horrendous. After eating our meals  we sat at our table for 30 minutes before the server came back and then asked  ""oh would you like your check""? As if we wanted to be there the entire night! Plain and simple  they have great food but service sucks! Be warned."
C. J.,Norman  OK,0,16,,5/3/2015,5.0,Michael was my server and he did a great job. He was upbeat  funny  and very helpful. The happy hour options are not all that great  but great customer service made it worth the visit.
Jason J.,Laurel  MD,0,6,,4/27/2015,2.0,if only you knew how terrible their dish washing operation.(or at least was a few months ago) this is the only reason i don't go there  and i liked the food. but that's how serious it is
Rene M.,Laurel  MD,3,22,13,2/21/2015,5.0,great place to go the service is fast and friendly and the food and beers selections are great i really enjoy my self
Lisa M.,Beltsville  MD,80,21,,2/20/2015,2.0,First there  and no rush to return. My waitress wasn't really friendly either was the hostess. Not to impressed with this place...
Martha A.,Georgetown  Washington  DC,14,4,1,1/17/2015,1.0,Bad service!!! I got better attention at the bar then at a table!!! Food was reheated took forever to get glass of water!!!! Needs improvement!!!!
Chance H.,Linthicum Heights  MD,0,3,,1/13/2015,2.0,The manager was not helpful. We received a free entree but was told that because we did not purchase a steak that the entrees we ordered did not qualify. We will make our point with corporate. Then I asked about purchasing a growler and was told that because of Maryland they cannot sell growlers of beer. This is ridiculous because every other brew pub i.e. DuClaw and Pub Dog sell growlers. This is ridiculous. At least the waiter was good.
Kay J.,Laurel  MD,0,3,,12/12/2014,3.0,Food is pretty good but their call ahead service is useless. You are still waiting just as if you walked in. We called ahead on a friday night at 6:50pm and still wasn't seated until 8pm....go during the week
Brad C.,College Park  MD,0,4,,11/28/2014,5.0,Excellent food. Lindsay was great. Very knowledgeable of the menu and super friendly.
Bryan K.,Silver Spring  MD,0,1,,11/22/2014,3.0,A lot of beers on tap. Home brews are decent. I would recommend getting a flight (sample of 4). Their IPA and Stout were good. Had a burger that was greasy and lacked any real flavor. This is a new place and they're working on a lot of kinks which affects the customer service  but the staff works hard and tried to accommodate as best they can. I sat at the bar and they seemed overwhelmed mostly because things are new and there are bound to be issues. I'd give this place a shot again
J S.,Laurel  MD,0,6,,12/8/2014,1.0,"I have been to other BJ\'s Restaurant and Brewhouse locations before  so I was eager to check this new one out. WORST. IDEA. EVER. I would have given it zero stars  if possible. My date and I went to celebrate a major life accomplishment and were hoping for a special evening--it was ""special "" all right. First  they messed up a very straight forward drink order. After we had placed our order  the waitress came by to tell us that both different cuts of meat we had ordered were sold out. That is *somewhat* understandable  but that is the kind of thing of which you inform someone BEFORE handing them a menu and letting them set their heart upon it. A salad came with additional ingredients that were not mentioned in its menu description that were disgusting  and  had they been mentioned would have prevented it from being ordered. Furthermore  our waitress was slow  inattentive  and inefficient. When she finally got around to bringing the check (which we had to ask her for four times)  it was wrong. We spent about 45 minutes there unnecessarily. Go to this restaurant if you\'re looking for a long night of frustration  subpar service  and second- or third-choice menu items."
