Lolita M.,Manhattan  NY,275,109,636,10/31/2017,4.0,I really like this place. It's great to watch the game whether you're seated at a table or at the bar and it's got outside seating. The food is delicious and the servers are very gracious and professional. The portions entree portions generous and I really enjoyed the wings. The menu is extensive and can be a bit overwhelming but once you order  everything is promptly delivered.Definitely great for parties  family dinner night  catching up or catching a game. Highly recommended.
Liz L.,West Nyack  NY,135,17,2,9/18/2017,5.0,One of my absolute favorite restaurants!Wide variety selection on the menu  good prices & amazing food! Make sure to ask for Kevin when coming here !!!!!Being our server  he was very attentive  polite & detailed to our needs. He has now become the bartender & is just as good! If not better. He makes our experience worthwhile!
Marcin G.,Queens  NY,34,87,301,8/16/2017,5.0,First time at BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse and what a great experience it was! The restaurant is really nicely designed  with cool chandeliers and wall art all over the place. The seating is spaced out so you're not sitting next to someone and it can be pretty intimate for your date  family night or corporate lunch. The service was phenomenal. Jennie was our server and she was so awesome. Explained all the menu items to us  went over the daily specials and recommended some drinks. Checked in on us several times to make sure we were good. The food - simply amazing. I had the Gourmet Five Meat pie and it was so very good. It was a decent deep dish pizza  that was so well seasoned and cooked to perfection. An overall amazing experience  can't wait to come back soon!
Claudia B.,Manhattan  NY,493,82,97,8/8/2017,5.0,2nd time eating food from BJ's  1st time eating at the restaurant in Nanuet. Very good experience and the food is consistently delicious. It's a blend of uniqueness  healthy  and variety. Love love the seared tuna salad  soup salad combo (tomato /mozzarella salad is delicious)  Alfredo is fresh and tasty  avocado egg rolls and chicken pot stickers.The sample tasters is a refreshing option for you if you want to sample the menu. The chicken Mediterranean tacos are so tasty.
Andrew L.,Fort Lee  NJ,42,103,132,2/1/2017,3.0,Came on a moderately quiet weeknight where the wait wasn't very long for two. Yet the service was inexplicably slow. We wanted to give this slightly more established location a chance after having a pretty average experience at the new Teterboro  NJ opening. The experience was different but the end result was similar.Refills were hard to come by  let alone attention from the server. Food wasn't hot but would've been delicious if it was. I can definitely sense the potential of the place and think it can really hit that 4 star mark if they stepped up their service a bit. It took so long to get in & out.But the best part of the night was the pizookie. The pizookie I had at the other BJ's was no good and the server chalked it up to it somehow being my fault. But this one was much better and now I definitely want to order another! I got the cookies & cream variant and the cookie was delicious. There was a perfect ratio of cookie to ice cream this time too! Could've done without the mousse on top. But this dessert truly was the restaurant's saving grace!
Anne A.,Pomona  NY,0,11,4,9/22/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,This is my first time going here. I went with my mother and my sister for the lunch special 11-3. I ordered the Meat Lovers Piadina with sweet potato fries. The food presentation was very nice and arrived hot. For dessert  we ordered the Churro Pizookie. We devoured it and was so yummy. Would definitely go again
DJ S.,New Hyde Park  NY,126,65,6,11/13/2017,4.0,Cool chain bar. The beer selection is expansive and they recommend what beers pair with what foods in the menu. The place is very large and the service is very quick. Food was flavorful but didn't have anything unique. Safe spot if you need a place to go with solid options.
Dasle K.,New York  NY,540,244,1328,9/7/2016,5.0,This place is the best. As good as happy hour can get! From Mon - Fri 3-7pm  they have $2 off appetizers  $1 off wine by the glass  beer  and cocktails and 1/2 mini deep dish pizzas. Plus  if you download the app  you get a free mini pizookie too. DO IT. You can earn rewards towards future visits  and I promise there will be lots of those. Having visited BJ's in San Francisco  I had high expectations for this place and was worried that it wouldn't be as good as its CA location. I was pleasantly surprised that the NY location was just as good - if not better! The restaurant is HUGE and the menu is pages and pages of yummy goodness. Loads of beers on tap  and the homemade cherry soda was amazing!!! We started with the Sriracha Dry Rub Wings and Sriracha Brussel Sprouts. OMG both were SOOOOO good. Definitely my favorites  and they didn't overkill the flavor. We got the mini deep dish Spicy Hawaiian pizza (1/2 off!) but this was just OK. The White Chocolate Macademia Nut Pizookie was TO DIE FOR. What a way to end a meal. The ice cream is just normal vanilla ice cream  but that cookie melted in a pan will warm your heart & make your taste buds go crazy.Overall  absolutely loved our visit to BJ's. Can't wait to be back to try everything else on the menu!!!
Jason P.,Bronx  NY,181,399,3256,7/8/2017,2.0,"I rarely write reviews under 3 stars unless I feel a strong need to advise others of the sub-par experience.I went to this BJs and had a great experience a few years back. I returned again last night and it was far from great.We called ahead the day before for a party of 7. We arrived about 15 minutes prior to our reservation (call ahead) time and were told that the reservation had not been ________ and that we would have to wait. This was not bad  as we got a table in about 15 minutes or so  which is great in my opinion for a party of 7 on a Friday night. Though I think because they had _____ our reservation (call ahead) they gave us priority which was nice.Our server was great at first quickly getting us our drinks and taking our orders....then...it started. The server took our order of 1 child\'s pizza  3 burgers  1 chicken sandwich  a ziti bowl and jamabalaya dish at 8:45 PM. So we waited...and about 9:10ish we were told by our server that it was ""coming up in a minute"". At 9:35 we were told that it will be ""out in 30 seconds""....we got our food at 9:45!! An hour wait for mostly sandwiches and pasta dishes?!!?! while what seemed to be the entire restaurant who came in well after us had eaten and left. Now the wait is annoying in itself but as a business there are ways to go about addressing it. An honest server is one who can tell the customers of the delay and the ACTUAL estimated food arrival time. A manager is another as any good manager would have come over to us and explained the delay and offered some sort of appetizer ""on the house"". The food itself was good  when it finally arrived  but at the point everyone at the table was a bit moody at the situation. Everyone ate about half their food and was ready to go. It still took some time to get the bill  pay it and some bags for our food containers would have been nice we never had the change to ask as our server disappeared after leaving the bill. Just an overall bad experience at a place that I like and wanted to continue to like. Their food is good  it just doesn\'t compensate for that kind of service."
Blain B.,Suffern  NY,148,25,19,7/30/2017,4.0,What saves this place from a 3 star rating is it's amazing outdoor bar! It's so comfortable and the parking is great. Food is average. It's a chain! But  the amazing staff  beer selection  ample parking and atmosphere are above average. Try the brew house blonde! It's refreshing for summer! Their beer rocks  and the food will hold you over. It's a great spot in the shops at nanuet.
Ellen T.,Edgewater  NJ,1,5,,10/6/2017,5.0,Great food and beer selection! Had the Mediterranean tacos and cherry chipotle boneless wings. Both had great flavor profiles and are recommended. No hesitation to come back!
Kerry M.,Oakland  NJ,0,3,,10/1/2017,2.0,Food is good  atmosphere good  but service is SLOW!! Waited to order  waited to get food (more than 1/2hr) for a burger and salad! Server said they sent some people home  and then to top it off. Waited ANOTHER 1/2hr for coffee and ice cream for kids! Ridiculous! Will not be coming back
Keturah E.,Richmond  VA,14,82,137,7/28/2016,5.0,"We visited on a Thursday night and despite being quite busy there was still not a wait time. The menu is quite extensive and allowed for many options to choose from. We started with the Calamari and ordered drinks. Both were a good choices. The Calamari was seasoned well and looked just like SQUID. Tentacles and all. My coworker said her drink tasted just like juice  I thought it was a good combination of ingredients. I ordered the Classic California personal sized pizza and it was very tasty  but I would have added more cheese and sauce. Even though the dough was a perfect texture  there was not a great balance of toppings and dough. My coworker ordered the Deep Dish Ravioli. She shared that it was ""quite delicious"" and had a good balance of cheese  pasta  and sauce. The beignet with strawberries  ice cream  and whipped cream was ok and I probably wouldn\'t order it again. I did not like the texture or flavor of the dough. I tried my coworker\'s Chocolate Chunk Pizooki and it was DELICIOUS! I removed the beignet and added some of her Pizooki and that was a fabulous mix of flavors! Overall I would come back here and would be brave and try some different dishes."
Nora A.,Portland  ME,68,149,472,1/5/2017,3.0,I have ordered and picked up food from here many times but never dined in. We had the jambalaya but it very salty  I had to add extra rice to compensate. The best thing is chicken tenders and fries. Even the sale was salty.
Burke B.,Saddle River  NJ,64,15,1,9/4/2017,5.0,After catching a movie  my husband and I were famished. We had wanted to try this restaurant  but did not always come to the Shops at Nanuet with an appetite. After a short wait  we were seated and greeted by a pleasant and attentive server. The menu is full of many yummy options  including the calorie count. I ordered the Peruvian quinoa bowl with a side salad and my husband got the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. Both were fantastic choices. In fact  I left with enough for a second meal. For dessert my husband tried the pizookie  and once again we were not disappointed. When we were ready to pay  my husband used the app. A great idea!! We look forward to returning in the near future.
Marie U.,Monsey  NY,0,10,5,8/31/2017,3.0,It's a cool place  they make an OK pizza  but for some reason we haven't felt too welcome there. A few times we had to wait for the host for over 5 mins! Even though other waiters passing by have seen us. But no one said a word to us. I don't want to give this place a totally bad review  but I personally do not feel excited when someone suggests me going there  so I usually suggest some other places I enjoy and feel special at.
Grace R.,Mahwah  NJ,0,16,11,8/5/2017,1.0,I can't review the food since I never got the opportunity to eat. My husband and I went here to have a nice dinner since we had never eaten there before. The young gentleman who seated us was friendly. We waited 15 minutes and not a single wait staff approached our table. I got up to ask the host if there would be someone coming to take ANY order from us. I was met with a simple nod of yes. No words exchanged. Proceeded to wait another five minutes more....nobody came. We walked out. Even the couple that sat in our section next to us turned to complain that no one had taken their order. Very disappointed...will not return.
Heather B.,Tuxedo Park  NY,163,160,45,10/12/2016,5.0,This place is awesome. Went here for the first time about a year ago and have gone many times since. It's slightly overpriced for what it is  but the atmosphere is nice and the food tastes good.I love trying all the beers they make themselves and they are super nice about letting you try a taste before ordering. My favorite is the seasonal pumpkin beer!Whenever my boyfriend and I come we have to get the mozzarella sticks. You get so many and they are some of the best you can get. The avocado rolls are also a good app to get.For my meal  I typically get a mini vegetable deep dish pizza. It's surprisingly very filling and I always have leftovers for lunch the next day. Over the summer they had this watermelon feta salad which was also on point.Also worth mentioning: the service is always wonderful. I don't typically like chain places  but I love this place and cannot recommend enough!
Stephanie M.,Saddle Brook  NJ,259,24,5,5/6/2017,4.0,BJ's brew house is . This location in Nanuet I have now been to three times  and have had a great experience all three times. First time I sat at the bar and had dinner and drinks with my boyfriend. The food was amazing. The beer was good. If you like craft beer check this place out ASAP. The bartender  Jim  was so personable and friendly  but still gave us our privacy to have dinner. Allowed us to experience trying some of the beer before going with something new. I always appreciate a bar-tender that is looking to bring a better experience to guests.The ambiance of this place is upscale rustic. There is outdoor seating too! Heaters  and is open concept indoor outdoor bar in a little part of the patio which is a real cool touch. There are TV's indoor and outdoor  it is a mini brewery after all!Price is moderate with a wide variety of choices on the menu from $5 items to $25 items. Drinks are fairly priced too.I am not a huge fan of chain establishments but BJ's Brew House is not quite a chain and definitely still obtains an authentic feel. The only reason BJ's Brew House earns 4 stars is clear! Great place. It falls short of the 5th start for only two small reasons; so good that you're always busy and there's always a wait  and because the vegan offerings are limited on the menu.I had the Cauliflower tacos and they were DELICIOUS. However  it was one of only about 5 options on the entire menu of 40 plus items. My suggestion to management is to definitely expand on that  or in the menu clearly state for it to be easy option separate meat from vegetarian. The price difference is why offering an actual vegan option is probably easier for everyone.Download the App if you want to get on the line before actually arriving. You shouldn't last minute decide to go here at dinner time if you do not want to wait on a line! However  good things are worth the wait!I checked out BJ's BrewHouse in Teterboro  I will be writing a review on that location next!
Jay C.,Valley Cottage  NY,0,7,1,4/1/2017,2.0,Poor service. Wait for no reason. There we're a lot of empty seats  open tables  but unbussed  no one service seemed to very motivated to service. A lot of uncleared tables. Food is pretty good. I personally don't like think it's worth the long wait. Be prepared to wait for no reason.
Rob D.,Wayne  NJ,1541,279,761,8/20/2016,5.0,Been here a bunch of times. My review is for the bar. Lu is a fantastic bartender. All of them are but he makes this place tick. They have a great selection of tap beers if thats your thing. They sell their own brews and you can get it bottled in all sorts of sizes to go. My friends say the food is good as well. Definitely worth a try if your in the area.
Gabriella P.,Blauvelt  NY,0,2,,8/21/2017,5.0,I've been here a few times with my friends. I had the chicken club sandwich which is incredible and the cookies and cream cookie  which was also amazing. One time a waiter was rude to me about what I was ordering and I saw him push a toddler in the aisle. Other than this man  this place is 5/5 would recommend.
John V.,Hatfield  PA,32,31,1,4/16/2017,4.0,Food was pretty good for a chain. We did call ahead reservations which cut the time before airing considerably. While we were waiting people came out and offered complimentary appetizers which was a nice touch. The menu kind of reminded me of a Cheesecake Factory  lots of options. We started out with the avocado egg rolls. They tasted okay  but not as good as the Cheesecake Factory. I had the Burger which was tasty. Others had the fish tacos and deep dish pizza. All tasted good. Decent selection of unique beers. I had the Omnegong Hennepin. If you're looking for a decent chain restaurant  this is a good spot.
Gianluca T.,Congers  NY,12,7,3,8/19/2017,1.0,Not a fan. My friends had an incident there a few days ago and they comped our entire meal because of it. Hair & plastic in the chix sala
Lisa L.,Uxbridge  MA,192,3,2,4/14/2017,4.0,Pretty good food and okay service. There are a lot of different kinds of beer on tap  which were tasty. The atmosphere was social and clean. We had the avocado burger and supreme deep dish pizza and they were okay with taste. Service could be slow because they are busy  but they were friendly. The alcohol was the best part. There was a lot of selection and both beverages we tried were good. We had the Lindemans Framboise (tart fruity beer) and Taronka Stout (smooth darker beer). We would go back and try the Happy Hour!
Erin G.,College Park  GA,0,2,1,8/6/2017,1.0,My husband just picked up a takeout order which included a small spicy Hawaiian chicken pizza for me. When he got home  and I opened my pizza  there was no bacon and no tomatoes on the pizza. NONE. Not one piece of either. I am very disappointed with my pizza. There should be better quality control in the food that is being served from this restaurant. For the price of their pizzas  I expect it to be much better.
Michael L.,Waldwick  NJ,48,356,129,1/10/2017,4.0,"4 stars  ""I\'m a fan."" Think AppleBees meets Disney Springs and you might get the atmosphere that makes BJ\'s Brew House the family friendly sports bar and grille so inviting to patron.I\'m no fan of their pizzas  which is supposively one of their signature highlights. I focus more on the other aspect  the craft beers. Both their house brews and craft beers they carry give you draft offerings for every occasion. Want to take a growler of a house brew home? They can do that. They cannot accommodate for the other beers they carry  so be sure to drink your fill.Their award winning ribs are juicy and flavorful for a bar grille  please do not compare to a specialty BBQ place  but they are good. The ribeye is not to disappoint and the sides can be filling. Skip the spaghettini and meatball. The pasta alls well be soup noodles  with a Cheyenne Pepper Tomato Sauce. The burgers are a decent bite  as well as the salmon offerings.Moving on to dessert  I can hardly resist the Pizookie  particularly the white chocolate macadamian nut version. Oh  so good  but don\'t calorie count or you may find it doubled your meal placing inches around your gut.The kids will be glad to know of good in-house wifi  as well as internet provider wifi are also in range. Kid garlic knots and mixed fruit are offered at no charge. Complimentary crayons and coloring activity page are part of the service. A family bathroom is also on site. The kitchen theater window is a hit with the kids should you request a booth at the rear of the restaurant.Wait times can vary  being 25 min to 40 on the weekend peak dinner times to immediate seating on weekdays. Oh yes  they are open on many holidays including New Year\'s Day."
Katrina D.,Lodi  NJ,198,82,61,1/22/2017,4.0,Yknow I don't like other food on the menu. I tried their dessert too. Not good! BUT! Keyword: BUT! The pizza is amazing. Craving pizza? Go here. Get drunk and eat pizza.
Yasir A.,West Haverstraw  NY,0,1,,10/6/2017,2.0,"First time walking coming to bjs. At the door  on my way in  a group was walking out speaking amongst each other talking about how horrible it was  and they won\'t be coming back. I still decided to have lunch here  everyone has their own opinions; now when u sat down. A server next to the table was talking to another co worker about how they don\'t think its worth working there.. This was all before the food even coming out.. Management  some before shift ""battle plan"" might eliminate that.."
S S.,New City  NY,0,1,,10/21/2017,1.0,We waited 45 minutes and the girl that she couldn't find my name in the computer . She continued to seat people although she said we were next. The meal was awful . My prime rib dip had almost no meat on it and had fat on it . My friends pulled pork dip was crispy and hard to eat  My mashed potatoes were like concrete. For 45 dollars I could have gone to a better restaurant. Very disappointed.
Allen S.,Old Tappan  NJ,2,7,,8/6/2017,2.0,Food was good couldn't enjoy because service staff was so slow we weren't given utensils to eat with till late waitress acted like we were bothering her no intention of going back
Brad V.,Wyckoff  NJ,73,133,9,1/23/2017,3.0,An extremely average place. Nothing was really bad but nothing was really good. The wings were probably the best thing we had  The Siracha dry rub was actually quite good.The fish tacos - 2.0Salad - 3.0Service - 3.0Wings - 4.0
Johnny G.,Hoboken  NJ,135,121,31,6/13/2017,4.0,Great hangout spot for games  hangouts  get togethers! Great IPA menu. I highly recommend brisket and bacon burger and it was awesome.
Matt W.,New City  NY,0,18,,9/11/2017,1.0,Just a truly terrible experience. Came here on a Saturday night and after a short wait we ordered wings as an app. They came out ice cold. Server said hot ones would be right out and that took about 25 minutes. Onto the main course...I had a sandwich with a baked potato. Potato was cold too. My dad ordered a burger with all the toppings on the side and they forgot all the toppings and that again took forever to be given. Food was not very good either. I contacted the restaurant from their website and never heard back.
Leila T.,Nanuet  NY,2,23,43,10/1/2016,3.0,Disappointing.I was excited to try this place because it seemed similar to the Yard House in Nyack/Yonkers. Let me tell you  it's not even close. Really this place is more like a TGIF or a Chili's. And while it may have a slightly upscale atmosphere  the food just doesn't line up. We got the appetizer combo with chicken wings  spinach dip  mozzarella sticks  and avocado spring rolls. Everything was greasy. Spinach dip was obviously microwaved. Chicken wings were more breading than chicken.The menu is super disorganized and has way too much variety yet not enough depth. Pizzas  sandwiches  pastas  burgers....with only a few choices in each category. We didn't necessarily have a bad time  but we certainly won't be going back. There are better restaurants in the neighborhood where I'd rather spend my money.
Kimiyo M.,Tomkins Cove  NY,30,22,9,5/4/2017,5.0,Variety of food (surprisingly quite a bit of seafood)  decent price  good service and clean tables. The desert (ice cream with cookies) was way too sweet but that's my taste. I'll go back again for more.
Emily M.,Nanuet  NY,0,3,,5/24/2017,5.0,The family go to. Service is best in town. Perfect location right in the Shops at Nanuet. The Tuscan Tomato Bisque in a bread bowl is to die for!! Their homemade root beer is like no other. I DEFINITELY recommend you check out BJ's!!!
Annetta R.,Mount Vernon  NY,0,59,55,5/30/2017,3.0,I went to this restaurant on the recommendation of a friend. When I heard BJ's I thought they were talking about the warehouse. I ordered the jalapeo burger which was delicious. I also downloaded the app as instructed by the hostess to receive the free Poozookie dessert it was delicious as well. My friends ordered Salmon and Jambalaya which they enjoyed. All in all I would recommend this restaurant and I will definitely go back again.
Elizabeth C.,Hawthorne  NJ,18,6,4,3/12/2017,1.0,I am here At the Resturant made a reservation at 4:50 and it is 6:30 and we are yet to be seated I understand we are a party of 15 but they said are table would be ready at 6. Should not give a estimate that is by far inaccurate. They have 15 of us standing in the way! I am also with a child and a pregnant mother! They have not offer a chair. The food is good but the service not so much.
Service S.,Cliffside Park  NJ,0,24,13,8/19/2016,5.0,It not that good in the beginning from the front desk service organize but the waiter solved the problem. I gave the food 3.5 but the waiter made it all great.. You got five from us...Sam the man:)
Maureen S.,Thiells  NY,2,5,2,5/7/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Went to BJ's Friday for cinco de mayo with my husband. The place was busy but we got a seat at the bar almost right away. The bartender was friendly and we had our drinks pretty quickly. We decided to have the mahi tacos. I was very disappointed in them. There was very little flavor. Between the fish  and everything thing on them I can't believe how little flavor there was. Thank god for the salsa on the plate or it would have been a total loss. I've had other dishes there that I love but I recommend staying clear of the mahi tacos.
Jennifer L.,Peekskill  NY,760,547,814,1/7/2017,2.0,"What a disaster. I really wanted to like this place but the service was god awful and the food was mediocre at best. We called in advance to place our name on the waitlist (this was the best part of our visit - service wise). We were seated within 10 minutes. Our waiter came over right away to take our drink order  the kids order and I placed an app order (fried calamari). For my kids I ordered spaghetti and rice (yes rice  my daughter has strange eating habits.. don\'t ask..) and Mac n Cheese with fries for my son. When or drinks arrived we placed our order - pulled pork sandwich for me and some chicken entree for my hubby... here\'s where the disaster began. Our calamari came out after a good 15 minutes along with my daughter\'s spaghetti... then the server went back to get her rice and my son\'s fries... but no mac n cheese.... so my son tried the calamari Bc he was starving and lucky for us liked it. Mean while I kept trying to find my waiter to see what was going on with the Mac n cheese but he was busy and acting frantic but never turned his head to look our way... after a good 8-10 minutes of my kid eating French fries and calamari (which btw was not good... tasted like rubber bands..) finally our waiter was standing at the register when I had to basically scream EXCUSE ME to get his attention. I asked him where\'s he mac n cheese and his response was ""oh there\'re probably still working on it..."" wrong answer guy... so he went to the back and came right back out with it... it was sitting there. Not hot  but warm - warm was fine with me Bc he doesn\'t like it hot. Now our food comes out. I was expecting typical shredded pulled pork... it was chunks of pork with fatty pieces. It was supposed to come topped with frizzled onions but had none but Bc I couldn\'t find my server I didn\'t say anything. I didn\'t enjoy it though I ate it. Now I drank my whole cup of soda and needed a refill. Once again our waiter was no where to be found. Then when he appeared he was on the opposite side of the restaurant staring off into space. I literally waved him down to get a refill. He apologized and told us he had a table of kids that pulled a diner dash... sucks  but get yourself together and serve the rest of your customers who would probably be willing to give you a good tip had you been a good waiter!!! Maybe they didn\'t pay Bc you suck!! We ordered the kids ice cream sundaes Bc they wanted one and hubs n i split their cookie/brownie trio dessert. That was very good. We had cookies n cream  salted caramel and double chocolate. Also had a cup of coffee which was surprisingly delicious. I\'d probably give this place another shot with hopes of not getting the same waiter."
Bryan N.,Delray Beach  FL,0,8,6,3/26/2017,1.0,Now that I've been to BJ's seven times and have tried a variety of the menu items. 1.Decor excellent great layout and plenty of TVs. BUT the Food is not good. You ask why did I keep goingThe answer is that the service is fantastic the people working there are friendly and fun so I kept trying to find that signature dish to rely on. But no Luck.My advise drink the beer enjoy their home made sodas  watched the games and enjoy the crowds and chat with the friendly staff.
Nick N.,Hackensack  NJ,0,36,,8/23/2017,1.0,Having been a regular at BJ's new place in Teterbpro  NJ we though it safe to stop in at BJ's in Nanuet Saturday. Like comparing apples and oranges. The place in Teterboro is headamd shoulders above this place in food and service. Same menu but hardly the quality or presentation I have come to expect and always get in Teterboro. They ought to send the magager from that place up to Nanuet to straighten it out....
Itzel A.,White Plains  NY,33,133,525,1/6/2017,3.0,This place is cool mainly Bc they brew their own beer. Now how they got the name bjs even allowed with what is known to us as bjs is a wholesale club. Now the bartenders are extremely friendly and helpful. The lack of stars is for the menu. It's similar to a Friday's or a food chain. The happy hour is ok nothing special they take $1 off beer and $2 off appys so you are not really getting a bargain. Parking is not a problem and the food timing was not a dwell. Although the food tastes frozen I hate when I order a chicken breast and it taste frozen not fresh off the grill. But I would recommend and I would visit again.
Caroline M.,Monsey  NY,0,7,,4/30/2017,5.0,This is my favorite place to go! The meals always come out great; no matter what ive gotten  clean  cheap (unless youre getting the alaskian caught salmon or the occasional steak)  friendly  and always well taken care of. They have a variety of drinks (alcoholic and/or non-alcoholic)  and a large variety of food. They also offer lower calorie dishes as well for anyone whos being careful.
Lisa M.,Rockland County  NY,235,99,356,12/29/2015,4.0,I visited with a few friends about two days and let's just say.. I'll definitely be coming back. The setting is very nice and casual and our waitress was great! If you don't like crowded places  don't go on a Saturday night. The bar was very full (and maybe there was one asshole who just wouldn't let me use a chair for our table). Overall  great experience!
Culture O.,Nyack  NY,106,3,,4/22/2017,5.0,Came in the other day and love the food service and beer. Staff was nice and knowledgeable. The restaurant is clean and looks nice. I only came over because Bonefish closed down but very very happy I did. I found something nice here. A+ establishment to share with friends and family. TRY the pizookie. It is like a fresh baked cookie with icecream on top. Whoever thought of this is amazing!
Gerardo Karen P.,Greenwich Village  Manhattan  NY,9,4,,11/10/2016,1.0,"Terrible service!! Food mediocre but the beer is good!! Do yourself a favor and better go to the Palisades Mall Yard House!! Waiters are young fellows that don\'t know anything about the drinks they offer (obviously they are above 21 yrs)..  I live in Rockland county and I know very well the clientele and the neighborhood is not the most sophisticated.. but the service here is ""piece of crap"" rude  pushing! Never go back to this horrendous bar!!"
Aaron C.,Fort Lee  NJ,118,13,2,7/4/2017,4.0,Bjs Brewhouse has always been a place that has good food and good vibe. It is located at the Nanuet shopping complex and has easy access to parking. The menu consists of various of items. I love their deep dish pizza. A small is actually filling for me (6 slices). The slices are humongous and you can choose a lot of options. Their ribs are pretty good as well. The meat easily comes off the bone and it is served with 2 signature sides. The half rack is $18 and a full rack is $22. I would recommend always getting the full rack to get your moneys worth. The sides I usually get are either their fries  rice pilaf  sprussel sprouts and I've recently tried their couscous mac n cheese and it was really good. It was gooey and filled with tomato  cheese  and bacon. Of course  their desserts is a must have which is their pizookies. My go to choice is white macadamia nut pizookie with vanilla ice cream on top. It is always served hot so the ice cream is soft and melts in your mouth. I'm not a beer drinker but they have tons of beer options  hence the name. Price is very reasonable ($10-$18) and the portions are enough where you become full. The only thing I would not recommend is eating their on a holiday. I went there for father's day and the service was lousy. We reserved a table beforehand and when we got there  they gave the table to someone else because we never responded to the text saying we were here even though they never told us to respond to a text message saying we were there. So we had to wait an additional 45 minutes just to be seated. While people kept walking in and getting seated  we were literally the last ones. The host didn't know what she was doing and didn't communicate properly to us.
Nick C.,Ridgefield Park  NJ,318,953,1643,3/11/2015,3.0,Pretty good for a chain restaurant  but for a brewhouse  their beers aren't very good. Came for lunch on a Saturday and it was pretty busy. The place is nice and there are plenty of TVs.Service was pretty good  very attentive. I had the lemon thyme chicken served with brown rice and veggies. The chicken was very tender  I didn't need a knife. The entire dish was flavorful and obviously tasted of lemon and thyme. A bit expensive at near $15 though. I wouldn't mind returning.
Jordyn B.,Pearl River  NY,188,11,2,6/24/2016,1.0,Horrible food. Chicken came out pink and rubbery.AMAZING service.Too bad the food isn't as good as the service or I would be a regular!
Angelo O.,Ramsey  NJ,0,23,,6/4/2016,4.0,"The food was excellent. The root beer glaze over the ribs was ridiculously good. The fries were good..but a little too thin  lets beef those boys up a notch. Our server ""Zack""  was awesome. Hooked him up w 20%+ for sure. The bathrooms however  well let\'s just say  bring your napkins from the table  bc they\'re out of toilet paper in the ladies room..\'during dinner\'..how is this possible? The men\'s room  not so bad  I mean we\'re dudes takin a piss  but the hand napkins were all over the damn floor overflowing the garbage. Pull it together cleaning staff! Other than that  not bad  will go again. Oh yeah  clean the damn menus  mine had food inside of the menu. Yes. Food stuck. Inside the menu. Seriously? Should prob chuck this joint 3-stars  but Zack saved the day. Promote Zack."
Gary B.,Lancaster  NY,1,106,,6/27/2016,3.0,Not a fan of brew houses and craft beers so probably shouldnt be here but myself and 5 others had to get away from my daughters baby shower and this place was the destination.I dont care for the hugeness but because was a sunday lunch and not crowded at all.Our waitress was very good and attentive and we appreciated how she would bring second round of drinks without asking and that was just fine. She checked on us and was very good with any explanations.The menu weighed about 5 pounds!As for the food - the bacon cheeseburgers were excellent and cooked as requested -was pretty large with plenty of delicious bacon and cheese. The taste was one of the best around. The plate though was overloaded with skinny fries that were all over the place- they were not very tasty but sure were crunch and I stated skinny and long.There was an order of short ribs that 2 split and they it was huge and tasted good and were devoured.The last order was for the shrimp tacos also noted as tasting good but to me looked disappointing as the shrimp were small (makes sense small shrimp- but NOT really) and could have been larger and there were 2.The warm pizookie- a chocolate chip cookie with ice cream deserts were enjoyed by those that got them.But overall the food was very good but the ambiance of the place is like a huge warehouse- its reputation though is for mobbed weekend nights so somethings going well here.But for me its A-ok and a place I would not intend on going back to again- thats just me and the way I feel about these craft beer places anyway.
Phyllis K.,Waldwick  NJ,8,2,,5/11/2016,2.0,"Brought 4 hungry teenagers for a birthday dinner on a Wednesday evening. Wasn\'t impressed at all. Extensive menu but most of what we ordered was disappointing. Tried a $20 appetizer sampler and the best part of it was the boneless chicken wings. Mozzarella sticks with a sauce that resembled and tasted like tomato paste from a can  an over cooked and tiny dish of spinach dip and mini avocado egg rolls that tasted ""off"". Main dishes were all lukewarm-cold when they came. Best part of the meal was dessert but wouldn\'t come again. Kudos for the free soda refills (4 teenagers drink lots of soda) but not for much else."
Paul F.,Park Ridge  NJ,11,29,1,3/28/2017,1.0,What a complete disaster. Service was horrible and no one seemed to care. My wife had finished her first drink before I had even got mine. There was some confusion at the bar with several beer choices not available  so after trying a couple of samples i ordered a drink. Guess what? The wrong beer came and the server could see we were unhappy. Instead of trying to resolve the issue she turned on her heels and disappeared only reappearing once the food was brought out. Now  onto the food. The sandwich was OK but i have never seen such an abysmal plate of boneless wings in all my life. I honestly believe that I was the third or fourth table to see that sorry plate. Either that or they had been sat under a heat lamp for 20 minutes. They were dry husks and the sauce had been baked in to them to the point that there was not an ounce of moisture left in sight. Horrible and i doubt if I will return.
Christina D.,Nanuet  NY,81,8,,5/10/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Extremely disappointed. Just had to walk out after waiting 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us. We were seated promptly provided a high chair for our 15th month old son. No one came over to give us place settings or take our order. Other tables were seated after us were given water  place settings and acknowledged. Employees lingered around and passed right by our table. We finally gave up and left. We are also rewards members and have been dining here since they grand opened.After I posted the review management contacted me to apologize for the lack of service. We have gone there in the past and never had an issue. All of our other dining experiences have been great. Service at the bar is always spot on. They have a great outdoor seating area as well.
Nicole A.,West Nyack  NY,31,4,3,3/19/2016,1.0,"Terrible experience Thursday night. My coworker and myself ordered take out .. Deep dish ravioli with NO pepperoni. Low and behold there was pepperoni through out the entire dish. I called and spoke to a manager. He kindly offered me a new order and to deliver it to my job! When I opened the new order it was baked ziti ... -_- We also ordered the trio of ""pizookies"" which were basically cookies in a tin. I\'m still trying to figure out what the ""piz"" stands for .. Overall a very disappointing experience !"
Brian O.,Bronxville  NY,0,18,4,9/16/2016,4.0,Very good selection of their own brews. The food was very good - I had the jumbalaya and loved it. My wife had a nice ribeye. We shared an appy of root beer glazed ribs - YUM!Service was very good  hostess and waitress very nice and attentive. Atmosphere ok. Just a real big room witj high ceilings and a lot of TV's with the Yankees (boo) and (Let's Go) Mets on.
NY Yelper Y.,Brooklyn  NY,94,3,1,1/11/2017,5.0,Love this place!! Fast service and the food is AMAZING!! My favorite drink is the Sour Patch!
G M.,Huntington Beach  CA,0,397,710,11/20/2016,3.0,I have been going to BJ's for decades. Originally a pizza chain  but its morphed into something of a sports bar too. The climate is California-trendy  there are multiple screens showing different games  music playing  and its loud and hard to talk. We went on a Saturday night and there was a 45 minute wait.As for the food  it doesn't seem to be as good as the original California BJ's. We had the exact same dishes 6 months ago in Huntington Beach - flatbread margherita pizza  and salmon with quinoa  and both of them were a notch less good in this location. The quinoa was salty and slightly bitter and too wet. The flatbread pizza was kind of bland. We didn't try one of the main large pizzas.
Natalia S.,New City  NY,0,2,,4/10/2017,1.0,"I have never seen such a show at a restaurant in all my years. So much so that I made a yelp account specifically for the review !! My friends and I sat at a high top table in the bar and a few minutes later the manager came over and gave us menus. She told us about the pizza special which I was excited about and what we had came for and insisted we try the blonde beer as we first requested bud lights. ( It\'s our new favorite !) Our server was Megan   although she seemed to be a nice girl our service was horrible. We waited forever for our food which was ice cold   and waited at least 15 minutes for our drinks each time we ordered a round. My food came out 20 minutes after everyone else\'s and was a hockey puck that I requested to be medium rare. After our server disappeared again I got up and asked Nicole who was standing at the bar to come to the table. After we explained what was happening   she expressed her apologies and assured us this was not a regular occurrence. At this point I didn\'t want any more food or drinks and I just wanted to get out as fast as I could. She ended up discounting our check which we appreciated very much. Even our exit was rudely interrupted by the bartender screaming ""LAST CALL!!!"" like we were in some packed college bar. What is going on BJs ???? Somehow  Nicole managed to convinced us to give BJs another chance but we\'ll be very cautious and will make sure she is there when (if) we come back."
Nikki J.,Mount Ivy  NY,118,13,,1/6/2017,4.0,So pleased with my visit tonight. Our server Kevin was amazing  always had on a smile and made sure that we were doing okay. He recommended great stuff and seemed to know the menu front and back. He was extremely patient with me because I couldn't seem to make up my mind! The mushrooms stuffed with spinach and feta was delicious along with the bone-in wings and fried asparagus. For my main meal I got the cherry chipotle salmon and my boyfriend got the full rack of ribs (literally fall of the bone ribs). I will definitely be coming in again! Thanks Kevin for an enjoyable visit :)
Harry P.,Mahwah  NJ,213,521,635,3/5/2015,3.0,This is a solid spot  I would give it a better review if it did not take hours to get my food. But when I did get the food  it was very good. I had the California burger with avocado  bacon and a really good spicy sauce along with fresh hot peppers on it. The flavor was there and the burger was cooked perfectly. The bread it was served on was great  and added a nice crispy buttery aspect to the burger. They brew their own beer but I was not so impressed with. I had the Piranha Pale Ale that supposedly is brewed with cascade hops but lacked that fruit flavor you normally get from cascade hops. I would go back to try the pizza that looked very good.
Steve P.,Irvington  NY,14,140,6,10/24/2016,4.0,Not sure why some of the lower ratings here. BJ's is part of a strip mall in Nanuet  sharing space with a P.F. Chang's. a pretty large Friday's style sports bar with a neat outdoor space featuring a grill pit (for warmth on this cold night) bright and lively inside with large screens for sports events  a full bar and tons of large  comfy booths. Service was excellent and a very wide food selection. Had the lie cal spicy chicken with rice and beans which was plain but delicious with a tomato sauce. Wife had a bacon cheeseburger with skinny frites which was excellent. Best cup of coffee I've had in a long while. Very satisfying meal and I'll be sure to return.
Josh C.,Charlotte  NC,143,2,,12/11/2016,5.0,I tried BJs out when I was traveling for business for a few days. The food looked so good that I had to come back multiple times throughout my stay to try several things. I hardly ever go to the same place twice in my travels  but in 2 weeks I have been here 5 times! The bar staff is also great! Lou and Ericka served me a few times and even remembered me. I would highly suggest trying the spinach stuffed mushrooms and salmon quinoa bowl. Those were my 2 favorites  but everything I tried was great. The only negative I could find were the menus could use a cleaning as they smelled a bit foul. If that's the only negative I could come up with then that's great.
Elizabeth S.,Kailua  HI,0,4,,12/11/2016,5.0,GREAT FOOD! Love the portions and the quality. They have a complimentary kids starter (friut and garlic knot). Craft beer has a good variety as well!!! Will go again soon!
Kris A.,Nanuet  NY,54,56,51,2/3/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Wanted to give BJ'a another try since I wasn't impressed last time. We were greeted right away by the host and he was really nice  making us feel very welcomed. Although it was around lunch time the place was kinda quiet. I ordered the grilled chicken Caesar salad and my boyfriend got a bacon cheese burger with fries. The salad was delicious. Very fresh and the grilled chicken was juicy  which is sometimes hard to get at other places. My boyfriends burger was really good too. It was juicy and flavorful. The fries were also excellent as well. We will defiantly be back!
Ashley A.,Westwood  NJ,114,191,438,7/31/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,"Well  after a few trips to BJ\'s Brewhouse I\'ve come to the conclusion that although the food is good  service just doesn\'t match up. My last visit was a disaster. We chose BJ\'s to kickstart our vacation thinking we\'d have a great meal and a fun time. It was anything but that. Our waitress was very condescending to my Fiance basically telling him to ""shut up"". Here\'s how it started. We were originally seated by a different waitress. We told her we wanted to pay with the bjs online app and that we were members. She took down the info and put our drink orders in. A little bit later a different waitress returned and said she would be taking over. Since the message wasn\'t relayed to her that we were going to be paying with the bjs app  we reminded her and she took down the info. We  all three of us places our orders. Nothing complicated. I got the veggie deep dish pizza  fianc jambalaya and brother baked ziti. About 20 mins later the ziti and jambalaya comes out and she says ""it\'ll just be a couple of mins sweetie"" to me  and btw I\'m like twice her age so sweetie seemed weird to me lol. Anyways  long story short another 20 mins go by and finally she brings out the pizza  but it\'s got ham all over it so clearly it\'s not correct. I said that and she\'s like ""are you sure?"" And checked her pad  I was like ""yes I\'m sure  I k ow what I ordered and I don\'t eat ham"" so  no apologies  just takes the pizza away and says I\'ll have him make you a new one it\'ll just take a couple mins. So she comes out like 10 mins later and the pizza is correct but it\'s ice cold  as if it\'s been sitting for a while. I just asked her to wrap it up and I\'ll take it home and microwave it and eat it there. She insists that I should order a new one free of charge cause she wants me to be satisfied. At that point we were all tired and just wanted to go home. It wasn\'t a good experience so my fianc said ""no  well just take it home"" and she said to him "" I\'m talking to her  can she speak? You enjoyed your food so let her make up her own mind"" I was shocked. At that point I just said ok  make a new one. More to keep the peace and just so she would stop insisting and let us be. My fianc was so upset. He didn\'t say a word after that. I felt so bad. He\'s been in the waitering buisness himself and was appalled at how she acted. So we waited about another 10 min  my fianc didn\'t finish his food and when the pizza came out  again it was cold. But I didn\'t say anything because I just wanted to go. I forced myself to eat one slice ""lost my appetite at that point"" and then asked for it to be wrapped. When we tried to pay online we could see that out order was never applied to the app  and she handed us a check. So   for the third time we explained that we wanted to pay online through the bjs app and she acted as if it was the first time she heard this. In the end she gave us the pizza free and 20% off the bill  but after this experience we have decided we will not be going back. Every time we go there\'s a blunder  and although we get compensated for it in the end it would be nice to be able to go and just have a drama free experience."
Adam C.,Wallkill  NY,1,2,1,5/13/2017,5.0,Great food and good service. Calamari is good. A lot of great beers as well. My girlfriend got the berry cider and it tasted very good. Recommend coming here
Kimberly D.,Yorktown Heights  NY,59,325,1259,8/13/2015,3.0,Wasn't wowed. My salad was fine  my husband ordered a burger that was pretty good. Nothing special.
Shira A.,Ellicott City  MD,20,15,2,8/15/2016,5.0,Food was excellent and service was good too. The manager saw we hadn't been helped  came over and apologized  took our drink order and even our food because we were ready quickly. We were actually driving home from NY to Maryland and we were just looking for something not super fancy but not fast food and this was perfect :-) I had the meat lovers Piorini (sp?) and my husband had a burger which he said was cooked perfectly. Highly recommend
Orlando A.,Hazleton  PA,0,10,6,2/3/2015,4.0,"I give 4 starts because the restaurant looks great ! The food was excellent  I went during the pre opening and I was impressed by the food..I had the pork chops with mash potatoes and a tortilla soup. -- the pork was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. The mash potatoes was one of the best I had as well as the soup. I like how they pour the soup in front of you from a stainless steel cup. My second guest had a flat bread which was great. Perfectly crispy and had great taste. My third guest had burger sliders which were well done -- had good taste and had the fixings on the side so you could build it the way you like--- the desert which we shared was some kind of pecan which ice cream on top served in a skillet. We finished that in no time  fighting over pieces. Now for the bad -- service really needs help. I understand it\'s a new place but the service was horrible. Staff knew almost nothing that was going on  what was on the menu. The person helping the trainee was excellent he said he comes from a bj\'s in Columbus Ohio. Need more staff like him. A young lady in guessing was the manager was going table to table. Came to our table and didn\'t ask how our meal or food was but asked ""is all you good"" (the look on everyone face at my table was priceless) -- not what a manager should be asking. She should have ask very specifically about our experience and/or the food"
Tink M.,Elmwood Park  NJ,0,5,,7/1/2016,1.0,"Horrible experience. They put the pizza up on high trays but don\'t cut all the way through the crust. My mother tried to reach up and get a piece out  the tray slipped off and knocked over and broke her martini. The staff cleaned it up and said "" we\'ll bring you another drink"" THEN charged us for the second drink! Really poor practice. We\'ll never return."
Angela P.,Keansburg  NJ,10,27,32,12/20/2015,4.0,Discovered this place a few months and now I stop in every time I am in the area. They have a great menu that gets updated regularly and I can always find unexpected appetizers and interesting drinks. The brisket burger here is the BEST burger I have ever eaten in my life- so much flavor!! They are also one of the few places that cook a good RARE burger correctly. Good service. I don't drink- but they seem to have a good select cool of beers and speciality drinks. The only drawback to this place is the parking is awful. A lot of restaurants and a mall with little to no parking. If you plan on visiting on a night or weekend- be prepared to circle the lot multiple times.
Angie K.,New York  NY,0,21,1,4/30/2017,4.0,Been here a couple of times. It was very good and the servers and quite attentive. Highly recommend the salmon quinoa and the salads. Everything is pretty good   very well seasoned (maybe a tad too much e.g. my husband's Cajun pasta).
Barbara B.,Pearl River  NY,0,4,1,11/12/2016,5.0,This is one of the best places to eat in Rockland... always great food wonderful wait staff and a very upbeat and fun place... very clean and the best beers....
Lorraine B.,Nanuet  NY,5,49,34,12/18/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,I love this place! We tried the Mediterranean chicken taco and it's amazing as is the the roasted brussel sprouts kale salad! Coming here is fun and brightens the day. The staff is welcoming and efficient; the food is great; amazing drinks so what else do you need?? The menu changes periodically and the classics are always present. Way to go
Sheera H.,Inwood  Manhattan  NY,2,8,8,7/3/2015,3.0,Food was amazing however the server could have been a lot better. Our server was very bland & seemed very distracted. We barely exchanged in a conversation... I felt a weird vibe. I had the BJ brewhouse Burger & it was scrumptious my boyfriend had the Mahi Mahi with shrimp & it was on point. Overall it was great we had a good time.
Ashley S.,Nanuet  NY,63,15,74,9/24/2015,3.0,"I enjoy coming here to eat and drink at the bar or outside  but the rest of the restaurant is a mess in my opinion.They have great happy hour specials  occasional special beer dinners  and all of their ""house"" beers are really yummy.All of the food I\'ve tried here has been really delicious. From the honey sriracha brussel sprouts to the brisket bacon burger. My favorite house beer has to be their Nutty Brewnette. The bar area is super nice although there are not many seats. The outdoor area is also really nice but with limited seating. The wait to eat can be very long but if you download their app you can put your name on the wait list before you even get there. I highly encourage doing so. The bar service has been pretty good each time I went but the food can take a long time to come out. My biggest complaints are for the lobby service and take out service. Sometimes there is only one person at the front desk and they have to take each group to a table then come back and help the next. This can take a while considering the size of this place and they should have 2 people up there during peak hours.TAKE OUT ANNOYANCE: Today I picked up lunch. I ordered and paid for one of their lunch specials online. It was the half flatbread pizza with a salad for $7.75. I got there on time. The woman at the take out desk hands me the pizza. I said ""Doesn\'t this come with a salad?"" She had no clue. I had to take out my phone and pull up the confirmation email to prove to her that it does come with a salad. So then I waited about 5 minutes to bring out the very simple salad. She asked me if I wanted dressing even though it\'s supposed to come with it. Finally I have everything I paid for. Then she begins to tell me what I owe. I tell her that I already paid online. Again  I have to pull up my receipt confirmation email and show her this. She didn\'t even say anything after I show her so I just ask ""Are we done here?"" and she replies ""Yes"". And I\'m out the door. I get home and the pizza is cold so I have to microwave it. GREATIt\'s safe to say that I\'m going to wait a very long time before I even consider ordering for take out here again. The managers here really need to do some more training because some of these employees don\'t even know their own menu. A simple 2 minute process took about 10 minutes. I\'ll just stick to eating at the bar."
Jess T.,Yonkers  NY,0,8,1,3/28/2017,5.0,Delicious food  great service! Had the broccoli cheddar bread bowl which was amazing! The ribs were outta this world! And omg the desserts! Def going to come back!
Steve M.,Nanuet  NY,11,51,33,8/23/2015,1.0,"Abysmal.The food WAS good enough to get them back to two stars  but this ""okay  I\'ll give them one more chance"" trip proved even the food is not consistant.Service was lazy  uneducated  wrong  haphazard  slow  surly  and ultimately ineffective.This is a BEER place  and you have to ask if something advertised at the front door on a giant poster is still on tap??  And when you ""go check""  you forget my companions order? And then when you finally get the beer that I wanted  you forget my companion\'s order AGAIN?""Crispy Calamari"" wasn\'t even half right. Terribly under cooked  soggy  greasy and disgusting  I can assume it actually squid... but the texture suggested oily dishrags.The Ahi Poke appetizer was tasty  but a miniscule quantity for such little tuna that was barely sushi grade.Her steak was okay  but the brussel sprouts were overcooked and dead.My New Orleans jambalaya was greasy with overdone andoulie sausage.But the CARDINAL sin (in my eyes) was the 35 minute wait for a beer. I was about to pull a ""Gina"" [that\'s when you call the establishment  from your table  politely ask for the manager on duty  and then politely ask for somebody to service your table] but miss attitude finally stopped by (I already asked for another beer from the kitchen carry out guy and a busboy) and my companion says ""Can he get another beer?"" Which should have been a hint. But no. It took another 20 minutes with a ""your beer is almost ready""...WTF? Was it final lagering? Were they dry-hopping to order??Not to mention the beers here are mediocre at best. If you want to dip your toe in craft beer  you might start here. If you want something other than pretend chain-commercial shite  go elsewhere. Besides  the service sucks beyond reality.Sucks!"
Adam H.,Suffern  NY,80,38,2,6/1/2016,2.0,Overpriced pub fare menu and mediocre beers - disappointed.
Maria J.,New City  NY,64,5,,7/29/2016,5.0,Love BJ Brewhouse! The service is great  the food is great and I love how they cater to children. This is definitely a new favorite place for my family. The drinks list looks impressive; next trip... The bar! Looking forwarding to retuning soon.
Lisa S.,New City  NY,42,38,17,9/6/2015,5.0,We went for dinner on a Saturday night and have absolutely no complaints. Got there about 8:15 p.m. and were sat right away because they had a two-seat booth available.Waiter was friendly and efficient. Hubby loved that Pilsner Urquell was on tap  and I got the house hard cider which had hints of raspberry herbal tea in a very good way.We got one small plate  the stuffed mushrooms  which were excellent  and hubby loved his jambalaya. I got the ribs and  while they weren't the best ribs I've ever had  they were good enough. Portion sizes were good without being grotesque  and the bill at the end of it was not shabby for two entrees  a small plate  and two drinks. And best of all we made our movie!
Bianca W.,Rockland County  NY,6,18,1,7/9/2016,5.0,Their food is great! Nice restaurant and atmosphere. Prices are reasonable. Drinks are great! I love the outdoor seating. This is a great addition to the area.
Frank M.,Westwood  NJ,94,109,2,7/2/2015,5.0,THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for bringing this to the East Coast! I'm originally from California and used to love visiting these back home. I've got one word for you... Pazookie! That alone will keep bringing me back.Pizza is great  service is great and friendly  and the beer selection is on point. Not to mention I love their own brewed craft beers. I was sad to see they didn't brew them onsite like they do at some of their other locations but hey... it's all the same.Pro tip... download their app and check in prior to arriving so that you don't have to wait as long to be sat  especially if you have a large group (6 or more people) because this place doesn't have much in the way of space for large parties.
June F.,Rockford  IL,0,31,24,2/12/2016,5.0,Wonderful as always... Sweet Sin Chocolate Ale was perfect for Valentines weekend . Server was great and drinks and food came out fast!
C F.,Ridgewood  NJ,1,21,4,1/3/2017,3.0,I went there with a few co workers. The drinks were good. The appetizers platter was good but little pricey. The wait time in crazy but yet they have more tables in the back with nobody sitting there. I don't know why it was like that .
Christian M.,New City  NY,0,1,,11/21/2016,1.0,"HORRIBLE!! The horrible expierence started when i walked in the door. Waited at the door for 10 minuets for a host to come over and seat us - went on a weeknight not a weekend.: the place was not busyWhen finally seated  waiting 20 minuets for our server (megan) to come over and get our drinks. We asked to order our drinks and food together since we were so annoyed from waiting for so long- her response was ""ill put in your drinks and be right back to take your order.."" 15 minuets later we finally got our drinks.. she never came back to take our order in that time. Instead she decided to talk to her co workers and use her cell phone on the floor. Finally we put our order in.. I got the brussel spouts; she brought them out and i noticed a hair in my food. I knew it wasnt mine because it was long and hair and my hair is short and blonde. Then i notice our server had her hair down and not tied back.. i told her about the hair and she insisted it was mine and not hers. When i asked to speak to the manager she told me that the manager had stepped out and wouldnt be back for a while. Then i asked who i could speak to about my horrible expierence there and she said her. This place is unprofessional and gross. Servers need to tie there hair up. If you do go there prepare to be there half a day and make sure you dont get megan as a server. I will not be back."
Christina C.,New City  NY,0,14,,1/27/2016,3.0,Visited twice. Bartenders were too busy servicing the younger crowd  that my group was overlooked.Second time  had table service. Waiter not available when we needed him.Desserts and flatbread pizza were good. Everything else  OK.
Shirley S.,Mahwah  NJ,6,25,1,6/17/2015,2.0,Food was good BUT you don't serve your main entree first & then I had to inform them we order a flatbread appetizer also. So they bring the appetizer out & now we are eating the appetizer & entree at the same time!  Who does that??? Now we are shoving the food at the same time! No apologies from the wait servicefor bringing everything out at the same time! Not professional at all! My husband beer( Indian Pale Ale) was so so! Waste of time to go there!
Jaime D.,Nanuet  NY,1,4,1,4/29/2015,1.0,Can I give zero stars?! Awful food. Corporate money was spent on a very cool space. Nothing else positive to say except that Zinbergers is right around the corner! What a bummer Bj's. If I were a dude  I wouldn't want one from you!
Sherri O.,Westwood  NJ,0,48,3,12/11/2015,2.0,Used the app to call ahead and order ahead. No help. Still waited and waited and food wasn't ready Food ok not great - ok if you don't have to wait but not worth this wait. Not coming back
Anthony K.,Englewood Cliffs  NJ,8,25,,10/29/2015,2.0,"I walked in hear thinking it to be a similar experience to Heartland Brewery locations in Manhattan and I was incorrect. They get 2 stars for having unique beers that I\'ve not tried before as it is their in house brand. I\'ve been here twice  apps and deep dish pizza and nothing about my food wow-ed me but more disappointing the buffalo chicken pizza was so salty that I thought my tongue was going to quit on me. Perhaps it\'s a way to get more drinks served... ""these pretzels are makin\' me thirsty"" In any case  it\'s a large place with plenty of seating and many options so while it has value in a mall setting I wouldn\'t go back any time soon if I have other options."
Elizabeth B.,Nyack  NY,851,31,9,10/1/2015,2.0,We were excited to see this restaurant open at the new Nanuet Shops Mall and were looking forward to try it. The first time we went the hostess was less than friendly and actually handed us the menus and pointed to the table where we should sit. My husband was underwhelmed by the selection of beer. You can find better and more interesting selections at establishments close by.Service was friendly and you could tell each of the servers were wanting to do what they could to make us happy. Food came came out after a 45 minute wait on our first visit in a half full restaurant. And then on our second visit the food came out in ten min in a fairly empty restaurant. The food was ok. The Chicken Club sandwich was ok  a little greasy. The pulled pork sandwich was pretty good. Off the kids menu my daughter had the pizza. It was a reheated frozen Boboli looking thing. It was gross and she didn't touch it. Overall  its not worth a special trip and now I know what to expect should I find myself there again.
Patrick L.,Nyack  NY,4,47,41,3/30/2015,1.0,"Been wanting to try since they opened so I took my wife and two of my kids for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Really wasn\'t impressed at all.Simple design to the restaurant. TV\'s everywhere. But if you\'re going to use kegs of beer as part of the decor  you\'d think that you would at least clean them.Hostesses seemed like they didn\'t want to be there and had no personality at the front desk or while walking to the table. Not sure if is something they were told to do  or do it on their own  but the hostesses walk to the table at an uncomfortably slow pace. Watched them do this with many tables.Waitress seemed pleasant enough. Way too much jewelry on to be waiting on tables. Menu knowledge needs some work as she needed my wife to hold up the menu while she read the description to see if the kids meal came with a side item.Place was full  but not crazy.  25 minutes from ordering to food hitting the table.Ordered two basic burgers. One medium  one medium well. Food runner came out  and when I asked which one was medium  she smiled and said \'they\'re both medium well\' with a smile  dropped them  and left without questioning the mistake. Burgers were much more suited for a drunken 1am binge...heavy and greasy...buns were grilled in butter...California club was tasty  but became unappealing upon a short curly hair on the plate...obviously not my wife\'s or mine.Kids pan pizza obviously a reheated boboli like pizza. My daughter didn\'t touch it.Consolidated some food on a plate to bring it home. Waitress said that she would bring us a box because they \'are not allowed to box things up"" for us. What? That made no sense.Their own brand of IPA was relatively flavorless. Overall tap beer list was very generic. With Growler and Gill right down the road  there is no reason to go there for a beer.Wine glass for wife\'s drink was never polished from the night before.Wont be back. it\'s a shame. With G&G down the road in one direction  and Yard House the other  there is no reason to go here for what they should be known for  a good beer and a burger."
Lori L.,Nanuet  NY,29,21,8,3/15/2016,1.0,Terrible experience Sunday night . Ordered a takeout order apparently the kitchen was having issues receiving the order.  Staff called to confirm order. Husband shows up to get order  one item is missing. They make it  other food is cold!  Get it together!!
Dr D.,West Nyack  NY,0,27,,10/29/2015,2.0,The most mediocre of bar food. Pretty much Applebees standard. Beers are okay though. Jambalaya was terribly average and probably not worth the calories. Same deal with the shrimp tacos. Come here for a good time and some bang average bar food  but not for a quality meal.
Laura F.,Rockville  MD,0,2,,12/16/2016,5.0,Visiting from MD  stumbled across this gem! Great service food& prices! My son loved the keg root beer!
Chris L.,Rochelle Park  NJ,41,12,21,6/11/2015,4.0,Good food and beer. Love the siracha brussel sprouts. Great tang to them. Chili and wraps are very good too. Try the French dip... You won't be disappointed!
Elaine K.,West Nyack  NY,17,98,400,9/18/2015,3.0,Yes only 3 stars. Been here a few times both lunch/dinners. My husband & I have had a nice time  but each time we came  they've delivered our appy with entrees! Our last dinner here we had lemon pepper wings that was good  but my entree a deep dish ravioli was salty & lukewarm  only ate 1/4 of it; my hubby had tortilla soup bowl  that was salty too. It was good but he couldn't finish. BJ's please keep our entrees on hot plate until we're ready for it. Or bring out the appy first followed by entrees 5-10mins later.
Maricel V.,New City  NY,154,65,17,8/21/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,So grossly upset with my order!! Knowing that my sister loved their pizookie dessert  I wanted to get her a large pizookie cake. What a HUGE MISTAKE. I called in early to let them know I'd pick it up between 7:30 and 8:00pm. I wasn't able to pick it up till 8:45.. I called them to let them know I was coming. By the time I got there it was still in the oven and the waitress helping me said it would only take 10 mins. I waited for 30 mins... apparently  they threw out the cake they originally made bc it had been sitting out for a while. I'm not sure I fully believe that and I wouldn't have minded a not hot out of the oven cookie cake. I can understand why they would do that for regular food   but not a baked cookie cake.The wait was horrible! By the time we reached where we were supposed to eat dinner  most of the people had finished eating already. What was WORSE was how the large pizookie cake turned out. It wasn't cooked all the way through. Some parts were really salty  but most of it was way too sweet. It was inedible. I'd probably need insulin just to be able to get through one piece and come out alive. It was a disaster!!!No one even wanted to eat it  including me.The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because 1) the waitress who was helping me was nice  although she lied about the wait time and 2) because I'm nice! Lesson learned: NEVER MAKING THIS MISTAKE AGAIN!
Rob H.,Tuckahoe  NY,4,6,5,1/7/2016,4.0,The beer options were great. The apps and dinners were great. I had the quinoa with salmon and really enjoyed it. The waiter (JP) was awesome. He let me taste different beers and was attentive all night. I was impressed.
Kathy M.,Garnerville  NY,2,6,1,4/5/2015,5.0,First time there on 4/4/15. Nice and airy atmosphere. Great menu  and if you have not been there before  a lot to look at.The server was a really friendly young lady  attentive without being too on top of us. I enjoyed the BBQ chopped salad and the dessert  a Caramel pazookie was delicious!
Christopher L.,Monsey  NY,140,154,189,2/4/2015,3.0,The place looks fantastic. It has a very cool vibe. Service is very good but the food is kinda lacking. Desserts Pizookies are very good  they are like easy bake oven desserts. Entrees are okie and appetizers are okie. Nothing really stands out. They are very new and hopefully the food will improve.
Shannon B.,New City  NY,0,12,,11/16/2016,3.0,"So me and my boyfriend went on a date here. We got sat right away in a nice section and the waiter was attentative. However  the steak we ordered was neant to be med-well and came out rare..like rare rare. The pork chops were good but slightly dry  with the ""apple sauce"" provided they were good. The staff was well run and caring but the food was disappointing."
Liz B.,New City  NY,181,18,,2/14/2016,4.0,Go to lunch spot... grilled Mahi Mahi tacos are my fav!! The pizzas are great and I love the beet salad!
Doug M.,New City  NY,0,11,1,4/21/2016,5.0,Service is excellent. Food is prepared the way you order it and it is tasty.
Jefferson M.,Englewood  NJ,64,5,,12/22/2015,5.0,Love this place! This is our go-to late night spot (after 10pm - 12 or 1am). The happy hour options are well-priced and it's easy to find something you'll like. Even $10 can get you 2 or 3 items and you'll be sated. $15  and call it a good meal.
Jacki W.,East Greenville  PA,17,3,,11/4/2016,5.0,this place was awesome! we visited for the first time today and could not have been more impressed. we had no clue what to order because everything looked so good so we took advice of the waitress. she definitely steered us in the right direction. their homemade cream soda was divine! everything was excellent right down to dessert! wait staff was awesome and very friendly  prices were fair  definately recommend. we will be visiting again soon!
Brenden B.,Cambridge  MA,3,18,,7/6/2015,2.0,Nothing was exceptionally bad  but that's not why I go out to eat; I go out to be pleasantly surprised by good food. While they do have a decent selection of beers  it doesn't make up for the mediocre to poor food. Come here for a drink after work  but don't bother getting food.
Barbra R.,New City  NY,0,10,,4/30/2016,5.0,BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is one of my favorites! Whether lunch or dinner at a table  or drinks and app's at the bar  the hosts  servers  bussers and bartenders have always been so welcoming  friendly  helpful and professional. With the decor  tv's and vaulted ceilings  BJ's ambiance is cool  chill  can be sporty yet has a trendy city feel. You can hear the buzz echo though the restaurant. The bathrooms are clean. And the servers  bussers and bartenders I've experienced keep the tables and bar immaculate. The place gives a smooth comfortable feel.I need to give honorable mentions of the exceptional service I've had over the lasy year..Stanley the manager has gone above and beyond ensuring our needs and any issues were met. Sam the server and Matt the bartender gave the perfect amount of cheer  care and knowledge for a perfect meal and a perfect cocktail with apps.Gerald the service assistant gave the perfect amount of cheer  care and attention to us and our table.So glad we have BJ's in Nanuet  our neighboring town...
B-Man H.,Orange County  NY,5,70,5,1/10/2016,2.0,The service at this place is pretty awful. It seems like they lack management. The food takes forever and doesn't come out at the same time. The soda is flat. The food is decent but doesn't make up for the terrible service. I would not recommend.
Kathryn G.,New York  NY,12,8,1,12/10/2015,4.0,Went here on a Sunday with my sibling unit for some beers  football and food. I had a great experience. Beers are good and interesting  food is good too! I like the vibe with so many TVs we were able to see all the football games we were interested in seeing. So thanks! I will be going back. :)
Kat K.,Rochester  NY,189,10,6,10/26/2015,4.0,"Great deep dish pizza and Sriracha honey Brussels sprouts. Happy hour goes until 11PM which is exceptional  but that\'s probably the only aspect of this restaurant that would win that accolade. I ate here alone and would do so again  but if you\'re looking for a date place  don\'t take your girl unless she burps and likes football. Not that those things are bad . . . ? Necessarily? Ok I\'m getting side tracked. Everyone was very friendly. The ambiance is unique - it IS  after all  a sports bar - and I would peg it as ""classy tailgate"" or even ""a restaurant that happens to show sports""."
Kristin W.,Union  NJ,3,58,85,8/22/2015,4.0,I planned a huge surprise dinner party for my boyfriend. The restaurant put up with me calling them three times prior to the date with changes to the reservation (number of people). Thank you for your patience  managers!The evening of  we had a table set up for about 19 people. Service was at first a little slow  but I think they thought we were waiting for more friends to show up. Everything was fine with our orders - I loved the huge variety of the menu and the super reasonable prices! Again  we were a huge party on a Friday evening  and the staff was attentive and friendly with drinks and orders. A party of 19 isn't an every day case so I was super pleased when everything went smoothly for my boyfriend's birthday surprise.
Seth C.,Suffern  NY,169,27,9,11/13/2015,4.0,Menu is creative and delicious. My blue martini and my wife's pink cadilac were delicious. The lettuce wraps were good and the southern fried chicken was great. My wife had the North Atlantic Salmon and the vegis were slightly undercooked but the salmon was very good. Server was friendly and knowledgeable.
Lori W.,New City  NY,33,31,,3/4/2015,3.0,BJs is your typical type of restaurant chain  similar to Dave and Busters.I had a burgers and a salad and 2 glasses of Pinot Grigio. Service a tiny bit above average same with food so hence the 3 star rating.
Robert P.,Deer Park  TX,0,4,,9/25/2016,5.0,I will make this short and sweet. I was very impressed with the service I received at the bar. The place was getting busy for Sunday football and the bartender  Nicole  never missed a beat. She kept up with everything thrown her way even though she was the only one making drinks for the entire place.I will definitely come back here.
Elizabeth R.,Teaneck  NJ,13,116,41,2/4/2016,4.0,This is one of my favorite local spots mostly because it is one of the only places open late (until 1 am). The place is pretty big so if there is a wait it usually isn't long  but it's an awesome place to go watch a game  have dinner or just hang out at the bar area.
Dylan D.,Saddle River  NJ,0,6,,9/12/2016,5.0,Really enjoyed our meal  drinks  and the service. Convenient location  decent variety to pick from for food and tons of beers. We were unsure of what we wanted and our waiter let us sample a couple of their brews before we selected. Service was friendly and quick and the meal was reasonably priced. Would definitely eat here again!
Paul A.,New City  NY,74,18,,6/25/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,"went again tonight for the $2.00 off appetizers... almost didn\'t get it. our waitress never mentioned the $2.00 off apps were during happy hour  before 6pm. we were there about 605pm  we specifically asked for the $2.00 off apps... she said ""no problem"" then  when we asked for the check... they didn\'t deduct the $2.00!! then  i even had to ask for the manager... she even gave me this attitude  not even apologetic... if you want to try their hidden promos..make sure you read the fine print.."
John F.,Las Vegas  NV,0,4,,3/7/2016,3.0,While the food ok and the pizza is different than some of the local places I was so disappointed by the service. They need to have a better check in system. I used the app and it said that there was no wait. I got there and still had to wait. The hostess did nothing to help and actually made my wait longer. When I finally sat down the beer list was good and long and the beer was cold. The pizza was delicious yet more expensive than local places. So the determining factor on a return will be how bad I want a craft beer.
Angelique B.,Nanuet  NY,0,4,,3/5/2016,2.0,So disappointed!!! We ordered 3 steaks and ask for med well. Came back rare!!! Ask the waiter to take it back and have it cook more still came back rare didn't have that much flavor what a huge disappointment thinking about not coming back. We used to love the place but lately every time we go these days it's been not good.Not happy
John J.,Mount Kisco  NY,3,23,1,9/15/2015,5.0,Just stopped by for drinks and a quick bite last week. I have to say the service was quick and friendly and my drink packed a kick. I enjoyed my burger the location has ample parking. It's kid friendly  and the decor is smooth and comfortable. This is definitely a good spot to relax and unwind.
Angel A.,Fort Lee  NJ,1,13,5,11/24/2015,1.0,Warning avoid this place like axe cologne. Slow service terrible food. The server was pleasant.
Michele V.,Nanuet  NY,127,11,6,7/30/2015,1.0,Beware: Husband got food poisoning from the Clam Chowder. Since he's traumatized in going back I went with my sister in law and we decided to order some drinks  an appetizer  and to share the main dish. We ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich. We started eating and when my sister in law took a bite and placed the sandwich on her plate she noticed mildew on the bread!! (I will post a picture) The server was not even apologetic  offered to put the fries on a separate plate and take back the sandwich. It wasn't till what felt like forever that the manager came over to offer a replacement. We ordered another appetizer but I was so starving by the time it came we somewhat filled up on fries and our drinks and weren't that hungry anymore. The manager also sent us two drinks and when the bill came they charged us for it! Horrible experience  unsympathetic waitress who then rushed us to pay  and the manager wasn't even on top of resolving it by making sure the check was adjusted. Never going back again.
Kathy J.,Nanuet  NY,0,6,,2/28/2016,5.0,This is my favorite restaurant. I'm addicted to the Mediterranean tacos  and the Brussels sprouts appetizer. I was there Thursday night  and our server  Jaz was great. He was polite and personable and anticipated our requests before we even had to ask. Excellent!
Matthew B.,Nanuet  NY,1,1,,10/4/2015,5.0,*** Ignore bad reviews!!! ***Spacious  quiet  delicious  fast  friendly  fantastic!Our server Monica was awesome. Friendly and knew all about the Many beers on tap! Root beer BBQ ribs were great  so we're the wings  and the deep dish pizza!Prices were not bad at all for drinks and food. Happy hour deals are great and all day Sunday! We are locals  and we will be back.
Michael S.,West Bronx  NY,21,11,30,4/8/2015,4.0,Nice open spacious. The service was excellent and the everything came out promptly. Ordered the pizza  salad wraps  and avocado egg rolls and they were very good for the price. I ordered during happy hour  the mojito was weak but the beer was good. Will go back for the pizza. So tasty and firmly doughy. The texture is like a perfectly cooked Red Barrons pizza on steroids. AWESOME!
Kristine L.,Thiells  NY,1,3,1,8/8/2015,1.0,I should preface by saying that I have 3 kids under three and for us  timing is everything. I came in and asked the receptionist how long the wait was  after asking how many of us and do we need high chairs (yes)  she responds 15 minutes. After 25 minutes  kids starting to get antsy  I go back in and she explains that we were specifically waiting for a table to accommodate the high chairs. I told her I didn't know that  I will take a booth if it expedites the process. She said we will sit next. Fine. After 5 minutes I see an outside sitting open up  I go back in and tell her we WANT that table  potentially screaming kids away from a crowd  sound like a sweet deal. She said she'll get it cleaned. Long story short  she forgets to mention its self seating  had I known this I would've guarded that table like a hawk...of course we lose it to another customer. I go in to complain  by this time it's already been 40 minutes of total waiting  spoke to a manager  who did really nothing but smirk and say I'm sorry. End of story  we sat smack in the middle of the dining room after 40 minutes of waiting  waited for our food another 20-30 minutes  even though we ordered right when we sat. You would think  they would at least get the kids food out asap. By the time the food comes out  kids are freaking out since they see food - but guess what  no utensils on the table. Is that not restaurant 101? Utensils on the table? Oh and the manager - he never came back to see how we were doing. The waiter seemed distracted  was a bit sarcastic  bordering rude. The receptionist  ugh  attitude problem. Great service recovery  really. It's unfortunate  since the food was good....but service was poor and unprofessional.
Alicia K.,Monroe  NY,1,46,,1/22/2016,5.0,I have been here twice and had a great experience both times.The service was excellent and so was the food. They have a big menu and their prices are fair. I had the ribs  which were great  and a beer that was paired with it  which I really enjoyed. My friends also enjoyed their meals. The only complaint I have about the food is that the flat bread pizza appetizer was very dry because the toppings were so sparse  we had to ask for extra sauce. I like the atmosphere  but it is just a little bit too dark.All in all  it's a fun place to visit with great food and service! I highly recommend!
Jordan S.,New City  NY,2,35,,12/29/2015,4.0,Much better than 3 stars! They make their own beer and have a wide selection  so that alone is worth 4 stars in my book. Also the sourdough bread bowls are amazingly tasty. The bread is perfectly toasted every time and they go the extra step of turning the bowl cover/top roasted garlic bread. I can't make a trip here without ordering the New England clam chowder. Fries are really good and crispy  pizza is very good  so are the burgers (especially the sliders- and I never order sliders) and many other items. The only time I was underwhelmed was when I ordered a Cajun pasta that just wasn't spicy enough  but otherwise pretty good.
David S.,Manhattan  NY,0,7,12,2/10/2016,3.0,It's ok for a beers the food is not that great.. But it's a chain so you know that going into it.
Briella B.,Deer Park  NY,0,25,25,12/21/2015,5.0,I love the atmosphere of this place. Cool place to come and hangout for lunch or dinner with friends. Awesome selection of beers and ale's and good food.
David M.,Haverstraw  NY,19,30,4,12/15/2015,4.0,Stopped in for lunch the other day and ate at the bar. Received excellent and friendly service from the bartender. The 2 BJs beers (Jeremiah Red & Tatonka Stout) I had were pretty great and on lunch special. Ordered the Roasted Chicken and Spinach Quinoa Bowl  which was a good portion size for lunch. It was a nice quiet place to enjoy a break from shopping and the service was quick and painless. Can't ask for much more.
Talha A.,College Point  Queens  NY,71,208,271,7/29/2015,4.0,good appetizers and small plate choices  great to share. pizookie trio was really good  good selection of cookies and ice creams to mix and match.
Diane M.,Harrington Park  NJ,0,4,,6/30/2016,5.0,Food is fantastic and service is great! We were offered to sample the new summer beer and took the waiter up on it. If you're a craft ale type person or a beer lover  you will love this place. We shared the honey srirachia brussels sprouts and the crispy portobello mushroom sticks appetizer. Both were bursting with flavor! Then we had summer salad with fresh watermelon and feta which was delicious. Next time  I hope I have room to order an entree!
william c.,Newark  DE,89,29,1,12/1/2015,4.0,Great little spot  good beer  good jambalaya and pretty decent service. A little slow but still decent.
John D.,New City  NY,0,26,5,2/6/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Always a good meal. This time it was lunch  most times its dinner. Friendly staff and excellent management team
Savannah C.,Albany  NY,47,49,13,6/17/2015,2.0,"Eh. Just Eh. Drinks (strawberry margarita) are TERRIBLY watered down  even for a light drinker like myself .. The cajun chicken pasta was oversalted  with that being its only ""flavor."" Prices weren\'t too bad  might try it one more time..."
Eugene A.,Cumming  GA,38,3,,8/6/2015,2.0,Have been sitting here in the restaurant for 20 minutes now without even an acknowledgement from a server to even offer to bring drinks. I have to imagine it will only go down hill from here.
Minna G.,New City  NY,1,31,1,12/2/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Very nice hangout spot. We come in for happy hour weekdays 3-6 and the food/service is on point! Love the pizookie and appetizers!
Spanky S.,New City  NY,8,103,2,9/8/2015,5.0,I don't understand some of the negative reviews of this place. The food is awesome  the beer and drink selections are amazing and the service is absolutely fine. We have been here several times and whether we order a bunch of appetizers or the complete dinners  we have always been more then satisfied with the food. The service is professional and attentive. Keep in mind this is a chain type restaurant  you aren't coming here for fine dining. The negative reviewers need to relax  sip their beer and enjoy.
Molly M.,New City  NY,36,20,1,2/27/2015,2.0,"BJ\'s Brewhouse in Nanuet opened February 3rd 2015. I went for the 1st time February 27th and by my observation they are still in a learning phase which is unacceptable for a restaurant that is a chain. Being in Food Srv Mgnt front and back of house for many years and have been 1st hand a at openings  I know the extensive training that is required for all staff to be universally skilled and knowledgeable w/ all of the menu items as well as drinksWe arrived at 6 PM on a Friday and it had a moderate amount of guests already seated. However  the hostess could not take anyone\'s names because she could not access how long the wait time was without a manager\'s assistance. There was a line of people who were already there and people who had just arrived. This created a bit of havoc as to who was next to give their names. When my fiance went to the bar to order a Sauvingon Blanc which is on their menu the bartender went to look at their beers and then was told its a wine not a beer and his reply was  ""We don\'t have that"" I went to tell the manager that the bartender has no idea what Sauvignon Blanc or that you even sell it and all I was told was ""Oh okay"" I feel a managers\' job is to remedy a situation at least with an apology and that he would take care of this. This lack of apathy in management is not encouraging. My fiance then asked if he could make a Chocolate Martini ( which is not on menu) but not a difficult drink to make if you are a bartender in a bigger  trendier place. His response was  ""I could but we ran out of Godiva"" This is ineffective ordering of on a Friday at 6 PM when you run out of a liquor that might not have been able to make my drink but it also will not make any other drink on their menu either. Our waiter was sincere  welcoming and friendly. I ordered a chocolate raspberry beer which i pointed to on the menu  and my fiance ordered the Sauvignon Blanc. The waiter came back moments later and asked me to show him where the beer was on the menu. I asked the server if he was with them from the beginning and he said yes. I asked if they trained him on the menu and his answer was  "" There are so many items my head is ready to blow up""The drinks took about 10-15 mins to arrive. When the drinks did arrive my fiance was give a red wine. This mishap was corrected. But waiting that long and seeing only 3 bartenders for the size of the place is an accident waiting to happen in terms of wait time and errors. I ordered the fish taco\'s with tomato salsa and an avocado cream sauces on the side accompanied by fresh and crispy tortilla chips. Very tasty and presented well on the plate. My fiance ordered the rack of baby back ribs  mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. The meat was falling off the bone and the sweet BBQ sauce tasted delicious and house made. The potato\'s were dry and the Brussel sprouts were very small and overcooked.Over all I feel whatever regional manager they sent to prepare  train and motivate the staff should be retrained himself. A restaurant which is a chain has a reputation to uphold in management  training  and that manager should not leave until he is assured that the staff is up to par. BJ\'s Resturant and Brewhouse you clearly are not ready to serve anyone. Please pass this place up when choosing to go out to eat."
Juan S.,Hillsdale  NJ,2,15,1,10/25/2015,4.0,The food was good the jambalaya was excellent as always. There with a party of 12 and they did well considering we all came in at different times. The staff was courteous.
Sabrina H.,Suffern  NY,139,52,33,2/29/2016,5.0,I've always wanted to try this restaurant and since I was looking for a new place to celebrate my birthday  I decided it was time. We got in around 5 pm with no wait time (I made reservations for 20 people) and the restaurant was packed. We ordered the siracha boneless chicken  Santa Fe egg rolls  avocado rolls  and calamari for appetizers. Everything tasted great. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and my hubby ordered the Deep Dish Ziti. Both were delicious. I didn't hear any complaints from any of my guests about their food. Everyone loved what they ordered. It was time for dessert and I ordered the Ghirardelli Pizookie. When it arrived  I was disappointed that I didn't see a birthday candle in it. Two seconds later  they surprised me with the famous chocolate chunk Pizookie with a birthday candle in it! It tasted much better than the one I ordered. I would definitely order that next time! It was divine! As soon as the waiters and my guests starting singing happy birthday  everyone else in the entire restaurant started singing happy birthday to me! It was priceless! The waiters were so attentive and courteous. They checked on us many times to make sure we were okay. The manager  Stanley  also made sure we were having a good time. Thank you to BJs for making my birthday special and a memorable one! I will be back!
Christina N.,Glen Oaks  NY,498,186,134,5/20/2015,4.0,I have to say the waitress was so friendly and accommodating. She allowed me and my uncle to taste their homemade brews before actually ordering one. We asked for recommendations and they were great. The thin/flat bread pizza is so tasty and flavorful. The stuffed mushrooms were delicious. Each dish was so good from deep dish pizza  flat pizza  salads.
Maire B.,Nanuet  NY,9,61,,11/10/2015,1.0,First of all  it was a cloudy day when my five friends and I were squeezed into a small booth  when the place was 3/4 empty and there were plenty of other tables where we could have been seated. I faced the three friends opposite me  but with the poor lighting above and the huge window behind them I found it hard to see any of their silhouetted faces even though the sky behind them was so dark and dreary.. My hamburger was not medium rare. It was dry and tasteless. The friend opposite me ordered a chicken over quinoa  I believe and said it was gross. The others who ordered burgers and a salmon dish said they were just ok. So much for BJ'S. Oh  the fries and coffee was good  served in huge mugs. One star. Sorry.
Karen P.,Paramus  NJ,20,21,2,5/17/2015,1.0,Horrible food. My husband ordered the ahi tuna appetizer in poki sauce. No flavor no sauce. I ordered the buffalo burger med rare with everything on the side. Nothing on the burger of course it came with everything on the burger. Sent it back waited 20 minutes for a new one that one came so well done I could have thrown it and it would have bounced. I couldn't even cut it. Sent it back and after being ther an hour left with nothing to eat. My son had the Parmesan chicken that was okay. Artichoke appetizer was just okay. Service was very very slow. Waitress was very pleasant did the best she could to please. Never would eat here again. Bad experience.
Sc S.,West Nyack  NY,0,3,,6/27/2016,4.0,Went there for dinner with my husband and three kids. Ages 17 11 and 9 for the first time Saturday 6/25/16. Sam was our waitress and she was wonderful. We will definitely ask for her next time we visit. In fact from hostess to servers  everyone was friendly. The food was very good and priced well. We had the brisket sandwich  hamburger  shrimp tacos and kids pizza. Overall my family gave a it a thumbs up.
Gregory S.,Norwalk  CT,59,8,,2/28/2015,1.0,I have tried to enjoy their food but it is an abomination. On their first day opening  I tried their Fritos Nachos  which were stale  and not just a little stale  but they seemed to be from a bag opened weeks earlier. How this is possible is anybody's guess. The jambalaya although spicy lacked seasoning aka salt  which is a common theme with their subpar food. Their California Chicken sandwich also lacked any semblance of salt  otherwise known as flavor. The french fries were soggy and poorly seasoned. Also  their pizza is on par with a middle school's cafeteria pizza. Perhaps people in other states like unseasoned food  but this place is not fit for NY.
Pattie G.,Fort Lee  NJ,1,14,,4/24/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,We sat at the bar today and had great service and great food. The bartender was attentive an knowledgeable. She really knew the beers they served  and made great recommendations. The food was awesome. The prices were very reasonable  we had two sandwiches  two beers and an ice-tea for less than $40.
Ko I.,Westwood  NJ,0,2,,4/30/2016,5.0,This is our second time here in a week. Tasty dishes and fast service. Our server was very courteous as well. Prices were reasonable. Although we did not have enough time for dessert  the selection looks great. We used to default to the Grand Lux restaurant at the Garden State Mall  but this place is much better IMO. Looking forward to dining here again.
Paul K.,Manhattan  NY,1,70,,11/30/2015,2.0,Typical chain restaurant and brew house. The food is average at best and the beer sucks. I tried some of there house brews and was highly disappointed. I wasn't expecting anything great when I walked in so I wasn't that disappointed. The decor is nice if you like a wide open space  it's like eating in a fish bowl. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone I know.
Marc L.,New City  NY,1,7,1,6/24/2015,5.0,Awesome atmosphere  delicious food and fair prices. Sriracha Brussel sprouts were amazing.  Kaylyn was friendly and helpful.
MIchael V.,Nanuet  NY,109,11,,11/21/2015,5.0,Great food and good service . I enjoyed watching the football games on the TV screens that surround the walls.
Sarah O.,Hoboken  NJ,131,90,,3/23/2015,5.0,Food and service was amazing! My friend had the buffalo wings and I had the sliders. They had accidentally put ketchup on my burgers but they were extremely nice and apologetic by making new ones immediately. The manager also had made a point to apologize which I thought was extremely professional and they removed it off the check. Extremely convenient since it is in the Nanuet mall - great place to go to before or after a movie - I will definitely be coming back to BJ's!
David T.,Brooklyn  NY,714,90,64,4/7/2015,2.0,Beautiful building.... the food is good.. but not impressive... the beer selection is killer.. the service is not up to par... seriously lacking.. everyone there acted as if they had something else better to do than be at work....maybe it is a off night i am not sure but for this being my first time i am not impressed
Marc F.,New City  NY,84,19,3,2/26/2015,2.0,The service is horrible. The entire staff (minus the kitchen) is between the ages of 18-24 and this is clearly their first or second serving gig. The food is very average but expensive for what it is. I will not be back though I don't see this place sticking around as it has the Rockland County failing restaurant curse written all over it.
Robert A.,Rochelle Park  NJ,18,114,5,3/18/2015,4.0,"Went for a lunch and found it to be very good. Although there was some kind of problem finding something on the computer( advanced reservation or club membership) which tied up all the hostesses for a few minutes for a couple ahead of me the seating was reasonably fast. The food was tasty and not overly priced although the ""pizza"" they make is nothing like the ""normal"" pizza found in this area. The atmosphere is a large cavernous warehouse but   maybe because its brand new. the place was clean and relatively quiet. Looking forward to going back to try some more dishes."
Dan S.,Bardonia  NY,2,31,4,7/19/2015,4.0,Went in for lunch the other day and had a very pleasant experience. Lots of beers to choose from  short of a Yard House experience  but still more than enough to keep your interest. Ordered the BBQ brisket burger  service was prompt  and the meal was delicious and very proportional as I didn't bust a gut to finish.
John O.,Ala Moana  Honolulu  HI,56,4,1,3/29/2015,3.0,Food is always good....WORST SERVICE EVER! Worse than Chili's  which is saying something (in my opinion).
S O.,Congers  NY,0,2,,2/13/2016,1.0,"Came in on a Saturday night for a family dinner and waited an extra 45 minutes after calling in a reservation for the ""wait list"" 30 minutes before showing up. The staff including the manager was very unorganized. Not worth the wait  do not see myself coming back."
Robert R.,New Canaan  CT,0,24,,3/23/2015,4.0,Great food for the price point. Appetizers are huge. Beer is on point. BJ's is a restaurant chain based in Southern California. They've finally decided to put a few locations on the east coast  and it should do well. If you're at the mall  it's a great place to come with the family to grab some food  either lunch or dinner. The bar area is great if you're just looking for a place to have a beer or two and watch the game.Their specialty is the deep dish pizza  but it's average at best coming from NY. It probably translates better out west where local pizza joints are tough to come by. But if you order an entree  or a burger/sandwich  you will not be disappointed. Think of it like a Friday's with way better food and a better vibe.
Peter M.,Nyack  NY,43,14,31,5/2/2016,5.0,BJ's not only has a great selection of food  but an awesome selection of beer as well. They also switch out different beers to always try to have something new and great for you to try. The food is good and I personally like the pulled pork sandwich and the deep dish pizza! Also  don't forget about the pizookie for dessert. Great place for dinner with friends or to bring the family.
Jen B.,Rosedale  Queens  NY,4,18,7,2/24/2015,3.0,The food is good but you will be seated for 20mins before a waiter even comes to you. Came here on a Tuesday night & sat & waited for 20 mins before a waiter even acknowledged out presence.
Patrick O.,Hackensack  NJ,29,25,3,3/19/2016,4.0,Food and service was very good. They were very busy only had to wait about 5 minutes. The only reason why I'm leaving four stars was because there was a hair on the first potato skin I reached for.
Darwin D.,Nanuet  NY,152,16,1,5/10/2015,4.0,Food's great so does the choices for beers. Just a bit expensive so don't be surprise when it comes to prices.
Ann P.,West Nyack  NY,10,55,13,6/11/2015,3.0,I always have a nice time there  but every single time I've gotten the impression that they were trying to rush you out of there!! My friend and I were not even nearly finished with our meal or drinks and they already asked if we wanted boxes to pack up our meal! Every time!
Danni Z.,New City  NY,48,4,,1/26/2016,4.0,We are frequent visitors (although it has been about a month since our last visit) and we tried some new items (light Clementine drink  wings  Sriracha Brussel Sprouts  chili) which were excellent. The food never disappoints. But don't forget to try Pumpkin Ale  Jambalaya  Deep Dish Pizza  Chicken Lettuce Wraps  and the entire Enlightened Menu. So many choices  all excellent!
Keila B.,Nyack  NY,40,160,65,5/17/2015,3.0,Went to BJ's for an early lunch one Sunday. It wasn't crowded and we were able to sit outside. Overall the food was good but not incredibly inspired. I had one of their fun drinks: it was some sort of Jack Daniel's blueberry lemonade concoction. It was good. Right amount of alcohol. I had the Corn Fritters with Bacon Aioli as an appetizer. They were ok except for the fact that they were a little mushy/underdone in the very middle. There could have been a little more aioli. The mister had the Fritos Nachos. Again  good  but not out of this world. The chili was average and I like how it was served in a deep dish casserole thing. Cute. For my entree I had the French Dip sandwich. It was very good and the portion was generous enough without being obnoxiously huge. It came with skinny fries and they were really good. I'm a French fry aficionado so I judge. These passed muster. My man had the watermelon feta salad. He liked it although he later regretted getting something so light because he was hungry. I was full from my meal so he had the second half of my sandwich.My munchkin had the cheese pizza from the kids' menu and she ate most of it so I'll say it was good.Service was attentive and friendly. Would I go again? Not really sure. Although it wasn't bad  it wasn't amazing enough to get me to rush back there.
Mike J.,Nanuet  NY,33,4,1,2/26/2015,2.0,"Here for my first time  late lunch 1330 by myself. For whatever reason I came in the back door  by the take out. It was probably a parking issue more than anything else. The girl at the back door was a little troubled that I had come in the ""pickup"" door but did walk me to the front desk where an enthusiastic young lady said sit anywhere you would like. Nice. This is where it starts to go wrong and I start looking for my phone to read how this place has been doing. You know when you have been sitting there waiting so long that you start thinking about walking out. Thats how long. Its like a quest now. 10 employees of all kinds are walking by. Not a word. Now I have been here a full 20 minutes  no drink  no meeting of the ""server"".  Finally a young girl says hello  I am staring at the TV running some old football show so long that she startled me. She inquiries if this was my first trip to BJs. I indicated it was She goes into a memorized beer pitch  which just by my body language alone she realized that it was time to get down to brass tacks. I ordered food and drink  which came very quickly  was good and fresh. I have never heard of a BJs brewhouse before coming here but I am sure there is a GREAT one somewhere. So great in fact that some smart guy desided to copy it in Nanuet NY. The only problem is that there is no culture of employee here. I am sure at some point they will figure it out  or this place will be gone. If you go leave extra time.."
Jimmy R.,New York  NY,32,4,2,4/19/2015,5.0,First time here  stop before during my last service call. Sat at the bar and had Alicia as my server. Asked her what was good on the menu  she recommended chicken sandwich with salad. Great choice and service. I would come back here again.
Jacqui A.,Nanuet  NY,0,19,,8/19/2015,5.0,U absolutely had a great time here. Excellent choices of beer matched with food  healthy meals  kid's menu.. Sports and good music on. Lots of fun! Friendly staff! Highly recommend!!!!
Jamie V.,New City  NY,13,2,1,8/9/2015,5.0,Let me start by saying that I work in the industry. Going to this restaurant reminded me why I love my job so much. It's an amazing feeling going out to eat and leaving satisfied with absolutely no complaints and that's what happened today. Great food  impeccable service and just an overall great experience.
Charlie L.,Orangeburg  NY,1,122,27,8/9/2015,3.0,Went here twice and it was A OK. Will be back. Nothing spectacular but was good. First time I went was with some coworkers and we ordered mainly burgers with beers. Speaking of which they had a great selection of beers. It was good enough that I went back with my family and overall it was acceptable again. The atmosphere was great  especially for watching a game while you chow down on some food.Im not going to get into nitty gritty this time because nothing really stood out. We will be back though. Haven't tried the PF changs next door but judging from the yelpers there  I wouldn't want to wait 1hr for my food which did not happen at BJ brewhouse. The food came fairly quickly both times and the service was fine.
Jennifer H.,Nanuet  NY,0,7,,2/15/2015,1.0,I think they rushed to open and the staff is far from ready. We did the call ahead reservations only to show up and see a mob in the entry way. The call ahead system crashed so everyone was ready to riot. We waited about 30 minutes for our table. Our waiter was friendly but not very knowledgeable. It took 10 minutes for drinks. Another 15 to get our beers and place our appetizer order. Appetizers were ok. Meals came but they forgot my husbands salad. When we ordered a second round of beers it took another 15 minutes  only to find out they ran out of the beer I ordered  so I waited another 10 for that. Dinners were ok.. sounded better on paper. We ordered 2 desserts. My daughters came in a reasonable time. We waited 25 minutes for the waiter to tell my husband that there was a problem with his.. and then another 10-15 minutes for the manager to come out and basically say we were out of luck. I will not be returning anytime soon.Also.. bring a coat. Very cold inside.
Rachel C.,Schenectady  NY,0,2,,4/27/2016,1.0,I was going on a date and decided that BJ's would be a great place to meet. We were promptly greeted and seated. The hosts were lovely. Then our waitress (Kaylyn M) came over quickly and asked us if we would like a beverage. We put our orders in for drinks and then put in order for appetizers and dinner. When our appetizer arrived (wings)  we still did not have napkins or silverware and or waitress quickly left and we did not have time to ask her. The waitress in the section next to us realized and asked if we needed something and she got us some. Then  as soon as we got napkins and silverware  our entrees arrived. So by the time we ate our wings  our entrees were cold. Our glasses sat empty for our meals. The waitress never asked how our meals were. She never cleared the plates  I had to ask twice. Then after twenty minutes of waiting with the dessert menu from the table open in front of me  the dirty dishes pushed to the end of the table  and the empty glasses put where she could see  she asked if we would like dessert. Not only did I have to ask for boxes  refills  and the plates cleared  but she managed to drop the check right after she brought the desserts out. We weren't even near halfway done. Meanwhile  in all our spare time sitting at our dirty table  we had a lovely view of the kitchen  which contained five staff in which we were able to count eating off the line. We managed to get a video and pictures. Two staff were eating ribs  one eating french fries and I'm not sure what the other were munching on  looked delicious though. I do not think I want to return with service and uncleanliness like this  even though I enjoyed the food.
N G.,Suffern  NY,1,6,9,2/29/2016,4.0,For a chain restaurant not bad  deep dish pizza is a must  alcoholic drink was on the weak side. Service was good.
Ian W.,Manhattan  NY,7,4,2,4/22/2015,4.0,I have been here twice and both times I had a great experience. The beers are good even though I m not a brew expert. Food was great and my kids loved the pizza. I would definitely return.
Gary M.,Spring Valley  NY,1,12,,2/4/2015,2.0,"Well  the place is new so that can say a few things. That being that the service is trying but needs a lot of help. Our waitress was very sweet. However she forgot our appetizer and immediately brought our main dishes. Those were taken back  the appetizer appeared and again  10 minutes later they brought out the main dishes. Half our apps still in front of our faces. The manager came over soon thereafter and stated "" We opened only 2 days ago. Maybe on the third we\'ll get things right."" (I\'m giggling right now thinking of how ridiculous a statement that was.)There was one redeeming factor though....Tuesday nights wine is half price. At they\'re regular selling price  taking 50% off  made it very cheap."
Eileen D.,Pearl River  NY,27,2,,2/23/2016,5.0,Went for late lunch and our waitress Holly was very friendly and helpful with our selections. She also remembered us from a previous visit. It's nice to have a server who is social with return customers!
Michael H.,Wayne  NJ,0,2,,2/23/2016,5.0,Love this place... I visit BJ's everytime I travel to AZ now there is one near home. Can't wait till the one in Teterboro opens!!
Natalie Dawn T.,Pomona  NY,1,4,,10/4/2015,5.0,I am really not sure why this place got bad reviews because this place is awesome! I'm so glad my husband and I decided to ignore what others have said and give it a try. Our server  Monica was really friendly  really taking the time to explain the Happy Hour menu and even gave us tips about what apps were cheaper on that menu than the full price one. She knew a lot about beer and gave us her critique on what was good. Her suggestion on the Nutty Brewnette was spot on! Plus the food was actually very food. We loved the deep dish pizza and Root Beer wings and ribs. The ribs were so good  my husband didn't even share! But that's OK by me because I loved the Lemon Pepper rub wings. Despite the multiple TVs with Sunday Football and Baseball on and a sizeable dinner crowd  the environment was cool. It was quiet enough to have a conversation with your date. Finally  while the ambiance was relaxing  the food was good and Monica's fast and friendly service was the star  just about every server we came in contact with was just as friendly and warm. So its safe to say that BJ's is gonna be the place that knows our names because this will be our new date night place for a while.
Jude S.,Nyack  NY,0,32,,3/8/2015,4.0,It's still in it's learning phase but the food is your regular restaurant food. The flatbreads are better than the pizza. Pizza needs more marinara but still tasty. My server desmond was extremely friendly and got everything to us on time. Try the watermelon and feta salad..
Christy W.,Pearl River  NY,0,20,2,3/25/2015,5.0,Wonderful experience at BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse this evening. Admittedly my expectations were low after reading reviews from fellow yelpers. Coupled with the fact that this is a chain I was ho-hum about going here  but the boyfriend wanted to check it out so off we went.Let me say that we had none of the issues with service that others have experienced. Every single employee we encountered was friendly and welcoming. Our server  Eric  was one of the best waiters we've had in recent memory. Aside from being a genuinely nice guy  he was extremely attentive and helpful; his menu recommendations were spot on.Thanks to Eric I tried the Deep Dish Vegetarian Pizza and Lightswitch Lager. Both were excellent and worthy of 5 stars. My b/f had the Carnitas Fries w/ Chile Verde and Blackened Shrimp Tacos  and he was also very pleased with his meal.It seems the kinks have been worked out with whatever issues this place may have had previously. I suggest you give it a try!
N H.,Nanuet  NY,1,7,,8/25/2015,2.0,Slow  slow service. Serving staff that could care less about your wait time. Less then average food quality. Although pizza was okay. Took about an hour to get it! Definitely the type of blah place you wander into on vacation in Florida. But really has no purpose in an upscale shopping mall.
Christine S.,Suffern  NY,28,4,,4/11/2015,4.0,Went here last Monday for dinner. Nice atmosphere and great food. Our server - Samantha - was fantastic. The draft beer selection is incredible - must try Jeremiah Red! Pizza was delicious! Food overall was good. Only issue - my steak was over seasoned so next time I will request to have less seasoning. Great place for a family meal  sports viewing or a casual date night. Will definitely be back!
Alexa T.,Nanuet  NY,1,9,16,11/6/2015,5.0,Affordable  good service  good drinks for a good price. Been here several times  I recommend sitting outside if there are seats available  beautiful fireplace.
Yard L.,Spring Valley  NY,217,9,5,12/14/2015,5.0,I have been to BJ's twice. The first time was amazing but the second time was even better. I never liked avocados  but BJ's made me fall in love with them when I ordered the avacado eggrolls. The flavors  the options  and price point for the amount of food you get is remarkable. This restaurant is always consistant  service is great  food is always on point. Def one of my new local spots.
Meg M.,Wildomar  CA,0,13,2,1/29/2016,5.0,Great staff and management! Foods amazing and great beer options. Must go if you're in Rockland county.
Aaron A.,Gravesend  Brooklyn  NY,0,35,,5/9/2015,2.0,Atmosphere and restaurant environment is very very cool and nice. Service is good. Don't come here other than for a burger n beers lol. And/or drinks. The setting is all that deserves 5 stars.
Mike S.,Hawthorne  NY,1,20,29,4/29/2015,4.0,In all honesty this place was better than I expected to be. I definitely recommend HopStorm(beer). Very Hoppy about it. Goes great with the Exxtra hot wings. I didn't get a full meal as me and my date decided to do appetizers instead. They were all amazing Mac & Cheese  Sliders  Wings  Flat Bread. Staff was very friendly and our waitress was very personable  nice and professional. After we ordered she told us that the good cooks are gone by 10:00pm so the appetizers are a better choice at that time. She was always there but never on top of us. This place is very similar to Yard House. They have a good beer list and lots of TV's. The place was clean.
Rebecca B.,New City  NY,1,20,3,8/24/2015,4.0,Staff was polite. Waited 45 mins for a table on a Saturday night. Food came fast for a filled restaurant.
Reen A.,Saddle River  NJ,1,9,,9/20/2015,2.0,We had a pleasant lunch in the patio one weekend and kids wanted to come back for dinner. Unfortunately a completely different experience; entrees were terrible. Flat bread pizza was on par with frozen pizza  marinara sauce; worse than jar sauce. To top off our meal  we ordered the Pizookie trio dessert which had marinara sauce baked into it. Horrible! Management did stop by to apologize  made another dessert and comped the dessert when the bill arrived . With So many choices in the casual dining category; we will not be coming back to BJs.
Linda S.,Morris Plains  NJ,4,7,,8/31/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Horrible service... couldn't even have the opportunity to rate the food. Cute place and vibe but that was about it. Arrive approximately 1:40p and waited 5minutes to be seated... no biggie. Perused the menu and got excited about our choices. Then proceeded to sit at the table with menus closed for 20 minutes. Nobody approached us to ask for drinks. Nobody approached us to ask if were being helped. Any service people that passed us didn't see our attempt to flag them down. Finally at 2:10 we got up and just left hungry. such a disappointment.
Michael B.,Nashville  TN,0,12,1,10/27/2015,5.0,Always loved BJS ever since trying it in LA. Great food for a large restaurant. Huge selection of food and drinks. It's a fun  loud place so be prepared.
Lauren R.,New City  NY,2,16,4,12/11/2015,1.0,One might consider this place a bust...the waiter super nice and said everything on the menu was fantastic...i beg to differ...can definitely tell that this is a chain restaurant by the quality of the food. The food was quite processed. The chicken seemed to be more lime pressed particle meat rather than chicken breast. Sent back both of the adult entres and left hungry.
Dan B.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,1,2/16/2015,2.0,"BJs obviously needed more time before opening. The wait staff was very obnoxious - interrupting us every 2 minutes with ""how is everything?"" Even when we had nothing in front of us! It was rude and felt like they were trying to rush us out. The shrimp scampi pasta was tasteless  had way too much pasta and just a few burnt shrimp. Have been to other BJs across the country that were very good - Nanuet just needs to work out the kinks."
Sharon A.,West Nyack  NY,0,4,,1/5/2016,2.0,When this place first opened the food was excellent and the Happy Hour was great! Sad to see that it has really gone downhill in a short amount of time. Servers seem bored to be interacting with customers  food quality has gone down while the prices go up.
Aragus T.,Mount Kisco  NY,0,6,,12/28/2015,3.0,The drinks where good but the food was meh. I did enjoy the atmosphere and the service was cool but its very difficult to get past the fact that the food was not really that good.
Thomas B.,Congers  NY,31,7,,12/3/2015,4.0,We have eaten there a few times and really liked it. The only problem is if you get take out check your order. We have twice and both times we didnt get what we ordered which is frustrating when you live 8 miles away
Daniel J.,Bridgewater  NJ,0,87,1,3/12/2015,1.0,The bottle beer was good. Service was so-so. Ordered the ribeye. Not much flavor and squished thin. The asparagus was so thin and over cooked  you could wrap around a fork like a noodle. Avocado egg rolls are good. Don't get the Poki if you've ever had it in HI. You'll be insulted. Again  the bottle beer was good.
Michelle A.,Burlington  MA,0,26,24,9/23/2015,4.0,Got the 2 for $25 deal! Chili made with beer and a delicious bleu cheese salad. Then the classic deep dish pizza with pepperoni  sausage and mushroom. Very delicious ! A warm chocolate chunk cookie with creamy vanilla ice cream. What a deal and we will return with friends !
Roger B.,Briarcliff Manor  NY,1,37,10,4/30/2015,3.0,I think the food is pretty good. They also have a really good selection of root beers (fresh made) and good pizza.  I enjoyed it all. Service is a bit lacking  but otherwise good.
Mike A.,Nanuet  NY,14,50,,4/29/2015,2.0,I ate here last night in a party of 7 for a birthday celebration. In short  the service is poor  the food is typical mediocre quality chain restaurant food  the beer is good.I made a reservation the day before. This is the first time I've called a restaurant and got a prompt with several menu items. You can't just call the restaurant and get the hostess. You have to listen to a menu prompt. To reserve a party of 7 or more you have to wait for option #5 or 6. Then after selecting the correct option you get what sounds like the hostess anyway. But only the manager can make a reservation of 7 or more. Already I'm annoyed because there is a phone menu prompt that doesnt even bring you to the correct person. I wait on the phone for 10 minutes for the manager and spend another 10 minutes with him to make the reservation and confirm the details  full name and phone number. I'm told if I'm not there within 15 minutes of the reservation we lose our table. I would say thats common knowledge when making a reservation and thats fine but I've never been lectured before. I havent even gotten to the restaurant yet and I'm already annoyed from spending 20+ minutes on the phone to make a simple reservation.Last night  Tuesday at 7pm  the 7 of us arrive at the restaurant. The hostess and manager can't find my reservation. After spending all that time on the phone the day before they don't have my info in the system. Now I'm annoyed because we have to wait to be seated  maybe 10-15 minutes. Luckily it was a Tuesday and not overly crowded. The hostess who lead us to our table seemed to really not want to be there. She half assed reach for a menu and drops it in front of us. My girlfriend hands it to her and she grabs it and keeps walking. She may of said thanks but it wasnt heard by either of us. She leads us to our table and immediately walks away. She doesn't tell us who our waiter/waitress will be or tell us to enjoy our meal. Just walks away before the rest of the party even gets to the table. Our waiter  Mike  was great. He asked us if we dined there before. When we said no he explained the beers and food. He gave us recommendations based on the typical beers we drink. BJ's makes 10 beers they have on their menu full time and had 1 seasonal beer there. I had a sampler of 4 which was plenty of beer for 1 person. All the beers were great and the highlight of the meal.The food was ok. Its in line with Chilis and Olive Garden. Just cheap food to fill you up. Nothing to write home about. I had the thin crust pizza. Others had burgers  salmon  pulled pork and other items. No one really liked their meal but no one hated it.One person's meal had an issue and didn't come out with everyone else. That person had to wait 10 minutes for them to cook him a new dish. Not sure what the issue was but our waiter was very apologetic and very helpful throughout the whole meal.After dinner was finished we walked out with the hostess and manager standing in the front. The manager said good night and that was it. The manager knew we had an issue with the reservation and hopefully would know if a table was missing a dish. For a place that makes their own beer I would have expected a visit from the manager after we seated and offer to buy the birthday person a free beer. Of if they are too cheap to offer a free beer atleast come over and say sorry and check up on us. Just a random side note. The line cooks wear baseball caps instead of hair nets. I didnt see any hair nets showing under the caps. It just seemed odd and worth pointing out. After reading one reviewer stating they had hair in their food and seeing the baseball caps I spent a minute to comb through my pizza before I ate it. To compare similar restaurants  Yard House in the Palisades mall is an awesome restaurant. I ate there several months ago for a birthday celebration  and a few times before that. The whole experience was great (service and food were both really good) and the manager gave the birthday girl a free yard of beer. Customer service really does go a long way. Even with the mediocre food at BJ's if the manager and staff were more professional this would have been a more positive review and they would have had a return customer.
Ari K.,Rye  NY,0,13,,8/20/2015,1.0,Train wreck....so much wrong. They need to get their house in order.  MIsheoom appetizer pretty good. Beet salad good. Need to work on service
Thomas M.,Pearl River  NY,1,10,,3/29/2015,2.0,Funny first two times we were there  service was very good.  This time it was awful .  Waitress actually told us she was taking a 30 min break. Crazy. Unless you are shopping at the Shoppes stay away.
Rebecca F.,Nashville  TN,0,11,,4/7/2015,3.0,The food is really good here  but the service really needs work. I've been here at least 4 times and each time there was always something off. Food took too long to come out or an appetizer would be forgotten. One time my food (soup and salad) came out first and a good 5-10 minutes went by before my friends' food arrived (they ordered salads  so I don't see why it took longer). The waitstaff has always been friendly but something seems to always get mixed up. I would give this place a better rating but they really need to work on their service and tightening things up.
Mike F.,Hillsdale  NJ,22,14,2,6/11/2015,4.0,Amazing pizza  great beer. Good service and excellent atmosphere. Gluten friendly menu with beer to compliment
Marcia B.,New City  NY,0,8,,7/31/2015,2.0,Just went for lunch here. Heard it was good. I ordered the Asian chicken salad. I have never had such a skimpy salad in a restaurant  especially for the price. There were 8 small bite size pieces of chicken  4 mandarin oranges  and a huge bowl of lettuce. I realized after i left that there were no snow peas or carrots as stated on the menu. I am giving it 2 stars because we had a very nice waiter. Not going back so soon.
Ben D.,Devon  PA,1,8,,8/30/2015,3.0,Not a bad place. Had the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. The the atmosphere is fine  the beer selection is excellent.
Cheryl W.,Oakland  NJ,0,6,,2/13/2015,2.0,My boyfriend & I were in the area so we figured we will give this restaurant a try. It is a very beautiful & new restaurant in the area. The service was good  it took a little long to be served but it was busy. My problem was with the quality of the food. We ordered avocado spring rolls for our appetizer which were nothing special. We also shared a deep dish pizza which was unbelievably greasy. Hoped to like it but sad to say we will not be going back.
Coco M.,Nanuet  NY,0,5,,7/14/2015,1.0,Went to the Brewhouse in California and it was great. My husband returned steak which was ordered medium came out well twice. Everyone completed dinner. His steak finally came out and it was completely rare. This was the second time there and service was lousy.
A A.,Nanuet  NY,0,11,,6/29/2015,2.0,We were so excited about BJs opening up in the neighborhood but after going there on five different occasions (with girlfriends  with kids  on a date) the service has consistently been slow and something from our order is always wrong! We kept chalking it up to they are new but it's been a while now and I have yet to see a manager ever come by and try to make a situation right. We thought it was a great place to go for drinks and dinner initially but now after several attempts  we realize it's not worth it.
John D.,Tappan  NY,2,10,,4/11/2015,4.0,Large open space  great food at reasonable prices. Their house beers are excellent. They also serve your basic beers like Bud & Coors etc. Service was great . We were a party of 6 and we put our waiter to the test. He came through with flying colors!!! I recommend the Jambalya!!!
Magda K.,Monsey  NY,0,25,54,4/9/2015,5.0,Great food  great atmosphere  great drinks! Service is always great ! Love the sandwiches  flat breads and awesome salads! And don't forget the dessert pizookie !
LadyL F.,Nanuet  NY,0,5,,5/11/2015,5.0,Had lunch with my boyfriend there on 5/7/15 it was our first time. Great atmosphere the place is nice  and our waitress was very pleasant! The menu had a lot of variety  drinks were great  and at one point the Manager Stanley came over to say hello and suggested a few options. He was friendly  and went above to meet our needs! Will definitely return!!
Eileen M.,Valley Cottage  NY,0,2,,5/5/2015,5.0,This is my third time at BJ's by and I enjoyed it yet again. The service is very good and the food is also great. The manager Stanley even came around to our table and asked us how the food and service was  very rarely have I seen this in other restaurants. I definitely will be returning for the delicious food and wonderful service!
Alexa T.,Pomona  NY,0,2,,2/21/2015,5.0,I love this place!! I went with some friends during opening week and I loved the food. I have gone twice so far. First time I ordered the the Bjs Brewhouse Burger it was juicy and really delicious  I especially loved the crispy thin fries. The second time I ordered the avocado rolls they were nice and crispy and I loved the dipping sauce. I really like the atmosphere great for upcoming sports events since they have tv's all over the restaurant.
Tomas S.,Manhattan  NY,9,141,13,3/31/2015,1.0,bad food. horrible service. food was served almost raw. chicken sandwich with only one piece of chicken. took an hour for food to arrive. unresponsive staff. don't eat here. a total zero. Stanley the restaurant manager laughed at us when we complained. shame on him. he should be fired and this restaurant should be avoided.
Corinne A.,West Nyack  NY,0,11,,10/11/2015,2.0,This place started out awesome. I went there with my family  and got acceptable service and good food. I was so excited to bring my boyfriend here  cause I figured he'd love it. First time we went was just as good as when I went with my family. From there  it has gone completely downhill. Between being ignored for 15 minutes  my food coming out later than his  and being promised a visit from a manager that never came over  I'm pretty over this place. Just because we look young  I don't think it's acceptable that we have had to wait so long to be greeted at our table  we were on the verge of leaving. And the only reason we stayed is because a waiter recognized we were getting mad  and came over to take our drink order. And let me point out: he wasn't even our waiter  he just felt bad. After all this  I sent an email to their company  and never got a response. It's kind of shame to be honest  I had high hopes for this place.
