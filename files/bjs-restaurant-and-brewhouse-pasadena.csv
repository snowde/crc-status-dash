Kelly K.,Pasadena  CA,262,430,128,11/13/2017,4.0,I'm generally a BJ's hater but this location earned some accolades from me. Ordered delivery via Amazon's new food service. BJ's made the food on time but Amazon's driver never showed. The takeout rep called me and informed me of Amazon's fail. I ordered the artichoke hearts appetizer and the crispy chicken salad and didn't want food that was sitting in a hot box so I asked if they would re-make the artichokes before I came to pick up  they agreed and they re-made the salad for me too. They also refunded me in full for the hassle of having to pick up myself. The manager and host were very apologetic when I picked up  much more helpful than most BJ's staff I've encountered! Both my appetizer and salad were delicious. The artichoke hearts had a mild but tasty breading and the dipping sauce was a nice complement. As for the salad  I would have hoped for a bit more fried chicken than I got  but it was well cooked and not too heavily breaded with good lean pieces of chicken within. All the ingredients tasted crisp and fresh  and the honey mustard dressing was the way to go for sure.Parking will be at the Paseo mall. Inside there are lots of TVs for all your sports viewing with a slick  modern and comfortable layout. I'll be returning thanks to the service I received.
Jason Y.,Los Angeles  CA,429,157,529,10/26/2017,4.0,Would I come back? Lately I have been having a craving for pizookis and luckily they are having a special where all their pizookis are $3 until the end of October 2017. I think after that date they still offer this promotion on Tuesdays. All the different pizookis on their menu are fair game for this promotion so eat to your hearts content. Some of the flavors you are able to do half and half. I believe the only flavors you have to do whole are the marshmallow peanut butter s'mores and monkey bread. On two visits I have tried almost all their flavors. I usually come with a group of 4 people and 3 pizookis are more than enough for us to share. My favorites would be the double dark chocolate  peanut butter  chocolate chunk and monkey bread. Each comes with 2 scoops of ice cream on top of the molten cookie. Be warned that they are a little sweet but it is worth the diabetes (in moderation). I am sad that this promotion is coming to an end at the end of the month but luckily they still offer it on Tuesdays.
Diana J.,Pasadena  CA,93,103,12,10/5/2017,4.0,Food is better than yard house and service is usually pretty good. Not noisy like yard house either.  I love their southern friend chicken  monkey bread pazooki is my favorite and they have the best potato skins. Pizza needs a little more sauce  pretty dry. We just tried the hickory brisket burger and it was great. Between their wide variety of food  their service and their mobile app with discounts this place is great.
Koi S.,Los Angeles  CA,229,488,1051,6/13/2017,5.0,Service here is always goodPlace was cleanServers were super attentive and friendly Very helpful as wellDeep dish is a must!!! BBQ chicken and buffalo chicken pizza Yummy!!!! Baked ziti- was ok! Kinda bland but it was still good just put that tapatio to use!
Kim T.,San Gabriel  CA,341,847,5505,5/19/2017,4.0,Decided to pop in here for lunch with some friends  yummy food and great time catching up with some buddies.Parking: Located on the corner of Marengo Ave.  and Colorado Blvd. They on the corner area towards Marengo  if you're coming out of the Pasadena Paseo mall. They don't validate inside the restaurant  but the mall does have a tiny validation station (right next to the two vending machines) right as you're coming up the escalators in their underground parking lot. First 90mins are free  and any time over  you pay the remainder balance. Ambience and dcor wise  it's clean and spacious. Tons of TVs to watch all your favorite sports. Their bar area is gigantic and beautiful - two huge walls of liquor for all hearts' content. Since it was a weekday  it was slow and quiet  which I didn't mind since it was great for catching up.I ended up ordering the Lunch Portion: Sandwich & Soup Entre: California Chicken Club Sandwich+ Vegan Lentil with Ancient Grains Soup.Tyler  our server  brought out my Vegan Lentil with Ancient Grains soup first. I wanted something healthy  and decided to try this out  and I was sure glad that I did! For a vegan dish  it was really hearty! Generous portions of green lentils  ancient grains  tender carrots and onions cooked in a yummy tomato broth. Highly recommended  and I would totally get this again. Doesn't even feel like you're even really eating your veggies and grains ;)Afterwards  came my California Chicken Club Sandwich served with a side of French fries. Since this was the lunch portion  it came with half a sandwich  but it was hearty too! Fresh and layered with Applewood smoked bacon  avocado  melted swiss cheese  lettuce  and tomatoes  served on sourdough bread with roasted garlic aioli spread. The fries itself were crispy  generous and seasoned properly without being super greasy. I've definitely enjoyed my sandwich  and would get it again.Drink: I opted for an unsweetened citrusy green tea drink. I had two glasses  and it was cool and refreshing to enjoy with my meal.Service: Tyler  our server was nice  but somewhat forgetful. With my meal and drinks  he was on point  but with my friends' meals  he was somewhat forgetful. Either he didn't get their meals brought out the same time as the rest of our table  or he forgot utensils for some of them. However  the one big no-no he did - one of my friends requested sweet potato fries with her Caesar salad  and instead got regular French fries. Tyler ended up taking away her French fries  which he shouldn't have. Instead  he should have left them there  and brought her out a new plate of sweet potato fries. Standard restaurant procedures. Overall  despite the service  we still had a good time catching up with each other once we had drinks and food in our tummies. I would still come back here at some point.
Lance H.,Los Angeles  CA,159,108,92,9/14/2017,4.0,I always have a good time at any BJ's location. This time  I ordered the bison burger with a side of sweet potato fries. Nothing outstanding about it  but it was good and packed with protein. I don't usually drink  but this burger would go well with an ice cold beer.
Son G.,Saitama  Japan,233,27,8,10/14/2017,4.0,Great steakhouse. The steak was very tender and all their pizzas and desserts were good. Price was reasonable and their lighting was alright. But Come here when you are not as broke.
Michelle N.,Alhambra  CA,100,277,640,5/27/2017,5.0,Came for my little sisters graduation lunch ! Service was good - food took a while . But I guess that's normal for a party of 25 lolI had the side of chicken breast with asparagus which was good Along with the cauliflower which I thought had good flavor . Taste like curry Avocado egg rolls were delightful as always
Mandi T.,Rosemead  CA,1087,950,1782,8/9/2017,4.0,We visited this in 2014  but here goes....We were looking for some Happy Hour and saw that BJ's had a deal...$4 for all bj craft beers$1 off for rest of the beer$4  $5  $6 appetizer to choose from.Happy hour only in the bar area.Oz was our bartender/server. He's pretty awesome and hope he's still here.Will return! Parking is in a huge lot under the paseo mall.
Christine C.,Torrance  CA,3,89,4,12/5/2017,5.0,Just eaten there a few times. I cook a lot. Very good food and service. You get a lot of food for a decent price. It can get loud and crowded but that's common in a popular restaurant. People like it. I think the one in Lakewood is less crowded. It's really crowded on Mothers Day. Nice salads too.
Adriana K.,Alhambra  CA,235,403,1884,5/23/2017,5.0,Not your typical BJ's. In a former historic bank building  it's a fancy cool place for some good food at reasonable prices. I ate at a $$$ establishment earlier in the day and honestly  I liked my meal here better... and had the same server! I had the salmon dinner with mashed potatoes and broccoli  and at the suggestion of the server  one of their sweet pink ciders. Loved the ambiance  loved my meal  and the server was super friendly and I would come back to sit in his area again.
Tiffany H.,Tustin  CA,460,138,95,5/7/2017,4.0,Came on a Saturday night for dinner and our group of 6 was seated in a booth in the back. It was a bit tight but we made it work. Our server was really funny and sweet (sorry didn't get his name :[) and definitely kept us entertained! We ordered two pitchers of beer  three small pizzas  wings  a quinoa bowl and a cheeseburger. The awesome part was when we were given medium pizzas because they ran out of small pans!!! Our server gave the birthday girl a free pizookie and made a huge effort to light her candle (since there was a big draft where we were sitting) so I applaud him for his efforts! We were terrified of coming here after reading the reviews but it was overall a decent experience! It took a while for our food to come out but the upsize in our pizzas made it all worth it :-)
Fernando G.,Los Angeles  CA,34,2,1,9/2/2017,1.0,Never have I experienced extreme RACISM at the bar than any other form in my life. Bartenders wouldn't shut this foo up. Thanks BJ's for letting this Fuck rant in Public!! Thank you And FUCK YOU for allowing this! Cheers!!I explained to the manager!! Good luck!
Aleah W.,Los Angeles  CA,45,56,16,8/19/2017,2.0,SLOW. Service was so slow. It was not at all crowded. I sat at the bar. Bartender was friendly but took forever to take my order and to bring my change. It took over 20 minutes to get my cauliflower tacos. The tacos were good but the side dish  some sort of salad concoction  was clearly previously frozen because it was still cold. It was so cold it hurt my teeth.
Michael G.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,1,9/28/2017,5.0,I have been coming here since the Restaurant's grand opening. And it never disappoints! The food is great  the service is quick  and the waiters are attentive. I'm never a big yelp reviewer but this last experience with our waiter (Ernesto) made the experience so good I couldn't let pass and not take some time to write to acknowledge him. He was charismatic and knew how to make all the food in the menu enticing. When the food arrived he made sure it was to our liking and would come by periodically to check if we needed anything else. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to have a nice dinner in old town Pasadena. If you do  I recommend Our waiter for the night Ernesto (Raider fan  and looked like it with a buzz cut haha jk Sir) but if he ever reads this  thank you for your hospitality and for making my wife and I enjoy our weekly date night memorable. Thumbs up! One of our favorite places to eat in Pasadena!
Customer Service P.,Pasadena  CA,0,1,,7/20/2017,1.0,After a long hiatus from visiting this place  i thought i'd give it another chance. What a mistake! I noticed a few new things on the menu that i thought i'd like to try such as the hot ham and cheese. Not all that awful but the one the thing that would make this hot ham and cheese sandwich better is ham! i could barely find it or taste it under all that alfredo sauce!The server  Sarah  was pleasant enough but i do notice with other postings that there seems to be a theme with the servers at the Pasadena BJ's assuming things on or about the bill. And if i bring it to your attention  please do not argue with me (that's why you got the lousy tip). Just apologize and go fix it. I used to work for tips too so i know what it's like.  And now  thankfully  i'm in a position to over tip  which is what i usually do unless i get an argument. Customer service is key and it should start at the top.....Cesar! You didn't even come to my table to apologize as to why it was taking so long to fix my bill. i work locally here and with plenty of food choices and hundreds of work acquaintances  i'll be sure to steer people away from your establishment. Treat people they way you wish to be treated. That beautiful building is too good for your lousy establishment!
Sergio J.,Los Angeles  CA,19,25,32,10/13/2017,1.0,It's my daughter 19th bday today & I honestly gotta say thanks BJ's pasadena for the horrendous dried up cat food you served us. First off my Blackend Salmon was dried up like a beef jerky it then took an hour to remake & I watched ever1 else eat.  your hef beer seemed flatter than a pushed in butt but I guess you $3 pizookie was worth listening to your Manager blab about how she's an Angels fan & really didn't give a dam about my Scaly fish dinner.  Next time I'll just make the drive to BJs in Downey.
Ricky G.,Azusa  CA,6,11,1,10/1/2017,4.0,Sarah was Fantastic. Fun and very Attentive. Best server at any BJ's we've been to. Thanks Sarah
Ariana A.,Los Angeles  CA,41,82,39,11/8/2017,5.0,Love this place. They have amazing food. Make sure to download the app for discounts. You can get a free desert.
Celene S.,Pasadena  CA,29,35,53,7/10/2017,5.0,Great service on a Monday night. Mondays they have pizzas half off and margaritas for $5
Cindy M.,Granada Hills  CA,22,50,18,10/13/2017,2.0,For the most part I like the food the staff is ok  but the to go service SUCKS. I don't eat in the restaurant since I work in Pasadena and don't live around here  I only order to go with coworkers  all I can say is we are lucky if we get the order and it's correct. There is ALWAYS something wrong. And they are not trained very well to know what comes with what and especially if you ask them about something on the Lunch Special menu. I'm keeping this short and to the point  if I went thru everything this would be a novel. Just be aware  when you order to go at this location  check your order before you leave.
Stock G.,Los Angeles  CA,0,30,,11/4/2017,5.0,Hands down the place is awesome  seriously! They've got healthy entrees that are delicious! The steak to the pork chops  great pricing  compared tothe other nearby steak places  sogood! Great service always  great selection of beers too! Food is fab.Forget the high price places  I'm down with good food at great prices. Awesome game T.V's!
Sara A.,West Covina  CA,11,11,18,10/22/2017,5.0,This bj's is amazing our server Ernie was so helpful and amazing. He always asked how we were doing ! Thank you
Lianna N.,Los Angeles  CA,520,28,87,1/17/2017,4.0,Reasonable prices  fast and friendly service  great portions  good variety  and overall atmosphere. I enjoyed the salmon with quinoa and pia colada with strawberry lava. I also got a free pizookie for my birthday.
Luada Y.,Pasadena  CA,43,5,12,7/8/2017,5.0,So far so good we order drinks and they came promptly and are delicious witches have taken our order this really happened so fast I love it
Erika O.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,10/20/2017,5.0,Our server Ernesto Rafael was super chill and DA MAN. We'll definitely be coming back! Also the pizookies are a MUST.
Laila S.,Rosemead  CA,612,158,860,11/9/2016,4.0,My boyfriend and I went to this BJ's location recently to scope out the large flat screen TV at the bar for watching games in the future  and we found it to be a nice location to eat & watch sports.We sat at the bar to eat  and our bartender (I forgot her name) was really nice and efficient. She even told us where to get the validation stamp at the Paseo Colorado complex next door for the free 90 minute parking.We ordered the large chicken lettuce wraps plate  the cheddar burger for him  and the spicy peanut chicken soba noodles for me. I just got an orange juice because my throat was a bit sore  and my boyfriend got a diet coke (for which the bartender did not charge us  I guess to be nice).The food was pretty standard for a sports bar  but the service was great and we definitely saw the advantage of sitting at the bar to watch the big screen TV  although that TV is not as large as we had hoped.We parked in the Paseo Colorado Parking Entrance that is to the immediate east of this BJ's location.
Jennifer C.,Pasadena  CA,270,175,214,12/5/2016,1.0,I came here on a Monday afternoon for lunch with 3 of my coworkers. We got there at 12:15 latest  and I am sure they get a lot of corporate workers trying to get in and out within 1 hour. We were seated right away  and the restaurant was half empty. We took our order within 10 minutes. We got half the food at about 1pm. So we've been at the restaurant for almost an hour and they only brought out two soups. Another twenty minutes and they bring out the rest. The two ladies sitting a table next to use for their food before us...I had the bison burger and the chicken bacon hot pocket or that's what the waiter called it. The bison burger patty was dry and tough. The sauce saved the dryness. The chicken bacon hot pocket was like a fancy hot pocket. It didn't wow me or anything. Just made me wish I brought a hot pocket from home. The waiter apologized for the wait and gave us free pazookies on the house. Except that took another 20 minutes. Our waiter was very nice and I understand it wasn't his fault. It was the kitchen's fault for being unorganized. Our one hour lunch turned into 2...
Samantha A.,Los Angeles  CA,191,153,547,11/12/2016,2.0,"This place has some perks and more downsides. As a vegan  I usually avoid chains at all cost  but they were giving free meals to veterans (and I am one) and I read that their pizzas are vegan (if you take off the cheese). so my fianc and I turned it into a Friday date night. Beware  the parking is awful. They don\'t have their own lot  so unless you find street parking  you\'re doomed to try to find parking in Paseo Colorado. By the time we got to the restaurant  the wait was about 50 minutes. For 7:00pm on a Friday  I guess that\'s normal... (again I never go to chain restaurants). We waited at the bar  over an hour later we decided to see what was up. They had given away our seats to someone else at the bar and pretended like they ""missed"" us. Over an hour later  we finally sat down and ordered some drinks  chips and guac to start. I also showed them my military ID so that we\'d get $5 drinks and a free meal for me. We waited about 40 minutes for our pizzas to come out! And the chips and guac never came (only after we said ""hey  our entrees are out and we never got our apps""). The pizza was good. I liked the dough very much and was happy I wasn\'t forced to get a salad and fries. The guac was good as well. That is the only reason this place is getting 2 stars from me. Because  for a chain  the food was decent. Onto the bill... after already showing them ny military ID (for Veterans day specials) they didn\'t take off our discount. So we had to find the waitress to take it off. Then  she didn\'t take off the drink specials for ($5 beers for veterans day). So we had to find her again. At that point was when she said  our beers didn\'t count because we didn\'t order the right ones. I would\'ve liked to have known that I the beginning of the transaction  but of course  why would they do that when they can make a few extra bucks?! So I left BJ\'S feeling very unsatisfied. We would\'ve never ate if we didn\'t say something. We would\'ve never gotten any discount if we didn\'t say something. Going out to eat shouldn\'t be work. It should be enjoyable  and my experience at this place was not. My rule still stands... avoid chain restaurants at all cost."
Della M.,Los Angeles  CA,1,8,12,11/30/2016,1.0,We ordered online for curbside for 16 meals for an executive meeting. Not only was our order incorrect (5 items missing) but we found bacon and onion bits mixed into the fruit cups. DO NOT BOTHER EATING HERE. I suggest Yard House or the Cheesecake Factory which are conveniently located nearby. Check your food before you eat it.
Norma R.,Pasadena  CA,38,229,201,5/30/2017,2.0,Probably one of my least favorite BJ's! Plates are a lot smaller and not great in taste. Drinks aren't the greatest either. I was very excited when this place was going to open in Pasadena but was soon disappointed.
Tonto W.,Monrovia  CA,0,15,4,5/17/2017,1.0,Well my bad should have checked the reviews before I made the decision to eat here. Good Grief Charlie Brown  Ugh!!!!Here it goes. I arrived at the place at 5:30 on a Saturday night and got seated right away  I was only a party of 2. The hired help took our drink order and was off to fetch them  Ice Tea and water. You know those tough drinks that people order. So I had notice that some time had passed  still no drinks yet   checked the old sun dial on the cellphone and a good 15 minutes has passed. I thought what could be the hold up  of course getting the h2o out of the ground is the problem. Ahh here come our waiter now with a tray of food for another table and our drinks. Seriously how lazy  So I was wanting to cut my loses there and leave  but no I let my guest talk me into staying  since I was spending my birthday money there. I order the parmesean chicken and potatoes deal  guest got the roast beef sandwich. Ok the roast beef looked like it had been cooked 2 days before it was so dry  that it looked like the cow hadn't had water in weeks.The breaded chicken was ok  but had to ask for extra sauce for it  I got double potatoes and the to piles where different colored. Needless to say we managed to get through the food. Then the waiter  Pablo  just brought us the check  had to ask for the desert menu  but we passed on that. Needless to say I dropped $50. $16.50 for the chicken and $14 on the roast beef + Ice Tea.Let me say this. There is a reason that your reviews are so bad  when you are in a prime location and other restaurants in the same area are killing it. Truth be told your rating reflect how bad you are.
Daisy M.,Pasadena  CA,0,3,1,8/10/2017,5.0,Love this place peaceful and happy hour is awesome! Service is great drinks are worth it
Ryan S.,Pasadena  CA,135,416,7,11/5/2016,3.0,I have mixed feelings about this place. We come to BJ's in Pasadena about 8-10 times per year. We live very close by within walking distance. It is one of the more beautiful BJ's restaurants that we have been in  mainly because of the historic nature of the building. We have found that the food is consistently good at this location. We order burgers  sandwiches  pizza  salads  and of course dessert -- just depends on our mood. We have found the majority of the servers to be friendly and accommodating. So  why 3 stars you may ask?This location has the single most miserable hosts and hostesses of any restaurant I have ever seen. It just never fails. They are always miserable  always unbearable  never smile and never friendly.  I have spoken to the restaurant manager several times in the past  and I always tell her the same thing --- great food  mostly friendly servers and miserable host staff. At least they always remain the same  right?
Chuck D.,Los Angeles  CA,641,1157,8323,10/23/2016,3.0,Nice setting for a BJ's which was obviously a former bank space. The high & back lit ceiling make for a dramatic setting for a meal and definitely the nicest space I've ever dined at that housed a BJ's. We went there on a Thursday evening. Parked downstairs in Paseo Colorado underground parking. We tried to park on the end just under where the restaurant would be and took the elevators up. But to get to the restaurant from that way  you have to walk through an alley that passes the trash bins of the restaurant so you may wanna hold your breath or go another way as it isnt the most scenic of routes. We only saw one entrance and its along Colorado.We started off with one of their thin crust tavern pizzas ($11.50). We went with the italian market which had meatballs  pepperoni  ham and peperoncinis. It was quite tasty. I prefer the thin crust when I want to sample other things on the menu. The deep dish is so heavy & filling. The toppings all tasted great and normally I dont eat peppers but the peperoncinis really tasted great on this thin crust pizza. We also got the cheese bread for my nieces and it was just ok. The crispy calamari ($11.50) was good with its fresh taste. The breading was light and gave great texture and the squid itself was tender. The accompanying marinara dipping sauce was good... The fresh atlantic salmon ($18.95) was good. I liked it a lot. The blackened salmon with lemon butter sauce over rice pilaf was really good. I was surprised. The salmon wasnt dry and it tasted great. The vegetables on the side were whatever.For desert we ordered a pizookie trio ($10.75) which were 3 mini pizookies meant to be shared. We went with OG chocolate chunk  white chocolate macadamia and cookies and cream. Yummm... They were all great. ALL OF THEM. It was my first time trying the cookies and cream. It was like eating a warm oreo cookie. Soo good. Service could have been better. We stood there a little while waiting to be seated and the place wasnt packed at all. The hostess was away from the front of the restaurant. We were sat in a big u-shaped booth. We had 3 adults and 2 children... We had to wait for utensils to be provided and our food had started making its way to our table already. So that was a bit of an inconvenience. Also  we waited awhile (again) for the waitress to refill our drinks... By then  the lack of customer service was annoying. Anddd... When we wanted to pay the bill  we had to ask another server to find OUR server so she could ready the check. ANDD... when we wanted to pay the bill (in cash)  I couldnt find her again and we certainly didnt want to leave cash on the table so I had to search for some staff member  ANY staff member and I found a hostess... Yeah  it was off. The service was lacking. That's too bad because that should be the last thing we have to worry about. Maybe we'll be back. If we do  hope the service is more available.
Michelle D.,Glendale  CA,59,103,180,11/12/2016,4.0,I sat at the table in the bar area for 10 minutes by myself and no one acknowledged me although there were at least four servers passing by me. My friend came about 5 minutes later then finally a server came by. I had to ask her if there was any service here and she was the one going to service us. Anyway  we got our order and it came in good time. We had asked if she can get the soccer game from the smaller screen to the bigger one. She said that people had requested the football game so it's on the bigger screen. Later  the manager came to talk to us. We said it was the qualifying match for the World Cup. She went around the bar to ask if they were watching the football game. The end result was four medium screens which was fair. The service started off rough but it was smooth sailing there on.
Kay M.,Toronto  Canada,0,21,1,10/3/2017,1.0,Ordered a side of fruit and the bowl was not fresh. Soggy blueberries that were not cold  seemingly scraped off of warm food (savory food after taste with some sort of sweet liquid or syrup on grapes). Convinced they scraped this fruit off of a plate and sent it out. :(
Thor S.,Glendale  Los Angeles  CA,20,52,19,9/16/2016,1.0,It's a chain so rule 1 is this: consistency. Tiny burnt sirloin steak doesn't live up to prior Glendale experiences. They have a sign out front suggesting we park in the mall (see picture). But they don't validate. And they don't tell you that until you're leaving. The price is higher too. I will defer to costs on that score but a 12% price increase for less is not good.We will not be back. Ever. There are too many good places nearby to suffer through mediocrity and indifference to customer satisfaction.
Mari N.,Pasadena  CA,33,18,12,5/3/2017,1.0,Just had Bj'S and it was the worst food ever . I ordered the lettuce wrap salad . I was expecting something similar to the yard house. They gave me more lettuce than chicken . The kids Mac and cheese is straight out from the box . We also ordered fish and chips . They arrived soggy and super salty . I've never been a fan of BJS but today was definitely the last time .
Sameena R.,Altadena  CA,0,3,1,5/14/2017,1.0,Great server  good service ..... extremely horrible presentation. It look like the cool threw my omelette from one end of the kitchen to the other and landed it on the plate .... thanks Yes it's a chain but seriously? On Mother's Day?
A. S.,West Covina  CA,10,36,6,3/13/2017,1.0,"My workplace wanted to place a lunch order here for pick-up and I assumed it would be simple... little did I know that I would be encountering the worst customer service I\'ve had in the Old Town area. Just calling the restaurant was a bigger chore than it had to be  I was placed on hold for more than 5 minutes when trying to place an order. Then and there  I should have gotten the hint and asked everyone if they wanted something different. Instead I finally got to place an order with a curt employee who constantly asked me ""Is that it?"" after I had already informed him this would be an order for an OFFICE. I hung up the phone thinking that if the customer service was that crummy  the actual food has got to be some degree better. No  it was not. Major disappointment. Those who ordered salads complained of missing advertised ingredients and general distasteful greens. A salad that looks luxurious and gourmet on the menu more accurately resembled something you would pick up at an off-brand liquor store in a run-down neighborhood. In addition  they forgot to add fries that are included with sandwiches and burgers. Worst of all  they neglected to produce one entire entree. Needless to say  we will not be patrons at this specific BJ\'s ever again and I highly suggest you dine somewhere else."
Steven C.,University Park  Los Angeles  CA,331,47,35,4/26/2017,2.0,This is just a BJs so I don't know what to say really. The beer selection is alright  but I am not really a big fan of their own brews. I find them a little bland and unadventurous which makes sense for a massive chain that needs mass appeal. I don't have a TV so sometimes I come here to watch sports. Everything is overpriced and indifferently cooked. Nothing on the menu is particularly interesting. It's a BJs  it is what it is! If you are in the mood for deep dish pizza and you don't mind overpaying for a basic pizza  go for it. Otherwise  do a little research and find a place with passion and a unique take. The worst part of this location  and perhaps all locations  is the happy hour  which is really lame. 1 hour off of already overpriced beer and cocktails. It brings them down from ridiculously overpriced  to moderately overpriced. But it still enrages me to purchase a single beer for the price of a six pack. When you do this in a bar there is something else you are paying for and for me it is the opportunity to watch a sports event of some sort. The service is usually pretty good and the waiters friendly. They aren't fast but they aren't slow either. I can usually find seating in the bar area even when things are busy.
Jodie Grace G.,Los Angeles  CA,26,12,5,6/2/2017,2.0,This place is decent. They just have the worst customer service ever. They took a while with our order. They should improve the customer service honestly.
Jack H.,Los Angeles  CA,746,490,2366,8/3/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,"I decided to come to this BJ\'s again despite my previous experience and I have to say that the waitress I had made the experience wonderful. I brought the kids out for lunch and since I was going to be at church later in the day in Pasadena  I decided to eat in Pasadena. I asked my daughter if she wanted steak and she said YES! (Thank God shes a carnivore!!) So I decided to try out BJ\'s and not kill my wallet by taking my 4 year old to Ruths Chris or something lol. We were seated right away. The waitress was totally on top of things. My daughter got a sirloin steak  medium - of course it has to be a little bloody to taste great  my son got chicken tenders  and I went for a full rack of baby back ribs. She brought out drinks right away  and brought out the food fairly quick too! Thats usually important to me cause when you have a one year old and a four year old at a restaurant that get bored fairly quick  it gets chaotic fairly quick  next thing you know dishes are flying  and people are going deaf  it can get pretty wild. The food was delicious! I tried my dughters steak and it was REALLY good... I almost jacked if from her lol. My son loved his fries but not so much the chicken tenders  and my ribs were pretty freakin good! As I mentioned  overall  everything went really well! \'Just when I thought you couldnt do anything dumber... you do something like this....AND TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELF!!"" -dumb & dumber"
Nila C.,Glendale  CA,26,108,44,10/15/2016,1.0,"Today was my second disappointment at BJ\'s. I came here a month ago with my husband the service was so slow we had to cancel our desert. Today  I decided to go back with some friends. Again  the service was slow  but the thing that was the worst is that they gave me a ""dirty\' straw in my water... totally gross.... I don\'t even want to think why it was dirty. Plus a mistake in my check  but this is understandable because this can happen in any place ."
Dolores B.,Alhambra  CA,237,10,,11/8/2017,5.0,I love this hidden gem! The service is excellent and the food is good. I love the atmosphere!
Richard A.,Los Angeles  CA,88,21,,2/2/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I'm not gonna start this wig a great anecdote. I'm gonna start with a straight diatribe about this particular BJ's. I M not going to complain about the consistently inconsistent service. As someone who has been here a half to a full dozen or more times. I am not bothered that my order is wrong EVERY time I order here. I mean it makes sense that my appetizer comes after my dinner. My salad can once in a while miss ingredients or be a completely different salad. Those things happen. You serve me the wrong drinks? I'll laugh it off. But  to have something be completely and totally incorrect EVERY time I come here had to be an all time noteworthy description of ineptitude. I'm talking epic consistency of messing up orders. Lactose intolerant? Cheese bread for you. Peanut allergies? Cashew chicken (exaggeration but you get the ideas!). I don't get it. Can't explain it. But  it's damn consistent that your order is going to be wrong  forgotten  or given to the people next to you. I'm not complaining about the servers. They are nice and always apologetic. I'm not mad at the cooks for missing my orders. I'm not mad at the hostesses who try to sit 2 or 3 couples at the same table. I have decided this comprehensive a show had to be the top. Management doesn't manage. Doesn't check on things. In fact they are uninvolved and basically apathetic. Perfect example. Our appetizer was served after dinner. Seems simple. The server told his manager. She never came by to check on us to make sure the order got fixed. Never saw her/him follow-up. In fact  the SECOND time they forgot the appetizer it still wasn't fixed. No my friends. This isn't a institutional problem it's a leadership problem. Small things are let to become big things. I've never seen such a disjointed chain restaurant in my life. If the food weren't good (and it's pretty darn good) I would give terrible ratings. But you'll get a good meal. It's just you better have huge patience and the ability to laugh at horror shows. On the bright side. Nice decor here too!Enjoy the show. LolUpdate: Jan 2017Been back a few times. Seems like they're getting the hint and working hard to get more staff. The managers hustle as hard as the staff. The food is still pretty good. Mistakes happen and they try to fix it. So far I've had one excellent server and one ok one. It's improving. (You can do it clap!)
Karie F.,PORTER RANCH  CA,260,594,436,2/16/2017,2.0,Big disappointment! The menu here is so bountiful  pictures so alluring! Too bad the quality of the food is NOTHING like what you see or read about in the menu. Lets start out with the drinks. I ordered the Raspberry iced tea. It was more like Raspberry syrup with a splash of tea. It was so weak! We ordered the avocado egg rolls for an appetizer. They were disgusting! Had an old taste to them  like they microwaved some old egg rolls that were made a day before...The ingredients inside were undetectable. Some kind of mashed up mess with a few visual hints of avocado. The dipping sauce made them somewhat edible. I ordered a dish (don't remember the name)  shrimp with spinach and quinoa and tomatoes. It was decent but would have been better if the shrimp were grilled or sauteed. It was like they took some shrimp cocktail type of shrimp and threw them in the dish. The Poozokie was flavorful but so thin. I haven't had one of these in years  this was nothing like I remembered. The cookie was spread so thin you could barley even scrape a piece from the tin. Food was just an epic fail on this visit. Service was good and friendly but the food and drink fell short! Not even sure I would come back to this location when in the area.
Tatyaja S.,Pasadena  CA,0,74,4,9/16/2017,3.0,The food is typically overpriced bar food...the music is too loud and the waitresses are totally inattentive and not friendly. Pass. 3 stars for the strong drinks though....just not a great place.
Kristin L.,Los Angeles  CA,0,3,5,8/1/2017,1.0,Service was HORRIBLE! Took FOREVER for someone to take order drink and food order and FOREVER for the orders to come out to us. It took about 40 minutes for us to get our food
Taufan R.,Alhambra  CA,29,73,61,1/5/2017,2.0,Went here with my wife and kids. Seems not to busy  but no hostess. Had to wait 6mins to be seated... it wasnt even busy. Got sat  ordered  food arrived. No utensils? Ordered  beats salad with no beats?? Interesting. Ate with our hands. So we had to call out waiter for utensils. He only gave us 2 ..... wait   there were 4 of us. So that means we had to share utensils and the knapkins... very conservative... . Got calamari  but very soggy... uggh!! Not cool. While i was drinking  just realized that my glass was cracked and chipped on the rim. Good thing i was using a straw but hopefully nothing went inside my stomache. I like BJs resto  the beers and decor  but please pay attention to the details and service. These do matter the most. Overall was very disappointing. We love the alcohol though...
Pebs P.,Central LA  Los Angeles  CA,0,54,,7/8/2017,2.0,We didn't feel like walking all the way down Colorado Blvd. so we stopped at BJ's for a drink. The service was meh. The drinks were unbalanced...like the girl didn't care to portion the quantities of things right. My drink was really  really  strong. With all the great places to eat in Pasadena I really regret coming here for this mediocre  chain  crap. But I guess I should have known better. Go somewhere else  there are plenty of better places.
Joyce C.,Arcadia  CA,94,15,1,6/11/2017,1.0,"I wish there was an option on Yelp to give no stars. Our waiter\'s name was Roman (the name that appeared on the check  but who knows if he\'s logged onto someone else\'s account to avoid blame). So here\'s a physical description of him: Skinny blonde white boy  possibly around 5\'6"" with a shit ton of sass. He should be fired. To be honest  I do not know why he was even there tonight. We sat down around 10pm  and we didn\'t even get our order in until maybe around 11pm-ish  and that\'s me trying to make him sound better. The waiter blamed the new computer system  he showed us how it was malfunctioning. But there was no troubleshooting. He wouldn\'t pull out a paper and pen because he says that it\'s stupid if waiters can\'t remember people\'s orders (guess what he forgot). He sat down next to my friends  and when we finally got the order in  he told us that he\'ll be eating pizookie with strangers a few tables down. He LITERALLY did that  and another half an hour went by without us getting our food. Now I know restaurants have waiters who spit in food  so I just didn\'t want spit on top of waiting for forever. So I was patient while glaring at this kid waiter. The food finally came  but not all the food. But Roman was gone again. We got a busser to get the remaining food to us. And then Roman\'s sitting back at that table looking at his hands with the ""strangers"" shining an iPhone light over him and eating more food and drinking more of whatever he had there.The hero amongst us went to find the manager  because her pizookie hadn\'t come yet  and that\'s what she was here for. The manager  Richard  confronted the waiter Roman  and said he\'d fix our bill. Roman came back and gave sass about the computer forgetting the pizookie. He forgot it  and then blamed the kitchen. No apology. He got the pizookie  said he\'d pay for it for all the trouble. Everyone else is done eating and is now waiting for the check. 11:45pm. We don\'t get our check until 12:00am ish. Yes  we\'re now literally in a brand new fucking day. Our bill has not been fixed. He split all our checks without asking first. So our hero went to demand the manager honor his word. She\'s gone for 10 minutes  battling the stubbornness of this restaurant\'s management. The waiter is there too  claiming he was told by us to split the bill and claiming that none of anything is his fault. The three of them are arguing for these 10 minutes. An estimation of what is probably 12:20am - Ms. Sass Roman gives attitude to our hero  handing her the new bill  and gives more attitude. Never once has he said sorry or anything. We finally get everything figured out  and leave by 12:25/30am of the day after we entered the doors of the BJs in Pasadena. So that\'s 2.5 hours at a restaurant that was pretty empty.Corporate BJ\'s  if you need to close stores  start with Pasadena. Or at least train your employees in common courtesy and customer service. And give your employees a damn pad of paper and pen for when your system dies."
Veronica Y.,Pasadena  CA,14,8,1,8/4/2017,5.0,Came for dinner with family  large group. Ernesto our server was amazing. It seriously felt great with his patience and great attitude. We ordered our food and drinks  all were prompt and so yummy. I must say  some of the best service we've experienced in a long time. Thanks for helping make this evening a special one for mom. Will be back soon.
Michael G.,Pasadena  CA,0,58,7,9/30/2017,3.0,One of the things that brings me and my wife into BJ's are the garlic rolls. Today I was told that they no longer give those to customers with the meal. Instead you have to pay $4.95 for four rolls and marinara sauce. However  a manager contacted me and explained that they do give customers one roll per dinner item so at least they are giving them out. I guess the waitress wasn't told the rolls are still available at no cost with dinner. The other problem I had tonight was that it took a very long time to get my dinner. And I asked for green beans instead of broccoli but they gave me broccoli anyway. Tonight was not the best experience at BJ's but they've been pretty good in the past and so I'll give them another chance. Especially since they are still offering the garlic rolls with dinner. If they weren't doing that  then I wouldn't go back; I'd go to a different restaurant that does include bread with the meal.
Andrea M.,Redondo Beach  CA,0,33,,10/27/2017,1.0,Oh my god. The service couldn't be WORSE. IT took SO long for the server to come. The appetizer (stuffed mushrooms) would have been good if they hadn't been cold. And my drink... never arrived. They aren't even busy and there's a ton of staff lingering around. I always tip 20% no matter what. Not today!
Angie M.,Silver Lake  Los Angeles  CA,112,11,6,1/5/2017,2.0,I didn't think this location would be so awful. First  we ordered our drinks  my wine came out first and my boyfriends beer came out nearly 20 minutes later. He didn't even finish it because we wanted to have a drink before our dinner  so that was a fail. Second  when our dinner finally arrived they didn't provide us with utensils so we just sat there staring at each other not being able to eat our food. I ordered pasta and he ordered steak  I would've gladly eaten with my hands but these food items don't allow for that. I asked the busser that brought our food for utensils and he never came back  our server had to go run and get them. Our food got cold. Third  when our pizookie arrived they didn't clear our table from our dinner plates so we had to awkwardly pile everything to the side in our tiny booth to try and make room for dessert. The food was decent and our waiter was nice  but I don't think we'll be returning to this location.
Vee F.,Whittier  CA,1,15,11,9/18/2016,3.0,3 stars because I LOVE BJ's food. I can't say much for some of the staff. Our waitress is sweet! But the hostess made a fooshy face when I asked her if she could wipe off the food crumbs from the bench. Been here for 20 minutes and every table (I'm not exaggerating) has dirty plates on top. It's pretty gross!!! 8 tables!!15 minutes later... Guy shows up to clean the table next to us  he has a wad of toilet paper sticking out his nose. Pretty gross. I wanted to send him home. Or away.
Adrian I.,Los Angeles  CA,63,4,1,7/4/2017,1.0,There online ordering service is a joke the location never has anything ready not only that but they take forever to even to acknowledge that you've walked into building. I placed a order at 5:26pm online for a 630pm pick up of course was not ready. For anyone on a tight lunch break this is not a location to go to.
Gina S.,Rancho Mirage  CA,389,29,11,3/16/2017,1.0,"A few friends went to your restaurant on a Weekend a couple of weeks ago. We got there at 10:00am  we were given the brunch/breakfast menu. On the menu  it read eggs anyway you want. First  I ordered poached eggs  the waitress informed me that they didn\'t have vinegar to do poached properly! So  I asked for soft boiled eggs  they told me  they weren\'t set up to do eggs like that???? WTF!!Perhaps  change the writing on your menu to read  ""fried eggs only!"
Aaron B.,San Dimas  CA,0,5,1,7/6/2017,5.0,Ernesto was a great waiter! Went out of his way to help us and they were closing when we came in. I like when my waiter is cool and talks to use like we are friends and not some lousy customer here to eat and here their script. Thanks!!
Gypsy Q.,Los Angeles  CA,0,26,,9/8/2017,5.0,Michael A. Was an awesome server!!! He was so affable and knew the answer to every menu related question. He was also a beer expert  which was perfect for our group. He truly went above and beyond  moreso than any other waiter I've experienced. Next time we are here  I'd request to sit in his section again.
Kesa W.,Corona  CA,0,10,,10/10/2017,1.0,Worst customer service!! I've had two incidents with this restaurant. The first time I order a flatbread pizza and it was undercooked. So  I call and speak with the manager and she advised she would follow up with me the next day after she finds the transaction but I never receive a call back. Then today I decide to give it another shot and I spoke with Brandon and asked about the take out wait time and he places me on hold for 4 plus mins and never came back. So I called back and spoke with the manager Chelsea and she took my order. I get there and the guy at the take out register doesn't even acknowledge I'm sitting there. I finally get help and Chelsea took care of my order but let me say this  it might have been free but it looked like it was free. It was extremely messy and sloppy. Didnt eat it!! This really showed how you value your customers. Will never return!!
C C.,Fremont  CA,1,45,,10/9/2017,4.0,Great place to watch sports and eat. Dodgers were on TV (TBS) so I am not sure if during the regular season  they can view the games on the cable channel. The smores pizzoki dessert was the best. We had pizza  pasta  and jambalaya which were good  but not excellent. Service was attentive  but not frequent to check on us. We had water glasses that were unfilled. The location in Pasadena is excellent. I would recommend this and go back too. Driving south on I-5 to Los Angeles area?... take the 210 interstate to Pasadena and hop off for dinner at BJ's.
Charlea G.,West Hollywood  CA,1,8,,10/7/2017,1.0,We ordered and waited over 40 minutes for our food. After not being able to find the waitress we decided to get up and leave. Asked for the manager to let him know the terrible service. Manager named Cesar took forever to see us and then the only thing he said was that they wouldn't charge us. I told him charge us for what?
Yaeko M.,Chicago  IL,26,300,10,10/12/2016,4.0,I went there with my colleagues from Japan. They are looking for american beer and this place served well  great beer  great food  great service. We enjoyed happy hour.We had beer flight  calamari  mozzarella cheese fries  mini deep pizza (classic combo  California supreme  PJ's favorite  buffalo chicken). All food was decent and we enjoyed very much.Food: GreatPrice: GreatService: GoodAmbiance: Great
Anthony A.,Monrovia  CA,248,1,,7/20/2017,5.0,I came in on a Tuesday night  not too many people so I sat in the bar  I was greeted by an exceptionally knowledgeable bartender by the name of Ariana. She was very pleasant and had a great energy  I enjoyed the green flash IPA and was suggested the new flat bread pizza which came out very fast and tasted incredible. Overall the service  food and energetic bartender will ensure I will become a regular at this establishment. Awesome job BJ's!
Ken W.,Alhambra  CA,0,16,50,7/20/2017,4.0,Took my wife to BJ's for her Birthday last night. First time to Pasadena location.Food was Great. I had the Top Sirloin steak with double White Cheddar Mashed Potatos  wife had the Rib Eye steak with mashed potatos and grilled asparagas. Both meals were delicious.There was Free WiFi.We were very Disappointed that the server told us they did not Validate for Parking in the Paseo Pasadena garage parking  server told us if we took our ticket to the machine by the elevator  where our ticket can be swiped and validated  went to elevator  could Not find this machine. We have dined at Islands in the past  in the Paseo and they have machine validator at the Host Desk where we can validate parking ticket.We had to go to Parking Pay Stationand Pay $7.50 for Parking....
Richard C.,Los Angeles  CA,97,68,,11/21/2016,2.0,"We noticed that this place opened a few months ago since we normally frequent the one in Glendale  so we decided to finally give this place a shot. My wife  son  and I was met by their hostess. We asked to be seated  but then she said something weird  ""Let me check with my manager first."" I was scratching my head wondering why she needed to check with her manager before seating us. I couldn\'t figure out why? There was enough space for the 3 of us. Anyhow  we were eventually seated. Our server was very friendly  but unfortunately  his attention to detail was subpar. He had forgotten a few things that we ordered and didn\'t come to check in on us on a periodic basis like how other great servers do. The food was okay; nothing spectacular. I order the prime rib which was very good  but the mashed potatoes was cold. My wife ordered the ahi tuna salad. Again  not really that fresh. I had better Ahi Tuna at the Yard House. Overall  the experience was not that great. What is also a deal breaker was their inability to validate our parking ticket. If they can afford a super spacious former historic bank  they can subsidize our parking  too. We are not going back to this location. I will take a further drive out to Glendale  instead."
Stephanie Y.,Rosemead  CA,1,10,4,9/22/2016,1.0,"Absolutely horrible service here. One of the greeters sees me walk in  doesnt greet me  I tell her I\'m here for pick-up and she tells me to wait at the take out place. She and two other greeters start chatting and none of them attempted to call anyone to ""take out."" If the bartender didn\'t see me standing there  I don\'t know how the ""take out guy"" would have known I was standing there. The guy shows up  doesn\'t apologize and takes forever to complete the transaction. Thought I would have gotten better service at Pasadena BJ\'s but I think it is actually worse that Montbello!"
Jonathan Roy A.,Los Angeles  CA,118,23,100,12/29/2016,4.0,Been here quite a few times throughout the years and this is the first time I am reviewing it. I usually I go here for celebratory reasons as the atmosphere in the restaurant is pretty classy. The one thing that stands out is that their servings per dish. The size is outstanding. The taste is pretty good as well. Their pizza and calamari is mouthwatering. If you do plan to try this restaurant out  make sure to come in on an empty stomach to make your visit as worhtwhile as possible. Customer service is amazing and they make sure to cater to you as a crowd and as an individual. And one more thing  do try their large-sized pizookie. It comes in 2-3 different flavors! If you came in a small crowd  take the pizookie challenge and finish it by yourself. But BJ's is pretty amazing at catering to a large crowd so either way  your visit to this aesthetic driven restaurant will be worth it! 9/10
Ralph S.,Los Angeles  CA,5,22,,7/13/2017,4.0,Place was nice and food and desert were good. One bad thing is they do not validate parking so you need to add the parking cost if you are going there
Alexus T.,Covina  CA,0,9,7,10/25/2016,2.0,This is the worst BJ's I've ever been to.The customer service is horrible and definitely needs better hostesses. They don't greet you when you walk in and are rude and snobby. That's not the first impression you want of any company.It's also a huge bummer that they don't validate parking for the parking garage located directly underneath them. I don't get it. But that's not even the biggest issue. What really annoyed me is that I went in with a party of eight people and they tried seating us in a booth that clearly only fit five people comfortably or six people if I'm being generous. When I politely asked for us to be seated elsewhere because being squished in with that many people after a long day at Six Flags  the hostess rolled her eyes at me and walked away. I than annoyed a random waiter and demanded be seated at a longer table (which keep in mind isn't his job). But he ended up switching our tables. Our waitress after that was decent. But the hostesses just ruined our interest in this BJ's location.
Jennifer M.,West Covina  CA,52,8,2,5/4/2017,4.0,First time trying the beer batter fried asparagus and it was amazing! It comes with a lemon garlic aioli that added even more yummy flavor! As for the spinach artichoke dip...... dry very dry and it left me an odd aftertaste. The drinks were great and my new favorite drink here is the pear cider!! Very light and tasty!!
Peter S.,Monterey Park  CA,4,41,18,9/3/2017,1.0,The waitress was completely dismissive  didn't mind following up with our food. Food arrived COLD and 1 hr late in a not so busy day. Manager apologize and gave us a discount coupon for next time. Used the coupon and the same story. Wouldn't be surprised if they close in less than a year.
Evan M.,Pasadena  CA,210,238,457,7/26/2015,3.0,Pretty good food for a slightly higher price ($18-20). I feel it reminds me of Cheesecake Factory with their large portions of mostly American Food  however minus Cheesecake!!! (Downer for me). I did enjoy their BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich  and their Thick cut fries (something hard to find). They do have their Pizookie (think cookie with ice cream on top)  which was kinda good. We got the triple cookie sampler and chose Cookies and Cream and Salted Caramel (both good) and Peanut Butter (not good  and I love peanut butter). I do like you can get a sample of several flavors at least.Overall not that impressed since there are so many other good food places around Pasadena in the same price range or cheaper. However  would come again since their food still is good.
Bree B.,Pasadena  CA,0,2,,8/13/2017,5.0,All of the employees here are really nice and helpful but Michael  especially. He is always so sweet and attentive and everything you could ask for in a server! He always has such a positive attitude and never seems like he hates his job - unlike most customer service employees. I just hope his outstanding service is recognized! I was never the biggest fan of this restaurant but I live/work near by and after my first time having him as a server a few months ago he suggested a lot of the best items on the menu that I've been back for several times to try out. Hope this review counts for something. It's just really hard to come across good customer service employees so I have to make sure I speak up about ones I come across!
Ivonne S.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,1379,73,1439,2/5/2017,4.0,Came here on a Monday night  service was great and fast! We had a deep dish pizza and took advantage of their deal going on  any Deep Dish Pizza or Tavern Pizza was half off  so we went ahead and ordered the large one with a side of their BBQ Pepper wings. The food was great! The Cavaliers were playing  so we asked the server if he can change one of the T.V.'s to the game  but then after getting his manager to approve it he told us that they didn't have the channel  which was surprising because it was a Fox Sport Channel. Anyways  first time at this location and will be coming back!
Eddie B.,La Caada Flintridge  CA,0,49,,7/30/2017,2.0,I really want to like this place but the truth of the matter is not all locations are the same. Their Burbank location is so much better in food quality and service. In a city like Pasadena  that offers many places to eat  you have to be good to make it. I doubt they will survive another 2 years. I hope I am wrong  and they improve  perhaps by firing everyone and starting over.
Kirk W.,La Crescenta-Montrose  CA,16,15,15,3/26/2017,1.0,Night begins with a 15-20 min wait (appears slow) .... finally seated  order  then Sirloin steak comes out before two kids spaghetti...  Also  no silverware 1 hour in... no need to add more details. Not mad  extremely disappointed
Libra B.,San Gabriel  CA,0,5,,6/22/2017,1.0,Had dinner there yesterday & wont be returning 1. Awful service!!- Waiter appeared to not really want to be at work-- in very bad mood2. They ran out of pork chops!! Really??? Restaurant was empty at 5 pm and No pork chops?Now I understand why restaurant was empty3. Ordered 2 cappuccinos & got watered down coffee with something else in it ( maybe creamer?)No foam no nothing. Waiter claims that's how it came out of the machine---hmmmmFood and service for a pasadena/paseo establishment was less than one star. Service staff needs better training!!!!
Austin C.,Los Angeles  CA,244,23,7,3/16/2017,1.0,Echoing the common complaint here. Service slow and impersonal. Food subpar. Lots of potential but none realized.
Cydney M.,La Caada Flintridge  CA,80,663,3516,3/3/2015,3.0,"This is one of those places that has some good Happy Hour Specials and you can see these on my photo.My Yelp friend and I decided to grab a bite to eat and a drink before seeing ""The Theory of Everything"" at the Arc Light Cinemas. BJ\'s Restaurant is on the west side of the Paseo  so we walked over there.FOOD: 3/5 STARSI just ordered the carnitas fries with chile verde. They were just alright. I wish the pork had been shredded instead of chunks of pork. The beer was good. My friend had a salad and a beer. Our bill was $30.00 which was reasonable.SERVICE: 2/5 STARSOur server took our order quickly  but she didn\'t check on us  refill our water or bring a box for our leftovers after we asked once.ATMOSPHERE: 4/5 STARSIt\'s a pretty space with vaulted ceilings and huge chandeliers.  The huge T.V. over the the bar is also nice.PARKING: 4/5 STARSJust park at the Paseo and you can get your ticket validated.RECOMMENDATION:Will I return? Possibly  but there are so many other places to go with better food and service."
PETER G.,Pasadena  CA,0,34,8,11/2/2016,3.0,its okay....just don't order the brussel sprout! Looks nothing like the picture. All black and burnt. Asked the server  she said thats how they are made. So gross.Most other food item is okay. The app is a great idea  but lots of fine tuning to do. Can't pay on it if they have a special you want to take advantage of.
Braided V.,Pasadena  CA,5,19,24,8/12/2016,1.0,Ordered the Brussel sprout and kale salad with Cajun shrimp. Did not look appealing nor taste good. It had one too many toppings that just didn't mix well. Staff seemed like they needed training on their customer service and products.
Cheryl A.,Los Angeles  CA,11,20,1446,3/16/2016,3.0,Went here the other night to take advantage of the free Pizookie for Pi day. Super easy visit without any complications. Only need to spend $10 minimum and did not need to split checks while each patron got a free Pizookie. I only wish this place validated parking. Ended up being $7.50 for the underground parking.
K. L.,Los Angeles  CA,0,13,,5/31/2017,5.0,Weekly visitor for a few years now. Recently I've been staying in and going to pick up take out. The take out hostess Elaine is usually there to pack up my order right. When ever she's there my order is complete and my bag is stocked with utensils  condiments  and napkins. She mentioned to me that she may be moving up to server soon  if she does I will most positively come back as diner at her table. Great customer service. A+ smile. And food recommendations are always 100!
Serena G.,La Crescenta  CA,0,5,2,7/19/2017,1.0,I don't understand why people get into the customer service field if you don't seem to even be around people. If you hate your job find another. The food didn't seemed to be cooked correctly and and also it took FOREVER. Worst BJ's ever.. save your money and eat in it will be a better experience.
january l.,San Gabriel  CA,3,23,12,3/14/2017,1.0,Ffood & Service is terrible. We waited at the bar for 10 mins with no menus. Nobody came up to ask us if we've been helped. I went up to the hostess to get a seat in the dining area and got seated right away. (That was the only good thing about this) Our waitress was very sweet  but a little unattentive. She took a while to get to us. We finally order our drinks and appetizer and waited another 15-20 mins for our food. It was nice of her to let us know she was checking on or food which I appreciate  but the kitchen has to have backed up bcit took longer than usual. I ordered a pizza with no olives. It had olives...the waitress even repeated no olives on the pizza lol really? No drink refills were asked. We asked her to change the channel back to what was showing earlier (it was a documentary about a 2 UFC fighters) and she said they aren't able to because they don't show fights. Are you joking right now?!?! It was just on!! We were pretty much done with our food and that was when she told us about the TV situation. She aired us what channel it was on the first time and then 10 minutes coming back to us letting us know they can turn it back. I s do dinner with this place. We for another 10-15 minutes waiting for our check. Come on  man. I used to work at a restaurant! This is THE WORST restaurant I've gone to. It's close to going to a restaurant and getting food poisoning.One question  where the hell do we park for for BJ's? They don't validate for you parking structure connected to them on the left. So they have a restaurant with no parking lot of their own...? That's a little weird.
When NoOne Is Watching Y.,Monrovia  CA,0,23,256,12/7/2016,5.0,Great atmosphere  and staff (David  Alex). They are attentive during lunch and happy hour 3-4pm. Happy hour is 3-7pm;lunch is 11am -3pm. I highly recommend signing up for their reward program as you get points for every dine-in you have at BJ's. Wifi is also freely available. Keep in mind this review is only a review between the hours of 2-4pm.
A. M.,Glendora  CA,0,8,,3/13/2017,1.0,When you order service here and it's a rib eye you should never have to wait 1 hour 17 mins to get your food the the waitress was not even checking on you  only to tell you that your food will be wright up and it still came up cold and not the way you ordered it ! Sucks but this place not only has turtle slow service and I guarantee you this is my last time to this location!!!! Pasadena BJ's is horrible the workers are so unfriendly that if I was corporate I would be looking at this location very closely  I was told that maybe our steak was given to someone else ??? Our waitress was the worst  when her job is too check on her customers food ! and she didn't do that correctly ! They had us wait to replace the food and now the steak was burnt is this a joke !!!!!
Charles G.,Pasadena  CA,500,246,1016,12/10/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,So I'm back I'm here for appetizers and the infamous PIZOOKIE. Appetizers were delicious we ordered the appetizer combo avocado rolls cheese sticks buffalo wings dip and side of calamari and Brussel sprouts with siracha. The desert a few different pizookies.
scott M.,Pasadena  CA,0,1,,3/5/2017,2.0,"So I want to like this place. Grew up on Orange County and this was a favorite spot.Every time I come in though I\'m disappointed. Foods ok  It\'s just not run very well. I\'m sure it does ok given its location and I\'m certain being a chain keeps people coming in  but it shouldn\'t.Couple of highlights... shoes up and host wasn\'t present. 2 more groups  1 more group. It\'s dinner time and host is gone for 5-10 minutes while people are piling up. Meanwhile 3-4 other employees cruise by host station  but can\'t help. Everybody looking at each other wondering what\'s happening. Host finally shows up and said she was clearing table. This place probably has 50 people working dinner shift  but she had to bus tables.Another  got drinks but waiter disappears and doesn\'t come back for order. Again it\'s just odd because there\'s so many other employees milling about. There were honestly 3 employees blowing bubbles in next section while all the tables in ours were looking around for service. Eventually returned and he got ""behind"". Co-workers should have helped???Anyway  writing this is cathartic  and I seriously hope BJs management reads and addresses issues. Lots of choices these days and successful restaurant need food and service to be great..."
Tim T.,Monterey Park  CA,0,8,,11/1/2017,3.0,First time going to this BJ's  but frequent my neighborhood location. Was seated immediately with a party of five  and the restaurant did not seem overtly busy  but once ordering  the food took very long to come out and did not all come out at the same time. In addition to this  there were no place settings at the table until I asked for them after receiving the food. I ordered the Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs  which I had ordered before from a different BJ's and thoroughly enjoyed  but for some reason it was so unbelievably spicy at this location I could barely get through each bite and my lips were left burning. My friend tried it as well and confirmed to me it wasn't just due to my taste buds (and  to note  I do enjoy spicy things  but this was an intense  unwanted spice). Service was decent but nothing special  otherwise. Better ambience than most BJ's  however  and I enjoyed the setup of the restaurant. All in all  I would come to this location again (and order something different) but prefer my neighborhood BJ's.
Anna A.,Compton  CA,0,18,10,7/18/2016,1.0,Ordered avocado roll.. Avocado is dark. Either it was sitting for a long time or they just like to serve old avocado .. Not just on one roll - majority of it. And then I ordered tortilla soup.. Umm not hot... They actually pour the soup inside the bowl.. Is that suppose to be a show??? But it's not hot!? And we told the waiter that we were going to share the avocado roll.. Where's my freakin extra plate? It should be obvious !? Omfg!!! $1 tip!!!! Dick! This place is horrible . Never will I come here again and... I should of Yelp it first before I came. I don't remember being this bad ohh and the tortilla soup is too salty.. Wow.. waste of time and money .
Zolzaya M.,Pasadena  CA,39,6,2,1/15/2017,1.0,How come its BJ and be so lousy???!!! I love BJ's in Glendale and decided to give it a try. Pasadena BJ food is worse than Dennys'. And the server almost got my friend's 1 y.o son with the hot water. Partially she did. And she did not even apologize. By the time she come to our table  she said oh the water is hot be careful and she herself dropped the tray. Hot water was spilled on the table and little droplets hurt the baby and baby cried. And she said I told you the water was hot. We were in shock and told server the fact that she was the one with hot water on the tray. She was extremely rude. At least a sorry would have been helpful.
Kimberly J.,Altadena  CA,0,5,,2/8/2017,4.0,So here's the thing...I don't have great experiences at restaurants. Usually the server is too slow or the food isn't cooked to my specifications...something ALWAYS goes wrong. I came to BJ'S Pasadena after work for a late-ish dinner with 2 friends. The hostess? definitely leaves something to be desired. I asked for a specific server & she acted like I was speaking a foreign language. But this review is not about her.This review is about MICHAEL. Michael is the best server I've had here in a LONG time! He is super attentive  but not pesty. Anything you need  he is on top of it. From explaining to you how the different beers taste to recommending a favorite dish. If you feel conversational  he'll chat with you. If not  he will serve you promptly and efficiently. Any time I feel like going to BJ'S  it will be Pasadena and I will only sit in Michael's section. I suggest you do the same!
Isobel L.,Los Angeles  CA,2253,640,3398,11/22/2014,4.0,"Second time visiting this BJ\'s tonight with friends to watch the annual classic UCLA-USC game! Overall  a pretty great place to watch the game  and  no  I am not being biased because UCLA won! GO BRUINS!!!!!!!!!!!!!4/5: Ambiance. Nicer than your average BJ\'s  with wood paneling and good lighting. Gigantic big-screen TV\'s abound. We did have to ask the manager to turn up the volume for the big game but that was taken care of with no problems. There seemed to be a high ratio of Bruins to Trojans but maybe that\'s because the Trojans got quieter and quieter as the game progressed and started sneaking out in their own version of the walk of shame? No hipsters. Yay. 5/5: Alcohol. A nice draft beer for $5.25? Sounds good to me. Seems like they have lots of your standard ""brewhouse"" options. 3/5: Dining. The menu options here offer nothing to write home about. The best thing I had turned out to be the Ghiradelli chocolate chocolate chip ice cream. My friends seemed to enjoy their pizza. 5/5: Service. Our server Marvina did an outstanding job of taking all of our orders  keeping them all straight (there were six of us)  and took really good care of us. 4/5: Parking. Parking meters are free after 5 pm a couple of blocks away (near City Hall)."
Jaimi G.,Los Angeles  CA,234,180,286,2/22/2016,4.0,The Parmesan crusted chicken is amazing! I swapped my broccoli for Brussels sprouts instead. The pizookie is bomb too! I would get the mini pizookie's so you can try more than one lol I gave it 4 stars tho because my Brussels sprouts were lackluster
Vivian S.,Alhambra  CA,197,184,655,12/23/2015,2.0,Came here on a Friday night  not to busy. The two of us got seated on a pretty empty side of the restaurant. It took a while for our food to come  very disappointing. It also took a while for us to get utensils once our food came. In addition to that  it took a while for us to get our boxes and check as well. The food was ok  I had the Root Beer Ribs and a small pizza. I wouldn't say it was worth the trouble. Next time  I'll go with ordering it togo.
Andrea O.,Pasadena  CA,45,5,1,9/25/2016,1.0,I Normally don't write this type of reviews or even review  I work in the industry and I must say this was the WORST experience I've ever had at a restaurant/bar.We usually go to Bjs cause we love the piezooki among other stuff  But If you read  definitely don't go to this one  Our server lady was obviously not trained to provide customer service  Got the order all wrong at different times  Came to check on us every 30 min (Sunday lunch EMPTY shift) and also an over charge on our check  If managers or Corp read this  Your bussines in Pasadena will go down sooner than later  It's sad to hire this type of people even tho it's a corporation.
Ashleigh M.,Charleston  SC,49,16,10,9/25/2016,4.0,So much fun! Loved the interior decorating- reminded me of the bank in Harry Potter . We had no wait time for dinner on a Saturday evening  and our beers were delicious - double the alcohol content of a Guinness . The food was yummy too  and if I had room for dessert I would've wanted to definitely try some! Very happy with this location (have also visited another spot in L.A.).
Tammy C.,San Dimas  CA,308,468,874,6/22/2016,2.0,I have always had a positive relationship with BJ's  so when we had to chose a place to eat at for father's day  I was happy to go to BJ's. As we entered we were greeted and given a pilsner father's day glass  with some coupons. The place was relatively empty since it was about 10:30. We ordered our food............and waited forever. Even the table next to us with a larger party  that came after us got their food. Finally it arrives  well everyone in my party gets their food.......I wait. The manager walls by to see if our food is good  she doesn't notice that I have nothing  and keeps going  as I am about to tell her  she just keeps walking. Finally it comes out  looks good  I bite...yuck  the bottom toast was burnt  so I wait to tell the waiter  but I get hungry  so I eat the middle of 1/2 the sandwich. He finally arrives  and since my party is all done  I just ell him to take it. He offers to send the manager  but for what? This BJ's disappointed me. Next time...Yard House for me
Danielle H.,Corvallis  OR,82,196,73,12/18/2015,3.0,Meh. Meh. Meh. This is my first time to this location. I ordered a bowl of clam chowder that came out barely warmed as if it was just microwaved for like 45 seconds to be reheated to be served. It was salty. We also ordered the BJ'S favorite pizza and it was nothing special. Only reason I'm giving this review a 3rd star was cause our waiter was attentive and was always around when we needed something. Easy going guy and always kept our drinks filled.
Emerald S.,Glendale  CA,59,86,130,7/24/2016,4.0,I really enjoy going to BJ's they have excellent customer service skills and always provide me with great food. I like to get the garden medley salad I believe it's not even on the menu but they still make it for me and for my dessert I like to get the Pizookie.
Hadir E.,Stevenson Ranch  CA,1,10,,3/19/2017,5.0,Yummy food  friendly waiter. The wait was reasonable  its very convenient because it stays open late.
Ada F.,Pasadena  CA,650,313,1419,10/11/2014,4.0,Been here a few times and each time I see they have significantly improved their food and customer service. This place is good to watch games at. They have good finger foods. I like how there is a huge selection of vegetarian dishes. Today I tried their veggie omelet with fruit. I also ordered their spinach stuffed mushrooms. Everything was on par in terms of flavor. For dessert we tried a new flavor for their pizookie. They now have a peanut butter s'mores and a salted caramel. We got the peanut butter s'mores. When the dessert arrived we noticed it was missing the scoop of vanilla ice cream. The server was apologetic and he hooked us up with an extra scoop of ice cream. We will be back for more goodness.
Darla D.,San Dimas  CA,165,881,671,1/18/2016,4.0,I met my gfs here for dinner. I parked in the structure but it was a bit expensive. I would have been better off finding parking on the street. Our server was friendly and attentive. Im not much for burgers but I had one and it was great. I love the berry cider! I would definitely come back to this location for another burger and some berry cider ...
Susanne R.,San Diego  CA,439,524,880,2/21/2016,4.0,It took forever to get a table for 5 on a Saturday lunch time but once we were seated our waiter was ready to take our drinks order. I had the flatbread pizza that is essentially a Margarita pizza but they call is something else. Really tasty with a crisp crust and fresh tomatoes and basil. Yum. My friends had the deep dish pizza and they loved the different versions. They said the deep dish was not soggy gooey but had the right balance of fried versus doughy texture.
Jorge H.,San Marino  CA,9,7,1,4/19/2017,4.0,I like this place even if it has that franchise feel. The beer is their own and the jambalaya is a must.
Steven S.,San Gabriel  CA,71,14,4,8/14/2016,5.0,Came here with my girlfriend and the service and food was excellent will be coming back in the near future!
Alex S.,Long Beach  CA,247,8,5,6/10/2016,1.0,I went on a busy post graduation night so I expected it to be busy. I've worked in the restaurant industry as a server before. Service was not good. The guy who was supposed to be our server was busy trying to close out a large party who looked like they split checks. Regardless if that was the situation they shouldn't have sat us yet. We waited for over 20 minutes for bar drinks. 50 minutes in and we have only seen our server assistant a few times. Food came out. 2 out of 3 plates were cold.......I doubt I will return here. Very disappointing. There are plenty of other options around.
Dr. Darrick S.,Pasadena  CA,9,53,270,6/8/2016,2.0,The girl bartenders suck here. Totally incompetent. Haven't refilled my beer or ask me if I wanted a beer. As for food  silver ware and napkins. They forget about you. It's a good thing the food is good.
Sonia P.,Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,10/11/2017,1.0,"The service was horrendous. The waiter who took our order was very professional and friendly. When a girl brought my steak dinner over  I asked her where my mashed potatoes were she had a blank look and said""oh they had to make a new batch"" then she walked away! No apology or anything. I guess I had to wait for my friendly waiter. When I told him I never got my potatoes he said ""they didnt give you the potatoes? Sorry  I\'ll get you your potatoes right away."" The next rude girl who came over brought us our dessert. As I asked for extra utensils  I realized she was gone. Rude  rude   rude! Who hired these girls? They seemed miserable. No smile  no questions. Not service oriented individuals. The food  drinks  and dessert were good  but the service was horrible. Again  the waiter was good. It was his female counterparts who were really unprofessional and unfriendly. The management is completely at fault. They are not training their staff properly. Maybe they aren\'t hiring the right type of people. I will never go back there again."
Annie L.,Cerritos  CA,3,86,127,1/16/2016,4.0,I normally wouldn't write a review for a major chain restaurant  but the customer service I experienced compels me to recognize their good work. But first  the mandatory food review. I haven't been to a BJ's in a few years. I liked their food overall  but I had not been back since they revised their menu to the current one. So everything but the pizza and pizookies seemed new to me. I ordered a sandwich and shared 2 appetizers with my friend. Here is the breakdown:Chicken Pesto Sandwich:Comes with a salad that could have been a little crisper  but the dressing was light and tasty. The sandwich was more of a melt. Hot and cheesy (sounds like the perfect man). The chicken itself wasn't my favorite. Seemed over-salted and a little dry. My fix to that was dipping the sandwich in ranch dressing. Hehe...what? It worked! Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts:Get it. Just do it. They're good. Don't argue with me. Order them. Note: they come in more quantity than in the picture. Maybe the brussel sprouts in the pictures are ginormous. Guacamole and Chips:I took a leap of faith and hoped the guac and chips would be tasty...and I regret doing that. Yes  the guacamole was made of real avocados. But the portion was small. We ran out of guac before the chips were finished :( And I was eating it kind of sparingly. Now on to the reason I started writing this review. I had a little bit of a mishap with my food that resulted in me asking for a refund. They were more than willing to do so. AND they also comped our Party Pizookie. I don't even get treated this well on my birthday! Thank you BJ's Pasadena!Parking is underground or street. Underground parking gets 90 minutes validation at a self-serve machine near the entrance to the underground lot. BJ's themselves doesn't offer validation. For our 2.5 hour stay  it came out to $3.
Anthony R.,Baldwin Park  CA,24,15,1,3/2/2017,1.0,"This was quite possibly one I\'ve the most inconvenient lunch I have ever experienced. The restaurant was just about empty when I arrived in a party of three for a 13:00 lunch time. I noticed hardly anyone in the beautifully architectured building  so I went to the bar high tops for quick lunch special service. Little did I know I would wait for all of service to be provide at the same time. It was a bit ridiculous. I felt like I was in a reality show testing ones patience and thinking of how only in Pasadena  CA would this happen and I was not going to sign a consent to film form. I ordered a vodka soda with a water one the side  Brussels Sprouts and the other two orders in the party were a soup and salad with waters. The soups and salads are ready made dishes  meaning you set it and serve it. However  it took a total of 20 min to serve cold soup (oil had elevated to the top of the cooking soup) and salad. It was what appeared to be some one who served the first two dishes and waited for the third dish to be ready. All at the same time forgetting the drinks  because everything was served at the same time. I mean EVERYTHING. When we asked for an second serving of the endless soup and salad. It took another lengthy amount of time before we saw a soup  and the soup order was the wrong one. In the end we paid for a $30 something lunch that really made me just want to walk out in that bill. When we called to share our experience  we were sent an generic apology letter with $15 in credit. This was very disparaging for the brand. The location is perfect for a great restaurant  or service team that actually cares for their customers  rather than pretentiously running thru the early crowd  assuming that they don\'t tip anyway so what\'s the point. PS just cause your ""in the kitchen""  doesn\'t mean you cannot be heard. Hope you get better BJ\'s. You can quote me!"
Kay K.,Los Angeles  CA,20,4,,4/5/2017,2.0,I love the ambience of this BJ's location  but I really dislike when I place an online pick up order they are so slow or they accidentally give my order to someone else.
Telma E.,Downey  CA,1,33,18,3/14/2017,1.0,I went with a party of 10 people  we got the WORST service ever!!! Drake the manager evem came to aoplogize yet nothing changed. None of us got the correct food. Our drinks took over half an hour. Drake came over again to apologize and offered free desserts that never came out. We all were very upset  to top it off the bill was a mess and took over 40 mins to actually get paid Never again WORST service ever!!!
Aye J.,San Diego  CA,276,12,5,6/10/2017,5.0,There were some problems during our dinner. But our server was really nice. The manager was also very understanding and accommodating. In the end he comped everything except the one alcoholic drink. Which I really appreciate.
Heather U.,San Gabriel  CA,5,37,6,2/22/2017,1.0,Went for lunch special. Chicken  bacon  ranch Piadana was not what I expected. It came with fries  and the fries tasted better. The piadana was small and not filling. Not worth the $10.60 price.
Peter M.,Hermosa Beach  CA,0,4,,3/9/2017,5.0,Not sure why the rating is so low. I come here once a week for lunch and the service and food are very good. Recommend the Turkey Burger and the Chili.
Beatriz L.,Los Angeles  CA,0,6,,6/19/2016,1.0,Food wasnt worth what i spent  no flavor whatsoever other then that the service was excellent but would give props to Ariana who was great at taking our order and making sure we didnt needed anything.Wouldnt come back overall not worth my money.
Sarahmi H.,Alhambra  CA,0,16,23,1/15/2017,1.0,Waited 30 minutes for our appetizers  another 29 minutes for our entrees  food is slow  service is slow. Got our rib-eye streak  ordered medium came out extra well done (burned) on the outside and under cooked on the inside. The restaurant must not paying the chiefs enough money that they had to mess up the food so bad to piss off the customers. We ended up sending the food back and left with empty stomach. Horrible dining experience.
Plan B.,San Diego  CA,51,87,532,7/20/2015,5.0,"Review 76Why? Pizza  beer  wings  dessert and the awesome video wall! Yes welcome to one of the most known sport bar chains I so much enjoy visiting. This BJ\'s Restaurant is the same as all other when it comes to its menu and ambiance. They have a rewards program available for those frequent visitors. When signing up you\'ll instantly get a free Pizooki  from there you earn point for free meals. I\'ve had excellent service starting with our host  hot tasty food and great waiters. I yet to have a bad experience at this location. Parking is subterranean with an entrance on Colorado: no validation!!Plan BI only submit 5-Star reviews  if I post a review it\'s cause \'hat\'s off"" I recommend the establishment and will return for another experience. I don\'t feel the need to submit a review with less than 5-Stars  regardless if I check in  submit a picture or tip. I suggest Yelp change it\'s reviews to a category scoring system  then is when I can be fair and review each place I visit.PM me if you like additional information."
Kristine B.,Glendora  CA,4,2,2,11/5/2016,1.0,Horrible service. We have been here 3 times. So third strike-- you're out! Each time we have waited for food for longer than 40 minutes. Got food with no setting. If I could rate no stars I would.
Gabriela T.,Los Angeles  CA,78,10,4,10/2/2016,4.0,I'll be honest a few things were off  but a chewy steak is out of the server and managers hand so I'll give them a 4. The manager drake was very good to us. You can tell he has great customer service skills. Thank you Drake for the dessert and for keeping us updated on the food. Really appreciate it !
Maggie B.,Los Angeles  CA,33,2,,3/6/2017,5.0,If your in. The area please request to sit with Kaitlin she was the absolute best we were there for quick drinks and she managed to. Make our entire night ! Great service defiantly will be coming back to this location !! Thank you Kaitlin
Clare F.,Melbourne  Australia,39,12,,12/4/2016,3.0,This rating is mainly for customer service. Our food was accidentally dropped on its way out and the staff were super great about telling us  discounting the bill and generally being lovely. I had the holiday special - steak was a bit over cooked but pretty delicious. A lot of food for the price including their weird cookie dessert which was super good. And the beer list is extensive and good. My partner had the salmon quinoa salad which was average and the deep dish pizza was more like a thick crust than deep dish. All round good experience for a mid level family restaurant.
Ernie M.,Pasadena  CA,186,32,34,6/9/2016,4.0,Very Friendly Waitress and the food was great. I live in Pasadena and I have only been to this BJ's twice. I will make sure to come here more often.
Barry M.,Huntington Beach  CA,115,7,,7/21/2017,1.0,The service at this BJs is not worth the 1 star I gave them and certainly not worth the 2.5 stars they have. I ordered take out and was told the order would be ready in 20 min. When I arrived the food was right behind the hostess table. The manager was at the hostess table and another employee was there sorting silverware. I told them I was there for pick up and they said someone would be with me shortly. Five minutes later I had not been helped. I asked if one of them could get someone so I could pay and leave. The manager in an i dignant way said I would just have to wait. Finally after almost 20 minutes I left with no food. BJs is on the busiest street in Pasadena yet the place was empty. Its a shame this one store can ruin a franchises reputation.
Jasmyn V.,Pasadena  CA,120,2,,7/20/2017,5.0,Ahhh I worked a busy shift and I wanted to relax with some beer and appetizer I didn't wanna deal with people or anything so I went to the bar and the bar tender Ariana was amazing she definitely lifted me from the funk I was in food was great and the drinks were even better I went home in a better mood friendly and funny
Daniel A.,Justice  IL,16,16,2,5/23/2016,5.0,I love this place so much!Amazing food. Everything on the menu is great and there is something for everyone.Great lunch specials  great dinners  great for drinks.It's all here!Beautiful location.Nice atmosphere.Quick compared to other BJs locations on service and food time.I can't express my love for the avo egg rolls and chicken California club enough!!They're must haves!
Sonal P.,Orange County  CA,177,560,12,9/8/2015,2.0,I love the salads and pizza at BJs  but this location got 2 stars from me because of the service...not so much the food. It was a Thursday evening and pretty quiet inside the restaurant. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks  apps  and entrees. While there was only one person working the bar  it seemed like all the other staff must have gone home for the day. Numerous people had kept asking about their food  including us. When our salads came out - mine was actually entered in wrong. While I waited another 20 min for a salad  I watched in complete hunger at everyone else with their food around me. Once my salad arrived  the pizza came within a few minutes - leaving me with a bunch of plates and little to no space for anything else.I was pretty annoyed at the amount of food I had in front of me - not to mention  by the time I finish my salad  the pizza was already cold and didn't taste as great to eat. I'm really disappointed in this location BJs  The service and experience of this location  fell short of everything I enjoy about the sports bar.
Adeline P.,Newhall  CA,33,16,14,8/7/2016,3.0,This is my to go to bjs this place is so goood. There's one by my house but this one's the best. The foods always so good and fresh. Always clean and the waiters honestly always make my dinner lunch better cause of their fun attitudes.Just one complain I went in with my friend yesterday at night and we got a pitcher of our favorite beer Jeremiah Red and it tasted like it was from the bottom of the keg mentally IDK but we couldn't finish it besides that everything's pretty good.
Ana Z.,Los Angeles  CA,10,91,,12/6/2016,5.0,i had a really nice experience here. katie was our server on saturday night and she was great. as a vegan  there's really only a couple things i can have (guac and chips  pasta marinara) and she suggested ways to jazz it up. also  it was my boyfriend's birthday and she brought out a mini pizooki  which i had no idea even existed. the building used to be a bank and is gorgeous inside. chandeliers  ceilings  the works. i look forward to coming here again! thanks katie!
Jose L.,Middleburg Heights  OH,0,1,,1/24/2017,2.0,The beer was quite ok but the service and food didn't match it. I ordered an appetizer salad and an entree after being asked a couple of times if I didn't want any starter. Then  both were served at the same time. I had to eat the main dish first (sirloin) otherwise it would get cold.I asked for a medium rare sirloin and this was over cooked and also the meat cut was far from a prime piece. The place was not even busy (early in the evening)  so it can't be attributed to stress in the kitchen.It is a pity  because the beer is nice  the Art Deco socialist style decoration is very neat and the space is beautiful .
Karl J.,San Pedro  CA,0,14,4,1/3/2017,5.0,We had lunch here a couple of weeks ago; great place! Amazing building (an old bank)  terrific service  friendly staff and best tasting BJ's I've been to so far (this is the 4th place I've been too). The boneless sriracha chicken was excellent  as was the deep dish pizza. I'll be back for sure!
Liam M.,Downtown  Los Angeles  CA,194,9,12,8/14/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I didn't do this the first time I came here months ago  but coming here again and the service still being horrible is uncalled for. Does it really take that much to acknowledge the table and bring us water?? The excuse is there systems are down. I'm sorry  it doesn't take computers to bring us water!!! Do not eat here. Go to the Glendale or Burbank one. Bj's you suck! Oh and let me add  both times the restaurant was completely not busy!
Amy A.,Los Angeles  CA,0,11,3,12/8/2016,2.0,The rib eye steak was burn and too well done when I asked for a medium well. The thin cut fries tasted like old fries and refried again when served. The ribs were ok. Nothing stood out like a wow. The meat was tender. Fresh mozzarella abd tomato salad was good. Clam chowder was a bit salty and not hot. It came out just a little bit warm as if it was put on the soup bowl for awhile before served. White peach margarita tasted terrible. I loved the service. Our server  Thomas  was great! He was very attentive. 5 stars for his service.
Stevo O.,San Gabriel  CA,192,603,934,1/30/2016,3.0,"Okay  I had a hundred dollar gift certificate for BJ\'s  and wanted to use it  as I did not want to spend too much cash  after the holidays. We chose a different BJ\'s location i Pasadena to try it out  so we parked in the underground parking  and just walked up to the restaurant. It was amazingly not packed  like the one in Arcadia  and I was wondering why. Well  it seems the service is not the best here  and they don\'t validate parking! Well  as my boss says  ""bummer"". On to the food  which was just meh in my opinion. The fish tacos were mushy  and the sauce had no flavor whatsoever. My wife was relatively happy with her pasta  and the kids were okay with their pasta and hamburger. The only thing outstanding here to me was their television at the bar  which seemed to stretch at least 10 feet across. If I were into sports  this place might seem a little better. But with the poor service  and lack of taste in their food  I\'ll try another restaurant and spend cash for a decent meal."
Rodny B.,Glendale  Los Angeles  CA,31,2,,6/17/2017,2.0,Honesty came in thinking someone would help me and my family to get us seated  but it was as if I was a goats in the room waiters walked passed me without acknowledging that if I have been helped out or not although the food was good just need to step up customer service at this location
Tiffany D.,Rosemead  CA,8,6,,11/22/2016,2.0,I've been to this location for a couple times and neither time was that great. The last time was not very impressive. First of all  the service was so slow. We've been looking for our waiter and had no idea where he is. Took forever to wave down our waiter and then finally able to place our orders. We ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip as Appetizer. The Dip was too cheesy for my taste. I can barely taste any of the veggies in there. Hardly any artichoke chunks were in there. I ordered the Garlic Shrimp and Asparagus Pasta for my entree. There was practically no flavor in there  where I had to add salt on my own. The shrimp does not look like what you see in the picture. It came out as tiny  baby shrimps without any shrimp flavor. I like to go to BJ's  but not sure if it was this location or just a bad day for them. Was not impress at all.
J M.,Los Angeles  CA,303,7,,8/14/2016,1.0,I love the BJs restaurant. This branch has the worst...service...ever...we weren't attended to for 25minutes. My group and I literally were seated and were not asked for drinks or appetizers for close to 30minutes. This being a service job  you need to try better...normally I wouldn't give bad reviews  but...this happened twice in the same location. 1 star for service and my experience at this location
Ee C.,Pasadena  CA,0,17,11,5/23/2016,5.0,Spent my birthday dinner here last year  and my birthday lunch here again this year! Always a great time at BJs! Special shoutout to our waiter Jimmy H for singing a birthday song for me! :)
Michelle M.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,76,82,72,12/19/2016,3.0,Went to BJ's for lunch today  and was a little disappointed. Let me first start by saying I love BJ's and go to the Ontario  CA location all of the time  but this was my first visit to the Pasadena location. So went in around 12:30  and surprisingly it wasn't that busy  but it took our sever 10 minutes to even acknowledge us  and 45 minutes to bring our food. When asked why it was taking so long  she said the kitchen was backed up. I'm sorry  we only ordered a salad and a club sandwich. And no  the restaurant was not even busy. Maybe 10 tables if that  and not nearly the same amount of business during dinner hours or on the weekend. Love BJ's but probably won't return to this location because of their poor customer service  and nonchalant attitude by the staff.
Sarah C.,Pasadena  CA,9,155,73,7/12/2015,2.0,The brussel sprouts were fantastic  as well as the mashed potatoes. That's what gets the stars.My mojito was loaded with so much alcohol I could even drink it. Same goes for the pia colada. The calamari was one of the worst I've had. He watermelon feta salad was done lazily and awful. Our service was bad. What's weird is I remember having the deep dish pizza at a BJs years ago and it was amazing. I bragged about it and thought we should go. What a waste of money! The pizza was awful...awful. It was doughy and lacked flavor. I will not be back.
Robert F.,Overland Park  KS,152,166,55,7/8/2015,4.0,So this place has everything! Pick the type of food you want and it is here with some of their premium local made beer. This is one of the few times I have eaten at a BJ's and was excited to go thinking that they were only here in California... turns out I was wrong about that they have them in Texas as well. Maybe we will get one in KC eventually.Our waitress Sarah was fantastic. And was quick with recommendations and genuinely friendly and interested in us and our choices. The food returned quick and was fantastic. The beer was chilled and delicious.Also then there was the desert... cookie in the little skillet type thing with ice cream on it. Just phenomenal.
Frankie A.,Monterey Park  CA,46,28,32,1/16/2016,1.0,Worst pizza ever. It's the BJs favorite and it was cold and not good. We asked the waiter to hear it again since the cheese wasn't even melted the. It came back lukewarm. Sad. Never got chili flakes or park cheese until we were thoroughly not appetizer anymore.
Allie P.,South Pasadena  Los Angeles  CA,973,610,1686,2/13/2014,3.0,Decent late night HH deals.Bar section seating if there for late night HH.Newly designed restaurant - looks very nice inside... I like to look up (if seated in the bar area).TVs everywhere.Service is alright  the usual.There is now a valet available if you don't like finding parking on your own... luckily I don't have to ever worry about parking in Old Town.WHEN IS HH?Mon-Fri 3-7pm Sun-Thurs 10pm-Close$4 - All BJ craft beers and call drinks- Flatbread (margherita fresca and california club)- Boneless wings$5- Mojitos and Martinis- Spinach and Artichoke Dip (HH sized)- Chicken Pot Stickers (HH sized)- Angus Beef Sliders (HH sized) $6- Select wines- Chicken Lettuce Wraps- Santa Fe Spring Rolls- Avocado Egg Rolls- Mini Deep Dish PizzaAdditional Notes:Wine Down Tuesdays - half off by the glass or bottleThursdays - $3.50 per pint (all BJ craft beers)I was pleased with the food and the prices were decent. Liked how they're an option for late night HH on weeknights also. :]
Sam S.,Washington  DC,92,201,657,5/21/2015,4.0,I was pleasantly surprised by BJs large menu. The dining space is very large and the noise level is pretty loud. There is something for everyone on the menu. I was able to order a kale salad with shrimp that was quite tasty. Next time I will ask for light dressing. The service was on the slower side but it was understandable due to how busy they were. They have a very large center tv at the bar making it a great place to go have a drink and watch the game.They have some large tables so it's a good option for entertaining groups.
Brittnee M.,Riverside  CA,62,2,,10/20/2016,1.0,Worst BJ's experience. I mean what am I really expecting as far as service from a chain but we waited 50 minutes for an appetizer that eventually came AFTER the entrees. And had to ask 2 different wait staff for silverware. Manager was MIA and didn't address any issues. Basically indifferent to piss poor service.
Martinez M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,16,,5/23/2017,5.0,Food was great and came out quickly also our sever was great he was attentive and greeted us right away. Out of all the times I've came to this location this was definitely the best experience since our server was great had a lot of small tables and didn't forget about us once while other times I've came the server has been slammed and couldn't handle as many tables which sometimes makes me wonder about the management. Also the only thing I would change would be to be greeted as soon as I arrive  I personally don't like having to be the one the say hi first when I arrive into the lobby.
Kristen S.,Newport Beach  CA,158,33,2,6/20/2016,1.0,"tried to go for dinner on a very slow Monday at 5pm. The hostess didn\'t even say hello to me as I walked in and when I said ""table for 4"" she simply grabbed the menus and sat me in the only table that was in the sun. After not being helped for over 15 minutes the hostess walked by so I asked if we could get some help from our waiter. She immediately went back to the hostess stand and started texting. We walked out after 30 minutes of no help and were barely noticed. Yikes!"
Linda B.,Altadena  CA,0,7,,4/29/2017,2.0,The food was fair. We waited for 25 minutes for our meal. The wrong pizza was brought to the table. Then I was given fish and chips with cocktail sauce. When I asked about tarter sauce  the waitress told me the kitchen told her to tell me there was none. She did not tell me this initially.so  to lick our wounds  we asked for a poozookie that never came. The manager told me that he would get me a credit for one for another time. I usuallh just go with things...this wad a bit much.
Brad S.,Los Angeles  CA,194,252,2,12/15/2015,2.0,Lordy - this place has gone down in quality of food and service. The wifey and I would typically frequent BJ's if the Yard House was packed. We stopped by for a quick bite and drinks to end a hard day.We'd ordered a BJ's Classic Combo Pizza and Crispy Honey Chicken Salad. The pizza was primarily thick dough with minimal cheese  sausage  pepperoni et al. What was more deflating is that this picture of the pizza was 1/2 the thickness as shown on the menu. The Crispy Chicken Salad - the chicken tenders were very overdone; if you want real crispy  hard chicken tenders - this is the salad you should order. The last time we were there we'd ordered BJ's flatbread Margherita Fresca  but when it arrived it was missing the shredded basil. Once we informed the waitress it took almost ten minutes to get the basil and the flatbread was cold. I had hoped BJ's would have improved  but alas not....it may be a long time before we venture to BJ's again.
Aime J.,Culver City  Los Angeles  CA,85,107,240,12/5/2015,1.0,Not my favorite BJ's location. I've dined here multiple times; lunch  dinner  on and off peak times. I've had a number of waiter's I wasn't necessarily happy with. Every time I come here to grab drinks they throw me a little attitude when asking to see my ID. I understand that they need to verify my age  but there's a polite way to do so. There is a line between being friendly and coming off as rude and I've had multiple waiters here cross that line.The food is alright. I usually build a pizza or try a pasta. Last week we tried their new Siracha Chicken Bacon Mac n Cheese. Do not recommend it. Note that the pasta used is penne  not macaroni. The cheese sauce used tasted almost like nacho cheese and made it difficult to eat. I like their Honey-Crisp Chicken Salad. That's probably my go-to and I hate ordering salads at restaurants  but this is a pretty filling salad even between two people. Not too heavy and also a little refreshing.Pizookies are always to die for! I've never had a bad experience with pizookies.Last time a waiter was kind enough to help us sample a couple of their brews to help us decide what to drink. I like light beers and recommend their Brewhouse Blonde or their Piranha Pale Ale. For those into darker brews  go for the Nutty Brewnette or Jeremiah Red. Or for those just looking for something sweet to drink try the Berry Burst Cider! I usually love going to BJs with a group of friends  but I really do not recommend this location. Though this is also the slowest location I've been to so far.
Victor A.,North Hills  CA,1,22,61,6/21/2016,1.0,This place sucks they should closed this place down . Food has no flavor  takes for ever to be serve. I don't recommend this dump.
Destiny C.,South Pasadena  CA,0,3,,8/15/2017,1.0,I usually come here every once in a while since I live so close. The service is always excellent and then I came yesterday! I couldn't believe how terrible the service was! My friends and I were put near the bar area and no one ever came to our table! It was not even busy! I asked the hostess if we can move into a booth since no one seemed to notice we were there! She said if someone left and someone cleaned the table  then we can move into one! After another 15 minutes a booth was available and we moved into it by ourselves  still not acknowledged by any waiter. I even saw 3 workers standing at the front just talking to one another not even caring that we hadn't been helped! There we are  about 50 minutes without anybody coming to us. Finally a waiter named Mary approached us and took our orders. 15 minutes went by and no drinks! It was terrible! Already about an hour and we hadn't even received our beverages. When our food finally came  my friends order was not what she ordered. I know I live closeby here but I don't think I'll come to this one again! Horrible horrible service!
Meka G.,Pasadena  CA,0,3,2,10/21/2016,1.0,no point of visiting this bj's ever again! worse service and burnt steak ever!!!!!!took the waiter to walk past us 3 times to notice us! food came out warm  burnt and i didn't finish my meal! 3 bites of my burnt steak and it ruined my appetite!!!
Dorian W.,Sacramento  CA,0,2,,10/20/2016,1.0,The service is horrendous.To wait 45 minutes on just a baked potato is ridiculous. It was not a full lunch crowd. Had a bowl of soup  my co-worker had soup and salad  we all finished and still no baked potato. I dont know if the management is Lackadaisical or the cooks are lackadaisical but if you want for them to grow the potato and then bake it  go to BJ's on E Colorado
Amy Y.,San Diego  CA,600,459,630,10/8/2013,4.0,The restaurant is gorgeous unlike any of the other BJs that I've been to  and I've been to quite a few. Has the old vintage touch to it with the high ceilings and decor. Really worth it to check out. I just discovered the clam chowder here- and they actually have CLAM in it!! SOOOO happy about this. :) Customer service was really good  they got everything we needed and came to check on us on a regular basis. I would definitely say this is the best BJ's I've been to. :)
Anita B.,Jacksonville  FL,6,78,5,8/25/2016,1.0,BJs you have a lot of work to do... I am going to be brief because you already wasted plenty of my time. When a customer sits down greet them in a timely fashion. When you drop food make sure they have plates  silverware and napkins. Check on them regularly so they done have to ASK for everything including the bill. Thanks for wasting my time see you never
G W.,Manassas  VA,346,471,215,7/31/2016,3.0,Ok service here. This location is not as good as the Arcadia BJ's. The Pazookie monkey bread is money. The chef on this shift was real skimpy on the sauces for the apps we ordered.
Nijole T.,Los Angeles  CA,3026,6297,4928,3/6/2015,2.0,Why do I let friends shlepp me to places like this?? Long waits of mediocre service and even less stellar food. I have sampled my way through much of their menu and am usually glad when someone orders a pizza  I get a salad and nab a slice. I had their new BLT salad and while it was OK  it was super tiny and anything but healthy. They ordered a large all meat thin crust and it while it was ok  I prefer the deep dish and toppings other then meat  not BJ's fault.Service is pretty bad  lackluster and rushed  the food just as well.I don't get the hype of this place  really why wait an hour to eat here? It gets so full and you can barely have a descent conversation  not on my dime.
Victor C.,Studio City  CA,0,3,,1/15/2017,1.0,Must have been the worst visit to a BJ restaurant. I went to this location for a birthday celebration on 01/14/17 @9:00P with a party of 10  the service was great until we were seated  the service was extremly slow  and once we did place a food order and after 20min wait  the servers bring the hot food out which looked amazing but unfortunately my guest were stuck just looking at the food since there were NO silverware available! Once i requested for a manager  they sent Drake Beasly-Dining Room manager inwhich just starred at me rolling his eyes and stating what did i want him to do about it  the best he can do is give us plastic forks and spoons  i requested for all the food to be sent back and redo all my orders once someone washes the silverware. After 30 additional minutes the manager comes over and throws his business card to me  and the servers bring is a pile of rolled up single forks and they still have the audacity to bring the same old food from earlier  this time I asked for the head manager since Drake was too busy talking and starring from far with the other servers. Nicole in the other hand was proffesional and made sure that we received fresh food. Waiting for corporate to give me a call back about this.
Zarah B.,Denver  CO,46,39,1,10/21/2016,3.0,This place was ok  but Why so slow? The service was friendly  but where did you go all that time? Not that many tables and we were continually waiting.
Jenny N.,San Diego  CA,519,377,150,9/18/2014,3.0,"I never had lunch at BJ\'s before but apparently they have really good lunch deals supposedly starting at 5.95 and up. Although the portions are not as big as a regular entre  I must say that it\'s still pretty darn big for me. Ordered a club sandwich combo around $7.00 something- which comes with your choice of their soups- I chose clam chowder. The club sandwich came out with a side of frites as well  pretty good! The sandwich itself was good  you really can\'t go wrong ordering a club sandwich - bacon and avocado just makes everything yum. However  the clam chowder itself was super duper salty. I had to drink a big gulp of water every time I take a sip of that chowder. Not good. Friend of mine ordered the ""shrimp scampi pasta with clam chowder (in a bread bowl)."" Although it\'s lunch portion on the lunch menu  it was still a very big portion - this combo is around $16.00. My friend literally just finished her chowder bowl and only touched a bit of her pasta since all their portions were huge. Other friend of mine ordered the unlimited soup & salad. It comes with unlimited salads with the choice of: caesar salad  wedge salad or fresh mozzarella and tomato salad. My friend chose the Caesar salad and it\'s a good portion every time they serve it to her. It\'s unlimited  you can\'t go wrong with eating salad when there\'s a few choices to choose from every time. For appetizer - we ordered the ""Ahi-Poke."" The Ahi-Poke with avocado was a good combo along with the crunchy wonton chips. I thought the Poke was fresh  so that was good. Too bad the Ahi- Poke came out after our meal  not so much of an appetizer for us afterall. Overall  the food was great but I thought the waiting time was a bit too long. Either because my friends and I were on an one hour lunch break - which cuts it really close to have lunch at restaurant or their service is just slow. I felt like the service was just slow but maybe others had a better experience here when they had lunch. The ambience and anterior was great. I can imagine coming here after work to just have a beer and relax. I loved the set-up inside this BJs as well  it\'s different than the other BJs I\'ve been to. Our server was also really awesome  always making sure that we have what we needed  and that my friend\'s salad plate is never empty."
Amy R.,Alhambra  CA,556,89,1197,9/22/2015,4.0,What can I say that isn't true about most slightly expensive nice bar/restaurant chains. The decor was beautiful from the windows to the wall. They had a long and nice bar with a huuuuge flat screen t.v behind it and multiple flat screens throughout the establishment. It is a great place to eat and watch a game or two! The food was good but nothing could be considered scrumptious except of course THE PAZOOKIE which was absolutely scrumptious and melt in your mouth delectable one of a kind treat! I had requested from the get go to get my pazookie first and had to ask 2 more times before the waiter told me there was a mix up and it wasn't even put in the oven yet  by that time I had already recieved my pizza  so I told him to not worry and have it come out later. I was disappointed as I am one of the few fairy people that enjoy their deserts first=) The avocado eggrolls were yummy as well as their ranch and veggie pizza. I ordered roasted garlic in addition to my toppings and it was scrump  but they could have put a lot more. The server was nice even though the food was not served in a timely manner even though the restaurant was not packed by all means. FYI they do not Validate your ticket  so unless you ask they will tell you to walk all the way to the main middle of the paseo to the parking lot entrance to validate your ticket in an automated machine. No bueno with that inconvenience.
Tanisha G.,Pasadena  CA,0,5,1,4/1/2017,5.0,Decided to go to BJ's in Pasadena for a family celebration dinner. Unfortunately  it was a Saturday evening and also during the Final Four so it was packed. Some of the excellent food they always have was unfortunately not perfectly prepared as ordered because of how busy it was I'm sure. No excuse  it's a restaurant right? So why 5 stars? Well  our waitperson Conner was amazingly attentive to our needs  despite how busy it was and he was great even on a night when the kitchen wasn't at its best. The manager  Sean  also was exceptional in his handling of the few errors with our dinner order. Overall  we were very satisfied and left happy. More importantly  we'll be back!
Francis M.,Los Angeles  CA,6,47,13,7/31/2016,3.0,Ambivalent. The food is very good and the pricing is reasonable. Service is fine ..except for one issue..off peak seating. I went there solo in mid-afternoon and seating was confined to the bar and central dining area. There was one seat left at the bar with barely enough room to extend your elbows without impinging on ur fellow diners turf. I hate it when restaurants crowd diners into a small area during slow periods. Is it really that big a deal to spread diners out through the entire dining area and give everyone some comfortable personal space. I would gladly compensate the waiter for walking a few extra steps to deliver my meal if it meant a little peace and quiet. Not all restaurants do this and i think most diners would rather have some separation if possible. I declined the seat and went to a nearby restaurant.
Joanna L.,Los Angeles  CA,482,760,930,9/16/2014,3.0,I have always wonder how this place looked like on the inside since it use to be a bank - so I got a chance to check it out when I had dinner here Sunday night. It was pretty nice since it still had the high ceiling and the bar area was pretty neat - huge big screen TV right smack in the middle. It was pretty busy and we waited about 20 minutes before getting seated. The service was pretty nice  the hostess was nice  complimented my dress and had a brief chat about the weather. Our waitress was friendly too and provided pretty good service. The food was okay - I ordered the BJ Cobb Salad with dressing on the side - the portions are pretty big and I had it for two meals. I also ordered the Corn Fritters - which was okay but not what I expected. My boyfriend ordered the Traditional Wings as entree and also one of their new starter salads (BLT Twist). The wings were good and I like how they didn't drench it in the buffalo sauce rather they had it on the side. Overall I had a good experience with the service and the food. The only one little complaint is probably that the food took quite a long time to come out but they were busy so eh.
Dani K.,San Francisco  CA,1,10,,2/21/2016,1.0,Worst dining experience I've had:15 minutes for waiter acknowledgement20 minutes to get soft drinks45+ minutes to get food (ordered same time as our drinks)Update: I emailed Catherine below  and she never responded.
Adrienne H.,Pasadena  CA,8,77,69,1/13/2016,4.0,This is actually my second time at this location. It's a casual setting like the others but it is located  conveniently  in the Paseo. Our server  Chad  was so friendly. We were greeted with a smile and got a smile every time he came to the table. I knew I wanted some alcohol  just one glass though. I didn't know what I wanted but I knew what I didn't want. He came back with a Strawberry Patch. Very tasty! If I could order a pitcher of it to go  I would have!
Ray D.,Los Angeles  CA,2,35,13,8/29/2016,5.0,We had a family get together and this location was the closest for all of us. We had reservations  were sat right as we walked in and were served by Joe  a really nice guy. Everyone was happy with their food and the service was excellent.
Rebekah R.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,8/10/2016,1.0,Came to this place unfortunately for my Dad's birthday last night. Omg. After waiting and looking  I had to get up and ask the waiter whom I've asked already to bring a side of things so we can eat. It wasn't busy so  I didn't understand why she was pacing the floor and not getting what we had asked for  that would have been the right thing to do  OK. I ordered a Philly cheese steak Pizza deep crust which was very mushy. It did not taste at all like a Philly cheesesteak. It tastes like a supreme which that's not what I ordered. I was so hungry. Stomach was not right after  ugh. I asked for it to be cooked longer and it came out the same way as it was before. I had two pieces and that was it. Ugh  lost my appetite.Ugh  who wants to eat mushy pizza and on top of that something that I didn't order. So so disappointed in this place  service and food. I was really looking forward to having a great evening but unfortunately it was ruined. I will NERVER come back here again or to any BJ's.
K N.,Los Angeles  CA,0,34,12,8/4/2016,2.0,Dinner tonight was very disappointing. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip  a large chicken bacon ranch deep dish pizza  and fish & chips. No complaints about the spinach artichoke dip and the chips tasted like they were freshly made. The pizza was disappointing - it was mostly bread  hardly any sauce or toppings  and a tad soggy. The fish & chips were awful - the worst fish and chips I've ever had. The fish was overfried so it was dark brown and the fish was so dry. We sent it back and we never send food back. They brought us another fish & chips. The second time around  the fish was moist but the fried coating would not stay on. Basically  the fish kept falling apart in your fingers. The service was subpar as well. They must've brought their B-team in today. Guess I won't be back.
Shain O.,Boston  MA,10,119,27,1/10/2016,2.0,"Their happy hour changed from ""Ah  I guess we can go to BJ\'s for Happy Hour  it\'s pretty decent;"" to ""What is the point of going to BJ\'s for Happy Hour?"" They limited the drink and food options so much.The food itself (HH and non-HH) is... fine. I would describe it as slightly higher-class TGI Fridays. It\'s still not very creative and it\'s still terrible for you  but you don\'t feel as terrible about being there because the place is clean and your meal isn\'t served soaking in a pool of congealed fat. This is actually a good place to grab a mid-price burger--the patty is good in terms of quality and size and you get a ton of fries.The service is good and this is a good option place to catch a game in the bar area. There aren\'t a million screens to give you a seizure and the speakers aren\'t projecting six different programs at once."
Jonathan D.,Pasadena  CA,0,1,,9/18/2016,1.0,Twilight ZoneWe took an out of town guest to the Pasadena BJ's:Basically  the goals were fairly simple as for other restaurants:-Waiter takes the order-Someone brings back foodOur BJ's waiter reported to the table a few times  always friendly. After each order  however  rather than fulfilling it  the results were nowhere to be seen -- literally lost. Little did we know. So we ordered a drink while we waited. Twice. We ordered dinner. Twice. Given it was a busy time  we thought  ok  it does take time. An hour later: no soups  no salads  no dinner. Waiter returns  seeming completely disoriented as to why we have no food. Returns to kitchen. Sometime later  returns. More investigations. Order lost. Basically  if we had not asked  it wa s never coming. Apologies ensue; manager appears  offers to pay for some of our food. We were friendly and understanding throughout. 30 minutes or so later  dinner arrives  1.5 hours into this.So they had a problem  and apparently they are going to prove to us how great they are.Let's have some dessert. Change of waiter. New waiter knows nothing of our order. 30 minutes later  no dessert. Criminy  its a single scoop of ice cream and a single cookie. We are friendly and understanding. We joke to the new waiter that we are thinking of ordering some dessert. Another 10-15 minutes later  dessert arrives. The bill arrives  and there is partial coverage  not what we understood was to be provided that the manager had noted. We pay the balance and leave.We are now looking for a restaurant that offers some simple outcomes:-Waiter takes the order-Someone brings back the foodWe imagine that won't be difficult to find.We are friendly  with a new understanding: you do not go to BJ's in Pasadena  ever.
Juan S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,6,,3/7/2017,2.0,"Not coming back again ... it took them about 20 mm for the hostess to acknowledge us they were to busy discussing work issues in front of customers   food was not what I expected I order an rib eye steak medium cook the stake came out really burned from the outside and very raw from the inside ""bloody"" our waitress was very helpful Katlin M"
Avery M.,West Covina  CA,120,27,2,11/3/2015,2.0,"I think that this is the worst BJ\'s that I have been to  and I love BJ\'s. I\'ve been a few different times  and each time has been a disappointment. One instance I can point out is that my friend got one of those Twisted BLT side salads  and the spinach was bad! It was rotten! It stank and tasted awful! The server was nice and switched it out for a Caesar.The next time I went there  with the same friend  she ordered the Gourmet Mac & Cheese. I love that dish  and she and I both get it frequently. When we got it  it was very dry and over-cooked. Not too much cheese sauce  and the pasta was really stiff. My friend pointed that out to the server  who said  ""Well  I\'ve never had it before so..."" and tried to walk away. We had to call after her to have her take it back and bring a new one  which was a little better  thank heavens."
Raj P.,Glendale  CA,0,16,,3/17/2017,1.0,Horrible host service  called ahead to book a table and said 20 min but once I arrived  had to wait another 10 min. Very unprofessional.
denise m.,Los Angeles  CA,9,17,,10/19/2015,1.0,I highly would recommend you DONT come here 1-poor service -they sat us very distant from the rest of the eaters and didn't check on us often - they didn't bring the waters till about 10 minutes of waiting 2- poor quality/food preparation -the pizza we ordered was cold. It had raw onions on it. -The clam chowder was very salty and they don't originally bring it in the bread bowl. They replaced the food once we complained about but by then it was too late. 3-we asked them several times to put the football game on (since we were sitting by ourselves) By the time they accommodated us with the birthday girls dessert and some of the food  my sisters birthday dinner was pretty much a flop. The manager tried to salvage the night. I mean  we appreciate the effort after the fact  but it was easily avoidable.
Suzuki R.,Los Angeles  CA,8,19,15,2/1/2015,5.0,"My family and I visited BJ\'s Pasadena yesterday for dinner (6 in our party). Much  much  more than I expected for BJ\'s but we were in Pasadena after all. They\'re located at the intersection of Colorado Boulevard and Marengo Avenue on the ground floor. Easy parking across the street and in Pasadena be prepared to pay for parking. So if you\'re into architecture then you are sure to enjoy a meal here. We were in an old 1924 Bank building. The columns took my breath away.We shared two appetizer platters  two Caesar salads and one of the signature deep-dish pizzas they\'re known for. My son chose the BBQ chicken pizza. My husband enjoyed the 152"" plasma TV along with his award-winning crafted adult beverage. They were busy so the service was a bit delayed. They tried their best to make us feel as if we were their only customers.I do have to say my favorite was the dessert. My girls devoured their Chocolate Chip Pizookie topped with vanilla ice cream and we shared the Salted Caramel Pizookie. AMAZING! If you\'re into a little sweet and a little salty. It\'s made with caramel cookie dough  almond toffee  pretzel bites and white and dark chocolate chips. Can\'t forget the vanilla bean ice cream  caramel sauce and a Ghirardelli dark chocolate.We we\'re invited by a very special person and have come to look forward to our BJ\'s get togethers."
Taylor H.,Aliso Viejo  CA,595,20,8,4/9/2016,2.0,We came inside BJs and were standing out front for a good 10min without someone taking down our name and asking how many people were in our party. They were understaffed and had no hospitality. Foods always great though! But slow service
James B.,Porter Ranch  Los Angeles  CA,1109,1087,1366,1/24/2013,2.0,This location is huge! As soon as you enter  you'll notice the extremely high ceilings and its old-school architecture. I was kind of taken aback in a good way. Too bad that was the only pleasant part of my visit here.Food: 2 Stars**1) Great Beginnings - This would be a great appetizer for large parties had the food been hot. The spinach dip in the appetizer had the consistency of liquid cement as opposed to a warm dip. What a FAIL. The avocado egg rolls were good  but nothing out of the ordinary. The cheese in the mozzarella sticks were more like string cheese than gooeym melted cheese.2) Mediterranean Pizza - overly salty.3) Jalapeno burger - I liked the overall flavor of the burger because of the spicy kick from the jalapenos  but the patty was soo overly cooked and dry that it ruined my appetite. It was like an equivalent to a dehydrated McDonalds patty.4) Cajun Pasta - nothing special. It's definitely not worth the price or the calories. You can find much better pasta elsewhere for similar or even cheaper prices.Service: 2 stars**I feel like the servers didn't want to check on us because we were a large party and it would've been a hassle for them to get refills for everyone.Parking:The parking sucks here. BJ's is not part of the Paseo  so if you park in the Paseo lot  you won't be able to get validation. You'll have to settle for parking elsewhere. Good luck.
Moe L.,Pasadena  CA,10,27,,12/23/2015,4.0,Love this place! Been coming here for almost a year and it feels like family. Chad was one of our excellent servers who now became manager. He is charismatic and super personable. I'm sure he will do well. It was a well deserved promotion due to his amazing service. We also love the attentiveness we received from Ethan G. who was 100% on when he helped us and dialed into all of our needs. For a guy who just got promoted he seems just as good or better than most of the experienced servers we have had. Good choice to move him up!Sadly  we have had a few scattered servers as well  but very few which is why I chose 4 stars and not 5  but I clearly believe people are doing their best here. That is what counts and why we visit sometimes once a week.
Steve S.,Alhambra  CA,0,6,1,11/30/2016,2.0,Been to BJs several times. The food is always consistant at each location. Service I find not so much. I don't want to use her name but our waitress tonight was not very friendly and she was very robotic. With the parking situation being a hassle we probably won't come to this location again. By the way I did leave the 15% tip.
Pete W.,Pasadena  CA,54,17,16,7/8/2016,5.0,Great food  Excellent service ask for server Chris AKA Bryan.
Hua K.,Arcadia  CA,0,17,195,8/14/2015,1.0,The food received it's different than on the menu   Crispy Calamari is way over cook. Pizza & Clam chowder & shrimp scampi Pasta too salty . 3 manager on duty   in front talking not even say hi  one of the server ( Africa American young lady) walking & eating at same time
Ed M.,Los Angeles  CA,1,82,214,1/18/2016,4.0,Great variety of food.Great parking lot!Beer selection is awesome. Added features: Sport TV programs.
Vanessa B.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,8/6/2016,4.0,Herman was a great waiter. I've been a waitress at a nice fine dining restaurant before and he did everything I was trained to do. He timed out our meals perfectly. Brought each of our entrees at the same time. Made casual conversation but did not linger awkwardly and he wasn't try to up the bill. He simply made us feel comfortable . Today is my boyfriend and i's 4 year anniversary . It was a last minute decision to go to BJs. And without even knowing it  Herman made it a great experience for the both of us :). Thanks man ! Keep up the good work ! ;) - Jamil & Vanessa
Alexander D.,Santa Fe Springs  CA,14,14,12,11/9/2015,4.0,weeknights are chill afff because it's dead so your food comes out fresh as hell. Nicole s was a tight server  If you order Ursula's pussy fibers[Crispy Calamari] ask for xxtra lemon to put all over and then dip in marinara. BAAAAAAWWWMBBBB.The salted caramel pazookie++++++++++++++
Desiree S.,Altadena  CA,147,50,157,4/17/2016,4.0,I had the cobb salad and the root beer wings  both were very quite tasty. I definitely recommend both.
Ara J.,Glendale  CA,0,13,3,1/14/2017,1.0,Soup without spoon. Even after pointing it out to them  they insisted it was under the plate but it wasn't. Had to use a straw instead. Salad came out with the soup but no utensils for anyone. Food is still not out an hour.
Jeff M.,Los Angeles  CA,115,65,36,12/22/2015,4.0,"Hot Tip: Get the Strawberry Splash! It was amazing. I\'m a dude and I loved it!#2: They don\'t do reservations unless you have a large party.Saw other reviews and all I can saw is that I had a good time here! My food was good and the drinks were amazing. Again  the Strawberry Splash above!I had the ""new"" Hickory Brisket and Bacon. It was fantastic. The only problem with it was that it was super filling. But even then  I finished it. My gf got the salad wrap something whatever. I would have remembered it if she would have liked it. She liked my burger and fries though! The other people in my party liked most of their food too. I think it was a pizza. I tried it and it was just ok."
Jenelle B.,Los Angeles  CA,1174,805,687,12/20/2012,4.0,Pizookie!!Like the best thing in this world besides puppies and newborn babies! If you havent had a pizookie you havent lived. Its just a large warm cookie with ice cream on top. Pretty much warm heaven on earth. I LOVE that they allow you to get half of one flavor and half another. So if you wanted an Oreo cookie pizookie and your friend wanted a Chocolate chip pizookie  you wouldn't have to compromise and you could get both in one pan. Trust me its enough to share! Other than that the our waitress was quick and friendly. I went on a Friday and it wasn't crowded at all. It was Black Friday so that might of been the reason. Any-who great place for late night desserts.
Annie M.,Pasadena  CA,0,8,,7/7/2016,5.0,Ernesto was AMAZING. Was a great experience for me and my friends. I have only been to BJs once before but Ernesto's service will definitely have us coming back.
Rossana L.,Alhambra  CA,21,34,20,6/21/2016,1.0,I used to only come for paint nite events and ordered only drinks. (alabama sunset is pretty good) This is my first time dining here (free pizookie day!).20 min wait to be seated when half the restaurant is empty. Another 40 min wait to get our food. Seriously? We arrived at 7:15 pm; it's about to be 9 pm and we still didn't get our dessert.Overpriced restaurant with subpar food and horrible service.And no parking validation .. Theres no way my party could finish eating within the remaining 30 mins even if we were to self-validate in paseo .. Waste of time and money coming here. Never eating here again. More like won't be coming back unless it's for paint nite!
Frank C.,Monterey Park  CA,1,40,,12/29/2016,3.0,Typical of chain restaurants. The food is uninspiring but that is expected. What is unexpected is that service is hit or miss. We have had good servers and ones who are absolutely dreadful.
Melissa B.,Fountain Valley  CA,173,253,90,5/21/2016,4.0,My girlfriend and I came for Paint Nite and our server was great for the event. I forgot her name  but she had the bright red hair. She was on top of everything and doing an excellent job with the group. I had an Irish root beer which was terrific! We had a queso dip with chips and enjoyed it. After the event we got a table at the restaurant and shared the brussel sprouts which was pretty overlooked and burned. It was fair. I wouldn't order it again. We split the pazookie trio  monkey bread  cookies and cream  and chocolate chip cookie. All were absolutely delicious! If I'm around I may come back  but we only ate and drank because of Paint Nite.
Franklin M.,Alhambra  CA,167,1598,2827,6/8/2014,3.0,We had a group of 8 in our party and had wait around 15 minutes to be seated on a Sunday afternoon. I shared a 12 inch deep dish BJs special pizza. The pizza was okay it looked better than it tasted. If you plan on ordering pizza I would get the regular crust and pass on the good looking pan pizza.
Isabel P.,Santa Monica  Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,1/7/2017,1.0,I have been to BJ's many times and have loved my experiences but the last experience I had ruined BJ's for me. I went on a Friday night around 10pm and they weren't very busy  we got sat right away. It took 4-5 minutes for our server to even greet us. Then after we gave our drink orders it took probably 10 minutes to even get them. Mind you we have two servers because one is training. We gave them our food orders and we waited about 40 minutes for our food. They updated us in between letting us know that it was still going to be a bit for our food. When we finally got our food it was barely warm. I had ordered the half rack of the baby back ribs with a side of thin fries and broccoli. My broccoli was freezing cold. My friend asked for no tomatoes on her salad because she is allergic to them and when she got her food there were some on it. When she told them  they apologized and said they would bring her a new one  which yet again took awhile to get it. When she got her new one  the salad wasn't made correctly. It normally comes with avocado but there was none on it. My boyfriend got the jambalaya and when it come out  it looked like something that would be off the kids menu. And for $19 I would expect more. My napkin was dirty with some white stuff on it. So I had to wait once again for another one  while my food was getting even colder than it already was. Our server was Dustin  I don't think he was the right server to be training someone else. With the slow service and the cold food  I would definitely not recommend going there.
Eric K.,Pasadena  CA,165,5,,7/6/2016,3.0,"I went with friends to dinner there. It was a slow and there were like couple of waiters. We got seated and the waiter just handed us water and said ""He will right back"" He didn\'t even ask what he can get us to get started. We had to wait for the waiter to come back to take our order. I ordered the burger  soup  and an appetizer. I got the soup as a side for the burger but got that first. The appetizers and entree took long time. We were about to cancel the order but the appetizers showed up in time. Entree took longer. To make matters worst  I got the burger and it was suppose to have bacon inside. Instead  they gave me the bacon separately on the plate. I mean who does that? Bacon haters? I think they are bacon haters! Like really?! How the fuck can you do that to a bacon burger?!"
Sal G.,Bradbury  CA,115,32,5,4/13/2016,4.0,This place is BEAUTIFUL and their food and drinks are always good. We go here once a month for happy hour. The waiters are great and the food is good. Their bar display is amazing! They have parking in the Paseo Colorado lot  which might be a little expensive  but there's plenty of free parking a block away in front of city hall. The only bummer is that they don't validate for parking.
Bobby H.,La Crescenta  CA,0,8,,1/12/2017,2.0,Gosh  I want to like this place  I really do  but their customer service at times is just piss poor. Case in point. I went in to buy a soda  in an attempt to avoid the rain. After waiting 20 minutes I grew quite weary of waiting  and asked the person behind the order counter if I could just grab a soda from the bartender  she apologized  and then proceeded to take another 3 orders after I had confronted her. I had already paid  but decided I would just go across the street and get drenched rather than wait. The funniest thing is one of the staff members had the audacity to give me an online order form to place my order priori. Like I just ordered a soda. How hard can it be to get????
Sandy K.,North Bend  WA,2,100,127,10/17/2015,5.0,Ok  after driving all day and sitting in traffic for 5 hours. We decided to have dinner here with my good friend. Best choice of the day! The service was way above top notch! The server we had was super nice and made us feel like we were already friends  the manager awesome! We took the booth up for about 4 hours and they were absolutely wonderful! The food   amazing! I had salmon and watermelon salad absolutely best flavor and salad fresh crisp and delicious. . My son had stake and bake potato  stake cooked perfect! Brussel sprouts I normally don't chose them  my friend got me to try and omg!!! You will love them  has splash of sriracha and actually gave it a burst of flavor . Oh you must try the Irish root beer  lol oh yeah you will forget it's alcoholic lol!Overall this place is a 10+   service  atmosphere  food and you will love the restaurant it's self bring a camera!
Ryan M.,Ladera Ranch  CA,45,87,20,10/13/2015,5.0,As you all know  BJ's food is consistently good all across it's locations and this location is no exception  so because you know the food is good already  I will only comment on the location and how it is different than all the others. The food itself doesn't warrant a 5 star review in my opinion  but yes  this BJ's restaurant is different than all the others I've ever seen and I am thus giving it a 5 star rating. The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. Not that the other locations are not nice. But this BJ's is especially absolutely gorgeous. The decor very classy. The ceiling has got to be 20 or 25 feet or more above the floor in the main dining room area and the detail/care in making it is very nice. There are TVs everywhere - ok this may be true of all BJ's. The staff here is very nice. I came on a busy weekend recently  USA vs Mexico soccer game + baseball playoffs + college football games on  and they managed to get the Cal game playing for me at the bar. Everywhere else I went to in Old Town (yes  I went to places in Old Town Pasadena that would not play the Cal game) told me to basically shove it because I wanted to watch the Cal game instead of a soccer game on one of their many TV's. So thank you BJ's. I'm going to do something very rare here that I would not normally do. I rarely give out 5 star reviews. I'm going to give this BJ's 5 stars because it stands out to me as a special restaurant on top of all the other BJ's locations  and I can't find a reason not to.
Matthew D.,Los Angeles  CA,0,8,,7/8/2016,5.0,The service was perfect when I ate there for the first time. Our server Ernesto was very kind and energetic. He kept the lemonade refills coming  and gave me plenty of sauce for the fries. His recommendation of bacon guacamole burger was great  and will be coming back for the same burger.
Leo C.,Los Angeles  CA,1041,629,3439,10/30/2012,4.0,Who doesn't love the going to BJ's Restaurant Brewhouse chain for their deep dish pizza  tasty appetizers  great microbrew beers and famous pizzookie. Finally  an alternative choice to the Yard House hopefully without the long wait. NBA 2012-2013 season starts today so I'm looking forward to coming here to watch the Laker/Clipper games. I attended the grand opening yesterday for lunch. I can't believe there's already a few reviews and check-in about it before the place even opened. I guess after going to a few BJs in SoCal  people think or assume they're all the same. The food and beer maybe  but the decor  ambiance and service is definitely different.The decor is spectacular especially the interior space. This used to be the old Security Pacific Building that was formerly the Premier Jewelery Mall. I love the beautiful high ceilings and ornate design which reminds be more of the Gran Lux cafe. They even kept the original chandeliers and craftsman woodwork. The multi-screen entertainment console at the bar is awesome. Great way to watch multiple games at the same time plus get the latest news report from CNN. In addition  six additional flat screen TVs are available throughout the restaurant. If you want immediate seating for lunch  sit at the bar.Service was pretty awesome today. I think being that it was their grand opening  everyone was at their best behavior. My waiteress Sarah did an exceptional job waiting on me. She was friendly  helpful and polite. My food order came promptly and drink re-filled regularly. Food is always consistently good at BJ's. With their huge menu selections you're sure to find something you like. Make sure to try their lunch specials starting at $5.95 (14 to choose from). I ordered the southern fried chicken breast served on top mash potatoes and corn succotash with pepper cream gravy. Good portions  savory and tasty. The chicken was tender and lightly crisp on the outside. Good deal!Save room for dessert especially their pizzookie. My favorite is their triple chocolate pizzookie made with Ghirardelli chocolate which is rich and amazing. Definitely will satisfy your chocolate fix and indulgence. Also  try their new raspberry white chocolate almond pizzookie topped with vanilla bean ice cream so decadent and scrumptious. Parking - Paseo Mall with validation.With so much good food and beer to offer  I'm sure this place will get popular and busy quickly. Can't wait to come back to try all their delicious food.
Bhushan J.,Alhambra  CA,72,11,37,6/19/2016,4.0,Nice ambience (5/5)Food (3.5/5)Service (4/5)Pizza was goodPasta was not up to expect-ions Ask for Dessert pairingFood can be improve.
L H.,Pasadena  CA,0,2,1,7/6/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Not sure what happened to this place. It used to be good about a year ago. Now  service is slow. Tables and seating are dirty. And AGAIN  with the dirty silverware. I used to come often for lunch but after this last visit  I cannot... I had to request new silverware three times in one visit.
Nicole B.,Santa Monica  CA,711,575,391,5/9/2013,4.0,This BJs is located inside of what used to be a bank. As such  it is gorgeous inside. Very high ceilings in the bar area and lots of glass.Whenever I visit this location I receive great service and the food is what you would expect for any BJs. Yum!
Monica C.,Pasadena  CA,1067,491,535,4/22/2014,3.0,They accommodate large groups better than any other restaurant in Pasadena that I've come across thus far. The service is usually pretty good and I do love the beer!The downfall of this place is the quality of the food. It's hit or miss. I order off the diet menu because I've managed to convince myself that if there's a diet menu  then it's there because the regular menu is Fatty-Mc-Fat-Fat and I don't want to be that too. My personal crazy aside  the diet menu is OK- especially if you like salmon  which I don't. They've got lots of other choices too. I got the fish tacos and let's just say I would never submit myself to that punishment again. Just. gross  mostly flavorless and a few chips are not a side.Also because I order off the diet menu  I have convinced myself that this entitles me to an appetizer: the ahi poke  corn fritters  and the avocado egg rolls are all really good. The Pazookies are pretty fab too. I mean  if you're human and like half cooked cookie dough with ice cream on top. I'm human  so I do. They have little ones for kids which I've  once again  convinced myself I deserve. For the nutrients and stuff.
Maximus G.,South Pasadena  CA,6,80,603,9/1/2015,4.0,Large menu with a good variety of food to choose from. They have a great lunch menu that offers smaller portions of some of their top items  and at a good price. Beer selection is decent. Some personal favorites are their avocado egg rolls  tomato bisque soup and they have good pizza - both their thick pan pizza which is not overly heavy and their thin pizza crisps are good! Fun place to go with a group.
Veronica O.,Los Angeles  CA,0,12,,6/10/2017,1.0,Poor service. Birthday party of 8- each food item was served at totally different times. Salads came out and before we even finished salad  one main entree came out. We told him to eat while warm  and he finished his entire plate before the next 3 items came out. Then another 3 items came out  leaving 1 member with no entree. Finally her steak came out and was burnt black and was entirely brown inside despite being ordered as medium well. The waiter kindly offered to bring her out a new meal. We waited another 10-15 minutes and nothing was brought out. We had all finished eating by this point. The waiter asked if she would like a salad or soup but at this point we asked for it to be wrapped up to go and comp'd. The waiter complied. Although the waiter was respectful  the timing of the food being served was absolutely ridiculous. Hard to enjoy a birthday celebration dinner when people don't get to eat together! Not coming back.
Jessica P.,Castaic  CA,0,4,,6/10/2017,1.0,pizza didn't taste like actual bjs pizza at all. my boy friend was on his second slice and i noticed he had a hair coming from his pizza. disgusting.
Chris R.,Glendora  CA,308,21,4,11/8/2016,5.0,the manager shea makes the experience entirely worthwhile. willing to make the drive to this location due to his service and skills.
Courtney R.,Alhambra  CA,0,4,,1/2/2017,1.0,NO. just no. Have had a few bad experiences here  mainly with food and wait times. There never seems to be anyone around to help or alleviate your complaints. Last time  my pizza came out burnt and had to wait almost 40 min for the new one to come out. Everyone was done eating by the time I got mine. Female manager is not helpful at all. Take the time to go to a different location as there are wayyyy better ones than this one.
Christina L.,Pasadena  CA,170,4,,6/7/2015,2.0,"I come here often because I love their pizookies and their appetizers are pretty yummy! But the last few times we have been here the service has been TERRIBLE! Clueless waitresses who have small sections and can\'t remember what our orders are and what we asked for.Today  it took our server 20 minutes to tend to us  after tending to two other tables that were sat in our section after us. After she asked us for our drink order  she was going to give us even more time to look over the menu. She wasn\'t ready for us to give her our order.Once the drinks came  she brought us the wrong drinks and we got our first refill after dinner was over. One of us never even got a refill on an iced tea. One of us got a burger  didn\'t ask for bacon and bacon was on her burger. She also asked if the burger had a sauce  the waitress was positive there was- there was no sauce. we also had to ask a different server for condiments.This was better compared to our precious visit but not by much! Our previous visit  the same instance happened where our server took more than 15 minutes to tend to us. We ordered fish and chips and the Brewhouse nachos (not on the menu anymore but they still make it). The fish and chips were horribly over breaded and it took three visits from our server to finally bring the malt vinegar we asked when we first ordered.When I asked for the Brewhouse nachos  I asked her what came on it  she said ""I don\'t know because it\'s not on the menu "" I asked her if she could get a list for me and she rolled her eyes at me. Then when I asked if I could give her a list of what I didn\'t want she sighed. I simply just asked for no jalapeos and dealt with picking everything off by hand. Currently we are still waiting for our bill to be processed  I started writing this review once we finished our dessert."
Diane A.,Upland  CA,0,21,,9/22/2015,2.0,First I would like to say they do validate for parking. I read reviews on here saying they don't and one person said they did validate. I did get my parking validated. Maybe it was the weekend? But I just wanted to say that.I'm not sure if it's just BJ's all around but when I go to BJ's I feel their service is not that great. This was my first time at the Pasadena location and the service was not that great. My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday around 11:15am for a paint nite event at 12:30p. We were seated away from other diners  around the corner in the very far back corner. I'm not sure what was the reasoning behind them sitting us there but we happened to get seated right across the paint nite event and watched them set up. Our server seemed unsure of herself. She gave off a vibe like she was confused or awkward. That made me feel awkward around her. I felt when she checked on us  she would watch from a distance and just stare at us. Then when she would finally come on over to check on us  she would linger too long or have a weird facial expression. Anyways  when it came time to pay the bill  she devoted her attention to helping the paint nite people set up. Reminder  we were across the paint nite event I was trying to flag her down so she can take the check. The food was meh. Surprisingly the food tasted better at other BJ's locations. I say this visit was nothing special and I would probably come back here if an event or something was going on or a gathering of friends.
Raphaella F.,Los Angeles  CA,2,39,48,12/7/2015,4.0,Great Space... Wonderful for Watching Games.Service is Good: At the Bar Ask for Brian the Bartender... I literally sent him to the kitchen on a special expedition and he came back with my special request. kudos Brian!Portions Are Small...
Pickles P.,Fullerton  CA,0,16,1,11/17/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Speaking of parking: if you park ay Paseo mall  BJs doesn't validate. However  per server Ashlee B's advice  we stopped into furniture store West Elm a few doors down toward mall. They obligingly stamped our parking ticket. Am sure dept stores or others in mall will do the same.
Les L.,Pasadena  CA,1136,1113,1228,1/16/2014,4.0,"This new BJ\'s is set in a beautiful old bank building on the corner of Colorado and Marengo with ample parking at the Paseo Colorado. It\'s like the best kept secret because unlike other BJs  this one is more under the radar and there aren\'t the massive wait times to get your pizookie. I personally like their ""Enlightened Entrees"" offerings which are all under 575 calories. My husband  in particular  turned me onto the Chicken ala fresca  which is marinated  grilled chicken breast that is served over rice pilaf with zucchini  mushrooms  peppers and tomatoes prepared ratatouille style  light Dijon tarragon jus  with a bit of arugula and balsamic vinaigrette. It is a really flavorful dish and shockingly healthy. I\'ve gone with others and just don\'t like the food on the other side of BJ\'s spectrum  like the ridiculously disgusting chicken bacon ranch pizza  but probably could down more than my share of avocado egg rolls!"
Regina N.,Los Angeles  CA,301,167,99,1/18/2015,1.0,I am extremely disappointed with this place.Boyfriend and I arrived here after a long  long day (and a long drive) and we were starving for some food. I hadn't been to BJ's in awhile  so we decided on them.We came in at about 9:50pm on a Friday night--surprisingly  they were not that busy. We were immediately seated at a nice  comfy booth. Our server came a few minutes later  and took our order. So far  so good.Our house salads came out first. They were alright; nothing fancy or special--nothing I wouldn't be able to make by myself at home. However  given the fact I was starving  I was glad to have any kind of food in my stomach. We waited about five minutes for this to come out--a reasonable amount of time.Then  everything went downhill from there. We waited for our food for FIFTY MINUTES. FIFTY. FRIGGIN. MINUTES. No explanation was offered. Our server was nowhere to be found. No apologies were given until our food finally arrived--and it arrived right on cue  because we were ready to get up and leave.As a sort of lukewarm apology  BJ's offered us free dessert for making us wait the entire time. We ended up not taking the dessert because we don't eat dessert. I felt so bad for our server because our wait wasn't necessarily her fault; what I thought was completely unacceptable was the fact that NOT ONCE did we ever get an apology from the manager. He or she never came out to talk to us to make sure that we were okay. He or she never apologized for making us wait for nearly an hour.Meanwhile  the rest of the staff was standing around  talking to each other  and not tending to their tables. I even saw one girl texting. Omg. Texting? When the table you're in charge of is waiting for your service? -__- Brownie points  though  to the hostess  who saw that boyfriend and I were distressed and tried to find our server.Won't ever go back here. I'd rather go to Cheesecake. DIWOXHWOZIFUQJZLVP frustration.
Aaron B.,Pasadena  CA,0,1,,1/10/2016,1.0,This restaurant treats its black customers poorly! Everyone else who isn't black will receive faster service even if you were seated an hour later! That was my experience today and it really hurt to see the frustration on my family's face while they watched a family of lighter complexion get seated later and enjoy their meal before us! Pasadena bj's is disgustingly ignorant!
Brittany S.,La Crescenta-Montrose  CA,6,42,19,1/8/2015,1.0,Came to have dinner with four people checked in at around 710 it's now 833 and we're still not eating anything! after waiting to place an order for our drinks she finally came to take the order after waiting for another 15 minutes of receiving the drinks we are now waiting for dinner been sitting here for about 47 minutes with no dinner then my lovely sister decided she had some snacks in her purse now that's what were eating I will post a picture so you guys will see horrible horrible horrible service. If you have all the time in the world this is the perfect place for you if not then you guys should just avoid it and go elsewhere.
Sam L.,San Francisco  CA,610,341,773,11/15/2012,4.0,Finally got to check out this place after hearing about its opening a few weeks ago. This is by far the fanciest looking BJ's since it used to be an old school bank back in the day. The interior designers did a fantastic job retaining the character of the original architecture. Oh wait  this is a RESTAURANT....just came for the pizookie and had the white chocolate raspberry almond flavor and it was bomb! The service was prompt and attentive and regularly filled up our waters. The only thing that really sucks is that there's no validated parking.
Mike M.,Los Angeles  CA,49,3,,8/9/2016,1.0,This is the worst BJ's ever not only do they not validate for the parking garage that is located directly below the establishment  they are understaffed and are lacking CS do not let fanciness of this building fool you
Tom M.,Hacienda Heights  CA,42,2,,12/18/2015,1.0,Long time customer of BJ'S in several cities.  Tonight is the first time I have had a complaint  slow service  poor food.
Susan H.,Alhambra  CA,0,58,4,4/27/2016,2.0,Sooooo done. This is a franchise that's seen it's day  but that was then & this is now & there's so many better places to spend my $! Our family & friends have been fans & promoters for many years  but we've experienced a severe decline in efficiency of staff and quality of food. One nice manager was even empathetic enough to present us with a gift card after validating our series of issues. Upon our return  our experience was even worse!!! Don't need it when there's so much better around  especially in Pasadena.
C D.,Carlsbad  CA,1,16,1,5/27/2016,1.0,What a horrible experience I had a BJ's Pasadena on Tuesday. I brought a small group of 8 in for our 6:45 reservation and was greeted by Drake who was helpful and very nice....It was all down hill from there. Our server  was frankly horrible. During our time in the restaurant he failed to get orders correctly  failed to fix the orders when requested  failed to refill drinks...He just failed all around. For example when ordering wings we requested blue cheese and not ranch...he brought extra ranch and no blue cheese...twice! My food  1/2 rack of ribs  were burnt to a crisp. The sprouts...were also burnt and just awful. It was pointless to ask Our server to correct it as he rarely came around.All of this on what was a pretty slow night when we were there. My group is returning to Pasadena next week and we will NOT be returning to BJ's.
Maxine M.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,1,4,,5/13/2016,4.0,The pazookis are amazing and the avocado egg rolls are to die for
Jimmy D.,Los Angeles  CA,1,28,5,12/16/2014,1.0,take out left me on hold for 11 minutes  then came in to pick up order and zero workers at take out counter. FAIL.
Lisa M.,Montebello  CA,1,6,,4/1/2016,2.0,Ill start by saying the beer was the only thing keeping me calm. Server Judy absolutely sucks. Never bothered to wipe down our table or even asked to see if we were doing ok. We sat in the bar area  which was not busy  at all. She had less than 3 tables and was hardly around. Not sure if she had a bad day but we got a different impression when she focused on tables that had business people  which is unprofessional to say the least. Dont treat people like that  even if you are having a bad day.
James A.,Glendora  CA,29,11,8,3/30/2016,1.0,Bad experience today with my family. Our waiter Chad was hands down the worst waiter we have ever had in our restaurant dining experience. We had to wait over an hour just for an appetizer to come out. To top it off  we sat down a total of 1 hr 40 min and never once did he come to check if we needed water  see how are meals were or anything. He didn't bring us our food and didn't see if we wanted dessert which we would have gotten had he come but it got so late that we had to get back to put our baby down to sleep. In general  I normally like BJs a lot so this was very disappointing to experience. The manager was great in understanding and gave us a nice discount off the bill. She would get five stars. And the food was pretty good too but it's a shame that one waiter can ruin the whole experience.
Debbie B.,Pasadena  Los Angeles  CA,27,25,4,1/20/2015,2.0,We have been to this location many times  and I was not happy with the food or service tonight despite the fact that the waiter was nice. Not very busy yet service was slow. My salad needed more dressing but the waiter only came by once. The pizza had weird dark areas on it  and when I asked what it was  I was told they were burnt spots . My son's cheeseburger came with no cheese  so I told a different waitress who brought the food  and she came back with two slices of American cheese on a plate . Not sure how soon I'll want to come back. Disappointed
Minah B.,Los Angeles  CA,86,3,1,1/10/2016,1.0,Incredibly slow. EVERYTIME we come here the service is horrible. Parties  larger parties whom have arrived after us were served before us. The manager was not even accommodating or remorseful about the poor service we received.
Kelly M.,La Puente  CA,1,2,,4/12/2016,1.0,Service here is absolutely horrible. I've been here twice now  after my first visit here I thought I'd give it another try. Thinking maybe it would get better but no. I'm never going back here again. It hurts because I love BJ's but I'd rather drive further out for a more pleasant dinner. I don't recommend this location at all.
Kyle A.,West Fargo  ND,6,55,11,3/25/2016,5.0,Had dinner here our first night while in town for a conference. Easily the best place we chose near the convention center. Sirloin was excellent  and really liked the fries. We also had the Pizzookie for dessert  which was pretty darn tasty.
Allen M.,Los Angeles  CA,267,196,205,12/6/2013,1.0,I'm writing as I wait for the desert (taking forever). The waitress was really nice and apologized multiple times for their shortcomings. We waited more than 45min for the food to come out only to find one of the orders was wrong... The burger as well as the roast beef sandwich were extremely salty and did not taste well at all. We called the manager and complained... He took the burger off the menu and said would send out the desert on the house... Waited another 20min for the desert but decided to leave since it never came. Parking is also not validated so expect to pay. I'm sure this location will close in the near future and I won't be surprised.
Cynthie M.,La Crescenta  CA,17,11,,7/5/2015,2.0,Worst experience I've had in a restaurant in a long time. . I rarely complain about anything. Poor choice in seating us  20 min before drink order came  40 min before dinner came  forgot our side salad which therefore came after dinner. No excuse as restaurant was 3/4 empty but hostess chose to seat us by large group who proceeded to stand up in aisle next to our table and socialize  even blocking the waiters. We did complain  although manager never checked on us  the waiter comped our side salad and provided a free dessert.. which ended up voiding the coupon we brought based on min $30 food order lol. Recommended to husband because I've had good experience at 3 other BJs locations out of town.. we will never go back.
Katherine Q.,Los Angeles  CA,273,17,97,11/15/2015,1.0,First time at BJ's and have to say worst experience ever! Sat down didn't get service for 15mins then when they finally came to ask for my drink they took 10mins. Not once did they ask if I was ready to order. When they finally came by they took forever! I even canceled my order and they still took forever Just to give me my bill.
Gerard I.,Pasadena  CA,500,806,351,9/9/2013,5.0,Okay  so Sun-Thu  they have a late night happy hour that goes from 10pm until closing. BJ's brews go for $3.50 (depending on your bartender) - $4 and mixed drinks (Vodka tonics and stuff like that) also for $4. Appetizers start at $5. I've partaken of some pints in the past couple of days. I could make it a weekly thing now that I know what I know.
Gail N.,Bishop  CA,0,33,25,1/17/2015,1.0,"After waiting for our burgers for 40 minutes after ordering (not to mention our appetizers that were not delivered til way after our burgers) we had to send the one that was ordered ""well done"" back because I believe I actually heard it moo!!! Then waited for another 30 minutes for the burger to return to the table. The waiter was super nice and apologetic but we asked to talk to the manager... She finally came and all she could say was sorry that she has a ""tiny"" problem in the kitchen.  Noticing that there were other tables having same problem.... She did comp 3 of the burgers  the appetizers and 1ice tea.  Nice of her but we will never be back....."
Brennan S.,Los Angeles  CA,166,65,46,3/31/2015,5.0,Stopped by for a quick drink and food from happy hour. Had a great experience. The food was excellent  we had the happy hour chicken lettuce wraps as well as the happy hour chicken pot stickers I highly recommend both of these options! We paired it with a couple hefeweizens and I also ended up getting a glass of Pinot which was delicious as well. The staff was super friendly the atmosphere was perfect. I'm not going to lie this location is one of the more beautiful locations architecturally. If you are in the Pasadena area and looking for some great food and service then I would definitely recommend coming here! Food- 5 StarsService- 5 StarsDrinks- 5 StarsAtmosphere- 5 Stars Also a quick recommendation. If you can try to find street parking because the parking lot unfortunately doesn't validate parking but it's worth the short walk in the beautiful city of Pasadena.
Melanie D.,Los Angeles  CA,305,934,1517,2/7/2014,3.0,This is a newer BJ's - it's a casual place for food and drinks. Nothing really special food wise but portions are large and filling. They make a handful of brews  light and dark. For those who prefer cider and things on the sweeter side  their berry cider is delicious! Happy hour is ok . Overall  prices are reasonable. Even tho the space is beautiful  it somehow feels like a touristy place and I prefer the Glendale location .parking - metered or free residential street parking
Jerry M.,Tustin  CA,3408,776,589,3/5/2015,4.0,Came back to BJ's a second time at the invitation of the manager. Started with the ahi poke  a garden salad and an excellent cherry chipoltle salmon. My wife had a vegi pizza and finished with the ubiquitous pazuki. All in all a very good meal. The service was also quite good. I love the decor of this BJ's and i have a soft spot for their red ale. Recommend.
Dee V.,Inglewood  CA,127,24,20,4/22/2016,5.0,I had some of the Best Jambalaya I've tasted! The Calamari was tasty too! Good service and Good food! A bit pricey  but delicious! I also had a pizookie for desert too! Wide variety of choices on the menu.
Jessica S.,Los Angeles  CA,29,31,50,9/8/2013,5.0,Pretty good looking BJs if u ask me ... Came here yesterday after the boiling crab ... Talk about fat!!! We wanted something sweet so why not come here ... Came here with my family ( 4 of us) order the family size pizookie and holy moly it was HUGE and super good ... Mission accomplished we ate it all. Thank you BJs and thank you Francisco for the great service!!!
Paul M.,Pasadena  CA,1580,474,27,8/30/2014,4.0,"You think you know BJ\'s?makeameme.org/media/creaDid you know the CEO of BJ\'s lives in Pasadena?i2.cdnds.net/13/15/300x2So what?SO WHAT  YOU DARE ASK?!So it means that the owner decided to make this the most gorgeous BJ\'s ever.  The fucking crown jewel of BJ\'s. A BJs that would be so gorgeous that if actually offered a BJ  you\'d just say ""No  I\'m good  thanks."" A false ceiling uncovered during renovation that had the ORIGINAL 1900\'s Trompe-l\'il friezes and cartouches on the ceiling from when it was the Pacific Southwest Trust and Savings. The gorgeous chandeliers?  Replicas of those that once hung majestically in the bank. That double eagle coat of arms over the doorway? Yes  serf  that belonged to House Romanov. What does that have to do with a bank?I have no idea  but it\'s pretty neat nonetheless.The house beers are actually pretty good for a chain brewery. The IPA was a bit too floral and had an almost soapy aftertaste  but the Irish Red was super good. There are plenty of non-BJ beers on tap as well  and a full bar  of course.But really  if this place were downtown and not called BJ\'s Restaurant & Brewhouse  the hipsters would be packed ten layers deep because of the beautiful interior design. Then again  maybe it could remain a BJ\'s and it can be a new ironic hipster hangout!theonion.com/video/new-a"
Q. M.,Chicago  IL,11,96,107,3/5/2015,4.0,Came here to meet friends for dinner. I arrived at 6:30PM-ish on a thur night. We opted to sit at one of the bar tables so we sat ourselves at a booth.I had a Stella and my friends had some kind of amber ale...we both enjoyed our drafts.I ordered a small vegetarian pizza while my friends both had salads....one of which was the enlightened category and the other was more of a main dish.My friend who had an enlightened salad asked for his dressing on the side but he never received it and when it was brought to the waitresses attention  he had already consumed more than half (about 15 min)  so she asked if he still wanted it. He said no and just finished it without dressing. No other problems...we talked a lot since we hadn't seen each other in months and had a lot to catch up on. They DO NOT validate parking...just an fyi. I didn't park in the garage (i lucked out with street) but my friends did and were surprised to see they don't validate.I've been here twice before this...both for just pick up and BOTH times were a hassle. One time I had to wait an extra 45 minutes after my designated pick up time! I didn't have yelp back then but now I do...just be aware that evening pick ups can be screwed up (the other time  I was missing an item). I love the mini deep dish pizza so I will be back but it's down to 1x every 6 months now.
Irene B.,Pasadena  CA,21,92,217,9/13/2014,1.0,"Horrible horrible horrible service! Got the lunch special and a root beer.Salad came out first. After waiting around I had to ask 2 different waiters to get my waitress because I was thirsty with nothing to drink. When she finally came with my food it was cold! It had been 1hour already she was awful! I\'ve never experienced such horrible customer service! Left the restaurant hungry and thirsty! Manager said ""next time I come in he\'ll take care of me"" why the fuck would I go back in there and waste my time! Never going there again!!!! Worst Bj restaurant!"
c m.,Bell  CA,4,16,5,10/3/2015,1.0,Service is horrible!! Worst part is that I'm not the first to complain on yelp about their service!! Hello management!! Train your people!! Needless to say that we will not be coming back to this Bj's restaurant!
Alexandria M.,El Monte  CA,65,25,35,2/22/2015,5.0,"Came here for a little Sunday Funday and the service was amazing! Had the Harvest Hefeweizen and their black and blue-house burger. Everything tasted really good. Our server Carla made the experience more wild! ""In a good way"" ;)"
Sevan K.,Glendale  CA,11,6,14,9/18/2015,1.0,4 star for Good food  0 star for really bad service. No fork and knife on the table  waitress/waitresses they dont care about costomers. Glendale location is the best comper to here.
Demetrius L.,Montclair  CA,21,22,6,9/19/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Just an update: I tried contacting the customer service manager who left a comment on my post and I was never contacted back. Nothing more than BJS trying to pull the wool over your eyes. It was really bad service and this location is apparently known for it. Don't go here. Don't waste your time or money
David G.,Los Angeles  CA,355,6,3,3/16/2015,2.0,Jessica the bartender in the bar area is rude and hates her job (she's pretty obvious about it too). Gave snappy attitude and was bothered when I asked questions. I think any other bartender or server would be more suffice. What's shame  used to be my favorite hangout spot after work.
Lauren W.,Sunland-Tujunga  CA,17,91,22,2/5/2015,4.0,I haven't been to this BJs for lunch or dinner but walked in wanting pizza for breakfast only to find out that they serve actual breakfast! We were really happy with our breakfast pizza  delicious and perfect to split. The side of fruit seemed like a waste of money but that's to be expected at a place that isn't meant to be healthy. Service was attentive. Decor was beautiful! I'm willing to go back and check out their regular service
Caroline T.,Pasadena  CA,144,42,8,9/12/2014,2.0,Service is pretty bunk here...waiter brought my salad with no plates or utensils  waited about 10 min to get someone to bring me one place setting (there's 5 of us)  our pizza and appetizer comes  still no plates or utensils  finally another waiter  Brian comes and brings us everything we need. Probably our last time at this location....oh and the ranch tastes like bottled ranch...not like the good ranch at the brea and Monrovia location...
Danielle R.,Pasadena  CA,244,2,,7/31/2016,1.0,Absolutely no customer serviceLast night my 10 year old son finally got me out of the house after a long work week to take him to his favorite restaurant BJ'S. However  we were so disappointed once we got there  that there was no host to greet us for a while. Then finally when we were seated we waited 20 mins at the table before realizing no one was coming to help us. We looked around for help but one came to our table to greet us  to get us drinks  or tell us they'd be helping us soon. It probably wouldn't have been so bad if we weren't sitting directly behind the servers station and three servers were back and forth the entire time  standing talking  and assisting all the tables around us. Once my son told me that this was the worse experience he's ever had at BJ'S  I asked him if he wanted to leave. So we left to Blaze Pizza without ever being helped. You lost a loyal customer due to poor service as I doubt he'll ever want to go back!
Rafael H.,Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,3/4/2017,2.0,It was my first time dining at a BJ's restaurant. The place looks really nice inside with chandeliers and there's a gigantic tv at the bar. Upon arrival we were told it was a 5 minute wait which isn't so bad considering it was a Friday night. We were seated rather quickly and ordered our drinks and appetizer. One of the drinks they forgot about and was brought water instead until I brought it to the waiters attention. After that the appetizer took a good 30-40 minutes to come out and we still had to wait another 10 before the waiter took our actual order. Then our waiter eventually went MIA on us and we had 2 or 3 different ones attend us for the remainder of the night. To top it off me and my girlfriend both got really bad stomachaches about halfway through our meal. Don't know if they were understaffed on chefs that day or if this place is just unorganized but I won't be coming back for a good while.
Sarah H.,Downtown  Los Angeles  CA,17,47,39,9/8/2014,4.0,I guess I have been really lucky all 4 or 5 times I've been here. This is an old bank building and it's absolutely stunning inside. It's nice to have a casual restaurant in such an upscale building. I have need waited for a seat and have been here for to watch various sports numerous times. I've only been in the actual dining area once  I usually sit in the bar area to see all the glorious TVs. I've had a couple different food items and they've all been very good. I'm a big fan of the soup and salad lunch deal they offer  and I often get the tortilla soup and cypress salad. They are unlimited and only $7 until 3pm. Can't beat it! My mom and I shared the enLIGHTened turkey ham and bacon sandwich the other day and it was amazing for being on the healthy menu. It did take a little while to come out  but we weren't rushing anyway. They don't validate parking  but it's very easy to walk over to paseo and get your validation. I've always had friendly servers here who are good about checking on us and bringing us anything we need. I'm not sure about other visitors  but I haven't had a problem. And I don't have low standards either.
Rob A.,Granada Hills  CA,5,15,,2/11/2016,1.0,Terrible  terrible food. Steak was tough as can be  appetizer platter was a joke  artichoke dip came out with literally 8 pieces of chips  my wifes Ahi Tuna stunk. I asked for water with lemon and of course I only got water  it took 15 minutes to get her to come back with lemon. Shaun the manager was very sincere with his disappointed. I have never experienced such a disaster with all portions. To top it off  the bathroom stall had no toilet paper or seat cover.. As I said  Shaun the manager seemed equally upset.
Jennifer B.,Moorpark  CA,3,5,,8/23/2015,1.0,Poor service... Took 30 mins to get our drinks  50 mins to get our food. Waiter forgot an entree... Manager didn't check on us... Terrible dining experience!!!
Ermilo A.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,4,7/27/2014,1.0,Really!! The worse BJs I have ever been.They don't even offer parking for their guests  when I asked for validation for my parking ticket the front desk attendance guys said they are not part of the mall parking program.Bad service and not the same service from BJs
Inna C.,Los Angeles  CA,149,33,20,7/31/2014,2.0,"Sad to say that this is the worst BJ\'s we have ever been to. The only reason why it\'s getting two stars is because the architecture is beautiful inside. But when it comes to the food...oh man. The foodie part of my heart breaks. After being distracted by the cool-looking ceiling  my husband and I decide to order the calamari for an appetizer. For the main course  he orders the black and blue burger and I order the Cajun shrimp pasta. The calamari came pretty quick  but once you take a bite you realize why: they probably grabbed the last batch that was at the bottom of the frozen bag of calamari and then they popped it in the microwave. That is pretty much how it tasted. I was starving so I didn\'t really care  but my husband was disappointed that there wasn\'t really a crunch to those little critters. Our server offered to take it back  but I refused because I thought it was ok enough to eat...and maybe part of me didn\'t want spit in my next entre. The burger and the pasta came. First look at my pasta and I thought  ""wow. They doused a lot of the sauce on it."" I took a bite and the pasta reminded me of those times when I would be boiling pasta myself and I would taste-test it to see if it was ready but it wasn\'t so I would let it boil for a little longer. Well...the cook didn\'t seem to let it boil for a little longer and ended up serving me with undercooked pasta. The bread was good so I munched on that. The shrimp was ok  too. When my husband saw how little I ate  he tasted some of my pasta to see how undercooked it was and he agreed. He told our server and our server went to ask her manager if she could have it taken off our tab. We were glad they did because that would be very upsetting if we paid for undercooked pasta that I took two bites out of. So...to finish up this very sad tale of our dinner at BJ\'s: we will not come back to this one again. Too bad...so sad."
Amador V.,Perth  Australia,2,7,16,10/10/2015,1.0,I get an email to come and watch the soccer match between USA and Mexico ... I get here and they tell me I cannot get sound... What kind of offer is that? No sound because the manager made that choice?i ordered 3 appetizers for my our party ... They are cold! Poor service on a Saturday night and for a new location is not fun!
Victoria V.,Seaside  CA,18,116,47,7/13/2015,1.0,I love the gluten free pizzooki and I came in just for that. My server was so rude and normally I'd think he was having a bad night but he was very nice to the other tables. I was very disappointed in him and his service. I left a note to tell him how disappointed I was.
Patty And Sergio R.,Los Angeles  CA,7,353,4,5/31/2015,5.0,This evening may 31st. we had a party of ten  for a Sunday it was not busy  we were greeted & seated our waiter  (young man curly hair maybe Latin) I didn't get his name but he was wonderful to our party we took down our orders and made sure to check up on our table quite often which is great because there's always someone who needs something. The place was very quiet which was awesome! We were sat towards the back by the exits and that's great because we had a little privacy. Thank you for the good service  we will priorities this location
Laura S.,Pasadena  CA,922,1504,6131,11/20/2012,4.0,FOOD:Went there for lunch and got the soup bowl and OMG... it's tiny. And it's $6. Whaaa... it was SO tiny. I finished it in three bites. I was really disappointed in the quantity for the price.I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and it was good but SO little. If I were there longer  I'd pay $2 more for the unlimited soup... but still... not worth $6 for such a small bowl.SERVICE:I went with a regular of theirs. So they were great to us. Excellent service.AMBIANCE:Nice  fresh new store. It's HUGE and clean. PARKING:Street or public lots or PaseoOVERALL:Great for big groupsGoing to try the Happy Hour soonOverall... don't get the soup/
Kate T.,Walnut  CA,4,100,1,12/14/2014,2.0,Food was not bad.Price was ok.Service was depend on the waitstaffs.I guess I went in the wrong day and time.The waiter disappeared about 30 minutes then food was taking forever and nobody came and said anything.I don't really give two stars but I was disappointed.
Andrew C.,Los Angeles  CA,118,156,,9/12/2014,2.0,I live pretty much right between this BJ's and the BJ's in Arcadia. After a pretty good experience in Arcadia (their 3 1/2 star average is about right)  my girlfriend and I tried this one last night.Unfortunately  I have to echo what several other reviews have said: While the building is beautiful  the service isn't great  and the food is mediocre. The server mixed up my girlfriend's drink  and had to ask for confirmation a minute or two after trying to memorize my order. As for the food  I ordered pizza after being pleasantly surprised in Arcadia. This pie  though (a small deep dish pepperoni pizza)  was seriously lacking in sauce. It tasted very bland  and I wound up pretty disappointed.If you're craving BJ's  trust me  go to Arcadia  not this one. It looks great  but the negative reviews are accurate.
Athena J.,San Gabriel  CA,30,11,3,2/8/2015,4.0,Enjoy the atmosphere of this place. Next to lots of entertainment and shops. Happy hour is great! They also have gluten free beer! Score! Friends and I go to brunch there on Sunday's. Only thing is that they mess your order up often  specially for brunch. But they are very nice and accommodating for substitutions. ***Wish they had a bigger variety for people with allergies such as gluten and soy though.
Analaura G.,Altadena  CA,4,12,11,3/10/2015,4.0,First time in this BJ's location. I personally enjoyed my bartenders Alicia and David. I came in and Alicia introduced herself right away and was able to give me some recommendations . David made me a delicious strawberry mojito. He is a very outgoing gentlemen which I hope to soon see again due to the great energy he carries in his personality.
Candice A.,Los Angeles  CA,26,43,,6/4/2016,1.0,Ate here for lunch and I had the shrimp tacos and a side of fries. That was all pretty decent. However when the bill came I started feeling a little tummy sick. That only got worse. Within 30 min I was rushing to the bathroom. I truly believe one of the staff put exlax in my food. I'm still in pain. Will not be coming back!
Jwan G.,Hawthorne  CA,3,3,,1/17/2016,1.0,Worst bj's I have ever been to  the waiter dropped a water cup on one of my guest. I thought things would get better after the manager spoke to use and asked us what desert we wanted and what was my guest eating. It went down hill from there . They did not give us forks or napkins to eat our food. We barley received water and refills on our drinks. To top it off my guest ended up paying for his food and desert after they left him wet and embarrassed making him look like his peed his pants because of the clumsy waiter . Maybe because we were all Hispanic and looked a little Ruff because we had just played a soccer match down the street at Pasadena adult soccer league!!!Worst customer service ever !!!!! Save your money and go to Yard house!!
Matt V.,Temecula  CA,20,500,32,9/11/2013,5.0,"I\'m rounding up my 4 star review because 1) I had a meal I would never have expected at a BJ\'s and 2) because the vibe was just right.I usually go for deep dish pizza love and beer but since I have to ""take \'er easy"" on the restaurant choices I got the Moroccan spiced Salmon! WOW !! Sooo good! Already love Salmon but this was above and beyond what I would expect to eat at a brew pub pizza sports joint. Also  our waitress was great. The wife ate the porkchops and she was diggin\' it and offered me a forkful to sample. Again  a nice surprise. You know something is really good when my wife refused to take the second pork chop home and HAD TO EAT IT at the restaurant. (This is a woman who ALWAYS takes half her dinner home in a box!)"
Natalie E.,Glendale  CA,119,149,508,9/3/2013,3.0,I am generally not a huge fan of this place however it is very close to my work...lunch time we usually end up here because co workers wants to go. I usually opt out for the healthier restaurants  therefore i was happy when they had a salad on their menu i LOVED....it was a delicious and light spinach and berry salad that was discontinued as of September 1st...BRING THIS BACK!
Kelly R.,Pasadena  CA,0,72,4,3/26/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Service has improved. Kitchen continues to turn out consistently good plates.Glad they are in our neighborhood.
Praline R.,Monrovia  CA,3,26,1,6/9/2015,1.0,The worst. Took over 30 minutes to be seated on a night that was dead another 30-40 for our food & rack on another 15 for them to bring us silverware? Never going here again.
Christina G.,Los Angeles  CA,0,9,,7/7/2016,5.0,Delicious food and great service. Our waitress Shana was very helpful; especially in regards to my severe allergy!
Beau F.,Austin  TX,0,42,5,9/7/2015,5.0,This was going to a 1 start review but the waitress was a perfect professional in resolving issues. Thanks Ariana B!
Henry V.,Rosemead  CA,47,28,,12/14/2016,4.0,Came here for lunch a while ago with a coworker because they had a BOGO deal. Walked in and wasn't greeted immediately  but when we were greeted  we were immediately seated which was cool. Hostess was friendly and made small talk with us. Got seated in a booth and looked at the menu. I decided to go with the Deep Dish Baked Ziti while my coworker ordered the Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs. We received our order fairly quickly. When the Deep Dish Baked Ziti was brought out  it looked small  didn't look like something I would pay full price for  but that's just me. Once I tried some of the Ziti  it made my disappointed face turn into a big smiley face. Probably one of the best pasta dishes at BJ's hands down. Flavors were on point  didn't taste too cheesy and the sausages really complemented the pasta well. The Jumbo Spaghetti and Meatballs was nothing special. The bread that this dishes came with was really impossible to split in half by cutting  but when you took a bite into it with some of the pasta  it tasted good. Service was good. Checked out their large flat screen TV which was pretty cool. Overall  would recommend coming here and getting the Deep Dish Baked Ziti if you got the BOGO coupon. I usually come to BJ's for their burgers  but I heard their lunch specials are pretty good too. I think next time they have their BOGO  I'm going all in with the Full Rack Ribs.
Meet T.,Los Angeles  CA,75,22,12,12/31/2015,5.0,They made veg burger for me which is delicious and the amazing desert which is masterpiece
Breyandramarie R.,Rosemead  CA,10,13,14,11/21/2015,5.0,Always go here with friends and family  i also have a few friends that work at the restaurant. Great experience every time i go. I also come alone sometimes to just sit relax  and to enjoy a beer while watching whatever games are on.
Lexie C.,Pasadena  CA,61,72,66,6/18/2015,5.0,we had Wendy z. has our server and she was as nice as can be! we really enjoyed her service  along with her nice smile! our chicken tortilla soup came out cold and she made sure the soup was hot the next time around. I had a salmon ceaser for entree and it was so yummy! I had a $10 off $35 promotion and it was well worth it! I will be back!
Kassandra C.,Los Angeles  CA,0,3,,8/13/2015,2.0,"Worst service I ever had. The restaurant wasn\'t even busy. I went in with 3 of my friends and we had to wait 25 minutes for our drink order to be taken and then another 30 minutes to get our order taken down. We kept flagging down our waitress and she would always say ""I\'ll be with you in a minute."" Once our order was taken  it took 50 minutes for our food to be brought. If it wasn\'t because my friend was dead set on trying it I would\'ve just crossed the street to subway and grabbed a sandwich."
Vicky T.,Santa Cruz  CA,447,2650,969,12/8/2012,4.0,recently opened and one of the better BJ's experiences. This building used to be a bank and it is gorgeous. The serving staff was very accommodating to large groups that came in while we were there  ensuring they were happy with their seating (ended up moving because of the sun). The food was decent enough. Lots of screens to watch sports games and plenty of parking. Ended up getting the marsala dish and other various lunch combos within the group. We weren't pressured to hurry up  eat and leave which was a nice change from other BJs.
Ron L.,Covina  CA,4995,1336,4973,3/27/2014,4.0,This place is cool. We just left the theater after seeing a movie and the whole group of us were anxious to see this place. For some reason the BJ's (ex-Bank) wasn't really packed which was great. Love the interior design of this place and so stylish for a BJ's and they have a lot of screens to watch your favorite sports. Gosh  four large screens over the bar area alone..all on different channels.  We had a excellent waitress that kept the drinks rolling and appetizers. I wasn't really hungry because I ate a lot of popcorn at the theater  but my friend's mahi mahi was delicious. Yes  I did nibble on her fish...   Really  I felt the only downside to the evening is that they don't validate...but this is a place worth coming back to.Drinks: Odules.... cause I don't drink...
Shelly A.,Pasadena  CA,15,40,340,3/23/2016,1.0,This is the worse Bj's I've ever been too!!! The customer service was horrible and careless. I took my girlfriend and my girlfriends mom here to have a nice dinner but it ended up being a nightmare! Our waiter just kept ignoring us like we weren't even there  his name was Nicholas. Very unprofessional  rude and mindless. He took forever to come to our table to take our order  give us a to go box and give out our check. One of the kitchen staff brought us our order because our waiter took forever!! By the way we waited almost an hour for our food and 40 minutes for the pazooki! Wish I can give the customer service 0 stars. I'd like to add that the food didn't taste like all the other Bj's I ate at in NorCal and SoCal. I ordered the Parmesan Chicken  Jambalaya  Salmon and a pazooki . Parmesan was burnt in the bottom  the Jambalaya was over seasoned and oily  the salmon was super dry and the pazooki was undercooked AS IN THE cookie wasn't cooked very liquidy. WORST SERVICE EVER! Never coming back to this Bj's location.
Ross V.,Los Angeles  CA,38,118,63,9/18/2013,4.0,Enjoyed lunch here.The inside of this BJs is really cool. Open ceilings with no walls. It was a former bank of course.My meal was excellent. Clocking in at almost 1 700 calories.... I had the pulled pork BBQ sandwich with thin fries and coleslaw.My mom had the mahi mahi.It was around 30 bucks for the two of us.Minus one star for the parking!!! Actually this is not Bj's fault ... but they DON'T offer validation for the garage underground. After your meal you have to walk back INTO paseo mall and get it validated at the top of the escalators!!!A pain with a 1 700 calorie baby in my tummy lolEnjoy
Noodle F.,Pasadena  CA,0,21,23,6/28/2016,1.0,We come here regularly even though bjs Arcadia location is near from where we come from. However after the experience we had tonight  we will never come to Pasadena bjs anymore or until they replace a competent manager and staff.Came after little before 10pm thus not many customers at the time. We get sit right away and waiter CHARD V gets our drink orders as usual. Took 20 min for our drinks to come and waiter Chard didn't even get our food order and disappeared. Waited about another 20 min and we had to call another waiter in order to get our waiter. Got our food order and food comes late after another 20min. Didn't get all our food and our kids meals get to be last. Forget about the food being late but let's think about customer service... This waiter Chard didn't even once apologize us for being late and never bother to check our food status and even tried to defend himself saying food didn't take that long... Manager comes dressed as casual with no uniform and just give a simple apology to our party... If BJs marketing staff is reading this please take care of your employees if you want have customers coming to your place  very pathetic and disrespectful to your customers!! Next time we will rather go to Yard house for the happy hour starting from 10pm to close.
Jessica C.,Los Angeles  CA,439,204,22,1/5/2013,4.0,"I think the whole BJ\'s brand is always great. Once again  friendly staff  fun ambience  plenty to watch (on tv and people watching)  love that they list their calories on the menu. It was 8pm on a Saturday and there was only a 10-15 minute wait for a table which wasn\'t bad  but to our surprise instead of waiting  we found a table in the bar area. I\'m not giving 5 stars for two reasons that are kind of beyond their control: 1. The parking sucks (we found ourselves taking an elevator up into an abandoned alley behind the restaurant which is a little scary for women at night) and 2. it\'s a little cold in there esp with the door flying open every two seconds so sometimes the bar area isn\'t always a plus.I had the ""Enlightened"" mediterranean pasta and my friend had the mini pepperoni pizza  both delicious! Can never get disappointed with this franchise!"
Derek W.,Los Angeles  CA,466,631,2464,12/1/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,3.5 stars ...Friend wanted to watch the UCLA/Stanford game here last night and was a bit reluctant to go. Arrived slightly before kickoff and was in an empty section off to the side. Was nice of them to allow me to pick the booth of my choice which was directly in front of a tv. It wasn't long before the section filled up...Started off with a beer and waited for the rest to arrive. Quickly finished the first pint and ordered a second as my friend was arriving.Ordered a few appetizers to start...stuffed mushrooms which were good and came out hot. Avocado rolls...tasty and again were hot. Buffalo wings were brought out dry and served with both ranch and the buffalo sauces on the side...a little weird but ok. We quickly mowed through those and then ordered the nachos. Though the cheese looked like it was melted  we found that the chili on the bottom to be cold. Even the sour cream was so cold that it was icy! The manager quickly rectified the issue and brought out another order which was awesome!Since UCLA lost that night  decided to drown my sorrows in a berry crumble. I've had this at the Montebello location and thought that it was pretty good however  the crumble topping was actually salty and not sweet. I normally would've complained but felt that since I had already complained about the nachos that I didn't want to risk them spitting in my food. That was the only complaint that I had ... guess the chef was a little heavy on the dash of salt to enhance the taste of the berries. Still new and definitely have improved since my last visit....hope they continue to improve as time goes by.
Brittany A.,San Gabriel  CA,104,21,12,10/18/2015,5.0,My friend had her birthday dinner here last night and we were a party of 15. While there was a miscommunication with the reservations they were able to quickly accommodate us to a table. The restaurant assigned us one server and of course with such a huge party there were mishaps. What made it such a great experience was our server ryan. Always had a smile on his face and tried his absolute best to stay on top of things. Thank you ryan  I know it can't be easy but we really appreciated you!
Tish N.,Los Angeles  CA,424,286,23,12/15/2012,4.0,I traditionally don't review chains but I had a good experience here. After an unfortunately snafu at a nearby bar  we decided to stick with something familiar.We were told we could seat ourselves for happy hour. Brandon came soon after and took our orders. He was amazing. He made our dining experience a good one. He was attentive and polite. We got the sliders and wedges. I had the bomb.com pomegrante sunrise and le bew got a beer. The food was fresh and hot.
Ash M.,Los Angeles  CA,1,45,,11/12/2015,1.0,DO NOT BRING YOUR GROUP HERE.We made a reservation over a *week* in advance for a group of 20  and the restaurant knew we were planning to attend an 8 PM event down the block.We saw our waiter 3 times - to order a drink  to order food  to pay the bill. If you wanted a second drink  a condiment  etc.  no one could be found.The things we did manage to order came out in chunks at drastically different times. Drinks took over 15 minutes  with the exception of a margarita that took 25. Half of our group finished eating before the other half even received their food. One diner never received his order at all and had to cobble together a meal from his friends' plates.Management was alerted to all these problems but did nothing to solve them or make up for how awkward and unsatisfying our meal was.I have eaten here before with groups of three or four people; those experiences have been average. Based on how ineptly this event was handled  we won't be going back to BJ's.Also: BJ's  you are located in Paseo Colorado. Stop being so stingy and validate the bloody parking.
Cheryl R.,Los Angeles  CA,166,223,52,10/29/2012,4.0,Just left the restaurant...came here on opening night! Place was still buzzing at 7:30. They have a bunch of flat screen tv's and were showing the MNF game so that was cool. The staff greeted us right when we stepped in...like 4 of them. All evening we were well taken care of. There were a lot of trainees walking around with servers- ours was no exception. It was actually quite adorable watching the trainee taking copious notes about our order :-) Our server was great and very attentive.The ambiance awesome  as they converted an old bank into the restaurant  but kept a lot of the architecture. Love the ceiling and the chandeliers! Of course since it was opening night  everything (tables  booths  chairs  walls  etc) were new and shiny and nice. They'll get worn over time  but it was fun seeing everything so pristine and new!My husband and I ordered gluten free pizza  regular pizza  and a gluten free pizookie...and they all were delish!On our way out  we were thanked by 7 different people on our walk out...that was cool! We'll be back for sure...maybe to watch another sports game or something or try their happy hour!***TIP: On a busy night  you should call about 30min-1hr ahead of the time you plan on getting there to get your name added to the 'call ahead list'. This will shorten your wait time!***Not sure who Charity talked to  but when I called  I was told that they did NOT validate parking since they're not part of the Paseo. I was told to go to Gelsen's to validate. So not really sure about parking at the moment.
Kevin J.,Mira Loma  CA,27,262,1051,5/21/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Came back again and the service wasn't as great but still was good. But the food was still amazing. I can't get over how good the happy hour is it ends at 7. Most items are 4 or 5 or 6 bucks. Again the Flatbread California pizza is DELICIOUS $! THIS time we got the pazookie. Ahhhhh so darn goooddddd! !! Please get get it if you never tried it it's amazing. I love the happy hour here.one of the best happy hours in old town.
Johnny F.,Alhambra  CA,2,8,1,3/12/2016,1.0,We got here at 12:40pm party of 4  it took them 1 hour to get our food. Horrible Horrible. Will never come back to BJs in Pasadena.
Diana G.,Alhambra  CA,26,1,1,12/31/2015,1.0,Party of 15 on a Tuesday afternoon about 3:30pmService was really bad  waiter forgot appetizer  forgot side dish to child's plate  burnt brussels sprouts  entire order took way too long to arrive. 3 people in our party got up and left because of their plates took way to long.We walked out of the restaurant at 5:40pm that will tell you how long we waited.Management lacks professionalism Better service at Yard House
Nick T.,Glendale  CA,137,308,115,1/17/2013,4.0,Upon entering  you are greeted by an open area with 40 foot ceilings and a architectural masterpiece of what old Pasadena stands for. It sort of reminds me of a 100 year old train station which is really awesome seeing that I love old world architecture. As far as their food  I ordered take-out and the pickup was smooth as they had an area dedicated for takeout orders. As with any BJ  the food is not extraordinary but serves its purpose. As far as their prices  they are reasonable I would say  whereas  dinner for two will run you around $30. To my fellow yelpers  make sure you go and see their architecture because it is truly riveting.
Dave G.,Covina  CA,29,10,,5/26/2015,2.0,Horrible service  just had a late lunch (1pm)  the serving staff was horrendous  slow and forgetful  asked for parmesan cheese  never got it from the waitress  I had to go near the bar area to ask another server for it.
Will W.,Los Angeles  CA,327,433,3,4/29/2014,3.0,"Beautiful location  this is no doubt the best looking Bj\'s brewhouse out there. The food is decent  and they\'re famous for their pizookie dessert  which is actually pretty tasty. This place would be great to watch sports they have a monster TV screen in back of the bar. Unfortunately  I do not like the beers at Bj\'s. They all have a watery finish at the end  which is mucho disappointing for a ""brewhouse"". Doesn\'t matter if it\'s a pale ale  a stout  or an IPA  it\'s gonna have a watery finish. Come for the ambiance or come for the food  but not for their beer."
Cullum D.,City of Industry  CA,155,5,,5/23/2015,1.0,This place blows. The salad sucked. The soup was cold. The pasta had zero flavor. And on top of that I asked for no chicken on my pasta which  at a different BJ's  was priced a few dollars cheaper and here it was still 14.95$ there's your tip
Jorge A.,Pasadena  CA,67,44,61,3/4/2014,2.0,Do not go on a Tuesday night when they have a beer tasting class. Your waiter will ignore you to serve sample beers to the class. I had to walk to the service bar to get my Sierra Mist refill. My roast beef dip sandwhich was cold and I didn't feel like sending it back for obvious reasons.
Vickie C.,South Pasadena  CA,316,635,304,2/19/2013,2.0,I'm not sure if this BJ's is subpar due to being new or if they are just not good. I came here on a Sunday for lunch with my family and the place was pretty empty. The interior of the building is gorgeous with the high ceilings and ornate details. We ordered appetizers and pizza to share. The appetizers were pretty good. But the deep dish pizza was terrible. It came out cold and the dough was soggy and felt a bit undercooked. At other BJ's  the pizza is served in the pan. For some reason  this one was served on a plate. I don't know what's wrong with their pizza chef  but he needs to fix this recipe quick! Service was great until the very end. Throughout the meal  she came to check up on us quite frequently. But at the end when we needed some to-go boxes and the check  she was no where to be found. It took a while for us to even flag her down as she went MIA. Overall  this would be a great place to grab drinks and food as you watch sports game if they improve on the taste of the food. Parking: This place has no parking. If you park at Paseo  you need to remember to get validation from Gelson's or Macy's for 90 mins free. The Gelson's validation is self-validation. The machine is right by the front entrance of the market. If not  be prepared to pay $$.
Paula M.,Toluca Lake  Los Angeles  CA,35,87,20,3/18/2015,1.0,1 star because I was gouged $9 for parking 2.5 hrs. I was told BJ's is the only business there that doesn't validate. Almost doubles the price of my meal. The food was average and a good server would have refilled our drinks without having to flag him down. Aesthetically  it's very nice inside  ala Cheesecake Factory.
Stephanie P.,Pasadena  CA,34,9,1,6/15/2015,2.0,Food and drink ok. Not sure about work ethic. Very slow. Hostess eating and drinking at hostess stand. Classy place!! LOL
Tom G.,Fontana  CA,0,38,30,10/1/2015,4.0,Very beautiful setting. The food was very good & cooked well. The server was very nice & attentive. The bar was incredible. Very clean  but the bench seat I was sitting on needed repair. Other than that it was a pleasant experience.
David N.,Wilmington  Los Angeles  CA,28,122,38,7/7/2015,4.0,I came here today with a big group from my summer program. The service was odd  with my 24 size group  we had all you can eat pizza and salad with sides being seperate charge per plate. The pizza was subpar  but the Caesar chicken salad was very good. The drinks stayed full  but again the one star was lost due to the chewy pizza.
Barry A.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,,6/8/2016,1.0,Horrible experience! Made us wait over 45 mins even with our reservation. Didn't give any utensils or plates when the food came out. Waitress didn't bring any spoons for our soups. Forgot to take our drink orders. Would never come here again. Waiter was clueless and slow.
Aaron Q.,Los Angeles  CA,17,9,,5/3/2015,1.0,The worst location we have been to. Rarely saw our waiter. We waited almost a half hour to be served. Drink service (refills) was poor. Our food was cold upon arriving and had to be re-heated. Upon completing our dinner  we waited twenty minutes for the waiter to return so we could ask for the check. We then waited an additional twenty minutes for it to be brought to us. Needless to say  we left no tip. We found out afterward that the server charged my brother-in-law's card three times.
Lexi C.,South Pasadena  CA,131,85,27,1/17/2014,2.0,Sighhhhhhhhhh.... I've always liked BJ's---- until this one opened. It's SO gorgeous  and conveniently located. Why did you have to fall short? :(Don't get me wrong- I don't HATE it but it certainly doesn't leave me wanting more. The service always SUCKS. Our visits usually start off great then  NEVER fails  our server goes missing. What the heck?? I kid you not  my boyfriend and I started joking that they must go on break once we get our meals.I hope the servers tip the bussers really well seeing as how they tend to be the only ones interested in bringing us the things we need. e.g. Plates  napkins  the dressing that SHOULD come with the wings  straws  the lemon I ASKED for with my water... I could go on but I think you get it. The food has never been bad  but I guess after waiting for them to bring you the necessary items in order to enjoy your food  it goes cold. You can't really win. Or at least I haven't been able to.Stars for effort. I guess.
B. G.,San Gabriel  CA,11,9,15,4/22/2015,1.0,Today was the worst experience I've ever had at any of the BJ's Restaurants. I was there with a larger group and the waiter seemed to be in a tail spin. He delivered my salad to the wrong table and my soup was cold.
David M.,Compton  CA,0,13,,6/4/2016,1.0,The food and drink were bad!! $30 down the drain. Baby back ribs were overcooked. The margarita was way too sweet. The service was Ok. Never been to a BJs before and don't think I will try another again.
lynn p.,Pasadena  CA,2,8,1,4/11/2015,1.0,"Stay far far away from this place!!! I can\'t believe I even gave this place a second chance. The first time I came we were given a buzzer/pager thing. We were waiting in the waiting area: after being told our wait would be about 15 minutes. Well  after 30 minutes  I asked the hostess if we were coming up soon. She told me....oh we already called/pages your table. I told her our buzzer never went off her response was ""yeah   they don\'t really work"". She then seated us at the back of the rest. Once we were seated  we waited 15 minutes until a waiter told us they\'d be right with us. We got up and left. Returned to this nightmare of a place the other day because I had to meet someone there. Ordered a wedge: which was the hardest piece of iceberg I\'ve ever seen. I could barely cut it with a knife. And when I reached the inside  it was black and moldy. Yum. I will NEVER come back. EVER. stay away."
Maureen W.,South Pasadena  CA,655,816,7,11/27/2012,3.0,Finally got a chance to come to the new Pasadena outpost of BJS. The space is quite lovely...high ceilings and lots of booth and a big fat bar if you just want a cocktail while you shop at the nearby Paseo.I met my friend for lunch and we split a salad and a gluten free pizza. I was rather impressed with the pizza. I don't normally eat gluten free but my friend does so I was game. The crust was really crispy but the cheese and sauce were perfect. Kind of a wood fired affect all around. The salad was decent  the BBQ Chicken salad  but it's kind of hard to mess up a salad. Service was very nice  our waitress was quick and friendly. Beware though--they will try to convince you that you want a pizookie. While normally  I'm all about desserts  I had to resist with every fiber of my being the allure of the pizookie because I was still feeling so fat and bloated from Thanksgiving! MUST RESIST URGE TO EAT PIZOOKIE ALL TO MYSELF!By the way  they don't validate mall parking but they do have a valet at the dinner time rush.
Afsoon B.,Glendale  CA,3,27,12,3/21/2015,1.0,We ordered some thing as our appetizer. After a long time waiting they brought a dish that was dirty and cold. I asked them to change it  and that took us lots of waiting. The appetizer and the main course arrived together  and that wasn't good.
Lorena C.,Pasadena  CA,34,18,13,1/2/2015,3.0,Prior to this evening I have had a pretty good experience at BJs  unfortunately today was not. The hostess was not very inviting nor made us feel welcomed! Her telling us the wait was an hour long was given to us as discouragement to not wait! The wait was not an hour long but only 35 minutes for a party of nine. She came off not so friendly. :( We waited very long time for a waiter after being seated  as a matter of fact we had to ask for a waiter to take our drinks and our orders! I asked for a manager bc we thought our lil one had lost her purse  well sadly the manager never came by!! :/ We found the purse but not the manager! The waiter however  was very cordial  and attentive The food was good. I don't think I will return. So sad....
Wayne E.,Alhambra  CA,400,124,128,12/1/2012,4.0,I love BJ's how could you not love bj's captain crunch french toast  the piranha chili  burgers  pizza's  pizookies. This facility is new  I think it used to be a bank or something. I apparently am the duke because I've been here so much since it's opening. They really spruced the place up and the staff while new and possibly inexperienced have not let me down service wise since I've been there. It's one of our go to spots. I'm glad I don't have to drive all the way over to arcadia now to enjoy one of my favorite brewery's to eat/drink/desert at. The only thing that has consistently bothered me about this place and has nothing to do with the service or food or anything. But it's the floors  I'm not sure what kind of shoes the staff wears but there is some kind of coating on the floors that makes it feel like a waxed skateboard bottom. I feel like someone is eventually going to hurt themselves on it  again could be something completely out of their control. But I thought it would be worth mentioning.
Joline P.,La Crescenta-Montrose  CA,53,33,1,7/1/2015,2.0,The Sriracha Brussels Sprouts are amazing  the tortilla soup is very good. Everything else is inconsistently good or just plain terrible. My daughter liked the happy face fries.The dine in service is terrible and It is practically impossible to order food to-go  pay by phone and pick up your order seamlessly. I work in the office building upstairs from this location so one would think that it would be very easy and convenient ordering from here. Today I ordered a cup of soup at 2:10pm  paid with an app on my phone  showed up at 2:35pm. The only guy in the front area was on the phone and after a very long conversation  he asked if I had been helped. Who would have helped me? We have both been standing here together through your conversation and no one else is here! Then he left and sent someone else over who also left to find my food. Then a different person came to help (without my food) but couldn't find my order. Then he left and got someone else to help and neither of them could find my order. Finally a BJ's server that was dressed in plain clothes listening to another BJ's server that appeared to be on break complaining about her personal problems finally taught both of them how to pull up a to-go order. While I was grateful to him for finally helping  I thought it was rude that the two of them took up the whole bench  which was the only space for me to sit while I waited through the whole circus of how many people it takes to get one person a cup of tortilla soup. THEN FINALLY one of them left to actually go and get the soup from the kitchen  so I waited for that for a while. When the guy with my soup started talking to another guest and fumbling with my bag I just grabbed my cup of soup  asked for a spoon and stormed out  not that anyone cared or noticed how ridiculous the whole thing was. If I hadn't already paid I would have left long ago.This is not the first time I've been through this fiasco. I've complained twice before about pick up orders (time wasted  forgotten pieces of my meal) but no one cares. I suspect the GM gets a lot of complaints and is completely burnt out. Until then I guess I'll just go if I'm desperate  haven't had the opportunity to roll my eyes lately or feel like being treated poorly when I have extra time on my hands with nothing to do. Until then!
Sean C.,Fremont  CA,1008,1374,2124,10/14/2013,4.0,A good BJ's is always a good BJ's -- when it's offered you'll never see me turn one down -- but this Pasadena location is the Mecca of them all: Huge spread  palatial  estimated hundred-foot high ceilings  stained glass  Tuscany-like paint  patio space  grand TVs  well-endowed table space. On this visit  sans deep dish Pizza  four of us wanted to share Pazookies  because we're like Pazookie monsters naturally (Pazookies are big baked cookies  slightly melty and oozy inside  with a dallop of ice cream on top). OK  just me  I'm the monster. The dilemma then becomes whether to order one or two. Because a monster like me -- a white guy like me can be called Me the Monster  or Gorging White Man Monster -- can eat one to myself  that's right  I'll eat that whole thing on my own and not even look up at you. But check this out: Did you know you can order the PAZOOKIE SAMPLE TRIO(!) with three medium sized cookies of your choice (Macadamia  Chocolate Chip  Cookies & Cream!) and ice cream to share amongst friends? Bang for your buck  bang for your mouth  I hogged one of them! #bazooka-of-taste and #selfishness
Jason O.,Pasadena  CA,233,280,6,5/7/2014,4.0,Fifth stop of the pub-crawl.Before leaving the paseo  we had to stop at BJ's. First we met up with 3 or 4 of our other friends who had to get a late start on the crawl due to silly priorities like work and family. Once inside we randomly ran into our friend Black Jen. She is totally awesome and she had a few of her friends with her so suddenly we went from an enthusiastic group of 3 to an energetic group of 8 or 9. The BJ's in Pasadena has all the great food and beer you expect at all their locations but this BJ's is really fancy. It has a really high ceiling and they decided to go with a less industrial brewery look in favor of a slightly more upscale swanky dinning look. It still feels like a BJ's but it's really nice. I think our bar tender was named Giselle  but I can't remember. Our service was good. I finished my Jeremiah Red and we all started to make our way down the hill toward Old Town.
Montserrat S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,11,15,7/19/2015,5.0,Went a couple of days ago  server Marco was funny and extremely nice  appetizers came out super fast. Main course came out 10-15 minutes later which gave me enough time to stuff my face with avocado rolls and spinach artichoke dip. Bacon guacamole burger was amazing. Ended it all with classic chocolate chunk pizookie. Another server helped with bringing out the food  I didn't catch his name but he was nice about everything even when my brother asked for a replacement top bun without the mayonnaise. Always super friendly servers and great experiences when I come here.
Jen T.,Pasadena  CA,0,14,6,4/15/2016,3.0,Ladies in the front werent so accommodating. We had good seats. Food is good. Service is bad. Cant even find our server. Parking is at Paseo  not so bad. WOW. mac and cheese took them almost an hour to serve.
Randi C.,Hesperia  CA,9,28,11,7/14/2014,5.0,The building was amazing  even my kids appreciated the history of it. Waitress was great and food was delicious!Located right next to parking garage which was nice as well.
Matthew L.,Rosemead  CA,0,2,,4/11/2016,5.0,I love this particular BJ's  I work in Glendale and eat there often the service is great and the environment is friendly. Holy Family church was blessed to revive a generous donation to feed our entire youth group. I recommend this location and I'm proud that they are support the city of Glendale.
Jules D.,Los Angeles  CA,0,12,4,3/18/2016,5.0,I had a great experience. Chad was a very attentive and personable waiter. The meal was spot on  especially the Pizookie dessert. The place itself is very ornate and looks fancy. Definitely the best looking BJs I have been to.
Maga G.,La Plata  Argentina,5,32,,9/25/2014,5.0,Excellent customer attention  it has some of the best beers and burgers.The price is really good for the food and for the beers  I highly recommend the beers tasters.
Brooke S.,Montrose  CA,2,40,5,5/17/2015,2.0,First visit  we hardly saw our waiter. They had run out of avocado egg rolls. Second visit  better waitress  but they had run out of two different desserts. Our pizzas took forever and were cold and they had to redo the kids Mac and cheese because it was cold (they didn't even bring it out because she said it looked bad). They need better management and a better chef.
Renee S.,South Pasadena  CA,15,76,177,2/7/2016,1.0,NEVER WILL COME TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN  My granddaughter had a birthday party here last week and the service is terrible  the wait is ridiculously long and the waiter is disgusting. Ordered my son's their famous pizookie cookies and ice cream desserts and this guy brings it to our table and the ice cream scoops are double stacked and one fell over and this moron scoops the entire ball of ice cream up with all five fingers and smashed it on top of the other scoop of ice cream  right in front of everyone lol. Are you kidding me  thought I was being punked for a minute so I say really dude you just picked up our ice cream with your gross bare hands and he tells me  well my hands are clean  oh ok take it back no thanks and check please.... oh and food is not good like other locations  O had the grilled fish tacos with nothing inside bit a cold cabbage and I had to send the calamari back and have them remove it from the bill because it was so greasy and tasted like rubber bands. TIP for the management TRY AGAIN  FIRE your entire staff including the CHEF'S because you won't be in business for long.
Kamala C.,Costa Mesa  CA,3,65,6,8/28/2013,2.0,My firm just moved in to the building across the street and we went on a Friday afternoon to celebrate with lunch and drinks.The plus of going to a BJ's is that you know what you are getting - zero surprises. Unfortunately  this particular restaurant is pretty horrendous. The building is amazing - the waiters are nice - the booze tastes the same - BUT - WOW! HOLY SLOW.Everything just slowly went downhill as the meal progressed. It took forever to get our beers and food. On top of that  our lunches were all delivered separately - I got mine twenty minutes after my co-worker. No joke.It is just too bad. Great location - but the service is slow and amateur.
wendie w.,San Francisco  CA,2,11,,1/3/2015,2.0,Good luck getting the price of a cocktail before you order. No cocktail prices on the menu. Asked our server and she was able to give us a range ($8.75-$15) but couldn't tell us the price of any individual drink. She said she could only see the price when she entered the order into the computer system. Wow  how is that even legal.Had the caesar salad  it was boring. But the potato skins were very yummy.
Mona C.,Santa Ana  CA,17,120,132,3/5/2014,3.0,"Broke my heart to find out they got rid of the red velvet pizookie! On the upside;-friendly service-open late -gorgeous location (interior and decor) -great happy hour-plenty of TVs for watching sports -mini size options for pizzas and desserts -large variety of food and pizzasOn the downside;-they don\'t validate parking -only the bar area is open late -no more red velvet pizookie -pizza is premade-all they do is warm it up and you can taste that in the quality Why oh why do these restaurants insist on having a million things on the menu and specializing in none? They claim they specialize in pizzas but sticking a frozen pizza in the oven is not specializing IMHO. I came here late on a Monday since it was just about the only thing open. Had a BBQ chicken pizza which was barely warm-cheese has barely melted. I forgot about that distinctive ""frozen"" taste premade food has untill I bit into this pizza. Our waiter was very friendly and professional. Maybe I\'ve been spoiled but I just can\'t stand the taste of these places that simply warm the food up. As much as I can\'t stand it  the pizookies are too good to ignore forever...I\'ll be back."
Carrie D.,Pasadena  CA,1484,416,2,8/29/2014,1.0,"Speed of service and proper training of staff matters...and really  these are two of the most basic elements of running a good restaurant. This BJ\'s cannot even meet the basic minimum standards of customer service.Stopped in for lunch today because I had gotten several emails from BJ\'s alerting me to the fact they currently had the ""Party for 2"" special. This is a great deal  especially since they have a gluten free version. My partner-in-crime Brian V. and I decided to take advantage of the offer and have lunch there today...I deeply regret this decision.When our server Christobal arrived to take our order (and it took him quite a while to actually arrive to take our order) he was completely clueless as to the fact there was a ""Party of 2"" special. I received 5 different emails from BJ\'s and it is featured on their website  yet a server in their restaurant had no idea what the special was  or that it even existed at all. We showed him the BJ\'s website on our phone  but he had to go and check with the manager...oh surprise  there is indeed a ""Party of 2"" special. We ordered two waters  a bowl of clam chowder  a wedge salad  and a gluten free pizza with mushrooms  tomatoes  green peppers  and olives. A few minutes later Christobal arrived with plates for our pizza...but no drinks. I asked about the water and got the response  ""Oh...yeah...it\'s coming..."" A few minutes later our soup and salad arrived (delivered by a food runner)...and then...finally...we got our water.We finished our starters...and waited...and waited...and eventually our pizza arrived...without tomatoes. I pointed out to Christobal that our pizza was missing the tomatoes we ordered. He took out his order pad/whatever he wrote our order on and said  "".oh yeah."" He took our pizza back to the kitchen...and again we waited. He showed up a while later with our pizza...and it had tomatoes on it...but they were  raw  cold  wet  tomatoes that had simply been thrown on top of our cooked pizza. When I told Christobal that this was not acceptable he seemed confused...""You wanted tomatoes on you pizza right?"" MY answer was  ""yes  but I wanted them to actually be cooked on to the pizza like all of the other toppings."" He took the pizza away. He came back and told us the manager was going to bring us our pizza...and we waited...and waited...and waited some more. Eventually a female manager (do not know her name because she did not introduce herself) brought our pizza back to us...I say ""back"" because it was the original tomato-less pizza with tomatoes and more cheese sprinkled on it that had been shoved under the salamander to kind of  sort of  not really melt the cheese. I was actually speechless at this point...really  how is any of this a good solution? Raw tomatoes...that is just stupid...but to bring a re-fired  mess of a pizza back to an already aggravated customer is the height of bad customer service. The ""Party for 2"" comes with a pizookie...we got the gluten free one...it was fine. But  we had to wait forever and a day to get the check from our server. And then  to add insult to injury  I wanted to use some of my rewards points (accumulated at many other BJ\'s...not this one) which would give us $10 off the meal. After waiting...again...a long time...Christobal arrives and tells us that the manager is working on our check  but because we got the ""Party for 2"" I may not be able to use my coupon. Coupon  what coupon? These are rewards points that BJ\'s gives me for being a loyal customer. He just looked at me with apathy  disinterest  and confusion. I told him we needed the check right now...we needed to leave...just bring the check. OMG ...waiting...waiting...finally Christobal arrives with the check and tells us that they were indeed able to apply my rewards points.This was seriously one of the single worst customer service experiences I have ever had  anywhere. A person who had just wakled off the street could have been a more informed and capable server than Christobal. I would assume that BJ\'s has a training program for managers and servers...perhaps our server was just absent that say. And clearly the manager was absent that day too. Seriously  do yourself a favor...go to one of the other fine eating establishments in Pasadena."
Yelp R.,NORTHRIDGE  CA,25,78,297,6/15/2014,3.0,Service is pretty slow. There are TVs every where so it's good to watch games. We enjoyed watching the soccer World Cup game between England and Italy.Washroom were a little dirty. They don't validate the parking but 1.5 hrs is allowed in Paseo Colorado parking when you go to a restaurant.
Christian A.,Pasadena  CA,22,54,20,4/11/2015,5.0,I love the place  the enviroment and the wait staff are very proffessional our waitress was on top of it   and she was very social with us and a very nice girl. I ordered the Bison burger and is just delicious  I live in Pasadena but I usually go to other BJ locations but Pasadena got me this time.
Andee A.,Chesterfield  MO,0,37,2,10/11/2015,1.0,Worst service ever! Party of four  we got a table right away on Saturday night  but they stuck us in a corner and forgot about us. Food  once we finally got it  was quite good but we were thoroughly aggravated by the waiter's lengthy absences and inability to deliver our complete order. It turned a lovely evening out with family into a real drag. We will never  ever return.
Adam O.,Long Beach  CA,332,146,13,5/31/2013,5.0,"I usually wait a while to post to yelp. I figure it\'s best to let things settle for a while and let the hyperbole die down before the fingers hit the keyboard. But after my visit last night to BJs Pasadena  I simply could not wait! My family and I (a group of about 10) ventured in here after my brother\'s graduation from Alhambra High. We\'ve been to BJs plenty of times before at various locations so I wasn\'t really excited about this trip but was just stoked to get out of the sun and in to some pizookie! I\'ve been told by many friends that this location was formerly a bank and is ""really nice"". But I guess my friends are lacking in figurative language because this location is simply amazing! As you walk in  beautifully massive chandeliers greet you as you enter in to a restaurant that resembles something out of Chicago circa 1940. The ceilings are high and decorated in dark wooden squares accented with gold. The place is massive but doesn\'t feel cavernous and is overflowing with class. I couldn\'t help but walk around the dining room and gawk at everything as if I were in a museum. But enough about the setting. Let\'s get on to the food and service. My mom called ahead to make sure we had a table when we arrived. As we walked in  we were immediately greeted and brought to our table. As soon as we all sat down  the manager came to say hello and offer a congrats to my little brother. Right away  everyone made us feel right at home. Our server  Marvina  then arrived and kept the great mood flowing. She was probably the friendliest and most up beat waitress I have ever met. After sitting in the sun for 4 hours  she was definitely the perfect person to rejuvenate our batteries and get us ready to feast. Everyone pretty much knows the menu at BJs. You have your pizzas  burgers  sandwiches  and a few other entree items that get you ready for the main prize of a pizookie at the end of the night. I had the Jambalaya which was very authentic and plentiful. A tad on the spicy side though  so beware. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food including my grandparents who are as picky as they come. At the end of the night  Marvina stuck around to make sure we all had a picture with the graduate. She indulged my mother who had her wait around as we fought about different poses and what not. But she was a great sport the entire time. My brother liked her so much  he asked if he could have a picture with her. Of course she obliged and helped put the lid on a pretty great night. After visiting this BJs  I don\'t think I\'ll ever want to go to another location again. Thanks for the great experience!"
Justin S.,Santa Monica  CA,116,82,16,10/19/2013,1.0,Usually a fan of bjs and their food and service is normally good  but this place is definitely under par. We received an appetizer 1.5 hours after we sat down and everything that we received was lukewarm. It took me multiple times to receive ketchup and they brought out a jambalaya with noodles instead of rice  the eff? Would not recommend coming to this bjs  other chains will be a much better experience
K A.,Pasadena  CA,2,24,3,4/12/2013,1.0,"This is different for everyone  but ask yourself this question: ""How many times do you have to have a bad experience before you say  \'This is the last time.\'""?I really want to like this place because it\'s beautiful inside and I love the pizza and beer but the thing about big corporations is that if they have great systems and management  it can be well-runned machine. Unfortunately  this BJ\'s drops the ball. I like to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt if they are just opening or they are extremely busy  but I have been there over SEVERAL  SEVERAL times (can you tell I give them the benefit of the doubt?) and I have to say that I\'ve had enough. Today was the last time. Again  the place is BEAUTIFUL and the food is GREAT  but the service is terrible. I don\'t blame the servers when the service is bad  I blame the management. Some of the problems I\'ve had there are the following (note that sometimes ALL are happening in one experience):- food comes out at different times so one has to wait until everyone is served- no silverware at the table (even after ALL the food has been served)- the wings are cold inside by the bone- takes forever to have someone bring menus  take orders  get your beers  etc.- This one really bugs me (can they get a better system for this already?? It happens at all BJ\'s): Someone comes around with food you didn\'t order and asks if you ordered it. Then someone else will come by with something else and ask if this is for you... Come on already! Stop interrupting me already - I have all my food (even though it took a long time!)Long story short  IF YOU VALUE CUSTOMER SERVICE and a management that gives a damn  KEEP WALKING."
Lisa K.,Pasadena  CA,0,184,14,3/19/2015,2.0,I never go to national chain restaurants  but after a pretty terrible day  I wanted to eat my feelings and we ended up here. We got stuck in a corner booth in the back of the restaurant where we repeatedly got forgotten. The waitress blamed the huge parties that came in and the food runner since they forgot parts of our order and the kitchen for being backed up. The food we did get was below average  calorie bombs  we even tried their new pizza which was a soggy mess in the middle. So pretty much never again. Just don't bother  find a local place that has great pizza.
Tony C.,Los Angeles  CA,1,12,2,1/2/2014,2.0,"BEWARE!!! THEY DO NOT VALIDATE!!! Don\'t play into the trickery! They are not part of ""Paseo Colorado"". Other than that. Food is good  service is good  pizookie was delicious! Try the stuffed spinach mushrooms."
Mart N.,Glendale  CA,0,6,2,8/16/2014,1.0,Only pro: The interior is one of the nicest I've seen in a casual restaurant.Cons:If only I could give them a zero. This is the slowest BJ's I have ever been to. The wait time wasn't so bad considering it's a Saturday night - only five minutes. The food took forever to come out  and the pizookies took 45 minutes to come out. 45 MINUTES?! I think they milked a cow  then churned the ice cream in the back. When they did finally come out  the pizookies were ice cold. The food is always delicious  but one of our plates came out with no fries. We were told they would be out when they were ready. About 15 minutes later out waiter brought out an old plate of wedges that looked like they came from another persons plate. When we got the check  we still hadn't gotten our fries. When we mentioned it to the waiter  he LAUGHED it off as if it wasn't a big deal. One last thing - the waiter spilled hot sauce all over our table  when he was taking one of our plates back. Terrible.Sad to say this is the worst experience I've had at a BJ's. I will definitely not come back to this location.Considering this is on Colorado blvd.  and there's a bunch of other restaurants  look elsewhere  or be prepared for an infuriating experience. FYI: They do not validate for parking.
Luis V.,Palmdale  CA,0,2,,9/29/2014,1.0,Food at bj's is great! But the service we received at this location by  Dianna W. was HORRIBLE! She took forever to come to our table to take our order and then took forever to bring us our drinks then when she finally brought us our food she didnt bring any condiments for my steak or wife's pasta and she never asked if we wanted a refill and didnt even come back to check on us and it wasnt even busy when we went. That server is lucky to still work here shes SUCKS at her job. Hopefully if you come here she dosent help you out make sure you dont get stuck with her. I love BJ'S but on that day I had a horrible experience.
Dan S.,Pasadena  CA,42,87,47,1/25/2014,3.0,It's a chain. For the most part; if you've been to 1  you've been to them all. This one is a bit unique due to the architecture of the interior  particularly the bar. The service is above average more often than not... Except if you're alone and you get up to go use the facilities  then your food and drink will get tossed. even when you tell someone  or multiple servers... it's great that they're so on top of keeping the place presentable  but it's frustrated me a couple of times. I do have a few favorites  like the cobb salad  their flat bread pizzas are good for snacking  the black cherry soda is good (over ice or it's too sweet). The pizza is a bit too greasy for my taste  but I will go for it every now and again with their Jeremiah Red. And the white chocolate macadamia pizookie is purdy tasty. Bottom line - depending on your mood there's better there are also a LOT worse. This place is consistent.
Winnie C.,Pasadena  Los Angeles  CA,0,4,24,11/15/2014,1.0,Do not use online order service!!! Seriously!!!My pick up time supposed to be 9:00 pm. I arrived on time  but I waited for someone to help me for about 10 minutes. Food were cold. The portion was unbelievable small. I remembered that the portion was bigger if dining there. Very disappointed!
Al B.,Pasadena  CA,74,87,117,3/6/2013,1.0,I had a bad experience at BJ's today. I walked in for a late lunch and sat at the bar. I ordered a root beer  a half turkey Cobb sandwich and a tomato soup. There was a couple at the bar also. The runner brought them their half sandwich orders. A few minutes later  another runner brought three tomato soups out to the couple and me. (I always thought that soup should come out before the sandwich...no concept of timing). To our surprise the soup was totally cold. We complained to the bartender (short Hispanic girl who was nice and apologetic) and she took the couple's two soups back to the kitchen to tell the manager. A short time later  a runner who was dressed as if he were the assistant manager (male Caucasian  6-0  chubby  black hair) brought out my sandwich. I told him about my cold soup which was still sitting in front of me. He smugly told me that they were aware of the problem and were taking care of it. I asked him if he could take my soup away. He refused saying that the bartender would take care of it. The bartender had not returned from the kitchen and was not at the bar. I asked again and he argued with me that the bartender had a receptacle below the bar to put the bowl of soup away in. He had a poor  condescending attitude and I told him so. He then rudely and aggressively removed the bowl of soup making some smart alec comments.I then got up  told the manager that his runner was an asshole and left the restaurant. I have frequented the restaurant for lunch in the past and have never been treated so poorly. FYI  ever since BJ's Pasadena opened  it has developed a reputation for poor service amongst the locals. Just check out some of the other reviews. If this is how customers are supposed to be treated it will be only a matter of time before BJ's Pasadena goes belly up.
Raf D.,Carson  CA,58,16,109,2/16/2014,3.0,You get what you pay for!!! Baby back ribs were kind of dry  and the steak was descent.. Mahi mahi tasted good. Overall it's average! Our server was very nice and professional! I rather pay a little more and go to Houston's
Roy A.,Glendale  CA,0,11,,9/14/2015,1.0,Do yourself a favor and go to cpk instead. 45 minutes and still no food. Waiter keep saying it's coming. What a joke
Daniel P.,Pasadena  CA,1,18,,10/29/2013,2.0,"Went there Friday night for a quick dinner. Despite the existence of empty tables the hostess tried to seat us UNDER a TV in the corner so we couldn\'t see the TV but everyone was looking our way. Once we moved to a new section  things didn\'t get better. The waitress complained that she had too many tables and that it was going to take her ""awhile"".Our food came out all at different times. What do you do? Wait for your friends\' food to come  i.e. eat cold food or do you eat by yourself? My burger was supposed to be medium rare  but came out as a hockey puck instead. My friend\'s chicken soup came out as vegetable soup but who cares  at least the beers were cold."
My Feedback S.,Pasadena  CA,1,32,10,3/14/2016,3.0,The food is good..the service is horrible during the lunch hour. The front staff (if any) seem lost at times. Your best bet is to sit at the bar and eat there...eventually someone will approach you.
Arbi B.,Glendale  CA,44,17,4,2/3/2013,2.0,First off  let me say that I love the BJ's chain. I have gone to numerous locations across Southern California. But this location failed me. Although this is probably the nicest and biggest BJ's I have been too  the service was not good at all. We went as a group of four. One of my friend's ordered a tortilla soup and it was just full of oil. I also tasted the soup and it did not taste like tortilla soup at all. It tasted like a spoon full of straight oil. My friend's little sister ordered a Mac and Cheese and it came cold. I ordered the spicy jalapeno burger  which was supposed to come with a spicy chipotle sauce on it  but they failed to put it on the burger. I asked my server for the chipotle sauce three times  THREE TIMES  before she finally brought it. Then I asked for spicy buffalo sauce and she also forgot to bring that. Finally  I asked someone else to bring it. We decided to order a pizooke for the table. After 15 min of waiting for our pizooke  we asked for an update on our dessert. She indicated to us that the order was never put in the system. We were forced to wait another 10 min for it. Then we can get outside to the valet for BJ's. We waited 15 min for our car to be brought to the front and it was not busy at all. On top of that  two of the valet workers brought the car together. One was driving and the other was in the passenger seat. The valet worker in the passenger seat decided that it was okay for her to have a starbucks drink in my car. On top of that  when she opened the passenger door to get out  she just slammed the door right as I was about to enter the car. I don't care about having drinks in my car  but your a valet parking worker...you're supposed to have the best interests of my car...and that clearly wasn't the case here.Overall  this is the BJ's way of doing business. I know its a new restaurant  but you're supposed to make a good impression for this new location and this BJ's failed to do so.
HourLy L.,Monterey Park  CA,186,282,301,12/30/2013,3.0,I've been to a few different BJ's and usually order the same things. Yay:-Traditional wings (appetizer): I love how they make theirs. Crispy and not too oily. I always order this.-Shrimp Scampi pasta: my bf loves this dish and he's not a big pasta eater but this is his go to dish when he comes here. Nice flavors and not too greasy either.-Pizooki: warm cookie topped with ice cream. I really like the oreo with vanilla ice cream. They gave my friend a mini one for free for his bday.-Honey crisp chicken salad: this is my favorite salad from all their salads. Great honey mustard dressing with crispy chicken. It's a large portion so it's really filling.Other:-Jalapeno Burger: kind of greasy and although they put fried jalapenos in it  this burger lacks flavor.Nay:-Parking: for some reason they're not considered part of paseo even though they share the same parking lot so you have to get it validated at one of the other shops. Or you can just go to the self validation area near PF Changs.
Bell B.,Pasadena  CA,0,5,,3/1/2016,1.0,Come here if you want to wait for your food for a hour! Floors were so dirty  food sucks  and let me tell you about the bathroom disgusting! It was like a tornado tissue paper and seating papers all over the floor  it's just a bad BJS restaurant. I will never come back here... Why spend all that money if it's not worth it. I learned my lesson.Plus parking sucks had to pay $4 even with validating
Anh-Dao T.,Los Angeles  CA,187,819,18,7/18/2013,3.0,Their TVs went out three times while we were watching the All-Star game. I think I booed too loudly because the guy fixing the monitor suddenly stopped and looked up. I kept my mouth shut after that and we left during the fourth inning. I'd rather follow the game on my phone. Only their Tuesday wine special made the visit worthwhile. (50% off all glasses and bottles at the bar)
Travis C.,Alhambra  CA,108,17,,5/12/2013,2.0,Awesome building and interior  huge tv's in bar area.We ordered the lettuce and chicken appetizer  which consisted basically of lettuce leafs and a very small bowl of chicken for wraps. The drinks were terrible  tasted like a $10 fruit punch  the waiter said that they had company policy on mixed drinks. The food was okay nothing spectacular.
Daniel W.,Pasadena  CA,8,5,,8/23/2014,2.0,Amazing Art Deco interior sadly let down with average service ordered 4 drinks only got 3- sides brought out with starters just generally poor! Food was okay the ribs great pasta cold over cooked and dry ! Don't think we will repeat!
Karina G.,Pasadena  Los Angeles  CA,43,8,3,1/18/2014,4.0,My boyfriend and I really enjoy this place. The service is great and the booze is good. The food is pretty average. The football happy hour is great. It's never super crowded or noisy. The building itself is just beautiful. Definitely one of my favorite spots in Pasadena.
Nathanial H.,Los Angeles  CA,0,1,,10/31/2015,1.0,The poor service and worse food has inspired me to sign up for yelp. This place is seriously in need of a wake up call. My family and I will not go back.
Cynthia S.,Granada Hills  Los Angeles  CA,382,284,61,12/4/2012,3.0,New Location!!!It's beautiful inside... one of the best BJ's I've been too (look-wise) ... Very nice Bar!Got seated right away in a little cute booth on the side... Waiter came by  gave us the specials and what was good on the drink menu... ordered the usual Avocado eggrolls... you can never go wrong with that one.. So delicious.. The drinks were ok! I got the Sangria... (it was just ok) The Plum beer was great... Ordered our food... Took too long to come out.. The steak which we wanted well done was Med rare! The lobster tail looked kinda gross and had no flavor... The chicken in the chicken Marsala was good  but the pasta was not cooked well..Waiter took TOO LONG with the check... when we put the card in there  he took TOO LONG to pick it up . and then went to the side while we're staring at him since we were in a hurry he was chit chatting with a co-worker and wasn't sliding the card so we could get out of there... Beautiful place... service needs a lot of work... Food we need to make sure we insist on how we like our food next time... Finally a BJ's in Pasadena! I hope they improve the service since I would LOVE to go back again!
A C.,Los Angeles  CA,0,5,,6/25/2014,2.0,We visited BJ's Sunday morning with family from out of town. Mainly because they are huge soccer fans and the screens are there abundantly. It was not very crowded and we all ordered simple breakfast: eggs  potatoes  sausage and toast and one person ordered a steak. The service was extremely SLOW!!! At least 45-60 minutes for breakfast? Ridiculous!!And the toast was brought cold... no jelly  no ketchup for the potatoes. And when asked it took another 10 minutes for the condiments. In other words  I had already eaten most of my toast by the time condiments came.I was embarrassed that I brought my guests here and the only thing that made the visit bearable was the fact that the World Cup was being shown.This is the second time I had received slow service at this BJ'S. The first time was on my Son's Birthday! Uuugh!Won't be visiting again....
Khrystyna C.,Huntington Beach  CA,19,211,52,1/5/2014,4.0,Lots of televisions so it's good for sports in the bar area. They have their own beer and I've found some to be to my liking and others not do much. Personal taste. The good part they will give you a taste to figure out which one you would like. I'm fond of their lightening and the blonde. It seems I've grown out of enjoying IPA's maybe due to enjoying wine with less harsh and more complex notes. If you enjoy IPA's you will enjoy it. Food: Caesar salad is perfect every time. So crisp and refreshing. Mahi Mahi over rice is so good. Tender  tasty  mouth watering and always the perfect temperature. The main issue I have is keep ordering the same thing because I know it will be great. Dessert: the pizookie is ok if your a fan of chocolate. Grilled chicken pasta was a little bland but the gourmet Mac and cheese was super flavorful. However the fresh cut strawberry on the beignet is refreshing and the perfect ending to a meal. Your not left feeling over stuffed. Good sports bar!Coors light drinkers just order the light switch! Light and refreshing!
Javier S.,Pico Rivera  CA,20,6,1,6/1/2014,1.0,Mediocre pizza and food! After the server serving our incorrect meals and the manager approaching us only to offer us CORRECT meals only after waiting an additional 30 minutes  and then being served the incorrect drinks (beers) waving down the server to notify her  we became extremely upset!! At no point were our needs met! And at no point was service up to par as expected from a chain restaurant like BJS.
Cecilia T.,Pasadena  CA,0,5,,1/18/2016,1.0,First time being at Bjs and it was the worst experience ever. The customer service from the waiter was horrible. We had to keep reminding him orders and who they belonged to. He even disappeared for long periods of time. Also my food was burned and salty. I will not be returning to this restaurant I was really upset with the service.
Breana N.,Pasadena  CA,13,42,20,8/25/2015,1.0,Everytime I come to this BJ's there's always a problem with my food  never fails! This time takes the cake for me though. I'll never spend my money here again! Ordered a cheese pizza with extra sauce and a turkey burger with a caesar salad. You'd think that was simple  but nope  not for them. Took 30-45mins to actually get my food  but before I received my food the waiter brought out the salad. I started mixing my salad and there was this big black thing covered in dressing. I took it out and put it on a napkin and smashed it (I'm sticking to it being a black bean because other possibilities will make me throw up). I sent it back and told my waiter I'll take the fries instead because that was absolutely gross. He apologized and took it back. He then brought out cold fries. At that point I was really irritated and just asked can he bring fresh fries with my burger. When our food finally came out EVERYTHING was wrong! Dry pizza (no extra sauce)  burger thrown together  and cold fries AGAIN. I was livid at that point I just paid and left. NEVER AGAIN!
John S.,La Caada Flintridge  CA,163,223,11,12/17/2012,1.0,I ordered my pizza online and specified a time. Right before I approached the front door  I slipped and fell in the patio area. One of the employees saw me  asked me if I was okay and then resumed his business. So I go to the counter and found out that my pizza wasn't ready. Uh okay. I metered parked it for 15 minutes and then I had to run back to my car to put in more money because they didn't have my pizza ready in time. It took an additional 15 minutes for my pizza. So now I'm on my way home  I get home annoyed and ready to eat my pizza and open the box. My pizza was not cooked all the way through...so let's recap1) I fall2) pizza was late3) I have to put more money in my meter4) my pizza was not cookedI will never come back here...terrible service..
Jim A.,Mountain View  CA,0,16,1,8/29/2015,1.0,Having been to a few good BJ restaurants  we were extremely disappointed with this one. The appetizer plates and main plates were extremely dirty for all 3 of us. Food was cold and bland. Very disappointing...
Diana Jeanne N.,Alhambra  CA,212,167,197,6/28/2013,5.0,You can never go wrong with their pizookie. My girlfriends and I ordered 1 half oreo half chocolate chip. Heaven in your mouth.
TheLaborLawGuy L.,Los Angeles  CA,56,201,17,9/16/2013,3.0,Had brunch here with the kids and wifey. Wifey had the traditional buffalo wings appetizer as a meal since the portion is so huge. I had the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi  which was perfectly cooked. Mahi is low on fat  so it can be very dry if overcooked. Mine was cooked a perfect medium and was juicy and flavorful. My kids had the kids grilled chicken   which was desert dry  and the Captain Crunch french toast sticks  which were overfried and too sweet.  Would have been a perfect 5 star had the kids meals been better prepared. Next time we return  we are avoiding the kids menu.
Mark E.,Los Angeles  CA,132,375,190,10/15/2014,2.0,we had dinner here the other night with a large group (but it seems like most of the diners there were in large groups).it was just ok. my burger was pretty good but the service wasnt great. i asked for a beer right before i got my burger but had to cancel it when i was done with the burger and my beer still hadn't arrived.one of the people on our party didnt get her burger until most of us were almost done. i mean  i know that there are mistakes made but  come on  you guys should be prepared for this.
Crystal C.,Sierra Madre  CA,41,6,2,4/22/2013,1.0,"Can you give 0 stars?The building is amazing - okay  there\'s the 1 star.We went on a slow Thursday night. My son had just finished practice. We ordered 1 beer  water & kid drinks. The water was empty long before the food came. We never had a refill. My son\'s lemonade was refilled but way too far apart. We ordered salads with our pizzas. The salads never came. We asked for them to be removed from our bill  but they were not. Our food came out in a reasonable time. We ordered 2 pizzas & kids\' pasta. Don\'t ask me how  but the pizzas were burnt & cold!!! How does that happen? I\'ve burnt my family\'s food plenty of times - but it always comes to the table warm. ;)No water refills  but the waitress did sell us another beer. The waitress was very polite  but not a good waitress.I had to take my daughter to the restroom twice...kids...both times I slipped on the floors and nearly fell on my bottom.I have a frequent buyer card. I asked them to credit the account  but there was some excuse for me to do it myself at home. So  I did & at the same time sent corporate a note about the issues we had. I never heard from corporate  even though they promised a response within 48 hours. To add insult to injury  I did receive an email from corporate telling me that they ""could not add my points"" no real reason why. So  bad food  poor service  no parking validation  slipped on the floors  and no points means I\'ll never go back! BJ\'s corporate - take notice - many of the reviews are similar to mine. That\'s a lot of rent to pay for that location if people aren\'t coming back. Take time to make it right for your customers - because I won\'t go to the Arcadia/Monrovia location now either.Disappointed @ best!"
Marissa Q.,Los Angeles  CA,17,20,,11/11/2012,1.0,"I was extremely disappointed in the customer service here.They do not take reservations  but they do take a one hour call-ahead. We had a large party (9 people) so we wanted to make sure to get our names in early. We discovered this when my friend called ahead two hours in advance. He was told to call back an hour before we were planning on arriving. When he did so and hour later  the employee on the other end told him that call-ahead was not allowed for parties of 6 or more  directly contradicting what the first employee had said. The employee remained certain of this policy even after numerous polite but incredulous questions about this policy.Despite the lack of call-ahead for our party  we decided to try anyway. When we arrived  the place was totally packed (it was a Friday night  so to be expected). To my dismay  the first thing I saw upon getting to the reception area was a sign that explicitly stated that parties of NINE or fewer could call ahead an hour! AAAAGH! So frustrating.I explained what had happened to the gentleman behind the desk. To make matters worse  the gentleman then gave us a condescending description of their call-ahead policy as stated on the placard I just read. I told him whoever talked to us on the phone was misinformed about the policy. He said the wait is an hour because we have *such a large party * then offered to split us into multiple tables to reduce our wait time to 45 minutes. I asked if they could do anything for us  because we *did* call ahead  but the employee refused to take our name. The gentleman refused. He expectantly asked us again for our names  but I was so fed up I just walked out.This was not an appropriate response. A more convincing apology beyond ""sorry  there\'s nothing I could do"" would have been nice. Perhaps a promise to better educate the staff about their own policies. Because the call-ahead issue wasn\'t our fault (it was the bj\'s fault)  other restaurants with sane customer service policies would bump a party up on the list to at the very least significantly reduce wait time.I have heard the the food here is good  so I\'d be willing to try it again and amend my review. But until I get some sort of apology for the horrendous customer service  I will not be coming back."
Arash S.,Los Angeles  CA,4,56,6,11/2/2014,4.0,I see people complain about the service  but we had a good experience. The food was good quality  the waiter wasn't trying to push drinks  which was nice. Some seats in the bar area don't face a TV  which can be annoying if you're trying to watch a game.
Amy Z.,Rosemead  CA,19,21,7,6/16/2015,3.0,"Came here on a Tuesday at 7. Didn\'t get seated till 8. They said it\'s because it\'s game night. That\'s okay. Order our food at 8:10. The beer we ordered came out wrong and we waited over 30 minutes for our food. It is now 8:40 and when we asked our waitress how long it will take for our food to come. She said ""we are busy so it will take a while."" Ummm... Okay  why did you even seat us to begin with if your kitchen can\'t handle the workload ?! This is ridiculous and I am HANGRY (hungry + angry)"
Heather H.,Pasadena  CA,63,147,,7/2/2014,4.0,Great atmosphere  the building is phenomenal. Food is always good. Can be a little crowded sometimes  so plan for a wait on weekends. Love there small bites starters. Try the Berry cider for the cider fans. Like tasty and refreshing especially in the coming hot Summer months. Add a fresh baked cookie smothered in melting ice cream... you can't get any better than that.
Alisha F.,Brea  CA,13,40,,10/23/2014,4.0,This was my first time visiting this BJ's location and they didn't disappoint. When I go to my usual location in Cerritos  I always order the angel hair classico so I ordered it here too. As always  it was delicious and the garlic bread that comes with it tastes great. Also  the server was friendly. Definitely coming back again.
James A.,Avondale  AZ,9,99,42,8/5/2013,5.0,Wedge salad was off the chain. Then the 12oz ribeye (rare) came out! Gotta get these steaks still bleeding  the meat just melts in your mouth! Waitress was very attentive and was johnny on the spot. I love the setup of this BJ's. Huge 30 - 40ft ceilings? All the BJ's in Phoenix are dumps  but this BJ's blew me away  I can't wait to go back. They have a HUGE bar to get liquored up and get your swerve on.
Damaris B.,Napa  CA,145,10,5,12/4/2015,1.0,Worst service I've ever received. They didn't check up on us once  we got our entrees and we never got out appetizers. We had to ask twice about it and nothing. We had to try and stop multiple waiters and still no help. We had asked for extra condiments and they brought them when we were literally done with our meals. Never got our appetizers. Definitely not coming back here again nor recommending this location to others.
D. R.,Pasadena  CA,0,1,,2/12/2015,2.0,I have never been to the Pasadena Bj's before and probably will not go again. Tonight I decided I would place a curbside order  placed then when to pick-up and could not find the curbside parking that I was told to park at. I called and was told parking was bad at their location  something about a bus stop in front of building couldn't park there  but they would tell me where to park for 90 minutes free and I could come inside to get my order. I was in no mood for that and made up story why I couldn't come in. Found parking on street and they finally said they would come bring order. I am very upset because they should not say they have curbside delivery if they really want you to come inside  felt like bait and switch to me.I will say the girl that came out was polite  and my meal was good  a star for server and cook.
Meggan T.,Pasadena  CA,0,1,,11/10/2012,1.0,This is a new location (open for maybe a month now) and so I will try it one more time in three months and i hope by then things have improved.Pros: Location  Ambiance  Food is Decent. Cons: Service. The bar took a while to make and deliver drinks. The waitress got two of our orders wrong. One of the burgers was well done when the person in our party ordered medium rare and my order was completely wrong. The waitress brought me a calzone and I ordered Gluten-Free Pizza.  Under most circumstances I would have just went with it  but gluten makes me miserably ill and I had been very specific. I had to wait 25 minutes for my actual order and by then my party was done eating. I wound up asking for my order to be boxed up. When we got the check  there were no apologizes and nothing was comped or offered. I worked in the service industry for 5 years and this was really just unacceptable. I really want to love this new place and so I'll try it out in 3 months and hopefully their service will have improved dramatically. But in the meantime  if you do try this place.... Set your expectations very low.Honestly  there are a lot of really great resturants in the area  so I recommend going somewhere else. P.S. It wasn't only our table with issues. I had heard two other people around me complaining and poor service seems to be the status quo.
Patty L.,Pasadena  CA,0,1,,5/1/2013,1.0,Gorgeous place. Great Olympic TV. HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT!!!!!First and LAST time I will ever go to this location. We went for the the USC v. Notre Dame football game. Called 2 weeks in advance to make sure they would be playing the game full screen and double checked with them the night before. We get there for the game and they have it on quarter screen with other games that no is watching. But said after the UCLA v Stanford game was over (about half time) they would switch to full screen. The ENTIRE bar section was there for the USC v Notre Dame game except for ONE customer wanted the Laker game on. The management because of that ONE customer would no longer change the game to full screen even though there are other TVs they could have put the laker game on. We spent $200+ that night on food and drinks for only 3 people. Complained numerous times to the staff  asked to speak with a manager several time  but a manager would never come talk to us. This was BY FAR the WORST restaurant experience/customer service experience I have EVER had. I HIGHLY recommend NOT going there.
Liz H.,Norwalk  CA,0,12,3,2/4/2015,3.0,I love BJ's but most of the time I have to wait a long time either to eat there  or when I order to go. People are friendly but I don't like to wait that long.
Clara C.,Los Angeles  CA,33,57,16,12/30/2014,4.0,One of the nicer BJ's locations I had the chance of dining at. Very large interior with high ceilings and gorgeous wood panels. Ordered my usual Mediterranean Pizza. Love the soft thickness of the crust and how they load it with toppings. Seriously  not one bare space on each slice. It is covered in toppings! Also a big fan of their Pazookie and their Smore's dessert. Large enough to share with a few friends. Location is convenient right near Old Town. Parking may be challenging. They have street parking around the restaurant and across the street.
Deb T.,Pasadena  CA,338,633,70,12/6/2012,5.0,Holy moly!!! WOWOWOWOW! I just love the decor! This is seriously one of the classiest BJ's I have ever been to. For a new location  the service and the food were excellent! I was really excited to see that this restaurant was opening because its a great alternative to the Yard House  which is a bit pricey. I love that I can walk to dinner  and home  so I have an excuse to eat and drink without feeling sick. The big screen is just PHENOMENAL! If you want to see a game  have a seat at the bar and get ready to be mesmerized. I can't wait to go back!
Brenda D.,Los Angeles  CA,191,345,89,3/14/2013,4.0,What is there to say about a chain like BJ's that hasn't already been said about all thousand of them.... They are all pretty much the same. American food with a lot of beer. However This location is gorgeous!Having been a bank in it's former life  this particular location (located right on Colorado in Old Town) is nothing short of grandiose and very classic feeling. I love it just for the look of it. Lots of gorgeous wood and very high ceilings. Definitely worth dropping in for a quick peek. Mind you however  that they don't validate for those who parked in the Paseo parking lot. Valet is available but is still about $7 w/validation from the restaurant. Much more without the validation.
Eddie R.,Twentynine Palms  CA,41,110,311,2/21/2015,5.0,We went to dinner here and I ordered. Tomato and mozzarella salad and the dressing on it was the best I have ever ate and the salad was good to lol but seriously dinner was excellent and I cannot believe how good the dressing was on the salad dressing so if you're ever at BJ's make sure you get the tomato mozzarella salad with the house dressing it looks like chocolate syrup but boy is it good
Darren M.,Arcadia  CA,153,49,13,11/1/2012,4.0,Went to opening night for BJs in Old Town Pasadena. Same reliable fare  but in a really cool setting. This is  I believe  a converted bank turned jewelry mart  with the beautifully-detailed carved ceiling  dramatic columns reaching up to the ornately-designed crown mouldings  and the overall ambiance of a 30's speakeasy. Much more character than any other BJs I've been to. The food is consistently good - what you expect from BJs. The wings appetizer was perfectly crispy; loved the wedge salad with lots of blue cheese; and the kids loved the pizzas. Of course  the pazookie was the pinnacle of the evening.On the negative side - parking - there is nothing really close. They are not  I believe  part of the Paseo Colorado so they do not validate for them. They have parking across the street which is a bit of a walk. We were told that they would have valet service which will start very soon and will be a respectable $3.00 or $4.00.We will be back!
Rob R.,Pasadena  CA,0,22,,2/3/2013,2.0,First of all  I love the BJs chain. I've gone to most of the nearby locations and have enjoyed myself every time. So naturally  when a BJs was opening in my town  I was eager to become a regular patron. Sadly  I don't think that will be happening anytime soon. I have been there about 4 times since they opened  and all four times  I swore I wouldn't go back. Here's why:1. Service has been pretty bad every time. It takes forever for servers to notice you  to check up on you  to bring your food  and to bring your check. The servers are nice and polite  but very slow and not very attentive. In one visit  I was at the bar and ordered a soda. It took about 10 minutes before I could get the bartender's attention to remind her that she never brought out my soda. 2. The food is not very good  or cooked correctly. I ordered a chicken Marsala  the chicken was great  the pasta was undercooked. The server offered to send it back  and I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza to replace it. The pizza took way too long to come out (I was on my lunch break from work) and when it did  the cooks forgot to put BBQ sauce on my pizza. Since I didn't have time to wait for another meal to be cooked  I just asked for sauce in a cup  and poured it on top and ate it that way. Other food I have ordered has been cold  undercooked  or just incorrect as well. The last time I went  I just had drinks  because I didn't want to gamble on the food. 3. Parking. They do not validate  which is a big deal since Paseo costs $9.00 to park. Of course  when I ask about validation  the servers have suggested that I just go get validated at Gelsons or Macy's. maybe I'm just old-fashioned  but having an employee tell me to validate at another store without actually shopping there sounds pretty unprofessional to me.I like BJs  I really do  but this location is just poorly managed. It's too bad  because the location and the layout are amazing. They have the biggest TV I have ever seen in the bar  and the old building is gorgeous. But if I want to eat at BJs  I think I'll just trek down to Burbank or Monrovia instead of walking to this location. It will be worth the drive.
Nikolas H.,South Pasadena  CA,0,28,,6/24/2014,5.0,Stopped by for a quick dinner. Had a great server named Sarah. The corn fritters are the best. Can eat them all day. Cynthia the manager recognized me as a regular customer and stopped by to make sure everything was great. Love the big TV with world cup on. Service was excellent.
Vvn W.,Van Nuys  CA,63,546,30,11/23/2012,3.0,This BJ's is brand spanking new. When I first came here for dinner  it couldn't be more than 1 week old. While I like the new restaurant smell  I anticipated a few wrinkles to be ironed out.Both the location and the interior were amazing. It can't be better located on the busy Colorado Blvd. and the interior reminded me of a neo-classic banking institution. It was very clean and ultra busy.While the food and service were good  I can't help but noticed a whole rash of servers in training...I mean they were everywhere! They all gathered in one spot  which was very odd. There were way many more servers than there were customers. I sat at the main aisle and it was busy from the time I sat down to the time I left. In fact I couldn't avoid being sideswiped even if I tried.I had the fish n' chips that night and although I really like the huge flaky pieces of white fish  the beer batter itself was pretty greasy and too much. The batter almost distracted the taste of the fish itself. The fries that came with the entree tasted frozen. The service that night was just okay but I had trouble keeping track of who our main server was since different people arrived at the table bringing food  filling up water glasses  and bringing the bill.Overall it's not a bad place; in fact it can be the place to meet up with friends or just to hang out. BJ's needs to work out a few kinks.
Jaime E.,Sacramento  CA,47,44,,7/27/2014,3.0,The building is really nice and the food was ok. Service was a bit slow and it wasn't even full. The food at the BJs in Huntington Beach is much better than this one in my opinion. The thing that turned me off the most is that they don't validate parking even though the structure is above the garage. I'll just stick going to the Arcadia location or a different one. If I do come here I'll just come much earlier when the mall is open so I can validate my parking pass at Macy's. lol
Kelsey K.,Simi Valley  CA,60,11,9,6/8/2014,5.0,Love avocado egg roles yummy :) also the strawberry splash tastes like candy! So good! Waiter was attentive nice personable :)
V. S.,Pasadena  CA,27,75,21,9/19/2014,5.0,Hands down - best BJs. The space is in the historic jewelry mart. I love sitting in the center of the room in the bar area  even when I am there for dinner because the ceiling is an experience it itself. This is also a great place to watch a game because they have a huge screen with a gorgeous wooden mantle around it with alcohol bottles displayed. I always recommend this location to friends and family. I like the large bathroom with lots of stalls. Too bad the restaurant doesn't validate for parking at Paseo. I will be back!
Gerald W.,Burbank  CA,21,157,23,9/16/2014,3.0,Typical bj's the service was a little on the slow side I will admit  but not horrible.
Henry F.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,6,69,315,9/13/2014,2.0,I go to BJ's all the time and love there food and tech products. However  this BJ is just bad I like to find the good in a business and I just can't find it in this location!!! The service is horrible from the hostess to our server. I gave it a two star because the food was good when it got to the table about 40 min after we were seated. I gave three different employees my loyalty number and never got it recorded until I pushed them to pay online. The manager did give us a free salad because it was never made until we asked about it.
Elizabeth U.,South Pasadena  CA,17,19,3,2/19/2014,1.0,"So this is going to be lengthy  but I have to say something. I made a reservation here for my birthday last week for a party of 16  Sunday night at 6 o\'clock. I was really excited to try BJ\'s for the first time because I had heard so many great things  but unfortunately my visit wasn\'t as great as others\'. Let me just start by saying that the location is great  and the restaurant itself is beautiful  and designed very well. There is a great selection of beers on the menu also  but the service is a complete and utter disaster. Our server was very nice at first  and took all of our orders accordingly  however  for some of the orders he didn\'t write a single word down. We waited about twenty minutes before getting our drinks  but that\'s not even where it gets bad. A single food runner comes waking around with a burger that has NOTHING on it. Just a patty between two buns and starts going person to person asking who ordered it. Shocking  no one ordered that. So she goes back. She comes back two minutes later with the same burger  and again  goes person to person asking who ordered that same burger. Again  no one claimed it. So at this point it had breached half an hour and no one had gotten their food yet. The restaurant wasn\'t even that packed  so why was the food taking so long to begin with?So finally  our food starts to come out  however  the food is coming out one single order at a time. So basically  another 20 minutes goes by before only three people have their food at the table. As if this night couldn\'t get any worse  all of our orders went back to the kitchen at least three times because they were all wrong. Need I remind you  we are not a very tough crowd to please. Fries were cold  burgers were made wrong  burgers came out without lettuce on them  and meat wasn\'t cooked right. The meat was either way too raw  or completely burnt to crisp. So finally after we had complained a few times  the manager came to visit our table. He was very nice  and very understanding  but he didn\'t do much to mend the fact that my birthday dinner has now gone to total crap. Everyone was completely unhappy. I felt the worst for my brother. He ordered a burger  and on the picture it showed bacon  cheese  tomato  lettuce and meat. It looked like a pretty good burger. However  when he finally got his burger  it had absolutely nothing on it. Not even lettuce. And the manager proceeded to ask him if he asked for lettuce on the burger in the first place. On the description it even says it comes with lettuce! Are you kidding me?! So my brother points out the picture and says  ""I\'m sorry  I thought I ordered that burger."" The manager then tells him that the burger isn\'t properly shown in the picture. That he would have to ask for all the extras on the burger in the first place. So eventually  my brother just sucked it up and ate his completely bland and burnt burger. At the end of the night the manager did say that all the burgers that were returned to the kitchen were going to be on him. Coincidentally  that was more than half the burgers that were ordered that night. He also gave us all a coupon for a free Pizookie anytime we wanted to return to any other BJ\'s. I highly doubt that any of us will return again. In summation  and without exaggeration  this probably had to be the worst dinner and the worst service that I have ever had in my life. Most of us didn\'t even finish our food  and we didn\'t ask for boxes to take home either. I really wish that my first experience was better  and I wish that it hadn\'t been on my birthday. It was just horrible."
Charity G.,Shadow Hills  CA,4,23,8,10/29/2012,4.0,I'm guilty of frequenting this place. I'm on day 3 of my pizzokie and beer diet.Here's the low down:1. Servers are still on training. This explains why they are super chipper and their timing is still off (ex: giving the menu and as when she pulls her hand from the menu asks our table if we already know what we want; puts pizza down the table and asks us right away if we're enjoying the pizza; the spoon is literally halfway between the soup bowl and my mouth and the server asks me if i'm still working on my soup). Give it another week and the seasoned servers will leave the new ones to swim and float on their own.2. Food is consistent in quality. I can't complain with that.3. Place seems oddly louder than what it should be. It's prolly because of the super high ceiling.4. Tables and booths are pretty crammed next to each other... which means to say you'll be passing by most people when you enter/ leave.5. Great lunch menu. They have unlimited soup and salad for $7! Order your next soup of liking when they give you your desired first soup for perfect timing. Their tomato bisque is where it's at.6. Iced tea is $2.75. Draft beer during lunch is $3.50. You bet I'm not ordering iced tea. 7. Yes  they validate parking.
Bus G.,Los Angeles  CA,0,25,,6/11/2015,1.0,What has happened to bjs? I used to go all the time my fav place now it sucks. Tonight all my favorite dishes where no longer on the menu wtf? I ordered appetizers mushrooms were cold and not cooked. Reordered a new one and still not cocked and flavorless. Tortilla soup was good but drink (Long Island)!was horrible no taste. Fish tacos were dry so i didn't eat most and ordered a pizza. Can't go wrong with pizza. Waiter was horrible waited forever for service and check which was incorrect 3 times. Charged for bad mushrooms twice and didn't give us a discount. Will never go back to my once favorite place . At least not to pasadena. And one more thing you don't validate wtf? People have to park but you don't validate? Why would anything want to come there? Management needs to be fired as this location is a dud.
Edwin H.,Glendale  CA,0,7,,6/17/2015,1.0,You don't have to be in the restaurant business to know this place is severely understaffed and mismanaged. Went there on a Sunday (only 10 minute wait to get seated...which usually means not super busy) with the NBA finals game on their TV's. We sat towards the back of the restaurant and after waiting 10-15 to even get acknowledged  I figured out the waiter (who seemed overwhelmed and over his head) had about 12 tables to tend to by himself. So I spent the rest of the time there convincing myself that it was not his (Nicholas) fault and it was the management that didn't care about customers.1) ordered drinks and appetizers and kids food.2) Appetizers showed up  but we had no plates or forks/ napkins3) asked for them  and he apologized and said he would get them right away.4) Kids meals showed up 5-10 minutes later  but we still had no napkins/ forks. More apologies.5) Finally done eating  he asked if we wanted anything else and I ordered a Pizooki that the kids had been looking forward to since we got there.6) 15 minutes later  he walked up to our table with our check. I asked about the Pizooki  and he seemed baffled and surprised that we had not received it yet.7) After checking the register  he apologized and said it was never ordered. Since it was past kids bed time  we asked him not to bother and paid and left. I think there was one more apology! I looked on the receipt to see if I could take a survey or something about our experience  but they are smart enough not to give you that option!!The one star I gave them was for the dcor and the awesome ceiling. So if you want to see nice architecture and an amazing ceiling  this is the place for you.I apologize if you find this review not to you liking. I promise to do better next time!I sincerely apologize.
Victor C.,Pasadena  CA,207,180,681,5/4/2013,3.0,"BJ\'s Pasadena location very unique. High ceilings and 150"" Panasonic TV... The food is ok. Nothing great. The appetizers are bland and taste like they had been warmed over. I would rate it 2 stars  but our server was very attentive. Also  the ac blows pretty good in many places  and it can get very loud with the stone floors and solid walls. The beer selection is good  but nothing out fo the ordinary. For a great beer selection Yard House or Slater\'s 50/50."
Cheryl V.,Los Angeles  CA,158,192,,6/3/2013,4.0,"I\'ve been to a number of BJ\'s restaurants in Southern California  but the husband and I decided it was time to go to the one in Pasadena  since we recently moved to the neighborhood. They don\'t serve my favorite kind of pizza  or beer  or have the best service of any pizza restaurant I\'ve been to  but their food is consistent  so when I\'m craving a bready pizza with no frills and a glass of wine  it\'s a place to consider.Now  BJ\'s has more on its menu than pizza and beer. They have salads and pastas and flatbreads and appetizers (wings  bruschetta  etc.). They also have a sports bar atmosphere. Because we were searching for late night happy hour  we ended up at BJs. Parking is either in the garage below or street parking (we found a spot on the street nearby  probably because it was so late and on a Sunday).Everything we ordered was off of the happy-hour menu -- featuring ""happy hour-sized"" food. Wings  deep dish pizza  spinach and artichoke dip  and sliders. Everything tasted great and was exactly what we were hoping for. The beer is cold and the wine is good (and cheap.... $6 for a glass of La Crema Pinot Noir). The service was also friendly and fast.I love the ambience in this place... I wonder what used to be in this space before this pizza chain took over. Will go back!"
Pettra T.,Los Angeles  CA,337,180,27,9/15/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Disappointed again ....tried to order the new steak  sold out. Tried to downgrade to the rib eye  sold out. #boooo
Jonathan P.,Los Angeles  CA,448,184,91,1/24/2013,3.0,This is the newest BJ's I've been to  I think it's only been around for like barely a year. I could definitely tell in the food. Sometimes it takes a while for a spot to get in it's groove  I could say the same about the one in La Puente. Early on  it had it's issues  so maybe in time this one will improve also.The pizza we had was ok  hard to mess up too much  but it was lacking a bit in the toppings department. The hot wings came out a little soggy. Maybe I should have requested extra crispy. But  the beer  as always  delightful. I'm a big fan of the Piranha Pale Ale  crisp with a hoppy floral finish!The biggest problem we had was that there were these gnats lingering around the taps. The bartender said that they were coming from the drains. That's pretty disgusting and annoying. They need to do something about those drains!
Brandi P.,Pasadena  CA,0,4,,11/29/2015,1.0,My service tonight was horrible! I waited 20 minutes for cold food!! The horrible waitress  Rebecca  stated that the kitchen was backed up & our food would be out shortly. I was understanding until I waited close to 20 minutes & our food came out cold!!! Also  I witnessed others people food coming out ASAP that arrived after I did! Not to mention  that the food was delivered by Rebecca ~ herself! I also witnessed someone who looked like a manager visiting other tables  glance at me  & turn around & walk away!! I can only accept the fact that our food sat somewhere as she helped others!!!! I will never visit BJ's again!!!!! I wish I could give this place 0 stars!
James S.,Los Angeles  CA,561,1194,627,11/4/2012,4.0,"Possibly my favorite BJ\'s of them allIt is practically in my backyardUsually  I rank chains at a 1-3 star rating because each one of them can\'t really separate themselves that much for me to think they are better than 3 stars if they are top notch. This place is an exception even though it is only one star higher I would give any other chainThe location This BJ\'s is quite large and it ended up moving into a bank and a jewelry store. Most of the molding is all original. The staff mentioned that some had to retouched. Fun fact is that the bank vault is located below the bar. The staff is pretty cooli came on the first day of operation and offered a couple slices of pizza from a server walking the grounds. SWEET! My buddy and I hung out at the bar area chatting it up with several of the bartenders who were them awesome. Even though we pretty much became the best of friends with each one of them  they were still well aware of the other patrons running dry of booze running whole length of the bar. That is top notch service!Would I be back?Yes  I will be DUKE!Like the great Richard Marx said ""I\'ll be right here waiting for you""youtube.com/watch?v=S_E2"
Rick W.,Los Angeles  CA,343,81,63,2/27/2013,3.0,Recently visited this location for lunch  during the week; I would imagine on the weekend and in the evening  it gets very busy. Parking is NOT validated by BJ's  as they are not part of the Paseo Colorado group  regardless of the fact that they are physically IN the complex  but whatever. Helpful tip: If you go around the corner to Gelson's grocery store  they have a self validation machine near the entrance; problem solved; not sure what the deal is with BJ's not being a part of the whole thing.During lunch (late lunch)  the place was really empty  which is what I prefer  since BJ's in general tends to get really loud and douchey at night or when a sports event is on. No thanks; I like to be able to hear my meal conversations!I had a salad (and have had tons of other items at other BJ's locations)  and the quality was just as I've come to expect from this chain - solid and tasty. No complaints from me food-wise.The service was a tad slow and toward the end of our lunch  our waiter was pretty much non-existent; maybe he fell asleep somewhere waiting for more customers to show up. That was annoying  but when he DID come to the table  he was pleasant.Not sure what the building originally was  but the interior of this location is much different than other BJ's. It must have been a bank or old hotel lobby or something - uber-vaulted ceiling and architecture definitely NOT the norm for this restaurant chain. We liked it  and likely will return again  as BJ's is always a decent go-to.Three stars because I had to get my parking stub validated elsewhere  which was inconvenient and lame.
Mohamad T.,Upland  CA,2,16,1,9/14/2014,4.0,Tonight was a rough night at the Pasadena BJ's. I will spare you the Details of the troubles and give big props for the manager Ashley who did not try to deny the issues and recognized the need to solve them. Then Christianne came over and really made us feel like they knew the issues and were working hard to get everything right. We left thinking that the place is in the right hands. Every place has a bad night  but it is the management that determines if it is consistently bad  or if the place is moving things forward in a positive direction. All in all I think Ashley and Christiianne are committed to making this Bj's live up to the reputation of the others. Good work ladies!!!!   We'll be back.
Madalena T.,Los Angeles  CA,14,144,307,6/24/2014,4.0,My favorite thing to order here is their California burger. This burger is in my top 3 list of best burgers I've ever had. I like how they toast the sourdough bread and stuff this burger with avacados  green chilies  pepper jack cheese  and chipotle mayonnaise. Soo flavorful with each bite. And it comes with a side of their amazing potato wedges. Add a glass of their Jeremiah Red Ale on tap and you've got the perfect meal! I like going to BJ's and sitting in their bar area to eat  drink  and watch Monday Night Football or other sports.
Imran S.,Queens  NY,59,113,47,3/28/2014,4.0,Chain restaurants usually have standards set that needs to be held and for as long as they uphold it then I have no problems with the place whatsoever. This was an even better looking restaurant than the ones in the OC. Nice warm ambience  surprisingly great decor  and service was superb. The food tasted great as always. The best part is dessert and of course; the infamous Pazookie! Order a small for taste appreciation and portion control ; it's rich and tasty so savor that last taste on your palate. Great spot to go with the family and / or friends.
Trevor W.,Los Angeles  CA,227,174,19,1/5/2013,4.0,This place may be billed as a deep dish pizza and brewhouse bar/restaurant  but the fact of the matter is you go for one reason  the pizookie. Literally  the best dessert ever. Yeah  you may go for dinner first and it will be all right  but leave space for dessert. I'm pretty sure the Pizookie fell from heaven it's so good. It's simple really: a mini deep dish pizza tin that they bake a peanut butter cookie in and drop 2 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream on top of it. It comes out piping hot and still soft. Soooo good. Even better  if you want to feed a group  they do giant pizookies as well for a very good price.If you're looking to watch the game  you'll find plenty of tv's in the bar of this beautiful space  I'm pretty sure this was a bank in a prior incarnation and honestly  it's way too nice for a BJ's but it's better than a vacancy.
Ashley B.,San Diego  CA,40,18,,2/24/2013,2.0,This is by far the worst BJ's I have ever eaten at. The kitchen staff needs a serious upgrade. Food 1 star.Service was ok  therefore I rated them a 2 starWedge cut fries were the best part of the meal....
Aidyn K.,Alhambra  CA,78,60,4,7/1/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Manager called and apologized. He said he would send me a gift certificate to compensate the meal. Three weeks has gone by and I've received nothing in the mail. Don't trust any of the staff at this place.
O. A.,South Pasadena  CA,6,44,51,8/4/2014,3.0,My son loves coming here  but he's 15 yrs old. The ambiance is young  loud  and busy. The food is OK  not great  not bad either. The service is what needs work. The servers have enormous serving sections and don't have a chance to check-in with us customers very often. They should hire more servers. I don't recommend you go here if you're in a hurry to catch a movie.
Peter F.,Los Angeles  CA,1,5,2,10/5/2014,2.0,Frustrating I asked for medium well and I got a microwaved patty it was rubbery and dry it tasted like a burger king burger. It was thrown together quickly cost me 9 odd. It made me wait for a stale microwave burger. What the fuck. How fucking dare you. Staff was courteous  excellent and kind :)
David T.,Burbank  CA,78,327,5,11/12/2012,4.0,I went here a few weeks ago  probably after they just opened. Food was good and all  but what stood out in this location was how many servers they had! I'm guess that there were many still in training  largely due to the fact that the one that served us was being supervised. It's not every dinner night when there are people constantly walking by our table  at about the rate of one person every couple seconds.The location of this restaurant is great and the interior is large and bright. And everything went smoothly here.I'd gladly eat here again.
Yadi R.,Los Angeles  CA,0,7,,12/28/2014,1.0,Our food took too long to arrive and by the time it did arrive we could tell it was just sitting in the kitchen because it was cold. A bummer when you order pizza  wings and sliders with fries. At first we were forgiving because it was only 2 waiters in the bar area and it seemed like a busy night  but after the server forgot my water and forgot to put in our beer and dessert orders we are convinced it's the server. I like BJ's and I'll be avoiding this location from now on.
cat c.,Pasadena  CA,9,106,,12/17/2012,4.0,Yeah it's a chain  but the foremost reason for visiting BJ's in Pasadena is the gorgeous historic building  the 1924 Curlett and Beelman Security 1st National Bank designed in the Renaissance Revival style. (If you love historic buildings  check out Beelman's art deco style architecture in downtown L.A.  such as the Eastern Columbia building on 9th and Broadway.) While you're eating  look up and look down. Many of the interior elements are preserved  including the marble floors  columns  friezes  etc. Spectacular.And the food is good for a chain. When I visited  I had the balsamic glazed chicken and a couple of nicely-concocted drinks from the bar. Our server was excellent and let us linger and chat. I appreciate that BJ's is OK with lingering. We're not allowed to linger enough at restaurants anymore.Bottom line: visit the restaurant because the food is good but  more importantly  visit the 1924 celebrity building in which BJ's is housed.
Dennis M.,Los Angeles  CA,71,41,,12/10/2012,4.0,The atmosphere was amazing. Very comfortable booths and a bunch of TV's everywhere. Plus the biggest TV on the west Coast! They have a huge menu so you are bound to find something you like... Service was prompt and food was quick.
M M.,Pasadena  CA,0,7,,9/13/2014,1.0,Extremely slow service. Wait staff very inattentive and food was sub par and overpriced. Definitely avoid on a Saturday night.
Raquel L.,West Covina  CA,25,95,6,11/8/2012,4.0,I'm just happy that there is a BJ's close to my house! yay! I thought it was a Loehmann's before?Pros: food is always good  decent prices  beer  several TV's  and great costumer service. When I walked in I was greeted by the hosts then our waitress (forget her name) was wonderful. Very attentive.Con's: Its too bright in the bar area...dim the lights a tad!tip: they do not validate there are now validation stations for the Paseo in general at the top of the escalators.Restaurant will no longer validate. street parking is $1.25 and one hour parking then free after 8 p.m
Lanise J.,Altadena  CA,23,87,141,1/12/2014,2.0,I went Saturday with a friend for happy hour. All I can really say is that the service sucked!!!! we sat in the bar area and had a great view of the big screen. Tell me why it took an hour plus for me to get sliders  while my friend was able to enjoy her food. The waitress didn't even offer to take it off our bill or give us a free desert. People please work on your customer service skills!!!!!!!!!
Miss J.,Los Angeles  CA,0,42,6,5/26/2014,2.0,It's so unfortunate that the food at this location was horrible. I ordered a deep dish pizza and it came out mushy  had no crisp to it and tastes just bad. This is not the BJs that I remembered. Sad to say but I don't think I'm ever going back to any BJs again. I paid $20 for a medium  8 slice pizza...so not worth it.
Pokemon P.,Los Angeles  CA,73,351,375,12/8/2012,4.0,Love the new location!Conveniently located the heart of Old Town Pasadena. Great walking distance from the Arclight theatre. Perfect place to hang after the movie. A+++ on the Skirt Steak & Bleu Cheese flat bread pizza.Service was great and quick! Food was served hot.Great interior! I'm glad they kept the interior architecture of the old bank decor design. Colorful bar all the liquors you can think of it is on the wall. Giant TV screen!Price was reasonable  but of course could be better  if they listed the beer price on the menu.
Bud M.,Los Angeles  CA,612,11,1,12/5/2012,4.0,This place is beautiful! It used to be a bank and/or a jewelry store or something  so the interior is really nice. It looks like Caesar's Palace in there! Plus  they have a huge selection of taps  unlike many other BJ's  which usually only served their own beer on tap (unless they've changed since I've worked there).It gets 4 stars because it is BJ's  not Mastro's or Ruth's Chris.  I can't go around giving 5 stars to every restaurant with nice interior I see. :-)
Michael R.,Cerritos  CA,1,4,,8/4/2014,1.0,Took a long while for my Mac n cheese to come out and when it came it was cold. I was really hungry and did not want to wait any longer so I just ate. Maybe this place is better during the day I don't know.
harry t.,Redwood City  CA,14,29,5,11/29/2012,5.0,Went for the 2nd time to this new location last night. Fish n Chips came over-fried. When I asked for a do-over  the manager came and apologized and had it resent. Did not make me feel bad...brought out a new one that was delicious.PIzza is always good.
Apple S.,Pasadena  CA,22,22,5,1/16/2013,2.0,I've been going to BJ's for many years. I even worked there for 4 years a while back. This location is brand new and left a bad taste in my mouth  literally. The spinach artichoke dip  which I hadn't ordered in years  was bland. I don't know if they've changed that recipe or what. I ordered the Classic Burger  medium. It came out well-done and hardly had enough thousand island dressing to make up for the loss in juiciness and flavor in the charred meat.I don't send food back. I just live and learn  meaning  I won't come here for a burger  again.I'm glad they still have the wedge cut fries. Those are good. And I'm glad they don't do the 13 steps of service they used to do. However  I think their food has gone downhill. Either that or my taste buds have matured in the past 14 years.
Baron V.,Los Angeles  CA,0,43,4,7/25/2015,2.0,Meh....kinda place that seems like it should be better than it is. Calamari appetizers were terrible. Hot wings look like they had been boiled and drizzled with tabasco sauce. Potato skins did not look appetizing. Same goes for onion strings....the food was salty (so you buy more drinks!). Couldn't finish my guacamole burger and that should not happen! Oh and they don't validate for parking at Paseo. Better off going to the Yardhouse or even TGI Fridays!
Natalie L.,Woodland Hills  CA,19,280,,4/5/2014,2.0,I know that this is a chain and I didn't have high expectations  but man the food was not good. I had a horribly overdressed salad. Hubby had a way salty burger ... and believe me  the temptation to make jokes about salty food from a place called BJs is near overwhelming. But I will manage to restrain myself. Although our server was friendly  we got the wrong fries with the burger. If we lived in the area  this would be a place to grab a beer after work and that's about it.
Antonio G.,Chatsworth  CA,76,272,259,12/8/2013,3.0,Another place where you'll find me when in town   walking distance from the convention center and after a long working day  nothing tadte better than thier beer and deep pizza
Rocky E.,Pasadena  CA,0,2,,8/21/2015,4.0,Good food. Okay service that doesn't really care about your needs.
Angie L.,Los Angeles  CA,144,34,8,2/20/2014,1.0,My server was caralina. Very hard to locate. Also my husband ordered a steak well done. It came out medium. When we showed her the steak  her response was that she would take care of it. Well she took care of it by doing nothing!
Stacy P.,Burbank  CA,2,60,6,12/5/2013,1.0,The food was horrible  salty and not to mention it took over 30 minutes for the food to come out. I placed an order for pazooki well in advance and waited another 20 minutes and then we decided to just walk out of this restuarant since we were sick of waiting. THEY DONT EVEN VALIDATE!!!!!!
Ashley H.,Pasadena  CA,1,1,,1/15/2015,1.0,Terrible experience. Went in the mid afternoon of a weekday  took 10 minutes to get a glass of water  which had ice  after specifically asking for none. The slow service and mistakes continued  even with a mostly empty restaurant  and we left without eating  when both of our entrees finally showed up  wrong. If they can't get it right when business is slow  going while busy must be a horrific experience.
Anni K.,Pasadena  Los Angeles  CA,3,26,2,4/10/2014,4.0,Always have great service and great quality food! Must try the avocado eggs rolls  stuffed mushrooms and Santa Fe salad! The BEST!! But one time I found a hair in my food  but the waitress was nice enough to take if back and Comped the order! But other then that one experience they have great customer service and fast pick up service too!
Marshal A.,Hawthorne  CA,80,6,,11/12/2012,3.0,This is the fanciest BJ's I've ever been to. I guess  I was too used to the one in Westwood.Went on a Monday night around 730pm and it was busy. MNF was playing and it was an hour + wait so we found a table around the bar area. The server was polite and for the most part  attentive to our table. All of the food we ordered did not come out at the same time...a couple of items were 10 mins behind the rest (we were a group of 5).I'm mainly giving this place a 3 Star because the BBQ Chicken Pizza (which is a staple for me) was not up to par. Not only was the chicken was dry  but the BBQ sauce was too...is that possible? Apparently so. Not to mention the crust was unevenly cooked.I'll go back at some time and give this place another shot. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that this new place is working out all its kinks.
Vivianne M.,Pasadena  CA,0,34,1,1/12/2013,1.0,Subpar-I have been to several BJ'S (Huntington Beach  Arcadia  Burbank  etc.)  but this location is lacking in quality and service. I went twice  once for lunch and yesterday for dinner. I really want to like this BJ's  but both times have been a disappointment. The building is stunning and lovely  however the food is just terrible. While it's nice to sit in  what's the point of a restaurant having a beautiful atmosphere if the food sucks?! My pizza was undercooked  then they forgot to put bacon on my husband's bacon cheeseburger. When we told the server  he was not trained well and did not know what to do. Then  he brought out two small pieces of bacon. That said  the real disappointment lies with the chief and kitchen. The burger even itself  tasted terrible...it was way over-cooked...tasted burnt. In addition  the staff seem overwhelmed and a bit snobby.
Kevin T.,La Crescenta-Montrose  CA,1,3,,7/17/2013,1.0,Lets start from the beginning. Walked in and there wasn't a host at the front for a few minutes. Finally had gotten seated at a table when a booth was requested. Not a big deal I didn't want to request it again. First server comes and takes drink orders and 15 minutes passes by waiting to order our food and finally a DIFFERENT server notices and takes our order (thank you Alicia). And then we waited a little over half an hour for the food and when it finally arrived it wasn't even warm!On our way out we were waiting at the front with a few other groups of people while there was  again  no host there. And after a few minutes of waiting and nobody noticing the front  we were informed that they don't validate for the parking right next to the restaurant.This is by far the worst BJ's I've ever been to. The only good part about this lunch was our 2nd server.The table next to us complained to the manager about the same problems. Such a shame and waste of a really nice venue.
Mark G.,Pasadena  CA,32,225,829,3/6/2015,2.0,Came here Tuesday night for a going away party for someone. I was the first one to show up so I sat at the bar and ordered a Hop Storm IPA. Their IPA was very good and the bartender behind the bar was great. I was impressed with the extremely large TV and the layout of the restaurant. They did a great job restoring the inside of the former old bank building. What I was not impressed with was their deep dish pizza. A friend of mine order a happy hour appetizer Avocado Egg Rolls. These were excellent but the pizza not as good. We order a medium deep dish BJ's Favorite. Way to greasy on the bottom. Swimming in grease. The taste of the pizza was good and so was the crispness of the outer & bottom pizza crust but therein lies the problem and where all the grease was. Will I be back? Yes  Their happy hour prices on their beer & drinks were good and the next time I come I will try a couple of other less greasy food items.
L C.,South Pasadena  CA,2,16,19,12/2/2013,4.0,Deep dish pizza is good. Spinach stuffed mushroom is yummy. Not recommend their steak though. We came on Saturday  and took about 35 min wait to be seated. Food is delivered on right time. Not too late. Remember  They didnt validate the parking from Paseo Colorado and end up we paid $6 for parking.
Ivonne L.,Baldwin Park  CA,25,15,2,4/22/2014,2.0,I was in the Pasadena area and decided to stop by and have dinner with my mother and sister. (We usually go to the BJ's in Covina). Let me tell you...I was really disappointed! We were seated right away but waited about 10 minutes for someone to help us out or even offer us a glass of water. To top it off  the restaurant was EMPTY so I'm not sure why they took so long to help us out. I ordered Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo. Pasta was hard  chewy and no flavor. I've never experienced this at BJ's in Covina. I will definitely not return to the restaurant in Pasadena.
Duvel R.,Los Angeles  CA,5,117,4,8/22/2013,1.0,Walked in @ 5:06... beer was served at 5:56... no joke! But wait  it gets better! Ordered wings with fries  and was brought 2 orders of wings instead  lol. There's MORE! When they brought the fries  they were the wrong fries  not seasoned as I had ordered  lol. Beer was good  and Mojito was great too! I guess if you don't mind waiting  and reminding them of what you ordered it's a pretty great place for happy hour. I waited an hour to get happy... so can you!
Diana B.,San Gabriel  CA,3,82,7,4/9/2015,2.0,"I was disappointed  because we always have such a great experience at the BJs on Huntington. But the service was off; the hostess said things like ""we\'re not taking names for tables "" but didn\'t explain what that meant; do i seat myself or go to the bar? Finally we got seated --because there were ten tables open-- but had to flag the wait staff after waiting too long.  My ahi salad was tasty though. And we got to watch the game  which for us was fun but know that there is a huge screen over the bar--in case you\'re not in to sports you might be annoyed. I did like the space and will try it again and re post if service improves."
Bryan P.,Pasadena  CA,13,19,6,5/10/2015,2.0,"Out of all of the family friendly chain restaurants  I prefer BJ\'s over the rest. I go there ""often""....like once every couple months. Love the fact that they brew their own beer. However on this particular visit  I was beyond disappointed. after waiting for nearly 20 minutes for a table  the server was quick with the drink orders and we ordered a kids meal right away and also calamari. The calamari was over cooked  rubbery  and really still dripping in grease and very much clumped together. Kids corn dog bites weren\'t horrible....but definitely frozen from a box...I kind of expected different. After seeing our waitress walk by several times I finally asked for some small bread plates for us to share the calamari......and clearly  with empty soda glasses on our table I kinda expected to get refills.....but I finally had to ask for refills. which were quickly brought. Our waitress never checked on our satisfaction of the calamari  or the kids meal. we finished the app and stacked the dishes on the large plate and put it on the edge of the table. After about 20 minutes...seriously 20 minutes.....I made eye contact with the waitress  who I hadn\'t talked to since the soda refills  who came over and asked if everything was OK. I told her that our party of 3 were still waiting on entrees. She said ""oh they\'ll be out soon"". meanwhile the 6top next to us had gotten there after us and got their food first. That\'s unacceptable. So..after being seated for nearly an hour...I see our food being taken out of the kitchen......to the wrong table. Well....with a fussy 2 year old AND a new baby  and a long wait for lackluster food and just below mediocre service  I requested to-go boxes and the check. I don\'t usually  but this time I had to notify the manager. He was accommodating and understanding. He comped our entrees. That was nice. but I expected that after the experience we just had. will we go back.......probably in a few months after this bad taste leaves my mouth  because microwaved ribs and soggy fries are not eat I wanted to eat tonight.....and as we walked out  the calamari plate was still sitting on the table and not a single thing had been bussed."
Jenny V.,Pasadena  CA,1,11,6,4/30/2014,1.0,Wow what a huge disappointment. This place is a nightmare. The minute u walk in the hostess does not even greet u. The food was horrific. My Salmon was burned and our salad was so tasteless. We left this place hungry and with a really bad taste in our mouths... literally. Never coming back. Not to mentioned the service was also terrible. They ruined our dinner date.
Briana A.,Pasadena  CA,101,9,5,10/12/2015,2.0,In the past few months I have come to this location consistently and each and every time the service has been horrible. To begin with it has taken at least 10 minutes for a server to approach our table and ask for our drink menus so long that by the time they get there we are past ready to order our drinks and food then once we do put that order in it takes another 5-10 minutes for us to get our drink orders and today it took about 40 minutes or more for us to get our food (I timed it)  a sandwich and a mini pizza and to top it off I can count on one hand the amount of time our server came to the table to check on us and to refill our drinks a service we had to ask for. Now I myself am a server and I understand the demands of the job and I would understand if the place was busy but it was a slow Monday night and it has been slow the past times I've come and received the same type of service. If you want good service this is not the place to come.
Paige G.,Sierra Madre  CA,1,5,3,4/3/2015,2.0,"So it\'s says it\'s closed today which it is not because I\'ve been waiting here an hour for my food. First  we arrived and were told it was open seating. We proceeded to wander around amongst dirty tables until we finally found a clean one in the corner. We had three separate waiters come up to ask if we\'d been helped before we were relocated to a different booth so that we could ""get the attention we deserved."" Not quite... We\'re still waiting  and this is already the second chance we\'ve given to this restaurant after a previous experience with a rude waiter."
Maggie M.,Los Angeles  CA,8,35,8,1/7/2014,5.0,Everyone is very friendly  love their flatbreads and light beer. I had never paid attention on their very nice ceilings until this past week I was there ! It made me feel like I was in this Fancy hotel in Vegas or something. .. the only thing they dont do is Parking Validation which I think should be done by them. ..
Adam C.,Los Angeles  CA,60,89,31,1/24/2014,4.0,Finally gave this gorgeous place a try. On a Wednesday night  I enjoyed sitting at their bar and sampling a few beers while snacking on their buffalo wings. Yes  service tends to be a little slow at times  but the menu is huge and the interior/location really appealed to me. If you're a beer person  try some of their various types!
Sharkbait O.,Buena Park  CA,50,19,12,9/12/2014,1.0,"Probably the worst experience I\'ve ever had at any BJ\'s. The server brought my wife her soup and salad combo and said she\'d be back to drop off utensils for our family. Needless to say after 5 minutes  soup was done and no utensils in sight. The server had passed by us several times while my wife was eating her soup. 5 more minutes pass  the server had passed by again several times again with no utensils. I asked another server for some utensils and he said he\'d get them right away. Our meals get dropped at the table and the first server finally brings utensils  commenting under her breath  ""aw  the food beat me out."" After we all finish our entrees  I paid and as my wife was putting some stuff back in her bag  a cockroach runs past her and she shrieks in horror and screams  ""cockroach!""  but our server says  ""oh  it was just a water bug."" Excuse me? I\'m fairly certain my wife knows what a cockroach looks like. Our food was on par with any other BJ\'s  but service at this one was deplorable. If there was a zero star option  it would be well deserved."
LifesTooShort L.,Altadena  CA,298,22,9,6/1/2013,3.0,Fantastic chicken sesame salad ever! Service was great too. The only thing I didn't like is that upon our arrival  there was nobody at the booth to greet us. We had to wait until someone finally arrived to seat us. When they arrived they didn't even acknowledge that we waited. Not very attentive. Our waitress on the other hand was very attentive!
bill m.,Pasadena  CA,0,82,14,7/9/2014,2.0,Went there right after they opened in Pasadena.. Chicken pasta was like it was made the day before....Since it was new the first time I went back a few months later. Small Chicken sandwich and wasn't fresh....This place just puts out mediocre food and their pricing is too high...Stick with Cheesecake Factory if you want consistently good food at a reasonable price. You may not pay much less at Cheesecake but the portions are larger and the quality is consistent.
Crystal K.,Los Angeles  CA,32,178,15,3/9/2013,4.0,Nothing too special to write. Service is nice. Sometimes the hosts/hostesses don't know what they're doing  like the time they sat my husband and I in a tiny booth when she clearly saw we had several shopping bags. (Um  where are they supposed to go?) Other than that  it's not a bad eatery.
Vinnie B.,San Diego  CA,9,3,,1/19/2014,4.0,The happy hour dishes are great price and very good. The wings are good  the beer is exceptional  and the massive tv puts this place a top the charts. Well done.
Peter D.,Pasadena  CA,1083,218,63,12/20/2012,2.0,My night to complain  mediocre food   warm beer and no validated parking thus $7.50 to watch 1/2 the game
Trisha C.,Pasadena  CA,1,2,,7/4/2014,2.0,I am a huge fan of BJs. I have been to many of their locations and always have a good experience. The service at the Pasadena location is horrendous. I also question their cleanliness. The bathrooms were extremely dirty which usually is a good indication on how the kitchen is kept. We waited ten minutes and no one came to offer us drinks or check on us. I had to get up and get us menus. Someone finally came and took our drink order but it took another 15 min to get our drinks. I was very disappointed with the service and I am not sure I will return to the Pasadena location. The dirty bathrooms alone were a huge turn off.
Tiffany R.,Altadena  CA,0,6,,3/22/2015,2.0,I have been a loyal BJs member for years! And they have changes the menu now... And not for the best. The portions are smaller and service was ok but I was less than impressed. :(
Andrew M.,South Pasadena  CA,19,3,,12/14/2013,2.0,The pasta was not good. I expected something better for the price. The fact they don't serve coke is also an issue.
Christine H.,Pasadena  CA,252,771,409,8/5/2013,3.0,Very nice building. One of the nicest buildings inside on Colorado. It reminded me of Grand Central Station how they have consolations on the ceiling. All was good but the pizza's just not the same anymore. I can totally tell the bread was pre-made. How can you pre-make a PAN PIZZA? The crust was very soft and not crunchy at all. This is not how I remember BJ's. There needs to be a crunch and softness to the crust. The only crunch was the sides because of the burnt cheese. The tomatoes were pretty salty too. I don't remember them being that salty. It's so sad to see old places change due to budgets and trying to make more money than last year. How about keep the same stuff because your place WAS bumpin' 10 years ago  not it has just fizzled down to being mediocre. :/ Anyways  if you want a quiet BJ's  this is it. That's about all the PRO I got. Oh and beer  specifically Pyramid  hasn't changed. Pyramid on tap will always be damn good. Maybe they should learn from them?
John E.,Pasadena  CA,206,9,9,12/26/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"Bj\'s brewhouse is reminiscent of my college days: a pretty good deep dish pizza  awesome happy hour prices  decent beer on tap  and prompt  friendly service  but apparently these are all things of the past. I\'m sad to have to write such a bad review at this location. Brief run-down:Food Quality = barely mediocreService = Inefficient and unsatisfactory; unfriendly hostsAmbiance = GreatLocation = inconvenient  but doableNow to the nitty gritty:HOSTESS/SEATING:My Friend Regina signs in for a table for 3 under ""Gina.\' The good: we\'re seated in 15 mins on a Wednesday night at 8:15pm. The bad  the hostess calls out repeatedly  ""Jenna  party of 3."" After 2 attempts of Gina correcting the hostess  the hostess insists that she is waiting for a party of 3 for Jenna  NOT GINA...minutes later and after Regina clarifies with another one of the hostess  GINA party of 3 is finally seated. TABLE/ORDER: 30 minutes after being seated  still no sign of a waiter/waitress. No on has come to check on our table or even provide water. Finally  we are able to flag down a waiter passing by  who graciously offered to take a drink order while he finds our waitress. Moments later  he lets us know he will actually be our server. (without having to say anything  clearly our waiter/waitress assigned to our section forgot about us). A few disappointing events to point out. It took 10 minutes for my beer to arrive after ordering  and probably would have been forgotten had we not asked another server passing by to check on our order. 1 out of 3 of the meals was served 15 minutes AFTER 2 of the entrees were brought out  that entree was a personal sized bbq chicken pizza that was served cold and dry. We went through the transition of 3 waiters in the 2 hour and 25 min time frame we were there  and really only waited on just shy one hour. SPEAKING TO THE MANAGER:Typically  I have always had a great dining experience at several Bj\'s locations. This was my first time dining at the Pasadena location  and I was so excited to bring some friends from work here. Sadly  I was embarrassed to have suggested this establishment  seeing how we had such poor service. I rarely ever make a complaint  but my friend felt that it was necessary we at least share our unsatisfactory dining experience with the manager. After a short 5 or so minute wait  we were approached by the manager  Eddie. I was curious to see how he would respond to the matter. We politely explained to him our disappointing and frustrating dining experience  from the point of check-in through paying the check. He listened with a seemingly attentive stance. We had already paid the bill  and he appreciated the feedback that we provided. He did  however  attempt to suggest that he would have comp\'d a portion of the bill  but after finding out the bill had already been paid for  he made no other attempt to help rectify their poor service and cold food being served. He did make a suggestion that if when we come back  to approach him and he would take care of us...Let\'s get real here  IF i were ever to come back  would he even remember who I was or what had happened...realistically  no. Personally  I think how he should have addressed the matter  was maybe provide a voucher/gift card to facilitate a return visit and a hopeful chance at better service being provided...OR at the very least  offer a complimentary dessert for the inconvenience. Instead  a quick thank you and a speedily exit on his behalf.I hope this review makes it to the appropriate staff  or even Eddie  the manager  to help re-train and/or provide better  quality customer service. Otherwise  Yard House is just a few feet away  customer service is WAAAAAY beyond better  the hostess and staff are incredibly friendly  AND has a much more palate  pleasing menu  along with a plethora of beer on tap."
Ryanne C.,Monrovia  CA,0,1,,3/8/2014,3.0,I love going to bjs usually but I had the worst experience I've ever had at this one. Our server made it seem like our table was an inconvenience to him. He took forever to bring us water and then our drink order. The food was still good but the service was horrible.
Brandon M.,Irvine  CA,830,101,14,8/5/2013,5.0,Had an amazing BBQ chopped chicken salad here around 5ish. Considering it was my first meal of the day  I was stoked that it came out fresh and quick. Paired with a Nit Wit whitbier - it made for the ideal meal. Service was great  and the ambiance in the restaurant was just as warm as the service. Thanks BJ's for yet another great time.
Emily R.,Alhambra  CA,1,55,11,1/17/2014,3.0,I like the location. It's nice to have a BJ's in Pasadena. The salads are always good and pretty big. The service was just okay. The waitress didn't really come to check on us and she sat us right by the front of the door so every time anyone left or came in we got a cold draft. And the restaurant wasn't busy she could have sat us elsewhere. Haven't been back in a while but I will if I get a craving.
Robert S.,NORTH HOLLYWOOD  CA,2,33,6,10/15/2013,4.0,The food is good. I love the interior of this location. I would give 5 star  but the service is super slow. We waited for like 40 minutes to get our soup and salad.
Vinnie M.,Pasadena  CA,62,11,1,1/15/2013,1.0,Our main course came before our appetizers because our waiter forgot to put in our order  his words. During our half an hour wait for appetizers the waiter didn't once stop to check up on us. Service needs major help here. No apologies from the staff at all.
Joybella M.,Elizabethton  TN,98,23,3,12/30/2013,3.0,Great happy hour special right now. 1/2 craft beer during an NFL game. Great selection of beer and drinks. Reasonable prices. Great service. It was really loud  but there were several games going on.
Johanna A.,Los Angeles  CA,81,169,19,5/4/2013,3.0,"GREAT decor. I wonder what it was before? It looks like an old school hotel or a bank. Nice touch! Well  it\'s a BJ\'s. Good quality food as always  but the service isn\'t great. Been here a few times already  but haven\'t found anyone who has looked happy. The biggest downside is that they don\'t know validate because they\'re not ""a part"" of Paseo. How in the hell. So  if you parked in one of the structures in the area  you have to walk to Gelson\'s (behind BJ\'s) to get your ticket validated. How does that work if you\'re there at late hours and Gelson\'s is closed? Lame. Because of this  we haven\'t been back in a while. I hope they change that soon."
Jay L.,South Pasadena  CA,1,27,,10/19/2013,1.0,I go to BJ's often with friends to watch games and enjoy their happy hour. Last week  I went to watch the Dodger's game with a friend. We got there  sat at a table for over 20 minutes without anyone helping us. We figured we weren't going to be helped  so we moved over to the bar so we could order happy hour drinks and food. The bartender gal reminded us it was happy hour  we got a few beers  and then after she got us our beers  we then ordered some happy hour food. However  she then came back right after we ordered food and told us that happy hour ended just a minute ago. I told the bartender gal that we were waiting for over 20 minutes and that we came specifically for the happy hour and it was because no one helped us that we couldn't order the happy hour items in time. She talked to her manager (some Hispanic lady) and told us that the manager was willing to charge our beers at the happy hour price but we'd have to pay for the happy hour food at full price. What the heck!? We paid for our drinks at left. Totally sucks  especially because the manager lady passed by our table twice. I made eye contact with her as well  but she didn't even help us! So much for BJ's Gold Standard Excellence... BJ's  you guys lost a loyal customer. Not coordinating any more happy hours at BJs with my friends anymore.
Django A.,Aliso Viejo  CA,2,32,24,8/11/2013,2.0,Came here last night for take out and the front host were friendly (That's the 2 Stars I gave)... I would have given an extra star if they got my order right and if they weren't too stingy on the ice cream for my pizookie... Also  I was not too happy with the Nachos... I realized they forgot to give my chili when I got to my destination. All it had was lots of chips  small amount of tomatoes and dried up cheese... I ended up paying over $22.00 for a Pizookie and a dried up Nacho... That's including with tip and parking fee since they do not validate for parking... I'll be back for the second time and I'll give them another chance.... BUT PLEASE get my Nachos right and don't be too stingy on the ICE CREAM!
Arpan S.,Pismo Beach  CA,37,15,13,10/5/2014,1.0,The service is okay  the food is what you expect  the beer and the beer glasses are warm  don't know if this was an off day  but the beer experience was bad. Overall an okay place.
Natalie N.,Los Angeles  CA,0,18,,10/30/2014,2.0,So sad about my experience here because I usually love BJs. I was really disappointed with the deep dish pizza we got. We asked for pepperoni on one side only (and the receipt reflected this) but the whole thing had peperoni. Additionally  the pizza was not as hot as it usually is when they bring it out. I can tell it had been out for a while. We waited quite a bit for it too  so it makes sense. It is so pretty inside! Wish the service and food matched the dcor...
Veronica A.,Duarte  CA,12,2,,12/12/2012,4.0,Grace could have done better service but Ernesto was great even though he continued to bring us lump items. He had great personailty and nice smile with a twinkle in his eyes.
Karen E.,Pasadena  CA,74,222,4,3/23/2013,3.0,Your standard BJs. Good food  friendly service and amazing pizookies :)
Louie T.,Pasadena  CA,68,85,64,3/23/2013,4.0,For a bar restaurant  food here is excellent but ironically I'm not a big fan of their own beers.
Joseph C.,San Diego  CA,391,201,101,2/22/2013,4.0,I come here to discuss game plans with my co workers over happy hour/beer. We always start off with the calamari and usually the BJ's dark beer. I've ordered a sante fe looking chicken salad (Don't want to pig-out during a meeting). What I like about all the BJ's is they are very spacious and the place is well lit up but not too bright. Next time you have a business meeting  this is the place to have it!
Bojun L.,Irvine  CA,74,7,10,6/20/2013,5.0,A quiet and beautiful place. Looks high end  and not expensive. And infinite Coke...
Moana S.,Los Angeles  CA,7,34,7,11/13/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,"Pretty mediocre food  frozen veggies  iceberg lettuce salads  heavy oil  overall low quality ingredients. The building is beautiful  and the service is good. Probably fine to get a beer and maybe an appetizer with friends  but I wouldn\'t go here for a meal.I wrote the same review on ""Bj\'s restaurant and Brewhouse"" page  this place is listed twice."
John B.,Pasadena  CA,0,6,,4/25/2013,2.0,Pizza was awful. Truly below Pizza Hut. Yes  I'm a Chicago pizza snob  but you don't have to go that far for great pie. NY style is right down the street at the unassuming Kitchen (Delacey at Union) and deep-ish dish is wondrous at Zelo in Arcadia. But we had a gift card. The wine selection is decent. Pizooki is  well  you can't really screw up a hot chocolate chip cookie with a slathering of ice cream. So why did I give it two stars instead of one? The room  the location  is truly beautiful. Ornate. But even that can't rescue what they call pizza.
Samuel C.,Los Angeles  CA,192,414,10,11/30/2012,2.0,I don't know but I used to really love their pizza. It's just not the same. The pazookies are the bomb tho thats for sure...
Matt M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,8,,6/25/2013,3.0,It's edible  reasonably priced  and the service is fine. We ate here because we knew that we would be able to eat whatever they served us  and maybe  just maybe  we would be pleasantly surprised. We weren't surprised but we were able to eat it all.
Laura V.,Los Angeles  CA,1,9,1,3/28/2013,2.0,Food was amazing  but waiter/Customer Service was Awful... They completely forgot to put in my order.
Juliea L.,San Diego  CA,18,9,4,11/8/2012,5.0,My friend and I went in to try the new BJs tonight.. Wow was I impressed!! Our server  Myles  was ROCKIN!! He was friendly and knew so much!! He helped us sort through the giant menu to find exactly what we wanted!! And the food was great!! My only complaint was the mustard colored walls that kinda remind me of baby food.. But that's nothing a coat of paint couldn't fix.. Definitely go in and ask for Myles!
james b.,Pasadena  CA,67,11,,12/22/2012,1.0,"Great ambiance  decor  food  and beer. The one star is for the following:Went there with my fam for my birthday. We ordered drinks  and when the waitress was putting the drinks on the table  she spilled a glass of white wine on the table/my brother. The glass broke  my brother had white wine all over his pants  and he was trying to pick off all the little pieces of broken glass off of his pants. Lots of broken glass on the table  which we all tried to find and remove. We were all nice about it  and tried to comfort the waitress  who was frazzled. But  we expected to get something free for such an incident (who wouldn\'t?). After the incident  our table is assigned a different waiter  for some reason.Check comes  and nothing had been taken off our tab. We call the manager and explain what happened. He says  ""I heard that someone pulled the glass off the tray"". We all laugh  and explain that was not the case. We were all a little taken aback. So  the manager takes $20 or so off the bill. We all left with a bad taste in our mouths. Just the experience of one party  fwiw."
Ron O.,Reno  NV,17,55,1,5/10/2013,1.0,Got the worst food poisoning i ever got in my life after eating here. Whatever they're doing back there  I'd rather not know  to keep my faith in humanity somewhat alive. I kid you not  the WORST food poisoning by far.
Laura M.,Pasadena  CA,0,13,1,11/24/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Berry cider....mmmm!  Fruity  for non beer lovers!  Try a $2 sampler glass
Val M.,Temecula  CA,1,11,,11/21/2012,5.0,Excellent service by Bryan. Delicious food. Great night. Highly recommend.
Soraya S.,La Crescenta-Montrose  CA,4,96,7,11/10/2012,4.0,I love BJS! We ordered the beer sampler its amazing! The harvest beer is the best. THe setting  the customer service is great.. the place is HUGE so dont feel overwhelmed but overall my new BJS ill be going too
Geoffrey G.,Los Angeles  CA,0,8,,11/6/2012,5.0,Melissa was awesome in handling a guys order next to us who sent back his pizza. And she was super nice to us in getting our steaks.
Tiny T.,Pasadena  CA,0,12,,4/13/2014,4.0,Great diverse menu. Excellent TV displays. Great atmosphere. I'm not 100% happy with the service.
Bd H.,Pasadena  CA,0,3,,6/17/2015,2.0,Went for late dinner. We arrived at the end of the NBA championship so had a little wait as people watching the game were clearing out. We got seated at 8:45pm and gave our drink order. We received our drinks at 9:00pm. Waiter came about 9:05 and we ordered a salad and BJ's famous deep dish pizza...(its one of the good ones!). At 9:30 we hadn't received our food but a different server came up and asked what our order was as the printer wasn't working. He said they had it cooked but they were just confirming orders. The salad arrived at 9:45pm...and the Pizza at 10:00pm. The server said the pan was hot. We touched the pan and it was warm. The center of the pizza was warm to hot but some of the toppings were cool. While we enjoy BJs pizzas  the last 3-4 times we ate at this location  the service has been poor. There are other pizza places in old pasadena with excellent service and great pizzas. If you are wanting good service and good pizza  then try one of them or a different BJ's. We would give it one star  but the deep dish pizza is good...so that bumps it up. Maybe if you just wanted drinks and watch the game  it would be an ok place
Albert Z.,South Pasadena  CA,1,2,,11/1/2013,1.0,Pretty bad... Not a busy night. Poorly staffed. Waited 15-20mins for our waitress to take our order. Waited another 20 for her to tell is that she had a problem putting in our order... gave her the benefit of the doubt and waited another 10 for our drinks. Asked to see the manager after noticing that my glass was filthy. Never came... Left after tables that arrives after us got thier order before we did. Just want to let management know you have a lot of work to do with your staff. Unacceptable. Only good part of that situation was I had great company.
Shannon A.,Laramie  WY,0,11,,5/22/2014,2.0,I went to BJ's while attending a conference in Pasadena. I was looking forward to trying some of their beer given the statements of award winning  etc. For the positives  I felt the service was good. My server was attentive and she tried to describe food and beer pairings. The food was average. I had a buffalo burger with jalapenos and pepperjack cheese. It was good  but not great (i.e. typical pub good). The reason for my two-star rating is because of the beer. I am a person who enjoys craft beer and in my opinion I felt that each beer was muted in flavor and most lacked body. The Kolsch was passable but lacked the saaz hop flavor I was expecting. The red ale lacked both hop bitterness and caramel one would expect from a red. The IPA didn't have much hop flavor in the nose and certainly didn't have the citrus or piney flavors of American hops. There was another Irish red that had some decent flavor with a hint of caramel from the malt. Thus was the best beer I tried during this visit. Frustrated by my flight of 4 beers  decided to give the porter a try. This beer is classified incorrectly as it resembles a brown ale  not a roasty porter. The color was also too light. If they called this a brown ale I would have a better opinion of this particular beer. As a beer lover  I cannot recommend drinking BJ's beers with so many other fantastic options out there. They just simply do not stack up to their competitors.
Aparna J.,Pasadena  CA,0,16,,4/12/2014,2.0,Nice place. Had to wait long to get water and service. Food was average and cold. The person who waited on us did not have time to listen to us completely. Too noisy even for a brew house!!!
Jorge O.,Pasadena  CA,7,11,,4/1/2014,5.0,I go to lunch here practically every day. The healthy food selection they have is great. They even change their menu periodically.
M V.,Ventura  CA,0,27,2,4/21/2015,1.0,"Our party of five stopped in for lunch on 04/18/2015. The restaurant was not busy at all  but we were seated in the back of restaurant ( 0036 table 316/ SvrCk:2). We sat for 10 minutes before being greeted by our waitress (Judy A) and another 10 minutes before she came back to take our drink orders. Things quickly went down from there. My black cup of coffee arrived with bright red lipstick on the rim and it took another server another 15 minutes before I received another cup  sans the red lipstick! We waitied another lengthly time to place our order and even longer to receive our food. The food arrived cold. Our waitress was not at all attentive  we constantly had to flag her down for refills  boxes and to order dessert for the kids and even the bill. The entire experience was not enjoyable at all. I\'m not one to complain  but this was really bad. I called to restaurant directly to speak with the manager  the phone rang and rang... I called back using automated option to reserve for a large party. WOW! some one actually answered the phone. A women by the name of Kathleen or Karen came to phone. We talked about our visit to her restaurant and as all managers do she apologized and offered a certificate for a return visit. I told her my intention for the call was not to receive a gift card/ certificate but to inform her of the staffs\' lack of customer service. She insisted on sending me a gift card/ certificate  she jotted down my email address to send immediately. Needless to say  I never received any email from BJ""s or the manager with a formal apology or gift card. A message to General Manager Michael Ganter  we travel from Ventura to Pasadena often to visit family to enjoy a nice day with them  your restaurant staff and manager fell quite short of providing that wonderful experience everyone should have when visiting any restaurant."
Gerald O.,Redondo Beach  CA,6,98,,8/7/2013,2.0,We got a sharable thin-crusted vegetarian pizza and paid $17.95. It had a bunch of black olives on it and very small pieces of mushrooms  bell peppers and onions. It was totally not worth it. Go to Tarantinos on Green and get a very good vegetarian pizza for about the same price  but with big vegetable pieces and oh so much better. BJ's is over-priced.
Steven G.,Pasadena  CA,226,74,285,2/9/2013,2.0,I've been here a few times and both times they got the order wrong. Although they did comp a few items  I'm giving them a poor review in hopes that they get their act together. There are so many other places that are cheaper and better for happy hour than BJ's. Their well alcohol list is sub-par  especially when the otis bar at Le Grande Orange has tito's vodka and heradura tequila as well items.  Also  the bartenders are not engaging with the clientele. Another drawback is the parking  they do have valet parking in front but if you don't want valet service  then you are going to have to pay for parking. Although bj's is within the paseo shopping complex  if you park at paseo  bj's will not validate your parking ticket and you will have to pay the full amount of parking and NOT 90 minutes free which is normal for the paseo. On the plus side  the building is beautiful.  With so many great food and drink options in Pasadena  unless bj's raises the bar  they are going to lose out on the happy hour and lunch crowd.
Aaron P.,Los Angeles  CA,0,15,,3/13/2013,5.0,Love this new location! It's huge  plenty of room so you dont have to wait. It's actually very pretty and heard that this was a bank before becoming a restaurant. As usual  the staff are nice and on it. We ordered beer  pizza  and salads and all were hot and tasty. The service is good and truly a good addition to that area. TV's surrounded everywhere so you can go there for a game or just simply dinner. Heard that their brunch is good as well so may go try that out in a few weeks. :)
Nathalie M.,San Marino  CA,72,4,,1/2/2014,4.0,We braved the swarm of campers and dared to come here on New Year's Eve and couldn't have had a better experience and time ringing in the new year. Parking is challenging  which is why I avoid dining in Old Town Pasadena like the plague. We parked in the corporate bldg in which I work and walked a little over a mile  definitely not practical but parking in OT is stressful. Our experience though was totally worth the walk - we were seated right away  served by a very friendly waitress  and enjoyed a great meal. The red wine I had was very tasty and reasonably priced ~$6 (as were all the other wine selections). My boyfriend and I shared this 5 gourmet meat deep dish pizza which was very good (~$22) it was served warm  not at all greasy like some other places like pizza hut. There's also a huge screen TV which is perfect for watching games which we'll definitely return for in the future. I gave it 4 stars because there's nothing super original about it. Good food to enjoy in either a small or large group in a cozy space and served by friendly people.
InHisService I.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,0,7,1,11/6/2013,4.0,Had a birthday celebration here for my son the afternoon of. 11/2/13. The place was crowded but our waiter Robert was on it! He did not miss a beat. He interacted with our entire party of 12 making sure we had everything we needed through the entire two hours! We had so much fun.
Sil S.,San Gabriel  CA,1,27,5,10/29/2013,2.0,I usually love BJ's so we decided to go to this one in Pasadena just for appetizers. My mother and I ordered the broccoli cheese soup which took forever it seems to bring out. When it finally arrived  the taste was just awful. The cheese tasted artificial. We sent it back for the clam chowder. The only good experience was the waiter who was very understanding. 2 stars because the waiter was better than the food.
Elizabeth D.,Los Angeles  CA,0,12,,11/28/2012,1.0,Would never come to a place like this on my own but was invited to a work thing and I thought how bad it could be. Bad. Ordered one of the large salads. When it arrived it basically was composed of wilted lettuce and not much else. Service was slow and had to ask for salad dressing three times. Food was served sporadically so by the time everyone was served those received their food first had a cold meal.
Michael L.,Pasadena  CA,0,7,,10/10/2013,3.0,Good food good service but they always seem to get my order wrong and last time I went they offered me a free pazooki and they ended up charging me for it not right that's why a three star.
Sean B.,Glendale  Los Angeles  CA,0,16,,6/16/2013,1.0,"First time going to this location in Pasadena and our experience was not very pleasant.Lets start with the host she was rude and rolled her eyes that there should\'ve told me to walk away.Our waitress started semi nice but that faded away within seconds.Our fiends & I ordered the appetizer platter & literally it took about 30 to 40 mins to come out.My bf ordered an alcoholic beverage and that took same amount of time 40 mins RIDICULOUS!!! I also ordered and iced tea and years went by before I got it.Our friends had water and they never got refills FRUSTRATED!!!We complaint about our drinks and she answered with an attitude like we were bothering her "" it\'s not my fault the bartender made the wrong tea.""Our food came and out bitch of waitres never came to ask ""how is everything"" So my bf called the manager over.He offered 2 bazookiz for dessert but that doesn\'t impress me.Finally my bfs drink came and he did t want it anymore the waitres didn\'t apologize or asked why she just took it back like "" we\'ll I don\'t give a fuck"" attitude.After we were all done I still tiped the tramp.But NEVER EVER GOING BACK TO THIS LOCATION!!!!!"
Kristin S.,Los Angeles  CA,1,59,,7/21/2013,5.0,Came here on a Friday night around 5PM for dinner. We were seated almost right away at a comfortable booth near the middle of the restaurant. It was pretty busy  I'm glad we didn't wait until later. The strawberry lemonade  Santa Fe salad  and chocolate chip pizookie were amazing! Love the restaurant and the food!
Laura M.,South Pasadena  CA,9,50,2,1/27/2013,1.0,I was so excited to take my family to a new place at The Paseo. We were seated right away for our Sunday lunch. Our waiter came and took our drink orders as soon as we sat down. But from then on  we had to remind him to bring us everything. My soup. Drink refills. Water. When our food came  the kids pizza was on the cold side. I went to cut into my ribeye steak  it was so tough I had to use all my strength to try and cut it. The waiter was there to see me do this. He said that if I wanted  he would bring me something else. Duh? What do you think? I asked him to bring me the New York steak. He offered to bring me a salad while I waited. After biting into my new steak  I realized I should not have ordered steak here. I've had better at Sizzler. The only good thing was that I promised the kids a pizzokie. I was glad they really loved it. Overall  what really bothered me was the lack of interest from the manager in making sure we were happy with our meal. Usually when you send your entree back  a manager comes over to make sure you are happy with your replacement entree and offer to bring you dessert. I think the guy in collard shirt that brought me my new steak  who did not ask me  but told me that it looked better than the last one  was a manager. He dropped it off and literally ran away. When the check came  the only thing that was comped was the sad salad that the waiter brought me. They even charged the us difference in steak price between the ribeye and the more expensive New York. How tacky is that? Shame on you Bj's. Family time is very special. Instead of leaving your restaurant feeling happy to have spent a Sunday with my family. At a new place in a great space in town. Happy to have enjoyed a beer and the Lakers. I left with the feeling that I was ripped off. This place did not deserve my time or money. NEVER AGAIN. I will stick to the Yard House from now on.
Brian C.,Los Angeles  CA,24,62,3,1/13/2013,2.0,Plenty of TVs as usual and the atmosphere was pretty typical of any other BJs. Ordered small BJs classic pizza and the dough was slightly undercooked  giving it that frozen pizza taste and feel. And it didn't come served as deep-dish style of pizza.
Michael S.,Pasadena  CA,0,19,,8/17/2013,5.0,We come in about 3 times a month. Food is great and Tuesday is half off of wine and beer. Sit at the bar when Jackie is working.
Michael T.,Los Angeles  CA,0,23,,1/30/2014,2.0,My friends and I go out several nights per week for Happy Hour in Pasadena and we have been going to BJ's due to convenience  but have always thought the service was mediocre and the prices were high. We went tonight because on Thursday there are pints advertised for $3.50. The service was mediocre at the bar  but we enjoyed ourselves. When we got the bill  the pints were all $4.00 and we alerted the bartender who said she'd fix it. After about 5 minutes while we watched her make several other drinks and wait on other people  we asked again and she said she needed the manager to change the bill. Then after 5 minutes  we went on a search for the manager ourselves. When she saw him coming  she fixed the bill without even talking to him. When we talked to the manager  he offered no help to explain why this happened. Here's the thing  for a big franchise like this  the computer systems should know the correct price of the beer - there has to be some scam so they make more money off of the customers. Especially because the bartender was trying to have us give up and just pay the higher bill. It wasn't about the money  but the principle about being charged the amount that is advertised. We won't go back again  and we even work in that building. We will also tell everyone about the dishonestly. The positives are that this restaurant is beautiful as it was built in a space that used to be an old bank.
Tyrone W.,New York  NY,255,75,3,12/3/2012,5.0,this place looks like a train station!! 5 stars!!!!
Lanie B.,Santa Monica  CA,0,16,,4/19/2013,4.0,The building is beautiful. Love the food. My service has always been good. Try the avocado eggs rolls (appetizer) when you go- they are delicious!
Sam H.,Castro Valley  CA,0,10,,3/19/2013,1.0,We ordered take out from BJ's because we're all working late in the office lately. I'm a vegan  so BJ's wasn't my first choice anyway  but that's what my coworkers decided on. Two of us don't eat meat. We ordered a salad and asked that they omit the chicken (since all their salads had meat). When we got back to the office and opened our food we found that both salads had chicken slapped across the top. This made our dinners inedible and we left them in the fridge hoping someone else would eat them. What a waste of money. This is California  a lot of people are eating less meat and it's not a difficult order to say give me a salad hold the chicken. They actually make profit off of that. We will never order from them again.
A. H.,Pasadena  CA,0,1,,2/15/2013,1.0,I visited this Pasadena BJs for the first time a few days ago. I've been to other BJs and I like the food and the atmosphere. I was hoping for a great experience with friends at this new location. My experience was far from it. We noticed that the appetizer plates on the table were dirty. They had grease stuck on all of them. We asked for new plates and the new set was worst than the first set. we gave up on using the appetizer plates and opened the utensils and those were greasy and had food stuck to them. The towels were no better. A couple of the towels were burned. We asked for new service sets. After changing the utensil sets 4 or 5 times  we gave up  and asked to see a manager. The manager seemed liked a nice guy and after apologizing he said he will look into it. When he got back to us  he said  they have no hot water in the kitchen. They are washing everything with cold water and that is why nothing is clean. At this point  I started thinking about the food that was on its way to our table and served on the plates that was not going to be clean. We got our food  but not a whole lot of utensils or table napkins. The manager did not seem to care or think he was responsible for anything outside of notifying us that they had no hot water and all utensils and plates were going to be dirty. Terrible service.Worst restaurant experience in a long time. I go out twice a week for dinner in Pasadena. Pasadena has too many good restaurants that are always clean.  I will never go back to this restaurant and do not recommend anyone trying this place. Don't waist your money or more importantly your precious time at this place.
Simon C.,Pasadena  Los Angeles  CA,0,20,,12/8/2012,4.0,Beer sampler fun. Good menu  food was tasty. Venue is well done  they kept a lot of the charm of the interior of the bank. Our server  Victoria  was really sweet and helpful.
Mariam G.,Pasadena  CA,0,11,,11/24/2012,5.0,Amazing Service  Amazing building  nothing like chain BJ's that I know of. It feels like you are in some kind of high end steak house with beautiful arcitectural work.  Loved it and will recommend anyone to try this location first before you try any other locations. You will be back guaranteed. It's amazing place for your next event  family dinner or corporate party. You have to try it to believe it.
Brandon N.,Berkeley  CA,0,6,,12/15/2012,5.0,"Reading from the reviews finding out that this BJ\'s was recently opened got me excited to see how the restaurant looked. I got there and i was there for the first time so parking was a little on the edge but overall it didn\'t really bother me. The place was amazing  big tv on the wall and the basketball game was going and all but me and my girlfriend had the holiday deal they had ""Party for 2"" I gotta say the service was amazing  our server name was Brian and he was great and was really just focusing on us and trying to get some laughs out of us. It\'s great to know that some people still trying to do that! Other then that it was my FIRST time at Bj\'s and i gotta say  what a good way to kick it  loved the chowder soup i got and my girlfriend got the Italian salad and the pizza was REALLY amazing  i can usually finish half a pizza but i barely even got to the 3rd piece at Bj\'s  me and my girlfriend even doubted that we could touch the dessert but when the time came we ordered a Cookeis n cream pizookie and i know how much my girlfriend loved sweets. It was my first time eating a pizookie and i was amazed on how good it tasted and my girlfriend loved it too! I gotta say i will be coming back for 2nds! Had a great night with my love and loved it too  it was our first time and it was amazing! Thanks for the great memories Bj\'s!"
