Brandon R.,Hollywood  FL,29,40,182,11/8/2017,5.0,Honestly  I never thought I would be eating here as much. So many daily/weekly specials  deals  and guest favorites that are bombarding this place - who would be disappointed? Not this guy. Their menu is so vast. They have selections ranging from soups  salads  pizzas  sandwiches  tacos  handcrafted burgers  seafood  chicken  beef  pork  and so on. There's always something new to try. Their Happy Hour menu brings light to this place (Monday - Friday from 3pm to 7pm; Sunday - Thursday: 10pm to either 12am or 1am). Some notable deals happen during pro football games  such as $3 Domestic Bottles and Chips & Dips (available in the bar only)  $4 BJ's handcrafted beers  and $5 Dark Horse Wines and Call Drinks. PIZOOKIES PIZOOKIES PIZOOKIES! Have you ever tried their world-famous pizookie? It's pretty much a pizza cookie that's out of this world. Are you in the mood for something very chocolatey? Then you should try the Triple Chocolate Pizookie (made with chunks of Ghirardelli chocolate). Or maybe you want to try something with marshmallowy goodness merged with peanut butter. Well  they have a Peanut Butter S'mores Pizookie (topped with vanilla bean ice cream and marshmallows baked to a golden finish). It's like having s'mores in doors. These babies will change your life forever.
Nyimah W.,Benbrook  TX,63,2,,11/29/2017,2.0,Service here gets progressively worse. First visit was good. Second visit was lack luster.  Today has just been garbage. No hostess. Took 15 mins to get a drink (while sitting AT THE BAR with TWO non busy bartenders (4 people at the bar all with food and drinks).  30 mins for someone to take a food order. It really sucks because this place is super close to my place and I love the tavern cut pizza.  But I refuse to continue to give my money to a place that can give two $hits about my experience here. Guess it's time to find a replacement.
Jesus V.,Miami-Dade  FL,23,17,71,10/13/2017,1.0,"I hate to write negative reviews - I\'m a firm believer that the negativity doesn\'t really ""change"" anything in most cases. I find it better to speak with management but sadly  in this case  the manager was too disinterested to speak to us  despite having had our order placed incorrectly  never having received 1/2 of what we requested  and ultimately leading to one person in my party not eating at all - this is unacceptable.Add to that  the server\'s lack of empathy for the situation with her response of ""oh  that\'s too bad for you"" when we spoke with her again to address the still missing entree.I did receive my food (mostly) and while it was good  the combination of missing food + how the whole thing was handled by the server and manager spoke volumes about the restaurant - one that we will no longer be patronizing  I might add.Oh  and while I appreciate that they are really full on a busy Friday night  the fact that the manager literally stood 2 feet from our table and couldn\'t be bothered to turn and face us  let alone address the glaring lack of service. Not even to apologize or anything.But that\'s cool  because you\'ve got a truck load more people waiting outside for tables than to address the actual paying customers sitting in your establishment...for now at least. Until the day comes that you don\'t anyways and they close this place and open up a Starbucks or froyo shop in its place. Yay  commercialism!"
Erica D.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,27,44,11,6/9/2017,5.0,Atmosphere was lovely. Architecture was eye catching and neat. Great full menu had something for all. Usually I don't find much in the way of appetizers but I couldn't get enough here!Everything seemed to be cooked well even the side dishes! Place clean but avoid weekend rush.
Ricky R.,Cooper City  FL,38,69,548,4/23/2017,2.0,"I went hear for a Sunday late lunch around 3:30pm with my two sons  it was rainy and restaurant was at about 50% capacity. We were sat by the hostess promptly and then we waited a very long time to be addressed by our waitress  I actually walked back to the hostess and asked for our waitress. When I got back she arrived and she really didn\'t seem to care  which irks me seeing I was once in the service industry. She said something like ""yeah I know I\'m late"" in a laughing voice but I didn\'t care for it.We ordered tater skins for an app an they were actually good and not super oily. It\'s was served with ranch and sour cream dips.My kids had a cheese burger and chicken fingers  2 out of 5. My son had a hair in his chicken fingers but I didn\'t say anything as he was almost done with his meal anyway.I had the black and blue burger and it was ok  the bun had like a butter spray on it which made my hands greasy which is annoying. I was told it would come with lettuce and onion and it did not. The burger was kinda thin for the money as well  I ordered it medium and it came out med well.  I ate my sons lettuce from his kids burger. The waitress had to be flagged down to get our bill and again we were waiting to be acknowledged by our waitress when we were done eating  it\'s was just annoying. On the way out we hit the restrooms to wash up and the men\'s room was super messy with water splashes on counter tops hand towels on the floor and counters. Additionally having two boys I always tell them to watch out around urinals and don\'t step in any ""puddles"" and there was a major ""puddle mess"" in front of the urinals. I told my kids to use the toilets instead as to not step in it. I told the hostess on the way out to so I can be addressed. It was a sign that the restrooms haven\'t been spot checked in a long time due to how bad it was  you can tell the difference.Overall it\'s a 3 star place but lack of service and filthy restrooms brings it down to 2 stars.  It\'s a nice place that needs some attention or eventually they will loose customers little by little and struggle. I won\'t be back for a while."
Michelle G.,Miami  FL,71,35,80,10/15/2017,3.0,We only came for the $3 pizookie deal that was advertised. Came around 8pm on a Sunday night  it was moderately busy with about half of all the tables with patrons..  we sat down and our server came immediately to greet us and said he would be back in a few. After about 12 to 15 minutes he returned and took our order. He apologized for the wait and rushed our dessert. Our salted caramel pizookie came out quickly  we were sad to see it was not garnished with the caramel sauce and chocolate chips mentioned in the menu. Overall  the service was good but slow.... And the pizookie while good  needed the garnish.
Kelly T.,Addison  Dallas  TX,216,112,147,3/22/2017,4.0,3.5 StarsI first tried BJ's when I was in Columbus  OH. And I fell in love with it and dreamed about this place because there wasn't a location within a 4 hour drive from where I lived. Needless to say  I was super excited when I found out there was one near me now that I moved to FL.However  I guess the memories were sweeter than when I tried this place again. I tried a quinoa dish with shrimp  nothing too good about it. My boyfriend wasn't crazy about his penne dish although he was super hungry coming in. I tried the burger another time when I came in. It was very average and also very messy. The BEST part about BJs and why I keep coming back though is for the pizookies. It is my all time favorite dessert and I've had a LOT of desserts. I give 5 stars for the pizookie.
Reixa C.,Coconut Creek  FL,550,525,3201,12/20/2016,5.0,"12/19/2016 - Monday nights are a winner here! 1/2 OFF LARGE PIZZA!Very nice restaurant but we decided to sit at the bar. Our bartender Christophe was AMAZING!!!! He was the best. If you come here  sit at the bar  and ask for him. He is so nice   polite  and engaging. He payed attention to all his customers  answered questions about beers  got us our food  cleaned up the plates  got us to go boxes...he did not miss a beat. All by saying ""this is what I\'m here for""  ""I\'m here for you""  ""It is my job to make sure you are all happy."" Ok  so now about that PIZZA. We ordered a large Gourmet Five Meat deep dish pizza  Housemade meatballs  pepperoni  oven roasted ham  smoked bacon  Italian sausage and Parmesan cheese. I had one and a half pieces and I was stuffed. They really pack on the meats and the dough is nice and buttery but not greasy. It was so fluffy  just delicious! To drink  I had one of their own brew  Hopstorm IPA (6% ABV). There are tv\'s everywhere but the best one is behind the bar. It is a humongous TV that has 4 different screens to watch football  soccer  and the fights all at once. This is my first time here and a winner in all counts for me!"
Tina Y.,Miami  FL,153,26,43,10/12/2017,5.0,"I\'ve never been to ""bad"" bjs restaurant. This location is my first and I throughly enjoyed it. I had prime rib dinner special and chicken Parmesan. Prime rib was juicy and tender. Chicken cooked just right. Great experience cannot wait to go back"
Fonzi G.,Hollywood  FL,0,2,6,10/23/2017,4.0,Service was different both visit but we was happy with most part   our server could of been more present but southern fried chicken was great be sure to ask for extra sauce with your dinner
Erz L.,Newnan  GA,0,1,1,10/20/2017,5.0,Good placeBison burger was awesome Blond beer-goodSalad with fresh mozzarella and tomato's was very tastyI was great with their service
Mauricio V.,Miami  FL,68,98,47,6/25/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,I am very familiar eith the BJs chain and am a fan of the establishment. However  I am not a fan of this particular branch. If you're tight on time for a lunch break on a work day  DO NOT come here. I came here with coworkers on a Thursday afternoon for lunch. We were promptly seated  however  the waitress took TOO LONG to in the rest of the service aspects; the food and drinks took forever to arrive  and the waitress even took a while to bring us our checks and then our receipts to sign once we have paid.As for the food  my pulled pork sandwich was too sweet  and my coworker complained that his side of brussel sprouts were as hard and unpalatable. Bottom line: look elsewhere for a good and quick meal.
Maryann S.,Hallandale Beach  FL,275,125,413,5/2/2017,4.0,We came here for a late lunch after a full day of shopping around the area. The plaza get a little packed from nearby stores but regardless the side u park on  there is easy access in both sides to the entrance. Sometimes depending on the hour of day your having a bite to eat  it does get a little packed. So if your in a rush or hate to wait  you can sit by the bar area and there is a lot of seating and high chair/tables.We didn't want to wait for a table to we sat in the bar area. Service is semi-quick  it would be the same if you were to sit in the dining area. For drinks  I ordered the strawberry lemonade  had strawberry chunks and sourness was settled  not over powering at all. What's nice about the appetizer is that you can get a shareable dish or mini bites. We stuck with the shareable dish and ordered the chips & artichoke/spinach dip. Chips were a bit greasy but warm and the dip had pieces of spinach with little chunks of artichoke that broke apart as you scope it with your chip. Not bad at all!For my main entree  I was being good and ordered the quinoa/brown rice with shrimp. The mixture of the rice was perfect and tasted more of the quinoa  it balanced with the tomato and mushroom with steamed shrimp  that was lightly seasoned. Shrimp could of use a bit of lemon but that's ok. Dish was fulfilling with only have the calories  plus for me!Dessert! Omg! I ordered the white chocolate macadamia pazookie with 2 scoops of ice cream on top ! Fresh from the oven  it was just WOW Amazing! That dish never disappointments me at all! Our server was friendly and attentive  we did wait awhile for our appetizer but other than that service was good!
Jenn B.,Hallandale Beach  FL,82,8,8,11/20/2017,5.0,Just want to give a huge thumbs up and 5 stars for our waiter tonight Daniel C. He was a great server. The food was great and we had a very relaxed enjoyable dinner. We will definitely be back.
Foodie ..,Fort Lauderdale  FL,148,73,369,6/4/2017,1.0,I went for a late dinner last night and was very disappointed The food took forever and was cold when it arrived. The hamburger buns were burned so everything had to go back to be redone.The staff was compassionate but the kitchen was not helping their efforts to resolve the issues.I am hoping that management can find where the problems are so that their ratings don't continue to fall .
Al H.,Davie  FL,0,5,,10/8/2017,4.0,Brought some family from out of town to BJ's for lunch and none of us were disappointed. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their lunch entre but I will comment only on mine. I ordered the Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe burger. Housemade guacamole  Applewood smoked bacon  pepper jack cheese  chipotle mayonnaise  red onions  tomatoes and jalapeos cooked to medium rare perfection.In short: The burger was great as were their piping hot crispy fries and the service was on-point.
Najla A.,Hollywood  FL,75,2,,11/12/2017,3.0,Stopped in here for early dinner. Tried the Mac & Cheese Couscous  description says creamy but appears like it was microwaved to long & dried out. Had the shrimp & arugula tacos & they were extremely cheap with the shrimp  only 2 in each. There should have been one at least for each bite.  Not happy with today's visit. Most likely will not return.  Only good thing was the server  she was very pleasant.
Denise C.,Miami  FL,99,104,74,7/30/2017,3.0,This restaurant is alright. Nothing too impressive. I order their salad every time I dine here and I enjoy trying to different beers they offer. The drinks aren't that great at all. We ordered 3 and they all came out mediocre. If you want something simple and not too crazy  this place is good for a quick bite.
Nicole H.,Hialeah  FL,80,25,123,7/26/2017,4.0,*Make sure to sign up for their rewards club!* I absolutely love their avocado egg rolls! This appetizer comes with 6 rolls  which is always a good starter. I've tried the avocado chicken sandwich and the bj burger. Those dishes are ok but my favorite dish here is the deep dish pizza. I highly recommend as desert to order the Pizzoci Trio. You can choose three hot and fresh cookies topped with vanilla ice cream. I always choose the macadamia nut cookie. It's delicious!
Thu N.,Pembroke Pines  FL,76,91,118,4/18/2017,5.0,Had a great Dinner here with My friend. The service was quick and our waitress was really nice. I got the salmon Peruvian quinoa bowl and it was really good and filling too  which I wasn't expecting. We also got the monkey bread pizookie which taste like a cinnamon bun with ice cream on top. It was delicious!
Mike M.,Bradenton  FL,23,87,2,10/23/2017,3.0,Food was good.Our server was excellent. Not enough TV's. Drinks are very expensive even beer $5.99 for domestic beer a Yuengling? I uderstand it was a Saturday  But you should always have a special price beer or drink. My bill was over $80 for (2) adults. I could have spent half of that at Chilis  Apple bees or Ruby Tuesday. I only tried this place because it was something different. It was not worth the extra expense......
Sadie G.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,5,,11/7/2017,5.0,Food is good my favorite entrees are the Mediterranean chicken tacos or Parmesan crusted chicken but their pizookies are AAAMAZING! If you come out make sure you ask for Desi he's awesome and super cute.
Richard P.,Hollywood  FL,0,10,,11/7/2017,2.0,Food is good but the service is absolutely horrible. I have tried several times but just can't get over the service. They always seem to be under staffed even when not busy.
Manny M.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,4,83,229,3/20/2017,3.0,Service is slow  food is average at a higher price. Had the Italian Market thin crust--have had better frozen pizza from the grocery store. Wife had the Atlantic Salmon  she thought it was average as well. And my oldest had soup and salad. The Caesar salad was good to go  the broccoli and cheddar soup--was most all cheddar light broccoli. My kid said it was ok. We had two different desserts  the chocolate chip pizookie--the kids loved it; however  the baked Beignet was a disappointment. It was completely covered in cinnamon and sugar. It tasted like a cinnamon sugar donut--the whip cream and ice cream were almost non-existen. Recommend you eat elsewhere if you want to play average price for average food.
Paige B.,Hollywood  FL,1,25,16,11/5/2017,5.0,From delicious pizookies made with freshly baked cookies topped with ice cream  to incredible Asian-themed soba noodles and parmesan crusted chicken  BJ's menu is great. Service is typically top notch  and they have lots of great options on their menu. The beer selection is pretty great  too. If you're in this area and are interested in a quality sit down restaurant  BJ's is a great option.
Cassandra A.,Hialeah  FL,87,42,173,2/26/2017,5.0,I have to say BJs is one of my all time favorites. Nothing that I have tried has ever left me disappointed. I have been here way too many times and try to get different plates all the time. I've had wings  spicy peanut chicken noodles  balsamic glazed chicken  burgers  Parmesan crusted chicken  soups  pizza  and most importantly their pizookies are the absolute best. It is a warm cookie topped with ice cream. They come in a variety of flavors and I will literally drive 25 minutes just to pick one up. The ambience is casual as it is also a bar with TVs and they make their own beer. I like their blonde Brew. You can call ahead and save a spot which I recommend on the weekends. Service can be slow at times which is the only downfall.
Marcia B.,Baltimore  MD,0,57,29,10/5/2017,3.0,Good location. Lots of food choices. We went for dinner at about 8:30 on a Thursday evening. The restaurant was not super crowded but the service was lacking. Our food arrived in decent time  but 4 of the 6 orders were not correct In some way. IThey served pizza but didn't have crushed pepper or oregano. The light above the table was caked with dust and cobwebs. The floors were noticeably not clean. This is not my first trip here and the atmosphere is pretty nice but it was disappointing on this visit. Hopefully this was just an off night. This restaurant is still worth a try. They have a great variety of food choices.
Foncho G.,Denver  CO,0,17,,8/3/2017,5.0,Great place to have lunch or dinner. We came here after having such a negative experience at a furniture store near by and we felt so relaxed and at home. My partner and I always try to find a BJ's whenever we are travelling together. Atmosphere is lovely and so is their architecture.We recommend BJ's to all our friends and acquaintances.WE LOVE BJ's !
Cisco A.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,18,114,13,7/2/2017,5.0,Food is pretty good. They have a wide selection of different entrees. Will not disappoint.
Heather G.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,39,65,81,9/4/2017,4.0,I've been here before quite a while back and don't really remember it standing out to me for any reason  nor do I have any bad memories of the place. So when a friend suggested it for lunch I was like sounds good to me. Its pretty big inside and has a decent bar area. They have a point system for the loyals. The menu is huge!! Like it has actual page numbers. I wanted to call it a sports bar type place but it's not. It's more than that and they have a lot of food options. I decided on the California chicken club and fries. The sandwich came on garlic toast and had avocado. It was really good! The waitress was attentive and nice. They had this cookie thing that I kept eyeballing for dessert but ended up being full so I passed on it. I think that I may give this place another try as there were a lot of yummy looking things on the menu. Ok really because I want that damn cookie  but I'll play it off by ordering actual food first.
Jessica C.,Hialeah  FL,0,1,,11/20/2017,3.0,It was our first time there and the waitress had a snarky attitude since we sat down i asked what she recommended and she looked at me like i was speaking another language. Am not one to give reviews but it had to be said if you have bad service you will lose customers! The meatballs were so salty i couldn't eat
Harvey D.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,215,404,,6/22/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,I had to downgrade my review because I am sick and tired of this restaurant filling carry out orders incorrectly. I have ordered carry out from them many times because my wife likes their food. They can't seem to ever get it right. For example  I ordered the chicken club with fries (online). I even called and made sure that they didn't put bacon or cheese on the sandwich and that it came with fries. What happened? They forgot to give me the fries and gave us some sort of shrimp pasta (which we didn't order). Come on! Do they even look at what they are putting in the bag? My wife was in a hurry and didn't have time to check and make sure that everything was ok. She shouldn't have to. An order of tacos and a chicken club with fries is not that difficult to package correctly. There have been several other instances of ineptness at this restaurant throughout the past few months. I think management needs to take a look at their carry out staff and the procedures that go along with the carry out process.Until they fix this problem  I won't be ordering carry out from them.
Charelle B.,Miami  FL,9,30,54,4/29/2017,1.0,The worse experience EVER as a first time guest. My party and I waited 2 hours to be seated after arriving ON TIME! 7: 30 to 9:35. However after another 45mins our waitress brought the food to the table as an appetizer we had the barbeque boneless chicken and for my entree the lemon herbed chicken with Brussels sprouts and tomato perfectly seasoned over a bed of brown rice. OMG it was amazing. The chicken was succulent and juicy and the veggies were more flavorful than I could've ever imagined. The strawberry lemonade wasn't any good but my long island definitely did the trick. The food was delightful everything else was lacklustre.
Rendy I.,Hollywood  FL,0,1,,5/13/2017,1.0,Waiting was over an hour. Food is not even close to good. Pasta is like pasta sauce from walmart and not fresh.Bug in my friend's salad. She tried to make a complain but they denied it. Not gonna come back.Also their beer taste 1 out of 10.
Maria B.,Miami Beach  FL,7,7,,8/22/2017,1.0,My husband suggested we go there for lunch. I had never been but he said the food was always good. When we went we ordered an appetizer and the hostess had told me about the loyalty rewards program so I downloaded the app immediately. We started off ordering an appetizer which was great. But when the entrees came  my husbands pasta was awful  it tasted like it was a day old. He didn't eat it and when the waiter came we told him. We paid 50 bucks that day for our meal and we figure the restaurant can keep the ten dollars or whatever for the meal. We aren't ever going back and deleted the app.
Steve W.,Southwest Ranches  FL,73,63,33,5/14/2017,3.0,Have not been here in awhile. They did update their menu but I'd say it's a better bar and appetizer place than a restaurant. Beers are reasonably priced  food seems pricy for what you get.
Christian D.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,84,160,198,5/10/2017,2.0,My GF and I were at the mall nearby and were starving by the time we left. We decided to stop by BJs for dinner. It was about 5:15 on a Saturday. Surprisingly enough  they were quite empty. We were greeted and seated right away. Our server was pleasant  I am sorry her name escapes me right now. She brought us our beverages and we ordered our food: I got a BBQ burger on a gluten free bun (stupid dietary restriction!) and my GF got the pork chop. We each ordered a side salad. My GF and I chatted for a few minutes and the salads were brought out. The lettuce was crisp  cold and the veggies were fresh and temp appropriate. The main meal came out maybe 10 min after we finished the salads. My burger was very tasty looking  as was my GF's meal  and both were temperature appropriate. We each took a big bite of our meals..... and were immediately disappointed in the lack of flavor. For something that is supposed to have big  bold taste  my BBQ burger was wimpy and meek. The bun was tolerable but it quickly got soggy and fell apart  as most gluten free buns are prone to do. The fries were crisp and warm  but over salted. I drained my iced tea to rehydrate my over salted tastebuds  but little did I know that would be the only one I got  as the server never came back by after the initial stop by when the meal was delivered. My GF 's pork chop was heavy on the salt as well. It was juicy but really just lacked any over all flavor besides sodium chloride. The baked potato she ordered as a side looked like someone set it on fire  as it was VERY black on the top. She cut away that part and ate 1/2 of the rest. It was overall a very disappointing meal for what we paid. With so many restaurants in the area  BJs need to tighten up. I don't really plan to stop by here again unless there is just no other choice.
Mare G.,Hollywood  FL,5,18,3,9/14/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Kari the bartender awesome always knows what I like without asking. Cory is fabulous always greets us even if he's not our or server!! Love him keeper!
Katia B.,Hollywood  FL,37,164,109,8/25/2016,5.0,Every time we have been here the service has always been excellent.The food is also pretty good American food. You can get things like wings  pizza  steak  ribs  and fries. Basic stuff but it tastes good.What I love is the great service and the great beer... and the pazookies are also great!
Khushboo P.,Buford  GA,73,23,23,5/16/2017,5.0,Sooo much variety! Very good prices! Very clean! Pls end your meal with a pizookie! I have nothing bad to say about BJs
Jessica D.,Hollywood  FL,0,4,,10/5/2017,1.0,This was once our favorite place to eat dinner until tonight. We walked in as a party of 8 on a Thursday night around 7:30 PM for a birthday. The food was great. However  the service was absolutely terrible. It took 35 minutes for our drinks to reach the tables and 40 minutes for our appetizers to come out. Our waters took about an hour to come to the table. Our entrees took an hour plus to come out. The manager John came by to apologize they were short staffed but did absolutely nothing to make sure our drinks were filled as he said he would. A very rude waitress came by to let us know the bar was out of Black Label and did not offer us something different. This place is not the same as it use to be years ago. It's sad because BJ's once was our favorite place but after tonight  we will not be returning. I hate writing bad reviews and being this customer; however something needs to change with this restaurant. Lazy servers and lazy cooks with no ambition. Not worth waiting for the food and spending so much money. You're better off going across the street to Ale House where there is better food  service  and more affordable.
Lourdes G.,Hialeah  FL,42,15,32,9/5/2017,1.0,"Let me start by saying this is the second time We come to the Pembroke Pines location and have a bad experience! We had not come to this one in about a year or so and decided to give them one more chance  well - we order our drinks  a couple of beers and some fried calamari and that arrived pretty quick. My son order a cheddar brocoli soup as a starter. We ordered our food  I ordered a santa fe salad with they make it delicious  my hisband orderd a small (personal pizza) and my son ordered wings. The food arrived - my son got the wings (no soup)  my husband\'s pizza looked like it could fit in his mouth with just one bite! So he told the waiter to bring a small because he mistakenly had written down a ""mini"" . He all ate  20 minutes later - still no small pizza! We asked for the bill  we got billed for the damn pizza we never got! The waiter was surprised we didn\'t get it! It\'s his job to check on our order  nobody\'s fault but his. We told the host up front how we fell  never again will i go in there! Terrible service. Unlike the one at Doral "
Michelle S.,Miramar  FL,104,24,25,8/26/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Great restaurant!! Great service...our server Nailah was so professional...attentive and just AMAZING!!!!We'll be back!!!
Lymari R.,Hollywood  FL,49,64,175,3/24/2017,5.0,Absolutely love this place. The Brussel sprouts are my favorite along with ahi tuna salad. They have a great selection of beers  their full barl is good as well
Heather M.,Pembroke Pines  FL,132,85,18,2/21/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I've been here a few times and this visit was one of the better visits  but it still only gets 3 stars. I'll explain why.To start things off on a high note  my Pink Cadillac cocktail was very yummy and I really enjoyed it. For my entree  I decided to have the sirloin steak. It was reasonably priced but it was nothing special. My sister had a bison burger and didn't care for it. For dessert  we had beignets. My mom told us how delicious they were  and boy was she right. I was craving more! Deliciously pillowy  not to sweet  and with a side of fresh strawberries  ice cream  and whipped cream. This is not a dessert to pass up!As far as our server goes  she was ok. Her name was Kathy  and she was very busy! It was very clear to me that she was trying to upsell every chance she could. I understand needing to upsell  but I don't like it when it's obvious. Then it's just annoying. She suggested appetizers. Then she suggested more rounds of drinks. Then she suggested dessert. I don't know  maybe it was just me who noticed it  but I heard her doing it at all the other tables as well.Last thing- their website says ALL pizzas are half off on Mondays. That is not the case  and BJ's needs to make it more clear. My mom got a mini deep dish  which was not half off. Overall  forgettable as usual. I'm sure I'll come back for dessert and drinks  but not dying to come back for the food or service.
Camille G.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,17,40,27,7/24/2017,1.0,Food and service here are terrible. My husband and I went here for dinner on a Sunday night. We ordered the fried asparagus ( all clumped together and the breading just fell off when trying to pull them apart)  a mini pepperoni pizza (it tasted like it just came fresh out of the microwave)  and the parmesan crusted chicken ( bland and not crispy  although the mashed potatoes that came with it were decent). The only thing the got right was the drinks. The Long Islands were good. Kudos to the bartender. When we told the waitress we were not satisfied with our meal and asked for the check  we sat there for a half an hour waiting for her to come back. We eventually walked up to the take out counter and asked for the manager. No apologies. We will not be returning to this establishment.
Jacqueline U.,Birmingham  AL,0,1,,11/2/2017,1.0,I have an ID recognized by DOT and ABC but BJs would not serve me. Like most places in Alabama minorities are discriminated against because of what they do and do not have. Will not be back until policies are inclusive and welcoming to all.
John S.,Hollywood  FL,31,7,1,8/21/2017,1.0,we went on a Sunday 530 and the place was empty. we were told that we had to wait 30 min since they didnt have enough servers. We sat at one of the bar tabeles since we didnt want to wait. We had to clean off the table our self. we had to get menus our self. It was very hot and we asked if they could make it cooler we were told that the ac has been broken and they were working on it.
Jillian S.,Weston  FL,114,4,1,8/19/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Second time ordering online and it was just as terrible as the first time I ordered online. The pick up time was 6 pm & it wasn't ready until 630. I ordered the fried jalapeo burger and there was no fried jalapeos on it  nor was there fries on the side. The second thing I ordered was sliders with only lettuce pickles and onions  and there was no onions on it. The last thing I ordered was three pizookies and only received one ice cream. Not one thing I ordered was correct. Now my food is cold and I've wasted over an hour here. Save yourself the time and order take out somewhere else
Jimmy S.,Hollywood  FL,0,5,,10/14/2017,5.0,"Outstanding service  went here for a birthday lunch with my Mom  the food was good i\'d give it 3 1/2 to 4 stars but the service was great in the end. My mom loves Longhouse wanted nothing to do with BJ\'s but I convinced her to come here since it was my birthday she was a bit critical because of it  the salads showed up and as the guy was placing them on our table the waitress also showed up with our steaks with that ""oh shit"" look on her face. Not such a big deal really but whatever we pushed the steaks aside for a few minutes finished the salads then while we were finishing the steaks the manager came around and asked how everything was  my moim said everything was great but I told him about the salad and entre showing up at the same time said I didn\'t want to complain but since he was asking it would defeat the purpose if I did not tell him. He said he was going to give us free dessert to make up for it  once again I told him I didn\'t want to complain everything was good it just if he\'s asking for criticism then I want to give it to help him better things. So the waitress comes back says we have free dessert on the house and i\'m not much of a dessert person so I jokingly ask her if I can get another beer instead of dessert a few minutes later she shows up with free dessert for my mom and a free Oktoberfest for myself.. I don\'t really know what to say other than this place goes above and beyond to make sure you\'re happy and it was really refreshing in this day and age. Five star review from me. I will definitely be back."
Keisha P.,Goleta  CA,0,7,8,3/1/2017,4.0,"Went to BJ\'s for lunch. Meal was received quickly. I was in and out within 40 minutes. My dish was very tasty. The server was attentive and very friendly. I\'m satisfied with my visit but only giving a 4 because I didn\'t experience a ""wow"" factor. I will try BJ\'s again."
Toby L.,Hollywood  FL,7,12,38,1/6/2017,3.0,Haven't been here in a while  so when I received an email with a bogo offer  decided to give it a try. We were seated immediately and our server came over shortly and greeted us. She left us to look over the menu and returned quickly with our water. Unfortunately  that was the only quick delivery during the entire meal. Once we placed our order for entrees  it took nearly an hour to receive them. I ordered unsweetened peach tea and had to wait ten minutes for Kelly to return so I could ask for some Splenda. It took another ten minutes to process our payment. Drinks were never refilled. Fortunately the food was delicious. The cherry chipotle salmon had the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. It was not at all too spicy at all. The Parmesan chicken was tender and also cooked well. Five stars for food. Two for service.
Monica M.,Miami  FL,0,4,,10/20/2017,3.0,"Its an ok place. Dont expect anything more than what you would get from any more ther chain restaurant. Its an overhyped ""classy"" TGIF FRIDAY\'s. It gets a 3 because of their good beers."
Chrystin J.,Hollywood  FL,16,8,1,8/4/2016,3.0,"My friend and I met for a Thursday night ""chat feast"". I\'ve been there for an hour  had the soup & Salad Combo (tomato soup  yum). Joined by my friend. Had a couple more glasses of wine and wanted to treat us by paying with points! 393 by the total on my app. But was told that only food could be paid with points. Asked for the manager and corporate contact info. No where on the app or on the full website does it disclose this restriction. Manager  Mr. Chavez agreed and made it right! Nice to see that he was empowered to correct a corporate oversight. Love the restaurant and the FOOD  just need a bit of housecleaning on their rewards program."
Marvin A.,Hialeah  FL,105,127,225,5/15/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,It's been more than 2 years since I reviewed this establishment and after visiting 4 times in the last 2 months the service is amazing.On our last visit I ordered a salmon kale Brussels dinner salad and unfortunately it arrived as a lunch salad (the difference is in the salmon size and price ofcourse) so I pointed it out to the waitress and she get the manager to immediately replace it with the dinner size.This place keeps getting better and better every time I go. The service is great  the hostesses and waitresses are very attentive. I love having dinner here keep up the good work!
Josh S.,Dallas  OR,15,17,4,4/16/2017,2.0,"First thing\'s first  our server Ebony was Awesome! Her and the two ladies at the take out entrance were the only three professionals we saw. The food was also awesome. I have zero complaints about those three individuals and the food. I would go back for Ebony and the food. With that said  the other employees we witnessed there were terrible. When I say terrible  I mean that I would have fired them on the spot  no questions asked. The first guy we will discuss came out of the back (assuming he worked in the kitchen in some capacity due to his crocs) being loud and incredibly obnoxious. He hung around the bar area for a few minutes with this ""I own this place attitude"". When another employee confronted him and asked him to tone it down  he replied multiple times in a manner inappropriate for the atmosphere ""are you kidding me right now?"" before walking out to purchase Red Bulls from Trader Joes. While enjoying my delicious food  my wife pointed out to me that the bartender was snapping a female employees behind with a towel. This might explain why my drink was terrible and clearly made with a severe lack of knowledge and/or care. Aside from the drink  the actions of the bartender are not only inappropriate  but illegal. While I don\'t know the relationship between these individuals but their behaviour was terribly inappropriate. I will go back but somebody needs to have a serious look at their management. There is clearly too much money invested in this establishment to risk shenanigans like the ones we witnessed."
Yasuyo R.,Pembroke Pines  FL,45,8,20,1/15/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,This is my 4-5 time but I didn't know about BJ's mobile app. So we asked waitress her name is Angelica. She explained us so well  she was so polite  great energy and well trained. I had great dinner with my son today I highly recommend
Faye H.,Pompano Beach  FL,0,3,1,7/22/2017,1.0,Big BJs Brewhouse fan NOT this branch.  We called early in the day to make a reservation for a party of 10  they told us reservations are only for parties of 6 and we can do a call ahead half hour before. We did this and they told us they couldn't as its only for parties of 6. (Insert rolling eyes) We get there  Sarah the hostess who acted like she didn't want to even serve us said waitime is 1 hour for inside and 10 minutes for outside. We chose outside (we had kids with us who were hungry). But it is the middle of summer and was hot  exhaust from cars  noise of Pines Blvd and the ceiling fans were off. We asked them to switch the fans on  it seemed like we asked for gold as they stared at us like deer in headlights. We then asked to switch to inside seating. The hostess said the wait was 2 hours. We left. Sarah was very sour and rude and not suited to that front desk position. We got reservations at another restaurant without an issue and are currently seated and enjoying appetizers. We'll stick with the Coral Springs BJs branch.
Robin B.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,10,,9/30/2017,1.0,Gave this restaurant a second chance as my order came out wrong twice the first time I went there & my husband & I walked out. I spoke to both managers Gerardo & Mauricio & was promised a complementary meal the next time I came in. Came in tonight and they charged me for our drinks saying that they could not comp the liquor bill. I wish they told me that the three times I spoke to them on the phone.  I never would have ordered drinks. Just not right. Food is mediocre service not great plenty of other places to go
Stacey H.,Los Angeles  CA,54,123,143,10/2/2016,5.0,I love this place. Great for beer lovers since they have there own brewery. I would definitely get the root beer ribs again. The name doesn't do it justice because I hate root beer but these ribs are amazing.
Samar R.,Miami Lakes  FL,103,108,280,5/15/2016,4.0,I love the grand selection. The peachberry tea. But....the clam chowder was way too thick... not soupy at all and was cold unfortunately.Our server was Angelica. She's amazing. Shout out to Angelica.... lol
Dee W.,Hollywood  FL,0,3,,4/25/2017,5.0,Jayla is a five star server! Because I'm younger a lot of servers assume I won't tip good and I get bad service but Jayla was awesome and attentive. She earned that 20% tip without even trying to hard! I'm rating 5 stars just because of Jayla herself. Food was also really good. My picky friend found herself a plate of food she actually liked.
Maggie S.,Hollywood  FL,0,69,4,6/25/2017,4.0,So after we placed our order  it took our server 20 mins. to let us know that one dish we ordered was not available. Ruined our wait time totally. Such a shame when a place has good food but bad service. EDIT: I have changed my original one star review and they just comped our bill. Thank you.
Jessica C.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,10,5,1/13/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,For the second time in less then 10 days the service has been terrible 1.5 hours for a soup and salad an the second visit 2 hours to get hour food was cold the asparagus salty overcooked and spicy unable to eat it then when the waiter called the manager he took another 15 minutes to show upWill not be going back It's a shame that such great place has turned into such crap
Lori R.,Hollywood  FL,0,29,2,5/20/2017,3.0,Went to BJ's for the first time today. I got the shrimp tacos which were good  but skimpy. My husband got the sirloin. He wasn't impressed. It was tough and he kept putting salt on it. He liked the broccoli and mashed potatoes. We split a sampler of beer. I liked the Jeremiah Red and he liked the Nutty Brewnette. Neither of us liked the Hopstorm and we can't even remember the 4th one. Service was friendly and attentive  but the kitchen was kind of slow. Bj's isn't as painfully loud as most other restaurants in the area  but there wasn't anything that makes us eager to return.
MICHELLE C.,Plantation  FL,2292,2071,4389,1/20/2015,3.0,"We were headed over to ""Longhorns"" and spotted BJ\'s Brewhouse. It is located in the same strip mall as the new Trader Joe\'s. I have been such a fan of the South Miami location. This one is smaller but has the same dcor and great large bar /lounge area. We started with a couple of beers. I enjoy the blonde  it\'s refreshing!Our server was super sweet but she seemed way off. Her mind was not where it was supposed to be that\'s for sure.  She would say the strangest things. Odd! Anyhow  we were starving so I ordered Spinach & Artichoke dip and my daughter ordered the avocado rolls. We have had these before and we especially love the avocado rolls. Both arrived and we knew something was way wrong with the rolls. They looked nothing like we were used to. I took one very tiny bite. Oh no no they were awful  not even edible. They were super fried and greasy and the avocado was HOT! Yuk  so when our server came to check on us I asked her to remove the plate because they were so bad. She took the plate away not really saying anything. I am not one to get items taken off the bill but if it is obvious one tiny bite was taken the polite think to do would be to take it off the bill. Nope  I paid for it. We started to eat the Spinach and artichoke dip. Again  disappointing. Way to creamy  tasted watered down. The only thing that saved it was the artichoke. I would say skip both of these appetizers here. It is a shame because the location in South Miami  both of these were excellent. They have a very large menu and I so wished I could try other menu items but I am obsessed with their deep dish pizza.  So we ordered one  of course! I am a Chicago girl so of course I LOVE deep dish pizza. Is it as deep or filled with ingredients top to bottom? No but hey we are not in Chicago nor do they say it is Chicago style. It is thick  fresh ingredients  very tasty crust  and such good cheese and diced tomatoes.  If you are a fan of sauce this may not be the type of pizza for you.  They barely put any sauce on it  more flavor from the fresh diced tomatoes. This must be why I enjoy it so much. Cheese  cheese  sausage & mushrooms  tomatoes  oh yes happiness! This pizza is five stars to me.I wish they delivered this awesome pizza. Thankfully  the pizza was just as good as I remembered. I hope on our next visit the service and quality of appetizers get much better."
Moe L.,Hollywood  FL,0,8,,9/6/2017,3.0,The food is still great but something about the service has changed. Im use to a friendly vibe here that makes it alot different from other restaurant.
Justin G.,Hollywood  FL,18,10,11,8/2/2016,1.0,What a fall from grace. This place was so nice when it opened. While the food has remained pretty good  the service has taken a huge hit. The last two times I've been to this establishment for a late lunch  ticket times have run well into 45 minutes (burgers  sandwiches  etc) for parties of two. To add insult to injury  every order was wrong (wrong salad dressing  wrong side  etc)  and there were zero refills on the drinks. Asking for a to-go box takes an additional 15 minutes. Is there a reason there is zero waitstaff on the floor for 15 minutes? The place is in desperate need of a management overhaul. Someone has dropped the ball. Takeaway: Find someplace else to dine.
Kethnie M.,Hollywood  FL,66,155,100,9/9/2016,4.0,I liked the flatbread here!It also had great soup. Very nice decor and great place to stop here for lunch.
Vianka A.,Hollywood  FL,70,184,508,7/16/2016,2.0,Two stars because they're pzookie is the bomb! We haven't been to BJs brewhouse I would say in a little over a year. But Friday night got the sudden urge to revisit and was that a huge mistake. I still have the sour taste the experience left in my mouth. I wouldn't be revisiting BJs brewhouse or recommending them to my worst enemy. We arrived and was told it was a twenty minute wait and we waited not to bad for a Friday night. We got seated and everything went downhill. At first our waitress Nicole was upbeat and friendly and to be honest you can be serving the worst food and the waitress can turn that experience into the best. After waiting to be recognized we already knew what we were ordering and put our order right in. We started with the appetizer avocado egg rolls (use to the best) now they put some sauce I guess to substitute the avocado and it's real spicy. We then went to our entree the hubby ordered the crusted parm chicken w/ mash potatoes and broccoli   the chicken was good but the mash was horrible and the broccoli cold and stale. My oldest son ordered the classic burger it's a burger and he's a kid so guess what BJs excellent ten for that one. I ordered the north beach mahi and shrimp and was not impressed one bit. It was missing flavor all around. Youngest got chicken tenders and fries and he didn't even touch the tenders but it's tree pieces with a decent amount of fries.Then came the worst of the worst we order our pzookie and two ice cream sundae for the boys. After waiting over twenty five minutes for our dessert and asking twice about it it finally came out but I had to give my pzookie ice cream to my youngest child because they only brought out one sundae and had to share a spoon with my youngest son and husband to eat the pzookie because they only brought one spoon. After she rushed away from our table when dropping the desert and came back to pick up the check we told her to kindly remove the ice scream scoop we never received she never apologized she blamed another waitress. Then saw the waitress coming with the ice cream and told her forget it it's too late. Instead of giving the ice cream since it was already served and out of courtesy not charged the 1.50 it cost. Well we left the 15% tip because we have manners but clearly BJ does not. It's really sad I've been here a few times for dinner and lunch precious to this visit and never had this experience but then again that was awhile back something clearly has changed with management or chefs.
Desiree T.,Pembroke Pines  FL,160,87,36,2/19/2015,2.0,This place is always so below average. Nice location  but there's nothing special about this place. Although I've been here multiple times  I'll review my lunch visit today. I came with a lunch party of 9. The appetizer plates came out dirty but at least the avocado egg rolls were good. VERY DISAPPOINTED with the Parmesan crusted chicken sandwich. No flavor at all  is this even chicken? If you want beer and a pizooki  this is your place. But don't get your hopes too high for anything else.
Alan J.,Hialeah  FL,0,7,,7/29/2016,1.0,7/29/16. Lunch. Slow service  15 mins to even order  over cooked fries  sandwich was small  slow on refills. Soup portion was small. Last time I'll visit this place.
P Luis R.,Hollywood  FL,0,20,10,6/2/2016,3.0,I convinced a group of us to go there for lunch and I ordered my usual salad (Ahi Tuna)  but on this day  it was a sloppy mess! The salad always used to look like the image in the menu and this salad was far from what imagined. Yikes!The staff are always friendly and mean to do well  but after a long discussion with Management  she told me that Corporate decided to make that adjustment on the salad- I told her to tell Corporate that they don't pay us to eat there  therefore when there's a good thing going  best idea is to leave it alone.
Mira P.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,257,252,1296,5/17/2016,3.0,Food is mediocre  service is slow... But if your on a budget I can see why this place would be suitable. They only thing I like is there is no corkage fee! Thank god we brought the wine to deal with our slow experience.
Ashley B.,Chicago  IL,7,3,1,2/16/2017,4.0,Good beer  great outdoor seating  and a large menu. Definitely a chain and not a local business  but if you're looking for somewhere to hangout in this area this spot will do.
Alyce K.,Coral Gables  FL,50,81,219,1/2/2016,5.0,Great place for a casual dinner- family friendly. Prices are reasonable and I have yet to order anything I dislike. Their burgers are huge and delicious  can be on the greasy side  but then again  I'm not exactly trying to eat healthy when I come here  I'm trying to get good tasty food! You can't leave without getting the pizookie- warm fresh baked cookie pie topped with a scoop of ice cream.
Dania M.,Miami  FL,0,23,13,3/26/2017,4.0,Food was very delicious they have lots of healthy options. Very nicely decorated and nice staff. I gave only 4 stars because the wait was terrible. It took about 40 minutes to receive our food. Other than that was awesome
Flor M.,Country Club  FL,24,9,30,9/19/2015,2.0,"Good atmosphere and service but anything in the menu besides the pizza is not that great. Do not attempt to have steak. Be careful with the healthy options too. Just got the North Beach Mahi Mahi and Shrimp from the ""BJ\'s enlightened Entrees"" and it was a fat soup. The dessert is good.... And clearly management doesn\'t care most of the food sucks! (see comment below)"
Dawn P.,Hollywood  FL,0,4,,3/5/2017,2.0,Went here last year during lunch and the service was extremely slow. But decided to give it another try. Went for lunch on Thursday  at first the service started out great but that only lasted til we ordered. We arrived at 2:15 and left at 3:45. We only have a hour for lunch. It took forever for the food and trying to find our server for refills was not happening. When we got the check  we had to hunt the server down as she busy chatting with 2 other servers. One of the servers saw me waving her down and just ignored it. Will not be giving this place another try.
Jonathan D.,Hialeah  FL,4,7,10,7/3/2016,5.0,All four elements were happening in equal measure - the cuisine  the wine  the service  and the overall ambience. It taught me that dining could happen at a spiritual level.
Shelley J.,Hollywood  FL,26,84,129,6/28/2015,1.0,"My attorney chose this restaurant for a lunch meeting with me as neither of us had eaten there before. It was about 2:30 and in between the lunch and dinner crowds. We waited a full 5 minutes at the hostess podium before someone came to greet us. The restaurant is big and it was empty except for one occupied table. Having a laptop and some documents to review  we asked for a booth or one of the many vacant 4-top tables. The hostess told us no. I asked why. She said two people were only permitted to sit at the smallest table with 2 chairs. ""But the restaurant is empty "" I said. She shrugged and told us that was their policy and we did not have to eat there. So  we left  had a lovely meal at Longhorn Steakhouse  and for my part  I will be sure to never return."
Nabeel S.,Austin  TX,132,66,16,11/24/2016,3.0,"BJs has decent food for the price. Their pizzas are unique and pazookis are worth trying. Atmosphere is nice and craft/regular beers are matched to meals. Staff doesn\'t like picking up the phone within an hour of closing. I mean I wouldn\'t like picking up the phone either  but a job is a job and no one likes being put on hold and never taken off of it multiple times months apart. Just don\'t depend on this location if you\'re hungry late night and still within a ""fair"" to-go ordering window."
Jovi D.,Hialeah  FL,0,2,,1/27/2017,1.0,The service is very slow  the waiter literally forgot that we were at the table and the apaetizer took longer than it should have to come out. Not the first time this has happened. My girlfriend almost slipped due to the floor being wet she advised a waiter and the waiter brushed her off and left the floor wet. Definitely not coming back.
Vanessa S.,Hialeah  FL,153,34,6,1/3/2017,5.0,Perfect for date night/family outing. I order the same every time I go (spaghetti and meatballs) and every time it taste just as delicious as the last. I'm not a big dessert person but my boyfriend could die for the cookie and ice cream dessert trio. Depending on the time you go the wait varies  but it usually doesn't take too long to be seated.
Brian L.,Hollywood  FL,133,17,6,11/30/2016,2.0,I don't know what it is about this location. We go to the BJ's up in Orlando all of the time and it's about as good as can be  but this Pines location can't get right  and hasn't been right since opening . On this trip the service was horrible. No one came to our table for 20 minutes and the place was half empty. Drinks were horrible tasting. Took more than 30 minutes for our entrees to come out of the kitchen..When it did come out  it was wrong. Our fault for coming here but we were in this plaza and figured we'd try it again. Honestly..don't bother.
Mia R.,Oviedo  FL,72,14,193,5/10/2015,5.0,I rarely give 5-star ratings & although this place is pricey  it is by far one of my favorite restaurants! FOOD: So many choices  it makes it kind of hard to choose but I do appreciate that if you're on a diet  it lists it's healthy options under the title enLIGHTened  and includes the amount of calories each dish has! It helped me as I treated my mom out for Mother's Day but still stuck to my oath to eating healthy! STAFF: Overall  very helpful & very friendly. Whenever I go to restaurants  I ask the waiter/waitress what they recommend or what their popular dishes are and she had a few in mind but not too many to make the decision difficult. Atmosphere:This is the part that got my 5-star rating! Usually in restaurants  they go for dim lighting  which I hate  because I can't see anyone  the menu or my food. They had a good amount of light and it was very spacious. I especially appreciated the noise level. I think the fact that the place had high ceilings helped but it was loud enough to make the place lively but not too loud where your table couldn't hold its own conversations  as most restaurants I have experienced. The booths  which is where I sat  were also very comfortable. They have 4-seaters & 2-seaters!  Overall  This is the first place I've given 5-stars to & with good reason. Try it out  but make sure you got money to try it! Good for family outings  dates or just a casual lunch with friends!
Eric R.,Hialeah  FL,74,13,2,7/26/2016,4.0,Ok  I've been coming to BJ's brew house for some time now there are some good points and some points that used to be better. The service is actually pretty good. The staff is attentive but often just seem tired and a little uninspired or bored. That being said  they are never rude and always make sure you are properly attended to. The food is well done American fare with some Asian and italian influences that ranges from ahi poke to burgers to salads  flat breads  pizza  pasta  steaks  seafood and everything you'd expect in between. The food is always above average and has an average price range. Drinks are actually pretty good. They brew their own house beers that are always on the menu and have seasonal that they bring from time to time. Aside from their house beers on tap  they have a large selection of other beers on tap and even more in bottles. They also have a good selection of wines and a full liquor bar to satisfy your every beverage need. Another good thing they have is that they have embraced technology with free WiFi as well as having their own phone app that allows you to make reservations  order food ahead of time and even pay your bill using the app. If you do use the app  do your wait staff a big favor and let them know that you paid with the app. Imagine how horrible it is to get to a table to find everyone gone and not know if they paid or not. Yes they have a way to check but it still is nice to prevent that moment of panic. If a customer walks without paying  they have to pay for it out of their pocket. They also have a decent rewards program that gets you free appetizers or a discount based on the points accumulated. I really enjoy their application. You can even see your running tab in the app if you know what your table number is which you can ask you wait staff to give you. You will also need this to pay with the mobile app. Now to the not as good as it used to be part. Their happy hour menu prices and deals have changed. Happy hour is from 3pm until 7pm but only in the bar area although they have made exceptions if the bar is full to capacity. The house beer gets $1 off sharable appetizers get $2 off when in the past these are appetizers were half off. There are also deals on their flat bread pizza. A great deal on Tuesdays is glasses and bottles of wine are half off all day which is the best deal you will find anywhere. All in all  it's a great place to enjoy happy hour  a good meal both healthy as well as not so healthy and always good if not uninspired service.
Kaylee L.,TX  TX,598,24,26,4/11/2016,4.0,First off this ifs the FIRST restaurant who gives you a pound of boneless chicken wings! Amazing !!!!! Best deal I've ever seen. I ordered the root bear glazed chicken wings with a side of blue cheese sauce ! DELISHHHHH. Similar to a bbq flavor. My boyfriend and I shared the wings cuz there were so many!Their drinks are off the charts! I ordered a pink Cadillac Martini my FAV!!! And a super yummy white peach margarita I recommend this place !
Carlos R.,Hollywood  FL,57,64,25,6/5/2016,2.0,Came out to BJ's for dinner and drinks last night. It was quite a packed night as we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. It appears if you know someone there you get seated faster than others. A couple came in 10 mins after we got there and were seated right away. And no they were not there waiting prior to us. Anyway  our waitress was very attentive and friendly. The food portions are small. I ordered the deep dish pepperoni pizza. I ordered a mini size since it was only for me and it had 4 slices. When I got it  I thought I had ordered a kid's meal. $10 for 4 pizza bites.I tried their ginger IPA and enjoyed it. This was the only thing I liked the entire night. Our waitress did something I hate... it appears we can only stay in the restaurant if we are eating. Our waitress asked us if we wanted dessert and we politely said no. Two minutes later she returned with our bill. We never asked for the bill. Our drinks were still full so why did she do this  I dont know. Matter of fact  I ordered another beer after.I will return only because I enjoyed the beer and willing to give it another chance to try something else on the menu. Just hope its not kid's meal size.
Israel G.,Davie  FL,32,13,13,4/27/2015,2.0,I've been here on a number of occasions and haven't had anything that wows me  but nonetheless the wait time at Bahama Breeze up the street was an hour at 11pm so we came here. No wait  was seated quickly. However  my waitress brought us our drinks and didn't come back for another 20 minutes. My wife and I had the same dish  house sirloin. I had a side of potatoes and asparagus  which were made to perfection. My steak? Not so much. I was served a very disproportioned piece of meat  not cut in uniformed which made it over cooked and undercooked at the same time. No other place would dare serve a cut of steak like that  and for this reason my wife and I will NOT be returning to this establishment.Our 4th time here and haven't had a properly executed dish  which is a shame because the actual restaurant is a nice and fun atmosphere. Staff was friendly. But I need consistently for what they're charging  and none I've gotten. Sorry guys  no go for us at BJ's Brewhouse.
Tamsy F.,Pembroke Pines  FL,0,20,10,11/23/2015,5.0,The food was scrumptious! Fresh and full of flavor. :)We did curbside service which I didn't even know they had. It came in handy for me tonight b/c my daughter fell asleep before we arrived but they were able to bring the food out to the car. I value customer service! It means that much more to enjoy a meal AND great service.  Unfortunately these days it's a strange thing to see people greet and smile. It doesn't cost a thing and can truly make a difference.  Alexandria D. (#813) provided EXCELLENT customer service today.  Friendly and knowledgable.
Cheryl G.,Hollywood  FL,24,21,39,4/5/2016,3.0,The lunch salmon with quinoa is great but stay far away from the so called deep dish Chicago pizza unless you want to have slow service and be served a replica of Pizza Hut.I'm from Chicago originally and this pizza is nothing like they make in Chicago.
Valberta G.,Hallandale Beach  FL,96,118,251,6/30/2015,3.0,Looking for a place to eat in South Florida is tough. Especially if you try to wing it. Then my boo saw BJ's. I completely forgot abut this place  especially being that I shop in the area lol!Upon entering the eatery you notice it is a big space. TVs around certain parts of the restaurant. We thought about eating at the bar but it looked packed. So instead we decided on waiting for a table. After few minutes we were seated in a table for two people. Within a few minutes our server came immediately to the table. Man I was I surprised despite being it was Father's Day and it was pretty busy. For starters we ordered the Crispy Calamari. It was lightly breaded  fried crisp and served with marinara and lemon garlic aioli. The calamari was just ok  little oily. The calamari to me was a little thin.For our main dishes  I ordered the New Orleans Jambalaya which has blackened chicken  shrimp and chicken-andouille sausage  sauted with bell peppers  onions and tomatoes in a spicy sauce. Served over a rice pilaf and topped with green onions. Again it was not bad. Just the right amount. They sprinkle plenty of cayenne pepper around the plate so be careful. I accidentally stirred in some and it was hot! But flavor wise just ok. My boo ordered the California Burger which is a half-pound patty served on sourdough bread  topped with avocado  roasted green chilies  pepper jack cheese  chipotle mayonnaise and ranch dressing. It looked almost like a patty melt but according to my boo it was just ok.Overall our experience was pretty good and again service was awesome. Seriously you get a little apprehensive of coming to a eatery when it is busy  people waiting outside and wondering how customer service will be. Prices are so-so and we didn't get that wow factor with the food. Will we come again? Possibly.
Janese B.,Pembroke Pines  FL,56,1,,6/18/2017,1.0,Honestly this place is a horrible place to eat at   the server was just as bad as the manger on duty. First off my food came out super cold so I sent it back to get warmed up and then I have bits of tomatoes in my chicken Alfredo . What in the world ? I tell the server who was already rude and manger comes along and says oh I can take it off ur bill and not do anything about it . On top of that in my lemonade was bits of scraps and it didn't even taste like lemonade with raspberry . I swear this place is a joke . If I'm going to pay 17$ for a plate of food wouldn't you expect it to come out right ? Smh .
Esteban X.,Miami  FL,9,2,,12/2/2016,1.0,More like a church than a brewery......no ambient at all  no music  service is good but servers need to learn to write down the orders instead of trying to memorize  as a simple sandwich (very very greasy) that includes fries  we'll it didn't  wings did not include blue cheese. wont go there ever again  if you need to take a nap.... dont go there either
Ruben R.,Tampa  FL,0,2,,6/3/2016,1.0,Very bad experience. Had 2 ladies slip due to slippery floors. Tv outside did not work. Server only offered drinks once in 2 hours. We had 3 meals that were switched because they ran out. We were told when the brought the plate to the table. We send it back for a replacement. Finished eating and the plates were not picked up  even after we asked them to picked them up. Not a good experience.
Dan C.,Miami  FL,519,670,1235,1/12/2015,2.0,I'll get right to my review. Visually  this is a nice  big restaurant with a lot of people  and a lot of action. It is on the loud side and they have big screens displaying whatever sport event happening. I did not visit the bar  but I hear they have a decent selection of beers on tap so maybe I'll come back for this. Ordered the Fried Calamari as an appetizer. It came with marinara sauce and ranch dressing. These were really nothing out of the ordinary. I ordered the deep dish pizza  the BJ's favorite  and it was not great. Thick breading and hardly any sauce and cheese. Every bite tasted mostly like dough. The ingredients were falling off the top for lack of sauce and cheese to hold them together.My wife ordered the Caesar Salad which was nice and full of dressing. She also had the broccoli and cheese soup on a bread bowl. This soup was delicious  mainly because of the sourdough bread bowl. The bowl has the top cut out which is toasted with butter and garlic  like a Texas toast. Now  the waitress did not introduced herself and neither smiled at us all the time we were there. She kept our drinks refilled  but was in robot mode. I'm not sure if this place is always like this  or maybe because it was a Saturday night  but the food and the service was really not great.
Tamela S.,Hollywood  FL,172,128,481,12/21/2014,1.0,"I have never given one star. I think for the amount of money I have spent here  it\'s warranted.Every time we order from these guys  we are disappointed. We wait until our memory fades  and we look at the menu  and think  ""okay maybe it was what we ordered  let\'s try something else this time!"" No. That\'s not it. I am sorry to say that we have never been happy with anything from BJs. I always feel like I have been ripped off and stupid for even giving them a second  third  fourth chance.No more. They lost our business for good today. The only thing that was edible was my Hubby\'s turkey club. I can\'t comment on their service  except that the food is packed with toast in a steamy container ensuring that turns out awful along with the the pasta that the chef couldn\'t be bothered to separate during the cooking process."
Vanessa G.,Egg Harbor Township  NJ,1,21,8,11/18/2016,3.0,I just flew in from Atlantic City..we were looking for a nice restaurant  but definitely something different from Jersey! So we came here. We sat outside  which was beautiful. The food was great  and so were the drinks. Cassandra was our server  she was very helpful  but it took us an hour to get our food. She was busy with 2 big tables.. which is understandable  but an hour was just a little too long. I would visit again though! Thanks again :)
Kristina A.,Miami  FL,2,29,23,3/25/2016,5.0,I've been to several Bj's before and this one is my fave! The food was delicious! I got a full rack of ribs and there was plenty of fall-of-the-bone meat on that rack! The deep dish pizza was delicious - as always...service was great  too!!! Everything was great!
Trenesia J.,Miami  FL,43,10,8,4/22/2017,2.0,First and foremost while we were waiting to be seated (over 35min) several parties were seated BEFORE us that Arrived after us and had Bigger parties than us. We were completely skipped over. Once we were seated it took the waiter 15min to bring our Fountain drinks. We ordered the mozzarella sticks and the sliders for the appetizers which were great! For the entrees both of us got the Jambalaya and I ordered mine without the onions  peppers and tomatoes. They sent it out wrong  with everything I said not to put and my food was so burned all the protein was Black. When I sent my plate back the waiter said they would send out a FRESH one and not even 3mins later they gave my plate back and had Literally picked the onions and peppers off the top and left the rest. Once again the waiter sent back my plate this time the order was right and my meal was comped. Overall the Jambalaya was not terrible but I wouldn't order again  it was spicy but had no real flavor.
Lindsay S.,Cincinnati  OH,12,3,,11/4/2016,1.0,This is the 2nd time I've had a terrible experience! We called and made reservations early in the day for a party of 10  then called 10mins before arrival to make sure we still had the table they said yes it's ready. When we walked in FIVE workers argued with us and said that the table was given away. Not happy! Horrible management! They don't even apologize the lady who told us it was ready just smiled like it was funny
Yami P.,Pembroke Pines  FL,41,45,,11/2/2016,1.0,In the beginning when this placed had opened I was static because there aren't many places with good food around this area. Anyhow the past few times this place is very disappointing. The food is wrong when it comes out and very very salty so salty you can't even eat it and I love salt . The service is horrible the waiters take forever and never even come back to see if you need anything else . The last waiter we had my father in law called him out and asked him if he was waiting on cars to valet lol . This guy brought our food and hour and half later literally really bad food and service don't even waster your time or money . Usually we tip pretty good but it was unbelievable. We gave him 5 bucks just to be nice but he deserved zero . He could have had 20 percent tip but hello he sucked .
Shannon K.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,180,11,3,9/18/2016,1.0,It I could give 0 stars I could! This location does not participate in the half price all drinks and apps happy hour during football games that other locations do! They charge separately for ginger beer and vodka when you order a Moscow Mule and do not carry grapefruit juice. Horrible experience. Will go back to the location in WPB from now on.
Alexa M.,Hollywood  FL,0,4,,4/22/2017,2.0,Honestly this restaurant is really good and the food is amazing but the service is absolutely HORRIBLE. If you are coming to eat dinner you better plan for AT LEAST 2 hours of your night. This place takes so long for ANYTHING  whether ordering a drink  food  or dessert. Service is absolutely horrendous. Waiters are nice but waiting that long is NOT worth it. Also  the Oreo pizookie is amazing but I just ordered it and the icing wasn't even on it. Sucks.
Kristina V.,Hollywood  FL,52,4,,12/28/2015,3.0,Meh. Ahi poke needs refinement. Chunks were pretty big and cabbage was very coarse. Grilled mahi tacos were not hot and tortillas were dried out and hard on the edges. Entree arrives 2 mins after app. Food tasted good. Atmosphere was nice. Could use a little fine tuning. Side note. When I asked the server what she preferred between mahi tacos and ahi salad she said the tacos because she doesn't like salad. Lost out on an upsell as the salad was $5 more than the tacos. In my opinion  it makes sense to recommend the higher priced item.....no?
Dwayne P.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,37,52,11/11/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Ashley is a great server. Check out their happy hour and enjoy the great service. Tuna poke  Brussel sprouts are the way to go.
Rossmari P.,Miami  FL,154,68,44,12/20/2015,4.0,Nice place to eat. Soup are delicious with bread and the best for drinkers  have lots of beers so you can try. plates are small and if you eat a lot is not a good place for you. Taste is very well.
Angie G.,Hollywood  FL,0,5,,4/3/2016,1.0,Chose the restaurant due to location. Both my husband and I know already the service is not fast  never has been since it opened  but we decided to give it another try. Bad decision. We had a waitress on her second night  seemed willing and able  nice smile. But each beer I ordered they were out? Crazy  so I order a margarita  bad choice! Stick to craft beers  the taste was cheap  sugary  just not good! Ordering wings was a fiasco. The defining of boneless vs non was just so funny! I just wanted wings in their hot sauce.. We were delightfully surprised at the good taste.. The food  oh my my. The presentation of the tuna salad was just not pleasant  my Mahi dish was thrown into a bowl with a very small portion. We looked at it  said no way.. This whole meal just was a disaster. Took forever to get server or anyone's attention. The place was not full! Drives me crazy.. So we left  paid for one drink.. and went to another place down the road who looked like superstars compared to BJsI'm done. No more chances.
Sonia P.,Miami Gardens  FL,61,103,148,9/12/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I'm all for giving restaurants a second chance. I believe that anyone can just have a bad day. I can feel confident in my BJ's updated review. I have tried them three times at different times and days and still had the same result. Extremely SLOW and below average service. I went to BJ's at 1:00 P.M. and didn't leave until 3:00 P.M. This makes absolutely no sense! You have to wait 15-20 minutes every time you ask for something. The waiters/waitresses have a tendency of disappearing once they go in the back. I'm not talking about 5 minutes ...I'm talking about for more than 10 minutes at a time. I've had to ask hostesses to please send our waiter/waitress out so that we could get things as simple as a refill of water. Wow! Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice  shame on me! I think I've learned my lesson now. I'm officially done with this location.
Steve G.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,35,12,,1/31/2017,5.0,Actually a pretty pleasant surprise! Ordered the cherry salmon which was delicious and the wine pour was on the good side.
Tom S.,Pembroke Pines  FL,9,37,46,5/21/2016,1.0,Third time is not a charm. Ordered the queso it was chunky and cold. Ordered the Santa Fe chicken salad  lettuce was brown and wilted. Covered in smoked paprika enough to make you choke and when I did try the lettuce it was drowned in dressing. My wife ordered a brew house burger which is supposed to be a higher quality meat. It came out like shoe leather. The bun was stale and the cheese wasn't even melted. All thumbs down officially will never come back. Third bad experience over a 6 month span. It's a real shame we want to like this place bc the drinks are good but we will never be back again. I actually felt sorry for our waitress she did not look happy to be serving the hot garbage being produced from the kitchen today. :(
Dorothea P.,Pembroke Pines  FL,269,104,331,8/2/2015,4.0,I come here occasionally because I am huge fan of desserts and I am obssessed with their pazookies!!! I have tried basically all of them and I keep on coming back for them!! I love all the flavors but my top two are the peanut butter one and the cookies and cream one. The peanut butter one actually has peanuts in it so its crunchy and warm and delicious. The cookies and cream one comes with the frosting on top that melts and takes the pazookies to a whole other level. I also enjoy the appetizers they have some really good dips like the pizza dip is delicious. I also like their salads. I forgot what it was called but theres this salad with seared tuna that i absolutely love. I recommend the desserts more than the food but i still really enjoy coming to this place!
Lenya S.,Pembroke Pines  FL,78,78,245,9/16/2014,4.0,On our usual Friday night dinner  we decided to give BJ's a try  and what a nice surprise!We arrived to the restaurant around 7pm  there was no wait cause this place is gigantic. The hostess was pleasant and a smile on her face; she complimented my daughter and said she was adorable (that's always a plus). She took us to our table and handed over the menus. Our waitress came right away she was ready to take our drink orders and suggested a few appetizers while we looked over the menus. We went with one of her favorites the pepperoni pizza dip - it was so yummy! And another order of wings. My hubby is a wings fan. For our dinner plates  we got shrimp scampi and the salmon with veggies. The salmon was overcooked  to the point that it was hard towards the corners  the veggies were spectacular crispy/crunchy. The shrimp scampi with linguini spaghetti was really good  it also had a good amount of shrimp in it. Highly recommend it.Good experience  looking forward to going back and trying their burgers!
Jacqueline M.,Miami  FL,693,300,6191,7/17/2014,2.0,The service at this BJ's was garbage. Our waiter was Hector and I apologize for calling him out but he was nothing to brag about. We were a party of THREE. He took forever to take down our order  one out of two of our appetizers never came out. Once our order was ready  he brought my husbands salad  my salad and forgot our friend's soup and my dressing on the side. We all waited politely for about 10 minutes for his soup to come only after we asked for it assuming he'd forgot. No apologies  no acknowledgement. Granted  I won't be returning for his service but will gladly be seated in another section he's not handling.
Alex L.,Miami  FL,22,27,18,7/4/2016,1.0,This chain restaurant is a waste of time. Menu items are limited. Table of 9 and not one plate was worth the time or money. Stick with the bar items from their brewery. It's the only thing that is worth your money. The waiter was very good  but couldn't substitute for the mediocre food.
RALPH D.,Mt Vernon  NY,0,9,1,2/24/2016,5.0,My wife and I wanted to a thank everyone at BJ's for a delicious and filling lunch.Our waiter Alex was so good he made it so easy in choosing what to order Great Job Alex!
Carolina P.,Pembroke Pines  FL,44,126,248,6/27/2014,3.0,I find it hilarious how BJ's is located in the same shopping center as Dick's. LOLThis restaurant is the easiest to find. You can't miss it! Anyways  their food is typical american food. BJ's offers their own beer as well as other craft beers. Their pizzas are pretty tasty and delicious. We were a party of 5 and didn't make a reservation. It was a friday evening and we were sat down immediately. Our waitress was outstanding and you don't really notice the food takes anywhere between 15-20 mins as you can find gigantic TV's to entertain you all throughout the restaurant. The TV's are always broadcasting sports on. The TV's are also well placed as all 5 of us could watch the TV's perfectly with no issues. Would recommend to anyone in the area. It's worth a shot  but not worth driving far away to get here. It's alright.
Elizabeth B.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,1,35,8,1/28/2017,3.0,Ehhh.... mediocre and over priced. Fantastic service from Darnell!!! Food is blah though. Beer is nothing special. A lot of healthier and vegetarian options which was nice. But they still found a way to make the 'healthy' options not so healthy after all.
First L.,Clarksville  TN,0,17,1,7/19/2016,5.0,This is our new favorite place to come for beer. When we came in we were greeted and sat quickly. The waitress came and took our drink orders and suggested their avocado eggrolls  which were amazing. I had their bacon cheese burger and my husband had the one with jalapeos. Both were cooked how we ordered and the fries that came with it were so tasty. I love thin fries and these are amazing. The plating was interesting as well. The food was not served on regular plates  but the best way to describe it is a metal baking pan with brown wax paper as the liner. It was unexpected  given the interior of the restaurant. It gave it the feel of a small home town mom and pop diner. I am excited to go back to see how other foods are plated and presented  as well as how they taste.
Alejandro T.,Hollywood  FL,66,65,19,1/16/2017,3.0,Appts was ok  drink choices were wonderful  many beers ti pick from !! There was a lot of people so it was noisier than i would prefer  service was ok...
Eric F.,Hollywood  FL,2,3,1,1/12/2017,1.0,My family and I have eaten several times in the past with no issues and great food and service. Unfortunately tonight my wife and i went and had a negative experience. Server was nice and friendly but our food never came out after ordering. We noticed literally people came in after us ate their food and had left. Finally we asked the server to check on the food. He came back in few minutes and said they were waiting on my tacos! How freaking long does it take to make tacos?? So we're about the leave and the manager says please wait and the food is on him. So we got it to go  get to the car and the order was WRONG!!! To many other places to eat  My family will go elsewhere.
Megan M.,Miami-Dade  FL,456,519,893,5/27/2014,4.0,I'm always a little hesitant to review chains  but BJ's is pretty great and I want everyone to know! I've had a bunch of their appetizers  tried their burgers  and devoured their Pizookies. I'd definitely recommend some of the small plates/apps. They have lots of cocktails and beers  and the bites are easy to share. Their burgers are great too and you can ask for a parmesan bun- yum! It adds a little crunch that is awesome. Now  the pizookie. This is what separates BJ's from every other sports bar chain. They have a variety of these desserts  and all of them are phenomenal. They're warm  gooey cookies with ice cream on top. Simple enough  but oh-so delicious. My favorites are the chocolate chip and the salted caramel. Service has consistently been stellar  and I have never had a bad experience at this location.
Nestor R.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,59,14,20,5/6/2015,4.0,The food was amazing my wife had a low calorie salmon dish which was outstanding  full of great flavors. The service was pretty good  even with BJ closing at 12 I had a party of nine so kudos to them.Only thing I would say is that they were out of a lot of the in-house tap beer like thunderstorm IPA which is one of my favorite drinks there and the server really did not know exactly what was on tap but other than that it was a great experience at BJ's as always.
Sergio F.,Miami  FL,715,1232,4986,10/28/2012,3.0,"If Yelp were a site for Electronics reviews  BJ\'s would get 5 stars! Their 4-split screen Flat Panel at the center of the bar - 4 sporting events simultaneously!! - are a sports and electronics geek\'s dream. There were also plenty more TV\'s around the dining room.As a Sports Bar and hangout spot  4 stars seem fair. The hostess up front had a generally pleasant attitude  and the bartender did engage in some friendly college football trash talk. The food though is where my experience goes to a ""4th and long"" situation. I will say that drink service was pretty on point but I\'m chalking that up more to the service points. Being probably the only fan of Hawaiian Pizza in Miami  I ordered their personal size ""Sweet Pig"" pizza. A week out from having dined there  the only thing that stands out  that comes to mind is that the consistency reminded me of school cafeteria pizza. Come on  you remember the geometric  doughy one right? Heavier on the cheese than sauce? Coming back now? To be a little more diplomatic  it\'s almost like a pan pizza. Personally I\'m a fan of thin crust and more marinara sauce than cheese.Three stars is the average  with the ambiance and electronic entertainment raising the average. That could bring me back  but trying another dish."
Bryan R.,Miramar  FL,82,147,147,7/6/2015,2.0,BJ pizza - on Pines 10-14 nice decor - no sauce on pizza weak   appetizer & beer killian red very good 5.5
Steve C.,Davie  FL,1306,668,2210,4/23/2014,3.0,Ducked in with Christine the hottie Zumba instructor to talk social media  merchant processing  and hand-painted and imported  festive hippie attire. It rocked  here's why: * Christine is super attractive* The hand painted  hand crafted attire rocks and I got some swag! * Great service! * Good energy in placeWe only had drinks this visit  but I will be back to taste the grub. It is obvious they are doing something right because the place was in the MIX!
Sydney P.,Miami Gardens  FL,0,4,,4/22/2017,1.0,Negative stars is what this place deserves. My family and I used to love coming here. I don't know what happened from the time they first opened until now but the service has become horrendous. From the moment we sat down there was trash under our table. The walls were disgusting; it looked like food was splattered on the wall. There was broccoli and wet spots on the floor right next to us. Every waiter must have saw the same thing  I'm sure they saw it and just walked around it. It was just a slip and fall law suit waiting to happen. The quality of the food was just fucking horrible. PDQ HAS BETTER QUALITY FOOD!!!! My salad was non existent  the plate was dirty  there was only a few leaves on it. I sent it back to get a new one  and get this they brought the same dirty salad plate back. On top of that we had to wait ten minutes for our server to come back just to ask for silverware. They had the audacity to bring my father burnt fish. They knew it was burnt I smelt it the moment it hit the table and yet they still brought it. It smelled like burnt shit in my opinion. It was obvious it was burnt. Don't get me started on the obviously burnt chicken Parmesan dish. What the hell were they thinking. Whoever was the cook was knew the food was burnt. I asked for my steak to cooked medium it was well done. Someone needs to go back to culinary school. The only thing that came out right was my brother's pizza. If you can mess up pizza then we definitely have a problem. The service just absolutely horrible. This will be our final and last visit going to this BJ's. They have definitely lost our patronage.
Maria A.,Miami Lakes  FL,19,116,961,6/1/2015,3.0,I have been here on several occasions. I usually seat around the bar area. The beer and appetizers are good. I ordered a meal once and it wasn't so great so I just stick with the appetizers. I have been served by Jessica on more then one occasion. She has always been very nice and attentive.
Jesse V.,Hialeah  FL,76,101,210,9/5/2015,5.0,I regularly come here. I love this place. Usually what I eat Is avocado rolls for appetizers  gourmet 5 meat deep dish pizza without bacon and the chocolate chip poozookie and white macadamia nut one as well. If you eat any of this you can't go wrong. Try it!. I have also had the burger and it is decent. Nothing out of thr world. Service usually has been pretty good and if u come here often join the rewards program.
Amanda Y.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,218,49,2722,5/11/2014,3.0,Do not order Angus Beef Sliders..It doesn't look and and taste good For $9.25 not worth it at all
Jay A.,Davie  FL,1,21,1,5/30/2016,1.0,Food was great I'll have to give it that. We had Michelle V who gave us the worst service I have ever experienced. I will never return to this location!!!!
Mark S.,Hallandale Beach  FL,237,347,496,5/30/2014,4.0,Nice place: easy to find  cavernous interior  hopping at lunch. I had BBQ lunch plate (pulled pork slider  chicken breast  fries and cole slaw) for $7  and all beers are $3.50 at lunch (hefweizen was very tasty). Interesting looking menu. If there was one of these in Aventura  I'd be a regular. Unfortunately  I'm beginning to think of Aventura as being prohibition-era  because of its lack of brewpubs. Hey BJs  Funky Buddha  Wynwood Brewery: Aventura needs you! We don't need more chains that serve other people's cheap Budweiser and Miller swill (RIP Tilted Kilt  welcome Buffalo Wild Wings). If you don't come and do it  I might just set up my own!
Ashley G.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,5,7,3,7/18/2015,5.0,I absolutely love this place! Great food  great drinks and great atmosphere. My favorite appetizer is the avocado egg rolls. The dipping sauce is tasty and flavorful with a slight kick. The exterior is slightly crispy that just melts in your mouth after the first bite.The salad selection is great and always has a beautiful presentation. I've also had the tomato bisque soup in a breadbowl and it just blows Panera away! The breadbowl itself is garlic and toasted to perfection.Now onto the alcohol. My boyfriend and I are beer snobs and I must say I am a fan of their beer selection. Everyone has their beer preference  but I love my IPA's and love the Piranha pale ale.I've been here several times and highly recommend. :)
Kimberly C.,Delray Beach  FL,130,136,135,8/10/2014,5.0,Love it so so much!!!Each time is fun and yummy - prefer happy hour for a real treat! Love the flatbreads too.
Veronica A.,Pembroke Pines  FL,41,1,,6/26/2016,5.0,Great food  great beer and wonderful service. Carina is a great waitress and delivered us exceptional service. I will definitely come back with my family.
Laura B.,Lauderdale-by-the-Sea  FL,28,25,5,5/13/2015,3.0,"Starting with the positive:Large restaurant   pretty bar with marble bar top and very nice tables of all sizes in the restaurant. Great Great selection of alcohol  beers and wine.  The food is just above average but it\'s adequate for a work group or a family .  They have small "" bite size"" choices as well as full meals. If the food was a bit better i would give this restaurant 4 stars. I have been here 10 or 12 times and haven\'t found anything thatWOWed me except the desserts. They are awesome!!! The servers and bartenders are nice and knowledgable Ending with the negatives :Awful happy hour.  They could have a big happy hour crowd but offering $1 or $2 off on certain items isn\'t anything special.  At the very least the drinks should be 50% off and they are notSmaller menu with better quality would be betterReally have to raise the bar on the tastiness of the food"
Sonya P.,Denver  CO,0,4,9,5/11/2015,4.0,I just recently moved to Florida like 2 weeks ago. I live in Pembroke Pines  and this place is pretty amazing. I'm coming from Colorado  and so there are plenty of great places to eat in Denver. I think this place could hang. Try the tomato bisque soup loaf and anything else you order to dip in it will taste just as amazing as the loaf by itself!
Mirielle C.,Balboa Park  San Diego  CA,80,104,81,3/8/2015,4.0,BJ's is a great restaurant  I usually enjoy my visits when I go. This particular BJ's is usually hit or miss. I'm leaving a review for this last visit though.We arrived promptly at 8pm  4 adults and a baby  on a Saturday night. There was a 30 to 40 minute wait. While we're waiting  we order drinks. We got seated at exactly 30 minutes which was great. However  our server never came around. We must have waited for about 20 minutes. We finally flagged a girl down and she apologized profusely. Apparently the girl working our area was sick. She took our appetizer and drink order and came out pretty quickly with them. The stuffed mushrooms and avocado egg rolls were DELISH. We ordered entrees  and those took a lil longer but overall worth the wait. I had the barbecue bison burger with the slaw and it was good. We had a cookies and cream pizookie which was great. We took a lot longer than we expected here but our waitress tried to make up for the slow service. I'll be back ;)
Gio B.,Pembroke Pines  FL,252,6,,6/12/2016,5.0,Awesome selection of food. I was quite impressed with the beer selection/combinations  especially the house brew. Not too pricey. A nice environment and had a solid selection of healthier food. Great place to check out
Cristina G.,Hialeah  FL,3,10,42,4/20/2015,5.0,Nothing wrong with this place... Ouch! Peanut butter S'mores Pizookie. I went to heaven and came back.
Martha B.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,7,5,,6/5/2016,1.0,"So I can\'t complain about the food too much  it was served promptly but I have to say the baked ravioli served in a hot dish - the melted cheese wasn\'t hot enough though to warm the ravioli and shrimp creole that came with the steak looked like vomit. But the worst aspect of eating here was the waiter who just had a ""I hate my job can\'t wait to get out of here"" attitude. When told my parents were celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary he said ""sure we can comp a free dessert"".  This was after we said we didn\'t want dessert...my expectation was happy anniversary  thanks for choosing us. Just rude! Unfortunately we decided to give this place a second chance  remembering the food was pretty good and we gotten a lousy waiter last time...what were the chances of this happening again...too bad we chose to return on my parents anniversary."
Stephanie T.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,3,,12/2/2016,1.0,If I could give this place less than 1 star I would - worst restaurant in south Florida!!!! Horrible service took over an hour to get our food and then not only was it cold but they took an extra 15 minutes for 1 person in our party to get her dinner. Tons of empty tables -3 waiters in our area so lack of staff was not the problem - poor management and lack of training is my best guess.  Do yourself a favor - stay home!!!!
Mike T.,Pembroke Pines  FL,0,51,,2/28/2016,1.0,"The good: The restaurant is large (no waiting for a table)  well decorated  and has a nice atmosphere. The menu is large with lots of options  including pizza  burgers  entree salads and a large ""lite"" menu. They have a large beer selection that includes both their own brews and a dozen outside choices. They also serve liquor. Large TVs are tuned to sports. There is a shaded patio with tables. The bad: The service is lacking. Typically  the drink order gets taken and filled quickly and then everything goes downhill. You can\'t find your server and everything takes forever. Requested items  such as extra salad dressing  never arrive. During one visit  there was no silverware on the table when we sat down. I had to ask three separate times before it was provided. The third request was made after our food arrived. We sat and watched our food get cold while we waited for forks and napkins. We\'ve also had entrees arrive just a few minutes after the appetizers.Recently  we came in early for lunch on a Sunday  around 11:30 AM. There were only a few other tables. Our drinks sat empty for most of the meal. To get our check  we had to ask a bus boy to find our server. The managers stood in a group by the entrance to the kitchen talking and ignoring everything going on around them. Also  the food is hit or miss  sometimes good  other times lousy. On a recent visit  I found two hairs in my sandwich. I pulled one out of it  just as the server arrived at the table. She took the food away and promised to bring a new order. The manager then came over and announced that everyone in the kitchen wears hair nets. He didn\'t seem to believe us. My wife was nearly done with her meal before the replacement food arrived. We were charged full price for the meal. We\'ve given this place a try 5 or 6 times in the past year. I\'m not sure why there are so many problems  but the size of the place may have the servers and cooks constantly overwhelmed. In any case  I doubt we\'ll be back."
Robert C.,Hollywood  FL,28,4,16,3/3/2015,5.0,We always have the Ahi Poke for appetizer. It's the best we have had- or maybe the only that we have had since visiting Hawaii. Ave tried 5-6 wines on various visits and I gotta have my favorite crispy Jalapeo Burger no matter what time of day or night.
Phabulous N.,Miami  FL,36,7,25,3/27/2015,2.0,Been here before never had any problems  this afternoon everything was wrong  wrong  wrong! The server apologized and the manager did visit our table. Great customer service though.
Lily A.,Hollywood  FL,1,16,5,10/20/2016,5.0,Love coming here. The place is beautiful. The clam chowder in a bread bowl is delicious and is the best in the area. The waiter was very kind and was very patient with us since my boyfriend took awhile to order. Everything came out fast. Would come again.
Michael A.,Delray Beach  FL,95,20,6,4/2/2016,2.0,We made reservation for party of 12. They had the table ready on time. Food was mixed results  burgers were over cooked. Service took a dump  waitress took entree order after maybe 20 minutes after we already finished eating appetizers. Same waitress disappeared  halfway through our meal  never came back to ask for drink refills or to even see how we were. Got a new waittress  she was ok  not great. Dessert was sloppy and overcooked. Service has really gone down. Won't be going again.
Tony T.,Hialeah  FL,2,9,1,7/16/2015,5.0,Absolutely love this place.There jalapeo burger goes very well with a wheat beer.Great beerGood Food Service is awesome
Melissa Y.,Pompano Beach  FL,80,3,,4/15/2016,4.0,Food was very good. Some of it comes in little portions for the price. Besides that  Nice atmosphere
Aisha M.,Hollywood  FL,5,22,27,7/9/2015,4.0,4 stars As long as you go to the bar  you are guaranteed good service. The food was delish  and 50% mini pizza during happy hour. $2. Off apps. Great beer selection! Warning. If you decide to sit at a table its hit or miss.
Valerie C.,Hollywood  FL,27,57,211,12/31/2014,3.0,You need try it for yourself until you experience the atmosphere and the food of the brewhouse it is only a name.
Howard H.,Dania Beach  FL,520,450,3086,8/16/2013,4.0,BJ's is a nice breweries house in Pembroke Pines. If its not a little out of the way from my house  I'd have come more frequently. I came here basically for their in-house handcrafted beers but the foods are generally pretty good. Its got a nice decor and we always received friendly service. On one particular visit we ordered a meat ball appetizer. Ten minutes later the manager came by and apologized to us that the item was no longer in the menu. Apparently we got the only remaining old menu at the time we placed the order. Not a big deal we just ordered something else but its nice to get the personal treatment. Haven't tried the deep-pan pizzas yet but its on my mind for my next visit.
Jason C.,Hollywood  FL,42,16,,11/13/2014,4.0,I really enjoy coming to this restaurant. The selection of beer they offer is awesome. Love their PM Porter. Highly recommended this place.
Korene S.,Hollywood  FL,1,34,1,3/2/2016,5.0,With so many options on their menu  I love this place and so does my kids. First time I visited I ordered the Thyme chicken which was really good. I really like their burgers and I am really picky about burgers. Be careful about ordering the pizzas because the way they have the prices printed is a little confusing and you will end up ordering more than you need. Wish they had sweet potato fries.
Gilbert C.,Davie  FL,28,20,1,12/16/2014,4.0,Great chain restaurant. Food is good. Beer is better. Tatonka stout is a solid and dark stout with hints if chocolate and vanilla. Good deep dish pie if u can stand the wait. Great laid back atmosphere. Pazookie for dessert is a must.
Andrea C.,Hollywood  FL,1,25,,12/28/2015,2.0,I was so hoping to be able to rate this restaurant 5 Stars because the food is delicious  ESPECIALLY their GOLDEN BEET & ARUGULA Salad  but because the Chef hasn't been able to get the hamburger cooked the way my husband asks (Medium Well)  and 4 out of the 7 times we've been there  the burger comes medium rare  and he either has to send it back or he is just disgusted and eats it  I have no choice but to give 2 Stars.---Update--- for those who read my original posting  I am amending it  cutting out the incident about the check/change we didn't receive. I spoke with the manager and he said its the policy of the restaurant to give the customer their exact change  it was just an error on the part of the waitress. We haven't gone back yet  to see about the burger. I selected LOUD for the noise level only because the music is often loud.
Dara B.,Sunrise  FL,114,388,351,11/8/2014,5.0,The country fried chicken is amazing.    I recommend it.  I was with a party of 26 and our server was very attentive and friendly.   I have to come back and try the gluten free pizza.  Its nice to see gluten free on a menu!
Favier F.,Miami  FL,1,7,19,4/25/2015,5.0,I really love the environment and the waiters are super friendly! the Deserts that they have are beyond good! I would definitely come here again.
Amber M.,Hollywood  FL,268,7,3,3/25/2016,5.0,"Came here for our anniversary craving deep dish pizza. I\'m from Chicago and we had waited all day to celebrate with deep dish pizzas BJs was one of the only places nearby that advertised deep dish. Waited maybe 30 minutes for the pizza  and come to see it\'s a RISING CRUST PIZZA. There\'s nothing ""deep dish"" about it. I was completely disappointed. There wasn\'t even sauce on the pizza! Just sliced scattered tomatoes on top of the cheese. While it was a mediocre pizza  I am so upset that we wasted $30.00 for a special occasion and on a rising crust pizza we could have got frozen from Publix. The waitress was very sweet and polite  however seemed a little uneducated about the menu  specifically telling us there were multiple layers of sauce and cheese  like a true deep dish. Lesson learned. Restaurant was clean  people were friendly  just super let down about this specific menu item.UPDATE The fact that the restaurant responded so quickly to my review means a lot. Working in Hospitality myself  I know you have the option to ignore the comment or address it. I will definitely be back to BJs to try one of their other menu options. (and they have an extensive menu!) I\'m excited to try something else and again be greeted by the friendly servers and hosts there"
Lazaro P.,Miami Lakes  FL,77,38,119,10/1/2014,3.0,Thank god the food is excellent but damn the service sucks big time. Took 15 mins to get a drink and it's because I got up to ask for assistance. Child's Mac n cheese came out quick but was cold like ice cream. Management love BJ's step up your game and hire more staff please.
Mike T.,Pembroke Pines  FL,82,6,9,2/19/2016,1.0,Well how do I start this this place was the worst apart from waiting 35 min on a table and then seat and order the food takes 45 min from the kitchen I get my burger and there was a wax paper in the middle covering the burger nasty then my wife's food ice cold pasta guess it was waiting on my waxy burger and kids corn dog was burnt yep this meal sucked... Never go back thanks BJ's
Liz N.,New York  NY,0,3,,9/10/2016,5.0,We ended up here because Longhorn Steakhouse had an hour wait. And boy are we glad! This place was absolutely great. The food was good  the service was good  and although they were busy we didn't wait long for our food. Our waitress  Angelica  was attentive and always with a smile made sure we were not in need of anything. I'm in the area so will definitely make this a favorite spot for me.
Leighton D.,Charleston  SC,289,135,124,11/21/2014,4.0,I have yet to go to a BJ's that has disappointed on the food. Pizza was good (even if it WAS the wrong order of pan vs hand tossed) for a late Sunday night meal to bring to the Hospital. Have been there a few times before and have sat out on the patio as well as inside. Service has always been great. Keep up the good work! My advice though? Skip the appetizers and eat dessert first!
Allen C.,Miramar  FL,374,143,270,11/15/2014,5.0,I've been a fan of BJ's for a long time. First one was in Texas. They had great service and made sure I left satisfied each time. I keep coming back for the Nutty Brewnette and the Brewhouse Blonde - my favorites!Ok  all jokes aside  this is a great chain of restaurants. Think of it as a high-end sports bar. It's a great place to knock back a few and make new friends or just grab a quick bite to eat  which is going to be quality food. You will always get your money's worth here.
Danielle J.,Gilroy  CA,0,2,,3/8/2017,1.0,I usually love BJ'S Brewery . But this time I don't know what happened.Tuesday night we went to the BJ'S Brewery on Colman in San Jose . Didn't take too long to get seated . Waitress came and took our drink order and they were fine . At 630 we placed our food order . Which was fish with quinion and spaghetti with jumbo meatballs. Side of garlic knot bread. Garlic knot bread came out about 640 . Bit into it was just garlic powder sprinkled on bread on the outside . Some bites had flavor but most didn't. At 726 we were thinking of leaving it had been almost an hour since we placed our order . Finally food comes . The fish and quinion were excellent. I bite into the spaghetti it was like spicy like salsa . Part of me is like tell the Waitress than other is your starving it took almost and hour for food . Just suck it up and eat it . 730 Waitress comes telling this gentleman here will take over well I'm on my break . She goes 740 were ready to go . Can't find the guy any where . Finally at 745 we walk to the front tell them we just want pay and leave . They get us a Manger he takes spaghetti off our bill and gives us a coupon for a free dessert ( but you have spend 9.95 in order to get it so not really free) . Than they get another Manger he gives us a 25 dollar gift card . They both apologize. We leave at 810. Honestly will go to BJ'S brewery again but not the one on Colman.
Ismael R.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,26,5,3,8/23/2014,3.0,This place is cool  has some craft beers and a fancy bar. It's your typical upper middle class crowd. The seating is nice although the service seems a bit slow.
Lisa F.,Hollywood  FL,1,31,29,1/20/2016,2.0,We wanted to go somewhere close and so we tried BJs. The decor is nicer than most quick-casual restaurants. The service was terrible (slow and inattentive  no care for our comfort. The servers slammed things on the table as they whizzed by). Our food was delivered cold. We had asked if the fries were coated  and we were told they are not. We ordered the wedge fries. They are coated. We figured the fries and the Flatbread would have been good if they were hot. The portobello swiss vegetarian sandwich was hot  and it was good. The restaurant was full  but not crazy busy. A few observations: The menu has too many items. The lack of server knowledge  and poor food quality are indicators of this. We eat out often  and were hoping to add this restaurant to our repertoire  but  alas  too disappointed. We both agreed we will not return...
Nelxy M.,Miami  FL,22,41,106,9/19/2015,3.0,This places is only good for burgers  pizza and dessert anything else in the menu is over cook or sucks . Please do not ask for steak nor seafood. Nice place just to chill but don't be too fancy so go the sport bar menu wings   ribs  pizza and burger. Good selection of beers.
Jeanine H.,Miramar  FL,11,40,125,1/24/2015,5.0,Love every single item on their menu! Awesome prices considering the amount of food served and the quality. Excellent service. Perfect date night  family night or coworker lunch dates.
Jessica O.,Sunny Isles Beach  FL,11,4,13,7/20/2014,1.0,Ate here a few weeks ago excited to try the gluten free pizza! Being gluten intolerant  there are not many options for pizza  therefore I was very excited to eat a regular restaurant with my boyfriend and be able to enjoy a normal meal. The pizza was good  although I only ate half of it and took the rest home. I went to bed  and around 1am woke up with EXTREME stomach pain  which is what usually happens when I have gluten.... I spent the rest of the night on and off the toilet unable to sleep because of the pain. The problem here was clearly cross-contamination. I should know better than to trust big restaurants like this to understand that people with gluten intolerances are VERY sensitive to gluten  but I decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt. I will unfortunately not be returning  ever.
Glenn P.,Miami Gardens  FL,4,34,31,8/21/2015,4.0,This is one of my favorite places. My wife and I came here when they first opened a few years ago. I have a lot of good memories here. It was here where I was first introduced to the baked beignet. It was the best dessert I had in a while. I also love there different types of pizzas. One of my favorite ones is the Great White. I usually bring guest here when they visit me  and have them try the baked beignet. I haven't had any complaints so far. The only thing I would complain about is sometimes the service can be slow. I tolerate it  but hope they will improve on this. I like the ambience and the feel of this place. I go to BJ's other places and the food is good. Keep it up BJ's.
Joe G.,Fort Pierce  FL,325,214,430,11/21/2014,4.0,Came for Happy Hour Friday nigjht. So decent specials and always consistently good food. It gets very busy with the after work crowd from the local business.
Jessica G.,Margate  FL,482,618,1402,6/25/2014,3.0,There is a BJ's in Coral Springs that is much closer to my house  but I was in the area running some errands on a Saturday so we decided to stop in here and grab a snack and a drink and catch the second half of whatever World Cup game was going on at the moment (there have been so many  I don't remember what countries I was watching anymore). We arrived a little after 6 and were seated immediately. Our waiter was quick to offer us drinks  there are lots of fun looking specialty drinks but I didn't try any of those. They also have quite a few beer options with beers unique to this establishment (restaurant & brewshouse). The waiter asked if we needed more time to look at the menu. I of course needed more time especially when I noticed how many choices there are. Pizza  sandwiches  burgers  entrees  salads  pasta  shareable apps. I don't think the menu is quite as extensive as Cheesecake Factory but I think it was pretty close. Since we were there more for the game and I am not generally a big fan of this American family type restaurant I didn't get into the entree portion of the menu but instead ordered an individual buffalo chicken pizza. I have to say I was impressed with the pizza. It had enough spice/tang to be buffalo but wasn't too spicy for me. It also had a little bit of ranch. but that flavor was thankfully not overpowering as I'm not a huge ranch dressing fan. It had a good amount of chicken (though it did taste a little processed) and I really loved that the pizza had celery on it (chopped into fine pieces of course). The crust of the pizza was cooked well and was probably more of a coal fire/brick oven style considering it's crispiness  though it wasn't blackened at all  which I also appreciated.The service here was decent and the waiter did his best to keep an eye on drink refills. I will say that it was a very fast dining experience  and for this type of family restaurant that is probably what they aim for  but in general I prefer a little less rushed feeling  though I will say when the server delivered the bill he made sure to tell us to take our time. On another note as we were leaving around 7 a large crowd had formed at the front and there was obviously a wait  so we must have been lucky at the time we walked in as prime dinner hours do seem to get quite busy.
Somalis M.,Hollywood  FL,13,6,2,1/19/2016,3.0,I went there with my husband. We had to wait around 20 min to be seated. When they showed us our table  the server came and said hi but took a while to bring the menu. she kept walking around our table. She brought the food out but forgot to bring the utensils so we had to wait for them while the food got cold. We ended up asking another server for utensils. the drinks were good and so was the food but the experience wasn't a good at all.
Dion J.,Novato  CA,6,51,3,10/27/2014,3.0,Beer and pizza are awesome  after that everything falls off.  I have tried a couple off different soups  sandwiches  and entrees they all seem to be lacking something.  Today i had the half sandwich and soup lunch special. Their wedge fries taste like they had been in the freezer for awhile.  The clam chowder did not taste freshly made. I should have know better than to get clam chowder. Thats on me! The grilled pesto chicken sandwich was decent.  I will stick to beer and pizza for now on.
George K.,Pembroke Pines  FL,27,11,,2/17/2016,5.0,Love this place. Great food and atmosphere. Nicely decorated and TVs to watch sports without blaring music. Several excellent craft beers to chose from.
Catrina G.,Opa-locka  FL,0,5,3,3/19/2015,4.0,This is on of my favorite restaurant the prices are reasonable. The food is great theirs a waitress name Michelle who is very nice and courtesy. The fried nacho dip i love  wedge salad and their fried southern chicken is great. I eat their at least twice a month it's worth it!!!!
Felicia J.,Plantation  FL,23,26,23,10/22/2014,5.0,I love going to BJ's. They have some of the best happy hour and late night happy hour prices. They also extend happy hour to days on the weekend when there is a big game playing. I don't think a lot of people know this. This place also offers snack sized plates and lower calorie meals. They are good for being willing to make substitutions if you are looking for low carb And more veggies.
Jose G.,Opa-locka  FL,100,9,2,1/1/2016,4.0,Ive always enjoyed the large selection of food here. The pace is gentle  the ambience is low light and cool. The beer selection is various and the staff is helpful. Be sure to sign up for reward points if you come here often  they add up.
Madeline L.,Opa-locka  FL,0,15,12,9/2/2015,5.0,the hickory burger is amazing!! and dessert mini pizookies are awesome!
Chris B.,Pembroke Pines  FL,16,15,,7/19/2015,3.0,This would have been a 5 star review if the kitchen was up to par. Either there Kitchen Manager needs to tighten up or be replaced because his staff is embarrassing him/her!!!!Our server provided hands down one of the best experiences I've had in a restaurant in a while. He gave great recommendations and was very attendant. The FOH (Front of House) staff was very friendly we were greeted immediately. Me and my girlfriend ordered two of there in house brewed beers and they were phenomenal. We also ordered the spinach and artichoke dip as a appetizer and the portion was a complete let down for the price but it was very tasty. For entrees we both ordered burgers my girlfriend ordered hers well done and mine was medium. That is defiantly not how they came out!!! Mine was well done and my girlfriends was medium rare to medium. Once our server was available he came right over and took my girlfriends burger back as I was able to tolerate mine. They returned my girlfriends burger looking like a complete disaster. She had cut her burger in half before she sent it back and they returned it the same way. That means they opened up the burger pulled it apart and recooked the meat. It's was a sloppy mushy mess when we got it back and the best part was that it was still pink in the inside! I finally got the managers attention and made him aware of the situation and he definitely seemed bothered by the kitchens amateur mistakes. Another thing that really bothered us about the kitchen was the fact at how dirty it seemed. Our table was positioned so we could see into the kitchen when the servers opened the door. All we saw was trash  food  and what looked like greasy rags on the floor by the dish pit. I understand this is the dishwasher area but if this is what guests can see when the doors are opened the least you can do is keep it somewhat clean. In my opinion corporate/owners need to have a sit down with the GM of the location and consider replacing there Kitchen Manager. We even witnessed what looked like a duplicate order of desert come out of the kitchen. What a joke! The only reason I am giving this review 3 stars instead of 1 is because our server Darnel was phenomenal and because the manager on shift made things right. They are the reason I will give the restaurant another shot. If you decide to dine at there establishment request Darnel.
Hadlee G.,Ozark  MO,15,47,65,7/1/2015,1.0,Went after 3 great visits over a year ago and has gone way downhill. The service was terrible the burger was way undercooked and came out wrong twice. The chicken was bland with no flavor and the manager was very weak. This has gone way downhill and I will no longer go to this one as well as the others in my party one of whom went here twice a month.
Delmi M.,Miami  FL,5,13,3,12/12/2014,5.0,Wow!!! Great service!!! Julie was amazing!!! I've been to other bjs and service is ok but she just did everything perfect!! They got our order wrong  she took it back and they took longer than expected so she went to the manager without us saying anything and gave us our free desert !! That's is what I call good costumer service.
H R.,Opa-locka  FL,0,8,,6/28/2016,2.0,Decided to give this place a second chance. The place was slow and so was the service. Not worth my time. I'm not a picky person but this place is not all that. I won't be coming back. Just go next door next time.
Ray R.,Opa-locka  FL,4,88,20,11/9/2015,3.0,"An easy restaurant to go to for groups. Lots of selections. But their sodas and pazookies stand out. Definitely your ""Chili\'s"" or "" Applebees"" type restaurant."
J. D.,Miami  FL,98,93,78,6/2/2015,5.0,I've been here a few times and the food is always great. The customer service is good waiting is minimal. I love going here with my friends.
Shanene W.,Miami  FL,29,26,7,9/23/2014,5.0,Honestly I haven't had anything here that I have not liked! And I am picky! The Bloody Mary they make is super awesome. The jambalaya is my fav! Great service and sign up for your reward points. I almost always get a free dessert every time!
Ariadna P.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,11,76,15,6/10/2013,4.0,I love love love this place!My ultimate favorite has to be the California Club Flatbread. For dessert  I always try a different Pizookie  which are these delicious warm brownie-like cookies topped with ice cream. They have so many different flavors! the last one i had was red velvet with macademia nuts  it was delicious but extremely sweet!About the service  the server was very helpful and took good care of us  however  the food and the dessert did take a little longer than expected.
Dawn V.,Davie  FL,1,19,,6/12/2016,5.0,The hostess was very attentive. The food was delicious. The waiter took care of us very well. We will definitely return soon.
Jessica L.,Miami Beach  FL,8,6,2,6/19/2015,1.0,The service here is terrible. The staff is always playing around and not attending to the customers that are waiting for assistance. To get happy hour you have to sit in a designated area. In my experience they did not let us sit outside because they didn't have enough staff to attend us. Whoever is managing this place is doing a horrible job. The food is okay I mean its regular bar food but the staff and the service are horrible. Will never go back to this place again.
Robert C.,Margate  FL,172,160,36,7/8/2015,4.0,Another really good chain restaurant. Very good food & service. They have some interesting cocktails. We will be back.
Megan B.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,4,67,2,12/5/2015,2.0,The service here is painfully slow  the food is usually good but like the service it takes forever for the food to come to the table  I also had to ask for my beverage several times before it arrived. Our drinks finally arrived after we received our appetizers which took about 15 minutes after our order was placed  which is really slow considering it was lunch and there weren't that many people in the restaurant. Not sure if I will be returning anytime soon.
Natashia N.,Opa-locka  FL,38,14,74,9/30/2015,1.0,I waited for 20 minutes for server to approach my table and they never came. I just got up and walked out. Now I know why I don't eat at this location. The service here is horrible.
Sarah S.,Hollywood  FL,49,295,102,8/11/2014,3.0,Our service was excellent and our food was average. I had to send my steak back because I ordered it well done and it came out medium rare. This made my husband feel awkward as he sat there eating while my food went back to be cooked.The white cheddar potatoes tasted like plain potatoes; there was nothing white cheddar about them. The steak was ok  but for the price I wouldn't go back.Overall it was clean inside and our waitress was great  but the food is nothing special.
Brad S.,Skokie  IL,79,7,,4/5/2015,3.0,"Came here for their ""Chicago style pizza"". Being a person from Chicago it definitely doesn\'t measure up but a decent pie. Alvacado egg roles are a must have and beer selection is pretty good. Overall a solid place to eat."
Jay U.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,44,33,4,6/2/2014,2.0,I really want to give them a good review  but....First of all  let me say that when I booked a reservation for a large party in the middle of prime dining time  they were very accommodating....Thanks for that.We were there with a large party to celebrate. The service was very slow. After taking drink orders  it took 15-20 minutes to get them (soft drinks  BJ's beers  and some wine). The server brought out the wrong wine and then said they don't offer the white wine that was requested  even though there were 6 on the menu. I ordered a sample of one of their house beers. When it was delivered  it was in a dirty glass and then it took 20 minutes more to get it replaced.The appetizers were pretty good overall  but they are small portions  so be prepared to double up.When they brought dinner  they brought out half at a time  with almost 10 minutes between the two services  the second half said that their food was lukewarm. The portions are large-like most places. You can easily share most dinner items. Everyone did say that the food was pretty good  though the hand-tossed pizza was pricey.For the money spent  average at very best; but the dinner service needs improvement.The atmosphere is great  the beers and homemade sodas are fantastic  and the menu is good. Just some minor improvements in service and attention can turn this into a great place.
Stephanie G.,Hialeah  FL,0,3,3,7/13/2014,3.0,The food is great but the service is HORRIBLE!!! Every time I go the host seems to be confused asking more than once how many people & the waiters are not very welcoming. Besides the service being only worthy of a star they aren't very clean  on my first visit I had to ask for new silverware more than once because they kept giving me dirty ones. Only reason I give this please 3 stars is because the cooks seem to be the only people to know how to do their jobs.
Ray R.,Orlando  FL,4,22,,4/17/2016,1.0,HORRIFIC service and the food was barely edible. If you like cold  microwaved dry food  then this is the place for you. So disappointing for one of my favorite restaurant chains. Ann Marie might be the worst waitress I've ever seen. The clam chowder bowl was good.
Roman M.,Hollywood  FL,121,26,2,1/1/2016,5.0,Party of 15 celebrating nieces birthday. Was seated right away.  Server Nathaniel was excellent. Cared to our needs. Served us right away with drinks and appetizers.  The kitchen was super fast ! All the meals came out within 10 minutes and no issues with the food. It was all delicious as always. Nathaniel brought out a small birthday cookie and candle before we asked about it. Very smart server seeng the birthday balloons...lol. I will continue to eat there.
Lidya D.,Davie  FL,0,2,,2/26/2016,1.0,First  apparently the food comes out all at once now!? I ordered Appetizer and main at the same time and it all came at once. So stupid! Then  the asparagus in my pasta was inedible!! Not to mention that the marinara sauce tasted like it came out of a cheap can! Ugh!!! Really gross. The waiter asked if I wanted to speak to the manager and I said yes. The manager heard my complaint  saw the issue (I pointed out the asparagus stumps) and he said he'll take it to the kitchen. I was charged for it anyways! Ridiculous! Won't be coming back.
Kevin O.,Key West  FL,1,55,7,10/31/2015,5.0,Great burger and a great jambalaya! Service was great and the beer was good. Overall great birthday lunch. Btw the pizookie was excellent.
Lauren B.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,166,27,,3/3/2014,4.0,BJ's is one of my favorite group places going back to my California years. The menu and beer selection are definitely extensive enough that anyone should be able to find something. Everything I've tried here has been good but the pizza is the big draw. The deep dish pan style pizza has even been enjoyed by a lactose intolerant friend of mine who orders it without cheese. Even my picky eater friend who can list more foods that she hates than enjoys likes BJ's. My favorite thing is the individual pizza  especially since you can order any of the specialty pizzas in this size. The flat bread appetizer and salads are also good and a nice option when trying to eat a little lighter.
Mike M.,Coral Springs  FL,33,34,12,2/19/2015,4.0,"As far ""go to places"" Bj\'s is certainly one of them. I am a beer lover (beer snob if you wil) and they one of the best selections around including their own brews. The weekly lunchtime special of $3 a draft for their bres is awesome. They have a great selection plus the seasonal or brew of the month. They have a great selection of craft brews as well. Great selection of food - menu changes from time to time so the selections rotate. Never had a bad meal."
Marc S.,Hollywood  FL,24,23,,9/10/2014,3.0,We have been there once.The place is OK. The food is OK. The service is fast and slow. No consistency. I will say that when my meal was was not exactly right  they fixed it very quickly.They do have a decent Burger but the Calamari tasted like it was the freezer too long and was a very small portion. considering the price.
Ernesto M.,Pembroke Pines  FL,167,117,62,3/22/2014,4.0,So we are finally fans of BJ! After not coming back for about 2 years for an awful first experience  I am happy to say that this time it was well worth the second try.My wife ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and she stated they were great and tasty. I ordered the deep dish gourmet meat. I ordered the small size which I couldn't finish. The pizza was really good and if I have to be critical I was hoping for more tomato sauce being a deep dish. However  that's just my preference. As a side note the yelpers saying go to Pizza Hut!!! What are they thinking? I recently ordered Pizza Hut and I will never agin order from there. It doesn't compare.. They have the Black and Tan and it's the cheapest I've ever seen in any bar.
Andrea N.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,10,,11/29/2016,4.0,Just had dinner at the bar. Truth be told we prefer having a bite and a beer at the bar. The bartenders are always attentive and quick to offer a sample if you're confused about what beer to order. The woman next to us hadn't been there bf and got 3 small tastes so she could order a full beer and be happy with her order.  Anyway  we ordered the fried portabello strips which were so good!  The batter was light and the mushroom was not rubbery (which can happen easily) and the dip sauce was so delicate but tangy.  I ordered the hickory burger which was cooked to perfection(medium rare) and didn't need any additional sauce since the BBQ sauce and buttery brioche bun were perfectly matched on their own.  My husband got the late late night burger- a burger with a fried egg.  Also cooked perfectly and perfectly messy. I got the wedge fries (my favorite) and my husband got the skinny fries (his favorite).  My only complaint is that I had not enough room to eat all the food it was so good. Oh  and I drank their Jeremiah Red while the husband had the stout.  Their Red is a good easy beer to drink - not too strong but a good full bodied flavor.  Their stout was gorgeous  it had a beautiful waterfall as it settled - yet was not as strong as a Guinness and settled in your stomach a bit lighter  too. In other words it doesn't fill u up.
Doris P.,Miami  FL,0,18,2,2/4/2015,3.0,"Attended a birthday celebration on a Saturday night with 25 guests. When we arrived at the restaurant there was no reservation. We had spoken to several people at BJ\'s regarding this event. The manager took over and figured out a place to put the party. He was great. My only problem with the staff was the food came out a little at a time so we were not eating together. Also  the staff would come out and shout  ""who ordered the fish"" etc. for every plate served. Totally unacceptable. I asked several times for some bread for our table and the server ignored me. Food was good but not memorable. Fun time with friends and family  so that is all that counts."
Harry S.,Coral Springs  FL,154,227,65,6/11/2014,3.0,Was here last week if they fix a few quirks I would give them a higher rating. we got there during happy hour and was told if you want the happy hour prices for appetizer you need to sit in the bar area of find a place outside on the patio because its self seating. We chose to sit outside as we walked to the area we were stopped by a group of 3 servers and was told a hostess has to seat us We went back to the hostess stand and was told its self seating I then told the hostess she needs to walk over to the group of servers who stopped us from entering the patio area and discuss if its open seating or we need to be seated. After a 3 minute debate between them they decided it to have us sit down in the patio area that was complexly empty accept for one table being used.Just to let you know they food was quite good but them serving the appetizer  salad  and the entree all in a 3 minute period is down right stupid. I hope they get their act together because I would like to give them another try at it because I
Elizabeth P.,Miami Lakes  FL,290,222,287,5/17/2012,3.0,Awesome brewed beer! Service can be slow at times  though. The food is ok but not the reason I go there. It's definitely the beer!
Christopher G.,Hollywood  FL,8,23,,4/23/2015,1.0,"Pretty great setup here for watching the big game on a huge 108"" hd screen right at the bar...only problem is the manager won\'t take the TV off split screen so there\'s no sound and your forced to try and watch the game while 3 other channels are blasting you in the face with programming you couldn\'t care less about...it\'s annoyingly unbearable so I left at half time and finished my pizza at home...thanks a lot ...ordered the bjs favorite pizza and 2 beers. The pie was a bit dry since it had almost no sauce at all under the cheese. Go for food and drinks they\'re pretty good...don\'t expect any help from management if you want watch anything less than 4 channels on the big screen...thanks again and congrats on missing out on half my bar tab."
Jo W.,Miami  FL,177,335,1441,1/23/2013,3.0,BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse is the classic beer and pizza joint hidden in a casual dining restaurant chain. All in all  it is a pretty good place for an outing with friends or family.On tap  they have a selection of handcrafted micro brews. I am not the beer lover  so I passed  but my boyfriend tried their Tatonka Stout. It wasn't bad but ti didn't really stand out either. He wasn't impressed but it could have just been a matter of preference.If you only came here for a few drinks with friends and aren't looking to eat a big meal  BJ's has a bunch of snacks and small bites! We decided to try the Thai Style Chicken Wontons. The were right out of the fryer and steaming hot. They were very light and crispy. The filling was well seasoned and delicioso! I loved it.They are basically known for their deep dish pizzas so if its your first time here  I recommend you try one. We had the Spicy Meatball which consisted of housemade meatballs  spicy tomato sauce  Italian sausage  jalapenos  Parmesan cheese and red onions. It was scrumptious! Fresh  cheesy  crunchy crust and yummy! The only thing is I wouldn't label it a deep dish but rather a pan pizza.Even if you don't drink beer or for some odd reason don't enjoy pizza  you might want to still consider BJ's for their famous Pizookie. Imagine this  a freshly baked  hot out of the oven  rich and delicious cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and served in its own deep dish. Mmmm!!! I had to go with the Chocolate Chunk for the melty chocolate goodness  but they have other options and a trio sampler if you can't decide.It seems that they pride themselves on providing a quality experience. Our waiter was really nice and funny. He cracked a few jokes with us and made us laugh. However  although the entertainment factor was high  in actual performance he lacked. There were a few times we were left waiting and we had to ask for water refills. It go to a point where we had to ask another waiter. So  I see where they are going with the experience they seek to provide  but it needs improvement.I was pleasantly surprised with my experience and recommend you come. However  the restaurant does get packed at times and they don't take reservations  so I suggest that you call ahead for the wait time and put your name on the waiting list if necessary.
Jessica G.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,139,21,23,6/27/2014,4.0,"I love BJ\'s and have been a regular since they opened one in Pembroke Pines. I normally go for the amazing food Happy Hour  half off all appetizers and mini pizzas. Drink deals aren\'t anything special for Happy Hour  like a dollar off cocktails and $3 house wine. I normally order a few appetizers to munch on and a mini pizza or two (yes  I look like a lil\' piggy when everything comes out - no shame!).I highly recommend the Ahi Poke and the Avocado Egg Rolls. I\'ve ordered and eaten both as meals. Ask for extra Poke sauce on the side with the Ahi...the flavor is amazing! The reason for my four stars is the service. It is very slow at this time. For Happy Hour you have to sit specifically in the bar area. I\'ve stood beside a booth for 10 minutes waiting for it to be cleaned so I can sit down. Once sitting it took another 10 minutes for the waiter to come  introduce herself and ask for drinks. When food is brought out the waiters seem to disappear and if you need the anything more or the check you are again on the ""search"" for the waiter.As a frequent visitor I do have a favorite waiter who is the exception to what I wrote above. Her name is Jessica and she is wonderful! From her welcoming personality to her attention to detail she keeps me coming back. When I go  I look to see if she is working to make sure I sit at one of her tables. She remembers me and always greets me with a huge smile. I do recommend BJ\'s!"
Krisi M.,Austin  TX,29,38,63,4/22/2014,5.0,This Is my first time here. The wait staff is so friendly that it makes dining out a pleasure again! I had the ahi poke which was wonton chips with a ahi tuna and avocado salad and it was delicious. I also had their crafted soda in black cherry which was okay. My husband had the meat deep dish Chicago style which was okay but not the best. The atmosphere is great and I can't wait to come back!
Ernesto L.,Opa-locka  FL,3,5,2,9/14/2015,5.0,I LOOOOOOOOOOOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!I came here at least three times a month. There Porter Beer on Tap is my favorite of all their drinks. Mozarella Sticks  veggie pizza  and can't forget the PIZOOKIE!!!!!!! The staff is welcoming  friendly  and always ready to serve. Awesome spot to celebrate a birthday or just simply hangout! One word to summarize this place  AMAZING!
Lena S.,Hollywood  FL,0,12,,1/11/2014,2.0,"Mediocre food  not worth the price and service is so so. The only reason for two stars was the beer. Happy hour specials are only available if you sit at the bar  and if there are no tables available at the bar  you\'re S.O.L.We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table in the main dining room despite the fact that the place was half empty. Food came out quickly. Typical bar food. We ordered the calamari and the artichoke and spinach dip. Both were just ok. The boys each ordered a buffalo chicken pizza  which they said was good and pretty spicy. I ordered the ahi tuna salad which was decent and my girlfriend ordered an ""off the menu"" buffalo chicken salad which she enjoyed. We each had 3 beers and no dessert. The bill was almost $200.00! A bit pricey  in my opinion."
Eduardo V.,Miramar  FL,134,101,314,1/7/2015,5.0,ALWAYS GREAT SERVICE  ALWAYS GREAT FOOD!!!!! The only time we had a dull moment at this restaurant was on a holiday time and they did everything possible to make sure we were satisfied with everything..... Its great coming to BJ's because their menu is so extensive there is always something new to try.... Also their customer service and waiters/waitresses are top notch. Highly recommend trying the place out.
JoCat R.,Miami  FL,56,164,94,5/25/2014,5.0,Love this place! We come here all the time for happy hour and sit in the bar area. They have amazing happy hour specials and mini bites. We love the Jeremiah Red beer and the crispy artichokes with their amazing aioli. Yumm :)Their service is always great as well. And they have tv's everywhere!
Kay B.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,4,31,12,3/7/2015,5.0,I just found my new favorite restaurant. Will definitely be coming back. The food selection is great. My husband had the balsamic grilled chicken and I had the atlantic Salmon. Both were excellent. We also had the chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer. Best lettuce wraps ever! So tasty! There is so much more I want to try so we will be back. Highly recommend.
Evelyn R.,Miami  FL,24,14,,3/7/2014,2.0,I went to BJ's on a Thursday night for the first time  and I was greatly impressed by how good the place looks inside. The bar looks awesome and they had tons of good beer on tap. It was also very bright  had tons of tvs in good locations  and the hostess was super nice. That is about the only good thing I have to say about this place. The service was mediocre at best  and the food was awful.I ordered buffalo wings and fries  and my husband ordered a bison burger. The wings were tiny  undercooked  and chewy. The dish comes with ten wings  and I ate four. I only reached four because I was starving. I did not taste the bison burger  but my husband said it tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. I will give them credit for the fries. They were good. Needless to say  I will only go back if the only thing on my agenda is to watch a game and drink beer.
Tania R.,Pembroke Pines  FL,31,10,,1/2/2015,3.0,This restaurant has good appeal but the service always changes every time I go sometimes great sometimes poor. I really didn't like when the waiter brought out my appetizer and entree together. It's okay when the service is good.
Janine S.,Boca Raton  FL,36,91,20,5/30/2015,4.0,Omg omg ! Love this place for its eclectic menu. Today I ventured into honey sriracha Brussels sprouts and fried artichokes . Amazing ! Awesome combination of spices and crunch . And for dessert   one of my personal favs peanut butter s'mores . This is made with marshmallow fluff . To die for !
Armando O.,Miami  FL,2,9,,8/1/2015,5.0,Great place to eat and hang out. We've had different plates and they're consistently good! Great service! Love desserts! Try the pizookie!They offer a lot of different kinds of foods  really healthy  dinner  lunch specials  great burgers and pizzas. And draft beers.
Christian Z.,Hollywood  FL,43,11,,10/18/2015,4.0,5 stars if you're a Big beer connoisseur  and enjoy tasting unusual brews. Very grand  spacious sports themed restaurant with tasteful decor. I've been here three times in the last 6 months because of the incessant requests of my 11 year old daughter who loves the flatbread pizza here. It is otherwise good food and service. Nothing memorable enough for ME to want to return more frequently.
Marcos A.,Miami  FL,15,36,19,3/25/2015,4.0,Bj's is always a good solution for food especially when meeting people from business. I had a Mediteranean pizza which I love and I could not go wrong.
Ian O.,North Miami Beach  FL,79,84,69,6/7/2014,3.0,The interior is very spacious and it has that brewery industrial look. The bar is big and has plenty of beers on tap. They also have many spirits and wine to choose from as well. The food is tasty and fair priced. I gave them three stars because the service was slow seating us and once we sat down we didn't get a server for over 15 minutes. It was a Saturday at 430pm  not prime time. And the place was somewhat busy but not packed or wait times to sit down. I waived down a hostess and asked if we can get some service and she apologized and said that they were having a shift change. Ok  understandable. Then a server came promptly afterwards and apologized for the wait. Then it was sooth sailing from there out. Would I return? Yes  if I'm in the area  but I'm not going out of my way or anything.
Joan D.,Weston  FL,0,6,,5/13/2016,5.0,My husband and i had the baby back pork ribs and they were by far  the best ribs we have had anywhere. Love the large selection of sides!
Greg C.,Pembroke Pines  FL,0,5,4,10/14/2014,2.0,Stunningly mediocre! For a place with literally everything possible on the menu  our experience has been that it's edible. If you just want generic food with generic service in a very large place with lots of noise  this is the spot. Nothing was outright bad  nothing was outright good  it was all just very mediocre.We may visit again  although it will be with every expectation for very average uninspired and boring fare in loud crowded room with average (at best) service.
Morgan L.,Miramar  FL,3,8,,6/22/2015,1.0,So far not happy. Been waiting on drinks for 15 min which is absolutely ridiculous. Took 20 min for the food order
Aly P.,Boca Raton  FL,8,20,1,6/13/2015,1.0,"I felt something on me and found a huge roach! threw him off of me. He ran around for a bit before he went to the next table where they screamed about until one brave woman finally killed him. We told the waiter who got the manager. (The waiter was pretty bad too. Horrible service and he just walked away from us  he didn\'t care about his tables at all..) The manager basically believed I had brought it in the restaurant without noticing!!! He said and I quote ""well you just sat down so how do I know you didn\'t bring it in with you?"" I was sitting inside his restaurant for 15 mins before being seated. I\'m sure as hell would have noticed that big sucker on me earlier. He was rude  and didn\'t even compensate for the experience. Just gave me this face like ""ehh we don\'t have roaches. It\'s you"". He basically called me dirty. (For the record I showered before I went out) When my boyfriend tried to explain that there was proof of the dead roach  he ignored him and never had anyone clean up it up! The busters moved the tables around and cleaned the tabletop but never cleaned the floor. People were eating next to it. This was my first time here. NEVER AGAIN. and native Floridians know if you find one that big  there are more!! I refused to order food because if there is one in the dining room  who the hell knows what\'s in the kitchen. Nasty. Nasty. Nasty. I posted a picture of the dead roach - should notify the health inspector on them!! Don\'t eat there please  unless you don\'t care about your health."
Amanda S.,Nuremberg  Germany,170,100,191,12/27/2014,4.0,Service was friendly and efficient. The food was good. Honestly  it wasn't amazing  but good. The selection is huge for both food and drinks. The in house brewed beers we tried were all good!
James P.,Miami Lakes  FL,49,60,27,4/11/2014,4.0,We would come here frequently but had not been back in a lil over a month. Usually we have a white pizza since the miss loves it  but not on this trip. I was more in the mood for a few beers and some appetizers while we watched the heat game. As always the fried artichoke was awesome and we tried the new corn fritters  which were OK. We also ordered a flatbread with the pesto and added grilled chicken since there was no type of protein/meat on it.Everything was good as always  but i was a bit disappointed that I got too full to have my macadamian pizookie. (If you haven't tried it make sure you leave room for this great treat!)
Melanie V.,Hollywood  FL,9,4,,9/17/2015,5.0,I love this place. Especially their appetizers. Every time I go I have trouble picking out which one I want. :) Their egg rolls  calamari  mozarella sticks are always on the top of my list. I ate here about 2 weeks ago and ordered their ribs... oh my jesus. THE most amazing ribs I have ever eaten. I was in heaven. I always experience good service  sometimes a little slow but nothing to the point were I get impatient. I will keep coming back here  especially for those ribs!
Elie F.,Pembroke Pines  FL,9,48,8,2/10/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Okay  so.. This is my second review for this location and I had to give it 5 stars instead of 4 this time! Our server was Amy  she was amazing professional and very knowledgeable. My partner and I were celebrating our Valentine's Day early because we work on the actual day and chose BJ's because of their amazing beer and menu selection. We ordered to start some avocado egg rolls and stuffed mushrooms. They were so good we scarfed them in minutes. Then to our entrees: my partner (your average manly carnivore) ordered the full rack of ribs  asparagus and fries. I couldn't stop picking off his plate everything was so delicious. I was in the mood for some ahi tuna and ordered their seared ahi tuna salad.. Now  you never really hear anyone boast about how f*ckin tasty a salad is... But this salad was a tasty f*ckin salad.. I ate everything. Like. Everything. Now that we've completely pigged out we were like... Okay  desert time. Dude  this dang s'mores peanut butter brownie was (take a guess) Aaamaazing. Needless to say we had a fantastic dinner and can't wait to return!
Jessica F.,Coral Gables  FL,0,5,2,9/30/2016,1.0,I'm from Miami so I have my far share of bad restaurant experiences  I figured Broward was a little worse. I arrived with my son  elderly grandmother and my mother 3 woman and a toddler. We stopped there for a decent quick meal around 3pm more or less the restaurant was starting to full up quickly with customers when we were seating we slowly saw other tables getting filled which is not a big deal but when you are the first seated and your food has not arrived when other tables seated after you ate had dessert paid and are getting up to leave...there is an issue. We were there for nearly 3 hours!!! It was the longest wait of my life for good and mind to tell you we were a party of 3 and a toddler! The mac & cheese was the box crap people buy from the grocery store which you just add water and mix horrible!!! My sandwich was great I'm not sure if I was just delusional at that point I thought it was great  sadly I do not understand how tables around us (larger parties of 6!) seated after us ate their meals  desserts  paid and left the restaurant. Bottom line the worst waiter in all of history.
Tina V.,City of Industry  CA,313,448,653,12/20/2013,2.0,Its BJ  what more can i say.. Miami standard is horrible service....
Rob K.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,4,51,9,3/26/2015,4.0,This place is pretty good for a chain restaurant. It's nice  it's clean  service is pretty good. I went here with a party's of 10. One couple ordered a deep dish pizza. It was pretty good but I am old school. My Pie was the standard for deep dish in south Florida. This is no My Pie but it's pretty good. Their flatbread pizzas are very tasty. I had the shrimp scampi. I'm not really sure what to say about this classic shrimp and pasta dish. The waitress made a point to tell me that they make it with a more lemony flavor. Why would you do this to a classic dish. It wasn't bad  just unexpected. Prices are good appetizers are pretty good as well. My only real complaint would be the enormous size of the menu. 9 pages. To me that's excessive.
Brian C.,Pembroke Pines  FL,23,84,36,9/20/2011,5.0,Great food and service.Just opened yesterday. Lunch specials daily along with early happy hour (3-7) and late happy hour (10-close)Had the half flatbread with salad  which was a great portion for the price.The avocado egg rolls were excellent. Service was excellent  always walking around and asking if we wanted refills  etc.They have some great special brews  and also regular soda. The cream soda was great  homemade  and was actually healthy based on the ingredients!
Davina R.,Goodyear  AZ,146,12,27,5/19/2014,5.0,If you come to BJ's in Pembroke Pines  be certain to ask is there are any availabilities in Charlies section. Great server  personable  and clearly just on top of his game... Thx for being Awesome Charlie HiteDavina & Adelina
Melli B.,Pembroke Pines  FL,124,285,457,4/26/2012,3.0,So many beers! I really like this place. Great place to gather with friends to watch a Heat game  have a brew or two...or five and some decent food. The menu is great with lots of choices for everyone. Deep dish pizza  sandwiches  salads  and many different entree types! I have tried the pizza which was nice and thick! The shrimp tacos are good too. The Skinny Margarita was really nice! The environment is cool with a HUGE screen tv at the bar and more tv's thruout! The bartender that days was Allison! Really sweet  knowledgable of the menu  and efficient! I offer 3 stars because although the menu is better than most bar menu's  the food is decent but nothing to get excited about. But I will definitely go back. The menu is satifying and extensive! The environment is great!
Kevin D.,Hollywood  FL,71,64,6,4/12/2014,4.0,I went here on a 2nd visit  had the classic burger 8 oz with potato wedges as fries  it was excellent and perfectly cooked. It was happy hour after 10 pm all apps were 1/2 price including quite a few beers. The burger and 1 beer was $11 and change. Not bad for a late night food run.On my 3rd visit I had the turkey burger with the potato wedges  again it was excellent and another 1/2 price beer. The burger was about $8.50. This time my server was a bit slow as she catered on tables with 2 or more. Understandable but you can't ignore others. I will be going back as it's a good spot after 10pm when most places close.
Oland Z.,Hollywood  FL,0,17,1,6/15/2015,4.0,Love this place. Good size menu  with reasonable prices and tasty food. Great atmosphere. But the servers could be nicer.
Felicia R.,Hollywood  FL,154,297,231,4/6/2012,4.0,Love BJ's Brewhouse  the Jeremiah Red beer is awesome  the avocado egg rolls  the Tortilla soup and pizza are my favorite picks. I recently shared the basil tomato flat-bread and it was very good. Great place for large groups  the kids. on weekends the wait is pretty long  they do allow for your to call a few minutes ahead to put your name on the list.
Lourdes B.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,4,,4/1/2016,4.0,Wonderful wings & hamburgers...The best waitress is Angelica....we always make sure we ask for her...
Walter B.,Coconut Creek  FL,4,18,5,9/20/2014,1.0,"Nasty! Gross! Unsanitary! I was appalled when the server felt that it was perfectly okay to resolve the ""hair in my drink"" concern by simply transferring the contents to another glass! I refused the drink and decided to leave  but not before informing the manager. He pretended to care. Save your money and protect your health. If the server thought it was okay  it typically means that there is an unsanitary culture among the employees. No thanks!"
Haydi F.,Hollywood  FL,50,3,3,4/15/2015,3.0,The food is good but the service is really bad we had to wait almost 1 hr and a half for our food.
Kat T.,Plano  TX,13,87,15,7/8/2013,3.0,The food was good  the root beer made in house was also good.They had an allergen menu which was really great and I felt confident that even though the server was not well prepared to handle a person with food allergies  the kitchen seemed accommodating. I would return. The only reason for 3 stars is because it took a while to get service once seated and the appetizer must have been flown in and the plane was delayed. It took nearly 30 minutes but it was good and they brought the salads in the meantime. I'd also urge them to have a diary free pizza. I hear the pizzas are great but with a dairy allergy  I couldn't try them. At least have a soy cheese  dairy free crust option. It wouldn't be that hard and would be a good seller. Another reason for 3 stars is due to the overcooking of the steaks. By the time the refire comes out  dinner is over. You have to ask to get something comp'd for the mistake and they only discount the dinner slightly. I'd like to see the steaks cooked properly more often.But the bathrooms were filthy  I left and went somewhere else to use the bathroom. Ewww.
Robert R.,Miami  FL,9,85,64,10/6/2014,2.0,"BJ\'s is one of my favorites  great locations  good facilities and lots of options in the menu... and then they make the common mistake! FAKE! ""Freshly Squeezed Lemonade"". For real! Something so simple! Now it makes me wonder  what else is fake. Tortilla checked soup! with hardly any Tortilla... Really! Is this only Penbroke Pines?"
Kerrie M.,Deerfield Beach  FL,28,72,3,9/8/2013,5.0,"Amazing beer  a good gluten-free selection  awesome salads and burgers  and excellent service! This place is new to Coral Springs  so it is still pretty consistently busy  and a pretty consistent wait  so this was my first time visiting. We went on a Sunday for an early lunch  and did not need to wait too long! Our group had several special considerations  like a gluten-sensitivity  and an extremely picky youngster. Our server  Jamal (I think)  was fantastic! He was super-helpful and catered to all of our odd requests without any trace of irritation  and really went out of his way to make sure everyone was happy with their food and their beverages. It was probably the best service I have received in the area from a restaurant that did not fall into the high-end category (think The Capital Grille). The drink selection was fantastic! The handcrafted root beer was the best I had tasted in a long time. My daughter had the orange cream soda  and it was perfect. If you are a beer fan  the selection of BJ\'s craft beers well worth the visit. The Jeremiah Red was excellent  even though I am more of a stout drinker. I had the P.M. Porter  and was blown away! It was porter-perfection...The food was delicious. I am picky about Cesar salads  especially the dressing. The dressing was perfect here! They used just enough to accent  and did not drown the salad in it. I had the chicken in mine  and it was delicious and juicy. A friend let me taste the Cesar with seared rare ahi tuna  and it was possibly better than the chicken. The gluten-free pizza came with a choice of toppings (per their menu  any of their many ""classic"" pizza toppings except their housemade meatballs are gluten-free!) and my daughter had blackened chicken on hers  and loved it! My other daughter was a fan of the classic burger  and the youngest member of the group loved the Mini Corn Dogs! In all  I was quite impressed with BJs. While the long line in front will probably continue to dissuade me from coming here too often (I rarely have the forethought to call ahead)  I will likely be back here... Soon!"
Ivette R.,Miami  FL,268,1048,251,9/28/2014,5.0,This BJ'S BREWHOUSE opened up in the old On the Border location.The place closed and building was demolished and so they built this place.I had lunch with my son and triplet nephews today the place was packed and out the door but trust me it's worth the wait our waitress was nice and our food was great they're spinach artichoke dip with mozzarella sticks are awesome especially with the side of nachos and the main thing is their pizza I love it this Pembroke Pines BJ'S is awesome.I've been to other locations and so far this is the best one.
Lesbia B.,Hialeah  FL,0,2,,6/13/2015,2.0,The waiter did not get the order right and left one of my daughters out; but that was not all  all of a sudden a roach was flying on our table and the table next to us....I basically had to kill it so it would not bother anybody else ....disgusting!!!!!
Frank M.,Hialeah  FL,5,189,55,2/11/2015,3.0,Service was great super friendly. Now  we order the Chicago deep dish pizza what a disappointment. It was more like a pizza hut with a thick dough.
Sara M.,Washington  DC,512,357,36,1/28/2013,2.0,"I wavered between 2 and 3 stars on this one  I just didn\'t think BJ\'s was a good as I thought it would be. I don\'t know if my expectations were too high or perhaps they were just having an off night  not sure. I came here for dinner with my family on Sunday night where we called ahead since they don\'t take reservations. When we got there around 7:30pm  we still had to wait about 25 minutes for a table and it seemed the regular wait time was about double that. Fine  no big. After we were seated  it took about 5 minutes for our waitress to make it to our table for drink orders. I was very tempted by their drink menu. Not only do they have some really good looking beers which they brew themselves (hence the name BJ\'s Brewhouse) but they also had layered beers and ciders which were calling my name  not to mention house made sodas. Alas  I stuck with water  but my brother in law ordered a beer and my sister ordered the creme soda  so at least I would get to sample. My brother in law\'s beer came out first  delivered by a different waiter  and then the rest of the drinks took about 10 minutes to make it to the table which is way too long. When it came to placing my order there was a bunch of items on the menu that looked good to me. They just about cover the board with their options  from salads to burgers to sandwiches  and their specialty- pizza. Prices are mid range  about $14 for a salad  $11ish for sandwiches  etc. I settled on the crispy chicken sandwich which comes with either thin cut fries or potato wedges  I got the wedges. My mom ordered the pulled pork sandwich and then was told that they were out which was a bummer for her since that is one of her faves. I really have to question when a restaurant of this size runs out of something. Maybe they couldn\'t handle the extra demand that stemmed from the Chili Cookoff which was that day  but again  management should have planned better for it. Anyhow  after orders were placed and drinks were delivered  we waited about 20 minutes when our waitress came by and asked us how everything was. We all kind of stared at her with blank faces.. ""uuum  the water is good..?"" We had yet to see our food and wouldn\'t for about another 15 minutes. I\'ve had worse wait times for food  but 35 minutes is too long for this kind of place. My mom\'s food came out first  she subbed the pulled port for a brisket sandwich  which apparently didn\'t come with any sides. No one else\'s food came out for a good 5 minutes following which is one of my personal taboos. My crispy chicken sandwich was just okay. It was not a chicken breast like I was expecting  but rather two sandwiches  each which had a chicken finger in the middle. It was okay  but somewhat dry. The wedges were good though  not as good as the magicalness of KFC potato wedges  but tasty. On top of my mom\'s food coming out before anyone else\'s  there were a few other small mishaps: When I ordered my sandwich  I asked to replace the honeymustard with ranch  which was not there when my food was delivered. Also  my sister ordered the thin cut fries with her meal and received wedges instead. The veggies on my mom\'s plate were raw- raw onions  carrots and celery. really? raw onion? My sister really enjoyed her chili burger which was HUGE and my brother in law said his spicy meatball pizza was good but very very spicy. I also sipped my sister\'s creme soda  orange/creme soda and the black cherry. The orange was a bit strange and we all agreed it left a funny taste in our mouths. The black cherry and creme soda were both really good. If the food here was better  I would have probably given them 3 stars. Yes  the service stunk and was slow  but it could have just been our waitress and the rest of the team could be stellar  who knows? The best chance of me coming back to this place would be to sit at the (fully stocked) bar and grab a drink  but I don\'t think I\'ll be revisiting for the food."
Tara B.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,1053,48,70,1/24/2012,3.0,After driving by BJ's daily and avoiding it mainly because at night it looks like a mad house with packed parking lot and line out the door (and I soooo hate waiting in line forever) I did stop in the afternoon with my kids and there was next to nobody in there! It was PERFECT for me! No crowd  no noise  no line  no waiting!They have lunch specials until 3 pmOf course it was right after 3 when we got there!Server was great  fun  personality and extremely attentive to our needs.If you drink  they have like 6 pages of beer/wine in the menu.The desserts are made at the time of order and are yummmy.See some of the pics I'm going to upload of the Pizookie Trio dessert along with calamari which was lightly breaded and not oily  greasy like other places. The dipping sauces were perfect.My son had the cajun pasta and thought they over seasoned it though  all he could taste was the seasoning and the chicken was bit dry.My daughter had the jambalaya and pretty much same thing...over seasoned  but still decent.I had the overstuffed potato with chicken & broccoli with alfredo sauce and it was the biggest danged potato I've ever seen.We eyed a few other things we would like to try so we'll be going back...but not during the dinner/weekend rush though.
Michael S.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,291,413,457,10/16/2011,4.0,"Heard good things about this place so we decided to check it out. I feel like most ""chain"" restaurant are overrated but this one was completely different. I used the call ahead service before we arrived. When we got there I couldn\'t believe how busy it was. This place was popping and people were everywhere! We actually had to wait in line just to get to the hostess. She gave us a buzzer and said we\'d be called soon. I am very glad we did the call ahead  the wait was around seventy minutes. Fifteen minutes later the buzzer went off and we were ushered to our table. Our server was very friendly and always checking on us. I ordered one of the beers they make in-house and the mini tacos to start. The beer was in a big glass and it was very GOOD. And the chicken tacos that were brought out were amazing. My date ordered fish and chips and I ordered the california chicken sandwich. Both dishes were big and delicious. I can\'t say good enough things about our meal. The food paired with excellent service came together to make an awesome dinner. All the food plus the beer came out to under 40$ which is awesome in my book. Iwill definitely be coming back here! Tips: use call ahead service for shorter wait time!"
Charles D.,Hollywood  FL,0,2,,5/21/2016,1.0,First  let me start by saying it as a Friday night and due to the amount of people waiting we didn't expect exceptional service. We ended up getting a table in the bar so we didn't have to wait long. We were very impressed by the variety on the menu but choices does not constitute good food. We ordered drinks and appetizers first and it started of the artichoke and spinach dip came out cold. They fixed it and we were enjoying the ambience. We decided to order our meals and we ordered a ribeye dinner w brussels sprouts and rice and the turkey burger upgraded with the wedge salad. The wedge was good however it came out before my food. The food arrived and what they were advertising on the menu as a ribeye they delivered a large sirloin and insisted it was a ribeye. If anyone knows their steaks  a ribeye is a totally different cut of meat than that of a sirloin. A ribeye is round the fat running through with a tenderloin cap around the other side of the fat  by far the most flavorful steak due to the fat that runs through the meat. A sirloin has the fat that trims the outside of the steak and is a much cheaper cut of meat. So we told our server that you must have accidentally ordered me a sirloin  no worries  just make sure that you only charge me for the sirloin. Oh I'm sorry sir but that is the ribeye our sirloin is smaller in portion. The server walked off without saying anything. We were sitting there wondering okay should we keep eating or should we wait. About 10 minutes later  the manger Scott who was very cocky but didn't want to argue probably bc he knows what the restaurant is server their customers. The manager says my sirloins are 5 oz an my ribeye are 14 oz. To which we replied  thats fine but then this is just a bigger sirloin and portion size doesn't determine the cut of meat....We asked so are you telling me this is a ribeye. He replied I dont argue with customers. He wouldn't answer and he tried to quickly to rectify the situation by asking what else do you want. We said thats bc there is nothing to argue about  this is a sirloin. Just charge me for what you served. He walked away without saying anything. At this point  we were treated like we were the problem and we were ignored simply by bringing it to their attention that they are advertising and selling sirloins as ribeyes on the menu=false advertisement. We are foodies and we frequent nice restaurants and we know the DIFFERENCE. It was an insult. We asked for nothing for free and we could have complained about how long the food took  the brussel sprouts were under par  the turkey burger was ok came out separate than the side salad it was supposed to be served with and without the dijon. We waited 15 minutes for the dijon to come  by that time we were disgusted by how we were treated by management we asked for our bill. The server came to the table and said so I suppose you don't want a to go box. We said no thank you  HE REPLIED FAIR ENOUGH.  WE got our check was charge for the sirloin and full price for everything and left 15% gratuity. We were not apologized to and WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!!! Listen  people we didn't want anything for free but at least acknowledge! Any restaurant manager should know their cuts of meat. Its basics. Hopefully this post forces them to serve what is advertised. I challenge anyone to order their ribeye and you be the judge. ITS SIRLOIN!!!!!
Sean R.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,156,162,89,12/5/2013,1.0,Not a fan of this BJs. I received horribly slow service from my waitress Gaby. Not just for the food  but for the drinks as well!! 15 minutes for a draft beer?!?!My burger was cooked medium as requested  but all juice had been squeezed out and it was dry. But not quite as dry as the wedge cut fries!! They were like eating sand. They also forgot my toppings on my burger.I've been to multiple BJs restaurants before and this was by far the worst. I will not return!!!
Monica T.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,51,111,47,10/17/2013,1.0,Ok so tonight I stumbled upon bj's since its pretty close to my boyfriend's house and wondered why we haven't dine here in a while. Now I remember. I've been here 2x previously when they first opened. Food was meh- nothing to write home about and tonight was most certainly the case. We decided to give them another try just to see if things improved.We started out with the berry cider and a Long Island. Had to send back the long island because it was too sour and tasted like juice. Berry cider was ok  not the best cider I've had. We know that they are famous for their pizza and we've had it before so we wanted to try something different so we got the Hawaiian mahi and the pot roast. Bad idea.First of all  our server was very friendly but truthfully service was way to slow for a weds night. When the food finally came out  it looked pretty disappointing. The mahi had no flavor what so ever  there were charred bits from the dirty stove and the whole dish was bland and unappetizing. The pot roast was too saucy and salty. The only good part about that dish was the mash potatoes. Worst of all  I had found a little hair on my fish!!!Ok so we were pretty much done with the meal when we saw the bill  close to fifty dollars for 2 drinks and 2 disgusting dishes. And I'm not usually one to complain.Mind you the Long Island was 10 freakin dollars. The only reason I left one star was because the server was polite. Avoid at all costs unless you stick with their pizza  which is average at best and their beers.
Andy B.,Naples  FL,16,60,5,4/15/2013,2.0,Clearly this location is VERY poorly managed and staffed. I've been to the BJ's in Orlando  FL and have never experienced any issues with food and service like I have the past 2 times I've frequented their Pembroke Pines location. On my last visit  I asked for an appetizer which got to the table about 35 minutes after the order was placed. The dish came out cold and pasty. The lunch was the same: all of our meals tasted lukewarm. My best guess is that they did not coordinate the order correctly. Drinks were rarely refilled  even though there was plenty of waitstaff hanging around idly by the front door of the restaurant. Clearly there is plenty of room for improvement at this location.
Diana C.,Hialeah  FL,41,7,3,2/22/2016,5.0,Great food & service! The guests that came with me were so impressed with the rewards program that I have with you that they also signed up!
Ashley J.,Pembroke Pines  FL,0,7,1,1/13/2016,1.0,Horrible service ! Took a hour and a half to receive my food   people that came in after me received their food BEFORE me and the food wasn't even worth it ! to add to the fire  members of my party didn't even receive their food despite the hour and a half wait! The calamari was soggy and the shrimp and asparagus dish was horrible ! Complete waste of time   I sent my food back and will NEVER come here again nor recommend this place ! The waitresses don't care and obviously were not prepared and unable to cover several tables for a large party. People  you're better off dining inside McDonald's !
Malia H.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,2,,8/6/2016,3.0,I was excited to try this place because I have been looking for deep dish pizza in South Florida for a long time and someone recommended this place to me and said they had it. I do like the atmosphere of this place and the location was pretty easy to find. For appetizers I got the chips guacamole and salsa and that was pretty good and then I actually was very excited to try the deep dish pizza. I ordered sausage and pepperoni and I was not that impressed. The crust was good but it was really not deep dish pizza it was more like a Pizza Hut type taste to it the sauce was very sweet and the cheese tasted very good but I just could not get past the sauce. The crust was good I wish it had been more deep dish like I thought but hey it wasn't horrible I just don't think that I would go to this place again and order the pizza. For dessert I did get some sort of cookie with vanilla ice cream on top and that was amazing I do have to get for thumbs up well actually stars for that that was really really good. I think next time that I come back I'll just try to order something different because normally I don't trust Pizza in a place that doesn't specialize in it but I heard so many good reviews but I thought I would give it a try. I really wanted to like it but I think I'll stick to Giovanni's or Unos for deep dish pizza while in Florida.
Veronica J.,Miami  FL,789,191,1325,2/11/2013,4.0,I love this place for happy hour. You can't beat the $3.00 glasses of wine and half off appetizers and individual pizzas and flatbreads.
Denver E.,Hollywood  FL,221,321,378,6/21/2015,3.0,I have been going to BJ's for a couple of years now and the first thing that comes to mind is consistency. It has always been the roughly the same general experience each time I go. In some places  that is a drag  but for this restaurant  it works well. BJ's is a big place with many tables  lots of big screens  and even some outdoor seating. As far as the menu  it's big. I mean binder book big  and oddly enough  that works here. I have had the fish tacos and they were ok.. but I think their pizzas are way better. My favorite part of BJ's actually isn't the food  but instead their beer selection  made in their own brewery. If I were to suggest beers  hands down the best three are the Brewhouse Blonde (a very nice pale Kolsch style beer)  Jeremiah Red (my personal go-to  a nice malty red number) and Tatonka Stout (an exceptional stout that seriously just gets better everytime I drink it). Service has always been great here  and the one time I ever sent something back  they were bending over backwards to make good. The only reason that I give it 3 stars instead of four is because the food is a bit mediocre  especially when compared to the quality of the beer and I feel like it can be a bit pricey. I will tell you though  if you are looking for a good spot to grab a pizza and a beer or three  BJ's is a good spot.
Natalia F.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,21,,6/4/2014,3.0,This place could have so much potential. Me and my boyfriend totally gave up on this place. The service is the slowest I have ever experienced every single time I have been there which I'd say is about 7 or 8 times. And it's pretty expensive for average food. Prices don't bother me but for average food and terrible service I don't think its worth it
MickeyBlue I.,Hollywood  FL,221,666,3068,11/25/2012,1.0,Went once  never returned. If you wanna drink I am sure this place rocks! But any sober person will know the food sucks. They invested a lot in the appearance factor but forgot to hire quality chefs  the menu is big not really eye catching. I'm surprised they're still in business.
Nicole T.,Hollywood  FL,1,6,10,3/29/2014,2.0,No flatware  sticky menu  one napkin per person  and it goes downhill from there. So what exactly did I get for $34.98 let me explain. Our waiter was obviously young and inexperienced and not properly trained. We ordered an appetizer plates of avocado rolls and two pina coladas. Worst pina colada I've ever had in my existence! It taste like tap water mixed with remnants of what might have once been a coconut. The waiter was courteous enough to switch our drinks at no charge and the second round was definetly a winner. I had a strawberry splash not sure what's in it but it was yummy. My bestie had a strawberry margarita she gave it 5 stars. The avocado rolls were pretty good but it just did not wow me. Overall  I give the entire experience a 2. 1 point for my drink and 1 point for my besties drink that equals 2. We have no plans of ever returning not even with a free gift card!
David W.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,156,175,339,11/26/2012,4.0,"In the area and saw this place. Any place that calls itself a ""Brewhouse"" requires an investigation and I am happy to report that BJ\'s has passed its initial test.  Yes  they have beer here. Not just your everyday brands but there own home brew. Nine different varieties from a light to dark creamy stout. All very drinkable with the Piranha pale ale and the Hopstorm IPA topping my list. I recommend ordering a flight  aka sampler  which consists of 8 healthy sized samples and choosing your own personal favorites. As for the food  everything ordered in my party was eaten with gusto. I myself had the Piranha Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger. Not the healthy minded fair I usually order but chili made with beer poured over a 1/2 pound burger served open faced. I just had to try and happily so. Other items worth mentioning are the flat bread pizzas and the Tuscan tomato bisque soup in a toasted sourdough bread bowl. This placed rocked on my first visit and I will be back to drink more beer and try more of the menu. So to sum it up  yes I do very much think you should give this place a try. You may even find me here sampling more beer. Join me  Cheers"
Lolo F.,Hollywood  FL,0,27,,8/19/2014,2.0,The place is attractive but the service was beyond slow. What you get for the price is not enough. I would go again if someone else was treating or I had a gift card but not if I had to pay. No one should have to wait 45 minutes for a simple order  nothing special & the place was not busy.
Aisha M.,Pembroke Pines  FL,213,51,16,9/20/2014,5.0,I was so excited about this place opening up in my town. Each time I visit family in Dallas  BJs was a must! So you can imagine how excited we were when we didn't have to take a flight to eat here. To start  menu is huge so everyone will always find something for their taste buds. I usually order cheese sticks  some fruity drink salad and pizza and to top it all off a pazooki! I love that this place is open till late even on the weekdays. You will not regret coming here
Michelle C.,Pembroke Pines  FL,62,89,33,1/30/2013,4.0,This is a great place to go in a group. There is so many different choices on the menu that there's something for everyone.Food was good  nice presentation and great service.
Jacqueline N.,Hollywood  FL,0,8,1,7/14/2014,1.0,Worst service I've ever had! Food came out cold. Manager was clueless! I'll never go back! My husband and I went there right when it opened and it was good. Not really sure what happened! Hopefully they pull it together because the foods not half bad when the chef is good. Management really needs to step it up and hire some good servers. I've been a server and know it's not the hardest job. Especially when you only have one table! Would not recommend this place to anyone!
Kerry O.,Clifton  VA,288,36,1,8/27/2012,4.0,Delicious beers  yummy food and a casual atmosphere!Was in town visiting some friends and they brought me here. We tried a pleathera of the small bites that were delicious. The mac and cheese was to die for  the bruschetta was amazing  the avocado egg rolls were warm and delicious.I was not a huge fan of my dish (the Cajun pasta). It was a little bland and didn't have much to it. My girlfriend ordered the Parmesean crusted chicken and it was to die for. I was extremely jealous and kept sneaking bites off her plate! Her husband got the chicken club and loved it. Didn't try it  but I'm gonna take his word for it. For dessert we got the Red Velvet Cookie thing. I'm not normally a sweets person  but this was delicious. We were all fighting for the last bites. The wait staff was very helpful and warm. It was overall a great experience minus my main dish. Could have just been an off night.
Vero D.,Miami  FL,26,60,11,11/30/2012,5.0,Bj's is by far one of my favorite places to go to around my area. The good is great my favorite thing would have to be the Chicken Parmesian Crusted Chicken  if you have yet to try this then you are truyly missing out. Large area can porb host any type of party. They do have tv's around the bar area. They also brew there own beer which is pretty darn cool since we do not something like that around the area. the Pale Ale is my all time favorite for beer and they have a Cadallac martini that is pink and taste delicius  be carefull they will creep up on you! ha The service is not the best but ive had worse and ive had better  I have been approx 15times and like 2-3 times it has been bad service. Overall it is a nice place with a nice vibe  everyone should check it out! Oh and P.S you can call ahead to hold a table!
Bindia K.,Asheville  NC,77,85,11,8/10/2012,4.0,Ok so I def shouldve taken pictures.  The staff are just friendly or maybe its because went for lunch lol. My sisters and I got a bottle of Santa Margarita Pinot Grigio for half off... 2 pints of their berry cider for 7 bucks.. and two mini deep dish pizzas (the buffalo chicken is really good and mild PLUS how can you go wrong with a classic deep dish) and we shared a santa fe salad which we subsituted mixed greens instead of romaine. The food came out in a timely manner but again we went during lunch.I really liked the food and I am super picky AND I was in FL for a couple of days so I couldnt come back. For dessert we had ...wait I need to CAP this ...the BAKED BEIGNETOMG I havent had a beignet since cafe du monde and this was not cafe du mondes yummy version BUT it was amazing in its own way. Especially since it was baked.. My sisters and I fought for the last piece and wanted another for each.PS the discounts were because we came in during lunch.
Debby S.,Hollywood  FL,45,18,33,10/12/2014,5.0,Great place to watch football! 1/2 price appetizers and small pizzas during all NFL games and $1 off cocktails in the bar area  too! The wait staff is super busy but manages to keep everything under control.
Jannine A.,Hallandale Beach  FL,4,40,12,10/6/2014,4.0,This was our first visit to this place . They have a great menu with a lot of things to choose from. The beer selection was also good. Prices are ok and the food is delicious and portions are big. We really like the hamburguer which are made with real beef. We didnt give a 5 star just because the service was a little slow and it took more than 25 min to get our food. Eventhough this...we will defintly come back again to try other food
Jorie M.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,45,33,3,11/1/2014,2.0,Really  really slow service!!! I really wanted to love BJs. As far as chain restaurants go  it is a pretty facility with a great menu--something for everyone from kids to dieters to anyone seeking traditional sports bar fare. But the service is horrible! And the food is just OK. Not bad  but not worth 45 minutes.
Victoria W.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,3,2,1/11/2014,4.0,"This place is good for a laid back night out  especially for their drink selection. I like coming here  but the service is not always consistent. This week they were incredibly fast  but one time I came for lunch and it took two hours. There were only two of us and we did get dessert and an appetizer  but that\'s ridiculous for lunch service. Their ""enlightened menu"" is worth it if you are watching calories. The maui glazed pork chop is really good (I\'ve had it twice) and it has never been dried out  which sometimes happens to pork. Jeremiah Red Ale and the Pink Caddilac are worth a try if you are looking for a good beer or a mixed drink.  The deep dish pizza is good too."
Beto D.,San Francisco  CA,148,128,13,6/21/2014,4.0,My wife and I were looking to have a few drinks  decent dinner  and TV's to watch soccer - check  check  check. We walked in and were seated almost immediately and most importantly  our server was on point. Our food was delicious (NY Strip Steak  The Brew Burger  and a couple of appetizers)  drinks were good (Nutty Bruenette & top shelf margarita). The turnaround time was fast and TV's were stratigically placed throughout the restaurant - good vantage points from most seats in the restaurant. The only reason it does not get five stars is that it was just a little pricey - a few dollars over what I was expecting for a brew house. I will be back - good atmosphere for the World Cup - Enjoy.
Aleena G.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,1,2,,10/10/2015,1.0,Horrible horrible service. Food was average/ not even hot. Our order for an appetizer was a simple Caesar salad no dressing and they got that wrong twice. HORRIBLE customer service- would not return due to staff not respecting customers time. This was also the second time I went- just to give them another chance.
Tara E.,Pleasant Valley  NY,11,11,,9/8/2014,4.0,Our server was so nice. Maybe this place read the yelp reviews because she seemed a little overly paranoid with making sure we were happy. We had excellent service and wonderful food. The garlic parmesan wings were amazing.
Al A.,Beverly Hills  CA,18,525,9,5/21/2012,2.0,It was a touch expensive given the quality of the food  but the quantity was sure there. I'm amazed I finished my plate!They have a tasty homemade selection of beers but a terrible selection of hard alcohol. The line was extremely long (60mins!).The atmosphere sorta sucked given the open pit design. It was LOUD. The washrooms were clean and well lit. Service suffered due to poor training of the staff. The menu was interesting as it was clear they weren't afraid to mix it up.
Hector R.,Hollywood  FL,2,10,8,3/29/2015,5.0,Michael LaGuardia is the man! Ask him to help your table. He helped customize our meals  made the best recommendations  and even admitted to a mistake in pizza size. But he accommodated our table with salads to help the wait time. He nailed it!
MiMi V.,Weston  FL,8,57,41,3/27/2012,1.0,This amusingly named restaurant is apparently an offshoot of Cheesecake factory. Big warehouse feel with loud crowded dining room. Had never been before and have driven by numerous times. Decided to try with a friend. Big mistake. Food was lousy  oversalted  greasy and lacking in flavor. Started with spinach/artichoke dip which had no flavor and served lukewarm. Had spaghetti and meatballs. Sauce was sparse and oversalted  meatballs were dry and overcooked. Service was terrible. Perhaps  I'm a snob or old world but when did waiters stop picking up dishes as they go? Had appetizer and salad and waiter never picked up even after I neatly and pointedly stacked at edge of table. Had to repeatedly ask for things (mayo  refills  ketchup  fork). I didn't even bother tipping. Will not be bothering. Seriously  can't Pembroke Pines do better?
Esther B.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,344,331,,4/4/2012,5.0,"I love this place! So totally Cali. It was one of those ""clueless where to go for dinner"" nights. The strategy: just drive. The requirements: someplace I haven\'t Yelped yet. BJ\'S let\'s try that. Hubby immediately agrees. Wonder why? Driving up I\'m thinking this is gonna be three stars (yelping begins in the parking lot now). But wait  this place looks pretty cool. Walking in...maybe this will be a 4 if the great taste in decor carries into the menu. Checking out the menu...OMG I want everything! We ordered 3 small plates:1. Tuna Poke. Amazing  fresh  simple yet absolutely delicious. Ordering this again for sure whenever I come here! Cubed tuna and avocados over a bed of cabbage slaw  with the most delicious light and zesty sauce that was barely there  but oh so perfect. This was served with some flaky  cracker type ummm...thingies (thingies=I can\'t describe these) that were just the right texture.2. Meatballs. This tapas style dish  along with several others in this section of the menu are small and inexpensive  which is great if you\'re into menu sampling and want to try a few things. Great flavor. Nice dish.3. Fried artichokes. An old favorite  done better than most other places. I\'m guessing bread crumbs were Panko  but they were seasoned  so you had crunch AND flavor. I love adding lemon to artichokes  but the sauce they served it with was nice and light and pretty good. Another winning dish makes the score three for three.Outside seating is great. Large  covered patio. They don\'t take reservations  but they do have call ahead seating. Mid-week visit was no wait  but I understand weekends are a completely different story  so CALL. The menu here is pages long (a la Cheesecake Factory)  varied  and inventive. Deep dish pizza is a house specialty. So is their famous dessert called ""pizookie"". Can\'t wait to try both and write an update. Oh  just one more thing...am I the only one who finds it funny that this place should end up in front of Dick\'s? I\'m just sayin\'..."
Jessica B.,Miami  FL,247,257,,7/10/2012,2.0,Went with my bff to pembroke mall and decided to try BJ's. Had read the reviews in Foursquare but decided to come anyways. Well have to agree with them. Came in and sat right away but the food took almost hour and the restaurant not even packed. Place is nicely decorated and the atmosphere is great. The food on the other had was bland and dry. We started with the stuffed mushrooms as appeitzers which was the best plate i had there then I had the plate with the maui pork chop (dry) and it came with red potatoes which i switched for a vegetable medley (dry) (flaovrless) and green beans  i had to ask for tartar sauce to give it some taste. My bff ordered the balsamic chicken (dry also) with white cheese mashed potatoes which were good.Overall i would say that i probably wont come unless in the area which i never am.
Valarie S.,Hollywood  FL,0,3,,12/7/2014,2.0,Just finished Sunday afternoon late lunch here. Very disappointing. Ordered sirloin steak  medium rare  horseradish mashed potatoes and steamed green beans. The beans were the best part of the meal. The steak had a very dry  coarse texture and needless to say  was tough. The outside was over seasoned and over seared. The mashed potatoes had waaay too much horseradish and a strong vinegar taste. Don't get me wrong  I LOVE horseradish  especially with beef  but it was just too much. I left half of the potatoes and 2/3 of the steak on the plate. The restaurant was comfortable and the menu extensive. I will try it again  but for something more casual. This meal was a huge miss for me. The service was great.
Jamie F.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,5,,10/10/2012,1.0,Strike three.. BJs is out!1st time- walked out: 10 mins b4 server even got to table2nd time- waited too long for slow service3rd time- poor service & got order wrongI love the menu and had outstanding service at the BJs in Dallas TX don't know what is wrong with this PPines crew.
James G.,New York  NY,0,2,,9/12/2014,4.0,Loved this place. Very friendly and accommodating front of house staff. Our waiter specifically was not only funny but provided an honest opinion on the menu. You certainly can't go wrong with the pizza  and while I'm sure all of the toppings are good  our chicken bacon ranch was delicious. The new Salted Caramel pizzookie was arguably the best part of the meal.
Tony B.,Caldwell  ID,0,3,,8/28/2014,1.0,I am a loyal BJ's customer because of the Texas BJ's. The BJ's on Pines Blvd is a disgrace. I have tried this one five times now and each time the service was Horrible  unfriendly  slow and rude. Food was mostly consistent with others and very good. I quit going because it was not good bad the steakhouse next door was superior in every way. I returned against my better judgement because my daughter flew into town and loves the food there. Big mistake. Not only is the service worse and tactless but now the food has gone down hill. The crusted parm chicken white sauce was gross. Oily  separated and sour. Unfortunately this eatery will not be on my list again. 5 strikes and your out. The longhorn steak house has both lunch and dinner that is worth the money both in taste and service.
Candy C.,Hollywood  FL,20,83,234,4/26/2012,3.0,New local neighboorhood restaurant/bar. Good environment and the food is good. Great place to go to if you're not sure where to go but don't want to travel far or make lunch/dinner plans too difficult. I recommend the Avocado eggrolls !!! (Nothing like Chili's)... the avocado filling is smooth and plentiful. The miso salmon was good but not the best miso I've had. One plus is the salmon was cooked just right. Not dry and not raw. The portions are very large. I would recommend visiting this restaurant for lunch/dinner. P.S. One downside is the long wait (as with all the main restaurants in the area during weekend dinner time). So go with a small group and sit at the bar for immediate seating!!
Stephen G.,Hollywood  FL,30,2,1,4/2/2015,1.0,Gave them 2 chances to get my wife a steak that wasn't overcooked. The second time they actually microwaved and then charred a steak in order to serve my wife. Told them to take it off the bill they did then as we are getting ready to leave they bring us another steak. Utensils were filthy. The waitress was ok but seemed overwhelmed with her tables. Whoever the guy with long hair was just dropped off plates and walked off even as we were telling him it was wrong. The ribs i had were good. Perhaps the rib cook should teach the steak cook a thing or two. Bathroom was horrendous. Other diners were complaining about food quality as well. 3 for 3 as far as failing to get anywhere near our simple expectations. Management needs to shake things up a little there or perhaps be part of the shake up. Was not happy at all. Don't waste your money there. The afternoon staff seems to have their stuff together. The location in Doral is totally opposite of this place go there if you must. I told a server that my silverware was dirty and she.took them and never showed up again.
Monica C.,Miami  FL,179,216,92,1/4/2012,1.0,Fellow Pembroke Pine Neighbors! I know that there isn't much to eat in our hood BUT an hour wait for a table really? Come on!! I have gone twice to this place and each time they have had an hour wait. Mind you I have NEVER gone on a Friday or Saturday. The last time I went was on a Monday night. An hour wait on a Monday night is overkill. When we asked why they had an hour wait when all the tables outside were empty we were told it was because they were understaffed. Needless to say  we did not wait and honestly I have given up on this place all together. GET IT TOGETHER BJ's.
B F.,Lake Worth  FL,7,74,48,6/13/2015,4.0,The menu at this place is enormous a little too big for my liking. But the waitress was extremely nice and she was patient. we wanted a sampler of beer and she took her time explaining the beers on tap. It is a very casual and laid back environment with lots of TVs to watch sports if you wish. We ordered fish tacos and we got I have fish and have shrimp they were delicious. It came with an avocado sauce not really guacamole but it had to do. I would go back and visit them again
Anne M.,Hollywood  FL,1,37,37,3/7/2014,4.0,Big variety in their menu and although I haven't ventured off too much on their menu there food is always great  service is so-so and on some occasions they have gotten my order wrong but food wise  it's pretty good.
Ruben V.,Hollywood  FL,0,18,17,8/6/2014,4.0,Been to BJs once before in San Francisco about two year ago and loved it! Now I'm back in South Florida and didn't even know they had this place here. But today was a special occasion  my wife's birthday and did some research and found they have one right in my town. We all met after work for dinner and really enjoyed ourselves! Service was excellent and ambiance was great as well. I definitely recommend.
Rebecca L.,New York  NY,0,120,25,3/17/2014,3.0,I was expecting a bang for my buck....but that didn't happen. The food is okay...really bland and no seasoning.
Lloyd L.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,1,7,,3/21/2015,2.0,Last time I went was St Patrick's Day. Hostess was not accommodating  said there were no booths  although there were  she was just too lazy to clean any of them and it wasn't even busy. This place is always understaffed  it takes forever to get initially greeted  10+ minutes  has happened on multiple occasions. The server in training was nice this last visit  and that's the only reason I gave it two starts. Food is okay  the service kind of just ruins any good experiences.
Ginny B.,Hollywood  FL,39,22,9,8/31/2014,5.0,One word-pazookie! Try it you'll like it. My Mom and I went last night for dessert after seeing a show at our clubhouse. The trio of delicious cookies topped with ice cream was so scrumptious and 2 of them had a piece of Ghiaradelli chocolate as a garnish. Just right for each of us to devour. The manager there named Dennis was also adorable. He's eventually going to Fort Myers after his training time here in Pembroke Pines. We might have to take a trip there in the future. Fellow New Yorkers stick together down here it seems! So try the food but don't forget the pazookies for dessert. Leave some room! You won't be sorry. My favorite was the salted caramel!
Becky S.,Pembroke Pines  FL,2,10,,8/30/2014,4.0,Love love love! Cream soda  deep dish pizza  white chocolate macadamia nut Pizookie! Favorite dinner of mine! The chicken fried steak is superb too! As a matter of fact- I've never had anything I didn't like. The kids menu is also good. Service is usually on point & the manager is on it too. My taste buds are asking for it now.
Meli R.,Hollywood  FL,17,12,5,1/16/2014,5.0,I eat here at least once a week! I love this place. The staff is always friendly and the food- fresh and delicious! My favorite is the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and Mediterranean Mini Pizza! I usually sit in the bar area/ because it's first come  first serve seating. You can also do call ahead seating at BJ's  which is great. The menu has something for everyone. My favorite place to dine in Pembroke Pines HANDS DOWN !
Adam I.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,20,56,6,5/12/2014,2.0,Was alright  nothing to write home about or reasons to really wanna come back. Service wasn't great or really bad. Doesn't have that crave factor! To each is own!
Lisa C.,Miramar  FL,1,5,,7/12/2014,2.0,The Service sucks. Our waitress Aubrey was dry as a bone and was not friendly. We asked her questions and she seems annoyed. She didn't explain anything or even ask if this was our first time at the restaurant. The food also was not that great either. The only good were the drinks. Don't think I will be coming back here.
Cristina P.,Miami  FL,14,118,31,4/11/2012,4.0,Great food and really good beer. The only downside was the wait was long and the staff was pretty slow.Would definitely go back - maybe in between meals so as to not wait too long.
Wendy B.,Opa-locka  FL,211,50,25,11/19/2011,4.0,"Today  when my uncle suggested we go to BJ\'s Restaurant & Brewhouse for lunch  my first instinct was to check my Yelp app to see what my fellow Yelpers had to say about it. I must admit I was concerned when I saw all the posts about the wait time but everyone seemed to say the food was good so I figured it was worth a shot. We were starving and the hostess said the wait would be 20 minutes....I didn\'t believe her because there seemed to be way too many people waiting for it to only take 20 minutes. Nevertheless  we were already there  so we sat down on the Bar/ Take Out side (because there was nowhere else to sit). Just 2 minutes later  much to my delight  one of the waitresses comes up to us and says  ""There are empty booths by the bar if you don\'t want to wait...it\'s first come first serve."" Wonderful!!!!! Withing seconds we returned our pesky little beeper and had a menu in front of us. I must admit  although our waitress was very helpful and polite...she was a bit slow considering she was only serving a few tables on the bar side  but I can forgive her for that  and I\'ll tell you why. The food in this place is ridiculously delicious!!!!! The spinach stuffed mushrooms melt in your mouth. The fish tacos......I don\'t even have words to describe how delicious they were!!!! And let me tell you about dessert....someone\'s genius brainchild.....it is called a Pazookie!!!!  We had the red velvet pazookie. Whoever came up with this little gem deserves a medal!!!!! All in all  despite the fact that the service could be faster  the food was sooo good it made up for it! There were so many other things on the menu that looked just as fantastic  that I can\'t wait to go back and try them!!!!  I will definitely be visiting this hip little establishment again!!!!"
Brent S.,Hollywood  FL,58,191,455,3/14/2014,4.0,Huge variety  they have everything form pizza  steak to pasta. One of my favorite things are the mini appetizers. It is nice to be able to order small portions to try more! I am obsessed with the margarita flat bread  claim chowder and white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie.  You cant make a trip here and not try one of the pizookies. Service is normally pretty prompt and food comes out pretty quick.
Kristina B.,Hollywood  FL,23,4,,11/12/2011,1.0,We first tried this location after all of my co-workers raved about the place. I was severely disappointed!Yes the ambiance is nice  and I'm sure the over abundance of televisions is cool when multiple games are on; however the service was BAD....it was like tag team serving! The drinks  well they ran out of everything we wanted to try. Boo! I asked for potato skins for an appetizer and the server stated that they were out  but i kept seeing these huge potatoes being served to other tables. Hmmmmmmmm can we say they have frozen food!!!! I asked for the pulled pork  on a wheat bun  got it on a plain one. My b/f ordered the ribs....and they were  as you've guessed from the other posts  cold and rock hard  didn't fall off the bone. We complained!We gave it another shot for my sisters birthday  it was worse than the first time around. More COLD FOOD! The drinks came two at a time for a party of eight with 4-5 minute increments in between  saving the 5 year olds drink for last. The server forgot my drink completely! Appetizers were hot BAR FOOD! Our meals were just a step above bar food.DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME! I'd give 0 stars but our first meal was comped. They keep this up  they will give away more food than they have people pay for.
Tricia G.,Miami  FL,183,109,148,10/23/2011,4.0,When I found out that a BJ's restaurant was opening up in Pembroke Pines  I told everyone I knew that we HAD to go.We had dinner with our friends here recently  and the service  food and everything else was pretty much the same as the BJs we've been to in Southern Cali (check out my Yelp review of the BJ's in Southern Cali here: yelp.com/biz/bjs-restaur).The wait was about 45-50 minutes (which is totally expected for a Saturday night). The Mister was excited that he can finally have his favorite root beer and a pizookie! Our friends ordered sandwiches with fries (which they enjoyed)  but their favorites were the avocado egg rolls (so good!) and the drinks (pumpkin ale and strawberry splash). I ordered the Handbreaded Chicken Parmigiana (two chicken cutlets with a spicy marinara sauce)  which was delicious  and the Mister ordered a regular bacon cheeseburger with fries (which was ok in his book).And of course  the pizookies were YUMMY! White Chocolate  Triple Chocolate  Oreo  Red Velvet - can't wait to go back again!
Vanessa M.,Miami  FL,96,93,121,10/1/2011,3.0,Finally! This is exactly the kind of place Pembroke Pines needed. A gorgeous sports bar with a huge selection of beers. Honestly  I don't even feel like I'm in Pines when I'm in there and yes  that's a good thing. The menu pretty much has every sports bar food item you can think of. I had a hard time choosing something to eat because there's just so much to choose from. Thankfully  I went twice in one week and have tried a few solid dishes. For starters  the pizza's are highly overrated (in my opinion)  but the veggie burger and parmesan crusted chicken are both wonderful. You must try the apple berry crumble. It is just heavenly! I'm happy to welcome a place like BJ's to the suburbs. It's definitely my new go-to place for beers and good food when I'm feeling too lazy or tired to commute to Miami.
Laura B.,Opa-locka  FL,312,217,76,12/28/2011,4.0,YUM YUM YUM!!! Everything from their self brewed cream soda  to the desert is absolutely delicious! I had a pasta dish which was incredible. The desert however takes the cake. The Pazookie..... HOLY LORD it was the most delicious thing I'd ever put in my mouth. The Red Velvet Pazookie has been occupying my thoughts ever since. Definitely a nice place to go with your family. They have a nice bar if you just want to stop by for a drink or two. Every man's dream  a giant TV split 4 ways broadcasting every sports game on this hemisphere  right at the bar  and TV's throughout the dining room. Good spot! I want to go back!
Fumi T.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,324,47,40,9/21/2011,1.0,Not quite sure how to feel about this place. It was like a California Pizza Kitchen meets Pembroke Pine Ale House (interior appeal wise.)Granted that they just opened a day ago  something seemed to be off. Understandably  the staff/servers were under a watchful eye  with white shirt wearing supervisors roaming the entire floor like vultures...making things a little uneasy while dining. I almost felt like we were on an episode of Hell's Kitchen  the only thing missing was the comp'd meal. One guy with us ordered a stout (not made in house of course) and it arrived with half foam. Rule of thumb is never send anything back  right? Yet  paying $7 for a stout for it to be poured incorrectly at a place that specializes in brews is not a good impression.We ordered a few small plates: mozarella/tomato salad  macaroni & cheese  and the stuffed mushrooms. They were having an off day to say the least.For this place to be a restaurant chain  and have over 100 locations  I don't think they were prepared for an opening as of yet.
Gingit K.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,3,13,9/12/2014,2.0,"On a fairly not busy evening we went over for dinner.Service was extremely slow  our water glasses stayed empty for much of the night until we asked another server (not ours  he took our orders and disappeared) for water. When our salads arrived they looked old. I called them ""used"". Like they combined salads from other guests leftovers.When asked if everything is OK I said NO. A manager arrived  listened  said he will be right back with someone who can help us.... and was gone.We paid our bill and left a $2 tip  to make sure they know we didn\'t forget. We simply hated the service  and will never come back to this restaurant. We have been to the BJ in Daytona  FL before and loved it  but we live in SoFlo. In the future i will read more reviews here. Looks like we are not the only ones who got terrible service there."
Heather S.,Cooper City  FL,51,17,4,5/1/2014,5.0,The food and service is always great here. This is definitely my go-to restaurant. I love the Parmesan Crusted Chicken. The mashed potatoes are awesome. My boyfriend always orders double mash. I never have to wait to be seated here either. They also have convenient options like paying for your meal from your phone.
Keith S.,Rochester  NY,2,5,31,7/21/2014,2.0,Service was very poor and food was mediocre at best. We ordered salads and never received them  had server to remove them from the bill.
Grisel L.,Miami Lakes  FL,101,116,3,12/29/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Now I remember why I don't come here that often...the service SUX!!! 25 mins and still waiting for our drinks after reminding the server..
Shandi B.,Davie  FL,70,218,133,9/25/2011,3.0,"I\'ve been to BJ\'s in Southern California  so when I heard one was opening in PPines  I told my friends we had to go. Friday night  7:30pm... the wait was an hour plus. Okay  but there were at least five tables open on the patio (which stayed open all night)  so I was a bit tiffed that they weren\'t staffed to capacity.They do have call ahead seating  so we ended up eating dinner elsewhere  and calling ahead to get a table for brews and desserts. Even calling ahead for a table was a mission  and I ended up talking to three different hostesses and taking a mini quiz (First and last name? How many in your party? Inside or outside? Booth or table? Any children?) before I was told to get there within the half hour to be seated in an hour. Yeah  I was just as confused as you are.Fast forward to we got there by 9:30pm and were seated by 10:00pm (so yeah  call ahead). We went to the bar to get a beer - they have eight brews plus one seasonal (Oktoberfest right now). Besides the BJ\'s brews  they have about another 15-20 beers on tap  including Sea Dog Blueberry (yay!). I wanted one of their own brews - my first thought was a hefeweizen  but it didn\'t pass my  ""are there any banana notes in this?"" question (ewww). I was recommended the Jeremiah Red  and after a free sample  I was sold. So  the beers are good. The couple of things we ordered (my friends got a small mac n\' cheese and fried artichoke hearts) were good - especially the hearts  not greasy  tasted fresh (not canned) and garlicy! om nom nom.Of course  if you ever find that you can only order one thing at BJ\'s you must get the PIZOOKIES (those would be PIZZA COOKIES!). We got a trio of chocolate chunk (yes)  red velvet (too sweet) and Oreo (magic).Our waiter was nice enough  but not really attentive. This was their opening weekend  so I\'m looking forward to going back and actually getting a pizza.Side note - stay away from the Berry Burst Cider - unless you enjoy the taste of Dimetapp."
Stephanie M.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,3,,7/13/2014,4.0,Great place with lots of variety. A friend took me here for lunch and the food was great and reasonably priced. They have an extensive menu with something for everyone though I highly recommend the corn fritters as an appetizer and the chicken pita tacos if you're looking for a lighter entre. The service at this location was also awesome. I will be back for sure.
Joe P.,Hialeah  FL,10,80,50,1/11/2015,3.0,The place is huge  but not good to watch games as others suggest. There isn't lot of tvS I think I must of Seen like 6-8. The beer selection is incredible  along with their extensive menu of appetizers and entrees. However  the food is average. I tried the wings and the deep dish pizza. all I can say is they got nothing on ale house wings. Pizza sucked! Cheesey pizza  no sauce just cubed tomatoes thrown in the mix. Dough tasted bland  and ingredients too; had no flavor. All in all I wasn't impressed to come back here.
Jan N.,Miami  FL,341,241,94,5/29/2012,3.0,"Giving it 3 stars because the first time I came here  it was fabulous  but the second time was ""eh."" They have a huge selection of foods a la Cheesecake Factory style (but not as good!)  and a variety of beers. The crowd was a mix - families  people on dates  and groups. One of the times I came here was for a game  and it was packed! Lots of big screen TVs by the bar  but not really sprinkled throughout the restaurant. That\'s one negative. I would honestly have to visit this location again to give a good account of what to expect. I can\'t seem to pinpoint the details. But I still do recommend it. You\'ll find something since the menu is so expansive! The beer is good - I had one of their reds (love ambers!) from San Francisco both times I visited  and I remember being happy with the choice."
John L.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,21,408,,3/19/2014,4.0,I love wedge salads and they've got a great one. I love tomato bisque and they have a great one. Someday I'll expand my horizons beyond wedge salad and tomato bisque here but for now it is at least a4
Gary F.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,10,,7/31/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"Nice looking establishment advertising specialty burgers appetizing photography.... And then after a ridiculous wait and absent waiter   the runner or dishwasher brought out the food. My "" medium"" burger showed up extra well done. It had obviously been stuck to the flat top as it was broken  burnt and delivered on a very stale bun. The manager explained it had cracked when "" scraped"" off the grill. Even the lettuce and tomato looked like refugees from a bad salad bar. They kept offering desert as a consolation instead of redoing the burger. After some effort the manager agreed to remove the price of the burger  no apology for wasting the time.The owners must take pride as their names are on a brass plaque. I wonder if they know they\'ve hired the village idiot as an expediter. Any one who cared would never have let that off the line. I\'m guessing the other idiot must be the chef. For a $12.00 burger they should at least look at their offerings.I recently spoke with Scott the manager who had taken time to speak with me regarding this posting. Many people reply because it looks better on line. Scott was genuinely concerned about my experience. I\'m hoping he can resolve the internal issues I think if he\'d seen the product it never would have made it to my table. Thanks Scott  best of luck"
Hoilda B.,Hialeah  FL,56,102,126,2/23/2012,4.0,We always go to BJ's in Orlando Fl and we love that place. I was so happy to see one open in Pembroke Pines  Fl . The food is great and the portions are a good size. Love how the place is decorated and the bar is huge. I must say that the different between the Orlando location and Pembroke Pines is the waiting time  they told me 10 minutes and and it turn out to be 35 minutes. Overall the food is great and inexpensive.
Steven D.,Fort Meade  MD,5,327,10,6/9/2014,5.0,If you are in the area and looking to enjoy great food. BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is the perfect family restaurant.
A F.,Davie  FL,0,8,,7/20/2015,3.0,Are here this past Saturday  we Got seated right Away which was good. It took about 8 minutes just for the waiter to come to us. Ordered our drinks from the bar took another 8 minutes to just get them. The restaurant was packed so they need more runners and servers. Our food was great even though it took forever to come out. After we finished eating we ordered another round of drinks and our waiter totally forgot about them. We reminded him and he acted like they should of got served. He went to the bar and he could only bring the hard alcohol drinks because he said there was something wrong with the beer. So overall we loved the food and atmosphere but they need to step it up with service!
John C.,Pembroke Pines  FL,0,2,,7/16/2015,1.0,"My wife and I went in to sample the ""happy hour"". The food is all right  but drink deals are a minimum. After I received the check I noticed inconsistency in what I ordered and what I was charged for. I was charged for more expensive items  and then given their great happy hour discount which brought it to normal price. I would not recommend this restaurant  but if you choose to go  monitor your check closely."
Macielle B.,Hialeah  FL,162,97,33,4/2/2012,4.0,"BJ""S! I love BJ\'s so much! Their soups are so good especially the Tortilla soup which they pour in front of you  has a bit of a kick. My favorite of their Chicken Alfredo Pasta its so delicious and creamy. The bread that accompanies it is so soft . I absolutely love their 1800 skinny margaritas. All that taste for half the calories! It can get very busy and waiting for a table on the weekends is a serious pain but good thing is that the bar is always open so you can grab a drink while you wait. The service here is really good  I\'ve never had a problem with the staff  everyone is usually very friendly and patient. If you are undecided on what to try they will make suggestions for you. For your first time I recommend trying one of their deep dish pizza\'s  they\'re a real treat. If you don\'t drink they make their own colas  the black cherry is my favorite. And I\'ve never had their home brewed beers but my friends swear by them.Happy Eating."
Denise G.,Pembroke Pines  FL,8,35,72,7/20/2013,5.0,We were going to go to the Cheesecake factory but my daughter suggested this restaurant. I am so glad we tried it! I have passed by this a bunch of times  and I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was! The drinks are amazing. We had water melon and strawberry mojitos and an Island Sunset they were awesome!For apps we had the Ahi Poke  it was great! We also had both Thai shrimp wraps and also chicken lettuce wraps.Yum on both of those too! I had shrimp tacos my daughter had rib eye steak  husband had shrimp scampi and other daughter had balsamic glazed chicken  Every thing was amazing. We cant wait to go back and try the flat bread and pizzas which looked so good. We also had their signature dessert called Pizookie  which is any kind of home made cookie with ice cream on top  we tried three in the trio. peanut butter  red velvet and white chocolate macadamia  wow! A first time hit in Pembroke Pines  perfect!
Cann I.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,8,,12/5/2014,1.0,I was there twice today...my first and last time. Service was poor  dishes dirty and food just adequate. The place was almost empty yet we waited a ridiculous amount of time to get drink refills. The music was loud. All in all not a fun lunch experience.
Mark E.,South Elgin  IL,64,63,4,9/10/2013,4.0,Great food and service  fairly prices. Love going to BJ's for their craft beers and delicious food. Their pizza's are great  as are their burgers
Mike R.,Hollywood  FL,0,1,,10/8/2011,2.0,Not so good experience. Floor was slippery and was told a lady fell flat on her face earlier in the day. I don't think the staff received proper training on the beer and food selection. I received my beer above 42 degrees and was expecting lager to be served at a brewery between 36 and 39 degrees. I ordered a burger and wasn't asked how i wanted it cooked and sure enough it was way overcooked. I had the option to order potato wedges or thin cut fries - I ordered the thin cut fries an received the wedges. I told the waitress and she offered to bring me a aide of fries and never got it.On a positive side the place is nicely decorated and plasma TV's everywhere. This is a good place to sit at the bar and order appetizers. I will wait 6 months before going back and by then they should have experience and know their food and beer.
Anthony K.,Cincinnati  OH,37,72,4,11/4/2011,4.0,When I heard that there was a BJ's Brewhouse open in South Florida  I instantly changed my flight path from home to the brew house......yes really.... jumping over 3 lanes on the turnpike to get here sooner kind of giddy.Coming from Southern California  there's BJ's all over and they are famous for their Great American Beer Festival multi-award winning beers  huge deep dish pizza  humungoid potatoes  and the infamous pazookie. Lo and behold the pazookie in all of it's delicious glory !! (Ominous Music goes here) - What is a pazookie you may ask ? It is a delicious  fresh baked cookie brought out in a pizza tin. Then you put ice cream on top and toppings  whip cream  and you have a pizza / cookie = Pazookie. If for any reason  this is a reason to go. But then there's the beer as well  and the food  and the beer  and more pages of food :) Seriously  there's something for everyone here.The servers here were great  the seats were comfy  the space was large / warm and inviting. It felt like being back in California.   The only reason for not giving 5 stars is that they don't brew their beer on site here anymore. My waitress stated it was too costly  in which I don't believe so. They have since started bringing their beer in from Texas  and with all the transportation costs  I'd be glad to brew on site here for free.Free brewery help if needed guys...just saying...I can shovel spent grain like the dickens !!Until I get hired here  I'll continue to come in for pazookies  pizza  beer  egg rolls  wings  the list continues....
Ed D.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,44,17,26,2/10/2014,4.0,Great spot. Me and my girl went there and had a great diner. Draft Beers were on special! Service was friendly.
Jermaine G.,Hollywood  FL,44,32,3,10/23/2011,4.0,Wanted to try something new and remember receiving an email telling me about a new brewery right off of Pines Blvd. Arrived around 10pm and the place was very busy  but not busy to the point where we weren't acknowledged upon entry  they're large flat screens throughout the restaurant (the World Series and a few college football games were on) so wherever we were seated you could see the game(s) We were taken to our seat after a very short wait (about 5 minutes) our waitress; Anita was amazing  she provided great food suggestions and also educated us on the various types of beer since none of the people in my party are avid beer drinkers. She provided us with a variety sampler of 4 types of beer (about 6 ounces each)Try the spring rolls they were top notch  very light and full of flavor. The Jambalaya was great and the cajun tilapia tasted very fresh and flavorful. For dessert (which we were eyeing before everything else) we had the BJ Beneigt......SUPERB!Will definitely visit BJ's again
Christine M.,Hollywood  FL,15,20,,4/13/2014,4.0,This place is great! You need to get there before the rush or there will be a wait. We normally get the Mediterranean Pizza with no chicken. Love it. Appetizer is usually the avocado rolls  and again good food!!
Finding Q.,Hollywood  FL,0,28,,4/9/2015,3.0,I like the bar area. Cool for happy hour. Worth visiting  but somehow never remember its there until I drive by it!
Robert P.,Pembroke Pines  FL,6,5,16,10/23/2011,3.0,We called ahead at which time we were given a 45 minute wait time. Arriving 35 minutes later we were asked to wait 25 more minutes  so much for call ahead sitting. 50 minutes later we were still waiting to be sitted. The appetizer arrive slowly and cold to the table and most of the meals were luke warm if not cold. Plus the second round of drinks had to be requested twice. I am attributing the delay in service to being understaffed. We tried several types of beer all with distinct flavors  including their Pumpkin and Harvest seasonal beer  all repeaters. The Chicken Fried Steak  Cajun Pasta and Jambalaya were delicious and definitely worth going back for. The staff was apologetic for the delay and temperatur of the food and compensated by providing yet another dish of Jambalaya to bring home and eat later at another time. We give a three star because time and service is huge part of the dinning experience (we like our food flaming hot) especially since temperature affects the flavor. Plus we where not asked if we wanted a second plate of food. We would have rather they offer to heat the plate I had or compensate in another manner such as free drink  comp the cost of the dish and or a free dessert. The consensus: the food was delicious  we are willing to return and give it another try. Hopefully on a not so busy night.
Raymond M.,Hollywood  FL,50,41,28,2/16/2012,3.0,"I have eaten here a couple of time already  and we know that during the weekends forget about getting a table with less that a 45 minute wait. It is just packed to the rafters. But when you come during the week  sans Friday and the weekend  you will find a table quickly. My wife and I are wishing the best for this restaurant  but I have to admit that after 4 times each time there was an issue of some sort with the food. On the first week that it opened my wife ""pork chops"" were very under cooked as you got closer to the bone  we brought it up to the attention of the manager and we hoped that it was corrected. So we waited for couple of weeks allowing for the restaurant to adjust a bit to the menu and we came back and low and behold when was enjoying my Chicken Marsala I started to notice that the taste was changing and found out that my chicken was under cooked showed it to the waiter and the manager came around and made the apologies and explained to him to have the cook to take his time in cooking the chicken. Now we come to last night (2/15/2012) and we held out breath giving it another chance. We love to explore with new items and we ordered the Meatballs (fantastic)  the ""Chicken Wantons"" (excellent especially good with the white and read sauces that came with it)   and the Mozzarella and tomato balsamic salad was cold and crispy. The disappointment  the Mac and cheese  had to send it back twice since it was Mac and cheese soup. They were telling us that it has to set up  understandable  but when you make the sauce and take it off the stove and you let it set  and when it sets it sticks to the macaroni when it cools down a bit and not swim it it. We again brought it up to the Manager\'s attention and he recognized us from the other times that we came to dine there.The beer is great especially the Jeremiah Red and the building and the restaurant space is nice  but they have to spend more money to attract a better chef that will take his or her time and making sure that the meals come out right  and is not in a rush to get the orders out fast. I guarantee that if the food is good and comes out well paced (not bring out the starters with the dinner or  ""ish""  warm salad). Take the time to provide good service and food then the people will be glad to wait for a table.Will we come back  maybe. How long dos BJ\'s have to brew to get it right with the food and service? We just don\'t know  a year  two years  three years?"
Robert G.,Miramar  FL,1,15,8,5/15/2015,5.0,I have been here many times and they always do a good job. The food is good and they have a lot of menu choices. They also have a number of very good lower calorie healthier choices. I find that the wait time to be seated can be long so one should always use the call ahead service to put your name on the wait list.
Colleen C.,Portland  OR,150,259,3,11/13/2011,4.0,Holy. Crap. If you are going to come here  use the call ahead service  or else you are going to be waiting for a long time. The first time I came here (Friday night)  the wait was about an hour and a half. The second time we came  we had reservations and went right in within a minute or two. The hostess was very nice and surprisingly calm for the insane amount of people in the restaurant.Our waitress was awesome  very friendly and down to earth. Her beer recommendations were right on point  and my boyfriend and I both tried one of the beers they brew themselves. Mine (a Nutty Brewnette) was fantastic  and highly recommended. His was good as well  but not quite my style --- there's something for everyone though  if you like beer  as well as a full bar.Our entrees were served surprisingly quickly  given how packed the place was  and the service was outstanding. Our waitress checked up on us about four times during the course of our meal  and we were never at a lack for anything we needed. The portions are very big  and I definitely recommend the grilled chicken pasta (perfect with the Nutty Brewnette!). I'd definitely like to come back and try other items on their huge menu... especially this pazookie I've been hearing so much about.
Chris P.,Hollywood  FL,0,36,,12/29/2014,3.0,The best thing about this restaurant  other than the extensive beer menu  is the cookie dessert... the pizookie? So good! The food menu is large  but the food is not great. That's just my opinion... and I've tried a variety of entrees  etc.
Richard M.,Broward  FL,0,14,,7/6/2013,1.0,What to say  terrible service worse food  dirty floors and bathrooms. If this is a chain corporate need to step in  if its a franchise I'm glad my money is not tied up in it. I can not state how poor this place is. I don't leave bad reviews based on being upset about one or two things as many seem to. This is not personal or due to a grudge but I seriously advise anyone thinking to try this place to go somewhere else as I and the 8 others who were with me will do from now on.
Akta N.,Chicago  IL,78,91,11,12/19/2012,2.0,I've been here 3 times now and it's gotten worse. We tend to go here after I get in town which is a Friday and around 11 pm. It seems to be one of the only places open and still serving food. However  the waiter service is terrible. The first two times the waiters forgot about us  this time really took the cake. We were seated in a 6 person booth - there was only two of us. No one came to greet us for about 5-10 minute even though we were seating right next to the waitress station and they all looked at us. It took my boyfriend telling a waitress then her trying to find someone until we finally got water. The service was slow and very terse. I know that they were getting ready to close up but there were quite a few people including a large party still there. The food was mediocre. I ordered the nachos and most of the cheese wasn't even melted. The beer was OK. The reason this place gets two stars is because I've had food from there before and it was been OK and the fries are good. We've decided to never go here again  even if i get in town late. We'd rather just cook food ourselves.
Andrea J.,Hollywood  FL,9,2,,8/3/2013,1.0,My boyfriend and I along with his sister tried this place for the first time and were quite disappointed. Although we were seated fairly quickly  the service was very slow and subpar. The orders were taken quickly and then our waitress disappeared for almost 30 minutes. I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita that tasted like it was leftover from the night before. I sent it back and ordered another strawberry drink that was better. My boyfriend ordered a watermelon mojito and wasn't satified with it. I ordered chicken fettuchine alfredo; my pasta was under cooked and my chicken was dry. My boyfriend ordered the half chicken with a half a rack of ribs; the ribs were hard and the chicken was under cooked. His sister ordered seafood alfredo and her pasta was also under cooked. Overall the service could have been much quicker and the food should have been better for a 72 dollar meal.
Joshua A.,Hialeah  FL,4,8,2,1/5/2014,4.0,Started at the bar  the drinks were made right and even though the bar was full for an NFL playoff game we got good  quick service. Afterwards we moved to a table  where the service was not as great. Everything took too long  from waters to the food. One meal was forgotten and when the waitress was notified it took another 10 or so minutes. Similarly for dessert one of the orders came out wrong. The waitress was very nice but something was going on in either the kitchen or with her order taking. The food itself was good  fish and chips  ribs and chicken limone pasta were all delicious  and fresh. Between the food and bar service  it earned the four  but the speed and accuracy of service could've dropped this down to a 2 or 3.
Maite H.,Miami Lakes  FL,60,132,20,11/22/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,I am beyond over BJ's Brewhouse. It took 3 times of poor service for me to decide that I will opt for other eateries. We placed an online order and went to pick it up at the scheduled time. Upon arriving we were told the order was done incorrectly. They never explained what in fact was wrong with it. We waited and waited and waited. The manager came out and apologized and said it would be out shortly and that we'd get a complimentary pzookie. The restaurant was not very busy and yet we continued to wait. It was 45 min later when they brought out our order. Pzookie was no where to be seen we had to remind them and wait yet some more for it to come out. The manager disappeared and was never seen again through all our waiting...convenient! When we got home...the sandwich we paid extra to add cheese to had no cheese...the sandwich that said no tomato on the actual label of the container still had tomatoes. Our lunch order consisted of 2 sandwiches  a salad  and 2 soups. We wait 45 minutes to get the food done as stated on the menu clearly ignoring the instructions we selected on their drop down menu. I'm so angry at this place. The last 2 visits to dine in have been equally as pathetic. It is a complete shame because the food is enjoyable.
Alana L.,Washington  DC,0,1,,3/21/2014,1.0,Poor attention. The food is not bad but the personnel makes you feel like you are bothering them. Disappointing.
Victor N.,Miami  FL,2,5,,1/31/2014,5.0,The food was great I would def recommend for just about anybody. This is a place where its suits anybody and has a lot of a variety in their menu. Def will be coming here more often.
Arly J.,Hollywood  FL,25,255,263,9/27/2011,4.0,Went opening day around five and greeted by six people and as we continued to walk in had never seen so much staff. Our waitress was overly attentive I would be too if I had someone constantly checking on me as everyone had a trainer with them. Menu is huge and we ordered appetizers we loved the mushroom with spinach and avocado egg rolls. We could pass on the calamari. My husband loved the jambalaya so much that on our second visit he ordered it again. We went with friends the second visit and decided to try the pizzas. we ordered two different ones vegetarian and BBQ chicken both were amazing!!! We also love the Mac and cheese appetizer. By far the Pizookie is delicious and we had the trio ( chocolate  macadamia and choc chunk)The cream soda is delicious a must try. We also enjoyed the octoberfest beer. Great place to enjoy a beer and relax.
Chas L.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,20,45,20,9/25/2013,4.0,What got my attention with this place was that is a Brewhouse. My husband is really into his beer. Me  not so much. :P He can taste the flavors  all i taste is beer. So i wanted to come here and have a bit to eat and have him sample some of their in house made beers. It was pretty busy  so we had to wait  but not too long. I got myself a fruity mixed drink  while hubby had a beer  that he LOVED. I love the small appetizers. I tend to get full off appetizers before my meal comes  but this portion prevents that lol. I had the french dip  honey had a burger. Both were tasty. One thing i wasn't happy with was the fries. They came out really cold. I didn't bother asking for more. I was hoping they would have sweet potato fries  but no suck luck. The second time we went we shared one of their deep dish pizzas  oh my yum!
Jennifer Z.,Pembroke Pines  FL,10,4,1,1/21/2015,2.0,Not the greatest place to go. We sat outside but the place was not full at all. Dinner lasted over 2 hours because the servers kept changing and we had to wait forever to get anything. Everything had to go through several hands (waitress to kitchen to other server to another server) before we got anything  even a simple water took 15 minutes to get. Three other tables around us complained to the manager. food was okay but not great not a lot and it was not cheap. i guess it could be nice to watch a game and get a drink but thats about it.
Natasha D.,Miami  FL,106,274,23,6/22/2013,3.0,Came in at around 8:00 on a Saturday night  was not overwhelmingly busy. There is a bar area with high top tables and booths where you can seat yourself (if there's availability) so we decided to do that instead of the 25-30 minute wait for two. Our server did a good job explaining the concept of the restaurant and the different beers they are known for. The menu is EXTENSIVE and everything is reasonably priced so it took a while to make a decision. I settled on the deep dish pizza and the Mr. got the pot roast. We also got a root beer which is apparently made there... And is freaking awesome  and much to our surprise had free refills. My pizza was good  reminded me of the personal pan pizzas at Pizza Hut. For more than half the price I will probably not order it from here again but am sufficiently intrigued to return and try something else. Agree with another review that it came out lukewarm. The pot roast meat was tender and the gravy had a robust flavor. Mashed potatoes were pretty good  dense because of the white cheddar. Also on the plate appeared to be raw celery  carrots and a quarter of an onion which I would expect to have been cooked WITH the roast so a little bizarre that they're there raw on the plate. Overall service was good  drinks refilled in a timely manner and just the right amount of checking in. I will definitely return. Cool atmosphere  fun music (cheesy 80s  Depeche Mode and Tears for Fears in the hour we were there) mixed in with modern stuff. Good place to take a group that can't decide on cuisine since there's so many varied options.
J M.,Houston  TX,1,21,,9/11/2013,2.0,"The food at BJ\'s was what we expected it to be. Good  but not great. We had the vegetarian pizza  the poke  and shrimp lettuce wraps. Topped off with a pizookie.The one big gaping hole was the service. We had a waiter named ""Joseph"" and he was HORRIBLE!! Seemed friendly  but got a whole bunch of stuff wrong on our order  and it took almost 20 minutes to get our bill after we asked for it  and another 10 just to pay it. Seemed like a management problem in that all of the staff were not really out there to provide good customer service. All of the waitstaff were busier gossiping amongst themselves than to help the customers. I""ll be back  but to another BJ\'s."
Monica R.,Hollywood  FL,21,5,,12/14/2011,2.0,Mac and Cheese is amazing!! The wait time was a bit long  but our server Charlie was very gracious about it. I recomend the Brewhouse Blonde Shrimp as well.Love the small appitizer menu  let's you sample so much with out a large bill!
Pat D.,Toronto  Canada,3,3,,1/4/2014,4.0,The best Chicken Tortilla soup I have ever tasted. The way it is served tableside is rather unique. A bowl with the ingredients that are usually sprinkled on top of the soup and allowed to soak up the soup getting soggy in the process are the sole inhabitants of the bowl. The server the pours the soup from a gravy boat into the bowl and it doesn't get any fresher or taste any better. Our waitress was a gem  she helped us through the drink and food menu made very tasty suggestions and informed us that if you call 30 minutes ahead you can almost always avoid the wait. Her name is Julie be sure to ask for her by name when you call ahead and your experience will be pleasantly memorable.
Elana M.,Hollywood  FL,296,155,80,4/8/2014,2.0,That was one hell of a frustrating lunch! I met my friend at BJ's at exactly 12:30 pm  She was on her lunch break which lasts an hour. To cut to the chase  after shoving the food down her throat after it finally arrived  she busted out the door at exactly 1:30 pm  leaving me waiting for boxes for our leftovers and to pay the bill. During our entire visit  our server (Loyda) was never around. She would yap with the table behind us for 10 minutes and then breeze by us without a word. This happened throughout the entire meal. It was just so annoying! Anyway...after my friend left to go back to work  I sat there for another 25 minutes until she finally came by to see if I wanted anything else. I told her to please bring me boxes and the check. Again...more waiting. Finally I get the bill  put my card in  and she attempts to walk on by me again without taking it. I stopped her and told her to please process my check so I could leave. Finally I am out the door a little after 2:00 pm. The food was good. No complaints in that department  but that is irrelevant to me  because I would never  ever go back.
Shinelle A.,Hollywood  FL,16,5,1,2/1/2013,3.0,Service was horrible today  the server was not engaged to her customers and truly could have done without her attitude. I ordered the Mahi  it was ok  nothing too special. In the past I have had great dishes and experience here  unfortunately today was not one of those days.
Missy E.,Hialeah  FL,3,1,23,10/27/2011,5.0,Outstanding food and service. The beer selection in extensive and the house beer is only $3 during lunch time. I'll defiantly be going back for seconds and thirds. Try the chicken parm ....... It's pretty serious. The price for the food is decent. I will say though unless you go for lunch and order house beer  the regular beer prices are a bit high.
Conway W.,New York  NY,24,5,4,6/17/2014,1.0,"It\'s my first time here. After we sat down our waitress took 20 mins to attend to us. After we got our drinks  it took our waitress another 20 mins to come back for our order but when asked if we could get service  the waitresses responded with ""I will come back after I\'m done doing a few things I really need to attend to "" which is thought was very rude. After my table ordered our food  We probably waited for another 30 mins before we got it because they made a mistake with one of our dishes and had to remake it from scratch. When the food came out  one of my dishes wasn\'t put in to order  however I declined and had it removed from the bill because it would prolly take another hour to come out. After that we got our checks and it was all wrong  after 10 it\'s half off appetizers and had to return the checks and wait another 10 mins. In all my crew and I spent over 1hr 20mins waiting at this restaurant for food that wasn\'t great in my opinion."
Barry E.,Hollywood  FL,1,48,,9/25/2013,4.0,We have been to BJ's restaurant several times and the food is always very good and the service is as well. We have always gotten very good professional service at lunchtime from Stacy. They have a large menu.My wife needs to be gluten-free's and they have a very extensive menu of gluten-free items including pizza. The hamburgers are very tasty.
Mike W.,Miramar  FL,0,6,,12/27/2012,1.0,I've given this place plenty of chances because the food and beer are quite good. The problem is the service is atrocious. Most of the servers I've had have been incompetent  and the one manager I've talked to was rude and condescending.After last night's attempt at dinner  I give up. I definitely won't be going back.
Maite R.,Miami Lakes  FL,235,39,,6/14/2013,3.0,I like the decor and the concept  and for very few you can sample their beers. I have only been once  so I would be willing to give it another chance. Their pizzas look good. I had a chicken dish that TASTED good  but was really dry (balsamic)  although I did like the potatoes it came with a lot. The chicken lettuce wraps? Tasted good  but if we got a whole head of lettuce and a spoonful of the chicken. I just thought it was ok. Nothing that offends me  but nothing I would go out of my way for.
Inthiaz S.,Hollywood  FL,162,143,18,5/30/2012,3.0,sooo i have been this new spot and everytime i go i like it.at first i was skeptical thought grrreat another sportsbar but to my surprise it is good. only complaint is a little expensive even though the food is not bad.yeah so i recommend it..
Daniel B. O.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,1,295,36,6/28/2014,4.0,Nice place to go! Their deep dish pizza and burgers are good. They have a large selection of beers including their own. I would say their best beers are the Jeremiah Red and the Hopster IPA. Can't go wrong with a Deep Dish Pizza and an IPA. This llace gets busy so arrive early!
Karen M.,Miami  FL,3,3,,6/7/2013,5.0,Awesome food! The pizza is great! The calamari mixture seafood appetizer is also good!
Katrina B.,Hollywood  FL,205,77,131,2/14/2013,4.0,Great atmosphere went after work very relaxing nice vibe. Will definitely recommend to all my family and friends.
Alejandra S.,Miami Beach  FL,113,56,47,3/31/2013,5.0,Perfect meal. The best tomato soup ever. Like liquid pizza! The pizza was great and the Oreo pizzookie is a must!!!!
Chip R.,Weston  FL,206,65,30,2/1/2013,4.0,Do call ahead seating. Puts you at the top of the list! Deep dish pizza is excellent.
Lisa D.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,48,28,6,5/22/2012,2.0,"I have been to BJs in Vegas many times and always had a good experience. However this one  not so good. Our waiter  Ben  was nice but ooh so slow. I asked him if he would recommend the pot roast sandwich. He told me is was his ""favorite"". I said I was torn between than and my old stand-by  French dip. He advised to go with the pot roast  so I did. The roast itself was tasty but so small compared to the huge mound of mashed potato. But what really was horrible were the veggies. The carrots  celery and onion were raw. I only know this after eating the onion. It was so strong that it left my pallet unable to taste anything else. When I brought this to his attention he offered to get me the French dip and said he\'d have it out I\'m less than 5 minutes. 20 minutes later  still no sandwich and my husband and 3 year old have long finished theirs. I asked Ben to have it wrapped to go. Another 10 minutes later it arrived. I did eat it later that afternoon for dinner but reheated sandwiches are not my fave. Another issue was my sons Mac and cheese. It looked old. I realize it is kraft but it looks like it came from a huge bin in the fridge and thrown into the Microwave. He\'s 3  he didn\'t seem to mind."
Jennifer P.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,20,9,2,8/17/2012,4.0,Friday night so there was an hour wait. But we managed to get seats at the bar  where we ate. They have a big menu. I had the mahi mahi. It taste good and on the less calorie meals. But cheated and had the dessert. OMG the pizziones was delicious. My husband had the californa burger which was tasty and the wedge frys were great. They also make their own beer which was good. Good hang out environment. Nice decor. I will go again and bring some friends
R B.,Tallahassee  FL,516,18,,8/13/2013,5.0,One of the few places in town that I have yet to have a bad experience. A large and varied menu with a unique dessert that you simply cannot leave without.
Tracie F.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,10,4,7/27/2013,3.0,Food is delicious! Service sucks! Been here 3 times and all 3 times the service has been shall we say lousy! Will go back because the food is good. But if you decide to try this place pack your patience because the service leaves a little to be desired!
Idy S.,North Miami Beach  FL,39,16,2,4/21/2013,2.0,The best thing about this place is definitely the alcohol...pomegranate martini was sweet and strong. My friend had some beer that he says is hard to find but excellent lol the calamari was good but the rest of the food was your typical frozen re-heated chain food. Service wasn't bad but our party of 10 had to wait an hour to be seated. At 5 p.m. that wait seemed ridiculous especially on a rainy night when the place was kind of empty. Would go back for happy hour  nothing more.
Vane S.,Miami  FL,26,13,6,1/8/2012,1.0,"BJs. The place where you\'ll wait 25mins for a table  ""nachos"" is a plate of dry chips with a scant sprinkle of cheese and a wad of sour cream. The fries are served cold. The pasta is undercooked(seriously  how not hard is it to cook pasta?). And you\'ll be so frustrated with ur smart ass waiter you\'ll want to punch them in the face and then send them to hell. Welcome! Enjoy!"
Lala A.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,10,19,26,3/27/2013,2.0,I have been here twice so far. My first experience was a Friday night  it was busy our server was an older nice gentleman. It took awhile for food to come out and drinks were not kept full.The second time I went we got a very pleasant server by the name of Candice. When we got sat (30 min wait avg on a weekend :) ) our server rushed us for our drink order and appetizers before we even had a chance to view the menus. When we asked for additional time that is where the fun began. Our drinks were slammed on the table  toppings for pizza slammed on the table. Our drinks were not kept full  barely even saw our waitress all night.We did see her she standing by the computer all night though. Dinner was extremely slow to come out  took dessert orders and one came out 20minutes before the others did. We all got the cookie desserts and icecream was melted before it even came to the table. Overall the food is ok decent atmosphere it is similar to cheesecake factory.However  I am weary of the servers there. Won't be returning here.
Melissa H.,Hollywood  FL,97,31,3,7/19/2014,4.0,Good pizza  good food in general. Im a huge craft beer drinker and I only liked the Jeremiah Red and the Hopstorm. Just wish they had a few more good beers.
sandra v.,Hollywood  FL,23,87,15,2/27/2013,4.0,The food is great! Anything you order is always hot and fresh. The only probelm is the wait between when you order and when it gets on your table. Other than that everything is delicious and the drinks are too!
Justin Y.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,5,30,7,12/9/2012,2.0,If I was going to just go here to watch a game and drink beer I'd give it a better rating. This is the second time that we ate here and for the second time our service was poor. The server was never around and whenever she came by she was always in a rush which didn't help because most of the time all of our glasses needed refills. The beer selection is good and their beers made in house are good also. Brewing their own beer sets them aside from other brewhouses that have been popping up but the several page menu full of food that just doesn't really jump out at me and the bad service will drive me to better places like Yard House and Tap 42. BTW Yard House is great!
Susana L.,Miami Lakes  FL,17,12,66,4/18/2013,4.0,I like the food here service has not been bad either i have not tried manny plates but so far what i have tried has been great . Im a fan of desserts and they have a great menu to choose from .
Brian R.,Hollywood  FL,0,6,1,9/24/2014,5.0,Ladies and gentlemen  this is one of the most underrated restaurants that needs to be visited ASAP. I have had one of the most best burgers here in this place. It was a jalapeno burger. On top of that they gave me a berry pomegranate which is the best pomegranate that I have had thus far. I recommend everybody to not skip this place  for this place will offer you so many different kind of foods that you will not know where to start at! I know that there are different places like alehouse  which offers different kind of foods like burgers and wings. But BJ brewhouse brings a whole different type of scenery to what is food. Something that impressed is the fact that how you see the photo on the menu is exactly how it will be delivered to you. Do not get a flat top burger. Stick with the flame broiled burgers. Also even their sauces are homemade. Even their sauces. Do not skip this place. If you like to drink and watch the game then this is the place. If you like to be with family  this is the place. If you like food done right then this is the place. Till now  I have no complaints. There was one time that we have been told to wait due to some complications but the waiters were attentive to us and showed us that they wanted to make us happy. And that is what restaurant should be. About the customer. I give you a five out of five BJ brewhouse  great job.
Adetoun Tina A.,Hollywood  FL,505,156,101,3/17/2012,4.0,I've been going to this location since it opened and I've had amazing times each time. I went this past tuesday and to my delight it was half off wine all day. Im not a beer drinking but if you are this is a great place to try different beers and get to know more about them. The foods good  large potions even in appetizers so if your going with a group of friends you can order appetizers between all of you. Great tv's everywhere so if you want to watch a game its awesome and the best will have to be their poozoki deserts. Chocolate Chip is the best in my opinion but they have a trio where you can try different ones.
liz r.,Hialeah  FL,39,27,8,9/8/2012,5.0,All the food is amazing!!!...except the wheat pizza crust. & the drinks are all tasty too!!! Get the avocado egg rolls!!!
Nancy G.,Miami  FL,55,50,37,12/18/2011,5.0,Me and my friends came across BJ's after leaving a restaurant with a 2 hour wait :/. We ended up waiting about an hour which wasn't bad for a Saturday night and a party of 16. Our waiter was extremely nice especially with our large group. We went a little crazy on the appetizers  but it was well worth it  everything was delicious. Their Mac and Cheese was heaven. Can't wait to stop by again.
Juan R.,Hollywood  FL,33,50,28,6/29/2012,4.0,Ordered to go the Chicago style deep dish pizza and it was really good.Nice crust and pretty good amount of cheese and veggies.
Ikam A.,Miami Beach  FL,81,187,4,9/22/2011,4.0,"Awesome beers  awesome food  and awesome wait staff. Can\'t complain one bit. We are totally planning another visit. Loved my Cajun Tilapia  and my husband loved his made-to-order pizza. He had some ""Wacky Brunette"" beer or something that sounded sorta like that (hello  that\'s ME!) and I had my usual vodka-soda. It was all delicious and people were so attentive. The place was real laid back  we weren\'t rushed (a HUGE plus  as you know)  and the decor was pretty cool and pleasing to the eye. There were so many menu items I wanted to try  but  hello  we were just there for one meal  so I had to take my chances with one. I will be back  however  so I will let you know how the update is. Stay tuned. All I can say is that the place did not disappoint. We will be re-visiting  and out waitress  Heather  was the bomb."
Heriberto T.,Hialeah  FL,0,4,,5/29/2014,5.0,This place is amazing! Their in house beer is great! You can't really go wrong with anything on the menu  my favorites are the Tuscan Limone pasta and California burger with thin fries! However I really recommend their Oreo pizooki to everyone!
Shiela G.,Hollywood  FL,127,33,61,4/19/2012,3.0,Went to this place one weeknight and we got accommodated almost right away. Tried the German wheat beer that nobody can pronounce the name and it was good. If you like Bluemoon you'll like this one. Huge menu. I tried the Thai salmon and can't complain. Next time I'll try the the Jeremiah Red beer and the mouthwatering burger that my husband had last time.
Debbie M.,Hollywood  FL,4,25,47,4/3/2014,2.0,Beware. I just wrote a tip telling what a great happy hour special they had. When I asked the waitress if they would still make the spinach artichoke pizza that they had taken off of the menu she said.....ahhhhhhhh......no. Hmm....wonder if she checked with the kitchen because they made it for me several times in the past. But....no problem....I ordered the build your own pizza with artichokes  jalapenos  and mushrooms. Warning!!! There is no sauce on their pizzas. They served me cardboard with a few veggies on top. I loved their other pizza but this was very dry. I asked the waitress if there is no sauce on their pizza and she replied that they braise them with sauce. Trust me when I say that this piece of cardboard had never seen any sauce. She did bring me an itsy bitsy cup of pizza sauce that added a wee bit of flavor to the cardboard but this was a very disappointing meal. I am giving them two stars instead of one because we have eaten here several times before in the past and I'm hoping that this is just a bad night for them.
Jess M.,Hialeah  FL,21,5,2,7/21/2012,3.0,Wait was way too long  so we found bar seating. We ordered bruschetta as appetizers which never came  the food took way too long as did the dessert. I ordered a garden medley salad with shrimp and my husband had the Hawaiian salmon. Both entrees were pretty good but they left out the artichoke hearts in my salad  the main reason I ordered it! I let waiter know and she asked for a separate order or hearts  and brought them over rather quickly. Later manager came by  and I explained my appetizer and missing artichoke situation  he was nice enough to offer us dessert on the house. And the dessert was Omg  the gluten free chocolate chip pizookie was amazing! I was not blown out of the water with it all but will probably be back.
Carol S.,Hollywood  FL,0,10,,7/20/2014,2.0,Food was ok but the service was very poor. We were never offered water with our drinks. We ordered salads before our meal that never were delivered  we barely saw our server and only until I had finished my entree as the waiter was taking the plate away  did he ask me if it was good. I'll think twice before going back to this location.
Cynthia Y.,Hollywood  FL,1,15,15,4/19/2014,5.0,Love the food here  especially the pizza! All the appetizers are delish. It's pretty busy and you will have to wait to be seated  but that just shows how good it is :)
David M.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,77,4,2,8/29/2012,4.0,Decent serice but the food was amazing couldnt even finish it great place to go eat make sure u try their root beer or cream soda
Brittany M.,Plantation  FL,213,137,21,12/2/2011,3.0,The girls and I decided to try somewhere different for dinner so we voted on Bj's Brewhouse. Let me just start off by saying I was highly impressed with the warm  inviting and beautiful ambiance. The lighting is on point  and so are the employees with their spiffy uniforms. There are tvs all around and the bar is absolutely beautiful. Sounds a little silly  I know  but I just couldn't help looking at it! Our waitress was very friendly and the food was great. I'd have to say the fried artichoke hearts appetizer is my favorite! I actually craved them the other day. The strawberry lemonade is perfectly made  and the turkey sandwich I had was a-ok. My girlfriend enjoyed the Chicken Parmesan and the Fettuccini Alfredo. There is outdoor seating if you prefer  but I personally loved being inside. Enjoy!
Haydee U.,Hollywood  FL,0,1,,10/17/2011,1.0,"We went today for an early dinner @ 5pm. The waiting time was 15 mins. (not bad  but it was not rush time and there were lots of empty tables). We order the ""famous"" deep dish pizza the mini size  since they told us it was 4 slices for 1 person(I order the pig one and my husband the cheese and tomato) and my son order some corn dogs.When we saw the pizza it was like a kids meal pizza  it was supposed to be a deep dish but that was NOT deep dish pizza it was like a Pan Pizza from Pizza Hut  only more expensive ($9 for the pig one and $7 for the cheese and tomato). When we finished our pizza we were looking at my sons dish for any leftovers. We decided not to order dessert there and we went to Cheesecake Factory to get some dessert (we were hungry).Service was OK  place was nice and prices OK but I will not go again since I was very dissapointed: spent $30 for a 2 pan pizzas and some corn dogs (a very best deal is Target\'s Pizza Hut  believe me IT""S THE SAME!)"
Miguel G.,Hollywood  FL,0,5,,10/4/2012,2.0,"NOTICE How most positive reviews for this place are from ""Out-of Towners"" just saying....I\'m a self acclaimed FOODIE... I just moved to the Pembroke Pines area from Brickell (Downtown) and I\'ve been looking for a nice place up here and boy was I wrong about BJs. From beginning to end the place is a mess... Nearby my table I could see their manager trying to deal with angry customers about their service.Host Service: (Felt like I was at Applebee\'s) Waitress Staff: (THE WORST THING THIS RESTAURANT HAS GOING FOR IT)  Food: Not Bad  if it only made it to your table 40 minutes earlier...Drinks/Beers: Overpriced (for Pembroke Pines)Price: GOOD.In all fairness I must say the food is NOT terrible. It just takes all day to make it to your table. I\'ve been here 3 times now  SO I HAVE tried to give this place a chance  but there wont be a 4th time. I rather take the drive downtown/midtown or even Ft.Lauderdale and get a decent meal with great service.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY IN THIS PLACE  you owe it to yourself."
Angela G.,Miami  FL,12,16,4,1/6/2012,5.0,I give this place 5 stars in everything from food to decore to wait time. This a new place located in pembroke pines. The lobby is huge and has 2 big couches. I went with 6 of my closest friends and was seated fast the food wait time was good and the food was amazing and a big plus is their huge portions. I would reccomend this place to everyone.
Diana F.,Hollywood  FL,1,22,4,4/20/2014,2.0,I use to be in love with this place until they took every component of my usual meal off the menu. Goodbye thai chicken wontons  goodbye bacon cheeseburger pizza  goodbye red velvet pizookie. Such sadness. I've had so many awful plates here  I cant understand why they'd take off such good ones. I use to frequent it quite often  can't say the same anymore.
Enrique C.,Miami  FL,6,138,364,1/23/2012,5.0,One of my favorite restaurants. The beer and appetizers are AWESOME. The place is very beautiful. The food is great. All types of foods and drinks. The wait time was approximate 15 minutes.
Liz F.,Hialeah  FL,1,4,1,1/19/2014,1.0,"Horrible experience including having to call manager to our table. It was a Saturday night and they ran out of pizza dough for their famous deep dish! Had to order hand tossed. When the food came to our table the shareable pizza looked like a cracker. The other entree Parmesan crusted chicken  looked like a dish from a cafeteria. The vegetable was missing and the server took the entire dish back and placed 3 pieces of very small broccoli. I called the manager over and asked how much each meal cost? ""Don\'t know would have to look at menu."" I asked if the servings looked adequate for the price. ""Well the pizza doesn\'t look right it should have been stretched more."" Really?!?! Needless to say we asked for the check. The manager returned with a $20 courtesy card. Sorry but not good enough. Lastly  the manager went on to tell us that sometimes you lose a couple tables to quality a night. It just happens. Very disappointed since we are frequent diners and have loyalty card. Hope your experience is a better one."
Sidra H.,Hollywood  FL,11,5,,2/21/2012,4.0,The decor is nice  and the food isn't bad  but the veggie burger I had made my stomach hurt a bit =X
Lisa R.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,24,45,12,11/8/2011,2.0,Wait time 1 hr on a Friday night  not unexpected. Service awful! Server not knowledgeable about menu  pace of meal really long and out of sequence. I suspect it will be better once they have some experience. Not impressed at all by pizza  pizza hut is better
Yasi P.,Hollywood  FL,25,40,9,10/8/2011,5.0,At first I was sad that they knocked down on the border to put this restaurant....but let me just say I do not miss on the border at all......This restaurant is wonderful...the wait was about 40min...its a new place in pines it's going to get filled with people every weekend... They sat me in my husband in the the two people booth which I love... The decor is gorgeous... Made us feel very warm  and in Chicago... The service was spectacular.... We had the flatbread margarita pizza and is was Sokol delicious... My husband had the harvest beer  and it was super tasty... I don't drink beer but that's a beer that I will def. Drink. My husband had the Alfredo  and I had the BBQ pull pork sandwhich.... The food is very very good.....loved the service and we cannot wait to go back.
P J.,Hialeah  FL,0,2,,7/22/2012,1.0,It was brutally awful service. Heat lamp cafeteria food quality. Kitchen does not have a firm grasp of the huge menu. GO ELSEWHERE during peak times. So much for the Cheesecake Factory's sister company.
JAmerican G.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,16,129,58,10/23/2011,3.0,The food was ok  but the service was awful! They took so long to bring ur food & at one point I had to tell the waitress to tell the manager that my dessert will be free  since I had to wait 30 minutes for it!
Cathy H.,Hollywood  FL,74,46,1,8/31/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,My husband & I just visited BJ's last night for the 2nd time. I guess the newness has worn off because the wait on a Friday night was 15-/20 minutes. The food here is good  yet lacking at the same time. We ordered a flatbread pizza for an appetizer & the taste was good  but the toppings were skimpy for the $9 price. I found myself biting into flatbread with no topping on it because it was all concentrated in the middle with very little cheese. I had the Cobb salad which comes with creamy garlic dressing. It's really a chopped salad and the salad itself was very good & a just right portion  but the dressing tastes fishy to me. Blech! My hubby had fish & chips which he said was good. We then moved onto dessert. We ordered two desserts which were too many. One to share would have been good but that's our fault not the restaurant's. we ordered the fruit pie type dessert with vanilla ice cream & the chocolate brownie pie with Ice cream. Both were good but we both liked the fruit one better. To be honest I don't think I'd ever order dessert there again because it wasn't anything to write home about and added another $13 to our bill. I will say though that their hamburgers & pizzas look awesome & we both thought we would like to back & try those menu items. The place has an excellent atmosphere & good vibe. The hostesses & waitstaff are very friendly & accommodating. The only long wait this time was for our desserts  but it looked like they had to bake them so that may have counted for the long wait. We will try again but will order some different things next time.
Boris B.,Boca Raton  FL,222,18,,3/29/2012,4.0,I went here one night with my girlfriend and sister.  My girlfriend had the cajun pasta and said it was great!  My sister and friend said they loved their food so I assume it was good for them at least. I just wanted a Clam Chowder since I'm on a diet  and I was very impressed by how good the soup was! The service was good and I insist everyone tried the Clam Chowder for sure!!!!
Christopher G.,Homestead  FL,10,5,,8/19/2012,4.0,I have been to several BJ's around Fla and all are great. I was very excited to see one finally near myself. This one is smaller than the rest a little but still great inside. Food was fantastic as always. Took a while for them to get me a rewards application (Im nit-picking here). GREAT place to go for sports and great food and some great beer
Neha C.,Hollywood  FL,4,14,4,3/19/2012,3.0,I was excited to see BJ's opening here in pines after hearing so much rave on their tampa location. We went here on a wed night and waited about 5 minutes  which was a good thing. The decor is gorgeous. Service was excellent. But food was very average. Nothing special. I had their piranha beer which was really good. For appetizers we had chicken avocado rolls and stuffed mushrooms both were really good... For dinner we had mediterranean deep dish pizza which was salty... Chicken alfredo pasta was average... And Parmesan crusted chicken which was good.... For dessert I had to try their famous cookies n cream pizookie and this was probably my favorite on the menu. It was so heavenly good.... I would go back here just for the pizookie....
W F.,Newport News  VA,25,36,5,9/21/2011,5.0,"What can I say... This place takes be back to southern California when I was younger.  The awesome in house brewed beer. The ""California"" club.  Awesome pizzas. Good happy hours. I suggest you atleast give it a try and go with friends.  Get the beer sampler and go from there."
Mike C.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,26,53,30,10/25/2011,4.0,Best part of Bj's Brewhouse are the Bloody Mary's. I also had the pumpkin beer which was really tasty. I ordered a burger there  I asked for it medium... It was medium-well... I do not like sending food back  so I decided to eat it anyway. If the burger was cooked to my liking  it would have been really good. I will definitely go there again  the atmosphere is great  and the television is pretty good for viewing sporting events.
Adriana P.,Hollywood  FL,18,21,,10/16/2011,2.0,"This place recently opened in Pembroke Pines so it has been packed pretty much every day.. I tried eating there once with my husband on a Friday night and the wait was 2 hours long so we left..I finally got to try it this past Friday during lunchtime and let\'s just say I wish I had gone somewhere else...Although the decor is nice and the interior is rather appealing  I found the service to be way too overwhelming... The menu was overwhelming as well  with almost 30 pages...I ordered a Chicken Parm and it was SO SPICY.. it was so disgusting I had to return it and they took forever to bring it back out.. When they finally brought it out.. the chicken was fine  but the past was STILL SPICY... at this point  I just ate the chicken breast because I wasn\'t willing to wait any longer...Their dessert choice is ""blah"" and the rest of the food my party ordered wasn\'t anything special either.. Prices are high and definitely not worth it... I will not be going back to this place.."
Adrianna T.,Boynton Beach  FL,12,12,5,10/3/2011,5.0,Great food options that are really good! The service is top notch(ask for corey)..plus they have 42 beers on tap which is pretty amazing!!
Larry L.,Pembroke Pines  FL,0,15,,1/31/2012,2.0,Made curious by the packed lot at lunch time  my wife and I sneaked in for an early dinner at 5:15 on a Saturday. The lot was still packed  but we got a table for 2 after a 5-minute wait. Most of the multi-page menu is devoited to beer  cocktails  and wine. The food listings are difficult to make out  so I had to borrow my wife's spectacles to read them. Here goes:Beers: excellent  priced more than domestics.Margherita Fresca flatbrea pizza: it had some good flavor  but there were few discernible toppings. It looked naked compared to this chain's online photo. JUST O.K.Chicken Lettuce Wraps: bit of chicken and other ingredients  supposedly including water chestnuts and mushrooms  but I could not tell. Certainly  no crispy won-tons on top. Plenty of lettuce leaves  though. My screwup -- I didn't read that the white sauce was Chinese horseradish mustard and poured some on the first wrap. (Ruined it.) JUST O.K. Piranha Pale Ale Nachos: worst nachos I ever had. All we kept scooping up was chili-flavored beans. DON'T DO ITWhen we left at about 6  there were a whole bunch of people outside  pagers in hand  waiting for tables. Summary: A good place to go with friends for drinking and socializing  and for large portions of mediocre food.  Every sports bar I've been to serves better grub than this. Maybe if we had ordered burgers....I'll make a side trip back to try the deep-dish pizza and see how it compares to Chicago style  but for nothing else.
Michael L.,Miami-Dade  FL,0,21,,8/17/2013,3.0,"I\'ve made the mistake coming here more than twice. Every time I\'ve come it\'s the same story with the entrees. ""Sir we ran out of that  and that  and that."" Only reason I\'m giving it three stars is because they have great appetizers."
Miguel M.,Hollywood  FL,39,5,2,12/18/2011,4.0,Food is delicius; however  the wait is always huge. My suggestion is to call before heading there so they can have your name on the waiting list.
Karen C.,Hollywood  FL,0,10,,1/14/2014,2.0,"Food is typical for a chain restaurant - edible but nothing to write home about. I have been here about 5 times  usually sit at bar where I have had good service. Appetizer platter always takes over 30 minutes to get to you so they should really warn the customers about this when the order is taken. But the last time I was at this restaurant  the service was beyond rude. I have only ""stiffed"" a waiter twice in my life and this was one of them. I always leave at least 20% if not more  being in the industry myself. I understand that restaurants are at the mercy of their employees so I called to speak with management the next day as not to cause a stir in the dining room. I left my name and phone number - no return call. I wanted to give them the courtesy of knowing about poor service. Oh well  I\'ll spend my money elsewhere."
Manny L.,Hollywood  FL,0,61,5,12/15/2012,5.0,I have been here several times and it's one of my favorite restaurants in the area. The staff is friendly  the place is clean  the food is good and at a reasonable price  lots drink selection  lots of TV's all over the place with sports  etc... I come with friends and family and we always have a good time. The kids love their flat bread pizza and my wife loves their soups and salads.
Marcie P.,Hollywood  FL,0,37,9,2/13/2012,5.0,Loved the gluten free menu. They have gluten free pizza and gluten free dessert. Nice ambiance and the staff is very friendly.
Doug B.,Boynton Beach  FL,0,4,,1/18/2012,1.0,Corporate nastiness! Nothing special with the beer. They even carded me  and I'm 56 years old! Rude beyond belief!
Pedro C.,Broward  FL,1,4,,11/1/2011,5.0,This place is the perfect fit for people looking for beer and good food. Their food menu is relatively extensive considering the wide selection of beers  you would think otherwise but it is very complete. Their specialty is pizza so be sure to try it and as for the beer make sure you try theirs first by getting a sampler. Cheers!
Amado C.,Hollywood  FL,0,18,32,7/14/2013,2.0,I like BJs. My problem with this restaurant is the service. It's never consistent and most of the time you have to wait a long time. Tried talking to the manager to at least help... I got no reaction and a month later.. Same service. I will rate them a 1 star... But the reason why I take them to two is because the food and beer is great. However the management of the restaurant does not seem to care. I saw similar reviews posted.
Barry V.,Hollywood  FL,84,38,,5/29/2012,1.0,Last night was my second visit to BJ's restaurant. Duringthe first visit I thought the food was great although the service was a bit erratic. I chalked this up to the place being fairly new and the waiter being a bit overwhelmed. Last night was a disaster. The service was inattentive at best. The server could not handle the tables she had and never checked back with us to see how the food was. We ordered the Best Beginings  an appetizer combo. my daughter found a rubber band in the avocado egg roll. We presented thjis to the manager who appologized  offered a replacement which we declined since we had several more appetizers and an entree to come. He stated he would take the platter off our bill which never happened. We also ordered the ribs which were far from tender. In spite of this  I paid the full bill because I did not want to get into everything that they had done wrong and just wanted to get out of there at that point. We also had dirty flatware in our roll up and then again when they brought the dessert. Someone actually had to pick up a dirty spoon and place it on the plate!I tried to send them my comments usingtheir on-line feedback form which does not have a submit button so you can type to your hearts content but never actually submit your feedback. I commented after my first visit (there was a submit button then but the pembroke Pines restaurant was not on the drop down list att hat point) and they never responded. Obviously  their laid back california attitude does not allow for feedback or replies. This is on my never again list of places to avoid.
William T.,Miami  FL,0,34,,8/12/2013,4.0,Ate at Orlando location & loved it. Service was a bit slow  but the bartender (manager) was very friendly  explained the menu. I had a BBQ slider  skinny fries & BBQ Chix breast & Cole Slaw. The slaw tasted like nothing but cabbage with milk poured over it. Horrid. The rest of the food was great  prices a bit steep  but not too bad. I live in Miami & will soon try the newly opened Miami location as I pass it on the way home. I'd definitely go back to try something else from their very extensive menu. Loved the place  decor  etc. 
Allan B.,Hollywood  FL,0,10,,7/7/2012,1.0,While the waitress staff is very good and relatively attentive  the food is both from a quality point of view and basic cooking appalling. Green beans served Luke warm and undercooked. Pork chops were apparently reheated and hard  with the best of two meals being the mashed potatoes. Surprising in a facility where money and thought were obviously put into the restaurant decor. Maybe that is the problem: all the seed money went to plant with no cash leftover to hire decent cooks.
Casper P.,Hollywood  FL,0,35,,9/12/2012,4.0,Kid friendly staff. I enjoy the apps and bar b ques chicken salad. Pizza is good. Get the small. Beer is very good. I like the different beer options. A little pricey but  overall very good.
C T.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,17,,3/23/2014,1.0,disgusting food...hamburgers taste like whoppers
Stephanie S.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,7,8,,1/3/2012,5.0,Our server was Tara  she was great  very attentive. The food was excellent  we got the best beginnings as an appetizer  it had a little of everything  two types of egg rolls  mozzarella sticks  chips and dip. The appetizer did such a good job of filling us up that each one of us took home leftovers. We ordered the jambalaya which was true to its form with rice. My husband was happy with the black and blue burger  and I had the blonde shrimp  which were a little over-done - but still good. The drinks were delicious. My friend and I both had the BJ's Irish Root beer - we will definitely get these again. My husband tried a couple different brews  he liked the Oktoberfest the best. The restaurant is extremely popular and usually has a wait. They encourage you to call ahead and put your name on the wait list. We got there expecting a wait  so it didn't dampen our mood  which was good because our wait was longer than quoted. All in all we had good food and good service and will be visiting again.
Priscilla B.,Alexandria  VA,1,6,1,12/25/2011,2.0,Location is very good  but the service was not good. The waiter was never around and neglected to bring two items I had ordered. We had to ask another waiter for assistance because our waiter was no where to be found. The floor around the hostess station was VERY slippery as I was walking to the restrooms. The food its self was okay but nothing that really stood out. I think the beer selection is what they have going for them. I will go back but not to be served by the same waiter.
Anna D.,Hollywood  FL,0,5,,5/15/2012,5.0,amazing amazing resteraunt  the angus beef sliders tender  mouth watering and delicious. the half baked potato so big and yummy couldnt even finish. the french fries crispy and yummy. chicken parmesan was flavorful and delicious not oversauced. mu husbands steak cooked to perfection. the only complaints were his steak fries were dry and his mojito was mostly ice. and my fountain drink tasted a little flat  i think they needed to clean the machines  other than that everything else was amazing :)  going back next month :D
Scott S.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,0,1,,2/29/2012,5.0,I eat at Bjs every weekend and its got to the point where the blonde host at the front even remembers my name. I give the girl a lot of credit she always seems so calm and has a smile even though theres a line out the door and people throwing pagers in her face. I must say they do have great front of house staff but some of the servers need a little more training. The food is great and I also enjoy going during happy hour specials. I will continue coming here
Nick M.,Hollywood  FL,0,3,,10/9/2011,4.0,Very nice addition to Pembroke Pines area. Food was good and atmosphere is superior to most bistro/sports bar places in the area. Staffing and service will take time for a restaurant this large to operate efficiently  but that is to be expected. Family friendly plus a very cool bar area  which includes one of the best and biggest flat screens I've ever scene. Most restaurants in area are run down and tired  this place has a beautiful and comfortable build out. Just hope clientele stays as upscale as restaurant.
Jinjer S.,Fort Lauderdale  FL,43,4,,11/10/2011,1.0,I alway drove pass this place and I could not wait until it open for business. The place was clean and roomy with lots of big screen tv's which was the only plus i had on my first visit to BJ's restaurant. I just finish the race for the cure in Miami and I wanted to tried out the new restaurant BJ's  which was close to my house. I order the chicken & fries  but the chicken came to the table under cook. I brought it to the attention of my waiter and he took it back to the kitchen. But one thing that made me decided not to never go back to this restaurant again was the Manager. The name he gave was JR and he told me the chicken was not under cook because they stored it in freezer. He went on to say its suppose look that way and they lightly cook the chicken that way. I explained to him the meat was little pink and white and it have nothing to do with the freezer. He stated I guess we will have to cook it crispy for you. He left and never came back even when the waiter brought back my the food. I think its unprofessional to blame the customer for half done food and treat them like they did something wrong. (Getting serve undone food is not cool and can be a health hazard)
