Christine B.,San Jose  CA,56,112,48,12/5/2017,4.0,This is your typical chain restaurant/brewery. I've been here for a couple good happy hours and some dinners while out doing errands. The happy hour is a great setup with good options and prices. I believe you can only get it while sitting in the bar  so be sure to ask to be seated there if you want to take advantage of the deals. I've been here a few times  so the services has varied in its quality. The last time I visited  the server was great. He was attentive  helpful and friendly. But I've also had experiences where the servers have gone missing and I've had to ask other servers for assistance. So I think it really depends on your luck in who is assigned to your table. The food has always been good. The beer is really good too and there are lots of options. The pizookie is their famous dessert. I had a bite of one the last time I was there. They are VERY good  but the calories are a little scary. They're listed on the menu  so no surprises there!There are lots of TVs  so the sports nut in your party will be happy too.
Ronnie B.,San Jose  CA,0,62,,11/13/2017,1.0,"""Shitty food  Shitty service"" should be the catch phrase to this place. I took my parents and kids here for a bite to eat to take advantage of the veteran deal( What a joke that was$12.95 off). So we were seated within 10 mins of entering the building. But  or waiter was clearly not giving us the same attention she gave other tables. Took almost 20 minutes to get our drinks. Then after we ordered she messed up the special request I ask for the kids meal. So the kids no longer wanted to eat. I ask for extra sauce for my meal and by the time she brought it I was almost done eating my nasty meal which had no flavor. I Don\'t think ill be going back anytime soon."
Tushar S.,San Jose  CA,71,52,112,11/11/2017,3.0,This location has always provided 4 star service (at least in terms of burger quality)  but today was somewhat of a disappointing experience.There was a 45 minute waitlist when we got there but we waited more than an hour until our name was called.I ordered the Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts for appetizers and the Seared Ahi Salad for my entree. While our food was good  the general customer service was sub par. The appetizers came soon  but we had to ask for silverware  twice  while our appetizer waited to be devoured.We were served by three servers (????) and our final server (Cristal) was the best. She was diligent  and checked on us multiple times. In the end  both dishes tasted pretty good. The sprouts were well baked and nicely seasoned  and the ahi salad was well cooked and dressed.This location has ample parking and both indoor & outdoor seating.
Lily L.,Santa Clara  CA,36,534,2073,11/11/2017,2.0,Not a big fan of BJ's food. Avocado egg rolls were pretty good with the dipping sauce. The prime rib was over cooked (asked for medium-rare and it came out medium-well). The picture in the menu of the prime rib showed a red piece of meat  but ours was brown. The Caesar salad was bland. The avocado bacon burger was average tasting. The monkey bread pizookie was OK. The vanilla ice cream was good but how can you go wrong with that? The monkey bread was like a hard Cinnabon.BJ has good beers at a reasonable price. The only real positive note was we had a nice server.
Julie L.,San Jose  CA,430,50,197,10/27/2017,1.0,"Why doesn\'t Yelp have the option for zero stars? When I saw the ratings for this BJ\'s  I wondered why it was so low. After today  I realize that the rating should probably be worse.My rating of this establishment is based solely on the SERVICE presented by the hostess at 6:30pm today. Please note that I never even had the opportunity to dine before leaving this review. I learned through the grapevine that her name is Elyza? Alyza? She is an Asian female hostess. I have been wanting a pizzookie all week for some reason (maybe because BJ\'s was target marketing me on ig). So lo and behold  after a long week of work  I decided to take my mom here to have her first pizzookie. We arrived around 6:30pm  where the hostess (Alyza/Elyza) told me it would be a 10-15 minute wait for two. She took down my name and I told her I\'d be outside / around the area.So  I went back to my car to drop off some stuff  went to target to pick up an online order  came back within 10 minutes  and asked for my table. She asked for my name  and then asked  ""Did you get a text?"" I was very confused and told her that she never asked for my number for me to receive a text. She acted flustered/confused (so i\'m not sure if she may be new or not)  but proceeded to ask me for my name again. I told her  ""Julie. for 2."" To which she responded that she can\'t find my name in the system ""for some reason."" So she decided to play it off and add me in the system  while telling me it would be 10-15 minutes. Note that this is IN ADDITION to the 10-15 she originally quoted and it was clearly her fault that she did not put my name into the system the first time around. I\'m not sure what kind of system BJ\'s uses  but I\'ve worked in restaurants before (and have worked as a hostess) and it literally takes a lot to mess something up that is as easy as putting someone\'s name/party in the system. I\'d also like to point out that there weren\'t many other people waiting for a table at that time. If there were 10+ people waiting outside  I could probably see how that can happen  but when I came to put my name down  there were only 6 people at best. Spend your money elsewhere."
Benny H.,San Jose  CA,2005,1437,7836,9/2/2017,4.0,"Always surprised at the low reviews BJ\'s gets  especially from the Yelp crowd. I\'ve never had a bad experience and while the wait times can be a little silly at times  the overall experience is normally really good. Came here yesterday with the family and never actually stepped foot at this location. It was nice and cool in here and great to deal with the heat wave hitting the Bay. We were seated almost right away  but missing silverware  which they were ""low"" on. Kinda weird to be low on silverware? I was able to get what I wanted to eat  which was a menu choice on their old menu. The burger melt is fantastic!Overall  it was a pleasant experience  with great food and drinks. Thumbs up!"
Kait P.,San Jose  CA,86,167,96,9/30/2017,4.0,Came here with a girl friend for an early dinner and had great service and food! I think I prefer this one over the one at Oakridge but both are really good.We were seated within five minutes of our arrival and had a nice booth. Our waitress was really nice and quick with our order.Food is always good and naturally we ordered a pazookie after!Definitely will return
Tiffany B.,Oakland  CA,105,155,286,6/1/2017,1.0,I came here for a quick bite to eat in between appointments and let me tell you it was anything but quick. I ordered the lunch stromboli and fries. By the time I got my food the fries were not fresh out the fryer hot  whatever  I hate complaining.The wrap itself was just ok. Nothing to write home about and nothing to order again. I finish and they ask if I want dessert. Sure why not. It was Tuesday and the pizookie was $3 so I ordered the white chocolate macadamia nut. I literally waited a good 20 minutes before receiving it. I asked for the check as soon as he sat down the cookie. I gave him my card and waited and waited and waited. I got so irritated I just walked up to the front to see the delay. The server made up some bs excuse about the system being down. Thank goodness this isn't my home town BJ's but they better importune they're service big time.The service was so bad I could've bring myself to tip.
Victoria N.,San Jose  CA,141,167,150,10/25/2017,4.0,First time that I've been to the BJ's here since they opened up several years ago. Came for a friend's birthday and we had a party of 7 on a Thursday night after 7pm. We really liked our server  she made conversation and she was also funny. She was a true believer in servers making some kind of conversation with their tables or else  you'd be a boring server. All of our food came out at roughly the same time and there wasn't too much complaint for the food except there was a lot of oil in some of my table's pasta. My chicken Alfredo could have used more salt/seasoning though  but there was no trace of oil  thank god :)Drinks weren't too bad  the white peach that my bf had was quite sweet. BUT you could taste the tequila :) Also  they ran out of bread and the servers that brought out our food didn't advise us  we had to ask our server who explained more should be coming out and they probably ran out. Would have been nice to know when our food was brought out instead of pointing out that only one person had bread and 4 others didn't. Additionally  our server failed to notice that we didn't have utensils and still didn't realize this when our food was served. We had to flag her down and she came back with utensils for us  two trips. My plate was the only one who had utensils  but it was a spoon.. for pasta... Other than the missing utensils and waiting around for them  the atmosphere was loud and casual. Great company with friends  we got lucky with our server and surprisingly  the food wasn't all that bad and came out at the same time. Best part of the night was their trio pizcookies! I recommend the oreo one  this tastes a lot more like chocolate  but I didn't mind. Delicious  but 3 is probably not enough for a group of 7  probably 4 if you aren't all that stuffed. Plenty of parking in this plaza as well.
Cynthia L.,Santa Clara  CA,434,153,172,8/24/2017,3.0,Came here with a friend while waiting to kill some time. We were happy to find out that it was happy hour.Standard BJ's experience except we waited on utensils for a while. Also finished our drinks and it took 10+ minutes to flag down a server to get another drink. Then it took another 10 minutes to find the server again to get our check. Still a 3-star review because I always enjoy the food + beer at BJ's. This one just seems a bit disorganized.
Archana R.,San Jose  CA,125,168,298,11/5/2017,2.0,Strictly for a takeout order:Did a takeout order online and requested the dish to be without meat. When I got to the restaurant  I was pleasantly surprised that my food was ready. I asked to check the item to make sure it didn't have meat but to my disappointment  it did. The lady seemed surprised and offered to take it back. She said the manager was making a new one and it would be a few minutes. She then proceeded to charge me for the dish  which I was shocked it would be the same price even though I requested no meat. Not to mention the screw up with the food. The food itself was bland to taste. Had to season it myself. I've never done takeout at BJs and I hardly eat here anymore but I'll likely not do takeout from here again. Got skimped on the breadstick too!
Rupa S.,Malvern  PA,133,225,98,8/10/2017,3.0,The food here is kinda ok-ish not the best.Their spinach artichoke dip is good but didn't like anything else. Definitely try their pizookie though - absolutely amazing.
Steph F.,Milpitas  CA,816,702,1395,7/21/2017,1.0,If you have time waste  go ahead and come here. Otherwise  stay clear! I don't remember the last time I've been to a BJ's but my visit today reminded me why I've stayed away for so long! This place has SLOW service! I think it took 30 minutes before our salads came and then another 15+ minutes until our entrees came. Overall  our group lunch (party of 7 people) took about 2 hours. The restaurant wasn't even busy to begin with! Their menu is extensive but nothing really stands out - think of Cheesecake Factory menu size. Food here is a bit on the pricey side for the quality of food you are getting. They do have lunch specials towards the back of the menu if you're looking for something less pricey. Since I couldn't decide what to order  I just opted for their lunch special (unlimited) soup and salad which was a little under $10. I got the mozzarella tomato salad and a bowl of the clam chowder. The salad was okay but on the small side compared to what I would have gotten if I ordered a different salad. The clam chowder tasted like something that came from a can. Even if I were to ask for another salad or soup  I think the wait would be ridiculously long so I didn't ask for another round  not like I had the chance to anyways since our server never came back.Their only somewhat redeeming factor was that it was FREE pazookie day! According to their website  each table was limited to one free order. We ordered a classic chocolate chip pazookie and the new churro pazookie. This took another 30 minutes so maybe put your order in ahead of time if you know you're gonna want dessert. The wait time was still ridiculous but I'm hoping that meant it was because they're freshly made. The table behind us ordered their pazookie after us yet received it before us so we were suspicious that they mistaking given our order to them instead. When we finally received our pazookies  we were surprised to receive an extra churro pazookie due to their mistake. The chocolate chip cookie one was way too sweet and overwhelming but the churro one was actually pretty good. They had a stack of mini churros topped with ice cream.In the end  our server comped all 3 pazookies but that didn't make up for the rediculous wait times for our food. If this wasn't a special work lunch  I don't think I would have made it to work on time during my normal lunch hours. Stay clear of this place if you can. Not even the pazookies are good enough for me to want to come back here. Besides  there are many other food options available here at the Coleman Market Center.
Melissa L.,Portland  OR,1443,1028,767,2/7/2017,2.0,I've given this place 2 tries and I'm done. Located in a strip mall with a Target  parking can be a challenge in this lot.The first time I visited  I tried the Fire Roasted Barbacoa Chicken. A bit on the dry side  but glad to see they have a selection of Low-Calorie Entrees. My issue that evening was the service. Could not get refills because server never returned once our food was brought out. In fact  I had to go to other servers to track down our server so that we could get the check to leave.Returned for a second visit  thinking that maybe that was just a fluke. Nope. This time around the service was better  but the food was worse. Tried the BJ's Tavern Cut Pizza. It looked nothing like the pictures. Something as simple as spreading the ingredients wasn't done. There were clumps of meat slices. In addition  one member of our party ordered the standard deep dish and it came out very greasy. This BJ's is disappointing.
Sonam K.,San Jose  CA,32,41,137,2/11/2017,2.0,It's kinda like a knock-off of Cheesecake Factory  with a sports-bar feel. Came here on a game-night and it was pretty full with a wait. The food is pretty average (definitely sub-par to Cheesecake). We got appetizers and dessert and skipped the main course entirely. We were stuffed by the end. Our waiter was very pleasant. But the service is a bit slow - we could see he was running in circles.Ambiance is casual and sporty. Pizookie didn't live up to my expectations.
Tram N.,San Jose  CA,619,2341,9265,7/2/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Extremely slow service and it's slow. I am sitting here waiting for my check to come out. We waited nearly 10 minutes for someone to come to our table. I regret ordering the Ghirardelli Pizookie because it was dry. The brownie was hard as a rock. I don't think you should be charging anyone anything for that kind of dessert. I want my calories and money back. N.E.V.E.R. A.G.A.I.N.
Alisher K.,Mountain View  CA,45,27,56,8/31/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,The staff  hostess and the rest of the BJ's crew are the best!!!I don't get any of the negative reviews. It took them 15 min max from the moment we were seated to take the order  cook it and serve it at our table. Great attitude  friendly behavior and good manners.Definitely 5 star experience
Alicia Marie P.,San Jose  CA,210,222,82,1/26/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"Well. Thought enough time had passed and I\'d try again. Again  terrible. The funniest part tho was my wings. Clearly says ""sauce on side"". Of course  there\'s sauce on them. And the lady goes ""oh. So like. You actually wanted the sauce on the side? We didn\'t know. I guess they can remake them if you want to wait"" Like honestly. Wtf so bad it\'s funny"
Robert W.,Saint Petersburg  FL,5,2,,9/27/2017,2.0,This restaurant has a problem.I feel it is very bad management.We went to this BJ's for dinner as we had just flew in from Florida for a. Vacation .There was a football game on and the bar area was full.We did not want to sit in the bar and were told we would be put on a waiting list for a table other people were now coming in and were told the same.I asked why we were not being seated and we're informed that we would not be seated until 5:30.They had no help scheduled til than! 15-20 people had to wait with more coming in!Why would they not stagger their schedules just in case such a situation occurred.The employees came in at 5:30 and were under such pressure to wait on the customers not a good situation . After reading other reviews of this restaurant you better react now. Bad for the Corporate image.
Court S.,Oakland  CA,923,869,1765,6/4/2017,2.0,This location is closer to home but I prefer the Cupertino one in terms of service and food quality (the only downside is horrible parking).Every time I come here there is either no silverware on the table  no napkins  empty dinner dishes left on our table as dessert is being served  absent minded waitstaff  etc.Last night our pizookies were rock hard  cold and we had to order freshly baked ones. The time before the ice cream was melted and we were told that the freezer was broken. Really though? I'll still continue to come here  but know to expect some sort of snafu.
Kalani S.,San Jose  CA,2,25,140,6/8/2017,4.0,Ok. I have been to this BJ location few times.And there are pro and con at this BJ location.1) Food: the Food serving is more of a continental style....what it mean it have litter of everything...From Thai style avocado egg roll to Hawaiian poke and Texas style rack of ribs.A) the taste is good for the price you paidB) service is ok. And it really depend on the day and the time of the dayC) it's an family style and social style restaurant . 2) environment is up beat and drinks are good with lots of selections3) Pro: it have great long business hour. Con: they don't take reservation for parties of two... weird only this location don't allow reservation for 2 people.Overall great place to hang out...
Christina G.,San Jose  CA,1,9,2,11/19/2017,1.0,Very disappointed   this place was filthy... as soon as u walk in was trash all over the entrance   the restrooms were trashy   trash cans over flowing  you know the saying if the restrooms are dirty  than the kitchen has to be worse.... did not once see a Mgr on floor  The only thing good about the place was our server Michael he was very attentive
Melissa M.,San Francisco  CA,67,11,,11/25/2017,1.0,We put our name on the waiting list and was told 10-15minutes for a table. Thirty minutes later I walk in and ask the hostess with drawn on black eyebrows and dark lipstick how much longer for our party of 5 and she tells me we're next. Shortly after a party 8 is called and then I ask my bf to go in and ask again  this same girl tells him there's a party of 5 ahead of us. How does that make any sense!?!? So I walk in and tell her--you told me one thing and him another  what's the deal? She had no explanation so we literally just walked out. Headed to Red Robin! Horrible customer service. NEVER AGAIN!!!
Makenzi B.,Santa Clara  CA,31,87,89,5/12/2017,3.0,Slowest. Service. Every. Single. Time. Why?!?! I usually enjoy the food and I love that they have a wide menu. I liked their deep dish pizza  portables mushroom burger  tomato bisque soup...and Pizookies? Yes  please! Salted caramel & Oreo are my favorites. But seriously  service always seems slow and unresponsive. Some servers aren't as interested as others. For example  last week we had a server and halfway through our meal she went on break. The server that filled in for her came to our table to drop off our check and one of us asked for a refill  he took her cup and jetted off all fast and never asked any of us if we wanted one too? We would have asked ourselves but we didn't even get the chance! Oh  and piles of dishes were still left on our table. Even appetizer plates. Our dessert came out to the table with still  appetizer plates  dinner plates  and side plates stacked up all over our table. Seriously?
Lynne Marie Raguindin B.,Los Gatos  CA,49,520,552,6/4/2017,4.0,It is way less crowded here than the airport. We opted to sit in the bar . Waited for about 10 min and no one came to us so we decided to sit at the bar top. Service was eh. We kept having to ask for refills where our food was. It has been a while since I have been to this restaurant. The wings were prepared different from how I was used to. My husband said his sandwich was amazing.Lots of patio seating. I will defiantly come here over the Oakridge one.
Patty G.,San Jose  CA,2,50,98,5/16/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,So I came back to this location and this time around my experience was a lot better. Our waitress was so sweet and kind. Most of the food was great and our strawberry lemonades were delicious. I do think they should immediately change their broccoli cheddar soup recipe cause it was unappetizing! But the booth was clean when we sat down and the restaurant seemed pretty chill for 3:30pm.
Anita L.,Union City  CA,338,582,366,3/26/2017,2.0,Came here for a brunch meeting in the late morning. We were served family style with some options pre-chosen for us. It was the weirdest combination that I've ever had - breakfast pizza  salad  french fries  and a deli sandwich. While the breakfast pizza was actually pretty tasty  the rest of the food was pretty basic. The deli sandwich in particular was kinda gross - I think I could have gotten a better sandwich from the prepackaged section at the grocery store. I also ordered an iced coffee which came out tasty kinda watered down and not nearly as strong as I expected it to be. While the staff was friendly enough  overall the food experience here left me wanting for more. I wouldn't choose to come back to this location.
Veronica S.,San Jose  CA,6,87,6,11/23/2016,4.0,Date night with the hubster brought us to BJs for their 2 for $25  and I must say it's a nice bang for the buck!I got the chicken tortilla soup and it was a bit salty  the broccoli cheddar my hubby got was better.Deep dish was yumm and the monkey bread pizooki was bomb! Nice service  5 min wait to get seated and 10 there after for food over all  not a bad experience!
Gigi G.,San Jose  CA,1,13,,9/25/2017,5.0,We had just ended a really tough couple of days  packing and moving. We decided we would try BJs because of location and we simply didn't want to cook  to tired. Along comes Andrew  who had a big smile  genuine smile  and proceeded to make our day! You see he is also a brew master there  and just was what we needed! He brought drinks promptly  helped with our order  even went to mgr. with a special request for us! He couldn't have been more friendly and professional  it doesn't happen often around here  we WILL be back!
Manisha C.,Rancho Mirage  CA,41,3,1,11/2/2017,5.0,Great salad and service last night. Our waiter was Carlos and he provided great service. Santa Fe Salad is the best. We also ordered Kale and Brussels sprouts salad which was also really yummy. Thanks BJs.
Martin N.,New York  NY,370,85,90,7/29/2017,4.0,I will always come to BJ's for their pizookies. They are seriously the best ever!! But of course  the rest of the menu is great. Be careful of the machine on the table. I played around with it too much and ended up accidentally paying for the games  which is my fault. Though I wish it was more clear about it.
Debbie D.,Scotts Valley  CA,35,37,7,10/11/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Sorry  but I rarely give a bad rating. The deep fried artichoke hearts were salty and burnt. The server forgot our lemon that we wanted for our water  then brought them over with his bare hands and plopped them in our glasses after handling money. They forgot my sandwich order  so I didn't bother to wait. This is my last trip here.
Clay C.,San Jose  CA,62,42,42,3/12/2017,4.0,I haven't been here in ages  but it was Pizzookie time!What I ordered: The bbq brisket and bacon burger with fries and a PM Porter. The burger on first taste was packed with bbq flavor and very over powering sauce. But then  the brisket flavor kicked in and it was very savory. The fries were very nicely battered and crispy as well. The PM Porter was my favorite part and was smooth and very chocolately. We also ordered the salted caramel Pizookie which was amazing  but definitely does have a very salty taste! Be prepared haha!Dislikes: I liked our server  but she was very short with my girlfriend and I.Tips: While you wait at this location you can go to Target or other stores around the area. Also they will text you when your table is ready!
Bjorn R.,Santa Clara  CA,130,201,4313,9/24/2016,5.0,I can only speak of the bar area because that is practically where my wife and I sit when we eat/drink there. First  great wide selection of beers on tap! Second  friendly bartenders...you don't have to wait too long for a cold one. And third  they have a freaking huge television for times you run out of things to talk and just want to watch! Beer  great service  and huge tv...what more does a guy need right?!? Guinness on tap is my favorite  and I usually get the proper way of pouring it in a glass...I like the reverse happy hour from 10-close M thru F. As good is concern  it is a bit pricy and a hit or miss. However  overall my wife and I love going here just to chill and relax and have drinks!
Alan W.,San Francisco  CA,346,17,4,8/17/2017,5.0,I love this place. Great foods and superior services. I always come here for major sports events and man  do they make it fun. the service is always quick and and precise  even with all the patrons in there. I highly recommend if you have any major events or just come to watch your favorite team play  this is the place.
Amanda N.,Santa Clara  CA,222,321,563,9/4/2016,4.0,Had my birthday dinner here with family and the service here was great w/ our server (Matt?) positive attitude and great service all around. Came on a Tuesday evening and it wasn't too busy. Ordered the buffalo wings  great white mini pizza  and the ahi tuna salad. Buffalo wings had the right amount of sauce and the great white pizza will always be my favorite. The ahi tuna was still good but the ahi tuna is a little smaller. Pazookie chocolate chip on the house for your bday! I could seriously come here just for the dessert. The only restaurant I would want to save room for dessert.
Da Kat A.,San Jose  CA,20,16,,10/19/2017,2.0,"I\'ve been here many times. Almost every time I come (95%) and after ordering appetizers  they don\'t give us any silverware and plates. The appetizers arrived first and all we could do was to stare at our food  then had to get someone to get us plates and silverwares.Tonight is worse. We got seated at a booth but one of the booth is dirty (still with food particles on it). I stood there and waited for 10 mins  no one bothered to come check or clean it. I walked closer to the cash register area and saw a bunch of waiters/waitresses just hung out there to chat and watch TV. I had to ""interrupt"" them and then somehow finally came to clean the booth.Their service sucks and they don\'t care if you just stand there by the table  or if you don have any silverwares/plates to eat your appetizers."
denise q.,San Jose  CA,4,8,2,11/1/2017,5.0,We came here to celebrate my daughters accomplishment  there was about 15 of us  We had the best and most patient waitress named Danielle  She took great care of us and our crying kid!  Thank you for accommodating all of us. We had a great time ..... Denise
Laura M.,San Jose  CA,9,10,4,11/1/2017,2.0,"Ok am giving this place two stars both are for our server who tried his best. A for effort dude! But  the meals  when they came to the table looked nothing like they did in the menu. My Ahi salad was like warm. The Calamari app was Soo salty and cold. The strawberry desert was floating in a sea of strawberry puree  and maybe there was 1strawberry cut into quarters. This is a chain  I would expect consistency. ""Sadfaceimojihere"""
Jia Qi F.,East Bay  CA,551,195,422,1/9/2017,2.0,We got seated at 8PM and we didnt get to leave by 11PM on a Sunday night...how is this possible?! Answer: slow service to the MAX. Food was mediocre and overpriced  nothing too fancy about it. I usually come here for the pizookies anyways. We ordered a mini salted caramel pizookie and it was pretty bomb. I was a little sad that our icecream basically melted by the time we got it but I was over it. We loved the ### of TVs in this place. Slow service however kinda ruined it for me and our party.
Adrian D.,San Jose  CA,1,5,,9/24/2017,1.0,I don't usually write reviews  but our experience at this BJ's was absolutely terrible. First of all  we called ahead to ask about the wait time. We were told that it would be a 10 - 15 minute wait  so we asked if we could put our names down over the phone. The host put our names down  but when we got to the restaurant 10 minutes later  we were told that we would still need to wait 10 - 15 minutes for our table. Once we sat down  the service was so slow  it was almost non-existent. It took forever for the waiter to get to our table (mind you  this was a Slow Sunday evening) just to take our drink orders. It also took forever for us to get our food. But that wasn't even the worst part. I ordered the jambalaya  and when I bit into the shrimp  it was raw! When this was brought to the waiter's attention he offered to re-fire another plate but I just asked him to bring another portion of shrimp in order to make it easier on the staff. This re-fired portion of shrimp literally came at the end of the meal when everything else on the plate was finished. Also  my boyfriend's Dad ordered a pizza and asked for light sauce because of how the acidity affects his stomach. He politely emphasized this when the waiter was reading back the order  but when the order finally came  it was with extra sauce!! Everyone else (we came with 6 people) didn't care much for their food either. Every plate that came to the table was cold which made the already bad quality food taste even worse. None of us will be coming back to this or possibly any BJ's ever again.
Eleuterio O.,Los Angeles  CA,6,8,4,10/29/2017,5.0,I love this place! The food  the atmosphere  the service; you name it  everything is good. Any restaurant we have visited  we always get the same service  from down in San Diego to up in the Bay Area. Whenever we're out and about  I'm always looking for one. Highly recommend them all.
Amy A.,Austin  TX,86,23,3,11/19/2017,1.0,I am a female who visited your location  dining alone I chose to sit at the bar. It was busy so I patiently waited before the bartender took my drink order and offered me a menu. A female bartender joined the male bartender who previously tended to me. The stood at the opposite end of the bar visiting as he prepared drinks. She was more interested in flirting with the busy male bartender to notice the patrons. When they looked at my end of the bar I raised my hand to signal I was ready to place my order. They returned to their personal conversation giving no indication they acknowledged me. The female bartender eventually sauntered down and offered to take my order. I ordered the sirloin steak medium rare. When the meal arrived the steamed broccoli was cold in spots and the mashed potatoes were firm  not fluffy  and lukewarm. The medium rare steak I ordered was well done and dry. I let the bartender know the meal was disappointing but chose not to send it back because I was too hungry to wait for another meal to come out. Later the bartended asked if the manager came out to talk to me and they had not at that point. I was in a call when someone finally decided to come talk to me  but I let them know I was on the phone. The man apologized and left but never came back. I've waited about 20 minutes and still no one has come to talk to me about this awful experience. I shall not return to this BJs location. The service is poor and the food was less than stellar.
Keith D.,Minneapolis  MN,1,6,,7/15/2017,1.0,This was such a disappointing experience. A couple few months ago  I went to this BJ's for lunch. I had the grilled cheese with bacon  avocado  and tomato. I've been craving it ever since. I finally had an opportunity to return for lunch.I went to order the same thing but couldn't find it on the menu. Jackie told me I could still order it. (You should it back to the menu.) I ordered the sandwich and requested that the fried be extra crispy.Jackie brought me by Tontonka stout and that was the last I saw of her. Sadly for me  she was given a party of at least 15 people. While she was taking their drink orders  someone else delivered my order. The sandwich was perfect and exactly what I remembered. The fries were soft  not extra crispy.But no one ever checked back with me to ask about my food  and I didn't get the chance to flag down anyone else either. At first  I thought I would just eat my sandwich  and then eat the fries after they were correctly prepared. I don't necessarily mind eating one item at a time.Sadly  by the time I was done with my sandwich  Jackie had just appeared with the drink orders. I was ready to leave by then. I had planned on ordering dessert  but I paid my bill via the app and left. Jackie was still handing out drinks.I did not get to eat the part of my order that I paid for (fries) and I did not get to order dessert. Very disappointing.Your hosts (and managers in this case) should never seat such a large party at the same time as a 1-4 top. The upfront work required for ordering guarantees that someone is going to get ignored--not from bad service  but simple logistics. It takes a long time to get take down drink orders and fulfill them. It can be even longer when it comes to the meal (though at least there's a gap while the cooks prepare the food).Please note that this is not necessarily Jackie's fault. The host slammed her and made it impossible for her to serve me well. If that large party and I had been seated an very different times  there likely would have been less interference with good service to both parties.The wifi didn't work either. :-(
Harris W.,Los Gatos  CA,1,18,4,8/16/2017,1.0,Tonight was a disaster. Three meals ordered. When two arrived after a 30 min wait we were told the 3rd order isn't served on Tues. Wow after 30 min and with 2 orders arriving its oops sorry would you like to see a menu. Fast forward another 30 minutes the replacement dish arrives ICE cold. WTF.For our troubles here's a gift card and no charge tonight. How about firing the waitress who phones it in. She didn't give a sh** about anything.
Rosh M.,San Jose  CA,0,13,,8/25/2017,1.0,If you wanna wait 15 minutes to be approached by a server at your table  45 minutes for water  another 30 minutes to order food on top of 30 minutes to wait for said food  and an additional 40 minutes for the check... be my guest. I can't even blame the servers cause they've got a lot to do and they're human; I get it. I blame the management for not setting their team up for success and I hope this BJs reputation can be salvaged -- until then  won't be patronizing here and do not recommend to anyone. Food's whatever  too. Not worth the time or money.
Cynthia H.,Walnut Creek  CA,0,3,,10/26/2017,1.0,Went here today for lunch with a colleague and ordered the cherry chipotle salmon  which in the past has been tasty. The service was slow. The asparagus was woody and dry--obviously very old. I reported this and received tasteless  steamed mixed vegetables in return. When I was halfway through the meal  I discovered a pubic hair in it. So I won't be going back.
Mike H.,Hudsonville  MI,149,111,209,11/21/2016,2.0,Went here after a long day of travel. Myself and a couple of colleagues got there after 8:00 to grab a late dinner. I was starving and the waiter took our drink order really fast  which was promising but I was misled. That was the last quick thing that happened for us that evening. Our drinks showed up and then the waiter totally evaporated  he was swallowed up by the throng. It was over 35 minutes until he returned to take our order and another 50 until our food arrived. The burger was lackluster at best but I devoured it based on my basic need for food. I don't think I'll be back here again.
Sherin L.,Santa Clara  CA,365,182,221,6/15/2017,5.0,Great hang out place after work. Easy parking (at least for me depends on time)  great service  good food. Our server is great comparing to other reviews  I prefer this location than others just because I hate waiting in line.
Jon H.,San Luis Obispo  CA,302,117,191,8/2/2016,5.0,Great experience recently. Went in for the afternoon and got an app for free with a 10$ purchase. Sign up for the app and the coupon is there. Or take the link in Yelp. Free wifi. Great beer choices from amber to IPA to red to Hefeweizen that they make themselves plus about 20 other beers on tap. Avocado egg rolls and veggie burger is usually my order but all burgers  salads  apps  and main dishes look good as well. Pizza looks like a winner too. Not sure why this place is a 2.5 because it's been good food and service all five times I have been here. Sometimes it can have a long line. Lastly  the day time bartender  Stephanie  was nice  helpful and definitely added to our experience.
Myrna C.,Hawthorne  CA,1,46,14,10/14/2017,3.0,Ordered wings and a salad. Wings came out first and I waited almost 15 more minutes for my salad.  Ordered the monkey bread pizookie.... sad part was they brought it out with chocolate ice cream bc they had run out of vanilla...... on a Sunday night.  How do u run out of vanilla ice cream??
Dee K.,Cupertino  CA,72,12,,8/16/2017,1.0,Every time I visit this specific location  I always seem to have a bad experience. I visited other locations have never had any problems. Let's start with the servers  extremely inconsiderate  will get you your utensils once the food is completely cold! I got chicken thyme plate and could barley bite into my chicken  of course it was taken off my bill. Seriously? I wasted 30 mins to be seated another 30 mins to get my food and another 10 mins to get my utensils  just to bite into food that wasn't even cooked or prepared right. RIDICULOUS. Please avoid going to this location! Terrible management.
Anj N.,Oakland  CA,0,3,,11/18/2017,4.0,I came here after work with my friends(total of six of us) during happy hour and our estimated wait time was 20 minutes but we end up waiting for 50 minutes. It was super packed and busy so it made sense. We received great service from our waiter  Marcus! The food was good and so were the pizookies!
Michelle G.,San Jose  CA,23,18,1,10/8/2017,1.0,Oktoberfest Fail...... 8 of us came for lunch and mainly to have the Oktoberfest beer. No Oktoberfest????? Why BJ's.? I dont get it.  We all left and went to Chili's.
Oliver C.,San Jose  CA,36,102,111,6/17/2017,2.0,Not sure why I keep coming back except for the occasional change of scenery and casual food. Extremely slow service. Beers are relatively fast. Apps come out fast. But over 30 minutes to get a burger. And asked for waters... never received.
Michael N.,San Jose  CA,107,640,96,4/9/2017,4.0,Decided to come here for dinner the other night and meet up with some friends of ours  it was a great decision as it was both halfway in distance for us both.We arrived in enough time to make reservations for four of us  of course they told us to be about 25 to 30 minutes before a table would be ready  so we decided to go grab a drink and stand around and chat for a while. During that time their text service how did visor that our table was ready. It did take about 45 minutes before this was available to sit down and order.This is probably the only main reason that were not given a five star because everything was not perfect. It took a long time from being seated to seeing the waiter come to our table to at least offer us drinks. This could be a problem if we had been waiting there without going to the bar and grabbing a drink earlier. However the waiter made up for this little hick up and proved very good service the rest of the evening. He was very slow at the back end as well and getting us our check and when we were ready to pay picking up the check and taking care of the bill so we could sign and leave.Overall this BJ's restaurant is a great location with plenty of parking. The restrooms were very clean  the facility is clean. For the most part all the servers were working very hard as it was a very busy night  we look forward and returning and give them another opportunity to earn that fifth star.
Tuan P.,Mountain View  CA,10,225,47,11/19/2016,3.0,Typical BJ's story:Arrive at 530 pm.630 pm pizza and salad is out.Steak missing  2 kids meals missing.Kitchen cannot keep up with orders here.Waiter had manager comp the meal.Wait was so long we had two waiters as we covered a shift change.Wait staff not to blame  left a full tip.Calamari- not very crispy  maybe too long under the heat lampDeep dish- small half bbq chicken  half Philly chicken- wifey remarked pizza never seems to come out hot- better eaten at home reheated in the oven to get the crisp backMac n cheese- Kraft had perfected this dish- kids first lovePepperoni pizza- dbp says good but would not get it againBbq chicken salad- consistently good across chainsRib eye steak- ordered medium rare which became a problem in the kitchen- apparently they kept overcooking it- kudos for not serving badly cooked steak- sad face for requiring 1.5 hours to make- wifey says French fries are super thin  crispy  and goodPizookiechocolate chip- it's hot  dbp protip use icecream to cool it downmacadamia nut- ong noi fave and maybe the sole reason we come here and brave the marathon dinnersSnicker doodle- always good strong in the cinnamon
Kelly C.,Clovis  CA,0,36,51,9/24/2017,1.0,OK we are frequent flyers at BJ's what the heck happen to the Santa fe chopped salads and the Tortilla Soup! I use to love both of these items the chop salad is Now not chopped and the tortilla soup use to come hot in a ladle that the waiter would pour over for you on your yummy chicken and veggies and now it just comes out already poured and most the time cold! Boo! I miss this place but why go back for just beer when I can get a beer and meal anywhere. This isn't the only location that has dropped the ball. I travel for work from Bakersfield to the Santa Rosa and further frequently. I miss you BJ's! (SAD FACE)!
Raquel K.,San Jose  CA,185,156,194,12/9/2016,3.0,The food was good. Always consistant. Waiter kept our glass full  both beer and water. Even though he didnt know it was Thursday night football and Happy Hour stays open...It was nice that he changed one of the channels to the football game in the dining area.
Munazzar T.,San Jose  CA,125,61,9,9/9/2017,4.0,Always have fun here with my son...he likes the chicken nuggets and fries and I like my Heff lol...
Josh Z.,San Jose  CA,28,113,15,5/13/2017,3.0,Get this kitchen manager some help. Johnny was great with dealing with the issues we had with our meal but his support staff on the front end struggled. Johnny seemed to genuinely care about fixing the issues. I'll be back because I really think he wants to improve the experience but overall was very underwhelmed with the experience.
Raymond G.,San Francisco  CA,130,60,6,3/26/2017,1.0,This review is based on this location only. 1) Drinks comes late from the bar if you are sitting in the dining area. 2) Appetizers took 35 minutes. 3) Waiter was super slow. Literally. 4) Takes more than 10 minutes to refill drinks. 5) Ordered 6 meals. 2 never came within 1 hour and 15 minutes of ordering. The two guests left. The other two meals were incorrect. After 6 people ordered  only three people ate because it took 90 minutes for the other meal to come back. 90 minutes!Coleman location - get you act together because you guys suck. I love BJs  but this one BJ I do not want ever again......
Aj A.,Sunnyvale  CA,0,3,1,5/17/2017,1.0,Server was great. Actually getting food to eat took way to Long for how slow it was on a Wednesday night. I'm Hangry AF.
Bruce's A.,Cupertino  CA,303,307,1431,3/30/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,This is an updated review on an experience we had. It was by far the worst experience I have ever had here  which is sad :(We made a reservation a week in advanced and as we got in  they didn't honor our reservation for some reason and we had to wait for over an hour. We weren't even properly seated  we had to make our own table OUTSIDE with chairs from other tables. Then we were pathetically served after even more waiting. Our food took so long to get to our table  and once it was given to us  it was poorly made. I understand that they are people  and I understand that accommodating people can be difficult  however  both my friend and I felt as though we weren't properly taken care of at all. She was very disappointed for her birthday. I don't know if we would ever come back to this particular location. Learn a thing or two from the Fremont BJ's.
Katie N.,San Francisco  CA,932,223,1202,3/3/2017,1.0,Stay far far away from this location if you want decent services!! I think I've been to this location 5 times since it opened  due to the convenience of Target and TJs in the same plaza  and the service is still horrible. I came tonight with a friend  sat at the bar hopping for faster services. One after another  the bartenders passed by my friend and I as if we were invisible  while the old fat dude next to us was greeted and served before us  SERIOUSLY?!?!? I almost snapped when my friend finally ordered 2 beers from the bartender and she acted like her job was SO hard!! It felt like pulling teeth just to order one item. If the bartenders wonder why they're not getting good tips  here's a tip for them  do your job and be attentive!! I recommend going somewhere else or just stay far away from this crappy location.
Bill B.,San Jose  CA,5,17,1,6/18/2017,1.0,Service is horrible. Wait wait wait. Employees on the deck enjoying after work yet still waiting for food. Avoid and fire the Manager.
Susan L.,Milpitas  CA,337,151,120,3/9/2017,2.0,"Great location! Lacking in service...Got here before the ""dinner rush."" So the main dining area was not busy. I would say about a fourth occupied. If anything  the bar area was busy due to those who were probably there taking advantage of happy hour. Food was really slow in coming out.The person delivering the food didn\'t even know where to go. I had to wave them down and say that it was our table\'s that he was holding.Food tasted off. Maybe the cooks were having an off day?Our server only checked in once and it was right after we got our food. Yeah  cool. The food tastes great when I haven\'t even picked up a fork yet..."
Chelsea R.,Campbell  CA,18,64,11,2/21/2017,1.0,It was 10:20pm on a Tuesday night  not busy whatsoever  and three waiters passed by us. No acknowledgement from any of them. 10:45pm and we were STILL waiting. My hubby and I got up and left. This location has been consistently TERRIBLE with their service. Slow  inconsiderate  and uninterested in actually serving. If you want to actually eat and not sit around waiting  I'd recommend going to another location.
Jasmine N.,San Jose  CA,256,256,2233,2/27/2016,3.0,This was my first one at this location. I've been to all the other locations  Oakridge and Cupertino and never had a bad experience.I decided to go here with my date since it was the closest one to us since it opened.This location is much smaller than the other locations I've been too but it is nice  and clean  and it's aesthetically pleasing and cures my OCD hahaIt wasn't too busy  went around 11pm on a Wednesday night.Plenty of parking in the plaza shared with Target  Panera Bread  Jamba Juice  and more . Located by Wingstop. We decided on a Medium Sized Chicken Bacon Ranch Deep Dish Pizza  Calamari to start and then ended it with a White Chocolate Macadamia Pazookie of course.Upon reading previous reviews  I was kinda skeptical since it said the service here was slow.It was not busy at all when we went but our server Ryan was attentive and nice. If anything I felt the food took awhile to come out.The calamari was good but damn  the size was so small. I don't remember it ever being that small? Even the picture in the menu was like twice or even triple the size of that. It was expensive for 14-16 dollars :( (See picture for reference)The pizza was okay  not amazing. I've had deep dish here before but this one did not seem deep dish at all  more like a regular pizza but with a stuffed crust you would get from like Pizza Hut or something lol it needed more ranch and was sort of dry. For what it costs  i didn't think it was worth the 20 something bucks just for the pizza The Pazookie was bomb.com as always. It was the winner of the night. Thumbs up for nice staff  host and server. Food is okay here at this location  Pazookie is good.I would come back only if I had to. Prefer the other locations over this one.
Erin M.,San Jose  CA,60,20,85,9/9/2017,2.0,"Very disappointing... We got to BJ\'s as soon as they opened at 11 o\'clock to celebrate my boyfriends dad\'s birthday. We ordered and we didnt get our food until 45 minutes later. The waitress apologized because they were short staffed but the weird thing is that there was hardly anyone in the resturant! Anyway-- we got our food and the serving sizes were very small for the amount you pay. The salads that were served with all our entrees had a very sour tasting dressing on top. After that we asked if we could get a birthday cookie for His birthday. It took them another 20 minutes to get the dessert out... the ice cream was completely melted on it because they said the ""freezer was broken"". When they brought the cookie out they didnt even sing happy birthday or anything.. the waitress just apologized for the dessert and ran off. Very dissapointing expereince for a resturant with so much potential. I will not be coming back."
a c.,San Mateo  CA,1,60,21,8/5/2017,1.0,"Totally remembered why I stopped going to BJ\'s  expensive food with mediocre flavor and HORRIBLE service. This Coleman branch is certainly perpetuating this stereotype  ""Excuse me  may I ask for a glass of water?""  Reply: ""Let me find your server.""  I understand service stations  but water shouldn\'t be a 2-server situation."
Joey C.,San Jose  CA,24,44,17,8/29/2017,2.0,Came into bjs for a lunch and sat outside. The outside area was really sunny and didn't have any umbrellas for shade . After we got away from the sun blazing our eyes we both ordered a ahi salad. The dish was pretty pricey and for both of us only got a sale and one appetizer it was pretty price and over $50. Overall the salad wasn't the best. Who was undercooked and the fish didn't taste he freshest. Of course the sampler avocado appetizers are always a good choice. We had been waiting a really long time to get he check so we actually walked out to the front to pay. Downfalls are really loud airplanes outside and really sunny . Not a great location . I probably wouldn't go back.
Jay A.,San Jose  CA,3,114,10,2/24/2017,3.0,"The food is pretty good and very consistent wherever you go to one of these places. They have done a very good job at being consistent. I have been to half a dozen BJ\'s restaurants in CA and always know what to expect.The salads taste pretty fresh and all the items I have ever ordered from the menu are tasty. They have a bunch of microbrew ""craft"" beer selections if that is your thing  and even have a microbrew root beer which is really excellent! Their dessert menu is also really good  including what they call a ""pizzookie"" which is a giant cookie that comes out hot with ice cream over it. Damn those things are really good.If you read my reviews and have been to this place  you know what my complaint is. The f*ck!ng music. Always always always blaring like really super loud to the point that you can\'t even hear the person sitting across from you.I really wish places like this would stop with the concert experience. I am there to eat  not to get hearing loss. If they got their music volume under control  I would give them 4 stars. If they had no music  I would give them 5 stars."
Desiree B.,San Jose  CA,188,15,10,5/2/2017,2.0,"My family and I came here for a late lunch/early dinner on Sunday evening and the table service was not great. We waited no more than 10 minutes for a table of 5  which wasn\'t a problem at all. Our server was not the best. I  too  am in the food service business  and I understand if you\'re having a bad day or maybe you\'re just new...but I just didn\'t feel like this was the best our server could do. We were served the appetizers we ordered  but we weren\'t given any plates or even utensils. Later on  as we finished our entrees  waiting on dessert  our server did not touch one plate to bring back to the kitchen. Not even a single busser or other employee offered to get the plates out of our way. Even when our server took our order for desserts  she saw our plates and just walked away. We had ordered two chocolate chip pizookies but was only given one. When we asked our server where the other one was  she looked confused as if she didn\'t confirm that we ordered two. My boyfriend said it was okay and that she didn\'t need to bring the second one out. She insisted there was ""another one""  yet we still waited 15 minutes for that one to come out.I wish this experience could\'ve been better. BJ\'s is not really my favorite place to eat  but a better experience would\'ve made it enjoyable."
Natalia R.,Santa Clara  CA,36,104,338,4/28/2017,1.0,Ive been to this location once before and the service wasnt bad. That changed on our last visit. We decided to come in with a party of 9 and order just desserts. It happened to be my sisters bday and they had piezookies on special. Perfect combo? Well not really. It seemed that they were either under staffed of very confused. It took us about 1 hour to get our dessert. When they finally came out half were wrong and others had already melted icecream. The bill came and they had added another extra dessert. Good thing we did not order food otherwise we would've stayed there till closing. We got the 730pm but didn't get to leave until 930 between all the confusion. There were other tables which seemed to have had the same issues.They did remove 2 desserts for the inconvenience and they were very polite but the experience was a bit disappointing in the end as we were all ready to call it a night after being there for close to 2 hours. I might go to different location next time i want bjs. Quite sad
Marco C.,San Jose  CA,3,167,,9/14/2017,1.0,Not a very good restaurant  all their food is very greasy and the pizzas are thick and very greasy. I ordered some calamari and pizza  but tasted not good.
Andrew S.,Santa Clara  CA,0,15,20,12/28/2016,5.0,The Basketball game is loud. But  we got our favorite server Roberto. He has treated us well from day one. This is our goto for dinner when we can't decide. Food is great.
Daniel A.,San Jose  CA,6,1,,9/10/2017,5.0,This is probably the new chili's for me since it has a greater menu  food is delicious  customer service was great  and the time wait for my food was faster than any other place. #1 in my books
Adrian Y.,Saratoga  CA,108,85,6,3/18/2017,3.0,Just a regular BJ's place. Burgers are pretty good  but nothing too special.
Joseph H.,Milpitas  CA,2,7,3,2/2/2017,1.0,Traditional I've really enjoyed the pizzas and pasta dishes from BJs but I just received a delivery that is missing ingredients and made to a very low standard. I'm applaud by this lack of quality and care because I ordered delivery vs eating in.As you can see in the photo  it's painfully obviously how far the Apple has fallen.Do not order delivery from here
Todd G.,Santa Clara  CA,99,48,41,3/10/2017,4.0,First of all  it puzzles me why this place gets only 2.5 stars. Every time I've been in here  and sat in the bar area  the service has been impeccable. Stephanie goes out of her way to help you out and pours a damn good drink. The food is always on point and it's reasonable priced. Maybe I'm not coming into this place at the wrong time. But my experience here has always been a good one.
Nebiate S.,San Jose  CA,0,3,,10/27/2017,3.0,Bjs had a good clientele though Edwardo is the worst server I have ever had . Never coming back to this location
Frank G.,San Jose  CA,8,5,1,5/6/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,After a while decided to come back  the service is still lacking  food came in different waves  had to keep asking where the rest of the food was.More communication from his part would go a long way  probably the kitchen got slammed but I'll never know.Management needs to push more customer service training on the staff.Food was AMAZING  everything we order was great
Yellow Boy A.,Mountain View  CA,10,185,1129,3/12/2017,3.0,Similar to many of the other chain BJ's restaurant however it was pretty crowded. Good drinks and food overall.  Texting our phone is a good addition while we wait.
Rachel R.,San Jose  CA,109,41,6,1/14/2017,5.0,"I wasn\'t exactly having the best evening  but the fam and I were lightweight hungry. Decided to come here because  being the ""deprived child"" I am  I\'ve never been here before LOL. Best decision ever. Roberto gave us amazing customer service and he was super nice! He was very attentive to our table and constantly came to check up on us and refill our beverages. He even suggested the best possible options since I wanted a small pizza - opted for 2 minis (1 to go) since it was Happy Hour. Thank you for letting me know! 5 stars to him for the amazing service! The food: Everything we ordered tasted amazing! Great White mini pizza  Buffalo Chicken ranch mini pizza  Salmon Quinoa Bowl  and The Late Night Burger. (Only issue was that the salmon quinoa bowl was a bit over salted  but it still tasted good)Bring on desserts and sweets! FIRST TIME FOR PIZOOKIES! (haha wasn\'t kidding about being a ""deprived child"") Anyways  we ordered the mini trio: Macadamia nut  Monkey Bread  and Oreo but the chef accidentally made all of them regular. We weren\'t charged for the accidental upgrade which was really nice on their part. It was a great way to end the night - made my evening a lot better! Each pizookie was amazingly delicious  but my most favorite one was Oreo. Will definitely be coming back."
Jamie A.,San Jose  CA,1,9,2,10/27/2017,1.0,Not a place for kids. Took our (almost) 2y. old here and they screwed up his order twice in a row. Sent it back the first time and waited for correct order while wife and I ate our food and baby sat by hungrily getting more bored by the minute. The second order took so long that we couldn't wait any longer (our kid was going crazy by this point)  so we asked for it to go just to try to get out of there. When the waiter brought the to go bag  we were shocked to see the same wrong order in the bag! Waiter was rude and just walked away from us. Talking to the manager yielded only slightly better results (at least he agreed not to charge us). We were so annoyed with the situation  that we didn't stick around to make sure he voided the charges. Not planning to return any time soon. Oh  BTW  the flat bread was over-cooked (edges were like crackers)  and the calamari was way too salty.
Alyssa B.,Alviso  CA,502,469,878,11/28/2015,2.0,I could live without going to a BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse ever again  but my boyfriend likes the place. In terms of chain restaurants with large menus and a stunning dessert  I'll stick with Cheesecake Factory. When we do go here  the wait is always long. Sometimes they even have tables and just lack the servers to seat people. And if there's a game being broadcast on the TVs all over the restaurant  you can be sure that the wait will be even longer. Service is friendly  but can be slow. The menu is extensive  but nothing really sticks out as amazing. Maybe it's just that I'm not much of a beer drinker  but I just can't appreciate this place. Especially not when the beer costs as much as a meal. And the meals are pretty standard  if not slightly underwhelming for the price.One of the redeeming things about BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is the pizza-cookie  the pizookie. I like the pizookie trio  since you get the option of 3 different types of pizookies to try with some exclusions for the special items.While I'm still open to coming here  I can't say it's ever going to be my first choice. I'll continue to keep an eye out for an item on the menu that I'll love to order  but to this day I am still floundering about with my food decisions.This location in particular has some perks. For one  it's in a plaza with A LOT of parking options available. Two  the outdoor patio is very nice. Three  they have plenty of waiting room. If you choose to wait outside  loudspeakers broadcast when a party is being called.
Karen P.,San Jose  CA,0,103,28,3/11/2017,1.0,We were hoping to continue a great evening after Luzia  but this visit on a Friday at 7 night was so disappointing.At check in our wait was 1 hour- leave your number and get a text when to return. No biggie since there are nearby stores to kill time. We got a text 20 mins later (yay!) and rushed back from Target to check in only to wait an additional 20 mins- although we were standing right in front of the hostess  they forgot about us (boo!).And not sure how often this happens but on this night  just after being seated  a woman and her young daughter was going table to table asking for money to feed her family.While the food was not horrible  it was subpar- excessive oil on fried calamari (11.95) made the breading slide off  Brewhouse burger with more bun than meat (8.95)  decent parmesan chicken cutlets with pasty mashed potatoes (16.95) and a lukewarm deep dish ziti-looks picture perfect on top with melted cheese and meat  but is just plain pasta tubes underneath (15.75). Dinner is overpriced for the portions and quality of the food. Service was meh- we had to ask for utensils and refills(most are free). Food took a long time to come out.They do have a pretty good bar/beer selection  so maybe this is a good place to have drinks but definitely will not be returning for the food.
Robert H.,San Jose  CA,563,293,2124,10/25/2015,3.0,"We\'ve been to this particular location a handful of times  and their food has been consistently good. Since it is in a prime location  you have to be prepared for chaos. If you come at an odd time/hour  then you increase your chances of bypassing that long wait to be seated and served.Last night we ordered the following:California Club (Flatbread Pizza Appetizer)6"" Deep Dish Cheese Pizza (Kids\'s Menu)BJ\'s Brewhouse Blonde (Fish & Chips)Baked Beignet Everything listed above came out perfectly. The flatbread pizza was had a nice crisp to the crust  and had just the right amount of cheese. The deep dish cheese pizza was good  but I felt it had a little too much cheese. I\'m a little biased because I\'m more of a thin crust guy. If you are a fish & chips fan  they use Pacific cod fillets  and skinny fries that come out with the perfect amount of crisp  and with very minimal grease! The baked beignet was a little tough and chewy this time  so I wasn\'t a big fan.Side note:They don\'t have any ""free"" house bread. They brought 4 plates of bread  but charged us $1 per plate. The upside was the bread was really good  but you have to tell us that it isn\'t ""house bread"". Maybe they can call it  ""dollar bread""? :PConclusion:Great atmosphere  good service  good food. I\'d definitely come back  but I wouldn\'t wait longer than 20 minutes for a table."
Samantha C.,Scotts Valley  CA,5,7,8,4/28/2017,1.0,Super slow service. Dirty silverware. Wrong orders after an hour of waiting. Forgotten orders. Not very good food. Watery drinks.
Lovejit B.,San Jose  CA,4,6,2,12/16/2016,1.0,"Horrible customer service! Tried to make a reservation for a bday dinner and a lady answers the phone tells me she\'ll get her manager leaves me on hold for 25 minutes and then another lady answers the phone ""hi miss have you been helped yet"" are you kidding me!? Waited cus I really needed a table tonight only to be placed on hold for about 30 minutes and then another lady randomly picking up the phone just to tell me there\'s nothing available and they\'ve been booked for a while."
Michael T.,Santa Clara  CA,0,12,,10/7/2017,1.0,Pro Tip  it's a bad sign when you get to an empty restaurant to seat you at noon and they say it'll be a 5-10 minute wait to seat you. Needless to say  it took over a half hour to get three of our four meals. Two were cold  largely inedible overall. The crispy bacon we requested was the soggiest thing you've ever seen. That said my kid seemed to like the Kraft Mac and Cheese that they served him  and they did refill our water once. Save yourself. Go to the Panera next door or maybe you can find something better in the dollar aisles at the Target.
Jennifer D.,San Jose  CA,7,5,,8/13/2017,3.0,Pizza is decent. Usually go on Monday's for 1/2 off a large pizza. They do have a happy hour. I have tried other menu items and not been too impressed. I think some of the food items are over priced for the quality. Average customer service.
Lisa R.,Yucaipa  CA,82,3,1,3/19/2017,1.0,We were just at this restaurant. We were in a large group of 24. The servers brought out our orders and gave the wrong salad to one of the ladies. The server realized his mistake and took the salad back from her  AFTER she had already started eating it. After circling the table a couple of times to try and see who was missing a meal  he then gave it to me. I did not make a fuss because I was with my daughter's gymnastics team  but this is absolutely inexcusable! I couldn't eat the salad. I like BJ's but I will never go back to this location. Disgusting! The women's bathroom was also a mess!
Patricia E.,San Jose  CA,18,4,,2/24/2017,2.0,I am wanting to find out if anyone else has slipped and fallen on their very slippery floors or the ground out front when its been raining??? Please send me a message.. thank youpevasqz@aol.comThe food was great but the floors/ground super slippery inside and out anyone else?
Heleina M.,San Jose  CA,66,21,21,6/30/2016,3.0,The food was okay. The service was okay. Overall  the whole experience was alright.The only thing I enjoyed was the pizookie and the mozzarella sticks.
Zibell A.,San Jose  CA,94,3,,6/7/2017,5.0,My family and I come here about 2-3 times a week even when it's busy the service is still great! Also the we love the food of course! (:
Tia B.,Sunnyvale  CA,0,9,3,8/7/2017,5.0,We had a party of 40 over the weekend  and everything turned out great. The food was was ready and our tables were all set. I reservation was at 8 but my family is always on Samoan time where they show up an hour or two later. The manager and our waiters extended our time so it helped so much they did that for us. Our waiter was super nice and had everything under control when it came to the alcohol receipt and our buffet receipt. Over all I recommend this place.
Michael L.,San Jose  CA,128,87,1431,9/15/2015,3.0,I've come to eat and drink here several times and each time was NOT a total disaster like some of the other reviews I have read.The food comes out wrong every time we come but they do their best and fix it.Ordered a cheese pizza  it came out with pepperoni. They brought us a new one no issue.Pizza was burned on the crust  they gave a new pizza and let us keep the burned pizza.I then gave the burned crust pizza to the homeless man sitting outside. So that was a win win.All the servers were friendly with great attitudes which keeps us coming back. Small issues here and there but nothing to keep us from returning.I usually order Guiness on tap  the pour and glass could be better..but oh well cant be too picky.They do have flights and I always order those as well. One waitress told me that flight selection was limited to BJ's brews only I said hmmm I think your wrong LOL. So dont let them tell you otherwise you can order anything on TAP for your flights. One standout here was the Ahi tuna salad  it was delicious and I will order it next time I come back.*** 3
C L.,San Jose  CA,0,11,,10/14/2017,1.0,BJs! Burgers as greasy as your face in middle school! What a waste of time and money. Went there looking for a quick burger and got a truck stop version of it. Save yourself the stomach ache and don't eat here. Much better options and pricing a couple steps away.
Neva R.,San Diego  CA,9,19,3,11/14/2016,1.0,We got there at 4:40pm  and didn't get out of there until 6:15p. We ordered dessert and it took too long and I went to the front desk and asked for the check and we left without the dessert. People who's had arrived after us got their drinks and food way faster. Every single thing took 15 minutes or more. As for the food  my daughter order a burger with just lettuce and cheese  well she got lettuce and that's it  and of course it took 15 minutes to get her cheese. The server was nice of enough to get her fries while she waited. I ordered the mini Chicken Philly pizza  it came on a appetizer plate with cheese dripping off of it. It tasted like a pizza from Pizza Hut  which I despise  it definitely didn't taste like Chicken Philly sandwich. It was basically a chicken pizza with mushrooms  bell pepper  and onions. Don't waste your time or money.Ive been to BJ in San Diego and that place sucks too!
Joe D.,San Jose  CA,25,4,,7/22/2017,1.0,Would give this place a zero if I could. Every time we ever came here it's always been a straight disaster. Orders always come missing something or adding nuts to a salad that doesn't even have nuts or cold fries every time. We always say we will give this location 1 more time since it's 5 minutes away from our house but never again will I give this place another dollar of my hard earned money
Bhargavi S.,San Jose  CA,106,2,,8/1/2017,4.0,Jonathan Neese Manager is awesome .We ordered veg pizza   but by mistake they got us chicken pizza . Other staff was not good but Jonathan is very nice and immediately ordered new one for us .
Audrey L.,Santa Clara  CA,78,21,28,5/8/2016,2.0,I'm giving an extra star only because our waiter was kind enough to communicate only..once...and tell us that the bar is a little slow and that he will go and see why they are taking so long with pouring our beers. How hard is it to pour two beers? We had to wait a half hour for these drinks. By the time we got our food  our beers that we were nursing were empty and we were not asked for refills.We order a flatbread and chicken wings with blue cheese dressing on the side. They gave us the standard ranch with no blue cheese. We had no utensils  no napkins  our waiter didn't check on us and when we were lucky enough to get his attention  he only did so after checking on all his other tables.Needless to say we will probably just attend lunch at a different restaurant in that shopping center next time
Verona N.,San Jose  CA,149,140,1438,9/19/2015,3.0,I met a friend for dinner last week at this location. We used the Party of Two deal for $25. We each had a small salad  shared a med deep dish Bbq chicken pizza and shared a chocolate chip pizookie. The food was great especially for the price. It was nice to have a mommy's night out without breaking the bank. Our server seemed less than happy to be there and had the attitude of a wet blanket. But he was polite for the most part.
Julianne J.,Philadelphia  PA,144,6,,7/27/2017,2.0,Service was OK; however  quality of food was pretty bad. I got the half rack of ribs which was extremely dry and didn't have a lot of sauce on it. The brussel sprouts were the best part of the meal. Most of our food also came out cold and incorrect  on top of being late. The chili cheese dip didn't include chili and the wings didn't have the sauces that were supposed to be on them and were essentially chicken nuggets. Management was kind enough to come out and apologize  but due to the quality of food I don't think I'll be back.
Laure S.,Upland  CA,0,55,8,11/6/2016,2.0,"Yikes! I thought all BJ\'s were created equal  but boy was I wrong! I went today for a Sunday quick dinner. The dining room had a line so my friend and I picked the bar. After finding a seat we waited 10 minutes before being acknowledged by our server  Elijah. I can\'t pinpoint what exactly the issue was  but Elijah wasn\'t particularly friendly nor completely rude- so it\'s hard to give the service anything but ""meh"" ratings. The bar was visibly swamped so I understand the ""let\'s get to business attitude"" of service  but I didn\'t feel particularly welcomed as a customer. Since it was loud  our server seemed a little annoyed that my friend and I couldn\'t hear him and gave this awkward stare when we didn\'t answer his questions in a timely manner (due to background noise). The interaction was awkward and I\'ve never felt so uncomfortable eating at a BJs. The burger I ordered was waaaay too over cooked and dry. I wasn\'t asked how I wanted my burger done and I can easily say it was one of the most disgusting burgers I\'ve ever eaten in my lifetime. With the combination of ""meh"" service and bad food  I plan on never coming back to this location. I guess I grew accustomed to the great service and food at the Arden location in Sacramento. Like I said earlier  who knew there could be such a difference in quality between locations? This place needs to take a few pointers from their other successful restaurants."
Lushi Z.,San Jose  CA,68,161,66,12/13/2016,4.0,First time at this location and the staff did a great job at accommodating my party of 20 people. Our server was very attentive with refilling our drinks and clearing our plates. The food did take a while to come out though but that was probably because they wanted to bring all of our orders out at the same time. We ordered two of the appetizer platters to start and one side of our table had finished it for about 20 minutes before the other side got theirs. But the appetizer platter is so good! I love the avocado egg rolls dipped in the yummy sauce! Most of us ordered pasta which we should've just shared because the portions were huge! I barely touched mine considering how filling the appetizers were lol!
Sudesna M.,San Jose  CA,346,118,1337,12/13/2015,5.0,My favorite place!!! Everything about the place is simply 5 stars. Stunning ambience and excellent service. Impressive selection of beers and cocktails. Recommended ones: Strawberry mojito and Pink cadillac. They have 'small bites' if you just want something light to munch with your drinks. Affordable yet yum. Try the Spinach stuffed mushrooms or Sriracha queso dips. Wate3 things you must try here: 1. Signature Deep dish pizza - pick any flavor and it tastes oh-so-heavenly. Personal fav: Great white screaming cheesy chicken with alfredo sauce and roasted garlic - Awesomeness! You can build your own too!2. New Orleans Jambalaya - House speciality with an exotic range of spices + Chicken + Shrimp served on pilaf. You can make it extra spicy and it will taste even better.3 . Pizookie - Do not miss it for the wirld. Its the ultimate dessert - melting ice cream on an oven fresh hot cookie - Try the pizookie trio - sampler of 3 versions if you are a first timer. Personal fav : White chocolate pizookie with macadamia nuts.On top of all this great stuff  these guys are open until midnight which is a killer.Honestly im biased and i simply adore this place! They are consistently good and I just keep coming back!Tip: Sign up for a BJs membership card. Its free but they give great deals and free pizzokies.
Jen H.,San Jose  CA,21,65,51,4/29/2017,1.0,"DO NOT. I repeat... DO NOT order takeout from this place! If you\'re thinking  ""Hey  I\'ll just download the app  getting takeout should be fast/ easy/ convenient""... think again! I ordered two entrees from here at almost 9:30pm and didn\'t leave there with my food until almost 10:30. There is no reason it should take almost an hour for TWO entrees  especially that late at night. So  I came in about 20 minutes after I ordered. They said one of the entrees was ready but the other (pizza) was almost done. I paid right then as I waited (with tip  almost 20% I might add). I kept waiting and waiting... I finally asked how much longer and was told ""Oh  they messed up your food so they have to start over now"". By this point I am irritated. Why wasn\'t this communicated earlier? So I ask what the problem was and she tells me that they used a different type of olive on the pizza than what I ordered. I told her that I don\'t mind  as I\'ll eat any kind of olive and she says that it\'s too late- they disposed of the ""messed up"" pizza and started over. Ummm... again  communication!! If they had told me  I would have happily taken the ""messed up"" pizza! She says it will take another 5-7 minutes so I step outside and come back about 10 minutes later. I saw a couple employees behind the takeout counter and no one even acknowledged me. The girl I had been communicating with was talking to her coworkers  ignoring me. I finally had to interject and ask her if she can check on my food. She disappears in the kitchen for about 15 minutes. She finallyyyy comes out with the pizza and then can\'t find my other entree. I mean  REALLY?! It was a small pizza and sandwich. By this point it was reaching an hour. I have worked in the restaurant industry in the past and I understand that things go wrong but so much of this could have been avoided with simple communication!  Also  not ONE person apologized to me or tried to make it right. All the while  I saw many employees coming out of the kitchen with their personal food to take home or just standing around gossiping about their coworkers. Not one person asked if I was being taken care of or needed anything. At the end of this whole ordeal I asked to speak to a manager. I waited a few minutes and see the manager coming from the parking lot with an employee who was (loudly) going on about wanting to quit. Totally unprofessional! The girl I had talked to about speaking to a manager then tells me ""he\'s busy with another customer  so you\'ll have to wait to speak with him"" (as he\'s walking past me). I was so sick of WAITING at that point and my family was wondering what was taking so long  so I just left. This place was a complete mess tonight! It sucks because I live fairly close to this location  but it\'s just not worth the time and the headache to deal with this place."
Annie H.,San Jose  CA,10,183,93,1/22/2017,4.0,My husband and I enjoyed our visit and the food was very good. I got a pizza and my husband got the sirloin. The pizza was thin crust and tasted great. The sirloin was good and the gin fries that was one of the two sides was excellent. They were light and crispy. The staff was pleasant and extremely friendly. The bathrooms need some cleaning.
Chris H.,Tracy  CA,29,13,,7/9/2017,1.0,Yikes! Cold pizza  metallic tasting clam chowder  cold everything except piping hot kids food. Stay away!!! Over staffed and friendly but the kitchen is going to make someone sick eventually.
Sandra F.,Albuquerque  NM,2,2,,10/2/2016,1.0,Went there with group of nine tonight. We were there for hour and a half  and the food never arrived. Not a single apology. They tried to charge us for the whole order. Had to go through three levels of management to cancel the order  and pay for the two appetizers and four kids' lemonades that we had. Yes  they charged us for that. Took half an hour to place the order. After another 20 minutes  tracked down the waitress and told her that we'll need to leave in 25 minutes for an event can we can't be late. A manager showed up  said the order would be done in 15 minutes. Asked to at least rush food for the kids. 25 minutes later still no food  we needed to leave. Found a waiter  ask to cancel the order and get a check. He brought a manager who said that he can't cancel the order as it was cooking. Disappeared. Another manager showed up  who was not authorized to charge us for the drinks and appetizers only. Finally a third manager  15 minutes later  rings us for the $35 for the drinks and appetizers. And we are finally off. After the event we went to  we are at Panera next door. They were fast.
Robert H.,San Jose  CA,0,18,,5/24/2017,2.0,This is for their Door Dash. Ordered burgers in the past and was happy. Now if you Door Dash you are REQUIRED to get a salad for an extra $4.50 AND REQUIRED to upgrade a topping for $1.95. And there are only four choices of upgrades.   Um... no thank you. I pay the $4.99 delivery fee (plus I always tip the driver 20%) and I expect to order the menu item without required extras I don't want and that cost me more money.    Their greed for an extra $6.45 cost them a customer who orders over $40 most of the time. Do the math BJs!
Chris J.,San Jose  CA,11,26,7,9/9/2017,2.0,After dining here a dozen or so times  I feel I now have enough experience to write an informed review of this establishment. I have consistently experienced very slow service and incorrect orders  but my last dining experience at this location will be my last. I stopped in here Tuesday around 9pm to get a quick (or so I was hoping) bite before heading home and calling it a day. I ordered the Ahi Poke appetizer and the California club thin crust pizza for dine in. I also ordered the BJ's classic chicken sandwich as a to go order. The waitress assured me that the sandwich order would be entered after the other two entrees had been delivered to my table to guarantee freshness. All three orders were delivered to my table 25 minutes later. The tuna was barely cooler than room temperature and was clearly sitting out for some time. The California club pizza wasn't even warm. It was literally at room temperature. The sandwich order was served in a carryout container. I didn't realize it until after I left the restaurant that the sandwich order was completely incorrect. They served me the southern fried burger instead of the chicken sandwich that I had ordered. Overall  the food here is simply ok  nothing to brag about. In fact  the food here  particularly the bread that accompany the sandwiches  tend to be loaded with oil and butter. There are no organic options here  though they have added a few healthier options to their menu in recent months. I have brought this restaurant a good deal of business by hosting friends and family here since I moved to San Jose a couple years ago. Many of those experiences ended in frustration as a result of incorrect orders and terribly slow service. I will not make the mistake of coming here again. It really takes a group effort to perform this poorly from the manager all the way down to the cooks. It is my impression that there is no accountability here on any level and it definitely shows. BJ's have permanently lost my business and I encourage all others to consider their options before committing to BJ's for a meal.
Mr M.,San Jose  CA,0,30,,6/11/2017,2.0,There is something wrong with this BJ's that I have not experienced in other BJ's. A few days ago we thought we would give it a try for we haven't been to this one for months  for ever time in the past there was a problem. Sure enough  another problem. Waiter comes over with his hand held electronic pad for our order. My wife orders something  he marks it in  and 3 seconds later she says oh  I want to change it. The waiter says he cannot change it because he has already entered it into the computer. He refused. I explained to him that we could walk out right now and not owe him a cent. The waiter immediately says ok  I will change the order.Plus  my wife's food came 5-10 minutes before mine. Strangely  all the waiters and servers are very nice  but the place does not seem to be managed well. A friend of mine that usually goes to the BJ's in Oakridge Mall- in lives near it  walked out of this place because he got tired of waiting. He talked to the manager that didn't seem to care. I've have written to the corporate office  they don't seem to care either. We go to the health club not far away and have  in the past  gone here because of the light menus. I guess we will just have to quit again.The other BJ's we've gone to have been great.
Lauren V.,San Ramon  CA,96,134,798,3/13/2016,4.0,First of all  the service here is excellent. In a large family gathering of 27 people  it's usually hard to say that about the restaurants we go to. The waiter and waitress were very attentive and patient to the demands of our table. Also  the food came out very fast (for such a large party!). The reason why I can't rate this location five stars is because of the food portions. My clam chowder in a bread bowl had WAY more bread than soup in it. Also the soup was pretty salty. My cousin ordered a kids spaghetti  which had little to no tomato sauce in it! She had to ask for extra sauce on the side. Despite the disparaging food portions  I would definitely recommend this place for large parties!
Victor C.,San Jose  CA,4,2,,10/26/2016,1.0,Do not recommend BJ's for a large parties. We had a party of 12 people and the service was awful. It took them 15 minutes to come to our table after I brought up to the manager. The soft drinks and beer took another 15 minutes to arrive. It practically took a 1/2 for the waitress to come to our table and take our order. Never offered an apology. It's a good place for small groups but for large groups it's thumbs down.
Chris D.,San Jose  CA,70,5,,4/15/2017,5.0,My Pook's Pilsner n Macadamia Nut Pizooki was yummy  Matthew served us well! Quick fast n chatty! Be back soon!
Dony C.,South San Jose  San Jose  CA,22,1,,9/23/2017,1.0,Horribly slow service when the restaurant was not even busy. The waiter was good and attentive but the kitchen was a joke.
Philip T.,San Lorenzo  CA,73,11,,6/22/2017,2.0,The entrees were good and the server was awesome! However  this place is very understaffed..takes forever. Also the ice cream in the pazookie was crystalized really bad. Couldn't even eat it..chomping on ice crystals. Very disappointing..will not return to this location unfortunately.
Paul S.,Saratoga  CA,51,89,943,4/28/2016,3.0,I like coming here with the team because we have both vegetarians and carnivores at work. Everybody can get something that works. The only downside is  well  it's BJ's and the food is decidedly average. Drinks are solid. Friendly staff. When you have our parameters  it works.
TaylorMarie G.,Santa Clara  CA,0,6,2,1/19/2017,1.0,Regarding this visit today  my fiance and I went to dinner tonight and I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger cooked medium. It wasn't busy and my food came out first... just a patty on a bun. Five mins later  the server came back and took the burger  bringing it back to me with an under cooked slice of bacon and a slice of unmelted cheese with just one pickle piece. I bit in to the burger to find the center cold and all the way pink. The wedges tasted like they came from the safeway deli. It was DISGUSTING and no one was around to help us. I would love to send some pictures of how gross and unappetizing this meal was.
Phillip H.,Santa Clara  CA,11,15,6,6/8/2017,2.0,Fried calamaries were soft ... not crunchy ... still waiting for our foods ... 40 minutes already went by ... was told silverwares are being washed ... got 3 sets for 4 people ... can't rate on the rest of our order yet since they are nowhere insight...my 12 yrs old niece already said ... bye bye to this place ... btw ... we came in at around 1:30 pm on a Thursday...
Nate R.,San Jose  CA,0,7,,9/20/2017,5.0,The off menu nachos are bomb.com!! I usually come during the day so its not very busy but i have heard it gets busy on weekend nights. If busy  i suggest sitting at the bar and not wait to be seated.
Sandy B.,San Jose  CA,2,37,2,5/3/2017,1.0,Most terrible experiences here (yes multiple). I have been here a handful of times always hoping they would become as good as the one I used to go to in Foster City years ago but alas perhaps this is as good as this location will ever get. . Terrible experience with not getting food until almost 2 hours after ordered. And food quality was very very sad. Management last night was pretty ineffective. Poor Bjs.
Roger Y.,Santa Clara  CA,42,11,1,6/27/2017,2.0,"I have been to this location 4 times... all 4 times had to wait 15 min with no one in front of me. when co hostess came in from her making out in the parking lot  she sat me.... even though the expecting host was rolling napkins instead of seating waiting costumers. Food was ""OK"" ... but our waiter was not to be found... refills not happening. POOR SERVICE."
David B.,Sunnyvale  CA,8,19,2,11/28/2016,2.0,Sunday lunch with kids- restaurant just half full  and still we waited almost 50 minutes until the appetizers & food arrived -- c'mon guys... can't you get just the appetizers on time while the children are starving?  After the food has arrived  nobody really cared about us - no refills  no one asked if everything was all right  we were just forgotten. the food was ok.
renay g.,San Jose  CA,0,15,,5/30/2017,3.0,"Great food  lousy service.  It\'s a shame  I really like BJs menu. The food is consistently good  but each time I go here I swear I\'m not going to come back. This time we went back because we got a ""we miss you $10 off"" coupon. I ordered the shrimp quinoa bowl and it was excellent. My husband ordered the Jambalaya and was also pleased. The waitress had way too many tables and there was no way she could serve that many people well. We ordered ice cream for dessert. Pretty simple  right? We waited 20 minutes and started getting impatient. Finally  the manager brought it out and when my husband asked what took so long  he replied that the dishwasher was backed up and they had to wait for spoons. A little communication goes a long way. If they had told us that earlier we could have chosen to wait or cancel. It then took another 20 minutes to get the check (and only after I went inside and asked the waitress for it).If you are a very patient person  and have a long time to spend on dinner  I recommend this place  otherwise go somewhere else."
Saumya A.,San Jose  CA,216,73,20,8/22/2016,1.0,"Generally the experience at BJ\'s was good for me (like a 4 star)... But today it was horrible (mostly the worst server I ever had). We came in the evening around 7ish.The host was good though. She seated us within 5 mins and also noted down my rewards number and kept it on my table for the server to see. The server was horrible and looked tired or sleepy (or maybe drunk). He took that slip and tore it immediately even though I had some $5 in rewards to be redeemable. I asked him why did you do that  he blatantly replied - b\'coz you don\'t have any rewards. I didn\'t want to argue so I just told him to bring wate. He kept an expression as if we asked me for something that he doesn\'t like. Then I ordered Santa Fe Salad (which has ""blackened chicken""). Another employee brings the salad but when I started eating  I realized that it doesn\'t even have chicken. So I called the server and tells him that salad doesn\'t have chicken which it is supposed to have. Even without looking at my plate/and checking himself  He quickly tells me that he is gonna bring chicken in a bowl on the side. :O :OThat was a surprise. He brings ""grilled chicken"" (photo attached) in a bowl on the side (instead of replacing the entire salad dish with a new one). Then after just 1 or 2 mins  he walks past us in our aisle and just randomly asks us ""how are you guys doing? Do you guys need a to-go box?"" ... WTH !!!!We just started eating and you just brought the entree  how can you ask us if we want a box when we didn\'t even start eating. That was done deal for me. Stupid server with stupid attitude and I immediately thought that something is wrong with this server.Then after saying no  after 15 mins or so  we were just about to finish our dishes  this server just took away the plate from my friends side when my friend was just having a last bite of the dish he ordered and wasn\'t even done fully. That was pathetic!!! How can anyone do that. .. .We thought its not a good idea to think about it more and spoil our evening. So we asked for cheque. On the cheque it was written two santa fe salad ... one for 13.95 and another with chicken for $13.95+$3 = $16.95. That was another disaster. How can the server put in two salads when I ordered only one (which by default comes with chicken and costs 13.95). We tells this server and he says that he would have to ask his manager if the second one can be removed from the bill. He comes back and started asking me questions - whether I am sure the salad didn\'t have chicken. WTF!!! You idiot  when I told you about it  you didn\'t even take a look at it and just ran away by saying you will get me a bowl of grilled chicken. And now you are doubting it. I showed him the menu which clearly says that Santa Fe Salad comes with blackened chicken. Then He somehow got the bill corrected and we were surprised to see the entry - ""Customer recognition credit of -16.95"" .. .seriously!!! :-O :-O Dude  first of all its your fault (or maybe chef\'s) that you didn\'t bring the correct Santa Fe Salad and then you show you did a good favor to me by putting up ""customer recognition credit"" instead of removing that entry itself. Infact since you didn\'t bring in the correct order  as some top-level restaurants do  you should have given that salad for free.Anyways  it was a worst experience for me so far in BJ\'s. And I wouldn\'t recommend this BJ at all. I hope the Cupertino one is atleast better than this."
Brandon Charlene D.,San Jose  CA,1,1,2,8/30/2016,3.0,Food: 4/5 | Service: 3/5 We went on a Thursday night  so we were seated right away since it wasn't crowded. Luckily  there was a Thursday promotion on baby back ribs: a salad and mini pizookie added. The babyback ribs already included two sides  in which we ordered the rice pilaf and french fries. Together  at a reduced price  we paid only $20.23 (with tax)! This amount of food was perfect for two. We first got the caesar salad  nothing special. The baby back ribs was delicious; it had flavor both inside and outside. It wasn't overwhelmingly saucy - just the right amount. It soft and tender right to the bone! The fries were pretty good as it was seasoned well and had a nice crunch to it. Moving on to the rice pilaf  we strongly recommend that if you are looking for plain grains  then this is for you. It wasn't anything flavorful  but it was just there to balance out the flavors of the dish. If we were to come here again  we would not order the rice pilaf again however. The caesar salad came first as an appetizer and it was an enjoyable teaser while we waited for the main entree. Mmm  the pizookie was a delightful way to end the dinner as we had enough room in our stomachs to squeeze it in. It was served with vanilla ice cream on top that was melting as we took pictures of it. The heat of the cookie and the cold ice cream were like the best friends of the night as they danced on our tastebuds together. The texture and flavor were just combined to perfection. As for the service  we understand why everyone else had a hard time coping with the employees. Although we did not have a bad experience  our waiter had a very tired look on his face and acted as if he hated his job. Wish he was more enthusiastic  but it's okay...we only tipped $2.67.
Jaime C.,Buena Vista  San Jose  CA,12,22,2,5/5/2017,1.0,Horrible. Wasn't worth the wait for a table. Been here a few times and it just keeps getting worse. The food is now below Chili's. The margarita I had tasted like it was made with the cheapest tequila available and had no lime flavor to speak of. My wife's drink tasted like canned juice with no alcohol. Ordered an appetizer and the main course at the same time. Big mistake. What came out first? The side salad for my dinner. 20 minutes later  the appetizer and literally 4 minutes after that  the entrees. I'm done with this place for good.
Marcus T.,Santa Clara  CA,136,20,1,5/4/2017,4.0,The buffalo wings appetizer is surprisingly good! I'd put them up against places that do wings alone. Good drinks and atmosphere. Service tends to go a bit too slow when they get busy. The automated order pads that the wait staff uses may slow things down.
Abhijit P.,Santa Clara  CA,0,15,,6/20/2017,5.0,One of the best ambience. You love the atmosphere especially during a match. Enjoyed delicious huge pizzas and awesome desserts
Cindy M.,San Jose  CA,191,321,810,7/28/2015,4.0,The downtown location is in a nice shopping center with some great stores. The low-lighting and cool atmosphere make for a relaxing meal. Stopping in on a weekday after the lunch crowd was gone was the right choice. We were greeted by the hostess and seated immediately. While deciding what to order from the large menu  I noticed management showing the staff what needed to be cleaned and how. I appreciate seeing this. It means they care enough to clean the booths in great detail and customers like me will enjoy a meal in a clean and sanitized environment. I've worked at a restaurant before and providing the best experience to patrons is key. Big kudos! The food can be hit or miss at different locations  but it was great this time. Our order consisted of nicely battered calamari and pepperoni explosion flatbread. This was so tasty! The mains were ahi tuna salad (big  delicious salad indeed) and deep dish pizza (what they are known for). The sparkling rasberry lemonade was refreshing. Free refills of course  except refills on the root beer float were minus the ice cream. They make their own root beer. Everyone left satisfied and full. I want to send thanks to our server Jessilyn. She was attentive  friendly  patient  helpful and provided outstanding service. She accommodated every request we had  even my request for a cup of hot water to heat my granddaughter's bottle up who had woke from her slumber during our meal. After the baby was fed  and we were ready to scoot  she boxed up our leftovers nicely and we were on our way. Next time it's going to be a poozookie (I think that's what it's called)!
H B.,Santa Clara  CA,12,10,,3/20/2017,4.0,I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I dint expect much going by the reviews   but the cuisines were fine cooked & tasty. They have a nice variety on the menu. Its a good place to chill out with friends with good food & for watching games. Staff is polite & courteous..!
Fernando R.,Las Vegas  NV,7,3,,12/4/2016,1.0,If you like waiting 50 minutes for food this is the place to come. Not only did they mess up my order once  but twice. Not sure how hard it is to make a medium rare burger...I been to this location 3 times  not by choice  and every time has been the same. This is for sure last time. I'll settle for the McDonald's dollar menu instead of coming to this place
Randy P.,San Jose  CA,105,62,3,3/10/2017,1.0,Yikes  there are so many negative reviews on this location  and I must agree with everyone. I love their food but the services SUCKS so its kills everything. I just came from there and sat at the bar area. My server was named Mathew V and he was hands down the worst server EVER!  Theres no point in going to details because I dont think my review will make a difference. But lets just our food came out cold  I had to raise my hands many times while getting ignored  and his customer service was a 0 out of 10. Please go to the BJs next to Oakridge Mall. Their customer service is a 10/10!
Michael C.,San Jose  CA,42,2,,6/18/2017,1.0,I didn't even get to eat. I'm writing this from Chili's next door. What horrible uncaring staff. Who is running this place?
Timothy C.,Santa Clara  CA,3,10,,9/4/2017,1.0,We got here at 1:15pm place looks pretty empty but still half an hour to be seated  and over 45 min wait for food. One person got his food early  and the rest of us had to wait 15 min more for our food. For any restaurant this should be unacceptable especially with half the tables empty
Carol C.,Alameda  CA,195,877,6260,2/26/2015,3.0,After a group tour of County of Santa Clara District Attorney's Office  the Crime Lab division  we came here for lunch and dessert.Our group of 50 people had already pre-ordered our selections about 1-1/2 months ago. Selections were roast beef sandwich with French fries  grilled chicken sandwich with French fries  or a cobb salad. A dessert of pizookie (warm chocolate chip cookie and a scoop of vanilla ice cream) was included with our meal.My husband and I opted for the cobb salad. Neither he nor I were totally impressed with the salad. It was a huge salad tossed with a creamy garlic dressing; however  more than 2/3 of the salad was loaded with chopped lettuce and romaine. There were a few pieces of chopped applewood bacon and a measley amount of cubed turkey. There was a fair amount of chopped tomatoes  crumbled feta cheese and 1/2 of an avocado. Cost of the salad: $12.95 - definitely not worth the price. (My spring mix garden salad with house dressing at Bubbaloo Cafe in Richmond was much better. It was served with two grilled pork chops and special onion gravy over rice. Cost: $8.95; a much better value.) Cobb salad: 2 stars.My husband bought me an Arnie Palmer. It was okay  but too much ice in the beverage resulted in a diluted  flavorless one after about 5 sips. (2.5 stars)The only redeeming factors were the pizookie (dessert)  the ambiance  and the friendly waitress. (3.5 stars)A three star rating is all I can muster up for BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse. It's a hit or miss in my book.
Emily P.,San Jose  CA,263,348,175,3/12/2016,2.0,For a popular restaurant  the reviews and ratings on this place are horrible! I work downtown and was very excited about this BJs opening up close by. I was coming here for lunch and dinner like once a month and the service and food was great! Keyword: WAS The past handful times I've been here within the last year have been not so good and actually getting worse and worse every time. I came here last Saturday and the place was not busy at all. We had a party of 7 and got sat right away! Half the restaurant was empty which I thought was a good sign for great service coming up. We ordered and it took an hour for our food. By the time we got our food  it was so cold! We didn't get checked up on once the whole time we were eating. I ordered the clam chowder in a bread bowl and my sister ordered a side clam chowder in a regular bowl. My bread bowl was barely dug out and made room for just a little of soup. It was half the amount of my sister's side clam chowder. BJs has a great menu but this location needs to train servers and the cooks better.
James M.,San Jose  CA,0,13,1,9/6/2016,2.0,"I\'ve been to this BJ\'s a few times with varying levels of service and food quality (3 out of 5 best). Thursday night was my last time coming to this BJ\'s location. The hostess said the wait would be 15-20 minutes. Nobody else was waiting! Less than a minute later we were seated by the other hostess who heard what the first had said.Adriana was our server and had a serious attitude problem. She behaved as if we were inconveniencing her. The coke I ordered was flat and low on syrup  Adriana finally stopped by the table after passing us numerous times and ignoring us trying to get her attention to get something else. Food comes and my bison burger has pico de gallo on it after I asked for none when I ordered and my girlfriend\'s burger has two large cheese crisps (fried cheese) not specified on the menu in addition to the cheese that comes with the burger. I return my burger to the kitchen with no apologies from Adrianna. Burger returned via another server. Burger is cold and someone dumped more sauce on top (can\'t taste the meat at all  just foodservice sauce that tastes between BBQ  teriyaki  and pineapple corn syrup). Adrianna ignored us for at least ten minutes while taking orders at the tables on either side of us. No ""I\'ll be right back with your check"" not even a grunt out of her. She ignored the check three times to circle around and chat with other servers (we can see you) and finally returned to the table with only change in large bills after picking up the check. Sorry but your poor service reflects on the staff as a whole  I won\'t be giving a +20% tip for shit service and mediocre food. I had to physically go to her at the terminal to get my receipt  which she dug out the the trash rather than print a new one."
Meree P.,San Mateo  CA,6,126,53,3/12/2017,2.0,No Bueno  horrible service. Our waiter was nice but I'm sure just too busy so he was no where to be see. We had to ask a table next to ours to use their ketchup (these peeps were weird they acted like I asked to use their toothbrush) my child wanted ketchup for his fries and no service staff was around. Very slow on drinks and food took way too long so the food was just okay when you're pissed about the service. This is the second time I've been here and service was the same. Come on Bj's.. step it up! You know when your busiest times are and you need more staff and definitely more attentive staff. I've had a better experience at BJ's Oakridge which is too bad because this is closer.
Lou Ann R.,San Jose  CA,0,9,,9/10/2017,5.0,We go to this BJ's on Coleman more often than the one at Oakridge  which is closer to our house. Is is sometimes a bit less crowded. Had a great  light dinner there tonight. A deep dish pizza and two side salads. It was very tasty and hit the spot. Our server was great!! Great service and food. I didn't have their top shelf Margarita tonight  usually do. It is REALLY yummy. Love this place  lots of selections  for whatever kind of meal you want.
Alyssa M.,San Jose  CA,150,310,388,4/14/2015,3.0,Went here on a Friday afternoon with my coworkers to celebrate some business! We ordered appetizers to share and they ordered drinks. Our waiter was very attentive at making sure our water was replenished and if any of my coworkers wanted refills on their drinks. Whoever delivered out spinach and artichoke dip totally wiped out and spilled all the chips over the table. We were having a good day so it didn't bother us. BJ's is a chain restaurant  it's pretty much the same everywhere.
Rogdrick B.,San Jose  CA,10,1,,5/4/2017,3.0,As a long term fan of BJ'S I always have enjoyed the food here it's always consistent  I always have to take my time to find out what is new and what is seasonal. This apparent time I loved the food as always but it tends to ruin your day when you have a bartender who is acting like you the boyfriend who slept with her best friend. Kinda seems as if she was pissed about something. There was not on lick of customer service shown and to me image is everything so a smile can go a long way.. ohh yeh and also how can I start to eat if you don't give me any silver ware.
Claire K.,San Jose  CA,0,2,,5/24/2017,1.0,So I emailed the restaurant Tuesday morning and still haven't had a response. Not really sure they care about their customers. Anyway Monday night I Ordered the Steak - ribeye at $24.75 with taxes $27.04 and itwas possibly the worst steak I have ever had! I asked for it to be medium. It was completely rare  chewy and disgusting. Worst dinner ever! We had ordered take out so couldn't exactly just sent it back to the kitchen. Ordered at 9.36 pm. I also ordred coleslaw with it instead of potato ... guess what  I got a potato! No coleslaw. I will not be recommending this restaurant  a steak from safeway is less expensive and tastes 100 times better. 0 out of 100 for you guys! Look forward to hearing why your food is so bad and your staff can't follow orders.
Dora G.,San Jose  CA,0,1,2,8/25/2017,1.0,Very bad service starting from hostess they were talking and took a few minutes to notice we where there then they sat us in a dirty table and when I moved she got mad on top of that menus where very dirty too and service not to good
Allan D.,Sunnyvale  CA,3,43,11,4/6/2017,1.0,Had an interesting soup and salad combo with lentils and ancient grains. Much to my chagrin  the soup was Trader Joe's bulk soup. I resent paying for store bought soup in a restaurant setting. When I bought it from Trader Joe's I loved it. It was better from the source. 6.95 for a cup of soup and some lettuce is an insult. BJ's can do better! Pizza is creative and good there. I wish I had bought that.
Rod M.,San Francisco  CA,44,757,202,3/20/2017,3.0,Went here for lunch and it was a standard BJ's set-up very similar to the Newark  CA location but the bar area felt a lot smaller. Good service here as it wasn't too crowded.
Sara T.,San Jose  CA,347,353,2590,12/18/2015,2.0,2 stars for this BJ's restaurant  because I'm annoyed with the hostess and their false waiting time. I came here yesterday (12/17/15) with a group of friends after graduation. There were 7 of us and they said it will take 40 minutes  which is the usual wait time whenever I come here. We were all very hungry  but we decided to wait and talk outside by the entrance. Like 20 mins later we decided to go in and ask how much longer  and she said it's still going to be a while  but if we want to sit outside  it will only take 5 minutes  so we're like sure! But like WTF  why didn't you give us that option first? So yeah that 5 min wait to sit outside turned into 10 minutes  and another 5 minutes  and another 10 mins and by that time I got angry cause everyone that arrived after us got seated before us? WTF. But seriously  can you get your estimate wait time correct? It's annoying when you give us the wrong time. I know I gave the hostess an attitude (and I apologize)  but please give me a better estimate wait time? I would of been fine if you said one hour  but you kept giving us a false wait time :( don't say 5 min and get my hopes up...lolz. k. Bye.Besides that whole wait time issue...the food was good (just hoping they didn't spit in our food  since I was kind of rude)! The food wasn't like amazing  but I think we were all hungry  so we digged into our food! Just a note  if you sit outside beware of bees  birds  and extreme cold or hotness.Not sure if I'll return to this BJ's location again ... I never had such a bad experience / wait time with this location and I been coming here for the past 2ish years since its near SJSU. K  done ranting.P.S Our server  David was very nice though :)
Hans W.,Valley Glen  Los Angeles  CA,352,3,2,4/15/2017,5.0,Mathew did an excellent job serving our table. Will definitely want to come back again!!! This gentleman deserves a gold star!!!
Annie D.,San Jose  CA,0,3,2,4/28/2017,1.0,It took more than an hour for us to receive our food. Bad service. Don't bother coming on the weekends.
Alison W.,San Jose  CA,374,1586,929,6/16/2016,3.0,A great place for Happy Hour. Work organized a big get together for about 25 or so co-workers. We had called about a couple weeks ahead of time and reserved the patio. If you order food off their regular menu  they'll even provide complementary soft drinks. But we decided to go with the HH specials. All their appetizers and drinks are discounted. It's a chill place and service was decent considering the large size of our group. I had their mango beer. For the apps  I think we tried almost everything - ribs  wings  calamari  mozzarella sticks  sliders  egg rolls  chips & dip  potato skins  etc. I think the wings were the most popular as we got multiple orders of them. However  there were some issues. Even though we reserved the patio  that didn't stop the restaurant from seating people in the patio area. It would've been ok if the other patrons were off to the side but they were smack dab in the middle if the patio. And then after about an hour  the restaurant started to get super busy and since we weren't using the whole patio  more people were seated around us. Which was fine  except we were occupying certain tables and the minute we stepped away to mingle  one of the patrons asked to move to that table. The restaurant couldn't say no (the customer's always right) and took away our table. Also it was a super sunny day. It's not a covered patio and there were not enough umbrellas for all the tables. Didn't even seem like there was enough for half the tables. So some people got really hot really quickly. Also I know they can't really help it but they're directly under the flight path for many planes landing/taking off at the nearby SJ airport so it got super loud at various points in the evening. I would sit inside next time I'm here.
Adam S.,San Ramon  CA,1,32,4,4/25/2017,2.0,I'm giving them 2 stars because the food was ok and the price was fine.  My wife and I stopped bye here on 4/24. We enjoy visiting BJ'S for dinner and on Monday they often have great deals. Half off pizza or in our case buy one get on free meal. We asked the waitress about the specials for the evening. She happy to tell us about the half off pizza and when we asked about the buy one dinner get one free she claimed to not know what we were talking about and told us that if BJ'S sent us a coupon to show her when she returns from getting our drinks. Well. We just pulled up the BJ'S website and showed her. We got the jist she know about the special. Not sure why she didn't acknowledge this from the start. As you might have guessed this set the tone for the dinner. Had to ask for refills and not sure where she disappeared too for most of our dinner.
Shauna S.,Campbell  CA,417,240,618,2/3/2015,2.0,Because BJ's is a chain restaurant  you may have expectations going in. I loved visiting other BJ's locations  so I had high expectations. The service was good  the host was very friendly  and our server was nice. However  everything else fell short. We ordered calamari to start  and I would definitely steer clear of this appetizer. It was soft and mushy  and should have been crunchy. I have a feeling it sat under the warmer for too long  instead of being brought directly to our table. It tasted as if it had been sitting out. We ordered a BBQ chicken pizza to share  and it also could have been better. There was little to no sauce on it at all  and the large chucks of tomato was odd with the little bbq sauce that there was on it. We asked for onions on only half  and when it was served  we couldn't even tell which half had the onions (so either there were none on either half  or they were hidden under the cheese). When the pizza was served  my friend asked for a side of ranch. It never came. Our server also never stopped back at our table until we were done eating the pizza (or we would have asked him again for the ranch). For a $40 meal for two  it just fell short.I wouldn't say I'd never come back  but with such good options in the Bay Area  this is not a place I'd waste my money on.
Ana C.,San Jose  CA,0,9,7,5/14/2017,5.0,We just had our Mother's Day lunch at this restaurant today  the food was great and you have to try the Avocado Egg Rolls and the draft beers.The best part of our dining experience was we had a great waitress Michelle  she had a great smile and she brought us things that we hadn't ask for (like my daughter's refilled drink  to-go-box for our leftovers & extra chips for our spinach dip)  she can read my mind. Thank you Michelle! We'll be back for my birthday dinner in July.
Rohit B.,Houston  TX,49,15,,5/26/2017,1.0,Wow! Worse BJ's ever. The waiter was doing rounds like for every 20 mins. The food was super late  the drinks are late. Though the food is really nice the service is horrible. Just wasted a couple of hours for lunch. No plates or cutlery given. Stay away!
Vee L.,San Jose  CA,521,267,127,11/28/2015,2.0,I don't come here often  but when I do it's usually not that bad. The wait was really long  which is expected on a Friday night. I'll need to remind myself to not come here on a weekend or a night that might be busy.Service was really slow. Tables and floors were really dirty. We had to ask for multiple things a few times. They seemed understaffed  or our server had an really big section of the restaurant to himself. Food took a really long time  and he was too busy to acknowledge it or apologize. Pizookie took at least 20 minutes. I don't come here often  so I'm not sure how long a dessert usually takes  but I don't think it should take that long. We were here for almost 2 hours.The food was nothing special. Pizza was a little soggy for a thin crust. Calamari wasn't that crispy  and still soaked in oil. The best thing we got was the crispy thin fries.Maybe I'd come back for happy hour on a weekday  but definitely not wasting another Friday night here.
Shana W.,South San Francisco  CA,66,247,90,6/19/2016,1.0,I use to live in the San Mateo County and was excited to hear of a new restaurant in town. So  I was able visit 2 of the locations in the peninsula. After a few visits at both locations  service was good but just went down hill from there.Now that I live in the South Bay and saw that this location is fairly new  I thought I'd give it a try. When this location opened up  service was good. Within this year  I feel as the service has slowed down. Last night we were in to dine and requested that we sit outside as it looked like the service inside looked really slow. We guessed wrong  we waited a good 15 minutes and there wasn't a single server insight. My husband and I agreed that if we didn't see anyone come in the next 5 minutes  we would leave. Instead of being greeted by a server  we got greeted by a big fat COCKROACH on the table. Yes a cockroach and within seconds my family and I got up immediately and just decided to take our business elsewhere. Not sure if we would be back after seeing this creature in their establishment. I honestly wanted to give your chain another try.
Tommie V.,San Jose  CA,32,9,72,3/11/2017,1.0,"I waited 30 mins for my pizza and the waitress told me there was ""cheese"" on it  so they had to remake it and it will be done in 10 more minutes."
Zel T.,San Jose  CA,0,3,,3/25/2017,5.0,We come in at least once a week and enjoy sitting in the bar area. Service is always outstanding and we are always welcomed with our usual pitcher of blue moon with extra oranges  usually without asking!  It was so nice to have Matt as our waiter again  it's been awhile  but he remembered us. Our home away from home!
Mr G.,San Jose  CA,0,6,1,3/19/2017,1.0,Wow  was that a shitty experience. six waiters hanging out at the hosted desk  open tables and still had to wait. The chili was barely lukewarm  pizza arrived but no stand so they walked around with our pizza looking for a stand while our pizza got cold. Kept asking for utensils and a napkin. The waiter showed up with drink napkins but no utensils. Had to go to the hosted desk to ask for them. The manager came by to offered a discount for the shitty service. We told him the waiter was not properly trained but i think he was just lazy.
Chris D.,San Jose  CA,0,11,,5/2/2017,2.0,Had a school sponsored dinner here and the food was really not very good. The service was good though. To start we had the chips and guacamole which should have been chips and avocado since it was basically slices of avocado. That was easily resolved though with just mixing it up myself. Then I had the the sirloin  mashed potatoes and asparagus. The sirloin was cooked properly but was incredibly dry  tough and did not have much flavor. My mouth started to hurt from trying to chew it about halfway through so I did not finish. The asparagus was dry  flavorless and tough. The mashed potatoes were ok. My daughter had the kids burger with a side of broccoli and carrots. The burger was ok and she enjoyed it. She refused to eat the carrots and broccoli as they had no flavor at all. I confirmed by trying them myself  dry and flavorless.
Joyce T.,San Jose  CA,1,11,,4/30/2017,3.0,Came here for dinner with my friends last week. Bacon cheeseburger with guacamole seemed like an exciting one to try  but the meat was dry  tough to chew through  and just tasted like it was beyond well cooked.. Appetizer dishes on the other hand were quite delicious! As for desserts  their pizookie with ice cream is good  but way too sweet!
Fernando S.,San Jose  CA,9,8,,3/5/2017,5.0,This BJ's is definitely the best one in San Jose. The hostess greets you at the entrance and the servers pay attention to your table. We have a BJ's that is closer to our residence  but my wife and I make the extra drive to dine at this location. I did have a question after we had left the restaurant  regarding an Email Discount that was being offered. I took the Survey and submitted my question. Shortly after  the General Manager named Fredrick responded and provided me with a token of appreciation. Excellent place to dine and it's great that the GM cares enough to respond to his customers.
Vicky N.,San Jose  CA,233,170,147,11/17/2015,2.0,I came here for a weekday work lunch. Although it wasn't very busy  the experience was mediocre at best.My biggest complaint was the food and the portion sizes. The menu is huge (16 pages? Something like that)  which usually gives me anxiety  but BJ's is known for its pizzas and burgers. If you like anything else  it will still most likely be here. Looking at the prices/menu photos and keeping in mind that this is a chain  I was under the impression that we would be getting a lot of food. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken with gravy and potatoes -- which would have been better if it wasn't one spoonful of potatoes and one piece of chicken. Also  gravy drenched the entire chicken  so crunchiness + flavor = nonexistent.Service was also kind of inconsistent. Our server forgot to fill some people's waters  and the food came out randomly so that some of us finished eating when others would just get their meals. It's enough to just say... Eh  probably not coming back again.
Ronald G.,San Jose  CA,267,2,,3/20/2017,1.0,BJ's in general has poor taste in food and client service. In most instances when I go into a BJ's whether it be Northern or Southern California my experience has always been a half assed college drop out effort from people who seemingly don't even want to be there. BJ's might as well be a dive bar without even a pool table.
Bill H.,San Jose  CA,30,54,15,12/16/2016,1.0,Beer used to be awesome  hell I used to work there for 6 years opened two locations and guess what I sold my stock because they went corporate and the food turned into cheesecake and the beer went to shit. Really disappointing I miss Bjs 10 years ago...
Pure L.,Union City  CA,304,3,,7/7/2016,2.0,The food was great and the service was not the best. The server spilled water on my friend's phone and dropped her pizza. I asked for ranch many times and it wasn't until my 4th request that I actually got it. The manager was kind enough to give us more fries because of the dropped pizza  but my friend's phone is not functioning properly now.Overall  the experience was not the best and it could have been the servers were put in a lot of pressure.
Nicole D.,San Jose  CA,229,112,285,11/11/2015,2.0,I guess I'm being nice by giving this place 2 stars.Been to a few other BJs around the Bay Area  but I guess this one had to be the last straw for me.I never really realized how bad this place is. I have a general understanding that BJ's is slow  but tonight was even slower.I ordered a mini pizza for the boyfriend and I to share. LOL! I didn't think it'd be a personal pizza-- the size smaller than a Pizza Hut personal pizza. $11+ for this? I wish I had passed that one lol. Maybe this one's my faultA friend's burger came out cold. The cocktail I got did NOT look like the picture at all. My boyfriend's beer flight was small as well. We've definitely had better. The server was so unresponsive to us and very quiet and not confident at all. We didn't ask for more than a bottle of ketchup (literally)  so I'm not so sure why service is slow.I'm glad the Warriors game was on though lol.2/10 Would probably not come back.
Amilli V.,Santa Clara  CA,2,10,,8/19/2016,1.0,"I didn\'t even make it to the restaurant yet but felt compelled to write a review. I attempted to call in and make a reservation for a large party. I briefly spoke with an employee about my party number for the following day but did not say the specific time. She said ""okay"" and I was put on hold. I was on hold for 6 minutes and hung up. I understand if I need to be put on hold for a bit  but just let me know how long I might be waiting!"
Marlene H.,Los Angeles  CA,82,2,,8/5/2017,1.0,I place an order to go through post mates since my husband is here on a business trip . Both of my entrees the Atlantic Salmon and the Parmesan crusted chicken came dry  no sauce whatsoever. The sauce is what gives it the flavor. My chicken and fish were dry. When I called it took a while to get a hold of the manager. I told her about my issues she said they couldn't do anything since it was through Postmates she said I should contact them. It was already midnight I didn't want to go through the hassle of waiting any longer. I asked her if there was anyway she could help me out since it was the restaurants fault she refused. I am very disappointed. The items were orders correctly therefore should of been made correctly. To top it of no utensils were included.
Gita r.,San Francisco  CA,197,233,248,12/28/2015,4.0,We usually go to this BJ's because the one near DeAnza is ridiculous... Also this one is closer to my parents house. The parking here is sooo much better than any other BJ's in the area.I haven't had bad experiences with horrible wait time estimates  but I do know it gets busy and I've had that issue with other locations.I like that I can get quality gluten free food here. Though it's no deep dish pizza ( which I love and miss here)  the pizza is still good - though expensive because any toppings on a cheese pizza cost $1 more for each). But thank goodness for hh  because these pizza fall under it. My brother and dad shared the buffalo chicken deep dish small pizza which I think is the best too. My mom got a personal deep dish veg pizza and loved it  and it really was the perfect size for her. We usually get avocado rolls but we figured we had enough food tonight.The beers are wonderful  but I have to say I always get a mix of negative and positive experiences with the margaritas. Tonight I got the watermelon basil margarita which was horrible on so many levels  but I did get some Sprite and soda to get it less sweet  but still I would recommend to stay away from it.Lastly we ended off with a gluten free pazookie... Tastes just like the regular one! I just wish they extended more of the other flavors to the gf menu like the salted caramel;).
Cynthia L.,Los Gatos  CA,363,222,55,11/12/2015,1.0,"Would give them 0 stars if I could!!!!!!!!Came here around 9pm on a Thursday and surprised to hear a 5-10 minute wait for 2 people. Sits IN FRONT of the hostess stand for 20 minutes....Goes up to check on my nameHostess says to us ""OH we called you 18 minutes ago""Are you kidding me? If I was sitting 5 feet away from the hostess stand and didn\'t hear a thing  then obviously you aren\'t yelling loud enough. Not coming back here again!"
Buddha L.,San Jose  CA,1,8,,2/26/2017,3.0,"Services very bad. Food was okay except the greasy oily Brussels sprouts dose not look appetize. My table Waiter was super slow and dint even give us any service the other Waiter who is not even has a responsibility for my table was taking care us. So big shout out to that pretty Waiter name ""ALISHA"" And booooo to Waiter name Arturo."
James C.,San Jose  CA,0,5,,3/17/2017,5.0,One of my favorite go to places to take the family. Always consistent and good. When you don't know what you want  they pretty much got it all. If something goes awry  they know how to make it right! Love It!
Geminyna J.,Bay Area  CA,177,236,5270,8/4/2015,1.0,"Wanna eat? Then you\'ve come to the WRONG PLACE. We arrived promptly for our 8:30pm reservation with 7 starving kids and 7 hangry adults. It was getting late and hardly any other patrons were in the restaurant. 30 mins after taking our orders  our server comes back with water and says ""I haven\'t put in your food orders in yet cuz I wanted to get you guys your waters first"". A hush falls over the table. SERIOUSLY?! CUZ GETTING TAP WATER IS TIME SENSITIVE?!??Another 20 mins go by and she brings out the rest of our drinks. Then advises  ""I just put in your kids\' meals. After I drop this off to you  I\'m gonna put in the adult orders."" WTF WHO DOES THAT?!?! 50 minutes after taking our orders  she still hasn\'t put our food in?! We were in such disbelief  everyone\'s eyes had to be pushed back into their sockets. It took our sever ALMOST AN HOUR just to send our orders to the kitchen and serve a table of water. You know your toddlers are starving when they\'re devouring a shared salad to pacify themselves until their kids meals arrive. To top off our server\'s lack of urgency  she had a smart mouth. In hindsight  I\'m not sure if she was sassy or just one beer short of a six pack. But with as many out-of-pocket remarks she made throughout the night  I\'m surprised she\'s still employed. Save yourself the agony. Go to Panera next door. Or Target. Or... anywhere but this particular BJ\'s with zero personality."
Sean J.,Santa Clara  CA,0,5,,3/13/2017,5.0,I'm a repeat customer and always glad when I get Azriel!!! He is always so friendly and makes my dining experience a joy!! Next time you come in ask for him. He is worth the wait. Very attentive and genuine. Hard to find in a server these days. Keep it up Azriel.
Sabrina C.,Sparks  NV,41,4,,3/11/2017,1.0,My family and I stopped here on our way to a matinee Sharks game. It was 11 when we arrived on a Saturday  and not busy at all. We chose patio seating because it was such a nice day outside. Our waiter took longer than expected to come take our drink orders and even longer to bring them and take our food orders. Our food we received was wonderful  but we were only checked back on once and that was after we had finished our food. We asked for a box and our ticket  which took five minutes to receive. We had to wait another 15 minutes to get our credit card back after giving it to them to pay. After accidentally signing the wrong copy they were quick to come after us to sign the correct one even though they drug their feet to do anything else. Overall  wonderful food and drinks but very  very poor and SLOW service  even at a time where we were one of maybe 15 patrons.
Laura T.,Union City  CA,2,31,12,9/4/2016,4.0,Usually frequent the BJ's closer to home but was in the San Jose area so it was BJ's for dinner. It was a Friday night and still rather early for dinner arrived around 5:30 p.m. so we were seated in less than 5 minutes. Our server  Yesenia was the best! 5 Stars for Yesenia G.! Very pleasant and efficient. She checked in on us frequently and our beverages were refilled timely. While still working on our dinner  our server asked if wanted to order desert. Thought for a second  it was rather early to order desert when we haven't nearly completed the dinner portion but then I remembered it can take some time for the desert to be prepared. We usually order a Pizookie but went with their Beignet topped with ice cream  whip cream and surrounded with strawberries. The picture on the menu made it look so good  so we had to give it a try.There was an extended delay with our desert order and our server kept us updated on the status. Just before our Beignet finally arrived to our table  our server informed us that she told her Manager about the delay and that our desert was free and on the house. That was a nice surprise and saved us an additional $7.25. Thankfully  we weren't in a hurry and sometimes  being patient and pleasant does have it's rewards.
Alison A.,San Jose  CA,70,42,6,2/10/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Had the best experience the other night for my boyfriends birthday dinner. We tried this location out just because of the convenience of location but i was scared due to previous bad experiences. We seriously lucked out. Our servers name was Andrew aka the brew genius... He could not have made our dining experience better. Quick knowledgeable service. Great personality. Food was great. I will definitely be returning to BJ's but I'll call and make sure Andrew is working first. Keep him around admin at BJ's.
George G.,San Jose  CA,78,36,5,4/16/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,The service here is a real crap shoot.  Took the family here for a pizookie treat on Friday night. 40 + minute wait  that is my fault for trying on a Friday night.  By the time we sat down we had decided to add some apps to the intended dessert order.  Ordered some chips with a dip  forgot which one  a beer and some iced teas to start.  Server was slow and indifferent  maybe she had to manage too many tables. Took about 15 minutes to get the beer. After another 15 minutes the app was still not delivered. Our food was later delivered still no app. For the meal I had the sliders which were incredibly blah. Tiny slices of triangle shaped meat thinner than a McDs 2 for $2 cheese burger. There was a dab of ketchup under neither the 'meat' and absolutely nothing to make this 'burger' stand out. Server did not offer to bring Mustard or any other condiments. When she did arrive at the table to check on us  it was apparent she was already thinking of her next table.  Overall  forgettable food  slow boring service  long wait times. Couldn't wait to get out of there. Note to mgmt.  if you want to sell more beer  for me at least  get it out faster.  I was paced at 1.5 beers for this service  you could of served me four if you let me set the pace.
Usman G.,Fremont  CA,918,44,8,3/6/2017,5.0,Great food and best service ! Like the pizookie to be the best of all ......drinks are awesome too !
Audrey H.,San Jose  CA,21,55,42,6/6/2016,4.0,This location is pretty good. I took my mom for lunch yesterday and we sat in the bar area. I'm giving 4 stars because the weather was great but the hosts told us the patio was closed. :( However  our server was friendly and attentive. I didn't catch her name but she had long hair and dimples. My mom and I shared the honey sriracha brussel sprouts which were great. They weren't too spicy at all but gave just the right amount of kick to it. Portion size is good too. The Cucumber lemonade cocktail was really refreshing as well. I think this is a good spot to watch a game or have outside lunch... if they decide to serve on the patio! It was only about 2:30 when we got there.
Sheryl g.,San Jose  CA,0,18,1,4/23/2017,1.0,We've come to this location several times and never never had such horrible service ever. But tonight was unexpectedly slow people waiting 45 mins for food  refills. The section we were in people were walking out because it was taking to long to get their food  waitress attention etc...even after call the manger
Steve M.,Los Gatos  CA,0,12,3,11/5/2016,1.0,Great place for slow service  COLD food  and a mediocre time. Wow it's a good thing the economy is well  or you wouldn't surVIVE
Dahyei K.,San Jose  CA,442,24,20,5/4/2016,2.0,Slow service. Cold food. Took an hour to get our food and another hour to get our check. This place sucks.
Andy P.,Carlsbad  San Diego  CA,0,2,,5/4/2016,2.0,"My experience at this BJ\'s with regard to the food and beer was just as good as ever. Great beer and consistently good food. Unfortunately my recent experience with the staff tells another story. The greeter was indifferent. The waitstaff - 2 different servers since they announced a \'break\' midstream during dinner - was just ok. What really gets me is that I left  by mistake  some nice sunglasses behind. I fortunately was nearby the next afternoon and went in to see if they found them. I received a blank and indifferent look. Then  the greeter went to ""check"" with the manager out back. She came back and simply stated that I could leave my name. I could tell that she didn\'t care but I left my name  contact  and a description of the glasses. Well  my wife was nearby today and went in to ask. This time she saw hesitation in the greeters face  an indifferent nod by the manager and then  after they went out back and returned  they presented the glasses sheepishly asking if they were the ones. Well  if they had them and my note from yesterday  why didn\'t they call. Every interaction suggested that they didn\'t want to be helpful or turn them over but for some reason they came clean. I\'m really thankful but certainly don\'t have much confidence in the team there  in general."
Aaron G.,San Leandro  CA,0,1,,7/8/2017,5.0,Wow. My server Marcus was amazing. 10 out of 10. He was very attentive and took care of me as soon as I sat down. This guy was a pro... he was sooooo polite and even funnier. Best BJ's server for sure. I was able to talk to the guy like I've known him for years. He makes me want to come here again. Next time I come for BJ's  I'm asking for Marcus.
My D.,San Jose  CA,15,35,37,8/19/2015,1.0,Davina gave us the worst experience I've ever had at BJs. I usually have a good time here and return weekly with a crowd of coworkers. However  tonight took a turn for the worst and I doubt I would ever return again. Our waitress  I believe her name was Davina  was extremely rude upon serving my party. I've always had the most pleasant service here until now. She got straight to the point and pressured us to order quickly even though we were not ready. Then our food came out more than half an hour later on a Wednesday where it was not very busy at all. The worst part is that our food was burnt. We ended up not eating our food at all and she never asked us if the food was okay. She just ended up taking the full plates of burnt food away and immediately gave us the bill for food we didn't eat which I expressed was clearly not edible. The service tonight was unacceptable and I cannot risk ruining another night by returning here ever again. I hope they hire better waitresses.
Nin J.,San Jose  CA,35,149,227,3/23/2016,2.0,I don't understand why this place takes so long on everything. Always a wait here and it's not cause they are busy. From the moment you walk in you wait to be seated. To ordering your food and the longest is getting it. Today's wait time from our food took 40 mins.
Amanda N.,San Jose  CA,365,196,296,7/30/2014,2.0,Pro: I like the fact that they have curbside service for take out you don't even got to go and just call their number and sit outside your car .Con:I ordered the cob salad...I believe I had better  with more blue cheese  meat. Bj offered too much lettuce in my salad. I felt like I was just eating lettuce for $13.00I don't think I'll come back  they are stingy for the about of blue cheese which I couldn't taste the richness of it  and bacon??? Looks like I was just given the fat parts...Soooo tiny pieces that were crushed/cut up. Really?
Noah M.,Los Gatos  CA,94,13,,3/15/2016,2.0,The food here is great. That's not the problem in fact  it's what keeps us coming back even if we regret it afterwards.The service here is unacceptable. If I were to guess  I'd say that they have too many tables and not enough servers. Which is something the management needs to address. I've been here multiple times  weekdays  weekends  different times of day throughout  and have waited exceptionally long each and every time. Expect to get server attention in 30 minute intervals. Only here does a casual dinner turn into a 3 hour affair. This doesn't seem to be as much as a problem at the Oakridge location. On the positive  the food and drinks are great and parking is very easy to find.
Elizabeth S.,San Jose  CA,0,2,,1/22/2017,5.0,We went to have diner tonight Rodrigo was the server. He was very nice and attentive also the food was very good but for the most part  I really like the way Rodrigo help us and treated us.
Kayleigh C.,San Jose  CA,1,16,3,10/14/2016,5.0,"We come here all the time and we (my husband and I) love it here! Courtney is our favorite server/bartender. She obviously loves her job and provides great customer service! The food is always on point and the drinks are always delicious. I definitely recommend the ""Double berry"" for anyone looking for a sweet cider drink. my husband will recommend a Jeremiah Red for those who prefer beer. Courtney is the reason we continue to come back."
Gaby K.,San Jose  CA,0,11,3,12/29/2016,5.0,From the past experiences that we have had here I totally understand why the rating is so low. Tonight my family and I were looking for place to eat dinner while out shopping and BJ's seamed the best choice in the area despite the past bad experiences that we have had here. TODAY it was totally different!! Our waitress Vicki was AWESOME!! She went above and beyond to make sure that the kids were well attended to as well as my husband and I. I am defiantly coming back because of her and I will be requesting her in the future!! The hostess was also very nice and very accommodating. Really am glad we had dinner there tonight.
Paulo P.,San Jose  CA,0,1,,7/1/2017,1.0,We came by tonight for some Spinach & Artichoke Dip as well as some BBQ Boneless Wings. Service was terrible; it took nearly half an hour just for the appetizer. Food was nothing to write home about either. We're never coming back.
Jess H.,Cupertino  CA,6,22,7,2/20/2016,1.0,"We came here for a family line dinner. The wait was about 45 minutes for a large party  which isn\'t too bad on a Friday night. We were able to snag a couple tables at the bar and drink until we were seated at our table. Let\'s just say the bar had better service than our actual table did. Took 30 minutes for our waiter to even introduce herself to us & I had to wave her down. Didn\'t provide us utensils or water at all and left.Took another 30 minutes to wave down the waitress to even take our order - fine whatever.The waitress and waiter switched shifts  she went on break and I thought ""oh thank god  better service."" Nope. He was no where to be found for a long period of time.Our food finally came  it was cold - of course. Took another 30 minutes for him to give us our bill to pay and I had to walk up to him to ask for it. He responded he was getting it ready. No clearly you\'ve been standing around not doing your job otherwise something as easy as printing our bill would\'ve taken 10-15 minutes max. We spent more time waiting on our waitress/waiter the whole time we were there than eating and drinking. Never coming back to this BJ\'s ever in my life."
Aaron M.,San Jose  CA,0,1,1,12/1/2016,1.0,So we ordered to a pizookie to go for curbside pickup. The lady who answered the curbside phone said she would check on it but hung up. 10 mins later we call back to have them check on it again and they tell us we have to go in and pick it up also there wasn't any parking in the curbside spot. So we get our pizookie and it looks like a piece of dog shit that's been stepped on. It's not even the size of a pizookie or a mini. We get charged for a mini but it's still not even the size of the mini. Not worth the wait or 5 bucks.
Cherie C.,Livermore  CA,1,29,25,12/23/2016,5.0,Service started off horrible with being seated  and then completely ignored for 20minutes. But then my husband went up to the seating desk and asked if there was someone that could take care of us. Courtney came to our rescue! She was the bomb! Quick as lightning  polite  and knows her stuff! Kind of hard with such a big holiday crowd. She brought out our food  drinks quick and it was right. She made our trip worthwhile and is the reason we will be back. We have choices on where to spend our $$ and would feel great coming back as long as we get Courtneys type of service. The food ended up being just ok  but were willing to try again.
Bobo U.,Santa Clara  CA,0,7,3,8/16/2015,1.0,The 3rd time I gave this Bj's a chance but every time we visit they failed! starting with the hostesses...we asked for a table for 2 would be fast as no one waiting and many open tables but no she told us 5 min wait. 5 min passed someone toke us to an empty section but choose to put us @ the end of the row that is the worst end which people passes by behind the seat. The only reason I comeback here is the pizookie but that too got served to us after 20 min for a mini size...not the server's fault He was pleasant & attentive but this restaurant is bring managed so poorly!
John D.,San Jose  CA,118,537,13701,3/9/2014,1.0,"My really good friend just received a big promotion at work so he wanted to celebrate; my family was invited along with another couple to join him and his wife for drinks and dinner there on a Saturday night. I had tremendous reservations coming here because I had seen the Yelp reviews on the bad service  but my buddy wanted to come check it out because it was new -- far be it from me to piss in anyone\'s Cheerios. I\'m not fan of chain restaurants in general but BJ\'s I can usually tolerate because they actually have great beer and decent enough burgers that I can justify going there in my head. Well  unfortunately the night didn\'t turn out so well. Which means I have to break out with another rendition of JD\'s ""The Good  The Bad  & The Ugly""!! *crowd cheers*The Good:-The Beer at BJ\'s is always solid. Everyone enjoyed their beers and my wife was loving her Skinny Rita.-A couple of the ladies split a ""thin-crust"" pizza and seemed to enjoy it; I use the term ""thin-crust"" here very loosely because I\'ve seen thinner crusts at the Grand Canyon. *rim shot*-The Corn Fritters with Bacon Aioli were actually pretty good. I\'d order them again.-The company we had at the table was great! Everyone was having a great time laughing and telling stories. At one point my 3-year-old was entertaining us with his rendition of Chamillionaire\'s ""Ridin\' Dirty"" (It\'s a long story--don\'t ask). Yeah  I know  technically BJ\'s didn\'t provide the good company  but I\'m trying to stay positive here  OK?The Bad:-I ordered the California Burger *medium-rare* with their wedge-cut fries. The burger came out well-done and the sourdough bread was charred to the point that I felt like I was eating charcoal. Also  the fries were served cold  and that\'s just inexcusable for a place that\'s as busy as they are.The Ugly:-My wife ordered the Honey Lime Seared Scallops and it was truly  truly awful. The brown rice it came with was gummy and the scallops themselves were over-cooked and still had sand on them. Yes  sand! I wouldn\'t have believed it if my wife hadn\'t forced me to try them. I took a bite and sure enough there it was: the taste of the ocean you don\'t want. On the positive side  at least I got some fiber out of it. This dish was so bad that it actually prompted her to go speak with the manager and get the dish comped; first time she\'s done this in the 13+years I\'ve known her!-The service really is as atrocious as advertised; I feel bad because our main server (whose name I forget) really seemed to be trying hard but I get the feeling that he\'s just surrounded by incompetence. Here\'s a list of their wrongdoings: 1) We ordered 3 appetizers to share: the Best Beginnings  Corn Fritters and Boneless Buffalo Wings. The first two came out after 20-minutes and the wings didn\'t arrive until everyone was half-way through their dinner. We were supposed to get the wings comped as well (Yay  wifey!) but they ended up comping us the fritters which was a $4 savings on their end.2) Service was slow and spotty. They seemed amply staffed so I\'m not sure what\'s the issue. It would take over 10-minutes for people to get a beer; at one point this one waitress comes over and hands someone a beer and says  ""I don\'t know what this is.Taste it and tell me if it\'s the right one"" Seriously?! Hey  wait-a-minute! Is that Allen Funt over there?3) My wife and my buddy\'s wife both ordered side salads with their meals. Neither received them and yet we were charged for them anyways. We didn\'t realize this until we were already well on our way home and by then you just want to wash your hands of the whole thing.I was trying to be positive about coming here and justified the bad reviews as maybe just growing pains for a new restaurant. However  they\'ve already been open 4-5 months and that should be plenty of time to right the ship. I\'ve been to the BJ\'s at Oakridge Mall a few times and their service has always been hit-and-miss. I suspect there\'s something deeper at the corporate level and they need to reassess their training program because whatever they\'re doing ain\'t working. Unfortunately  I\'m sure BJ\'s Corporate could care less. The place was packed and there was a throng of people outside waiting to get in as we left. As long as there are people willing to put up with second-rate food  good beer and terrible service then they\'re more than happy to continue doing what they do."
Isabella I.,Las Vegas  NV,519,83,29,5/30/2015,4.0,I am always a fan of BJ's. They have delicious gluten free pizza and pizookies! Yum! I also really like their cider  especially the berry. My one criticism is that this place is insanely busy  and if it's busy while you are there the service can really suffer. Most of the time the servers are nice and good at their jobs.
Cammi A.,Santa Clara  CA,24,3,,12/7/2016,5.0,Went out for date night with my boyfriend. We were a little disappointed that the food took almost 45 minutes to come but our server Courtney B was amazing. She checked on us and even came over twice to apologize about the wait on the food. Which wasn't even her fault. She even offered to take an entree off which I declined since the food quality wasn't the user just the time. She was a sweet heart and took off a side salad and a dessert we had ordered without even telling us. We will definitely be back! Thank you for great service Courtney.
F. M.,Fremont  CA,0,27,2,10/29/2016,2.0,No wonder this restaurant has 2.5 stars! The service is slow as molasses!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   The starter calamari and drinks were served within ten minutes. Twenty minutes later  main order is taken. Twenty minutes later  we are still waiting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jasmine G.,San Jose  CA,245,301,55,7/20/2015,3.0,I really love BJ's food. I've had a lot of different things from their menu including their burgers  pizzas  wings  pizza dip  calamari  crusted chicken  sandwiches  and pizookie. I recommend all of those things and wouldn't say I have a favorite  I just order depending on what I feel like eating that day. I also really enjoy their happy hour menu and the hours in which they operate. Sometimes I'll randomly end up here because it's the only place open late on any given night. As for the service  that's where this location is lacking  especially during happy hour. I mean I have had a couple good experiences here but I can recall quite a few times where the servers would either forget about my drink  or for something that I asked for. Rarely do they even check up on you while you're there.
Crystal V.,Reno  NV,92,2,,11/29/2016,5.0,We had a large group come in during the lunch hour. Our waitress  Samantha  was amazing and wonderful. Super attentive  personable  and helpful with food recommendations. She was great and made the lunch awesome.
June Y.,Milpitas  CA,285,261,653,7/12/2014,3.0,Food is really nothing special but service the night we were there was really good. Didn't catch our server's name but she was extremely patient and attentive to our party of 6. Ordered the lemon flavored scallop dish from their dinner menu and thought it was alright. wasn't terrible tasting but also nothing I would reorder.Scallops were tender but lacked flavor. Asparagus looked really sad and were a little tough to chew. Brown rice was very dry. Good thing the scallops came with a bit of sauce so I was able to chew my rice down.For a dish that's almost $20  you would really expect more.Maybe if you downed your dish with a drink or two  it would taste a whole lot better?
Nathan P.,Santa Clara  CA,1,33,,6/1/2017,2.0,Crap service as usual tonight. Didn't get my food. Two different people asked about it  but it wasn't until after the other 12 people in my party were fine that any of the staff actually tried to do anything. The issue was that the server didn't even write down my order. Thanks BJ's. Strike 4 or 5 now  so you're fired.
Renee R.,New York  NY,939,116,478,7/10/2015,2.0,Worse than average for sure when it comes to food. I came here with a big group and I had three different dishes. Here's what I had:The mac and cheese appetizer: 1 starThe menu makes it sound super fancy  but it's not. It didn't taste like there was even cheese on it. It was very dry and not flavorful. Super bland. I'm not one to waste food  but they wasted their time making something like that for the menu. The noodles weren't even done right-- dry and chewy. Like  come on. How do you get mac and cheese noodles wrong? The Best Beginnings appetizer platter: 3 starsThis wasn't bad. The artichoke dip was good and I really like the Santa Fe spring rolls  as well. Good flavors in the spring rolls. Mahi Mahi Tacos: 1 starEgh... Just no. I shouldn't have ordered it. I always take my food home  but it was't worth it here because I knew I wouldn't have eaten it. Guacamole was too watery  like  how do you water down guac? Fish was definitely not even close to fresh and the chipotle mayo was drenched with a too big soft taco wrap. Salsa didn't taste fresh either. They got this taco all wrong. Tacos are about fresh ingredients. Even if you don't have many ingredients  or it's not super fancy or complicated... have fresh ingredients for a taco. Definitely wouldn't ever order that or eat here again. Service: 3 stars. Okay enough. We had to wait mad long  even though there was plenty of seats available  but maybe that's a part of how they manage serving so many people. I don't know. The food was brought out at a decent time for a big group  and everyone we had was friendly enough. Nothing to rave about or complain about. Super average. All in all  I would never come here again  unless it was with a big group and I had to for work  but I definitely wouldn't buy anything even if I was here. First impressions matter.Lovingly  Renee Rises-- The Filipina foodie
Melissa H.,Union City  CA,7,52,4,8/24/2016,5.0,My workmates and I headed over to this location to celebrate our birthdays today and had a wonderful lunch. The best part was the wonderful service we received from Chrisendra. There was something off with our sodas and before we decided to flag her down she was at our table asking if we needed something. She even helped us celebrate by bringing us birthday pizookies. Earlier in the week I had ordered a salad curbside and she took care of me in a flash that day too. Food is good here but service is spectacular!!
Melissa D.,Fremont  CA,1,86,86,5/17/2015,3.0,1)Unrealistic wait time. We called in and put ourselves on the waitlist and were told we would have a table by 8:40. At 840 they tell us to wait another 25 min. So we sit outside in the cold by a heat lamp. Ok not bad. Lpud airplanes overhead.2)Slow service. Our waitress didn't come out to us for our order until 15 minutes of us waiting. No one even checked in on us for waters until then. There were only 3 parties sitting in the patio.3)Not fully cooked Pizookie. We get our pizookie and the cookie dough is like half cooked- super mushy. We basically had Pizookie soup. Delicious nonetheless bc of the chocolate  but we wanted a Pizookie  not mashed cookie dough and ice cream.Not coming back here if I want a Pizookie bc it was way under cooked and service was super slow  even tho barely anyone was sitting outside.
Michelle A.,San Jose  CA,467,161,41,1/19/2016,1.0,Okay  I have been here not once  not twice  more than three  1 more plus 4.... YES 5 TIMES!!! and every single time within the last 2 years have been HORRIBLE! Let me clarify... It's not the food  its the service! They actually suck and have no clue on customer service. It appears this place is run with twenty something and are more worried about being friends than managing a restaurant. Yes  even the management falls short. What is BJ's known for (the clean version) their PAZOOKIES! one time I went there and the waiter gave us the check and never asked if we wanted dessert. HELLO? Does it look like I WOULD PASS UP DESSERT? NOPE!  Another time I repeatedly reminded the server of my missing beverage and at the end of the meal you FINALLY decide I might want me drink? Last night we went there  other than the staff playing with each other by locking each other out the side door and then running around to get in. Forget that I said I wanted to still look at the menu and I let you know and then you still take away the menu. and dismiss the fact that I ordered soup in a brad bowel and there was a very little amount of soup and all bread. Ohh and you never checked on us to see how everything was going. No worries. When you FINALLY come back I let you know I want to order the dessert and I want to pay for everything before the cookies get here because we needed to leave as soon as the cookies come. YOU NEVER CAME BACK! I then was running behind on getting where I had to go and then still waiting on YOU! I got up and asked the receptionist to get the manager and instead he gets YOU! I asked for the manager. I then tracked the manager and had explained my frustration. COMMEN SENCE! I said I wanted the tab paid so I can just go after and not have to wait! The manager then had to hear how annoying it was about the lack of attention  lack of soup and lack of following a simple request
Miami S.,San Francisco  CA,143,252,28,1/21/2016,3.0,Not that great. Very busy...line out the door....noisy...love the menu only because it lists calories and you will gag when you see the sky high calories on classic dishes.Tried it twice. C'est fini!
Michael V.,San Jose  CA,59,80,,1/8/2016,1.0,Ordered a deep dish pizza take out with extra sauce and I begged the cashier like twice to make sure she put extra sauce on the order and she said yes. I take the pizza home and there's seriously like half the amount of normal sauce. I'm extremely frustrated and have 80 percent of a wasted pizza sitting here and I'm typing this review instead of eating it. I am that upset. I will never order anything from here again. You had one chance.
Lucy P.,San Jose  CA,0,28,7,11/12/2016,1.0,Terrible service because it's snail-pace slow and there aren't enough waiters. Our appetizer didn't come out until our entrees did (what a waste!) and then when I got my burger it was missing aioli and tomatoes. It took an extra 15mins until I could get ahold of a waitress to tell her about my burger and by that time it was already cold. The actual burger meat was crumbly and tasteless. Overall  NOPE. it's just not worth it.
Gil C.,San Jose  CA,0,16,1,5/14/2017,2.0,Was truly dissapointed in this trip to bjs. Mt wife and i ordered a Mediterranean pizza in hopes of trying something different. We got different all right. First off the pizza wasn't even hot. It seemed like a digiorno pizza with toppings added without being put in the oven. It also had picjled pepperocini on it. That was a horrible taste on a pizza. And the dough was more like bread and nit like a thick crust pizza.
YH L.,Redwood City  CA,75,72,177,4/22/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,After our last visit  and bad reviewed; The manager of the store of BJ's had contacted me. My friend and I decided to give another try. Both of us ordered steaks  medium rawer; then again the kitchen did not deliver to standard. We had talked with Ronddy  who was the manager last night. He had paid attention to our concern  and we had decided to order a different item from the menu; each of us had made a choice Salmon pre in different way; the fish were cook perfect with plenty of vegetable that complement it. Our service was attentive and cordial too. I will not recommend the steak however you should give a try to the other dishes.
Narasimha K.,San Jose  CA,0,3,,5/12/2017,1.0,I am a regular at BJs Brewhouse and today was the worst experience that I had. We checked in at 955pm seated at 10pm and no one to wait on us till 1030pm. Ordered the food and no food till 1050 pm. The food was brought cold. Asked to talk to the manager and he talked about problems with how the night was busy and being short staffed. While I understand that this is is an internal operations problem  I feel let down as a customer. I have decided not to visit this location ever again. The attitude of the staff is a huge turn off.
Ale X.,Redwood City  CA,1,12,9,8/5/2016,1.0,Only bc I can't give no stars. Had a party of 15 got here on time  and nothing was ready. Was seated after about 20 mins  then it took another 20 mins and THREE people asking for a server. Server was by herself and super rude throughout the entire time. This is not good service at all and it is not our fault you guys didn't have anything together. Shame.
Alex L.,San Jose  CA,1465,447,9315,12/14/2013,2.0,"Passing this shopping center on my way to work  I\'ve seen BJ\'s being built day-by-day. We finally decided to give this place a try tonight.We called in at 6:30 and was told there was a 45-min wait so we asked the hostess to put our name down. When we arrived at 7:20  we were told there was still another 15-min wait. We finally got our seat at 7:45 (1hr15min wait total). We each ordered an IPA to sample this brewhouse for its variety of selection. After 20-25 min  we still haven\'t received our drinks. Just when we were about to flag down the waitress our drinks showed up. About 5 min later  the food was brought to us.As soon as they dropped off my order of Moroccan Spiced Salmon  my jaw dropped. You\'re kidding me right? I saw 2 nuggets of fish and what was supposed to be roasted vegetable couscous looked more like someone dropped my plate on the floor and put the remains back onto my plate. Are you serious?I immediately raised my dissatisfaction to the waitress who called a manager over. She comes over and says ""Hi  how are you?"" to which I blurted out ""HUNGRY!"".I told her that this smidgeon of food on my plate resembles nothing like the picture in the menu. She came and explained to me that ""the salmon was just sliced differently from the menu but the contents is the same"". Sure maybe on the kids menu  but the last time I checked  this was on the adult side. She then promised me that if I was not happy  she\'d bring me out additional pieces.By the time our bill came  no food showed up. The waitress didn\'t even bother to check on my promised portion so I had to state the obvious. She returned from the kitchen and brought out an actual portion that was even bigger than in my original entree. I was happy and it tasted great  but I still couldn\'t get over the fact that everything had to be pulled rather than pushed. A service organization such as a restaurant should focus on customer satisfaction and service. I feel this new restaurant has a lot of tweaking to do. The staff isn\'t quite there yet and can stand to improve on presentation (see pic)  service  and follow-thru."
Justin P.,Santa Clara  CA,38,10,2,12/22/2015,1.0,Takeout didn't workout so well... So after sitting at the bar for forty minutes to go my takeout order I failed to check the contents. One of my entrees was missing which I found out when I got home. So I drove back to BJs in holiday traffic to get a replacement. The sad sickly looks ng chicken breast they gave me looks like something out of a bad TV dinner. I love BJs food don't get me wrong  and the staff was super nice... But this is an embarrassment to food. The wife is not going to allow me to do takeout again which is a damn shame  I really like the beer there.
Renee A.,San Jose  CA,98,18,7,4/28/2017,2.0,This is at least the 3rd time that we have experienced poor service here. My daughter and friends waited 45 mins for their food. They are still waiting for their dessert. One of the times our dessert was never brought. It's like they aren't equipped to deal with Weekend crowds?! And it's never acknowledged by anyone. Really sad  it was the place her friend wanted to go for her bday.
Mac C.,San Jose  CA,6,67,62,12/29/2015,2.0,Wow. The management at this place sucks. The food is just ok. So I ordered a hamburger. Medium well. The waiter comes by 20 mins after we place our order and explains the kitchen is backed up and if he could bring a salad out for us. Wife said sure and he brought her a Caesar salad. Another 5 mins roll by and my wife gets her meal and I get mine. I look at my burger. Part of it is burnt. I cut it in half and it is well done and completely dry. Also my fries are cold. He takes it. Offers a salad on the house I state no thank you. 25 mins go by. No sandwich. Another five go by and then I receive it. And it is now perfect. The waiter offers to bring me a salad for the inconvenience ($6.95) I said no think you and ate my meal. After I finished I though hell if they were offering a free salad and I declined it  I might as well see if they take the appetizer off (5.95) I ask the waiter. He informs the manager. He comes back and the states the manager said no. I informed him it's the same thing as offering the salad. If anything I'm saving them about a dollar. I tell him to go back and ask her again. She comes out and starts interrogating me. She asked was your food ok? I said yes. The second time but that isn't the issue here. She just stared at me all smiling and not a genuine one at all. It was a conditioned response. Instead of just taking off the appetizer she chose to come interrogate me first ask me questions and then leave without telling me what the point of her questioning was and without telling me what she was going to do! This was highly unprofessional!She ended up taking the burger off  so the bill was about $24. I left a $10 tip. As I wasn't trying to get something for free. Just trying to ask for what was already offered  but they ended up taking up more time for nothing. Anyway I think the guy sincerely did a good job and he shouldn't be punished for what the kitchen did. The chef should have made sure my burger was correct the first time rather than have me sitting there for such a long time and then wasting even more of it at the end with all the back and forth...The manager here...man...she really needs to learn how to treat customers...
Alexzandria W.,New Orleans  LA,61,5,,4/22/2017,1.0,Terrible. Refuses to put on the Warriors playoff game because we did not request the TV. Management was rude.
Elias R.,Santa Clara  CA,514,115,30,11/28/2014,2.0,"I\'ve been to other BJ\'s before. Some for food  some for dessert  some for drinks... you get the picture.Their food is definitely sub-par. Not good restaurant or brew house food. The buzz doesn\'t make it any better.. Some people love it  to each his own..The Pizzookie used to be fantastic  but its been at least 3 years since i\'ve had a good one. Good indicator that they have gone bad and may stay that way. I mean  the flavor and size is good  but the used to be crispy on the out sides and edges and chewy delicious on the inside. Not they just taste raw.And the beers  they\'re a brewhouse  and such a common one  you\'d think the beer would be on point right? Wrong.. I\'m not sure if they still brew o site anymore  I mean they used to sell growlers and don\'t know  wonder what that\'s all about  right? But the beer just doesn\'t taste fresh like it should. I mean  I love breweries because the beer is fresh. I even brew my own for the fresh taste. But the beer here is just overpowering  oddly flavored  and they make sooo many different ones. I\'d rather them ""make"" 5 outstanding beers than 15 eh :/ ones  you feel me? It\'s drinkable  the mixes are the way to go though. I got a snake bite  not bad  but not good. I can\'t drink it all night you know?And they\'re kind of expensive for what they are. I mean  meals average close to 15 bucks  beers are like 6 for a pint  not a big a$$ mug like a brewery should have.. Anyways  I won\'t talk them down anymore. It\'s just a big bar  not a brewery.Good Luck Yelpers!(read my other reviews to see a good brewery if you want fresh beer every time)"
Brittany C.,Folsom  CA,1274,249,2350,11/24/2014,3.0,Like any other Bj's  always busy  slow service during Happy hour  and food is mediocre. This location opened not too long ago and during lunch  I must admit their menu is great! But during dinner time  you get what you pay for. The food is pretty bland  their beer is great  but only if you could just have your cake and eat it too!My waiter seemed like he didn't want to be there  or if he really just hated his job. Ordered a beer and he completely forgot about it  asked for it once more and it took at least 15 mins to get. As you can see I have mixed feeling about this place....
Amber M.,Milpitas  CA,50,5,1,10/19/2016,1.0,The service is terrible no refills 45 minute wait people who came way later then me are eating and I'm still not. I mentioned it to the waiter he said our food is ready but waiting to come out . Great that means it's cold. Never again will I come here
Aletheia A.,Lynnwood  WA,1,11,1,5/9/2016,3.0,The food here is very good  as are the beverages. The service  however  leaves much to be desired. It was a beautiful day and we were on our last day of vacation before returning home so we asked to sit outside. Our request was graciously granted. So we sat. . . and sat. . . and sat. . . and waited. . . and waited. . . until finally we had to re-enter the restaurant and ask if we could please be served. The server finally came and took our order  which was promptly served to us and was delicious. She never came out again. We would've liked to have some ranch for the delicious wedge cut fries... but she didn't come out until we were completely finished with our meal. At that point she tried to sell us more beer  or a dessert  but we had had it. Won't be back.
Drea C.,San Jose  CA,22,24,2,1/9/2016,5.0,You don't go to BJ's expecting amazing gourmet food. You expect good food and a BJ's atmosphere with great service. I'm giving this place five stars because the manager at this place is awesome. We had six kids with us and he was super nice to them and very helpful in making sure we got everything we ordered and were satisfied. He even came to specially congratulate my son for receiving an award at school which entitled him to a free meal at BJ's and gave him a special pin. Nice guy!!It was a busy Friday night so it's obviously loud and food took a while but nothing crazy. The price for kids meals is an amazing deal everything is under $6 and huge portions. And they can get healthy stuff! Seriously the kids meals are more than enough for an adult. I had the Brussels sprouts and they were yummy and crispy! I also had some of my sons grilled chicken with broccoli and rice and it was great for kids food. The kids had fun playing hide and seek on the patio /courtyard between BJ's and Panera while waiting for their pizookies. And the baby enjoyed watching the planes fly overhead :)
Chris C.,San Jose  CA,146,6,1,3/8/2016,1.0,"First of all  tried ordering curbside so we didn\'t have deal with waiting for a table and their slow service  but upon arriving  there were no curbside parking spots available. All the ""reserved"" parking spots were occupied by unattended vehicles. Secondly  our scheduled pickup time was at 6:15 and our order was delivered 15 minutes late. Mind you we ordered our food 30 minutes in advance.Thirdly  the worker then calls while I\'m still waiting for my food and requests for me to park in the handicapped parking spot because he couldn\'t locate my vehicle. Very inconvenient for an attempted method of convenience to the ""pickup"" customer. The only good thing that occurred was when I asked if I could get a discount for their very inconvenient service and was rewarded with $10 off the total of my bill. Get your act together BJ\'s staff."
Mariah T.,San Jose  CA,0,2,,5/5/2017,4.0,Love BJ's pizza but unfortunately had two pizzas that didn't come out great  but the manager Erin was great and made sure we were taken care of. Customer service is everything. Even though the pizzas didn't come out like we hoped for  Erin made up for it and we'll be back. Kudos to her!
Samantha S.,San Jose  CA,94,2,1,10/26/2016,1.0,I placed an order tonight from Bj's to get dinner . Upon receiving my delivery which was fine   I got my food and found a rubber band in my salad . Needless to say it was disgusting and ruined my dinner . Also the pizza I ordered looked like someone put a foot in it . experience is very disappointing. Will not be ordering from here ever again .
M K.,Campbell  CA,0,111,13,9/10/2016,3.0,Their weekday lunch specials are nicely priced. Service is slow  so if you're in a hurry  let them know. Don't come here for happy hour. There are no special happy hour prices  really. Just $1 off drinks  and $2 off food. Went here for the first time for happy hour  and won't be back. Chili's next door has better Happy Hour prices.
Michelle V.,Seattle  WA,2894,924,872,12/18/2013,4.0,I used to hit up BJ's a lot back in my high school days and early drinking years. Funny how BJ's is now back in my life now that they've opened up a couple here in the South Bay Area. This BJ's is pretty much brand new so I think they really wanna do their best right now to impress their customers.We came in for a quick bite to eat one weekend afternoon and surprisingly was able to get seated right away without a wait (you can't get that at any Cheesecake Factory or Yardhouse in this area).I really liked our server. He was extremely attentive and on point. To be honest  he looked like he could have been working as an engineer somewhere nearby at a software company or something. Kid looked smart! :PI ordered myself just appetizers with a nice glass of...water! Didn't wanna start drinking in the middle of the day if I was already going out later that night. I really liked the Thai shrimp wraps I ordered. But I especially loved the corn fritters with bacon aioli! OMG! Anything with corn...I'd die for! Delicious!I had no room for a nice individual-sized pizookie for myself for dessert. But maybe next time I'll just order that as my meal since they are HUGE! ;)
Wen C.,San Jose  CA,597,285,124,5/13/2016,2.0,I was really disappointed in how the quality of food has gone down the s$@thole here. The calamari was drenched in oil and the batter was falling apart even before we picked it up. Our fried chicken plate and BBQ brisket burger was beyond greasy. Portions are not as big as they used to be. The waitress was nice but it took way to long to get a couple of Jamisons on the rocks. I guess the only thing they have going for them is that they open till midnight and have a nice dining area. I won't be coming back any time soon.
Lynh N.,Mountain View  CA,34,195,200,3/6/2015,4.0,So for this one  I got Deep Lasgana for my pasta entree. It's good but I'm not really a fan of that tomato sauce. Lessen the dark flavor. The cheese in the ravoli though! So scrumptious! Then I had a salted caramel on top of vanilla ice cream for my pizookie. It's pretty good. You can feel the lovely flavor of the caramel. Yum to the tum! Love the environment with its yellow orange lights in a retangular shaped thing. So pretty. It was a lovely day to treat mi luv out for his belated birthday!
Ann L.,Fremont  CA,392,3031,24288,10/10/2013,2.0,Tried out the chain BJ's at this new Coleman Ave location near Target & Panera Bread.Got there about 4pm & tons of people in the bar for Happy Hr deals. I should have checked it out  but instead got seated in the main dining room.I asked about the $20 special which is 2 salads or soup  1 medium pizza to share  & 1 pizookie to share. I picked for B. a wedge salad w/ blue cheese dressing on the side  I got Cesar Salad which was ok  nothing special  Pizza I picked was Spinach Artichoke deep dish - it was pretty bad. Very doughy  no spinach really  just Yuck - skip it. Chocolate chip chunk Pizookie is pretty good - I liked it.Charged the meal. Separate bathrooms near the bar in front on the Right. Women's had 4 stalls & trough sinks.
Christine T.,Danville  CA,4462,647,896,9/23/2014,1.0,Oh boy--this was a bad one. Keep in mind  I wasn't expecting much from previous visits to this chain  but actually being able to eat would've been nice!! The picture of my french dip sandwich speaks volumes...I mean they didn't even try.....as you can see  the roll was burnt black and they knowingly still served it to me???? BJ's  BJ''s  BJ's  I'm speechless.
Gina H.,San Jose  CA,102,142,305,2/23/2015,2.0,"All my past experiences at BJ\'s have been A-ok and I did not feel like I left unsatisfied about the service or food. I came to this location because I think it\'s not as busy as the Oakridge Mall or Cupertino location. We got seated earlier than our estimated wait time so that was appreciated. Unfortunately I felt the service and food was not up to par. I ordered a deep dish pizza and mozzarella sticks as an appetizer. I specifically remember telling our server that I wanted to ""start"" with the mozzarella sticks cause my boyfriend and I were already hungry. Instead  we get our mozzarella sticks the same time as our pizza. I\'m already annoyed cause now it\'s gonna be hard to finish all the mozzarella sticks cause we have this pizza in front of us too.I was even more annoyed because the mozzarella sticks were not warm nor crispy as I remember them to be. I always get the mozzarella sticks at BJ\'s cause they\'re that good to me and I was a bit disappointed that they did not taste the same. It seemed like the appetizer was probably sitting under the food lamp/light/heater thingy while the pizza was cooking so they could bring out the food at the same time  which is something I clearly did not want. On top of this  our server was rushing us to leave. He refilled our water only because I asked if I could get more water. Then he asked if we wanted dessert when we weren\'t even done with our pizza! Dropped off the check when we just started eating our Pizookie. He came by a few minutes later and asked if the bill was ready and it was not. I was very annoyed that our server tried to rush us multiple times throughout our meal. Hope I never have to go through that again."
Jay U.,Fullerton  CA,14,2,,12/1/2016,1.0,Ordered just one Pizza and a pizookie.. waited more than 90 minutes!! Managers and workers not responding well.. Please don't waste your time for an average type of food !!
Jake Jayzon L.,Hollister  CA,25,2,1,2/27/2016,5.0,Food was cooked perfectly and delivered in a timely manner. Tasted great. Beer was refreshing. Server attentive and polite. Overall a solid lunch experience.
Emily A.,San Jose  CA,4,31,6,12/21/2015,1.0,Walking in should have been an indicator of service. My mother and I came here for lunch (12-21). My mother is handicap  she uses a cane since she can't use her left side. The guy at the hostess area asked if we would like to sit at the bar (which has steps) seriously?!? Said no  they put us closer (wow! A concept!!) annnnd it just kept going down from there 40 mins waiting for lunch. Nothing difficult a roast beef sandwich for me and potstickers for my mom. We asked for the Santa Fe dipping sauce  5 mins later the waitress drops it off but places it behind the ketchup and out of the reach of my mom who can't use her left side. Not too mention a bunch of other tables around us were waiting for their food just as long. For being so new  this one is by far the worse in the area.
Linda P.,Kansas City  MO,133,280,1145,12/6/2014,3.0,I've been to the Cupertino and Oakridge locations many times in the past. Although a little reluctant to try this Coleman location tonight I gave it a shot for the main reason that this location is more convenient of a meeting spot for my girl friend and myself.Parking was decently easy as this BJs is on the outskirts of the plaza and the businesses nearby it was already closed around 7:40pm when I was looking for a spot. The wait for 2 people was 20-25minutes pretty similar to the other BJ locations.Other reviews made me wary of the food and either my taste buds have changed or my standards have or this location isn't as great as the others. I had the enlightened chicken pesto sandwich which was a new item. I have to say it was just ok. The salad part tasted like it wasn't cleaned all the way and there was absolutely no dressing for it  I had to use the sauce from the mini bruschetta to have some sort of flavor to make the dirt like greens go down easier. The sandwich itself I would say is good IF they had put more cheese or sauce. The chicken portion I wish was a little more to cover the whole slice of bread but I can understand for cost reasons why it might not be an option.  But why not add more sauce or even greens the amount on the sandwich was sad. The menu says there is basil pesto and garlic aioli and I just saw a smear of pesto and another yellow color on the sourdough which I presume was aioli. The sandwich needed a kick of more sauce for flavor as it was bland. I ended up taking half the sandwich home and asked for some garlic aioli to go home but sadly when I got home I realized the waitress gave me Ranch. How can ranch be the same as garlic aioli?? Disappointment My friend had ordered the mini bruschetta to share and the honey lime scallops I was happy to see that the scallop dish looked like they offered a good portion of scallops and I believe she was ok with it she ate half. As far as the bruschetta goes it was very hard small chunks of focaccia bread with a mild sprinkle of cheese and tomatoes  it definitely could've had more to it  especially when the bread was pretty hard and a thick thick slice. Usually if the bruschetta is hard the slice is thinner.Funny thing is some waiter came by gave us 2 plates and said our appetizer was on its way. A minute later our entrees came and no appetizer to be found halfway into our entrees the appetizer arrived.  Though I did find it odd to be told one thing is coming  but something else comes instead  I think they need to perfect the timing. If no one said anything about appetizers coming we wouldn't be concerned or care about the timing and would've carried on our conversation.The pizookie we ordered came out yummy  but I did question one thing I felt the inside of the cookie tasted more doughy and less cooked than I remember. I wish I got the ice cream on the side since it helped mask the undercookness.
Katy J.,San Jose  CA,0,1,,8/6/2017,1.0,This restaurant is by far the worst location ever. I been here at least 10times and each time something is always wrong. Service is way toooo slow so if you have time to waste go there. Oh yeah and the service sucks. Our server was Anthony. He's really nice but he needs to find a different job. Serving isn't his calling. I order a steak medium well to only get medium raw. I let him know my steak was wrong and of course he said he will fix it. Oh but my boyfriend has his food  he ate all his food before my new steak arrive. He did return to our table and he kind of shrugg off the fact my steak wasn't even at the table like it was the kitchen fault but really is.. he decides to bring my boyfriend ice cream real quick. When it finally arrive my boyfriend already had desert. I ask for a take out box not only did I not get one  my steak was wrong again because for some brilliant reason ANTHONY rung it in wrong not only once but twice. I decided this was officially the last time I tried this location. I never have these problem at the blossom hill location. Luckily the manager took care of our whole bill  but still that service and server is ridiculous beyond belief. If you want free food and bad service go there ask for Anthony.
Christina L.,San Jose  CA,288,61,52,7/17/2016,5.0,Great service from gennesaret! My boyfriend and I sat at the bar and was greeted by her right away  she suggested a beer and it was delicious. We come to bjs when we are in the area and out of all the servers Genna was awesome! Very bubbly and friendly! We are definitely requesting her to be our server from now on!
Eric M.,Santa Clara  CA,0,3,1,9/11/2016,5.0,Adriana Our server was amazing she was very friendly and knowledgeable about the beer selection and suggested I get a piranha which did not disappoint. her customer service was great and was very patient when I had trouble deciding what I wanted. And kept our waters full and made sure we got everything we needed very quickly. When we come back to bjs I hope to get adriana as our server again over all experience was great thank you adriana.
Ben L.,San Jose  CA,0,4,,3/12/2017,5.0,Ashley Bravo was our server and she was super sweet and attentive. She was smiling the whole time and made her guests feel welcomed.
Donovan T.,San Jose  CA,684,628,555,1/30/2015,2.0,This particular location is smaller then Cupertino and Oakridge but what it has going for it: it's not attached to a mall (Oakridge) so wait times aren't as bad and it actually has tons of parking (Cupertino). The Marketplace is my ultimate one stop shop for errands  so it's actually a great location.Anyways going back to my dining experience  quality is off. For a chain restaurant to have inconsistent tasting food is no bueno. My last visit  I had the Great White Pizza and it just didn't taste right. Pizza wasn't also piping hot when it arrived. It tasted as if it was left out for a good 15-20 minutes before arriving to my table. And what's the point of bringing out some ranch sauce AT THE END of the meal? I'm glad the service is better then the Oakridge Mall location (which is a HORRIBLE) but I probably won;'t be back here especially when there are so many better restaurants in the near by areas. (San Pedro Square)
Nora B.,Rio Vista  CA,13,21,4,2/12/2017,1.0,What a total let down! OK  it was Saturday evening and hubby and I expected a wait. We were informed wait time would be approximately 20 minutes; no problem there. Almost 40 minutes later  we decided to ask how much longer  especially as so many people who arrived after us were already enjoying their food; no they did not all have reservations. We were seated 5 minutes later and waited almost 15 minutes before waiter arrived. We ordered drinks and food immediately  as we had an event to attend. I was somewhat amazed it took soooooooo long to pour a Diet Coke and sparkling water. Drinks eventually arrived and then food. Hubby had ahi tuna salad  which he enjoyed. I had pulled pork sandwich  which was ok. Waiter asked if we would like another drink. My hubby asked for another soda. Waiter approaches our table with drink; oh no  not for our table. Oh  here he comes again. Oh no  not for our table again. These drinks were refills for people seated approximately 20 minutes after us. I was going to catch waiter's attention  but hubby told me not to bother. Hubby beckoned waiter and gave him our card  as we did not wish to be there awaiting check and spending more wasted time. He also informed waiter we had event to attend. Conclusion? Last time for us; very bad service!
Bryson L.,San Jose  CA,482,877,207,11/16/2015,2.0,The service here is in dire need of work. BJ's training program must be horrible. While common among all of their chains I'd say  this one is pretty much the same. Service:Hosts and hostesses are horrible at seating people. They always seem to take their time  and call out names at a normal audible level instead of trying to yell out the name over the noise of their restaurant. It's ridiculous that they don't just resort to the buzzers (they have them  but won't always use them). Once seated our table had no dining utensils  and no one noticed until we got our food. At which point the bus boy got them for us (nicest guy in this restaurant). One thing that always bugs me here too is how when they refill your root beer  a majority of the time they'll take the glass away still filled with some root beer leaving me without a drink until they come back. They ought to bring a new glass then take the old one away (once empty or not  I don't care  just leave the glass). On a recent visit  the waitress also asked us if we wanted to look at the dessert menu minutes after our entrees had arrived. She also forgot the bill when we had asked for it (we were waiting around for a while til she checked up on us again). Food:The food here is decent  it's just a bit overpriced. I would only come for lunch or dinner. Their pizzas and pastas are pretty safe bets. Same for the appetizers. I'd avoid the brunch though. Did not enjoy it.Drinks and Desserts:I've had hit and miss service with the drinks. The communication between the bartenders and our waitress caused me to get the wrong order (ordered 3 different shots  got all of the same shot). But they do offer a variety of beers and such. I really like the beers where they'll combine 2 together.All in all  this place suffices as a decent hangout spot  but the service is poor.
Jay J.,Chicago  IL,1,7,,9/25/2016,5.0,A very nice place with a variety of fresh beers. Ambience is really good  friendly staff  value for money. An ideal place to hangout with friends.
Donovan L.,Milpitas  CA,0,3,,2/9/2017,1.0,The wait staff here is absolutely horrible lmfao  you walk in and there's practically a wait just to be acknowledged. Fire the hostesses and get better ones cause they suck lol the take out girl too fire her  I promise it'll get better.
Dana G.,Hamilton  Canada,1,138,4,12/15/2016,1.0,Worst BJ's yet. Dough was not good and undercooked. Service was friendly but overwhelmed. Bathrooms were gross. Fail.
Celine L.,San Jose  CA,21,215,299,8/19/2015,2.0,The only thing worth coming to this place for is for the Pazookie and drinks. I took my boyfriend here for lunch and unfortunately we were very disappointed. The waitress was nice and seated us outside upon request. However  my boyfriend ordered the 5 Meat Deep dish pizza and I ordered the housetop sirloin with a side of mashed potatoes and shoestring fries. All of our food was cold and seemed as if it had been left out. Wtf?! Not to mention the sirloin steak I ordered was burned when I had asked for it to be medium rare. Not wanting to be a hassle  we decided not to say anything about it. The fries and potatoes were cold and we were unimpressed. Don't bother coming here for lunch. On the bright side  we ordered the Salted Caramel Pazookie and it was delicious!! Otherwise waste of money....
Kavya T.,Chicago  IL,392,301,793,10/11/2015,3.0,This location has outdoor seating so that's a + for me! Took a little too long to get our lunches out  even though there wasn't much of a crowd. I would understand if it was dinner but people usually have to get back to work on weekdays...
Cuervo R.,San Jose  CA,35,114,,9/15/2016,4.0,Skimming some of the reviews  it seems like this location has some issues with consistency. But I've been to several others before  and always had at least a 3-star time. Last weekend was my first time at this location  and my best BJ's experience yet (didn't mean that as a joke  but I'll take it). Plenty of parking for Saturday dinner service  good space & atmosphere. Service was good overall  food & drinks were really  surprisingly good. I like to go along with a place's theme if I can stand it. But I just wasn't in the mood for beer at the brewhouse. Lucky for me BJ's has a nice selection of signature drinks besides beer. So I tried one of their crafted cocktails (black cherry something or other)  followed by their cranberry cider. Both great choices.Our group got sliders & pizza to share  which were yummy. I also got maybe the best Caesar salad I've ever had  and the jambalaya I was craving. This is worth a special mention -- Caesar salad is not rocket science  and I've tried a bunch of 'em. Most of 'em are fine  nothing earth-shattering on the bad or good side. Some places really get it right  others really get it wrong. It's such a safe  simple dish I'm always amazed when I find a real standout. How do you make it taste so much better than the rest? How the hell do you manage to screw it up  let alone charge $$ for it?? Whatever BJ's does  lots of other places should be taking notes (Beach Chalet  I'm talking to you!).We had a really good time. I hope they can keep up the good work..!
Marie C.,San Jose  CA,0,2,,2/20/2017,1.0,The worst service ever maybe poor Mgmt plenty of empty seats but not coordinated. Sat down after 25 min wait when told wait would be 10-15 min after a Sharks game! Got tea no sugar asked for sugar food came quick but still the worst service ever. Not servers fault but Mgmt should schedule more people to work.
Dop T.,San Jose  CA,1,68,31,5/19/2016,1.0,"Ordered ONE burger using their premier rewards online system. Checked in at the ""take-out"" station. Guess they just *accepted/realized* the order when I told them I placed an online order. I was made to sit for more than 30 minutes. I went and enquired and guess what..The lady left as her shift got over I think and the next person had no idea about my order. Received my online order after 45 minutes of wait in the restaurant!! Ugh.. Horrible customer service. Way to go BJs.."
Cassandra C.,Oakland  CA,125,222,,7/21/2015,3.0,We were seated for about 15 minutes without attention. Then Samantha G. realised that whoever was actually supposed to serve that area wasn't going to do it and stepped in. She was cordial and efficient taking our orders and getting drinks. We ordered a standard burger and unlimited soup and salad. The delicious clam chowder and adequate wedge salad arrived 25 minutes before the burger. I was waiting to dig in until my companions meal arrived but was told no  eat now! We were eventually told that the burger was delivered to another table and they were grilling a new one. Samantha even offered to bring another soup and salad (free) for my friend and but the runner brought 2 bowls of soup instead. Finally the burger arrived and was fine  but nothing to wait 40 minutes for. . . SMH. Sometimes things happen. Someone is new in the kitchen or didn't show for a shift  there are missed communications  mishaps  mistakes and more. It happens. This would have been a complete mess if it weren't for our server  Samantha G. She got us taken care of  had something removed from the bill  and never acted like they WERE doing a great job or our requests were a problem. What BJ's needs is more employees like Samantha. Give her a raise  already.
Tom S.,San Jose  CA,3,3,,11/10/2015,2.0,We used to go there a lot. We are both Vegetarian and I'm Gluten free. They have a good gluten free crust for their pizza. However  they frequently mess up our order. Last night takes the cake. I got what I ordered but she got Pepperoni instead of peperoncini (green peppers) as an add-on on her vegetarian pizza  Our waiter was great but he was the only one working in the Bar seating area  so it took a long time to get our food the first time. We talked to our waiter and he re-ordered the pizza. After it came  she was eating it and found a piece of sausage. YIKES. After examining it  we found a piece of chicken in it too. So we made a big fuss. the waiter and manager were apologetic and said the kitchen staff was being lax. But  they had straightened them out. I was done eating so we asked for a THIRD pizza to go. The manager said he watched them make it to be sure there was no cross contamination.Well  you guessed it - that pizza had a piece of ham in it when she ate it the next day.Clearly something was seriously wrong in their kitchen. We are now looking for other good Gluten free and vegetarian pizza in town. It will be a while before we go back. Confidence destroyed.....
Alicia L.,Sunnyvale  CA,127,35,13,6/21/2016,1.0,Both times I have been to this BJ's  they have the slowest service ever. Slow waiters  slow kitchen  and bad management.
Micaela B.,San Jose  CA,127,33,8,10/26/2015,2.0,I ordered my food online & got it to go. First of all  we waited quite a while just for the lemonade  I could see my food just sitting in the to go bag. My mini Great White deep dish pizza was decent. Pizookie trio (triple choc  white macadamia  peanut butter) was terrible  they were all burnt & hard. Chicken tenders (kids meal) was super salty  fries were literally reheated  you could taste how stale they were  and the included drink (strawberry lemonade) wasn't cold. Honey mustard container wasn't filled all the way & only given one.Basically  don't order online.
Anne F.,Milpitas  CA,24,42,16,6/24/2016,4.0,We got lucky! Got seats for about 12 peeps without making any reservations. Food was okay  had big serving of sides. Wait staff was the best!!! The reason for the 4 stars! Will be back!
Bryan F.,San Jose  CA,27,40,1,7/6/2016,5.0,First let me say I usually avoid this type of restaurant. I prefer the smaller foodie type places. But this place is special  they actually care about costumer service  the management is very responsive and go out of their way to make things right! I'm also always pleased that 9 out of 10 servers I've had (I do go here 2-3 times a month) are excellent!
Alexandra W.,Porterville  CA,0,5,2,9/3/2016,1.0,Came to this BJ's before the Coldplay concert. I knew it was a mistake when I tried checking in on the app  only to be told that they didn't have anything under my name. Showed them the confirmation on my phone and the hostess just shrugged  then blamed it on their IT department. Food was okay- deep dish ravioli was bland. Took forever to get the bill  then when the waiter brought back my credit card he said their credit card system was down and they weren't sure if my card was charged so I needed to wait. Meanwhile  time is ticking for us to get to our concert. He came back 15 minutes later and asked for my credit card again to run manually since their system still wasn't working. I asked if they were sure I wasn't being charged twice- his response was to make sure to check my credit card statement. What a joke- how is this place still in business??
Kenna N.,San Jose  CA,1,7,2,6/29/2017,1.0,"I am very disappointed with every single aspect of my dinner experience tonight. I came in with two friends. We ordered sliders and wings and when the sliders came out there were no grilled onions in it. Also  we ordered bone-in wings but they gave us boneless. This was not a big deal but when I mentioned it to my waitress  she was unhelpful and said ""the grilled onions are actually inside the patty"" like I was stupid. And no  there were no onions inside of the patties. Next  after we finished eating  we waited for our waitress to come take our dessert order which took about 10 minutes of us just sitting there. We ordered 1 original pizookie. When it came out  the ""ice cream"" on top of the pizookie was completely frost bitten and icey  clearly left in the freezer for too long. At this point we waited for our waitress to come around but she walked past our table like 3 times without helping us. I had to call over another waiter to help us. On top of this  it is a Thursday night and the restaurant was empty so there is no excuse for this horrible service and food. There was nothing done to compensate and I\'m very upset. Please do better for your customers BJs."
James G.,San Jose  CA,22,217,46,8/1/2015,1.0,Lame. Saw two San Jose Officers dining there. We picked up their check and left a tip but their waiter still took their money! So pissed off  I will never be back.
Rudy J R.,San Jose  CA,41,38,49,7/23/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Experienced a very poor dinner with two friends. We placed our orders and waited close to thirty minutes for our food - one dinner took another fifteen minutes. The server  Frank B.  brought one order incorrectly and we eventually had it corrected - only we had to get it to go because two of us had already finished our dinners. I had to go to the bar twice to get refills for our lemonades because the server  Frank B.  never returned to our table to check on his. He did not even check with us to see if our food was ok. We called a manager and told him about our experience. When we received our check  we were doubled charged for one dinner and had to have it removed. Not a single employee or manager at the restaurant apologized to us for our poor experience.
Ashley N.,San Jose  CA,190,97,64,11/1/2015,1.0,"I\'m not a huge fan of BJ\'s but my family does come every so often to switch it up from our usual dinner date spots. I\'ve done happy hour here too and was pleased with the food and drinks before. This last visit was the absolute worst. First  my husband is on crutches and they tried to put us at a table in a walkway. Hello  you can see him on crutches clearly he\'s hurt so why would you put him somewhere where people walking by might bump into him and hurt him more?! I had to ask for a booth. Then  our waiter was really pushy about getting our order in. In case you didn\'t realize  your menu is like a freakin novel  give me some time please. And he kept pushing us to order drinks or appetizers. We said no thank you. You\'re a server. Not a used car salesman. Calm the eff down. Then  my husbands wedge salad was drenched in blue cheese. He couldn\'t even eat half of it. No one cared to ask how it was and just wisked it away once he appeared to be done with it. Then  my sons order was wrong. He was served sliders and weird happy face potatoes. He ordered a burger and fries from the kids menu and it made no mention of the burger being sliders with quarter sized patties. Not to mention my food was under whelming. I had shrimp and asparagus pasta. Some of the asparagus and shrimp were so over cooked/old I couldn\'t chew through it  which explains why it was covered in sauce. And my husbands ""pepperoni"" pizza had no visible pepperoni. Lastly the check. The server charged us over $20 for this simple pepperoni pizza with olives and basil. The menu said $14. Then server explains that we are charged per topping. If you\'re going to charge per topping then at least put a visible amount of it. And since when it cheese and sauce a ""topping"" on pizza? Isn\'t that a standard pizza ingredient?! This is the perfect example as to why tipping should not exist. Servers only care about the amount of the bill and the amount of their tip  not about the people dining or providing good customer service. Shitty food and shitty service. We will not be coming here again."
Topher H.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,273,34,19,7/3/2016,1.0,First server went out of his way to be rude. After asking Rachel the manager to switch servers  she comped our meal. However  the service got worse from there. Drink refill came back with a tomato in the soda  the pizza was ice cold and not what was ordered  and the replacement server was WAY inattentive. Not only worst BJ's Brewhouse  but restaurant!
Gui A.,San Jose  CA,379,49,61,7/14/2015,1.0,Food and service here are absolutely a joke!I mean  really bad! Restaurant was almost empty and still 25 min to get a second beer and soda refills after ordering it-- not even an apology from the waitress Be careful with the skinny Asian waitress w glasses. Run!!!
Elysia M.,Portland  OR,159,352,1252,11/24/2014,3.0,This BJs was okay. THe restaurant atmosphere was great  very clean and warm the only thing is that it's so dim inside that it is hard to see and it is really hard to see the menu. I am a young person with good eyes and I had to hold the menu close to my face because the shadows in the place made me feel like i was blind! The food was great. I have eaten at several BJs and this one's food wasn't bad. I had a salad and my boyfriend had a sandwich. All of which was great even the wedge fries were cooked just right.The servic eon the other hand.. one of the worst services I've had at BJs. The front person taking down our name and number of guests in our party was very sweet and great. THe ladies that escorted us to the table were rude and when I had asked them a question  brushed me off like I wasn't worth anything. The girl that took our order was nice  but once she realized we weren't going to spend much money she only came back to give us our check.The thing that sucked the most was that it took over 35 minutes for our food to come. The table next to us ordered at the same time (with the same waitress) and ordered much more complicated food than ours and got their food about 25 minutes before we did.Overall  good food  but bad service.
Gregory W.,San Jose  CA,0,9,4,8/22/2015,2.0,Yes  2 star equals 'Meh  I've experienced better'. Yes. I have  yet  I'll just say I was the not so smart one to order a burger at BJ's because I guess they don't respect cook temperatures or they were just too busy to give the effort. All in all  the double bison burger was good  but way over cooked. I mean  ya  maybe with the photo you could see some pink tint  but come one  if it was a decent 'bison'  you would be prompt to under cook it right? In order to not ruin the burger  right? But whatever  ya  my fault for the burger. I'll stick to the pork chop even though I have to educate each and every server there that I can select a meat temperature other then hockey puck aka well done. I get it medium or med rare if they allow it; just hit or miss. I will still come back.
Bryan M.,San Jose  CA,9,69,6,10/12/2015,3.0,Long wait time but otherwise friendly staff.Pizookies aren't so great (really small).
Goldie V.,Campbell  CA,121,8,1,6/26/2016,5.0,The service here the handful of times we have been since it opened has been pretty terrible. A few waiters/waitresses told us there have been management changes though and they are trying to bring it back up to par. We had Eduardo tonight as a server and the server and he has been amazing! He's been super attentive  personable and he didn't miss a thing. Best service we have ever had here by far. Management-- give this guy a raise!
Penelope G.,San Jose  CA,33,6,4,7/21/2015,1.0,Worst service our waitress literally went and sat in her car and didn't attend to us.We didn't get plates  napkins  or utensils  we had to get up and get these things ourselves. We had to ask for something THREE times before receiving it! I wasn't even offered a water refill.
Eva E.,Morgan Hill  CA,0,3,,2/22/2017,5.0,Sat at the bar tonight and got amazing service from the bar staff! Chris and Ryan were on top of my drinks. Every time I visit this location  I head straight to the bar and receive great service each time. Will be back!
Trang B.,San Jose  CA,162,578,82,8/2/2014,4.0,Maybe it was a slow day  maybe i had good luck  maybe other people just suck. Regardless  my service was really good! My water was filled  the waiters were friendly and attentive without being ass kissers.Went for happy hour. Wasn't particularly impressed with the happy hour menu so we ordered some things off of it and some small bites.Spinach and artichoke dip: Average..... More artichoke and cream than spinach.Bruschetta: It comes with a pesto sauce. I didn't really like the focaccia type bread it was on  but I liked it a lot overall.Corn fritters: Unique. It was fritters with a spicy chipotle  bacon  and corn. You kind of need to swirl it around and assemble it yourself.Sliders: Boring. Sliders with pickles  lettuce and ketchup. Comes with 2. And fries.Summary: Food was mostly average  prices were good  portions were exactly the price you pay for  unlike Yardhouse where they're massive  and service was good. I left happy hour happy  without having to be liquored up. Gasp.
Karen M.,San Jose  CA,8,26,85,6/5/2016,1.0,needs to state location when taking phone orders. I called Coleman location thinking it was Oakridge and I was told at oakridge that this happens a lot for orders and reservations so just a tip for everyone. it's a major inconvenience
Katherine C.,Fremont  CA,633,346,1903,10/21/2013,2.0,We came here for Happy Hour for some team bonding time. I ordered a wildberry mojito from the bar. The service was really friendly  but I did not enjoy my drink at all. It tasted like it was doubled in sweetness. It took me the whole 2 and half hours we were there to finish the drink. We ordered several mini deep dish pizzas  boneless chicken pieces  lettuce cups  among other things. They were all fairly cheap. The portions weren't too small for HH  except the boneless chicken--which looked incredibly sad and small on the plate. It wasn't busy when we got there  Monday night around 5:30PM. It got busy after 6 and there were so many servers on the floor running around. The food came out very slowly. Though it was nice checking out the new BJ's  I don't think I'll be coming back. I've only gone to any BJ's restaurant maybe 2 or 3 times? I'm just not fond of the food.
Nicole K.,Aiea  HI,150,65,112,9/15/2015,5.0,Great lunch specials and a large selection to chose from. All kinds of food and drinks at a good price. I got the soup and pizza lunch special for under $8 and the arugula and beet sandwich. Surprising it was served with yellow Beets which were quite tasty. I've been here a couple times and it never disappoints
Raghuveer P.,North San Jose  San Jose  CA,4,2,,1/7/2017,1.0,The worst BJ's ever. I've been to lot of other location and pretty happy with BJ's food and beer. But this particular location is the worst of all. I ordered chicken tortilla soup bowl but they served something even less than the size of a cup. We also ordered Santa Fe salad and it has literally 5 small pieces of chicken. I also felt that quantity was less in general as compared to other BJ's location. For our leftover when I asked a to go bag  they gave me some used BJ's bag as if they are reusing it. If they want to charge me $0.10 per bag  I'm okay to pay it but please don't give me used bag. I don't know what all was kept in it and if it's even hygienic to use this used bag. Not coming here again. I would rather drive to Cupertino or Newark but not this one.
Peter F.,Villa Park  CA,0,5,1,5/6/2016,2.0,My pazookie was folded in half...my last one was burnt. 2.5 stars sounds about right. Seems like some staff care  but most dont. Save yourselves.
Cathy N.,San Jose  CA,348,52,262,10/24/2015,2.0,It was quick because the actually check the wait list for us and put us in. We asked our waiter a question he didn't even answer it for us. They are very slow on service and we waited so long for our beer. Food want that great salmon was too dry.
Charmaine P.,Sunnyvale  CA,14,22,2,6/5/2016,1.0,If you love to use ur premium rewards this place IS THE WORST PLACE TO USE IT! I love Bjs restaurants!! This is the very first time i got really annoyed! The food was good no complain but our server( old light lady) i guess her name was kathryn.. I asked her if i could use my 10 dollars off from my premium rewards she asked for my phone number and i gave her my card. When she came bck she charged me with the whole thing. I was like what the heck? Then she gave me this look like i cnt afford our meal. What a shame for this amazing restaurants!!! NEVER EVER EVER EVER one more time NEVER AGAIN WILL I COME BACK IN THIS PLACE! AND I WILL ALSO TELL MY FRIENDS ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE SO THEY WONT EVEN COME HERE AND GET THAT ATTITUDE FROM THIS PLACE!
Jennifer P.,San Jose  CA,29,210,139,10/20/2014,3.0,It's a chain so I'm not really expecting much. They are branching out and have some other beers on tap aside from their own. This location is new and spacious. And there's usually ample seating at the bar during happy hour  except when the giants are in the playoffs. But happy hour is now throughout the restaurant when the bar is packed for games. Which is great for me when funds are scarce. Love the fall because everything pumpkin starts to be on the menu  and BJs is no exception. They have a pretty decent pumpkin ale and I gave up my starchless diet for a pumpkin pizookie. Which was well worth it. I got a mini pizookie to not feel so guilty...not sure if it helped  but oh well.This is a good happy hour joint with ok good. If you are looking for gourmet  this is not it. But every so often a pizookie calls.
April T.,San Jose  CA,34,20,,10/6/2015,2.0,Went here for dinner with my friends over the weekend... we weren't impressed. We show up around six and ask for a table for four  but the wait time was over 40 minutes. We waited around outside for a good twenty to thirty minutes until our table was ready. Luckily it wasn't 45 minutes that we had to wait  but it still took forever. Our waitress was a nice woman; she asked us how our evening was going and even complimented my friend on her dress. She said she would be right back with out waters  yah that was a lie. We sat there for another good ten minutes without a clue as to where she went. Eventually she came back with our waters and we were finally ready to place an order: I got the glazed salmon with a classic vinaigrette salad on the side and a pale ale IPA. Surprisingly the food didn't take too long to get to us  but I didn't enjoy it very much at all. The salmon was for sure farm raised and tasted more fishy than it should have  not to mention the portions are not the biggest. The salad I had was actually really good  a little under dressed  but that's alright with me. The IPA was a little flat also  but still tasted fine I guess. About half of my friends liked their meal and other half (including me) didn't. All in all  BJ's has a lot of areas it could improve on. I'll probably not be stopping by here again any time soon  just not worth it in my opinion.
Jason H.,Hermosa Beach  CA,0,21,,1/15/2017,1.0,Terrible service. Went in with group of six to watch football and grab lunch. They had several tables available with views of tv's but they would not sit us there as they were supposedly reserved. We ate lunch in the corner with bad view of tv's. when we left all but one of the tables that had been reserved where unoccupied. Obviously a terrible business plan and we will never go back. What seemed like the manager  short blonde hair with glasses  was rude and totally unaccomadating.
Jocelyn S.,Las Vegas  NV,227,212,332,5/16/2015,2.0,Came here after getting picked up from the airport for a late night drink and dinner. Restaurant was still open for another 2-3 hours so we had plenty of time. Looked like people were still waiting to get sat so we headed to the bar. Grabbed a booth and waited for someone to come over. Few moments went by so we asked the server for a menu when she had a second. We started out with some drinks and ordered some flatbreads and calamari to share. When our food came out we were never given any sharing plates so we just ate straight from the flatbread plates we were sharing. The flatbreads were ok  I know BJs is known for their deep dish pizzas but it was a little late at night and I didn't want something so heavy. The food and service was just ehhh... I wouldn't go out of my way to return.
Serena S.,San Jose  CA,141,78,154,9/5/2015,2.0,I've come to this Bj's nearly three times and still experienced mediocre (if that) service. The first time I ever came to the Bj's at this location was for my friend's birthday dinner. We were a party of about 10  and we came in about 8:30/9pm. The hostess told us it would be about a 20-30 minute wait. An hour later  we STILL weren't seated. I get it  a big party is a big party. But why tell us 20-30 if we're going to be waiting around for an hour? At around 9:50/10 we were finally seated  but it didn't even look too busy inside. We finally ordered and it took forever to get our food. The food didn't even come all at once  either. After 30 minutes just one person got their food. We kept asking our server repeatedly for how long it would take  and he never had an answer. The food wasn't anything special (to be honest I don't even remember what I got) and the whole time i was just thinking about how much money I'm wasting at this place. At this point  we just wanted the check. You think they could do that right? But no. We asked probably 3 different employees for the check. Just that took probably 20 minutes! By the time we were done there was nearly no other customers in the restaurant. I don't know if they were understaffed  or the servers were just clueless and new  but either way you could tell how poorly managed this place was. I don't think it was really the waiters fault  and I don't want to blame them but the management in general was just really really bad.Okay  the second time I came to this place was because my group of friends wanted a pizookie for dessert. I was skeptical about this place of course but it was a weekday night and the 6 of us were seated right away. All we ordered was a trio platter with two original and one cookies a cream. 10 minutes later  they come out with the wrong order  nice :-(. We only ordered one thing and it came out wrong! I understand how things can get mixed up and I'm not rude about it at all  buuut all I can think about is how things never really seem to go as planned here  lol. The pizookie was DELICIOUS if you know Bj's. I think that's what gives them 2 stars in itself. So this experience was better then the first but still  meh. The third time I came here was last night. it was a Friday night so I expected it to be a little busy  but I didn't want to wait because I was so hungry. It was just me and one other person. We walked in and just saw the employees standing around that little table thing where the hostess is supposed to check you in. We waited there for probably 2 or 3 minutes before anyone even said anything to us. I was so confused  like wait did I go to the wrong place? Like aren't you guys supposed to acknowledge us walking into the restaurant....Anyways  the lady says hi to us and tells us it's going to be a 20 minute wait for two people. That's my cue to leave.I would've stayed if I didn't have that awful first experience of waiting for an hour. And I really didn't want to waste another hour waiting for my food. I don't write that many bad reviews so I hope you know I'm being honest! There are plenty of other restaurants in downtown that could satisfy your cravings  and if you really want that pizookie just get it for takeout :-)
Cerelia C.,San Jose  CA,97,11,11,8/17/2014,4.0,I believe that this BJ's location was just fine tonight. I thought tonight would have been slow because it was raining outside  but it was actually quite busy.I was seate
Anil J.,San Jose  CA,0,37,22,8/3/2016,4.0,I like BJ's for their beer choices! My friend loved the sampler and the appetizers we ordered. Our service was quick and prompt. Had been here few times earlier too and liked the food  drinks and ambience. It can be noisy on the days when local sports teams are playing and covered on TV. Overall good experience and would come back
Kritter V.,Santa Cruz  CA,26,220,5,7/24/2015,2.0,"Seated 20 minutes with no one asking if we wanted a beverage. I finally had to call someone over and the girl gave us attitude as though to say  ""How dare you ask me to do my job."" it was not that busy  either.Food was blah. I had the cherry glazed salmon. It was very dry and flavorless. The quinoa was pretty decent."
Denise L.,Santa Clara  CA,962,2283,3670,5/25/2015,4.0,Really crowded  and a smaller BJ's compared to other locations. Bar was empty later on a Saturday evening  and drinks were quick and on point. Clean and great location to have drinks and good food!
Emma S.,San Jose  CA,3,30,108,11/26/2014,5.0,Had dinner there last night and everyone was so accommodating when we arrived with 4 little ones and 4 adults!Mixed drinks were on point and food was delish! I ordered a side of the white cheddar mashed potatoes and expected it to have gobs of cheese over it or something! It tasted like the powder form kind of potatoes with salt. Aside from the mash potatoes  all our dishes were great!!
Kunal A.,Los Angeles  CA,2,3,1,1/7/2017,1.0,Crappy food. Cold pasta  cold and soggy pizza. Appetizers were served after main course. Horrible wait times. Wasted precious time and money. Just go to round table piazza or something for better food and quality for less price.
Anh N.,San Jose  CA,147,132,921,7/11/2015,5.0,I really love it here! Servers are always nice and attentive. I love that it's a great spot to watch sports. Their happy hour is amazing! The food is great! Beers are delicious. And Absolut is their well vodka! I just wish the bar area was bigger it they are ice enough most times to open happy hour up in the regular dinning area. My favorite is their mac n cheese. I get it every time. Pizza is always good. Not a fan of their sliders. Saw the Warriors win it here! Nice people here.
Samuel H.,San Jose  CA,45,8,1,12/11/2015,1.0,This place is terrible! Everything is way over priced and over rated. The sandwiches come out soggy and they taste disgusting. The only thing I would recommend trying here are the avocado egg rolls but be warned they are not worth bothering to go here. My experience with the hostesses has been horrendous! They are absolutely rude and unwelcoming. Now for the service  I used to sit in the bar if there were seats available and I must say most of the wait staff are friendly and welcoming but once they great you that's going to be one of the few times you see them at your table - even when they're slow and don't have many tables. I'm not sure if they're in the kitchen chatting away or if they take a lot of breaks but you don't often see them. The menu has a ton of options but don't bother asking the servers what they recommend between the options your pondering because they're just going to tell you they're all good and popular - not very helpful. The bar serves weak drinks and they're not really good at mixing  I mean how hard is it for any bartender to make a martini! Stick with the beer if you're going to go here and drink but be prepared to wait...AND certainly don't bother asking for the manager  they're absolutely useless and you'll see them way less often than the servers! Obviously they're terrible at their jobs  don't know how to hire or attract talented employees and they don't care about your experience. The cooks come out of the kitchen sometime and they look dirty and frumpy makes you wonder about who's been handing your food.. It really is a shame I had high hopes for this place when they were going in so close to the rose garden. It was just a quick Uber away if you were looking for a hip place to relax on a Friday night and have some cocktails or beers with some friends. The BJ's in Cupertino next to Apple really has it dialed in a lot more.It really would be nice if this place could pull it together and figure out how a restaurant is supposed to work. But to bad I won't be going back to check and see.Enter at your own risk!
Sal C.,Lahaina  HI,0,3,,12/29/2016,1.0,I got here around 6:? Got seated they took our drink order and now we have been here for over an hour with no food and the manager just came and said they lost our ticket order and just found it he also said he was going to personally bring our food out himself I just want my food I don't care who brings it i am starving I liked the looks of the place but the service and lack of being able to even Cook is horrible u don't know how this place stays in business I will never come back again and will not recomme8thus place to my enemy thumbs down at the end the night manager bought our dinner because of the bad service I just want my food I am hungry
Steve N.,San Jose  CA,20,27,21,11/6/2015,2.0,The food is reasonable  prices are a bit high but they send out coupons every month or so. On my last visit the service was terrible  the waiter told us that it was not their table and made us feel like we should be appreciative that we got served at all. 50 minutes to get the table  15 minutes to get acknowledged and then over 30 minutes to pay  which only happened after calling the manager over.
Angelina L.,San Jose  CA,31,8,2,5/22/2016,5.0,The food was mediocre. I ordered my steak medium and it came out well done. Our server asked us if we would like another one. I just ate it because it was too hungry to wait any longer. The five stars goes to Paola (our server). The Warriors game was on tonight so it was super busy but we were taken care of by Paola. Her service was amazing. She kept checking on us. Super friendly  and even told us not to rush out if we wanted to stay and watch the game. Paola! You're amazing! Thank you! Honestly  since I was not impressed by the food  if Paola wasn't our server tonight  I would probably never come back. The other employees we encountered were not 1/20 as nice and professional as Paola.
Kiyana D.,San Jose  CA,116,88,418,6/19/2014,4.0,"Finally tried this location out  despite reading all the bad reviews on yelp since being open  thought it was about time to see if this Bj\'s lives up to par with the other 3 locations I\'ve been to. Honestly  this location is the closes to me  so it would be nice to come to this one more often. Depending where I\'m at I\'d drive all the way to Fremont or De Anza just for Bj\'s.Went here twice in 1 week and both times I had great service and couldn\'t complain about a thing. I love Bj\'s food and pizookie so it\'ll definitely have me coming back. The only thing I could say I hated or surprised Was I had a soda  and in the menu it said ""complimentary refills"" not until I got home  the waiter charged me twice for it on my bill. A tad annoying since I was using my Bj\'s rewards and used my free pizookie that day. So she felt the need to charge me for something else? But Wthell  I should have been paying a tad bit more careful before handing my card to them. Other than that  service and food live up to their standards."
Rochelle T.,Campbell  CA,7,52,1,6/8/2015,3.0,"We went here today for lunch and were promptly seated in a relatively empty restaurant - just a few tables ahead of us. Our waitress promptly took our order - got our drinks  filled them  filled them again and before we knew it 40 minutes had passed by with no food. Our waitress said ""the kitchen was backed up"" - um  when we sat down the restaurant was fairly empty. Granted 40 minutes later it was getting fuller (still not an entirely packed house as I have seen it). One manager came over and wanted to argue with me that we ordered at the busiest time - um  no we did not. Our waitress was very kind the whole time and you could tell this was not a good day for the kitchen.So our food finally arrived  about 50 minutes in at this point. My brussel-sprout kale salad arrived with no brussel sprouts :(. We were already so late at this point  I told the waitress I would eat as is (I hate wasting food) and it was quite tasty although those brussel sprouts would have been delicious I am sure.Now  the reason for the 3 stars - while still eating  I am assuming it was the supervisor who came out and informed us due to the issues we had to deal with  our meal was covered and she apologized profusely  no excuses  just covered our meals and provided me with a gift card and asked us to come back again.That was so sweet and unnecessary to comp our entire meal. And I am sure there was some crazy issue going on today that they did not fully explain - I understand issues do happen. And I really do appreciate that they went above and beyond to remedy the situation. We will absolutely be back!"
Nirva P.,Nashville  TN,90,1,,3/4/2016,1.0,"Me and a couple friends went to get dinner and there was a 45 min wait  so we went to the bar and got some drinks and my drink came out tasting like sugar and water. I told the bartender and she ask ""so what do you want me to do about it?"" I said maybe put in some alcohol? She put in a shot of tequila and charged me 9 bucks on top of the 10 bucks for the drink without telling me that she was going to charge me more than the price of the drink for a shot in the drink. Then they texted us that our table was ready and while we were closing out at the bad they gave our table away. Then the staff started talking crap about us for no reason so we left and went to Wing Stop. Terrible service!!!"
Diane P.,San Jose  CA,0,18,5,12/23/2016,1.0,Don't bother with call ahead service. I had just finished touring lights in Willow Glen with four hungry children. Called from the car with all the kids hearing that our name was added to the list (she made me repeat my name 3x - that should have been my clue I was talking to an incompetent employee) and she said our table would be ready around 6:30. I arrived at 6:20 and they said my name wasn't on list and wait was 40 minutes. I didn't know the name of who I spoke to  so To them I guess there was no way to prove I called. My four under 13 aged witnesses didn't count. Merry Christmas to us and off to a different restaurant that knows about customer service. Merry Christmas to the BJs employees  including manager  who ruined our holiday dinner plans.
Desirae P.,Santa Clara  CA,4,71,11,8/22/2014,2.0,Second time I've been here. Previous visit was so horrible  I said I'd never come back. Food took forever  server ignored our table completely and our checks took forever as well. Came back again recently  great service (can't remember servers name) but food was so so. The appetizer wasn't horrible  but looked like I could have bought all the items from my local grocery store out of the freezer section and put them in the microwave. Side salad was drenched in dressing  and my pizza seemed under cooked and was cold. Cheese wasn't melted all the way. The lights were way too dim so I couldn't even see what was on my pizza great service this time around but food was lacking  most likely won't return.
Francis N.,San Jose  CA,1,8,29,1/2/2015,3.0,The wait was so long. I waited a hour and a half when they said it was a 30min-1hour wait. The pizza was kinda too greasy for me and the calamari was mediocre. The service was ok.It was pretty cold in there.I'd say this chain particularly is probably the worst
Julian B.,Newman  CA,0,11,,5/30/2016,2.0,"Strict rules. I ordered the salmon with the couscous. There we\'re a few grains of couscous. Tiny portion. So I asked for more couscous. I got it but was billed for extra couscous. When I complained  the waitor kept saying he was sorry and that was the rule.question: If you are paying good money towards a plate  the rule says ""no modifications  no accommodations for the customer ""?It is new to me. Next time my destination will be Dave & Buster where you can get what you want."
Kae O.,San Francisco  CA,0,1,,3/21/2016,5.0,Excellent service. I loved our waitress Anna. Best waitress I ever had. I have bjs where I live in San bruno but the workers were never as friendly and helpful as here. She did everything to make us feel welcomed and enjoy our meal. Definetly will come back again. Thank you Anna and your manager for our free appetizer and pazookie. Everything was perfect and I am stuffed right now. If you ever eat here request Anna you won't regret it and don't forget to tip her she's worth it. Thaaaaank you again Annna. See you soon
Channing M.,Santa Clara  CA,501,312,322,3/27/2014,2.0,"We came in today for lunch and the restaurant was not full at all. Our server or the kitchen (or both) were moving really slow today and it took us almost 2 hours to get through our entire meal. He immediately asked us for our drink order when we sat down and when he brought back the iced tea we asked for sweetener. 15 minutes later we sill did not have any indication as to when the appetizers would come out nor did we have the sweetener. He replied that he was ""looking for it."" I am sorry  but in a huge restaurant there has to be sweetener somewhere. I could have walked to the target and back by the time we finally got it. The food came out really slowly. If this were not a special work lunch then there is no way I would be able to go to this place on my lunch break and be back within the hour and a half time limit. The ambiance is great  the decor is great  and from what I can tell it is pretty clean. I will have to come back again to see if the kitchen/service is any better. But only when I have LOTS of time to kill."
Elina F.,San Jose  CA,0,13,,4/30/2015,2.0,"My boyfriend and I have been going here for some time now and overall we like it. However  I\'m giving it 2 stars based on our last visit.We wanted to go to a place where we can have dinner and watch the basketball game  Spurs vs. Clippers. We discussed several places which we knew have TVs and show sports events and decided to go to BJ\'s.We were seated at the left-most side of the restaurant which is somewhat separate from the rest of the place. There were 3 TVs there  2 playing NFL and 1 playing hockey. We asked if they can switch the channel for one of them to show the NBA game and both times we were told ""Ok  I\'ll check with the manager"". Mind you we asked two different waiters. 1hr there and they never changed it. What made it even worse was the fact that they were showing the game in the other side of the restaurant but because of the layout of the room  we couldn\'t see anything. To top this off  we waited 15 min to be seated  I waited 15 minute for a soup and a salad  and 15 min for someone to pick up the check. That\'s 45min of our night wasted in waiting.Bottomline is - next time we want to go have dinner and watch a game  we will definitely avoid BJs. Such a shame  we used to like it there."
Kimberly D.,Stockton  CA,2,43,1,4/13/2016,1.0,Wow. We decided to give this place a second try and again this place is CRAP! Can't get anything right! Can't even get a simple water right. What's so hard about getting an order right? We had to send back our meal twice. And the third time it takes you 30 mins to cook a burger? Wow this place is a joke. Waste of money  food is crap.
Maddy C.,West San Jose  San Jose  CA,0,6,,1/12/2017,5.0,I love BJs. The place is nice and clean. People are friendly. I always order a garlic shrimp asparagus pasta...the best pasta ever
LaShae C.,San Jose  CA,9,6,1,4/27/2014,4.0,Finally  an experience worth raving about! Apparently this particular BJ's has a bad rep for service  and until this evening  for me  food as well. I'm usually pleased the spinach stuffed mushrooms and avocado rolls they offer here  but haven't found an entree worth writing about until the tri tip dip I had tonight. Fortunately we had the pleasure of being served by Courtney  who recommended my entree AND ensured my girlfriends salmon would actually be blackened instead of the oddly seasoned fish we've had here twice before  and once overly raw. Accommodating is an understatement for the service we've received from Courtney tonight. Friendly  attentive  accurate and definitely worth returning. I've left off one star because unfortunately some of the other staff here hadn't quite hit the mark attending to details in the past. Nevertheless  tonight Courtney made up for that  thank you so much!
Jesse W.,Santa Clara  CA,39,68,58,3/23/2015,2.0,I often recommend BJ's for social gatherings because the menu offerings are generally crowd pleasing. The beer selection is good. Their signature deep dish pizzas are tasty. The pizookies are awesome.Unfortunately  I have to say this Coleman Ave location falls very short of the standards other BJ's restaurants have set.I first visited within a couple weeks after their grand opening. The service was terrible. I understand that many of them were probably new employees  and likely students from the nearby universities  but even their managers seemed inexperienced. The waitress who took our orders seemed very confused. When things were brought out they were incorrect. Some drinks we ordered never came  and after multiple reminders  we were finally told they were 'out of stock' of one of the ingredients.This was about a year and a half ago. I hesitated to write a review then  because I wanted to give them another chance after some time. I came back a month or two later  and it was the same story. It was even worse to me  because I had brought back a bigger group for lunch time  with reservations. I expected with reservations being an advance notice  they would be sure to have adequate staff and service. This was not the case. Again orders were goofed. Service seemed confused. Managers seemed unable to help.But I still didn't give up. In the past year  most recently two weeks ago  I have returned 3 more times for various occasions. The story has not changed. I'm pretty disappointed to have to say I don't recommend this location until they get their act together. It appears the recent yelpers would agree with me on this.
John R R.,San Jose  CA,0,3,,9/5/2016,1.0,Terrible  Terrible. Don't waste you money or time.went Sunday 09/04/2016.5 Adults and 2 kids.parking lot was empty at 7:00 and that should've been a clue.got seated 15 minutes after arriving with an empty place. Ordered a few drinks and a couple of appetizers. Waited for ever for this to arrive. Octopus was raw and the tuna salad was bland.I ordered first cause I wanted a burger.so we wait and we wait and we wait.Drinks are gone Apps are gone and we wait.40 minutes go buy and I ask another server can she send or server to us.ooo you haven't got your food yet.And I said were have you been were out of drinks.ooo I'm sorry.Everyone finally gets there food but me.i wait and wait no one is coming around in a empty Restaurant at all.so I ask a gal to fined our server.She shows up 15 minutes later and ask what's up.I told her I never got my food.oooo I'm so sorry.it came 20 minutes later.The burger was burnt frys were burnt and oily and cold.to me this is unacceptable. It's just a beer and burger joint.Never never will I our the family that was with me ever go back.And everyone I come a cross I'll let them know how this hole in the ground is ran.Our server kept saying did the Manger did she stop by 3 times no she didn't no she didn't. No we just won't ever go back.shouldve known we could've made better burgers at home.
Kyle B.,El Cerrito  CA,146,66,581,5/4/2014,1.0,This location was a complete fail.Slow service. Messed up our order. I understand the place may be busy because there was a game on that night  but this place needs to hire servers who actually know how to serve.. I ordered a California Burger. An original burger came out. Didn't touch it  told the server and she left for like 15mins to see what went wrong. (mind you  we were in the outside seating area). Came back and found out she wrote down the wrong order. Asked if I wanted them to make a new one.. if it was going to take them another 20mins; no thanks. So I just asked for the sides that were not in the burger. Another 15mins go by..nothing.. Finally she brings it back  claiming the cooks said the burger is exactly the same with the avocados and peppers I asked for. Clearly its not. The only thing thats similar of the two is the burger patty  which was dry as sh*t. Thought this could be fixed with a comped pizookie... Umm NO. Wanted to speak to their manager  but we just wanted to get the eff out of there.vWe even waited 20+ mins just to get our bill rung up. Really? I'm only giving them one star because theirs no 1/2 star option. I  personally  will NEVER come back to this location. **the table behind us had a different server  but waited an hour before their food came out out  which eventually was wrong as well.. **
Akshay T.,San Jose  CA,102,4,1,5/7/2016,5.0,Superb restaurant. Went there for my birthday. The ambience is really nice and waiter/waitress were very attentive. food was really delicious. Try pizookie and BJ's signature deep dish pizza.
Morgan L.,San Jose  CA,2,12,34,11/7/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,This BJs has now become my late night  just got off of work  go to place for drinks and dinner. Especially coming here as late as I do (usually between 11pm-midnight)  I always sit in the bar area  preferably at the bar. Previously here  and at other BJs locations  I've gotten terrible service sitting in the bar area. But at this location  the bartender that's always here Michael  he's ALWAYS on point. Very quick service  even remembers what it is that I generally order. He never appears to be stressed or under pressure  just keeps it cool and control of his area. Always appreciate to get him as a server/bartender. Mojitos and tortilla soup are a must.
Rebecca P.,Milpitas  CA,178,104,88,4/28/2014,4.0,I came here definitely expecting horrible service after reading all the previous reviews. I got here around 4:45pm on a Monday evening & we got greeted right away. The wait time before getting seated was less than 2 minutes. Our waitress of the evening was Stacy & she was super friendly. She made suggestions & checked up on us frequently. Appetizer: Spinach & artichoke dip. Can't really go wrong with that. My dinner: Cajun Pasta. Chicken was okay. Toast was okay. The pasta itself was pretty good & not as dry as other Cajun pasta I've had. Maybe we came on a good day or got lucky with the right waitress. I wouldn't mind coming back to this location  especially when I can walk off the food at Target & do some damage.
Brooke J.,Lake in the Hills  IL,0,1,,5/22/2016,4.0,Just ate there with my girlfriend and Isaiah made a vegetarian feel at home  I never know what I can substitute at restaurants but Isaiah made sure I got a hardy amount of vegtables... Overall it was a good experience... I'm glad they have vegetarian staff.
GJ W.,San Jose  CA,0,42,,10/24/2016,1.0,Really bad experience at BJs on Coleman- First  they were out of silverware and told us only after they brought out food!!!! Asked us to wait while they cleaned some forks which took seven minutes as the food cooled. Second  my entree salad was limp  with brown lettuce  and warm. Yuck. Whole family came down with stomach nausea the next day--don't know if it is related but certainly wonder.
Stephanie D.,Atherton  CA,575,774,301,5/14/2014,5.0,Things weren't 100% perfect last night but so close that I'm giving 5 stars. I came with 40+ women. Huge  loud  demanding  group. It can be overwhelming. We had several tables in the back and a couple of servers ready to take us on. We received our water and drinks quickly and our servers were so nice. The food took a while.. a long while.. but  being generous  I figure that trying to feed this many people different plates at different times can be a big challenge! I was starving. positively starving. I ordered the stuffed mushrooms (omg the best) and the mini bruschetta (a new one for me). The mushrooms came quickly enough and they were awesome! My other dish seemed to have gotten lost in the shuffle and our server (I wish I had remembered his name!) apologized and comped it for me  it came about 10 minutes later. Everything tasted awesome  everyone around me was happy and the servers were kind enough to bring condiments and extra little things for everyone. The reason that this review is 5 stars is because our servers did something absolutely magical. He allowed each of us to pay separately. 40 different credit cards. 40 different meals. OMG. This is unheard of. With only one little mistake we were all able to pay separately. THE DREAM! If I didn't love this place before  I certainly do now.
Bernie C.,Santa Clara  CA,42,83,32,5/11/2015,1.0,We are literally still waiting at this restaurant for someone  anyone to ask us if we need anything. It NEVER fails that our service at this location is ALWAYS so HORRIBLE  just like their food. We've been to this one about 4-5 times now and it keeps going down. Such a shame for a big chain. It takes forever to get our food  it takes even longer to get condiments  and don't even bother for a refill. My son literally bobbed his head and fell asleep waiting for a waiter to come so we can ask for our check. It's Monday night  so it's not that busy and we came after the basketball game ended. There's tons of empty tables all around. Such a disappointment! I will only come back for the pizookies! Their food here tastes like gourmet microwaveable dinner. Not worth it. Pizza is hard  stale and flavorless. Baked potato was microwaved and undercooked. Steak was tough  dry and sucks for whoever has to clean the wad of steak gum my son had to spit out. Thin cut fries were mediocre. Cajun pasta tasted like cafeteria food. If anything  El Camino hospital smacks on their food here. We tried a few other dishes here but it's nothing special because I can't remember anything good about it. Anyway  spend your money elsewhere. The Cupertino location is much better.
Binh L.,San Jose  CA,168,36,16,3/9/2015,3.0,Came in a few nights ago for my birthday dinner with a group of 15 people. I had no idea this place had reservations otherwise I would've called in advance (no  they don't take reservations on the day of). I thought the wait time for a group that big was going to be at least 1.5+ wait but it was only an hour  which in my opinion wasn't that bad. Our server was extremely helpful and very patient in waiting for everyone to place their order.I was getting tired of eating pasta so I decided to order the California Club Sandwich?.. anyways  I wasn't all that great. The chicken was really dry and I felt like the bread had a lot of grease on it. Of course for dessert I had to order the pizookie  I got the chocolate chip cookie w/ vanilla ice cream and oh man! Too much sweetness going on  I could only finish half. Overall  the food here is alright.
Magee W.,Mountain View  CA,0,2,,12/1/2016,2.0,Came here last nite at about 7:30  found a seat at the bar booth. It was pretty busy for a Wednesday nite. No one came over for 10 minutes till we flagged someone. Our waitress said she be back to get our drink order which was another 10 minutes. We order a bottle of wine  after 15 minutes went by we flagged her down and she said they had to go to the back and get the bottle and she would be right back. 15 minutes later after we asked her again she came back with 4 wine glasses and the bottle uncorked on top of the bottle and dropped it off without a word or pouring it into our glasses. She may have been busy but an apology would have gone a long way for the wait. Our appetizer had come out before the wine and were almost done with it. The cheese on the burger was crispy  the fries warm and pizza was just ok. I think BJ's need more help staff help. I would have been understanding if she would have had a better attitude. I've been here before but never have experienced service & food this bad.
Ryan H.,Orangevale  CA,3,10,,9/1/2015,2.0,Good Food  Horrid service  long wait times for food. Maybe they were upset that our 4 top ordered the unlimited soup and salad  but if that's the case  don't offer it!!Both times the servers had attitude.... Maybe I'll return but plan to spend a long time here....
Rubi D.,San Jose  CA,38,77,59,5/25/2015,5.0,Best bj I have been to in awhile! I have been to many in Sacramento. I came to this one for the Warriors and rockets game. Although busy  the manager took my order right after she personally sat us down. I didn't know she was the manager until later. This restaurant is ran with great customer service values!
Simeon S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,6,1,4/15/2016,1.0,We just wanted a couple drinks for happy hour. While waiting for our table  I overheard a hostess comment on how they were over staffed. We sat our table for 10 minutes with no greeting from our waiter. I got up and interrupted a manger having a brief meeting with the team of hostesses. They still didn't locate our waiter.We finally walked out after watching 3 tables who were seated after us be greeted by their waiter.The team of hostesses and the manager watched us walk out and no one said good bye or questioned it.Amazing how they neglected us while being over staffed.
Wilson N.,Mountain View  CA,0,23,2,3/29/2016,1.0,This review/rating is for this location only. Came here after a Sharks game for late night happy hour apps. Unfortunately  they must not know that people may do that after Sharks game and didn't staff accordingly. There was only 1 server for the entire bar area while there were 4/5 servers in the dining area which was sparse. We sat for about 15 mins before being greeted and was only able to order drinks. When we wanted to order food at the same time  we were told to wait because she was busy and had to come back. The server ended up taking orders for the middle tables at the bar but never came back to us. Tables even got their drinks that sat after us. At this point  it was about half an hour without any drinks and no check up. Another server eventually brought out waters but at that point  we were ready to leave. Management should be aware of situations like this and jump in to help out. This experience leaves a bad taste in my mouth and I'm not sure if I would come back to this location.
Susan A.,Los Angeles  CA,227,67,16,1/31/2016,5.0,This review is SOLELY based off of the service my friends and I received on Friday  January 29th. In short: there were some extremely rude inconsiderate customers before us who horribly affected our plans  and the management at BJ's did what they could to make up for it.I had reservations for my birthday at BJ's at 9pm  I was originally coming in with a group of twenty people. The way reservations work is that you're only allowed to stay two hours max. Unfortunately  the rude inconsiderate group before us decided to break that rule. My friends and I ended up getting seated at 9:50 pm because of those awful people. Because of this  most of my friends couldn't make it to that event  and I don't blame them  because just like me  they work 45-65 hours a week  and plus  we have school. What made my case even more upsetting was that I was also sick. To add insult to injury  those inconsiderate rude customers walked out laughing  and one of them just gave me a card that was only 20% off as her way of apologizing  and it was set to expire in two days. Unbelievable.By the time we got seated  I asked the hostess for some exemptions. The manager ended up coming out  and instead of granting the small requests I asked for  he gave my little remaining group and I an offer we couldn't refuse to make up for the horrible guests before us. Our server was also just as great.With that said  I will most definitely come to this establishment again. You can't always expect to be lucky thinking you'll have good guests who will be considerate of others  but you can at least try to make the awful situation less problematic  and that's what the manager  server  and hostess at this BJ's did.
Raymond G.,Salinas  CA,111,4,7,5/1/2016,1.0,Service was not good server was to busy took for ever to Bring Us Food Then Made Mistake On My Daughter By Time They fixed It Everyone At Table Had Fins he'd There food!
Teddy G.,San Jose  CA,118,94,82,1/14/2015,4.0,Had a great time here! Our server rocked! My buddy and I tried the beer sampler which is an awesome option! The signature pizza was amazing. That poor pizza never stood a chance once it hit our plates!!!! A great place to go to with friends. It has a casual yet nice atmosphere to it.
Danyelle P.,San Jose  CA,166,165,72,1/24/2016,1.0,So disappointed in the service here. I've had birthday's ruined for family members and rude service from waitresses and it seems to always happen at this location. It even gets to the point where I had to ask a manager to switch out the waitress taking care of my table and he didnt so I had to call the BJ's corporation to make a formal complaint. So over this place. I will never come back to this location.
Shannon C.,Carlsbad  CA,249,471,762,1/4/2014,4.0,HIGHLIGHT: Beer selectionI've dined at plenty of other BJ's locations  so I'm familiar with their fairly extensive menu. I always enjoy a pint of their Nutty Brunette and a pizookie if there's room in my belly! This time we ordered their mini pizookie trio (peanut butter  chocolate chunk  and red velvet). The chocolate chunk is the best  in my opinion  and going forward I will not order any other flavors. Unless of course we get the giant cookie that feeds a small village! Other meals enjoyed at our last trip: their ribs were excellent  the black n blue flat bread pizza was okay  the buffalo chicken tenders were really good  and my brother liked their Snake Bite (guiness and apple cider). The location is new and our server Tim was really new  but he was super friendly and tried really hard to make sure we were happy. I can't say anything bad about his service because he was running multiple tables  so I know he was busy. As long as he keeps up his can-do attitude  in a couple months he'll be the perfect server!We dined on a Friday night around 8pm and there was still an hour wait! Instead  we opted to sit outside (read: cold). Luckily I was able to sit directly under one of their heat lamps because San Diego has thinned my skin. The rest of my family was fine not being directly under the lamp  and we enjoyed eating outside. There was more room all around.
Stephanie K.,Salinas  CA,3,2,25,4/7/2016,4.0,I went out to lunch with my mom and we both ordered . . . it's called the Ahi salad. Everything in the salad is good  however be careful to not eat too much wasabi that is on the side. We were able to sit down without the host taking us to our table. We sat in a booth closer to the bar
Kevin C.,Gilbert  AZ,10,7,,11/29/2015,4.0,Pizza was very good. Salmon was too. Sample beers was cool  so you could see which you like best. Best part was the service. Elijah was a great server. I rarely tip 25%  but I did today. Thanks Elijah.P.s. Bloody Marys were delicious.
Regina A.,Santa Clara  CA,12,94,862,5/5/2014,4.0,Went to this place on sunday night. The host is really nice and we don't have to wait to get our table. We order :Full baby back ribs ( sweet and tender)Cajun pasta (chicken is very tender)And Ghirardelli pizookie (too chocolaty i recommend the original pizookie instead of this one)The server is really fast and the food is satisfying. I don't know why this place has bad overall review but me and my boyfriend really satisfy dining in this restaurant.
Jo D.,San Jose  CA,150,190,166,12/9/2014,2.0,"The setting here is just like the rest of the cool BJ\'s Breweries. Love the booths  lighting  artwork  TV\'s  etc.. but the service here is horrible. I came for my work holiday party and walked in to the hostess area where I find 5 staff members standing around chatting amongst each other. One of them was mingling with her friend/guests and the others ignored me. I stood there for a few minutes pretty conscious of the poor customer service already. A few more minutes later a hostess looked right at me and the phone rang. She picked it up instead of acknowledging me. I finally asserted myself to the others and loudly asked  ""Which way is the private party?"" And only one of them pointed me the right direction  and I know damn well the rest of them heard me. Ruuuu!"
Kristen P.,San Jose  CA,0,2,,10/20/2016,1.0,"We got there a little before the lunch rush and ordered 3 meals. 45 minutes after we ordered we asked the server to ask the kitchen to just put it in to-go boxes  we couldn\'t wait around much longer. 50+ minutes later the server comes back with the wrong order. At this point it had been so long we didn\'t have time for the kitchen to correct the food let alone the time for the server to correct the bill. I understand that the kitchen and server were very busy but not once did we get an apology. All we got was ""oh  I\'ll check on your food""."
Casey H.,Vacaville  CA,11,57,7,3/5/2016,2.0,Wasnt horrible  service was slow  went home with a tummy ache after having the lunch special of chicken club/ceasar salad. Wouldnt go back  just ended up that the boss wanted to go there cause he didnt know what he wanted and the menu is huge...I'm a fan of small menu's and do one thing right  not everything mediocre.
Lina H.,Newark  CA,680,633,692,10/29/2013,5.0,Not bad at all despite the negative reviews up to now. I think you have to give them a chance with all the new servers going around. There was no wait which is usually not the case for a BJs. We got seated at an awesome booth right across from the bar with a perfect view of the big screen TV. The server and a shadow server promptly took our orders. We did have to wait quite a bit for our food but our beers came out real quick so we weren't complaining. Only concern was that we only get an hour for lunch so we might had to take the food to go. Our food came out and it was great. Overall good experience  it is brand spanking new and everything is in tip top shape so no complaints about anything else. I'll come on by before a Sharks game. ;)
Thuy H.,San Jose  CA,227,223,221,10/11/2013,3.0,Decided to do hh yesterday from 5p-7p yesterday and it was ok.....It wasn't too busy since this location has only been opened for less than a month but it's like any other average BJ's.Tips:On Thursdays selected beers are $3.50 instead of $4.Even though the bar area is ONLY for happy hour crowd  if you get the manager's approval  you can have hh prices at the tables (not too much food selection for hh and there won't be a menu at the tables either for what's on hh).Shots are like $10 so just get two $5 mojitos instead or 3 beers.If you're looking to watch the game  make sure you sit at a table that's in SIGHT of a TV.ALWAYS end your night with a pazookie.Parking is unlimited since you can park in the Target lot.Service is good and always a great spot for a large crowd :)
Blake L.,San Jose  CA,336,13,8,6/24/2014,4.0,Oh man  this place was amazing.I'll admit the wait time was only a little slow  and the prices were a little high  and it was a little dark  but all of those little things  among others  do not do much harm to the overall experience. The food  although a bit overpriced  was very good  although not quite filling. The service is amazing. They are so nice and willing to change orders once  twice  or (in my case) three times. I am very pleased with this restaurant  but am only giving it four stars because the minor details that were mentioned earlier should not go amiss. Other than that  I would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a nice  sit-down place to eat and unwind.
Djoe p.,Honolulu  HI,50,24,74,11/10/2013,3.0,Order a drink when you sit down because its going to be awhile before you get your food. We came in on a Sunday night to watch a football game and ordered off their happy hour menu. We sat for over an hour while we waited for our food. So we were glad we had drinks to keep our hunger at bay. The waitstaff were nice  the food overall pretty good except for the boneless wings (skip it) but service was very slow. P.S. if you get the waitstaff's attention order everything you need including water because they tend not to check up on the tables very often.
Del E.,Saratoga  CA,2,29,21,11/28/2015,2.0,The 2.5 rating is well deserved. We had really bad service. Not sure why management at this location can't get their act together. Our food came in two different waves. Two people got their food first and they were completely done and waiting for the rest of us to get our food. Terrible. Just bad. Total wait after ordering our food was one hour fifteen minutes. Shameful.
Jan P.,San Jose  CA,302,859,1692,9/23/2013,4.0,We came today for the soft opening which provided training opportunities for the new employees. In addition  the food was free (though via a variety of select menus) and 100% of the booze benefited the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. All the employees were extremely friendly and particularly ebullient. The restaurant itself is nestled at the corner of Coleman Ave and Autumn St  by Panera. My first impression was that it was nice and clean with a very open layout -- though isn't as large as some other BJ's. Parking might be an issue with overflow into Target's parking. My group was seated at the bar and though one gentleman at the bar appeared to be our main server  some number of employees walking around through out the restaurant checked in on us and provided requested items (extra plates  utensils...). At one point of us waiting  a young lady brought a pork chop to us however we did not order one and it was quickly shuttled away. Anyhow  we started with BJ's signature berry cider which was AH-mazing -- new favorite drink over Wyder's (but sadly  not for home purchase). We then went into our main entrees: the standard deep dish pizza was solid  my jalapeno burger with chipotle mayo was delicious  and the chicken marsala was okay (though my coworker really enjoyed it). For dessert  we tried the beignets for the first time and O-M-G  with a mound of vanilla ice-cream  whipped cream  and strawberries  it tasted just like funnel cake from a fair. Delicious and great dessert alternative to the pizookie (though ours was slightly raw at the center).Overall we had a really fun experience. Great  convenient location  solid food for a BJ's  and friendly  helpful staff. Perfect for happy hour!One qualm? The front door! A revolving door  really? I could do without (granted a single regular door flanks each side of the revolving one).
Ali A.,Fremont  CA,137,44,10,12/6/2014,1.0,Apparently when you call ahead of time to put your name on wait list  you're not on wait list.. Your name is on wait list when you walk in..Their phone app does allow you to put your name on wait lists.. And I did like tons of times in the past where I called in to put our name on guest list..The front receptionist was rude and had attitude.
Michelle S.,Cupertino  CA,763,346,982,10/19/2015,4.0,This specific BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse is located in a gorgeous shopping plaza of San Jose and the exterior is absolutely beautiful. Walking into the restaurant  the hostess kindly led me in the direction to my party of four. Our waitress was very funny and nice  though it was hard to fetch her at times because the restaurant is just so gosh darn big. However  she was definitely accommodating and always fulfilled our requests in a timely manner - whether it be refilling our coffees or getting us extra sauce. As a passionate Avocado Eggrolls lover  I shamelessly ordered this appetizer at 10AM while the rest of my friends ordered normal brunch entrees. As always  I was satisfied with my appetizer and it definitely filled me up past lunchtime. If you come to BJ's in the morning  I would actually suggest ordering the brunch entrees  as they are actually really reasonably priced and the portions are HUGE! Also  the waitress brought my friend a Triple Chocolate birthday pizookie on the house at the end of our meal. Great first experience at this BJ's and I wouldn't mind coming back again in the near future :)
Dmitriy S.,Santa Clara  CA,293,905,2950,10/10/2013,3.0,"I tend to stay away from places like BJ\'s  Applebee\'s  Chili\'s  etc when there\'s so many better options in one of the most diverse melting pots in the world. However  when Kathleen W. invited me for happy hour at the end of a tumultuous week  how could I say no?We came when this BJ\'s had only been open for a week. It was already packed with customers  had a line out the door  and is so huge that it took me a bit of walking to find my friends. Here\'s how Happy Hour works. Mon-Fri 3pm-7pm  Sun-Thurs 10pm-Close: - $4 beers  call drinks  and simple appetizers- $5 mojitos  martinis  and more sophisticated appetizers- $6 wine and the fanciest appetizersI started off with their Oktoberfest (seasonal) beer  which is a toasty lager. Very smooth  crisp and refreshing. Later in the night  I got a Nutty Brewnette. A bit too nutty and strong for my taste  but still quite decent. The quality of their beer surprised me.Appetizers:- Avacado Egg Rolls ($6): Avacado  cream cheese  sun-dried tomatoes  red onions  cilantro  pine nuts  and spices in wonton wrapping. The ones we were served pretty much just had avocado and omitted most of the items listed above. It was bland  but fresh. Wouldn\'t recommend.- California Club Flatbread ($4): Chicken  bacon  tomatoes  mozzarella  garlic aioli and avocado on a flatbread. Pretty tasty with a good amount of chicken. Not too overbaked  and the garlic aioli adds a nice flavor you usually don\'t expect on a pizza. - Mini Vegetarian/Buffalo Chicken Deep Dish Pizzas ($6): Your typical veggie deep dish pizza  with the buffalo one being the same but with chicken. It\'s actually not really ""deep dish "" in the sense that the extra height is taken up by the dough  not by more ingredients. Pretty decent but nothing to rave about. - Chicken Lettuce Wrap ($6): Diced chicken breast  mushroom  water chestnuts  veggies and crispy wontons served with lettuce cups and sauces. The chicken was very flavorful and juicy. The lettuce was crisp and fresh. When combined with the sesame soy sauce  it was a fantastic flavor concoction. Definitely recommend. This was all finished off with the much needed Pizookie Trio. Not sure which pizookies we got  but they all lived up to the hype. A perfect way to pig out one last time during the evening. Service is very slow  but that\'s understandable considering they\'re new and are packed during happy hour. Once they get on their feet  they\'ll probably hire more wait staff. My friend\'s beer took half an hour to arrive and they kept making excuses. Eventually  he just got it for free  which was nice of them  but expected from us. Overall  a great place for happy hour  but I wouldn\'t come here for a full meal. That\'s just personal preference."
Matthew M.,San Jose  CA,1,6,,9/10/2016,5.0,A great experience all around. Gabby waited on our table and her cheerful disposition make for a very pleasurable dining experience. We had the fish and chips  which I asked to have cooked extra crispy. I have to admit it was the some of the best fish n chips I've ever had! The Brussel sprouts were delicious too. Thanks again Gabby for making our dining experience so memorable
Briana S.,Fremont  CA,0,4,2,4/24/2016,2.0,I'm just so turned off by the customer service here. I probably won't be back by choice. We basically had to hunt down our waiter for refills. Our food took forever to arrive and once it did  we had to hunt our waiter down for utensils as well. The food tasted great  the service just sucked. Some people just aren't good at multitasking I guess.
Anna K.,Los Altos  CA,1,4,2,2/22/2015,2.0,Their pulled pork needs a lot of work! Their wages are plain ... not something I'll try againTheir calamari was ok... Service was slow n not as attentive as I'd like
Trish S.,San Jose  CA,31,377,192,10/2/2013,4.0,Decor: ****Friendly Staff: ****Promptness: ****Flavor of the food:***Drink selection:****1st time here & my family enjoyed the atmosphere. Lots of staff  so you never have to hunt anyone down for refills. Big bonus: My son has food allergies & our server gave us a Food & Allergy Menu. Awesome!! The only thing that I wasn't impressed was their burger. Not very tasty or juicy- Chili's is much better.
Dale D.,San Jose  CA,0,125,7,7/19/2015,3.0,Had the pumbpkin ale.  Good stuff. HH food was ok. Service was adequate. I did not like the avacado egg roles but I set my self up for a ritch dish and got it. Service was very corporate withch = the same fake monotone stuff. All in all I did not have a bad experience but I did not have a Grat experience.Will i be back...... Na
Cory E.,Alpine  UT,39,27,21,6/1/2015,3.0,I love that they offer a gluten free menu. The gluten free crust on their pizzas tastes great. I personally like the chicken bacon ranch pizza. For dessert the gluten free pizookie is worth the calories. Get it with vanilla ice cream.
Dominique R.,San Jose  CA,92,13,8,1/18/2015,2.0,"My boyfriend and I came on a Friday night around 6:30-7ish expecting a long wait but surprisingly we were seated in less than 15 minutes which was cool! Pretty crowded but like I said we expected that due to the popularity and just because it was a Friday. The bathrooms are nice haha.It was both of our first times here  we heard good things but honestly the food was just okay. Don\'t get me wrong it wasn\'t extremely bad! It just wasn\'t as great as people put it out to be. We ordered some carne asada fries as an appetizer  which we asked to have first since our server offered  but we had to ask where they were AFTER all the rest of our food came. They were okay  the chile verde slightly over powered everything and there was just a large chunk or two of meat put on the side. I guess that\'s just how they make it? Eh  it wasn\'t so appealing. The ahi poke was alright. The corn fritters were really good at first but the last one I had wasn\'t cooked through all the way so the middle was a ball of batter and I just couldn\'t finish the rest of it after discovering that. Also  when I tried to ask our server what corn fritters were since I\'ve never tried them  she said ""Well  if you just read the description it says it right there."" Yes... I read it... It described what\'s IN it  but I just wanted some clarification since I am not exactly a corn fritter expert.. Maybe it was just me over thinking her comment  BUT I was slightly offended. Lol."
Kathi L.,San Jose  CA,6,5,,9/24/2016,2.0,This was our first time here. Didn't have to wait for a table  but it went downhill from there. There was a big sticky splotch on the table. I ordered the summer peach drink  which the waiter described at sweet and tasty. Since it was listed on the menu caffeine free  I ordered it. When it arrived it tasted like unsweetened tea with peach syrup. Asked the waiter and he confirmed that was what is was. I told him I couldn't have caffeine so he replaced it with something else. The watermelon feta salad is described as being made with arugula  but when it arrived  it was made with spring mix lettuce instead. And  by the way  a fork is useful for eating a salad  but the server didn't seem to think that. Then the artichoke spinach dip arrived. Heated so long it was burned to a crisp around the edges. Yummy. The wings were ok and the fish and chips were good. With so many places to choose from  why would I decide to go back here for a mediocre experience.
Estyn A.,San Jose  CA,10,11,95,10/20/2014,1.0,"We love BJs  but the service and the food here are poor reps of this chain. We tried it out because it\'s close to home  but  gotta say... terrible. Worst service we experienced in a while. When we walked in  the host did not acknowledge us even though it didn\'t look too busy on Monday night  and we were surprised because of the grand entrance through the revolving door. No smile  takes us to our seat  a lone table in the center of an aisle of booths  most if which were filled. We felt a lil awkward  like being on stage  so we ask our server to move to a booth right next to the table  still in her section. No prob. Our server took our order  and that\'s the last time she talked to us the rest of the night. By the end  I forgot her name and what her voice sounded like. We tried flagging her down for water  small plates  questions on the menu  and it was so bizarre... She made eye contact  went to another table  and didn\'t revisit us or check up on us  ask us how our food was. After we lost faith in her  we tried flagging down other servers who walked by  but we might as well tried flagging down a train with no brakes. It was like... ""Zooommmm  not my problem."" It felt bad being ignored and generally not acknowledged as guests and paying customers. Foodwise  we got the great white pizza  cobb salad  avocado eggrolls  poke appetizer  fried artichoke small plate. The pizza was soggy  salad was mostly overdressed lettuce and no toppings  artichoke was mostly dense fried bread  and in the poke salad there was very little fish. When we were almost done  our server went on lunch. We hoped that the new server would be more attentive  but NOPE. By the time we tried flagging someone down for the check  looking for our server  we felt like brats  saying ""pay attention to us!"" We definitely expect better service at BJs. After a while  we found our server flirting with the guy helping her run food... Very unprofessional. Thanks Coleman BJs  but no more."
Patty A.,San Jose  CA,7,22,,9/2/2016,5.0,My boyfriend and I have been there a few times. We loved out waitress Alicia. She goes above and beyond to make our eating experience awesome- ie -put the college basketball on for my fanatic boyfriend. She knows the menu well and is able to make suggestions. We will be going back for the yummy food and for the great service :)
P D.,San Jose  CA,0,22,,10/11/2016,1.0,HORRIBLE SERVICE! They are very slow in seating people  taking orders and delivering the food. Their staff is not friendly. We ended getting our food very late and one of the members in our party needed to take medicine and eat right away. We had our party member take the medicine after the waitress told us the food will be here in 30 minutes. It did not come until an hour later. Over it took us 3+ hours to sit  eat and leave. I've never gone back since and don't think I'll ever go back. I told my cousins and family members to avoid this place and they haven't gone since.
Daniela Q.,San Jose  CA,0,9,,8/28/2016,5.0,Great server Kilvy C I been coming here ever since this location opened the servers that usually help me are slow and don't check if I need anything else  with Kilvy was the opposite he was fast friendly and made sure everyone in my party was satisfied definitely coming back and requesting him as my server
Lety G.,San Jose  CA,3,4,,10/23/2015,1.0,Horrendous service. Got seated and weren't acknowledge for a good 20 mins. All of the food my party ordered was cold upon its arrival to our table. Had to ask for utensils on 3 different occasions. One of our entrees didn't arrive until everyone was almost done with their meals. Also a beer that was ordered in the very beginning wasn't brought out until right before the check was brought out. On top of all this waited 45 mins for the server to process our payment because apparently paying with 3 cards and cash is incredibly difficult. Never coming here again.
Mike M.,Santa Clara  CA,20,41,10,10/31/2014,1.0,"Let\'s start at the beginning...Appetizer: half and half boneless wings. Took a while for appetizers to show. When they showed up  only 5 pieces were on the plate--the other half of the plate was empty  but had remnants of sauce of pieces that WERE there. Not sure what that was about.Wife\'s entree: she ordered the kale and brussels sprouts salad with salmon. It came with no brussels sprouts whatsoever  and what looked like arugula instead of kale. It also had blueberries  which was not specified in the menu description.My entree: I ordered the salmon dinner. It was fine  until I discovered that one of the lemon wedges looked like it had been chewed upon already--very unappetizing. Also  it was hidden under the salmon  as if they were trying to hide it.I asked for the manager at that point. The server walked away to get the manager. We waited quite a while  and the kitchen manager came out to talk to us. Instead of apologies  he tried to explain that they use baby kale. It did not look like baby kale. Moreover  the salad was completely devoid of brussels sprouts. He went away to get my wife a bowl of Brussels sprouts and some lemon wedges for me. Instead of making us feel good about the outcome  he came across as arrogant and condescending  and we almost felt ashamed--but we were too upset to feel ashamed. The server came back out  and noticed our dissatisfaction. She went back to look for the manager. After a long while (again)  the manager came out to talk to us. I showed her the lemon wedge -instead of apologies  she started with ""let me teach you something about how lemons are cut in our kitchen..."" She went on about some mechanical cutter that automatically cuts lemons. My wife was displeased  but did not say anything at that point. I didn\'t buy the manager\'s story either. Most lemons I know are cut by hand with a knife. There\'s no process that I know of where lemons would be cut to look like they had small bites taken out of them. Again  no apologies. She was just as arrogant and condescending as the kitchen manager. We were done with the bullshitting experience.They took the boneless wings off of the bill  but we still ended up paying roughly $50 for a dinner experience that was subpar and disappointing. I was expecting a further discount for the unappetizingly lousy presentation  the extraordinarily long wait for our meals  the wrong dish being served to my wife  and for the overall treatment from both managers--the bullshitting and the arrogance. I will never eat at a BJ\'s ever again. You see this kind of nightmare on Gordon Ramsey\'s show--I never thought restaurants could truly be this bad. On the plus side  the server was quick--especially in processing my wife\'s debit card. At least that was fast."
Celeste D.,San Jose  CA,39,5,,2/21/2016,2.0,Well  when you finally get the food it's pretty standard. What can I say? I waited an hour for a random burger. It was edible. The server  when one finally showed after about 30 minutes  was nice. He just couldn't bring us any food because the kitchen doesn't seem to be very quick on the draw in that department. I drank beer. House IPA. Also unremarkable. Then ordered another because there was still no food. The kids showed exponential self control in not misbehaving. Don't eat here. Not if you're hungry or value your time.
Vivian L.,San Jose  CA,17,17,11,9/12/2014,1.0,"Food was fine  but don\'t even get me started about the service. It was self seating so we found a table and sat. A man comes over and tells us that our server was a female  but a male show up as our server without explaining why it was not the female instead. Most of the time if the original server the table assign was going to be change the new server who comes will say something like oh ""so and so is going on a lunch break and I\'ll be taking his or her place"" but apparently that did not happen. So fine no big deal. Our male server name was FRANK. He swing by took our order and some other guy came to deliver the food. We ate our food and was pretty much done. Frank comes back to the table and ask if we wanted dessert and we asked to give us a sec because we wanted to get a quick general consensus on whether we wanted to order or not. Well apparently Frank did not hear and said ""I\'ll come back"" because it was too much to ask to wait for 30 seconds. So there Frank goes off and the general consensus of our table was no dessert. We wanted to get the check instead and call it a night since it was getting pretty late. We sat there for five minutes and see Frank no where in sight. Then after a few more minutes we still don\'t see Frank coming back to our table  so we ask another female server who walk pass by for the check. So apparently she tries to go around looking for Frank to tell him our table wants the check. Cuz apparently she can\'t go to the computer and punch in our table number to print the check since the computer was like right next to her. Fine..at this point we are already fed up with the speed of the service. Frank then finally comes back with the check and goes missing again. We waited another five minute or so for him to swing back around  but yet still not sign of Frank. So one of use walk up to the front to ring up the check  but apparently they don\'t ring up the check. The people up at the front desk handled the check to another server who apparently also can\'t ring up the check goes on a major exploration to find Frank. Well of course by now reading this long we review you can all conclude that our server Frank goes ""missing"" a lot. So it took about another good five minutes for that server to find Frank. Our table at this point is very very upset at the speed of service. Come on how long does it take to ring up a check. It took almost as long for our food to come out from the kitchen. YES it was that ridiculous. After at least a good 10 minute wait FRANK finally shows up with the check already ring up. AND GUESS WHAT??!! Frank with a very nasty attitude and voice told us ""Don\'t hand the other server the check cuz they have to go around to find me"" WELL Excuse me sir you were no where to be seen and we been waiting quite some time already. So friendly I reply back saying ""You were not around and we waited a long time"" Typically at this point you would expect the server to say ""Oh Im sorry to have kept you waiting."" But no FRANK here decided to back talk his customer saying ""Um NO I was right there at the table next to you"". Let me make it straight by the time Frank claiming himself to be at the table next to us we had already pass the check to the front desk long ago already. Last time I check server should be respectful to their customer.I am paying money for the food and service and this is how you treat your customer are you for real. Common courtesy that customer is to be respected and value when they enter your restaurant because they are the guest at your place. We will not be returning to this BJ location for its service is beyond disappointing and I hope future customer who goes does not have to experience a server like FRANK. One more thing I still don\'t understand is why does every table need to only be designated one server. Yes I get that a server is in charge of certain tables  but why does it have to be split so clearly. This table is my customer and if they have some small problem like need plate or ring up check its none of my business since Im not the assign server for that table. Don\'t server works as a team yes you are assign a certain area table whatever  but why can\'t you help each other out since you are on the ""same team"" (same restaurant). Anyway this point is more a personal opinion I guess. I seen far more similar restaurant like BJ and their servers really know how to work as a team even if they were assign to tables meaning ring up check for their customer. If you like to have good service I say save yourself the trouble and go to another BJ location."
Alex F.,Palo Alto  CA,176,8,1,11/11/2015,2.0,Unless they were severely understaffed  which looking at the number of workers walking around was not the case  but took us well over 30 min to get our drink order in. Then our entrees arrived before our appetizers. Spinach artichoke dip isn't really a dessert but ok. I guess it was nice that the waiter didn't take our $5 tip  it was pretty much charity anyways. I would've said this was a fluke  but judging by the other reviews  pretty spot on. If your not in the mood for a pazookie then they're are much better options in the area.
Felicia S.,Santa Clara  CA,38,3,,9/17/2014,2.0,First off let me say I love bjs. And have been to many different locations; I love the variety of food as well as fast and speedy service. This is my first time and this location and our waitress SABRINA WAS HORRIBLE! I am in the restaurant business and that was the WORSE SERVICE I HAVE HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! we waited 10 min to be greeted  then another 10 min to get waters. She only checked on us once the whole hour and half we were there. SABRINA WAS ONLY WITH ONE TABLE THE WHOLE ENTIRE TIME BECAUSE THERE WERE YOUNGER MEN AT THAT TABLE. Also we had to ask other waiters as well busboys to help us multiple times. Never going back to this location again! The food was great as always though! So thank you chefs! 5 stars
Marty M.,San Jose  CA,0,3,1,10/1/2016,1.0,Just ordered their Sriracha Bacon Chicken Mac N' Cheese through Door Dash. There's no bacon  cheese  or Sriracha. I just paid for wet noodles with chicken and broccoli. I've given them a few chances  but their food is so hit or miss....
Laura I.,Los Gatos  CA,0,5,,4/1/2016,5.0,Came here to watch a Warriors game on a crowded Friday night with my boyfriend and wanted to just relax and have a slow dinner to watch as much as we could. Argus was awesome!!! He didn't rush us at all  was super friendly and made it a great experience. I've eaten at a lot of BJs  but this one is by far my favorite!
Christine Y.,Reno  NV,38,27,1,3/9/2016,4.0,Their lunch menu was awesome! Great food for reasonable prices. It was kind of busy with the lunch crowd but we were able to get seated right away. I ordered their half-sandwich and fries with a salad all for less than $9! The California chicken club sandwich was so tender and the bread was seasoned and toasted perfectly. I also enjoyed their shoe-string fries!
Martin N.,San Jose  CA,246,132,103,12/27/2014,4.0,BJ's is usually a hit or miss  but it's more like 3.5 stars for the service and 3.5 for the food. I just want to round up  since I'm nice. I got the 'new' deep dish lasagna  but it was more like ravioli in a deep dish. I'm not complaining  but I thought it was kind of funny. Good overall though! The waitress was really nice  but it took her awhile to give us our waters and come back to take our orders. We had to search for her. At the end of the meal  she kept forgetting to give us a box  even though we asked like 3 times. I always have a good experience at BJs  so there isn't much to complain about. For 3 people we were told that the wait was 20-30 minutes  but it was really 10! Awesome!!!
Allisha A.,Campbell  CA,24,25,,1/29/2016,4.0,I came here for happy hour the other day. Excellent beer selection  and the wings were yummy! The food is decent  but still a little pricey (even with happy hour prices)  but the ambience is fun  especially for bigger groups  and our server was very pleasant. And did I mention the delicious beers on tap?! I like this place a lot!
Spencer C.,Pleasanton  CA,5,28,1,8/27/2014,1.0,"In JJ\'s posting below  she mentions walking out with her bf. I am said bf and I\'ll describe what happened.We take a pager and go into the bar for a 5 min wait. We both ordered beer and in 5 min the buzzer goes off.I take it back to the host section. 2 girls and a guy there. I try to give the buzzer to the guy who\'s not doing squat and he points at the girl in front of him ""She\'ll help you"". After the girl takes my buzzer this same guy grabs two menus and leads me to the booth. Job specialization? He\'s not trained in buzzer handling only menu handling? Ok minor nit.We were both 1/4 of the say through our beers. We scanned the menu  made our choices. They wouldn\'t come by. Beer 1/2 way done. We closed our menus and put it the edge of the table. No one comes  not even to bring water. Beers 3/4 done - my gf stops someone and says ""We haven\'t been helped yet"". Staff person looks confused  says ""OK"" and goes away and doesn\'t come back.Beers now finished. I make the call to walk out. On our way out I told the girl at the hostess station (the non buzzer handler wasn\'t there) that we finished our drinks and no one came by to take our order and we were leaving.Now at this point  a manager should have been called  an offer could have been made - dessert on the house  drink on the house  10% off coupon  SOMETHING to let me know you want my business back. She just looked bewildered and said ""Oh  I\'m so sorry"". I even said ""I\'m not chewing you out  just giving you feedback"". She nodded.I will say the BJ\'s in Dublin is better - not great  but better. As JJ said below  I blame management. Customer service is largely determined by culture and if your manager doesn\'t care (he probably doesn\'t even read these - my single star is not an isolated case) then your employees won\'t care.That night they lost our business to Chili\'s where the food isn\'t as good but they were all over it on service."
Judge C.,Santa Clara  CA,2,33,16,10/30/2015,1.0,Left my makeup bag with work id and house keys among other things. Once I realized this I called them. They put me on hold for a while so I called back. My cute bag was at one of the two person booths near the front. At the second or third booth from the entry way. Not hard to find especially if you work there. They took my number just incase but said it wasn't there. I had called in a time frame where even if someone had sat there my purse would've still been there and unless that person had a huge bag with a zipper there's no way you couldn't see my glittery turquoise and white makeup bag. So I'm quite under the impression one of their employees is a thief and I'm thinking it very well may have been the girl who answered the phone. I also no they don't entirely hire wholesome people. NECER COMING HERE AGAIN
Dean B.,Campbell  CA,14,182,59,1/10/2015,4.0,Great lunch spot! I usually get seated quickly and the service is great. For the lunch crowd they really make sure that you get in and out quickly. The food is pretty good with a small lunch menu  which helps them prepare the food quickly. But unfortunately I have not tried the beer yet  and will have to come back at happy hour.
David P.,San Jose  CA,3,18,29,11/26/2014,1.0,Worse service ever. Food before drinks. 45 minutes waiting for kids pizza. Last time in here. I guess was a big party around. More tips 18%. A/c on cold really cold.
Arika G.,San Jose  CA,30,166,162,9/16/2014,1.0,This review is based on the curb side take out. I have ordered for the curbside take out twice and both times have sucked. Today we placed an order for curbside takeout and mind you placed it 1 hour prior to the pick up time. When arriving  we had to wait 20 more minutes for our food. We didn't order anything fancy  just a few sandwiches  salads and soups. When asked to speak with a manager  we waiting for 5 minutes and no one came out. The only reason we left was due to our strict lunch hour; hence the reason we ordered to go. The food looked sloppy and was not very tasteful. Oh & they forgot my mozzarella tomato salad. Will never order to go from here again. Dine in if anything. Don't think you should have to to get the same food quality but clearly that's what you have to do in order for a decent meal.
Hernandez S.,San Jose  CA,1,6,1,2/5/2016,2.0,Came here on Friday night and I knew it would be busy and I didn't mind the wait  what I did mind was the bad service we received. The food was good but the server was mediocre at best! Towards the end of the meal she rushed is not knowing that we had planned to order another drink and dessert. She came with the check without asking if we wanted anything else and kept hovering around for us to leave. As close as the location is to home I would think again before coming to this location.
Nancy F.,Santa Clara  CA,5,141,21,1/15/2015,2.0,i've had enough of this place. This place is always busy  but usually it's not more than a 15 min wait for 2 during the busiest time of the day. I usually come here on weekdays to take advantage of the tail end of their happy hr (ends 7pm).I came on a Wednesday right before 7. They took my name and gave me a buzzer and said it would be about 15 min. Ok  so we go to the bar to order some drinks at happy hr prices. lemon drop martini and mojito for only $5 each! We wait near the front  and about 20 min go by so we decided to check with the receptionist. turns out they never put my name in. So they said we would be the next party to be seated. I see about 3 groups go  (granted they had 3+ people)  but we still waited another 15 min before we were seated. Unacceptable. We should have just sat in the bar area.When we sat down  it took awhile for the waiter to greet us. Then  she didnt even ask us what we wanted to drink. Instead  she was ready to take our order. Also  we had to ask another waiter for utensils. :/ I ordered the fish and chips  which i felt the batter could have been less heavy. My husband ordered the deep dish lasagna  which really should be renamed ravioli. Both were mediocre.The best part of BJ's is really the pizookie  but that's about it. Otherwise  stay away.
Chris N.,San Jose  CA,0,2,,9/18/2016,2.0,Went for my birthday last night. Made a reservation 5 hours in advance. It took 25 minutes to get seated. Took a hour for just 2 appetizers to come out. Our server (lolly) barely came to our table. Hair was wrapped in my sisters napkin with her utensils. I asked for a side of marinara for my daughter since there was barely any in her spaghetti  took 10 minutes to get it. Her food by then was cold. The burger condaments were just thrown on the side of our burgers. It was very difficult to eat. My family ordered me a pazooki when we got our food so we knew it wouldnt take forever after we ate. We were done with the food. And still no pazooki. Took over 30 min to get. We eventually got up to leave. As were were walking out  they brought it to us. I am never one to complain. I understand busy nights get hectic. But this was just not a good night for them.
Michelle M.,San Jose  CA,2,162,5,10/31/2014,1.0,This location is a disaster. A group of us from work have tried to eat lunch there a few times and there is always a problem. First  you have to stand in the lobby area for five minutes waiting to be seated when the place is empty. (Hint: maybe have your servers start 15 minutes earlier.) Then it might take another 10 minutes to get a drink. (Again  servers are just getting settled.) Then it is impossible to get your appetizers before your entrees. And I am not exaggerating here...we have had this problem so many times that during our last visit  we were really specific with the server about the fact that he might not want to put our entree order in until our apps came  but we still got our entrees before the appetizers...and our sliders came as dessert. And to add insult to injury  somebody's order is always messed up. And when I say a group of us  we are usually 4 to 6 people  so our order should not disrupt the kitchen in any way.Our servers are usually friendly and I suspect the problem is all in the kitchen  but they have been like this for months. Chilis  here we come!
Brian B.,Santa Cruz  CA,368,1302,44,1/1/2014,4.0,I never used to like BJ's  but I've had good experiences at this one. The food has been great on both visits  as has the fact that they've been running a grand opening special of 2 starters  a pizza  and a pizookie for $20. I'm definitely a fan of BJ's now.We had great service one time  and comically terrible service another time. I guess BJ's are supposed to always be like this for service? Doesn't matter  I'll still be headed back.
Patsy C.,San Jose  CA,9,38,2,11/10/2014,2.0,"You know what I dislike? When I come into a restaurant on a relatively slow day and receive inadequate service.Before people start judging and say ""You\'re too unreasonable!""-- I KNOW what quality service should be like  and I\'ve worked in the the restaurant business before as a hostess/server. So I KNOW the struggle. Because of that I am a lot more empathetic to my fellow server brothers and sisters. But honestly  not everyone is cut out for this type of job. When someone doesn\'t greet me  check in with me  or even bring me water after they finally came around to ""check in "" there is something wrong there.Another waiter brought out our drinks  the bus boy brought out our food  and the young woman who was supposed to be ""serving"" us was talking to the same person 5 booths away for us for about 20-30 minutes. When she FINALLY came around  she claimed she ""forgot"" our drinks and apologized  then went BACK to talk to that person. At that point I was ready to not tip her. But the empathetic ex-server in me told me I couldn\'t do a disservice to the bus boy and other server who actually did above and beyond what they were supposed to do. We had another server pick up our check because she never came back to pick it up. When we finally left the restaurant  she was STILL talking to that person.I really hope BJ\'s works on different trainings and workshops for their servers so that they are motivated to do their job well. Or at least have management stress the need for servers to stay professional and aware of their guests  even if management isn\'t on site."
Roslyn A.,San Jose  CA,44,15,2,11/20/2015,2.0,1st time here and the check in was horrible they tell you to call 30 minutes ahead ...I get here and they tell me it's another 20 minutes and they were rude and didn't want to put my name down after they couldn't even find my name.... there was 30 people waiting.
Lyndsay A.,Livermore  CA,2,8,5,1/30/2016,1.0,Absolutely love the food here  but every time I come the service is terribly slow. We waited about 20 min just to get our drink orders in. Wish I could give a better review.
Paulina D.,San Francisco  CA,130,157,10,9/13/2014,1.0,This BJ's is pretty terrible. The food is standard and generic. The service  however  is what sets it apart. It's awful. I was looking at my menu and the waiter put a napkin down right where I was looking. Seriously? I was reading that. Also  I'm starving. I will go hunger rage on your ass. He brought waters out for only half our table. Bro  the chicken wings you brought out were super spicy because you didn't change the sauce. How am I supposed to reduce this fire in my mouth?
Cindy H.,San Francisco  CA,207,19,33,9/14/2014,1.0,I wish I could give no stars. Service was slow and horrible. Food was terrible. The grilled chicken pasta: bland! Came with 4 pieces of broccoli. Spinach article dip: meh  nothing special. Calamari: had a bitter and burnt taste to it. We asked the server if it was burnt and she said no  that's how their calamari is. She offered to take it back but it was pointless. I will not be returning.P.S. I just found a small shard of glass On the side of my shot glass. What. The. Hell.
Michelle K.,Mountain View  CA,9,47,8,9/26/2014,4.0,Pretty good place! Watched the 49ers game here last Sunday. There was a surprising amount of good viewing here! The bar is best with all the TVs  but lots of the regular seating area has good viewing and good sound too! We decided to try something other than the yummy pizzas for a change and I was pleasantly surprised. My boyfriend got the buffalo burger which he said was really good and a bit lighter than a normal burger. I got tomato soup in a sourdough bread bowl. The bowl was surprisingly good with some garlic and herbs on it. There beer and drink selection is pretty good too and decent price during happy hour.
Mike P.,San Jose  CA,124,285,293,12/19/2013,1.0,"THIS IS FOR TAKE-OUT. I understand that the quality of take-out from a chain is usually worse than dining in  especially at an American chain restaurant  so take EVERYTHING I say with a grain of salt. That being said...My first 1-star review! I don\'t usually write a review the day-of unless it\'s truly memorable (or something I should remember)  but since I am currently curled up in a fetal position because BJ\'s destroyed my insides and it hurts to move  I might as well just go for it. We ordered online. I got the black-and-bleu (bacon  bleu cheese  garlic aoili) burger with thin cut fries. My coworkers got the steak  2 pizzas  and a chocolate chip pizookie. Things they could have improved on:1.) Not putting the fries inside the container  so when they arrive they are not soggy from the heat condensation. They could at least put them in a bag or something.  Ditto applies to the burger bun. I don\'t care how much parmesean you fry onto the bun if it\'s still soggy. Soggy buns might be even worse than soggy fries  because you can\'t NOT eat a burger bun. That being said  I ate everything; something I would regret. 2.) Don\'t overcook our steak  please. ""Medium rare"" does not mean charcoal. Admittedly  it was their mistake  because whenever you order steak from non-steakhouses  you should always order a doneness level below what you want  but going from medium rare to inedible-charcoal-covered-meat-nugget is a pretty unacceptable. I know this  because I tried it  and it was like eating a lump of squishy coal. I would later regret this. Do you see where this is going? 3.) Check our order before you send us off on our way. They forgot our pizookie. THE SIGNATURE ITEM OF BJ\'S!  HOW CAN YOU FORGET IT? It\'s even wrapped in gaudy-ass aluminum pie mold!  So we called back  asked for our pizookie  and for a non-rare steak  and  much to my surprise  they agreed to give it back to us! Nice one  management! That being said  when my boss went to pick it up  three ladies were chatting outside  and it took five minutes before they noticed that she was waiting for our replacement order. So... not so great  management.  But the coup de grace is really the fact that I am curled up in a ball  a full five hours after I have eaten  sick as a dog. I don\'t know whether it was the soggy  greasy fries that I ate  the bleu cheese and garlic aoili that simmered in their plastic containers  my foolish sampling of the overcooked charcoalsteak  or all of the above  but I feel like DEATH. Food is supposed to bring me joy; thank you  BJ\'s  for taking that away from me. We did get a kick out of making ""dry BJ\'s"" jokes though. So thanks for that  I guess."
vanessa e.,San Jose  CA,5,25,4,8/17/2014,1.0,As I am sitting waiting for my food going on 40 minutes now  I am wondering to myself why I masochistically keep coming to this location. The service is terrible. It's almost humiliating how they treat you as soon as you walk in the door. Not to mention  oh you want food?! No  they will make you feel like a vagrant begging for scraps when you wonder where your food is after 30 minutes. It's just unbelievable. Also it's awesome how they blamed the wait on the pizzas taking too long but the pizzas weren't even hot when they came out. Great job! Way to treat your customers like idiots.
Sony M.,Milpitas  CA,0,11,,9/1/2015,5.0,Pizookie!! yum yum :) lip smacking dessert is on your way. Perfect place for special occasion like Birthday lunch or dinner. We reserved table one day before and had Pizza and Pizookie for my office colleague birthday lunch. We ordered Chicken barbeque pizza and Hawaiian pizza. The pizzas were delicious. As I am vegetarian I asked waitress to do half n half for no bacon on hawaiian pizza. This place is amazing. Service was good. Our waitress refill the glasses as and when its about to over. After main course  we order regular size pizookie which is good enough for six people.  Also we told waitress that our colleague has birthday today  so she brought small pizookie with burning candle on it  that was so awesome. Special treat for birthday boy ;) !!
Michael H.,San Jose  CA,78,14,,3/23/2016,2.0,"I have been to this location 3 times  and the first two were fine. The 3rd time visit however was awful. I invited a friend to join us and try the dual layer beers  which is usually a great experience. This particular Sunday evening in March  the bartender blended my ""Dark side of the moon"" beer. I asked the waitress to bring it back  since its blended. She came back and told me the bartender said its the right beer and if you order again it will be the same. Nice way to treat customers. Awful experience  they need a different bar tender! That guy is a jerk!"
Ashleigh F.,Watsonville  CA,37,33,2,7/13/2014,1.0,"AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COSTS!!This was my third and LAST visit to this location. The only reason I went to this location was for the free Pizookie Day  as well as the app stating the wait was about 5-10 minutes. Using the ""Order Ahead"" feature for the Pizookie promo was fairly easy. Upon arriving to the restaurant  that\'s where everything started south. The wait was 45 minutes and once we were seated  we were not acknowledged by our waiter for about 10 minutes. There wasn\'t that many people inside  which made me think that they were understaffed. Once he did come over  we explained that we had used the app to order ahead. The copy if the order was on a receipt placed on the table. He looked at it then disappeared for 10-15 minutes to confirm the order was in the kitchen. He walked by but said nothing about the order being prepared which was odd. 30 minutes later  a manager came to our table to apologize for our order not being received! I was really close to hangry  but I stayed calm. 15 minutes later  my man\'s pizza arrived to our table with the manager. He thought that\'s what we ordered  but my pizza was missing! In disbelief the manager asked to see the order confirmation email  and was embarrassed to see that I was correct. After profuse apologies  I received my pizza 15-20 minutes later. Overall it took over an hour for an order! Also when the Pizookie arrived  it was cold :( Despite the manager comping the meal and our waiter being apologetic  this visit was the final straw. I refuse to come back to this location  and I highly suggest that corporate do some training. This location is damaging the reputation of a decent restaurant chain."
Joseph R.,Hayward  CA,455,31,5,12/21/2015,1.0,Just the worst experience I ever had. I've been to a few of them. But this one by far sucked. They kept messing up our order. Then saying oh wait let's see. So my thoughts are please don't come here. Unless you want the worst. Even as a BJ rewards member. All shorts of bad news.
Sarah K.,Silicon Valley  CA,96,205,131,12/8/2013,3.0,Aw  this place actually isn't THAT bad. Granted  I came during happy hour - maybe that's got something to do with it. I ordered the happy hour sliders and like 2 beers. Both beers (i don't remember the names) were recommended by my waitress and they were pretty darn good. AND i didn't know you could have 3 free beer samples at BJs! I've never been told that! So that was a plus. I don't know if a lot of people know about it - the table next to me certainly didn't because after I got my 3  they flagged their waitress to get their 3 lol and they were a table of 10 or so lololol 30mini-cups.The negatives are for the food quality. My sliders (2 on the plate for $6 + potato wedges and a few pickles on salad) were pretty overgreased and there was barely anything inside. Their potato wedges were great but still didn't make up for the overly-greased sliders. And my friend had the happyhour menu wings and there were literally like 5 pieces. I mean I know it's cheap and it's happy hour but ~5 pieces?! dang... that's just sad. The one plus for food was their mini pizza which was also $6. that one was pretty good in size (personal pizza size) and tasty. But I will be back! Because I can't say no to their beers. And I found a list of award-winning drinks I want to try - perhaps all at once :D...but after finals. in 2 weeks.can't wait.argh.
Jenny D.,San Jose  CA,9,10,1,9/22/2015,2.0,"Went here to eat around 630 pm last night (9/21). Wait wasn\'t long (10-15 min). We came in  I was giving my name she said the wrong name  I simply corrected the host  not a big deal  but she had to comment with an attitude ""Well yeah you\'re over there I couldn\'t hear you."" Ok? Yeah there was some distance  I was getting over a cold and I didn\'t want to be in her face. But that was unnecessary.We got to our table. We ordered our drinks and appetizers right away. We got our drinks and ordered our entrees. About 15 min we get our appetizers. Everything\'s going smoothly. Our waitress is consistently asking if we\'re doing ok. Once she cleaned up the empty plates that\'s where everything went downhill...After that  she never once came to our table to let us know the situation with our food. We kept looking at the time because I actually work graveyard so I wanted to make sure I had time. We were waiting close to an HOUR for our food. What made it even worse was that we were noticing people around us. FOUR TABLES WHO CAME AFTER US received their drinks  appetizers  entrees  and some had dessert as well while we were STILL waiting for our entrees. All we got were two small pizzas  ravioli  and a burger... My pizza was flat out cold/warm  probably due to the fact that they made mine first and it was just sitting there? I didn\'t want to send it back because who knows how long that would take. The guy behind us had ribs and other things  the table on the other side had a few people with full entrees dishes... The other guy who I noticed ordered while we were eating our appetizer received their food before we even got ours...And the other table were already eating their dessert and they were seated after us....All that was bullshit.We were ready to leave and our waitress finally came. No apologies. Didn\'t acknowledge that we were waiting. She didn\'t say anything. She acted as if nothing happened... And conveniently she had to go to break. She mentioned that there was someone who was gonna take over  BUT she didn\'t introduce us which they usually do  so we didn\'t even know who to ask if we needed anything. I seriously didn\'t think we should have even paid for our drinks or something. It\'s bullshit.4 tables who came after our appetizers received their meals  drinks  etc. first....Don\'t know where the manager was  usually they come table to table to ask how everything is..."
Dominique V.,Arcata  CA,69,26,55,1/30/2015,5.0,Thank you for finally putting another Restaurant in this prior vacant building. Hopefully this one will stay this time! I shop at the Coleman shopping center at least 3 days a week. I was happy to find out yesterday that they put a BJs in the facility. We went for happy hour. Got the $6 wine and $4 spirit happy hour specials. Ate stuffed mushrooms  fried artichokes  avocado egg rolls  and chicken wraps. Good prices for the portion size. Our server was Davey Jones! He was very attentive to our needs. We had questions about the menus and he was knowledgeable and helpful on decisions we were trying to make. With his service made our stay enjoyable.
Jack T.,Sunnyvale  CA,62,253,121,11/24/2013,4.0,BJ's Brewhouse has typically been one of my more favorite chain-type restaurants because they brew their own beer and their food is typically good.This Coleman location is no different. Lots of drink specials for house beers and happy hour food options.+ Good beer options  house or not+ Happy hour is on a lot for house beers+ Service is friendly+ Parking is not too bad- Front door staff is a work in progress. Three people in the front and I walk in and they still don't even look in my direction. But they were helpful once they figure out that they need to greet meIt's not as crazy crowded as the Cupertino location and wortha visit!
Linnea E.,San Jose  CA,365,689,145,11/22/2013,5.0,I see some pretty unfavorable reviews here... not sure if maybe I just got lucky? well whatever the reason  i'm ok with it. i think it's a good location.service: seemed good to me. i did have to flag someone down for takeout once  but wasn't a big deal. i just asked the hostess  and she got someone over there right away. the people who have helped me have all been great.the food: have to admit  i don't sample the menu. i like the sesame chicken salad  and order it almost every time. it's so good! sometimes they go a little heavy on the white part of the cabbage  which i don't care for. but all in all  a great dish. LOTS of chicken on it  and the flavor is wonderful. the dressing is sweet and thick  so it goes a long way with a small amount. i've had the avocado eggrolls too. they are yummy! i'm not as fond since they changed the recipe to add cream cheese  but still ok.i'd subtract a star for the whole pepsi thing (bleh)... but not really their fault at the location. but if bj's corporate reads this... one word... COKE! ;)
Lan N.,San Jose  CA,213,441,81,11/8/2013,3.0,This location still needs to find its legs. I went here with some friends and was told it was a 1 hour wait  but it actually turned out to be 30 minutes which was a good surprise.The place itself seems good for watching sports  but the bar looks be a bit small. They have a big screen that they split different ways to show sports. The night I went had NFL  NCAAF  NHL  and NBA all playing at once. There are some big screens scattered around the restaurant. As well as one outside on the patio area!Food wise  I was dissapointed in the pizza. I usually like the BJs deep dish  but here it was too flimsy. Needed more crunch on that crust. Also  the guy who brought the pizza just plopped it on the stand without saying anything. He also put it off center which I had to fix otherwise it might have fallen over. Service from our server was good when she was around  but sometimes it felt like she dissapeared for a long time. One of our people were missing something and it took a while to get that rectified. Even though there seems to be a lot of staff  I wonder what proportion are actually servers? I think a few more would help out.
lisa r.,San Jose  CA,4,30,3,7/22/2014,1.0,My visit to your restaurant was extremely disappointing. I had a lunch date with my daughter and we decided to come to BJ's and what a waste of time.DO NOT GO FOR LUNCH HOUR!We arrived at 1205 pm today and were told that we had a 10-15 min wait. I asked about the patio and was told that the server was new so we would have to wait for her to get her large group settled first. There were zero other patrons on the patio btw  but we waited and when seated  we were approached by another staff member who offered to get us beverages. I noticed that the large group was just now placing their orders and it did not look like we would be helped anytime soon. Well now its about 1230 and my daughter and I decide  we should get food to go because we wont have enough time if we sit here and wait. We go to the take out order area that is unmanned  and wait again. We place our order and are told it may take some extra time because the kitchen is a little backed up! it is now 1240pm but we decide to wait. At this time I also ask to speak to the MOD who I am told is in the kitchen helping out. I wait for her for about 7 mins and when she arrives she didn't apologize  offer anytype of service recovery incentive.  She simply asked what kind of pizza we had ordered and said she would speak to the staff. I offered her the training opportunity advice of training your staff not to share the details of your poorly staffed and managed establishment and to instead thank the customer for their patience and offer them some gesture of food or beverage. Even something as cheap as iced tea would calm people that are waiting. I did not need to know that the server was new  or that the kitchen was short staffed etc. I don't really care about that as a consumer  just want to know how I am going to be helped at the moment. It was an extremely lovely and sunny day outside and we planned to enjoy our lunch on your patio but instead had to eat it inside of the office while working. We didn't even get so much as a cookie coupon or a simple apology.
Anne L.,San Jose  CA,0,18,1,7/13/2016,1.0,I admit upfront that whenever I have dined at BJ's (this location and the one in Cupertino)  it's under protest. I am often with others who want to patronize the restaurant for the beer and television. I just can't stand to pay money for consistently poor and slow service  not to mention average to mediocre food.Today I was outvoted by two family members  so BJ's it was. My elderly father who is recovering from major heart surgery and who had his first foray out in public  asked the hostess if she would move us (before we actually sat down and had utensils) to a different table. The one she originally walked us to was in a high traffic area and I know he felt skittish sitting there. With her back to my father but facing me  she made an annoyed/disgusted face and begrudgingly took us to a different table nearby. I then saw her walk back to the host station where she was clearly complaining about this incident. Perhaps she overheard me say to my father that we made her angry  but seriously? During our painfully long dining experience today  I saw this hostess in action; it was abundantly clear she should quit her day job because she can't smile  can't be bothered and doesn't want to be working. The same can be said for our waiter  who I know was not only exasperating to our table  but also to other diners nearby where I could see looks and chatter of annoyance over his inattentiveness and general cluelessness.As per usual  our meals appeared at different times. We were never asked how our meal was  but at least refills happened at least once. We spoke with friends who happened to be there today and they mentioned they will likely stop eating at BJ's on their lunch breaks because the service is very slow. I know restaurant work can be grueling and thankless. That being said  it is a hospitality industry and if you are a hiring manager  consider employing staff who are capable of behaving professionally  capable of managing multiple tables  capable of taking pride in their jobs  capable of communication and capable of producing food within a reasonable amount of time!
T L.,Sacramento  CA,18,239,138,12/13/2015,1.0,Normally BJ's are fast  clean and with good service. Today  slow bar service  food before silverware  then long wait  appetizers asked about before delivery to table  blackened shrimp tacos unblackened at room temperature  bacon cheeseburger with half a slice of bacon after 20 minutes of waiting in a half empty restaurant. Not used to this BJ's! Not coming back! Come here at your own risk
Gabriela W.,San Francisco  CA,23,49,2,9/13/2015,2.0,I feel bad giving two stars but that's the service I got. Our waiter  although friendly took eons to get our food. We ordered sliders for appetizers and he didn't tell us he was giving us half the order because it was happy hour. Ok  strike one. Strike two was that the sliders came out before our drinks  before plates and silverware. Strike three was that our food took forever to come out and even longer  our wait to pay. What I never notice that I did notice was that not once were our drinks refilled (non-alcoholic) nor were we asked if we wanted anything else. Hmmm  I guess I'll just door dash this place next time.
Rick O.,Santa Ana  CA,3,11,1,1/2/2016,2.0,Pizza is decent but this location has terrible organization. Placed an order online (medium pizza and pizookie) and was told it'd be ready in 30 minutes. Arrived at the location and order was not ready. 15 minutes later I follow up and cashier tells me all that's missing is the ice cream for the pizookie. Another 5 minutes later I receive my order. I get home and my pizza is cold so now I have to reheat it. Thanks BJ Restaurant!
Mitch M.,San Jose  CA,7,147,47,11/16/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Sunday. Football. TWO servers on staff. Who is staffing this place? This place never ceases to amaze me. They were bad because they first openee....but still bad
Gino B.,Campbell  CA,88,4,2,4/26/2015,4.0,This place was ok. But the lady who sat us was the only reason they got this high of a rating. Stephanie thanks again. Food was Good as well. But the timing of the courses was horrible. We basically got all our food at once. I really hope the next time we visit this location they have worked out the timing issues. No one wants to eat there salad app and main course all at the same time.
Audrey R.,Santa Clara  CA,41,1,,6/30/2015,5.0,Word to the wise poeple!! If you don't like it don't eat here! Plain and simple! If the service sucked it's probably your problem!! Talking on the phone  not reading the menu then you expect the server to be ready when you are? Please! Stop being spoiled brats and sit down  decide what you want to drink then decide what you want to eat and then I'm pretty sure you will have great service.! I'm sure if you do that at every restaurant you will be pleasantly surprised at how great the service is. You should all get your head out of your asses.!! Oh and No I don't work here.
Maria B.,San Jose  CA,4,3,2,7/21/2015,1.0,Service was horrible  waited twenty minutes for our drinks and another ten to order our food. One star is too high. No plates  no silverware  no napkins; until we got up and asked for them and didn't have a refill on our waters. I know this is too much to ask on a Tuesday night with less than twenty customers in the restaurant. Ashley B needs to look into a new profession  maybe watching paint dry.
Melissa G.,San Jose  CA,155,27,23,8/3/2015,1.0,Unfortunately  I didn't learn from my first experience. Took my family out to dinner here and had a really unpleasant experience.  Then last night  we wanted delivery and they were one of the only places around that were open. We used a food delivery app to order. The food came cold to the touch. We ordered their new tavern style pizza. It had very little chicken and wasn't really good. My mother and brother had fettuccine Alfredo. The noodles were dry and there was hardly any sauce. The only thing that was good was the pizzooki. Really disappointed with them. Was hoping they'd be better the second time around.
Matt S.,Roseville  CA,12,6,2,8/30/2014,3.0,Went here with a group of 12. It was not a great experience at all. I think our server needed help. Big gaps in food delivery and some things didn't come. The food that did come was good though. We were very bothered and planned on never returning. The GM came out and apologized sincerely and made things right. We will give them a second chance.
Vivian H.,San Jose  CA,1,11,,2/8/2016,1.0,The wait here is long. The waiter brought out 1/2 basket of chips because they ran out but he did not inform us. It took at least 30 minutes to ask for a water refill. Not coming back.
Megan B.,San Jose  CA,16,27,,8/19/2016,1.0,My bf and I have ate here a few times since relocating to the area. Tonight the service was very poor. I used to waitress  so I have an understanding of the job. I also understand it's Friday night and they were busy  but it doesn't excuse the crappy service we received. When we arrived  we were told it would be about a 20 to 25 minute wait. No big deal. I would expect that on a Friday night. Our wait time was actually less. We got a table within ten minutes. We waited maybe five or ten minutes for our waitress to greet us. We both ordered an alcoholic beverage and an appetizer. When our waitress returned with our drinks  we ordered our meal. We decided to share a burger. We requested the thick cut fries and a side of thousand island. Our appetizer was brought to our table by someone other than our waitress. After it was dropped off  we realized we had no silverware or napkins. We had to flag down another waiter for silverware. Again our dinner was brought to our table by someone other than our waitress. The burger was served with thin fries which were cold. We didn't receive the side of thousand island or an extra plate. In fact  there were no condiments on our table and we weren't offered any. By the time our waitress checked on us  the appetizer and burger had already been consumed. Both of our drinks were empty. I asked her for a side of thousand. She didn't ask either of us if we wanted another drink. After  the waitress takes another table's order before bringing me my thousand island. At that point  my bf requested the check. We were both beyond frustrated and ready to leave. If you're paying $50.00 for a meal  you should receive decent service! Oh  and our waitress was Xitlally. I would suggest she receive more training. She clearly doesn't understand the basics of being a server.
Mario S.,San Jose  CA,0,3,,7/9/2015,1.0,These guys need new management & new employees! Every time I've been there it has been an unpleasant experience! I gave them multiple opportunities to provide good service! Simply put...  they have failed! The last time was the worst! I came in  I'm in a good mood  mind you  and the bartender treats me like I'm bothering her probably because I'm putting her to work instead of letting her talk to her big  tattooed friend. Ask her a couple of questions about beer & fries.....  forget it. It's obvious  I'm bothering her for service!!!! It's unacceptable!!! BTW  I always tip well & I never post negative Yelp reviews!! First time....  avoid this place!! Chili's down the street is better service!!
Alice S.,Daly City  CA,0,5,,6/23/2016,1.0,Service suck!!!(ex..our server disappeared for long period of time  drink were not refreshed   wrong drink order numerous time  took about 1 hr before our meal was served and addition 15 minutes for the last hamburger to arrived and was not hot(there only 4 in our party)... Needless to say we won't be back.....and this was the fourth BJ we been to and they all have similar problems.
Auden W.,San Francisco  CA,464,404,1103,10/7/2014,2.0,Food is bland  service is below average. What more can I say?! Generally this place is not a great place to dine. Prices were above average. If you were to get something similar that tasted better  olive garden is a much better alternative. On a side note  the alcohol is decent.
Rimi K.,San Francisco  CA,522,430,422,5/21/2014,4.0,*~*Accomodating  friendly staff  reasonably quick service and great late night eats*~*If I have the choice between a pazooki and...anything else...I choose pazooki!Came through late at night for a midnight snack.Ordered:Avacado rollsSeared Salmon Salad (per servers rec)Chocolate Chip PazookiFilling with plenty to take home. The salad was big and my friend really enjoyed it. Good quality salmon.The restaurant was quiet and although we came after the last seating  they seated us anyways as opposed to sticking us in the bar which would have been less fun. Its in a reasonably large shopping area but closer to the street with plenty of parking in the lot.Recommend!
Jim C.,San Jose  CA,2,18,,7/7/2016,2.0,Hi  wanted to say how disappointed I was with my BJ's experience today. I was craving a burger so bad  not being able to eat one as I have been dieting. So decided to have a cheat day and have a burger. Looking at BJ's menu I decided to go for it and get the Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger. Well let's just say it was not at all what the picture showed  or I expected. I expected Brisket  instead I got less than a teaspoon of shredded beef. I also asked for the burger cooked medium rare  it came out well done. Lastly I asked for Extra Crispy Wedge Fries  they came out standard and soft. So to end this note I can say I am not sure I will be going back anytime soon  at least to this store  even though it is only a short walk from my house. The only good thing about the experience was the staff  they were great  friendly  and accomodating.
Raya B.,San Jose  CA,24,21,3,11/13/2015,5.0,Max is the best server  ask for him when you come here. He works hard  he tries his best  always communicates  and let's you know what's good. Thanks max for a great evening here:) we will be back cuz of you.
Felicia F.,San Jose  CA,510,175,144,9/16/2014,1.0,I seriously wish I could give negative stars for today's experience. Do not use their curbside!!! It's pointless because you probably will have a quicker lunch eating there. Waited 20 mins to get our food  mind you we placed the order an hour prior to picking it up. Never coming back!
Stephanie L.,Morgan Hill  CA,72,117,64,10/1/2014,3.0,There were highs and lows. We came around 6 on a Wednesday night  and it was pretty busy because of the giants game. Hubby and my mom got beer flights (four 5oz pours for $6.95 - great deal that lets you taste a few beers). The server was knowledgeable about the brews and helped them pick ones they would like... or so we thought. There was only one they liked out of four. He did offer to get my mom something else  which was great.Our apps were great. We got potato skins (haven't had them in years!!!) And fried artichoke hearts. Mmm  who knew fried potatoes and artichokes were good??Our dinners  sadly  not so good. I got the seared ahi salad. The server forgot to note the huge dollops of wasabi on the side of the plate  so my first bite included a mouthful of wasabi! I was almost in tears. Other than that  the tuna was just ok  and the rest of the salad was a massive pile of weedy lettuce. Hubby's salad was lame  too  and my mom's flatbread pizza wasnt much better.
Roya A.,Mountain View  CA,0,2,,7/1/2016,5.0,Roberto is the best server ever! He had the best drink suggestions  was always around when we needed him  and very fast and friendly. The food and drinks were good too
Becca V.,San Jose  CA,295,8,1,12/2/2015,1.0,I haven't had a bad experience at other BJ's locations  but tonight was terrible here. They forgot to ring in my drink  then brought me the completely wrong order  then told me they'd take care of my entire meal including my drinks  then charged me for two beers. Horrible service  felt unattended to...I don't normally give bad reviews  but it was a horrible experience. I will never come back to this location again.
Lisa L.,San Jose  CA,28,106,190,10/9/2014,3.0,Appallingly  they razed a Chevys that had on been built 4 years ago to put in this BJs  but it was a great decision and I bet they never looked back. This chain restaurant has a local vibe and serves the 408 well. Tonight we had traditional wings (great) and bruschetta (wonder bread not as great) and beer (they have 7 taps of their own and 34 more  which is great). We come here frequently and love that they spin tunes from the 80s and 90  They've got the clientele marketing nailed.
Whyte F.,San Jose  CA,69,45,3,8/18/2015,3.0,"I hate to say it  I even waited more than 6 months  hoping something would change. The location has a good ambiance and the servers are friendly for the most part... We get the same one every time? But never had a bad experience with the staff. The food on the other hand  man  hit and miss! I had some sea food soup and it lacked love  straight up. Now you might question ""love"" but if that\'s the way it\'s suppose to be made they might as well take it off their menu! The shrimp look like it can from a can  charge me 6bucks and then I would agree ""you get what you pay for  the mahi mahi was real... At least it tasted like it;) I probably won\'t go back  I never gave any restaurant 6 months to a year to get their sh!$ together. Lots of menu items but lacks passion. 3 stars for their servers/one we only get and she was a hot mess!"
Christa W.,Santa Clara  CA,0,8,,4/2/2016,2.0,I hate to rate so low. I want to love this place. The food is great  but the service is terrible. Long wait times to get food combined with a staff that really doesn't care about their customers  leave me wanting to never return. This place is worse than going to the DMV. In fact  I think the people who work at the DMV are nicer. Servers and hostesses/hosts need to actually like people or at least be good at pretending to like people. I won't be back.
Dixie L.,San Jose  CA,130,192,33,5/31/2014,2.0,"DARK as f*ck. Guys  bring your date here if you don\'t like looking at her :P But seriously  I hate the menus! Is it really necessary to not include the prices on the alcoholic drinks !? FUUUUI had to ask my waiter how much it was  and even then she didn\'t know..she went to go find out the cost  only to bring the drink with it??? UH I didn\'t order it yet.... and the drink was expensive as heck ! and it didn\'t even contain that much liquid  let alone was it made correctly.. hello  who the heck serves a blended margarita without a salt rimmed cup!? obviously this place.....There was only one lunch special that was good and actually quite inexpensive! the ""BBQ Lunch Platter""!Only if you have the patience to wait for the food though..food arrives so slowwww"
Liz J.,San Jose  CA,121,263,823,5/3/2014,4.0,We walked in around 10am and got seated immediately. Only a few people in this squeaky clean place. Our waiter was attentive and quickly served us some coffee. Coffee wasn't bad black. We tried the baked Italian omelette light on the cheese. It was pretty good and the potatoes had a crispy exterior. It's also served with toast either whole wheat or sourdough. We tried the short stack pancakes. Not bad. Our waiter gave us refills as soon as we needed them and brought the condiments out before the food. We will be back for brunch.
George W.,San Jose  CA,1,13,12,1/11/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,The service in the most part I found to be very slow and inefficient  at night hard to get basic service like drinks  one night I went in  new years eve there were 12 people in the reatuarant and seven wait staff and I could not get waited on it took one and a half hours to get a cheese Berger and coke  and the coke came for desert   the wait staff were visiting with each other in the corner and no manager on the floor  but I guess that's a large corp these days  it makes me wonder how they manage to pay the lease .
Trang T.,San Jose  CA,291,223,49,5/11/2014,1.0,I called to make a large party reservation  was put on hold for so long that the phone line rerouted me back to the main line. The girl ended up taking down my information for their manager to call me back in which i never got a call back.Maybe it's a blessing in disguise? I was initially very hesitant about having my birthday dinner here based on the high number of bad reviews but I figured its close and convenient  i'll take my risks. I mean  if the manager doesn't have it together enough to get back to you or do what they promise then how can i expect the establishment to have it together enough to give you a easy flowing dining experience right? Thanks but no thanks!
Joseph '.,Tigard  OR,18,42,40,10/18/2015,4.0,We sat outside and had a great time here. Airplanes departing were a bit noisy  but wasn't a huge issue. I enjoyed a salmon dish and chocolate chip pizookie.
Pooky C.,San Jose  CA,0,313,214,3/15/2015,3.0,I usually don't like sports bars  but the food we had was not bad.I had the Flatbread Breakfast Pizza which had scrambled egg  sausage  potato on it. It was yummy. Hubby said the Pork chop was decent. Don't be scared away by the 2 and a half stars. It's still better than Applebee's.
Vivian D.,Modesto  CA,228,100,179,8/30/2014,5.0,I loved it! Their Mac and cheese I UHMAZING. Small apportioned but still amazing. We got seated quickly and on a Saturday night. I will be back (:
Mike D.,San Jose  CA,74,51,,7/13/2014,1.0,"The pazuki was a good as I remembered. However  the service and the food - what happened????Especially on a big event day - bring your ""A"" game  please (at least ""B"" game would have been okay. Glad I have choices in the future - not here next time.Sorry  but there has to be something like ""I kinda care"" mentality."
Paulina V.,San Jose  CA,0,1,,11/13/2015,3.0,Food was good as always service was sucky  lack of attention to our table rude attitude every time we asked a question by Carlos C. and super slow service even to pay took about 30mins.
Thien N.,San Jose  CA,90,207,277,3/19/2014,1.0,This BJ's location has the WORST SERVICE EVERRR. And...would it hurt to turn on the light? It's way to dark  especially in the Bar area.I'm a huge fan of BJ's (no pun intended) and LOVE the Oakridge and Cupertino locations. However  the Coleman location has the slowest and inattentive service. I have gone here twice within the last month  once for Happy Hour and once for dinner in the main dining room.Found a table in the Bar area for HH but it was still dirty from the previous guests. It took 27 minutes for them to clear the table. Then it took another 15 minutes to get our drink and food orders in. The waitress messed up on my order  so I had to wait an extra 10 minutes for my pizza while all my friends had their food. This was really unacceptable. Got in around 10  didn't leave until right before closing after all the waiting.Second time  got a table in the main dining room for 6 people. Again  20 minutes pass by before we got our food orders in. The food came out and we had no plates  no utensils  no condiments we requested. We keep seeing like 5 waiters keep walking back and forth but they just drop off the food and bounce. The place was pretty dead at that time so there was no excuse for the service to be like that.Love the food and the drinks...Not so much the service. Go to the other locations.
Mark F.,San Jose  CA,128,55,31,9/8/2015,2.0,First of all  when we first came in we asked to be seated at a table and they sat us at a booth. We asked to change seating to a table and then never provided us utensils until we asked after our appetizer arrived. My wife ordered the balsamic chicken  which was good  and I ordered the parmesan chicken  which was below mediocre. The chicken barely had any dressing while the rest of the chicken didn't have any flavour.
Jessica G.,Milpitas  CA,4,28,7,9/5/2015,1.0,Food wasn't that great. Plus my husband and I got sick after eating there. We love this restraunt but this location and food wasn't good.
Lucia E.,Santa Clara  CA,1,9,1,5/24/2016,1.0,"I guess i should have checked the reviews before going to this location. A coworker and i came here for lunch earlier today 5/24 and waiting a little bit before we were greeted. We got sat by a very friendly blonde haired male waiter and sat unattended for about 15-20 minutes before i waved down that same host and asked if we could have a waiter sent over  He quickly apologized and offered to get us some drinks and also call over a manager. We then sat for at least another 5 minutes before our waiter finally came to attend us. After we ordered  we sat there waiting for another 15 minutes completely unattended before we decided to get up and leave since we only had 0 minutes to get back to the office. We walked up to the hostess stand where there stood a hostess with bright red lips (did not get her name) and asked her if we could get our orders bagged and taken to go. She actually looked annoyed that i would ask such a thing! If i wasn\'t already upset this definitely would have done it. She said she would go tell our MIA waiter and also get a manager. No manager ever came. She came back to the hostess stand and we were still waiting for our food to be packaged to go. I asked her if the waiter was new. i didn\'t think this was such a bad question since he did seem to be a bit lost. She rolled her eyes and said ""no  he just has a lot of tables"". Then she proceeded to walk off. i recall only having seen 2 tables with 2 people sitting at each on either side of us. Both who had been sat after us. Our waiter finally came back with our food and handed us our bill. Since our entire interaction was him handing us our food and saying ""thank you"" and the 3 sentences it took to order my simple soup and salad lunch  we left no tip. the only positive thing from this lunch was that the food was very good as always. I will definitely not be returning to this location."
Rufina A.,San Jose  CA,0,10,1,6/26/2016,1.0,After having a previous server  Paola took over our table. We were a table of four... Had already had our drinks and food ordered. We waited quite a bit for our food and during that time had multiple drinks that needed to be refilled and we didn't get checked on. When we were checked on we asked for refills and waited another good 10 minutes for those. At that time our empty glasses weren't cleared from our table but just left there.... By the end of our meals there were 11 glasses on the table. Keep in mind we didn't drink any alcohol. All empty iced teas  water and soda cups. Our food was served to us cold  not to mention she didn't even bring us our food someone else did and we even received some of our orders wrong. Our server was so inattentive she didn't notice my friend waving to get her attention. When she did make the time to stop by she left in a hurry and didn't even complete her sentences to us. I personally had to go ask my server for our check at the hostess counter and at that point she asked where we were sitting..... We had been there over an hour now and she didn't even know where we were sitting? Overall I can say we were very displeased with our service.
H G.,San Jose  CA,2,221,18,5/21/2014,4.0,Great location!! Service was nice  quick and friendly!Got a lunch salad - smaller then a normal salad and a 'cup' of soup - the cup was HUGE!! Had clam chowder and was decent :)Will be back for more lunches!
Yohann J.,San Jose  CA,9,24,5,8/2/2014,5.0,Great bar  good food and there's always parking. Good place to watch a game. Recommend any of the brews and the low calorie menu is a good addition.
Angela V.,San Jose  CA,46,4,,5/12/2016,1.0,Not worth the wait  we've been sitting here for a long time haven't even ordered our main course  even though I told our waiter we haven't ordered he walked away and didn't bother to come back  worst service ever  I rather go somewhere where they take service seriously. I'm leaving and making sure their supervised know about this.
Jenelle G.,Oregon City  OR,289,119,68,5/17/2014,5.0,Get a pizookie. I don't care what you're going there for  you need to get a pizookie. Any one of them tastes amazing but I do get the double chocolate one. Comes with a single square of chocolate on it and it's already melting on the pizookie by the time it gets to you.Sitting outside is lovely. The places can be loud and create an awkward silence because you have to wait for them to go over  but if you're from around that area then that is something you're probably already used to.The staff has always been friendly and everything is always great and clean. Enjoyable and perfect for groups.
Sarmad N.,San Leandro  CA,468,288,145,3/16/2015,3.0,Not bad but not great either. I came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. We came in at 2 pm which is much after the busy lunch crowd. We were seated immediately and our waiter immediately took our appetizer order and got us our drinks quickly. The food did take some time to get to us. I ordered the Mahi Mahi which was on the lighter side menu. The fish was cooked well and the veggies were great. However i felt as if they used too much ginger. I felt like the dish was over powered by it. I also ordered cheddar broccoli soup which was okay. I have actually had better cheddar broccoli soup from togos. It was nice to sit and talk and enjoy the ambiance. However the dishes i tried were not great. Perhaps next time I will stick to more classics.
Mac D.,San Jose  CA,72,3,,12/20/2015,1.0,I'm here now  got passed over for 45 minutes to be seated  ordered  soup was cold sent it back  meal arrived before soup was out  over cooked. Got soup  finally too hot to eat. This is by far worse than chili's and that place sucks ass
Varun S.,Creve Coeur  Saint Louis  MO,8,25,1,4/1/2014,1.0,This place stands up to its 2 star review average. It should more like 1 star. Took forever to get water  plates for appetizer came before water. When the server finally came with the appetizer there was no cutlery No napkins. Server left 1 paper tissue for the two of us and kept ignoring us all the while. Oh! And since this is an eating place: food was acceptable.
Jenno H.,San Jose  CA,0,30,4,4/24/2015,3.0,This js the first time ive been to Bjs in quite a while. The beer was awesome!! But the food...not so much. I ordered a shrimp scampi meal and it was pretty good i must admit. But my appetizer was horrendous!! I ordered the calamari and it was soggy and just did not taste good what so ever I was so disappointed. This is the worst calamari ive had yet. But the service was good and everything else was nice which is why todays trip earned 3 stars. If it wasn't for that this review would have been 1 star!
Miss C.,Santa Cruz  CA,2,112,14,5/24/2015,1.0,This place sucks! I called in ahead of time to get put on the wait list. I get there tell the young girl in the front that I called and I'm here. She tells me it'll be another 15 mins. okay sure. Sit there for the 15 mins. Finally go up and ask what the status is and all the girls in the front say that they had called my name over the intercom several times. Sure like I didn't hear that I was sitting right there and how do they not know I've been sitting there in the first place. Then they say okay donr owrry youll be next. Im sittjng there waitinf a d they call a Wendy?! Like really? I got up there and the girl just says soorry sorry. Psssh im leaving!! Bad bad service! Never coming here again. AVOID AVOID AVOID! The girls in the front are ridiculously stupid and slow.
Jonathan B.,San Jose  CA,9,129,,8/31/2014,5.0,I'm pretty excited that BJ's Brewery is expanding in the valley. It's one of my favorite places and I'm weary of waiting in the Cupertino line with that notoriously difficult parking garage. My first experience here was with a very large group of people for a birthday party; like about 20 people. There were several servers assigned to our table and it was a bit of a mad house. After a while  our food arrived and we noticed that one person (out of the 20  mind you) didn't receive her salad and then she didn't receive her food. We mentioned it to one of the servers  and they rushed her order. After she finally got her meal  the server made it clear that they house would take care of her check. Then the manager came by and apologized for missing her order. Her meal was free and later on we discovered that they had also not charged us for the 2 Pazookies we ordered.  I also noticed that the manager was going around to all the tables to check in on the customers. We were all pretty impressed.The food  beer  and atmosphere at BJ's are top notch. In my experience  this particular location has terrific management and is very customer focused. It was crowded when we were there  so I think that this restaurant has some serious success in its future; and just in time too because a lot of people are going to be moving into downtown San Jose in the next few years.
Cate G.,Campbell  CA,34,204,122,5/1/2015,1.0,Such awful service it's ridiculous. Food is the same as every other BJs restaurant chain. You will wait foe.eve.er!!!! For food  a check  the cheney to just leave you get so pissed off.
John J.,Santa Cruz  CA,28,103,3,12/27/2015,2.0,Saw the BJ's so we decided to stop in. This location was in a shopping center with tiny marked parking spots. Ridiculous for anyone with kids and four doors. Once  we got over the 18 inches to slide out of the car we were greeted by a couple of workers who were barely interested in us and more interested in chatting with each other. Franchise looked like a typical BJ's. Food was typical and cooked like what I've had at other locations. Met our basic food need and was similar to what we expected from other stores. Had an older waitress who either hated her job or just did not want to work her shift. Can't recall if she ever smiled or even tried to make a pleasant remark even after dropping off the check for her tip. It was OK...but I doubt I will go back to this site.
John L.,San Jose  CA,0,11,2,11/8/2014,3.0,Its a chain  so what makes it different  in short:- Beer ****selection****- Cocktails ***nothing special***- Food ***standard***- Service **below expectations**- TVs - there a a good ten of them  but they don't always play the sound of the game. Some are too small to see unless your at the bar top. ***just an okay place to watch a game***- Crowds - bar seating is small  but can find a place quicker than if you wait for a table if your patient and persistent ***standard***
Mystery S.,Sunnyvale  CA,0,10,,5/25/2016,4.0,A friend and I had stopped in for a late night drink/bite to eat. The service was OK  except for the guy who brought out our food. I believe his name was Jesse. He took care of us more than our actual waiter! Get this guy a waiting job! Other than that  our experience at BJ's is the same as always...good food  good service.
Taylor R.,San Jose  CA,61,56,16,3/9/2015,1.0,"Okay  so I have been putting this review off for a couple MONTHS in hopes that this location would give me something other than negative points to write in this review  but unfortunately that is not the case.Every time. And I mean EVERY time I come here there is something wrong.So I will start with the first experience:I came in with a group of friends and say on the patio  out server couldn\'t handle a large group. We ended up staying give or take THREE hours. (This was meant to be a nice quick dinner to catch up with each other)One of the biggest things I was concerned about was when our server brought me an alcoholic beverage. I am 20. I did. Not ask for the drink and let him know. He apologized and took it back. Really? Do you want to loose your alcohol license? I think not. Frustrated and annoyed with the lack of service we tracked down our server after not seeing him for close to an hour to get our check. Long story short  I did not want to come back.Second visit:I was a little hesitant to come back  but decided to give this location another shot since this time we were a party of three I thought or server could handle it. Well  I was wrong. My friends ordered a pizza and I got the chicken tortilla soup and a salad.The pizza took 30 minutes to come out(fine)But what was not fine was it was the wrong pizza. Our server took it back and placed the order or the correct pizza. 30 minutes later  the right pizza! Yay! So waited an hour for pizza. Thumbs down. And also got the chicken tortilla soup. We finished the pizza and soup and surprise! Still no salad. I asked our server to take it off since it never came out. Our total stay was 2 hours. 2 hours for a pizza and soup. I had to get up twice to ask for water  because our services did not once come by to refill our glasses.After this time I swore never to come back.Third visit:Yesterday. Why did in come back here? I know I\'m just setting myself up for a terrible experience. But  a friend was in town and wanted to come here. Noooo :c Anyways I got a table and waited for my friend and ordered potstickers. They were good and came out in a timely matter. My friend showed up and we ordered the carnitas fries  sliders and guess what? Chicken tortilla soup!. And I made it very clear I just wanted a cup. Of. Chicken. Tortilla. Soup. That\'s it. Our server dropped off the fries and walked away before I could ask for small plates. Another server brought out the rest of our food  sliders came out fine. But she set down a bread bowl of the chicken tortilla soup.... How do you mess that up? I just want a cup of soup :( I asked her just for soup. She didn\'t say anything and walked away with the bread bowl. Time passed No refill on water  so I went to go find our server.Yay water! And yay for finally getting chicken tortilla soup!! We didn\'t see our sever after that. Someone else took over. She didn\'t even tell us someone else was going to take over. She was rude. And clearly ""over it"" word of advise for being in the service industry: don\'t get complacent. Be humble. Else your tips will reflect on your customer service.I am going to be writing a follow up review for the server who took over  who is the ONLY reason I will ever be dining in on this location."
Ayka And Darrell H.,Campbell  CA,0,20,27,9/24/2015,2.0,"By far the worst customer service. Ordered appetizers and meal. All came out at once. Mentioned to server and only answer was ""enjoy"". Are you kidding me? Then pestered us for dessert. Once we ordered  we received our final bill within 30 seconds. No Joke. So so disappointed. Will not return to this BJ\'s. Sad because it is so close."
Jess H.,San Jose  CA,141,17,12,7/22/2014,1.0,Several issues with this restaurant. 1. My medium rare burger fell apart as it was over cooked. The appetizer ahi poke was fresh last week. The Frys tasted ok. The water Mellon Salad was good. 2. Being inundated with the Aweful Fox News Channel blaring it's absurdities at me. 3. No visit from the manager on duty. You would think with a party of 20 people spending well over five hundred dollars a visit would be necessary4. Asked the waiter to change from Fox News and because another group preferred Fox News they went with the other group of prefer the tv be turned off at this point. Just disappointing all around prob the reason this place was empty...
Ryan E.,San Jose  CA,66,116,158,3/14/2014,2.0,Service not so good  beer good.  Sat down on a Monday evening  took 10 minutes and some asking to get a server to come over  the server wasn't happy as it wasn't the table they should have had to serve  and then it took another 10 minutes to get a couple of beers.  Lucky it was just me and not my family  as I would have been more upset about the service and would have asked for a manager.
Patricia D.,Morgan Hill  CA,28,25,10,4/29/2014,2.0,So two girls that I work with told me about this place on two separate occasions so I had to cheek it out Walked in the place a quite a few people where seated I got excited  then I walk to the podium where the host was and wait. Expecting a HI welcome........ but nothing she turns her back to us  Ok maybe she's overwhelmed and busy. So I asker her how long the wait is  and she seats us right way.Our server greated us right away  asked us what we want to drink  I was hafe way expecting him to offer us something or make suggestion but he didn't. So I went with sodas and fried artichoke hearts (my favorite) the appetizer took 20 min and it came before our sodas did! When I got up to ask the manager if we could get our drinks  or maybe order our dinner his response was ok Ok Ok Ok where are you sitting I point out our table and I sat back down. Another 15 min go by and our sodas came   now 35 mins in to our experience and we have not yet ordered dinner. I finally got to order a angel hair pasta dish with garlic  basil  sun dried tomatoes and olive oil I opted to added the blackened chicken  it looked good. But looks can be deceiving. Over cooked pasta almost no basil or garlic the chickens seasonings where inconsistent from one end to the other. Fail My husband got a jalapeo burger it had no jalapeos and tasted primarily of cilantro. Fail big time. Was NOT Impressed. Don't think all be going back  Well maybe if there is nothing else to eat and I have a choice of McDonald's or this place I might go and try Bj s again
Natty C.,San Jose  CA,145,5,1,5/19/2016,1.0,I hate to give one star but last nights experience was horrible. I went with my boyfriend's family to celebrate his little sister's birthday but the service was the worst i have experienced by a waiter. To start off my boyfriend let our waiter know it was his sisters birthday hoping she would acknowledge her. Our food took one hour to get to us  she never stopped to let us know if the kitchen was busy or if the food was on its way  at that time the restaurant was mainly busy at the bar. When she finally brought the food I asked the waiter how long their standard time to bring out food was and with a smirk she replied usually 20 minutes  I told her we had been waiting an hour and the least she could have done was be apologetic but instead she ignored me and walked away. She forgot to bring silverware and when she brought it we told her our food was cold especially the burgers and fries  she at least offered to bring new order of fries. At that point it was pointless to even ask her to re heat the food because we would have probably waited another 20 min. She brought the check 15 min later and never even came by to sing happy birthday or apologize after hearing us sing to birthday girl. I regret not getting her name to mention her.
Jonathan O.,Fayetteville  NC,7,3,,9/13/2015,1.0,The service here is extremely slow and they continuously got things wrong..I ordered a hef and was brought a blonde... No big deal the blonde is good too.. Then I ordered wedge cut fries and was brought thin cut.. Don't come here  it's not worth it.
An N.,San Jose  CA,375,243,875,2/2/2015,2.0,My experience here so far has been a huge let down. I am still here waiting on my food. I checked in at 7:30pm and still no dinner. Yes I get we came with a big party but by the time my appetizer came  half the other side of the table has got their dinner. Now I am still waiting here for my food while now 98% of us is done. They said our food runner dropped my food  but it took him so long to even ask if I still want it. Of course I do  I didn't have my dinner yet. So  he just came and said another 8 minutes it should be done. My whole table is done eating and their ordering desert  while I sit here and wait some more. 2 hours later  I'm still hungry and no food. No apology no anything  just blame on the food runner who dropped the food. Manager keeps walking by but his focus is on the table full of girls behind us. I finally get my deep dish lasagna  my first bite was luke warm. Wait a minute  lasagna is supposed to be gooey  steamy and so hot you burn your tongue  but not in this case. I had to send it back  luke warm was not what I wanted.By the time the time it came back out  everyone was done and ready to pay the bill. I really want to like this place but for what it is  that was not acceptable.
Ms. S.,Thousand Oaks  CA,1,24,7,8/6/2014,5.0,I am surprised that bjs has such a low rating for this location. I went there on a date on a Friday evening around 9:15 and there was no wait at all.The waitress was really nice and was attentive to our table. The atmosphere is cool (like all bjs) and the music was good.The food was delicious! We got sliders  ahi poki (you must try it)  and calamari. I tried the blonde brew house beer which was good and a strawberry splash which is like drinking candy.Overall  I give it a 5 for now.
Christian T.,San Jose  CA,0,6,,10/20/2015,5.0,The service and food are great at this location. Servers are very attentive and helpful. I went again last week and the manager stopped by the table to reward us with membership program points for dining. Overall  great experience and the pizookie's are always the best.
Aileene C.,San Jose  CA,134,186,119,5/12/2014,4.0,I love this location! Way better than the one at Oakridge Mall. No matter what the occasion  the wait is never longer than 30min. My latest visit was on Mother's Day (cause I'm a mother) and we waited like 5 min to get seated. We ordered the Ahi Poke for appetizer  and OMG it was def the best by far! I think it's the sauce they have for it. Mm so yummy!! I usually order the Parmesan Crusted Chicken and it's always delicious. I also ordered a strawberry martini  which was yummy and a mini white choc Mac nut pazookie! Our server was really nice and cool  I think her name is Stacy. The experience I've had here every time I went was always pleasant.
Parth S.,Roseville  CA,1,2,,4/22/2016,1.0,"Wow  where to begin. We put our name down for a reservation on a Friday night and was told it would be 40-50 minutes. After 40 minutes  they called us saying we\'re ready to be seated. When we went to get seated  our reservation somehow disappeared and we were forced to put our name down again for another table. That\'s strike 1. When we were served appetizers we weren\'t given any plates  utensils  or napkins. Strike 2. We repeatedly asked for refills on water and they ""forgot"" multiple times. Strike 3. When we finally got our pizza it was cold as if it had been sitting on the counter for an hour. Strike 4. This is the worst service I\'ve ever had and I\'m not coming back. Based on the other reviews I\'d recommend the same for everyone else."
Aaron R.,San Jose  CA,0,2,8,6/2/2016,2.0,Jessilyn seemed to be late to the table- then waited agin for water and 25 minutes for any food after ordered.
Sara M.,San Jose  CA,52,31,8,6/24/2015,2.0,"Nothing special. I ordered soup and salad  honestly I could have had a much tastier option at Panera which is right next-door. I ordered the Saracha honey brussels sprouts and they were a little bit too charred and not flavorful at all! The tomato soup tasted like Safeway soup and came with three salad croutons. I guess the food just lacks ""effort"". The service was pleasant."
Jen T.,Pittsburgh  PA,21,125,14,6/8/2014,2.0,Food: They dun messed up. First of all  I ordered a drink  and after telling me that they were out  they didn't take it off the check until I pointed it out. Secondly  I ordered the vegetarian pizza  but they gave me the Mediterranean instead  which has chicken on it (I'm vegetarian). So disappointing. I hate the idea of wasting food  so I picked the chicken off the pizza and tried to eat that  but it wasn't even good to begin with. I ate maybe a slice or two and gave the rest to my boyfriend. The friends who were with me also had most of their meals leftover at the end. Really not good. Perhaps the only thing that people enjoyed was their beer.Prices: Not cheap. Given the quality of the food  not reasonable.Service: There were a lot of us  so the waitress had a lot to keep track of  so I don't really blame her that she messed up. They were also willing to set up a special table for us outside  which was nice. Service wasn't spectacular  though.Overall: Had a pretty bad experience here. Maybe it was just the situation  and perhaps it won't happen again  but I won't be going back to find out.
R K.,San Jose  CA,21,155,3,3/13/2014,3.0,I was a little hesitant about going to this location since there were a lot a bad reviews on the service.On our visit (weekday  around 7pm) I found the service level to be totally fine and our server was actually quite nice and good. They even changed the TV over to the Warriors game after we had asked.Food was typical BJ's and pretty much on par with other BJ's I've been to in the past. Nothing spectacular  but not horrible either. Their beers are still quite good.
Daniel C.,Blossom Valley  San Jose  CA,3,6,1,7/22/2015,1.0,The service is horrible. We were seated by the hostess and we saw our waitress every twenty minutes. We needed refills and napkins so when we asked it was like we were asking for too much. She should have checked on us more often i didnt know what was going on.
Megha R.,Milpitas  CA,0,16,1,5/5/2015,2.0,"We were out at the Coleman avenue BJ\'s last night for a causal dine in. It was far less crowded than the one at Cupertino. The reception at the front desk was pretty decent. We were a 4 member group and given a booth which we pretty much liked. We had specifications of no beef  bacon or mushrooms in our dishes which was catered to very well. However  while taking our orders  we felt  we were being rushed into. The lady tending to us would end up completing our sentences. ""It\'s a good thing to know what your customer wants but it\'s better if you listen to them first."" Generally our ordering food was vocalized by her throughout which we didn\'t appreciate. This mode was going this until we finished ordering the main course. It had been just a few minutes since we began and the lady popped in to check if wanted any dessert. We didn\'t want any  and lo behold  just a minute later  the cheque lands on our table and she walked off saying we could pay up whenever we were ready! This high speed of having to finish and wrap away got on to our nerves. Pointers to the management at BJ\'s Coleman avenue:-Train your staff members  especially the ones who are serving  to be patient and LISTEN!! Though they may know what we are trying to get at  it\'s nicer if we were allowed to express it first.- Do not rush us out  after all we did come there to spend time and make merry. May be we would end up ordering a couple of more drinks if you hadn\'t landed the cheque on us before we even hinted that we were ready.- Having verbal courtesies but your actions not speaking for it doesn\'t really do any good.Personally We may not go back there by choice but we would definitely go back to the one at Cupertino.PS: I feel the strawberry Martinis are slightly over priced at BJ\'s"
Steven M.,San Jose  CA,57,29,47,12/27/2013,3.0,"Let\'s just say that if it weren\'t for the waiter (Shelby)  I would give this place two stars rather than three. She was attentive and friendly  despite serving a somewhat drunk  rowdy party of 10. She had even given a few of us free root beers and cream sodas! This being the result of her assuming that we\'d be finished with our first glass (unlimited refills for whomever ordered their handcrafted sodas). My hat is off to Shelby for being an amazing waitress. Onward to the food.One thing I dislike most is chain restaurant food. Ugh. Because this was a special occasion and the fact that I was absolutely starving  I sucked it up and forced myself to order and ingest the over-priced  average/sub-par tasting dishes. I proceeded to order the ""Grilled Burger Melt"" which came with the choice of either thin-cut crispy or wedge-cut fries; I opted for the thin-cut crispy. I asked for MEDIUM-RARE on my beef patty. I got an all brown-gray beef patty = WELL-DONE. You get a pass on that  Shelby. The burger wasn\'t that bad actually. I think if it had been cooked MEDIUM-RARE  I would\'ve probably enjoyed it a lot more  but average as predicted. Same goes for the appetizers: fried calamari and lettuce wraps. All average  possibly worse.The ambiance and atmosphere of the restaurant was pretty nice  but I wouldn\'t suggest coming here unless it was an option for a ""last-resort for someone\'s birthday with a party of five or more"" kind of thing or perhaps a ""late-night get together and let\'s grab some brews and watch sports"" kind of thing."
Johanna L.,San Jose  CA,0,1,,3/12/2015,1.0,This location is so bad  that we joke about what will be wrong with tonight's order. So far I got a baked potato with no butter/sour cream  cheeseburger w/ no cheese  fish & chips that fell on the floor as server delivered plate to table  then left fish on the floor. I cringe when friends suggest this place. Definitely DO NOT recommend!!! Really ZERO stars.
Guy C.,Oakland  CA,0,13,,8/16/2015,1.0,Tortilla soap was really good  my steak was very over cooked and tiny and my son was trying to figure out why they toast his bread bowl for his soup. Then he bit into the stale bread
Johnny G.,San Jose  CA,215,140,72,1/11/2014,2.0,2 stars..benefit of the doubt that they maybe still new? otherwise a true 1 star experienceThis place gets packed for happy hour..pretty intense.. It was an hour wait on tables to sit inside. Luckily the night we went it was nice and not too cold outside. We were able to sit outside under the heat lamps. Really nice patio furniture they had. On to the experience. A couple of my friends got seated before I came. One of them ordered a drink. The drink was a cocktail and was delivered with no straw..uhh ok. She asked the waitress for a straw when the waitress took our order. After she left about 10 minutes later..still no straw. It was almost like straw-gate. Where have all the straws gone? We had to waive down another person who was delivering food to another table. She gave us a straw finally  a kids straw  one that bends. We all had a good laugh about it.As usual I never had an issue with BJ's food and im a sucker for their flatbred pizza. They have changed the happy hour menu to now have $4  $5  and $6 deals instead of previous happy hour menu.One of my friends ordered calamari as an app. We all got our food. His entree came out before the calamari and we were like no worries  we can still eat it! Sadly the calamari never came. When we asked about it they said they go check on it. 15 minutes later we had to waive another person down to go check on it. When our waitress came back we decided since its been 30 minutes pass we will skip on the calamari.This BJs service is terrible. I heard other tables complaining about the service and the manager at the time looked like a deer in headlights.
Armando B.,San Jose  CA,81,1,15,11/7/2015,5.0,Mike (the bar tender) went thru an extensive questioner of beers and emotions. Every suggestion was matched with an exact beer which matched the emotions of the party. Even after multiple questions the bar tender provided the most serperv performance. Will order from this bar again.
Mike S.,Santa Clara  CA,56,19,6,3/14/2016,1.0,"Wow  just wow. Based upon our experience at BJ\'s  it seems that they are trying to go out of business. Start with waiting for 30 minutes while staring at empty tables. If I have to wait 30 min because the restaurant is jammed ok  but with multiple empties no no no. Perhaps someone called in sick so maybe not such a big deal. So upon getting seated our waiter promised to ""take care"" of us. He ignored us. our food was brought by other servers and cold no less. I ordered the prime rib and it was everything but prime. As my side I got vegetables. They advertise fresh never frozen food  and the food was clearly frozen. The sub-prime rib (which I ordered med rare and came med well) was dry and inedible. The veggies were more like veggie crumbs  Wife\'s burger was not any better. Had to wait an eternity to get a refill of water  and had it not been for a neighboring table asking for water  we would not have gotten it. We had no utensils or napkins to start  and that neighboring table had to borrow our ketchup  I only finished the veggies due to the fact that I haven\'t eaten all day. I decided to try to drown my steak in A1 to try to make it somewhat edible to no avail. So $35 is normally a decent price for a dinner for two  in this case it was a total rip-off and an epic fail. I should have worn my GoPro so I could submit the footage to FailArmy."
Mehari A.,San Jose  CA,2,12,3,4/23/2015,5.0,Best restaurant by far. I have had two of my birthdays at this place and they have never let me down. You do not wait for too long to get a table and their food and customer service is superb. I have yet to find a restaurant that would beat this. Last but not least  no parking scarcity problem.
Andra C.,San Jose  CA,179,26,5,1/23/2014,2.0,PROS:-Food is usually decent.-Open late.-Nice ambiance.-Offers its own micro brews.CONS:-Service is exceptionally slow from beginning to end.-Food has been botched on a handful of occasions. Comped only once.-Wait staff is apathetic.
Alicia S.,San Jose  CA,110,12,43,3/11/2015,1.0,I've always been a fan of BJ's the restaurant so I was happy that they opened this location because it's much closer to my house than the Oakridge location.Low and Behold- They're terrible. The first few times I went the food was eh but I didn't really mind because I went right when the location opened so I figured they were still working the kinks out  no big deal. I hadn't gone for a while and I moved really close by so I've gone a lot more lately. The last 3 or 4 times I had always sat in the cocktail area. Mostly figured for the happy hour and never really thought twice about it because I had a good experience. This last time I went I sat in the dining room because it was Saturday and there was no happy hour. Huge mistake. I got there around 11:15 so still about 45 minutes until they close. Our server  Michael Y  didn't greet us for about 10 minutes. And when he finally came we ordered drinks and the three of us also asked for waters. He came back and only brought two waters.. okay thanks? Whatever. Then he came another 10 minutes later and took our order. I asked him to take off the mayonnaise on my order and change the side from salad to french fries. Not that hard right? My boyfriends entree has a choice of rice and he chose brown rice with his chicken. When he brought our food my boyfriends chicken has the rice pilaf  my turkey burger had nothing but lettuce (when its supposed to have other toppings) the burger bun was black from being burnt and he brought me the salad instead of fries. He completely ignored everything we had asked. He didn't want anything to do with us. He would walk away when I would ask him for something and he just didn't do any of the modifications we asked. When he could tell I was dissatisfied with my entree he asked if I still wanted it  at this point I was over it so I just gave it back to him. And the manger did come by and talk to me so I can appreciate that. And he said he was going to take my entree off the bill  but he said it like he was doing me a favor... I didn't even eat it. I'm not going to pay for it. Either way  the whole thing was a waste of my time and super disappointing. Terrible service and my entree looked disgusting. I hesitated giving one star because in the cocktail area I've had two servers specifically that I really like. But this experience was terrible and makes me not want to support this location.Note to everyone: Just sit in the cocktail area if you must go to this location.
Sunny S.,San Jose  CA,0,3,,11/15/2015,3.0,"I mostly love BJs in Cupertino but this one has some issues with the servers. One time  I ordered a drink and they got the wrong one thinking I would not know the right drink. I had to literally tell the manager by showing on google on how they made me the wrong drink and were still trying to fool me. Another time  I ordered a drink and got the wrong one and when I asked the server to fix it  he gave a very sarcastic answer - ""Of course Sir  I can change the drink"" with a smirk on his face. Then he sent another server to serve the drink. I do not like their attitude at this location. While in general BJs is great but this one requires their servers to be a little more polite. And this place is pretty loud."
Keoni G.,South San Francisco  CA,150,121,1,3/18/2014,2.0,Service was horrible. First time I went for lunch. Took over an hour to get my food.Second time I went last night. Got there at 8:15pm. Server was super nice but not his fault of how long the food takes. Took a half hour to get our drinks from the bar (8:45pm) Appetizer came out at 9:00 ish and they forgot to give us silverware. Food came out 9:15 with silverware. Ordered chicken pasta  cooks forgot to put chicken on the order so waited another 20 mins. We finished dinner at 10:30 because we waited a while for the check. The actually server was the only good thing. Super nice and apologetic. Not sure if I'd go back.
Ethan H.,San Jose  CA,27,3,2,1/29/2015,4.0,Good food. Good beer. Great for post-season games. The prices are a bit high but if you can swing it  I recommend highly. The workers try. Bobby at the bar is top notch!
Brian L.,San Jose  CA,59,76,,4/1/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,What a difference a year makes. This time when I went back recently I had a great experience. Friendly host staff to the friendly servers and of course great food. Well done BJ's. I hope this a trend that continues.
Cat F.,Milpitas  CA,283,45,40,5/9/2014,3.0,Food items here aren't amazing... However the service is really good! Came here recently for happy hour  and the menu selection was not very large. Wished they could have a larger happy hour food selection. Drinks are alright  nothing special.But  this place does become quite packed around 6 PM so make sure to come early!
Malia W.,Tacoma  WA,118,343,362,12/7/2013,2.0,"After reading the horrible reviews about service I just had to see for myself. I almost didn\'t believe what people were talking about. Usually BJ\'s is pretty legit. Oh geez where do I start! Well we walk in for a weekday lunch. We were ""seated"" ""immediately"". I say ""immediately"" because yes we didn\'t have to wait but we did have to walk through a jungle of bags and chairs. The row was too small while on the other side of the island table there was ample room. The employees I guess didn\'t measure the aisles before seating a group of 20+ people. Thought it was some what of a fire hazard. Anyways  I say ""seated"" because the hostess knew we were a party of 2 yet when we got to our table it was occupied by a group. She looked at us confused then asked if we were in that group. We said no and I suggested to her that there\'s an open booth behind us  can we just sit there? She said  ""Sure I think"" and sat us down. After that weird interaction we meet our waitress and she was great. I had no complaints about her. I ordered the strawberry patch mixed drink. It had fresh cut strawberries with grey goose and other stuff. A truly girly drink. But oh so good. I couldn\'t taste the alcohol at all  yet felt good after drinking it. No complaints about the bartenders. While waiting for our food a waiter dropped and broke a few plates in front of us. Had nothing to do with us  just had to add that in. We ordered the calamari for our app. My husband asked me  ""How do you like the lukewarm calamari?"" Which pretty much sums up how we felt about our appetizer. Some of it was kind of warm and some were actually cold. Then came our small deep dish Mediterranean pizza. The guy who brought it out asked if we\'d like anything else. So we ordered some ranch dressing. After waiting 15 minutes for the ranch to come out and seeing the guy walk past us 3 times since  I figured that was a no on the ranch. So I started to eat the pizza then. It tasted great  no complaints. So to sum it up  service is the big issue! I think I\'ll wait some time until I visit again. Maybe they need some more time to get there stuff together. How long have they been open??"
Kay D.,San Jose  CA,0,28,,4/18/2016,1.0,This is my one and done visit. I will never come back here again. I always passed by this place and wanted to eat here. The service was bad from the moment I walked in from the server who brought us to the table. The actual waitress was extremely slow and didn't have an improved attitude from the first person who sat us. On top of that  they didn't explain the beer very well. I wanted to try the house brew but the waitress confused me. I asked for a refill on our regular drinks and it took about 20 minutes. I looked over my shoulder and the waitress was taking another order from a different table. I wanted to like this place  but I should have checked Yelp first before trying it out. There's a reason why this place has a two star rating.
Kristin Y.,Sunnyvale  CA,10,29,77,4/30/2014,5.0,Ordered the italian styled Margherita pizza for appetizer  grilled chicken and asparagus for entree  the endless strawberry lemonade for drinks  and the beignet with ice cream for dessert. All was delicious especially if you like thin crunchy crust pizza which I absolutely LOVE :). Beignets are my most favorite dessert and surprisingly  in my opinion  BJ's has the BEST BEIGNETS in the South Bay! I highly recommend the beignets here  I truly do.
Tom L.,San Jose  CA,147,22,1,10/9/2013,1.0,"very disappointing experience  this location is not off to a good start. Lousy management  I highly recommend just driving to Oakridge (or Fremont if you live north). I called in to check the wait ""how long is the wait for 2?"" ""it\'s 20 minutes"" I was then ASKED ""would you like me to put you on the list?"" ""yes  we\'ll be there shortly"" We arrived about 20 minutes later (wed night  no A\'s  no Sharks). The person ahead of us had walked in and been quoted a 20 minute wait for walk ins. We reached the host and we\'re also told 20 minutes (Seems like a pretty common quote of time at this point). I let the host know we called in and were put on the ""call in list."" She seemed very confused and immediately got her manager. The manager then explained again the wait was 20 minutes. I let her know we called in  she then began to explain some odd process of the time they quote over the phone is really half the time of the actual wait in the restaurant..............I tried to simplify the conversation ""what was the advantage of me calling ahead and being put on a call list if the walk in ahead of me is quoted the exact same amount of time I\'m being quoted right now?"" She then re-explained the process of quoting half wait times over the phone. Anyhow  I think she completely missed the point I was making (or refused to acknowledge it). There was ZERO benefit of me calling ahead and being put on a ""list."" ""we\'re still a new location  they\'re learning  it\'s dinner time"" She then told me to wait ""25-30 minutes"" seriously??? incredible. Not dinner time for me apparently! Guess I better deal with this learning curve they\'re having :)This was actually my second visit. The first I was turned away entirely because they weren\'t officially open and I was told you needed a special reservation in advance. (no i didn\'t call ahead  maybe thats why I did this time!!)In any case  no I didn\'t expect to walk in and be seated immediately  it\'s BJs  always busy. I\'ve been to oakridge  been to fremont. I go quite often actually . but to quote me the exact same or MORE time and to take zero action to make it right? Even make excuses implying that I misunderstood? Incredibly lousy servicebest part was the manager seemed surprised we weren\'t going to wait based on the experience. would you??? We chose to have dinner elsewhere."
Freeda L.,San Jose  CA,10,13,1,9/30/2015,1.0,It's the little things that make a big difference. I have been to this location a number of times and am always left feeling like it was a bad experience. The Oakridge location is much better  and because we go there all the time  I usually expect this place to be as good but the food and service never measures up. Today I waited for over ten minutes to get ketchup for my hamburger  and by the time I got it  the hamburger was cold  soggy and soaked with grease and gross.
Alex B.,Elk Grove  CA,17,92,159,3/10/2015,1.0,Slow  plain and simple. If you have a two hour lunch break then please by all means stop in. I was with four other of coworkers and from the time we were seated to our food hitting the table it was 45 minutes. My food took an other five minutes because per the waitress fish takes longer to cook. I guess it could be a good reason however two other people at the table ordered salmon. With so much other options in San Jose and even in close to this location you are better eating elsewhere.
Kyle Y.,San Jose  CA,81,203,296,3/7/2014,2.0,Worst service I've experienced in quite some time. She said she was new  in which I can cut her some slack but don't be shelling out excuses for your mishaps. Forgetting drink orders and disappearing for extended periods of time. No excuses  rookie!!!The food was subpar: the pizza didn't taste up to the standard from previous trips to this establishment. The potato skins were the size of my pinky finger. Chili's serves a legitimate size potato skin. I suggest you take notes. I'm hesitant to go here during my lunch break because I'll be waiting for my food all day. So far the worst Bjs restaurant I've been to
Paula V.,San Francisco  CA,453,74,77,1/14/2014,1.0,Read my friend Kim D.'s review for more info about how disorganized the workers were in accommodating for our friend's party of 17.I am giving a one star because of the service and food. First of all  I can tell when a waitress is displeased when she clearly rolls her eyes while she is taking orders. Waiting impatiently does not make me or time go any faster. The one star is for her separating all of our checks. But in doing so she also got peoples' drinks messed up  overcharged and undercharged others and paid off people with cash instead of taking the hit for it and redoing the charges. The food was terrible. I got the French dipped roast beef and the Au Jus was way too salty. It was not meat juices (as it should be) but pure sodium heart attack. I had to use HORSERADISH to mellow out the sodium. And had it not been for those thin fries I would have gone hungry. Only pluses were that the waiters and waitresses were good at refilling drinks (soda) BUT not water. And they split the check for our large party instead of charging an 18% gratuity. All I can say is never coming back here again.
LeDodo A.,San Jose  CA,91,85,19,5/27/2014,5.0,Been dining and drinking at the bar here for over a year nowNever had problems with wait-time.Desiree' waited on our table the other day and she was very sweet and polite.
Alejandro C.,San Jose  CA,4,2,,6/28/2015,5.0,Very good experience compared to my past experiences here. This place is always good but not great. Our server  Esteban was excellent. Checked up on us every time someone dropped a drink or plate to ensure it was good. Small mix up with our dessert and he replaced it and took it off our check. Not necessarily looking for free food but he insisted. Good guy  great service! We will be back :)
Debbie T.,San Jose  CA,22,69,,2/20/2016,2.0,Hostess is really incompetent. She said we would be seated right away. 10 mins later we ask if we're going to be seated and she said they ran out of menus so that's why it's taking long. A group came in after us and were seated right away outside (with menus -_-) . Another group comes in and they were getting seated. The host did not do anything until we asked her again. The waiter was great but front staff really need to be retrained
Neil L.,San Jose  CA,0,5,,9/20/2015,5.0,Bryant C at BJ's is a fantastic server!! He was entertaining  engaging  and humorous while at the same time very attentive making sure we had everything we need and everything was alright.Bryant totally made another good meal at BJ's a very fun and pleasurable lunch experience.Thank you Bryant!!Neil Love
David N.,San Jose  CA,309,67,88,12/28/2013,3.0,Had to plan a last minute get together for my friend's birthday. Simply wanted some drinks and appetizers over some nice conversations without too many disruptions. Theres always chile's ... apple bee's ... TGIF... etc. but if you want to do something fairly nicer for a friend you either take em to yardhouse or BJs. We settled with BJs regardless of the horrible ratings it earned thus far.BJs being a chain ... it just doesn't make sense for the newer location to be worse .. If anything  it should be at least as good as or better than its predecessors. The reviews I have been reading are mad horrible though. We ended up having a party of about 10-12. Took about a 30 minute wait because i did not make any reservations (I didn't think it was necessary based on the reviews). Ordered some drinks right when we got seated. Snake Bites  Buffalo Bites  their in house brews  etc... It was all good. Got our appetizers which was mainly calamari  sliders  and avocado eggrolls. Everything was as expected based off my experiences at other BJs. Nothing new. The pizookie's are always great. I thank god they did not ruin the pizookie.. Our waiter was very patient and considerate. Above everything else  the birthday boy had a good time and that was all i could ask for. This particular BJs got the job done.
Andrea G.,San Jose  CA,3,26,6,8/6/2015,1.0,"It\'s unfortunate that this location has such poor service  because the food is decently good and the beer is cold. I\'ve come to eat lunch here twice during the weekday. My partner has come probably five times to the point that he has seen the same bartender every time. I don\'t want to blame the bartender- as she looks generally unhappy at her job. It is often difficult to get her attention for either a beer  a napkin a sauce and or the check. She doesn\'t check in enough with her customers to see how they are doing which is partly the problem. And despite being there all the time doesn\'t know the menu and is often not very thorough. And at lunch there are few customers. On several occasions when our glass was given to us either by the bartender or other servers they were carrying the glass by the lip- where eventually I will drink from the glass. This is just poor form  u don\'t hold the glass from here because it\'s unsanitary. It has been a buildup of several small things here at this location that ultimately amount to poor service and poor management.My partner asked to see the manager on our way out. A woman appeared named Joanne  after about 5-7 minutes waiting for her  she was the manager. Myself nor my partner have ever seen her here  as she is not walking around the floor  though she claimed she had seen us. When my partner let her know he was unhappy with the service as I mentioned above including the last straw when the server had his thumb in his salad due to carrying it wrong  she responded  ""well I\'ve seen you here for the last hour and your cup has been full the whole time "" among other statements  none of which were ""I am sorry."" She not only implied that he was likely drunk she also implied that his account of how service was being delivered was false. This manager needs to be better at customer service  actually manage and train her staff better  and listen to feedback. Rather than acknowledge my partners feedback she defensively tried to turn the tables. I\'ll admit he was unhappy but she definitely did not handle the situation as a manager should. I think the overall yelp 2.5 stars speaks to this  we are not alone in our dissatisfaction. We will not be returning to this location and we hope the manager reads this and improves her site."
Jane L.,San Jose  CA,1,18,3,2/10/2014,2.0,"I had high expectations for this place because I heard good things about the Pizookie.And it\'s actually delicious. So +1 star.-1 star because of how long it took for them to notice we were long done on deciding our order. 15 min done actually. And then the following 15 min of not receiving our drinks.-1 because of how we already got 2 entrees before our appetizer even came  which by the way took 45 min. And it never arrived because they forgot to make it. We were also asked ""Do you still want the stuffed mushrooms?""Well if we asked about them wouldnt we want them?Not wanting to wait another 45 min for it to get to is we decided to not have it anymore. And yet  when we asked for the check  it still appeared on it. -1 because I ordered a pizookie  and after 30 min our server asked if we got our dessert. How is it that she wouldn\'t know if she is the only person serving us? And by only person I really mean it.All other servers refused to make eye contact while we were trying to flag them down.+1 Because one of the managers did come to apologize that the appetizer still showed up on the bill  and offered to give us a free desert  which was nice and redeeming.The food wasn\'t bad  but it wasn\'t something to brag about either.I\'m willing to try a different location  as I feel like the only thing that truly dampened our dinner was the service."
Christie A.,San Jose  CA,4,11,,6/22/2015,5.0,Honestly the best service I've had here in a while. I normally ask for Denea but tonight we had Davina. She was awesome! Our dance group usually comes here on Monday nights and luckily we were seated in her area. Our dance group is usually very needy and tonight Davina was totally on it. She never once left us with empty glasses and was super attentive. I am very happy with her service and highly recommend getting seated with her. She is GREAT!
Kim N.,South Bay  CA,2933,9788,53890,10/16/2013,3.0,I was thinking this was going to be perfect for Sunday football with some friends. Turns out  though this is nice and new  they dont nearly have the TV coverage as the Cupertino one. That one has the giant mega tv wall where you can watch all 8 series of the NBA and NHL first round playoff games at the same time. Here  there's a handful of tv's scattered throughout and someone kept changing the channels. ugh. service is friendly and helpful. THe roast beef horseradish au jus sando was not as good as I remembered though prob cause it was a bit lukewarm. Friend like the gluten free pizza  and the black cherry and cream soda on tap are solid. 3.5 stars
Andrew R.,San Jose  CA,190,133,45,3/24/2014,1.0,Oh BJ's well this Coleman location  you've failed me. Came in after a soccer game and everyone was starving. Our server came over to introduce herself and first thing she said was 'I know this isn't an excuse but I have seven other tables so I might be awhile'..... Um okay. Thanks? Well she wasn't lying  we waited 20 minutes for our beer and another fifty for our food. I thought we were on a hunger strike. Our food finally came out and we were ecstatic  ready to dive in the food was cold. The worst part of the trip was closing out our check  I wanted to use their loyalty coupon for five dollars off. Closing out took another thirty  what a mistake. Super disappointed and won't be back for a while. Oh and the cellphone reception is nonexistent at this restaurant  don't expect to receive iMessages or calls when you're in here.
Habitual Line S.,San Jose  CA,0,23,2,6/18/2015,1.0,I called from the airport after a long flight for a take out order. The take out group did not pickup the phone until 9 or 10 rings and placed me on a 15 minute hold  which I hung up on. I placed an online order since Bj's employees wouldn't pick up the phone. My order for two basic items for curbside pickup at 11pm on a Thursday was 25 minutes late. I now get why this location has 2 stars. I do not understand how Bj's in Cupertino can be so different than the Coleman location. I've had three bad encounters at this location and will never visit again. I spoke to the manager who seems some what apathetic to the issue  which only made my view of this franchise location worse. Don't waste your time here  go to Bj's in Cupertino or the far superior SP2 down the street. I have removed this location from my corporate lunch group and will be adding another restaurant to our list on Monday.
Vivian T.,San Jose  CA,68,11,24,5/15/2015,2.0,We were greeted by the hostess that was chewing gum and not once made eye contact nor smile. It was very off putting and unpleasant. I think the entire front staff could use an upgrade!
Amanda H.,Santa Clara  CA,16,11,4,3/6/2015,5.0,My husband and I are huge fans of this restaurant  this was our first time at this location and we were not disappointed. We were promptly greeted and seated. Our waitress Kathy was great and provided excellent service. The food was yummy and the atmosphere was nice. We will absolutely be returning.
Bang A.,Santa Clara  CA,203,53,12,11/9/2014,1.0,WORST SERVICE EVER! Our server disappeared part of the way through our meal. NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. When he finally shows up  he apologizes and says that his friend was on the phone with him outside because he was having problems with his car. Thanks for apologizing and owning up to it  but dude  we waited for 30 minutes for you to take our order. AND THEN we got no refills on water and drinks. Our food came out cold by another server. I'm guessing the other server saw our food just sitting there forever and realized our server wasn't going to bring us our food. At least we got our food? His verbal apology was not worth the long wait! Especially because it was late and we just wanted to have a quick easy dinner.
ryan h.,San Jose  CA,7,50,,5/12/2014,4.0,I don't get why this place got so many negative reviews- we've had nothing but good experiences here. We always sit at the bar because we adore Erin  the bartender. She's super attentive and friendly  and has her own cult following  it seems :) We've sat next to several regulars who've said they specifically come when she's working. She always remembers what we drink- I'm a big fan of their beer selection  especially their Pirhana Ale.We generally order off the appetizer menu- pretty straight forward American fare. The wings and the sliders are great. We've also had the French dip and burgers- both very good.A lot of times  this place is a madhouse  especially on game days. I can see why many people complain about the service. That's why we always sit at the bar- closer to the beer!I gave this location and Erin a great review on their site  and got a personalized email from the General Manager  which I thought was a nice touch. They've got a great happy hour menu. Give this place a shot!
Alexa R.,San Jose  CA,12,7,,10/24/2013,2.0,"My experience here was terrible! A group of six friends including myself decided to come to this restaurant on a Monday night  because we thought we would be seated right away. WRONG! We had to put our names down and wait for a table to become available when......the whole restaurant was practically available!!! What is that?! The problem was that they couldn\'t find a waiter to wait on our table when.....THERE WAS A TON OF STAFF WORKING! We ended up waiting 20 minutes to be seated  three parties went ahead of us and when we finally got our table  we passed by a group of staff telling each other ""Ha ha they get the \'sh*tty\' table."" Um  talk about unprofessional! We should have left from the get-go but we didn\'t feel like eating at the Wingstop nearby and since we invested in all that time into getting seated  we thought might as well stay at the restaurant. The food was mediocre and our waiter was just okay.Definitely telling my friends to just stick to the BJ\'s by Oakridge or Cupertino. I\'ll only come back if I\'m seating myself at the bar -- wouldn\'t want the hostesses to fight over what waiter should cover what table."
Scotty G.,San Jose  CA,171,11,11,10/23/2015,2.0,I haven't posted in a long time  but for me to post something   it's a big deal. I got off work from a long shift and I wanted to order from door dash and give it a try  ordered my food wrote down my specific instructions and went from there. The only good thing about last night was the fact that my DoorDash driver was extremely nice  and showed up on time. The bad news however is that my order was wrong. I ordered the chipotle burger  no produce and cooked medium... The Burger came with the produce on it  and I have never seen a burger so bloody in my life. It was so rare there was a little puddle of blood in the Togo box and my fries that were suppose to be extra crispy went soggy from the blood. I couldn't eat it  and it was too late to call So I threw it away... The wings We ordered was just mediocre. This morning... I haven't been feeling good as well...With that said just want to say that the server should have checked the order  cooks should've checked the burger before giving it to door dash! Two stars to you  but great service from door dash! If any servers from this location would happen to read this ( I know you will because my work does as well) you guys are probably rolling your eyes are laughing  but you guys should've handled the food correctly and checked my order. I work with with the hospitality and food service so I should know.
Aash R.,Raleigh  NC,1,2,,4/2/2016,2.0,The waitress forgot half our orders ! We didn't even get the desserts! Although the beers are good !
Chris E.,Oakland  CA,1,23,,6/9/2014,2.0,Our server  Cassandra  was great. My boyfriend was worried his drink would be too strong  so she brought it half strength with the rest of the alcohol on the side so he could mix it as he liked it. She knew the menu  was helpful  and just all-around pleasant. However  I expect that this kind of place should be able to make a decent steak. I'm not expecting something high end  but the first one was well past well done. It was ordered medium well. The second one was a bit on the rare side of medium rare. The cook apparently didn't believe us  despite the juices running red. It was only when he was shown the inside that was nearly still raw that he accepted that it wasn't right.We were still charged for the steak.
Michelle V.,West San Jose  San Jose  CA,109,5,1,10/27/2013,2.0,BJ's  I love you and I hate you. I think I just hate that I love you. What can you honestly expect from the epitome of American dining? This is another installment in BJ's growing empire and it offers nothing new that you can't find at any other location.Ambiance-Dimly lit  almost too intimate for a chain restaurant serving pizza and a kids menu. Food-Consistent at best. You can't expect to taste anything exceptional here other than the already amazing pizookie. Service-Spotty. They try at times. It blows my mind that people will walk into an establishment like this and expect over the top service. This isn't Gary Danko  they focus on volume. Overall  if you want to indulge in food overloaded with calories and addicting qualities then by all means drive down to the new BJ's. Heck why not make it a family affair and bring your newly born and grandparents  servers will love you.
Selina F.,San Jose  CA,60,49,6,10/14/2013,4.0,Not bad but not quite worth the prices. I went with my family recently and since it was only around 1pm the wait wasn't very long. Our waitress was really nice and our order was perfect. I enjoyed the chicken sandwich I ordered with fries (you get a choice of thin cut or wedge fries). The only problem was the chicken was basically 3 strips inside a bun with tomatoes and sauce. Still tasted good but not really worth $10.
Anissa M.,San Jose  CA,104,5,3,6/5/2015,1.0,Waitress was nice when we first got seated  but after that she completely forgot about us. I understand it was a packed night but the only interaction we had was ordering our food and paying our bill. We didn't even get a water refill.
Evan T.,Saratoga  CA,0,3,1,7/17/2015,1.0,First of all  I wish there was a negative star. The day started well when I went with my family to the BJ brewery. We were asked to wait and that's understandable but once we were seated I was overcome with the lack of care for customers. We started by getting our drinks... Which took 20 minutes and ended up ordering. A 20-30 minute wait for the food is understandable but a hour wait just for a refill is complete s!$&! Overall this experience was revolting and appalling and I would hate to come back to this heinous restaurant ever again.-24/0 stars
Enrique M.,San Jose  CA,74,45,31,4/28/2014,4.0,After reading all these low rating reviews  I was a little skeptical about coming here. However  I'll give BJ's the benefit of the doubt and hope that my experience here would not be as bad.  I came here for a birthday celebration with a group of 5 people.  We had no trouble getting a table. I really don't understand all these people who are hating on the service  the service was perfectly fine to me. Actually a little better than most places. Our server was always checking up on us  made sure we always had water  she even joked with us. For BJ's I'll admit  the food is always consistent. We got two pizza's to share  calamari  and stuffed mushrooms and they were spot on.The place was dimly lit kinda set a relaxed mood.Overall great place  not as good as my main BJ's on De Anza Blvd  but none the less a solid place to go to. I'll most likely come back.
Nicole L.,Albuquerque  NM,176,48,180,3/2/2014,4.0,15mins wait for a party of 3 on a busy Sunday dinner rush. The server was excellent. We had the mahi mahi tacos and jalapeo burger with crispy thin fries. The mozzarella and tomato salad was Ah-mazing!! The presentation and taste was 5 stars! Minus one star for the dessert that took a while to come out. B
Eat F.,Pittsburgh  PA,0,9,3,10/11/2013,4.0,Went to Bj's with a group of 6 for lunch.  Three of the orders were messed up. The entire meal time was over 2 and a half hours. Many of my co workers said they will not be back....However  I thought my meal was awesome. I loved the server she was awesome  and it couldn't have been all her fault. I tried the October fest beer and it was amazing. My burger jalapeno something was the best thing ever! I even had specific request for it  and everything was done how I asked. So  I will be back. I give it 4 stars. Just won't be taking a client  or a large group there again.
Mishy N.,San Jose  CA,98,93,17,12/4/2015,1.0,"BJ\'s almost killed my daughter today. Ok  well maybe I\'m exaggerating a bit BUT when I order online and put a note that clearly says FOOD ALLERGY they should pay close attention. Ordered online for dine-in at 12:15. Somehow I live in a delusional little world where I think that ordering ahead of time somehow speeds up the process. At 12:50 the food finally comes but my daughter\'s sandwich comes with peppers on it (the ingredient I said she is allergic too). Sadly I work for the man (aka the government) so I only have an hour for lunch. The server takes the food back and says the manager is going to ""expedite"" the order. In the meantime my daughter gets to eat a plate of French fries for lunch  parenting fail. Server comes back to report the manager is going to comp both sandwiches (gee thanks). I asked for the sandwich to come back in a box because we needed to leave  oh and can we have the check please. Oh and the sandwich did NOT come back boxed. She says oh well since the sandwiches were comped do you still want to use your $10 reward. Yes  dummy I do because I don\'t think I\'m ever returning so I might as well get my money\'s worth today. Now the check comes  wait for it.....Sure enough they comped the two sandwiches but then CHARGED me for the re-made sandwich. Are you sh*tting me! Then when I bring it to our server\'s attention  she clearly didn\'t understand so I had to speak to the manager. In her defense  the manager was very apologetic and did give us a gift card to use ""next time"". I really like the food at BJ\'s  they have good happy hour deals and the pizookies are yummy  but every time I go there I get so mad that I feel like I have a developed a case of Tourettes and can\'t stop cussing and want to throw dishes on the floor and squirt ketchup all over the booth as I\'m leaving. Lunch is supposed to be a relaxing  enjoyable break from work. BJ\'s makes me a hostile lunatic. Pass."
Sara L.,San Jose  CA,3,5,,7/9/2015,5.0,I love this place ! Is very convenient for me because is close to my house  they always treat me nice and I love that is not too pack like the one at Santana Row  you have to wait like two hours just to get a table! The other day I showed up with a party of 12 and they gave me a table within 20minutes of waiting without even having a reservation
Claudia L.,San Jose  CA,1,28,6,1/8/2014,2.0,Came here on a Monday night because hubby was craving BJ's. Hostess asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar area and we said okay  and just told us to sit where ever. We got a booth seat by the bar. I assumed this was part of the bar area because it was in the general area  but no wait staff came and greeted us or gave us menus. Keep in mind  it was 8:30PM on a Monday night... they weren't exactly busy. After 10 minutes  I finally walked up to the bar and asked for two menus.8 minutes after that  a wait staff finally came around. She took our order. I ordered a soup and salad and asked specifically to hold the bleu cheese. Hubby ordered an ahi-tuna salad and a beer. We shared an avocado roll appetizer.My soup and salad came first. Nobody gave us utensils so we sat there for a good 5 minutes  until our waitress finally came around with utensils (she was apologetic). My salad was covered with bleu cheese. I didn't want to make a fuss so I just grumpily ate the gross cheese while drenching my salad in honey mustard.I ate for about 25 minutes while my husband waited for his ahi-tuna salad. Finally  we told the waitress that we'd been waiting forever for his salad. She was apologetic (again) and rushed in and brought out the salad. It must have been sitting in the kitchen for the past 15 minutes and no one bothered to bring it out. Last time something like this happened at the Cupertino BJ's  they comped the dish. Didn't do it here (not that we were looking for it  but it's a testament to their service).Also didn't help that the waitress at the table behind us seemed to know the diners sitting behind us. She kept coming back to them and chatting about personal stuff while lingering around.When it came to get the check  our waitress was nowhere to be found for 10 minutes. Ugh  so frustrating. They really need to up the level of their service and professionalism. I've never experienced anything like this at the other BJ's.
Christina P.,Santa Cruz  CA,13,36,2,4/22/2015,3.0,I've had my ups and downs with this BJ's  but I go back relatively often because there are plenty of options on the menu and on the TVs for whatever game is on. The food and service are both pretty inconsistent. I usually get the same thing  balsamic glazed chicken  but it has come out to me cold or missing sauce multiple times. They have a pretty decent happy hour  but everything is half the size. Their strawberry mojitos are pretty delicious! Even though they don't take smaller reservations  you can usually call while you're on your way and they'll put you on the wait list. This has worked for me a couple of times  but once I was waiting for nearly an hour and a half for my friends birthday! (Excluding the 15 minutes it took me to get there after calling). Overall  I'll go back because I can't seem to stay away and they have pretty decent stuff and a good atmosphere  but just very inconsistent!
Rox R.,San Jose  CA,83,319,32,10/3/2013,4.0,If I could give this place a 41/2 stars  I would. The service was great! I couldn't make the soft opening but I can tell  they put a great effort to train their staff well. The gentleman who first served us was great. He was followed by another young lady and she was fine. You can tell they were getting ready for a big lunch crowd. I feel bad for chili's!The person who brought our pizza to the lady who collected our check were all very friendly. My husband thought the bathroom was beautiful and very clean. Yes  it's a new place with a new car feeling.So  the food.. We came for the party for 2.Wedge salad was good. Pizza is great. Soft dough with a lovely hint of garlic. Ham was excellent. What wasn't excellent was the lack of tomato sauce? Little tomato drops is not the deep dish of Chicago?But still good.Pizzuki...ghiradelli chocolate chunk was amazing. My husband had to keep up with me otherwise it would have been gone in a flashbite.Getting the change back from the bill took a little long considering we had to get going for work and a tired baby.Root beer. Yum! Vanilla cream soda? Delish..had a Carmel/vanilla flavor. We will have beer next time. Yep  can't wait to go back with my premiere card. And I would go to watch a sports game..bummer you can't hear the game  but that's pretty typical in this area.
Christine D.,San Jose  CA,12,1,,5/20/2014,1.0,Place has the worse service  ever. Asked a lady who ran our food for gravy and butter and she never came back for it. And the male server we had sucked. If only I got his name I would totally put him on blast. He approached every table but ours  I sat there staring at him waiting for him to acknowledge us  but he just walked the other direction completely ignoring me. Didn't even seem busy  he took on like 4 table of 2 people and couldn't even make the effort to refill our drinks or ask if we needed anything else. Can't believe I spent more than 1 hour sitting there than even eating.. This server needs to realize that we as customers might have other things to do with our lives than sitting in a restaurant for hours just waiting to get service. Horrible  horrible  horrible. This place is not the place to have a quick nice dinner.
D J.,Santa Clara  CA,0,6,1,1/16/2014,1.0,so I ordered the Moroccan Spiced Salmon plate and it did NOT look like the one on the picture on the menu  the salmon was half or less of size from the picture menu.then the waiter comes and tells me  is because is a low calorie plate HA! I knew it was a low calorie plate  but this one was no dinner. and it taste it bad!
Jennifer H.,Milpitas  CA,154,17,2,11/10/2014,1.0,I would give this place a zero if I could! Beware.. About to go on a rant!!-It was my sisters birthday party and it was a Sunday night. We understood it would be busy. I called ahead and told them we had a party of 12 coming. The girl on the phone was nice. We got there and she said it would be about an hour before we were seated. Understandable. So we were waiting... And waiting..... And waiting... An hour passes and we're patient cus they're busy. We get that. But then we've waited for about 2 hours till we got seated. When we got seated they were missing two chairs..... Really? You had it written down for 12 people. Anyways we just grabbed our own chair and got everyone seated OURSELVES. Sat for about 10 mins before any servers came to our table to introduce themselves... Cool. We had two waiters Carlo and another fellow. Forgot his name. Worst service ever. We ordered right when we sat down cus we were starving and had been looking at the menu for almost 2 hours outside waiting to be seated. It took another hour for our food to come out. But 4 of our burger orders were cold and my plate didn't come out. I waited and waited and 10 mins later they said they have to make it again because anther waiter grabbed it..... By then the whole table had finished eating and my food hasn't even gotten out yet. I understand you can't blame our waiter completely but there were TWO waiters for our party and they couldn't even handle it? Seriously? What made it worse was that they laughed when I was angry my food wasn't out. Then left our table and gave us another waiter. I believe his name was David. He was probably the best. He made up for all there slack. Carlo never asked about my sisters birthday and pizookie whereas David gave me my meal free and apologized and gave her a free pizookie but that didn't make up for everything. WE CHOSE YOU GUYS TO HAVE HER BIRTHDAY DINNER. A SPECIAL BIRTHDAY. AND YOU GUYS FAILED. Never coming back...
Becky W.,San Jose  CA,96,103,562,2/26/2014,5.0,Food is good. Pazookies are good. Just service is great now !!!!
Klara G.,San Jose  CA,3,11,,10/14/2013,2.0,Really unprepared staff... I almost felt bad for our server who stated he didn't know what a Black and Tan was (it's even on the menu) and then after 5 min of waiting for our drinks  he says that he wasn't sure where the Black and Tan button was on their POS... Seriously? Why don't you ask someone  like your manager? Anyways  he finally let us know he found it only to come back 10 min later (I had to ask a random server for at least a glass of water at this point) saying the root beer keg had to be changed and there were only a couple people who knew how to change one.. At a brewery?!?!?! Seriously  20 minutes in  my hubs gets his drink and we get our appetizer and the main courses all arrive at the same time... So much for the timing! I still don't have a root beer... By the time I'm done with my main meal  he brings it out in a hot  fresh out of the dishwasher  mug... Well if it's gonna arrive at the end of my meal  at least make it cold! Anyways  the food was decent so that part was ok but the lack of knowledge and management really took it's toll on us. It's one thing to see our server running around with his head in the clouds but it's another to watch the manager flirt with the hostesses all night instead of doing his job. Obvious room for improvement and we won't return to this location for awhile.
Veeral S.,San Jose  CA,80,157,4,3/3/2014,1.0,I agree with many of the Other reviewers....the service here is TERRIBLE. Our waitress was very nice  but everybody besides her looked depressed to be working here. We didn't have enough utensil sets  so we had to use the napkins that came with our drinks. Another server slammed a plate on our table and just walked away (I don't know what we possibly did to make her hate us  because we had never seen her before the entire night). We didn't have enough spoons with our dessert  and had to ask several times for more.I would go to one of the other BJs in the area as they have far better service. It's really a night & day difference.
Alex K.,San Jose  CA,635,334,79,11/18/2013,1.0,The service was terrible.My cheese crusted chicken covered in cheese was delicious.Steak was bootsy.So this is how it feels to get raped by BJs.
Cold D.,San Jose  CA,0,63,,12/3/2013,4.0,I did not read the Yelp reviews before deciding to dine here. The GF and I arrived around 5:30 on a Monday afternoon. The placed was packed and we almost walked out because of the noise  it is rather loud here  but not as loud as other places I've been. We decided we could handle the noise so we stayed. We were seated quickly and our sever came right over.We ordered the soup and salad with a calamari appetizer. The calamari arrived within five minutes and was VERY good  nice and crispy  with a great flavor. The wedge salad was typical and also very good. The GF had the chicken tortilla soup and she said it was delicious. I had the chili and I must say  it was the best restaurant chili I've ever eaten. I also ordered an Imperial Stout from the beer menu and it was excellent!The service was great  and the food was great. We really enjoyed ourselves. Why not five stars? Well  I took a half-star for the noise level  it is just under the unbearable range for me. Another half-star was deducted because of children in the vicinity. I don't like to see kids in any type of bar and grill. It is not their place in my opinion. Otherwise  I will definitely return.I read the Yelp reviews before I posted this review and was surprised by the number of one and two star reviews. I can totally understand them for the place is rather large  and very busy during the dinner rush. My server's name was Luis and he was great. Ask for him if he is there when you visit.
Renee N.,San Jose  CA,104,63,26,2/23/2014,3.0,Overall  a good solid restaurant but nothing fancy. Pros:+ Minimal wait time. Maybe it's because this place is still new  but it's never been really hard to get a table  including times I've come here on a Friday night with no reservation. The longest I've had to wait for a table was about 7 minutes. + Good food. Food is not top-of-the-line  but it's pretty good. I personally love the baked potatoes  which they seem to only list on the lunch menu now. I've actually heard other people ask what happened to the baked potatoes during the dinner hour  so I know I'm not the only one who misses them. However  if you ask for a baked potato for dinner  they'll totally hook you up. + Friendly wait staff. Everyone I've interacted with at BJ's has been very friendly and helpful. Cons:- Some tables are very drafty. Twice when I've come here  they've sat me in a very drafty section near the wall. It honestly feels like you're outside and there's a cold breeze blowing in your face. I put up with it the first time  but the second time I asked to be moved. I noticed that the people they sat at the table after we moved also asked to change tables  and the waitress later told us all the tables along the wall had a draft problem. Hopefully someone fixes this!!- Don't come here for brunch. I really shouldn't hold this against them too much - this isn't a brunch place. But there aren't too many awesome brunch places in SJ and I was kind of getting desperate so I tried it out one morning. Do not do it! Everything tasted like it was just taken out of a freezer and reheated in the microwave.
Stephanie T.,San Jose  CA,35,148,18,2/23/2014,1.0,I'm a BJ's fan but bad experience with our server tonight. My friend ordered a bowl of soup and a few minutes later asked the server to make it the large bowl. Server acted annoyed because order was already in like it couldn't be done. Um just do it. Then friend found a HAIR in his soup. Told the server. Didn't get an apology  didn't take it off the bill...nothing. Not good service at all. My California chicken sandwich is always good but man...the hair siting is just so GROSS.
Masako K.,San Jose  CA,13,6,,8/7/2015,1.0,We've been to BJ's in Carlsbad (near Lego Land)  service was slow but got great food  so I thought other location should also be good  but it wasn't.We came to BJ's near airport for my son's birthday. I told our server that it was my son's birthday  so he got free ice cream which was nice. But no birthday song.It took away long to be served our meal  salmon was small and burned! Very disappointed.
Doug K.,San Jose  CA,42,22,1,10/27/2013,4.0,"I\'m giving them four stars because overall  the experience is good  food and beer is good  and I like the BJ\'s chain. But the service seems a bit ""uneven"" at this (new) location.... I have been going to BJ\'s since before they brewed beer... I am giving them the benefit of the doubt  since they\'ve been open for only about 3 weeks  but geez... Was seated today and seemingly abandoned... Wait staff serving nearby tables  and passing us numerous times - no greeting  no nothing.... I ended up going back up to the hostess stand and asking if we would soon be served...  They promised that someone would be with us soon... ""Stephanie G"" ended up waiting on us  although it was not her section... She was VERY nice and took good care of us. I would still give them a positive recommendation  and if you are looking for a place with a wide variety on the menu and good beer  plus sports on the numerous TV\'s around the place  BJ\'s will (hopefully) not disappoint...."
Christel L.,San Jose  CA,5,30,11,1/15/2014,1.0,I would give this place one and a half stars for poor service and mediocre food.My family of four waited for over thirty minutes for our food. A family of at least 6 or 7 people were seated at the table next to us after us. They ALL got their food before any of us did. We ordered a bison burger  brewhouse burger  bacon cheeseburger  and a veggie burger. All burgers (except for veggie) were cooked well-done and were dry. We asked for medium rare. The meat patties themselves were also just warm. They were not hot and did not look fresh.When we told this to the waiter  he stated that the wait is so long because they make their burgers fresh from the best ingredients. It sure didn't taste that way. I give that burger a 3/10. It was nothing special and definitely not worth the 30 minute wait. We also ordered a pizookie  which was the only good thing about this trip here.Our waiter was also not very attentive to us. He definitely was at the heels of the family sitting next to us though  making sure the game was on for them on the TVs  making sure they had all their condiments and extra drinks. Very poor service.The manager came up to us and asked how our experience was and we said we were pretty disappointed. He gave us free gift cards for an amount that would only be revealed when you use it. Thanks for the gesture  but I don't think I'm ever coming back to this location.
Emily G.,Wahiawa  HI,129,564,334,11/3/2013,4.0,I love BJ's restaurants so I was stoked to find out one was going to be opening up nearby. I went on a Monday night about a week or so after they had opened. They were super busy but we were only given a 5-10 minute wait and were sat within that time frame as promised. It was very noisy inside  so I had trouble talking with my boyfriend across the table. My drink order took some time to come out  but I had kinda expected that with their busy night. Our waitress was extremely nice and helpful though. She didn't know the answer to a question we had about the menu and she quickly asked a supervisor nearby and got the answer. The food was delicious too! If you go to BJ's  you pretty much have to get a pizzokie for dessert. Even if you aren't hungry any more  it's worth it.
Steve K.,Santa Cruz  CA,13,20,,5/5/2015,2.0,I had another business lunch at this BJ's today. The food was OK (just OK) and took a loooong time to arrive. From the time we were seated to the time our food was on the table was almost exactly one hour. The problem is that our last three lunches at BJ's have suffered from the same slow service. My colleagues and I all agreed that next time we will need to clarify our expectations when we first arrive.
Anna D.,Santa Cruz  CA,1,16,,3/31/2015,2.0,My family and I went to BJ's for dinner. It was convenient because we had just come from the airport. We arrived and were greeted and seated. There were very few people there  our waitress brought half of is water. We were very hungry  we had breakfast at 6:30. Then we quickly ordered  my daughter-in-law got a call so she went out side to take it. We waited and waited  40 min went by and we asked about food and she brought 2 then min later 1 more and min later the burger  and claimed burgers take longer. Then we ask for the rest of our drinks and our silverware and napkins. It was very poor service  the food was not bad  but not worth the wait.
Melissa R.,San Jose  CA,282,8,1,3/13/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"One star is ONLY for the food  well  my food which was great! I had the calamari as my entree. It was my birthday dinner and my server was terrible. She got my boyfriend\'s order wrong but a family member said it\'s fine  we\'ll share this since we\'re hungry until his actual meal comes out.She spilled beer on my nearly TWO year old cousin and her response was ""oh sorry"" and walked away.When the food order FINALLY came out my mom asked that it be comped since it took so long and she said ""oh he said he\'d pay for it so no"". WHAT THE HELL?!my cake came out and they sat it in front of my cousin and she said ""my bad I thought it was her birthday"" then when I had leftover cake she said we throw the boxes away  and handed me four different boxes to put pieces of my cake in.TERRIBLE SERVICE. Go to blossom hill location."
Barry M.,San Jose  CA,7,7,,7/27/2015,1.0,Second time I've came here and my burger is over cooked I swear chef must have been on a break or just not in the kitchen!service is great and friendly very prompt the server and and took my plate back to the kitchen and said a fresh one will be made to a med-rare. I'm in the food industry and a over cooked burger (well) is unacceptable unless asked for by the customer I won't be coming back here again
Alexandra G.,Milpitas  CA,73,216,136,3/5/2014,2.0,The only reason they get two stars is their soup and salad combo has wedge salad and clam chowder.Their wedge salad is not as good as outback. Their bleu cheese dressing is on the thinner side but it is not terrible.Their clam chowder is almost always very good. I say almost because a few times I've sent it back to be heated a bit more. I like my soup hot.Their service lacks for sure. At first I let it slide because they just opened and half the people probably lied on their application when it came to the serving part. But it has been a few months and still no improvement. Their kids pizza is awful don't waste your money. The crust is often burnt and stale. There is no sauce. They give maybe four pepperonis. My daughter loves pizza but not from this place.
Eli N.,San Jose  CA,7,63,5,10/11/2013,3.0,Not bad but nothing to write home aboutIf ya wanna try it out it's not bad just come when not packed cuz your gonna wait & wait & wait our server was real good and on too of it but as a new location they are having growing pains.food was good enough but since I'm pretty much at chef status I expect more flavor in my food.
James A.,Sunnyvale  CA,4,11,,6/5/2015,1.0,Waited 35 minutes to be seated after people who just walked in. Tables were left un bussed. And seating hostess thought it was funny that she seated the people a head of us. The manager had a less than concerned attitude.
Net C.,San Jose  CA,0,8,,4/22/2015,5.0,Pros: location  a lot of space  easy parking  excellent beers! I had a top sirloin once and it was really good.Cons: on a different occasion I tried the New York Steak but I didn't like it.
Steven H.,San Jose  CA,114,391,133,10/12/2013,5.0,Crowded but worth the wait!I think because this is a new location there's a lot of buzz. It should slow down to a normal pace but I'm really please w the layout of the restaurant and bar. I love that there are so many choices of beer. Everything from their home made brews to a variety of outside beers on tap as well. The food is always very good. Can also never go wrong ordering a Pazookie. I promised myself not to eat so much dinner next time so i will have room for delish dessert!
Sean H.,San Jose  CA,15,137,25,1/29/2014,2.0,I don't usually right reviews for restaurant chains but here it goes!Food: 2 stars Drinks: 4 starsServer: 4+stars Waiting time: -3starsMistakes: -1starOur food just wasn't all that  it wasn't horrid  but it was far from fantastic. The pasta was like paste  and quite bland. The burger my friend had  she said was ok. I had a bite at it was just so overwhelmingly greasy  and overcooked! Now the drinks were good! Nothing was too string  all good there! (Alcohol helps when the food isn't that great!) Now our server was really nice! Kathy! She was very sweet and helpful! She is the only reason this is at 2 stars! So props to her!Now we came in around 4:00 pm on a Thursday  no wait  not very crowded. We order an appetizer  and about two minutes later we order our food. Our food got there around 5 mins before the appetizer! (hmmm. kind of backwards??) .Then we order mixed drink refills which took just over around 20 mins  Now this was not our servers fault! She was trying to serve around 15 tables alone!Then we ordered a drink at the end  that didn't ever come. And were still charged! Took around 10-15 mins just for them to take it off! All in all I don't think ill be back any time in the future!
Eric T.,Santa Clara  CA,23,41,16,2/24/2014,1.0,I love BJ's  but my last visit at the restaurant on Coleman ave in San Jose was horrible. The server was rude and inattentive. Pizza was missing cheese. The wings only had five wings. The long forgotten salad finally arrived after the manager came by and asked how the meal is going. And the final mistake we made was ordering a pizookie which was burnt.The manager should have either comp'd the entire meal or fixed it  swapped waiters(it's kind if awkward receiving poor service from a waiter with his tail between his legs and still a poor job)  and last but not least  come back to the table to ensure the remainder of our night was satisfying. Not a big deal though. I will be going to the Cupertino location.
P G.,San Jose  CA,1,108,6,2/24/2014,3.0,Been here twice over the last 4 months  the service is very spotty  need more help in the kitchen and with wait staff. Food is OK  nothing great  I have been to other BJ's and liked them but this one has a long way to go in service and quality improvements.We called ahead to be put on the call in list and when we got there they said they would not honor the call in list...well  then they should not have taken our name and told us to be there in 20 minutes
Monica H.,San Jose  CA,924,683,955,12/18/2013,2.0,I am just not a fan of Chains. But my boyfriend and I were off to a country concert across the street; so we thought of getting a table and have a pizookie and beer to get the evening started right...Well... there was pretty much an hr long wait for a table...Good thing I'm pretty smart; and got chumsy with a table at the bar; and they gave us their booth. So lucky us.But even so.... I felt bad for people who walked in ahead of us waiting badly for a table..The wait on everything is pretty bad because this place gets really busy as it had just opened a few months ago....Our servers were OK and tried their best to give us great service...Food wasn't really Great... I was OK with the alcohol part.So yah.. I wouldn't be craving and wanting to go back again.
Michelle D.,San Jose  CA,5,13,7,3/12/2014,1.0,Service was okay...The reason why my review is a 1 star rating mainly because of what I ordered here. My boyfriend and I just wanted a pizookie  no food.I ordered a pizookie to share with my boyfriend. A pizookie comes in a circular baking pan with a scoop of ice cream on top. When I started to dig in  my spoon hit the pan right away.....Right off the bat  I noticed there was BARELY any of the cookie in it. Seriously  it was so thin?! I feel like a paid 7 bucks(tip included) just for a scoop of ice cream. For a restaurant chain like BJs  why would you skimp out? SMH  Not coming back.
Rob M.,Gilroy  CA,53,24,5,12/1/2014,3.0,"Went on a Sunday afternoon with a party of 10  not busy  so wait time was 5mins max. Seated in what seemed a ""dark room""  could barely see the menu and had to use our iPhones torch to scan through the menu. Ordered and wait time was as expected 15-20mins. We seemed to feel a little rushed with our orders though like as if the waiter had to be somewhere after her shift  anyway  the food was pretty good  drinks were coming in nice and quick. Had a great time among family friends. Spent a good hour and half there. Waiter again bugging us with a hurry up attitude asking if we have sorted the check  which had been done for 10 mins  and she then says ""great  now I can go home"". Ew  excuse you."
Roger N.,San Jose  CA,53,30,55,1/2/2015,4.0,I went to here with my uncle we order appetizer  so yummy.also I order chicken salad.the waiters very nice and polite special Nicole she his the best I recommend to give them try no disappointing.
Sara S.,San Jose  CA,15,14,14,4/7/2014,3.0,Open late even on week nights. Creative extended menus. Veggie burgers are available  but not currently on the menu. Avocado egg rolls were delicious. However  the avocado cream sauce for the fish tacos was terrible  old or something. Too much paprika for my taste on the Moroccan Salmon. Service was okay. Refills could have been quicker. This place is crazy busy on the weekends as they are especially known for their beers and cocktails. They invented the Pizookie  which is yummy.
Francis P.,Santa Clara County  CA,108,13,,4/7/2015,1.0,Waiting 35 minutes for 2 steaks and the waiter comes out after 20 minutes. He offered something while we wait  but not interested. He says the kitchen us backed up and the restaurant is not even full. I've experienced this twice before but this is the longest wait.The food is good  but it's not worth the wait and the waiters are consistent in not informing patrons unless you get their attention. This is the only BJ'S I ever been to  and I'm here because a friend wanted to try it. I truly don't recommend this place based on the help and the long time wait. Waiting can ruin your evening and you know what I mean by that statement. Bad management and staff- at least the person waiting on us.
J J.,San Jose  CA,2,39,6,8/27/2014,1.0,I wasn't going to write a review because the only people who do so are those that received inferior service or products. However  after two attempts in three days to eat at this BJ's  I feel compelled to write one.  I will not write about my first attempt that ended in my bf and I walking out and going to Chili's for dinner  nor will I write about my second attempt last night. What I will say is this. Everytime I have eaten at this BJ's  the food has been very good. Better quality than the BJ's at TanForan. My biggest gripe is with the management. This location has got a serious management problem! Any manager that allows his or her employees to provide such horrible service should be fired! The service is always hit and miss! Some serviers are very good. However  the majority are terrible! I blame this on the management. Shame on you for not managing your staff!
Rigo G.,San Jose  CA,0,3,,3/19/2016,1.0,Ate their clam chowder and puked  poor customer service  took and hour for some ranch. Flat out garbage
Ruthe R.,San Jose  CA,0,2,,6/30/2015,2.0,The food and beers are great. HOWEVER the service was atrocious! From the hostess not be able to pay attention long enough to seat us to the server that didn't even check on for at least 15 minutes. Then she couldn't bring any of or dishes at the same/correct time. One person got their soup & salad then about 10 minutes later we got an appetizer then another 15 minutes and we finally got our salads. OH YEAH and then ten minutes after that we got the bread appetizer that we wanted to start with. Have to say this BJ's has some issues.
Catherine W.,San Jose  CA,0,7,,3/19/2016,2.0,Was very excited to have a nice place to eat on a Saturday evening. The wait staff are great. Friendly  helpful and seriously great. The atmosphere is good too. The food not so much. Every visit someone is off when they bring the food to the table. First time the baked potato's were cold to the touch. Another visit the sauce was too salty. I hate returning food. I am generally so ready to eat I don't want to wait for it to be corrected and you have that feeling like you are trying not to pay for something. The last visit was horrid. That's when we stopped eating there. We waited a very long time for the food my chicken dish was cold and salty again. We were told it was because his eggs took so long. REALLY? eggs are faster or should be then chicken and pasta. So I switched dishes to ribs and decided not to bother with this place anymore. Oh and once we were eating in the bar and they sat children right up to the bar! And the kids were acting like kids. So odd to me. At one time it was a law not to have children in bars...... I guess that has changed.
Samantha S.,San Jose  CA,14,6,,2/25/2016,2.0,I ordered food from here on door dash i asked for a brewhouse burger with onion straws  lettuce  burger sauce and swiss cheese. I received the blue cheese burger with raw onions and tomatoes. Nothing close to what i ordered. I also didn't receive my fries. I would not recommend ordering from here. I have two starrs because despite being incorrect i found out i do like blu cheese. Unfortunately didn't make up for not getting any part of what i actually wanted.
Daniel A.,Milpitas  CA,269,23,,10/12/2013,2.0,TBH I should not be judging a place that just opened because not everyone is trained yet  but I couldn't help how uncomfortable my GF and I were. What I am going to say is  as a manager  DO NOT awkwardly stand behind your server while they are taking orders and bussing and not helping them at all. Not only are you making the server nervous and you're making the guests nervous too. I felt like I had to my exhibit my guest service to the server so she could look good to the obvious manager man that's standing behind her fixing chairs already straight.Pretty sure once they all get into the swing of things and have a better foundation  things will be better.
Betty K.,Newark  CA,23,56,82,2/25/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Michelle B. Was my server  she was so nice and professional. Ask for all the question that I need... Quick and fast service...ordered kale Brussel sprout salad yummy!!! Friendly services with big smile.
Jennifer L.,San Jose  CA,2,25,,5/11/2015,2.0,"Hubby and I finished shopping a little early and decided to catch an early dinner. We were seated right away (not crowded) but waited for our server for about 10 minutes. He took our beer order and calamari appetizer order. No kidding  it took almost 20 minutes to get our 2 beers! The waiter kept telling us it was coming. Then the calamari arrived  and it was cold. Honestly  it was very bland and I was really disappointed that it was served with ranch dressing. Ranch dressing for calamari? Shouldn\'t it be tartar sauce? My husbands burger arrived and it was very well done even though he ordered it medium. My pizza was just okay. The tomatoes on top tasted like they were canned and not fresh. I\'ve been to BJ\'s restaurants in other locations and had a good experience. I think this one needs a little work. Getting a beer at a ""Brewhouse"" shouldn\'t be so difficult!"
Debbie S.,San Jose  CA,37,37,15,12/3/2013,4.0,I really don't understand why there are so many negative comments for this place  we almost didn't come here because of it. We thought we would go for happy hour and give that a try first. We were greeted at the door by several young ladies who were very friendly and upbeat. We walked right in and took a seat at the bar so we could watch the Monday night football game. The bartender came over to service us right away. She told us all about the happy hour specials and said we could even order food there if we would rather have that. We had some wine and beer and order a few of the appetizers  the calamari was outstanding. We had an enjoyable time  and we will return to try out the dinner menu sometime.
Joseph F.,Denver  CO,4,3,,2/21/2016,1.0,Sat in the bar area  waited for service  watched three waiters clean about five tables around us and never acknowledged us  got up and left. Sad
Mazin K.,San Jose  CA,0,3,,6/19/2015,1.0,Avoid at all cost!Worst service I have ever had! The food does not have the same quality as other BJ's in the bay area. I will never eat at this location again. I wish I could give them zero or negative stars.
E R.,San Jose  CA,1,21,195,2/20/2016,1.0,"Worst server  worst food and the worst service we have ever had. We had a young boy who was our server who didn\'t even come to our table. After 25 min my husband had to go up to him to ask him to take our drink order. We immediately ordered our drinks and food. One hour later our food arrived...which one of the meals was wrong. At this point the boy who delivered our food(not our waiter) fixed the mistakes. We asked for him to get out waiter  but he apparently was too busy to come help us. It must have been all the waitresses he was trying to hit on instead of checking on his tables. One of the guests in our party eventually asked the waiter when he came to give us the bill how long he worked in the restaurant industry for. He replied  ""well I lied on my application to get the job  I really have only worked for four months."" This by far was the worst dinner we have had in a very long time. We will not be back and I suggest you don\'t waste your time and money on this place. The three girls that worked behind the bar were good though! I have to give them props!"
Wesley R.,Santa Clara  CA,17,6,,10/28/2013,2.0,I'm giving them 2 stars only because the food was pretty good and our server tried to serve us the best she could.I had a birthday dinner here last night with 12 friends. I called in 3 whole weeks prior to make a reservation. I called the night before just to make sure that they had my reservation and to let them know I would be coming. At first they couldn't find my reservation  this was foreshadowing what would eventually happen.I got there on time for my reservation and was told it would take about 20 minutes for another large party to leave. This was fine as people from my party were still showing up. However  after 45 minutes of waiting it got a bit ridiculous. I was then told that there was no room inside for a party of my size  and the other large party had just gotten their food. The only option they had was for us to sit outside. We chose to sit outside in the chilly weather. The heaters could only do so much with how cold it was outside.Our server was nice but she was being run around too. She wasn't supposed to be waiting tables outside and was running back and forth. The food runners kept bringing food to our table that we hadn't ordered  it was for other tables elsewhere. The food took a long time to come but it was pretty good. Our server had to take a break right in the middle of our evening and we were switched to another server. Later on  our original server returned. Afterwards we ordered pizookies and those took forever to come. They messed up the pizookie orders and forgot about one of them. By this time  it was 3 hours after people were told to arrive  everyone was freezing  food runners kept bringing food and drinks to our table that we hadn't ordered  everyone just wanted to leave  but we were waiting on a pizookie we had ordered that they forgot about. People were getting impatient and frustrated.We finally got out of there but it was such a bad experience that I will not be going back anytime soon. The management really needs to get their act together because the service was terrible overall and nobody knows what's going on. If somebody makes a reservation 3 weeks in advance  you must be able to accommodate that party! Maybe since this is a new establishment  they will get things together eventually but they certainly haven't gotten anything together yet!
Harris H.,Milpitas  CA,0,9,1,12/8/2014,3.0,Nice atmosphere. Great sport venue during game day. Great menu and good selection of beers.
David G.,Union City  CA,24,356,1,12/18/2013,1.0,I frequent the Newark BJ's quite often and used to go to the Cupertino one as well. This time I met up with a client for a quick meeting and drink. We already ate somewhere prior and just wanted a drink so we headed to the bar area. Did I mention we went to the BAR area?!? The waitress took our drink order and asked if we wanted appetizers  we said no  she said she will leave the menu in case we changed our minds. She must have came like 5 times rudely asking if we were going to eat. Finally after we said we are just there for a drink she rolled her eyes and said whatever. For the rest of the hour we were there we got dirty looks from her!
Mike G.,Saratoga  CA,0,1,,6/12/2015,3.0,BJs is my favorite upscale casual chain and The food across the chain is pretty consistent and to my taste.I want to give this place 4 stars  but the service here knocks it down.For example  my Caesar salad just arrived in a hot bowl  I almost always ask for Sriracha (which they have) and get told they don't have it  which means the server is either lazy or uninformed (another form of lazy).Despite the spotty service  I keep coming back. I guess they won't improve until the bottom line shows it. Sigh.
Betty B.,Riverside  CA,86,140,48,6/11/2015,2.0,A few problems with this place. The service was extremely slow took forever to get our orders in and to receive the food. My biggest problem was that everyone got their entrees except my mom and I. We went with a large party. We did not get our food until after everyone was done eating. What got me upset was the server kept coming by saying oh a few more minutes. Well a few minutes was like 15. Not very happy with the experience there. I do not live in the area but I do visit a lot and I unfortunately I will not be back if ever suggested.
Lisa B.,Rose Garden  San Jose  CA,2,10,4,3/9/2014,2.0,I don't know why I keep trying to have a good experience here. Last time I came to dine here  a friend and I got sat and waited about 15 minutes to be greeted by any server at all! Then we had to flag our waitress down again to put in our order like she forgot about us. Not exaggerating - an hour and a half later our food still hadn't come out. When it did  my pizza was cold but I was so starving by then so I forced it down. My friend asked for no veggies in her teriyaki chicken which  of course  came with veggies. At that point we asked to speak with a manager. We got a complimentary pizookie which was nice. Still wouldn't bother with this place anymore though  not worth the hassle!
Mr P.,San Jose  CA,1,7,,11/17/2014,2.0,"I gatta agree with allot of these reviews ""LAME"" service. Decent grub  but they seem to always figure out a way to mess up my orders.....Check it out for yourself San Jose foodies. Mr. powers don\'t steer you wrong"
Yesenia C.,San Jose  CA,0,3,,2/9/2016,1.0,"I have never been to a BJ\'s restaurant in my life so I was pretty excited  but boy was I disappointed. I got invited because of my friend\'s birthday and when we got there we were told that the reservation wasn\'t in the computer  even though we called to make it beforehand. They told us that two tables were just finishing up so we would be seated soon  the wait was almost an hour and now I understand why. It took our server an HOUR just so she could give us our tabs. Like  seriously? She kept saying "" I\'m coming! I\'m bringing the check!"" throughout the course of an hour but would disappear and not bring it. Also  whenever we would ask another server for something he said he couldn\'t help us because he\'s not our server but if OUR server is not helping us then who do we turn to? After we are seriously about to walk out because we need to go and no one is showing up she finally brings the tabs and excuses herself with how ""it takes a while to print"". I have worked in a restaurant before and split checks  it does not take an hour  especially when it\'s dead. Overall extremely disappointed  I literally got the Yelp app just to write this review. Don\'t go here  or at least don\'t get the server with the black hair and glasses  she never told us her name. Ps. The Pazookis were bomb."
Alexis G.,Anaheim  CA,0,9,5,11/10/2014,2.0,I had the WORST service ever. I have never had service this bad I actually left NO TIP. Our server Candi made us feel so unwelcome and was in such a rush. It took her 15 min to greet us  30 min to bring out WATER  and never checked in on us after our food came out. When I asked another server for water  he denied me and told me to wait for my server who was no where to be found. She also kept bringing the wrong food and drink to the wrong tables  not just mine. It seemed like she had a lot on her plate and was in too much of a rush. Never want to go back to this chain again.
Aparna K.,San Jose  CA,31,180,198,5/18/2014,4.0,Love the food and cocktails here. Salmon with caramelized onions is a big hit. I also like the tilapia with mango salsa. Their south west rolls are a bit oily but extremely tasty. Very good service as they recently opened this center in San Jose downtown:)
Carina M.,Seattle  WA,272,973,157,11/23/2013,2.0,Food was fine enough to merit 3 stars. However  docking 1 star because the server  however efficient  was cold and unapologetic for the 15 minute wait before even coming over and getting our drink order. We were willing to overlook that  but she made an error on our bill and fixed it  but was not gracious about it - no apologies for overcharging us on beers we didn't order. She made it feel like she did us the favor when it was her mistake. Didn't appreciate her tone.Server also seemed put out by the fact that we did not want BJs beer - we specifically asked for NON BJs beer.Food was good enough and better than your average BJs. Service was good  if a bit condescending and ungracious.Will come back for the food  but not the beer and hopefully next time we'll have a friendlier server who doesn't keep us waiting for 15 minutes and tries to overcharge us on food we didn't receive.
Lillian T.,San Jose  CA,187,86,14,9/12/2014,2.0,I really want to give them more stars  but every time I come here  I get pretty disappointed  even if I keep giving them chances. I came here twice recently and on both occasions  I was a bit disappointed. This review will be based on my recent experience  though I have had previous experience here also.The first time  I came here with some friends for dinner. For those of you that may not know  BJ's has a pretty extensive menu  much like Cheesecake Factory  so.. don't exactly expect the best food for that reason. I believe we came on a Saturday night  and there wasn't much of a wait. It's a pretty big location  so even though they were pretty busy  there were still open tables. I ordered their shrimp tacos (new) with a side salad. My friends ordered some other things that I did not try. Time passes  and they bring out all our entrees  but where is my side salad that was supposed to come before the meal? :( The server came by and I inquired about it. Turns out  she had forgot to put the order in  but said she would take care of it (comp). I thought that was nice of her  but when the salad came out  it was just this dinky place of lettuce! What kind of side salad is that? It literally looks like someone took some lettuce out of a bag and threw it out on the plate and added some dressing. Needless to say  I was actually pretty disappointed with that salad. I ate the salad and my tacos around the same time because my tacos had already come out. The tacos were around $10 and were okay. They use baby shrimp and there's about 3 or 4 pieces in each (2) taco. I have to say  it was hardly worth my $10. My second most recent encounter  was for a weekday happy hour. Their happy hour has changed since I've known it. It used to have a bigger variety of appetizers and I believe it used to also be a better deal in terms of price. My friend and I ended up order two mini $6 deep dish pizza's  a $5 appetizer of wings and sauces  and a $5 with $1 supplement of sliders with bacon and cheese. These were all items on the HH menu. I'm not entirely sure how they make their deep dish pizza's  but all the toppings essentially sink in the middle so the pizza's come out looking a bit of a funnel going downwards. The pizzas were actually pretty good but a bit salty  considering we got the ones with so much meat. The meat was not slathered on  but sufficed. The sliders that came out were typically slider size  and comes with a side of fries. I don't really have much to complain about that order  and would probably order the sliders again  but man  little burgers are pricey. Next  our review of the wings. They allow you to choose 3 dipping sauces because the wings are not tossed already  but rather  you dip them yourself. The plate comes with 5 wings  and some celery. I mean come on.. for $5  you're giving me pinky sized wings that do not taste nearly as good as Wingstops pinky sized wings? I definitely regret that order the most. The wings were not the only downside to this story- but I don't know if they were short staffed or what  but service was extremely slow. My water never got refilled  I waited forever for the check and for my receipt. Our server was friendly though so that's a plus.Overall  I actually don't like coming to BJ's very much because they have always been pretty pricey for bar type food. I have had a few good experiences where I would vouch for them  but those experiences were quite a while ago  and I'm pretty sure the company culture isn't the same now. I always tell myself to not go  but I always end up back there for whatever stupid reason to give them another chance. It'll probably happen again  but I hope my review helped some people decide on if they want to dine here or not.
Ben D.,Campbell  CA,259,7,,3/16/2015,5.0,My server tonight was Ariel. She was such a sweetheart. She came to my table with a beautiful smile on her face every single time. After a long day at work her service made my day. I will come back just because of her.
Erin H.,Santa Cruz  CA,44,211,23,11/21/2013,3.0,Okay. Another benefit-of-the-doubt review.So this location just opened and I understand that they have some kinks to work out. What I find a bit ridiculous is that on a Wednesday night at 9pm in a half-full dining room with twice as many servers as necessary  a meal will take you 3 hours to complete. Not joking. Exaggerating a little bit  but not joking. Our waitress was nice  but frazzled. Seemed like she was new or something. It took her a very long time to come to our table  a long time for our drinks to come out  a long time before she took our food order  a long time to get the food  a long time to sit with an empty plate and empty glasses  a long time to get dessert  but a surprisingly short time to have the check picked up.To be fair  about 3/4 of the way through our meal she went on her lunch break and some other dude took over. He wasn't spectacular  but he at least refilled our water glasses. Honestly though  the only actual positive thing I have to say is that pizooki's are flippin amazeballs. To sum up  don't come on a Wednesday night at 9pm if you are in a hurry. Order early  drink beer (it makes the waiting MUCH less frustrating)  eat dessert  pay the check and leave. A 2 star experience  but like I said  benefit-of-the-doubt.
Charissa Z.,San Jose  CA,17,32,18,12/11/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,Okay I have to admit the second time was okay. The hist wasn't very much educated at what he was supposed to be doing  but the hostess helped me with my rewards card on my phone so that I can check in. The wait was okay. I understand that they were a busy restaurant. Didn't mind the wait. It wasn't too long of the wait.What's funny  is that my bf said we have had the same hostess who sat us to our table from last timweand it was the SAME hostess (as he says) that I didn't like from the first time we went to eat there aand was actually acknowledging me this time. Wow... but yet we had three servers the first one I think was off after she took our order. the second one  she was rude. The third one was very nice.All in all  the food was amazing all tho I regret not ordering the wedges :(. I should've ordered them. AND the only thing that satisfies my tummy there is the pazooki. Its always a plus with the pazooki in my tummy!
Amanda O.,Saratoga  CA,0,11,7,7/26/2016,1.0,I usually like BJs  but I have now had two bad experiences at this one. One day I went for lunch with my husband and just found the food subpar  but since we had a gift card we went back for dinner another night. After getting seated  it took 15 minutes for anyone to even bring us water  and throughout the night they rarely came to refill our glasses. I ordered the roast beef dip  and the sandwich came out cold and soggy and with the wrong fries. Also the au jus was cold and way too thick. My poor husband ordered the pesto chicken flatbread without chicken (he's vegetarian)  and they delivered it to the wrong table  so he had to sit there while I ate. Then they brought his out  but with chicken on it! Eventually they brought him another (try #3)  packed to go at this point  and when we got home  we found a piece of bacon on it! And bacon isn't even a listed ingredient for the pizza! Luckily  the manager did not make us pay for our meal  but we definitely won't be coming back.
Lucy L.,San Jose  CA,2,21,1,11/13/2013,1.0,I had high hopes for this local brewpub given I live close by.  They have been open long enough to have their staffing and slow food service refined at this point.From the time were seated  it took at least 20 minutes to even get a glass of water.  From that point forward  it seemed as though there was a steady flow of servers  none of whom we could flag down.  Eventually our food arrived...cold...and all I can attest to is our meals which were mediocre.  The waiter took my food before I was done...swooped in like an eagle and of course  given we'd been trying to track him down our entire time there with great diffficulty  we gave up.   We waited for another 5 mins or so to get someone's attention to order dessert to no avail.On my way out I spoke to the general manager and informed her about such horrible service  cold and mediocre food and I've never seen a manager so non-plussed about a complaint.  Now that I look on Yelp  I can see she has had many.Maybe they weren't prepared for the crowds  but given BJ's has invested in a brand new building  you'd think they would have refined their service and food at this point  or invested in a manager that would have some success in hiring and training staff.Unless I see an uptick in good reviews  I wouldn't waste my money on anything other than a beer right under the bartender's nose.
Joshua N.,Concord  CA,18,41,,1/25/2015,4.0,Met with a date to watch the Warrior game. I ordered the Tuscan Chicken pasta. It was okay.
Ashley D.,San Jose  CA,0,7,,12/29/2015,2.0,Ordered take out online at 5 pm to pick up at 630 pm. Arrived early and waited at the bar until our order was ready. Finally at 7 pm it was. Before leaving we checked the bag to find one of our entrees was missing. Thankfully we were still in the parking and could run back in but you would think having 2 hours to prepare our order it would be right. I understand this was a busy time but spending $50 on take out my expectations were higher.
Thang N.,Campbell  CA,307,25,14,11/16/2014,1.0,One of the female bartenders was alarmingly rude. She was snappy in her demeanor. Idk if it was intentional or she was just careless. Right when I finished eating she just snatched the plate and towels away from me without even asking or making eye contact. Didn't even get a chance to wipe the grease off my hands. I was just there for a beer and a thin crust pizza appetizer minding my own business. During the whole time she was eyeballing me like I was a burden...creepy. Left her a much bigger tip than she deserved anyway. The world is what we make of it.
Amanda H.,Kaneohe  HI,0,13,,3/1/2015,2.0,"Two stars are for the hostess and food...waiter was horrible and I try not to judge so much because I\'m a server myself. Came here after arriving into San Jose and my bf suggested this place because he\'s been to other bjs and loved it. We noticed it was late night happy hour and when server finally came over with no personality whatsoever  we asked him if there were any food items on happy hour or if it was only drinks. His words were ""well if you pay attention to the fine print  you would see a few items here on the menu"".......I was actually shocked at what I had just heard lol with no ""just kidding"" or anything to follow such a rude statement. Maybe you get that question a lot and it annoys you  but go and vent in the back if you have to  never to a customer. Nothing really got better the rest of the night. He walked past an empty beer glass about 3 times and we finally asked him for another beer. Had to ask for our check  and had to wave him down after about 3 times walking past our card. Maybe Frank was having a rough night or maybe helping people isn\'t the job for you."
Dan T.,Los Gatos  CA,0,91,128,11/3/2013,2.0,Avoid this place until they figure out their staffing issues  food service is very slow. Food Quality and preparation are weak. Much better places to go.
Jenn L.,San Jose  CA,9,3,,1/9/2015,1.0,Long wait and undercooked food! I ordered a burger online and when I got to BJ's had to wait a good 8-10 minutes to be helped at the takeout counter. Once  I was helped I was told that my order was not ready yet. Really?!? My order said it was going to be ready at 7:45 and it was now 8:05. After waiting another 10 minutes my burger was finally ready. Got home and my burger that I ordered well done was raw!!! Tried to call to talk to a manager and was put on hold for 7 min. Tried calling again and was told the manager was to busy. Well  I guess they are to busy for my business.
Catrina T.,San Jose  CA,4,9,1,4/25/2015,5.0,I absolutely love this one specifically! I've been to this location twice and both times I had an amazing experience. They're super quick and fast and I love coming here. It's very spacious on the inside and the food is AMAZING! The waiters are always friendly and warming. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants to go to!
Julian H.,San Jose  CA,288,66,12,10/18/2014,2.0,"Oh BJ\'s why you do me like that?BJ\'s is one of those iconic places you drive by and remember having a pazookie or a small dinner and some beer. I don\'t typically think poorly about BJ\'s but the other night\'s experience was just a tad lack-luster.Parking around here is really what you\'d expect from a busy plaza next to a busy Target and other restaurants. You might get lucky and grab a spot up front or you might find a place a bit further back  but it\'s still nothing to REALLY complain about. I will give them props for a good busy location however. Workers here are pretty hit or miss in terms of quality. The front desk/hostesses were extremely nice and friendly. We were expecting 8 but had 7 and then there was some weird misunderstanding about if we actually had 9 (most of which was our group\'s fault so I can\'t blame them). The hostesses worked it out quickly and put us in a great spot near the window. Our waiter however was a bit awkward. I asked him if they had any seasonal beers which he explained and when I told him ""Oh  no thanks  they don\'t sound that appealing "" he waited for me to order a different beer. I guess he really wanted me to buy some beer. Anyway he was awkward in the sense that it seemed like he expected us to order more but we couldn\'t be bothered if there wasn\'t anything there we wanted. The same thing happened when we ordered our food. He sort of just waited there even after we said  ""I think that\'s it for now. Thanks."" The weird thing was even though he seemed so ""helpful"" it was like a 20 minute gap between my empty waters till he noticed that I was waving at him. Definitely a lack-luster experience.The food at this BJ\'s is just like the other ones  and for the most part I probably could have made the same thing at home. The pazookies were pretty normal but by the time we finished them people were dying of sugar overloads. Overall  this BJ\'s is just... well  another BJ\'s and isn\'t anything particularly special. I\'d definitely try it again and hope for a better experience but going on this past experience the other night I\'d give it a whole 2-stars."
Maureen K.,San Jose  CA,7,20,8,9/3/2014,3.0,"Came here for lunch today. Six of us walked in at 11:13pm. I was hungry. No one else in line. We get a vacuous stare from the employee at the podium and NO ONE of the other three employees buzzing around will look at us. Finally someone does and she goes off to set up a table and it takes her over ten minutes to put two tables together and find the place settings. We were seated at 11:29. It turns out that we were in her section. She disappears for ten minutes but comes back very bubbly. She wants to take our food order at the same time as the drink order as obviously we have had enough time while she was gone to make a decision of what to eat for lunch. They have a very extensive selection of food. I got a lunch special. I liked mine. It came with half a flatbread pizza and a green salad with all veggies. The other five peoples reaction to the food ranged from a shrugged shoulder to ""meh"" to "" it was ok/good"" to ""I liked it!"" I guess if you have what you want to eat instead of picking something in a hurry then it tastes better. We had a birthday and got a freshly made cookie with ice cream. It was devoured quickly. The service after we sat down was very good. The dishes were brought out timely and quickly cleared. We finished about 12:25 and there was quite a wait to be seated when we left. The Vacuous One was still there looking as though nothing was ""her job"". I saw no host/ess leading patrons to any tables and we had quite a walk from our table to the front and saw many empty tables. It was crowded and disorganized in the front and again  no one looked like they knew what was going on. I would suggest Management train staff that most clients want to be seated quickly. A good start to the dining experience encourages a larger tip. Secondly  look and act competent. This means knowing how much time it will take to seat guests  where the other staff is in relation to getting a table set up and being able to communicate with the guests  AND being able to process seating requests quickly. Then  training on not having the guests wait for the server to acknowledge them and NOT expecting that leaving them alone guarantees they will make a decision as to their meal. It makes them cranky and makes them think of walking out. I might go back..but probably not for a while. I will take my business lunch dates to Chili\'s where they know what they\'re doing"
Carlos P.,San Jose  CA,9,1,1,6/19/2014,1.0,So I went to BJ'S for lunch today because I had never been  had someone waiting for me there who I asked to order something to munch on so that I would have something to eat when I arrive. I show up 10 minutes later and my friend still has not been helped. We sit there for another 5 minutes before someone arrives to help us. The server shows no enthusiasm and does not make me feel welcome at all. My friend and I look at each other get up and walk out. Maybe I will give them another chance but the first impression was a poor one.
Tiffany A.,Fresno  CA,246,28,21,10/13/2015,1.0,Went on a Friday night to celebrate my Birthday with 7 guests. Booked my table way in advance earlier the week of. Still had to wait 20 min to be seated. Started out well with our server Carlos. Once we got half of our entrees served  we asked for silverware. 15 min later served the other half of entrees and still no silverware. Food starts to get cold from first half. After he brings us everything  he is then no where to be found after over an hour. I go to the bathroom midway and see our server at the hostess booth just having a grand ol time fooling around. Back to the table and all of a sudden a new waitress comes by and gives us our Check and doesn't even let us know she is taking over. Carlos didn't even let us know. He just up and left pretty much!!! New waitress Hailey was super rude and confusing about splitting the check. It was a complicated 20 or so minutes. We then order dessert (don't even know why she gave us the check so fast to begin with...they just wanted us out seems like) I know it was my birthday and it would've been cool to have a candle on my pizookie lol but I guess that's alright? :/ meh...the whole experience with our waiters just killed the vibe of our dinner. Called the manager over to express our complaints and he managed to cut some of our bill. Then all of a sudden Carlos magically appeared and took care of our bill! WTH! He was still in the building! Worst BJ'S experience ever! You guys give the restaurant chain a horrible name!! We got here at 8pm and didn't leave til midnight! Awful experience from BJ's. Keep a better check on your employees.
Bay F.,San Jose  CA,0,43,,7/4/2014,2.0,I feel bad for the servers who actually do their job here (as opposed to those who stand around  for whom I have no sympathy). Our server last night was overworked but I have to imagine she could've been supported by at least one of the four others I saw standing around. Alas  she wasn't. So it took about 20 minutes to have our ice water request fulfilled. Our wedge salad came with onions  despite our request to leave them off.Our son's kid's deep dish cheese pizza amounted to cheese bread. Our BJ's Supreme deep dish was better  although if you want good deep dish pizza  I wouldn't recommend theirs. The pizzookie was great  as usual.We'll come back  but I hope when we do  they have their service act together a bit more.
Jacob T.,San Jose  CA,17,28,,5/16/2014,2.0,as has been noted by many other reviews  this place is an operational disaster. service is a bogged down nightmare. do not attempt to have a quick meal here. not happening. now  if you feel like coming at 3PM on a thursday  having a beer and a pizookie  that'll probably work for you  but i've been a few times for lunch  and they just can't handle it. food is chain food. it's fine  and the lunch specials are a pretty good deal  though 3 and a quarter for a soft drink is madness.
Joshua P.,San Jose  CA,34,6,,5/25/2014,1.0,Forgot sauce on first pizza. They remade it and forgot a topping and dough was raw. Will not return.
Annabell A.,San Jose  CA,66,12,3,3/2/2015,2.0,I attend for the First Time on friday night 02/27/15 and I was Not impressed with the Service given by the waiters. The Hostess and front desk assistance was very professional and pleasant thye stated about a 25 min wait time and they sat us a bit sooner that part was Excellent.Once we were seated we sat and waited and waited and the Waiters and Waitresses kept going past us and Nothing .... we waited a few more mins and still Nothing... So I politely went up to front Hostess desk and Complained that I had been Patienly for almost 15 mins. and still no sigh of a Waiter  No Silver ware  No Water  Not even any type of Eye contact.  When I was complaining a very Nice Well manner Waiter from another section (I forgot to ask his name) came to us and served us and place our order and he apologized for the unattented service from the waiter. He stated that the waiter was on his break or attending another table. I think his name was Josh which he never showed up. After our food was ready Bernardo served us and was very Polite and Attentive. Bernardo did an Excellant job picking up the slack of the other waiter.Food rating Was very Good and plates and food items nice and Hot and portions were well portioned.I might try one more time to see if I get better luck next time  still debating.
Hazel L.,San Jose  CA,219,28,38,4/25/2014,2.0,"This BJ\'s definitely lives up to their two-star rating! && I\'m actually being a bit generous giving them two stars..Food = decent. BUT WHY TWO STARS?! Because the service at this location sucks ass. If you want to make a reservation here  THINK OTHERWISE. I called Wednesday 4/23/14 to make a reservation and this girl answered. I told her my reason why I was calling & she put me on HOLD so she could get her manager to talk to me and set the reservation. I WAS ON HOLD FOR 15 MINUTES! Eventually my patience ran out & I decided to drive and make the reservation FACE-TO-FACE with the manager. I arrive to BJ\'s tell the hostess that I would like to set a reservation for my party consisting of 40 people & she had the nerve to say  ""Oh to make a reservation  you could have simply gave us a call and we\'d be glad to help you.."" LIAR  I mean she only put me on hold for like 15 minutes right ?! GIRL BYE. ANYWAYS  so I speak with the manager Diana as she attempts to help me make a reservation. I asked her about the times that are available to accommodate 40 people since the Warriors/Sharks had a game that day too. She told me 9:30PM.. I was unsure myself if that was gonna be a good time to reserve  BUT I took a risk and told her to put my name down as a reservation for 9:30PM/40 people party. I seen her write the reservation down on her reservation paper & I told her before I left ""IF MORE OR LESS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ATTEND  I WILL GIVE YOU A CALL"".. **DAY OF THE EVENT**My party of 40 and I arrive the day of the event around 9:20ish & tell the hostess that I have a reservation under my name for 40 people. With a confused look on her face she tells me ""No  we have a reservation down for 30 people.."" && I was thinking maybe there had to be a last minute change with the reservation  so the hostess just tells me and my party to take a seat and wait a few minutes.. We\'re waiting and waiting and waiting.. Another BIG group of people enter through and say they had a reservation at 9PM for 30 people. I\'m here like WTF is going on.. We\'ve waited almost an HOUR && that\'s when the Hostess tells us that there has been a mix up with reservations & they thought we were part of the other big party whose reservation was at 9PM. I tell the hostess that I set a reservation with Diana the day before & when they check their system my name doesn\'t pop up... A FEW MINUTES LATER WE FIND OUT THAT DIANA NEVER SET A RESERVATION FOR ME. Supposedly there was a miscommunication that I didn\'t tell her clearly I wanted a reservation  when I clearly MADE one the previous day stating to put my name down for 9:30PM. Instead of acting as a manager and apologizing for her mistake she was just ignoring me and trying to avoid eye contact. Some manager huh??? I had to restrain my rachetness and make sure I didn\'t go off on this manager.. BUT..THANKFULLY one of the hostess.. I forgot her name  but she looked Latin  had braces  and had long curly hair came to the RESCUE! All she told me to do was count the amount of people in my party who were actually there and told me to WAIT A FEW MORE MINUTES. We were seated around 1050/55PM.. At that time PEOPLE WERE GETTING HANGRY  especially since the Warriors/Sharks lost that day too.. Usually for a big party of 25+ they have a set menu called ""Pizza Pairings"" where the people in the party pay per person if they want Pizza (12.95/person)  Pizza/Salad(13.95/person)  or Pizza/Salad/Pasta (14.95).. We ended up not ordering from that and just ordered from the regular menu. To serve my big ass party  I give the waitresses that served us KUDOS because they were on top of their game! They were efficient with the getting our drink/food orders and they always came back to make sure we were doing fine and letting us know when our food was ready. As much as my guests and I were annoyed from the manager\'s mistake for my reservation  I definitely am grateful for the hostess and waitresses that made the event work out perfectly!"
Emily L.,San Jose  CA,4,80,57,10/28/2014,3.0,Service was kinda slow ... But then it was the giants game. and they switch servers on us. So we ended up with 2 orders of everything. But why do people come here? For pazookies! I don't like Oreos cuz they're super sweet but those Oreo pazookies was pretty good. The cold ice cream and warm giant cookie just work for me. And their HH buffalo wings are good. Not too saucy and very crispy.
John T.,Fremont  CA,2,51,,1/5/2015,3.0,Ate here today for dinner after work while waiting for traffic to die down. Being a Monday  it wasn't busy so there was practically no wait for a table (not on the bar side). When we were seated  our server came by in a timely manner and got us our drinks. When ordering  I got a stuffed potato with a house salad. The house salad didn't come out with my potato  but when our server came by to check on us  she brought it out right away  so no big deal. The food was good and our server was friendly  so maybe 3.5 stars.
David C.,San Jose  CA,0,3,,2/17/2015,1.0,"The cook doesn\'t know the difference between a steak cooked "" medium"" or "" well"" . I ordered medium and it came well done! My wife is too nice to send it back and I\'m out all the money for a burnt steak. Don\'t order steak at this restaurant!"
D L.,Santa Clara  CA,208,34,27,9/18/2015,1.0,Don't say it's going to be 15-20 min if it's going to be over an hour and a half. Despicable.
Deanna D.,San Jose  CA,4,5,1,5/1/2014,1.0,There lucky they got any stars and I'm very nice  the customer service here is very sad!!! They treat everything like it's an inconvenience to them as waters and waitresses and EVERYTHING (even water) takes 10 minutes to get to your table. The staff have their own personal agendas and they aren't professional at all. I like bjs but they are already over prices and I have no time or patience to ever sit in this restaurant again. WORST BJS EVER!!!
L F.,San Jose  CA,0,6,4,11/14/2014,1.0,The Friday afternoon bartender does not want to be there. She has a constant scowl on her mug and is fairly rude. The service is VERY SLOW!!!
Amber B.,Castro Valley  CA,2,65,,10/12/2014,5.0,OMG this was the best meal I've had in ages! The parmesan crusted chicken was so divine I could not get enough of it! I loved every single bite. Great service- sorry I didn't catch the servers name. Fun atmosphere  I will certainly be back soon for more chicken!!
Adam H.,Rochester  MN,24,36,33,3/5/2015,5.0,Awesome soup sandwich and hang over cure. Great taps but can be extremely busy at lunch so not a quick leave work stop for a sandwich.
Vivian L.,San Jose  CA,50,5,3,4/18/2014,1.0,"If I could give this place 0 stars  I would do so in a heartbeat. I was so excited to hear that BJ\'s was opening up near my area since I die for their avocado rolls. SO DAMN GOOD. Went to this location TWICE and hey always ran out of it. Seriously? But that was not the most annoying part. My friends and I came here on another night and ordered rounds and rounds of appetizers and drinks. I could tell that they were getting a little irritated since they came by multiple times and asked if we were ready to order from the dinner menu  but we clearly told them that we were mainly going to get appetizers and drinks. Then  my boyfriend heard some of the waitresses BEHIND our table talking about us. They were saying things like ""Oh  why are they even here if they aren\'t going to order anything? They\'re taking up so much room."" First of all  there were absolutely NO other customers waiting to be seated. And secondly  our bill still came out to be over a fucking hundred dollars. OVER 100 and you\'re still complaining? They\'re lucky we even tipped them in the first place. I would have wanted to talk to their manager  but I didn\'t even know they were saying things about us until after we left the place. If you want extremely shitty customer service  go to this location."
Kent J.,Sparks  Reno  NV,0,5,7,6/25/2014,1.0,I didn't leave the parking lot before writing this review.We got the wrong order  wrong drinks  left hanging waiting for a rude manager to hit us with a go F--k yourself attitude when we complained about the time resolve the problem. Go ssomeplace else is my recommendation.
A Allen G.,San Jose  CA,0,5,,1/19/2015,1.0,Horrible food  terrible service. I have a stomach ache after eating. Waitress lied about happy hour. How can you have old and rancid lettuce in a salad?? Really? Waitress had an attitude and only gave excuses  didn't apologize. Not worth the wait or money. Will not be returning to this restaurant.
Lady B.,Santa Clara  CA,37,7,5,9/16/2015,1.0,Horrible customer service! Visited this particular BJ's twice within 24 hours and both times horrible customer service! Hostess' from last night told me Happy Hour is only served in the bar area  but the bar area was packed! So you're telling me I can't get Happy Hour in the regular sitting area if you don't have any seating accommodations for me in the bar area?? LOL I asked the waiter later as I squeezed myself into seating in the bar area and he of course  told me he could honor happy hour in the regular searing area so I no longer had to rub elbows with the strangers next to me. THEN the next waiter was super rude  again no customer service and no smile. Not once. Then today  Miss Waitress stated she couldn't split the check for a party of 12. No  you're lazy! Lazy like the rest of your teammates. You guys need to increase the level of customer service and decrease the level of laziness. Maybe take a look at Starbucks policies on customer service. I'm sure it's a reflection of management in this particular location. Prime area location and your management team is not taking advantage of the given large customer base! Your people need training or clean house if they've been there too long. Your workers lack initiative and passion. You need to hire leader minded employees  not people who just want to clock in and out. Good luck!
Justin P.,San Jose  CA,71,5,,5/28/2014,1.0,No stars.... I've never done review for a restaraunt before... Staff seems like they're still in highschool. No customer service at all. Went with my family. Better off going to the oakridge mall location.
Kendra P.,Santa Rosa  CA,41,7,1,9/5/2014,1.0,This place has horrible service. We came in just wanting some drinks and appetizers. The waiter came to get our drink order and appetizer order. 15-20 minutes later we never even got our drinks. We then watched our food being given to another table and them accepting it! We ended up walking out and are not coming back!! The best part was  two managers were sitting next to us talking and didn't step in and help out! BJ's you need to improve your service of both your employees and managers if you want to stay open!! TERRIBLE.
Gary C.,Brentwood  CA,0,11,,5/31/2016,2.0,We had to have a good burger on Memorial Day and our first choices were closed. Had been to BJs on Coleman back during the Xmas holidays (because they were open) with a terrible service experience  but decided to give them another try (again they were open). We were immediately seated as it was less than 25% full at 1:00 PM. It took over 15 minutes for just the first server contact. The server finally came to the table obviously harried from an apparent short staffing situation (same issue as last time). Said she sorry for the delay; she was really busy. They were shorted handed (more a complaint than an apology). I responded we were really hungry. We were disappointed to hear they didn't have garlic fries. The food came a bit slowly with an oversight in requested condiments that took too long to remedy (flagged down another server). The burgers were OK  but not great. We had to flag down our server after 2 empty drink glasses sat at the edge of the table for about 10 minutes. In summary the food was OK  but the service (or lack of adequate servers) was the very poor. We don't think the Coleman BJs will get a third chance any time soon.
Erika H.,Hayward  CA,1,4,1,1/1/2014,2.0,On average the servers here are questionable and don't know the menu. Most of the bartenders are great. One girl just looks like it's her job to hang out. I have seen her on more than one occasion just talking to a select few bar customers. This is a problem because almost everyone feels ignored. I also don't feel safe with all of that booze on the wall. If there is an earthquake every bartended is getting at least getting cut up by falling bottles. The kitchen usually sucks and usually messes up something I've ordered.
Brittany Jo R.,San Jose  CA,88,6,3,8/31/2015,1.0,If I could give this Bj's zero stars I would. This place is terrible. I have given this particular BJ's at least 4 sit down chances and 1 door dash chance. The servers aren't the issue. The issue is the kitchen staff. THEY DO NOT PAY ATTENTION. I have received multiple under cooked baked potatoes  I ask for no onions on my food for my family and it was covered in onions. i am unsure if they don't care  don't understand  or simply don't give two shits. ** excuse my language** I have had decent servers at this location and some that are absolutely awful. My family and I gave this BJ's a try with door dash ( this review is on the BJ's only NOT door dash) We ordered our meals according to our specifications and everyones meal was WRONG! I also found HAIRS not just a hair but HAIRS in my food!! GROSS!!! I wish that I could give this place more credit but if I am paying 60 dollars for dinner I want to eat the food I purchase. It is a waste of time and money when I should have simply cooked at home. I will NEVER visit this BJ's ever again in person  or take away. The owners and management team really should take a look into their kitchen staff and over all restaurant staff. This establishment is awful. If they aren't careful someone could get extremely sick from the lack of personal hygiene and cleanliness.
Tori C.,San Jose  CA,67,62,93,7/16/2014,4.0,Good food  usually good / decent service  great beer selection (if u like beer)  nice ambience.
Kevin N.,Milpitas  CA,144,9,4,4/29/2014,1.0,"When my friends said there was a BJs on Coleman  I was surprised. So I checked it out on here and I was shocked to see it had a two star rating  and after eating here  I\'m not surprised. We arrived at around 10 pm on a Monday  mostly empty in the dining area and moderately busy at the bar. We had a party of 10 so we had to wait for a table that could accommodate. When it was ready  our hostess rudely let us know with a ""\'Kay  your table is ready"" and didn\'t even take us to the table; she just pointed to a table in the back that was barely big enough to accommodate us so we asked a different person if we could add another table  which we did. Our server was just as bad; she was inattentive and lacked urgency  that is until she realized she new one of our friends. She then continued to chat it up with him instead of helping us out. It took a while for us to order food and the food took just as long to come out as well  both meal and dessert  and drinks were left empty for long periods of time. A few of us were sharing food and our server was supposed to bring out plates  but that never happened as well. Our food was pretty good considering it\'s a chain but I was a little disappointed on the portion size of my parm chicken.Needless to say I won\'t be coming back  at least to this location"
Ray R.,Eatonton  GA,4,5,,9/18/2014,1.0,The food is decent and the price is right but the service is TERRIBLE. Seriously  don't go here unless you have 2 hours to burn because that is how long it will take to get your food.
Shawn O.,San Jose  CA,72,17,3,7/28/2014,1.0,"Not a good night for us. We waited 40 minutes for our entree. Found our waiter as he hadn\'t even returned to fill our water or ice tea. He said ""let me check"". Come back and said one entree was burnt and they needed to cook a new one. Asked him how long. He said 5 minutes. After 15 minutes a manager approached to ask if we were stilling waiting for one entree. Said ""no waiting for two"". We told the manager we were done and leaving. Total time spent 60 minutes. Walked next door to panera bread. All done in 20 minutes."
Dave H.,San Jose  CA,0,7,1,3/7/2016,2.0,We met friends last Saturday night for a bite before the Sharks hockey game. We arrived first at 4:30 PM ahead of a 5:00 PM dinner spot so I went up to the check-in desk and spoke with a tall thin dark haired young man with black rimmed glasses. I told him that we were meeting a couple and I wanted to see if they had arrived first. I said that the reservations would be under the wife's name 'Jane Doe'. He seemed rather put off but replied 'she's not here yet'. OK...no problem...we'll just wait. for them to arrive. They have a bit of a challenge because Jane's husband is disabled and uses a high tech electric wheel chair and we expected them to be running a bit late as it was pouring rain. They arrived at about 5:10 PM so I went back over to the tall thin guy with dark hair and glasses and told him that our party was now here and we'd like to be seated. He then said that he would put us on the list (huh?!?). I then said that I had originally asked him about the reservation for 'Jane Doe' and he said 'we don't take reservations' (duh! why didn't you tell me that at 4:30PM and then put me on the list then?). Apparently  they don't like seniors at BJ's is all we can figure out since then they proceeded to make us wait until 5:45 PM when a table way back by the kitchen opened up and they could stash the old gray haired couples back there with the guy in the wheel chair. We explained to the waiter that we were on a tight schedule and could they bring the order (soup since there was so little time until the game) for my wife and I out right away. At 6:15 PM our soup still had not arrived so my wife and I had to go (she had to open up a business suite at the SAP arena for clients) and left Jane and John there to eat alone. They were kind enough to get our soup to go and then met us later at the arena to give it to us so we didn't go hungry ;-). The only reason they get 2 stars instead of 1 is that they actually gave us metal spoons with the to-go order of soup since they had no plastic ones... We probably won't be back (unless it's to drop off their spoons whenever we are in the area).
Abby C.,Redmond  WA,15,92,38,7/14/2014,2.0,What happened to BJ's? The service is awful  I mean at least act like you care. The food has gone way down hill. Portions are smaller  which is ok  but prices didn't change. My burger was a waste of money. Over cooked  cheese only on 1/2  no lettuce  and cold fries. No thanks  you can probably get better at a fast food joint. 2 dinners  1 beer  1 orange cream soda  pizooki-$60??? No thanks  I won't be back.
Luis B.,Castro Valley  CA,120,134,157,7/4/2015,1.0,Food is great like always but tonight I go into the restroom and it's a mess I use crutches. I felt good enough to not use my wheelchair. While I go in to the gentlemen restroom what u know i slip and fall down. Yup right down. It hurt made my leg hurt more then usual. So I try to use the restroom while keeping stable on my crutches I make it to the toilet nope can't use those it's a mess paper towels on the floor water like a wet dog just shock off the excess water. Well I just decide to hold it and try to get out without falling again. I try to wash my hands well no paper towels that explains all the wet floors. Now my leg and back hurt this sucks came to relax now I leave in pain. Well I get out and try to get someone to clean the restroom. Well passed by 3 people until a guy asks have u been helped well he heard the bathroom is a mess but not that I fell or am I okay. Just walked off to tell someone about the bathroom.
Richard B.,San Jose  CA,0,2,,10/24/2014,1.0,The service was horrible here!!! I would not recommend this restaurant to anybody. The waiter was very rude and very gay; it seemed to me as if he still had a dick in his ass!!! On top of all this I wanted to get a puzuki and the waiter didn't ask if we wanted dessert or anything he just gave us a check and treated us as if we were dirty minorities!!! I'm boycotting BJs who's with me
Lexy H.,Millbrae  CA,2,34,31,7/20/2014,3.0,Service was good- food was cold- lettuce tasted like wet rag and the cooks got the order wrong. I eat at BJs all the time. I don't understand why the good here was so bad. It's a Sunday but still. I don't feel that what I had was worth $30!!
Iman B.,East Lansing  MI,138,63,11,7/17/2014,5.0,We were 6 people and we got avocado roll which was great and two medium pizzas. the pizza was really good and I suggest you if you wanna try some hood pizzas  ho there.
Jason Rommel R.,Morgan Hill  CA,12,2,,9/3/2014,3.0,"It\'s a BJ\'s...same menu  same food  same drinks...stars for a chain like BJ\'s i base on service...been a good patron for my local games in the Bay Area...and have had not troubles outside of today at any other BJ\'s..but went to the bathroom first time (with a clean 59fitted hat still on the table) to have the table cleaned andy Hopstorm (which is is a legit IPA for the price/flavor)...in my mind  thought honest mistake  due to my team losing...had a beer after to cope with the loss and put in another b/c of the ""September countdown""..hit the bathroom again WITH COASTER ON MY BEER....and gets cleared off...apparently midstream  as i suppose it is a team rule at this location...all said and done...flip a coin in prime hours..."
Diane H.,San Jose  CA,22,77,12,6/25/2014,2.0,Bad service and bad food. The place seems very disorganized. I went for dinner on a Tuesday evening and they had trouble figuring out where to seat us. When I ordered it took quite a while to get my salad which came out missing half of the ingredients. It's a TGIF type of place with the menus a size of a book. There's no way the food can be fresh or tasty with that many items to choose from. The experience was a let down and a waste of money.
Loni N.,San Jose  CA,9,46,9,6/18/2014,3.0,Yummy ahi poke. They got a good selection of appetizer and dessert. That's what I come here for. Service is getting better since they settled in a bit now. Lunch specials for 5.95. Haven't been here for lunch yet. Just sticking to what I like.
Wendy L.,Sacramento  CA,2,18,3,6/18/2014,4.0,Super thrill to get a free pizookie on 6/17/14 plus $5 off the bill for dL app n registering. Utilized the app to place myself on the waitlist. When we arrived  we were told the app is useless n wait time starts the moment we arrive. Was pissed off cuz we could've gone somewhere else to dine if we knew we have to wait longer than expected. Luckily  the wait was not that bad  maybe about 25 min? We used the app to place order ahead. Food arrived fairly quickly after we were seated. however  the salad that was ordered was missing 2 main ingredient. The cook should've said the dish was sold out instead of trying to cheat the customer. Our waiter offer to not charge us for the dish!! Great customer service!!! Thank u!!
Melanie H.,Redwood City  CA,166,17,3,7/11/2015,1.0,Decided to eat here after graduation. When I saw the poor reviews I should've known better. Service was slow  and heaven forbid you want to see a manger because I swear they hide in their office to avoid customers! We placed our order and our waiter forgot the kids pizza. He looked surprised when I asked where it was  although he only gave us 4 plates for pizza for our party of 5! He placed the order  then came back and said he had written it on the back. Ok  at least he acknowledged  but when a server messes up  my experience has been they offer a free dessert or even give you the kids meal for free. I mean  how do you forget the kids meal? Because my son had to wait 15 minutes for his meal  he ended up eating some of ours and no longer hungry when his meal finally came out. Service  in general  was below par. Had to continually ask for refills  and even though it was graduation day  there were only a handful of graduates and families there; it definitely was no packed for lunch! After we paid  I thought I would see the manager. Nope  the manager took over 10 minutes to come out  at which point we left. We had enough of poor service. If a manager makes guests wait that long to talk to  it's no wonder why the servers care less about providing excellent service. Too bad. Good food  horrible service  and his tip reflected it! Consider this your tip - pay more attention to your guests and what they ordered!
Jeff H.,San Jose  CA,0,35,,5/1/2016,2.0,Been here several times  and returned for dinner. Don't know what happened to the customer service  but it's really gotten worse. Tonight my wife and I arrived and were seated relatively quickly  and noted others who were seated after us. After being ignored for about 15 minutes  flagged down a waitress so we could get our order in. She brought us water - in a broken glass. 15 minutes later  they served appetizers to the trio that came in after us. Waiter replaced my broken water glass. 10 minutes later  full meal served to the trio and another couple who had arrived after us. 5 minutes later - total of 45 minutes had passed and all we had were water glasses -- we got up to leave. At least six servers hanging around the front desk with apparently nothing to do. Several open tables  so it wasn't particularly busy. At no time did ANYONE come by and give us an update Please announce when you have this problem fixed and we'll consider returning.
Teddy D.,San Jose  CA,2,28,1,6/5/2015,1.0,"I\'ve been here on several occasions thinking ""surely it\'ll be better than last time."" But each time I come I am disappointed with the service and cleanliness of our table. To avoid these elements I have tried ordering out from here  only to find that the portions we were provided were a lot less than what I would have expected. Avoid!!"
Ervi L.,Sunnyvale  CA,17,152,81,5/22/2014,5.0,Great place! Great staff! First time here. Didn't want to come here because of the bad reviews. But  after revisiting the Yelp page recently  I decided to try it out with my girlfriend. Glad we did!Our server was Shelby. She was so patient and nice. I hadn't seen my girlfriend for 3 months  so we kept talking non-stop. I felt bad for ignoring Shelby and kept asking for more time to decide what we were going to order. Sorry  Shelby (if you are reading). So  the food was really good. We ordered the fried calamari  Moroccan salmon  and Cherry Glazed Chipotle salmon. We both shared our food (like most girlfriends do) :)We both liked the Moroccan salmon more than the Chipotle salmon. The Moroccan salmon has a crunch to it while the other one doesn't. Since it's cherry glazed  it's sweet. So  it wasn't our favorite. Though the fried calamari portion is rather small  it's pretty good. I also ordered the Orange Twist drink. It's a little too sweet for me  but it's orange-y. I like it :)Our order came out pretty quick. It was super crowded when we went there around 7:30pm on Thursday. But  the wait was not too long. About 30 minutes to get a table. I will definitely go back again!
Kathryn W.,Gilroy  CA,52,5,9,3/17/2014,5.0,Angelina was our waitress and everything she recommended was awesome. Love the grilled chicken pasta and she suggested adding Cajun seasoning which was excellent! I added extra broccoli too. Yum!!
Jefferson T.,San Jose  CA,0,12,,10/18/2015,1.0,Wanted to sit next to the Baseball playoff game which was on only one TV. Despite asking nicely 3 times and despite there being ample available seats  we were not allowed to sit in the area. ????? We left and watched the game at Rock Bottom Brewery in the pruneyard where we were allowed to sit where ever we wanted.
Allison R.,Santa Clara  CA,49,161,52,2/24/2014,1.0,"I\'ve been to many BJ\'s locations  and am typically a big fan (as far as big chain restaurants go anyway). This was my first visit to this location  because I was meeting my parents for dinner before they were going to the airport nearby. Let\'s just say  I will not be recommending this location to anyone based on our service experience. I\'m not sure if our server was new  or maybe he was having an off night  but regardless of the reason  we didn\'t leave very happy.First tip something was off  my mom asked him if they had brown rice that she could substitute for white rice. He looked at her funny and then said ""oh ya  we\'ve got rice pilaf that is kinda brown..."" Ummmm  seriously? This guy didn\'t know what brown rice was. Then  I ordered a gluten free pizza with Italian sausage  fire roasted red bell peppers  and basil. The server asked me ""oh  so you want me to bring you a side of those hot pepper flakes?"" That\'s what he thought fire roasted red bell peppers were (which is an item listed right on the menu). I explained to him what I meant (even pointing to the item on the menu)  and he seemed to understand. After we all finished ordering  my mom said ""Wow  impressive! He didn\'t write any of that down."" I made the comment to her that we\'d have to see how impressive it actually is once we get our orders. Sure enough  my pizza was wrong.My pizza had green bell peppers  and no basil (which I don\'t fault the server for too much  for some reason the basil is missing almost every single time I order pizza from any BJ\'s location). I was going to just eat the pizza I was given because I\'m not that picky  but my mom was not happy. Besides  she is right; we should get the meal we order when we\'re paying customers.When I told the server my order was wrong because there were green bell peppers  not the fire roasted red bell peppers I ordered  and it was missing basil  his response to me was ""those are the only bell peppers we have"". I explained to him that I order this exact same pizza every time I come to BJ\'s (which is a true statement  I have been getting that same combo for years at various locations)  and the fire roasted red bell peppers is an item listed on the menu. He was also defensive about the basil and said he put that on the order. Like I said earlier  the basil is often forgotten  and I know he didn\'t MAKE the pizza  but he should\'ve checked to make sure it was correct before bringing it out. He took the pizza and said he\'d go check. Sure enough  he came back and said I was right  they do have fire roasted red bell peppers. He did apologize for his mistake  and offered me a free gluten free Pizookie or a free salad so that I didn\'t have to sit there without food while my new pizza was being made. I didn\'t really want either  but he was still holding the wrongly-made pizza  so I asked if I could just have that one to go instead. He said that was ok  and brought it back to me in a box. I got my correct pizza (basil and all) a little while later and it was piping hot  fresh out of the oven & it was delicious. When the server brought the check over  he apologized for the delay and said he had to have his manager take off the charge for the second pizza...good thing he did that before he brought it to us or he would have gotten quite an earful from my mom...It was very nice that he allowed me to take the incorrect pizza order to-go after I didn\'t want either of the choices he offered to make up for his mistake. But  it doesn\'t really make up for the fact that he wasn\'t knowledgeable about the menu (or even food for that matter...rice pilaf is NOT the same as brown rice buddy). I\'ll stick to other BJ locations in the future."
Julie S.,San Jose  CA,1,37,4,9/2/2014,2.0,I like the food which is why we came back but both times  even though we told them we are on our lunch hour  we had to wait about 45 minutes for soup and salad. The waiters and waitresses are nice but service too long.
Wolfman R.,Anchorage  AK,2,26,2,11/14/2014,2.0,Wolfman come to BJ's for dinner. Wolfman too tired to hunt and cook Wolfman's food. Wolfman come with great appetite from a long day at the office. Wolfman order appetizer before Wolfman order hamburger. Waitress did not ask what Wolfman want to drink. Wolfman try to howl for the attention that was needed to order drink. Without drink  Wolfman will die of thirst. Appetizer came 20 minutes later and drink never came after Wolfman asked twice. Food was filling but Wolfman no like service.
Amaris D.,San Jose  CA,170,16,3,5/17/2014,1.0,Customer service sucks. Our waitress made us feel like an inconvenience. Sorry I don't like to eat with dirty napkins no need to throw a new one at our table. Never again.
Ryan M.,San Jose  CA,3,12,2,10/13/2014,2.0,I have been to a BJ's located in Dublin and had a wonderful experience.......Unfortunately  this BJ's service was much poorer. The food took forever to make it to our table  the food was not very good  and it took them quite a long time to seat our party even though they were not swamped.
Eric M.,Gilroy  CA,0,4,,5/10/2016,2.0,because of the waitress messing up my order here i accidentally ate a piece of pork. thats not okay. i was pretty crystal clear about what i ordered. clearly said beef. i don't like pork and i don't eat it. i asked to talk to the manager and the waitress left and came back and told me the manager was busy. even though i could clearly see him standing by the bar. i'm not coming back. the food wasn't great either. when i did get my correct order it was already cold.
Emily K.,Hollister  CA,0,3,1,10/8/2015,5.0,The other day I had the pleasure of having a lovely server by the name of Brianna( she had red curly hair and earrings) Serve my whole table of 4 friends. She was absolutely on point with everything and super fast to bring out our meals. This is the first yelp review I've ever written and Ive never been quick to do this but she totally deserved this review. Im definitely coming back and hopefully she'll be there to serve us again! Great job Brianna! You're amazing (:
Clark K.,Stafford County  VA,0,78,,8/24/2014,3.0,This was a tough review. Got here on a saturday night at 7 pm. Party of two. Got seated pretty quickly for how busy they seemed. Ordered a delicious steak  mashed potatoes  and Brussel sprouts. Shared an artichoke appetizer with my GF who had the balsamic chicken. The food was as good as can be expected for a chain restaurant. The service was S L O W. Our waiter sucked. In fact  the people behind us took their check to the bar to pay because the waiter never came back to pick it up. He was not attentive. So the food was decent  the prices were okay. The service was mediocre. A lot of other chain food places to go to before going back here.
Will C.,San Jose  CA,0,6,,10/4/2014,1.0,1 star  because 0 stars is not an option. Manuel was our server. He is the single reason we will not go back to a BJ's. We ordered appetizers and entrees  Manuel found it appropriate to bring them all out at the same time. I asked why he chose to do that  he just looked at me and walked away. How's a $.95 tip sound? If I could take money from you I would. You suck.
Tito C.,Santa Clara  CA,31,9,,1/25/2015,1.0,"First off let me just say that I love this restaurant in general so this is not attack on the restaurant itself. However my experience at this one location certainly did put a sour taste in my mouth. I placed an order to go and arrived to the restaurant at closing to pick it up but they had already locked their doors. I signaled one of the waiters and even mouthed and said it out loud "" I placed an order to go and I\'m here to pick it up"". The waiter continued to say sorry we\'re closed and pretended to ignore me and walked away. Mind you he was pretty far from the door and did not make the effort to get closer to the door to give me an explanation or anything. I continued to wait and saw him walk by again and I repeated the process of letting him know I was there to pick up the order but he did not make an effort to get close to the door and had an attitude throughout this entire time. Finally a waitress went by and let me in and I told her I\'d like to speak to the manager about the situation. The manager was completely incompetent at her job when I told her what happened. She just gave me a lame apology and said that it was a matter of safety that waiters can\'t come close to the door. The waiter then showed up didn\'t really apologize when I told him how I felt he was rude and he still gave no apology. The manager didn\'t do anything else to reprimand him when I told her he could\'ve explained the safety issue and that he did not show any willingness to notify me or help me while I was freezing outside being locked out. I too have worked in customer service and both these two individuals did not do anything to rectify the situation  even the apology was half assed. All in all they need to train their employees and their management needs to be brought up to par. HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT."
James K.,San Jose  CA,1,3,,8/18/2015,2.0,We typically get decent service  but the host/hostess staff is so awful - literally every time we come here  we have some problem  whether incompetence  rudeness  or general carelessness - it's probably not worth your time or trouble to suffer through it. The food is decent at best. The beer is pretty good  but not worth the headache.
Sara J.,San Jose  CA,0,7,,10/16/2013,1.0,"Yuck! OK  I have never been to a BJs before  and this one opened up nearby so I decided to give it a try. I walked in and my first impression: its like a glorified Burger King but with booze instead of kids. I check the menu  and hey: Calamari (squid). And I love calamari  so I asked the manager if it was really calamari  little fried squid and he assured me it was. OK  I ordered. Then they tell me it will take about 15 minutes. What? That\'s like saying it will take 15 minutes to fry french fries. Why would it take so long. Answer: I guess they had to go outside and find some dried twigs (I\'m kidding but in a moment you\'ll understand the ""joke""). Finally  they bring it out  and  there are only 4 little shriveled up little squids about the size of a quarter  and the rest is gristle and chucks of breaded bread saturated in grease  and some thin little onion-ring like things also greased and breaded. And the taste? Uggh. Disgusting. So  of course I complain to the manger. ""Hey  there are only four little squids in this calamari order  the rest is little chunks of fried breaded bread and breaded twigs. This is a rip off. You sold me 50 cents worth of calamari for over $10.00 bucks.""What does the manager do? He argues. ""But that\'s the way it comes in the package"" he says. ""Its only supposed to have a few calamari. Its supposed to have all that extra breaded stuff."" Me: ""Its a rip off and I want my money back.""Manager: ""I can\'t do that.""Bottom line: No thanks. Never again."
Jessica L.,San Jose  CA,0,9,,11/17/2013,2.0,I was really looking forward to this location  but like the majority of other reviewers I am not impressed. I've been three separate times  had three different servers  and had three bad experiences. See rant below...First time we tried the call ahead list  but still waited 45 minutes once we got there. Service was okay- it was obvious she was new  but she was trying. Second time  we found an empty table in the bar right away  but our server was horrible. She was way too quiet for the loud atmosphere  didn't know anything about the food  and would ask a question but not wait for an answer- which meant we had to ask multiple times for sauces/drinks/etc- making her go back and forth  wasting even more time. My third and final visit was the worst experience yet. Another super long wait  only to wait again at the hostess stand after our buzzer went off. This wouldn't have been an issue had there not been 5 employees just standing around behind the stand talking and not paying attention to their busy lobby. Once we FINALLY got seated  the server took forever. I'm not even talking about the food wait time  cause I know that can take awhile on a busy night  I'm talking about not even stopping by to greet us for at least 15 minutes. Then she completely forgot to bring our drinks (we had to ask the food runner who brought our salads out)  and then she took another 20 minutes to bring us refills later on in the meal. It's not that hard to drop off a soda or glass of water... you can't control the kitchen  but you can at least make sure your tables aren't thirsty!I expected there to be kinks because this is a new location and there are probably a lot of new employees  but it's worse than I imagined. Their employees are unprofessional- standing in groups talking  walking in front of/cutting off guests  forgetting orders  saying inappropriate things  and just generally not paying attention. The managers really need to get their act together and start weeding out the people who don't deserve to be there. Wait time when it's busy is forgivable  but nothing else is.The reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because the food has been really good. My friends have also all enjoyed their meals. At least the chefs know what they're doing- though they seem to be the only ones. Looks like I'll only be ordering takeout from now on.
Esme L.,Santa Clara  CA,4,21,13,5/21/2015,1.0,I tried to give this place a -5. I came here in Feb for my bday. It was about an hr wait time after I called in 30 min before I arrived. That phone waitlist is usless. I came yesterday for my husband's bday and again  the exact same thing happened. We planned to come in at 7:30 since some of the children who came with us usually fall asleep by 9:30. Well  we arrived at 7:30. We were waiting to be seated for about an hr. After they seated us at 8:30  our food was served at 9:45. The kids were asleep. Horrible  horrible experience. They told us they had a party of 45 and they were priority. We tried to talk to the manager  but she also mentioned the party of 45. She was being somewhat sarcastic and didn't really offer a discount until we mentioned that the children did not eat their food becauae they fell asleep. She offered to comp those meals  but our whole night was ruined. Never coming back.
Third M.,San Diego  CA,45,6,2,3/2/2014,2.0,Meh...if Applebees is your American and Chili's is your Mexican then this may be your Brewery. I'm not a fan of their house beers (unrefined and nothing to em')  but they do have some regional favorites on tap. My turkey burger was a little dry  but eatable and our service was fine.
Charlie T.,Fernley  NV,88,10,,8/5/2014,4.0,They had a very good selection of beer  as well as good food. Was a little pricey  but so is everywhere in san jose. I personally experienced good service  and was overall satisfied with the visit
jim w.,San Jose  CA,0,33,,9/30/2013,1.0,"This rating is only for those seeking to watch a sporting event. This is  without question  the most poorly designed ""sports bar"" that I have even seen. There is a central television which can be ""split"" into several smaller screens. That is great if you get one of the four bar stools in front of the screen  or one of the tables directly behind it. Otherwise  you are cranking your neck to view what is a rather small  low quality television screen We waited for 15 minutes to get a seat only to sit at an angled stool for three minutes and walk out of this place and over to Chili\'s  which has far inferior food. This is really unfortunate since I have been to the BJ\'s in Cupertino on multiple occasions and found the bar to be a great experience. It is highly unlikely that this layout can be changed since the entire back of the bar is dedicated to showcasing multiple bottles of the liquor that is for sale.This was an absolutely dreadful experience for someone who lives within walking distance. I will NEVER return and I discourage anyone seeking to watch a game from entering this place."
Miryam Maria Z.,Santa Clara  CA,24,17,,12/11/2013,1.0,I really can't understand how they advertise crispy calamari and then bring a soggy one to me.... After an ok meal I decided not to order desert just to avoid another disappointing dish.
Charlotte D.,San Jose  CA,0,3,,9/13/2015,2.0,We've been to this restaurant several times with good experiences and good food. Unfortunately  they broke their winning streak tonight. Very slow service and very mediocre food. My Caesar salad was room temperature and limp. My calamari was also room temp when served and by the time I got to the last third of it was cold and mushy and couldn't finish it. My partner's meal of chicken was also room temp.
Kim D.,Fairfield  CA,747,336,2585,1/12/2014,2.0,Sigh.. If it had not been for the good service that we received from our waitress who offered to divvy up the checks for everyone and kept an eye on drinks that were low or extra napkins that were needed even when she had many other tables to attend to  I would give it just 1 star. Maybe it's because this is a newer BJ's  but everything was disorganized right from the get go. It was my friend's birthday  so she had made a reservation for 17 people a few days before since we were going to grab dinner here before heading to downtown SJ. They had even called earlier on the day of to confirm her reservation  but once we got there a few minutes before the set time  they said that they didn't have her name down for any reservation. After talking to the manager  she finally came back and said the wait would be 15-20min. Around 10min later  a different hostess comes by to tell us that our table was ready  so we all follow her and get settled at the table  only to find another large party standing behind us getting irritated because they said the hostess was supposed to seat their party instead of ours. So up we go again back to the lobby to wait for them to put together another table large enough to accompany us. Finally when they squished us all together  we ordered our food but unfortunately our appetizers came out after our entrees  and my salad took the longest and was the last entree to be served. Agh. Never again. At least my friend got her free birthday pizookie?
Louis L.,San Jose  CA,74,7,,4/2/2014,1.0,I've had 2 bad experiences here  enough to make want to write a review. First visit here I went with a group and everyone received their food except me. After several requests they finally brought out my burger and it was over cooked. Second experience here  I ordered take out. Apparently it goes to a Call Center and they relay the order to the restaurant. The restaurant never receives the order and they have to restart the order with a rush. I would avoid this place  service is terrible.
Eric C.,San Jose  CA,0,2,,9/9/2015,1.0,I wish there was a no star option. We've given this BJs three chances and every time is a horrid experience. If I wanted to wait on myself  I'd stay home. Horrible waitresses!!
Donna B.,San Jose  CA,2,27,,7/23/2014,4.0,I have been to this BJ's twice now and both experiences have been great. First time there I had the beer samplers with a chicken ceaser salad. Loved the sampler. It enabled me to sample five of the beers and there was only one that I was so so on. I adore the pzookies and had the salted carmel pretzel. It was delicious. The second time around I had the classic bacon cheeseburger and fries. It completely hit the spot and was cooked perfect. For dessert this time it was the macadamia white chocolate pzookie.....perfect
Julie S.,San Jose  CA,0,20,,2/20/2015,1.0,This particular store has gone down hill with service. On February 15  2015 I was there with two friends. Three to four waiters walked by us several times with no acknowledgement. After 15 minutes of being ignored  we got up and left to take our business elsewhere. I let the hostess know as we left  but she seemed to careless. Also  was there February 5  2015 before the Eric Church concert and the service was very bad. Waiter disorganized and food not done right. I work near the restaurant  but won't be patronizing this place anytime soon. The Oakridge location has always been great so it is the management of this particular location. I will stick with Chili's for now on!
Greg M.,San Jose  CA,312,17,,2/8/2014,1.0,Terrible terrible   terrible service... Wait  how could I say that? We never got fucking served! Waited to sit for 35 minutes....then waited another hour and not a soul acknowledged that we were there! How do you walk by someone who has their hand up trying to flag you down? Fuck this dump....
Scott N.,San Jose  CA,0,24,,10/17/2013,1.0,"HORRIBLE service. I understand that sometimes it takes time to properly train staff HOWEVER having a bad attitude is not something that should have to be gone over. To start  we called ahead. Yeah  their system (or staff) obviously have flaws. We were told it was a 25 minute wait. We arrived and checked in as instructed. Upon checking in  we were told we ""still had 30 minutes to go"". Wait  what? 30 minutes left to go on an initial quote of 25 minutes? What was the purpose of even calling ahead? To make the situation even worse  the marked attitude from the staff was ridiculous. We explained the what we had been told on the phone and she replied with a completely inappropriate attitude  saying ""You have 30 minutes left to wait. "" (?) I explained how I had to get something at Target before they closed (it was a Sunday and they closed earlier than during the week). After being told that we could potentially have to wait an extra 30 minutes before being seated  I didn\'t want to risk having to rush through our meal  so we could make it to Target before they closed. One person from the party stayed with the pager. Literally the second I walked out the door  to run over to Target  the pager goes off. How does a wait time go from being 30 mins to under 5 mins? If the staff was trying to accommodate - they need to learn to not how to do so. After getting the phone call saying the pager had gone off  while I was still in the parking lot  we decided to blow off BJ\'s. I have worked in a quest service environment before. I know how dealing with the public can be - it\'s not always easy. Some guests just aren\'t pleasant. This is EXACTLY why I never treat people who are assisting me poorly  unless it\'s deserved. The fact that we were treated the way we were was absurd. The ""Bon Qui Qui"" ghetto attitude needed to be checked at the door before coming to work. These people at the podium are the first point of contact for the BJ\'s brand/experience. Management should be appalled that this played out the way it did. We were initially excited that BJ\'s was going on at this shopping center - it\'s sad that it played out as it did. Management really needs to weed out these type of employees. These days  there is no excuse to hire such inexperienced and worthless individuals. It\'s called professionalism. Ya may not love your job BUT people need to learn to put the damn face on - you are being paid to represent a company. No excuse."
Amy Y.,Sunnyvale  CA,152,1,,4/28/2014,2.0,I'm never getting their salads to-go again. They give you a half portion from what you would get if you were eating in and yet you pay the same price. This has happened when I've ordered to-go in multiple locations.
Jen W.,San Jose  CA,4,60,12,11/11/2013,4.0,I can't speak to the restaurant service  I sat at the bar cuz I'm super smart like that. The service was prompt (cuz she's paid to be right there - see how smart I am)  friendly  and helpful (I think the barkeeps name was Erin  but it might have been Lucinda cuz my memory's that bad). My flatbread was cooked to a nice crispy-crisp  my salad was green and salady  and my beer was cold and beery. Awesome. Thanks. See you again soon.
Craig K.,Cupertino  CA,76,69,55,1/1/2014,2.0,Better parking than Cupertino's  but the service is really  really bad. The portions are smaller  and the waitresses are rude. The food came out really late  like 45-75 minutes later after ordering. This is not based off of one experience  this is based off of 4 separate occasions. They really need to fix what they are doing.
Grant C.,San Jose  CA,11,8,,12/3/2013,2.0,My family and I have gone to this BJ's several times. Once when it first opened and thought the problems were just growing pains. Now after being there four times I am sorry to say there is no progress. Once seated the waitress in whose section we were seated walked by us several times. A waiter then asked if we had been contacted and took our drink orders for us. When taking our food orders he cut us off several times. This lead to issues with our order. Once the orders came out my wife's was totally wrong. The person who brought it just walked away when we said something. The waiter came back and made an excuse for the mistake. My meal  the Bison Burger  was cold when they brought it out. I rather doubt we will be going back down there again.
T G.,San Jose  CA,0,52,6,10/11/2013,2.0,I would give 5 stars for our server Stephanie  however the 2 stars are for the decent food. 0 stars for the service (or lack thereof  before Stephanie) Arriving was weird. The staff were obviously not fully comfortable at this new location....awkward vibe during seating.Ok... Our server (he never said his name) came over took our order for 3 sodas  1 beer and 2 appetizers and returned about 5 minutes later with the sodas & no beer. Said the beer would be right out. He returned 5 minutes later to take our order and still no beer (at which point I asked about it and he said it would be right out) 5 minutes later he returned with 4 plates for our apps and the beer. We then placed our order for our main dishes. Quick & easy (we have been to BJs many times before - love the one at Oakridge  HATE the one in Cupertino near Apple). 10 minutes later he returned with a stand for the pizza we ordered and it was wet and had previous pizza all over it (I seriously gagged). 5 minutes later (25 minutes after we arrived) a female server (Stephanie) came over and informed us she was taking over for the guy (he was off and had gone home). I asked her to get us a new pizza stand and when she returned with it she informed us that she was aware that our apps had been put in 20 minutes before and she would bring them out ASAP and a manager would be over to talk with us about that. I told her the manager didn't need to come over  we were happy she was taking over. 1 appetizer came out and while eating it part of my main meal order came out! Not happy:( About 5 (or more) minutes later the second appetizer came out.Rest of the meal came out pretty quickly after that.Food was good  although my daughter's pasta (she orders all the time) was under seasoned. Sodas were refilled frequently without having to ask. I ordered a 2nd beer which took at least 10 minutes (from the time I started looking at the time)  so the manager (fully aware of our experience at this point) comped that one. Stephanie was a great server trying to clean up the mess the previous guy left her. As for the time it took the 2nd beer -- I am pretty sure that was fault of the bar.We won't come back to this location. We will drive much further to Oakridge. This location will be fine because they are a big chain in a good location. Management needs to iron out the kinks of being new and lazy staff.
Viviane K.,San Jose  CA,5,42,8,3/29/2014,2.0,Disappointed with the slow service. My party of 7 was quickly seated on a Sunday night  but we were at a table with poor lighting. I had one of the pasta dishes  which was overpriced and something I could've made by myself. Felt like we had to always search for our waitress (who was really nice)  but took a long time getting back to us. Should've gone to Sweet Tomatoes instead.
Jorge P.,Milpitas  CA,4,13,12,5/17/2014,3.0,Service-okFood-terrible  fish was over cooked and dry.Asked for med-rare steak and got med-well. -burger is bout the same as mcdonals new club burger. The 3rd star is honoring the 20% for using the online ordering while you wait
Steve M.,San Jose  CA,10,2,,6/25/2014,1.0,Come here frequently but last two visits service at bar has been terrible. Waited 15mins before someone would come to our table. Once we ordered drinks  took another 15mins to receive them. We will know longer come to BJs
Mary S.,Santa Clara  CA,5,29,8,3/10/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,4 days of food poisoning  still going. Ruined most of my week  had to talk to the doctor  etc etc etc. Never coming here again.
Mark A.,San Jose  CA,0,6,1,1/2/2015,3.0,Well they have happy hour which is great. The mojitos are hit and miss depending on which bartender you get. The hostess who seated us was very rude and had some kind of attitude. In the future would probably go to the Oakridge location.
R K.,Santa Clara  CA,0,4,,10/16/2013,1.0,"I wanted to like this place. It is really convenient located. 1st experience: sat night take out. Tried the online ordering  but they had a glitch and I had to call it in. Ribs and Thai mandarin salad. Ribs were good. ordered potato with bacon  they added cheese too. salad was light on the ingredients compared to other BJs. 2d visit: Fri night. not busy. Server friendly  but kept saying ""awesome."" Girlfriend ordered salad  and i ordered the Tuscan chicken. it took awhile  and when food arrived  the chicken was barely warm. Sent it back. they brought back another  and it was the same. offered to let the mgr taste a piece so she could see it wasnt me being picky. She offered another. I asked if they had a microwave. She said yes. I asked her to use that. it came back hot finally. The avocado egg rolls were tasty. 3d visit: Thought Id come back and try the pizza. Sat night after sharks game. Not crowded. ordered small deep dish with sausage and artichoke hearts. After eating about half It tasted a bit weird  and I looked closely. I saw green vegetable like material  that barely had taste. it looked like small pices of spinach. But there was also a funny texture  which I identified as cream cheese. Called waiter over and asked about it. He went to kitchen and came back. Told me that when you order artichoke they put their cream cheese spinach ""sauce"" on too. I told him it would be nice if the menu warned you that the funky sauce comes with the artichoke  so I could have either left artichokes off  or told them to leave their sauce off. Waiter said he didnt know til now  and he would now warn customers. They did make me a new pizza w/o the spinach cream cheese  and gave to me to take home. The pizza was ok  but pretty light on the sausage. Staff was friendly enough. Hopefully they will get it together. I think Im going to wait awhile before going back. The Chilis in the same center is more reliable for sure."
Bailey R.,San Jose  CA,30,33,2,12/23/2013,1.0,This is one of those times where I feel compelled to write a review to rail against a bad restaurant. This place sucks - I just don't get the appeal. The pizza was salty and no better than the pizza at a 7-11. And then there's the $10 Margarita - this drink was so bad that even after diluting it 50% with water  it was unbearably sweet. Its as if they use a Margarita mix and the bartender put way too much of it in to my drink - he should be fired. Our waitress was really nice and the dcor is trendy - maybe this is enough for people to queue up for mediocrity.
Paul T.,Campbell  CA,1,30,16,11/8/2013,1.0,BAD !!! BAD!!!! SERVICE !!! It just seems like every single BJ's in San Jose is down right horrible . Oakridge being the worst   but I visited the one on Coleman today and I got the same horrible treatment I've gotten every single visit . Is it just that BJ's is trained just to not give two shitts about the people who walk in. I waited almost 2 hours for a table that I was told only would take 45 mins   then the service was all attitude and no smiles . Never gonna enter an other bjs after this . 3rd strike
Rose A.,San Jose  CA,56,23,4,11/6/2013,5.0,First time dining at this new BJ's  Angelina was our server  it's a girls night so we've been at our table for hours. Angelina was so attentive  no pressure to order or move. She poured my wine and boxed up my food. So friendly and just a great dining experience. We'll be back for sure!
Matt L.,San Jose  CA,29,13,4,3/29/2014,5.0,Service and food were great. Good selection of beers. The waitress was polite  and the food arrived quickly. Not too loud.
Rich H.,San Jose  CA,0,1,,6/11/2015,1.0,"Went for lunch and the experience was pretty poor. It took at least ten minutes for our server to come and we didn\'t dare let her get away without taking our full order. The food didn\'t take too long  but the quality was ""meh"". The bbq lunch platter was dry chicken and a tiny pulled pork sandwich. It then took a long time to get the check and the piece de resistance was their losing my credit card. I didn\'t have to pay...but now I have to cancel my card and get a replacement.The manager was very apologetic and I know things happen....I\'m just bummed about having to do that."
Nicole M.,Milpitas  CA,12,44,12,3/8/2014,1.0,I'm currently here in a booth with my boyfriend and we were seated as soon as we walked in but have been waiting 15 minutes so far because no one has came to take our order yet. The tables around us have both been helped by different waiters and none of them have even asked us if we have been helped. A family of 5 came in 10 minutes after us and were helped while we sit here waiting. UPDATE: We had to ask a busser to flag down someone. The waitress didn't seem too happy as if WE were bothering HER! Pizza is ok though (we got the BJ special or whatever it's called). Definitely not worth this horrible service.
D Z.,San Francisco  CA,117,9,2,10/28/2013,1.0,This is the worst service I have ever received at a large chain restaurant. I went on a Monday night at 8:30pm.Firstly  there were four servers gathered around the front podium and although the host greeted us  they took their time to seat us and made us wait until they were done chatting. Secondly  the food was subpar because the ranch dressing on my house salad was watery. Lastly  when the bill came  we were charged for four desserts that the table next to us ordered. It baffles me that so many mistakes can be made within an hour. No thank you BJs! Not coming back!
Ben C.,San Jose  CA,4,13,,3/24/2015,1.0,The wait for online ordering is BAD  at least when I order 45 minutes ahead and they have one--count him  one--server taking orders.
Marcos D.,Sunnyvale  CA,6,28,1,4/26/2014,5.0,Don't know why all these reviews are so bad. I had excellent service. Stacy T was our waitress  and she was wonderful. She was very attentive and prompt with everything. Food came out on time  water/beer was refilled in a timely manner. Asked about our food really did everything required of her to provide excellent service. Food was good here too chicken wings hot and crunchy  deep dish was a good choice too.
Rachael T.,Oceanview  San Francisco  CA,97,5,,7/21/2014,4.0,Food was great  hot  and fair priced. It was by birthday  and I had kind of a large group but my waiter was awesome! Keaton (I hope i spelled that correctly) was my waiter  he cracked jokes with us  checked on our drinks frequently and was just an overall nice person. With me personal experience  sitting outside kind of rare for outstanding service.Now I would have given 5 stars  but the hostesses are horrible! BJ's has a call ahead option  and its wonderful for a friday night  that is if they actually put you on the list. Somehow the lady didn't actually enter my party on the call ahead list  which is frustrating but okay mistakes happen. What I am pretty upset about is why these girls feel the need to have attitude with me about it. It isn't my fault that they messed up  and I didn't even give them a hard time! I also overheard several of the girls making rude remarks about other customers. The whole front staff needs to be replaced.
Gin M.,San Jose  CA,10,13,,2/23/2014,1.0,I tried the baby back ribs today-very bad. Super dry and worthy of 7/11 foodoids. The nutty brewnette is amazing.... Service is shite! My visits will be less frequent. I only come around because It's convenient to other shopping in strip mall.
Dustin W.,San Francisco  CA,10,36,14,3/11/2014,2.0,This place could've been better if the they changed a lot of things. For one thing  the service was terrible  and the wait staff was untrained in the way that they couldn't even place the food down carefully. One of the wait staff almost ended up spilling our dish of calamari because he placed the rectangular dish down from one end. Second  it was hard to flag a staff member down to get a refill on my water. Lastly  when the food arrived  it was barely lukewarm. I'm probably not going to be coming back here because of the service.
Roqui P.,San Jose  CA,26,70,3,10/15/2013,1.0,Three reasons this place deserves a terrible review. First  we went here for Sunday morning football  there were 3 tables with guests but somehow it took forever for them to serve us. Second  we tried to come on an Friday evening and the place was crazy! No one was at the front desk for at least 20 min. Last  I called a week in advance for a party of 10  and they told me they had no openings till 10pm. Tried three times with either sucky service or no service. Won't be retrying this place again!!
Jon C.,San Jose  CA,98,7,,4/7/2014,2.0,Standard BJ's experience but with a longer wait time. Took us 2 hours to get a meal because of the inconsistency of servers here. 2 stars to be generous
laura m.,San Jose  CA,36,3,,9/18/2014,3.0,I love bjs and I have been to this one many times. I was disheartened to see so many negative service reviews. I have had spotty service before  but tonight our service has been great. Everything is prompt and our server  Alisha  is excellent.
Melissa S.,Reisterstown  MD,4,53,1,1/10/2014,2.0,The food is OKAY  but the service is pretty bad. After waiting 40 minutes for a table our buzzer went off. We went to the hostess station and were told it was a mistake and that our table isn't ready yet. Whatever. Our waiter was friendly enough  but he didn't put it our order right  so I received my meal and my SIL didn't. We waited another 10 minutes before hers came out. After that  our waiter was nowhere to be seen. We had to give our bill to someone else so we could pay  only to be told our waiter was the only one who could take our bill. Again  whatever. Certainly not the worst experience ever  but it doesn't make me likely to go back to this place.
Alan C.,Fremont  CA,67,45,15,1/29/2014,2.0,this location of BJ's is alright. came here with a friend and we started off with so drinks before digging into our dinner. we each ordered a beer and some appetizers  but man  it took awhile to get our drinks. the place wasn't even that busy (we were there at around 530pm on a thursday). when we finally got our drinks  we decided to order. i got the balsamic glazed chicken. it was slightly below standard. the chicken was decent but the mash potatoes were a bit dry. once again  took forever to get the food. after we were done  we wanted to get the check. no server to be found. this BJs is like any other  which are usually 3 stars. gave this one two cuz of the slow service on a non busy day.
Debra H.,San Jose  CA,0,2,,7/10/2015,4.0,We had a large group  eventually around 20  for happy hour drinks and apps. They were very accommodating and provided us seating outside (nice). I explained we needed separate checks for all of us  and we had expected to just purchase our drinks and any apps from the bar. But they said they would keep a tab for us then give us separate checks at the end. I was skeptidcal but they came through! Service was a bit slow at times  but granted they were busy and we had the large group.We were able to account for every charge on the final bill  which is really helpful with a group :-D
John D.,San Jose  CA,1,51,,3/17/2014,1.0,I went here last Saturday for Lunch.I walked in the front door and the teenager at the front grunted something that sounded like 'hey.' as a greeting. I smiled and told him there were two of us and asked if we could sit outside. He grunted  'sure  head that way' so we started walking toward the patio area and he said (audibly this time) 'uh  wait! I mean wait here.' After a minute or so another teenager came up and asked us to follow her. As soon as we 'headed that way'  teenager #1 grunted 'wait' again and came over to tell teenager #2 to go check with so-and-so to see if she wants more people or not. A couple of minutes later she came back  took us to the patio area and mumbled something. By this time I was fed up so instead of asking what she said  I chose a booth and sat down. She wandered off.Our waitress was polite and took our order after a few minutes. The only complaint I have about her is that she was never around when I wanted to talk to her. For example to order another beer when my first was finished. I ordered a Cobb Salad and it came in good time but the person who brought it (not the waitress) handed it to me instead of putting it down on the table in front of me. That's the first time I have seen that one. It was almost like she was saying 'here  I don't know what to do with this  you figure it out.'The Cobb Salad looked fine but something wasn't quite right. After a few minutes I figured out that they had put the Caesar's anchovy dressing on it instead of the garlic dressing they had advertised. By the time the waitress came back around and I mentioned it to her  she offered to make another one but it was too late since I had already eaten most of it and my mouth was coated with nasty fish taste so I had lost my appetite.The check came and it was $50 for two beers  a Cobb Salad with Anchovy Surprise  an appetizer pizza and a Root Beer. Not worth it at all.BTW I have to comment on the beer here: It is 'OK' and nothing special. The two different types I had were the IPA (flat and not very hoppy) and some kind of Scottish Ale they had on special (flat and the hops just didn't work with the malt - or maybe it was the anchovies...) I have been here before to try the beer and although I don't remember the specific ones I tried my opinion is a resounding 'meh'.Maybe they will tear down this place in a few months and try another restaurant  like they did with Chevy's?
M P.,Santa Clara  CA,0,5,,5/27/2015,1.0,CAN I SAY THE SLOWEST STAFF EVER?!?!?!?! You guys are horrible and always forget me when I'm sitting at my table. I usually forgive a business a slip-up on the first time mayyyybe the second time but you guys are extremely careless and forgetful!!!
Kristi H.,Grand Haven  MI,5,31,2,4/13/2014,5.0,Their week-end brunch is wonderful! We sat at the bar at 10 AM  had nice conversations with the bartender and other customers  watched sports on television  all while waiting for our car to be cleaned at AJ's! Really fun  will definitely do it again!
Alan T.,San Jose  CA,0,5,,2/8/2016,1.0,worst place ever. wait 30min to get water and take order  everything take about 15min to 20min to get the waiter attention. whole dinner 3hr...
Jon L.,Satellite Beach  FL,1,60,22,2/20/2014,2.0,This was our second trip to this location. Our server this time was great. Food and drinks came slow  but I don't think this was the servers fault. We ordered the sampler platter for a starter. Everything but the artichoke dip was deep fried and tasted like it had been in the freezer for a while. I ordered the mahi tacos...thinking it was going to be fresh mahi  I was disappointed when it was another deep fried item. Food quality could be stepped up a bunch  but the service is improving. Oh  and it shows they take reservations  but that's a big negative.
Vijay P.,San Jose  CA,0,10,,2/18/2014,1.0,I really like BJ's for good variety of food and great atmosphere. They have a good choice of food for everyone and for decent price. I normally go to De Anza location right next to Apple. This Sunday we went to their new location at Coleman's road San Jose. We were a party of 10 people. I was very disappointed at this place. We were shifted through 3 waitress. I can understand the long wait on long weekend but when we got seated it took quite some time to take our orders. The waitress was so much in hurry that did not bother to ask how we want my burger then when the food came out it was cold. It was quickly put on table and then there was no one to bring any of the condiments we waited for 5-7 minutes had to go search for some one to ask to bring the normal condiments. By the time food was so much more cold. We had to remind the waitress for our beer order which took another 5-7 minutes after reminder. I asked for glass of water and then waitress again forgot to bring it to table. I wonder if they are keeping up to good standard or just going down now. Overall experience was quite a let down and we are not going back to that location. Wonder if De Anza location has still good service.
Gilbert V.,Vallejo  CA,57,7,16,2/16/2014,5.0,Jason is an impeccable bartender. I have followed him from previous employers and would definitely frequent any employer that hires him. The food is good here and the service is wonderful.
Kim T.,San Jose  CA,0,17,,3/30/2014,1.0,No reservation and the wait time deserve one star.  Also pretending to take your name down on the waiting list and lying about the time? Need I say more?I would rather spend my money elsewhere.
Beini Q.,San Jose  CA,95,155,1,11/26/2013,2.0,I frequent the BJ's in Newark as I used to live and work in Fremont and my coworkers often meet there for lunch. The food is consistently decent and the service is hit or miss there  usually miss.I was really excited that they opened a location in San Jose but waited to go there due to all the bad reviews  especially long wait times and service. Last Sunday night  it was late and we had not had dinner yet or gone food shopping in a few days. Normally I would have gone to some divey taqueria but we have a baby now so off to BJ's it was.We were seated at a table by the side door opening onto the patio  which a server was leaning against to chat with some others servers smoking outside on their break. Cold air and cigarette smoke is not what I prefer for my baby so we asked to move. Our server was very sweet and helpful. As for the food  I was very disappointed by the mozzarella sticks  which I've ordered at least a dozen times at the other location. They were very dry  like if you open a box of frozen mozzarella sticks and then have it in freezer for too long and then try to cook them. I also hate that they always give you this dinky little thing of marinara sauce that is never enough for all the mozzarella sticks. I've asked for extra sauce when I order but they always forget. WAHHH! I also love their clam chowder but it is way too salty now. The only thing I enjoyed were the thai shrimp wraps which were delicious but extremely messy to eat. My other favorite is the potstickers. Come to think of it  the Asian inspired selections are all much better than the rest of the food lol.All in all  this is a chill place to come hang out and have a beer with friends. I always end up enjoying the company and the atmosphere a lot more than the food or the service.
Margie M.,Santa Clara  CA,8,60,8,1/30/2014,1.0,Went here on the 23rd for my birthday. Everything took so long to get to us that our meal lasted about 2 1/2 hours (plus they forgot to even put our dinner order in  so we had to go over the whole thing again). Our table was never cleared of plates or drinks  so we had to keep stacking items. Ahi salad arrived with no Ahi. Salad arrived that we didn't order. The only plus what we asked the manager to comp the meal  which he did plus gave us dessert. They even forgot it was my birthday  and ran back to put a candle on my dessert after I'd already started eating it!
Ruben M.,San Jose  CA,6,7,,1/29/2014,5.0,HIGHLIGHT: Our Server!! Brian C was our server he did an exceptional job! He had such a positive attitude and was so pleasant to deal with. Our food and drinks were on time and he made our time here enjoyable! I don't know why this BJ's have so many bad reviews. But my friend and I had an amazing time! Thanks for the service!!
Kyle W.,San Jose  CA,24,11,,1/20/2014,1.0,I've been here on 3 separate occasions only to be refused service. The last time I was there there were a slew of empty tables on the patio but was told it would be at least a 3 hour wait because not enough servers were available. Sorry BJ's  three strikes and you're out.
Todd W.,San Jose  CA,15,31,30,11/18/2013,1.0,We got take out and it was awful. They got the order wrong  the food was cold and the employees are confused and don't know what is going on. We ordered a beef and blue flatbread pizza  hold the mushroom and guess what? They held the beef and loaded it with mushrooms. The frys were cold and chewy  which is new to me. I didn't know fry's could be made chewy. BJ's has never been a favorite of mine but I still go occasionally. This has put an end to that.
Catherine S.,Santa Cruz  CA,78,15,,1/15/2016,1.0,Arrived at 7pm 1/12/15 - after calling and putting us on the list for 7pm. We waited about 4 minutes to be seated  it went downhill from there. We ordered our drinks  iced tea with lots of lemon and some calamari appetizer.The tea came and all the lemon was showed to the bottom of both glasses. (we kind of like to squeeze it into the tea)  asked for some sweet n low because it was not on the table  the calamari came  still no sweet n low  my friend got up and went to the bar to get it  the waiter came back after 4 minutes with the sweet n low. Our food took another 40 minutes. We were watching the Alabama game on the tv  all of a sudden during a championship game with no explanation at all  they changed the channel. When we went to the bar to ask that it be put back on the guy said my friend was being very aggressive  not true. After 5 minutes of the game not being put back on  he went to the bar again and the same guy rolled his eyes at my friend. A few minutes later the manager comes up to our table and says that if we have any problems to come see her  where was she when we were and she tried to tell us that she was in charge of the TV not the bar  well obviously she was not  the guy at the bar changed the channel and then got offended when he was called on it. When we asked the waiter for anything  it took forever to get back. Finally got our food  it was okay  not the best. We finally left at 9:06pm paid 61.00 for really bad service and okay food. The managers attitude left a lot to be desired  poor service all the way around.
Christina P.,San Jose  CA,0,19,,4/4/2014,3.0,The reviews are right on. The food is alright but not worth the money. The spinach artichoke dip was good. Customer service need a lot of improvement. The alcohol drinks were coming out steady. The people at our table that we're drinking water or soda never got a refill even after asking several times. Won't be coming back.
Jared A.,Pleasanton  CA,0,11,1,12/29/2013,1.0,I have given this place 3 chances and 2/3 times the service had been so horrible I refuse to go back. We waited 25 min and finally had to get up and leave as no one acknowledged us being there. On one occasion they never brought out one of the drinks we ordered  brought out our dinner salads before the appetizer we ordered 30 minutes prior  then less than a minute later brought out the main entrees. The beer and food is decent  never have been overly impressed. It looks like a fun atmosphere however I would never recommend this place to anyone.
Samantha B.,San Jose  CA,0,2,,2/8/2014,1.0,Worst service I've ever had at a bjs. Usually it's great but not a single person at our table got what they wanted. We ordered two of the same drinks and one looked way different than the other. The salad dressings were all wrong and the prices of our meals were different from the menu as well. Disappointed.
Gloria D.,San Jose  CA,19,8,1,11/10/2013,3.0,Great football happy hour. However  the food is not good. After visiting 3 times and ordering three different plates... I've came to realizing they don't put flavor in there dishes. I Will definitely visit for drinks and dessert only.
Con M.,Medford  OR,2,7,2,3/12/2014,4.0,BJ's food is always amazing and tonight was no exception. The burgers were perfect  the flatbread was delectable  and the Parmesan-crusted chicken was to die for. We came in 4 minutes before closing so we didn't get to experience the traditional service as our server was trying to close  but in general they seemed like a decent staff. I would go back again.
Litas L.,Santa Clara  CA,9,18,2,12/11/2013,1.0,"This is the worst BJs I\'ve ever received (no pun intended). Calamari soggy  flat pizza soft crust and oily  ribs are clearly boiled overcooked and tasteless  beans with ribs yellow soft and raw  bison burger meh. And the best part - manager with pride exclaims ""our veggies are cooked in microwave!"". I\'m sorry  buy even at home I don\'t use microwave. This place sucks. Only service was OK even though took 20+ minutes for a first order to be taken."
Kiran J.,San Francisco  CA,94,163,7,10/7/2013,4.0,BJs never fails! Good food and good drinks! Great service puts them above and beyond.
Kat F.,San Jose  CA,0,24,,8/28/2014,4.0,We had a pretty good dinner here  and I will suggest a return to try out the pizza (which looked and smelled fantastic). This is not fine dining by any stretch of the imagination  but good nonetheless. A little pricey for what it is  but the the dining area is beautiful  our server was pleasant and mostly attentive  the margarita was annoyingly lumpy  the white cheddar mashed potatoes were fantastic  the broccoli was perfect  the chicken was bland and a bit dry  the burger/potato wedge combo was good  the spaghetti was odd but edible  and our desserts were very good.
C E.,San Jose  CA,0,20,,12/7/2014,3.0,Bj's is a great place to enjoy a beer and decent food. It's very similar to cheesesteak factory but there are something's that cheesesteak does much better (avocado & southwest egg rolls). What I have enjoyed here are the burgers  flatbreads and pizzas and the bazookies are amazing
Michael W.,Sunnyvale  CA,2,3,,12/31/2013,1.0,Horrible Service and poor management. The floor manager Eric was walking around and talked to all the tables around us but never our table. First a dirty spoon with food on it. Then we tell the waitress they overcharged us and she gives it to the floor manager Eric and he fixes it while he is fixing someone else's ticket and delivered it to them right next to us but didn't bring our ticket to us. Then the waitress couldn't follow our instructions on splitting the check! Never go to this BJs it's horrible.
Audrey N.,San Jose  CA,0,18,,10/18/2013,1.0,Don't bother trying this location. You've been warned. Told that wait time is 30 mins  actually 1.25 hrs later (it was one of those we waited this long might as well situation). 2 hrs after we arrived  our entrees still have not yet arrived. Apps was def not worth this wait.
BL C.,San Jose  CA,0,42,,2/26/2014,2.0,Been 3 times to this location since they opened it. Two of the 3 visits were bad. Why? COLD FOOD on 2 separate visits! Appetizers small and came out AFTER our main meal was served (which was cold too). The restaurant is dimly lit...always. Service is slow.
Mel M.,Fremont  CA,2,37,4,10/25/2015,1.0,"This place is absolutely terrible! Let me tell you  my friends and I walked for the Alzheimer\'s association  afterwards we were hungry to we came here. You would think Santa Clara county excellent customer service right?! WRONG! We get there and the table still had the old check there I told the hostess and she\'s like ""oh your waitor will get it"" seriously? Just go give it to him you idiot we are sitting here! The waitor (Bryant) takes a lifetime to just even ask us for our drinks.... Then another lifetime to ask us for our food order. But this man is THE DUMBEST PERSON IN THE WORLD. So we put in our orders and we let him know my friend has a serious food allergy  she can\'t have dairy and he\'s like ok I got it. So she orders chicken wings and ribs and the lady brings out 2 orders of chicken wings and she tells her oh 1 chicken wing and 1 rib. And she apologizes and tells us she will take care of it. She did a great job. But here comes Bryant...... He goes ""did you not realize we had them in the wings?!"" And we were a little taken back so we all pause and I say ""but that\'s not what she ordered.."" And he goes ""oh but I got you don\'t worry I got you"" so ok we get our food the manager (John) brings us the ribs but at first he doesn\'t even know where she\'s bringing it and he looks around and we had to call him over. Ridiculous!!! How do you not know where you\'re going?! I call the waiter for the check and my friend says she wants the pazookie but put the ice cream separate and our other friend will eat it. She asks him ""are there any chocolate chips in the cookie?"" And he says ""no"" so she gets it. This fool comes back with ice cream on the cookie and I go ""but there\'s ice cream on the cookie"" and the waiter yells ""DAMNIT!"" Completely inappropriate! Unprofessional! He runs back and comes back with the cookie and ice crea separate but the chocolate chips are melted all over on top of the cookie! Seriously!!! Wtf! Then I tell him she can\'t have this and he takes it back and comes back FOR THE THIRD TIME! WITH A CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE! At this point I\'m done! So I ask another waitress  how is this cookie supposed to come? She said ""it\'s a sugar cookie with caramel on top and ice cream"" my other friend then orders a beer on the side from our waiter Bryant so she waits for that.. Then I ask for the manager... So here he comes... Looking like a doofus! Comes over unprepared and I tell him what happens and he then tell us he will bring the pumpkin pazookie for my friend we wait 10 mins and we are reading the sign.. The pumpkin pazookie has CREAM CHEESE! Jesus! The idiot waiter comes back and brings my friend her change for her beer... AND BRINGS HER THE WRONG CHANGE! HOW DO YOU DO THAT?! THE COMPUTER TELLS YOU WHAT THE CHANGE IS!! So the manager comes back and says ""well  I\'m glad I didn\'t bring you that cookie because it has cream cheese"" well good job you should\'ve known that in the beginning! And I tell him I don\'t want to see that waiter again you take care of this and return me my money for the pazookie"" and he\'s like ""oh did you pay for it?"" YES! WTH! WHY WOULD I SAY THAT IF I DIDNT! For Christ sake! And then we tell him the other waiter brought the wrong change and it literally took him 3 minutes to do the math in his head..... The beer was 6.25$ the change is 3.75$ not 3$! And here comes Bryant right after that conversation ""oh sorry I read the change wrong"" REALLY?! Terrible customer service  terrible management! And overall  The food wasn\'t even that great. We will never go back! And I told the manager he needs to inservice his staff and the cursing at the table was unacceptable! He wasn\'t even manager material! He didn\'t know what to say or do to correct the situation! Pathetic!"
M. O.,Beverly Hills  CA,0,9,,5/17/2015,1.0,I went with two friends a couple months ago to have an after work drink and munchies after a miserable day for all of us. It wasn't crowded bc it was only 430. We got seated right away but it degraded from there. We immediately saw four servers hanging around the exit door which is where we sat in our booth  and not one person came to our table in 20 min of waiting. I had to get the attention of the male server who of course said he thought someone else had our table. Before I got his attention we asked the useless hostess to get us a server and her response was  OK  if I see one I'll tell them. IF YOU SEE ONE? Really? This is the no talent that they hired? We were incredulous by her response. It then took another 20 minutes for us to get our drinks. Again  the place was near empty. I brought this issue to the manager's attention  who I watched during our visit and he looked like a goober  and of course  he did absolutely nothing about the situation. The least he should have done to recoup the situation was to comp out a drink or an appetizer. It seemed like the servers and manager had something better to do like talk and giggle  rather than serve customers. Good job  congrats.
Dave M.,San Jose  CA,0,35,,12/2/2013,1.0,Food was not good  very bland and could have been microwaved. Servers were very inexperienced. BJ's is not a place that is ready to be trusted with for a good night out with friends.
Anthony P.,San Jose  CA,0,26,,3/28/2014,1.0,Not good service and the staff is very disorganized. Went here a couple of times either they forgot or screwed up our order. Last they advised that the wait is 45 mins. Seen there was open seating outside asked about it they stated they were low on wait staff. Then stated the wait is for either or. After waiting for about 30+ minutes new people were getting seated outside. At least give the courtesy to people waiting first. Never going to another BJs cause of lack of customer service.
Kris G.,San Jose  CA,0,19,,10/31/2013,1.0,I have been here twice since it opened. The first time our food was so wrong we had to send it back. Service was ok.Tonight service is ridiculously slow. The restaurant is very empty and our drinks took close to seven minutes. My dinner salad consisted mainly do ice berg lettuce. And we waited for the check for way too long.The drinks were horrible.
Antoinette M.,Sunnyvale  CA,4,16,2,8/25/2014,5.0,i've been here many times and always liked coming here. this last time i went with all my biker chicks for a girls night and we had a great time. the service was excellent and the food was delicious. i shared a pizookie with one of my girls and it was on point. the server even did seperate checks for all of us which was awesome!thank you BJs for treating us #bayareabikerchicks so well =) we will have future dinners there.
stacey p.,Santa Clara  CA,4,21,,8/21/2014,1.0,Horrible. Tried to make a reservation for 7 ppl. Was put on hold for almost ten minutes. Their recording says reservations can be taken for 7 or more but when they finally took my call  the girl said 8 or more and wouldn't take my reservation. She said the recording was a mistake and actually asked me to find one more person to add to my party. Huh? As a courtesy she should have taken it down anyway. The food is mediocre at best and we've had bad experience with the service  so no thanks and after this time  no more. They just lost 7 customers.
Teresa M.,Campbell  CA,1,62,2,9/14/2014,3.0,"I\'ve been to this location a few times and mainly after a target shopping trip. Nothing amazing but it\'s there and convenient. Usually go to the Cupertino location. Few weeks ago didn\'t have a great experience. Emailed and a manager contacted me to get more info. He apologized and offered compensation. I would give this location another try. Kitchen could have had an ""off day"" when we went."
Wendy F.,Santa Clara  CA,30,3,,8/31/2014,3.0,My husband and I stopped here looking for a good meal. Our server was actually really responsive and our food came out quickly but the food was an issue. First our calamari appetizer was overcooked to the point it was beyond chewy and the breading was bitter. Our server was great and offered to replace it but we had entrees coming so I passed on more/fresh batch. I ordered a burger and had to send back because it still had lettuce on it (ok so I admit I could have pulled it off myself but I told the server about it when he brought it to the table and he immediately took it back) my husbands scallops were another story. The asparagus that came with the scallops was inedible. Whoever cooked them had loped off the tender tips and cooked the woody ends. My hubs is a good sport and tried to eat them but couldn't. So I will give my waiter Tony and the mgr Chris props. Tony was very attentive and wanted to make it right. So did his mgr Chris who seemed happy to get the feedback. They are the only reason I can give this place 3 stars. I hope they will continue to work hard to improve the customer experience and I hope the kitchen will take the feedback and improveIt's issues.
Robert L.,Santa Clara  CA,0,19,,11/15/2014,1.0,The BJs on Coleman is just ok. The one in Cupertino is much better. The food us better fir dome reason. Coleman BJs us always packed and too loud. Annoying!!!
Tom D.,San Jose  CA,0,96,3,8/13/2014,5.0,Denny's with beer. Menus  with pictures of the food  for those who can't read. Plastic covers for the menus for those who like to spill. And lots and lots of choices for those who can't decide. Try the broccoli cheddar soup. Cheez Whiz with Brocolli? LOL  nasty. For anything else  you really won't need your salt shaker because every dish is LOADED with salt. But hey  its a big company  not fine dining. Servers are always happy and attentive. Just like Chotchkis.
Majeed M.,Downtown  San Jose  CA,1,6,2,10/7/2013,4.0,Lives up to the BJs reputation! And there are big screens everywhere so u will NEVER miss a big sports moment!
Jill G.,San Jose  CA,0,14,,10/27/2014,1.0,Service was the problem our food was good. I hate runners! The runner delivered all but one of the entrees. One in our party had no food. No server ever came back to check on us. At first we all waited for the last meal to be served only to end up eating cold food ourselves. We finally had to start waving our hands over our heads to finally get some attention. The missing meal was finally delivered when we had to get the attention of a manager. Drinks were never refilled. Now I could understand this if the restaurant was busy  but it wasn't. Get rid of the runner concept. Servers should deliver their customer's food! This way they can see mistakes and even more important notice when someone didn't get served.
Melissa D.,San Jose  CA,55,22,1,7/27/2014,3.0,Not a great service experience - they don't like to sit singles - already had to send back my app (spoiled ahi) hoping it gets better
Joy B.,San Jose  CA,34,12,9,9/5/2014,1.0,#1 WORST BJ's experience! We've had BJ's from Burbank to Sacramento- Fresno to Salinas. Honestly  my best two were those! We always felt like we could walk in and know what we're getting with this chain- but apparently NOT THIS ONE!!! They must be hurting for money because our pizza (BJ's favorite) had VERY little toppings and honestly  we'd asked for extra sauce and got light sauce. When we told the waitress  she offered to bring us sauce  ensuring it'd be heated- I know how they do things- she was going to microwave it and serve it up COLD! You should make me the next Long Island medium... This is exactly what happened. Next she offered to run it through the pizza oven as if that would heat it up. We said never mind because not only was the pizza lacking on so many levels... The carnitas fries were DISGUSTING! Cold uncooked verde sauce atop soggy shoe-string fries and carnitas that resembled tree bark  both in appearance and taste. Such a let down! Not going to give BJ's franchise any more of my money for sure! It's only good 1 out of every 3 times. This one was particularly horrible  so I wanted to warn people. This is to let the public know it's a place you should run away from because they are cutting corners BIG TIME! When the manager came over I explained all that I just explained above and he offered his apology and agreed you can't expect pizza sauce to be cooked in a microwave. So he only offered to take off the pizza which we adamantly refused to eat or take with us anyway- but no apology for our tree bark fries. Then as they both stood at the register and removed the pizza from the ticket he was saying something about us and laughing with her- After bringing us the bill for the fries and wings they offered a pizookie  if you can't make your other food right why would I trust you to make anything else? Diners beware! You would be better off going to wing stop or keeping away from this area altogether! BJ's corporate  this kind of bar lowering standards is sure to bring your profits LOW!
Jessica N.,San Jose  CA,52,19,4,2/24/2014,2.0,All I have to say is that the only thing that was good was the food. We came on a Saturday around ten thirty and day at the cocktail area. Expecting to wait a long time to be greeted we actually only waited five minutes. We both felt pressured to order right away since our server frank kept hovering over us . We then ordered our drinks and entrees. He came with our water and soda at a reasonable time but I waited for my pumpkin beer for a long time. It took so long that my boyfriend had asked him about the beer again and it seemed like he forgot to ring it in since the bartenders did nothing but walk around in circles doing nothing. I received my brew right before our entrees came out. The service was very awkward and we felt pressured to leave right away. We finished our food and I barely drank my brew because it was just plain awkward. I've been a server for years and I just could wright a list of mistakes that our server and hostesses made. After we paid we left and seen five hostesses at the stand they sat around talking instead of saying have a goodnight like most places.
Rose B.,San Jose  CA,0,67,,10/7/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Went there last night with a friend  wasn't fond of going there but my friend I was taking to dinner wanted to try it out. Should have insisted we go elsewhere  service terrible still  food horrible as usual. I ordered a shrimp Caesar salad  it was like eating a bowl of dry lettuce  hardly any dressing  lettuce wilted and brown  old lettuce  horrible and next time I will INSIST we go elsewhere as things have not changed  the place was dead and I can see why. Go to Chili's next door  better service  better selection and better food by far.
P C.,San Jose  CA,2,18,,10/15/2013,1.0,Horrible service and unfortunately the food wasn't any better. I would give it a few stars for the beer selection but the service was so bad that I feel it pulled the overall rating down. As for my experience  it involved being told the wait would be a certain amount of time only to have it extended by 15 to 20 mins each time  so a 30-45 min wait actually turned out to be close to an hour and a half. Had they told me the wait would be an hour I never would have waited.  wait staff were great but the a host and the manager were actually close to being rude with us. Food....no thanks  everything we ordered seemed overly greasy
Jocelyn A.,Santa Clara  CA,0,3,,2/8/2014,1.0,Kids meal served not as described.   Hamburgers always with cheese overlooked.   Manager kristopher Kent no caring just blames server. Really
Lauren W.,Campbell  CA,0,20,1,6/3/2014,5.0,Great happy hour! We had a large group here on a beautiful sunny afternoon and they accommodated us so well! Thanks  BJ's!!
Therealist D.,San Jose  CA,32,14,,7/10/2015,1.0,My first experience here the waiter never brought us utensils and she never refilled our lemonades or checked on our table....so i gave it another try today thinking maybe service will be better i was wrong...first i ordered some avocado rolls for appetizer and a pizza i said no bacon or ham for religious reasons we cannot have bacon or ham on our pizza ... so pizza gets there 30 minutes later and no appetizer.... i told the lady and she told our waiter i said never mind just forget it at this point. I took a bite and then i felt something rubbish and my worst nightmare it had bacon!!!! my son bit a piece too and i immediately made him spit it out i spit mine out and told the waiter..manager came and he said they will re make it another 35 min later i ask him a box it it's too late and he did i walked out and right before leaving i checked box and what did it have bacon all over the pizza... im so mad i feel like they mockingly added a lot of bacon to piss me off i was so mad i left angry i told the manager he didn't say nothing he felt stupid and i left .. my sons were starving and so was i and my sister we were so hurt that they didnt think it was important as it was to us ..never returning here again ever!!! If i don't want bacon respect my choice please if it was your belief you wouldn't want anyone disrespecting you don't it to me either im so hurt and mad so livid saddest part it was my nephew's birthday and he didn't eat anything and his day was ruined..oh we never got plates or any utensils or refills either today dont eat here bad service
Keith R.,San Francisco  CA,0,8,,10/8/2013,2.0,Got soggy pizza that was straight from the oven and I only live a mile away from restaurant. And today got spaghetti with meat sauce. They only gave enough sauce for 1/4 of the pasta  pasta was dry  and bread was hard. Really trying hard to give this place because I still have fond memories of BJ's 20 years ago when I was living in Long Beach.
Mark Z.,Campbell  CA,1,5,2,1/25/2014,1.0,"I just had the WORST dining experience of my life. I went to this BJ\'s for lunch with my son and chose to sit on the patio. I asked our server for an umbrella to give us a little shade and she complied. Few minute later  another employee  a young girl introduced herself as ""Mattiana""(may have given wrong name since she had no name tag!) showed up and moved the umbrella without asking. When I nicely told her that we asked for that umbrella and our server put it there  she started yelling and screaming and suddenly laughing saying she doesn\'t care. At that time I thought that either she is on drugs or we are being pranked! When I asked for her name she said"" I don\'t care what you go and say about me because I am quitting today"" and then she started laughing out of control. Unbelievable!!!I went inside and asked for the manager. He came and I calmly explained what happened. He listened but I could tell he just didn\'t want to be there himself. He said ""I take care of it""   but I know he did nothing because that girl was still laughing as we were leaving. The manager never made any gesture of apology for the embarassment his employee caused myself and my son. I am still in shock!"
Casey N.,Aptos Hills-Larkin Valley  CA,25,168,,12/4/2013,2.0,"Had a late dinner last night at BJ\'s because it was convenient and open late. I\'m completely in agreement with the other 1 and 2 star reviews who cited the service as being awful. Wow.. we were just amazed how lousy it was. From the moment we walked in to leaving an hour and a half later  it got progressively worse.When I walked in  I was completely ignored by the hostess. In fact  instead of making any eye contact as I walked in and stood in front of her at the reception desk  she walked away for a few minutes without a word to chat and laugh with a server. When she returned  she did not greet me  never smiled  was really unhelpful  then mumbled something  and was annoyed when I asked her to repeat herself. Even though the restaurant was maybe 20% (at most) filled with diners  she told me to take a seat and someone would take me to the table. I was fine waiting since the others I was meeting hadn\'t arrived  but thought it was odd. I\'m now trying to give more benefit of the doubt to people in customer service if they have a bad day  so I tried to shake her attitude off and tell myself that she must be having personal problems.Once seated at the table  the server did not check in for nearly 10 minutes. He was very nice  but distracted - I ordered iced tea and water and he then asked if I wanted anything to drink. It took many minutes for the beverages to be delivered. When my party arrived  it took several minutes for him to come back and ask them for their beverage orders. Just periods of looooonnnnggg delays between sightings of the waiter and his return. When we were ready to order  he brought over another server and said he was leaving on break and she would be taking care of us. She also seemed very nice  took our order by memory  and then disappeared for a long time. Expediters delivered our salads 10 to 15 minutes after we ordered  and then brought out our entrees a couple of minutes later. No ""do you want an extra plate since you\'re splitting"" or ""would you like some steak sauce"" or ""would you like a steak knife"" or ""can I bring you more water or iced tea""? We flagged down our server several minutes later to ask for steak knives  an extra plate  more water  etc. Again..... long delay. Used the salad plate as the extra plate and sawed through the steak to divide it with a regular knife.The meals were okay. Our wedge salads were funny. A little slice of iceburg lettuce with some very sweet blue cheese dressing  perhaps a 1/2 teaspoon or less of crumbled bacon  and 5 tiny chunks of tomato. The sirloin steaks were prepared perfectly  but the vegetables were tasteless and hard. They had a special that included a lobster tail with the steak  so we ordered that and the tail was fairly small (to be expected for the price) and seasoned with curry. I didn\'t mind  but it was a bit odd.When we were finished  our empty plates (salad and dinner) were all over the table and our water and iced tea glasses empty. Even when the server came back eventually to ask if we wanted dessert  she nor anyone else picked up the plates. We paid the bill and left without anything being removed from the table. When leaving  there were two ladies at the hostess station. Neither said ""thanks for coming"" or ""drop dead."" For a chain restaurant that competes for business with others in the area  I would expect that they would have some type of training and customer service standards? I was just pissed by the time we left. Prices were reasonable and BJ\'s definitely has a wide variety of items on their menu. We read that Tuesdays are 1/2 off wine night  and they offer some very nice wines! I would prefer not to give my money to this restaurant after our experience. We\'ve been to the BJ\'s in Cupertino a few years ago and enjoyed it. This was nothing like that experience.I\'m being very generous with the 2 stars  hoping they get their act together. But  actually and somewhat sadly  I couldn\'t care less whether this restaurant is successful."
Debra-lea O.,San Jose  CA,0,4,,7/12/2014,1.0,The service was lacking and the food was even worse. My food arrived with ingredients missing  the servers were completely confused  and we sat for over an hour waiting for something to happen. We never quite figured out who our server was because people kept coming to the table asking if we needed help. I won't be going back.
T X.,San Mateo  CA,1,11,,11/19/2013,2.0,"Second time for lunch at this location and lots of problems. Extremely slow service  untrained servers. First time - asking for dressing choices  the waitress literally says ""we have a very long list of like 30 of them"" - but couldn\'t come up with any. Waited 20 minutes for soup refill on soup/salad combo  etc. Second time - waited 25-30 minutes for food (lunch time!) to be told it was ""stuck in the computer"" and didn\'t get placed. Just overall unprofessional disorganized service. Food fine  so it gets 2 stars for that."
Kai Chung Anderson L.,San Jose  CA,92,45,7,2/21/2014,4.0,I always oet the BJ's Favorite Deep Dish pizza at every BJ location I went to  so there was nothing to fancy to talk about. I also got the combo appetizer this time  and it was decent. I must say getting those two items together for only two people weren't the best selection. Server was friendlier than the other SJ location I must say. At least she remembered to bring out parmesan cheese and pepper without us asking her  and she brought out the ranch sauce quickly when requested.
Lilach S.,Saratoga  CA,24,1,,4/26/2014,5.0,I held a birthday party here for my 13 year old son with 30 kids. The service was incredible!!! Kristopher Kent  the manager  met with me before the event because I was so nervous  but everything ran very smoothly. The waiters were great and the food was delicious! The kids had a great time. I definitely recommend this location!
Kenia D.,San Jose  CA,0,47,,6/1/2014,4.0,Service is always good  food is pretty consistently good and satsifying. I crave their pepperoni pizza on a weekly basis!
Angela D.,Morgan Hill  CA,21,16,2,3/27/2014,1.0,My brothers and I decided to take mom to BJ's for her birthday. Waiter comes out with our drinks. He dumps the entire soda directly into her lap. Since she was sitting in the middle of the booth  she of course can't escape. What does the waiter do? Stands there dumbfounded. Doesn't immediately grab napkins. Nothing. Just stands there. After about 4 min of this  he waves a busboy over to clean the mess. Waiter doesn't lift a finger. At the end of the meal  he only comped us for her soda. W.O.W. They call that service? And so much for hearing happy birthday being sung. One waitress comes out and drops off some small dessert. Then walks away. Never eating at BJ's again. Poor POOR service.
Mariah G.,Milpitas  CA,0,5,,4/6/2014,1.0,Seriously thee worst customer service ever! We get there at about 8:30ish and a few people get there after us and get seated before us by the time we get seated it's about 9:15 by the time the server comes to take our order it is about 9:30! I ordered a mock tail since I'm 6 months pregnant  and after I finish my first one I get a mojito as a refill... I didn't sip it since I realized what it was. Then my husband ordered shrimp in his pasta and got chicken! The service was HORRIBLE! Little to say I'll never go back to this bjs!
Sunny K.,San Jose  CA,3,25,2,10/26/2013,1.0,I rarely give a one star rating but this place takes the cake for worst service EVER! Dined in tonight and never have I been so irritated after paying good money. Since when was it bad to dine in with a group of friends after 9pm for some drinks and appetizers? Our tab was almost 100 dollars in drinks and appetizers and our server deliberately told her two other co workers to not serve us because we didnt order entrees. Our server even had the nerve to come by to our table after she talked shit about us to tell us about how gratuity works...... Employess are unprofessional and need to be trained better. If you don't even know what drinks you have in stock then offer something else. Our server coulnt even offer us drinks when I simply asked her for something sweet.... It also took forever just to get our beers  only time she came by to our table was to see if we were going to order entrees when I deliberately told here were here for drinks and appetizers and that we would tell her if we needed anything. Word of advice  don't talk about your table when you're two feet away  at least we had the decency to leave you 15% tip. Never ever coming back here again!!!!
Craig B.,San Jose  CA,1,6,,3/25/2014,1.0,Service sucks! I have been there three times - Each time I stand around waiting for someone to help me and it takes forever. All three times they have made my order wrong..Yes all three times haha - So sad it's almost funny. I was so excited about them moving in but will not be returning due to service.
Anita M.,San Jose  CA,0,4,,3/18/2015,1.0,really bad customer service the wait is horrible we had had a big party but still two hours waiting for our order was horrible will never go here again bad experience not sure if they were being races but they looked at us like they were!!!!!!!! HEADS UP they don't sing happy birthday either and only give a cookie with a scoop of ice cream and walk away!
BIG M.,Milpitas  CA,8,15,26,10/26/2013,1.0,First time and last time here..waited 10 min for tables. 20 minutes before I asked for a manager and she came. She gave us appetizers and drinks free but does nothing for me. The waitress was nice  it was not her fault but operations needs to be better. I might return and see if anything is different in 6 months.
Susan M.,San Jose  CA,39,5,2,11/22/2013,1.0,A lot of these reviews about slow service are correct. My family of 5 had a late lunch there last Saturday around 1:30 or so. The place wasn't very crowded and we were seated very quickly. We waited forever to order drinks and appetizers. After another long wait  she brought my kids drinks out  then the appetizers  but still not the beers my husband and I ordered or plates for the apps. She said she would bring us plates. She came back to take our order for lunch  but didn't bring plates so took off again. Finally  we got the plates then waited forever for lunch. We finally finished by almost 3 pm because they were so slow. Ridiculous considering it was not busy. Food was only meh! The BJ's at Oakridge is busy and usually has long wait times  but their staff is better trained and worth the wait. Not sure I want to come back again after ready all these other reviews and seeing they had a bad experience as well!
Carol R.,San Jose  CA,0,23,,2/24/2014,2.0,"First I have to say we usually really like BJs as a chain  and we were super excited to find one opening just a few miles from where we live in San Jose..at previous BJs the food is usually consistently good  the atmosphere and lighting is very nice  great real sodas and excellent beer. Unfortunately  in THIS newly opened BJs  we\'ve not experienced what we are used to at BJs. It looks the same (atmosphere/lighting) but the service leaves a lot to be desired.  Since they opened  we\'ve been there at least 6 times...each time we\'ve experienced slow service  and very long wait times for ordering a 2nd round of drinks.  The wait-staff seem to be quite inexperienced  but most have been reasonably pleasant. Our most recent experience 5 of us were at a table in the bar.  When the waiter finally noticed us and came over to take our order  he could not tell us if happy hour was still in process or not  so we couldn\'t tell what to order (this despite the happy hour menu on the table and the fact that if there is a game playing - there was - in the past  BJs has called that happy hour) -- so it took him some time to find a manager to determine if happy hour was still ""on"" (it wasn\'t) -- took ages to get the first round of drinks. . we ordered a 2nd round ...[place was only about 40% full] - for ages our waiter kept walking past our table delivering drinks to others all around us.  After about 20 minutes we flagged him down. He looked annoyed and said  ""we\'re out of glasses .. as soon as the kitchen has some clean ones I can bring your drinks.."" -- and he walked away. We sat there staring at the clean wine glasses and little wine carafes sitting and hanging above the bar  watching the bartender pour a martini into a glass for someone who had just ordered one. I would have pointed out that we had a set of empty glasses on our TABLE and perhaps if the waiter TOOK THOSE BACK to the bar they\'d be able to use those  But no - -the waiter had walked off (after us also telling him that we\'d like to order some food).  [Really I don\'t know why I\'m not giving this place 1 star  except I am reserving the 1 star rating ""standard"" for the Worst Dining Experience Ever that we had a few weeks ago in Japantown at Wings. . . and this experience was NOWHERE NEAR as bad as that!]Anyway - I asked to speak to the manager.  The ""manager"" was really out of his depth - didn\'t seem to know what to do or how to handle the situation. Got a lot of canned  ""I understand can I do anything ELSE for you?"" (you know - that passive aggressive sugary question that requires the complaining customer to answer in the affirmative as though everything is all right when it\'s not..) -- we finally got our drinks . . but the waiter never returned to take a food order. The manager  out of the blue  said he\'d ""ordered some complimentary appetizers"" for us  which was certainly an effort to do something to make up for the bad service/waiter\'s snarky attitude  but we didn\'t WANT appetizers - we wanted to order a meal (which we were not expecting to be given to us free) - and instead of giving us a choice of what we wanted to order  a random selection of fried items appeared on our table.When they first opened I chalked up this sort of experience to a green staff  a newly opened facility etc.  - but honestly  it\'s not getting better and they\'ve been open a while now.  They need to train their wait staff and get some experienced managers in there."
Yen C.,Atherton  CA,0,37,1,3/23/2015,2.0,food was greasy and overpriced.  with so many good places to go in downtwon San Jose which is just a few blocks away. . I should not have settled to go to BJs.
Frankie M.,San Jose  CA,0,7,,2/9/2014,4.0,Oh man this places parmasian crusted/crispy chicken is so delicious! The mash potatoes are so creamy and the chicken is just mm to die for. Im writing this as im sitting here eating it yummy. Best plate of food ive ever had!! The wait was not long at all either and a more busy sunday night. The staff is super friendly too.
John D.,Walnut Creek  CA,8,34,5,12/24/2013,2.0,Service was very poor and it's slow here maybe at 15% capacity the food on the other hand was excellent we had calamari and sweet pig pizza delicious!!!!
AW B.,Milpitas  CA,0,6,,1/21/2014,2.0,"I\'ve been a fan of BJ\'s until I came to this location  unfortunately. Maybe we were just unlucky this night. Our waiter took our order & shortly after addressed that a different waiter would take care of us since he was going on his break. I didn\'t mind until we sat there forever waiting for our food. A waiter was walking around with orders & it was brought to our attention that he was going table after table asking if that was their order (very professional  right?). I automatically knew that it was ours but he seemed to ask all the tables BESIDES ours & went back to the kitchen with the food. We were almost 100% sure it was our order. Then a different waitress asked if we wanted dessert  but was totally unaware that we\'ve been waiting patiently for our main dishes. We wanted to tell her  ""Bitch it\'d be nice if we got our food first!"" I know it wasn\'t her fault  but we finally got our food after hella long & what do ya know  IT WAS COLD & the noodles were hard. They could\'ve reheated it or something! Our assumptions were right  it was probably sitting in the kitchen that entire time because the waiters had no clue who it belonged to. Will not return to this location because of their bad service.& to add  I normally would order a pizzokie  but I was so livid that I just wanted to get the fuck out of there!"
Vernon M.,San Jose  CA,1,44,2,11/7/2013,2.0,I think I will like this place  once they get their act together. They recently opened  the beer is great  but they clearly don't have the kinks worked out yet. Ive been here 4 times. 2 were ok  2 were bad.  You know its an unsuccesul evening at a restaurant if after 2 plus hours you have to go to Wing Stop next door to get something to eat. Tonight  I waited 45 min for a seat at the bar. I would have liked a beer while waiting  but oh well. Finally got a seat at the bar  and ordered quickly  an appetizer and a pizza. The app was slow to come out  but they were busy  so no big deal. Later  the server apparently dropped my pizza on the floor. The bartender apologized and said they would get another right out.  40 min later  the gesticulating and pointing made it clear that no pizza was coming.  The manager apologized and said he didnt know what happened  but would comp me a pizza next time which was nice  and the bartender comped me a beer  also nice. But in the end I still ended up at Wing Stop for dinner. So I hope they get their act together.
Cee B.,San Jose  CA,1,75,3,9/20/2014,4.0,Friday night. Only a 15 minute wait for two. Nice. Started off with the Calamari.  It came like 5 minutes after we ordered it. RED FLAG. How do you prepare and cook Calamari in 5 minutes during dinner rush? I took one bite and it was soft and stretchy. Yuck.  I told the waitress it wasn't good and she said she was surprised at how fast it came out too. Mind you  our original waitress is not the one who brought the Calamari to our table  which leads me to my next comment. We had 4 different waiters that waited on us in the 2 hours we were there. #Weird! Were they playing Musical Chairs in the kitchen or what? Aside from that everything was good. I've been to every other BJ's in the Bay Area and this one is #2 on my list. #1 is BJ's Cupertino. I took one star off for the bad Calamari  which they took off the bill....but whoever made it had to have known they half assed it. Ready in 5 minutes?  This aint Little Caesars!
Johnny P.,San Jose  CA,0,13,,2/1/2014,4.0,me and a couple of broskis wanted to grab some brewskis we were in the area and also hungry so we decided to stop by this newer location. got two deep dish pizzas and a couple glasses jermiah red. and I just had to get a pazoooookie!
Jeff S.,San Jose  CA,0,4,,11/21/2013,2.0,well this is the first time at this location. ok  started at the bar. prompt fast service. when rest of party of four arrived we were seated quickly. unfortunately that where it went down hill from there. although food was good  they removed one item from menu  their great bbq beef sandwich. a favorite on one of our guest. one in the party had to send their order back because it was wrong. then when it came had to prompt the wait staff for ketchup for fries. then had to get up to hunt someone down for it and they cracked a joke after multiple mistakes already. another of the party ordered red wine with dinner. waiter showed up with a white wine. it was typical noisey bjs. come to live with that for typical great food and drinks  but if they do not get the wait staff up to par. will stay over to location at oakridge.
Mike W.,Santa Clara  CA,0,1,,1/15/2014,3.0,first I would like to say the food is great and I love BJ's Restaurant the servers are usually pretty good I go there a lotvsomething that I did not like at all is the manager Eric consistently flirts with his waitrpesses and servers laughing making jokes and worst of all put in his arms over their shoulders as they play around Eric this is not high school this is a work environment you are a manager and have a business to runwhen there are hungry guests waiting to be seated or waiting for the food you should be focused on them instead of pleasing your own needs by having fun with the young girls something needs to be done I hope by this review the managers will do the research and find a better manager to run a proper classy businesslast but not least I love the pizookie
