Vik S.,San Jose  CA,78,229,3,8/8/2017,4.0,Ribeye steak  asparagus  baked potato is my usual orderSteak is really good  better than Cheesecake Factory next door and 6 bucks cheaper heheGreat value and yummy food   what's not to like?
Quyen H.,San Jose  CA,626,201,620,12/3/2017,3.0,It's a great place for a glass of beer. There's a large selection to choose from! I was pretty impressed with it! There's also happy hour that makes everything so much better. I remembered ordering the burger here and I was surprised at how big the burger was! I was able to substitute my fries for a side of salad instead. The waiter had no problem with that at all. Back to the burger  it was so big! I had to use a knife to cut into two in order to even hold it! It was quite delicious though. There's some other menu items here that I want to try but I'm not sure which ones or where to start! Their menu reminds me of cheesecake factory where they have everything you can ever think of! Overall  it was just a good place for dinner and a drink with friends.
Jasmine P.,San Jose  CA,120,71,,11/21/2017,3.0,I wanted to take my sister and brother in law out with my kiddies. We waited and the host was awesome!! The server was pretty great as well but the food took a long time to come out. We were not going crazy about it because we were all in conversation and the kids were talking. So we were having a good time. But hen we realize that we were waiting for 45 min for our food. Then when the food came  some of the items (fries) were stale tasting. Then my sister had to wait a little longer for her plate while we all got ours. When her plate came the chicken was raw in the middle. The waitress we had was awesome  she came to us right when we raised our hand for her attention. She didn't run the other direction. Once she took back the plate a few seconds later her manager came and apologized. He took it off our ticket and got her a different choice for the night. When it came time to go and get the ticket  it was not updated and the manager came right over to fix it. We were okay with everything  it was not great but i liked how the manager and the waitress were very nice and tried to fix any oops they had!
Sophia T.,San Jose  CA,151,9,4,11/5/2017,1.0,We made reservations at 5:30PM. We waited for an hour  and our server was nowhere to be found. It's currently 6:30pm and I am fuming simply because we made this reservation and my mother has diabetes  so she has to eat on time. Thank you BJs for celebrating her birthday by not actually serving us and leading her to have a hypoglycemic attack in the middle of the restaurant. We ordered a soda  which came 40 minutes late. I am very  very upset  and me and my family will never come back again. This dang place almost costed my moms life  and I have never experienced a worse experience. I sincerely hope BJs fixes it's terrible service  because I will sue next time I step foot in here.We also had no apology for the wait  and the servers were blatantly rude and terrible to us and I'm still in shock as to how all the servers were irresponsible. This place is horrible. Horrible. I'd rather die than come back. Honestly. Not to mention the staff was extremely racist to my family  thinking that we could not comprehend the American language  and ignored all of our requests.Thank you once again  for the racist  horribly slow  and disrespectful service! I wouldn't even give this place a star  and I would give it a - 7 if possible.As for food  the brown rice is uncooked  cold  and very unappetizing. Everything is not even lukewarm because they didn't even have the decency to bring out food on time. (I also requested for this to be brought out as soon as possible seeing that my mother had very low blood sugar. This was brought out 30 minutes late. And we got cold food. Really.)
Ria A.,San Jose  CA,401,63,310,10/14/2017,3.0,This location is 1000 X better than the one on Coleman ave! If you prefer not to eat in a pitch dark restaurant  this location is it! We've always gone to the BJ's located on Coleman avenue and did not even realize this was close by! Every time we've gone to the Coleman location to watch a game  I've felt as if I were seconds away from falling asleep! The place is so dark and made me feel instantly sleepy! Maybe I'm just weird..Anyway  if you like light  go to the Blossom Hill location. This location also has a large parking structure next to it as it's right by the mall. Parking is never an issue and I love the out door seating area.As far as food and drinks go  it's typical bar/chain restaurant food. It's a great place to watch games and grab a quick bite.
Kathy N.,San Jose  CA,442,40,77,9/24/2017,1.0,WORST SERVICE EVER.My cousin and a friend booked a reservation here for a party of 16. The day or two before  they called again to confirm the reservation and add 1/2 people into the reservation. Well  BJ's said the reservation was never made?? The day after we called again and they said they still have our reservation?? Alright.OUR RESERVATION WAS 5-7PM. We ordered about 5:15. TELL ME WHY DID EVERYONE'S FOOD COME FROM NEARLY 6:40 - 7:40pm?? We waited OVER an hour for our food.We had creepy guys recording the girls  the staff kept saying the food is being made  and the food was suddenly being made AFTER our reservation ended.The food that came out for most people was not even hot. We all sat there incredibly hungry  waiting OVER an hour just for food.And quite honestly  bj's food was all show and not QUALITY. My friend's pizza dish made getting pizza a struggle. My vegan lentil soup was warm and looked like a dog took a dookie lmao. My other friend's salad was 1/4 of a cabbage + dressing LOL. Some people ate super early  some people ate super late. My poor cousin had to wait for over two hours for food.Staff apologized after over an hour and a half and said they are finally starting on my cousin's dish WHEN BEFORE they said they are currently cooking it. What?? We didn't get a discount  nothing. We finished eating and doing everything around 10pm at the restaurant. Unbelievable. Never coming back again.
Diane W.,San Jose  CA,41,354,276,11/15/2017,3.0,Large menu with plenty of options.  Food is what you would expect at a chain restaurant. My husband had the Enlightened Ahi Salad which he really enjoyed.  I had the Peruvian Quinoa Salad - just ok.  Service was efficient.
Alexys E.,Antioch  CA,78,333,325,9/9/2017,2.0,I mean y'all already know how these types of places go. It's a hit or miss.Weekend day with big families waiting for a table but if you're a table of 2 odds are you'll be taken quickly. This was the case of Scott and I.First table by the door.Anyone who knows me knows I hate when my appetizer comes with my entre.So what happens? Our calamari came with our split Parmesan crusted chicken entree at the same time.Not only did the calamari come with our entre  but it also came stone cold. Our waitress wasn't even the one to deliver our food.So  I'm left to believe the calamari was sitting at the window and she never gave it to us or the cooks just have cold calamari waiting to be served. Either way is unacceptable. Yet  the entree was hot.Pizookie was the saving grace.Oh BJ's  why you do dis?!
Emily L.,San Jose  CA,18,306,1050,10/13/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Why does this always happen to me!!!!!! I love this place but s**t keeps happening. The hh is great and the servers are friendly but omg. I came last week and there was a sticker in my food !!!! They only took it off the bill no sorry no nothing. They asked if I wanted another queso dip... no thank you. I lost my appetite after that.
Dave A.,Campbell  CA,1,46,72,7/31/2017,4.0,We came in on Friday at about 8 PM  the place was packed.We sat outside and had zero wait. Fantastic weather that day.*We noticed that the guy who sat us ... came back immediately and took our order  because our server was very busy. He answered our questions about the boneless chicken wings. He took our order ... then our server Sabrina came by and took the handoff. Great cust service.I had the mini pizza  BJ's fav  she had the boneless wings. Her wings were over cooked  very dark color and a little tough ... but my pizza was just right  very light and well balanced. A quick bite and it was off to see a movie.We've been to other locations (Marin County)  where the service was hit or miss ... but we liked it here in Oakridge Mall. We'll probably be back.
Nancy T.,Morrisville  NC,488,93,302,6/23/2017,4.0,I used to hate BJs but I have to eat my words because they've really stepped it up. I love the choices they have on their enlightened menu. The food doesn't taste like it's 500-800 calories and it's filling. Their fries are one of my faves. The staff at this location is so attentive and is always making sure you're doing okay. They also have daily specials and I believe Tuesday is $3 pizookies!!Download the app because you can put yourself on the waitlist and it'll help save time. They also have special offers and you can pay through the app and earn points!!
Amber V.,San Jose  CA,0,67,5,11/3/2017,1.0,"We checked in tonight  the idiot girl checking people in said ""it\'s a 20 minute wait""  we waited... and waited... and waited. I asked her  ""hey we\'ve been waiting for 40 minutes?""Looks at the list  ""Oh ya it\'ll be just a few more minutes"" So we waited... and waited again. Keep in mind everyone else is getting seated. I thought maybe these people were ahead of us and just walked around the mall  whatever.I got so upset  I asked the guy next to her and he was like ""hmmm... your name isn\'t on the list""Wow I was on fire at that point. I mean cmon you aren\'t curing cancer you\'re checking people in to be seated at a restaurant! Never going back... -5 stars. Done with this place."
Marlene B.,San Jose  CA,169,143,213,11/2/2017,3.0,Our server was great for late night happy hour in bar area. I was pleasantly surprised because other times I've been to this location haven't been so good. Late night happy from 10pm closing is great deal.
David N.,San Jose  CA,5,111,164,10/19/2017,3.0,I gave up on their generic bar food shortly after the place opened a few years ago  but heard they revamped the menu and wanted a decent draft beer while at the mall for lunch so gave it another shot. The Hop Storm IPA was the best part of the meal. I had the lunch special BACON-GUACAMOLE DELUXE BURGER  for which I'll review the elements:Bun: Very good lightly toasted brioche-style bun.Chipotle mayo: Far too little of it squirted on the underside of the top bun.Guacamole: About 1/3 of it was dark and rotten.Applewood smoked bacon: Didn't taste any smoke flavor and it wasn't thicker than regular bacon as it should have been. It was also old and not hot enough  clearly having been made long before the burger.Red onions  tomatoes and jalapeos: They were under the burger  but too mushy and sparse as compared with the menu photo.Pepper jack cheese: Didn't see or taste any pepper - it just looked like monterey jack. It was also cold and not melted onto the burger at all.Burger: Decently seasoned and cooked medium as I asked  but it's definitely low quality beef. Not sure how to accurately describe its texture and mouth feel but chewy  dense and slightly sinewy come to mind. Also clearly smaller than the one pictured on the menu.Fries: Okay-tasting and crispy but barely warm and about half the amount pictured on the menu.Overall not a bad deal for $10 but I think the kitchen has execution  temperature  and material quality issues to address.
Yoceline B.,San Jose  CA,0,2,5,9/10/2017,1.0,"Seriously   I ordered the pizookie trio as my ""birthday cake"" cause I don\'t like cake . And well imagine my joy when I opened up the containers and saw this Great job Bjs   one happy birthday girl over here"
Audrey M.,San Jose  CA,103,183,209,3/6/2017,3.0,This place is definitely a 3-star establishment. Always long waits to get seated  served on  and to get your mediocre food. Our service is usually friendly  but kitchen is always backed up it seems. There are some pros to this place though. They do have a great selection of cocktails and beers  and there is something for everybody on the menu. They have deep dish personal pizzas  which are actually pretty freaking amazing! I might be back just for these. Of course they have great desserts too...everybody loves a pizookie! The baked beignet is pretty delicious as well.Overall  it's a pretty good place to go to if you have large groups or are looking for someplace convenient to go to around Oakridge Mall.
Evan N.,Blossom Valley  San Jose  CA,0,3,2,11/7/2017,5.0,About a week ago I was picked up food from this restaurant and when I was walking back to my car I thought I left my keys in the restaurant but I left them in the car and only one employee went out to help me look for them and that great person was Max(I believe). He saw that my keys were in the car and he went back to grab some miscellaneous items to see if it will unlock my car  and it took some time but he unlocked my car and I just want to say that he went beyond what anyone would normally do  he stood out from everyone that day and I just want to say thank you.
Mac C.,San Jose  CA,6,67,62,10/12/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,The staff here just doesn't care about their customers. So many times we tried to flag down servers to help us out. Even spoke to people that weren't servers who were just laughing and speaking with each other not caring about their customers at all. Others were on their cell phones again not caring about their customers. And when we tried to get their attention it was as if we were disturbing them! Look you are here to do a job. If you don't like your job  don't do it! But don't male a family wait for 15-20 mins without acknowledging them! We waited so long for our waitress. She even left the check three times as she passed by not taking the check with the cash already on it! Three times! She forgot that she even left us a check the other two times and they aren't even that busy! The waitress couldn't even find change for us. She stated she was trying to find change. Really?!? Wait...you are a restaurant right? How do you make a customer wait for change of all things...Bj's have definitely reached an all time low! I remember when this place used to have great service and food. Now the people here do not care. MODIFIED: The incessant rude messages I was receiving from other employees and people commenting was slightly getting off point. So I modified this review to bring it back to its main focus. A servers job is difficult. I'll give you that. I myself used to work as a server at Pizza Hut when they used to host people. But customers sitting waiting to be served while ignored by staff for over 20 mins upon entry and at 15-30 mins during the the meal at different times I may add is unacceptable! Period. This is to all the employees here  if you are one of the few that do treat their customers with respect and attention then you are one of the lucky few...To the rest  if the people here don't enjoy their job and feel as if every time a customer asks for something that they are being disrupted  please go and find a job in a place that allows you not to be customer facing.
Denise L.,Santa Clara  CA,962,2283,3670,11/29/2016,3.0,2nd time dining here  and on a rainy Saturday  the service was beyond subpar.We were seated by the hostess  but the booth seats were dirty  and had to ask for it to be wiped down before seating. My friend and I went with the 2 for $25 deal which included 2 salads (the salad we chose - mozzarella and tomato  wasn't on the menu?)   a medium pizza and a pizookie. I ordered a soda  friend had a hot water.Our salads came and when we finished  we pushed our salad dishes to the side  but never got picked up. Our pizza came and I asked for a refill on our drinks and ranch  and 15 minutes later  still nothing. Finally flagged down our waiter and he brought it back when we were pretty much done with our meal.Salted caramel pizookie is missing the salty touch  but good regardless.Overall  the service here is the worst out of all the local BJ's  and would only come if it was my last choice.
Rupa S.,Malvern  PA,133,225,98,5/17/2017,5.0,Their Pizookies are absolutely amazing... If you have a sweet tooth like me and my friend - you will probably end up loving it as much as we did... specially their triple chocolate is just amazing... The food was kinda blah but the dessert is totally worth going to BJ's...
Benny H.,San Jose  CA,2005,1437,7836,11/6/2016,4.0,I also find it funny that the chain restaurants have an average of three stars. It's like a prerequisite. They have to have three stars average! However  I actually like this place. Staff can be a bit of dumb dumb's at the entrance  but the service is normally pretty good. The bar staff also needs to hurry up as there seems to always be a delay. However  they were able to make the grilled burger melt for me  which is no longer on the menu  which gives them a lot of bonus points. It's amazing! Also  they have one of the stronger Long Island ice tea's in the business of big restaurants. It's really good and strong. Makes you grow hair on your arms. Overall  I'm a BJ's fan and this place is no exception.
Aiden N.,Santa Clara  CA,5,1,,11/21/2017,1.0,This place makes you wait for hours!! It's absolutely sickening  especially when the food costs so much to begin with! I keep waiting and waiting and believe me  the food never came until an hour later. We waited longer for the dessert. Sickening!!
Marcia S.,San Jose  CA,48,31,22,7/10/2017,4.0,"Very impressed with BJ\'s today.1/2 off pizzas = every Monday!I ordered the TAVERN cut garlic pesto chicken ! Thin crust  roasted red peppers  artichoke hearts  whole ""fun"" size garlic cloves  yummmmyAnd my drink : Jerry\'s Berry Burst blend = berry cider and Jeremiah Red ale Good service  great food and drink  not too crowded"
Jennifer N.,San Jose  CA,228,146,42,4/20/2017,1.0,"New menu  new stuff.Didn\'t have their blackened chicken Cajun pasta but the kitchen was able to recreate it for it which was really good. I\'m pissed because I ordered their ""new"" nachos? (Not new btw)... it says it comes with: beans  lettuce  cheese  sour cream  pico de gallo  jalapeos and avocado all for $10.95. I\'ve ordered  from here previously and I raved about it.Ordered and this is literally what I got on my so called half-ass nachos. Chips  unmelted cheese  chopped tomatoes  olives and green onion and sprinkled on CilantroWHAT THE ?!?!? First off it wasn\'t even PICO DE GALLO. Secondly they\'re missin half of the ingredients and lastly there wasn\'t even mention on olives? Last time I\'m coming here. Manager also had the nerve to say oh avocado doesn\'t necessarily mean it\'s on it it\'s extra.. for your viewing pleasure I included the menu directly from their website and what I saw in person for you see that avocado isn\'t ""EXTRA"" it\'s included along with the other toppings that were missing."
Timothy N.,San Jose  CA,108,62,48,10/24/2016,4.0,If this was a dessert place with their pizookies I would give them 5*s for that alone. It was that good and I can't believe I haven't had a pizookie before. I'd come back just for that.Nonetheless  they are a restaurant and so there are other things to judge. This placed is packed on weekends and that really sucks but if going on a weekday most likely you'll be seated immediately which is nice. One really minor thing I saw and that I see noted in other reviews is that I felt like I was interrupting the front staff when we came in and I totally understand talking during down times as its normal in any job  but perhaps there can be a way to be both productive as well as socializing with co workers instead of just having a little circle with backs against the door. I don't remember our waitress' name unfortunately but she was really attentive to our needs and always checking up on us as well as being enthusiastic even though there weren't that many people in the restaurant yet which is always a plus as having superb people skills regardless of it being busy or not is important. For appetizers  Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts. Now let me say I dislike Brussel Sprouts normally and that summed up my first bite. I took a random one off the side and I didn't see any difference from a normal Brussel Sprout. Turns out the sauces on the bottom wasn't in the particular area that I took my Sprout from so I was missing out and just eating a plain Brussel Sprout. After noticing that  the Brussel Sprout in the actual Honey Sriracha sauce is actually pretty good without being too overwhelming or filling to prevent me from eating my entree.Now for entrees I mainly wasn't that impressed because I didn't really see anything special in my deep dish ziti. It was good no doubt about that and the garlic knot was an awesome add on as well but I wasn't just super into it. Overall desserts are bomb and pretty much the one reason I'd come back and makes this review a 4* versus 3* as I'd personally have it around 3.5 if I could.
Lilia G.,Petaluma  CA,103,20,22,11/18/2017,1.0,"10 minutes without anyone acknowledging a table is not acceptable specially when it\'s not busy. That\'s what happened to me and two friends this past Thursday. The manager sat us at a booth as soon as we asked for a table and said our server would be right with us...yeah  that didn\'t happen! Okay  I don\'t mind waiting a few minutes but to have no one come by to offer at least water or ask ""have you been helped"" after sitting for 10 mins is just not okay. Multiple employees passed by and no one cared to say a word. Not until we got up and were heading out. Manager then offer to take our orders right away but I was frustrated and annoyed by that point so I said  ""no  thank you"" and proceeded out the door."
Alexis R.,Oakland  CA,7,17,18,3/27/2017,4.0,I come here fairly often with my hubby for a pazookie. Most recently we came for dinner and most late Thursdays this place is pretty mellow but last Thursday this place was packed! We decided to sit at the bar since its open seating. Found a place really quick no issues. We went for their happy hour specials  I got a personal pizza and he got the burger which he had got before and was happy with. Food took a little longer than usual which was expected. My pizza was fine. Hubby's burger was a little over cooked and it didnt have any thousand island dressing on it. The fries were also cold and in short supply. We let our waitress stephanie know and she took care of everything she got a fresh plate of fries and grabbed the thousand island dressing. She was attentive the whole night and she was able to multitask perfectly. Thanks for the good service stephanie!
Ann N.,San Jose  CA,185,396,873,11/10/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,We were at the booth in the bar area. We didn't order entrees but overall  still very good. Service was attentive  they have ahi poke!!!  potstickers and pizza. All pretty good and came out pretty fast. If it's ur bday  mention it and a small dessert comes out just for you :).
Bert G.,San Diego  CA,82,608,444,2/10/2017,4.0,"Our party of four was in the mood for Happy Hour beers and snacks. BJ\'s hit the spot !Nobody had any problem with the beer discounts offered and the interesting HH menu. Our beers were delivered promptly  cold  and fresh. The food came after a short wait and was certainly as good as anticipated. The Honey Sriracha Sprouts ($6.50) were out of this world good. The mini pizzas and burgers were certainly up to specs for HH food.Oddly  we had three servers during our stay  which was about an hour or so. However  the receipt says ""Stephanie""  so thanks for the good service."
Marcella R.,San Jose  CA,21,22,11,9/28/2017,5.0,Their pizzas are so good. The place is always busy. I can't wait to try some other food. Great General Manager. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try.
Melanie S.,Seven Trees  San Jose  CA,174,115,251,4/15/2017,4.0,BJ's is always changing their menu. It is one of Amanda and my go to restaurant at oakridge. Whatever you are feeling or craving  they will most likely have or a version of it. All of the food is good here! I gave it a four out of five because sometimes the food does come a little greasier than I would like. Dessert can be totally the only reason you come to BJ's and I would be completely fine with it. If you have not had a pizookie  you are missing out on life. They are pizza size cookies with vanilla ice cream on top. They always come out warm and they have never steered me wrong  these pizookies come with different flavors so I do suggest the trio if you can share with someone. That way you can taste multiple flavors at once.
Celine L.,San Jose  CA,21,215,299,2/15/2017,2.0,Went here for Valentine's Day after dinner to get drinks. Very long wait unless you sit at the bar which is first come first serve. There's a huge selection of beers but the drinks here are not always consistent. My strawberry mojito barely had any rum in it so I don't feel like it was worth the price. We also ordered the Pazookie trio and we picked the white chocolate macadamia nut  chocolate chip  and salted caramel cookie. All topped with vanilla ice cream. It was enough for 4 people to eat. However  One of our cookies was pretty burnt and we could taste the charred cookie even with ice cream and caramel all over it. The service was subpar and the hostess seemed to be in a hurry to get us out although my friend still wanted another drink.... Probably will only come here for Pazookie.
Jay A.,San Jose  CA,3,114,10,10/20/2017,4.0,BJ's is consistently good no matter where you go. The only issue I ever have with this place is the noise. They blast music 24/7 which makes it very hard to hear anyone with whom you might be dining. Too bad.
Sanjose K.,San Jose  CA,5,169,7,6/15/2017,2.0,Ugh- every time we go here I keep hoping it will be a better experience  and it just ISNT!!!!!! We were sat outside  but apparently this is where all employees also take their break  even if customer are dining. On their break  they talk loudly  watch YouTube videos loudly  laugh at the videos loudly  and swear. I really dont care how anyone spends their break- it's their BREAK!- but when its literally at the table next to us when we're on our first date in 6 months  it is awful. The service was slow  despite not being very full  and it took forever to get checked on after we got our food. The Brussels sprouts were rock hard and very under cooked. The rib eye was good  nd the sweet potato fries were average. Overall it was a disappointing experience for the cost.
Jess R.,San Jose  CA,3,18,1,10/15/2017,5.0,I have been coming to this BJs for years. Food is consistently good  service is usually pretty quick  and the pizookies are always delicious. My boyfriend and I decided to have a rare date night tonight and wanted to share about the great service we received! We were both tired and hungry after a long day and John  our server  totally changed our mood around. He was attentive  made us laugh  and made our night! Will definitely ask for him next time we come in!
Paige B.,San Jose  CA,39,223,47,10/22/2016,1.0,"One star for wait list service  not necessarily food. We recently signed up for an on line account with BJ\'s and took advantage of their ""wait list sign in"". It informed us that there was a 45"" wait. We arrived at 3 minutes prior to that wait time expiring  having put my name in at 2000  we arrived at 2042. I informed the host of our name and he said he had us ""checked in"". I asked how long we might now expect to wait  and he said it would be 30 minutes! He then proceeded to show me his wait list screen and told me there ""were lots of people ahead"" of me. On the list  there is a phone icon next to names that have made online wait list requests. There were none of these ahead of our name. Only walk ins. What a horrible on line system. To be fair  the online system does state there will be a wait time as you arrive  so I expected a 15""  or even 20""  being Friday night  extension. I fail to see the point of having an online system at all however  if my walk in time will be the same as my online wait list time and time estimate given. Utter customer service failure before I\'ve even engaged your restaurant.Your location lost business from us for sure and I warn all guests against using the system or becoming an online member of BJ\'s. On that point  please see the photo if our receipt from the brand new Japanese restaurant next door to you in the mall and subtract this from your evening revenue."
Yennie L.,San Jose  CA,106,333,137,6/1/2017,3.0,Not a usual here but my friend had her birthday celebrated here. We had a party of 10+ got an outdoor private seating area.they have a lot of selections here..
Alex B.,Oyster Point  CA,47,24,,5/12/2017,2.0,I used to love BJ's. As far as beer goes  it's hard to find a restaurant with such a fine house selection. If this place was just a bar  I'd have to give it 4-5 stars. Unfortunately  food and service are major factors and the service at BJ's suffers more and more as the place crowds. The servers don't particularly seem to care how well your experience goes  but of course  there are shining exceptions. The food is decent for the most part  with some sad dishes. I've eaten at BJ's at least forty times  and I notice their appetizer portions are shrinking while the prices go up. I used to enjoy the lettuce wraps with Chinese mustard  but they don't give enough filling to fill the wraps anymore. The avocado rolls come in smaller portions; they used to be much more substantial. I do recommend the chicken wings and the flatbread pizzas.While appetizers seem to get progressively smaller  contrarily  entrees remain gargantuan. Nobody complains about getting too much  but prices can be lowered with reasonable portioning. An entree should be just enough to fill a stomach and not require the aid of a second. There's something about enjoying a dish and not being stuffed silly that makes it more memorable.Go to BJ's for exceptional beer and high-end bar food  but always keep in mind: it'll cost more than it's truly worth.
Scott P.,San Jose  CA,59,176,15,8/18/2017,3.0,My wife and I came here for a date. for a Tuesday night and not being crowded  they were kinda slow. the waitress really took her time to get to us. We finally ordered. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and my wife ordered the fried chicken sandwich. I would say that it arrived on time. However they did not give my wife the correct item. They gave her some sort of burger. The waitress never came back to check on us. The burger was good but not what she was wanted. When the waitress finally returned  she informed us she going on break and handed us off to her substitute. He was much better. he was attentive and informative. He came back to check on us. We were disappointed with the first waitress  but the second waiter (perhaps by comparison) was awesome.
Sergio M.,San Francisco  CA,0,10,1,5/12/2017,1.0,Service was ok.Location is good.Ambience was as expected.Food was sub-par.They shouldn't show photos of the food if they aren't going to bring you whar they show in the menu. Steak was inedible and tiny.
Michelle N.,San Jose  CA,81,55,16,5/7/2017,5.0,My boyfriend and I have been coming to this location for 3 years (regulars) and have had okay service. The food is delicious & we've never had a complaint about that. Our service however has always been lacking. Either the waiter takes too long to bring our drinks or to ask if we need anything else. Tonight however  we were delighted to have been served by Corina at the bar. She was attentive  smiling  and in such a positive mood that it really contributed to our overall experience. Next time we sit at the bar at BJs  we'll definitely make sure we're sitting in her section!
Jim J.,San Jose  CA,66,18,,4/27/2017,1.0,So my wife and I decide to have lunch and watch the Giants game today. When we arrive  no Giants pre-game. Instead  there's an East coast baseball game  soccer  and tennis on all the tv's. So I ask our waitress if it would be possible to actually watch a Bay Area team  the Giants. She said she would check. 15 minutes later they finally put on the game  on 1 damn tv. I'm trying to understand the logic of BJ's. We are living in the Bay Area. We like to watch our local teams  especially when they are playing their rival Dodgers. So we get one screen  and the funny part is watching customers straining their necks to try and watch the game. Someone needs to knock some sense on their management. This is the last time I will be patronizing BJ's. and it's too bad because the beer and food is pretty good. Come on  get your head out of your rear orifice and actually cater to the locals.
Shu T.,San Jose  CA,201,326,,5/5/2017,3.0,I came here because they were giving out free beer for teachers for Teachers Appreciation Week. We also ordered calamari and a rack of ribs. There was a special on rack of ribs for $20. There is plenty of seating in the bar area  so I would suggest sitting there because there is a wait for the non bar area. I found the calamari pretty tender and the tartar sauce was yummy. I don't normally like tartar sauce. The rack of ribs was super dry  although adding more BBQ sauce made it taste better. It came with two sides  brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. The brussel sprouts were overdone and not crunchy. The mashed potatoes were creamy though. The service was good  and I probably wouldn't recommend this place for the food. However  it is a great place to watch games and grab a drink with friends.
Asal F.,San Jose  CA,12,4,46,12/11/2016,5.0,Came here with my friend after a hard day  but ended up leaving happy and content! A few slices of pizza and a few margaritas later ... life is good again! Lol Our server Biagio made the biggest difference though... he actually cared and was very attentive to us! He recommended great choices for foods and drinks based on our likes and even comforted us with a hug (per our request)!He was sincere  sweet  and accommodating  a server who became a friend. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening and the food/ drinks  and went home completely relaxed! He would do great in a leadership position with his calm and kind vibe! Would definitely come back again as we love the vibe of this place. Highly recommend it !
Josie L.,San Jose  CA,0,3,,4/6/2017,4.0,Service here is great! I'm only putting 4 stars because the Bloody Mary I ordered was VERY strong  I didn't taste anything but pure alcohol and couldn't really drink it.Other than that  I ordered a burger and it was super tasty and my waiter was so cute and helpful when I asked questions on the menu. I love their calamari also. Waiters and waitresses seemed very professional. Will return but maybe try a glass of wine next time.
Alpha S.,San Jose  CA,2,42,33,9/26/2016,5.0,The five of us walked in around 6pm and got seated right away. Cesar (I hope I spelled his name right)  came by and got our drink order.The service was quick and friendly. The food was good  and arrived fast. Cesar checked on us frequently. I had the seared ahi salad for dinner  and it was great.We had a bunch of weird requests  and they accommodated us.Over all  the experience was a solid 4  but Cesar pushed it up to five stars.
Kacie C.,San Jose  CA,57,40,227,3/5/2016,4.0,When ordering the steaks  ask for it to be cooked below your usual preference. My boyfriend ordered the top sirloin steak medium well although his steak came out extra well done  making the steak pretty dry. I chose the shrimp and asparagus penne which was pretty good  nothing to complain about and I loved the knot roll that came along with it.We also got the pizookie trio which was our (and I think everyone else's) favorite! We chose the new money bread flavor  cookies and cream  and double chocolate..all three were amazing!I've heard many people had bad experiences when coming to BJs but we received great service that night from our server  Patrick! This place is great for a late night dinner  but any place open this late you really can't expect a five star meal.
Mariah G.,Gilroy  CA,13,3,1,8/24/2017,1.0,The service sucks here. Our waiter was constantly preoccupied with a table that he was obviously friends with. We were waiting on him for everything instead of him being attentive to our needs as customers. The foods not that great to be ignored until we went above and beyond to get his attention.
Marcelo I.,San Jose  CA,20,63,47,1/8/2017,4.0,Look  I know it is not super cool  but the deep dish pizza here is delicious. If you are driving to the mall to see a movie  just eat here. Sure you could drive somewhere hipper first before you go the mall to see the movie  but why? It's right here. It has pizza  it has wings. It has great Brussel sprouts. Just make life easier and get over yourself.
Brian C.,Santa Cruz  CA,49,59,24,1/27/2017,2.0,I've been to another BJs before with a pretty positive experience. My wife and I came in to watch the Raider game  have a drink and a burger.Well  two burgers and two drinks later  we were welcomed with a $50 tab.Theres nothing about this place that is worth $25 per person for lunch.
Daniel N.,South San Jose  San Jose  CA,79,6,1,6/15/2017,5.0,So I git the steak with two sides of mash. It was good and pretty cheap  around $24 for my meal alone  And excellent customer service
Theresa M.,San Jose  CA,136,117,92,7/25/2017,5.0,It's been sometime since I've been to BJ's but the last two times in a month has been extraordinary! I'm in love with their PM Porter and Bourdon Stout. I wish they sold them outside the restaurant  and yes I've asked. Foods wonderful too. They've added so much since the last time I've been there and he healthy alternatives are delicious.
Kay L.,San Jose  CA,136,19,1,2/16/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,The server had forgotten to add our appetizers in our order  so those never showed up. Our main course took forever and my Fish and chips were not good. I ended up substituting the fries with onion strings  it it was just a big soggy mess. The bill took forever. The silver wear took forever. Even water took forever. Everything just takes forever here. I ended up not eating at all and my BF was so pissed he didn't tip.UPDATE: at the bottom of my review you can clearly see that someone from the company told me to contact them. I contacted her through email  got a response  emailed back  and still no resolution. Thanks for nothing. I still haven't been back since!
Kait P.,San Jose  CA,86,167,96,9/9/2016,4.0,I always love coming to BJ's because their food is AMAZING. Every time I go it's always on a weekend so it'll be busy - wait times are usually 30 minutes to an hour but if you want to sit in the bar it's open seating so I'd rather do that! All the waiters are super nice and very attentive to your wait time and what you need during your visit. The restaurant is kept very clean - I've never had any complaints about sticky tables  food on the ground  etc. like at other places.The food is always super good. I love coming here for their burgers and fries - if I have a craving this is the place to go! The pulled pork sandwich is very good and you know you'll always have to get their pazookies! They also have a deal where you if you eat at their restaurant  you can get discounted movie tickets. It's a win-win!Definitely returning
Monika H.,San Jose  CA,420,102,172,6/10/2016,4.0,"We stopped at this BJ\'s restaurant to watch the Warriors-Cavaliers play Game 4 of the NBA Finals and to sip some beers. The game was shown on the big screen TV near the bar  and we lucked out on getting some seats (eventually) at the bar.The crowd definitely was in to the game  which made it fun  and the beers were good. I had a peach ale (the name of which I cannot remember) and my guy had a ginger IPA (""Devil\'s Brew""?). We also split a jalepeno burger (substituted with a turkey patty) and steak fries.The kitchen apparently was REALLY busy. So  the fries came out separately from the burger  but it was fine.Overall  we enjoyed ourselves tremendously  particularly because the Warriors won!GO  GOLDEN STATE!"
Alex K.,San Francisco  CA,9,23,1,8/8/2017,1.0,This BJs is the slowest and disgusting ones in the area. I had a party of 5  which the host said would be 45 mins - 1 hr wait. Not only did an hour past  but they also forgot about our party in general. The quality of food is garbage and the service was beyond pathetic. I understand I shouldn't have high hopes for a restaurant at a mall  but holy balls this place sucks! Our table decided to pay up front because we didn't want to tip the waitress for how rudely and lazy she was during the night. Keep in mind that it wasn't a busy night. There was hardly anyone dining that evening. Straight up trash.
Crystal O.,San Jose  CA,8,3,2,10/4/2016,5.0,Always love coming to Bjs! The pazookies are absolutely delicious and an all time classic. And of course you can't come to Bjs without ordering one of their famous brews (if you're of age of course). Our server Biagio L. Was awesome  he was super attentive and made great recommendations. One thing I would complain about would be the patio being kind of chilly  but they did have heaters so it kind of balanced out. Overall great experience  I'll definitely be coming back!
Tiffanie A.,Los Gatos  CA,84,193,265,8/2/2016,3.0,This place is ok. My first 2 experiences that happened 3-7 years ago were really bad. Between me getting sick from their food one time  to all dirty dishes and a long ass hair in our dip the other time. BJs was a solid zero stars for me. It's up to a 3 because we went the other day (only because my husband got a gift card there from someone). I was dreading it but it ended up being fine. I didn't get sick  we didn't find any hairs  dishes/silverware/glasses were clean  service improved  and food was edible. Is this the best place ever? No. But If we ever get a gift card here again  I won't be afraid to go anymore lol
nicole c.,San Jose  CA,104,39,,6/17/2017,5.0,Cesar was amazing!!! We have come here quite often but the service we received from Cesar made me want to leave a review! Cesar was on top of everything  drinks  food and just plain awesome!! Thank you Cesar for a great experience!!!
Samson W.,Milpitas  CA,35,636,280,12/27/2015,3.0,My first time eating at the Oakridge Mall location. The only reason why I chose B.J.'s is because I did not have a good experience at Buca Di Beppo. Also  Cheesecake Factory was a little packed.I ordered the breakfast pizza. Pretty good with eggs and bacon.I also had to have coffee as it is a very cold day. Too cold for late December here in the Silicon Valley. Good coffee. Yes  not kidding.The service is the only thing that is a hit or miss. The waitress provides good service one minute and not so good the next minute. Took a little too long to bring me a refill on coffee.I would not mind coming again or visiting their other location. Other than their Cupertino location  which is not a good location at all as it is on the Apple main campus.
Cindy C.,San Mateo  CA,409,450,3389,11/22/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,It feels as though I'll never have a good experience at this place...Came in around 8pm on a Friday night and was told there was going to be 1+ hour wait. I liked that they took down our number and would text us when our table was ready. An hour passed though... no text message. We came back  asked  and was told there was just one couple ahead of us.Finally got seated. For the first time we got a server who was friendly and very attentive. Our drink orders were taken immediately. Hefeweizen for the boyfriend and orange cream soda for myself (with refills). I highly suggest it! Next time I want to try their new soda cocktails.Ordered the calamari (had to give it a second chance) for an appetizer. Again it was a disappointment being drenched in SO much oil. If you don't mind oil dripping off your fingers and face - I guess it was a decent dish. I  however  did NOT think so. Boyfriend got the brisket bacon burger (I know  I know - heart attack in between buns). Came with choice of fries or potato wedges. I'm surprised they didn't offer a cold slaw side dish. Burger was good. The brisket was absolutely delicious.Apparently the kitchen misread the ticket and gave away my jumbo spaghetti and meatballs to someone at the bar  while I got a shrimp pasta... Sent it back of course. Took another 15 minutes before I got my meal and by then my boyfriend had long finished his. The meatballs were definitely jumbo and I did enjoy them. But the sauce was too runny and the worse part was how extremely spicy it was!!! After a few bites I just couldn't take it anymore and it became inedible. Taking a closer look I realized there were handfuls of dried pepper flakes. I don't remember it saying anything about being spicy in the description of this dish...Highlight of this meal was our server who constantly came to check in on us and refill our drinks.Too done with the meal to even go for dessert sadly...
Jade S.,San Jose  CA,3,12,,3/13/2017,3.0,Came here on a Friday night to eat before our movie at Oakridge theaters. My boyfriend and I were starving and were really just trying to find the place with the fastest wait time. We walked in and the host said 45 minutes for a table. We were about to try PF Changs when another hostess said a booth in the bar had just opened up. Awesome  thank you miss lady!We ordered -Hopstrom IPA-their double IPA  don't remember the name-Bone in chicken wings-New Orleans Jambalaya -Spicy peanut chicken with Soba noodles Beer was great! We both enjoyed. Chicken wings were amazing! Super crunchy and spicy. Huge sizes of drum and wings too. Our entrees were just blah. I have been to BJs once before and I remember my food being blah too. Service was amazing though. I didn't catch our waitresses name but she was working the bar and had great eyebrows! :P. She was on top of everything. Food came out hot  she checked on us regularly and when my boyfriend said we had to catch a movie she brought the check out right away. We figure if we ever come back we will just get chicken wings and drinks.
Kaylee S.,San Jose  CA,1,56,3,8/13/2017,1.0,This place has gone so far downhill. It isn't even enjoyable anymore. The food is blah and the customer service is way worse. I wouldn't recommend this play to anyone anymore. The only good thing about this place is their pizookies.
Bryan D.,Santa Cruz  CA,55,1,,8/20/2017,5.0,Great Location. Took the family out for a pre-college celebration and ended up with a hilarious and quick server. Kadie made our dinner a great experience and kept us entertained with jokes and great food. Haven't found a better BJs since  definitely will come back for more great times
Paul W.,Mountain View  CA,13,166,,12/12/2016,5.0,"My particular experience here deserves five stars  though to be fair  I didn\'t come in during a typically busy time  but on a Saturday at 11AM pretty much as soon as the place opened (though when we left an hour later  there was a considerable wait list).That said  they did an absolutely superb job both on food and service. I asked if they could make their jambalaya without onions  and they did  while also making sure to take a backup order from me in case what I asked for could not be done. The jambalaya...absolutely great. Plenty of proteins in it  with the right amount of heat and flavor. And so much of it that I couldn\'t finish it all. I don\'t usually take leftovers home  because most of the time I eat up all the ""good bits"" at the restaurant  or else it\'s just not quite a good enough meal I wish to repeat. But I made an exception in this case...it was that good  and still had a lot of meat left in it after I\'d eaten my fill  that I wanted to take the rest home...and actually was looking forward to eating the rest the next day. And it was just as good. They did a great job on the service as well  checking on us repeatedly to make sure our drinks stayed filled...important for the jambalaya dish because of the heat.I\'ll be coming back here very soon to eat the great dish again  and am eager to try the other stuff as well."
Natalie N.,San Jose  CA,553,8,8,11/11/2016,5.0,My experience here actually has gotten a lot better than the times I've gone before! Called in to add my name to the waitlist  and they were actually able to! AUTOMATIC STAR. When we walked in they said our name wasn't on the list. Luckily  my boyfriend remembered the hosts name who picked up so we got sat right away. Thank god. We ordered the spinach dip  buffalo chicken ranch pizza and the buffalo/root beer glazed wings. The root beer glaze actually does taste like root beer. Very unique and def should try. Nothing was wrong with any of the dishes! The service from Cesar  I believe  was attentive. Of course we had to finish off with the delicious pizookie!
Sony S.,San Jose  CA,7,7,13,6/1/2017,3.0,I ordered a salad today and it tasted so bad... like it might have been expired. 3 stars because I've been here before and it was pretty good the last times.
Julia H.,San Jose  CA,85,148,327,1/27/2017,3.0,I wasn't sure if I should give this place three or four stars. If it were based on the ribeye alone then I would say four  but I want to factor in the service and other foods. The ribeye was excellent. The sandwich we ordered was not that great and it didn't look very appetizing either. The service could have been better. We had to wave down someone to help us. I really don't like having to try too hard to be noticed when I sit down at a restaurant. Nothing else really stands out about this restaurant. I really only like coming here to socialize with my friends.
Jennifer P.,San Jose  CA,21,53,,7/17/2017,4.0,We used to come here weekly for date night. We moved away but decided to go back last week. We were pleasantly surprised to see some of the same faces. They changed the way food goes out and gave their waiters computers so they didn't not have to walk back and wait to put in the order. The food came out really fast. Great experience for not being able to go for a few months.
Thu V.,San Jose  CA,269,15,12,7/18/2017,5.0,Food was really good and the waiters were really attentive. My friends love the deep dish pizza  and I love the burger. Place is clean. I don't know why this place is only 3 star average  bc it deserves a lot more.
Candice T.,San Jose  CA,202,180,984,11/4/2015,3.0,I've been to BJ's many times before and this is one of my go to restaurants. I enjoy coming here not only for the food but also their beers. I've listed a few items that I've had in the past. So far everything was good except for what I had just recently. I ordered the *NEW North Beach Mahi & Shrimp. I must say I didn't quite enjoy this meal because there's so much going on with regards to the herbs and spices they put. First of all  I HATE capers and if only I knew then I would have asked them to not put any. The capers  kalamata olives  fennel and anise seeds overpowers the mahi and the shrimp. Sadly  I did not enjoy my meal! I just won't order it again!Appetizers: (recommend)Spinach and artichoke dipCrispy calamariCrisp potato skins platterCalifornia club flatbread pizza (good)My usuals in terms of entres:Balsamic glazed chickenGrilled Pork ChopsBJ's handcrafted beers and cider:Tatonka StoutBerry Burst cider
J B.,Morgan Hill  CA,12,392,33,7/3/2017,4.0,The pizza was still good and the server named darryl a tall young colored cool guy was an outstanding waiter. The owner should give this guy a raise in pay and let him teach others how to serve.
Brianna S.,San Jose  CA,2,21,5,5/27/2017,5.0,Jaime was amazing! Super friendly and patient. He even walked my grandmother to the door. She usually always has a complaint but not this time. Thanks Jaime !!
Janice C.,Sacramento  CA,1,48,3,7/27/2017,4.0,Not bad. So  not all of the food turned out the way we liked. Appetizer came out after our main course and was cold. Churro pizookie had absolutely NO cinnamon and sugar on the churros. Our water was only refilled once. The waitress comped our appetizer and took our pizookie back to sprinkle it with cinnamon and sugar. She also honored our coupon without looking at it. So  at least the service was great.
Destinie Z.,San Jose  CA,403,539,499,5/19/2016,4.0,I've had many birthday dinners/lunches/happy hours here at this BJ's and never had a bad experience. Staff is always friendly and goes out of their way to assist. Pizza and burgers are good here as well as the thin cut fries. Spicy spaghetti was my former favorite item  but they changed the recipe and I don't care for it much anymore.I really do wish I remembered the name of our last server because he was amazing! Our bill came out to $30 for two vodka drinks and sandwiches and we tipped him $20 because he was an absolute rockstar when it came to service.
Steve P.,San Jose  CA,0,1,,10/3/2017,1.0,I was pleased to get seated right away at 5:30pm on a week night. Unfortunately everything took a long time to get after ordering. When we finally received the food  the french fries were cold and the salads tasted like they were prepared hours earlier. After waiting for desert for 30 minutes the waitress informed us that the waiter had accidentally dropped it on the floor and asked if we wanted to wait longer for a replacement......Won't be back for a while.
Justin B.,Palo Alto  CA,18,8,10,5/24/2017,1.0,Long time customer of BJ's Restaurants in Northern California. Beer selection is wide and their own beers are very high in quality. My most recent few visits to this location have been satisfactory but  I had stared to notice that the bartenders here give preferential treatment to customers from what I overhear are employees at several surrounding restaurants. P.F. Changs  Bucca Di Beppo to name a few. Well It seems that my needs fall on the back end of those work nearby. I watched several bartenders (both Caucasian looking males) interact with said customers by giving out shooters and beers to them  while every time I asked for another beverage my receipt was immediately updated but it seemed that the local employees were getting freebee after freebee. Which to me doesn't look great when I feel that I spend enough money there not to be included in this generosity. Regardless the interaction with my bartender (Randy C.) was minimal and felt disingenuous. In short I didn't enjoy watching this happen and will recommend others avoid the bar top unless they work in the same field in the surrounding area. Maybe then free-bees will come their way too.
Lacey C.,Santa Clara  CA,10,12,9,2/6/2017,4.0,Me and my hubby often go here for dessert. We like to keep it simple and stick to a chocolate chip pazzokie. 90% of the time they come out perfect. Nice warm and gooey and not burned. We usually get in and out within 20 mins and service is always good. He grabbed a burger during happy hour the last time he went and he said he like it. The burger was juicey and a good size for only $6. The fries were also good  hot and crispy  I stole a few and they got my approval. We have gone to other BJs and we like their pizzas too  you can't go wrong really.
Leah C.,Martinez  CA,23,23,,3/29/2017,5.0,Had the best service from our server Cesar this evening. He was prompt  kind  and did a fantastic job anticipating our needs! Also  it was free pizzookie night and we didn't even know it until we ordered our DELICIOUS desserts! Bonus!
Daywa H.,South San Jose  San Jose  CA,2,8,1,2/21/2017,5.0,I come to BJ's often  it's a nice restaurant to go to to grab a bite with your friends or family. But  this review is solely for Mark. As many times as I've been here  and the customer service has been alright. It's never been exceptional like it has been with Marcus. Not only did he make sure or table was taken care of by checking in with us often  but he also related to us and made us feel comfortable. Knowing the menu pretty well  made it easy to order. But Mark also offered suggestions to try new things. Which we all loved! Anytime I comeInto BJ's I will ask to be taken care of by Marcus! I hope management acknowledges Marcus's great work ethic! He has made a remarkable impact on my experience.
Kalen K.,San Jose  CA,128,279,14,10/13/2016,3.0,Yelp says I have checked in here 14 times. That is probably a low ball number compared to the actual number of times I have been here. This is sort of our default Saturday after the kids soccer lunch stop because it is close  reasonably priced  the kids actually will eat the food  and they have beer. What I HATE about this place is the service can be horrible at times. It can be totally dead  and it can take 10-15 minutes to get our first drink order. 40 minutes from food order to table. Wrong items  etc. The people are always nice  but their process and execution is mostly miss. Consistently. And it is one of those frustrating places where you see 5 workers standing around bs'ing. Granted  they are probably busers or hostesses  but text book example of a poorly managed restaurant. Some of the food is actually pretty decent. Kids love the mac-n-cheese  the pizza  the ribs  the pazooki. I like the ahi tuna salad and their pizzas are pretty good. I am not a big beer fan in general  but I like several of their brews.
Tammy L.,San Jose  CA,57,20,35,5/1/2016,3.0,"It sucks that you can\'t make reservations unless it\'s a party of 8 or more. When I called over the phone  the worker told me that I was put on the list  however when I went to check in  he told me it was another 40 minutes. Their texting system is pretty helpful and accurate. 40 minutes later  we were seated.We started off with calamari and when it arrived  it was such a let down!!!!! It was drowned in oil and abnormally soft  and chewy. We also ordered the traditional wings  because our waitress  Brittney  recommended it as her favorite. Their traditional wings came with celery and with both ranch and/or mild or super spicy sauce. You can pick either one. The mild sauce had an abnormally strong smell  but it tasted great!!!For the main meal  I ordered the Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger with a side of seasoned potato wedges (you can pick between this or crispy fries) and my girlfriend ordered the deep dish ziti. Honestly  the side of seasoned potato wedges didn\'t taste ""seasoned"". There was really no difference between the potato wedges and crispy fries. Overall  I really enjoyed my burger - mainly the BBQ sauce!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU DONT MIND 1200 CALORIES. When I tried the deep dish ziti  it tasted like a pizza in pasta form. It\'s actually new to the menu  and well worth the price  if you\'re looking for something really cheesy.After the group finished all our meals  we ordered the monkey bread pizookie and salted caramel pizookie - the waitress put both of them on the house because it was my friend\'s birthday. The pizookies are definitely why people come here.After our meal  the waitress brought us our meal  and though they didn\'t incorporate tip into the price  their receipt does show the calculated 10% and 15% tip wages. No pressure  I guess. Would definitely come back  but the waiting staff seemed to be in a rush constantly."
Jenny H.,San Francisco  CA,529,127,121,9/17/2015,4.0,This is a pretty solid restaurant for a girls night out or even for a date. The burgers are huge and can fill you up so fast  but they're so delicious. My favorite is the Portobello Swiss burger! Also  get the potato wedges whenever you get the chance. They're incredible. I absolutely love the atmosphere here. I usually don't like places that have dark lighting  so this place is spot on for me! I can actually see my food and my pictures out nicer as well. :) The wait can get super long. I recommend calling in or getting a reservation beforehand. We had to wait for about an hour.. And on top of that  the our food took forever.
Jackie G.,San Jose  CA,12,35,3,3/19/2017,5.0,Besides this place always being packed its great. I have been to this one and the one in Newark and out of the two this is the better one. I live near Oakridge so i come often and have awesome food. When I go to Newark their management sucks so bad. In fact my coworkers have gone into screaming matches with the managers there. Unfortunate since our agency holds so many luncheons here!
Cindy L.,Sacramento  CA,45,5,,4/16/2017,5.0,I love servers that go above and beyond and are all about 100% customer service. That's exactly how every restaurant or retail store should be. I love being treated with so much kindness and I absolutely loved that our server didn't just take our orders  but he tried to get to know us as individuals. Sean was the best server I've had so far.
Dan M.,Milpitas  CA,1,4,,3/22/2017,5.0,Best service I've ever had at BJs. Our server  Katie  was definitely the best I've had here! If you ever go I would recommend her as your server! Would come back next time and ask for her!
Tina L.,San Jose  CA,4,59,25,10/2/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,I hate the long wait but it's always yummy. The buffalo wings are too salty for me but everything else is pretty good still. I love their pastas as well and my boyfriend got the steak so we got clam chowder with it. It was a little too salty for me as well. Overall I'd come here again because of the nice staff and the ambience. Hopefully my food isn't too salty next time!
Dalena D.,San Jose  CA,1,6,,4/2/2017,5.0,Mine and boyfriend's go-to dinner place. The food always comes out quick and the servers are always friendly. When I need something & I don't see my server  someone will gladly help out or get them for us. I always order between their Atlantic salmon (LOVE THEIR RICE PILAF)   chicken alfredo & of course their build your own pizzas. Also  a great place to bring your kid as well. It's not too quiet where you're worried that people will notice your child and it's not too loud that would startle or arouse them. I love this location especially. Plus  it's at the mall so you can roam around when you're waiting for a table.
Philip M.,San Jose  CA,12,141,67,10/6/2016,5.0,Celebrated my bday dinner tonight with a party of 8. Decided on BJ's because I've seen so many posts in the past with pizookies that I had to try one for myself. The food and pizookies did not disappoint! Had the black & blue cheese burger and really liked it along with the crispy fries. 5 stars for food & service. Biagio was our server and he was super attentive  friendly and our whole party enjoyed his great service.
Nique A.,San Jose  CA,6,48,2,1/16/2016,1.0,"I had BJ\'s via delivery from the Door Dash app because just a week prior  I attempted to order via Eat 24/Yelp Delivery  and I received a call from them nearly 30 mins later stating that they were shutting down early due to ""1 hour+ wait times"". I ordered the Honey Sriracha Brussel Sprouts  BJs Brewhouse Burger w/ a turkey pattie instead of beef & thin fries for myself  and a Bacon Cheeseburger (medium well) & thin fries for husband. All items were a disappointment. The driver took the initiative to call and let me know he was still waiting almost an hour after I placed the order  so when the food arrived it was lukewarm (not the driver\'s fault). My turkey burger was clearly a processed/frozen frisbee pattie with no flavor as opposed to fresh ground turkey meat  and appeared just literally thrown together. My husband\'s beef burger was dry and cooked well done despite ordering medium. The brussel sprouts were the biggest disappoint  as I was looking forward to them since having them once before. The brussel sprouts were burnt black and completely inedible (see pic). Like  why would they even plate those?!I can\'t say I\'d never come here again because they have great beer  and decent food as far as dining in. However  I\'d definitely NEVER do take out or delivery again because they clearly take it for granted and skimp because they know you can\'t send it back."
Sean M.,Dublin  CA,432,468,552,1/10/2016,2.0,"I have to say that a 2 star could be considered generous given the experiences I\'ve had here. I will give 2 stars because the menu is decent (and relatively veg friendly) plus the beer options are good. Aside from that the service is mediocre at best. Quite typically the service is totally and completely sub par. You have to wait endlessly to get a table quite often. The bar is terribly crowded regularly. The ambiance is douche bag ""bro"". Overall  I\'ll take my money elsewhere."
Jessica R.,San Francisco  CA,70,21,4,1/30/2017,5.0,We have been to this Bjs on several occasions recently and always had a lack lustered  unfriendly dining experience. But since we were shopping in the mall we were hungry for pizza and some beers. We agreed to give Bjs one last chance. We sat at the bar on a semi busy night and were greeted right away by Erik the bartender. he was personable  professional  and engaged in us as customers. Gave us great happy hour suggestions and answered several questions we had about pizza toppings. This employee has single handedly restored our impression of the Bjs brand and will specifically only sit at this locations bar to enjoy his service again. Yelp is mostly for complainers and trash talkers clearly but I felt it important to give credit where it is due. Hope to see him here again on our next visit.
Leslie R.,Palo Alto  CA,142,19,49,2/13/2017,5.0,I have to give recognition to the bartender Erik C. since we came into the restaurant the other night  we asked about an old sandwich that we had in the past on menu and Erik was quick to inform us that we could still order it (California Chicken sandwich). He happily confirmed our order and communicated it to a manager about the trickiness of making it so that it would come to us right. Unfortunately it did not come out correct and needed to be remade. Eric was very sympathetic and handled the problem with top priority for us which we appreciated. The manager in the end even comped the item entirely due to the problems we had over it which wasn't necessary but appreciated nonetheless. We only sit at the bar when Erik is working since he seems to be the only bartender that shows genuine care and concern for us as customers. Thank you BJ's!
Randy P.,San Jose  CA,105,62,3,2/1/2017,5.0,I just came her with my friend because he owed me dinner. The happy hour food was amazing and the happy hour shots were only $5. We had an amazing waitress named Mollary M at the bar area. She had amazing customer service and was really nice to us. I told my friend to tip her 50% because she was a great waitress but he ended only tipping her 15%! I didnt know this until I went outside. So  if you're reading this  I apologize for that!! I'll make sure you get the right amount of tip that you deserve next time I come. I hope at least your manager reads this.
Paula D.,San Jose  CA,9,39,1,10/4/2016,5.0,Always a great place for dinner whether it's with the little kids (delicious kid's chicken strips!) or adults only enjoying a frosty glass of their crafted beers  there's something for every palate. My salmon quinoa was cooked perfectly  the pizzas were awesome  and the crispy asparagus appetizer was the bomb!Tonight  Biagio was our man! Our water/tea/sodas were refilled several times  our every request was taken care of quickly (more sauce  etc.) and he was very personable and professional.We can't wait to come back!
Karen M.,San Jose  CA,13,86,4,3/5/2017,1.0,Came here last night with a party of 7 people and was told wait is around an hour to 90 mins. The text message we got on the phone was 40 mins so we figure we'll wait while we walk around the mall. An hour in  we went to check to see if we are close and they told us they had us down for 4 instead of 7 people! How the hell did that happen? I have no clue but my guess is they are busy and the people that are working could care less. So even though they made a mistake they told us it'll be another 90 mins. At this point we told them to cancel it and we walked off. Ended up eating at the food court because we are now starving. Bjs have decent food  I mean but nothing worth waiting that long for. I am very disappointed in the host staff. Won't be returning since there are so many good food places in the bay.
Eileen L.,Sacramento  CA,336,239,226,11/17/2015,2.0,BJ's food is always consistent throughout the locations  I would rate the food a solid 4-stars. Certain items can be a bit prciey for the portion  but their pizzas and beers are divine.The service on the other hand  varies per location. This location has the worst customer service of the 5 BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse locations I have visited in Northern California. The waitstaff seem to be bothered right when you walk through the door. They don't seem that friendly and they do not like to smile. One time  my unenthusiastic server took my order frowning the entire time. And continued to do so when there was a food run or answering our questions when we needed assistance. I've worked in food service  I get it  it sucks sometimes. But you gotta stick it through and provide exceptional service if you're getting paid for it.Granted  I came here with a party of 15 and had gotten another server  who seemed to be a bit more friendly and kind. It's really hit and miss  which is rare considering I usually get awesome service at BJ's. Location is convenient  it's located right in the midst of a large shopping mall. Great for hungry shoppers who need a bite.
Jodi N.,Sunnyvale  CA,0,9,,5/14/2017,5.0,Jenoveva was terrific!!! Such a great time and she accomidated all our needs! She was super fun and attentive. We appreciated her service.
Alisia V.,Orlando  FL,105,195,135,1/21/2016,3.0,Ok  so the service was a little off but she was very pleasant about it which to me makes a huge difference. I had the appetizer root beer ribs and the saracha Brussels sprouts. Both very yummy and just the right size without being overly filling. Now the highlight of this visit was my cucumber jalapeo margarita. Ok the 2 jalapeo cucumber margaritas. Soo yummy and light and what a great way to get your veggies. I gotta try the basil watermelon margarita next time.
Anthony D.,North Valley  San Jose  CA,0,4,,8/4/2016,4.0,I stopped by this place a few months ago and was very impressed with my server. His name was Bruk. After coming in and ordering our food  our group was met with a longer wait for food than usual. Bruk approached us and offered us free dessert as an apology.The food was great and service was top notch. I will stop by again.
Mike L.,San Jose  CA,29,17,,1/30/2017,3.0,I was here last week for the NFL conference championship games. Good crowd on hand. Food is okay.
Joelyn C.,San Jose  CA,24,15,1,12/23/2016,1.0,I would give a zero if I had the chance. I came with my lido family to have a nice dinner but got very very poor customer service!! My waiter name was Caesar and at first was givingUs amazing customer service but all of a sudden after he took out order  we were neglected!! Once the food came came out like we were invisible. My husband order the sirloin steak and with potatoes and wedge fries . ther steak it was really tiny and the fries never came out when we were looking for the waiter to ask if that's how it was supposed to be he was no where in so sight. My husband told me to just ignore because he has work in the restaurant industry before. But then when I saw the young gentleman leave the front door is when I was upset: we sat and waited to see if any one was going to comeAnd help us and we just decided to just eat it and go. About 20 minutes after a young lady came and said she was taking over Caesar tables. And we ask for a box to go.Got the box and again waited for the another 10Minutes.when it cameFor us to get a check no one ever came. My husband went to the front end and ask forThe check! I will for sure not b coming to this bjs ever again!!
Jamie P.,San Jose  CA,535,20,117,1/3/2017,2.0,Usually my experience at this bjs is pretty mediocre  but this last time my server was not the best unfortunately. Don't come here after 10:30 pm and expect good service!
Manda Bear B.,San Francisco  CA,4189,1773,47512,10/3/2015,3.0,***************************** 1416 *************************** Happy hour is happening here on a game night. The $8.95 unlimited salad and soup for lunch is good. However  their soups are often salty and the salads are over-dressing. I usually ask the dressing on the side.  Service is usually good here but super slow at lunch time. I think they don't want us to order more soup and salad  so they took their time...
Maleah M.,San Jose  CA,927,598,4610,2/27/2015,2.0,Pizookie: a warm small pie sized cookie topped with ice cream. You can only get this at bjs. You can definitely make these at home  but it's convenient to buy it already made. Other than the pizookie  nothing else stands out here. The pastas  the pizza's  everything is just okay. Go somewhere else for dinner then grab a pizookie here for dessert.
Dan M.,Milpitas  CA,240,9,1,2/28/2017,5.0,We had Paul and he was awesome so sweet and accommodating gave us great suggestions and at the end had our checks all split without even having to ask!!!
Jayar T.,Milpitas  CA,0,4,1,3/22/2017,5.0,Katie was a great serverRECIEVED great service!!!!!Had a good dinner and a good night thanks!!!
J I.,Chino Hills  CA,0,13,10,6/4/2016,1.0,"I knew I shouldn\'t have came back  but here I am... There was no silverware on the table when we got our appetizer. I asked the waiter and he responded w ""oh they didn\'t give it to you"" and went to get it... Why would I ask you for it in the first place. He continues to proceed with a dumb comment ""you guys are the first people I\'ve seen to eat calamari with a fork.."" Ok maybe if your calamari wasn\'t disgustingly greasy I wouldn\'t need one. I will not be tipping and I will be paying my bill in all $1s lol. Not coming back. Today is Saturday June 4. I get that it\'s busy  but I have a 0 tolerance for stupid comments made by staff."
Stacey K.,San Jose  CA,81,10,1,11/17/2016,2.0,My boyfriend and I come here once in a while  we always leave very satisfied with our food. Last night was a little different... my boyfriend ordered a burger and I ordered pasta. We both thought that our food tasted good. As soon as we were done my boyfriend didn't feel very well. We went home and he had a headache and a non stop fever all night. He got up around 6am to get ready for work and started throwing up. I took him to the ER because he was in so much pain. Dr told us he has food poisoning from whatever he ate last night. I think we will be staying away from this place for a while.
Dylan B.,Gilroy  CA,119,1,,10/17/2016,1.0,I sat at the bar and got a drink by Eric the bartender late night around 10 and the drink he made tasted like it didn't have any alcohol in it at all. My advice  never order from the bar when Eric is bar tending.
Yvonne V.,San Jose  CA,0,11,3,8/11/2016,5.0,Service was amazing! Waiter was friendly and attentive! The cookies and cream pizookie was the highlight of the meal. A must have dessert!
Lynn C.,San Francisco  CA,213,483,2020,11/12/2014,1.0,Came in during a giants game with my friends. We sat at a booth by the bar. In the beginning  our sever was attentive. She took our order of drinks and an appetizer. We told her we needed a couple of minutes to look at the menu and that happened about twice. We waited after that  about 15 minutes. We order our entrees and asked for another appetizer. 30 minutes later  we receive our entrees with the appetizer. It didn't make sense so we asked for the appetizer  you know the plate you get BEFORE  not during  your entree off the check and had them take it back. The food was very bland and cold. The worst bjs I've been to. And the worst experience. You'd think with a franchise there would be consistent plates and service. That's not the case here. I recommend going to the Fremont location. Way better experience and food.
Nick P.,San Jose  CA,7,46,39,9/23/2015,1.0,Curbside service is BEYOND misleading. First off All the internet lead time said it would take 15 minutes. I got there 20 minutes after the 15 estimation onlu to wait for 20 more minutes with a screaming toddler i. The car with a 14 yr old. Love the food. Not curbside or DOORDASH FOR THIS RESTAURANT. The only reason I even did curbside is because Doordash for BJS was 120 minutes.Fyi the phone orders get less prioritized! Those words are the truth. I saw 3 people get food and pay their bill before I was even acknowledged.Go out to eat people lesson learned! Families with small children just ixnay Bjs all together!Jesus help us!
Pat L.,San Jose  CA,102,72,104,9/5/2015,4.0,Went to this BJ Brewery with my sons. We were quite surprised how crowded it was but the 30 min wait was worth it. The waiting and host staff were very friendly and had great sense of humor even though the restaurant was packed. Our dining experience was great. The menu selection was large and had lots of variety for everyone's taste buds. We ordered a pizza  burger and top sirloin steak. All were good tasting and priced reasonably. But the dessert was out of bounds - the cookie and cream Pizookie. Go check out BJ's at Oakridge Mall.
Katherine N.,Mountain View  CA,4,33,9,12/27/2016,4.0,You know  I really want to hate this place. Big  bougie  whitebread American chain. Except  dang it  they have a nice selection of very tasty beers  and a lot of healthy  delicious food in addition to the burgers and pizza. This is one of the few places all my coworker's can consistently agree on  and we leave happy every. single. time.Food I've tried and liked: Brussels sprouts (OMG)  Asian chicken salad  tomato soup  club sandwich  veggie burger  super food salad  chocolate chip pizookie  fried portobellos (seasonal?)  cherry glazed salmon  thick-cut fries  jalapeo burger  kale salad (names may be approximate).Beer I've tried and liked: ALL OF IT DANG IT. And they offer 4 oz pours for lightweights like me who would spend the afternoon sleeping off a full beer.The one thing I'd steer clear of is the calamari. It just is not tasty  and it's soggy AF. One of my coworkers gets it every time  but I think that's only because it grosses out someone else on our team  and he knows I'll help finish anything... I've had it oh so many times now  and it is always nasty.
Martan A.,Fraser  MI,17,66,185,5/11/2016,4.0,Here on a trip for work with a co-worker.  We both got the deep dish pizzas and they were very good. Also tried the beer sampler. Our server was very good and attentive.
Kimbria F.,San Jose  CA,171,5,,2/19/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Had a delicious and fun dinner date last night and it wouldn't have happened without our awesome server Seth. He was very friendly  attentive  and recommended delicious food (the Spicy Chicken Peanut Soba noodle dish-very yummy!). Thanks Seth for your services! :D
Cathleen N.,San Jose  CA,1,8,1,1/15/2017,5.0,Great selection of beer such as IPA and stouts. Cajun pasta is also not on the menu but is my favorite dish. Would definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner and drink!
Heidi B.,San Jose  CA,2,12,,9/23/2016,2.0,Since we have had about 49 minutes to site here and wait for our server to check on us or pick up the tab  I thought I'd write a review about how much service sucked today. We have been waiting for over 40 minutes for our server to check on us. We had a question about the bill and haven't been able to find our server anywhere. Worst service ever!
Garret B.,San Jose  CA,4,30,10,6/30/2016,4.0,Great tasting food  big menu  nice decor and pretty friendly waiters. Portions are super small though. Surprised by how small my California grilled sandwich was for $11.50 and my pazooki (spelling?) desert was embarrassing small in comparison to the picture in the menu (see picture). So  whatever you see in the menu  divide it by two. ;) Tried the ginger IPA which was great. I'd come back again but not as much as what I at first the ought I would. :-)
Emily P.,San Jose  CA,263,348,175,6/12/2014,5.0,This BJs is located at Oakridge Mall and is always a long wait because of the amount of people that come here. I'm still giving this place 5 stars because it's not their fault that this place is so good and everyone wants to come here!Yesterday I celebrated my son's 11th birthday there and had a party of 15. Because I'm so smart  I called right when they opened yesterday to make a reservation for 6:30pm. I was told reservations need manager's approval which was easy for them to get. I'm not sure if a manager's approval is always needed or it was just needed this week because of all the graduation dinners going on.For people that were just walking in the wait was one and half hours to two hours (which is the usual wait for this place but I think it was a little bit longer because of all the grad dinners going on). I got there 6:20pm and my table was ready on the dot by 6:30pm! Which is nice about this place when you have a reservation is that your whole party does not need to be there to be seated. We had a nice long table out on the patio setup. We had great and fast service the whole night. A huge plus was that all our food for dinner came out at once and all of the orders were correct (this is always a huge challenge when having a big party). For dessert  everyone got pizookies! But before bringing everyone's pizookie out  they brought the birthday boy's out with a candle for us to sing happy birthday :)I would definitely come here again for when I have a big dinner party!TIP #1: You can only make reservations for a table if you have a party of 10 or more.TIP #2: Don't forget to give your BJs Rewards Card to earn points! If you don't have one  sign up for free!
Christian Z.,San Jose  CA,0,4,1,1/5/2017,5.0,Wow  I have been to be BJs many times throughout the years  and my experience were maybe all 3s  but today it was something else. I had maybe the best waiter I have ever had in my life. It was my friends birthday and we were a group of 15ish. With this many people I expected the service to be a little under average. Wow was I wrong. Luckily we were given the waiter Paul. This guy was one of the coolest and best waiter I have ever met. My drink was always full  he checked up on us the perfect amount of times  the food came out hot... he was the perfect waiter. Thank you Paul !
Christina L.,San Jose  CA,249,212,275,6/14/2014,4.0,I give this BJs 4 star solely for their excellent customer service compared to the other BJs I've been to. Food quality seems a little better as wellMy family and I always get the tuna tartare and wings for appetizers. My personal favorite entree is the scallops and veggies. Pizzas there are always delicious and their jambalaya is delish as well.What makes the differences is their good customer service even if they're a big franchise. All the servers are attentive and make sure that you are satisfied and happy by the time you leave. I'll drive from Sunnyvale to come to this restaurant because there is a difference between the restaurants
Eddie A.,Citrus Heights  CA,10,10,,12/18/2016,1.0,I have been to this location once a year for the past three years I have never gotten the order correct I've waited 25 minutes one year to be waited on then got the wrong meal. The next year I went and once again waited 25 minutes for food and it was undercooked. This year I went in with my family not only did they get the order wrong they forgot the sides we sent it back it took 25 minutes to get a sandwich returned that was messed up  I never got my side dish . The server was so upset with the kitchen that he got the manager the manager heard what was going on and came over to the table personally to apologize and tried his best to take care of the problem. He made it to my satisfaction for the screw up tonight but this was three out of three I will never set foot in this restaurant again.
Diane T.,San Jose  CA,0,39,2,6/7/2016,2.0,First time eating at BJ's... After hearing so many good things about this place  I'm pretty disappointed. When we arrived  based on my own personal preferences  I was hoping to sit in the booths  but instead  we got seated in chairs. No biggie really- except that there was this stench coming from the table that smelled really gross  and the menus was really sticky for some reason. When our server came to take our order  he didn't even try to help us as we were looking for the beverages to choose from. After getting our drinks  my friend ordered the grilled chicken alfredo pasta  while I ordered the shrimp asparagus penne pasta. We were both disappointed because the noodles weren't even fully cooked right  both dishes lacked a lot of flavor  my shrimp tasted raw and flavorless  and my friend even founded a piece of hair in his food.Overall  $50 (excluding tip) could have been well spent somewhere else... This restaurant really needs to work on improving their food quality  and maintaining a cleaner  more sanitary environment. I am not expecting to come back here anytime soon  unless it is for the pazookie.
Sandra H.,San Jose  CA,0,2,,1/1/2017,5.0,First time coming in to this location. My server was Biagio  he truly made the experience worth it. He was so warm & welcoming will definitely be coming back!! :)
Paola B.,San Jose  CA,54,108,51,4/17/2016,5.0,I always love coming here! Ambience is always on point and the servers are always so friendly and helpful.
Donnette T.,Saratoga  CA,15,68,148,8/16/2016,5.0,Avocado egg rolls. Don't need to say much more. Except Pizookie! Our server in the bar this Tuesday night is Ken  he is busy but totally on the ball and got us everything with a smile and in time for us to get to our movie -- great food & service and Mai Tai!!
Jill O.,San Jose  CA,202,65,29,4/15/2016,4.0,Donovan was fantastic! He was literally born for this job! It is clear that he was working really hard!  The food was pretty good  I just wished the calamari was a bit more meaty! Fettuccine was delicious! Over all  great atmosphere  good food  and fabulous service! I will be returning soon!
Clif C.,Palo Alto  CA,0,16,,1/12/2017,5.0,"Went there for a very special BIRTH day.Paul was amazing. Just a very wonderful personality  great humor. He\'s that kind of person and personality that\'s successful and ""living life to the fullest"" wherever  whatever he\'s doing.Two of our kids wanted food too  but they were at home. So aside from the in-house dining which was awesome  we had to order take out.Paul had the attention to ""time"" the take out orders. (So that the dinner was hot when we arrived home - and the dessert still cold  etc). They were difficult take out items.We noticed that Paul took the energy and focus to put the take out orders in such a way that it could be enjoyed really well at the house too. He remembered our preferences with sauces and what not.If something was meant to be cold or frozen  he separated them from the hot foods. Just really impressed. He has an attention to detail  works hard  and also shows he loves what he\'s doing. When the kids opened and ate the takeout  there was that sense of care from Paul. He didn\'t just serve us and throw us away after we gave the tip. He took the energy and time to arrange things so that even with all the cuisine at home  the kids could enjoy BJ\'s dishes.BJ\'s Oakridge seems to attract this kind of staff. We\'ve had great customer service experiences before too."
Jen R.,Milpitas  CA,0,7,7,12/7/2016,5.0,O. M. G. Without a doubt the best experience! Great food and amazing service! Thank you Sean! Your food recs were ON POINT and we never had an empty cup. Moms lunch out and this was a fantastic lunch! Thank you!!
Scruffy G.,Santa Clara  CA,0,7,,6/8/2017,4.0,Patrick  our server was superb  attentive and courteous. We had a couple of picky eaters and he had no problem with the requests. The food was very tasty   what a great experience.
Brian S.,Aptos  CA,0,3,,1/3/2017,4.0,Love the Jambalaya.  All 3 of us in our party had the jambalaya and we all thought it was great.  Our server Kadie did a great job  bringing us a complimentary birthday pizookie at the end of the meal.  She was especially attentive since we had been waiting for several minutes after being seated  and no one offered to take our order.  Turned out  her shift was over  but she stayed overtime since they were short-staffed. We live nearby  and will continue to go here and recommend it to others.We were there on Jan 2  which turned out to be a holiday for some people  so it was very crowded.
Austin J.,San Jose  CA,107,2,,1/1/2017,5.0,Biagio L was a great server he served us well & was very fast to help us . First time at bjs ever since I moved here to San Jose . I recommend you guys come to bjs and ask for him to be your server
Benjamin S.,Sacramento  CA,192,8,9,5/31/2016,5.0,I've been to plenty of BJs in my life  but I've never had the service I had at this restaurant. Our waiter--Frankie  I think his name was--gave my friends and I the best service yet. He was great at recommending drinks  food  and gave us some great laughs. Despite the delay in food  our waiter kept us laughing. Everyone in our group agrees--we've never had better service before this waiter. Collectively  we were a pretty big table  but all of us ended up tipping our waiter at least 20. Great time.
Hadley W.,San Jose  CA,4,6,,1/9/2017,4.0,It was a wonderful dinner for a wonderful food. We enjoyed the night as well as the service goes. The place is nice and clean.
Vanessa S.,San Jose  CA,0,8,,6/10/2017,1.0,Slow service  bad food. Food was delivered after over 30 minutes and was cold. As we sat waiting for our check the waiter was taking selfies with friends at another table. If looking for a late bite at Oakridge stick to Cheesecake Factory.
Mar E.,San Jose  CA,66,38,,10/18/2016,4.0,visited BJ's 2x in a month  for me  that's a good thing! the first time was the jalapeo burger  yum!! the second time  about 2 weeks ago  my family went for my brothers birthday. we had 7 adults and 1 child. the appetizer came out quickly as did most of our food. i ordered a rib eye  but probably should leave steaks to steakhouses. other than that  the monkey bread is amazing and so is their pizookies!! i must say too  this dinner truly was a great one because of Biagio and his superior customer service and attention to our table. service is always just as important as the food! thanks Biagio!!
Danielle D.,San Jose  CA,0,4,,12/23/2016,5.0,Saba was a sweetheart and a really excellent server  I wish my service at every restaurant was as good as Saba was to us.
Manju N.,San Jose  CA,0,7,,12/4/2016,4.0,"We came here on a Sunday evening.. it was half an hour wait for us.. we ordered avocado egg rolls  extra spicy buffalo chicken wings and nachos for starters.. the service was pretty quick.. we loved the avocado rolls and the wings.. nachos was good as well but it\'s a huge portion.. for entree we had spicy peanut chicken with soba noodles and a chicken tortilla soup.. soup was a tad bit too salty for me and the noodles was okay.. dessert was pizzookie.. :) macadamia was aah so ""finger licking good""!"
