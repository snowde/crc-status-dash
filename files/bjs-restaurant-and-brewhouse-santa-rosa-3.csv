Catherine W.,San Rafael  CA,34,121,28,12/1/2017,3.0,"You  know  after seeing the 2.5 star reviews here  I can make a case for ""categories"" of restaurants. BJ\'s is NOT the place you want to take someone you want to make a positive impression on (like  the first time you take your girl\'s parents out  or something  unless this already happens to be their favorite restaurant). However  if you are looking for a casual place for some beer  some conversation  a meeting place to watch the game or an all out  guilty pleasure place to imbibe in some drink and bar food - this is your place!We come here when we have the craving for some comfort food and a pizookie (dessert). Rarely does this place disappoint. Is the waitstaff super attentive and ready with suggestions and always there when you water needs filling? To be honest  not really. Does the bartender know every drink in the book and then some  when you need just that sumpin  sumpin special? No  don\'t think so. However  if you know what you want  a burger  a huge salad or basic  filling appy\'s  this is your place! We love the food here  for what it is - don\'t come here on watching your weight  come for some American fare  a little greasy in places  very filling and satisfyingly delicious  if nothing fancy American fare is what you want. At night  the place is a bit  dark  but the better to watch the game on the huge big screen TV\'s all scattered about the place. As mentioned before  the waitstaff does a journeyman\'s job  but again  but if you ask them for water as they are whizzing by  they willingly accommodate. One night we came and found several single diners (one person only)  so if that is something you do  you can dine in privacy.Our favorites - anything on the appetizer list  a huge salad (or a small beet salad)  a big burger or pasta dish. I usually have an appetizer and the hubby usually goes for an entree. For lunch  I have had a big salad  shared it with a friend and a beer is just right!For dessert  pizookie is the thing! A play on words (combination of a cookie and a pizza) you get a soft serve cookie topped with a scoop of ice cream! We usually get the ice cream on the side - it is eaten with a spoon  and again - not a diet item  not even a little bit! For variety  you can order three mini pizookies at a time  each topped with a ""scooplet"" of ice cream. The cookie would seem to be made with a bit of flour to hold it together  a whole lotta sugar and a whole lotta butter! It is really good  but again  it has to be the kind of thing you want...In the end  you really won\'t leave in need of another meal easily until morning. As a family  when you have one of those nights where cooking is not a possibility  but if you are hungry AF and you NEED to have some FOOD  come here. If you are with friends and it\'s kinda late and you have the munchies  come here! If your house is a mess  but you want to watch the game with friends  come here! We like BJ\'s just fine!"
Julia S.,Petaluma  CA,16,32,1,11/13/2017,5.0,I love this place!!! From the easy call in to reserve seats  to the great food and the warm service  this place is a five star eatery and brewery!It's full of life  people are happy to be here!You can't go wrong with comfortable vinyl seating  you're surrounded by HD big screen televisions.Whether your sitting at the full size bar or the cushy vinyl booths  this place rocks!They offer a variety of beer and spirits  from local IPA's to passion fruity mixers to brew samplers  you can't go wrong or fall short of thirst:)My fianc' loved the shrimp jambalaya  my son had the hickory brisket and bacon sandwich  I really don't remember him eating it because it was there and gone it less than 5 minutes  if you know what I mean  it must have been yummy!I tried the rib eye steak medium well with their fluffy mashed potatoes and seasoned asparagus  sizzled to perfection..Try the garlic bread twisty bread  their to die for  not too salty with a hint of garlic salt  delicioso'!And last but definitely not to say the least  there's dessertI gulped down the Ghirardelli (home grown in San Fran) chocolate chunk pizookie   it literally melts in your mouth...Although it's located outside of Cottingtown mall in Santa Rosa  you would never know  that's how awesome this atmosphere is!-Please visit this great place  you'll not only be doing a service to the employees  but to the community and the many families who have lost their homes or displaced from the October fire!#Sonomastrong
Dave J.,Monterey  CA,5,6,5,10/20/2017,1.0,Horrible service didn't even bring silverware!Fries were never brought!No drink service forgot Dr Pepper Too busy for the staff of teensNot enough qualified serversWhen telling another employee that our drink order never arrived the Air Headed Girl said...oh this isn't my table...We tried to let things slide.....But the chicken fried steak burger came out bloody raw...Waters were non filledAll in All I'd say I wish we would of gone to McDonalds!!
Aaron B.,Valley Ford  CA,4,69,32,8/12/2017,3.0,We had lunch here today and after correcting my order of my supposed to be well done burger but came red in the middle and correcting our iced tea of which I said lots of ice no lemon and they came with lemon and hardly any ice. It finally came correct and the food was very good. All in all the food is tasty and the atmosphere is loud  busy and cozy if your in a booth.They also have brunch and seating outside and a bar area for those of you who are interested.
Shirley B.,Santa Rosa  CA,59,93,433,7/28/2017,1.0,What can I say that others haven't? I'm shocked that this establishment is a chain  and has managed to stay viable as a business  especially considering the name of the place. This particular BJ's is part of a mall in Santa Rosa. Food: I wish I'd captured a photo of the chips and queso. The first plate they dropped off was appalling. Chips were slathered in grease  and there were many small broken pieces. We returned it  asking for chips that weren't dripping in oil. The second plate was half the size of the first for some reason  and it didn't look much better. There was a sad bowl of watered down queso with zero flavor. The chicken fried steak burger came with an over-cooked fried egg  burned chicken fried steak  and no gravy. Not a single drop. Fries were soggy with grease. The lemon thyme chicken was lacking lemon and thyme. Service: Slightly redeeming  as their waitstaff were attentive  keeping glasses refilled. Cost: Three entrees  two apps  and four iced teas ran us $65 and change. Overall: The menu is like a book  and the variety means they don't do anything well. Just loads of less than mediocre food at some high prices. Zero ambience inside  and the ladies room was in dire need of cleaning. Note: We were there at the slow time of the day  around 3:30pm. There's loads of parking outside as it's part of a mall  and you can shop before or after eating. But really. This place is worse than disappointing. Hard to spend money here when there are so many other great options in town.
Ed M.,Healdsburg  CA,0,10,,12/5/2017,2.0,Stopped in for lunch. We both ordered the chicken tortilla soup plus my wife ordered a salad and I ordered prime rib dip. The first thing to appear was my prime rib dip. Next ONE of the soup orders to my wife  then her salad. Then the other soup order some time later. The jus cup for my dip had just a little in it  and I ran out with the first half; so I asked the waitress for more. A very long time later she brought a cup of something that looked like chicken soup; (probably jus with water added.)My wife talked me out of leaving a small tip because she felt that the problems were in the kitchen and not the waitress' fault.It will be a long time  if ever  when we will be in that noisy place again.
Evelyn M.,Castro Valley  CA,192,111,1570,11/20/2017,5.0,Came in on a Friday midnight for some drinks n a bit to eat. Had my first beer flight n loved it. The prices were great they gav us happy hour prices even tho it wasn't a happy hour day or time. Server was sweet n friendly place was nice n clean. I felt it was bigger than most BJs I've gone to so I would think the wait time isn't that bad out here if I were to go during the day when it's busy. I always tell ppl to try the pizookie it's a must when ur at BJs
Bob F.,Belmont  CA,38,364,,10/1/2017,4.0,Came here for a light dinner one night recently. Had appetizers and beer.  It was great that they could accommodate a large party on a Sunday evening without too much of a wait.The menu is huge. Split a salad and appetizer with my wife. They were not terribly memorable. Also got the Tatonka Stout. That was really tasty. i would have that again. I think I need to try more things on their menu. I expect to be back.
Cruz M.,Eureka  CA,0,1,,11/30/2017,5.0,I've always been a fan of BJ's but this visit was exceptional. The food was cooked to perfection and my server  Matt  was awesome! He was super fun  still while keeping his space. I never had an empty glass. I loved my time there and definitely would recommend.
Nichole W.,Santa Rosa  CA,3,25,4,11/26/2017,1.0,Extremely long waits ( consistently) I had the Mahi Mahi taco. We had a sausage for an app. It was burned. So were the Brussel sprouts. I am so sick right now. My Stomach is destroyed.
Stephanie T.,Santa Rosa  CA,11,161,63,9/30/2017,3.0,Formula food at its best. That sounds kind of snobby but really the food is fine and the service is reliably good. This was an affordable dinner out for the family.
Brett S.,Petaluma  CA,6,14,,11/19/2017,1.0,While the ambiance looked promising  this place failed to deliver. On a Sunday evening  We waited for 25 minutes even though there were upwards of 15 empty tables. When we were seated  we waited for too long to get menus. Our server was clearly still learning the POS system  which would have been fine if she did not walk away when my wife was in mid sentence giving her order!My Cobb salad arrived without the avocado. After 10 minutes of trying to get our server 's attention  she finally came over. When I asked about the avocado  she argued with me. She was sure that it was not on the menu. Our stack of menus were still on the table (she never bothered to pick them up) so I showed her. So  she said she would go ask the kitchen. After she left  I noticed that I did not have Any dressing in my salad. By this point  the experience was ruined.While BJ's has a reputation for large servings  this was not the case with the Cobb salad. There were a total of four bites worth of chicken  and about two tablespoons of bacon. Skimpy for a $14 salad.Don't waste your time or money. There are many great restaurants in Santa Rosa.
Gina H.,Santa Rosa  CA,60,69,63,9/18/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Came here because my pregnant niece was wanting chicken Alfredo. What she wants  she will get. Pretty good size portion but only came with one small croissant. Was going to ask for more but apparently this is the place to go late nights. We got there around 10:30pm and it was pretty busy. The waiter  who I didn't get his name  went in to details about the Pizookies since he said some customers think they're free. That cracked us up. It was a good night.
Donnailla J.,Santa Rosa  CA,4,6,105,12/4/2017,1.0,On a positive note our waitress was very nice. Our food took about 40 minutes after we ordered. 1 order was a lettuce wrap Burger which was served on top of paper and a tin baking pan. It looked extremely unappetizing. The child's chicken strips came 10 minutes after the two adults were served. The child's chicken strips were overcooked and was served with ROTTEN fruit. The manager apologized and said he would fix it. The waitress came with and another cup of fruit. That fruit was ROTTEN as well. If there was no quality in the fruit I can just imagine the lack of quality control with everything else that we couldn't see back in the kitchen. Absolutely disgusting I will never go back! Food inspectors need to be called in at this point.
Miss T.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,36,12,9/27/2017,1.0,Our team works very close and we frequent all of the local places but will NEVER eat at BJs again. We have had so many bad visits sprinkled with a few so-so visits but no more. So sick of the management being aware of the errors and just not coming through. Ordered online for a curbside pickup and it wasn't ready at the time promised. Got back to the jobsite and TWO SIDES WERE MISSING so there were no fries and no fruit salad. My Ahi wasn't seared at all- just seasoned and sliced  no wasabi. And the brussels sprouts were missing the spicy sauce so it was just plain roasted  unseasoned veggies. News today says the owners are looking to sell the chain...maybe new owners will improve on this place but for now  if you like well cooked food and attention to your orders  find another place to eat because this place is a HUGE FAIL.
Jill D.,Santa Rosa  CA,86,14,,12/2/2017,1.0,Went to have dinner and a drink or two at the bar last Thursday night. Bartenders are quick to get you a drink after ordering it but it took more than an hour and 20 minutes to receive food after ordering it. Bartender never apologized for the long wait or asked how our dinner was. Food was mediocre at best. I think their only concern is serving as many drinks as they can to you. There was a couple next to us that should not have been served any more drinks as they were extremely intoxicated. Perhaps ABC needs to get involved and bring decoys in to investigate. I will not be returning to BJ's Brewhouse as there are far too many responsible local restaurants with great food and exceptional service. So long BJ's.
X Z.,Windsor  CA,45,58,33,11/9/2017,1.0,Last night was fun. The food was awesome. Tina  our waitress  was awesome. What isn't awesome is that BJ's thinks it's still okay to hand out Styrofoam take home boxes. NOT OKAY. If BJ's is going to be that cheap...then are they being cheap with the food too? Hmmm...what was it that I really ate? It looked healthy...but were the ingredients really made of?? I'm so scared now! :-PIs someone paying attention in management? I am. I'll stay away for now...until I can compost my take home box...Tina...I'm sorry. You're really cool...but the Styrofoam boxes....I can't. I just can't.
Laurie E.,Cotati  CA,0,30,7,11/12/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Waited over an hour again for dinner. The excuses are getting old. Food was tasty but you'd think they could serve dinner less than an hour! I keep giving them another try and every time the service is worse. Ugh!
Spike W.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,44,169,8/30/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Always a good eatery for Burgers and Salads. Well we're here again for just that on a Wednesday no less - $10 Loaded Burgers with unlimited fries. My hubby got his favorite Cheese Bacon Burger made as he requested - mmmm good - 7oz med-rare burger with grilled onions on a Parmesan bun with lettuce  tomato  cheese & bacon. Didn't have additional fries but they're good. Eat when all is hot - great! My seared Ahi Tuna salad was great as usual! This was a late lunch so we didn't indulge with a cocktail - we waited until later for that. Always satisfied. Thank you Kim  our server.
Courtney K.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,1,,11/18/2017,4.0,Great drinks/beers. Healthy delicious food options. Very good service. Alec in take out is awesome and would make a fantastic server.
Ada M.,Sacramento  CA,37,2,1,11/9/2017,4.0,After reading the recent reviews I was hesitant to try this particular BJs. It was a great experience! The waitress was super attentive and we all had a great experience!
Jennifer L.,Santa Rosa  CA,14,82,4,2/25/2017,1.0,"I always come to Bj\'s having high hopes  but never again. What happened to this place!? Everything about this restaurant used to be outstanding. The service  food  and BASICALLY EVERYTHING has gone down hill. I came in a couple weeks ago and ordered Chicken Alfredo and they forgot to place broccoli in my dish. I asked our waitress for a side of broccoli because the chef forgot it and she said ""dang  you caught it."" Tonight  they left out the chicken in my CHICKEN Alfredo. They always serve their food slightly cold or not fresh at all. For instance  I came in and ordered a bacon and avocado grill cheese with my coworkers. The bread was stale and the avocados were bad!!"
Brandon P.,Santa Rosa  CA,137,30,64,11/4/2017,3.0,Service was ok  took a bit to get my bill processed. The Peruvian -Quinoa Bowl with Shrimp is filling  but lacks strong flavor  the shrimp saved the dish  it was seasoned with salt and pepper  best part of the dish. A little more flavor with the quinoa and vegetables would be nice.
Ana R.,Windsor  CA,18,2,,9/24/2017,1.0,Second time eating here and the service was as bad as the pizza we ate! The toppings were almost raw and the tomatoes looked canned! And they put way too much ice in the drinks. The raspberry ice tea had no taste! You won't find me or my family going back again.
Anthony G.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,8,,10/29/2017,1.0,The service was slow and the southern fried chicken sandwich was not very good. It was dry and looked like our food was under a lamp for awhile.
M R.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,16,,9/26/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I stayed away from BJ's for several years  hoping they'd improve. They haven't  they've actually gotten worse. Dirty silverware  cold and under-cooked food  lousy service. I got my appetizer which was blazing hot  then 5 minutes later they bring the main course. I'm still eating the appetizer while my main course gets cold. What?! You guys should have learned how to time your service so customers get their food at appropriate times years ago. I'd expect this from a new restaurant  not a regional (national?) chain. I'm never going back.
Gene I.,Calistoga  CA,24,13,1,11/5/2017,5.0,Excellent again! I eat here occasionally and don't understand the 2.5 rating. I have never had a bad experience good food and good service!
Hector O.,Roseville  CA,0,5,,11/3/2017,5.0,So I went with a good size group and the service was great but the food was horrible. I ordered the rib eye rare with mash potatoes fully loaded and broccoli. When it finally arrived I had a baked potato  broccoli and my steak. In my thoughts no big deal it's a potato but as soon as I cut my rib eye I was very disappointed  WELL DONE!!!!!! So the only thing on my plate that was right was my broccoli. I did not eat my rib eye at all  very disappointed. Unfortunately we had big group the waitress did her best but not once did anyone ask me how my food was. It should raise a flag when a full rib eye steak does not get eaten. How does RARE turn to WELL DONE. Fortunately for me I will never go back to this location.******Update  as soon as I posted this review  the General Manager for the restaurant reached and out and made the experience right  great way to show the customer focus  thank you Pedro for that and just for the thoughts 5 stars. Thank you.
H M.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,27,1,7/20/2017,2.0,I give it two stars instead of one  because their dessert is delicious. It's also pretty clean  and there are lots of tables.Otherwise  I promise you can get much better food for the same prices somewhere else in the area. I've been here three times total. I thought the first time was just a fluke with average service and being surrounded by really obnoxious other customers--rude  loud  and a toddler threw up on the table next to me. Obviously not BJ's fault. The second time  service was still sort of slow  and the food was mediocre. The third time  the service was better and more friendly  but the food was so bad (again  except for dessert). I just ate my dinner because I was hungry and would feel bad wasting food.
Bernie D.,Stockton  CA,34,1,1,10/15/2017,5.0,Thank You Bj's... for your hospitality. What more can I say. Great food complimented by great service. The staff here is awesome. They made feel like a part of their family. We can't thank this restaurant enough... and how well ur staff accommodated all the first responders that helped with the Fire relief efforts... Thank u!!! Thank u!!! Thank u!!!
Anisa A.,Santa Rosa  CA,32,222,152,3/18/2017,5.0,This BJ's location is always a go-to.It's kinda nice that they change up their menu as often as they do. It's probably why we don't mind coming as often.Service seems to go by faster if you order drinks and an appetizer. It's always busy.I've ordered out a few times if the wait would be long. But the food is worth it. The food quality is pretty consistent.
Paul D.,Santa Rosa  CA,54,227,127,12/10/2016,1.0,BJ has gone down hill. We are shocked. This is the fourth time in month of December 2016 that we have had lousy service. It took over 1 hour to receive our food . The waiter ordered the wrong item and forgot our kids food after bringing out our food 1 hr late. Wow management needs to start doing their job and getting new cooks. Their is no excuses for waiting over an hour for food and waiters screwing up.
Lisa H.,Laguna Niguel  CA,17,5,3,10/29/2017,5.0,I placed a take out order today for curbside pickup. I was greeted by a sweet young gentlemen named Alec. Alec was prompt  informative  proficient  and kind. My order came out faster than I expected. Piping hot and perfect. This was my second visit to this location and I highly recommend it. Great staff  fast service and great food.
Daisy A.,Santa Rosa  CA,35,3,3,10/1/2017,1.0,"My experience at this establishment was terrible. My friends ordered food at the same time I did and they were served and a half an hour later and still no food. They served their ""cooked"" vegetables raw and the wait staff is never anywhere to be seen. One manager was seen just sitting and eating at one of the bar tables and I\'d have to say it\'s one of the worst places to eat. I will not be going back."
Robin N.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,7,1,9/15/2017,1.0,Ordered a Black and Bleu burger online  under toppings I deselected tomato and added onion straws. I received a cheeseburger with grilled onions (which isn't even in the recipe)  no bacon (a main component)  a pound of onion strings and no side of fries. When my boyfriend called to let them know  the manager on shift argued with him and said he could have some fries if he was close. Uh  no. It took another 5 minutes before he said he'd offer a refund - but until we see it post  I suspect he doesn't plan on actually issuing it. I will never be back which is too bad. I used to enjoy dining on the patio.Update: spoke to the regional manager who apologized and offered reasonable compensation. Very professionally handled at the corporate level.
Christine W.,Sacramento  CA,58,3,1,9/13/2017,1.0,I tried this location twice and I will never go back. The food is just not good at all. I tried one of their burgers  they got my side wrong and by the time they brought the correct side out to me  I was done. The next time it was the ribs and they were dry and not tasty at all. Both times my companions were also not happy with their selection. And even though it was there screw up on the menu item I didn't receive a discount and it didn't seem to matter that they screwed up. My over all experience with service and staff and food was just the worst. I have eaten at other BJs before and I'm shocked and disappointed at what they have done here at this location. It's turned me off from going back to any location now.
Rachael Z.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,1,,10/24/2017,5.0,Tina was an awesome server! We came in late and she took super good care of us! I've had really bad service at BJs but not with Tina. Every time I come in I will be requesting her! Thank you for an awesome night!Also $3 pizookies are always awesome.
Paul P.,Rohnert Park  CA,29,142,1030,5/21/2016,1.0,Not happy with the food  to salty  and bad service.Will I come back  I don't think so.
Aliya H.,Sebastopol  CA,0,4,1,11/19/2017,1.0,I have always loved BJs until the other night when we had the worst service in history. When we were seated it took 15mins for our waitress to come talk to us. When we ordered drinks we waited 10mins for drinks. After our order was placed it took 45mins for our food to come out. We had calamari as an appetizer and it was chewing  cold and majorly greasy. After complaining and being told it would come off our bill they never removed it. Finally we got their attention and got it removed. After handing them my credit card it took another 15mins to get my card back to me after it was charged. We spent less time eating then waiting for our food or bill. Absolutely horrible experience and service.
Angelique S.,Santa Rosa  CA,12,2,,9/3/2017,1.0,Our family has been here many times  the service just gets worse and worse. Tonight the appetizer was cold and our drink refills kept getting forgotten. The waiter was walking around apologizing to other diners. After 45 minutes of not even ordering our entree I spoke with the management and left. Last time we were there we waited 40 minutes for our entrees and our salads came out just after the entrees. The food is usually good when it comes and the order is correct. We are greatly disappointed by this restaurant and we will not be coming back.
Armando C.,Sebastopol  CA,99,1,2,9/1/2017,1.0,I don't really do this review crap but for this particular spot I had to make an exception this was about my third time coming to BJ's and let me tell you I will never be back you can mark my words I went in with my girlfriend after getting off work around 839-ish we got there and we're seated fairly quickly took our drink orders and appetizers we ordered the calamari which wasn't the best but it was decent. For dinner I ordered the sirloin steak with a side which was a big potato and some asparagus now let me tell you I had a lot of steaks in my life for May variety of places a lot and let me tell you people this by far that this was by far the most horrible looking horrible tasting steak I have ever had in my life it was not only smaller than the baked potato but it was also very burnt on top and I asked for medium well and got a very cooked and very very dry I'm so sad about this place because this place fucking sucks I will never be back thank you BJ's for showing me you really suck thank you for nothing but show me that you really suck awful place please don't bother coming it's horrible!!!!!
Desi K.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,12,,11/21/2017,5.0,Food and service much improved since 3 months ago when I swore I would never eat there again. I ate there last night and I actually was shocked to learn that it was Gina's first night serving. She was so friendly and professional. She stayed on top of our table. That was a first for me at BJ's. The food order came out right and the quality was perfect. So I want to say that BJ's has definitely improved in more ways than one. I will return.
Jeff Y.,Fremont  CA,140,1,,5/28/2017,1.0,This place ia too slow  lazy bunch of cooker! How you overcook a ribeye? My dad had to suffer waiting half an hour and baked potato still not out come on and the second time they recooked it it tasted raw. What a shame! disappointment! Soup too overpowering! This place get a Negative 5 star and a big F!The sad part is half the place is empty too and it dinner! You dare charging us double just because of a freaking overcooked ribeye?No one should come here PERIOD!!!
Dana L.,Sebastopol  CA,23,177,12,6/15/2017,1.0,Run away! Awful experience here from beginning to end. Slow  unfriendly service. The place was mostly empty and the waiter could not keep up? When the food finally did come out  he got half of our groups orders wrong The food was not fresh  over-dressed  wilted salads & salad toppings that appeared and tasted like canned food. Not one of us  in a group of 6 people enjoyed the meal. When we got the bill we were actually charged for the wrong orders that we had returned to the kitchen! We had to spend an additional 10 minutes trying to flag down the waiter to get him to adjust the bill correctly. Ugh.... NEVER again.
Paul B.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,25,,10/1/2017,3.0,You never know what you are getting here. Sometimes decent   sometimes not so good. Seems like it always takes awhile to get food. Better options in town for standard bar food and beer.
Mara C.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,2,,5/3/2017,1.0,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with BJ's Customer Service. This past week and a half I've had two awful experiences with BJ's at the Coddingtown Mall  hence the 1 star.Two Fridays ago  my boyfriend and I went into the bar around 6:00pm. We each got a beer and ordered two appetizers--the lettuce wraps and chicken wings. The bar/restaurant was not busy with plenty of open tables. We waited 45 minutes for two appetizers... The server did not apologize or offer any kind of comp. I have worked in the restaurant industry and decided not to complain. The food came out warm and was yummy.The following Wednesday my company ordered BJ's catering for a meeting of 20 people. We had never used BJ's catering and decided to give it a whirl. When I went to pick it up  they had no record of our order. I waited for 40 minutes  then raced back to the office in order to set up lunch. When I opened the catered dishes  the amount of food was ridiculous for the price. For instance take the Barbacoa Chicken--half pan which is $45 and supposed to serve 5-10 people. There were TWO chicken breasts! $45 for 2 chicken breasts?? WTF?!I called and spoke to the GM. I told him about our experience and he apologized--but that was it. Legitimately  you pay $45 for 2 chicken breasts. WOW. We are a large company and have meals catered all the time. This could have been a great opportunity for BJ's to be one or our go to restaurants. Never again.
Richard R.,Zzyzx  CA,0,161,2,9/4/2017,1.0,What a bust. A wedge salad  no bigger than small side salad and luke warm pizza for $38. Fool me once...
Never B.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,2,1,5/31/2017,1.0,Second time my burger was undercooked. Took a small bite and noticed. Why do they send out underdone food? They simply don't care. This place is 2 and a half stars for a reason. Avoid at all costs.
Emily K.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,9,,11/18/2017,5.0,I honestly don't come here usually... Not my first choice of restaurants. But my loud  large  hungover family and I came in this morning  and our waitress Jordan did an awesome job taking care of us! Food was good  and she was super friendly and helpful.
Cindy C.,San Francisco  CA,0,15,,4/30/2017,1.0,If you're going to use a delivery service  at least give a sh*t about your customers who use it. I waited for more than two hours for food that arrived cold. The one dish that wasn't supposed to be hot was ... awful. It was supposed to be tuna poke. There was no seasoning to it. Flavorless. I totally get all the low ratings here. I can't even blame Food To You delivery for the delay; half these reviews talk about how long the food takes ... and that it comes out cold. I will absolutely tell anyone thinking of going here to skip it.
Osvaldo P.,Bodega Bay  CA,0,2,,10/9/2017,3.0,I don't understand how you can turn a great cut of meat and make it taste like beef jerky. I ordered the prime rib special on a busy Saturday night. Although I was expecting the cut of meat to come out overcooked (as this location has done in the past with burgers and steaks)  I never imagined it would have the consistency of a rubber pork chop. I found myself rushing through the meal because I just wanted to get through it. I didn't want to bother the waiter as everyone was extremely busy. The only two things that kept me from giving one star were the pizookie which never disappoints at any BJ's locations and the server. I can't remember his name  but he had star pins on his collar.
Robert K.,Santa Rosa  CA,36,1,1,7/12/2017,5.0,The food is pretty good but always late. Tonight we got our appetizer after the dinner was served. Once again the evening was saved by one of the servers named Gary Micheal. He has such a great sense of humor and really attentive. He made us feel important and welcome. He was able to save the evening by being caring and sincere. We will come back but I think we will call and make sure he is working. BJs need more just like him.
Derek C.,Santa Rosa  CA,586,176,74,10/25/2016,2.0,We waited almost an hour for our food... which was delicious... they comped nothing after acknowledging they screwed up... pretty lame.I heard they had gluten free options. They had like 2.
Matt P.,Penngrove  CA,96,1,,10/4/2017,5.0,I came to BJs tonight to fill my stomach with a juicy burger and a perfectly cooked Pazooki  left with a warm feeling in my stomach  not only from my delicious food but from the impeccable service from my server Justin. Justin did an amazing job and more than elevated my experience here and solely because of him  I intend to return.
Samantha B.,McKinleyville  CA,123,10,,10/4/2017,5.0,This is one of the best locations I have ever been to. Our server Justin was absolutely amazing and was very accommodating to out large party. Will definitely be returning back in the future!
Shawn F.,Santa Rosa  CA,18,5,3,8/23/2017,1.0,"I went to this restaurant with my parents and girlfriend for an early birthday dinner for my girlfriend. If I could give this restaurant negative stars I would in a heartbeat. This was probably my worst experience at any restaurant in my 23 years of life. We started off great with our waitress who seemed very sharp and on-top of everything; getting out drinks on time  and checking in on us. The issues began when we ordered and received our food. My girlfriend is allergic to cilantro and she looked at the selection of tacos on the menu and noticed the salmon tacos not listing cilantro as being one of the ingredients to them  whereas the other three taco items did list it. She received her tacos with tons of cilantro on it. So much that it was impossible to get all of it off. The waitress came back out five minutes later and we all told her that the salmon tacos doesn\'t have cilantro listed as an ingredient which she agreed and said that it shouldn\'t have been on the item in the first place. She took it back and said she\'ll make sure the item doesn\'t have any cilantro on the new batch. Sometime later she came back with the salmon tacos and it all looked fine  no cilantro in sight. I had to get to work  so my girlfriend and I left right after we got her item. Now  it is partially our fault for not checking every nook and cranny for cilantro  but just like the waitress said to begin with  cilantro should not be on these tacos in the first place. I got to work and saw a message from my girlfriend with some photos attached with what else but  you guessed it  cilantro. It\'s a good thing that she checked every section of the tacos or else she would have been in trouble. I\'ll attach the photos to the review  but what it looks like and from her description is that the cilantro was underneath everything else  sort of looking like they tried to hide it. The reason why I say ""hide it"" is because the last salmon tacos they had brought out had cilantro on top of everything else. I\'m not saying they did this intentionally  but when someone tells you they have an allergic reaction to a certain ingredient; you best not put that item on their order. What if she had not checked and taken a bite of it? That is just sickening that a big chain like BJ\'s would do this and I highly suggest you change your ways in how you manage your establishment in Santa Rosa  CA because you would think they would know better. Oh  and I\'m not done there. When I told my parents that cilantro was still on the tacos  they went back to talk to a manager. They spoke to the duty manager  Ali who honestly couldn\'t care less. I don\'t know if this was just an inexperienced manager or not  but something as serious as someone being allergic to an item and having the item still be on the food they ordered could be a serious lawsuit if that person ended up eating this food. I had hoped for a better response from a manager at a chain restaurant and I also hope the higher up manager and/or owner of the location in Santa Rosa  CA takes a look at this review because this could have been a VERY serious issue if someone consumed food they were allergic to without knowing. This isn\'t a ""not-so-serious"" issue like you guys getting my drink order wrong  instead it\'s something that could pose a threat to someone\'s life. Please get some quality control in your establishment BJ\'s because you can seriously injure someone if you continue your ways."
Amanda E.,Windsor  CA,37,24,5,5/14/2017,1.0,"I\'ve really tried to like BJ\'s but today was the last straw. I\'ve been charged for items that have never come to my table. Food has no flavor. Inattentive servers and hostesses. Have to ask for flatware and refills. Today my son wanted to go here for Mother\'s Day lunch. Hostess was too busy flipping her hair and flirting with a server to acknowledge when we walked in. We were seated all the way back in the corner  which was fine other than the fact we were next to an order input station so the servers kept huddling around there. My son\'s burger wasn\'t cooked right  he didn\'t care. He\'s a teenager  he eats just about anything. I asked for no jalapenos and my burger to be ""well done""...that translated to let\'s put jalapenos under the patty  on top of the patty and in the guacamole. My burger was also pretty rare. May have been medium rare. Definitely not well done! I tried to eat it  I really did but I couldn\'t. So here I am  I\'ve thrown up twice and my stomach still hurts. Happy Freaking Mother\'s Day. The one star is for the pazookies and the Mother\'s Day wine charm they gave me."
Dylan K.,Santa Rosa  CA,34,1,,10/4/2017,5.0,Came for pizookis  left with a wholesome experience. Our waiter Justin was very engaged and was prepared to serve us with is rainbow of pens at the ready.
Chris T.,Santa Rosa  CA,28,46,4,5/23/2017,5.0,I really love the atmosphere here. The food is decent chain food. Nothing special but consistent. The service is hit and miss. Justin the gay guy with the rainbow of pens in his apron is awesome as is Noah who brought our food out. I love all the sports and they have over 50 beers on tap. How could you go wrong? Beer and food make me happy.
Christine C.,San Francisco  CA,0,8,,3/23/2017,1.0,"I really wanted a burger. We were both off on a Thursday afternoon. We decided to drive to Santa Rosa to pick something up for the house and have a late lunch. Someone had recommended Jack\'s Urban Eats for a burger. They don\'t have burgers. So we went to BJ\'s. When we walked in there were a few people in there. The hostesses were busy with something between them but we were seated without issue. Our server arrived and did her job offering a variety of beverages. She brought the ice tea and it was sad. It was water with a hint of tea. It was just standard tea  not one of the fruit ones. We did try one of the others and it was equally bland. Eh  not a big deal  just disappointing. The salad came out and we made a mistake in not inspecting the cutlery when we unwrapped them. Imagine our surprise/disgust when you take a bite of your salad and find some glob of brown  stuck on goo on your fork. The fork that was in your food... and in your mouth.Set the fork aside and wait for our server. She walks up and we start to ask for a new fork. Without missing a step or stopping to acknowledge what was being said  she grabs the fork and continues to walk away. We never even finished ""could we please have..."" Ok.... in the mean time  someone else brings our food. She comes back and takes the salad bowl and asks if we need anything during her flyby. We asked for no avocado because of an allergy. When we asked for it  we paused and waited for acknowledgement because it\'s important. Not to be difficult. At this point  not really surprised to find avocado in the food. We want to believe that maybe it\'s just an oversight as it\'s been communicated to several people that avocado is not wanted. So we put it on a napkin and set it aside. ""Would you like more tea?"" Sure! I think I\'m behind on my water consumption for the day. Surprisingly  the refill on the tea is dark. Completely changes the color of a glass that was still over half full. Dark  actual tea. No comment on the watery glass brought originally. ""Did you get your salad?"" I guess she didn\'t remember bringing or removing it from our table. We just want to leave. The avocado is removed with comment. The Burger was good. The experience was awful. ""Do you want dessert?"" No. Please. This was 2 hours past lunch rush. Our section was pretty empty. We paid our bill plus 15%. It was a beautiful day during the week. We left feeling dejected. Thankfully a side trip afterwards restored our appreciation of the day and our happiness."
Rachelle S.,Santa Rosa  CA,35,137,1032,5/19/2017,2.0,There aren't many places in Santa Rosa for late night food  but thankfully BJs serves their full menu until midnight....and they offer a full bar on top of the many beers on tap. Their specialty is pizza- it's not fantastic but the menu is quite large and there should be something on it to accommodate anyone  even those of us who require gluten free items. Huge restaurant  good for kids and large groups. Happy hour pricing while games are on their huge televisions make it a pretty popular place to view sporting events.
Rich B.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,6,,3/10/2017,1.0,Currently sitting waiting for my son's dessert which will finally end the terrible experience. First off our waitress was great. She was attentive and did her best when her staff was not pulling their weight. We ordered an appetizer then about 5 minutes later put in our dinner order. About 20 minutes later our dinners came and no appetizer. We asked to just take it off the bill but she gave it to us for free anyway. My burger had obviously been sitting as it had lost its warmth by bite number 3. The shredded cheese wasnt even melted on top and made the whole thing just awful. On the plus side the fries were good. This is just an awful experience and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone even if they just want a quick because this place is anything but quick.
Roger Y.,Martinez  CA,150,12,23,11/10/2017,1.0,We got seated fairly fast and the staff is very friendly. It seems the back of the House has issues. It is a three day weekend but a corporate restaurant like this should be able to handle the volume. Why one stars? Two out of three orders were wrong but with the long wait for two prime rib sandwiches and a burger with no bun. Everything on the side. Only the patty came and it was the size of a fifty cent piece. When the sides came my friend was already done with his tiny burger patty. No bun is not a crazy request. The two prime dip sandwiches came with a teaspoon of au jus each. We asked for more and while writing still has not arrived. Come on BJ's! Our poor server. Had to make excuses for the kitchen and management. They never came over. Never brought au jus. More au jus please! I hate writing negative reviews but... my green beans never came. The fries in the photo are supposed to be green beans. We got over charged for a baked potato that never came. They knocked off $10. But we were over charged.
Ali W.,Sebastopol  CA,55,4,1,11/10/2017,1.0,"I just used the online ordering feature and was disappointed that I couldn\'t pay online. When I called the restaurant to ask if I could pay over the phone so my friend didn\'t have to when they picked up the food  I was told I could pay for the order in person or online (but it never gave me the online option). When I told the person that on the phone  he was going to put me through to the manager. He then forgot to get the manager for me and i had to wait on hold even longer. When he picked back up  he told me they didn\'t know what to do and I had to pay on pickup still. I told him that was kind of crappy since he said I could pay online and I couldn\'t  and he replied ""well.. have a nice night  we\'ll see you soon"". I never got to speak to the manager when I asked to and I will not be ordering through the online portion or returning to BJ\'s again. That was incredibly rude customer service."
Jim S.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,7,,11/10/2017,5.0,Better than the food is the service. Allison is wonderful and accommodating. Chrissy is a super libation engineer  and Sean tries. Thanks for the great football seasons.
Varshana C.,Occidental  CA,83,122,91,9/16/2016,4.0,I love this location! They have a great little patio with heat lamps above that keep you nice and toasty when having a evening dinner outside.The bar area is seat yourself and it is usually easy to find a high top during their rush on a Friday night. They obviously have a large selection of beers on tap and there is always something to choose from their list of speciality drinks. It is a chain restaurant though and with that comes a large menus and a hard choice. There is too much to choose from and it can cause a problem. It takes a while for food to come out when they are slammed but their staff usually acknowledges it and keeps you updated. I have had pretty good experiences here with servers. They all seem happy and like treat their customers right. I am a sucker for the twisted BLT salad.. I think that's what it's called. It's delicious and goes fabulous when you are just getting a quick drink after dinner since it is not a large size. I recently started to order on the mobile app and pick up lunch here and that works quite well too.
Cindy I.,Hidden Valley Lake  CA,18,16,2,11/5/2017,5.0,I don't know where the people who rated this restaurant one star truly ate but it wasn't here. I've always had great service. Today Kristin took care of us. She was very attentive and professional. We even complimented her to the Manager on Duty. Food was also wonderful. Don't pay attention to the social media Trolls.
Bianca M.,Rohnert Park  CA,48,131,,8/16/2017,4.0,I have been to Bjs only 3x maybe 4. Its nice for a nice dinner with family. Its on the $$ side but probably not much more than places like Black Bear if you want to keep it down. The pazookies are great and easy to share. My son had a birthday dinner here and they put a candle in the pazookie for him. The food was good. Theres TVs around showing sports but theres enough room a person not wanting to watch would feel infringed upon. Seating is comfy. Wait staff was nice. Service was fairly quick. I ordered a cobb salad w/o meat and it was served wirth pieces of bacon (looking like itd been put on mistakenly then attempted to be removed unsuccessfully) When I mentioned it to the waitress she nicely asked if I wanted it redone. I felt bad but I really didnt want bacon flavored salad (being a vegetarian & all) and she didnt make me feel bad. The new salad was ready very quickly too (and bacon free  I checked)
Quionauh Q.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,1,,9/20/2017,5.0,They're pasta arrives nice and hot! I love their spaghetti and meatballs. Lemonade still manages to have ice in it  not watered down. The employees are super friendly and they make sure to keep your food nice and warm on the way to your house!
Shayna O.,Rohnert Park  CA,46,47,10,3/14/2017,3.0,"I\'ve been here many times and the service has always been decent. However  every time I\'ve visited  it\'s been a busy night. The longest we\'ve had to wait for a table was 20 min. Decent. I\'ve never had a bad experience here. The food has always been pretty good  but a bit pricey for what you get. I must give props to a restaurant for being honest when they say they serve ""Kraft Macaroni and Cheese"" on the kid\'s menu. I like their calamari and California flatbread pizza. My husband has enjoyed the jambalaya once before. Our most recent visit  about a week ago (I checked in with my tasty sangria) it was not bad  but also not as good as we\'ve experienced. Yes  the wait for food was a while  but it was a Saturday night. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger  medium  but it was way over done. Definitely not medium  but I didn\'t complain. Our order was served hot and ready to eat. Husband says the jambalaya was VERY salty this time around. Child enjoyed her mac & cheese. Really can\'t complain  much. We did notice that the floor was rather greasy throughout the restaurant. The bathroom was a tad messy  and there seemed to be a lot of staff roaming/standing around. I\'m sure we\'ll be back in the future  as we have yet to have a bad experience like most of the reviews here."
Ryan D.,Mill Valley  CA,0,7,,3/24/2017,1.0,WORST SERVICE IN SONOMA COUNTY!Went last night to celebrate my birthday. It took 30 mins for our app  Delivered only half our drinks We waited 1.5 hours for our dinner  They both were prepared wrong  and they never delivered my birthday pazokie which we ordered.However  the manager took off the app. WhooppeThe management sucks at their job. As we waited  we watched many other workers stand around talking and joking around. Including the manager. While the kitchen  other staff were struggling to make it all happen. Having worked in the industry for many years  I see the lack of leadership and team work the staff needs.We were polite and made light of it  we were trying to celebrate. But when everything is screwed up  it doesn't help us enjoy the moment.Go have a KILLER burger or another dish at the Whole foods tap room instead. Its much better.
Chuck C.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,7,,10/27/2017,2.0,The food was good and the beer was very good. The service could have been better. With one exception we were ignored by every employee in the restaurant. The exception was the manager. She showed us to our table when no one else would. When she realized we hadn't been waited on after several minutes  she took our order. She was even our busboy (the were too busy watching the ball game on the TV monitors). The only other person who came to our table was somebody who presented us with our bill instead of our dessert.
Taylor G.,Petaluma  CA,0,10,1,7/25/2017,3.0,"Used to go here all the time and loved it. However  my most recent experiences haven\'t been too swell. The first time my friends and I came in at 10:30 PM to get some appetizers and dessert and drinks before we went out (they closed at midnight). The server and chef literally only had three tables in the whole restaurant  and people at the bar. It took 35 minutes to get our food (which was all appetizers) and a lot of it was cold... And they forgot a whole dish we ordered (mine). I would have loved to tell the server when he came back but he never did! Within 20 minutes  my friends were done eating and he brought the check by  so I never even got a chance to tell him they forgot my food. I asked him wait a sec  I looked at the check  and said ""I never got my food so can you please take it off the check"" and he said ""yeah  no problem"" without apologizing. Normally I would be super understanding if they were busy but they weren\'t busy at all. I still give it three stars because they have great salads and pizookies. But lately I\'ve been getting cold food  and not so great service."
Alex C.,Oakland  CA,0,7,,7/24/2017,3.0,Very large menu and a full bar. Staff is pretty friendly. However 9 times out of 10 they mess up the order  like several problems. Rare steak comes as well done  they forget our sides  they burn the toast  etc. The management is super helpful in fixing everything but it's super annoying that we always know there is going to be a problem.
Samantha R.,Santa Rosa  CA,52,135,35,2/8/2017,3.0,It's a chain restaurant  nothing really special about it. Service tends to be slow  and it can get pretty packed. Foods ok  but nothing really stands out.
Adam S.,Healdsburg  CA,0,1,,9/9/2017,5.0,This is a great restaurant for the whole family. The pizza is awesome and they have lots of stuff for kids. We asked them about their cookie desert and they comped us 3 minis for us to try. Their GM was amazing and even gave us one of our kids meals for free. Plus they have a full bar and good beer. Will definitely go again. Go restaurant for casual dining. Even in wine country. Will definitely go again
Steve S.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,15,,11/1/2017,5.0,Jourdan our server was very good! She is very friendly and the food was superb.
Danielle B.,Rohnert Park  CA,190,1,,8/29/2017,5.0,Josh is the best server you guys have ever had. He went above and beyond to make sure I got marshmallows on my dessert. That's all! 11/10
Ashton K.,Petaluma  CA,55,9,4,4/21/2017,5.0,First off... we came here with 4 men who have been drinking lol so they were hungry !!!!! Tiffani was the most amazing Sever we've had here EVER!!!! We got everything fast and tasted amazing! Great customer service !!!! We will be coming back to see her !!!! Thank you!!!
Sarah B.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,3,,8/27/2017,3.0,I loved coming to BJ's for the pulled pork sandwich. It was really delicious. And the shoe string fries where my favorite. Well my girlfriend and I rolled in today after coming back from the coast  sat down knowing what we were all ready going to get. Well  they changed the gluten free menu and they changed the pulled pork sandwich. When the food came out  my girlfriends salad was really good for her and it looked so much better then my whimpy sandwich. I'm gonna get picky. Pulled pork should be pulled Pork not lumpy  chunky  and hard to chew pulled pork. I was disappointed that it wasn't the same sandwich or anything really at all. The regular French fries were better then the damn sandwich. Anyways fair be warned. I hope they change the recipe back. For reals.
Jason S.,Santa Rosa  CA,17,269,2,12/24/2016,1.0,"Very slow service and way over priced. Ordered 10 mins ago still no food. Our party was only 2 people. It wasn\'t even that busy. 20 bucks for a 6"" pizza? No I\'ll go to round table. Food was okay.Will not come back. After we got our food never saw the waiter again."
Kelly C.,Forestville  CA,3,6,1,6/26/2017,1.0,Just had my last meal at BJ's. my wife and I ordered a deep dish pizza that turned out to be a regular pizza in a deep dish pan. Our server was totally lost  he messed up every table around us. I cannot see myself going back and giving them any more of my money.
Courtney B.,Petaluma  CA,76,1,,8/26/2017,5.0,For the first time since this BJ's opened our waiter Sean B. Was the best most attentive one we have had yet. We told his manager Jake and gave him the credit he deserved. We ordered a pizza and pazooki's and the service was fast for a friday night
Christine V.,Pomona  CA,153,37,41,9/30/2017,2.0,Took my family here to celebrate a birthday. The interior looks like a typical BJs and it looked clean. Didn't seem like a busy day  but the kitchen speed was very slow. After ordering food  it seemed to take years to get the food. There was a mistake by the waitress who took the order  but she was very good about switching and remedying the problem  so A+ for her. I also feel like they made her manage too many tables. She was really attentive to us  but then she was gone for a long long time taking care of other tables. So the food came out in several batches because we were a large table  but the quality was off. For example  the first plates of fries was really good  but the second batch didn't taste as good. They looked the same  but it seems it wasn't fried or seasoned as well. Avocado egg rolls was alright. Nothing special  I've had better elsewhere. Someone ordered the country fried steak and said it was very yummy and crispy. In terms of BJs as a chain  I've definitely had better consistency and quality of food at other places.
Rebecca F.,Sebastopol  CA,17,7,,10/20/2017,5.0,so we take our office staff out to lunch frequently for office meetings and have been to bj's a number of times. The food is good; they have a huge selection and service is good too--yesterday we did have a problem in that two of the meals didn't come when everyone else was served lunch...we waited 15 minutes and I finally had to complain as we we didn't have all day....the waiter was flustered and apologized that they got slammed busy. Big kudos to the manager who comped our meal  apologized  and asked if our homes had survived the fires. We appreciated his taking our complaint seriously and making it better. Because of that  we will be loyal customers over and over again
Jennifer S.,Santa Rosa  CA,60,2,,10/6/2017,1.0,Every time I come here there's always some kind of issue. Our food is slow or there's always a person singled out with no food. The drinks are so slow your food can come first before your first drink. It's always so sorry and you can tell the waiter is use to this disoriented mess. They really never compensate for anything.
Kevin W.,Santa Rosa  CA,31,1,,10/21/2017,5.0,I was at the bar and Justin was really cool and easy to talk to! Definitely recommend for those that want to drink and chill :)
Theo P.,San Mateo  CA,1,22,49,6/22/2017,3.0,The food was good. My order was screwed up but I did not send the meal back. The waiter was a little slow on filling my drink. I would recommend this BJ's.
Mara B.,Santa Rosa  CA,59,79,12,7/10/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I was a bit dubious about coming here  due to negative Yelp reviews. However  my 30+ daughter had liked it  so we went there to complete our girly day after mani-pedi's.  We were quite happy with our meals - delicious! Our server was a bit new at the task  but acquitted herself just fine.   Introduced ourselves to the manager  and he seemed like an OK guy.
Christina M.,Santa Rosa  CA,352,176,1982,10/15/2016,3.0,"Not so impressed with BJ""s as I used to be . The food can be a great value more bang for your buck! Customer Service  long wait times and lack of visual management seem to be the top three areas of concern I observed on my last visit . Tables were unbussed for very long periods of time with customers waiting in the lobby yet 3 young people were hosting the from lobby ! I would\'ve given more stars that after ordering nachos that just came with a sprinkling of cheese some chopped tomatoes something that seemed like leftover chili on the bottom and they were kind of dry and not that tasteful that definitely made them lose half a star  The other loss was the side of avocado they bought out to go on top of the nachos as we were told it came with it that was brown rotten and unappealing we left it on the side of our table nobody took it away finally I had to ask the waitress if she would remove it and asked why would you serve that  it\'s rotten she said one word - yes!  She proceeded to take away the dish but never bought us back any avocado how strange. We finished our appetizer mostly with her fingers after all it was a nachos but no napkins or silverware which we ended up asking the server for.The music was super loud the restaurant was packed we couldn\'t even hear them calling out the names and the front lobby and they never made an effort to walk out from behind the podium to make sure people heard them  even though three people were in the hosts area upfront.The visit we had before this one was equally as an impressive with food coming out at random times  the wrong items coming out  then forgetting that I was a BJ rewards member  and both visits neither one of the service thanked us for our visit asked us to come back and was absent of any customer service. So far far they are two for two strikes may give them my more opportunity to redeem themselves before I consider spending my money elsewhere. And some of my friends and coworkers and family like to go here for happy hour or occasional dinner so if I get invited I guess that would be the only reason I really want to go back to this particular location."
Ricky D.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,18,3,1/20/2017,5.0,I have always had an incredible experience at BJ's in Santa Rosa. Often my go to restaurant for a quick bite  the menu offers a huge array of items from salads  to burgers  to tasty seafood plates! There have been a few situations where I feel it takes a substantial amount of time for food to arrive or to get a drink topped off. The price of the food is perfect for a little date in the middle of the week. Definitely take advantage of the lunch specials  as my favorite is the all you can eat soup and salad for $8. Very tasty and you can refill with a different offering every time!
Kate B.,San Diego  CA,0,1,,10/4/2017,5.0,Had amazing costumer service thanks to our waiter Justin! Great smile and very on top of refills and checking back on us! Definitely would come back great food!
Avory G.,Elk Grove  CA,0,6,,10/3/2017,2.0,my friends and I were not satisfied from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. as soon as we walked in we waited at the front desk for almost 10 mins before a worker acknowledged us. (mind you  it's a tuesday night and the place is pretty empty) we were finally seated and my friends didn't know what they wanted so the waitress gave us a bit more time. she seemed pretty annoyed and we finally ordered our good. when my food came out  all of my chips for dip was all small and broken as if it was the very end of their chip bag. the pieces were so small and broken that i had to use a spoon to eat my chips and dip. i also ordered calamari and it was very stale and hard and all of the breading was on the plate instead of the calamari. i ended up sending it back. for how pricey the food is  the service and the quality of the food should be better. we probably won't come back.
Micah R.,Santa Rosa  CA,106,14,1,10/8/2016,1.0,So frustrating. I ordered online (5:13pm) through Grubhub and it said it would be about 2 hours for delivery. I didn't see this as a problem as I've ordered through Grubhub before  it's a Saturday night  and I used to work in the restaurant industry so I knew they would be busy. About an hour and a half after I placed my order I get a call from the delivery person saying BJ's was busy but he would have my order to me around 7:15-7:30  also not a problem (and A+ for communication). Around 7:05pm  almost 2 hours after my order was placed  I get a call from FoodToYou about my Grubhub order. They said BJ's just called to let me know that one of the items I ordered was no longer on the menu. I pick a different item. Needless to say I am frustrated by this situation. It's now almost 8pm and my food isn't here. I'm assuming it's because BJ's waited 2 hours AFTER my order was placed to call and figure out if I wanted a replacement. Maybe don't offer extra services like delivery orders at your establishment when you can't even handle in-house business (which is clear from other reviews before me)? I would really appreciate a refund.*follow-up* food arrived at 8:15pm  3 hours after I ordered it (clearly not Grubhub's fault). Shrimp tacos had 3 shrimp between 2 tacos. Also  it is clear my whole order was made before they called about the item I ordered that they no longer had.
Jessica S.,Becker  MN,73,12,6,5/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,The food here was amazing! However  we were literally the only people in the restaurant and food took forever. The staff was nice when they actually came to the table. The place was very clean and nice though.
Michael C.,Santa Rosa  CA,5,1,1,1/17/2017,5.0,What a great place. I had the Black and blue burger and it was a true taste bud tickler . WOW
Anonimo A.,Sonoma  CA,0,9,9,9/29/2016,1.0,SUPER SLOW SERVICE  FROM START TO FINISH. It took them 20 min to bring our drinks and 35 min for soup and salad to make it to our table. Server was not knowledgeable of the menu  we will be definitely NOT coming back here at all. I would give it 0 stars if I could
Rae G.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,3,1,3/31/2017,2.0,Been here multiple times. Service is usually fine. Food is OK. Today our server was so rude and I ordered the buffalo wings and this is how they came out...
Amanda M.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,82,30,5/28/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,We come here for their beer dinners and always enjoy them. We use to love the food here and were always here eating  But it everything about it has gotten worse and worse over the years. Half the time the food has made me incredibly sick and I have complained numerous times about it and contacted Bj's about it  They just don't seem to care. Their food is never consistently made with the same ingredients and the service is hit or miss. We went in and sat in the bar area and waited 20 minutes to be acknowledged  It was not even busy and was mostly empty in that area. Our waitress was pleasant enough  But we ordered a pizza  a salad and my husband ordered a steak  the pizza never came out. Someone came out to talk to us about it (which we weren't in a hurry to have it any way) And apologized And said it didn't come out to his liking. We were there for for about an hour and a half total and never did receive our pizza. We just asked the waitress to box it up for us  which she did. She saw that our daughter was fussing and still took her time to get us our check or anything else. When we received our check we were peeved to see the pizza on there for $23 and no discount or anything. We did not receive our food  I would have hoped that it would have been taken off or discounted without us asking. When we mentioned it she went to ask a manager and they took $10 off. The only reason we went there is because we had a gift card  We use to love Bj's  but it is way over priced  the food is never consistent and half the time it makes you sick. The service is usually terrible as well  we really want to love this place And have given it tons of chances only to have it fall through.
Jennifer S.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,14,7,10/18/2016,1.0,I just ordered a delivery from here and ordered a Cesar Salad for $11 right. I received a ice berg lettuce with crutons. No Romain lettuce or cheese  just lame. I've been to other really low quality restaurants that serve a Cesar salad right. Come on BJ'S you should be ashamed of yourself. Plus the rest of my $45 order was just ok. All I can say is none of it was worth $45!
Dan J.,San Francisco  CA,10,34,1,3/24/2017,2.0,The food was fair. Not amazing but fine. The kitchen was exceptionally slow. Two meals for our table  yet they came out almost 15 minutes apart. The restaurant was not at all busy  as we visited late at night  but the experience seemed to drag on forever and every step took so  so long. Plan extra time if you'd like to try this place.
Jay C.,Amador City  CA,0,1,,9/28/2017,5.0,Ordered. My usual the prime rib dip with bery soecific modifications. Alex thr curbside server nailed it. He even called me to let me know my order was ready  watched me pull in and was at my car within seconds. Superb service from server ALEC*****10 stars. Ps. Their prine rib dip is excellent. Thank you for excellent service!!!
Tony H.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,8,,3/22/2017,1.0,Really going down hillLunch on a Tuesday. Not super crowdedRan out of lemonade. Food took 40 minutes. Waitress apparently was shy as we didn't see her that often... though she did come by to say she was sorry  didn't know what was happening  except that they didn't have enough people working....  and when food got there... the order was wrong.. close mind you; but wrong.
Liva P.,San Diego  CA,6,3,,6/8/2017,3.0,"I was a bit disappointed this time around. Although the waitress (Rebecca) - had to ask for the name) was nice  she was very forgetful. The steak wasn\'t even average and not cooked how is asked. I ordered some prosecco... It was brought to me with a glass  the bottle not opened. I felt like that was saying "" here  open it"". The artichoke dip wasn\'t hot when it came to my tablet."
Dan W.,Denver  CO,23,92,60,3/7/2016,3.0,BJ's is a middle-of-the-road establishment. I wasn't so overwhelmed that I must come back  but I wasn't disappointed either. You know you will get a solid food selection for a decent price. I had the Ahi tuna salad and it didn't disappoint. The Sriracha brussels sprouts were great. Our server was friendly and refilled the drinks before they hit the bottom  which is always a plus.The experience wasn't the same for everyone to my party. My wife ordered the chicken lettuce wraps  and noted that they weren't very good compared to previous visits. Maybe a fluke? Lastly  their deep deep-fried skills need some work as my kids chicken tenders  mini corndogs  and french fries were a bit overcooked/burnt. Luckily  they drowned them all and ketchup and were satisfied enough.Again  BJ's is the middle-of-the-road place. You know what you'll get  which is nice  but you won't be overly impressed on my opinion. Solid choice for a family outing. I'd give 3 1/2 stars if I could.
Pattie H.,Forestville  CA,8,1,,3/1/2017,1.0,So many bad things to say  just going to list them:It took 20 minutes for anyone to take our order.Received the drinks we ordered; the Diet Dr Pepper was flat and flavorless and the water tasted like it was right out of the tap.The Brussels Sprouts appetizer arrived looking liked someone had tried unsuccessfully to drizzle the sauce on but maybe the device broke and spewed the sauce all over in messy disgusting blobs. They were also served without the usual accompanying small plates which we had to ask for repeatedly from several servers. They finally arrived 10 minutes later.We had asked for a replacement napkin when it fell on the floor and a new fork but after asking several servers in a row we finally received them after 20 minutes.The Jambalaya arrived looking like it had been under the heat lamp for an extraordinarily long amount of time and was flat and old looking; it also had very little meat.The Clam Chowder in a sourdough bowl was very foul (I nearly vomited it up at home!) and the bread bowl was so tough you couldn't tear it off or even cut it with a knife.The silverware was seemingly old and weird  everything kept sticking to it and wouldn't even wipe off with a napkin; the knives were a dull joke.The waitress brought the bill after waiting one whole hour and when she dropped off the bill she asked us for the first time if we were interested in having our drinks refilled!!!
Rena V.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,1,,7/7/2017,2.0,I think all the employees here should learn to have more humor or sense of empathy for their customer....my family walked in and i ask a question to a man and I'm aware he isn't a server maybe a host and felt like he was pretty mean...
Michael B.,Vacaville  CA,95,124,6,10/4/2016,2.0,My wife and I are here tonight. Our server was great  but the food - not so much. We both ordered burgers - guacamole one for her and hickory BBQ for me. We both asked that they be done medium. Both came VERY well done. So well done that both burgers were burned enough in one side that we could both taste the charcoal!We like the chain  but likely won't be back to this location again.  Had it not been for the service  this visit would have been a solid 1 star.
Hilton A.,Napa  CA,0,14,,4/10/2017,3.0,"Went there over the weekend. Hadn\'t been in for a while. Bit disappointing. Portions are smaller  and they don\'t serve their delicious wedge fries anymore. They went to regular fries. They try to call the new fries ""steak fries""  but they aren\'t. Too bad...."
Manuel M.,San Leandro  CA,55,28,24,3/25/2017,1.0,We ordered 3 drinks. 1 strawberry Virginia Margherita  1 Reg strawberry Margherita  and 1 Top Shelf Margherita. The total was $30. Way too expensive and way to watered down. Not worth it! Very disappointed! Don't go for drinks at BJ'S!
Kirstie C.,Petaluma  CA,44,38,,11/26/2016,2.0,The service was okay- no napkins no utensils and our food arrived warm and the prices and quality are not comparable . The grilled cheese sandwich for kids had terrible rubbery cheese and my salad metric was a tad old and the I feel like calamari has gone down hill or more like something you heat up. A nearby waitress waited on her patrons and I picked up a bit impatient attitude. The hostesses that night 11/25 around 5pm were busy chatting to not greet us when we walked in until she turned around through direction of a waiter. The alcoholic beverage I had (sangria ) was pretty good. My husband liked his pizza but said he would have rather bought WalMarts take and bake We unfortunately do not plan to go back
Helen G.,Petaluma  CA,27,187,173,5/11/2017,5.0,We came in tonight and haven't been here since they opened so I was about excited to see the menu! Justin was our server ! By far  he is the best server we have ever had! Hands down! He was sweet  attentive and extremely helpful with the menu and seemed to truly love his job! Very accommodating ! Pedro the manager is also an amazing human being! Extremely professional and was on the floor making sure everyone was happy and the employees were doing exactly what they were supposed to be doing! What I loved the most about Pedro  he's ok with getting his hands dirty! No micro managing here! Come see Justin and I assure you  you will have an amazing experience! Especially if you little ones!!!!
Margo C.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,6,,12/20/2016,1.0,Everytime I go to BJs  the service and wait time becomes worse and worse. We were a party of two on a TUESDAY night  and told it would take us 15-20 min to seat us  which was fine. We waited over 25 min  and 2 parties who came after us were seated first. Then we waited an additional 10-15 min for our server. He took the order for the two tables that came after us first  and didn't acknowledge until we decided to leave.We're not intimidating  slum  or anything of the sort. I used to be a waitress myself  always carried a smile  worked my ass off  and gave guests my undivided attention. Everyone was special  and I'd always check back every 10-15 min. The standards of this place are HORRIBLE! Granted  your stay depends on the server-- I've only had one good experience here. Either get more servers  or take action on the employees who call out frequently  and chit chat with co-workers when it's busy!!
Mada Z.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,9,,5/25/2017,1.0,Waitress apologized 3 times for how long the food was taking. Food was room temperature and the steak was over cooked.
Keylee P.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,7,,3/25/2017,2.0,Wish i could rate higher but they dont deserve it. I've gave this resturants multiple tries and the only food that seems to please me is the pozokie and avoacado eggrolls. I went here to celebrate my graduation. I order a deep dish pizza and there was barely any sauce and the dough wasnt cooked. The most recent time i went here i told myself i would only get a pozokie  i didnt. I got chicken strips and french fries and they were cold. I regret not sticking to my word. I recommend getting the oreo pozokie or regular chocolate chip.
Chris F.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,1,,6/10/2017,1.0,Don't order the ribs it took over an hour and they were dry as beef jerky .. we did not eat it and they still charged us.
Caelyn M.,Petaluma  CA,0,5,,8/24/2017,2.0,Decided to go to BJS  it's open super late and normally the food is between ok and really good. Food was undercooked. We asked for waters upon sitting down  didn't get them. Manager stopped by our table probably because I looked unhappy because I was starving. We asked the manager for two waters  got one. Service was super slow  which it normally is but we keep returning because the food is pretty good. We order a pazookie Togo and she gave us the wrong one. So now I'm home bitter and pazookie- less
Kris R.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,8,,1/20/2017,1.0,This place is just getting worse every time I come back. The staff always seem like it's there first day working there. Slow to be seated and finally got waiter to take my order. I did order a glass of wine also and nothing. I waited for a 1/2 hour and finally just left. This is the last time I will go. I will not give them another chance.
Claire P.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,7,,9/5/2017,4.0,This restaurant is great  yes. The food is similar to Applebee's. Some of the more simple items you can tell are the frozen/reheated type  some are more tasty and fresh. A huge pro to this restaurant is they have a large variety of foods on the menu. They also list the calories which is nice. The pricing is decent and the inside is beautiful. My only complaint is the waiting staff and their timing. It seems that every single time I come  no matter my waiter/waitress  they cannot have my appetizer/meal come at a time that is appropriate. Either they forget my appetizer entirely  or it comes AFTER I receive my main meal. This is a minor issue but when it happens again and again  it's a real bummer and makes me question what's going on in there that makes it so damn impossible for a single waiter to get it even semi correct. The last time I went was most likely my last.
Keila C.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,1,2,3/5/2017,1.0,Not even worth a star. Thought maybe Bj's in Santa Rosa would be the same as the one in Terra Linda. Wrong. Terrible food. Its my third time coming here  thought maybe this time food would be better but got disappointed once again. Ordered an appetizer and the lady didn't even bring plates for each one of us in the table. Once the food comes  my boyfriend's brisket burger was cold and the cheese wasn't even well cooked  I ordered a side of original bone in wings and they were dry af and cold. Totally gross  the celery coming on the side was dried and seemed old didn't even seem washed. Just to top it all up  we waited for so long. Nothing wrong with the customer service but management over here sucks and people at the kitchen don't know how to serve food according to their freaking expensive prices. Plus bathrooms are gross. And the mustard bottle is disgusting.
Jessica M.,San Diego  CA,0,6,,8/16/2017,1.0,I've given this restaurant multiple chances  and this was definitely the last one. The food took forty five minutes to come out  was cold  and- to be frank- pretty gross. They changed our waiter three times during our meal and each one was very obviously untrained and unfriendly. We ordered ice cream for dessert  which they decided to bring immediately after bringing the entree  and they were melted. My silverware and glass was not clean  and I had to remind them three times to bring me new ones. I will definitely NOT be coming back and I highly recommend that potential diners STAY AWAY
Josh M.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,3,,1/1/2017,1.0,This place has good food but what a f@!king joke this place is.30+ min to get my cold/burnt calamari  45 min to get half my dinner +8 min to bring the rest of my dinner. This place is rolling down hill with no f@!ks given by any employee or management if that have any at all. Don't wast you time or money here.
Jess K.,Rohnert Park  CA,7,11,,12/28/2016,1.0,We watched 5 tables who had been seated after us  receive their food  eat  pay and leave before us. When we received our appetizer (from a bus boy  not our waitress) we were not given silverware and despite our efforts to get someone's attention  we just ate with our hands. On top of that  the appetizer was clearly not fresh or what we ordered! There were two avocado egg rolls on the plate but all the others were filled with some sort of mystery meat like filling. It didn't taste right and looked as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp for way too long. As we watched other people eating and leaving  we were unattended to for nearly 1 hour. When another bus boy finally brought our meals  we still had no silverware and had to ask. When we opened up the silverware  it was dirty and we had to flag down someone else for a clean set. Then we noticed that they had neglected to bring out my husbands baked potato. We had to flag the waitress again who went and retrieved it but by that time  he had already finished his meal. He decided to eat it anyway but with the first bite he found it was still hard in the middle! Not even cooked! We sat there  for nearly 30 MORE minutes waiting to be acknowledged but that never happened. Our waitress looked as if she was tending to 3-4 too many tables at once. She was running frantically around all over the restaurant and into the kitchen. There were dozens of empty tables and people were waiting 10+ minutes to be seated. Not sure if their staffing wasn't up to par or what. What a joke!! When she finally came back we expressed our concerns  mostly about the kitchen  and she told us that she was sorry and that it's been bad for about 2 months. So 1.5 hours later we are finally leaving and reluctantly paying for poor quality food and a terrible experience. Defiantly won't be coming back! You need some serious improvement when it comes to management!2 days later and still no response from management about my experience. Spend your money elsewhere because this restaurant certainly doesn't care about its customers or their experiences.
ken b.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,11,,4/30/2017,5.0,Wow. Just had lunch at BJs. Somehow our order was delayed and the server first came out and apologized... we thought that was cool cuz weHadn't really noticed but then the manager came to our table to personally apologize for the long wait.. and then comped our meal ...and yet we hadn't even complained! That is exemplary service and we'll be back! Our server was Matthew S. great job!
Nadia P.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,8,8,12/19/2016,1.0,Waited over an hour for fish tacos . Not even many people In the place!! Will never be back. Terrible service and food. Don't mind waiting if it's busy but it was a joke! Only had fish tacos of the lunch menu. Awful !!
Hanna B.,Santa Rosa  CA,54,3,,1/16/2017,1.0,Me and my bf were supposed to go here gor our 2 yr anniversary. He made a reservation 2 days prior  yet when we got there his name wasnt in the computer. The person on the phone wasnt professional and was rude. And the person seating people didnt even seem to care that a reservation was supposed to be made. Not the way to run a business. Definitely wont be going here again!
Cami S.,Cazadero  CA,43,6,1,11/14/2016,1.0,"OkSo yesterday after a long week my husband took our family out for lunch over an hour drive  got to BJs waited about 10 minutes to be seated was 3:30Ordered appetizers avocado egg rolls and stuffed mushrooms  then for meal we ordered classic chicken Sandwich with sliced wedge fries and buffalo burger which she didn\'t ask my husband what he wanted for a side. Kids got applesauce and lemonade. We were just going to share the appetizers and fries with them.Ok  so we chat a bit  I see two tables get food before us that came after us. I glance at my phone it\'s 4:11. So 41 minutes had passed. Waitress walks up with avocado rolls. We grub down and then she doesn\'t come back. I see the table next to us get food. I start looking pist off and the waitress decides to finally come back  we ask where\'s our mushroom and our lunch? She responds oh I\'ll just take mushrooms off  your food has been ready it\'s sitting were just waiting for the wedge fries to be ready. I say ""my foods back there sitting and you didn\'t think to come tell me hey you want your food while we wait for the fries?""She looks at me shocked like communication with your guests is something nobody has ever heard of. I say ""bring me the food  and just bring the fries when they\'re done""She says ok and goes to get our food. Comes back with the food which you can tell was under a lamp because the plate was hot as sin and the bread was soggy from the sauces sitting. Was so pist off at this point but the kids were fussy and needling to eat ASAP or I would have moved our family next door to sea tai noodle which BTW has extraordinary service and food is on point every time. Mushrooms never came she figures since she forgot to put in the order she\'d just take it off our tab  but I ordered mushrooms because I WANTED mushrooms  what she should have done was brought the mushrooms and then apologized for the lack of communication and then taken them off my tab for her inability to serve guests correctly. Lesson learned. I\'ll never go there again. Whoever manages this place needs to do employee training and be clear on communication between servers and guests. Just because you forget to put in a order doesn\'t mean your guest shouldn\'t receive the order. That\'s your screw up  not the guests. Sea Tai Noodle it will be next time."
Cheryl R.,Santa Rosa  CA,14,3,1,10/16/2016,1.0,Only giving one star because it was the absolute worst service I have ever had! The server was MIA most of the time. Took over an hour to get food and someone else actually brought it out. Took forever to get refills. Asked to speak to a manager and they couldn't even show up! Very disappointed. Will more than likely be my last trip there.
Patricia M.,Santa Clara  CA,2,8,8,3/20/2017,5.0,Our server Gary Michael made this the best experience out of any Bj's I've been to! He was fabulous  funny  and went above and beyond anything I expected! THANK YOU!!!
Lily A.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,8,1,1/13/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,As if it could have gotten any worse... my whole table got food poisoning after dining here. Never ever ever again.
Daniel H.,San Jose  CA,506,1487,8533,2/14/2015,2.0,My coworkers and I came here for an early dinner. It wasn't that busy and parking was plentiful in this big plaza that the restaurant was located in. There were 6 of us so we all squeezed into a booth perfectly fine. There was a ton of selection on the menu and I don't remember that much when I went to a BJ's Restaurant at another location; however  that was like five years ago so things could have changed. The menu ranged from salads to steak to pasta to dessert and everything in between. The rest of our table were still deciding what to order so a few of us ordered drinks. I ordered the Jerry Burst ($5.95) for a drink which was a cider blend. A little while later  our waitress came back to take our orders. I chose the Cajun Pasta ($13.75) because it sounded good to me and I didn't want to eat something like a burger. I don't remember what everybody else ordered so this will be one of those picture posts without labels.The Jerry Burst was not bad but I probably should have ordered something else if I was going for hard cider. We waited a long time for our food to come out. The Cajun Pasta was okay at best and it was a lot for one person. I was working on it when our waitress came by to ask if we wanted dessert. Just because everybody else at the table except me was close to being finished doesn't mean you should ask if we wanted dessert. To me  that was like telling us to leave sooner so the table could be cleaned up for another potential group of people. I wasn't too happy about that and I had a lot of food left so not sure why she still asked.The food was okay here and maybe I just had bad luck coming here. I probably won't come back.
Julie S.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,8,,2/19/2017,4.0,I've come here with my family many times  the food is always good but most of the time the service is severely lacking. Tonight was the BEST service we've ever gotten. The kitchen was slammed and our food took a long time but it wasn't so bad because our server Gary Micheal was so attentive. He checked back made sure we knew the food was on the way  kept our drinks full and dazzled us with his humor and great attitude. Our server did all this while taking extra tables all over the restaurant  we were very pleased and will be coming back soon because of his outstanding service! Thank you so much  we will make sure to request you every time! 5 star service!!! Thanks Gary!
Joana G.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,36,24,2/3/2016,3.0,I'm giving it a three because I didn't really appreciate how rude they acted when I wanted to sit far FROM A BIRTHDAY FKN CROWD... I wanted some peace..some alone time. I was surrounded by everyone and their mother. Anyways. I love bjs don't get me wrong. But I over heard the host speak rudely about me wanting to sit away from everyone. He whined about me sitting in his area. That right there can ruin the whole mood. Anyways food was great. Staff put on a fake as smile and my host came with a fake ass smile and attitude.. he was sweet. Too bad the only other bjs around here is in terra Linda
Jim C.,Sausalito  CA,1,8,,2/7/2017,5.0,A favorite for years. Great menu selection that changes through the year. Food is always excellent and consistent. Their rewards program is one of the best in the business. Their staff and service is always first class. Highly recommend!
Marty G.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,8,1,7/14/2017,5.0,Just ate lunch here and had the shrimp tacos that were delicious! Thanks to the manager and our server we had excellent service and the manager comped our calamari and put in a new order because the first ones were a little over done! Can't complain! Would definitely come back here with more friends!
Lauren F.,Wilsonville  OR,398,379,583,9/21/2014,4.0,Excellent service  menu variety  delicious$ - $$The atmosphere reminds me other places like Elephant Bar  but this place is way better than those other places. My experience last night was great! I celebrated my husband and my dad's birthday  so there was a total of 5 in our party last night. Thanks to our awesome server  Michael L  for being an awesome waiter. He had a great attitude (very positive and upbeat)  quick with everything  and made our night very pleasant. Menu variety was overwhelmingly awesome. I love their beer selection! I had the Jeremiah Red and decided to pair that with my cherry salmon entree  which was hands down one of my favorite dishes  ever. Generous portions  too. Overall  I recommend this place if you're looking to eat out with a group of people or if you're on a date :) Great food and portions for the prices.
Greg M.,Rohnert Park  CA,52,9,3,10/2/2016,1.0,How is this place still in business? Seriously  it gets worse every time I go back. It shouldn't take 45 mins to make a med burger  which makes sense that it came out black. Not well done  black. I said I wouldn't eat it and the server got me a new one. Grand totally of almost 2 hours in the place. It wouldn't be so bad I guess if our server didn't look like she hated her life and us for being a part of it. Don't go here  save your money.
Mo M.,Ukiah  CA,553,61,59,6/20/2016,5.0,I had my first experience at this restaurant about a week ago. The service was good  the food was delicious and served quickly and they have a lot of good beer on tap.
Anna M.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,1,,7/12/2017,1.0,Worst experience ever. Came here for a quick bite to eat with my friend and her mom for lunch. It took about 45 minuets for them to get their food. They didn't bring my food out with the other food no big deal but I didn't get my food until everyone was almost done eating. When I did get it my soup was cold  didn't get the salad I ordered  and it was soggy. The server didn't even check to see if my food was ready until I asked. We asked three times for a refill and he just couldn't bother himself to help us. He questioned our tip amount and the payment method. He hovered while we were putting our money down. He wasn't around to help us until it was time to pay. I don't think I will be back. Very disappointed.
Jeff T.,Upland  CA,243,37,54,4/6/2016,2.0,I ordered the mini pizza and berry cider...i had an allergic reaction to one of the berries or apple in the cider so i stop drinking it after 4 drinks and ask for a box for my food...server asked what is wrong and i told her...however she did not ask the manager to take my drink off my bill it is still 3/4 full. ..shoulda asked this question but never did...very disappointed
Vincent F.,Windsor  CA,0,3,,2/9/2017,5.0,I love coming to BJ's and this visit was no different. Came in the afternoon and had a great bartender name Molly. Super nice and knowledgeable about the food and especially the beer. It's not very often that someone knows more about beer than me  and she recommended Jeremiah Red Ale which was delicious and fulfilled my pallet. I also munched down on some Mediterranean Chicken Tacos  cooked perfectly and arrived promptly. I'm not pretentious or a stickler about food and understand that restaurants the size of BJ's deal with a ton of traffic. These guys do the best they can and always deliver with a smile on their face!
Ryan M.,San Francisco  CA,24,52,30,11/8/2016,1.0,The food is horrible  the service is even worse  and they charge way too much. You might as well go to Applebee's or Olive Garden  cause the microwave is the most used appliance in the kitchen. Try to get a refill on your drink there  I dare you.
Glenn S.,Sebastopol  CA,116,35,23,9/13/2016,2.0,The restaurant was clean and there were lots of choices on the menu and wait staff is nice. But it took us 15 minutes to get seated   20 minutes or so to get our menus  and then about another 45 minutes or so to get our food. The food was underwhelming and overpriced we won't be back again
Amy E.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,19,,4/28/2017,1.0,Came for drinks and we were going to stay for dinner. Filthy glassware!  I cringe! Not to mention the green thing stuck to the inside of my beer glass. Disgusting. Paid bill asked for mgr Pedro only to wait and wait! Leaving and headed to a better situation. Watch out for your health's sake!!!
Mike T.,Rocklin  CA,3,10,,9/13/2016,1.0,Slow night Monday figured we'd eat at bar and it wouldn't take long. 30 minutes later still no food but three different times we were told food was coming. Waited so long had to get it to go and when we finally checked order in car no fries with that burger. At this point why wait another 15-20 minutes for fries. Ridiculous service. Never eat here again.
Sharon B.,Petaluma  CA,64,6,,12/18/2016,5.0,Angela was a terrific waitress  food was quite well done. Ahi salad. Look for dots of Wasabi on the sides of the bowl.
Kim G.,Santa Rosa  CA,23,23,7,2/24/2016,1.0,I wish there was a zero star rating. Multiple visits to this location and every single time we leave irritated abut something. Tonight was the final visit. After a very friendly smile and greeting we waited for a reasonable amount of time and then we were seated. A table for two. Easy enough. In the middle of the dining floor at a booth. After 15 minutes of multiple servers walking by not making eye contact and not one acknowledgment that we were there we decided to leave and go elsewhere. When we passed the host stand in the front I said we were leaving so our table was open and was returned a simple  'OK  thanks'I'm disappointed with this location. BJs as a chain is much better than this staff consistently represents.
R J.,Windsor  CA,2,3,,9/23/2016,1.0,Had the worst experience here last night. It should have been a sign of what was to come while waiting in the lobby and nobody was getting seated right away. Party of 9 and our dinner took two hours. 6 out of the 9 received there dinners after an hour. 10 minutes later two other receive their dinners then mine 20 minutes after that! By the time I got my meal everyone was done. The server was apologetic and said the manager was cooking and said he would come out to talk with us. Never came out. Seemed like most of the staff there quit and there were only a couple of people running that place. Very strange! Horrible service! It's disappointing because I really like there food  but the service is so bad I don't ever want to go back. Something seriously needs to change there  or they are going to lose lots of customers!
Dianna M.,Santa Rosa  CA,4,24,4,3/20/2016,4.0,I like BJs brunch menu. I been there a few times and every time food was great. My kids love it.
Em L.,Sacramento  CA,216,722,40,7/29/2015,5.0,Having never been to a BJ's  I figured it would be decent food in a chain restaurant atmosphere. However  the service was fantastic. Folks were genuinely friendly. Being fairly late on a Tuesday  the atmosphere was pleasantly charged with summertime  beer and gathered friends. This location has a large front patio with comfy seating and a few tv's. A great space to sit and have a drink while you wait for your food. When you're craving the ultimate suburban experience - positive energy  bustling staff  American style food and good beer on the restaurant patio - BJ's is it.
Kristy P.,Rohnert Park  CA,96,3,,1/20/2017,5.0,Mathew was awesome! We come quite often and he has been the best waiter yet! He was funny and kept us laughing the entire time! Very entertaining! Thanks Matthew!
Joe L.,Ross  CA,0,32,,6/28/2017,2.0,"Went in for Lunch. Slowest service ever. Could barely eat my food before I had to get back to work. Had been in previously for dinner. Beer is okay but sub par for sonoma county  so many better local places. Not in a ""rush"" to go back."
Peter K.,San Jose  CA,2,7,2,4/11/2017,1.0,Went for lunch on a Tuesday. Waited an hour for mediocre food with no check ins or explanations. Our server disappeared. We found out later that he was pulled into kitchen. The kind of meal you regret. Avoid this place.
Kelly S.,Campbell  CA,160,2,,1/10/2017,4.0,Our server Isabella was very patient and friendly and we enjoyed our time while we were in town. It was a late night and she was incredibly kind for such late service
Judy H.,Shingle Springs  CA,0,34,,4/17/2017,2.0,The main thing this restaurant had going for it was our waitress/server  Athene. She was fun  had a great personality  and was knowledgeable about the menu and the specials. Now to the food. The HOT wings were way too spicey  the food orders got lost somewhere in la la land; one order arrived well after the others. Two people ordered prime rib-one order had a small piece of meat and the other a huge piece-all for the same price! Might come back someday when I am in the area.
Kent B.,Modesto  CA,0,10,,1/7/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"Well this BJ location just continues in its horrible service. In my four previous visits I had to either address failures in service or food quality. With the last two brought to the attention of management I truly hoped to see improvement  but I was wrong. 22 minutes to even have someone come to the table with three return visits to clarify our order. The place is always packed with youths so I can only assume this is the desired clientele.  And I support this statement with the observation of most alll the servers spending time ""BSing"" and not providing service. Horrible service  cold food and other customers cussing and being obnoxious  this will be our last visit to this location."
D O.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,4,,1/6/2017,4.0,Dustin did fantastic job taking care of us yesterday! He is fast  friendly and efficient!I love BJ's extensive menu. Their steak  ribs  Twisted BLT salad  roasted Brussel Sprouts are some of our favorites!
Don M.,Cotati  CA,6,21,2,5/26/2017,2.0,First time my family went it was shortly after they'd opened  so I chalked the terrible service up to it being new. At the time food was sent out 20 minutes apart and the most recent order at that time was cold  the wait was long for a check etc.Since then I've heard better things  maybe it's just my luck  I don't know.Went last night  ordered drinks  my wife received a strawberry lemonade vs a Lynchberg Lemonade which we'd ordered. No big deal  so we ordered dinner  which was very good  and at the same time we ordered dinner we ordered my daughter the mini pazooki (sp?) off the kids menu. After we'd been done eating for some time and were left just sitting there we flagged the young lady and asked about the desert  no problem she said. We continued to wait  and wait  and wait. I ended up flagging her down again and politely said we'd hold off on the desert  asked for the check please. So we got the check and an apology  that she didn't know why it was taking so long.Review the check  we were charged for the appetizer that per their current promotion was supposed to be free  which the young lady apologized for and corrected. Then we found we were charged for the strawberry lemonade which wasn't ordered nor consumed. To top it off  we did see the credit for the desert item BUT we were being charged for  and I'm sure ordered  the full size one for almost $8 vs the one off the kids menu we ordered for our daughter for $2.50I hoped for a better experience
T S.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,29,1,1/3/2017,2.0,Lunch was good. Had the hawaiin pizza  unique. Service was slow and disorderly despite the large number of wait staff. It was busy but could have been more efficient.
Drake M.,Santa Rosa  CA,82,7,17,12/31/2016,1.0,This place has failed to impress me on numerous occasions. When I first started going here  the food was great and the service was decent. The last 3-4 times  the food has been bland  undercooked  over cooked  and not worth what you pay for. Every time I go in now other parties are complaining and asking for managers because it is so slow and horrible. It took them 2 & 1/2 hours to bring us our food on several occasions and then we had to wait another 45 minutes just to get the check. Probably not coming back.
Josue C.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,1,,4/7/2017,1.0,I would leave no stars if possible after being seated for 20 min on a slow Friday night many waiters walked by and didn't offer to get us drinks. Many other tables got seated after us and were helped after only a couple minutes of waiting; I won't be coming back to this specific BJ's and would recommend to stir clear of this establishment.
Danny Z.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,7,3,9/29/2016,1.0,Horrible food and service  Don't waste your time and money.... I regretted my self for ever ! Poorrrrrr
Adam B.,Sunnyvale  CA,13,23,4,5/12/2016,3.0,The long and the short of it is this: we came here with a party of 6 on a busy Saturday. Service was pretty good considering. When it came to our main dishes (3 pizzas)  there was a slight delay which we barely noticed until the manager himself came by to apologize. But when they did bring us our pizzas  one of them was entirely wrong. The manager came by again to apologize again. Ultimately  he added a forgotten topping to the same pizza to sort of half-correct the issue  but also offered us a free pizza to go (the correct one). It means a lot to me that the manager would own up to a mistake and apologize in person.I've been to a few BJ's and I will probably continue to to go to them  even though it seems like every time we go there is always  like ALWAYS some minor screw up. Nothing so egregious to stop us from going  but seriously BJ's? How hard is it to find good wait staff in like EVERY city you operate in? You have a fun atmosphere  but 'professional service' would not be one of the terms I would use to describe my experiences. Now  my friends and I will go and almost take bets on what stupid thing they are going to screw up. Oh well  first world problems I guess.
Bob L.,Rohnert Park  CA,51,186,,3/12/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,it pains me to do this  but the quality of things has been slowly declining the last couple of times I've been here. Service is Ok  a tad slow but they are always busy so no biggie. The food however  I expect more at this price point  it just seems  not quite sure the right word  bland? It's like there's a formula and they don't deviate from it  everything tastes the sameI don't know  I'm just not not as big a fan as I was  better places in Sonoma County to spend my money
Hermann M.,Sebastopol  CA,1,226,,3/2/2017,3.0,This is another one of those places I forgot to review because I haven't been here in years  so this is more like what it used to be  not what it is now. I'd give it 5 stars for beers  theirs & guest taps  4 stars for food  & 2? stars for service. The 1st time I came here  a girl washing the front windows turned around  ran into me & tripped me as I was walking in. Another time I came for lunch  the order was wrong & took a long time  but the bartender refused to correct it. I've been to over a dozen BJ's in the past 20 years from here to samdiego  but this one had the worst service from the start. I loved their Tatonka Stout  PM Porter  Jeremiah Red  & their IPA too. They even made a 10% Grand Cru annually. For a chain  BJ's was a great place to stop when traveling to drink & eat  especially when there were no other local breweries around. Happy hour & dinner were both good  & most had a larger selection of guest beers than their own on draft. Never cared for the wall of sports tv's or the high noise level  however. Someday we'll have to return to update this  but it seems to have received so many bad reviews lately  I'm in no hurry now.
Sandy F.,Willits  CA,0,1,,3/12/2017,1.0,I gave it a second chance. Never again! Waited forever for cold spaghetti with very little sauce and dry burnt meatballs. The roll was good. From the looks of other reviews it sounds like some changes need to be made before it's too late to keep customers coming in.
Chuck C.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,1,,6/29/2016,1.0,"Have been here a couple times and have not had a very good experience. Ordered Calamariand received the a very small amount on a rectangular plate missing the marinara missing. The ""not very friendly"" waitress (If you can call her that) says that the marinara is on the way. Well  It never arrived and she had the audacity to ask how the meal was....Will not come back again. She did not even apologize."
Justin L.,Santa Rosa  CA,281,15,1,10/26/2016,1.0,When you order a salad and you wait 20 minutes for it and it is still not there. The damn pizza will be here before the salad
maria v.,Calistoga  CA,7,46,106,1/26/2016,4.0,I've been to this restaurant a few times I like there food.The dishes we ordered where a good portion and tasted good. Atmosphere was good we went kinda late so it was not to noisy.Our waiter was very attentive and asking if we needed anything.Its a nice restaurant to have drinks and just hang out with friends.There prices aren't to expensive.
Monica C.,Fremont  CA,0,4,,7/3/2016,1.0,The food had no taste. Very bland. Needed to add some flavor to everything we go. Moscow mule did not come in a cooper cup  very disappointing. I know how petty it sounds but even dive bars have'em. Not to mention the servers were very unprofessional laughing very loud for such a small space. The service was very dull and a little rude.
Ceecee M.,San Jose  CA,136,190,170,6/18/2015,2.0,Yuck! Two stars are for the okay service  but the food was absolutely distasteful. Stopped by for an early lunch with my sisters and mom. We were quickly seated and given menus. Despite the almost empty restaurant  it took a while for our orders. I decided to try one of their fish dish with mahi mahi. It was horrible! I could not eat it. The description mentioned veggies. Well this dish was lacking them all. The fish tasted like old canned tuna gone bad. I was unable to eat it. I had some of the rice that came with it  but that was hard to swallow too! Unfortunately  I will not be returning to a BJs anytime soon and especially this one.
Kristin B.,Santa Rosa  CA,149,132,53,1/5/2016,2.0,"I\'ve been here a couple times in the past and have always left feeling like I will never go back. Then something happens  like a friend is in town and wants to meet there. The last time was because we were looking for a place to watch the game and I had a coupon. We get there and sit at the bar and hand the bartender the coupon for a lunch entree. We get a beer and order a couple lunch entrees. A few minutes later I realize mine was supposed to come with a salad  but he didn\'t ask for that....so I try to ask him a few times  but breezes by in a hurry. I\'ll cut the guy some slack because he\'s tending bar  but people were only ordering beer so not that much slack. My friend\'s soup comes out very quickly....just without a spoon. He asks a couple times for one....a spoon finally arrives 30 minutes later. I ask the server if I get a salad with mine  he says ""not with this"". I think  well that menu is sure deceiving  but it\'s not like I really need it. We eat and the food is decent. I had spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were good  but the sauce was overpowered by the spices. My friend had a sandwich which was good as well with his cold soup. When the bill comes out  the coupon was applied (yay!)  except he didn\'t charge us lunch prices  so it ended up costing just as much. (also $6 for the beers they have on tap is pretty ridiculous)I think this has finally been my last time at BJs."
Stevey W.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,19,3,10/18/2016,3.0,Came here on a Sunday night  not to busy. It took about 5 minutes to get seating for 2. We then were seated at the tables near the bar but also by the entrance to the kitchen. The manager on duty at the time was great. Our server seemed overwhelmed like she was tryna to make the service great but every encounter seemed rushed. Overall the food was great !
Adrienne l.,Sebastopol  CA,0,11,,5/9/2017,2.0,Ordered grilled chicken fettuccini it came without chicken. Service is great until your ready for the check and then no one comes around
David F.,Hidden Valley Lake  CA,0,11,9,8/22/2017,1.0,I'll start with by saying kudos for the Tuscan tomato bisque and Mediterranean chicken pita tacos both were excellent. My son's 5 meat pizza was also a winner. Where things broke down was wait time for food and menu descriptions not matching the food served. My son's girlfriend ordered the salmon tacos - which I'm sure we're delicious - but unknown to her  contained cilantro  something she is allergic to. Our server was very helpful and refired the order mentioning to the kitchen staff no cilantro. They had to leave so the order was packed to go and guess what she found buried beneath everything else in the taco - cilantro. Fortunately she didn't eat it and need a trip to the emergency department. I returned to the store and spoke to the on duty manager  Ali  who left me with an unconcerned so what attitude. She had the opportunity to right a wrong but obviously lacks the training or experience to do so. I'll have to give it some serious thought before I ever walk in those doors again. I need to append my review to indicate that the company's operations manager responded to my written complaint promptly and I appreciate that. I'm satisfied  by his response to me  that they have addressed the issues and it will not happen again. With that said; yes  I would eat there again and will soon do so.
Em C.,Santa Rosa  CA,26,154,155,2/25/2015,4.0,I'm actually kind of surprised that I think this place is decent. The service has always been great  but maybe that's because I'm usually by myself when I come here for dinner. Services is usually pretty spot on and the staff has always been super nice despite being busy. The food is alright. I've had an entree or two that I wasn't feeling (capellini)  but I recently had the chicken parm which was pretty yummy (lemon on parm is actually really good). They're open pretty late which is nice since there isn't much open late in Santa Rosa.
Matt P.,Santa Rosa  CA,98,9,1,2/1/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Great that BJ's customer service responded so quickly!! was not expecting that. that just tells me that they are working nonstop to make there product better and that they want me to come back. My wife and I don't get the chance to go out that often  but we will go back to BJ's!!!
Mabel N.,Windsor  CA,52,8,1,1/16/2017,1.0,"Our waitress was ""new"" this was our 3rd time coming here to give it another try but as usual true disappointment to get a seat there was a wait of 30 min the waitress was nice but she was all over the place messed up our order my father had to wait an additional 15-20 min for his food it was cold when they finally brought it too him she didn\'t care to ask me for water refill she was rushing me about taking my order for my son and insisted to order a cheese and tomato pizza total disappointment  she forgot to bring me my apple sauce for my son   it was just a mess   quality of the food it was not good I rather pay the same price at a locally owned restaurant and not a chain where all the food is dry and dull my mom ordered and fettuccine pasta presentation was awful and there was not enough sauce on it and only one piece of broccoli all the way to the bottom  my burger was semi warm and potatoes wedges tasted old I will not be coming here again. Sorry gave this a try a few times"
Korinn H.,Santa Rosa  CA,37,20,1,1/23/2016,2.0,I've been three times...I always give a place three chances. Unfortunately  all three times were not good experiences. The first time  our entree came with my appetizer and my friend's appetizer didn't come at all. It took at least 10 minutes to get her appetizer removed from the check. The second time  my friend was almost finished with her lunch when mine arrived. The third time  there was a mistake on the check and it took 20 minutes to get it resolved  (actually  17 minutes...I know because I had to be somewhere else and kept checking the time). I don't understand why it takes so long for a server to find a manager to correct a check!The food and drinks are ok but not good enough to lure me back. Three strikes and I'm out...I've worked in several restaurants and believe these issues have no excuses.
Alexis R.,Pacifica  CA,0,2,,4/21/2017,5.0,We were visiting from out of town and decided to come here  Tiffani was our sever tonight in the bar area and she was AMAZING!!!! We were not use to this type of service! Fast and efficient! She was great! We will be returning when we come back to visit!
Jaii V.,Fremont  CA,70,46,5,10/12/2015,1.0,Emailed corporate: Last night was suppose to be a night of fun  good food  basically a time to remember with family who were visiting from Los Angeles. Our party was of 10  ages ranged from 4 to 75 years old. I personally had never been to BJ's but someone suggested we try it and we went in. We were seated in a timely matter and our server was Melissa. She came around to get our drinks  took our order and then the problems began. We noticed food was taking a bit longer than what we have experienced before at other restaurants  we inquired about it and were told it should be coming shortly. After about an hour I received my burger and fries before my salad  not a deal breaker. My daughter received her rack of ribs  my son his kid's pizza  someone else a pasta. Another 15 minutes later my husband' uncle received his soup and appetizer. Due to waiting for the food so long we began eating. Half way through his soup he found an earring! I have added the picture. We asked for the manager  when he came around he explained that earrings weren't allowed in the kitchen area  however gave no explanation as to how it got there. We informed him that by this time we had been waiting too long for our food  I had finished my burger and 5 others had not received their orders. A few minutes later two more orders (Andy appetizers) were brought out. My husband's cousin was genuinely upset that her order  a salad  had yet to reach the table. We received appetizers (also after the burger and rack of ribs  one would imagine those come before the entrees)  but no salad? At that point she and my husband cancelled their order  two more orders were never brought  then they said there was a confusion about who's order was cancelled. It could have been easily resolved if they would have asked. Through all this Melissa was refilling drinks  I honestly think she felt embarrassed about the whole ordeal. We do not blame our waitress  she was attentive. We did not pay for our bill as the manager waived it. However a wonderful night with family was ruined! We were easily there for almost 3 hours  at least 2 of those waiting for food! They resorted to eating at a drive thru instead. I am unsure if this is common practice at Santa Rosa's BJ's but after I looked up reviews (wish I truly hoped we would have looked at before going in) it seems that mediocrity is a problem. We were very upset  and highly doubt we will return to this restaurant. For your future guests I recommend you solve the issue  take this as a learning experience and hopefully you are able to provide a wonderful dinner to your future guests.
D D.,Surprise  AZ,0,29,1,1/7/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Well with urging from husband we returned and again this location validated there is no need for us to ever return again. After being seated 20 minutes passed before we were able to flag someone down. Then after ordering and another 20 minutes later my husband got his Salmon  but my salad...yes salad was not ready for another 5 minutes. BJ'S has decent food  but the overall service and management is horrible. No further visits for us at this location.
Tyler S.,San Diego  CA,26,120,3,2/5/2016,3.0,Five stars for service! But tonight I went about 4 pm for a beer and reported to a manager that last visit I was sick. His response was I likely got it elsewhere. A new study he says food illness is many more hours before when I got sick. Well I got sick 4 hours after BJ's with dizzy  cold sweats then tossed it. That seems clear to me. I just wanted them to be alerted to it. But after the managers response tonight I decided to post on yelp. Ive enjoyed BJ's for a long time up and down the state. If any of you get sick let them know.. So they can investigate it.
J R.,Pacific Grove  CA,229,841,964,12/27/2014,4.0,"Our waiter Ben rocked. Otherwise  this would be more like a 3 star review. The place has some nice local aesthetics for a chain  and in spite of it being somewhat crowded  it was easy for us to talk without dealing with excessive noise. Pretty good value for the $. The menu is huge  and so obviously not everything is going to be great.What we liked: I had five oz pours of the following. I liked three out of the four a lot  and by the end of the meal  the fourth one tasted pretty good  too:HopStorm IPAPiranha Pale AleBJ\'s Oasis AmberNutty BrewnetteThe mozzarella-tomato salad that I got to accompany my lunch special was very tasty  though the tomatoes were not exactly at their peak of ripeness (or they were just out of season).Mixed feelings about the Avocado Egg Rolls (""a blend of avocados  creamcheese  sun-dried tomatoes  red onions  cilantro  chipotle peppers and spices  served with a sweet tamarind sauce""). A bit pricey. Gf didn\'t think they were worth the calories or the cost  and the texture of the filling was a bit odd. I didn\'t detect much besides avocados on the inside  but the rolls were nice & crisp  and I really liked the dipping sauce. Gf\'s mahi mahi plate was good but not great.My deep dish pizza  one of the lunch specials  was not good at all. Lots of dough  a decent amount of anchovies  and not much else. If you\'re looking for real Chicago deep dish pizza  this ain\'t it.But like I said--the service was great  the food was filling  and the beer was pretty good."
Aiden P.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,3,,10/9/2016,2.0,Didn't like the food great staff and a peer felt location I love the decor and the love put into making this fun place but the food brought me down it was big and low grade

Becky K.,Santa Rosa  CA,25,5,,10/5/2016,3.0,Used to have awesome poke! Ordered it today. It isn't even poke anymore. It was cabbage salsa with 5 pieces of ahi. Felt very ripped off. Everything else was good.
Nicholas B.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,13,,9/8/2016,5.0,The service here has always been fantastic  even on crowded nights. This place always has deals as well that I've always seen advertised at the entrance (if you download the app). The prices are very reasonable and the food is great. The restaurant is full of TVs and is very clean and well maintained.
Robyn C.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,10,,1/9/2017,2.0,I have eaten at BJ's before and really enjoyed it  and so was disappointed in the low quality of the food this time. The artichoke dip was delicious  as usual. Also  I specifically asked for NO bacon on one order and it arrived smothered in bacon. I will not be ordering take-out from BJ's again.
Raelle C J.,Windsor  CA,0,2,,9/29/2016,5.0,Came in to catch up with a friend today and was served by Tina! A remarkable server that I am so happy with. She made some fabulous food recommendations. As a server I know what it's like with the hustle and busyness as a waitress and I just want to commend her attitude and energy. Food was amazing and came quickly  appetizers were bomb....no complaints! She made our experience nothing less than amazing! Thanks Tina! :)
Melissa R.,Windsor  CA,259,101,262,9/28/2015,4.0,Stopped here for their meal for 2 for $25. The food was good and the service was great. Our meal special included a soup or salad for each person  a medium pizza and a deep dish ice cream cookie thing. Lol. It was all very good. We order a deep dish combination pizza. Everything was very good on the pizza and the crust was light and soft. My little one ordered the kids spaghetti and meatballs. Her plate was enormous! It also came with a side in which she ordered skinny fries and was also served with a crunchy cheesy garlic bread/crostini. It was way too much for her but I'm not complaint because she got to take it home and have it for dinner. She was in love with her spaghetti. The skinny fries were very good too. The strawberry lemonade is so delicious. It tastes like its homemade and has crushed strawberries in it. It's very refreshing. The wild berry mojito was very tasty too. Our server Kim was very nice and attentive. She's always such an amazing server and makes you want to keep coming back. Thank you for the great service.
Lynnette D.,Fairfield  CA,0,7,,12/29/2016,1.0,I went to Bj's Restaurant & Brewhouse on Coddington Avenue in Santa Rosa on Tuesday  December 27th with my husband and another couple. I had the worst experience ever. First the server took our order  brought our drinks and then disappeared. I ordered a salad and a small  thin crust margarita pizza. The others at my table ordered soup and sandwiches or a hamburger. Someone else brought out the soup and my salad. I had no silverware to eat my salad. We had to ask 3 different staff members to bring me a fork. After 5 to 10 minutes I finally got a fork. Then came the main course. Everyone at my table was served 10 minutes before I finally got my pizza. A dish that should take only 5 minutes to prepare. Everyone else had a dish that took longer to prepare. This was the first time my husband had been to BJ's. Needless to say he was less than impressed. We would have overlooked this if the restaurant had been busy. I will never go to this particular BJ's again  and I'm not too sure about any BJ's.
martha g.,Sonoma  CA,26,52,122,12/5/2015,5.0,Great service thanks the Antonio & Graham.. Excellent service.. The best yet here!! It's nice to know theirs people who enjoy their jobs.. It shows.
John M.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,3,3,3/21/2017,1.0,Worst ever. I will not go back. I think our waitress ate my unlimited salad and soup.
Zach C.,Willits  CA,0,15,,2/18/2017,4.0,I went in at midnight to grab a late dinner.The service was good  food was good with good portions. Great atmosphere. Not sure why they have so many negative post since they seemed to be a fair amount of people eating there this late night. It's a big of a distance from my house so will be the late night spot for dinner.
B. F.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,6,,12/20/2016,2.0,I have been to a lot of BJs locations. This one has the worst service. Servers forget about you. They take a while to even come greet you when you sit down. I am sitting here now and I asked for a booster seat when we were seated and it never came. Drinks often come when the food is delivered. 30 minute wait when half the restaurant is empty. Management has staffing issues. Not sure why I keep coming back.
Dave G.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,1,,12/18/2016,1.0,Waited almost an hour for our food which came out cold and had been sitting at the pass for so long it was completely dried out. We were a party of 4 and all 4 dishes had an issue. Two salads came out without their salad dressing  asked for bbq wings and got spicy buffalo wings instead and the artichoke dip was solid from being completely dried out  and the asparagus that came out with the steak was shrank to the size of a string even the manager was embarrassed we were served it. She apologized and did her best to make things better but after waiting for an hour for our food and another 15-20 for them to fix all the problems it was a little too late. Our waiter had a good attutide but was not very attentive. 65 dollars was absurd for the food. Especially when one meal was already comped. We should have left but we were starving so we stayed. Never again.
Steve C.,Santa Rosa  CA,129,1,,12/13/2016,1.0,Bad. no one brought silverware had to ask. Cold pizza soggy salad  ordered a appetizer it never came all they said was sorry   manager said they would of remade it  didn't want to wait any more
Jay K.,Contra Costa County  CA,2,70,,2/8/2017,5.0,Overall great experience. Me and some buddys came here for the Super Bowl to watch the game and have some beers and grub. We were very well taken care of the entire time. Our waitress was very nice and attentive even though it seemed like every two seconds we were ordering more brews and food. She just made us feel really at home and we appreciated that. I really liked the level of involvement by the manager as well  he was serving tables  seating guests  running food out etc. BJ's may be a chain but i think that this branch does it right and next time i am in Santa Rosa i would definitley stop by again for a good meal. Also  the pizooki dessert is amazing!
Sherry C.,Uinta County  WY,30,60,57,6/23/2016,5.0,"Had an awesome dinner tonight!! Tried their Calamari as our starter then ordered Blackened Salmon Santa Fe Salad. Also want to thank our waiter ""Kamron"" for his excellent service and personable customer service--outstanding!!!!"
Rob G.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,20,,3/4/2017,3.0,BJ's can get fairly busy especially on weekends and during big sporting events. The seating times can vary from 10 to 25 minutes. In addition  the sound in this place gets pretty loud at times. Not a place for a quiet meal. As for the food itself  it's typical pizza  burgers  sandwiches  pasta  salads and other popular appetizers and entrees (a good variety of food choices). The freshness and taste is good  but nothing real special in terms of flavor. Now as for the table service  the servers are nice when they take my order. But to get their attention for assistance after ordering  that's another story. Most of the time  I end up trying to get anyone's attention to get help. The parking lot is big  but can get busy  too. Just have to be patient.
Heather L.,Santa Rosa  CA,173,183,670,12/7/2015,3.0,I am almost always underwhelmed when I visit BJs. I have to say their new menu is much improved from the behemoth that it used to be but generally speaking for the terrible service I almost always have and the quality of food I will almost always chose another place for lunch or dinner.
Amy H.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,5,,11/29/2016,1.0,Twice my office has ordered curbside pickup and BOTH times they screwed up the order and we had to make a second trip to correct it. Food subpar and service was horrible as there is never an effort to make it right. We have to inconvenience ourselves again to correct the error. Not worth it. Get yourselves together  BJs.
Andrea R.,Santa Rosa  CA,12,4,,7/28/2016,1.0,"GARBAGE. its like i went to a Denny\'s but paid more. AND don\'t ask for a ""Sierra Nevada"" because it will not be the ipa.. It will be a Sierra Nevada ""otra vez"" which is pretty much a corona. And don\'t order those mixed sodas... They were literally all syrup  we sent them back. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger medium rare  it was more like well done  no pink at all. Tasted a little burnt on the top. NEVER GOING BACK (well maybe just to sit outside and play Pokemon  but definitely not spending money there)."
Andy S.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,5,,8/24/2016,1.0,Really bad service!! After 20 mins of ordering my food and wait the waitress told me she was out of the drinks I've ordered  still no sign of the food I've ordered? Definitely ain't coming back to this place
Nathan G.,Rohnert Park  CA,4,6,,7/11/2016,4.0,Both working late hours  my girlfriend and I often stop by this location to get a late night bite to eat. The place is very clean and I have never once had a problem with the food or drinks. Service seems to be slow most of the time which can be upsetting  but the servers there are often very nice and interactive with their guests. Great food  great people  slowish service.
Ricci E.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,1,,8/21/2016,1.0,Make sure you're not starving when you get here. It takes forever till you get your food.
Mitzy B.,Santa Rosa  CA,531,288,39,12/5/2014,3.0,This review is purely for the bar area. I have been twice during happy hour and gotten a table quickly (although we may have just had good timing) and decent service. I enjoy BJ's on occasion  but seeing the lackluster reviews below  it seems like a spot that may just need to be visited during happy hour.I was a little disappointed when the happy hour spinach dip was enough for about 10 bites between two of us. I guess that's what happens when you're paying less for something though  just had hoped for more!
Michelle H.,Orangevale  CA,0,7,5,8/11/2016,3.0,My husband and I frequented the BJ'S in Folsom  CA and just moved to Santa Rosa. Last night we tried the BJ'S in Codding Town and it was disappointing. Our appetizer was chips and guacamole  but it was served as a half  hard Avocado impossible to scoop. I sent it back but our server apologized saying the Avocados are not in season and there wasn't anything they could do beyond trying to mash it up better. She took 1/2 price off for us. For our entrees I ordered the fried Mahi Mahi tacos which were delicious and a go-to favorite of mine. My husband ordered a Flatbread Pizza that came out with raw  undercooked dough. Pretty gross. He let our server know  she apologized  and took 1/2 price off. I overhead apologies to surrounding tables as well. I'm not sure if it was just an off night for them but it looks like our go-to restaurant in Santa Rosa will not be BJ'S.
John V.,Santa Rosa  CA,39,53,2,11/27/2014,2.0,Pretty much the only restaurant open late if you're not 21+. Service is good  great depending on who you get. I come here about once every few months and menu gets boring really quick  one thing that never gets old is the deep dish pepperoni  so thats what I recommend. This restaurant is what I'd expect from any chain. Nothing particularly special but if you want to go on a date  have a family gathering  or a get together with friends and you're not extremely bent on trying the most delicious food ever this is the place.Food isn't really that good and it takes forever to come out and when it does come outs it's rarely cooked the way you asked for. Just come here for the Pizookie nothing else
Jamie B.,Healdsburg  CA,11,18,2,7/10/2016,3.0,Food is ok. It seems like a high end Denny's. You can tell the food isn't fresh. Service is ok most of the time. Drink options are awesome. A wide variety of beers. It's a place to go if you need food and don't want fast food but not if you want something to make your taste buds happy.
Kevin O.,Santa Rosa  CA,125,4,1,11/21/2016,1.0,Been sitting here for an hour waiting for our food. I might have to pillage food from people that have already left. Server complaining about the kitchen staff. I'm going to eat the pictures on the wall soon. Please help. S.O.S.
Marcos F.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,8,,8/2/2016,5.0,Me and my wife had excellent service from Rob on a busy weekend and the food was great.
Steph P.,Santa Rosa  CA,23,4,,9/3/2016,1.0,"I have had nothing  but terrible experiences at this location. The last time I went  after waiting 35 minutes for drinks alone  we were finally able to order our food. The appetizer took another 20 minutes to arrive  and it was cold. When I FINALLY got my meal  the bread was black because it was burned so bad. They tried to hide it by putting the burnt side on the bottom. I rarely complain about my food/send it back (like this was my first time ever)  but I could not enjoy a black sandwich. When I asked the waitress to fix it  she replied ""well you\'re going to pay for it anyway  I can just bring you a new slice of bread."" Uhh... What? It won\'t even have the sauce on it. I waited over an hour for this sandwich that looked delicious on the menu  only to find it burnt to a crisp  then told I could get a new slice of bread. Woohoo! Exactly how I wanted to spend $15.I would have never gone back  but friends were getting together there so I decided to meet them. This time I thought would be better  as it has been almost 2 years since I was there last. Our waitress was nice  and checked on us regularly. I ordered a beer ($6.95)  and it was warm by the time I got it. Who wants a warm beer after a long day? I sucked it up and drank it anyway because they were busy and I understand. The bill came. I left $12 for my $6.95 beer. Clearly tipping. We leave  and the waitress chased us out to the parking lot ""um excuse me! Did you not enjoy your service? I\'ll have fun explaining that to my kids!"" At first I felt bad. Like ""oh shoot did I do something wrong?"" But the fact that she chased us out to the parking lot to guilt trip us about not leaving her enough tip turned that around. I understand  I work for tips. You can have the greatest service and sometimes people don\'t tip you what you think you deserve  and you get this urge to tell them off. But you don\'t chase people to the parking lot to complain about the amount they tipped you. $5 on a $7 beer is plenty  especially when it\'s a warm beer!The only reason I gave them even one star is because 1. I had to  and 2. They had clean restrooms."
Tim R.,Windsor  CA,0,4,1,9/26/2016,1.0,Was in on Saturday night with my handicapped son we sat at the bar. Ordered a beer and a Shirley temple for my son  waited almost an hour for food while we noticed everyone that sat after us was being served. I asked the waitress to cancel our order. She came out with it but there were no fries or anything else. So we cancelled and left. The manager said he comped my drinks. Seth and Travis were rude as ever. After I left they charge my card. Not only the worst service but they are thieves and charged me anyway
Kristina T.,Windsor  CA,2,15,1,3/21/2016,1.0,I have been to this place 5 times. And all 5 times have been disappointing. Tonight was the icing on the cake. Was there with family. 2 kids 3 adults. Got there at 5:20pm and at 5:50pm the kids food finally arrived. The 3 adults never received our food. Our waitress came over and said our order was next up. 4 tables later and multiple plates coming out none of it was ours. My sister in law finally canceled our order. We were done. The kids were done. It took a while for the manager to come over. We explained and canceled our order again. Got the check paid for our drinks and left. After being there almost an hour an a half with no food is not ok. Thanks BJ's for your good beer and drinks but your service and food is meh!!
Sirena L.,Santa Rosa  CA,95,142,164,11/1/2014,4.0,Pretty good food  great handcrafted soda and wonderful service. Save room for a Pizookie (Warm cookie served with Ice Cream).
Gina H.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,48,,5/5/2015,1.0,This place needs to organize the front of the house too coordinate with the back of the house. It is way too chaotic and disjointed out front  seems like enough staff  but does not function well.I have been here 4 times  why? I don't know. But each time errors were made with my order and/or timing was way off with delivery of appropriate courses.  Won't be back. Food not even worth it.
David T.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,9,,7/17/2016,4.0,Open late which is nice. Good selection of beer  and lots of seating for large groups. The stuffed mushroom appetizer is good but very small portions. The mushrooms are smaller in diameter than an adult size pinky for reference and with only six of them  it doesn't seem worth the $6.50. The avocado egg rolls and pizzookis are always great. Would recommend a try!
Josh S.,Occidental  CA,0,2,,12/17/2016,2.0,"Extremely slow service for mediocre chain food at an average price. Also ""gluten free"" items are not necessarily so as I found out the next morning after eating there. Two trips in one: first and last."
Margo R.,Cotati  CA,2,50,58,7/24/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I like the mobile app. We ordered in advance for dine-in & got seated right away in the back room  & they brought out food quickly  then we didn't have to wait for our check we just used mobile pay. It saved us a lot of time tonight! Watermelon mojito: summer is here. Jeremiah Red beer: husband's favorite. Deep dish pizza: guilty pleasure!
Ken H.,Santa Rosa  CA,37,46,5,4/24/2015,2.0,"Damn  I wish I\'d have read the reviews here before I suggested to my wife that we head here for a dinner date!Upon entering the restaurant  we were greeted at the front desk and asked how many. My wife responded ""Two..."" and continued to request a table  not a booth  but the girl at the desk turned her back on my wife and didn\'t listen to her. She directed a seater to seat us in a booth. We responded that we did not want a booth and had stated so but she chose to turn her back on us and ignore what my wife was saying. Not starting off on a good note.Our waiter  Ryan  eventually showed up and asked if he could get us something to drink. Why sure  diet cokes  please. ""Is pepsi ok?"" Sure... He produced the drinks and was off somewhere else.After a rather long wait to order  he returned. I ordered two small appetizers for my wife and I and then we continued to order the rest of our meals. After another 10 minutes or so  we were served our salads by someone else. I figured our appetizers would be the first thing we\'d get  but no. I figured they would be next before our meal  but no. We were served our meals by yet a third person who we told to cancel the appetizer orders since they were never served as appetizers -- before the meal. ""Oh  sure.""About 4 or 5 minutes later yet another person comes out to our table with the appetizers we had canceled because we were already served our salads and meals. No  we canceled those because they didn\'t get delivered before our meals. ""Oh  well let me take care of that."" Apparently this person found our waiter and told Ryan that we had canceled the appetizers since they weren\'t delivered before the salad and the meals we were already well into. Ryan then comes over and announces ""I\'ve taken care of the appetizers for you."" Really  Ryan? I think that if you\'d taken care of the appetizers for us  they wouldn\'t have come out to us after we canceled them in the first place.The problem seems to be that there are too many people taking care of an individual table. Our waiter didn\'t seem to serve any part of the meal  other people were. Many other people. There\'s too much of a disconnect between the customer and the waiter and what does or does not come out from the kitchen. Very poor customer service in this respect. The waiter should be doing that or at least overseeing that to make sure it goes smoothly.And finally  when it came time for us to pay the bill and leave  Ryan takes the payment and then doesn\'t come back for some time. My wife is watching him BSing with another one of the waiters for quite some time. Then Ryan comes back and lies to us saying ""I\'m sorry I was late as I had a couple of other matters I was taking care of."" Really  Ryan? I guess ""a couple of other matters"" really translates into ""I didn\'t care enough about you to take care of you in a timely manner because I was BSing with my friends."" The food that we received was pretty good and hot. I had the Jambalaya and my wife had pasta and scampi. I\'d give the food 3 to 4 stars. The service I\'d give 1 star. The prices are high enough that I expect service to match. Between the greeter and the server  it\'s just a shame that the help didn\'t care enough about the customer to serve them correctly because we most likely will not be back again."
Melissa F.,Rohnert Park  CA,153,21,38,3/29/2015,1.0,AWFUL! Absolutely awful. This place is a joke and so is the manager who was beyond rude to me when I brought my concern of his terrible waitstaff to him. I wish I could give this place zero stars. I went in today with my husband  18 month old and I'll go ahead and mention that I'm 9 months pregnant. Today was Sunday 3/29/15 at 12 pm. We were seated within 5 minutes. The problem began once we were seated. We were NEVER helped. NEVER acknowledged. It was lunch time on Sunday but this place was not busy whatsoever. Our section had maybe 3 tables with people besides us. We also saw 3 servers working in this section (not training anyone - 3 individual servers). 10 minutes go by.. We're annoyed. 20 minutes go by and we're considering leaving. 30 minutes later and my daughter is getting tired of waiting  my husband is already half way through his lunch break and I'm STARVING and THIRSTY. No one even brought us water. 30 minutes is BEYOND ridiculous to be acknowledged.. Worst part.. We never were! We got up and left at the 30 minute mark.Since we did not have time at this point  I decided to call and speak to the manager from the car ride to fast food so my husband could eat something before going to work. This manager is a joke. He is the worst. He was extremely rude and obviously didn't give a crap about what I was saying. I was pleasant on the phone.. I'm NOT the person that calls yelling and being rude. His response was basically uh huh.. Okay.. Well you can come back and I can make sure someone serves you. Really? That's it? First of all we don't have time to come back and wait for food. Especially food that I'm sure will be spit in at this point. Didn't offer some type of discount or a free meal. Basically told me there was no he was going to do and to deal with it and that it didn't bother him if we never ate there again.. Seriously?? Yes  I know.. Losing our business is not going to make a dent.. But you don't tell your customer that! How did this guy get hired. We always have chosen BJs (when we lived in San Rafael or we're out of town). But after today's experience I will NEVER return. He made a huge mistake talking to me like that. I fully plan on contacting his manager and corporate regarding his behavior. Completely inappropriate to talk to me or anyone like that. If you have at least 2 hours to have lunch at a not busy restaurant and be treated like crap then this is the place for you..
Maggie D.,Oakland  CA,0,12,2,7/5/2016,4.0,Ate at Bj's late last night. Our server was Jonathan C and he was very friendly and attentive. When he noticed our appetizer hadn't been brought to our table yet after quite a while  he came back and apologized that it hadn't been made yet. He gave us a nice discount on our bill because of the mistake made by the back of house. We really appreciated his accommodations and he made what could have been an annoying experience a great one instead.
Scott S.,Northern California  CA,0,7,1,1/1/2017,4.0,Party of 4 came in on New Year's Day at 530 or so. We asked for a table to sit us and we're told 10-15 minute wait for a table. We decided to sit at a table near the bar instead. A waitress  Angela  serving that table was not only happy to have us but went out of her way to take care of us.Being new years day and all  the restaurant was super busy and appeared that the restaurant was short staffed: empty tables  folks waiting in the front for a seat..Anyway  without going into a long winded story about every minor detail  we ordered appetizers and eventually entrees..The entrees came but the entrees seriously lagged after the apps. In fact we saw adjacent tables come and go and what looked like our order be delivered to another table. I watched the recipients of that food and thought it odd that they seemed a bit surprised by the delivery of the food. Later I learned the Santa Rosa individuals without integrity ate our food with having the decency to admit the misdelivery. Minutes passed. Angela returned and apologized for the delay explaining the short staff issue and deviants that accepted unordered food. The manager came out and talked to us about the issues this day. She was bound to make things right and she went out of her way to make it so. I have worked in the restaurant business myself and know the pressure of prime time. I fault BJ none for this experience . They did a great job handling the circumstances and I will come back just for the sake of their recognition of the situation and their culpability.. cheers BJ S. JOB WELL DONE
Samantha F.,Hayward  CA,13,3,1,7/4/2016,4.0,Higher end Applebee's  totally worth the extra $ for the roomy environment & yummy food. I would like to see one of two cheaper options.
Becca C.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,4,,6/26/2016,4.0,In the past  I would have given this location 2 stars...our food was usually wrong  not great  and took forever. But I have to say  the last 5 or 6 times have been good. Every now and then they get a change to the food wrong  but the wait has been much less  the food is coming faster  and tasting better. It's definitely gotten better in the last few months.
Ross G.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,9,,3/30/2017,1.0,I've never been a fan of BJ's; been there three times and all times the service was slow and the time to get the food was even slower. Haven't been back for over a year and decided to meet some friends for lunch  not by my choice mind you. The first thing we walk into was hip-hop crappy music B-L-A-R-I-N-G in your face. We were told the music system was getting worked on and that the volume would be adjusted soon. We sit down and we literally couldn't hear ourselves talking and we complained to the waitress. She was very apologetic and she deserves five stars  and said she would bring it to the manager's attention. Shortly thereafter the volume goes down but only slightly. It's still way too loud for a comfortable chat around the table.  A minute later the manager shows up  apologizes for the racket and informs us that the volume is as low as it can go. WTF?! I ask if they can at least put on some less abrasive music and he said that it was corporate policy to play the pre-programmed play list and he could not change it  nor turn the volume down any further. If this is corporate policy  than SHAME on them. How incredibly stupid. To say the least  I will never go back to this horrific institution and will be sure my friends know about this experience. Oh  and the food was good  not great  and certainly not worth having to subject my ears to their corporate-mandated play list. Avoid this place.
K B.,Calistoga  CA,0,25,,2/19/2017,1.0,"This was my fourth visit and last. We were seated 10 minutes after expected time  which was odd considering the amount of open tables available. The place was pretty busy and it took our server about 15 minutes to get to us. Having plenty of time  we placed our entire order. Cocktails came in reasonable time  but the server forgot my child\'s drink. Artichoke dip appetizer came about 15 min later and not only looked like it was under the heat lamp for awhile but was burned so bad it smelled like charcoal smoke. We barely touched it. Our dinner came 30 min later  at this point it was over an hour after we sat down and all the tables around us had left and been reseated. I like their jambalia  it\'s spicy  but this time it was unediable. It\'s like the top of the paprika jar came off. Again the dish looked like it had been sitting under the heat lamp. The server initially forgot my child\'s side of fruit too. My husband burger was good and cooked properly. I told the server my meal was disappointing and way over seasoned. We got a ""sorry"" but with all the problems I would have appreciated something taken off the bill. I used to be a restaurant manager and would have never allowed this experience to go without my attention."
Julia P.,San Francisco  CA,105,499,365,5/9/2015,3.0,Standard BJ's no different than the ones in San Diego  LA  Irvine  or other places in the Bay Area.Huge screens to watch sports. Geat beer selection. Somewhat loud but what do you expect?Good place to go for happy hour. Not a good place to take someone on a first date.
Ron C.,Santa Rosa  CA,7,235,143,5/7/2016,3.0,One of the few SR spots open late. Needed some post workout late food on Cinco de mayo. It was crazy in little Mexico so we rolled in here. First time. Nice place  busy but short wait. Massive freaking menu lime 20 pages of stuff. Appetizers came quick  calamari which was a lot. Instead of cocktail sauce we got marinari which was dumb  who wants that. The other dip tasted basically like ranch. Ordered fried chicken  mashed potatoes and corn along with a deep dish ravioli thing. Came fast and hot. Not enough potatoes but otherwise fine. I think this place is a chain but it alright. Open late  decent service  fair prices.
Steve Y.,Sonoma  CA,38,7,2,8/4/2016,1.0,A waste of time. Literally! My wife and hired a babysitter and drove up to have dinner. Got there around 5:45pm. The place was not busy. Maybe 30% full. Asked for a table for 2. There was plenty of empty tables but we waited about 5 minutes to be seated. After we sat down we ordered our beverages and appetizers which came pretty promptly. Our waiter took our dinner order. A burger and a chicken salad. Pretty easy right?? Apparently not! We waited and waited. About 35 minutes after we ordered and after everyone who arrived later than we did were served and eating and or finishing their meals  the manager approached us and apologized for the delay and told us our meal would be out in about 4 minutes. That they were still waiting on the chicken to reach temperature. About another 20 minutes later our waiter came to say our meal was on its way out. 15 minutes later my wife and I discussed leaving. We walked out at 7:15. Our meal never came. Date night ruined. Not only did it cost us our time  it cost us for the baby sitter. We drive over and grabbed a burger at 5 guys. We were in and out in 15 minutes tops!! Never going back to BJ's again. This was our second time there in 6 months   and the first time the service was slow  but we didn't think it was possible to be any worse. We were dead wrong. There is no good excuse for such a lousy experience . Not as much as an apology. Outrageous!
Arlene R.,Novato  CA,0,25,6,3/1/2016,2.0,Just ok  could be better! Should listen to my cut feeling...but thought I'd give it a try...mistake!
Heidi D.,Santa Rosa  CA,200,550,1067,9/7/2012,2.0,"I give it 2.5 stars  based on Yelp\'s review system. It\'s definitely somewhere between ""i\'ve experienced better"" and ""a-ok"" but not much. It\'s a chain so right off the bat  I tend to not hold much expectation. (Snobby of me  I know.) What I like: lunch specials  peanut butter pizookie  going for a relaxed evening (translated to mean it\'s ok if everything takes forever)  later evening desserts  watching the Giants game  space enough for a larger group.What I don\'t like: we sometimes get our appetizers or salads just moments before dinner arrives  and a couple times it came after. Loud atmosphere so conversations can be a challenge  peanut butter pizookies being sold out at 6:30pm (?!?!?!)  and service can be hit or miss. (Smiling servers can only go so far when everything takes so long or it\'s obvious she wants to cash out before the shift change.)I like their southern fried chicken lunch special  mini bruschetta bites  spinach mushrooms  and parmesean crusted chicken dinner.  I\'ve tried SEVERAL other items but nothing stands out as something I\'d order again.  Anyhow  it\'s hoppin\' and that\'s sometimes enough for me to keep going."
George B.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,7,4,1/24/2015,1.0,I wish we had read the reviews before we stopped to eat here. We had a group of 8 and it took us 30 mins to order and 45 mins to get our food! Growing up in the the Napa Valley  I am accustomed to great food being prepared when ordered but this was greasy  over priced and underwhelming. We had to constantly flag people down to get our drinks refilled  items we were missing. If it was lunch time rush I could of understood the wait but the place was half full on a Sunday afternoon. It's a great looking place and the big screens and music give the place a great vibe. But the service and food are what kills this review. There are a ton of better places to eat in the area.
Janelle H.,Santa Rosa  CA,29,12,1,4/2/2016,3.0,I used to love BJ's  even though it is a chain. Their burgers and salads were always good  and they have a nice beer selection. The last two times I have gone have been very disappointing. The salad was soggy and the meat on the salad was just plain gross. The second time I had a burger so over cooked  it was similar to eating my shoe. So I think there are better options around. I might go there for a beer  but not to attempt to eat their food any longer.
Mackenzie M.,Rohnert Park  CA,167,57,6,7/6/2014,2.0,The Mozzarella sticks were delicious  but they gave us barely enough marinara sauce. The burger I had was ok. Not great  not bad. They got my order wrong (Put Bacon on my burger  and no onions). Not a place I'm rushing back to. I will say that they have many drink options.
Alayna F.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,2,,11/18/2016,1.0,If there was a 0 star option I would choose it! We waited longer than an hour for our food. And when we got our food it was so dry and terrible that I swallowed my tonsils. Oh also my butt went from Kim k to Taylor swift in the matter of an hour and a half. #wastemytime2016
Tiffanie H.,Santa Rosa  CA,265,142,491,2/4/2015,1.0,I have been here twice and I knew better than going again. I had wanted to get some breakfast on a Sunday with my son and everywhere else was crowded. There was a server being trained who was lovely  I wish I would have gotten her name. However  the trainer let us sit at our table for over 8 minutes before we were even greeted. They were not busy at all! I would have to say that if you want mediocre food and bad service then you should go. The service is the worst part and has been each time I have been here!
Mike F.,Santa Rosa  CA,8,24,37,8/10/2016,1.0,Had a bad experience the first time. Gave them 2 more opportunities. Same experience with slow service  order mistakes  and low quality food. Lots of places to go in Santa Rosa  would not recommend eating here.
Elizabeth H.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,2,3,10/13/2016,1.0,Would give it 0 stars if that was possible! WORST service ever! Waited almost 2 hours for my food!No sauce on the salmon  not a complicated order...somehow the chef managed to mess it up 4 times & drop it 1 time. Will NEVER go back there again!
Nelson T.,Miami  FL,41,62,158,5/7/2015,4.0,Well it's easy to like this BJS brewery the place always has good beer... My favorite is the piranha beer and the wings are alway good fast service and friendly atmosphere the place is always clean and including the restrooms. At the bar the have large TVs and a place to plug up your phones
Amber A.,Santa Rosa  CA,5,23,19,1/17/2015,1.0,Worst experience I've had at a restaurant. I would never pay a dime to that business! We had a group of 8 people had a total of 4 servers in the time we were there. They brought us water within 2 Minutes took them 20 minutes to make our drinks we had to get up ask for our bill and divide it ourselves after asking her to split it. We talked to the manager  that was a waste of time  he had nothing to say but tried justifying his employees. Don't waste ur money go downtown
Pamela S.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,17,,7/22/2016,1.0,Keep on going back in hopes it was a fluke that it was a crappy meal and horrible slow incompetent service. But no the same experience every time. I'm done.
Rebecca C.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,9,,10/21/2016,2.0,Waitress was great but our order took 45 to an hour to come out and the restaurant didn't really seem that busy (no big parties ahead of us or anything). I ordered the seared ahi salad which I've had before at a different BJ's and enjoyed. The salad came out in a warm bowl (clearly had been sitting under the food warmers) so the lettuce was a wilted. It was completely lacking dressing and missing half of the ingredients that were listed on the menu. No dressing. No pickled cucumbers. No avocado. No tomato. So I got warm dry lettuce  ahi  and some crispy wonton for $15.25. I emailed them and heard nothing back. Completely disappointing meal. I probably won't go back for a while.
Christine N.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,10,,10/19/2016,1.0,So my husband and I have been coming here for over a year. The service has been going downhill over time. Tonight we ordered an appetizer and drinks and that was messed up right away. We ordered a salad and a main dish and waited 45 minutes before our server came over to apologize. They told us three more minutes and we still waited. After another ten we decided to leave. Sadly this place is not what it should be. The service is awful. And the food isn't anything special. See us BJ'S. We will be spending our neighborhood money elsewhere.
Holland L.,Hidden Valley Lake  CA,13,6,1,5/18/2015,2.0,"Food was alright  nothing particularly special. My brothers fish was greasy and overcooked  the sauce that came with it tastes like ""pured urinal cakes"". His gf\'s food was raw and not to order  well no pink  coleslaw salad had no dressing and the topping asked for on the side were absent.Asst. manager was cordial and polite but for the prices and ambience I would recommend going elsewhere."
Susan R.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,15,2,4/13/2016,3.0,BJ's has a huge and varied menu. The food is decent  but not what I'd call exceptional. The restaurant is very convenient for Coddington shopping mall customers. Noise level inside can be quite loud at times. Ample seating is available. Prices are reasonable.I would have given a 4-star rating except for several instances in which the staff's performances were less than stellar. During one visit around 11:00 AM  I came in and requested seating on the patio. There were very few patrons  plenty of empty tables  yet 10 minutes later I was still waiting to be seated. Another time  when I was waiting for my check  I caught the eye of my waiter and motioned him to come over  but he diverted to another table  then disappeared. I finally had to go to the front greeting area and ask for my check.
David B.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,1,,10/7/2016,5.0,Oh my God I've eaten here eight times total in 6 months after reading the reviews I am thoroughly confused are we talking about the same BJ's I've never had a problem with burnt food slow service or unfriendly Hostess  waiter/waitress ? Every time we have eaten here  me and my girlfriend or family  the food has been exceptional   big portions   good portions   cooked to order and everybody's had a good attitude ! Maybe one drawback is the price   a tad bit higher then compared places but it's close  convenient  and good atmosphere... I guess the people that have given this bad reviews should stay home and continue to be Butlers and Maids who serve them at their house/home
Sonny P.,Santa Rosa  CA,53,1,,8/24/2016,1.0,Waited over 45 minutes for take out order. Waitress messed up 1st time and brought out the food thinking i was gona eat here. Then it took another half hour.
Jennifer G.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,8,,4/20/2015,1.0,Curbside service SUCKS!!!!Here I am with all 3 kids waiting in my car 23 minutes- And did I say that I ordered on a silly app to have my food ready & waiting.....NEVER AGAIN-JOKEActually I tried calling in my order a few months ago & was on hold 12 minutes before I drove off-
Anthony Y.,Santa Rosa  CA,3,39,1,8/30/2013,1.0,"Waited a bit for our food. Food was messed up. Waited again for waitress. Told her it was messed up. Waited again for waitress. ""ah shit I forgot about your order..."" Waited again. Manager offered to take meal off my bill...the one I never got.Wish I could write a review about the meal. The iced tea had ice..."
Kassi J.,Windsor  CA,0,7,1,3/29/2017,2.0,Had one of the WORST experiences I have ever had here last night. So we go for my brothers birthday dinner and the minute we walk in we were greeted or anything it was like 4 girls sitting gossiping. At this point was frustrated. Well then we get seated and servers walk by and by and next thing I know 25 minutes go by without anyone stopping and asking us if we want something to drink or anything. At this point I get up and go to the hostess and asked to be seated somewhere else where there was a server (since the other girl sat us in this section). Once we get seated we had a great server for the rest of the night. Was disappointed that they took away the options of fries and also the ones my brother and I had were both semi cold. They kept forgetting about our drinks that they asked us if we wanted refilled and also took two different people to get boxes. It was slow so I was frustrated why there was so many issues. I won't be back for a while I think. Only reason for 2 stars is for the waiters personality.
Cat R.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,38,2,1/3/2016,1.0,If you want to dine here make sure you have lots of time because the service is SLOW! Servers disappear when you need water refilled or ketchup (who doesn't automatically put down ketchup with fries?)  On my last visit I ordered kale and brussel sprouts salad. There was no kale. There were no brussels sprouts. It was an iceberg salad. I told my waiter he brought the wrong salad. He argued with me that it indeed it was kale. He literally picked up a piece of iceberg lettuce from my plate to show me. Let me tell you  I am vegetarian and I know what veggies are. I asked for a new salad. He brought me one 15 minutes later with a lump of brussel sprouts on top of some. . . iceberg! But since my children were long done with their meals I denied the new salad and asked for it to be taken off my bill. I guess that pissed him off because the manager presented me with the check  but no apology.
David W.,Santa Rosa  CA,20,12,7,12/11/2015,4.0,The food is always great quality and the service is fast and friendly. I especially like the baked potatoes. They're huge! I also liked the deep dish pizza. The place is noisy but not overwhelmingly so. The place is also pricy. I ordered a side salad and It was very small for the price. Not worth it. I don't really enjoy it for dinner  however  I would come back just for the dessert. Their Pazookie is fantastic and if you order the mini Pazookies you can get 3 different flavors to share.
Jessica P.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,5,2,2/9/2016,2.0,"Having worked in the restaurant business  I\'ve made it a habit to only review restaurants that I\'ve had positive experiences at. Tonight\'s experience however has really been an awful one. We go to BJ\'s expecting the service to be slow  always  and that\'s fine. We arrived at 8pm and our food wasn\'t out until about 9:15  which is way slower than usual (and not many customers). I am always excited about their steak  potatoes  and veggies. I cannot eat raw meat  so I always order the steak well done (I know it\'s frowned upon in the steak eater world  but it tastes amazing to me). My steak was bloody beyond what I could tolerate. I hate complaining and considered eating everything else and taking the steak to go and cooking it at home to eat later. My boyfriend somehow convinced me to take it back to the kitchen  which I was prepared to do  but almost 10 minutes pass and our waitress is nowhere to be found. We decide to switch meats  since he doesn\'t mind raw meat. I have work early in the morning  I cannot wait another hour for meat. I wish the steak was my only complaint. The ""steamed"" veggies still had a significant crunch (could not stab with a fork) and mashed potatoes were cold (I did not wait 10 minutes to eat these. They came to me cold). I give it 2 stars  because the Pizookies were tasty and our waitress was nice when she was around."
Lucius Q.,Windsor  CA,0,23,5,2/9/2016,5.0,First off our server Andrea did fantastic. She's the real MVP. the food was tasteful and quite quick. I left wanting for nothing else. I was quite satisfied with the experience. Plus there are many options from drinks to appetizers.
Michelle H.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,19,6,9/10/2014,2.0,I was very disappointed in the management. When I brought to his attention that we *waited 40 min after ordering to get our meal *My food was under cooked*we were missing food we ordered *food was cold by the time we got our condiments*I was charged for an entree I did not order or receiveAnd I didn't even get an apology let alone an adjustment on my ticket  or a promise of a free drink or appetizer if I would give their established another opportunity.
Diane V.,Santa Rosa  CA,19,111,201,11/15/2014,5.0,"I believe all the negative reviews written here are swimmers from the shallow end of the gene pool... This place is GREAT! Wonderful service (so what if you have to wait a few minutes  what else do you have to do? If your in that big of a hurry  go through a drive through). Food is excellent & if for ANY reason your dissatisfied they will be more than happy to ""fix it"" for you  but you can\'t sit on your computer & complain after the fact. Super bar tending. Have always gotten a GOOD drink. The people who work here are friendly! Hard working! Pleasant! Serve to please! And for those who think the music is to loud  go to the front desk & NICELY ask that it be turned down  don\'t forget to say ""please""... it has worked for me. I go here often & take as many people with me as I can."
Gina S.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,3,,12/26/2015,1.0,"Had some christmas money to spend on some good food with my boyfriend. We ordered the avocado eggrolls to start  they totally skimped us on the dipping sauce & we had to ask for more. They weren\'t impressive  Tex Wasabi has the best avocado eggrolls by far. Honey sriracha brussels sprouts were good. I ordered the mahi-mahi tacos  they were served to me cold. Barely even room temperature. My boyfriend ordered a small Great White pizza. When they served it to him  they gave him a medium & told us they were out of ""small"" pizzas. They charged us for the small but we were given the impression that these pizzas are frozen/pre-made. Out of ""small"" pizzas? Odd. Can\'t go wrong with the pizookie? You can  the salted caramel was pretty burnt. Out of the couple times I\'ve been here  I\'ve never really had a good experience. Probably wont be coming back."
Andrea M.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,35,,2/12/2016,2.0,Went here for a late lunch. It wasn't busy at all  we were seated right away. Our server wasn't the best  I'm taking that he's new because he passed by our table many times but didn't care to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything. The appetizers came out fairly quick  however it tasted like it was fried in really old oil( we ordered caliemari). Our food took forver to come  we ordered two burgers. Few couples who had come in some time after us got their food way before us. When our server gave us our check he almost walked right passed us without picking it back up. The only good thing about my meal was the fries  they were amazing.
Joe M.,Windsor  CA,2,13,4,3/8/2015,5.0,This place has a great atmosphere big TV's awesome food and a friendly staff. I'd like to give a special thanks to Jessica at the bar she might be the best at her job ever. I've eaten here a lot and every time she's behind the bar my service is impeccable. Thanks Joey
Susanne A.,Elk Grove  CA,0,5,,9/4/2016,1.0,My daughter was with a group of 7 students from Sonoma State last night at BJ's. Out of the 7 students; 4 of them got sick from the food. The food that was ordered was Salmon  BBQ Burger; Steak & Chicken Alfredo. 4 of them got diarrhea  my daughter got the worst of it. She's been up all night with diarrhea  vomiting  and bad cramps. My daughter said when she received her steak  it was rare  she ordered Medium Well. The waitress took my daughter's order back to the kitchen  and brought another order  but my daughter didn't know if it was a new steak or the same steak  but she said the steak wasn't any better  still looked rare. She didn't eat much of it. The waitress didn't charge her for the dinner  but the order should've been done correctly when they brought back the 2nd order. Will they go back there  absolutely NOT!!
Katharine B.,Petaluma  CA,96,49,75,1/14/2015,3.0,"Pretty average bordering on the decline. My guy and I wanted to catch a drink and small app before heading home. He was upset because after waiting 10 minutes we are led to a nearly empty room to our seats to which he states ""we had to wait to be seated in an empty room?"" I shrugged and we ordered our drinks and appetizers. The food was alright  nothing exceptional and our waitress was nice but didn\'t seem too knowledgable about how to be a server as we kept trying to get her attention for the check. In addition a faux pas resulting in a marinara cup to fall and splatter on my boyfriends pants with no real notice of where it spilled from her didn\'t help. I wouldn\'t have any desire to go back here again. Not worth the $40 spent."
Rew C.,Santa Rosa  CA,1151,538,721,3/7/2013,3.0,"Let me start with - for a chain restaurant  I like this place. The staff is very friendly and I was hoping to mention their names but have now forgotten. They pour a good cocktails and if you can\'t find something on their vast menu - then you\'re in trouble. Also - they have the calorie count on their dishes which is super appreciated. Problem is their ""Veggie Burger"" is ...........wait for it....................1200 CALORIES...........WTH - I mean What The Heck (family friendly). That is outrageous  of the the great female bartenders told me it\'s good - covered in butter is why it\'s good. Ugh - that\'s annoying. Salads are very good - and if you don\'t mind the calories  burgers  fries  standard bar food is above average in my opinion. But Don\'t be on a Diet here. There aren\'t enough points on the Weight Watchers system to cover this food. Oh yeah - that veggie burger is all you\'re allowed to eat today at 112 points. ;o)"
Rick T.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,1,,1/26/2016,2.0,Great beer but service not so fast Had to sit for over an hour to get served. Actually sitting here waiting for food and getting more disappointed
Robin S.,Sebastopol  CA,0,6,,2/18/2016,4.0,This place does great burgers and cheap beers on a Thursday (3.50 a pint I think). Can't complain about the service.
Cheri B.,Windsor  CA,49,14,5,1/20/2016,3.0,The reviews made this place sound horrible. My friend and I went there Friday night. I had a side salad and calamari  Candi had the salmon. Both dishes were OK. Her wine was overpriced but the margarita  I had  was good and the price was no better or worse then any other sports bar. If you're looking for a quiet place  do NOT go to a sports bar! BJ's is no different  very loud with everyone trying to talk over the TV's AND each other. I think the worst part of the evening? Oh myyy  the waiter was  borderline  intrusive  he literally stopped by the table 15 times. (I counted). LOL.. Anyway  I'm sure he meant well  or maybe he liked Candi  but  honestly  let people enjoy their meal. I would recommend and I will go again  so in the end  that's all that really matters.
Sara V.,Norwalk  CA,3,2,1,1/31/2014,5.0,I'm glad that I base my visit to BJs solely on the fact that I really like the food otherwise I think with our visit to Santa Rosa we could have picked something that was unique to the city.I'm extremely please with the service we received this visit. Being from southern California you really learn to respect what some servers have to go through with rude people.. I think I received the best service that I have ever received. The server was able to keep up with my sarcasm. Wish I remembered his name but he had the most interesting beard. Food was awesome as usual the service was great and the location reminded me of home.
Adriana R.,Windsor  CA,0,2,,8/17/2016,1.0,I've always had amazing experiences at this BJ's but today had by far been the worse. We called ahead to make a reservation for 8:00 pm for a party of 10. We got there at 7:45 checked for a table and they said it would be ready by 8:15. An hour later we still weren't seated. There was also another party of about 9 who had NOT made a reservation and were seated before us. Not to mention the hostess (short blonde girl) was really rude and was the one who gave us misleading information. If I could I would rate you guys ZERO stars. Terrible experience never coming back.
Kevin J.,San Francisco  CA,11,27,483,2/25/2015,4.0,One of my favorites in Santa Rosa  yes its corporate  yes its cheese cake factoryish  but they have great happy hours (10pm-12am everyday  and any time there's an NFL game on). Great food  fun ambiance- you know that place that you sit there at the bar and you could imagine yourself anywhere? I like to pretend I'm in Vegas while I sit there eating my pot stickers with estancia cab.
Don S.,Santa Rosa  CA,14,13,,6/13/2014,5.0,Let me preface this by saying that we prefer to dine in at local small businesses  at least in part due to better customer service. But I felt compelled to write this review after eating at BJ's last night because they literally blew my expectations away. We'd visited the Santa Rosa location a few times previously  and had mostly positive experiences. But last night started off poorly  as our server told us that my wife's pizza took a detour from the oven to the floor on the way to our table. Cooper apologized and offered us a cup of chowder on the house  which we reluctantly accepted. He then said he'd see about comping us the pizza  which we said was unnecessary - accidents happen  right? Well  shortly afterwards the manager came over to apologize about the pizza which she said would be free of charge  and to let us know if she could do anything else. And when a third person who brought over the newly created pizza got to our table  he apologized for the inconvenience. If you're counting at home  that's three apologies from three different people and a free pizza for an accident that we didn't think was a big deal. Wow. Cooper then told us about how to save even more money by installing the BJ's app on our phones and paying for our meals on it  and enthusiastically helped us through the process. As we were about to leave I thanked him again and told him that they didn't have to do all that they did for us regarding the pizza  and he genuinely remarked that it was his pleasure to work for such a positive place that encourages their employees to think about their guests first. Admittedly  this was a somewhat unusual experience  and your results may vary. But I don't think I've ever been treated better at a restaurant  so I just wanted to give out some kudos. Oh  and the food was pretty good  too!
Lori C.,Healdsburg  CA,2,13,,6/3/2015,1.0,"This is the third time we\'ve tried this BJs  and this will be the last. The last two times proved the food was so-so but it\'s close to our place  so we gave it another shot.We were seated after a few minutes  then we waited another 20... and then left. No one acknowledged us  no drinks  not even a ""hello  I\'ll be with you."" We were not the only table ignored like this. Badly run  mediocre food  poorly staffed.... I can only imagine they have business because they\'re riding on the coattails of other  better managed BJs."
Leia R.,Santa Rosa  CA,15,3,1,2/8/2016,2.0,I'm disappointed in the customer service. We call to make a reservation which we have more than 7 people and we are then told you don't make same day reservations. I'm making it 8 hours in advance then tell me to use the app which isn't really a reservation. So I can have a party of 8 waiting for an hour. No thanks. I will start taking my business elsewhere. Btw- we were choosing to celebrate my birthday at your restaurant. I will not be recommending your restaurant in the future
elizabeth a.,Palo Alto  CA,13,18,96,2/7/2016,4.0,Personal quick service. Sign up for the rewards program.Great selection of yummy and thirst quenching options.
Brittany M.,San Diego  CA,2,20,,8/6/2016,1.0,Came in today when the restaurant was slow figuring it wouldn't be a long process and ordered my meal. 30min later im wondering why I haven't gotten our meals and where our server went  instead the manager comes up and acknowledges the long wait time and just says it's coming soon. No discount or nothing offered to make up for the Long wait time and no reason was explained either. I was not impressed with my visit and my friend ended up late to work due to it. we ended up paying on the mobile app and leaving asap. Come here when you have all day to spend
Happy H.,Cotati  CA,0,14,3,1/3/2016,2.0,"Walked in in a rainy day  the hostess\' had about 4 staff there  but not even one of them could be bothered to make eye contact or greet their customers. Despite that  I waited and got a seat. the waitress was actually super nice and friendly but yet it felt very corporate; nothing like a smaller restaurant  but I guess that is part of the ""appeal"". Regarding the meal  I ordered cherry glazed salmon - do not order this unless you like your salmon to taste like kids cough syrup. Hands down most disgusting salmon of my life. I ate one bite and left the rest on my plate. Waitress didn\'t even take it off the bill. My husband had bison burger and it was just eh- not good  not bad. Our child had the smiley fries  and these are horrible. Everything else was just mediocre. I won\'t be going back."
Shauna f.,San Francisco  CA,6,111,547,8/24/2013,4.0,Somewhat of an upscale chain restaurant . My favoite are the burgers. Meaty and big. Servers are knowlegable on menu items. Good value for the price.
Kandis N.,Santa Rosa  CA,5,17,2,11/20/2014,1.0,"It was my first time going here.  The place was spacious and the pizookie or whatever it\'s called is good and those are the only good things I can say about this place.  As for everything else....1- our 1st waiter was a nice enough guy but never even asked me if I wanted a drink when we got to the table (we came a little while after others)2- he seemed to stay away from our table more than a server should3- he didn\'t seem to really know his menu4- reached past our faces several times without saying a word5- brought a horribly plated dish to the table with hardly any food when it was simply ordered with no pilaf rice. (Never asked/ offered a sub) When he was called on the dish appearance he took it back  took 10 min to come back with an explanation that they were out of something (later to find they don\'t even offer that something anymore)6- brought their nasty special brew beer for the mistake  didn\'t ask the youngsters at the table for ID  then asked if more of us wanted to try it (this was before we tasted it)   we said yes and he never brought it.7- when asked for boxes he never came back to the table! Second waiter1- creeped by the table looked like a weirdo  circled back on the other side of the aisle and then came leaned his belly over the edge of the table and asked if everything was ok2- when asked what happened to the other waiter he states that he ""had to leave"". We thought he got fired or something! He says no he was just sent home due to labor because the management wants to watch labor costs so he will be our new server. 3- he also reaches in front of our faces without a word  then gets rude when asked why he keeps doing that without saying ""excuse me"".4- when he brought the boxes  finally  he waits until we all put our food in the containers and stands there grabbing plates until the table is mostly empty. 5- Offers desert by stating ""since you\'re boxing your food you guys probably don\'t want a desert..."" 6- we order a pizookie after what seemed like we had to beg him to tell us what flavors they had. I know this sounds like a long evening at this place and it was  trust me. After all this we wanted to speak to the manager of course. 1- he listened  said they both were NOT new servers  apologized half heartedly  then offers to fix the bill taking the ruined dish off. 2- had an attitude about the whole thing3- could be seen (not far away) speaking harshly to the 1st server  then barely saying anything to the 2nd.The ""fixed"" bill still came to almost $100 even though we ordered no alcohol  expensive plates  and mostly all drank water. By far the WORST experience I\'ve ever had at a restaurant.  It wasn\'t all that clean either.  They moved tables to accommodate a large party and food was under all the tables they moved. We will never be going back to say the least."
J L.,Modesto  CA,1,41,9,12/9/2014,4.0,Little noisy but food was good  no wait at 630 at nite that was a good thing. The waitress was great  took our order of 5 people and nailed it. It was exactly as ordered.Parking was a bugger but not a deal breaker
Richard M.,Saint Helena  CA,37,15,21,12/1/2014,2.0,We we're disappointed to say the least. The service was good but the food was a real let down from the last time we came. I ordered the bread bowl broccoli chedder soup and it came with less then a spoonful deep of soup in it and my girlfriend ordered the shrimp scampi pasta and it was overcooked to the point the noodles were crunchy. The Jeremiah Red Irish Style Ale was good though!
Brad L.,Vallejo  CA,58,118,4,4/14/2014,1.0,I have eaten at BJ's in the past. I never thought they were amazing but they were one of the better chains. When I was eating with large groups of people or in a work setting BJ's could usually cater well enough to the group to work. My last trip to BJ's was a terrible dining experience in every way and I will not be adding them to my list of places that I refuse to eat.I went for a work birthday lunch with a group of 6 people total. We were seated promptly because the place was half empty. It took 15 minutes for our waitress to arrive the first time and get our drink order. 20 minutes later she returned with our drinks and to take our lunch order. At this point two people decided not to eat because that had appointments in the afternoon and could not wait any longer. We watched as two other tables got up and walked out without having received any food.I ordered a burger (because how bad can a burger be?). About 20 minutes after we ordered the first batch of food came. So now half of the group watched as the other half of the group ate. No one wanted to risk waiting because we had no idea how long everything would take. 10 minutes later the rest of the food came with my burger. The burger was burnt  missing half of the toppings  and the toppings it did have were wilted lettuce and burnt bacon. I told the waitress to take it back and not bother to bring another one because I did not want to wait and did not want to bother with what ever they sent next. Three minutes later she returns with a new burger. This burger was obviously meant for someone else but they just scrapped off the other topping and try to recreate my burger. It still had bits of cheese and chili sticking too it. The process of being mangled by the kitchen staff doing who knows what had left it looking like wet cat food. Overall it was one of the most unappetizing looking things I have ever been served in a restaurant. I flagged the waitress down and sent it back again.The manger came over and made some halfhearted attempt to apologize. She would be better serviced in the kitchen monitoring the quality of the food that was coming out. Nothing that was served was great and much of it was wrong and/or poorly prepared. Based on our conversation with her we were not the first table to complain that day.
Al J.,San Jose  CA,14,45,3,5/23/2015,1.0,This place is a disaster. The front desk staff let 5 families that came after us  get seated before us. I finally spoke up and we were seated. Then it took 15-20 minutes for someone to come take our order  and 30 min for our food to come out. They only brought half the order and 10-15 minutes later the rest of the food came. My shrimp pasta was inedible. Nobody came to check on us or get us refills on our drinks  we had to flag someone down to get us the tab  and waited 20 minutes for them to charge my card. I wanted to just get up and leave since we didn't even eat our food. The staff and food are both equally terrible and the management is clueless. Half the people here had an upset and agitated look on their face but nobody seemed to care. Won't come back.
Gary A.,Santa Rosa  CA,109,234,46,11/19/2012,4.0,Food is good but not great as are the beers. It is clean and well light. Service is consistent.My wife and I were there last weekend. They made a few errors. Really  nothing terrible -- just some human errors and it was really busy. I was not even going to complain. The manager came over to our table and comped our bill.Three stars for food.Four stars for beer and service.Five stars for making good on small errors.
Allen S.,Vacaville  CA,1,10,2,1/10/2016,3.0,Too often I go with my wife and kids to only be disappointed with the service and food. If it's not one its the other. Tonight we went and the server came by after waiting 8 minutes.. He even said his priority was a party/group (in his words own words). Asked for the rib eye steak medium well and got it more medium rare in a couple places. I'm just done going here for a while with the constant missed opportunities they have.
Jenn S.,Sebastopol  CA,1,20,3,5/2/2015,1.0,This place is horrible!! We've tried several times and each time is a bigger disappointment!I ordered pasta with shrimp that was supposed to have broccoli- apparently they ran out but didn't tell me! Basically I got noodles with a little olive oil and some sun dried tomatoes thrown in. The shrimp were so overlooked you couldn't chew them. Never again will we eat here! I cannot believe this place stays in business. Also  our waitress never once asked me if I'd like a refill on my water that sat empty the entire time we were seated at our table!
Christopher K.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,33,6,5/30/2016,4.0,Went here for grandson's birthday April 6  2016. He ordered the rootbeer BBQ ribs and was in total ecstasy. Hamburgers were great. No complaints from anyone of party of 6.
Melissa H.,Rohnert Park  CA,37,93,7,8/7/2012,2.0,"I have been to BJ\'s a few times now  the first time I went was when they had just opened. The service was terrible but I let it slide because I knew they were still getting into their rythym and they were so new. After that first time I was so dissapointed with the service and the food as just average that I wanted to write a bad review but I opted to try a few more times. I\'ve gone 3 times now.I\'ll start with what I don\'t like:The prices seem very overpriced for many things. I wasn\'t really wowed with anything that I can say was really worth the price. Once I went with my coworkers to ""happy hour"" which is very expensive. It\'s only $1 off drinks (mind you  these drinks are like $10 or $11 dollars) and $2 off appetizers (anywhere from $9-$15) wow what a not so happy hour priced happy hour! We ended up paying $33 a person for 2 drinks each and a couple appetizers that we shared. We might as well have gotten dinner instead!! I kept on hearing things about how awesome the avocado egg rolls are. We ordered them. All they tasted like was warm avocado in a deep fried egg roll crust with a sweet sauce to dip them in. In the picture these look like they aren\'t just pure avocado deep fried. Things I did like:The lunch menu has very well priced lunches and they are pretty good. I had this chicken with mashed potatoes and a gravy served in corn. Only $6 The calamari was tasty and so was the dipping sauce it comes with. But then again  how do you go wrong with calamari? The restaurant is large  spacious  and everything looks very nice (I\'d hope so  since it\'s new)The Pizookies are tasty  but it\'s not an out of this world  best dessert I have ever tasted experience like it is made out to be.All in all  I won\'t avoid the place but if it\'s between BJ\'s and Russian River brewery or 3rd street ale works  I\'ll choose for either one of these in a heartbeat. I truly feel like BJ\'s is simply Applebee\'s on steroids with a much much larger and diverse menu and way more expensive."
Caine H.,Alameda  CA,81,60,117,9/10/2014,4.0,I'm a big fan of BJ's PM Porter dark ale. The food is pretty good. Typical chain restaurant style. Good portions. Tasty. Can't complain.
Marina T.,Cotati  CA,284,243,701,8/1/2012,4.0,Service has gotten much better at this location!
Alexa M.,Santa Rosa  CA,3,18,5,6/4/2015,1.0,I ate here for my sisters rehearsal dinner. The food was terrible. Burger Kings food tastes better than there food. Don't eat here you will regret it and it will cost you a lot of money. I would give them no stars if I could. I regret eating there food.
Sandra C.,Burlingame  CA,0,17,,6/2/2015,1.0,Just... Don't waste your time here. Food is okay (as up to par with any other bjs location) Service is absolutely terrible. If you're in coddingtown mall  I'd recommend trying out one of the other new restaurants next door :)
Jasmine P.,Windsor  CA,0,6,5,11/18/2016,1.0,service sucks everyday of the week! but the pazookis are bomb & some of their food is too.
Cassie H.,Smith River  CA,50,22,5,9/30/2015,5.0,Waitress was very nice and attentive. The outdoor patio was heated  which is nice for those who get cold easy. Niece had chicken fettuccine Alfredo and said the chicken was on the dry side  but she liked her meal anyways. Our pizza was loaded with toppings! The manager did us right by giving us free appetizer due to a mistake with our order. I would go back!
Karen L.,Santa Rosa  CA,38,180,1198,6/14/2013,2.0,Let me begin by saying I am not a fan of chain restaurants. So to be fair this place lived up to the expectations... it was OK for it's intended purpose.I think it is a great place to sit and enjoy a cold beer or cocktail as they have a full bar and craft their own beers. It is also nice to have a place to grab a quick bit after 9pm as this is a rare commodity in Sonoma County. The service is hit or miss; the food is as well. I prefer the BJ's in San Rafael but in a pinch would visit this location.
Fernando F.,Redwood City  CA,2,32,2,11/27/2015,2.0,Had lunch with my wife and children. The kids macaroni and cheese was clearly reheated. We had the lunch special and it was sad. The salad that came with our meal was limp and wilting. The service was ok  but the food was just sad. Anyone can make a pizza  its easy and very difficult to screw up. But when the other dishes are lacking quality (reheated mac and cheese...really) something is going wrong in that kitchen. Stay away  go somewhere worth the tasting experience and value. Just because there is a big screen tv in every nook and cranny of the place am I not supposed to observe what I'm eating or are those just distractors? hmmm.
Dean T.,Roseburg  OR,21,80,6,4/28/2013,3.0,I was first exposed to BJ Brewhouse in Cupertino down the street from DeAnza College. When I lived out there I used to go to this place all the time. Their food is good  the service was fast  and the beers are awesome. So naturally when I heard BJ was opening a location here in Santa Rosa I was thrilled.BJ Brew House in Coddingtown is a far cry from my normal positive experience. Food quality remains consistent  but if you were a wine grape  you would die on the vine waiting for you food cause it took forever. (Both times  over 60 minutes)Another observation I made pertained to the cooks who began walking through the dinning area. I couldn't help but notice all the gang tattoos which was more than discerning. You would think their hiring practices would be better than a place like KFC; so seeing that was a surprise.
Danny W.,Salt Lake City  UT,27,239,7,10/25/2015,3.0,typical brew house and typical food. Nothing great with this place but not bad. Its what you should expect for a normal brewhouse. Its ok thats all.
Joyce S.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,5,1,6/27/2016,5.0,Just had the Santa Fe Salad with blackened salmon a few days ago. It was fantastic!
Kevin J.,San Francisco  CA,2486,870,340,5/21/2012,2.0,BJ's isn't a bad spot for another Cheesecake factory chain. Unfortunately this place just opened and even though hiccups are expected I would hope seasoned professionals would be hired... that wasn't the case. Once our table of 7 was seated comfortably and orders placed we waited... and waited... and waited until eventually service kind of stopped for us. The servers(yes multiple) had failed to check up on us knowing that they had failed at providing excellent customer service. The food eventually came - about 45 mins after orders were placed and we all ate happily. That is  except me. I ordered a Thai mango chicken salad and the dressing was forgotten. After waiting another 15 minutes or so I was able to reach someone to get me some dressing. After about 20mins once the food was consumed my stomach didn't feel all that well. I can't say it was food poisoning but let's just say my stomach was not happy with BJs.For the most part all servers had pleasant smiles but at the end of the day a smile can only go so far. Nothing was comped  nor expected to be. I was asked if I was finished with my plate and before I could mutter a yes the server throw a napkin in my dish and began to pick up my plate. Nerves much?I will probably go back to BJs again for some birthday gathering or late-night drinking but as for the food  I think once was enough.
Mindy S.,Santa Rosa  CA,33,2,,3/26/2015,1.0,The refused to serve a gay teenage and his family cause he is gay. I am protesting their restaurant. Hope you close and go bankrupt.
Mike O.,San Francisco  CA,246,219,13,9/18/2015,5.0,Wade and the staff. Thank you for giving back to the friends and loved ones of the Valley Fire. It's now our turn to give back. Also. Great food. Friendly staff and a cool outdoor patio.
Kaitlyn W.,Santa Rosa  CA,7,10,7,5/10/2012,5.0,I went to the Coddingtown BJ's last night for a pre opening dinner. Sat at the bar  since that's where my BF was working. Had the BJ's Blonde  and the BJ's Raspberry Cider. Very good and refreshing (and only $4.25 each!) For the meal I got the shrimp taco's (on the menu for $8.95) and my friend got the Parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes ($13.50) Both meals were AMAZING! Cooked perfectly  definitely not frozen  all freshly cooked. Got the pizookie trio with 3 different cookies. Couldn't finish them since we were full  but they were warm  gooey amazingness. For you who don't know what a pizookie is  it is a made to order cookie baked in it's own little pan  topped with a scoop of ice cream.(I think it was $8.50 for all 3)At the bar  they have 1 big TV screen which is split into 4 different screens. As a big baseball fan  major plus. Music was a little loud for my liking  but it was good mixture of music (80's  90's  now)Definitely will be going back to keep trying all the BJ's beers  watch baseball  and enjoy the food.
Mike H.,Mountain View  CA,29,50,39,6/1/2015,2.0,Something wrong with this location. We normally enjoy the food especially gluten free options at BJs. This location seems to be clueless about gf and the menu items we did have ranged from okay to unedible.
Teri R.,Santa Rosa  CA,54,149,15,5/23/2012,2.0,Went here last Sunday with the family. I ordered the deep dish pizza  my husband ordered the french dip  someone else ordered the turkey burger and my niece got a pasta dish. We ordered the pizookie as well. The pizza was definitely NOT deep dish at all! It was pretty tasteless.Everyone else said their food was okay. Nothing was good  just edible. Service was also slow.Cannot for the life of me understand the five stars some people gave this place. It is very mediocre (at best.)
Heidi L.,Santa Rosa  CA,14,19,7,3/9/2015,1.0,"I seriously wish I had read the reviews before coming here!!My husband and I were shopping and decided to stop in to BJs for a late lunch on Saturday 03/07/15. It appears to be a pretty popular place and we have seen multiple friends ""check-in"" at this location on Facebook. When we arrived I asked the host if we could sit on the patio  he told me ""let me check if we have a clean table available"". He quickly returned to lead us outside. He brought us to a disgusting table! The table itself was wiped clean but the seats were covered in crumbs and the floor underneath was coated in mac n cheese! My husband and I looked at each other like ""seriously"" and couldn\'t help but to laugh a little. We were shocked! When I pointed out how dirty it was he said ""let me grab someone to clean that"" ...wasn\'t that what he had gone to check on before he lead us out there? We now were standing there awkwardly waiting for someone to come clean up the mess. Even the people already seated were shocked and a couple seated nearby even commented to us about gross it was. When someone came over to ""clean up"" he swept the seats with the same broom he used on the floor  GROSS! We asked to be seated at another table down the way a bit which was also dirty but at least the floor and seats were semi-decent. He quickly cleaned the table up and apologized to us and even he seemed surprised that the host brought us out there. I felt in my gut that we should have left at that moment  however we stayed. Mistake! We ordered drinks  mine was a Mocktail since I\'m pregnant and it was fine. My husband ordered a BJs Mojito and it tasted like limeaid  it was EXTREMELY weak. My mocktail tasted stronger lol  I actually had to double check with the waitress that there was no alcohol in it. We let the waitress know that his drink was weak and she suggested an additional shot and he happily accepted ...but she charged us for it! Seriously? We then ordered a good amount of food and my reviews of it follows: Calamari - it was ok  not very crispy and a little limp. Carnitas Fries - soggy soggy soggy. Bison burger - the patty tasted like anything but what a bison burger should taste like. It was more like a pre-frozen grocery store patty or something you could get at Burger King  YUCK! We also ordered the spinach stuffed mushrooms - this was the only plate that was good  they were very good and I wish everything else had been too. Our waitress was pleasant  she seemed a little shy and reserved but very sweet. I honestly feel like our experience there was crap  and that\'s putting it lightly. I am not one to cause a scene in a public place so we left her a cash tip and went on our way peacefully. I have since written an email to BJs for review and I have requested a FULL REFUND!! I paid $60.19 for a crap meal and dirty tables. I do not want to be offered a gift card or free meal on BJs I simply want my money back! We left feeling completely grossed out and we have zero plans to ever return!! BLAH! I wish I could give ZERO STARS!!"
John G.,Santa Rosa  CA,3,17,13,5/23/2014,3.0,We're gluttons for punishment. Like the food and the beer. The service is usually terribly slow. Let's hope this time is better.Part 2. Waited over 40 minutes for food. After we got the food realized we had no silverware. Not even that busy tonight.
Andrea H.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,15,2,12/11/2015,1.0,Very disappointed. First time I went I had to wait for an hour to get seated. Tonight I thought I would try it again via curb side and ended up with a very hard gluten free pizza and a hamburger that was good but they forgot the fries. I don't think I will ever go back. Just not worth the disappointment when there are so many other great restaurants in town.
Stephanie V.,Windsor  CA,143,261,388,9/13/2012,3.0,Had a good experience here. It's loud. It's packed. It's HUGE. I didn't know this was a chain restaurant. Husband recently went to a BJ's in Pleasanton and while he didn't RAVE about the food  he had a good time. I was curious  and recently learned that they'd opened at Coddingtown  so we went.I ordered the grilled steak salad. I asked for the steak to be cooked medium  and it was. Otherwise  it would have been cooked medium-well. ?!?!? Blech. The salad was dressed nicely  and there were grilled veggies and roasted potatoes in it. I pigged out and ate the whole thing. It could easily have been lunch the next day too.Husband got the chicken club and was quite happy with it. Daughter got the grilled cheese and loved it. The kid's menu is ok  but instead of offering sticky rice (WTH?) they should just offer plain ol' steamed white rice  and brown rice too. We didn't get appetizers and we just drank water so our bill was reasonable. Our waiter was wonderful and offered us a card that has anywhere between a $5 - $500 value on it. Won't know until we go back (and THAT  my dear  is how they get ya!).I can see us going back for some apps and a couple drinks. And who knows... maybe we'll have $500 credit there...
Kessalia W.,Hopland  CA,12,26,2,5/17/2015,2.0,I love BJ's. Just not THIS one. The Santa Rosa BJs is consistently mediocre. We have been here quite a few times  had a negative experience  forgotten about it over time  and returned.This will be the last time. There are plenty of other BETTER places to eat nearby.Tonight was my husband  son and myself. First off  they said it would be about a 5 minute wait. Everyone who came in after us was seated right iff  I thought 'wow a lot of people must be using their app to call ahead'... but no  they apparently forgot about us  so it was closer to 10 minutes.They took us over to a table (not a booth  but I didn't voice my preference) and didn't ask if my 2 year old needed a high chair or booster  but luckily he was fine in a chair. We ordered a pizza  since they usually are pretty good. Not so much this time  but whatever. We also ordered a BOWL of clam chowder for a ridiculous $6.50. Usually just get the cup  but we were hungry and wanted to share. It looked like they dumped the cup into a bowl; it was not a lot of soup for that price. When the pizza finally came  they had to find some plates for us  and only brought 2. So we had to ask for another for the kid. We also asked for some ranch to dip the crusts in  and they brought ONE tiny cup for the 3 of us... smhSo sorry about the rambling essay  but we've wasted enough money giving this BJ's multiple chances for redemption. I'd suggest finding someplace else to go. There's a Chipotle next door  and a Dim Sum place down the street we'll go to next time we're in town.
Mike S.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,1,,6/3/2016,3.0,If there is one thing that I do not like about restaurants it is inconsistency in food quality.One time it is great and then you have the same dish next time and it is awful.That is how BJ's Santa Rosa is.For example the clam chowder in a bread bowl.The first two times that I ordered it I claimed it was better than Boudin.The last two times I got very little chowder one time and watery chowder the last and final time I will ever order it.On 6/1/2016 my wife and I returned once more.I ordered the lemon thyme chicken and she got broccoli soup and salad.The chicken in my dish was tough and dry.Except for that it was good.Broccoli was non existent in her soup and her salad was wilted.If you want great atmosphere this is the place to come.If you are going for the food  good luck !
Holly G.,Petaluma  CA,1,14,,5/19/2015,2.0,Okay food. Very expensive for quality and service. I only go for pizookie. I went there for lunch today. There wasn't a big crowd but it is always so loud in there. I can't even hear myself think. We order appetizers and had to ask to get plates. Not a big deal but a little silly. It took forever to get drinks filled. They took out appetizer order and disappeared for a while and finally came back to get our lunch order. Food came out fast. But then we needed to pay and go and our waiter took a long time to get out check. We had to track him down in order to pay.
Michael C.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,30,,11/13/2015,2.0,As far as the food and beer goes  it's no different than any other chain type place (Chili's  applebee's etc.) The atmosphere and interior is definitely a lot nicer which normally is enough to give it the edge compared to those other places. But this place has had pretty bad service every time I've been here which is 4 or 5 times at this point.To be clear though  most of the times it wasn't the waitresses fault. They were friendly and helpful they just seemed to be understaffed and asked to serve too many tables that were too far apart. So maybe it's a management issue here but definitely something they need to sort out.
David B.,Rohnert Park  CA,59,3,,9/16/2015,5.0,Four stars to BJ's not just because it is a good place for a meal and a pint. but because of their compassion and support for victims of the nearby Valley Fire as proven on Facebook: facebook.com/photo.php?f
Russ W.,Petaluma  CA,70,15,3,8/7/2015,5.0,I love the Jambalaya at BJs. Beer is always clean and their variety covers the gambit. I'm not into the whole sports bar thing but the food makes up for the atmosphere. Dining at the bar is fast and unencumbered. Great place to prep for a show at the JC.
Keith X.,Santa Rosa  CA,50,236,98,2/8/2014,2.0,Our group had someone come in late and the staff took her order late  but her food came out with the rest of ours  so that was handled well by not serving everyone but her. I ordered the Barbeque Bison Burger. The patty was too small. The bun was toasted  but it made it seem kind of stale. The fries were good.My friend ordered the thin fries and they were cold within a few minutes and didn't taste very well  so she ordered an additional order of potato wedge fries. Sucks when someone has to order an additional dish to fill up.My friend was in the bathroom when she saw a hostess leave a stall and exit the bathroom without washing her hands. Ick.
Mitchell B.,Petaluma  CA,0,5,,10/18/2015,2.0,Waited over an hour for food during an admittedly pretty busy Saturday night. Our waitress didn't check on us between ordering and receiving food. Eventually a manager came by and apologized (still no waitress) and confirmed that their kitchen was busy and was making our food (2 burgers and a French dip  nothing special)The food we received was lukewarm and they actually brought out the wrong kind of burger for my dad  but he wasn't going to wait again  so we all ate because we were very hungry at that point. When our waitress brought us the check  she acted like nothing bad had happened. No apology. The management did take off my dad's entire meal and reduced the price of the rest of the food/drink. While service from the waitress was poor and the kitchen was primarily to blame  the manager or supervisor who came by was professional and understanding of our annoyance. I work in food service too and I definitely understand the position he was in. He's the reason why I gave BJ's 2 stars. This was my first and probably last trip to BJ's. I've had better service and food at McDonald's.
Isabella M.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,5,,12/22/2013,5.0,"You ""1 star"" and ""2 star"" people need to relax. I agree that there are some individuals I have heard/seen at this particular BJ\'s that honestly should not work there  but they do  and hopefully in time they will either become better/more professional at their jobs  or simply move on. With that being said  I have never had a truly negative time at this BJ\'s. More than not  my family and I have had EXCELLENT experiences there  every time.Hostesses: There have been busier days where we have been quoted 30-45 minute wait times  and while unfortunate  those quote times have been pretty accurate. And I find it funny how people tend to chew-out those poor girls when it takes ""too long"" for their table to be ready. Do people expect them to ask the people eating at the tables to just stop eating  and leave? Managers are the ones who give the Hosts the quote times to give to us  so just try to relax. We have been seated by our hostesses who have always been friendly  some just quieter or more shy than others  but always kind. They do seem rushed at times  but remember when you were angry with them for taking too long to seat you? Well  they are rushing back to go seat all those other people who were angry too. Servers: I\'ve had not just one  but a few of THE best servers I\'ve ever experienced in my life at this BJ\'s. Always quick  even on horrendously busy evenings. Always smiling  always friendly  always knowledgeable  always on top of whatever we have needed  always one step ahead of us on refills  extra sauce  more napkins  etc. And like I said  this has come from MORE than just one server I\'ve experienced.Food: Huge portions and so many options along with very reasonable prices. Not too sure what so many people seem to have an issue with. My boyfriend\'s food came out a bit too cold for him  once  and our server had it re-heated right away  and all was well.So before people get turned-off from going to this BJ\'s  I highly suggest that you go in and give it a try. Especially if you  for whatever reason  did NOT have a good experience there before  just try again at least one more time. Sometimes it\'s a person\'s attitude that can make all the difference in a situation.5 of 5 stars. Keep up the great work BJ\'s in Coddingtown :)"
Melissa B.,Hopland  CA,0,8,,12/21/2015,5.0,"I really don\'t understand all the negative reviews for this place. I imagine they\'re from people who have either never worked in the service industry  or are just overly difficult to begin with. My husband and I tried this place for the first time last night and everything from food to service was tip top. We were promptly sat and greeted by our server Eli. He was super friendly and made several excellent recommendations for food and drinks. I had their royal soda and husband had a beer and cider mix  both super good. We ordered a deep dish pizza  which I was really impressed with. I don\'t usually like deep dish pizza because it\'s too saucy and soggy  but this one was perfect! In fact  it\'s still just as good the next day! We ordered a pizooki sampler  which was out of this world good. The total came to 53 dollars  which I feel is completely reasonable for how much food we got. Excellent atmosphere  service  and food. This place doesn\'t try to ""fancy"" everything up like most places in the area  and that\'s a really nice change of pace. Ignore the negative reviews and go try this place for yourself."
Renee j.,Sebastopol  CA,0,9,,9/30/2015,5.0,So glad to see BJ's finally get their act together! We tried them several times when they first opened. Service was awful! Food was always late and often cold. Angry customers everywhere. We vowed never to go back  but their menu is so varied we decided to try again after one year away. We are so happy we did! Our server was Angela. She was the bomb! She gave the right amount of attention and scheduled our courses as we like them  with a bit of space in between. We will be sure to ask for her section every time we go! Food was delicious and served warm! Further  it appears that they are really getting their act together. No disgruntled customers that we saw. Lots of people waiting. That's a good sign. We will be back!
Art B.,Santa Rosa  CA,42,188,9,10/26/2012,3.0,"BJ\'s is what it is. It is a big chain very comparable to the Cheesecake Factory crossed with a sports bar. Only the beer isn\'t really any good.The food is ok. Just ok. The service is professional. I liked the jambalaya on my first visit. Not bad for a chain. The ""handcrafted"" sodas here are terrible.But hey  them cookies with ice cream sure are good."
Kate H.,Santa Rosa  CA,109,9,2,7/31/2015,5.0,Mark was the best server ever. Replaced a hamburger that had aioli on it when we asked for no mayonnaise  and gave us a pazookie on the house. Attentive. Thanks :)
Alyssa M.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,133,12,2/26/2015,2.0,Not impressed. Nice decor  but that's it. All items we tried were unsuccessful attempts at taking a spin on a traditional dish. Avocado rolls were a great big mushy disaster  the lentil salad was a failure & the Mediterranean chicken pita was the taste of a tub of sour cream. Sorry not good enough to entertain again. Gave 2 stars only because of the nice decor  renovation & being clean otherwise too load to hold a conversation & you leave starving cause the food you order was disgusting.
Ashlyn J.,Santa Rosa  CA,23,6,,12/14/2013,1.0,This place is a JOKE. We went in on a Saturday evening with 4 other people. We called ahead and then waited (not long) for our table. That was the best part of our experience. The girl who waited on us was really nice and friendly but was as slow as can be. We decided to be understanding (I am a server myself) because it was so busy and sometimes people get overwhelmed. We were celebrating my sister in laws 21st birthday. our drinks took 25 minutes to come out and she set the tray on the table and admitted that she had no clue what drink was which. We had to tell her. She claimed since she wasn't 21 she didn't know..I'm sorry  but who on earth hires a server that doesn't know their drink menu?! Our food came out probably 35 minutes after our drinks..However there was no silverware. Being nice we all ate our freaking food with our hands. She came by when the meal was done and finally refilled our waters (that had been empty almost the entire time). My fiancee picked up the check for everyone...nope the nightmare isn't over. SHE SWITCHED OUR CARD WITH SOMEONE ELSE! We went Christmas shopping after and realized the card he had was NOT the card he gave our server. Tired and pissed off we went BACK to BJ's and spoke to the manager. She had no clue what to do. I don't blame her considering I have never seen this happen. We gave her our info and asked for her to comp the charges on OUR card and the other card considering they weren't our charges to begin with. She comp'd the food but insisted it was against the law to comp alcohol (it's not). We were really nice and tried not to be those rude people everyone hates in a restaurant. We recommended that they put more servers on on busy nights since our poor server seemed so in over her head. She told us that each server only has three table sections! THREE! How do you not give perfect service?! There is a pattern of horrible servers at this place. I don't even blame the servers. BJ's needs to do a way better job at training their employees. This USED to be a place we would frequent. We will not be returning. I'd give zero stars but then I couldn't leave a review.
Erika Y.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,107,3,3/23/2015,1.0,I don't know how its even possible that every single time I come here they mess up our order! the only thing they do right is the dessert. Don't think ill be coming back again! Cheesecake Factory is a lot better. worth the extra $$$
Liz W.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,14,1,6/23/2014,2.0,My experience at this restaurant was horrible to say the least. The wait to get in was very long  the table was dirty when we got there  the waitress completely abandoned us  and the food was mediocre. I would not return. I ordered stuffed mushrooms and a roast beef dip sandwich. My partner ordered buffalo wings and a dessert. Everything tasted great but it was not worth the wait. We spent two hours in the restaurant and only ordered these few things. The rest of the time was waiting for service. Just to underscore my main point; do not bother with this restaurant.
Sarah F.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,7,,10/26/2016,1.0,Frustrating is putting it mildly. I went in there last week with my boyfriend ordered drinks and appetizers they came with no problem. The waiter took our food order and before we knew it  it was 30 minutes later and still no food. The manager on shift that night came to our table and said that our dinner order was lost. Well the waiter never put our order in. They DID NOT COMP us anything. And we never got our food. We still had to pay for our drinks and appetizers!!! So We thought we would give it another try and we took my son with us tonight to dinner. We ordered our drinks  appetizers  and our dinner all at the same time. We were seated at 8 pm at 8:45 the waiter came to our table with half of our order. My boyfriend got his dinner as well as my son. She said that my chicken wings were not ready yet and she would bring them right out. Well that took anther 10 minute's while I watched my son and boyfriend eat there meal and finish their meal here came my chicken wings. Well I told the waiter to keep them I didn't want them. She took them off our tab and apologized. They need to get their SH*T together in that kitchen and restaurant!!!! VERY Disappointed!!!!!
M E.,Santa Rosa  CA,35,57,28,12/14/2013,3.0,Ummm yeah if you like bacon  blue cheese  tomatoes and onions... this wedge salad will knock your socks off!!! It's kinda small  so no sharesies  hands off my salad!! Don't forget to order the deep fried artichokes but make sure they arrive piping hot  they taste muuuch better hot. Seasonal pumpkin ale rocks and surprisingly the pizza crust is pretty bomb. Yup noisy too. Do I mind? Nah  I sit in the bar so I miss out on all the fun of being ignored by busy servers. The food is pretty good but I agree with an earlier review the the avocado roll is pretty freaking awful. This coming from a gal who eats them whole. Smeh. If you happen to order the Mahi Tacos  ask them to either lightly toast the tortilla or not at all  if you leave it as is  it comes out pretty stiff and chewy. Service tonight was spot on. First times a charm. Fortunately most nights I go out  I'm not in a rush  so I don't mind much if service is slower. But I do have to admit that it hasn't always been great service or great food  but I do love love love the wedge salad so much I punish myself time and time again just to have it. But tonight paid off! Yippee!! The only thing that was missed was a spatula for they pizza. .. not too shabby! Come here prepared for the worst that way you'll never be disappointed! Mmmmm wedge. .. blue cheese. .. bacon. ..beer:)
Paul M.,Santa Rosa  CA,7,53,8,2/4/2014,2.0,Beer selection? Pretty good. House-made beers? Pretty tasty. Service. Oy vey. The  service is excruciatingly slow-- either they are terribly understaffed  or the servers just aren't properly trained. It took about 15 minutes of sitting and waiting before someone took our drink order  and another 15 minutes before someone took our food order. The food came out quickly  but it was underwhelming  and was really ruined by the lackluster service.
Alejandro M.,Santa Rosa  CA,3,10,,3/22/2015,2.0,Service is usually horrible food is ok nothin special. Just go here to drink a beer or two not to eat.
Krissy K.,Santa Rosa  CA,185,76,9,4/23/2014,4.0,I've been to this BJs before and have had awful experiences every time prior to this time. They must under new management because the restaurant has improved in every area. John M was our waiter and was fantastic  the food was delicious  and the service was great.
Kim L.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,4,3,10/13/2016,2.0,I hate writing bad reviews.....so usually I just don't but after tonight I am so over this place! I LOVED it when it first opened....now I can never seem to wait less than 45 min-1hr for food (MINIMUM). The food is OK  but not worth that kind of a wait....tonight the waitress forgot my drink like at least 4 times and in the end we had to say we needed to cancel our orders. The manager asked if he could check on it and then he could box it up to go and he would comp the whole bill...I am giving 2 stars because he DID comp the whole bill  but when he went back to check  he then pretty much disappeared  never came out to update us or anything. Then the runner came out with 1/2 the food not even boxed. When we told him we needed it boxed because we had to leave  they disappeared again...15 minutes later  we went up to ask and then suddenly they hand us our boxes....most insanely horrid service I think I've ever had! At this point  this was not the first time  not sure we will be going back again.
Kena M.,Fort Bragg  CA,36,3,,8/14/2015,5.0,I went here and we were greeted the waitress had a great attitude and it took us a while to figure out what we wanted and they gave us time. My aunt had the burger the bun was amazing except the bottom bun was a little soggy and she asked for grilled onions and she only got 4 tiny ones. My uncle got the sirloin and it was well done and PERFECT and for being the most hated vegetable the Brussels sprouts were amazing! I had the chicken Alfredo and the sauce was amazing and so creamy! And the bathrooms....... spelled looked and overall were really good! Overall: I would recommend this place and its right next to the mall!
Susan T.,Fulton  CA,2,10,16,6/12/2015,2.0,I ordered from the curbside pickup and ended up waiting 20 mins past the time it said my food would be ready online. Also they got my order wrong. In my opinion a little overpriced for what I got. The best part of my experience was the girl who brought the food to my car. She was very nice and apologetic for the wait!
Ariel G.,Santa Rosa  CA,6,8,2,8/3/2015,4.0,The pazookies here are amazing! Customer service here is pretty good  seems clean overall  just wish it wasn't so loud sometimes
Shiya D.,San Jose  CA,0,8,4,5/7/2015,1.0,"Worst service ever! After being told there was only 10 min wait we ended up waiting 20 mins. After getting seated and waiting another 15 mins only after I glared at every waitress walk by our table the ""manager"" came up to our table and noticed we had no plates  no drinks and no napkins. She offered to take our entire order  once we gave it her (she didn\'t write it down) we waited another 10 mins for our drinks. Once we get our drinks we  again you guessed it wait another 15 mins as we see our appetizer walk by and the server looking baffled as I signal to her if is our plate she carries it back to the kitchen and which by that point my husband and I don\'t even finish our drinks and walk out. Now mind you there is a server/busser whatever cleaning the table next to us whom I know hears us say that we are leaving and the service is just deplorable as we are saying it loud enough for her to hear. Her only reaction was look at me and role her eyes. Look I get things happen that are out of your control. Here is how I look at though  you have customer who DON\'T CARE! And you know why cause they came with money to pay your wages and not care about anything else. All you have do at that point is apologize and try to be as gracious as possible about any and all complications. It really isn\'t that hard to do. Unfortunately BJ\'s could care less about the customer there a big company and we are a dime a dozen. BJ\'s you big enough to get it together and figure it out cause at this point your gross."
Kim D.,Sebastopol  CA,0,34,1,5/5/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I really like this place a lot. It's close to my work  and thy have a gluten free menu. I think their GF pizza is fantastic  and if I've ever had a problem with anything it has been rectified immediately. If you're going to sit down inside  sometimes the service can be poor  which would be my only complaint. I always get mine to go  and it's always delicious!
Philip M.,Santa Rosa  CA,392,747,942,6/12/2012,3.0,Hamburgers are huge portions and delicious. The homemade root beer is also delicious. The steak wasn't very flavorful. kinda bland...could use more spices or flavoring.service is decent. waters and sodas were filled on consistent basis.Would I come here with friends for a celebration? yes. Would I come here for lunch/dinner just because I am hungry? most likely not.
Dane R.,Fairfield  CA,1,32,2,1/1/2015,5.0,I had a really nice lunch at BJ's with my wife and daughter. The portion sizes were very generous and delicious. Joaquin was our server and was fantastic. He was very attentive and checked back regularly to make sure everything was wonderful. Defiantly going back again.
Joseph T.,Santa Rosa  CA,51,37,,10/30/2014,1.0,Food is good  always hot... once you actually get it. Here's how to survive a trip to BJ's. Put your name on the list as soon as you can. Often we let one person out of the car and have them go put our name on the list while parking the car. Whatever you do  do NOT sit at the bar. The service at the bar is actually worse than on the main floor  which is pretty bad in its own right. When you put your name on the list tell them you do NOT wish to sit at the bar or in the bar area and insist on giving them your last initial too  or give them a funny name that won't be mistaken for someone else. I have in the past been skipped over  then given a table at the bar (which is first come first served)... so essentially I waited around for 30-45 minutes for nothing and was NOT comped any part of the meal nor felt like they properly apologized for their mistake. So give them a name they won't forget and can't be mistaken for someone else. They don't have little vibrating squares like most popular restaurants so unfortunately you will be forced to sit or stand while waiting for your table. I have a solution for that too. If you are not with your kids  go grab a drink at the bar and order an appetizer as well. If you order your appetizer at your table  more often than not it will delay your meal OR it will come out WITH your main course. If you do not intend to get an appetizer  at the very least you will be able to sit down in ear shot of the hostess and enjoy a beverage. HOWEVER  it gets VERY loud in there  so keep your wits about you as if they call your name and you do not hear it  they will seat someone else. The bar tender seems like the best service in that entire restaurant though. So it's easier to get a beer and an appetizer from him than your server  trust me there. When you do get seated  if you want water you will have to ask for it as they do not bring you water unless you ask for it. While you were waiting 20-45 minutes for your table  you should have been looking at the menu... that way the minute you see your waitress you can put in your order. It sometimes takes 5-10 minutes before you will see your server  and they will not come back as often as you'd like them to  so I would advise placing your drinks AND food order the very first time you see her. We've been there 4 times now  and each time figured some new way to minimize the time spent in the restaurant and/or waiting for service or food. Be prepared to spend 1-2 hours in that restaurant on average.These tips will help you survive BJ's of Santa Rosa. I've been to other BJ's down south  they are not all this bad. This particular one however has the worst service in any restaurant I've ever been in. The food is fantastic  the beer is pretty darn good too  but the service is terrible. 2/4 waitresses we've had did not look like they were happy to work there. I feel like this is due to the improper floor management or them being overworked. Often in a restaurant it is not your servers  but rather the management that should be looked at to solve all the issues I've listed above. Their disposition is most likely a representation of their frustration with poor management.Ways to improve BJ's. Online check in for waiting  little buzzer things  better management  and improved servers.
Mark R.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,1,,12/20/2015,1.0,We eat here about once a month  just tried there take out for the first and last time. I looked at the burger and thought it was a joke  they must have run out of lettuce and tomatoes  as we got a shriveled up piece of lettuce and two very tiny tomato ends  the burger was ordered well done they achieved this by poking the center of the meat so many times it wouldn't hold together. I paid with cash but the kid who took my money couldn't find a drawer to make change and nobody wanted to help him out  so after ten minutes more of waiting for change I hunted him down and gave him a credit card....what a joke of an experience. Not sure if I'll ever be back  they lost a very good customer.
Francine M.,Saint Helena  CA,11,7,2,3/20/2015,1.0,"If I could give no stars I would. Dirty dishes  greasy dishes  just gross. Food that was overcooked  undercooked and burned. Calamari was cold and rubbery. The spaghetti was hard and cold and the""melted"" cheese was hard and cold. The stuffed mushrooms were raw. The soup had this film on it that was just gross. The rice under the salmon was hard  and dried out. Ended up walking out and the manager contemplated actually charging us for the meal that was to gross to eat. It will be a loooong time before we return. Numerous people were returning food tonight. Food was going back left and right."
Mitchell M.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,2,1,6/28/2015,4.0,I really love the food here and the service is top notch! I've had the burgers  pizza and chicken Alfredo pasta. All were amazing. My one and only gripe is the price. For my daughter  my wife and myself the bill always ends up being around 60 dollars. No appetizers or deserts and no one is ordering the steak and lobster. I highly recommend.
Christina N.,San Jose  CA,9,63,15,10/9/2014,1.0,This is the worst BJs I've been to. The food did not taste as it should  we ordered 3-4 dishes and we couldn't eat half because we were so repelled by the taste. And these are dishes that we've ordered before at other BJs as well. Not to mention our server had a busboy completely clear our table before we even received our pizookies  we did not have anything to drink while eating dessert because our cups had been taken away. Horrible service  horrible food.
Dan T.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,19,,7/21/2013,1.0,Macaroni & cheese dish with...wait for it...wait...crumbled gold fish crackers! WTH!?!?! The service is poor  management is horrendous and this BJ's surely cannot be the same as in San Diego  yet they are! I have been three times and with the feedback from friends and family who have also visited  none of us will visit this restaurant...at least not in Santa Rosa. My recommendation is to go find another place to drink  munch and eat at. Its rather fitting they are located in Coddington mall. Too bad Yelp does not have NEGATIVE rankings!FYI  still have not been since my last review and I hear its the same old story and this poorly restaurant.
Ash L.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,2,,6/9/2015,1.0,I've been to several BJ's  and I don't have the highest of expectations. Food is decent with more than enough options to choose from  nice atmosphere to catch a game  but this Santa Rosa location is the worst example. Gave them one more chance a couple weeks ago after a bad experience the first time...service was Non existent. They weren't even busy. Brought out our food and didn't return to check on us until after we were sitting around with our empty plates for almost 10 minutes.Won't ever go back here. Waste of $
Rashawd H.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,12,3,4/11/2014,4.0,Great looking place. Nice environment for a group or a small date. Great beer selection too
Eric Y.,Hollywood  Los Angeles  CA,73,1,,2/17/2013,1.0,I am disappointed not because of the food but the service. We specifically requested a table near the tv so that we can watch the nba All star game. We got seated very close to a tv and we were enjoying our dinner and the all star game. Obviously this weekend everyone is watching the all star events  but for some reason another customer wanted to watch hockey and the employees decided to change the channel to watch hockey... Hockey are u serious on a nba all star weekend the employees decide to change the damn channel to watch hockey! We tried talking to the manager but guess he/she didn't want to change it. Whoever the shift manager was during the all star game this directed to you. When a customer asks to be seated to watch a certain sporting event do not change the channel on them. I also work in a customer service industry and what you guys did lost a customer.
Kirstyne L.,El Segundo  CA,2,25,15,1/29/2014,3.0,I'll give three stars. I'm a fan of BJs  what they serve and love the seasonal drinks too. But this location is in much need of some SERIOUS TLC. Yes  there are tons of factors that impact the ability to provide great service  but I honestly cannot pinpoint what it is at this location that always results in a disappointing experience. Maybe it's lack of training or enthusiasm  although I cannot say that for all the wait staff bc we've had occasions of REALLY GREAT servers and ridiculously slow kitchen times. Moving to such a small town from a really big SoCal city  this location does ok  but I think there is room to do much better especially when dinning in during the slower business hours. We probably wont' be back for a few months  but the hope of improved quality is not completely lost.
Claire P.,Oakland  CA,8,27,2,2/25/2013,2.0,"For the amount of money B.J. charges on their regular menu  there should be flecks of gold in the appetizers and the wait staff should be singing songs to a grand piano by request.In all seriousness  the food is mediocre  the price of drinks is robbery  and the waitress tries to jam some avocado something-or-other down your throat by asking 3 times if you\'d ""like to try the [insert unappealing and overpriced item here]"". No thank you  I would not.I\'m giving it 2 stars because the beer selection is good and whatever bacon they use on their baked potato IS delicious. But maybe it\'s just because it\'s bacon. And beer.If you\'re looking to grab some good grub  down a drink or two  and enjoy time with people you like  there are so many better places to do those things. Unfortunately  B.J.\'s is not worth the wait or the money."
Irene S.,Monterey  CA,1112,551,,5/30/2013,5.0,Just like all BJ Brewhouses  this one has great service  great food  and great atmosphere. My boyfriend and I love the happy hour especially for their discounted $6 mini pizzas  discounted appetizers and discounted beers! To make your experience at this BJs Brewhouse the best it can be as for any of these restaurants  I would suggest getting on their email newsletter for the latest specials and coupons. Subscribing to their newsletter is so worth it  especially because when your birthday comes around  you can get a free pizookie dessert! Another thing worth getting is the rewards card but it is best to request it once you are at the restaurant. Do not fill out for the rewards program Online as you will most likely then not get a card and will have to remember you personal reward code otherwise. But you can always give the waiter/waitress your phone number and then they can look it up. This rewards program can give you points that can count toward discounted or free meals. Every meal you purchase there can be worth points to future meals there. You just got to remember to request when you eat there to get the points transferred onto your card. It can by the way get very confusing- this reward program. My boyfriend and I have been part of the program for about a year and are still trying to figure it out. My boyfriend and I travel often  and have been to just about every BJs Brewhouse in Northern California. We have found the the restaurants are consistently pretty good overall. My boyfriend loves their award winning beer. I love their deep dish pizzas. Their desserts are unique and amazingly tasty! I love those pizookies - (icecream on top of a large warm cookie- yummy!Pros:-All BJ Restaurants are consistent in great service and food-Has the unique Pizookie desserts-has a reward card program and an e-newsletter with the occasional coupon-great happy hour deals including $6 pizzas!-award winning beerCons:- no more auctions with reward card points- can get noisy and loud -is very crowded during happy hour
Lisa S.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,4,,12/23/2014,2.0,Do not go on a Saturday night!!! Seated quickly   but food took FOREVER!  No sorry for the wait or comped items. Staff very nice. Food very mediocre.  Asked not to fly paper airplanes after waiting over an hour for food.  Not going back anytime soon.
Justin O.,Chico  CA,0,2,,5/10/2015,1.0,I'm gonna be concise and only use bullets so I don't get off track.-Disrespectful and unprofessional Manager. She talked horribly to her staff and about customers. Also doesn't know how to properly ring up a bill.-The booth that we were had food on the floor (excessive amount) and the side dishes that were brought out were wet and still had food on them from previous customers.-Waiter got orders wrong and walked away with our drinks.-Menu items that are normally delicious at other BJ'S restaurants were bland and over cooked at this location.Safe to say I will not be returing nore will most of my extended family.
Cindi B.,Cloverdale  CA,34,58,19,1/23/2015,5.0,Stopped by here for lunch today and the service and food was amazing! The waiter was very friendly and attentive. I had their shrimp tacos for lunch. The shrimp tasted very fresh and the tacos were delicious! The fresh strawberry lemonade was yummy too! Their prices for lunch seemed fairly reasonable. I would highly recommend this place!
Curtis A.,Renton  WA,213,134,91,7/13/2013,3.0,First time to a BJ's chain was back in 2006 in Southern California. My first impression was great. It's fast paced and the atmosphere feels like you are in Cheesecake Factory. It's not that it is fancy but its feels lively in there. We sat down after a small wait being handed those pagers that beep and starts to flashThe menu is huge. We started traditional classic buffalo wings and pint of beer. Yum! Those were seriously so good. A little bit of spice made for a delicious way to start off. Other than that  the food is OK. They also have a large selection of been on tap. I choose the darkest beer  which I thought I would hate  but was actually quite tasty. I've been popping into BJ's throughout California here and there over the years  but mostly for their Pazzooki deser. Warm soft cookie the size of a large pizza  topped off with your choice to ice-cream. Yummy!
B S.,Point Reyes Station  CA,1,47,,7/24/2013,1.0,"Stay away from this place if you expect fresh food. I didn\'t think I would get old food  especially with the price you pay. With what we were served with  you\'ll be better off eating at McDonalds. I love eating out at places like this  it\'s fun and the food is usually decent.Well my mother ordered the chips and salsa and baked potato skins. These were pretty tasty. For the main meal  my wife ordered the BBQ pork sandwich with a side of fries. The Sand which was ok  but it clearly not fresh.. it wasn\'t even warm. Her fries were OLD and DISGUSTING. You could tell they were soggy just by looking at the grease caked up on them. How hard is it took cook a fresh batch of fries up or at the very least  throw away the fries that have been sitting out for over an hour!? REALLYI ordered the chicken fried steak. I was served the chicken fried chicken! :P No big deal  I told the waitress  she apologized and about 5 minutes later my ""chicken fried steak"" came out. Ok this is where I am absolutely disgusted with this place. First of all  they looked like 2 little patties  not a chicken fried steak. Second of all EACH PIECE was HALF BLACK from being burnt. Not just Burnt  I mean BURNT. The meat on the inside was BLACK. At the same time  it was COLD. I\'m pretty sure they microwaved my chicken fried steak instead of cooking it right.The managers came over and apologized. I didn\'t really like the fact they told me I just happened to order the worst item on the menu  and that my steaks just happened to be tiny and that they were a little burnt. ( It looked like beef jerky  I almost puked just looking at it ) They should of took responsibility for the abomination they sent out instead of clearly trying to side step something completely unacceptable and disgusting.Look bottom line is this is the absolute worst experience I\'ve had with food  and I\'ve had quite a few fast food places. If your looking for fresh cooked food.. seriously save your money  learn from my mistake. I wouldn\'t serve my dog what they served us. I don\'t know if they have lazy stoner cooks in the back or what  but chances are they have not resolved the lazy cooks  which means this could very well happen to you.I hope I saved someone the trouble of going to this place  I really do."
Ashley A.,Goleta  CA,7,13,,9/7/2014,1.0,In the past we have visited this BJ's several times. We've always had good customer service experiences  but what keeps us returning is the food! When we recently went to dinner at this BJ's we left extremely disappointed. My boyfriend and I went out on this night because he had been gifted a BJ's gift card. We were seated right away  which for this busy restaurant scores a lot of extra points! Our server didn't greet us for 20 minutes. After that I made sure to note everything that followed.. She took our food order and our drink order. Brought us our drinks right away. 45 minutes later she finally acknowledged we hadn't received our food or even reassured us it was on it's way. About 5 minutes later she brings out a side Caesar salad  which we hadn't ordered. By this point she has offered us a free dessert for what ever mistake was made that prevented our food from being ready. We thought she brought the salad as a polite gesture and when we tried to mention it hadn't been ordered she brushed us off. Our food came after 20 minutes  we've now waited over an hour since ordering. I've been to BJs when they're swamped  and this was not one of those nights. They had a good crowd but plenty of employees standing around. We eat our dinner and it's takes her 35 minutes before she comes back for the dessert order. Which wasn't a big deal except that we were both disappointed and ready to go.. We got our complimentary desserts and ask for the check. 40 minutes late she drops the check off! At this point  we both feel like this is a joke. Our server would disappear (probably busy doing other things  but unavailable to take our check or answer questions) for 20 minutes at a time and it was getting frustrating. I saw another server who I personally knew and asked them if they could grab our server so we can wrap up and handed them the check. Our server comes back right away and tells us the gift card system is down. So after 3 hours of building frustration  this was the icing on the cake. When I'm looking over our check  I see that she had charged us for that salad. The salad WE DIDNT ORDER! I was too tired to even ask  I just wanted to leave. We paid and left immediately. I have never been so disappointed leaving a restaurant  especially one that is as established as BJs. If the gift card system is down then the manager should take the card  verify the amount (call it in)  and hold it until the system is working and ask us to pay the difference only. Maybe it was this girls first few days of work  but it left us with a really bad experience and I can't help but not want to return and to now share my feelings with others.
Sarah S.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,3,1,4/15/2015,1.0,I'm giving this restaurant a one star because of the food. The first time I tried BJ's was almost a year ago. I got chicken strips and fries and was sick immediately after so I gave it a break. After coming back a few months ago for a second chance with my boyfriend  we shared the chicken wings. A few hours after eating there we got horrible horrible food poisoning. We were throwing up for days. Just recently we went back for a third chance (the place is close to our apartment so why not give it another go?) we ordered pizza because you can't go wrong with pizza. Right when the waitress put the pizza down  I saw a giant piece of hair mixed in with the cheese. I'm so over BJ's. Besides that  the servers were always nice and prices decent but I won't be giving any more chances.
Adrian G.,Petaluma  CA,16,54,14,4/14/2014,5.0,My wife and i finally got a night out  well a couple hours aways from our company and our 3 children were with their grandmother so we decided to go out to bjs.We were seated quickly  our waiter arived promptly took our drink order   we placed our appitizer it arived quickly  spinach and artichoke dip  it was ok chillis is much better though  we ordered our dinner everything was great. We were in and out in 55 minutes. Thats great fast service but we didnt feel rushed. I would recomend.
Stacy R.,Santa Rosa  CA,4,9,,12/3/2012,1.0,"We went for dessert on Friday night. It was a very stormy night and the already slippery floors were like an ice rink!! We were seated in a section with approximately 4 other average size parties (far from busy). My daughter commented to the hostess about the very slippery floors and the response was ""oh  I don\'t notice  we wear non-slip shoes"". OK - how about the patrons that didn\'t get the memo about non-slip shoes? We also told our waiter about the slippery floors and he said virtually the same thing....non-slip shoes!! Remember  we were there for dessert ONLY. It took 45+ minutes to get our food with no explanation from our waiter in the mean time. THEY WERE NOT OVERWHELMINGLY BUSY!! Dessert was good but no better than say  Baskin & Robbins right down the walk way (which would have been MUCH less expensive). As we were leaving the waiter gave us a ridiculous and obviously rehearsed speech about how much he enjoyed spending part of the evening with us. Which is BS since we barely saw him! As a last effort to get someone to acknowledge the VERY slippery floors  I stopped to talk to the hostess at the front door. After explaining that I almost fell  she looked at me with a Stepford-like expression/smile and said at least 4 times ""Oh  I\'m sorry  thank you for coming in"" So  this was the last chance. I won\'t go back. It seems to have gotten worse with each visit. What was excusable in the beginning has magnified to unacceptable."
Kristen G.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,20,2,6/4/2014,1.0,"I have eaten at various locations for this restaurant and by far the Santa Rosa location was the worst. Sacramento and others have it together...good service...good food etc. But this location has the worst service I have ever received and that has happened every time Ive gone in there to ""give them another shot"". When my salad never came the food runner told me ""I need to talk to my waiter""...rather than ""sure let me look into that  or let me see what happened"". They are just rude....Also food takes forever. With the Coddingtown mall opening so many new doors they should really step it up if they want to compete with other restaurants.Worst service and even slower food...would not recommend and will not be back...Oh and the kicker...the waitress brought out dinner out and my sons order was wrong  the server left before I could say anything and when she returned I asked about it and she said ""oops wrong table""...and picked it up and gave it to the table next to us who just got their food. Gross! She left the plate on our table for over five minutes...what if we had taken a bite???"
Mike W.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,9,,9/23/2015,1.0,We eat here fairly frequently and tonight was the worst service and food we have had yet. They got the order wrong twice and we waited far too long. We won't be coming back anytime soon. This place has always been hit or miss and tonight was a huge miss. Avoid this restaurant if you care to have a nice meal. I would have chosen a zero if I could have.
Richard S.,Santa Rosa  CA,32,35,,9/26/2012,1.0,LOUSY! LOUSY! LOUSY!  TOO MUCH MONEY FOR MEDIOCRE TO CRAP FOOD.WATCHED A WAITRESS BYPASS A TABLE THAT HAD DIRTY DISHES ON IT. IT SAT THERE FOR 20 MINUTES. DIRTY FLOOR ON THE PATIO.  THE NAME SAYS IT ALL FOLKS.YELP TOOK DOWN  MY FUNNY  BUT SCATHING REVIEW OF THIS RESTAURANT BASED ON IT'S GUIDELINES POLICY.

Instead we got Bj's  and what the f9#k kind of name is that for a restaurant? Is that like a psycho linguistical manipulation like HOOTERS? Appealing to male frat boyz and all that  tv screens and endless beer. Give me a break. is America that stupid? Yep  I guess they are. Young and dumb and full of....BJ'S! See how it all fits? the male urges and all. it's not about eating  it's about getting your pecker shined.

Shane S.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,8,,1/11/2015,1.0,"So I ordered take out and when I arrived to pick it up I stood at the Pick Up desk for about 3 minutes before one  of many  people behind the desk even acknowledged me. They saw me  made eye contact  and said nothing. Food was widely mediocre and it was almost 20 minutes late from the pick up time. After I got a half assed ""sorry for the wait"". I\'m the most understanding person this was a very poor experience"
Johnny X.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,13,,7/17/2014,2.0,I disregarded other reviews saying they messed up their orders and got my order messed up. Everything is super greasy and takes forever to come out  and of you're not racking up a big bar tab the servers don't have time for your regular food order. Total waste.
Yesenia C.,San Diego  CA,651,235,106,9/25/2012,3.0,BJ's is a BREWHOUSE its suppose to be loud and have lots of TV's its not suppose to be quiet and peaceful and not really made for kids. Bj's is a loud  fun exciting place to be!!! I went on a Monday night and the service was good  food was good. I'm not sure why this place doesn't have better review but I think it's because people want it to be a quiet boring place!!! I would definitely will be coming back!!! Try the avacado egg rolls they are so good!!
Eric M.,Santa Rosa  CA,48,64,,10/14/2014,4.0,Four stars means I'm a fan? Not sure about that  but BJ's has definitely improved since the opening months. Yes  if you read the initial reviews from when BJ's opened; the consensus was...they were horrible. I go to BJ's because my family likes it. I go to appease them. I also suffer from a lack of originality  so I tag along. Food isn't too bad. Yes  the menu is extensive and you should be able to find something to your liking. Odds are  it will be pretty good. Not great  pretty good. You're not going here for a 5-Star dining experience. This is a place to relax with family and friends  grab a beer or a quick bite to eat. Regarding that quick bite to eat  service has gotten a lot better. During a recent busy Saturday evening  we received our food quite quickly. I was very surprised how quick it arrived. To see if it was a aberration  we decided to go the following Saturday (I told you my family likes the place and I lack the ability to come up with a better option). Once again  great service and food arrived shortly after our order. Shock! This place gets a bad rap. Yes  it's a chain. Yes  we have numerous local places that may be 10x better. That doesn't mean it's bad. It has gotten better  actually a lot better over time.
Christina R.,Sacramento  CA,14,14,6,4/1/2013,1.0,I literally created my Yelp account today because I felt that I needed to say something about how horrible the service at this restaurant is. I'm a fan of BJ's  and have never had a bad experience at their other locations  but this was HORRIBLE. We walked in  weren't acknowledged by the hostess  and had to greet HER. She shortly told us that the bar was open seating and handed us menus without another word. We sat down and waited 10 minutes for the server to take our order. The place was empty  maybe four or five tables in the entire restaurant  I can't fathom why it took so long. After ordering our food  it came out 30 minutes later and was incorrect. We asked specifically for bone-in wings  and were given boneless. We told the server and she said that the kitchen mis-read her slip. Whatever  it happens. 20 minutes later  our wings come out  but to the WRONG table. My boyfriend then watches the other patrons poke  yes POKE our food and examine it. He tells me this and I just tell him that they must have ordered wings also. Nope. The server brings those very same poked wings to our table. My bf explains that he watched another table just poke those  and she says that they just took a celery stick off of the plate and moved on. To defend other guests touching our food... I mean really? We waited 50 minutes for these stupid wings. When the check finally comes (again  after a long wait time) the wings are on there twice. We notified the now different server of the error and she had to wait for the managers to stop chatting by the host's podium for 5 minutes before she could even tell him about the error. At no point were we offered any comps for our frustration or for their shitty service and mistakes. I reluctantly still tipped because I used to work as a server and know that it sucks  but really nothing excuses such a horrible experience.
Leslie K.,Ukiah  CA,0,17,4,8/12/2015,3.0,This was my first you me eating here and it was ok. I've avoided it before because the line for dinner is very long and it's crowded: it reminds me of a nice Applebee's. The staff is very friendly. The wait to get in was maybe 5 min. for lunch. I got the chicken mango salad which tasted great except that it came without chicken; the waiter was polite and got it in the side fairly quickly after I brought it up. The wait time overall wasn't too bad if you compare it to other family friendly sit-down restaurants; don't expect to be in and out quick though. Our total time was 1hr.
Stephen S.,Petaluma  CA,1,9,,1/8/2013,1.0,"The Service: No greeting from the hostess  just how many? Handed menus and told to seat ourselves. Our waitress (?) barely a greeting  started off nice enough  the FIRST time I asked for anything extra  she became completely offended and rude  all I wanted was extra lemon for my terrible ice tea. She maintained her cold attitude until the end. Also as an observation all the staff were pretty vacant  just kind of wandering from table to table  there were managers  I think  but they never left front of house  ever to check on ANYTHING. There was no spirit of service  no apparent want to even be there.The Food: We ordered half salads and the flat bread pizza type stuff. The flat breads were greasy and burnt to the point where i could not tell the difference between my steak pieces and the mushrooms  mine was ""The black and blue "" Way heavy on the black  burnt and formless pieces of it  barely any blue cheese  not even enough to have some for every slice. The topper was the salad  more then half the lettuce was slimy and starting to rot  on both salads. The waitress  with barely an apology offered to have them remade  i asked if it would be from the same lettuce  she said ""of course"" I don\'t think she understood the irony of the situation  we asked for fries as a replacement since they had no other healthy alternatives...the whole situation was a huge let down.Also as a side note  the music was terribly loud and grinding for a Tuesday lunch shift  the decor is dark and dirty. It appears the main bulk of the budget for design went into the bar area. Which glows like a gem in the middle of the mud puddle...to bad i don\'t drink. Another thing  our waitress only had four tables counting us  yet she couldnt be bothered to deliver our food herself  she had someone else do it so she could keep just standing where she was not doing anything. Guess thats also why we never got silverware even after our food that clearly needed it arrived  i had to get it from another table  thats one of the worst things that can happen."
Alexandra S.,Folsom  CA,494,126,123,7/18/2014,2.0,"We have had mixed luck here at this BJ\'s. The first time we went here  we had HORRIBLE service. So bad that I would have probably given them only one star. Waitress got confused when we ordered (and there were only 4 of us there...not a big group!)  she couldn\'t figure out how to substitute things. She was VERY slow...took us almost 20 minutes to even get drinks after ordering them (and none of them were fancy...it was mostly just iced tea). And took almost 45 minutes(after ordering...which since our waitress was slow  wasn\'t until a while after we were seated) to get our food. And I should mention that it wasn\'t busy in there at all. We would look around and literally wouldn\'t see our waitress around anywhere...for long periods of time. We didn\'t get drink refills or water...we asked her once  and she said ""sure thing"" and then didn\'t come back. Our food was cold when we got it. They messed up one of our orders too. We didn\'t ask to get anything fixed  because we didn\'t want to wait another 45 minutes to get our food...we were starving!! We also changed our mind about dessert...didn\'t want to have to try and find our waitress  and then wait. We almost asked to speak to the manager  but decided we just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible  since we\'d all ready spent wayyyy too much time there.Months and months later  my boyfriend and I decided to give this BJ\'s another try  since we do like the food their chain serves. We had a much better experience. That is why I raised the review up to 2 stars. Our hostess and our waitress were both very friendly. They only messed up one small thing on our order...which wasn\'t bad because since they changed the menu  we both substituted a couple of things. They were quick. The drink I ordered was delicious! The side salads were fresh. And the price isn\'t too bad. I do wish they had some foods with not quite so high calorie counts...if you\'re on a diet  don\'t go here  they list the calories for each menu item....and they are all pretty high in calories in my opinion! Don\'t get me wrong  I do like the food BJ\'s serves  and the atmosphere of their restaurants. This one though is my least favorite of any of the BJ\'s I have been to. Although since it is the closest one to us  we most likely will go back at some point."
Jodie J.,Petaluma  CA,0,4,1,7/6/2014,5.0,My husband and I went to BJ's last Friday night for the first time and had the best meal  service was fast  correct and we had a wonderful waitress named Lauren. She was new but you would have never known that  she knelt down to explain stuff to us. She was very personable. I would recommend this place and that waitress to anyone. KEEP UP THE FANTASTIC WORK LAUREN!!!! More places need waitresses like her. .
Jerome W.,Santa Rosa  CA,38,28,6,9/21/2012,2.0,"I\'ve been to BJ\'s 4 times. None of which were very good. The food is absolute bottom of the barrel  mega-chain food. The service is ...alright. The beer is average. The ""hand-crafted sodas"" are really good  but is that worthy of a visit here? Let\'s not forget the TV\'s! Good lord  they\'re everywhere. So if you wanna sit in a huge mess hall  drink soda  and watch the game  BJ\'s....is still a crappy option. There are much better restaurants in town for the money you\'d spend here."
Emmanuel G.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,2,2,5/14/2014,1.0,The service here is horrendous!! I don't know if they were discriminating us because we are gay  or what... But we literally waited 10 minutes after we were seated before someone came to check on us. Also note that 2 other hetero-couples were seated after us and they ordered their stuff before anyone came to our table. The food was edible but not anything to be proud of. Too bad you can't give zero stars. Oh and I forgot to mention that we had to ask for everything.... Silver wear  salt  pepper  straws for the drinks  etc... Aside from the cruddy food and service experience  I will say that its a good place to people watch.
Aria D.,Beverly Hills  CA,1,31,,3/31/2013,1.0,"Service sucked.Me and my brother walked in. We sat down. Bartender looked straight at us without a ""Be right there with you""  and looked at us like a deer in the head lights. We sat there for approximately 5-10 minutes without service or menu\'s. We walked right out. I have been to numerous BJ\'s throughout California. This one sucks the most."
Kira W.,Santa Rosa  CA,87,104,28,11/11/2012,3.0,We went at lunch  so it was quieter than for some of the reviewers. The server was nice and had the same demeanor as any other chain restaurant server.My burger was overcooked. Beer wasn't anything special.
Dre C.,San Rafael  CA,0,122,,8/21/2012,1.0,Went for happy hour. Hostess didn't know what exactly it covered nor the special drinks for the day. Wanted to save calories so ordered the light Mojito. So horrible had to send it back. Ordered calamari--dry and nothing special--and shrimp lettuce wraps--HORRIBLE again. Too loud and the vibe is just so mall. :-(
Cece A.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,10,,3/18/2015,5.0,This is one of my all time favorite places to eat! My boyfriend and I love to watch the Giants games here and I have yet to find somewhere that makes a better Bloody Mary. Great food  always great service and great atmosphere!
Karen M.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,6,,6/6/2015,1.0,"Came here AGAIN for my sisters graduation lunch ( her choice not mine ). They lost our reservation for 10  and even though the place was dead on a Saturday afternoon  they seemed really flustered with our party size. When we were seated our waitress told us that if we wanted to order brunch  we had to do it now or ""the kitchen will yell at her!"" Umm  I\'m sorry  since when is it our jobs as paying customers to accommodate the kitchen??? Then everyone got their food except for one of my sisters friends. When we were all finished eating her pizza finally came  and it was COLD! when she asked our waitress to fix it  the waitress asked ""well what do you mean  how did you want it to be?"" I am a server myself  and my boyfriend is a cook so I do have an understanding of how mistakes can happen  but I had a REALLY hard time biting my tongue!! When the Deseret arrived  so did the pizza finally. This place is only good for an afternoon drink. And even then save your money! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!"
Dennis F.,Chicago  IL,274,54,10,10/12/2014,4.0,My family stopped here on our way to their place in Ukiah. Great Burgers!!
Helen H.,Sacramento  CA,383,1289,3064,7/9/2013,2.0,My friends and I had time to kill  so we decided to go to BJ's. We chose to sit outside  big mistake. First off  they need screens to block the sun because I was burning. Another reason is because the seating area was dirty. We placed the napkins on our seats before sitting down. The biggest reason was because there was an unpleasant smell coming from the sewers or something. Food and service was ok  nothing spectacular.
Jack B.,Petaluma  CA,12,144,,10/9/2014,4.0,I had a lunch special with pasta and salad. It was delicious. My friend had the fish tacos which he said were really good. I also had a black cherry soda and a strawberry lemonade. So good. I will be back for sure.
Gerald W.,Burbank  CA,21,157,23,10/5/2014,4.0,Typical Bj's with the thermostat set to 50 degrees...Brrrrrr
Amelia E.,Rohnert Park  CA,170,129,18,7/2/2014,4.0,The service is a hit or miss. The food is really good. Santa Fe rolls are so good  I wish I could have them 24/7! Also  they have chocolate chip cookies with ice cream covered in Carmel or chocolate sauce which is mouth watering. Also  endless pickles.?! I'm in heaven!
Brittany P.,Petaluma  CA,52,2,,5/15/2014,1.0,My experience was horrible and I'll refuse to ever come back! The wait staff were rude and unprofessional kept my husband and I waiting 20 mins before the waiter came to order our drinks and meal. Waited an additional 35 mins for the food to arrive at the table. We ordered the calamari which was covered in rancid oil. At that point we asked to speak to the manager who can put and looked at our food an removed it off bill. We left hungry and unhappy!
Becky A.,Santa Rosa  CA,3,6,,4/6/2015,5.0,Went to BJ's for lunch today and had the BEST waiter in the world!! His name is Richard P. He was so friendly  and professional. We orderd our drinks and food  and he brought everything we needed right away  and always with a nice friendly smile. There was a problem with our pizza  not Richards fault  and the manager came over and paid for our food  for their mistake. That was the bonus  because our waiter was fabulous!!
Ray L.,Sebastopol  CA,28,417,53,12/23/2012,1.0,Being a beer snob I can say their beer isn't the worst in Sonoma County. That goes to two places down town for sure. But okay is about the best I can give it. The noise level was intense for a place maybe half full. And the food was not good. I can steer you to many dive places with food ten times better. My pizza had okay topping but the crust was burnt. We had to ask for napkins after the food hit the table. I usually try to give a place at least two try's before I wipe it from my list. This place will not get a second chance. Now there is two places in Coddingtown that suck. Truely don't waste you time. Or money which they will take quite abit of for very little.
Kiani m.,Santa Rosa  CA,78,24,,4/7/2014,5.0,Our waiter Scott was great but i felt bad  you could tell he was understaffed. Regardless he did a really good job of making sure we got everything we needed. My only suggestion would be to maybe add one more person to help lighten the work load a little so that things dont take as long.
Jo N.,Sonoma County  CA,36,398,58,7/25/2012,4.0,We got there early (I recommend) for lunch and sat outside. We had an assortment of apps. We really liked the watermelon and feta salad  and the chicken lettuce wraps the best. The menu is enormous  truly  too large. ANYONE can find something to eat here even if you have allergies or dietary restrictions.
Lindy B.,Santa Rosa  CA,88,192,104,6/12/2012,2.0,"If you want Denny\'s on steroids  if you want mediocre food at premium prices...then this is the place for you! If you want to try a bunch of different beers  then this also is the place for you. If you don\'t want to have to wade through 5 pages of beers  then this is not the place for you. My husband and I went here for lunch the other day. So  the appetizer Thai Lettuce Wraps ($10.50) were tasty. 4 wraps  in butter leaf lettuce  that fell apart. So not really wraps. Hubby had Mini Vegetarian Pizza ($10.25) mini. Peppers and mushrooms. I had the Thai Mango and Avo Salad $10.95); don\'t let the picture on the menu fool you...where\'s the chicken? Where\'s the mango? Where\'s the lettuce? IDK. Not on my plate. I mean  it\'s suppose to be ""lighter"" fare  but  to be fair  lettuce doesn\'t add much by way of calories  and sure would have made the pathetic plate I was served look more ""filling"". AND it was LOUD!LindySez: If I\'m paying almost $11.00 for a salad...well  there\'s a lot more places I can do that  and get something in return. Not thinking I\'m going back to BJ\'s...nope  not at all..."
John w.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,19,,6/3/2012,2.0,"Heard a lot of good things about BJs and so when they came to town excited to try... disspointed now that I have tried.I guess they are still cutting their teeth as things are very disorganized there... I went with a friend who had a bad experience close to opening night but was promised if she tries again it will be better.They recognize her on the way in and apologize for poor service last time so this is a good start  we will surely gett good service to make up for it.Nope.Right off the bat we are told one girl will be our server (forget name now) and immediately a girl with a different name shows up saying she will be our server. Takes our drink order and a few minutes later a different girl shows up with our drinks and says she will be our server... I don\'t get how you screw this up... this is what sections are for... it\'s not horrible to be sure but really part of the dining experience is making a relationship with your server and if you are going to switch out servers mid service at all the customer should be alerted and explained to about why.Anyway first girl comes back and takes our food order. We have two tomato mozarella salads (I love buffalo mozarella and at $4 a pop!) I get the chicken pesto flatbread pizza  another person gets the California Chicken and the last just has an order of calimari for an entre. Server askss if we want the calimari with the starters so he doesn\'t have to sit there while we both have food and we say yes in fact fire it as fast as they can since we would like to be out done and out in less than an hour - this should be a resaonable thing for a 2PM seating after the lunch rush.The girl comes by with 3 tomato salads and leaves us one... our server sees this and directs her back so the second shows up a minute later... continues the tone for how the service is here... disoriented.No calimari.We finish our salads - which are tasy however they are not heirloom tomatos (I don\'t think it says they are so this isn\'t a ding  just a note) and it\'s a bit salty... I like salt as much as the next guy but tihs is apparently a trend with their food.We wait for about 10 minutes and our server passes by notices the missing calimari and rushes to the kitchen  brings it out a few minutes later with an apology. Worst calimari I have had a in a long time. It\'s visibly oily and soggy - I taste a piece and it\'s barely warm  there is no taste of calimari just oil and it\'s like eating wet cardboard. The one dish that needed salt and has none.This dish is a total failure in my book.Then the server comes to tell us there is a delay in our entres - could she offer us some soup to make up. We are in a hurry so this is bad news but say fine  I like the sound of a tomato bisque and she has the chicken noodle.1 minute later her sandwich comes out... odd... the runner drops it off and reads ""California chicken"" off his kitchen ticket looks at the sandwich and immediately says ""oh I mean chicken club!"". It\'s got bacon on it. She doesn\'t eat pork and specifically chose the Califronia because it does not have bacon.We explain this to the server and she apologizes and offers a refire of the correct order. We op to just pick the bacon off and eat it as is. It\'s very passable if a bit salty.Our soups come out and my tomato bisque is a frothy salt bucket of a soup. I don\'t even finish it and it\'s not a big cup.The chicken noodle is similarly unremarkable and salty.Finally after the sandwich is almost finished my pizza comes out. Looks quite tasty. Is not.There are about 6 tiny cubes of ""chicken"" on it which have the texture and flavor of frozen grocery store pizza chicken. The ""Pesto"" is visiually accurate but is just slaty. No real taste basily goodness. In fact the whole thing is basically a nicely cooked grocery store frozen pizza.Unimpressive.The server apologizes for the bad service again and offers us a pizookie for free  we say no and she pushes again and again to give us soething free so finally we take a few scoops of ice cream. The ice cream is good. Ambiance is nice  I am very impressed (as a nerdy guy) by the 100+inch LCD TV over the bar and it\'s got a nice upscale brewhouse look. Nothing else impressed me about the experience and I won\'t be back."
Issy D.,Sacramento  CA,738,532,56,7/16/2012,3.0,I came here the other day with my boyfriend curious to see what Bj's was all about.My first impression was good. It's fast paced in there and the atmosphere feels like you are somewhere that isn't santa rosa. It's not that it is fancy but its feels lively in there. We sat down after a small wait after being handed those annoying pagers that beep and turn bright red.....anyways....The menu is HUGE. You can seriously can get any type of food you want here which always makes me it assume it can't be fresh. Theres no way a kitchen can prepare everything from pizzas  burgers  salads  french  italian....haha I can continue. We started off with the avocado cream cheese won tons. Yum! Those were seriously so good. A little bit of spice and a ton of cream cheese made for a delicous way to start off dinner. My boyfriend also loved the beer menu. It has pairings and a meter from light to dark. He choose the darkest beer  which I thought I would hate  but was actually quite tasty.For dinner he got a pasta dish and I got a cobb salad. I had always thought a cobb salad is something no one can ruin. I mean  hunks of chicken and avocado?? How can anyone do wrong?!Well I guess BJ's can. The lettuce was brown and wilted. The chicken was diced like it had been from a salad barr at Round Table or Something. The lettuce to toppings ratio was so off that I thought lettuce was possibly a topping and dressing was the main course. Pretty dissapointing. Our waiter was super funny and nice and everyone else around me seemed to be having a great time. I still left with a smile on my face  but will not come back unless its for desserts and drinks or maybe appetizers and drinks
Brook T.,Santa Rosa  CA,122,11,13,10/12/2012,1.0,I was unimpressed after my first BJ's experience in Santa Rosa  but went back when a friend asked  and this time was even less impressed. The service is terrible. We were 3 of 9 people sitting in the bar area. It took almost 10 minutes to order our drinks  then another 15 to get 3 beers. There were quite a few people working there  but no one seemed to be doing anything  with the exception of the very slow moving bartender. This experience does not add to up any type of Happy Hour experience I want to have again. Too bad  when I used to go to the one up in Portland I had a great experience.
G L.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,7,18,8/20/2013,2.0,Been here twice its Crowded all the time! Decent food for a chain. (A small step above Applebee's) good beers on tap Burger was.. Ok. Terrible service our waiter didn't even bring us silver or napkins.
Elizabeth Z.,Santa Rosa  CA,110,11,,5/15/2012,5.0,"Okay  I could rant for days about how amazing my experience was  but I will give you the short of the long.This was my first time ever dining at a BJ\'s. The architecture inside and out is just fabulous. The whole vibe is very comfortable.The staff was courteous and most were actually knowledgeable of the food. Not bad having just opened. Although  I feel they could have been a little more laid back  it\'s not completely fine dining.We started with BJ\'s Beginnings appetizer plate. Mozzarella sticks  two rolls  and spinach artichoke dip  along with three different sauces. EVERYTHING on that plate blew my mind. Even something as simple as the dip. My caesar salad tasted the most fresh compared to any salad I\'ve had recently.My entree was the lunch portion fettuccine alfredo. Considering the menu is gigantic  I decided on my favorite food  so I am very picky when it comes to this dish. That said  it wasn\'t the best I\'ve ever had  but still tasted great  and left my stomach with a \'happy full\' feeling. My buddies had a calzone and the angus pot roast sandwich. I\'m assuming they were both delicious  because the majority of the meal was spent moaning and saying ""oh my god  this is so gooooood"".Finally  I just had to try a dessert on my first visit. I got the cookies and cream Pizookie. I swear this was crafted by gods. I\'m a sucker for rich chocolate sweets  and oh my  this just topped off the five star rating.Aside from the restaurant just opening  I have nothing bad to say about this place. They made me an extremely happy gal.YOU MUST GO TRY FOR YOURSELF!"
Trisha L.,Rohnert Park  CA,9,29,,11/12/2014,1.0,Most of the time I've been there  I've gotten okay food. Not horrible but not omg- yum. But always a long wait. Last time I went I got sick from their food. I know it was here  because that's all I had eaten that day. Really really don't trust to eat here now.
Marty P.,Santa Rosa  CA,12,68,111,6/13/2012,3.0,not a place to take your wife for birthday dinner with kids..although my youngest finished his food   ( chicken tenders) but he will eat ANYTHING. My 10 yr olds grilled cheese was warm to room temp. We split the Mediterranean Pizza  (cold) all I could taste was the feta cheese and the peppers on a room temp focaccia style bread ( not a deep pan pizza as it is on the menu) Good beer selection $5.50 to $7.50 ...Nothing even close to Russian River Brewery which is my favorite in Santa Rosa and much better priced The place was packed and loud to be expected  The kids LOVED the house brewed root beer with free refillsI'd go back for beer and apps for lunch if I was stuck in the area... overpriced dinner menu. It's just a glorified Lyons  Dennys and Ihop menu and add $40.00 to the check.
Jen B.,Occidental  CA,0,41,13,6/4/2012,1.0,"The food alone deserves one star. They\'ve been open about a month. But I think the food is not going to improve- it\'s just low quality.The food was literally just like Burger King or McDonalds  but with alcohol and a lot more expensive.I ordered ""fried chicken"". It was ONE ""chicken tender"" type piece that tasted just like gross fast food on top of mashed potatoes that had to be at least 50% dairy and may have been from a powder mix. I cannot believe they had the nerve to send out so little food as an entree  but I was glad after I tasted it. My husband ordered a jalapeno burger which came cold. He said we should have gone to In and Out because those taste much better- and he doesn\'t even like fast food. The beer had no flavor. The cocktails have no prices on the menu. I ordered a peach cocktail that was too sweet and I felt no alcohol effect. I just cannot tell you how bad the food was. We live in Sonoma County  there is no excuse for this. As a chain I\'m sure they have a formula for the food that works Nebraska and Ohio. As a new restaurant it is understandable that there were some other issues too. There was a lot of people there at 2 in the afternoon  but some empty tables (the place is huge)  but they still had five parties waiting to be seated. There was no toilet paper in the women\'s restroom. As I stated  there were items on the menu with no prices.When serving and clearing the couple at the table next to ours  our waitress put their dirty plates and her tray down on OUR table  while we were sitting right there. Seriously  I couldn\'t make this up.Any good reviews here have got to be plants. I suppose you may like this place if you are from out of state and have always wanted to go somewhere you can eat fast/frozen food  drink bland alcohol and watch TV in public."
Lynn M.,Santa Rosa  CA,6,25,1,7/30/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Changing my mind. The food is actually pretty good. If I don't order past the beer menu  it's not too expensive. This is now my go-to place for lunch when I don't want to have to think. Staff friendly  but not always competent. Clean. Previous comment about darkness was more my cataracts than the decor.
Eli L.,Prescott Valley  AZ,3,10,4,6/26/2014,1.0,My first experience at BJ's was during the initial month of opening and it was not pleasant. We ended up being a test table for staff training. He was really nervous with lackluster direction from the trainer and I did not base my rating on the trainee  everyone has to start somewhere. Here is the kicker  most of the food was not expedited properly with random plate arrivals and cold food  so management issues in the kitchen were the real issue. I chalked this up to first month bugs. Unfortunately  even after waiting months and trying again  same results. Inattentive servers  long wait times  and someone at the table had cold fries  no drink  or stranded without food. Food always seemed like Applebee's microwaved food with a larger price tag. My roommate also had a horrible experience where the waiter botched their order and then argued that they never ordered items they were waiting for.Bottom line  The only thing I like at BJ's is the beer/bar. I would rather drive to Corte Madera for Cheesecake Factory.
Tina K.,Acampo  CA,46,5,,8/27/2013,1.0,Restaurant charged my account more than what the tab was with the tip. When I called them on it they said I made the mistake but would credit me back the difference. I knew he was wrong because I knew how much I had to spend. Anyway he did not credit me he recharged me. My account is overdrawn and my $30 meal has now cost me over $100.I called again and got the General manager who said corporate is taking care of it. Corporate has done nothing and the General Manager does not call me back. I have to call them.I think they were caught in some kind of tipping scam and dont want to make a customer happy. Will never go back to this BJ's again.
Vanessa L.,McKinleyville  CA,21,39,8,5/5/2013,4.0,I had such fun at this place! Arrived after 10 pm  and was informed that it was happy hour! we got a small anchovy and olive pizza  a shrimp lettucy taco appetizer and 3 beers for 32 bucks. It was a fab way to spend a thursday night. I'll definitely go back any time I head through santa rosa!!!Also  the mere sight of a rainbow array of brews is enough to bring a smile to this girl's face.  Also  they have a mondo tv  which i liked if only for the pretty colors.We had great service too. We sat at the bar and were super relaxed and happy.
Michael S.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,34,7,7/12/2014,4.0,I really like this place. A friend of mine insisted I try one of the BJ's in Southern California and I loved it so much. Everything was perfect. I came back to this restaurant here in Santa Rosa and it was pretty much identical in every aspect except for seasoning (on a burger called the Black and Blue). The restaurant was very clean and fresh  even the bathrooms. The kids meals serve fun little nuggets and they come with the standard coloring menu with crayons. Drinks are on the expensive side. All in all  I like to go whenever I can.
Jake L.,Petaluma  CA,3,43,31,9/4/2012,1.0,I gave them a chance a I use to be a fan when living in so cal  but of course they disappoint after the grand opening. Our calamari came out cold as if it was a rejected order waiting for someone else. The servers took a while to come around to take our order  forgot our drinks  last but not least the entree took a while and was mediocre.
Peter M.,Santa Rosa  CA,8,14,,7/2/2012,2.0,"It\'s OK. Kind of like a big Applebee\'s with many many TV\'s and a larger  but similar menu  with pizza added. Negative - very  very loud. Positive  nice to have signs of life in Coddingtown again.Food was OK  not spectacular  but not problematic either. Service still a little spotty  with multiple appetizers delivered to my table before we even ordered. It is very loud  so be sure your server get\'s your order right  or you may be in for a surprise.Will I go again? Sure. But not blocking out any dates on my calendar to do it.I ordered the watermelon mojito  which looks spectacular on the table tent  but the fruit was not muddled  so what I got did not look anything like its picture  but still a decent drink.The kid liked the hamburger dinner he had  and liked the environment  probably more than I did.UPDATE Late October 2012.For some reason or other  we keep coming back.Our second experience was primarily entree\'s - a couple of jambalaya\'s and two orders of chicken Marsala.Neither entree looked anything like the picture. The chicken was OK  but just OK. The jambalaya was fair  and definitely not worth the menu price (both of my friends who ordered this said ""Well  that was a disappointment!""Really  really loud. I had a ""laugher"" in the booth next to ours who made it very difficult to talk without screaming. This was  of course  on top of the already very loud noise levels already existent.  BTW  I have no problem with people going out and having a good time - that\'s one of the points of going out. I think I\'m just trying to suggest that the environment here is better suited for a couple a drinks  a few appetizers and a couple of laughs - then out the door. If you\'re looking for a ""dining experience""  you may be disappointed.And yet - we still keep going! Third and fourth visits were just sandwiches - which were just fine. I like the hard ciders that are available and the kid LOVES the house-made Cream Soda.  The cocktails are the part where you\'ll notice your $$\'s headed. If you can avoid that  this is a much better alternative to Applebee\'s."
Alicia T.,Lakeport  CA,5,12,15,3/10/2014,1.0,Food was cold waitress ignored us and spent whole time talking to freinds at other table. Won't go back again. Bad service bad food
Dean H.,Santa Rosa  CA,25,62,6,7/26/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Bjs have gotten better since they first opened when they were a complete disaster. but I still dont think there food is good enough to keep going back. especially with all the new restaurants that have opened up in coddingtown.
Erin C.,Vallejo  CA,1,5,1,11/20/2014,3.0,"The food is what you\'d expect from a chain restaurant like this - some things are pretty excellent  some are mediocre at best. The service can be hit or miss. My only complaint recently is regarding a new dish on their menu. They ""deep dish lasagna"" is nothing more than three LARGE frozen raviolis stacked with sauce and cheese. While I like ravioli  it\'s not the same...good place to go for a group as there is something for everyone."
Jordan S.,Kent  WA,8,118,3,2/7/2013,4.0,The prices are right on the dishes we get. All you can eat soup and salad for $7. yes please.They lose a star for seating time and organization. Almost every time we are in there somebody is yelling at them about how they have been waiting way longer than quoted. This happens to us as well but we are calm people so we just chill out  but it is not very professional. Beware of this if you go there!
Samantha S.,Rohnert Park  CA,8,1,,5/9/2015,1.0,Went there tonight  sat at the table for over an hour to have no food arrive  barely got our drinks  waitress apologized  still no food  manager comes out and apologizes  still no food or refills  call them out and say we are leaving  nothing compared  not worth the $21 and never coming back. Shitty service  awful managers  sub par food.
Naomi H.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,10,,11/5/2014,2.0,Best thing is the Great Beer Selection. Wait staff was very good. HOWEVER  the food & wait time is very poor. I had one good meal out of 3. Good salmon  overcooked pork chop & the WORST hamburger with over a 30 minute wait at 2PM on a Sunday. My friend & I kept waiting & the waiter kept apologizing & when our burgers came both were so over cooked & terrible. Wedge fries were good. So we spoke to the manager & he did not charge us for the long waited on overcooked burgers. Said he had enough cooks so no excuse. Better burger at Jack in the Box - seriously.I had the same experience at the one in Marin County. Ridiculous wait with other people leaving it took so long. Food was average. For a chain they do not have it together as Denny's has better food. In Marin go to the Cheesecake Factory who knows how to do a big restaurant with good food & service.
Kelly M.,Santa Rosa  CA,17,20,15,5/18/2012,5.0,We ate at BJ's the first weekend it opened so we were prepared to wait a bit for food and seatings. The wait was about 45 mins but we called ahead so it wasnt so bad. It was a bit of a struggle to order drinks at the bar  but they were well worth it. My husband had the long island and I had the Strawberry patch. Both very good and strong! For dinner I had the balsalmic glazed chicken and my husband had the deluxe double burger. He said it was the best thing he has ate in a very long time. Mine was also delicious- chicken was cooked well and had good flavor. We also had the chips and salsa for an appetizer which was very good- salsa had a slight BBQ flavor to it which I enjoyed. Servers were very attentive and friendly. The atmosphere inside is over the top. Overall  I feel it is one of the best restaurants in Santa Rosa!
Amanda P.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,8,1,10/26/2012,1.0,I have eaten at BJ's at a different location many times  and it was my favorite restaurant. The BJ's in Santa Rosa is AWFUL. I am not going there again. I order a clam chowder in a bread bowl  and my boyfriend orders the Thai Salmon. Let's start with the Salmon  his salmon had no sauce AT ALL and came with brown rice. On the menu it specifically says white rice in a Thai mango sauce. This would have been a fantastic healthy food choice if that's what he was going for  but he wasn't. When we tried to find it on the menu  it didn't even exist....... My clam chowder came in a normal bowl  not a bread bowl. When I told the man who served our food to us  he showed me the receipt so I could see what the waitress wrote down. I don't CARE what the waitress wrote down  it's not my fault. He said it'll take a little bit because they need to put the bread in the oven  I said that's fine. When I finally get my food in a bread bowl  the bread was so charred that it was pointless to eat anyways. They messed up two meals three times. DISAPPOINTED. We tipped  because we aren't rude  but our food sucked. Also  when we walked out of the revolving exit/entrance door  there was a bottle of windex placed on the handle and a sprayed (but not yet wiped down) window with nobody there. We had to push the Windex-y door to get out  and I thought that was unprofessional and gross.They really need to get their act together before I tell everybody to not even bother trying to eat there.Actually  but bother trying to eat there.
Rey R.,Santa Rosa  CA,13,3,,10/27/2014,3.0,Stopped by around 1:15PM on a Monday for a beer and some wings. NOT a full size meal. 30 minutes for them to arrive to my table  their food is good  service needs to get better.
Tina F.,Sebastopol  CA,12,90,11,12/23/2012,1.0,"Went there for lunch. The place was very noisy and it was about half full. It was raining outside and when walking to our table  I noticed the floor were rather slick. I was wearing tennis shoes and still slid a bit. Our table did not have napkins or silverware and we were not asked if we wanted water. The beer was ok. I ordered the the brewhouse blond shrimp that was supposed to be ""lightly fried"" but was very over fried. My boyfriend\'s pizza was burnt on the bottom. We had to asked for napkins and silverware after getting our order. Our meal was $53  rather spendy for lunch. Don\'t see us going there again."
Todd S.,Windsor  CA,0,19,,10/22/2015,3.0,Nothing to outstanding about this establishment. It is your average chain restaurant like an Applebees. However  I go here quit often with friends and I have never had a bad experience with their food. They have a good steak  good ribs  and in my opinion they best claim chowder in the local area (surprising right!?). Without driving out to the coast  its my favorite spot to get claim chowder. With that said the atmosphere is usually really loud and crowded (not necessarily a bad thing) and the service can take forever during meal times. A good place to go if you want to have a good time with family and friends.
Diana M.,Santa Rosa  CA,102,45,43,5/16/2012,3.0,We ended up eating there this evening. The stuffed mushroom appetizer was pretty great. I ordered the Mediterranean pizza  and it I'd give it a high six (out of 10)  and my guy ordered the Maui glazed pork chop that he rated a four. He really enjoyed the environment though  as well as the homemade root-bear  so we would probably go again. Also  our first Server was pretty spazzy. Really  REALLY pushy and seemed to be unaware that they just opened  have a ginormous menu and that it would probably take more than 2 minutes for us to know what we wanted to order. Super annoying. Literally asked us if we knew what we wanted SIX times in less than five minutes! Luckily  she was relieved by another Server  who was much more on the ball.Amendment: My guy thought he was rating 4 out of 5  not the 10 scale I was using for myself. Whoops!
Jason H.,San Jose  CA,26,269,90,11/17/2012,2.0,It all starts with the hostess. One needs to be genuinely friendly and not methodical as patrons check-in. Can the food make up for it? The food was typical BJ's fare  but the preparation and quality control was lacking. How did everyone miss the bacon and cheese chunks on a Cobb salad? The preparer missed it. So did the server. Our Classic Burger with cheese was missing the cheese. The cook missed it. So did the server. The only positive here was our apologetic and otherwise attentive server. We did not go thirsty.
Tammy M.,Santa Rosa  CA,14,100,177,4/6/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,We just left here an hour ago and to be honest tonight was not a good night here. The service wasn't bad but our waitress took forever checking on us. It just really sucks because the food is good but we get so tired if wAiting so long for any service here. She took forever filling up our drinks. She even forgot to take our menus away. It just wasn't a good experience for sure n I think we will past on ever going here on a weekend ever again.
Amanda L.,Rohnert Park  CA,87,119,36,5/25/2014,4.0,I love BJ's. I used to live in Fremont where we had a BJ's there way before we had one in Santa Rosa. Pizookies are ALWAYS a fave. SO good. Their menu is huge and they have a large variety of appetizers and small plates. Beer is excellent  same with their other cocktails. My favorite dinner entire is their fish n' chips. Best I've ever had anywhere. My fiance loves their burgers. Generally  our service is good. Sometimes we get waiters or waitresses that don't check on us too often but all in all it's fine. I love that you can call ahead and reserve seating too. Their BJ's rewards card is cool too. We definitely come back once in awhile for a date night.
Monsoon F.,Vail  AZ,0,23,2,3/19/2013,1.0,Pro: beer (according to everyone I'm with)Con: everything else! This location is by far the worst I've been to. Pricey  terrible service  poor quality food and dirty.
EarnIt P.,Windsor  CA,124,44,6,10/30/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Kevin as a server. He was excellent. We order Bloody Mary's  waters and the avocado rolls to start. He was back in less than a minute with our waters and to let us know our appetizer and drinks would be ready soon. Excellent service from beginning to end. I've had the worst service here but it is convenient and the food is good so I go back. We asked for the manager to give our kudos to Kevin as his professional attitude and attentiveness were priceless. The food is always good. A little pricey at $8.50 a bloody mary but they are yummy.
Rebecca W.,San Rafael  CA,3,19,1,12/2/2012,1.0,I have been here a few times since the Santa Rosa location opened and it just gets worse every visit. The hostess was completely rude and didn't even look up from her computer while speaking with us. We went around 2pm on Saturday and about half of the dining room was empty  yet it was still a 10-15 min wait...we asked why and the hostess coldly replied that there weren't enough servers. BUT there was a group of two or three waitresses standing around chatting...I don't get it. For the second time in a row  I have ordered a salad with dressing on the side and received my salad DRENCHED in dressing with a side of EXTRA dressing....really? The waitress was cool about me sending it back  but the food in general is so-so  especially for the price. They have a good selection of beers on tap  but that's the only plus about this place.
Betsy A.,Marin County  CA,5,34,11,10/20/2014,5.0,We had a couple of positive experiences here -- first  a stack of pizzas for the Tour de Fuzz bike ride (to go order) -- and pizzas were very nice and really hit the spot. About 70 of us eating it  and it was terrific (not just me  but everyone said so)! I was a bit apprehensive about going to the restaurant after seeing some iffy reviews  but I went there with a couple of young kids and we had a great time -- good service  excellent pizza  and we all shared a 'pizookie' for dessert which was also excellent.
R T.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,32,1,11/1/2013,1.0,Seriously  don't even bother. The food sucks  the wait staff sucks  and you'll waste 2 hours of your life for the check. Terrible.
Jason P.,Loomis  CA,183,88,109,1/11/2015,3.0,My first lunch time stop at BJ's. Started off entering this clean establishment through their revolving door. They have a hostess stand right up front where one waitress was behind the counter helping a difficult guest and another employee dressed like a hostess was standing there wiping down menus. As we stood there for several minutes waiting to be acknowledge another host came up to help with the difficult guest. All the time the employee wiping down menus kept...well wiping down menus. Not sure why she was unable to greet us  smile at us or help us in any matter. So we decided to just skip on over to the bar where we were greeted by a very nice  attentive waitress. My chicken parmesan sandwich and Jeremiah Red pint were awesome. Price was right as well. Only $3.50 for a lunch pint was a cool surprise. Minus the front of house greeting...this was a great visit and I'll be back!
Melissa W.,Cotati  CA,30,1,,1/22/2015,1.0,"Giving 1 star for the nice waiter & waitress in training.Otherwise The drinks & calamari appetizer took way too long  both fork & knife had to be sent back having dried green substance glued to them.I unfortunately ordered the chicken pita tacos w/feta cheese & a greek yogurt sauce(which looked really good on menu) but when I tasted them they had a very srong old musty goat smell/taste. To say the least they were just awful! When the waiters asked how everything was I was honest w/ them and let them know they where bad.They apologized sincerely and sent over the manager Gary F.Un-trained for a management position things went from bad to worse.This guy absolutely denied any possibility that it could taste like goat and rather then saying something appropriate like ""I\'m sorry you were not satisfied w/ your order  can I offer you a dessert remove it from the bill ect."" The manager continued to argue about it when I suggestested he go back to the kitchen & taste it for him self he agreed  dissapeared & never came back leaving his restruant staff to cover & apologise for his imature behavior. Sorry don\'t go  really not worth the time or $ ."
Pala V.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,24,18,6/7/2014,3.0,Good customer service however house salad was not fresh the greens looked like it was about to die on me  slices of cheese were stiff could definitely tell it was prepackaged pre refrigerated
Mitch O.,Petaluma  CA,0,5,,5/28/2012,3.0,Took my wife to Bj's on Saturday night  our weekly date night. We have been looking forward to eating here for a while. We ate at a Bj's while visiting friends in southern California and loved it. Santa Rosa BJ's Breakdown:HOSTS: hot or cold. By this I mean to say that some were very OVERLY sweet and bubbly to the point of being disingenuous or absurdly cold  flat  brass  and distracted. All and all I give hosts a 2star rating. SERVICE: Nice  friendly  but tried up-selling way to much. Made it awkward. Knowledgeable ut a bit robotic. Didnt make a mistake. Would have liked to see a bit more of the PERSON inside the robot though. but who knows  some people may dig that. All in all service gets a 3 star rating. BUSSERS: Good job. Saw them twice. Filled waters.FOOD: Cooked well  good presentation. Generous portions but didnt over stuff me or heaven forbid waste food. I dont like to see all the wasted food restaurants throw away  shameful. But Bj's hit it on the head with the portions. Favorite thing we ate was dessert  ordered the Pazookie. Warm chocolate chip cookie  ice cream  chocolate syrup. It was lovely. very good.All in all 3-4 star rating (my wife and I disagreed on the rating so we agreed to disagree)all in all a pretty good time.
Ralph D.,Santa Rosa  CA,3,2,,9/28/2013,1.0,Terrible. The service was horrible. Had to wait an hour. Finally was seated at a table and it was another 20 min until food came. When we were finally got served it was as if the food was pumped full of grease and sugar. In short  a frightening experience with cheaply made food.
Tammy G.,Penngrove  CA,5,11,4,2/2/2014,1.0,"""Homemade"" gluten free pizza crust was anything but! We were told by our server that everything was made in house. The salad dressings tasted bottled  the crust frozen. Tried the gf pizookie for dessert it came out raw. It was awful! They don\'t have much on the menu that is gluten free and the allergen chart is mis-leading  they only identify items with wheat  they totally ignore the rye and barley aspect of gluten!!!"
Michele B.,Millbrae  CA,5,88,,9/3/2012,3.0,We sat outside they need to get some kind of screens to block the sun when you are out there.The food was good had a bacon burger very yummy my friend had the personal pizza the sweet pig it was small like the size of a bagel and it was a little pricey  our other friend had the cobb salad hmmm looked ok and he said it was good.The watermelon mojitos were ok had 2 of them so I guess they weren't to bad.The cost for 3 of us and 6 drinks under $80 not so bad but could be a tad less expensive.Service was pretty good the waiter was very nice.
Nikki S.,Sebastopol  CA,84,97,1,4/7/2014,3.0,Wasn't my favorite place  they had all the orders wrong  my friends mashed potatoes were cold & there was a sausage on my cheese pizza. Although I am giving three stars for delicious potato skins.
Jay G.,San Francisco  CA,20,49,12,8/14/2013,2.0,Terrible service and lousy food. What's even worse is it attracts the douchebag population of Santa Rosa. It's not a family restaurant when you have drunk guys and girls shouting at the top of their lungs. Pizookie this!
Mark O.,Santa Rosa  CA,30,297,360,7/4/2012,3.0,Came for lunch - their Monday to Friday 11 am-3 pm lunch special menu was a really great deal for Santa Rosa. Most options are $6.95-$8.95. The $6.95 flatbread sausage  basil and tomato pizza and salad was excellent as was the $8.95 grilled mahi mahi tacos with tortilla chips (big flaky hunks of fish). The beers were good - not great when you have Russian River Brewing and other fantastic beer places in town. Server was friendly but overall service was a little slow - they have only been open for less than 2 months so hopefully they will get it together - they had plenty of people working! Overall noise level is high so don't go for quiet conversation.
L C.,Bend  OR,9,24,26,1/10/2015,3.0,The food and service here is fine. It's like going to the cheesecake factory. But don't let the Brewhouse name fool you. The stainless steel tanks up front are just for show. They don't brew anything here.  They just repackage a Budweiser IPA and brand it as their own.
Lynna M.,Rohnert Park  CA,7,33,1,4/15/2014,2.0,Had a bad night at BJ'S. Service was so slow  took 30 mins just to get water!! Don't think I will be going back anytime soon! TO BAD :(
No N.,Santa Rosa  CA,66,13,,7/16/2014,2.0,Ok so I took my wife and kids here for dinner and was very disappointed. First it took forever for the hostess to seat us. Next our server took forever just getting our drink orders . The food I don't have any complaints about. Service was very bad . Waitress never refilled our drinks and I Finally had to wave down another waitor just to ask him to do it. Asked for Tabasco sauce which never came . Kids seem to like their spaghetti though but got really restless because it took so long coming. IThink we will pass on going here again.
Warren C.,Santa Rosa  CA,47,8,4,10/19/2013,4.0,Some winning choices here are the tortilla soup  the Cajun chicken pasta  and the Ahi poke. For dessert  the pazooki is a must have. The menu here is extensive & I'm still working my way through it. Among their wines  I prefer the Elsa Malbec or the Murphy-Goode Cab. Great place to have a beer & appetizers while watching a game.
Bud R.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,44,1,11/4/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Slowest service  the servers frequently forget things  like my beverages  mediocre food nothing to spend money on  and their house beers? Terrible. I wish I could put negative stars  the whole experience was overall terrible.
Justin P.,Windsor  CA,1,16,11,9/27/2012,4.0,We asked for quick service and we got it. The food was decent. Like all of the TV's. Fun atmosphere. Clean look.
Yulfo L.,San Diego  CA,48,78,29,9/25/2013,3.0,I like that I have a variety to choose from all different kinds of foods. Sitting outside on a nice night is the best way to go or else you are going to be sitting in a restaurant that feels like a bar while your yelling across the table. Even without a game on the tv  its just so incredibly loud!!!!! Dont go if you have a headache or in a bad mood.
Danny T.,Santa Rosa  CA,11,4,10,2/11/2014,1.0,Just had the worst service ever and been to multiple BJ's in California I will not be coming back anytime soon and it wasn't even busy so I won't take that as an excuse food was good but service was lousy had to ask multiple times for water no silverware and this waitress was awful.....
Audrey G.,Oakland  CA,33,10,,9/21/2013,1.0,Two words.... Absolutely disgusting! I ordered the Moroccan Spiced Salmon  I literally got 4 bite sized pieces of bland salmon  2 pieces of bland broccoli  a few baby carrots and some equally bland and small portion of couscous for $12.95. The picture on the menu looked nothing like what was on my plate. So dissappontind. I could have made this meal better at home. Don't waste your money at this lousy restaurant.
Kellen H.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,7,,11/10/2013,5.0,Good prices  fantastic food  great service  fun atmosphere  full stomach. Everything I could want in a restaurant and more. Want a casual date with a hint if fancy? Right here. :)P.s. get the burgers!
Michael C.,Windsor  CA,17,32,11,2/4/2013,1.0,Reluctant 1 star. (only option). Inedeble food   nonexistent service and very loud. Rather run a cheese grater across my tongue than eat there again.
Bliss F.,Sacramento  CA,17,86,96,1/12/2014,4.0,This was my second visite to this restaurant. The food is plentiful  the staff nice . The pulled pork sandwich was delish!!! Mom had the blue burger and raved about that also. It is nice when you are out of town to find some place that is dependable  nothing worse that not knowing your way around town and getting a bad meal. BJ's was a good choice for us hungry weary travelers.
Laura D.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,83,42,1/4/2014,1.0,This place sucks! This is the second time that I have gotten food that's cold. Last time my food was cold an the other people in my party's food was warm this time mine was warm an theirs was cold. We both got burgers and they put fries on my plate but barely any on the other plate. The cheese they use looks gross. It was just not tasty and extra greasy. If I wasn't hella hungry and other places were open (it was NYE eve) I wouldn't have eaten it. My friend didn't eat theirs. If I ever go back it's for beer. The food is just gross. This place is basically a Applebee's...puke
Kristopher E.,Santa Rosa  CA,5,14,,12/3/2013,4.0,Went on a Monday night so the place was pretty much empty. The food (fettuccine alfredo for me) was pretty good but not exceptional. The waitress was nice  although new and a little unfamiliar with the menu. The wait for food/service was a little long considering how empty the place was. However  it was my first epxerience with a pizookie and it was amazing! I can't imagine having eaten an entire one by myself though.
Bill F.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,4,,5/4/2013,2.0,First time here tonight for a burger for my birthday... It started OK when the waitress said I'd get a free dessert because it's my birthday... We were hungry so we ordered 2 appetizers... 5 minutes later we ordered our burgers... Apps never came until 5 minutes after our burgers... We said forget it.. we were never checked on about our cold fries or overly rare burger... She came to clear out plates and one again offered the free dessert but after waiting 15 minutes for it we said forget it  just give us the check... She weakly apologized and said she would tell the mgr but never heard any offer to make good or anything... Anyway  we won't go back and could not recommend it... Next time I want a good burger it'll be 5 Guys or In & Out!
Elise G.,Santa Rosa  CA,194,152,204,7/7/2013,2.0,Had lunch here during the heat streak before the 4th of July and have to say I was not very impressed. I should have checked the reviews first  but honestly wanted to get inside to a nice cool place and have a bite to eat and it was handy.  It was loud  and the calamari appetizer was soggy. Service was okay  nothing special. Pretty interior though  so someone drops some bucks on it. What particularly threw me was when we left  there waiting room was completely backed up with people  also probably escaping the heat  but there were lots of open tables. That tells me that they didn't anticipate a crowd on a blistering hot day and were completely understaffed. I doubt we will be back.
Gianni M.,Santa Rosa  CA,639,50,11,12/19/2013,2.0,After reading all the poor reviews my wife and I had to see if it was that bad. Our previous visits to other BJ's were good. Well now I can say I understand the poor reviews. Service was bad. Had to ask for refills several times. Took forever just to take our order and even longer for it to finally come out. Note we came on a Thursday at 2:30 so they weren't busy. Then the old came out. We ordered sesame chicken salad and a small deep dish pizza. The salad was actually good. (That's why the yet 2 stars) The pizza was horrible. Didn't think it was possible to ruin a pizza that bad. When finished we ha to ask four times for our bill. I think this place has potential but they clearly need more training and more attentive managment.
Paul L.,Santa Rosa  CA,5,5,3,11/10/2013,1.0,Hostess took us to a table that was already full. Had to wait a few more mins around other people who were eating. Server took 15 mins to come back take our order. Server put someone else's table order on our table so food runner insisted it was ours. Our food went to another table. Not given any utensils or plates  had to hunt someone down to get that.
Tyler L.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,14,,3/28/2013,1.0,I just went there for dinner tonight and service was super whack  the hostess and the waitress gave an attitude  the pastas came out cold(looks like it been sitting out for awhile dry and crusted) and my sister was still nice enough to eat it due to we waited forever for the food and the pulled pork sandwich was super sweet. The only good items were the calamari   the burger and the pazookie Oreo cookie ice cream. I went to other BJ restaurant location and I say this is the worst place ever even as a new establishment. Only towards the end that another waitress noticed us and ask how we were doing because I ask her for ketchup for the fries. If I'm ever coming back is for the pazookie and the beer but there's way better beer brewery in Santa Rosa.
Alisha M.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,22,,12/28/2013,2.0,Service was worse than bad. Waitress was nice enough  but we waited 1hrfor a baked potato and a open faced pot roast sandwich only to find she wrote the order wrong and my meal was incorrect. Then we waited 15 min for the replacement then another 20 for the free dessert that we didn't want. lame.
Grace S.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,7,,11/11/2014,2.0,A very nice atmosphere but....the food was either plain and very average or bad. The service was not great either. If your looking for a good lunch spot  go to sea noodle right next door.
Brad J.,Boise  ID,0,4,,8/26/2013,1.0,Horrible service and the food was even worse. I ordered the bj bacon burger and they burned it completely on one side and there was a thumb print size punch in my burger bun. Needless to say I did not eat the burger. I would sooner eat at a 'shenanigans' from the movie 'the waiting'. I have given this place a few chances and I'm done. My advice to the ownership would be to either clean house of all the morons working here or pack it in and call it a day.
Bethany B.,Penngrove  CA,35,17,,1/3/2014,2.0,Don't get me wrong  I love BJ's! This Santa Rosa one has made me not always want to go to BJ's. The folks that answer the phone and are at the front entrance are not friendly. The servers are always running around like crazy. Plates are dropping on the floor everywhere. We do call ahead every time and still have to wait 20+ minutes every time. The last time we went in our server gave us a bill before we even ordered dessert. He didn't even ask us if we wanted dessert. We said we did want dessert  one person at the table ordered and he left without taking the rest of the dessert orders. I have been to friendlier and less hectic BJ's than this one.
Pedro M.,Santa Rosa  CA,18,3,,12/21/2012,1.0,WORST COSTUMER SERVICE EVER!!!...by far the worst costumer service I've EVER gotten. I have NEVER actually left feedback on ANY restaurant before  this place made me come here  create a profile and leave feedback  think about that and you'll wanna read my review....Ok so the amount of time to wait to be seated was somewhat reasonable but after being seated  we didn't get ANYONE come to serve us not even water for about 10-20 mins. When someone finally came to help. I ordered coffee  took her another 10-20 mins to bring it  but with no sugar and no spoon so I asked the waitress to bring me some sugar and a spoon  she again took an unacceptable amount of time and came back with only sugar and not a spoon to stir my coffee...we then made our order since we noticed she was taking so long  we ordered appetizers so I asked to get a spoon before getting the appetizers since I wanted my coffee before anything. After a long time  she came back with the appetizers and NO spoon  by this time I'm so frustrated that I don't even wanna say a thing. After about half an hour  they finally bring our entrees  so I ask the other employee for a spoon and new coffee since the one I got was already cold  she apologized and brought me new coffee and finally a spoon within five minutes  which I didn't mind as much but we never got water served to us  so I had to order water and orange juice so I could safely eat my food after drinking my coffee...after I finished my coffee  I STILL had to wait a long time for them to bring me the water and orange juice I had ordered  by then my food was almost completely cold but since I don't like to make a big scene and since my friends didn't want me to  I didn't complaint and I just ate as much as I could but left almost half of it because it was too cold to consume enjoyably.This was the second and LAST time I go to that particular place  the first time it was also bad but not as bad so I gave them the benefit of the doubt  but now I'm sure I'm NEVER going back.
Olivia L.,Santa Rosa  CA,439,28,3,8/3/2013,2.0,"The restaurant itself looks nice.... but what makes a restaurant is the food. I\'m a picky eater but when my whole family doesn\'t like it there\'s obviously a problem. I went there a few months ago with my Mom and my son I can\'t remember what my Mother got but I know she wasn\'t impressed. I got a salad and I had to send it back the lettuce was discolored and looked old... My son (5) got nuggets and smiley fries. To say the least he was grossed out after he ate a bite of the smiley fry the waitress said ""they\'re so delicious!!!""  It was like a soggy bland sponge. Yeah  so tasty."
Rose W.,Santa Rosa  CA,29,20,32,2/1/2013,5.0,My boyfriend and I have been wanting to go here since they opened. Finally having enough money  we went. We were greeted  and seated. The Waiter was friendly. I will admit it took awhile to get our food  (it's expected with how crazy busy they were) and we got our dinner before the appetizer  but the waiter took the appetizer off our bill  because of it not coming before the dinner. so that was just good service. The Food was wonderful. My boyfriend had the steak and I had the pork chop with Maui waui glaze. Good prices  my taste-buds loved every bite. For our appetizer we had stuffed mushrooms with spinach and feta cheese with a lemon pesto sauce. For dessert  we had cookie with ice cream on top. The cookie was hot out of the oven  melted in the mouth. We had a great time there  and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to try delicious food.
Scott A.,Windsor  CA,50,291,250,7/1/2013,4.0,I'm impressed that my burger was a perfect medium-rare. The jalepeno part was lacking. Really cool place for a chain. They're doing it right.
Abra A.,Santa Rosa  CA,91,144,21,6/4/2014,2.0,I don't understand why people wait inline for this place. Food is so boring and just not good. I come here for happy hour late night when nothing else is open late. The drinks are good but thats about it.
Lay Lay G.,Rohnert Park  CA,2,21,1,1/10/2013,1.0,This place is awful!! The first time we went waited overall over an hour. The front idiot so called hostess was more on her phone and putting on lip gloss more than paying attention to guest. The food I give a 3 nothing fresh about it. The waitress sucked and never smiled. Then tonite when we got their we got seated near the door so called the other tables were taken. And in top of that I found a gross thick hair  when I went to move my chicken on the other side if the plate!!! Talk about being grossed out!!! I told our waitress about it and said its most likely not hair and could be melted plastic!' WTF!! Why would that even be better!! I left and went to whole foods much better food!!! I would never go back even if they comped me a free meal or paid me!
Dani D.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,15,,7/6/2013,1.0,I grew up with BJ's in So Cal so I was very excited when they opened one here and I could introduce my hubby. We have ordered to go once and it was pretty decent  would have been great if we had actually gone in and eaten. Went tonight to try again and ended up walking out before being seated. We walked in and there was a large party up at the hostess stand  one hostess was standing in the walk way so I had to turn to my left to get out of the doorway  my husband and son followed and we waited there for the hostesses (there were 3) to get done trying to figure out where they were placing this large party. It took them at least 5 minutes because everyone kept changing their minds. We were never acknowledged or spoken to however we know they knew we were there as they walked around us several times. In the mean time another couple walked in and once the sat the large party they immediately we straight on to the other couple leaving us standing there. Their hostess need to pay more attention to whats going on and if there are 3 there at the stand they need to be seating other people. It does not take 3 hostess to figure out where to seat a large party.
Angela C.,Santa Rosa  CA,3,10,,3/9/2013,1.0,THE FOOD IS DISGUSTING!!!! bland and tasteless! the shrimps were raw! just all around DISGUSTING. no other words... NO STARS
A W.,Oakland  CA,1,22,,9/17/2012,1.0,Here goes:SEVICE - 5 STARS. All staff were polite. They fulfilled are requests in a timely manner and were always around to check on your table to make sure you had everything you needed. AMBIANCE - 3 STARS. It's a pretty generic looking place. Feels very corporate to me. They have outdoor seating  which is a lovely touch and is a much quieter alternative to the indoor hall. However  outdoor seating faces the Codding Town Mall parking lot :( bummer. It's not a lovely view. Also  if you're there around sunset  you or your friends who sit facing west will have to bring a hat and sunglasses to protect your eyes. Because of the way the seating is arranged  east to west  someone will always be getting sun in their eyes. BEER - 3 Stars. The BJ's Hef was pretty watery. FOOD - 1 Stars. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with the regular (slim?) cut fries. I SO wish I could give the food more stars. However  the burger gave me food poisoning  and thats a huge no-no for any establishment. Seven hours after leaving this place I experienced shivering  chills  nausea and severe diarrhea. Yep foodborne intoxication  folks.Overall  I would give them 1.5 stars on yelp  if I could  mostly for service and ambiance. But the fact that their food makes you sick drags the rating waaay down. I also read other Yelpers mention undercooked chicken and seafood. I wish I had read their reviews before I ventured out to BJ's. I would have saved myself massive amount of pain. TL;DR - Contracted foodborne illness from burger. Will not go back.
John F.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,31,3,8/4/2014,5.0,The staff is very friendly and even when they are extremely busy they try their best to take care of everyone. I used to be a server so i know how it is and honestly these servers take a lot of shit from people who expect undivided attention during busy hours and expect 5 star quality food when this is no fancy upscale restaurant  its a casual dining restaurant so you get what you get but they put in good work considering the large crowds and demanding customers they take care of every day. I have all the respect in the world for all the servers out there.
Cat M.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,22,2,9/8/2013,3.0,First impression by the girls at the front was no bueno! Not even a hello? Seriously? Thank goodness Richard our server was super attentive but the food was just ok. Otherwise I would give them 2 stars. Definitely not coming back unless I know for sure I get Richard!
James R.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,21,,1/15/2015,2.0,A return visit to this location. Short wait for a table  but not bad for dinner time. Found the service lacking. Meals came out fairly quickly. We had to ask for a second beer about 6 times. Finally the waiter finally brought two 'tastes' before he actually brought the beer  as we were finishing our meals. Food was OK  nothing to write home about. Never asked about refilling the soda  or if we wanted dessert. Might try it again  just not any time soon.
Pat L.,Santa Rosa  CA,4,50,,11/16/2012,3.0,It isn't gourmet food but a great place for business lunches and family (with kids) dinners. Easy to get a table and something on the menu for everyone. I like 4 star restaurants for sure but I have to admit their little pizzas are tasty.
K H.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,4,,7/10/2012,5.0,"Apparently I am one of the few who has had a great time here...My boyfriend and I first went here with two of our friends for a late-lunch/early-dinner sort of meal  and in turn  we ordered a few appetizers and shared. We opted to sit in the bar for Happy Hour. My boyfriend and I had the calamari and the lettuce wraps. Our friends also got the calamari  and they got the spinach-artichoke dip. I am not a big seafood-eater  but this calamari was delicious! Not oily or flavorless  like some people seem to have encountered. The lettuce wraps were great  and the spinach-artichoke dip was wonderful! We also got a few pizookies to share afterwords  and my red velvet pizookie seemed to be the winner! We all had great service from every employee we came in contact with.Well- my boyfriend and I loved it so much that we went back one or two days later for a real dinner! We were seated in the regular dining area this time. He ordered a pasta dish (the kind escapes me) and I had the shrimp tacos. Our dinners were awesome! And again- we had great service. I also happen to really enjoy the atmosphere and decor- it feels relaxing  yet refined. A place you can dress fancy and have fun. (The first time we went  we all came from a public swimming pool  and the next time  my guy and I decided to dress up a bit- either way  I feel as if we weren\'t treated differently because we were ""under-dressed"" the first time.) Also- not only did our food taste great  it looked wonderful as well!Anywho- you can count on my boyfriend and myself being life-long customers. And we are actively recruiting more friends!"
Korva G.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,27,14,1/26/2013,2.0,"Given BJ\'s a couple tries- looks cool  good ""vibe"" but the food is not worth the visit. I wanted to like the place but there have been so many negative experiences from: cold- doughy ""deep dish"" pizza   hot and brown celery to massive use of artificial smoke flavoring in ribs  sauce and wings.... Don\'t bother. Pros: Great beer selection- probably an awesome place for happy hour but don\'t bother for dinner - wont come back- :("
KC J.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,9,,5/7/2014,1.0,Terrible. My hubby's burger arrived stone cold so we sent it back-meanwhile  not wanting to eat without him  I wait and of course now MY food is cold. Server was very sweet  but the short  squat female manager acted like she was doing us a BIG favor by taking off 25% of his burger. So after jacking up our entire experience  less than $2 is the price of our satisfaction at BJ's Brewhouse. On our last family visit  4 out of 6 entrees were bad. We won't be back.
Andrew W.,Cloverdale  CA,142,22,3,5/16/2012,1.0,"1st time at BJ\'s 2nd day its been opened.. Service was terrible.. Ordered 2 drinks and took our order also ""orange soda and peach lemonade.. Had to remind server that we didn\'t get our drinks after 10 mins.. Came back and dropped mine off and gf didn\'t get hers.. Had to tell another server and they came back 10 mins later with drink. Excuse was had technical difficulties?? After 40 mins we didn\'t get our lettuce chicken wrap yet.. Didn\'t say anything since there were very busy.. Finally came and the chicken meat was already cold.. Food arrives 20 mins later.. You can tell my pasta was sitting there because the sauce harden already and chicken was also cold.. No comment to server.. Friend asked to reheat shrimp.. Server never came back to check on us.. Another server helping customers had his butt in between the 2 tables and right infront of our faces.. layout was too tight.. Finally asked to speak to a supervisor which I never have done before.. Told her about how the server never came back to reheat shrimp.. How long it took for drinks and appetizer.. Asked for check.. A different server brought our check out as the other server tells us the shrimp is being recooked.. Had to get a supervisor approval beforehand. We said no thanks. Paid our bill which the supervisor did discount but was not the point.. Left 20% tip still and left.. Doubt I will ever go back.. We had like 5 different servers that night.. Just not a great experience for a 1st timer. It was packed giving them the benefit of doubt.. But service was the issue here..1st time I ever complained at a restaurant  so had to be pretty bad.. Left 20% tip just because I work in the tipping industry  but if i didn\'t I would have left only 10% or even less.."
T. W.,El Dorado Hills  CA,0,426,202,12/26/2012,3.0,Food is good  but the service always seems off. This was almost perfect except they put the wrong ice cream flavor on my wifes pizookie.
Deena M.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,9,1,9/15/2013,2.0,I have been to this restaurant 3 times. I thought maybe at first they were working out the details as any new business would. I really hate the service when you have to ask for something 2&3 times! Wait for drinks was really long. They lost our reservation for 13 people! I think they need a good management team to work out these issues. Food is average. Super loud.
Brendan B.,Santa Rosa  CA,73,46,1,12/3/2012,2.0,The food  while a little on the expensive side  is pretty good. The service is not. I've been here 3 or 4 times since they opened  and each time it has taken forever to get our food. I've had to remind waiters of things that they forgot  I've had appetizers show up halfway through the main course  I've been neglected for drinks  and I've had to walk my credit card up to my waiter to pay at the end of a meal. I wouldn't go out of my way to avoid this place  but I certainly wouldn't seek it out either.
Michelle J.,Santa Rosa  CA,31,6,,9/9/2013,4.0,Service was great. Can take a while to get ur food if they're really busy. Food is mos tly really good. Sandwich es and burgers can have a little too much sauce  so ask for not a lot of mayo  or whatever else is on it. Sodas are really yummy if u don't drink. It's worth it all in all. Just get to know if u want them to do something sprcial for ur irder.
Lillie K.,Auburn  CA,0,14,,6/17/2014,1.0,The service at this place is a joke! I came in with a group of 4 we all ordered sodas which came in 25 min of sitting down. Like it really takes that long to get 4 sodas! Even though we were clearly ready to order  which was only desserts  the waiter came 10 min later. Another 30 min go by no food at all and the waitress was very unprofessional and rude! We ended up being there for an hour And 15 min  just for dessert! So not worth it  this place needs to get their shit together
Abby R.,Rohnert Park  CA,23,30,13,7/16/2014,1.0,Every time I come here I'm reminded why I haven't been in a while. Super slow service!!!!! Today will be my last time coming here. I will make the drive to San Rafael the next time I get the urge for BJ's. Today's server was exceptionally slow. Took her over 10 minutes to get our drinks out. My sons Caesar salad made it out before our drinks! It took 35 min for our food to come out. We asked for waters and that took another 10 minutes. By this time I was ready to just walk.
Micah T.,Windsor  CA,0,14,7,10/17/2014,2.0,Sometimes all you want is a Juicy thick burger and a cold beer....this place has the beer.... and possibly the most tasteless dry burger I've ever eaten. Should've stuck with just the beer and enjoyed the deceivingly amazing scent of grilling meat. A true disappointment.
Rj W.,Santa Rosa  CA,33,23,21,4/21/2013,2.0,Honestly  I did not think I would be back after my first experience. My husband and I ordered steak and salads and it took over an hour for our salad to come out and another half hour for our steaks to arrive  and they were well done (ordered medium rare) But then I received a gift card for Christmas and we decided to got back on a week day. The service was improved but still over all lacking. I was very impressed with the food though. My husband loved his burger and we both love the calamari  it was delicious and cooked to perfection. We have been back a few times now and Its pretty consistent good food  bad service.
Nancy M.,Petaluma  CA,69,89,5,4/17/2013,2.0,Party of 7 for lunch; arrived at 11AM when the place was mostly empty. Two hours later we got our check. Food good; service very bad. 'Nuff said.
Christopher J.,San Carlos  CA,0,9,1,9/5/2015,1.0,"Unacceptable. Service was unbelievably slow and painful. What we thought was going to be a quick Saturday afternoon lunch turned into a 2.5 endeavor in which our sides came out before our meal and our drinks after our food. We never got our silverware until we had to ask for it twice. We honestly will never come back due the lack of service. I had to go find another server since I couldn\'t find a manager after being neglected for more than 35 min after our dry dead food came out. Mind you we had asked why our food took so long and our servers reply was ""that\'s a good question"" when we all know she obviously forgot to do her simple task of putting the order into the computer system. Must be hard to be that incompetent I\'m assuming.. Anyways.. The foods average.. And the service was by far the worst thing ever.. I would have rather gone to a salad bar or cook a meal for myself at least then I\'d know why my meal took 2.5 hours."
Carl S.,Santa Rosa  CA,79,12,4,6/23/2012,3.0,Burgers sucked. Fries were good. Beer was good. Service was slow but good. Friend had the pork sandwich  which was realllllly good.
Niki B.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,1,1,7/28/2013,2.0,I've given BJ's 3 tries I tried the fish tacos and was very salty  and I have tried the pasta with Alfredo sauce and chicken  first of all the chicken was dry  and the pasta did not come with much sauce  my friend tried the steak and he said it was not that great.Only thing I had good was my drink and dessert.I really think they need to step it up with food  I've had other friends say they have the same experience  too bad. Cheesecake Factory would have been a better option.There food is much better.
Amber M.,Rohnert Park  CA,14,36,6,5/19/2012,4.0,The only things stopping me from giving a 5 star review was the wait to get seated & the sun roasting us diners on the patio. Despite being open just under a week & it being a Saturday night  the service was great! Attentive without being annoyingly hovering. I had the Black & Bleu Burger. It was excellent...so delicious! My daughter had the opened face pot roast sandwich...she loved her meal  too! They have quite the extensive menu & TONS of beer choices  plus mixed drinks & wine. We also each had the Pizookie Trio for dessert...too much for one person  but perfect for sharing! We had leftovers to munch on later! Can't wait to try other items on the menu.
Jesus R.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,14,,9/16/2015,1.0,I'm a fan of BJ's and I come here quite often and service is always great even when its busy. Today something was off I come here around 1ish and its got a good amount of people there but not crazy busy. I had to wait to be seated about 10min no big deal and when we got seated we were helped right away and got our drinks which came quickly and then we ordered which is when it all went downhill. me and my boyfriend ordered off the lunch special he got soup and salad and I got a pizza. His food came out right away while I was sitting with no food. We also had no silverware. The server made several trips past our table but did not comment on how I haven't received my meal. He was done eating by the time mine finally came. We ordered a refill on the soup which took 30min to get and then got a pizookie which took a long time too  overall we were there roughly around 2 hours. The server was nice but had no sense of urgency and was very slow moving. I paid through the app and then booked it I've never had slow service like this in the past even on a busy friday night. our orders were very simple and it was only the two of us so and it wasn't busy so I'm not sure if maybe today was just an bad day for BJ's maybe they were short staffed  whatever the reason I hope My next visit will go more smoothly.
Scott A.,Santa Rosa  CA,31,41,2,10/11/2012,2.0,Typical over priced  under quality mass market chain restaurant food. Nicer atmosphere than Applebees or similar theme multi-chain restaurants  but the food quality was mediocre at best.
Ross G.,Santa Rosa  CA,16,31,10,10/11/2012,5.0,Just appetizers  beer and the Giants. My friends and I had blast. The calamari was excellent  the combo platter appetizer with Spring Rolls  Avocado Egg rolls  chips with Artichoke dip were perfect. Ordered mini Bruschetta's  they were yummy. We had the harvest hefenwiser beer  it was my first with harvest style beer but it was ok. 5 stars for the service  food  and the ambiance.
Channy L.,Santa Rosa  CA,46,34,35,4/13/2013,3.0,This place is a hit or miss on food and service. I have been here a hand full of times. At times the food is very good and others not so much; it is very inconsistent. I continue to return because of the great dessert selections.
Kimiko N.,Santa Rosa  CA,19,82,,6/17/2012,3.0,"I feel like the people who work there are SUpEr nice but everything is so commercial I just really couldn\'t get in to it. The food tasted ""Sysco-esque"" and I felt like I was in a busy airport. They sat us at a super small table with a toddler who kind of stuck out in the middle of the server and bathroom ""runway"". Yea  I usually sit my extremely destructive child on the inside of the table lest he attack the server or any innocent passerby. I must reiterate however  the staff was so wonderful. Kudos on the hiring  I just think I will have to attend on a slower day."
Tech M.,Petaluma  CA,4,125,75,7/18/2012,4.0,Glad we have a BJ's in Santa Rosa. Kind of a cross between Applebee's and Cheesecake Factory. HUGE menu which I have enjoyed many items on. Appetizers are also very big and service is overall very good
Douglas L.,Cotati  CA,20,49,12,3/24/2013,3.0,Good food  excellent service but it is so loud you have to yell to talk to your guests around the table
Kanani S.,Santa Rosa  CA,69,232,85,7/2/2012,3.0,I was actually impressed considering all the bad reviews and feedback I got from a few friends who have gone here. I understand the place is new and there's obvious bugs to be worked out  but honestly Sonoma County  you have to admit this is one of the better places that's opened up in a LONG LONG time  especially in Coddingtown. My girlfriends and I were seated promptly on a sunny sunday around 3:30. The place wasn't extremley busy but had a good crowd inside. We ordered the buffalo chicken mini pizza and the great white mini pizza  both were good  a little burnt on the crust but still had good flavor. We all leaned more towards the buffalo chicken pizza then the great white. The appetizer sampler was decent  a bit smaller than what I was expecting for $17 but it worked. We weren't a fan of the avacado egg rolls but the mini southwestern egg rolls were good and we swapped out the artichoke dip for the potato skins  loved the potato skins. Our favorite part was the watermelon mojitos! Probably one of the best ones I've had in Sonoma County. All in all the place wasn't bad and wasn't great  but a nice place to pop into grab a couple drinks w/ the friends or significant other. I wouldn't mind going back :)
Jennifer H.,Santa Rosa  CA,3,24,1,1/31/2014,3.0,I have to agree with other posts regarding service time...waitress was very nice  but seemed forgetful and scattered. Our appetizers came and then 5 minutes later she came by with plates; some food brought to the table was cold and over cooked...kids meal came with what seemed like a double order of large fries...ordered two of the same dessert but only one was brought over (charged for two)...not sure we will be back anytime soon...for what we paid I'd rather try another restaurant in town
Skip W.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,10,,5/5/2013,3.0,I've been to BJs several times over the past year and the quality of service is so inconsistent that overall it averages out to be a pretty mediocre experience. When a member of the staff actually pays attention to you and gets you what you ordered then eating here is rather nice. However  several times I have had to wait very long  or my appetizers come out after my meal does. They have so many servers on the floor  yet I often see them chatting amongst themselves and trying to coordinate who is serving which table. The other night when I went my beer was flat and it took more than 20 minutes to get my server's attention to ask for a different beer (which was also somewhat flat...)When everything does go smoothly  things are good. The menu is typical pub food; pizza  sandwiches  burgers  salads  dinner entrees  but with diverse choices within those categories. Their home-brewed beer is not bad either  and their taster glasses are larger (somewhere around 4-6oz). The atmosphere is nice  large and open with plenty of sports on the many TVs. If they can fix the service bugs I'd give em 4 stars.
Wulfstan C.,Santa Rosa  CA,21,427,,10/5/2012,3.0,This is a chain  not something I normally bother with  but I have ended up here when stuck in the Coddingtown area.  So far  I've been a couple times and enjoyed it enough to be satisfied but also enough to see that it has clear limitations. I was always there at lunch when it was only moderately busy - enough to be lively but not too much to really test the place. I have only eaten a couple of their salads  which were enjoyable and with good flavour  reasonable balance of veggies and meat  etc.  but also with that clear  rather crude mass-produced-food quality. I am skeptical of most of their dishes and thus avoid them. Beer is ok - pleasant enough  but very simple  a bit crude. Service I have always found to be very good and friendly. The place  contrary to some comments  always seemed clean when I was there  and the decor is quite nice and attractive. This is about 2-3 stars  but I will say that I am satisfied with their two different salads with chicken accompanied by a beer  so overall the experiences and food which I have actually had warrant a 3.
Sean S.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,44,1,3/27/2014,1.0,What a mess! I've been to a BJ's in the Bay Area that was great but this Santa Rosa one sucks!! Incompetent servers  hair in my salad  ice cold soup  manager said will remove items from my bill  then forgot to  maybe the only decent thing here is a beer...eat elsewhere!
Jeff B.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,8,,10/6/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,Much improved. Will go back again. When this place opened it was a mess. They have brought up the service the food good to great. Try the gumbo. It's a little spicey from the sausage but o' so good.
Kelly H.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,16,,8/10/2014,1.0,Never again. I have tried this place three times and it's three strikes you're out. The service is HORRIBLE. Orders were wrong  took forever to get our food and our drinks and although the waitress was nice she clearly was in over her head. The prices are a bit steep for the quality of the food but not unreasonable. However  the place is so loud that you can't hear people at the same table talking.
Daryus C.,Cotati  CA,0,49,1,3/31/2013,5.0,I'm somewhat of a food snob and even more of a customer service snob. Needless to say  I came with my reservations about BJs. Actually  I flat out expected to dislike it. Then I had the hamburger. It was huge. The bun was toasty and probably the best bun in Santa Rosa. The meat was surprisingly fresh for a chain restaurant and very tasty. I had the burger that comes with those little deepfried jalapenos... wow. If you go to BJs  try this burger. To top it off  they treated me like royalty from the second I walked in the door. I don't look like royalty and I definitely don't act like it. So  here's to you  BJ!
joe s.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,28,,6/21/2012,2.0,The food is okay if all restaurants in Santa Rosa are closed  slow service  there was hardly any liquor in my Mojito. No  I am not visiting this place again and so do you!
Sierra K.,Forestville  CA,2,5,,3/21/2013,1.0,My boyfriend and I went there for the first time yesterday. We got there at 7 and ordered the calamari to start. It was kind of soggy and the sauces on the side were spilling over the sides. We weren't very hungry so we split the dinner with lobster and salmon. I would eat the veggies and rice and he would eat the meat. After we got our food  the waiter didn't even bother to check in on us. We finished eating at 7:30 and the waiter finally came back at 7:58. That's half an hour of waiting  with empty drink glasses. We wanted BJ's to redeem itself with dessert  but by that time we just wanted to leave. At least the decor was nice.
Nathan J.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,29,,7/27/2014,1.0,Tried three times  consistently bad service. Food items delivered were inconsistent with menu description and cold  checks incorrect  inattentive staff. I'm over it.
j b.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,27,1,6/9/2012,1.0,The pizza is The Best PIZZA in town. Whole wheat crust is divine  thick and not greasy. Baked to perfection. The barbeque chicken pizza is fab. However  I have visited BJ's twice and service is very slow. I know they are new and there will be a learning curve but it has to improve soon or they will lose customers. I objected another time to visit due to fear of slow service. Took longer to get the Pizookie than the Pizza. The waiters are green but very sweet and try hard. But whatever is going on in the kitchen I believe is not working. My other complaint is the extreme NOISE. So loud that one must be prepared to shout to your table group. Feels a bit stressful and not a relaxing eating experience. I don't understand why there isn't some glass in the dividers to help with sound. It is just a large room filled with many tables. Who designed this? Great if you have screaming babies or toddlers as no one will hear them. Poor design when it comes to noise. I am sorry they chose this as I enjoy their food but the experience will give you a headache and sore throat.
Randy S.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,4,,6/23/2013,2.0,I have no idea what all the buzz about this place is. The food is mediocre to just plain bad. On top of that the price for the food is ridiculously high. The cocktails are terrible. Their new jack berry whatever is just plain bad. And I know my drinks. Normally a drink like this would taste like a Lynchburg lemonade except with a blackberry twist. Wrong! Not here just taste like warm jack with syrup. The only thing this place has going for them is their beer and their service. The problem with that is the damn appetizer. I ordered came 2 minutes before my meal. Like that makes any sense to do for a customer. Coddingtown must be charging them top dollar for rent if I'm paying a ton of money for poor food and bad drinks. The only reason I'm even giving it 2 stars instead of one is because the waitress was fantastic.
Sherry P.,Windsor  CA,1,29,21,9/27/2012,4.0,Hostess  seater and server were all friendly. We needed quick service  and they got us out on time. Enjoyed my beer and my Thai shimp appetizer. Fun atmostphere. I will go back.
A P.,Healdsburg  CA,7,21,,9/27/2012,2.0,Went on a Saturday night  it was crowded. We got in much quicker than expected  but once we sat it was at least 10 minutes before we got a drink  and had to ask for waters about 4 times. Food took forever  and was not good. I ordered most expensive steak on the menu  it had fatty bad spots and meager portion of potatoes to go with it. Disappointing  but what can you expect from a chain...
Stink C.,Santa Rosa  CA,3,95,35,8/20/2012,2.0,The service is decent. The pasta dish with the Alfredo sauce is bland. The broccoli.is under-cooked on the pasta dish. The ahi salad is better.
Ezra B.,San Francisco  CA,13,203,4,6/17/2012,3.0,Like all the other reviews the service was no good. Seemed like no one knew what they were doing  yet got our food while it was still hot and didn't have any real problems. Just a general sense of bewilderment by the staff. Food  typical chain restaurant stuff  nothing special besides the PIZOOKI!! Holy ice cream and half baked cookie Batman!! That's the only reason I would come back. Respect it.
Adam K.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,13,2,3/24/2013,3.0,Food was great  sandwich was great! Fries were also great. Only downside was the waitress. Kind of a bitch.
Leslie G.,Benicia  CA,84,35,1,7/30/2012,3.0,My mom lives in Santa Rosa so I visit the area often. The town really needed a place like this and I have to say I enjoyed my tortilla soup and salad. We ordered the avocado wontons hoping that they would be as good as the Cheesecake Factory's.... Not close but okay :o) I think that this restaurant is trying to mimic the CF with lower prices. Got to apppreciate this place for what it is which is definitely not the CF but a decent fun place to visit with good service  great selection  and okay food.
Monica K.,Santa Rosa  CA,64,73,4,8/15/2012,3.0,The people there are usually nice  and the food is good  especially their dessert. Sometimes it takes a little while for them to bring you the food. I am a vegetarian so there aren't many options for us. The pizookie with the red velvet and vanilla ice cream is my favorite!! The prices aren't too bad  and it's nice that they're open late so you can still go out to eat if you're working late.
chris b.,San Francisco  CA,0,1,,5/21/2012,3.0,The good: happy servers who are trying hard; full bar; wide beer selection; menu has something for everyone.The OK: food. Nothing we ordered was bad  and nothing particularly memorable. OK.The bad: Where are the bar TVs??!! More seats in the Bar face the walls rather then the tvs behind the bar  yet there are none. Sports bars need many more tvs in the bar. Really odd to have a good set up behind the bar and nothing to the sides until you get 20 years over in the restaurant.
Live F.,New York  NY,5,25,,11/6/2013,5.0,Great food !!!! And the host and server where very pleasant. No waiting and the place was busy
Susan C.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,15,,7/16/2014,2.0,"We have been to BJ\'s several times since they came to Coddingtown and this time I can see they are taking short cuts and the food quality has gone down. The service has gone down as well. Tonight I order a new featured salad the beet salad. When it came a picked through it and found only 7 tiny slivers of beet among drown arugala. They had over dressed the arugala with their strawberry vinagerette. I sent it back and said I expected beet in a beet salad. When the waiter came back with an excuse it was "" we were running low on beets"". I said that was a poor excuse  that if that was the case you take it off the menu. He agreed with me  but after I ordered a different salad they came out with a hot version of the beet salad that was predominant with beets and a short while later the other salad that I ordered came. Well  they credited the beet salad and I had them box up both and took them home.The last time we were there the waiter couldn\'t tell me what was in one of the sauces and when the manager was nearby later I inquired about the training of the wait staff and my disappointment with the knowlege of the menu and this particular waiter and he said he would help him learn it better.So  good luck to all of you who risk eating at Bjs."
Nikki W.,Salinas  CA,60,295,119,6/7/2012,3.0,We were excited to try this out since it is new and when we've gone to BJ's in Vacaville it was pretty good. Not this time. The only reason I'm giving them 3 stars is because the service was good and we didn't have to wait very long for a table. BUT the food was not very good  dry hamburger  crusty celery with the buffalo wings  old tasting fries  chicken nugget-like buffalo wings and the best thing we had was the pizza  which was OK. So we'll probably try it again but for the first time around it was as bad as Applebee's.
April V.,Santa Rosa  CA,32,58,,6/28/2012,5.0,I really love the overall experience of this restaurant. We needed some excitement in this town! They make great cocktails. I had a Hypnotic special drink that was recommended and it was perfect. I really like the mac n chees  hamburgers  and ahi tuna salad. Even the watermelon salad was delicious. It sounds weird but it is yummy. I have always had good service. You can't be to harsh on judging a brand new restaurant on there first few days of opening. Anyway  beers are really good too.
Earl H.,Watsonville  CA,8,21,1,9/27/2012,5.0,Great place! We stumbled upon BJ's on Sept 1  2012 and although there was a 10 minute wait for a table the salad  pizza  and beer were very good. Service was very good as well  and price was good.
Julia R.,Sonora  CA,0,4,,12/26/2012,1.0,Would NOT reccomend this restaurant at all! Poor service and the food was below standards. When we finally got the food - an hour after ordering- it was wrong. When we got there we were one of three tables. Still took 1 hour to get the food and another 20 to settle rhe bill - and we had a kid with us! Don't waste your time or money!
Christine D.,Sebastopol  CA,0,8,,6/15/2014,1.0,I have been to this location twice in the past week. Both times the service was awful. When I went for lunch during the week it wasn't that busy yet my server messed up my drink order twice. And i only ordered a Diet Coke. Not really sure how you can mess that up but she did. When i went yesterday it was more crowded which meant the service was a lot worse. I ordered a burger with cheddar cheese. I got a turkey burger with swiss instead. I would have sent it back if my server ever came back. It took my husband at least 10 minutes to get ketchup. While we were there  another couple sent their food back as well. I would avoid this place at all costs. It is sad when a chain like this is just this awful.
Thomas E.,Windsor  CA,6,4,6,8/25/2012,1.0,Let's be specific: ice tea  mini pizza and house salad was only $10! Far cheaper than other places  but geez it was bad. I've had surprisingly better at Denny's and great meals at the Cheesecake Factory. Here  the produce on the salad was underripe and dry served with the wrong dressing. The pizza was just dough  salty  and flavorless. Cheap meal...you get what you pay for?
Mark F.,San Francisco  CA,22,27,,12/7/2013,1.0,Waited quite a while for a table. Then over 15 minutes to get waiter to take order. Another half hour to get food and yep  order was wrong. Waiter explained it was not his fault and then waited again for my meal while my dining companion finished theirs. Bill came and no apology. Not even a comped beverage. Yikes. Really bad service all around.
anthony f.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,12,,8/7/2012,1.0,I should have known Deep Dish Pizza at a sportsbar  I ask for extra sauce and they actually put less on  the pizza was raw and doughy just like I feared it would be.The waitress got our chicken wing order wrong and brought out these frozen deep fried balls they call bonless chicken wings  which we did not order  they were awful.We ate one piece of pizza and threw the rest away. I mean the chesee was still not melted in certain places  really!!!!Don't waste your momey  on as I call it PRE-FAB food.We were tired from playing tourist all day with our out of town friends  or we would have sent it all back.
Kimberley P.,Rohnert Park  CA,12,12,7,2/14/2014,4.0,First time there after finding out Sweet River Saloon was closed. Monica was our server and Katie was manager for the evening. My husband and I brought our 13 year old daughter with us. We had artichokes  Avacado Egg Rolls  and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers. Monica came back and said they had no stuffed mushrooms. The Avacado Egg Rolls were fantastic and reminded me of the Cheese Cake Factory ones but almost better. The Artichoke dip was very good and then for some reason the Stuffed mushrooms showed up. There was obviously a lack of communication. My husband ordered a burger and fries which was good but nothing to set it apart from any other ordinary burger. He also had the Cesear Salad which was fantastic. The presentation was lacking. I had the Chicken Alfredo. The presentation was not good. The chicken was over cooked and dry and served on the side of the Alfredo Pasta. The pasta was great but I would revommend watching the cook time on the chicken and serve it on top of the pasta with some sauce. My daughter had Minestrone soup which she loved and the speghetti. She ate all of it. Over all I really liked the atmosphere  presentation should be looked at but the staff was great. The manager even comped us for the mushrooms since we were told they did not have them.. Monica and Katie did a great job. Lets jyst hope Bj's looks at their reviews.
Katie R.,Petaluma  CA,177,11,2,5/30/2012,4.0,I always have loved BJs  and this new location in Santa Rosa is great too! It was super crowded when we went on a Thursday evening with a 2 hour wait  but I'm sure that's just cause it recently opened for business. We were incredibly lucky to snag a first come first serve booth in the bar shortly after we got there. Their pizza is always great  beers are good  we love the avocado spring rolls. Our server was great too  although you could tell he was incredibly busy he still stopped to chat and was funny and prompt. I'm sure the wait time will get shorter as they are open for longer. Awesome food  very consistent!
Johnny W.,Seattle  WA,1,7,,2/27/2014,3.0,Decent burgers  a bit overcooked. Overpriced  fries should not be ala carte  but the best in Willits if you wanna have a beer with your burger.
Juliet R.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,2,,11/4/2012,1.0,I have no idea how other locations compare but the Santa Rosa BJ's was not a good experience!!! It is AWFUL!!! We had eaten in the restaurant a few months ago being that it was local and new and we wanted to check it out. We split a burger and both felt icky later that day  but weren't sure it was the food from here or something else..... **Side Note- We were told by our waiter that it is the same people that run the Cheesecake Factory chain....**Just the other night  we had both worked late and were too tired to think about dinner. We decided to give BJ's Restaurant another try and ordered take-out.. OMG was it awful (again!) and way over priced! Do not waste your money or time!!!! Horrible horrible!!! BJ's stands for BAD JOKE! Not a good addition to Coddingtown!
Jayne C.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,51,2,2/23/2014,3.0,been twice now  once for drinks and appetizers and the other for dinner. waitress was really nice  food was ok. its loud so dont expect to be able to hear anyone at your table  typical bar food but more expensive
Ashley E.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,9,,5/12/2014,3.0,The drinks are great  especially the beers. My personal favorite is the Jamaican Red. Their service so far has been great  but the food is awful. Everything is way over spiced  soups come cold  and I feel I make better dishes at home.
Kim R.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,36,2,6/23/2012,3.0,Have been back three times since my original post and have to say that it must have been the new staff and the large crowd because this is not the same BJS. I have not had the same food that made me sick but the flat bread and appitizers are all great. It is pretty expensive but we came to watch the World Series and it was full of energetic people without any of the drunken slobs. The bar area is the best place to sit right next to the huge TV. The bar is self serve so no wait time most of the time. The servers have all been good the only thing is the floor is slick. It's not a bad thing just something worth noting.
John M.,Santa Rosa  CA,3,34,,12/2/2013,2.0,not the cleanest place to eat. there was what appeared to some ones dirty t-shirt on the floor of the hall leading to the bathrooms  the floors had food on them in the main dinning area where we were seated  and our server had many food stains on her shirt. That said  the food was OK  nothing special  the starters came at the same time as the main dishes.
Crissy S.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,7,,8/25/2012,3.0,"I had the french dip which was pretty good. Fries were a Little soggy but I think that was from my sandwich. The kids had mac n cheese and my daughter who eats almost anything did NOT like it. I do like the seating (HUGE booths) and atmosphere. My 5year old can be ""grumpy"" at times so I like that it is loud enough where no one will hear him lol I heard they have great pizza so I think I will bring the family back again."
Gene D.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,7,,8/22/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,This place sucks  the service is horrible  bunch of young inexperienced servers  with a less than sharp female manager  Applebee's type food  only more expensive  scratch this place off your list!
Renie S.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,3,,8/20/2012,2.0,"I came here for the 1st time ever about a month ago and had a great experience. I was so excited to come back again. Today  I came in with a big group. We had reservations  and when we showed up on time  the male employee who was seating guests treated us with horrible customer service. He did not have the table ready for us and rudely had us sit on the chairs and wait. Take in mind that the restaurant was barely busy. I thought reservations were to be seated at the time you make them for?He then made it very difficult for us to ""check in."" He mispronounced the party name we had our reservations under and when we corrected him  he didn\'t think the party was actually us. This one interaction set us up for not the best experience here. I believe the host should be a welcoming and friendly face for guests when they come in  and I did not feel welcomed at all today."
Mel M.,Windsor  CA,0,23,,2/11/2013,1.0,"This place sucked!!! I still wish yelp would allow zero stars  because 1 is too good for this place. The service was HORRIBLE  as well as the crap they serve as food. Barely saw the crappy waiter we had  & when we did  he took plates that still had food  without asking if we were done (which we weren\'t)  & he seemed very put out. by having to DO HIS JOB & serve us...Tip: if you don\'t like serving people  get a different job...you\'d be better off at McD\'s or JitB with that attitude. The idiot food runner brought our ""food"" out  & I was supposed to have garlic bread with mine...she didn\'t say anything about it not being ready or anything...just dropped the sh*t food & ran...so when we finally get our waiters attention  & mention my BF had not gotten the vinegar with his fish & chips & I did not get my garlic bread  he sighed heavily  rolled his eyes  walked away & got the vinegar  then came back & said the bread wasn\'t ready & would take a couple of minutes. Sad to say  the garlic bread was the best part of the meal (but they\'re small pieces).I did not really want to go there at all  but I had gotten a gift card  so I figured  eh might as well use it...huge mistake...I should have just thrown it away...or asked any idiot that likes it if they wanted it. F**k it  I should have just handed it to a bum...trust me  I would have done that had I known how that whole experience was going to turn out.Needless to say I walked out of there freakin\' pissed!!Please do not go to this place & support it...I really want to see it close down."
America F.,San Francisco  CA,20,151,2,12/12/2013,3.0,I did have any major problems with the place everyone was nice. The food was fine. It took a few tries to get a to go container but everything ended well. I didn't like that the place was so small. It wasn't as clean as I would like it to be.
S. M.,San Rafael  CA,0,10,,7/21/2012,5.0,After reading so many poor reviews  we approached BJs with some trepidation  but were immensely pleased with our experience. 1:00 pm lunch on a Friday was very pleasant.  Service was attentive. Manager apologetically informed us of a menu change - quite gracious.  Whenever we wanted our server  Kathleen  she was always easy to find  and polite and helpful. The food & beer were delicious. The decor and atmosphere are lovely - yes  a higher noise level  but in our cozy booth  conversation was easy. I tend to be rather a grump  but found nothing to inspire that at BJs.
Ashley R.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,68,,6/17/2013,2.0,"I think my time at BJ\'s has come to an end. We came in yesterday and we had two beers and their boneless hot wings. Ten very small chicken mcnuggets for ten dollars. And $6.25 beers that would cost you 4 or 5 anywhere else. I finally realized that at BJ\'s you won\'t get any deals. And all their happy hour food items are discounted but also ""happy hour size""...so basically a smaller portion for less price. That\'s not a deal  that\'s just paying less for less food. I don\'t know  I think I\'d rather spend my money somewhere else. I will say that the wait staff has always been pleasant and attentive - 5 stars for that."
Susan W.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,19,,4/7/2013,1.0,I wish there was something less than one star because they don't deserve even one. I've been there at least 20 times  why? With hopes that it will get better... The beer sucks  food sucks  service sucks. Every time I've gone there they've messed up at least one persons order from my table. It's frustrating! I get the same burger every time too and it comes with avocado and a special sauce. About a dozen times they haven't brought it out with no avocado or sauce and when I tell the server that it wasn't on it they look at me like I'm out of my mind and making things up. The only good thing is the Pazookies  and even they have come out burnt a few times. I noticed that they are always posting for a kitchen manager on craigslist and it makes sense because they cant seem to get it right. My favorite sushi place was torn down to put this place in and its terrible!
Samantha D.,Petaluma  CA,25,3,,5/24/2013,1.0,This is the worst BJ's ever. Been here 4 times  orders wrong each time. This time we waited almost an hour for our food  and when it finally came it was wrong  Luke warm  and salad lettuce was super wilted and old. No refills offered on drinks. Waitress wasn't exactly rude  but certainly not friendly. My sis ordered a pizzookie to go  and the cookie wasnt cooked all the way. Disappointing since the other BJ's I've visited are the complete opposite!
Stephanie C.,Rohnert Park  CA,3,94,4,8/7/2013,2.0,This is really attractive place with a convenient location attached to the Coddingtown Mall. I've been here a total of three times now and the service has been good each time. However I have to subtract one star because the food isn't consistent. Each time I've gone  I've ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger (I know  I know  I'm the real adventurous type) with the request that it be cooked medium. One time it was perfect  another it was a undercooked (I'm talking cool and red in the center) and had to be sent back and this most recent time it was overcooked to the point of being super dry. It's a relatively new place so I think they are still finding their groove. The ambiance is great and the bar is beautiful. This would be a cool place to come for a happy hour and maybe a couple appetizers and it certainly is the best dining option for anyone that wants to take a break from shopping and grab some grub.  There is a lot of potential here so I'll be back at a later date.
J W.,Rohnert Park  CA,16,62,2,3/3/2014,4.0,I like the food is really good and the beer's not bad It's a large menu with lots of options. It's super super loud though.
Peggy K.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,66,,11/14/2012,4.0,So surprised to read negative reviews of this beautiful restaurant. We live nearby and often go there for the reasonably priced and very tasty lunch specials (flatbread pizza is a favorite). We have stopped in for mid-afternoon appetizers as well and love the potato skins. When it first opened  there were some problems with inexperienced young servers  but we have had great friendly service since that time. An upscale-feeling  beautifully decorated restaurant is long overdue in this part of town... we are happy to have BJs at Coddingtown!
Harminder D.,Rohnert Park  CA,28,60,13,6/22/2013,2.0,"Went here on Fathers Day for dinner. We arrived early  around 4:30pm  to avoid waiting for a table and we were seated quickly. We started off with the spinach and artichoke dip with chips. The chips were crunchy and warm. The dip was also warm but may have been a little more hotter. It seems that it may have been microwaved and then torched on top to give it a ""fresh"" look. I ordered a veggie baked potato  my mom ordered the veggie burger  and my dad ordered a deep dish pizza. The food took a while to get. We waited about 35-40 minutes! The baked potato could have had more toppings on it. The veggies and cheese on top were sparse and there was no butter in the potato giving it a dry taste. My mom\'s veggie burger only included a bun with a little bit of butter  lettuce  and tomato - there was no cheese  mayo or mustard. Disappointing. My dad\'d pizza was impressive. The only good things: their root bear and pazooki. Our waitress was nice."
Seth G.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,2,,9/15/2012,1.0,This was our 2nd visit to BJs and this was a terrible experience. The first visit was average. We started with potato skins that were inedible. Some of them came plain with none of the toppings (cheese  bacon  etc.) and they had a soapy taste. I rarely send food back  but this was terrible. Next came the entrees. My wife's salad and my ahi salad were decent  but would not suggest them to others. My son had the mini burgers and he was satisfied. My daughter was served UNCOOKED chicken strips. We had to ask 2 times for the manager to complain. The chicken didn't even look cooked on the outside. Needless to say we will not be back!
Rachele G.,Santa Rosa  CA,109,17,,6/30/2012,5.0,One word Amazing. Our waitress Erika took great care of us. She took our order and was fast at bring us our order. There was a mix up at another table and she gave us a free dessert to start then our potato skins came with our entrees and she felt bad and didn't charge us for them. She was very good at coming by and making sure we were doing okay throughout the whole meal. Even got us some more drinks really fast. Tonight they were busy but she acted like we were the only ones here. Totally coming back.
Tee R.,Costa Mesa  CA,7,17,,3/10/2013,1.0,Mediocre all around  took forever just to get a couple glasses of water  they screwed up our order then it took 20min and asking 2 different people 4 times for sugar for my coffee  this place is a joke
Ruby L.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,3,,1/9/2015,1.0,"Just got back from BJ\'s in Santa Rosa. What started out as a great family evening quickly went down hill fast. We had to wait about 15 minutes which wasn\'t that bad considering it was dinner time on a Friday night. We were a party of four adults and three kids. Placed our order with 2 appetizers and waited 45 minutes just to get the those. These were good. It took another 25 minutes for some of our meals to come after we had finished the appetizers. The kids got theirs first which was a good thing - However the spaghetti was a only a table spoon full of sauce over a bowl of clumped dried out noodles  yuck! This is when it got really fun  the next four meals came out each about 10 minutes apart and each one regressing further. By the time the last of the four meals was brought out which was a hamburger no bun Paleo style. This thing was a joke  it was a golf ball sized patty half broken tossed all over the plate. As its being handed over  the waiter is mumbling saying "" I know we are missing some components to the burger but the chef is working on it"". We\'re already talking 1 1/2 hrs! This is when we had enough. The patty was cold enough to stop a nose bleed and small enough to be considered a booger:) My mom\'s meal that\'s a whole other story. 30 minute ordeal and the meal couldn\'t be eaten! At this point in the dinner we had already pasted the point of no return and were just trying not to laugh or make the wait staff  who was working and trying very hard not to get more flustered. All this being said I felt bad for the staff because clearly something was wrong from deep inside the room where they killed I mean cooked the food. Will we eat there again  no  would I recommend the place to anyone  yes  but only to a Sasquatch! Trust me it was that bad and I never like to complain. We had to ask 2 different time to see the manager and finally after a good 20 minutes he came and apologized and said he would make it right. Not! He comped us half the bill when 75% of the meals were not right. We paid the bill just so we could get out of there but we left angry  dissapointed  and hungry!"
Maureen W.,Windsor  CA,0,20,,6/18/2012,1.0,Noisy  slow service & bad food. Who puts cold canned tomatoes on pizza? Not going back.
Raul H.,San Diego  CA,1,6,,11/25/2013,3.0,The service was very slow today due to inexperience on part of the waiter. Though we had a large party of 10 people we thought it might be slow for a Monday. After a conversation with the manager  she rectified the situation and gave us a nice credit on our bill due to the bad waiter service. The food was good and plentiful just wish it had been quicker- and by that I mean it took us approx 35 minutes to get our drinks  if that gives you an idea.
Kevin P.,Santa Rosa  CA,5,27,8,7/7/2012,1.0,"Another in a line of big chain restaurants that are portraying themselves as a neighborhood family restaurant. It was a Sunday night (7/1) and my in laws  sister in law  her kids and my wife ""ate stuff that is food"". Ok  first strike  Full bar means you can serve most cocktails found in NY Bartenders Guide or Mixology Apps. So in our Italian family  our drink is the Negroni. A simple drink of Campari and Gin (we skip the sweet vermouth). After 20 minutes  several visits from the server and dictating the proportions  ""we are missing a key ingredient "" reports the waitress---that\'d be Campari since they\'ve got to have Gin. Second strike is my father in law isn\'t drinking since he\'s driving. We asked several times for water  even a pitcher of water ""we don\'t do pitchers of water"" said our waitress. A brew house doesn\'t have a pitcher to put water into.. \'Koko the Ape\' would have understood and been able to complete this task. And now strike three- as there are several incidents  this is a collective strike. BJ\'s didn\'t serve my wife or her sister the right entree  which then took about 10 minutes to replace. It took over 10 minutes to get my wife a glass of wine and 15 for my beer for dinner. My nephew\'s fries tasted like fish  since they were most lkikely deep fried in the same oil as the fish...I can go on  but why. Summation. Thirsty for a beer and not too hungry yet not in the mood for food  well then this plasticized palace of bland food platitudes is your place. I\'ll not be returning  unless I am sent to food hell  where BJ\'s  AppleBees  Cheesecake Factory  Cracker Barrel and their ilk reside...Food Hell Hint: When your menu is laminated  bound and comes with pictures=Same as frozen food box at the grocery store!!!"
Sara Y.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,9,2,6/30/2013,1.0,I keep giving BJ's the benefit of the doubt-they are busy  they are training new people  the restaurant just opened  etc.  but in the past year I've been there 4 times and every time I've experienced terrible service and mediocre food. Just today we sat down for lunch at 2:00 and our waitress forgot to bring our kids drinks for 45 minutes  never came to check on us once  ordered me the wrong meal and completely neglected our table.  We will never go back  I wish the Cheesecake Factory opened there instead.
Stuart K.,San Jose  CA,93,46,,7/3/2012,5.0,Omg the best service I have ever had at a restaurant! Not to mention the food was amazing! They brought our appetizer at the same time as the entrees which wasn't a big deal but out waitress  Erica an excellent server automatically comped the appetizer and gave us a free desert!! I highly recommend this place and the potato skins!!
Ashlee Y.,Santa Rosa  CA,63,12,,12/1/2012,1.0,"We went for dessert for my mom\'s birthday. I had somehow avoided ever going to a BJs even after living in the east bay for awhile. However  it was mom\'s pick so we went. I may have had some preconceived notions about corporate chain places like this  but I was actually surprised in just how bad it was. First  it was an extremely stormy night so the waxed floor was so slippery I almost fell on the way to our table. I first mentioned this to the hostess  who replied  with a laugh  that because of her nonslip shoes  she wasn\'t affected by it. Then while waiting for our waiter I watched 3 other people catch themselves from slipping. I again said something to our waiter about how slippery the floor was  and instead of any kind of concern at all  got to again hear about their nonslip shoes! I was absolutely surprised at how little they seemed to care or realize that someone could hurt themselves. That annoyance aside  we ordered our desserts (a scoop of ice cream for me since it was one of only two options under 1000 calories). 45 minutes later  our waiter plopped our desserts on our table without even an acknowledgement of how long we had waited in the ""not busy enough to be excused"" setting. To be fair  our desserts were not bad but certainly not noteworthy in any way. We could\'ve gotten the same thing at Applebee\'s for less money and probably received slightly better service. We finished in all of 10 minutes  and then were subjected to his horribly rehearsed end line of how much he enjoyed ""spending time"" with us this evening. There was not one minute of our drawn out experience there that was either genuine or remarkable in any way. In the parking lot my fianc and I turned to each other and asked mercifully to please never make the other go back again."
Jennifer S.,Soulsbyville  CA,0,4,,8/16/2013,3.0,I'm giving the restaurant 3 stars on the food. It's not the best and its not the worst. I'm giving the service no stars. Both times I've been  the service was awful. So many different people bringing us our food. What is our server doing? I wouldn't know because both times they were MIA.
Jason L.,Windsor  CA,11,17,,9/25/2012,1.0,Service sucked. Food was average. Beer is nothing to get worked up about. Oh and the big one don't try to complain to management. They don't care and would prefer you to just leave. Well I vote with my dollars. I hope this place gets their butts kicked straight out of Sonoma County in place of some Mom and Pop places that care.
Jim M.,Portland  OR,0,9,,7/20/2013,2.0,We visited on a Saturday afternoon. The place was busy   but not filled with customers. The service was very slow  from receiving drinks it took 35 minutes to receive food orders of hamburgers and salads  and additional 10 minutes to receive an order of ribs. The hamburger and fries arrived cold and tasted salty and greasy. The salad was good  while other items just ok. Basically mediocre food and very slow service. Many other much better places to eat in Santa Rosa.  I could not recommend BJ s Restaurant.
Christina S.,Santa Rosa  CA,43,5,,3/23/2013,1.0,Unfortunately not a fan of this restaurant. The service was horrible  and the food wasn't anything to brag about. We had to wait 15 minutes for a table outside  which there were plenty of tables open. Our waitress only came over once to take our order  never once asked if we wanted refills on our drinks. My husbands burger had about a gallon of salt on it  my daughters chicken tenders weren't fully cooked  and my salmon had a weird smell  like its been frozen for a while and was cooked quickly. Would not recommend this place to anyone.
Ramon M.,Santa Rosa  CA,169,38,,5/11/2012,4.0,I think today was the first day this restaurant was open. It was really crowded and there was a line in the front of the door. We already had a reservation. The place is huge and there are huge TV monitors mounted in every direction  so you can catch news and sports from any table in the house. The staff is still under very heavy training so every table had 2 wait people instead of one. The Bussers were the best  refilling waters and lemonades before you had the chance to ask for refils. The service is very friendly and the the prices are not bad. Lemonade was 2.75 but you get unlimited refills. The beer selection looks great but I had to work so I did not even look at the drink menu. The food was fast and clean  but the waitres brought something different from what we ordered  since we had to go back to work we did not complained ( my friend ordered the cheeeseburger pizza and got a cheeseburguer $9.95) I ordered the veggie burguer($9.50) . The veggie patty was really tasty but it was too thin for my taste. The Bignette ($5.95) at the end was really delicious  served hot and full of vanilla flavor  topped with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream surrounded by fresh berries. I would go back just for that and coffe after the movies. People on the table next to ours had some great looking dishes that were not on our menu  so maybe I missed them   but I am willing to go back ( any takers?) to check those out. This place is going to be THE hub for sports fans  With more TVs than anywhere else in the 50 mile radius.
Michelle T.,Cloverdale  CA,0,48,,7/2/2013,1.0,Yikes! Hubby and I had to try this out one Saturday since we had heard it was a new place in town. We went at an OFF hour (2pm)  not lunch time and not yet dinner. The place was barely busy. LOTS of seating in this place. Food was pretty basic and mediocre. Service was horrible! We received menus from our waitress in somewhat of a timely fashion after being seated but...she never came back to take our order after telling us that she would be our server. We waited 20 minutes with menus CLOSED on the table meaning we were ready to order  right? She was very cute and attentive to the table with 4 patrons NEXT to us (two couples) but clearly couldn't handle a few tables at a time. Finally  we were ready to just walk out and I flagged down another waitress & complained about our waitress never taking our order. We will never go back there. Not worth it. Blah  boring food and really poor service. Wouldn't even give it a second try.
TJ M.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,2,,2/13/2013,1.0,Maybe if they had fewer items on the menu they might be able to get my order correct. Second time here  second fouled order  last time back!
Nicole M.,Petaluma  CA,80,19,3,8/27/2012,4.0,I am impressed! Stopped in for lunch this afternoon with my sister and 4 year old son. Inside was very loud  but extremely busy so it was to be expected. Luckily for us  we didn't have to wait very long for an outside table (8 minutes?). The weather was perfect and the outside tables were roomy and very comfortable. The patio was not over crowded and the tables were far enough apart that you didn't feel as if you were intruding on the table behind or in front of you. The hostess that seated us  Kelsey (sp?) was the sweetest and friendliest hostess I have ever met. Our server was great as well. I tried the white peach margarita and will definately go back to get another. The lunch specials were such a great deal and the servings were generous. Everything tasted nice and fresh. It was my first time dining at BJ's and I have to say  I'll definately be going back! Thank you for the awesome service!
Lynn P.,Hercules  CA,0,6,,10/28/2012,1.0,This is the third time I've been here since it opened  and unfortunately it's gotten progressively worse. We ordered appetizers for lunch which arrived about 45 minutes later only AFTER I complained to my waiter. Meanwhile my son's order was not yet ready (bread bowl) so we finished eating well before his order arrived. We were not given any plates  nor drink refills until we asked. We complained to the manager  and at the very least he comped our entire lunch. We received a 2nd flatbread pizza on the house which came out HOT  the way it should've been the first time. Which leads me to believe the waiter had our food sitting. BJs  please train your staff on basic customer service skills and a little more hustle!!!
Robert m.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,14,,3/30/2013,1.0,"This restaurant does not belong in California. I went there with 6 people last night. We all ordered different items. One out of the five was ""tolerable""  the taco. It is quite apparent that none of the food is actually prepared in house  it is apparently shipped in on a big truck and heated up to order. I had a pizza with mushrooms  garlic and Italian sausage. What a disaster. First of all it  the wait for the food was about a half an hour  I guess you are supposed to drink a lot during that time so the food tastes better. The hard liquor bar is their bread and butter. My pizza came out barely luke warm. I sent it back along with the pasta the person next to me had and waited another 10 minutes for it to be ""warmed up"". Both items came back a little warmer but still not hot. But even warm  the pizza was terrible  the crust was like cardboard and the favors were indistinguishable. Same goes for the shrimp pasta. There was no taste to it. The side salad I ordered was iceberg lettuce with a couple slivers of carrot served with what tasted like cheap bottled ""Italian"" dressing. The wine list was expensive and the service was okay. I will never go back there. I really can\'t understand why the place was packed except for the fact that they have a lot of televisions and people were watching the college basketball games.P.S. I forgot to mention. After we got our food  we had to ask the waitress for silverware and napkins."
Chelsea D.,Sebastopol  CA,0,23,33,8/29/2012,2.0,Came here with two friends for lunch. The outside seating was what made this bearable for me. It's very dark inside. I knew I wasn't going to like this place  too corporate for my liking. The service was pretty good  I'll give them that. However  I feel like their staff is missing warmth and sincerity. I wasn't too hungry  and knew I didn't want to spend a lot on mediocre food  so I ordered a couple appetizers. We split the avocado rolls. Not bad. It came with three split in half  for a total of 6 (sort of...) and a dipping sauce. I also ordered the mozzarella and tomato salad aka caprese. This was nothing like the simple Italian dish. There were only a couple pieces of tomato which didn't have any flavor  and didn't seem fresh. It was basically mozzarella pieces with some spices and sauce. My friend got a salad which looked weak and not very fresh  especially for how steep the price is. $12 for shredded lettuce? There are sooo many better restaurants in Santa Rosa which have GOOD food. This place it all about presentation. It's baffling how people will pay for bad food and enjoy it!
Mary E.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,2,,1/26/2013,2.0,I come here a lot and the food never fails to take forever to come out at this location. Service kinda sucks. I come for the desert
Heather D.,Santa Rosa  CA,5,27,2,4/6/2014,3.0,I'm not sure what some of the people are expecting when they come here  but in my opinion  this place is one step above chilis. It's a chain restaurant  so you can go to any of them and expect the same style of food. The food here isn't awesome  but it's not as bad as some of these people make it out to be. Just assume you're not getting gourmet food  and order a beer! Or some of their delicious non-alcoholic selection (free refills  which you'll rarely find at any other places) like cream soda or root beer. (This was great when I was pregnant) Some of the food I've had here has been great! The fried artichokes are quite yummy! But if you're seeing something that sounds fancy  don't expect too much. (Though I've had the pork chop and it was great!) But definitely good for inexpensive bar style food and great if you have kids  cause no one even notices them making noise when the whole restaurant is loud and crazy too! I come here for fun with friends! 3 stars for pretty good food  good value  and family friendly.
Stacy M.,Healdsburg  CA,2,13,,6/6/2012,2.0,Horrible to dine in...!! Ok @ bar area.. You wait a long time to get sat  put in your order and for your food to get to your table and when it gets to your table its cold and or something is wrong with your dish! They should have year experienced staff in the kitchen and serving from former BJ's restaurants!
John S.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,11,,12/3/2012,4.0,I enjoyed the food. It's not the cheapest  but the portions are large and satisfying. Our server was friendly and accommodating. No complaints from me  I will certainly be back. 4 stars  because while it was certainly not the best  it was still quite good.
James M.,Rohnert Park  CA,0,2,,11/13/2012,1.0,Waited 2 hours to be seated and was moved around a few times. Food took another hour and was undercooked. Some food came 20 minutes after the first group and the appetizers came last. 1 person got sick and others felt terrible.
Pete B.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,36,,6/30/2012,2.0,Not impressed. Reminded me of a place in las Vegas. Big fancy decor with colorful lights on walls. Only tried the pizza and didn't think it was any better than pizza hut pan pizza. Save your money and go to old Chicago pizza in Petaluma. Only positive was the dessert.
Doc Y.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,6,,10/14/2012,1.0,Got charged twice! $65.00 A month later????? Call manager he questioned me! Oh let me double check  I'll call you back. Been a week never heard from him! Going to dispute it.  Advise check your statements to make sure they don't steal from you!!!!!!!!!
Sophia L.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,49,,6/14/2012,3.0,I have eaten at the Terra Linda restaurant  and yesterday at Coddingtown. My cheeseburger was delicious  and I was able to substitute fries for a caesar salad - at no extra charge. At lunch time  the music was way too loud and I asked the manager to turn it down. She said she turned it down a little but corporate told the stores how loud to play it. Really? I can understand loud music in Friday and Saturday night  but lunch? On another note  the servers were very attentive.
Connie H.,Santa Rosa  CA,2,9,4,5/22/2012,4.0,We were a party of 9 last night...on a Monday night which ended up being a long night due to the wait  but I give that up to being a newly opened (one week) restaurant. They have a few kinks to work out but over all  the waitress (Linda) was great! I ordered the chicken chopped salad  my husband ordered the steak salad and others ordered various pizzas  steak  etc...we had it all it seemed. We ordered two of the appetizer combo  which was out of this world. LOVED it! We loved all the food...no complaints. My husband and his friends ordered the Hopstorm beer which they all loved!!! We loved sampling several different beers. Because of our wait being kind of chaotic the manager (Jeff) came over and apologized and went over and above what he needed to do to make it right with us. I love the fact that even being a new restaurant  he took the time and acknowledged where they had failed and made it right with us. Way to go  Jeff!!! We will be back.
Stephanie T.,Forestville  CA,0,16,,7/22/2012,4.0,Overall I was happy. My party and I are pretty picky about the places we eat and we both enjoyed our food and especially the beer (The Piranha pale ale!) We shared the fried artichoke hearts and each had a salad. Unfortunately our flatbread appetizer came after the salads but by then we were full so we took it to go. (By the way  it was tasty!) The service was also very good. I'll definitely be back.
Dean S.,Sebastopol  CA,0,7,,7/14/2012,2.0,Food was okay - but the place was much too noisy. Couldn't talk to friends across the table without yelling.
Ric N.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,14,,6/23/2012,1.0,Went there for dinner with my wife. ordered 2 pizzas and they were both cold. Sent them back and the next 2 were cold also. They told us that we could have a cookie desert for the trouble they put us through then never brought it to us.(we were there probably close to 2 1/2 hours total.) The waitress said the manager would comp us for the first 2 cold pizzas(which we had sent back) but still charged us for the next 2 cold pizzas.(so we got comped for nothing!!)The place was in choas and disorganized. They charge alot for some pretty poor food. I have to say there are alot of better places to spend your time and money for lunch or dinner in sonoma county. If you make a mistake you make it right with the customer or they don't return. We will not be returning to BJ's
Nick S.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,19,,8/14/2013,1.0,Party of four ordered calamari  avocado wraps  ribs  angus pot roast sandwich  California flat bread pizza and chicken pasta and side salad calamari tasted very fishy and was like chewing on chunks of tires   the avocado wraps were mealy salty and oily   ribs were dry and salty  pot roast was half cold half warm way too salty  pizza was burnt and dry and last of all the pasta was completely over cooked mush. The waitress was more concerned about waiting on and talking to what seemed to be her bf then actual paying customers. Wish I would of checked yelp first and not after coming here. Everything was pretty pricey including the 10 dollar drinks that were watery other then all that it was a clean and nice looking restraint won't be back especially after. Checking the reviews of the bjs 25 miles away in Novato. You will definitely feel more satisfied going to a local Denny's or jack in a box
Jackie I.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,1,,6/14/2012,1.0,Everything from start to finish was a disaster with a smile. Call ahead doesn't work  the clock started ticking when we walked in and we waited almost a half hour which means with the call ahead one hour for a table. Drinks were late for the meal and not how we ordered them. One entree came just as we began to eat our appetizers and was saved and reheated when it was time for all the entrees. Another entree didn't come at all and they had to be reminded of it. My steak was flavorless and tough. Drinks for the entree portion of the meal came when we were almost done. Water and ice tea were never refilled. One appetizer was wrong and we were to exasperated to even tell anyone at this point. If you don't care about this review  at least make sure you don't sit at the table next to outdoor seating because every time the door opens  which is a lot  the sun shine will blind you. The beer is good and the food is Denny's quality. To get any help at all we felt like we were on a phone tree of a corporate office  no one we talked to could really make a difference. The manager came over and apologized for the two entrees and compt them for us. Sorry  with everything else it felt like to little to late. Going out to dinner just isn't supposed to be this frustrating.
Scott D.,Santa Rosa  CA,0,1,,1/19/2013,1.0,"Checked in with hostess  got the little light-up thingie  sat down. After 20 minutes or so  we noticed that they had seated everyone but us including everybody who had come in after us. Went up and asked the hostess why  she seated another group and then explained that our \'ticket had been misplaced\'. She told a woman to seat us and we went with her. We asked her if she knew what had happened  she explained that they had not forgotten about us but that there had been \'some missed communication\' and that they ""would have gotten around to you eventually."" Comforting. We then were introduced to our (female) server  then a guy came over and told us he would be our server instead because he ""didn\'t have any tables"" and ""was bored"". We finally got to order and our food was not bad. Our drinks were actually very good. But nobody there even uttered the word ""sorry"" for having forgotten about us  much less offered a reasonable explanation as to why. They just did *not* care. The food and drinks were okay but the incompetence and complete indifference of the staff will prevent us from making a second visit."
Amber G.,Santa Rosa  CA,1,2,,6/8/2012,1.0,I have waited on tables before  so I am VERY understanding of sometimes slow service  and not everything going perfect when being out to eat. That said  going to BJ's in Santa Rosa was the WORST dining experience of my life. We waited way over the the time we were told. When we were seated we were still in good spirits. It took a while but a server made his way over and took our drink and appitizer order. At this point still good spirits. It took a good 20 minutes to get our 3 fountain drinks  and 15 more to get our appitizers. I asked for a straw for my drink and never got one. Our sever seemed to be very occupied with all h is other tables or not around. At one point he left another table's credit card slip at our table. After 40 minutes of more waiting for our meals  they finally arrived. Our sever skipped out on us and luckily left us with one who new what she was doing. Even then  the food was not great  and luke warm. During all our waiting we were unable to flag anyone to help us. At one point we asked an employee to check on our food  she said to ask our server......
