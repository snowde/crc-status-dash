Matthew S.,Baltimore  MD,205,113,97,11/1/2017,4.0,"Stopped in for lunch on Sunday and couldn\'t have asked for a more pleasant experience. The restaurant was clean  the staff (waitress  hostess  food runners) were friendly  and the food was amazing. Myself and four friends all left feeling very satiated and can\'t wait to return!I got the Enlightened Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos and WOW. Diced grilled chicken paired with a cucumber  tomato  red onion  and feta ""salsa"" which is them topped with cilantro and a creamy yogurt sauce. The pita they envelope it in is seriously heavenly. Warm and soft  just like you\'d expect it to be and more. Served alongside a huge serving of grain salad and just the right amount of both. Finished the whole entree and it left me feeling full without being overstuffed - perfecto. Friends all loved their entrees as well. Salads are large and filled with fresh  seasonal ingredients. The Parmesan Crusted chicken was bomb.com and the portion was larger than life. Literally enough for 2  even 3  meals. Side of brocolli that it comes with could have used some extra seasoning but the chicken and mashed potatoes more than made up for it\'s lack thereof.My only regret is not getting our waitresses name so I could drip it here. She was amazing. Claimed to have tried every item on the menu (which is huge so we were a bit skeptical) but proved herself right when she was able to quickly rattle off her personal likes and dislikes about all the items we were contemplating and then ranked them in order from best to worst. She was seriously amazing and will definitely be getting return service the next time we stop in!"
Kendra R.,Randallstown  MD,137,110,119,11/12/2017,3.0,I had a great time here. The service was great and the food LOOOKED good. I said looked because I ended up sending my barbacoa tacos back. They had a horrible stench to them. They looked great  but I couldn't stomach the smell. I'm excited to return to try some other food items because every picture on the menu made me want to try it.I didn't order another entre  I opted for dessert instead. I was thoroughly please with my white macadamia nut pikoozie. Absolutely delicious. Parking in Towson is always a pain especially if you're not wanting to use the garage. I lucked up and found a spot right out front. I look forward to returning here and trying something else.
Jude T.,Parkville  MD,67,386,372,9/19/2017,3.0,A solid three.This place is a chain restaurant  but it's a good chain restaurant - it's what Friday's could be and maybe is trying to be. However  it's STILL a chain restaurant  and that's important to remember. BJ's has a good beer list  including their own  which is the real center of attention  I guess. Their actual menu is quite bloated and far too large  much like a lot of other chains (looking at you  CCF  especially). You have options here  but because there are so many things it means some of the things aren't going to be as great as the others - no restaurant staff can learn all of these items and prepare them perfectly each time. They have flatbread pizzas  burgers  tacos  ribs  sandwiches  wraps  salads  fish...far too many options.As for what we had? Two people ordered burgers  both MW. One was a bit dry with one side closer to well-done and a little black  but the other burger was perfect MW.The flatbread pizza appetizer was actually pretty good - I liked the sauce a lot. I had the fish and chips  and the fish was cooked well with a nice breading but maybe a little greasier than expected or wanted. All meals came with fries and the fries were actually good restaurant fries!Waitress was very nice and came back with an extra drink when I asked for a refill  so that's cool. OTOH we didn't even get a person to ask us for drinks until we had been there for about 10 minutes  so service can be slow.In the end  the food can be good  but some things are better than others...and it's a brewhouse that's trying to be a sports bar (tons of TVs and the clientele is definitely sports fans on a Sunday) and because of this  it fails to live up to its true potential.
Tiffany D.,Baltimore  MD,123,93,182,11/29/2017,3.0,I came here to have dinner before my movie. My overall experience was great  but the food items were mediocre. The server was very nice and personable and truly made our entire experience. On another note  some of the restaurant practices were blah. They call themselves a brew house but didn't offer tastings of their wine or beers. So I ended up going safe instead of trying something new. Next  I ordered from their $10 menu  and it was to be expected that it wouldn't be much to write home about. I was satisfied with my meal  but my girlfriend didnt care for hers. At the end  I got dessert and that was really good and on discount. Bottomline- I would go back again for dessert and half priced wine.... and maybe even to try a signature item before I completely write them off.
Toy S.,Owings Mills  MD,75,85,97,6/21/2017,4.0,BJ's is good for what is  a cool place to eat wings and watch the game. Whenever I have free time after going to Cinemark theater  I always walk out of the theater and to BJ's. Their selection of personalized beer is tasty (TATONKA is my favorite) and I love  love  love their homemade pizza. The sauce is always just right. What annoys me with BJ's  and is the reason I can't give them five stars is because no matter when I come I have to ask someone to wipe off the bar or the table before I sit down. And I mean every time!!! I don't know what goes down at night but there is always so much food gook on it and the morning crew must be like FORGET IT! But the staff members are always nice when asked. The service in general is a guessing game. If I sit at the bar it's pretty good. It doesn't hurt that the hour I go it's desolate  just the way I like it. Still  during football and basketball season they get crazy busy  in a good way! Be prepared if you like cheering with other fans.
Bethany A.,Tampa  FL,12,23,,11/9/2017,1.0,Would give zero stars if I could. Worst dinner I have had in months. HORRIBLE SERVICE. Waited over 10 mins to be greeted and to order drinks. 2 Appetizers (one that was RAW) took 45 mins. Dinner then came while we were eating the apps. Never checked on us. Food was mediocre at best. We asked for the check and it took ANOTHER 15 mins while we watched the staff standing around in the kitchen. The staff was actually arguing with eachother in front of us. Hostess looked to be in tears at one point. It was so bad but there was no manager in sight so we just paid the bill and left. So many restaurants nearby - don't make the same mistake as us - eat somewhere else!!
Jamie F.,Baltimore  MD,9,56,91,9/17/2017,3.0,Went for Happy hour.. it was okay  didnt have much of a selection. The bartender was a nice lady who made me a really nice drink. The root beer glazed ribs was soooooo good!!! Thats the only thing I would go back for.
Wayne B.,Crofton  MD,0,5,2,11/10/2017,1.0,They refused to seat a walk in party of four until after 9:00 at 5:45 PM. There were about a dozen empty tables  so...
Cynthia F.,Lutherville-Timonium  MD,123,183,452,6/10/2017,3.0,Came to BJ's last night for dinner before we went to a movie at the theater. We caught the last 15 minutes of happy hour. They brew their own beer  so BF and I decided to try some of their brews. I got the Jeremiah Red which is a red ale  and BF got a mango IPA. I wasn't a big fan of my beer  but i thought his mango IPA was pretty good.We started with the stuffed mushrooms. They were pretty good and I loved the pesto drizzle. BF got a guacamole bacon burger and I got a mini deep dish pizza. The deep dish pizza's were half off during happy hour. BF really liked his burger  and I was a fan of the fries that he got with them. My pizza was SO greasy. The pizza itself tasted good but the crust was just a sponge of grease. I am the type of person who feels like I always have to finish the food in front of me so I finished it anyway. All during the movie I had a stomach ache which I think was caused by how greasy the pizza was. I would still return  but if I ordered a deep dish pizza I would make sure it wasn't as greasy  or just try something different on the menu.
Annette B.,Baltimore  MD,0,38,,10/27/2017,3.0,Upon arriving to this restaurant on the evening of October 26th  there was a red haired hostess that didn't wait on me and my guest. She saw us and acted as though she didn't. This was not only rude  but unprofessionally. Something should be done about this. Then a male host with salt and pepper hair came and told us he would seat us in a minute. Once we were seated  Shay did everything possible to make sure we were completely happy and satisfied. She went over and beyond to continually checked on us and asked if there was more she could do for us. Her service was terrific and the food was just as we ordered it.
Candace F.,Atlanta  GA,7,90,3,5/21/2017,3.0,Came a few weeks ago with a friend at the end of lunch time and had a pleasant experience. Their asparagus is seasoned well... which is the whole point of this review because so many places act like veggies don't need seasoning! You're probably not coming to this place for asparagus but I had to attempt to have something healthy on my plate so don't judge me ok?!I don't drink beer but did notice they have quite a variety available!
Emilie J.,Towson  MD,11,90,43,3/4/2017,4.0,I am aaaall about the Ahi Poke dish. I get it everytime I'm here. I've also enjoyed the Peruvian Salmon Quinoa Bowl which I would like even better without the tomatoes in it. I ordered the ribeye last time I came. It was a bit under done (I ordered medium rare and it was more on the rare side) which made it too chewy. I should have sent it back to get put back on the fire  but I was satisfied with my food overall. Download their app for deals AND pay for your meal without any hassles or waiting especially if it's a busy night and you're eating at the bar.
Kitty L.,Baltimore  MD,3,18,28,12/26/2016,2.0,So  the day after Christmas  hubby and I decided to eat here because our planned one o'clock movie was sold out. First time here and definitely will be the last! The host seated customers as well as waited tables. The table had bread crumbs. Our waiter promptly arrived at our table in 10 minutes to introduce himself & take our beverage orders. I ordered simple calamari and hubby a platter. Well the calamari was over cooked  bland and greasy.
Kayisha E.,Baltimore  MD,0,24,5,7/26/2017,3.0,I've been here three times. The ambiance is nice and the staff is pleasant. My first experience was with my boys to get a pizookie  which is really good. I returned by myself to fix a chocolate craving and ordered the chocolate chunk pizookie again. The third time included food. I purchased a deep dish pizza  which after traveling to Chicago is one of my favorite styles of pizza. What we received was lackluster. It seemed we would have been better off purchasing a Hot N Ready for $5. Overall  this is a cool place to hang out  especially if you want to watch sports.
Vicki K.,Towson  MD,2,57,,6/9/2017,5.0,We had the soup in sour dough bread bowls. The bread bowls were grilled to perfection. The soup was delicious. The only complaint was there wasn't a lot of soup. Our server was great. We will come back again and try some other foods. We had a small Pizzokki. It was an awesome dessert.
Michelle Y.,Towson  MD,287,35,61,7/23/2017,3.0,I would say Bj's is your average sports bar type place with a nicer interior. I've been to this location twice and both times were just okay. Nothing super special  but nothing terrible either. Second time I went  my knife was covered in a layer of grime and the kitchen forgot my egg on my chicken steak fried sandwich. Service was great  food was alright.
Scott F.,Towson  MD,0,5,,9/1/2017,1.0,Not sure what is worse  the food or the service. My wife and I went for a quick dinner. Ordered chips and queso but got chips and guac. When we pointed this out our server apologized and said she would get the queso right out. 30 minutes (YES thirty minutes) later and after numerous requests which she blamed on the kitchen  the manager brought out our queso. She told us there would be no charge  but still charged us for the chips and guac that we didnt order bit she said to just go ahead and eat. Salad served with wrong dressing. Fish tacos tasted like they had a vat of salt in them  inedible. Pork chop tough and no taste.Avoid this place...horrible.
Jan-Nathan B.,Perry Hall  MD,193,1,,8/16/2017,1.0,"Came here today with 6 others to celebrate a birthday. Sat there for 10 minutes without being addressed by anyone but the hostess that seated us and a server who gave us napkin coasters and said ""hi my name is ____ but I am NOT your server."" We didn\'t even get the chance to order water. The worst part is there were servers around us just dilly-dallying. It was a horrible time and it\'s not the first time it had happened! I never make reviews. But this place was so bad that I just had to make one. Never coming back.We went to On the Border across the street and our server  food  and drinks were awesome!"
Mel L.,Pikesville  MD,151,42,183,10/2/2016,3.0,I visited BJs for the first time on Friday 9/30. My friend recommended we go to get the pizookies. I will say they were pretty darn good and very filling  but unfortunately that's where the good part of this review ends.We were taken to a nice booth immediately. However  we were not greeted or given drinks for at least 10 minutes. Additionally  we were never given napkins for the messy dessert and the spoons we received were dirty. They never brought out our french fries and I had to call our waitress over to ask about the status of the fries. She never came over to check on us probably because we were only a group of two which I guess makes us not as important. She was not very friendly and did not take much interest in my food allergy. If I'm being honest I will probably go back just because the food is really good. If the service had been better  I would have given this 5 stars.
Sherie A.,Springfield  VA,18,14,15,3/12/2017,1.0,We came on a Sunday before our movie. 30 mins later we are still waiting for our food. Waitress no where to be found to ask about our order.
Liz J.,Baltimore  MD,86,325,8,3/20/2017,3.0,Came after a movie for drinks  and it was a good place to go. Clean  plenty of room  and they serve food pretty late. Decent beer as well.
Jay S.,Baltimore  MD,0,14,,4/16/2017,2.0,"BJ\'s is not a place I would typically visit BUT we met a group of family and friends that wanted a local corporate restaurant.Briefly  here were my issues during our last visit:- While we had a somewhat large party (7 adults)  our wait was one hour and 15 minutes. There were two 12 tops that remained empty the entire time we waited AND the entire time we ate our meal (as we left  they finally split one of the 12 tops for two families). The staff easily could have split one of the twelve tops (they obviously weren\'t holding it for a reservation or a walk up group).- My meal came with no sauce even though the menu listed a sauce...it was so dry and flavorless.- My meal was listed as ""spicy"" but there was no spice...nor any flavor...again  zero flavor.That said  it wasn\'t all bad...- The menu has lots of interesting items (but since there is no flavor to their food  it doesn\'t matter if there are 500 items on the menu).- Our waiter was fantastic  so maybe their focus is customer service instead of focusing on quality of the food.People who prefer corporate dining over local restaurants  places that are the same in Topeka as they are in Wilmington  will love this BJ\'s. We won\'t be going back  though...not our style and the food has zero taste."
Nikia H.,Parkville  MD,51,4,3,8/22/2016,4.0,This is my second time here and again I was really impressed with the food. The menu is so plentiful and there is a lot to choose from. My first experience was great food wise but the service was not so good. But tonight for a nice family dinner I was impressed with the service and patience the waitress showed (we have a 6 year old and 20 month old) she was helpful and cheerful and checked on us frequently.So  my overall review is a favorable one and I could totally see my family and I having some great times here!
Lynna O.,Damascus  MD,0,6,9,8/1/2016,2.0,"Not such a great experience at all. Not what I was expecting at all.Defiantly not a DEEP dish. More like a fat hand tossed pizza crust. Pizza Hut tastes better... Let me explain. I would just 1st like to start by mentioning that BJs offers "" curbside delivery "" when you are placing a carry out order. I placed my order around 8:30pm. I was told it would be about 15-20min for my delivery. When I called and requested the curbside  no one asked for a number to reach me on  no one asked for what make and model I would be in and no one mentioned where to park for this "" curbside "" that is offered. I ordered a medium size pepperoni and cheese CHICAGO deep dish pizza. I called BJs back to let them know I was in the front of the restaurant parked in a valet spot  because there are no designated "" curbside "" delivery spots. When I called again  no one asked what car I would be in  I had to mention it. Around 9pm I got irritated and walked in and asked for my pizza. It was just sitting the heated area where pizzas are dropped off. I payed my bill  walked to car and checked the pizza ( they did not open the box to check the pizza). I noticed it was a chicken and bbq pizza... Not what I ordered. So I walked back in and ask to speak with the manager because I was simply irritated at this point. He had offered to give me a Large pepp and cheese pizza that was already in the over and remove my charge for the incorrect pizza. I said okay and asked about the curbside the restaurant offered. He only said that he would walk it out. Didn\'t really answer anything about curbside for me at all. 15more min later and after everything I got my pizza around 9:30... Not cool. Got home and tried eating the pizza  but it was way too doughy... It looked done on the outside but the cooked part of the pizza peeled right off and there was the base of the pizza... Doughy. There were some kind of bruschetta tomatoes on top? Design I guess? But they were all Over the pizza. No where on the menu did it mention that. I\'ll say that it might have been that they were in a rush to give me a pizza because of the error that occurred previously  but at least have some sort of pride in what you give to your customers. The pics online looks like BJs has amazing food. I was excited to try it but super let down even after the manager tried to fix it. Terrible. Don\'t know if It\'s worth going back. The only good thing out of this was that this terrible pizza that was not eaten was free. 2 stars for BJs. Customer service was horrible  the manager tried to fix this error  but this could of all been prevented if management had a process in place for carry out food."
Eric C.,Baltimore  MD,3,33,16,9/6/2017,3.0,I went in this past Saturday night with my friends and sat at one of the tables at the bar. We didn't order much food  just the chips and dip and the calamari. I tried their house porter and the stout on the draft. Beer came out nice and cold and the bar food was okay but nothing of spectacular. The service could've been better  I saw the server sitting around with her friends while we were waiting to order more drinks.
Keejoo L.,Alexandria  VA,169,532,130,2/23/2016,3.0,Third time to this location now. This one is fairly new  it's in the shopping centre with the cinemark across from the Towson mall. Upon walking in the two hosts seemed a little clueless  they did multiple double takes at each other before picking up some menus and taking our small party of two to a table close to the bar.We had two waitresses for some reason  one that got drinks and another that was very aloof that admitted to us she was in her own world in her head. Had to flag her down to order  get sauce  check... Me and my friend came in Tuesday which is apparently half price wine glass and bottle night . I approve of that! For dinner I decided to be a little bland and ordered the chicken club  my friend got a jalapeo burger. Both came out very timely and hot. I love these kind of shoe string fries  crispy yet flavorful. Chicken could of been seasoned a bit more and the bread ended up a little soggy but overall ingredients were fresh and well cooked. Great place to stop in for dinner pre movie. Only tip is for service to improve a bit  both at the front of the restaurant when you walk in as well as the servers at table side. Both parties seemed a little spaced out even though it was quite busy for a Tuesday night .
Ann K.,Baltimore  MD,35,34,15,3/18/2017,3.0,We are really torn about this place. We have always enjoyed the food and beer  but the service... So the kitchen seems to be the main culprit. We've been during very busy times  but also at lunch when the restaurant is only half full and it tends to be slow. The servers are usually good  although once or twice that's also been part of the problem.  We continue to go because the food is always good  the FOOD IS ALWAYS GOOD  and it's convenient when going to movies. But no one wants to have to rush out to make it to a show  or be late  when you leave ample time to make it.  So our mixed feelings continue. I wish they would just make it easy on us... quicker service and a well trained staff  or the food wasn't so darn good.
Malissa V.,Milford Mill  MD,29,3,3,5/4/2017,4.0,This was my first one here. The food was very tasty and reasonably priced. I ordered the homemade guacamole and chips as my appetizer  the New Orleans Jambalaya as my entree and to finish the night I ordered a single scoop of Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Chip ice cream. Everything was delicious and well prepared. Service started off a little rocky in the beginning. But the night ended well. I'll definitely comeback again.
Misty J.,Baltimore  MD,12,31,35,3/6/2017,5.0,I'm giving this place 5 star for two things and two things only: their berry burst cider which is their own beer brew but looks and tastes more like a wine cooler and their AMAZING . . . MONKEY BREAD PIZOOKIE'S!!!!!!!! Anyone from BJ's reading this  don't EVER get rid of this thing! Seriously  don't do it! Ugghhhh warm cinnamon and brown sugar monkey bread and I only get 1 scoop of ice cream and not the two it comes with! BEST THING EVER!!! I've even caught myself wanting to go there just for dessert. Some of their entrees are good like the chicken piadina or their bacon cheeseburgers but they're pretty standard. I get my piadina with BBQ instead of ranch and no tomatoes! Service is either good or outstanding  depending on your server! Deep dish pizzas aren't the best! I'm also from the north so my standards of pizza are prettttyyyyyyyyy freaking high!!! Only other downside is the parking! And with everything else in such a close vicinity  parking can be a nightmare! My husband and I have managed to find some street parking that's always free after 6 and always open  after visiting so many times! Seriously  thank me later for the monkey bread pizooki! Deeelisshhhhhh!!!!
Connor S.,Palm Springs  CA,1,55,5,12/5/2016,1.0,I have been to BJ'S many times in southern CA  so I am familiar with the food and beer. I have always had a great experience and returned again and again.This time however  I had a most horrible experience. Without droning on too long  I will say that our server was completely useless. She was more interested in sitting at a table behind us to get on her phone and text. That being said  she was unhelpful  inattentive  our (not great)food was not hot  our water was never refreshed and we had no opportunity to order more drinks! All bad stuff. I would gladly pass along her name  buy she never told us when we sat down.That being said  the experience will make me think twice about returning. With so many other options out there...why would I bother going back? I say  pass on BJ's... there is much better out there!
Kim B.,Baltimore  MD,273,140,323,1/6/2017,5.0,"While visiting with my son and his family around the holidays he mentioned how much he liked BJ\'s so when I saw they had a ""B1G1 Free"" Entree hubby and I decided to treat our son to dinner. We arrived at the restaurant around 5:00 and the place was still pretty empty which was fine with me. We were seated at a table in the bar area and were immediately greeted by Ashley who explained the specials and took our drink orders. For appetizers we went with the Calamari and Chicken Lettuce Wraps and both were quite delicious. I\'ve had Lettuce Wraps at several restaurants and BJ\'s take on one of my favorites was quite original - the chicken was mixed with spices  veggies  water chestnuts and topped with Wonton Strips and served with a Sesame Soy Sauce and a Spicy Mustard (trust me when I say make sure you have a full glass of water nearby if you have a tender tongue. I love spicy things but my tongue was burning for a few moments). We totally lucked out coming on a Thursday night - my son and I were in the mood for ribs and as luck would have it Thursdays is Rib Night and you cannot beat the deal they have. For $18.95 you get a Whole Rack of Ribs  Salad  2 Sides and a Pizookie for dessert. Both the House and Caesar Salads were fresh and flavorful and each was enough for 2 people. The ribs were tender and I really loved the flavor that the dry rub topped with a sweet heat bbq sauce and unlike a lot of restaurants  they don\'t upcharge for premium sides - I went with the Roasted Asparagus and Shoestring Fries. The fries were hot and crispy  salted to perfection and didn\'t even need ketchup (which says a lot for this admitted condiment-aholic) and the Asparagus were Crispy on the outside yet tender on the inside and tasted like they had been dusted with Parmesan Cheese and I couldn\'t get over how large the portions were  I actually brought home half of my entire dinner. Hubby got the Sirloin (also with the fries and asparagus as sides) and he said it was quite tasty but not the best he\'s ever had  he said he\'d give it a B-. We\'ve never been the type of people who save room for dessert (we usually can\'t even finish our entire meals) but since the Pizookies were included in the Rib Special we made an exception and left a little wiggle room. I chose the Monkey Bread and my son chose the Salted Caramel Pizookie  both were topped with 2 Scoops of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream (and my sons was drizzled with caramel and mini chocolate chips). The Pizookies come out warm  right out of the oven and talk about a decadent treat. Our entire bill for 3 meals  2 appetizers and 3 drinks came to about $66 before the tip which is an awesome deal plus they have a Premier Diner\'s Club where you earn a point for every dollar spent (there\'s also an app where you can keep track) and you can save to redeem for money off  free items  etc. Parking is validated in the garage attached to the movie theater so it only costs $2 and it sure beats looking for a parking space in the Towson area. We will definitely be back  I\'m looking forward to checking out the lunch specials  the Chicken Fajita Soup in particular."
Melanie F.,Towson  MD,20,1,1,5/4/2017,4.0,I've been here a few times and the food and drinks are always good. This time  I ordered the Honey Sriracha Brussels Sprouts. They were pretty tasty and not what you would normally think of Brussels sprouts. I ordered the Cherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon and it didn't disappoint either. And the 2 strawberry mojitos I had were perfect. Tonight  however  the service was a little lacking. Maybe because it was rather busy for a Thursday. Still  overall  it's a good place to go for food  drinks and conversation.
Tom S.,Bel Air  MD,1,16,21,3/19/2017,4.0,The wife and I tried to call ahead but their call ahead seating is a little unusual. We wound up just walking in close to 5 PM on a Saturday evening and got a table immediately. The hostess was very nice and explained a couple things on the menu before turning it over to our waitress. Loreal was our waitress. She seemed nice and knew what she was doing. I ordered the Ahi Poke as an appetizer. Someone from the kitchen brought that before we received our drinks or silverware. We thought we would try the beer sampler which provided four beers of your choosing in sampler glasses. Those were perfect and they even label the beer in front of each glass. For dinner the wife ordered the Seared Ahi salad and I chose the Mediterranean chicken pita tacos. For the appetizer and entre the tuna was excellent. I greatly enjoyed the chicken tacos and the dressing that was added on the side was a perfect combination. I noticed that I could download an app for my phone under this restaurant and after doing so  discovered a $10 off coupon that I could immediately use for this meal.The food and atmosphere was excellent. The desserts look great but we had no room left after eating the meal.
Alana B.,Towson  MD,0,13,,6/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,"BJ\'s was my favorite spot for lunch during my lunch hour at work. They offered curbside pick up and lunch specials all done online. BJs curbside lunch was my routine every few weeks. It was speedy. The host was very nice and met me at my card with food. My visit today reminded me of how cumbersome my last visit here was and I wish I would\'ve remembered before I placed my order. Now when you arrive curbside and call the curbside number they tell you ""you gonna have to come to the bar To get your order"" . (This happened last time too) This review is more so to speak on the staffing . There are two hosts at the front. A runner that brings to go orders to the bar (not sure if they\'re a waitress too) . The bartender is left to take to go orders  cash them out  serve drinks at the bar and tend to food orders as well. The bartender has a heavy load to carry   yet is the most pleasant of the employees out of all of the other employees that are far from busy while the bartender takes on everything. The bartender asked the runner if she could bag my order that the runner brought out while the bartender was making a drink. The runner rolled her eyes and ignored the bartender and walked back to kitchen . The food was good as always. But the staffing during lunch can use improvement. As a customer it feels like everyone else is sitting around not offering help and everything is on the bartender . It\'s upsetting to be offered curbside when it truly no longer exists at least during the week."
Jill B.,Baltimore  MD,245,146,289,6/30/2015,5.0,This place is amazing!!! I live and work in the area and there is so much amazing about this place. I am thrilled its open. 1st thing - do this now - RIGHT NOW - go to their website and join the premier club. It takes 24 hours to go into effect  and you want to make sure you get your points! I will elaborate later on the quality and consistency of the service (AMAZING)  the quality and flavors of the food (also AMAZING)  and atmosphere (PERFECT). You would not believe this was a chain if it weren't for all the technological awesomeness they have thrown in through their website and app. Group orders  where you can pay separately  that you can place before you go for carry out OR DINE IN!!!! Are you frickin kidding? this is the solution to short lunch breaks! having your lunch waiting for you when you arrive saves at least 10 minutes. Now the service was amazing  but that was because we had Shea as our server. I don't know if everyone that works there is as wonderful  but if you get Shea you're in for a great experience. I'm still dreaming about the possibility of one day getting one of the ridiculous desserts. And our lunch trio has expanded to at least 6 next time just from our rave reviews at work!
Shanay B.,Owings Mills  MD,95,148,25,3/26/2016,4.0,On this beautiful Saturday  I dined with my auntie at BJ's before we headed to the movie theater.She had fish and chips and I had a wrap with fries. Our waitress was on point   she made sure we were good  got us our drinks and just insight on the food..I would dine here again!!
Jeffrey A.,Baltimore  MD,11,24,,7/3/2017,4.0,This is our 2nd time going here (it's a relatively new Restaurant here). Overall  it's a very good Restaurant. They have a large Menu; lots of choices. IMHO  this place has the best Clam Chowder anywhere. Also  very good service. (Ashley was a very good Waitress). I'm not really a drinker  but they have tons of liquor  wine  etc. Parking here is very unpredictable. Its hit or miss. We will be back. They also have a special for lunch (11- 3 Mon- Fri). Unlimited soup & salads; $10.00.
Teresa F.,Encinitas  CA,874,238,115,10/18/2016,3.0,"Not consistently  super fresh ingredients  but an array of dishes. Definitely a sports bar. Decadent Pa-Zookie dessert is a treat  warm cookie with ice cream. Salted caramel  yum! Friendly and patient staff with a foodie. Alas  I\'ve tried several dishes here  and was repeatedly disappointed. Next I\'ll have to try their ""enlightened entree"" options  like salmon and quinoa  but I don\'t like farm-raised fish. Fortunately  they have a few ""enlightened"" salads which are pretty good. Best considered for those who like blaring sports  pizza  beer  and burgers."
Sarah P.,Middle River  MD,111,4,,9/3/2016,1.0,"This was probably the worst dining experience I have ever had in Towson. There are many decent local places to choose from in this area  and I really wish we would have opted for one of those. My husband and I came in to watch college football and have dinner. We sat at the bar right in front of the game we wanted to see. I ordered the queso with chips  and the Twisted BLT salad. My husband ordered a full rack of ribs and mashed potatoes. Oh where to begin? The queso came out lukewarm and the chips were extremely stale. I asked them to reheat it since it was like eating coagulated velveeta. My salad came out drenched in dressing. I don\'t know if the spinach was going bad and they were trying to cover it up  or if the half cup of dressing wilted the spinach. There was also no bacon on the salad. Nice BLT with no B!My hubby\'s mashed potatoes tasted like potato gum. Instant  I guess. Gross. The ribs were the worst we have ever had. They had the consistency of overcooked chicken; dense and chewy with the flavor of a McRib.Also  the game we were clearly watching was turned off twice (channel change)  which was remedied both times...once  ok. But twice? Weird!Beyond the terrible food was the service. Both bartenders were pleasant but not proactive at all. They never came back after the food was delivered so I didn\'t get a chance to tell them how bad everything was. When we told her we wanted to pay the check she then asked  ""Do you want boxes to take this home?"" I told her  ""No  that was pretty much the worst food I ever had."" Her reply was  ""Oh! I could have gotten you something else!"" Well yeah  I guess if you had checked on us that would have been an option. She then removed just one plate of the disastrous food we left behind  instead of getting it out of my sight. It also clearly did not occur to her to be proactive enough to have a manager come talk to us. After she returned our credit card and we sat to finish our drinks for about another 20 mins  we never saw her again.Really unacceptable for a chain  although I should know better than to eat at a chain!"
Paul S.,Towson  MD,83,155,66,6/28/2015,5.0,This place has it all. A really big menu so everyone can find something for them. The items are huge servings and have big flavor  you are garenteed to be well fed for the amount of money you put out. A lot of premium beers for the beer connoisseur as well as lots of great tasting mocktails and sodas straight from the tap. So even the non drinker can have a fun drinking experience. I'm a non drinker and want to try every soda and mocktail on the menu. You will love the orange cream soda  its like drinking a slightly carbonated creamsicle..Great atmosphere  very spacious and a clear view into the kitchen. -Super friendly wait staff and management  even the most simple of mistakes will be corrected with kindness right away. Never have to wait on additional requests  food delivery time to the table or drink refills. Even pay your check on their app to really cut down the wait time. I've been here twice now  very little if anything to complain about  they are so kind and welcoming. The place is great for friends to hang out at and enjoy good food at drinks. This is like a Fridays  but on a much higher level of quality. They have everything from sandwiches  steaks  tacos  pizza  etc. etc. Everyone will find something to eat. I love how they use matchstick fries  something unique to bring to the table because I never see them anymore. As a kid I loved having a pile of matchstick fries with my burger so it was like my inner child smiled. I plan on being a regular here  trying as much of the menu as possible. If you plan on being a regular too  download their app for advanced seating  to go orders  bill pay  and reward points for coupons and free food. Each point is equal to one dollar spent. I think many chain restaurants could learn a thing or two from the way BJs does things. A+ on all fronts!
Caitlin C.,Perry Hall  MD,2,18,4,1/24/2017,3.0,Service is quick  good pizza  friendly staff. Tons of beers on tap and a large diverse menu. Prices are a bit high but the portions are good. Big screen TVs throughout the restaurant to watch any sports event that is on
Christina O.,Baltimore  MD,208,144,1289,1/7/2016,5.0,Wow this place is amazing ^_^My bestfriend and I came here for a late lunch which turned into a happy hour ^_^. The interior is very nice and modern  I love the bar  they have huge TV's which that has different channels on all. The bartender was amazing  I forgot her name but she was an older white woman. She recommended the Strawberry Patch and it was really good  when I say good I mean really good. It hit the spot! We also ordered two Twisted BLT salads with mini pizzas  I had the buffalo chicken mini pizza and she had some type of meat pizza. The salad was very good  I should have requested no blue cheese crumbles since I'm not a huge fan of them. The buffalo pizza was okay  but it looked amazing. I would recommend putting more buffalo sauce on the pizza  I hardly taste any actually. My bestfriend meat pizza was good. Overall I would definitely recommend this place. It can get pricey especially with the drinks. Happy hour is a $1 of cocktails  our drink would have been $9 but it was $8.
Ashton M.,Towson  MD,60,51,28,6/12/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,This place has become a go-to for our family on a Friday or Saturday. It's always busy but never a long wait. There's a huge selection from salads to pasta  pizza  and burgers to satisfy all tastes. The service is always fast and friendly. We use the rewards card  which I never do  and it's worth it. There are lots of TVs showing sports  which is everywhere now  but it's not obtrusive. The burger with fried jalapeos is awesome  the fried jalapeos should be an appetizer. The calamari is really good. One negative  the queso with the chips is so hit or miss. When it's good it's the best but sometimes it's like to bottom of the barrel and barely edible  about 50% of the time  and never enough chips. It seems like an easy thing to fix. Other than that  and it's minor  BJ's remains fantastic and never disappoints.
Ali W.,Thousand Oaks  CA,215,12,2,4/21/2017,1.0,Good food but the worst service on the planet. Average time spent here for 2 people is 2 hours and that is when the place isn't even full. They advertise an app where you can get rewards but don't have the intelligence to be able to take the money off that the rewards have made you. They told us it was going to be a 30 min wait and then texted us that are table was ready 2 minutes later. This place seriously needs to get it together. Every time I come I look through the window that they have next to the tables and all the waiters and cooks are just gathered in a circle talking. Don't know why it's so expensive when the service is so terrible.
Carlos G.,Streamwood  IL,0,14,4,4/18/2017,5.0,Im in town every week from Chicago and this is one of my favorite spots. Great appetizers and great tasting meals. Flatbread pizza (with extra sauce) was delicious! Huge beer selection!
Neal A.,Baltimore  MD,153,77,220,1/25/2016,4.0,BJ's has always been a personal favorite for a quickly thrown together happy hour  a late night drink  or a business luncheon. Well  after I left the West coast I though for sure I'd seen my last BJ's for awhile. Low a behold! Here I find myself in Towson enjoying a delicious Tatonka Stout and digging into one of my favorite Mediterranean pizza. The staff here was entertaining  polite  and attentive despite being swapped with patrons. The food as always was delicious and I had the opportunity to taste the Grilled Chicken Taco from the healthier menus which was surprisingly filling and super flavorful.
Lori N.,Pasadena  MD,24,19,9,3/18/2017,5.0,Quick pick for lunch. Had a great selection and the food was awesome. I had the lettuce wraps and the Santa Fe salad. I will definitely return.
Steve S.,Parsippany  NJ,558,1171,285,10/16/2015,4.0,"Oh BJ\'s...thank you for a great meal. My daughter and I were at Towson University for a field hockey clinic about a week ago and we didn\'t get to the restaurant until pretty late-around 10pm. Thankfully they were still hopping and our waitress  Loreal C  was in a great mood. Neither of us had eaten at a BJ\'s before so we blew some questions by our server and her suggestions were on-point! We were very hungry and very thirsty...and had a long drive home ahead of us. I ordered a Pepsi (I never order soda)  a pumpkin ale  and a water and my daughter had the lemonade...fluid intake had been minimal so this was a nice way to get things going. Drinks arrived and we ordered fish and chips and Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger. Loreal C gave it a HIGH recommendation!The food came quickly and we jumped on some fries - they serve very skinny  well done fries which we thought were great - similar to Smashburger fries...probably previously frozen but delicious nonetheless (that was for Adam D who sees frozen fries as a dealbreaker). My daughter LOVED her fish...yes  it\'s just fried fish  but it wasn\'t too greasy and was very flavorful. My burger was done just as I requested (medium) and the brisket and bacon topping was a home run. Since neither of us had eaten a real dinner  we also ordered dessert...a Pizzookie Trio. If you\'ve never had a Pizzookie  it\'s a 3""=4"" cookie served HOT in a small metal ramekin-like dish and topped with ice cream...UMMMMMMMMMM  OK!!!!!!  We had the Chocolate Chunk  White Chocolate Macadamia  and the Triple Chocolate made with Ghirardelli Chocolate. First off  when you order the trio you should actually have three people as ONE Pizzookie and ice cream is enough for one person...However  full disclosure-I don\'t like leaving delicious food on the table so I toughed it out. I was really pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed our meal. I like being able to spend time with the kids eating out like this as I know it will be short lived as they will be off to college sooner than I know. I could EASILY return to BJs for another meal!"
David M.,Baltimore  MD,14,25,1,7/16/2017,2.0,This place is the definition of mediocre corporate dining. A huge menu of diverse items to ensure they don't do anything good. Loud  busy  and always a weeded server.
Kate Y.,Harrisburg  PA,14,64,22,6/18/2016,3.0,I had an amazing ahi tuna salad at this place when I came for lunch while shopping nearby. It was fresh and HUGE. Service was attentive and prompt. The pizza would have been better had it been left in the oven longer. It was a pan pizza but the crust didn't get crisp or very brown.
Rebecca G.,Baltimore City  MD,95,346,290,11/5/2015,4.0,"A great alternative option in the Towson area  this is like a brewhouse version of Cheesecake factory  with a slightly less ""hotel-food"" menu.We\'ve enjoyed all of the food we tried at our three visits  and the staff is always really nice  despite the fact that each time they\'ve gotten parts of our order incorrect.On the first visit  they put in the wrong pizza size for D  and brought out the erroneous one AND the right one  at different times  even though we told them to just go with the wrong one (and they\'re the ones that pointed out the error).On the second visit  they forgot his salad  and the third visit  they forgot our fries.The seared ahi salad is great  quite a lot of flavor and very fresh. It does have a somewhat hidden streak of wasabi running through it  so be warned of sudden heat.The mahi mahi and shrimp tacos are good  though the multitude of sauces get a little muddled together. Mahi mahi was fresher than the shrimp  though the shrimp did have good texture.From the appetizers  the calamari is decent (nothing super special  just what you\'d expect from fried calamari)  and the ahi poke is good if a little too acidic by the end of the dish."
Brandon L.,Parkville  MD,24,89,194,11/20/2015,4.0,"I have come here twice so far  and have gotten the deep dish pizza and haven\'t been disappointed at all. I don\'t do the ""gluten-free"" food thing  but did try a piece of someone\'s gluten free pizza and it tasted like a really good thin pizza. So  if you\'re looking for gluten free food  the pizza wasn\'t that bad.The inside of the restaurant itself is pretty nice  and the bar area is also decent with a bunch of HDTV\'s around the whole bar area. They have all kinds of beers you can choose from as well  so if you\'re a beer drinker  you might want to try this place out.Their desserts are also pretty good. They are called Pazooki\'s  and I have tried a couple of them. I recommend getting the mini ones where you can choose 3 of the different flavors. I will definitely be back."
Kelsey T.,Cockeysville  MD,0,4,,3/4/2017,2.0,I shared the Ahi Poke app  and got a salad+clam chowder bread bowl for dinner. I also got a salted caramel pizookie. I also had a caribbean mule to drink. The food and drink were pretty good  the server seemed overwhelmed/slightly inattentive(I asked for another mule 3 times and never got it so....lol oh well I guess it was for the best anyway considering what happened after...). Upon returning home  I spent the rest of the night in the bathroom with what was most likely food poisoning. Yay.
Austin W.,Manchester  CT,1,41,13,5/19/2016,3.0,The pizza isn't anything special. The dough has so much air in it  making it so fluffy  that they barely put any toppings on it but it still gives the illusion that you're eating a lot of pizza. I might as well have been eating just bread. On the plus side it's not a very greasy pizza so you don't have to worry about pools of oil on the pizza.
Jeff K.,Mount Wolf  PA,55,358,31,8/30/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Just returned tonight to BJ's. They are really striking out with the root beer. This experience wasn't nearly as good as the first...THE GOOD...-seated promptly-greeted by server quickly-avocado egg rolls were still good-water refilled promptlyTHE BAD...-this time they had root beer  but it was FLAT! C'mon that's two strikes!-food order took awhile (server never checked-in with update)-water refills were room temperature (no ice refills)-deep dish pizza lacked sauce...I looked under the cheese and it was pretty dry-mushroom topping was cut up very small Overall I was a bit disappointed with my second visit. You'd figure on two separate dining experiences they'd get the root beer situation under control...nope. I wouldn't order the pizza again.
Phyllis C.,Baltimore  MD,0,1,,7/11/2017,2.0,The service is not the best. My family and I had to wait for 5 minutes before someone came over to take our drink orders. Oh  and that person was just walking by and noticed we had been there a while without being greeted. We never found out who our server actually was. The food was just ok. I ordered the salmon with asparagus. Substituted the the couscous for the mashes potatoes and everything I had tasted like it had way too much salt and pepper. The only reason I gave it two stars was because we had a coupon for BOGO free.
Shenelle T.,Middle River  MD,0,9,8,2/9/2017,4.0,Wings are amazing and so was the brisket burger! We went with a group of 9 and was very comfortable. They also had a party of 25 behind us. So the place is pretty spacious. I did not give it a 5 because they ran out of certain items on the menu. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals.
Alexis T.,Pasadena  MD,14,11,20,6/25/2015,3.0,Stopped in to check out the happy hour. It was different then what I found on the website  $1 off beers and cocktails  $2 off shareable appetizers and flatbreads  1/2 off mini deep dish pizzas  and $3 for two of the beers that I can't recall. I thought the happy hour food pricing was great but I feel like the drinks could've been better like I saw on the website. My friends and I started off with a beer taster  we tried 4 beers for $7.95 and it's worth it if you're not sure what you want/like. The menu is very intensive with a lot of food and alcohol options. I really enjoyed the berry cider that they have and I would recommend that. I shared the sliders with thin fries and they were ok. The burgers were seasoned really heavily  too much for my liking. Our server was very nice. She kept checking on us and was being very attentive. I wouldn't mind coming back and trying a main dish.
Elizabeth J.,Baltimore  MD,157,252,104,4/25/2016,3.0,We stopped in to grab a beer and a snack before our movie. Nothing special  but it did the trick. Great selection of beer  but the bar tender was moving a little slow and not familiar with the menu. Nothing to write home about  but good enough for a pre-show brew.
Rebeca F.,Pikesville  MD,49,182,,4/25/2016,4.0,I've visited twice and sat at the bar both times. Fairly friendly and attentive bartenders. Nice drink selection  although they are a bit expensive. Love the pizza! Check online for a coupon  they are usually pretty easy to find! Save room for a pizookie!
Kevin M.,Baltimore  MD,160,287,68,6/18/2015,3.0,Came in for the opening day which was my second time after the soft opening and to be quite honest it lacked a lot. While the decor and building itself has very good architecture and the fire place outside is an eye catcher. The food defiantly leaves you dissatisfied. The food was similar to that of a Chilis or a tgi Friday's with the exception of an incredible beer menu. I did try the banana beer which was tasty. The country fried chicken with gravy was truly an embarrassment  being from the south I know what country fried chicken is supposed to be like. The chicken was extremely dry and sadly placed upon a mediocre pile of less then desirable mashed potatoes and the dish was decorated with corn kernels as if it was a decoration not a side. The gravy was thick and lacked flavor.The avocado egg rolls were the worse. The sauces did not accompany the appetizer well and tasted very similar. They were not crispy and were soggy in less then a few minutes. No one at the table was satisfied with them. My friend ordered the flatbread and salad and he was not that impressed eitherFor dessert we shared the pazookie which is a cookie with ice cream which was expressed to be the best dessert and in reality all it is  is a big cookie overly sweet and soft almost undercooked with store bought ice cream on top with some kind of drizzle depending upon what you order...Defiantly seems like a lower end restaurant presenting itself as upscale. With a clientel base of college students and late night drinkers. personally have no desire to return in the near future. With all that said the staff was very friendly and seemed to be learning very well about the menu.
Nicole S.,Laurel  MD,0,2,,5/5/2017,2.0,If you come in and get the right bartender  you're in luck. This is one of the few chains that I like  and frankly  coming when it's busy isn't worth it. Connor and Danielle are wonderful and the reason I would come back  and his female counterpart Ashley is the reason that some people shouldn't be bartenders. She is rude  presumptive  lazy  haughty  and genuinely can't be bothered with you. She will not offer her services because she's too busy counting her money in front of you  clear your plates or glasses  or attempt to be hospitable. Save your time  money and efforts. If you sit at the bar and have anyone other than Connor or Danielle- just leave.
Jackie D.,Catonsville  MD,27,42,69,3/19/2016,4.0,Sat at the bar on a weeknight. Cocktails were meh  but it IS a brewhouse. Flatbread and lettuce wraps were A+. Pizookie was a little sweet  but enjoyable. Looking forward to a return visit.
Courtney S.,Davidsonville  MD,41,41,49,2/16/2016,5.0,This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants and I'm thrilled to see its in Towson now! There are very few places around here that you can get a decent deep dish pizza  so now that BJ's is here you'll never have to resist your deep dish cravings anymore. And if you love dessert? Their pizookie (my favorite is the peanut butter s'mores) will make you come back in a heartbeat. Check it out  I highly recommend it!
Nicole T.,Tacoma  WA,41,131,263,1/30/2016,4.0,Nice atmosphere would prefer to visit without the kiddos but it was a good experience. We initially if a 40 minute wait and about 20 mins into the wait we were told that it was seat yourself at the bar. So my family of four sat down after confirming with a waitress that it was indeed seat yourself only to find out after our assigned waitress told us that inly applies to the actual bar and hi-top tables. was my initial reaction and we profusely apologized however she was nice enough to say it was ok. I think we spent the entire night apologizing. We placed out order....entrees mahi-mahi tacos  bacon burger with fries  sirloin steak with mash and roasted Brussels sprouts and chicken tenders and fries. Food was out fairly fast and it was ok. I had to send my steak back because it was more on the medium side then medium well. Overall the food was good and we will most likely revisit without the kids!!!
Sana A.,Laurel  MD,205,3,,11/19/2016,1.0,"This was hands down one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. I went to BJs on 11/18/16  a Friday night  for dinner with my cousins. Right from the get-go  our service from our waitress was unacceptable. There were no smiles as she greeted us and sat us down in our booth. We began by ordering our drinks.I requested a water with lemon. Our drinks were brought out and I noticed there were no lemon  so I reminded the waitress that I had requested it. She said ok  she would bring it out. I ordered the garlic shrimp and asparagus pasta  an entree I order regularly and have grown to love. I specified I would not like any bread crumbs in my pasta  as well. After waiting for about 30 minutes  our food was brought out to us. This was the SECOND time we were seeing our waitress. She did not come check in on us while we were waiting to see if we needed anything. Yet again  she forgot to bring the lemons  although at this point  I was beginning to feel it was deliberate. At this point  I tried pushing my frustrations aside and focusing on my meal  which I order regularly and am very familiar with. Unfortunately  my entree was on par with the customer service we were receiving... highly disappointing. There were barely 4 pieces of shrimp thrown into my pasta and of course  there were breadcrumbs. I began looking for my waitress to let her know my food was not acceptable  however she was NO WHERE to be found. Yet again  she was not checking on us AT ALL. As I sat there and waited  everyone else at my table was eating their food. This was supposed to be my first real meal of the day  considering I worked all day  and I had really been looking forward to it. By the time our waitress finally showed up  I had eaten most of my meal. This was the third time we were seeing our waitress that night. She did not come check on us while we were waiting for our food  and she did not come check on us while we were eating our food. It was obvious she was not committed to providing us the customer service we usually receive at this restaurant. Nonetheless  I went ahead and informed her of my dissatisfaction. Instead of trying to alleviate my concerns  all she said was ""let me go get a manager."" At this point  I had enough. This situation would not have escalated if our waitress had taken responsibility for her mistakes and offered us a sincere apology. The first manager that came out  a Caucasian woman  made the situation even worse. She didn\'t even bother to listen as I recounted our horrible experience and the nasty attitude of our waitress. All she could focus on was the fact that I had eaten a majority of the entree. I told her that I order this entree regularly  and there was significantly less shrimp than normal. After a few minutes of going back and forth with her  I really thought I was going to lose my mind. Even the manager was talking to us in such a rude manner  instead of apologizing for our ruined meal. Eventually she cut the conversation short and asked ""So  what is it that you want me to do?"" It was obvious that my concerns meant NOTHING to her and that she just wanted to shut me up at this point. I WAS HOLDING BACK TEARS AT THIS POINT because never have I  ever  been spoken to this way  at a place I chose to give my business to. At this point  I wanted this meal from hell to be over  so I told the manager there was nothing she could do for me at this point and to please just bring our check. She did not offer any ways she could alleviate my distress or come to a solution  she just said ok and left. A few minutes later  our waitress dropped our check off at our table without saying A WORD to us. There was no ""thank you for choosing to dine with us"" or ""im sorry your meal did not turn out the way you expected"" or even ""i hope you have a great night"". SHE. DID. NOT. SAY. A. WORD. This is what sent me over the edge. They were not treating us like humans at this point  much less paying customers. I took a look at the check and saw my entree on the bill  full price. When the waitress came back  I let her know I refused to pay for my meal  so she went to get the manager again. This time another manager came out  an African American male. He was much kinder than the others.He went ahead and apologized for and took the entree off our check. As we were waiting for him to bring our new check out  our waitress stood at the bar with two other waitresses. She was loudly and profanely telling them about how I ate my food and then didn\'t want to pay for it. I could hardly believe it. I was being accused of being a cheap liar right in front of my face. I was literally being attacked for speaking up about the unacceptable service she gave us. When the male manager returned. I informed him of what I had just witnessed. He said he did not see it  so there wasn\'t much he could do. On our way out  one of the waitresses called after me ""don\'t go out if you can\'t afford it."" Needless to say  I will never be returning here."
C S.,Baltimore  MD,13,21,16,2/12/2016,3.0,Beer  Brussels sprouts & service...great  meal...NO! It was great to get here and not have a wait...so great. When we arrived  we got a good seat at a booth. Although the hostess seemed to not want to be there  our waitress was phenomenal in her service. We ordered drinks and I wanted a certain thing they didn't have and she gave me suggestions on how to get what I want without ordering it in the way I thought I needed to. The beers were great...which would have made this 4 stars yet the food was not on point. The food was not great. My friend and I ordered salmon. I ordered a glazed salmon and they ordered a blackened salmon. The glazed salmon was very sweet yet cooked correctly. The blackened salmon was over cooked and drive as we needed to use a fork and knife to cut it. The broccoli was just steamed with no seasoning. The rice was good yet probably due to the large amounts of salt used.The good thing is that our waitress talked to the manager and the cute manager stopped by and replaced the order completely. Btw  the staff in the restaurant seem to be put together and semi good looking to good looking.
Lendra C.,Columbus  OH,46,4,4,8/23/2016,5.0,"My food was good  my drinks were excellently prepared  but I had the most awesome experience because of the bartender Paul. I made a suggestion about how he could improve a specific processes in his service. And his response to me was ""thank you for telling me that  because I can always do better"" OMG! How refreshing! I was completely amazed and left with a smile on my face. Thank you for being so awesome Paul."
Ryan C.,Vernon  CT,0,2,,3/6/2017,1.0,Service was slow and then I was given dirty silverware. When i asked for new silverware I was told I had to wait for it to come out of the dish washer. My chicken sandwich came out burnt to a crisp  even the bread was burnt. I sent it back and the new sandwich was good but the whole experience was awful. The bartender was nice so I tipped her well but the kitchen needs to get it together for sure. I won't be returning. If I want bad service and burnt food I'll just have my friend invite me over for dinner again!
Kasey D.,Virginia Beach  VA,2,14,26,9/4/2016,3.0,The atmosphere is very nice I'll give them that.The menu is confusing when your ordering lunch on the weekends  small portions and over priced. Service was a bit slow and they weren't even busy. I gave them three stars because it is very clean place and the food was pretty good it not great.
Stepheny S.,Baltimore  MD,34,16,10,10/2/2016,5.0,This was a shocker... didn't have any expectations besides it was food to eat! So after a long Sunday I had no interest in cooking. Pick this place only because the Japanese place next door was closed for some reason so instead of getting back in the car said why not lol so I had a top sirloin and asparagus... when I food came out I asked the waiter (who was sweet  very good at his job and eager to please) for a1 because shitty steak needs a1. I have to say I ate the whole steak without one drop of it. My husband had a full rack of ribs and were just as good as my steak. I would recommend to everyone. I am truly pleased
Kenneth G.,Baltimore  MD,156,2,,8/29/2016,4.0,Pretty deep and extensive menu. I came at night so wasn't manny puerile surprisingly. Loved the food and service. Good place food friends to gather and drinks could be a little better or stronger.
Jalisa J.,Owings Mills  MD,56,128,178,12/14/2015,4.0,I've been here two or three times and have yet to be disappointed! The food is delicious and the beer is good. We have always had great servers and a good time at BJ's.
Tierra W.,Gwynn Oak  Gwynn Oak  MD,0,1,,3/22/2017,1.0,Horrible service. My partner and I went in to sit at the bar for dinner. After waiting a while (too long) and watching a Caucasian couple come in after us given menus and drinks still received no service.
Bruce K.,Baltimore  MD,12,1,,11/7/2015,1.0,"If there was a zero....The bartender accidentally dropped a carafe of wine on bar ..glass broke.. Covered my wife\'s face and clothing and ... You think after broken glass they would have offered to replace our food?!To add insult to injury .. A different bartender . Asked if all way okay.. My wife said my clothes are soaked with wine... And now I have to take a shower.. The bartenders response... Wait for it.. Was to say ""that\'s what you get for being a lush""..I\'m sure that bartender has a future in stand-up comedy.. Or table waiting Oh well.. We did not pay for that glass of wine.. Spoke to manager who seemed to not really care.. Did not offer a thing other than an \'Oh wow\'We can tolerate an accident; but not the lack of concern. If you like a bartender that spills wine in your face..and an apothetic manager.. This is your placePlus..so kid friendly .. They let kids play with toy cars in the bar"
Chuck D.,Reisterstown  MD,8,48,,3/11/2017,3.0,Went for a late lunch  party of five. Servers were friendly but very slow. The food was good. Boneless wings  potatoe skins  shrimp taco  buffalo chicken pizza  cauliflower taco  salmon taco were all very good. Beer selection is great. If the service was better  it would have been a great visit.
D M.,Baltimore County  MD,3,53,98,1/31/2016,3.0,The Mediterranean Chicken Pita Tacos with the side of grains was good. Light and filling. Blood Orange Pom Sangria had cinnamon whisky and a cinnamon stick in it. Didn't think the cinnamon worked...for a sangria. Service was fine. Bathrooms clean.
Kerri M.,Baltimore  MD,42,160,13,6/24/2015,1.0,I was going to give this place  two stars but reconsidered because it was really that bad of an experience. The only good thing this place has going for it is the beer selection. I guess the service from the wait staff was also acceptable  but still not enough to give this place two stars.Open  airy space. Got a Chilis vibe going on. Multiple TV's. Menu is rather large and too extensive  which is probably part of the problem. Menu is also kind of boring. Nothing really special or eye catching. Typical stuff like burgers  salad  sandwiches  pizza  etc.Started off with the potato skins as an appetizer. Boy were they bland. Tasteless.My partner ordered the black & bleu burger and he could not finish it because it was so bland. The fries that came with the burger were of the shoestring variety. They also lacked salt. I ordered the Kale & Brussel sprout salad with chicken. It was awful. It was a super soggy mess and I could not finish it. Why was it so soggy and floppy? The dressing that it had been soaking in was not good either - strawberry vinaigrette. Didn't really taste of much other than vinegar. The salad was supposed to have goat cheese in it  but it definitely had bleu cheese in it. Bleh. This is just a generic place trying too hard not to be generic by charging a lot for their plain food. Really regret coming here and will not return.
Todd D.,Towson  MD,0,8,,7/12/2015,2.0,"This place was pretty bad. On par with crappy bar chains but worse. Five words to describe the food: Generic  soggy  greasy  processed  bland. Sandwiches were over-salted to hide the fact that they had no flavor. Everything was soggy from the grease. The salads were a mess  covered in wayyy too much gross dressing. The appetizers were mushy and greasy - the avocado spring roll thing is terrible. Drinks were watered down and really sugary.The only reason for two stars - service was fine and the beer selection was pretty good. They did some cool ""layering"" with their beers. Aside from that  I would strongly avoid this place. Their menu is so expansive that instead of making 15-20 quality items  they have 200+ terrible items."
Robert B.,Towson  MD,1,20,,7/30/2016,2.0,"Serviceable but not much more. Table service was good. Nice clean bathroom. Hostess seemed like she was attached to an unreliable motion detector -- she was staring at nothing when we came in  then eventually noticed we were there and flipped to the ""on"" position.It\'s a bar and grill  so we got burgers  the hickory brisket burger and sliders. The burger was ordered medium and definitely wasn\'t -- I have no idea why restaurants incapable of cooking to order bother to ask. The sliders were *very* greasy. The shoestring fries were good  nice and crispy.Not the worst I\'ve had by any means  but there\'s not really much reason to return."
Kiersten L.,Hawthorne  NY,80,105,50,10/4/2015,4.0,Came here for the first time with my parents and it was delicious! Their menu is huge  and a bulk of it is drinks- so if you like beer and margaritas definitely go. I had the Santa Fe Salad  and my parents had the chicken pesto sandwich. We both enjoyed our entrees very much. The service was quick and friendly and the atmosphere was cool and modern. Highly recommend!
Jonathan P.,Cockeysville  MD,100,91,82,6/18/2015,5.0,I am throughly impressed by this place! BJ's just opened a few days ago. They have a great atmosphere and ambience. The service is really good. Our waiter was very attentive and super helpful in recommending dishes. The food was amazing. I had the jambalaya. The rice and shrimp were cooked perfectly and the dish overall had great flavor. My wife had a burger with fries which was really good as well. We couldn't stop eating the fries (lol) and the burger was juicy with great flavor. There is a huge selection of beer. We had the Nit Nat(I think that's the name) which was good. Desert was amazing. We had the macadamia nut white chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. We don't usually have desert but maaaaaaaan this desert was da BOMB!!! Lol. We will definitely be back!
Allison T.,Rosedale  MD,34,5,2,7/21/2016,4.0,We came in relatively late  and sat around waiting for the rest of our party which is really annoying to servers  but Elisse (sorry is spelling isn't correct) was a breath of fresh air. Very pleasant and wonderful. We will be coming back for her and your awesome rewards program. Oh and of course the pizookies!
Irene A.,Ocean City  MD,13,4,,1/15/2017,4.0,Food was good. I had the grilled chicken breast which was cooked nice. My son had the kids burger which he did not like because he did not like the flavor. The wings were delicious and so was everything else. I would like to come again.
Kevin J.,Evesham Township  NJ,39,203,11,6/29/2015,4.0,I had a great experience at BJ's on Sunday night. Beer- I tried the hefferveisen and my wife got the stout. We both liked the beers. The stout was better and had a unique taste. The hefferviesen was not heavy enough for my liking  but it was still good. Not enough heff! The price point at $5.75 a beer is a little steep. I heard they have a happy hour. I will come back one night and sample more of their brews during that time. Food- The food was excellent. Their menu is huge  maybe too huge. I had a double burger and my wife had some kind of chicken sandwich. Both were great  had flavor  large proportions and were reasonably priced. Their thinly cut French fries are awesome! I saw a couple deep dish pizza's around them room. They looked good.Atmosphere- Nothing crazy to report home about. It was clean  new  and spacious. Looked like there was plenty of space at the bar and adequate seating. Service- Top notch! Attentive hostesses and wait staff. Other- They have a decent rewards program I signed up for. Check it out at their website before they go. Apparently you can pay via app. I did't do this  but that seems new and high tech. There are now a ton of good restaurants in that square there by the movie theater. This is one of the better ones. I will be back!
Vincent D.,Towson  MD,25,87,273,4/10/2016,2.0,Came here on a week night. Place had about 8 tables occupied and some patrons at the bar. Not a busy night. The place was nice. Our waitress was nice and the food was ok. However... I saw some people (at different times) waiting (some left) at the entrance because there was no one there to seat them. Some customers left without ordering- I guess no one was paying them attention. The guy who brought us our food just turned around and walked away- while my friend was still talking asking for ketchup. This place could be better.
Emily B.,Towson  MD,33,10,,4/23/2016,3.0,Went for dinner last night and had a big comfy booth for just the two of us. We sat for about 10-15 minutes before our waitress realized we were there. Food came out in a decent amount of time and was hot. Ingredients seemed fresh and food was very good. Service was incredibly slow and we were never given utensils. We had to find another server to bring napkins since ours was MIA so often. Staff all looked miserable and were slow but the food was good. Probably won't go back again for a meal.
Keisha C.,Baltimore  MD,34,25,119,7/23/2015,3.0,Don't usually like chain restaurants but they places was pretty good. The large bar area was clean  invited and large. I like that they have outdoor seating available  which is a nice benefit for warm weather months. The vast menu allowed for great food options to choose from. Service was attentive. The only negative is that the entrees are pretty pricey for a chain restaurant.
Sarah G.,Arlington  VA,220,336,92,1/25/2016,4.0,"Bar only review!A friend and I came in here to kill some time before a movie at the Cinemark a block away. It was a perfect spot for that  and despite large Saturday night crowds  we found some spots at the bar. Our bartender was right with us with menus and giving us the specials. They had drink specials for the games that were playing on the numerous TVs. I ended up ordering a berry beer which I thought was a cider since it was listed under ""Cider & Fruit Beers"" but my eyes only read Cider lol. Surprisingly (even though I really don\'t like beer) this was super tasty! Probably because it tasted nothing like beer  but more like a fruit wine spritzer aka super girly but I don\'t care! It was really refreshing and easy to drink. Our bartender even gave me a shot\'s worth of the Berry Burst Cider which they have an option to mix with the Belgian fruit beer I was drinking. Very tasty together!It\'s a great spot that I\'d love to try out in the future because the food that was coming out around us looked really good too. Plus with other locations closer to my work  it shouldn\'t be too hard to find the time!"
Michel D.,Gunpowder  MD,0,3,,10/16/2016,4.0,We arrived around 5:00 PM on a Sunday. Admittedly not a real busy time of the week for a restaurant. The wait staff was courteous and attentive. We ordered two pizzas  bacon with chicken and a Mediterranean  and a BBQ bison burger. The food was good and well presented. My only complaint was the beer. While they have a large selection of beer on tap  all the beer is kept at about 37 degrees Fahrenheit. This is fine for most lagers and ales but is too cold for porters and stouts  the finish tends to be bitter unless porters and stouts are kept at about 50 degrees. A bit disappointing since I'm a fan of dark beers.
Geo F.,Gwynn Oak  Gwynn Oak  MD,0,1,,5/13/2017,1.0,"Left a movie  and walked in to BJ\'s and a young lady who was a hostess told me that a young man who had started to walk away would be with me to place my carry out order. She then called him while he ran to the kitchen and asked him to take my order when he came back. When he came back almost ten minutes later  he had his jacket on and back pack  ready to go out the door. Before he left  he was ""kind"" enough to tell me  while walking back into the carry out booth  that I should place my order at the bar. This was around 10:30 this evening of May 13th. There were two girls and this guy I spoke to on tonight\'s shift. Sad.....because we went somewhere else and the restaurant lost business only because of a young guy that was rude and thought he was being slick. Took us for being stupid making us wait while he got his jacket and backpack to make his exit. Get some customer service training and if you don\'t know how to act like an adult in the service business  go do something else."
Valerie N.,Parkville  MD,0,36,,8/16/2015,3.0,I continue to have a great experience here  and it's been my third time dining at BJ's. They have a great beer selection  the bar tenders are good-natured  and the food is delicious. They also have a neat happy hour from 3-6 on weekdays and also during aired football games. They offer discounted appetizers  pizzas  and drinks on their happy hour.Overall a really cool place  making it one of our go-to restaurants in the area. I'd recommend their deep dish pizzas and Hefeweizen beer. It's a delicious combo!Edit: since my original review  their happy hour has turned into just a dollar off of their drafts. Also  the food comes out extremely slowly and there has been many mistakes with orders. I have tried contacting management to bring this to their attention  but no response. It's a shame that I felt the need to adjust the rating from a 5 to a 3.
Jalina M.,Baltimore  MD,3,4,,4/7/2016,2.0,This was my first visit to this restaurant and my husbands second. He advised against this restaurant due to his lackluster food on his initial visit. I thought maybe they were having an off day and his pizza wasn't delicious that one time and another shot should be given. Boy was I wrong! The service wasn't bad  but it wasn't good either. Our waitress was between rude and slightly nice? She was not excited at all and her demeanor was as if she had better things to be doing instead of being a polite server. We also noticed there were cliques of employees and lots of standing around doing nothing  this isn't optimal behavior at a restaurant.Now on to the food  the root beer wings were really good. The deep dish pizza was not- tasteless and no sauce to speak of  crust was buttery and greasy and the waitress wasn't surprised I said something about the lack of sauce she just brought out a cup of marinara sauce... I'm sad to say that we didn't even order dessert because I didn't want to be disappointed with that. Also I'd like to add I was disappointed by the response to the no sauce on the pizza  she didn't even inquire if we wanted a new pizza made  she just brought the sauce which was tacky in my opinion. I also think with a complaint like that  a manager should've been notified to inquire how the experience can be upgraded to encourage another visit. So maybe this review will help you to determine if this the place to go for your next dining out experience  I'm not saying I'll never go back but I hope that they get better service and food before I do. If I could sum up the experience  I'd call it bad service with a smile...
Mimi A.,Riverdale Park  MD,88,4,1,3/6/2016,5.0,"So this week was one of my best friends\' birthday and as a last minute thing after going empire his kids to Port Discovery  I told him I wanted to get something to eat/take him out to eat for his bday. As a last minute thing  he suggested horseshoe casino m  because they have good food there. I told him I DID NOT want burgers  that I wanted real dinner-type food. So first place we checked out was the steakhouse on the bottom floor. The menu looked great  but my friend didn\'t seem like he was feeling it  because it was a little too stuffy for him. He really seemed interested in going to Guy Fieri\'s place  so I said ""OK let\'s go check out the menu."" From the second that we walked up there  he was hooked just by the friendliness of the hostesses  of course  I still had to check out the menu. I ended up seeing that they had more than just burgers and agreed that it\'d be a cool place to eat. Our server was Monique  a super friendly  super knowledgeable waitress who gave us great service! Then  at some point  the restaurant manager came by to stop by and say hello  which seems to be standard these days  but my friend happen to know her so that made the experience even cooler  but what I was really blown away by was that towards the end of our meal  the general manager came by to say hi and see how things were going  asked if we needed anything  to which I replied  ""yes  everything is GREAT  but if I could get a to-go ramekin for this sauce I\'d really appreciate it."" She tells me  ""sure  of course!"" and then proceeds to buss our table!!! Let me repeat that  the general manager bussed our table!! Not only that  but she brought back good to-go ramekins herself and didn\'t send someone to bring them to me! I got some Hawaiian chicken bbq dish that I wasn\'t blown away by  but my friend LOVED his burger and I would DEFINITELY  100% come back to this place for the experience that you get starting at the front door and beyond! There was another guy who kept coming by our table and I don\'t know what his position was there  but he was also super friendly and funny. Definitely check out this place  especially if you\'re someone who appreciates great service!!!"
Erika H.,Columbia  MD,72,39,45,3/29/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Normally love BJ's but don't go there on a weekday at night. We waited 5 minutes or more at the hostess desk before we were even acknowledged. Then we were seated and sat there 15 more minutes without anyone ever coming over to even take drink orders. There were a good amount of people there and more coming in so you'd think they'd make sure everyone was taken care of but all the staff seemed to be totally uninterested and moving too slow. So we left.
Jessica D.,Atlanta  GA,259,214,187,11/16/2015,4.0,I've been here a few times. For the most part the food is decent nothing to be excited about. Although being from Atlanta I was happy to find lemon pepper wings on the menu. The one thing I would say on the menu that is worth getting excited about it the pazzoki. My mouth waters just thinking about it and they have a couple different flavors. I've had the macadamia nut as well as the salted caramel both absolutely amazing. I tend to sit at the bar when I come. The service is usually pretty good although if it gets busy they tend to forget about you. There is one bartender she usually works during the day from what I see but she has a thick southern accent and she's always very sweet if you ever get the pleasure. I recommend coming on Tuesdays they have half off wine glasses and bottles which I can't resist especially since I'm not a fan of beer. During happy hour they have beer specials and $2 off apps. BJs is always cool for a quick bite before a movie so check them out.
Melissa G.,Nottingham  MD,36,4,3,2/14/2016,5.0,Self seating in the bar! Saved lots of time on 45 minute wait. Service was good. Siracha queso dip and Mediterranean chicken tacos. Yum! Will definitely return.
Mike B.,Nottingham  MD,0,2,,4/24/2016,4.0,Good brews with plenty of selections. I really like the bar setup if your a sports junkie like myself. Food is good also  I recommend this place.Cheers
Kate R.,Cockeysville  MD,10,4,,10/2/2015,5.0,"We don\'t go out to eat often so it\'s always a bummer when we have a disappointing experience. Such was not the case AT ALL with BJ\'s. We couldn\'t have been more thrilled. In fact  I think we were in a better mood when we left than we were when we got there!The food is pretty much what you would expect if you\'re looking for pub-type fare but I couldn\'t believe the options. It wasn\'t just burgers and wings  there were so many interesting things on the menu. I ordered the Lemon Thyme Chicken which was delicious. I love that they have an ""EnLIGHTened"" portion of their menu. The food was good but the staff was incredible. We ordered a pitcher of beer and realized pretty soon that the waitress brought us the wrong beer. We let her know and she apologized and told us to just finish the pitcher we had and that she would bring a new one with the beer that we ordered at no extra cost to us. That was pretty much all my boyfriend needed to hear. It was a simple gesture but it goes a long way in terms of customer service. She was quick  attentive but not TOO attentive  friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. It wasn\'t just her though  the hostess was great and every single staff member that we encountered was friendly and just GOOD at their job. We even called the manager over to let her know how impressed we were. We were there once before but just had drinks at the bar and the bartender was SO friendly and engaging. She overheard us talking about movies and ended up talking movies with us for the next ten minutes which was so fun. Oh and I would be remiss if I didn\'t mention the incredible beer selection. Often times when you go out to eat  if a waiter or waitress isn\'t assigned to a table then they don\'t want to help that table and I get that. They work on tips and every second counts so I wouldn\'t hold that against anyone. But it seems like the staff at BJ\'s is trained to treat every single customer well regardless of whether or not they\'ll be tipped by that customer. It\'s rare and it\'s truly impressive. I hope the place sticks around for a long time and I hope that a lot of people have the amazing experience that my boyfriend and I had. I really can\'t wait to go back."
Cassandra R.,Baltimore  MD,19,10,72,10/22/2015,3.0,"Nice new bar near the mall and moive theater. Great for watching sports because they\'ve got these HUGE HD flat screens long the perimiter of the bar. I only went for drinks so I can\'t speak on the food. I ordered a drink called ""A Drink Like That""....its probably one of the strongest drinks b/c it\'s got 151 in it. Very Tasty....like a firecracker ice cream pop in a drink. I had two and was done for the night. Cool vibes."
Don M.,Towson  MD,0,38,2,12/19/2015,2.0,Ok  I don't normally leave two star reviews but this place has potential so I am hoping it will help. The food is not bad at all. Though we never got our appetizer  the two sandwiches and salmon plate we ordered was better than expected for a chain resturant. The issue here was horrible service. I would have even overlooked that  but it was not just our waitress  it was the lot of them. You can see into the kitchen from the dinning room  so watching 6 or more wait staff in there shooting the bull while your food gets cold is more than a little irritating. We could hear the other tables also complaining so it was not just us. I should add we were there at 11:30am on a Saturday  so not at all busy. This was our first time here  and it will be a bit before we return. Hope they get better  and I get a chance to improve this review!
Sean O.,Baltimore  MD,1,2,,2/15/2016,4.0,"My girlfriend and I came here after walking out of ""World of Beer""  next door. I\'m glad we did! We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted and introduced to both bartenders working. The lady that served us was engaging  made great suggestions and truly made the experience great. I ordered the Hickory Brisket and Bacon Burger  as suggested by the server. Although the burger was overcooked  it still tasted good. I also enjoyed their house drafts on tap  I would suggest the Hopstorm IPA. I would definitely return again just based on the service alone."
Tyesha C.,Baltimore  MD,3,32,16,11/14/2015,1.0,I have meat allergies to red meat & pork. I asked for ravioli with chicken instead of sausage. This order was to go. So when I get home there was pork all throughout. Fortunately I noticed after 2 bites that it did contain pork and I did not have any immediate reaction. That womps! Probably not going back ever again.
Megan M.,New York  NY,139,72,93,10/30/2015,5.0,Just ate at BJ's for dinner and our mean and service was great. Our waitress Caitlyn S was very attentive and sweet. Our food was done perfectly  I had the bacon avocado burger (highly recommended). The only complaint was out food came out very quickly and we didn't get to finish our appetizer. Other than that very good
Alan S.,Owings Mills  MD,0,15,,8/10/2016,5.0,Excellent burgers. Fun vibe. A little noisy. Easy parking in garage. Food is always good. Do the beer tasting. They give you 5 or 6 small glasses of beer. Lots of fun. Wide selection of beers. Good times. Reasonably priced. Right next to the Cinemark movies.
Jerry C.,Baltimore  MD,2,121,54,11/6/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"Not a fan of this place. This was my third time here. Food taste like any commercial franchise place--some fresh and a lot of processed. Sitting at the bar the service was great. Once we moved to tables  it was mediocre. Management had too few servers to handle a Friday night. We rarely saw our server. Had to ask the bartender to check on our drinks. One runner who brought our friends\' pizza was too lazy to walk around the table and hand it to him. She just stuck it out for someone to grab so we could pass it around to the right person. The look on the runners face was ""really you gonna make me walk over 4ft?"" Finally  at the end of the night  had to ask the bartender to take our checks because our server couldn\'t be found."
Melonie O.,Catonsville  MD,0,14,28,12/3/2015,1.0,service was terrible and there was a little flying bug on my food. when I asked the server to take it back  she got an attitude. will not be attending this place again.
Charles Peter D.,Towson  MD,0,20,,10/29/2015,1.0,Nothing special here. To pool bar room for food with a California twist. Had the French dip sandwich and it was not him pressed. Second time I went I had The avocado burger and it was dry and overcooked
Chase S.,Baltimore  MD,0,21,16,11/23/2015,3.0,The food is great! There is not a doubt about that  but tonight's service was terrible. The wait for the food was long (and there is not a lot of patrons in the restaurant). One of our meals was given to another party. We never received our appetizers. I expect better from this franchise.
Barry B.,Baltimore  MD,154,1,,1/21/2016,1.0,This is one of the worst places I've been to. First we start 35 mins before a server came. Another 25 minutes for our drinks and finally another 45 minutes for our entrees. Everyone at my table had their food and I get mine 35 minutes after they finish. This is horrible. I will never come back. The first salmon they brought was dry and over cooked and Noe this one is just as bad. I'm too thru
Tanisha A.,Roanoke  VA,63,18,,11/6/2015,5.0,Stopping here was a last minute decision when looking for late lunch/early dinner. I had read good things regarding this place on their facebook page but we wanted to be the judges for ourselves. Service was awesome  atmosphere and dining experience was awesome. I LOVE the wide variety of selections they have to choose from. Their beer and desert selection is awesome. We had a bacon cheeseburger and the ravioli. The burger had a wonderful flavor and cooked perfect for a well done burger. The ravioli was sooooo good. It had the perfect amount of meat and cheese. The only thing I will mention to the server if it happens again is that the food could have been slightly warmer when served. Aside from that we are sure we will visit again!
Pete N.,Towson  MD,0,6,,6/16/2016,1.0,Everything seemed fine while we were there for lunch June 11  but a few hours later we were both really sick to our stomachs and it ruined our weekend. It was the only thing we ate all day so no doubt we got food poisoning.
Kim S.,Reisterstown  MD,44,16,22,6/19/2015,5.0,I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this place. From the decor to the bartenders.. everything was great. I had the Fried Artichokes and the Brussel sprouts.. both were excellent. I would highly recommend this place.
Alli R.,Mount Wolf  PA,37,40,,9/27/2015,3.0,Visited Bj's on two occasions. Great location  but unless you know the area  parking stinks. The food was really good and I would give more stars  but the first time they were out of root beer. The second visit  the root beer was extremely flat and I couldn't drink it. The avocado rolls are fantastic. Very unique and the dipping sauce is excellent. The service was great both times as well. Although the second time  the waiter seemed to disappear at the end. I would go back because I enjoyed the food. Hopefully one day I will get to try their root beer!!
Steve E.,Towson  MD,0,1,,7/1/2015,1.0,If I could give less stars I would. 3 times I've been there and 3 times I left disappointed. The first time our Bartender forgot to put in our food order and since we had a movie to catch  we weren't able to get it. Second time wings took 25+ minutes to arrive to the table and the ribs were extremely tough. We said something to the server and she didn't even acknowledge the complaint. The third and worst time we sat in the cocktail area and we stared at our drinks for 10 minutes before we had to flag our server down to get them. Again wings took extremely long and had to cancel them. Zero stars. Terrible service for just OK food. Avoid at all costs in my opinion. Save your $$$
Paulette H.,Parkville  MD,38,1,,12/6/2015,1.0,I don't normally write reviews on restaurants  but this one was the worst! The service wasn't great  our waiter had no customer service skills. When I received my food it was incorrect. I sent it back and it returned still incorrect. They never apologize for the inconvenience. The manager was sitting across from us and didn't even come over to apologize. I will not return to this establishment again!
Elizabeth H.,Sparks  NV,49,6,,1/5/2016,5.0,I got one of the personal pizza for dinner with a bunch of friends and it was delicious. All of us ended up getting them. The personal pizzas where no bigger than a plate but that filled us up we also got desserts and ended up just getting three and all six of us split them. I will definitely go back there again.
Stephanie G.,Yorkville  Manhattan  NY,12,3,,10/9/2015,4.0,Fun date night in the heart of Towson! Get discounted tickets for the movies afterwards!
Jason B.,Woodstock  MD,0,20,3,12/20/2015,3.0,Atmosphere is good and the TVs are big and good quality. The food is okay  decent and the menu is huge so you should be able to find something you like. Large beer selection on tap.
Mark K.,Stewartstown  PA,0,1,,6/18/2016,5.0,The lemon thyme chicken was delicious and the deep dish pizza was very good. The service was excellent. Looking forward to going back again!
Alexis C.,Huntington Beach  CA,36,72,112,6/30/2015,5.0,I love the location since you can grab dinner and walk to the movie theatre! Brussel sprouts  cherry chipotle salmon  and s'mores pizookie are a must!
Jason P.,Towson  MD,5,53,15,7/15/2015,3.0,Their own beer is pretty good and there are a lot of menu options -- but otherwise  there's nothing that would draw me here -- primarily based on the location.Truthfully  I don't know why/how a restaurant chain like BJ's exists in this area. Well  I guess I do... shoppers and tourists. There are just much better local independent options 10 mins away that I would patronize before BJ's.
Maurice O.,Cockeysville  MD,1,11,,12/6/2015,4.0,I wish i could give a 3.5 but ill round up because the food is awesome. But if you go here  expect to be there awhile. Never had to wait for a table but ive ALWAYS had to wait way longer than acceptable for a server. And the time it takes to get your food after you order is outrageous too. Then when you get the food  might as well ask for the check. The food  beer  and dessert are all great. But the wait makes it sometimes better just to go elsewhere. But if youre in no rush  eat at this place.
Kristina T.,Germantown  MD,0,3,,1/31/2016,1.0,It took the waiter 30 minutes to get out order. We then waited an addition 30+ for our meals which  ended up getting dropped on the floor before they reached the table. We were told they would rush the orders and it ended up taking another 30 minutes and coming out wrong. The manager came over and apologized but did not try and make the situation right. Terrible service  we barely even saw our waiter the whole night.
Rod R.,Parkville  MD,0,6,6,8/8/2015,5.0,Service was great. Facility is nice and clean. Tons of micro brews and the deep dish pizza was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend.
Delinda J.,Parkville  MD,3,19,,7/18/2015,4.0,Great  great and great! Kale and brussel sprout salad was awesome and bj's classic combo pan pizza was tasty! Save room for a pizookie...certainly a must try! Delosh and great service!
Jen D.,Nottingham  MD,0,26,7,6/17/2015,4.0,"Brand new place. Really cool atmosphere. My husband had a beer and I had a skinny Rita. Both good. Our waiter was attentive and helpful. The pizza (deep dish) was good! Flakey and not too greasy. Our waiter talked us into downloading the BJs app to start collecting reward points  so we did. When the bill came  my husband noticed you can pay through the app  so he did. We left. The waiter ran after us into the parking garage. We asked if we forgot something and he said  ""you didn\'t pay!"" We told him we paid through the app. It was the first time he had a guest pay through the app...honest mistake on his part. Also  the restaurant will validate your parking. We had them validate it  but when we put the ticket in  it wasn\'t validated. We paid...it is only $2 to park anyway. Overall  good food. But the app needs some help!"
Jamie B.,Reisterstown  MD,0,16,,10/12/2015,1.0,"This was a very disappointing dinner. I\'ll start my review with the food:Calamari Appetizer- Not that crispy. Included more ""rings"" than tentacles. Sirloin steak cooked medium rare with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts: steak was not medium rare. It was more like medium with the outside very well done. Hard to explain... but it was tough. It did have a tasty rub on it though  but since it was so dry I had to ask for steak sauce. The mashed potatoes were very good but you really can\'t mess that up. The brussel sprouts were dry  flavorless  and luke warm. Greek chicken wrap: My mom ordered this and while I did not try it  she said that it was not that good. The rice salad served with it was cold and she didn\'t like it. Jambalaya: My dad ordered this and I did try it. I thought it had okay flavor. It had some spice. But he wasn\'t impressed. It had a lot of sauce and should have been served with bread. He asked for some bread  which the waiter did bring out  but he seemed kind of put off. Pink Cadillac martini- this drink tasted very good but I felt that it had more juice than alcohol. Usually a martini is a bit stronger. This was more like a fruity mixed drink. Service: we had come here to celebrate my mother\'s birthday. I told the person on the phone when I made the reservation that it was her birthday and asked if they did anything. They said yes. Well... they did nothing. It was a bit disappointing especially after the sub par food. Also I had asked the waiter if he recommended the steak  and if it was tender. He said yes. We also asked him if calamari was good  he said it was the most popular appetizer. My mother asked him if the greek chicken wrap was a good choice  and he said it was popular. Lies! We will not be returning."
Ralph K.,Baltimore  MD,4,7,,7/25/2015,3.0,Only 3 stars due to the service we received. If it was based on food alone  the score would be much lower. I stopped in shortly after this place opened to have a business lunch with an influential friend of mine. Other than our server  Marianna  we were honestly not impressed. Given what she had to work with it really made our experience great.We ordered an avocado appetizer. Some sort of egg roll. I can only imagine it was frozen. The avocado was mushy and brown. My Guest got a salad and the dressing was overly sweet as was the dipping sauce for the appetizer. It was nearly a small bowl of molasses.Draft beer was good and my lunch entre was acceptable. I mostly felt like it was any chain restaurant. If the food quality improves as a staff becomes more experienced it could be a good place assuming that the staff is as good as as our server was.I hear that the pizza here is good  so I am hoping to give it a second shot.
Marci C.,Reisterstown  MD,0,30,41,7/18/2015,4.0,I ordered the kale salad. I was a little nervous based on other reviews. I got the dressing on the side. The salad was DELICIOUS. The lettuce was crisp and yummy! My son got a grilled cheese which was huge. My hubby got the Barbaco chicken. All were very very good. The only small issue was the main dishes came out too early. We didn't have much time to eat the appetizers.
Kelly J.,Baltimore  MD,1,4,,6/23/2015,5.0,Our family came in for dinner tonight & had an amazing experience! The service was awesome  our server Maria (I hope I got it right!) took great care of us! The food was fantastic  and we were thrilled to enjoy a new spot that is kid friendly & we could enjoy a tasty brew we have been waiting for quite some time for a place like this in our neighborhood! We will be back again for sure.
Sarah J.,Baltimore  MD,0,5,,7/10/2015,5.0,Sat in the cocktail section during lunch. Beautiful bar  for starters. Love the open  garage door-style windows. Really brought in the summer vibes.Our server  Maryana  was impeccable. Our party had pushed two tables together in her section (she even helped move them!) and she handled our large party effortlessly. Drinks were rung in and came out quickly (the bar was slow and I noticed her get a bartenders attention to make sure they knew a drink order was in). Encouraged us to join the rewards program  which I did. Food came out perfectly  in a good amount of time  and was delicious! I got a mini deep dish pizza. So. Freaking. Good. Crust is buttery and crispy...I love it!Maryana was very attentive  unobtrusively offering refills on drinks as necessary  and bringing other little things (extra sides of mayo and such) and clearing empty plates with cheer and good humor. Highly recommend for the food  drinks  and service. Will definitely be back.
Kate B.,Charles North  Baltimore  MD,0,10,,1/15/2016,5.0,We just tried BJ's today and it was great. The food was good  our server was terrific  and they had a great kids' menu. This is an excellent addition to the movie theater development.
Amber W.,Parkville  MD,41,10,7,1/11/2016,2.0,Went here once before and had a good time  but this past Friday's visit did not live up to my expectations. We found seats at the bar easily and ordered some beers. shortly after looking at the menu we decided to order some potato skins. The bartender put in our order and in like 10min. set out some plates and silverware for us. we finished our first beers and ordered 2 more while waiting on our potato skins. then after 40min. went by after ordering our potato skins we decided we needed to say something  and while having beers full in front of us it was hard to get the bartenders attention. eventually we did and she seemed shocked we did not have our food yet and went back to check on it. she came back 5min. later saying it would be about 2min. the first batch was burnt and no one told her. so 15min. later she goes back into the back to bring us our potato skins. I was so hungry at this point that I just at the potato skins even though they hardly had any cheese on them and were over done a bit. We waited over an hour for poor potato skins. It made me really sad  and the server never apologized for the wait or anything. We left shortly after kind of wishing we would have gone somewhere else. I do not know if we will come here again when we are looking for drinks and appetizers  even if I really love their berry cider.
Steve G.,Towson  MD,32,78,20,11/4/2015,4.0,I like their food and beer selections. On the beer side I love the fact they offer not only their own brews  but also several other locals which I enjoy. I typically eat at the bar and I've never had a bad experience. The staff is very good and will readily answer your questions about the beers. They have made several good recommendations. I've enjoyed the dinners I've had there--particularly the Asian Chicken Salad and the Steak. (I think they recently dropped that salad from their menu but they do have others which I will try in the future.) They have plenty of TV's so you can catch a game while you're there. (I kinda wish they gave the option of having the small boxes where you can get the audio for the game you're watching as opposed to the music over the PA.) I would recommend downloading their smartphone app since they do offer some freebies (such as appetizers). They also offer free wifi. (Side note: another nearby restaurant also offers wifi and their signal is pretty strong. So you have two potential options.) Overall I like the place and like to stop off for a beer  dinner  or snack after going to the nearby movie theater.
K M.,Eagle Mountain  UT,0,56,,2/8/2016,4.0,Great food in good servings. The pizookie is to die for  in every flavor! You won't regret eating here. Parking can be a hassle but the food is worth every penny.
Frank B.,Parkville  MD,1,7,,2/14/2016,1.0,If you want to go out for a nice Valentine's Day Dinner  send it back to the kitchen twice  because it is not cooked right and go home to make your own dinner - then this is the place for you.
B L.,Baltimore  MD,0,12,3,9/25/2015,2.0,Food was decent and good drink and beer selection but it took WAY too long for things to arrive. Very slow.
Matthew H.,Washington  DC,0,4,,10/29/2015,4.0,Great spot for a beer and a deep dish pizza. There are plenty of items on the menu that is sure to appeal to everyone. The beer flights are fun to try. The only thing I can criticize is the happy hour menu is nothing special. However  the staff  food  and drinks were good.
Judivelly T.,Baltimore  MD,2,22,17,6/23/2015,5.0,Very attentive and friendly staff with an extensive and delicious menu. They're lunch combos are filling and well priced.
Ric K.,Annapolis  MD,1,2,,11/11/2015,4.0,Sat at the bar... Eventually greeted by bartender right in front of me engrossed in her recipe book making a mixed drink...she said she would be right with me.....ummm...13 minutes latter another bartender stopped by and I was able to order a beer...which is what I came for....been to many BJs...but first time here....almost walked out from the wait (for beer WoB is next door)...but glad I stayed...pumpkin beer was good and the pale ale excellent...and the siracha chicken Mac and cheese great addition to menu...chicken was rubbery...but the Mac was creamy and very cheesy...wow get again....overall would rate this place poor overall based on the service (the bar not busy at all with three bartenders)...but...being that it was Veterans Day....and they had an entree special supporting our vets...then I will support them and recommend...
Michael C.,Towson  MD,0,6,,9/29/2015,4.0,Went here with a group from work. Burger was pretty good and so was the stout. Service was quick. The menu is huge so it would be a good place to go with people who like different things. Ill probably go back.
Christopher M.,Baltimore  MD,0,1,,7/1/2015,1.0,Just horrendous service. I was staring at my drink for 10 minutes before the server realized they were ready. Then he walked by it to grab a tray before delivering it me. Had to cancel my order of wings. Then when they finally came out  they were wrong.
Evelyn S.,Essex  MD,0,7,,11/9/2015,2.0,We were greeted at the door without smiles by the hostesses. All we were asked was 'table or booth?' Then when we were seated it took 15 minutes before our waitress walked by our table and said she would be with us shortly. The draft orange soda was great. (we can't drink alcohol but usually breweries have great food). We were there for lunch. I ordered the classic burger and my husband the bacon burger. I ordered mine medium well  it was almost all rare to medium( I should have sent it back). The fries were good. We ordered the trio of pizookas for dessert. They were fine but nothing special- my husband did like the peanut butter one. The bathrooms were amazingly clean! But on the way out my husband and I agreed that there is no reason we would return  nothing special about it. I do know it is fairly new and maybe the staff has not been trained in pleasantries  or it is too big and you need more waitresses  so that may be the case.
Chentile G.,Downtown  Las Vegas  NV,0,1,,7/4/2015,5.0,Love this place! They have BJ's Brewhouse Restaurants all over the U.S.  and I have been to a few. I was excited to see that there was a new one opening within minutes from my house. The menu is very extensive  and in the years that I have been going to BJ's  I have never had bad meal. Portion size is good  prices are fair  and the beer selection is great. They actually brew their own beer. The managers are nice and walk around making sure everyone is enjoying their meal  and the staff is friendly. I have been to this location maybe 6 times since it has opened. Some of my favorites are the California club flatbread  shrimp pasta  lemon thyme chicken  chicken wings...I could go on! Oh and you have to try a chocolate chip pazookie that comes with vanilla ice cream! Ask for Amy at the bar. She has a cute Southern accent  and is the best server/bartender that I have ever had. I will be going back to BJ's for sure!
