Pete B.,Long Beach  CA,346,384,1832,10/26/2017,3.0,I don't normally go to restaurant chain but tonight i tried something different.They have a nice variety of entres.  I was tempted to get nightly special which was the rack of ribs. Great value at $18.95 with 2 sides.But when I got wind from the waiter that were only two porkchops left for tonights dinner and that they normally run out early I decided to switch my order and get some pork chops. So glad I did.  The pork chop was extremely juicy and super thick!The sides orders were just okay.The sweet potato fries were slightly undercooked and the Caesar salad had cheddar cheese and avocado which are not two things I normally expect in a a Caesar saladFor an appetizer  we ordered the sampler which included boneless chicken wings  spinach dip  eggrolls  and mozzarella sticksThe mozzarella sticks (5 stars )The eggrolls were soggy (2 stars) The boneless wings had a nice flavor (4 star)The spinach dip was runny and no flavor (1 star) We got the chocolate chip cookie covered in ice cream for dessert. It was a hit (5 stars)
Eva H.,Covina  CA,7,1,,11/30/2017,2.0,It was a night out with a couple of my friends they were already at the table waiting for me. I arrived to the location in hopes of having a good night but i was wrong. First  I came in and the server right away was giving an attitude. He arrived after 10min to our table and he never offered me a menu. He just asked what I would like to drink which i ordered a Sangria (it was pretty good). My friends ordered wings not one of them got utensils  or napkins. We had to go to other table and grab some. He later came and said that they were last call and if we like to add anything to this we ordered a pizzookie(which is always amazing). Me and friends were talking and they told me that since they were seated the server had an attitude and no friendly attitude to be seen. I would not complaint if it was a first time but we go there all the time at least once a week and there has been a trend the server is always rude and not very attentive. At the end of the night one of my friends paid with cash and he even asked if she wanted change. That is not something you ask! Food has always been amazing!
Nom D.,Arlington  VA,0,11,,11/14/2017,2.0,"How does this chain continue to exist? Do adolescent teenage boys patronize the place for in the absurd hope for truth in advertising?I ordered a medium rare sirloin steak  garlic green beans  & Caesar salad. The steak arrived with a 1/8 inch layer of steak salt. Even after scrapping off the salt crust layer the damage had been down. It over powered the very mediocre meat. Considering the ""quality"" of the ""steak"" perhaps exceeding the recommended daily allowance requirement for sodium  by 700%  made the steak more...edible. Enough of that  lets press onto something more easily ruined...I mean prepared.The green beans had not even a hint of garlic or butter but tasted as though someone squeezed lemon juice onto it. Yes  lemon.The Caesar sales tasted so drab  the dressing lacked any flavor & definitely contained no anchovy.  Considering the crowds  reviews  & recommendations I expected a bit more than a bad meal. I recommend you blow off BJ\'s."
Nathasia H.,West Covina  CA,202,54,85,9/24/2017,3.0,Went here today for my birthday dinner. We got there around 8 PM  we got into a waitlist and have to wait for around 10 mins. We finally got seated and our server welcome us very nicely. She's really helpful  friendly  and patient with us. While ordering  i asked which magarita is the porpular one  she said its the peach one but we ended with watermelon  lol and we ordered kids meal which is chicken tender + fries & chocolate milk  sirloin steak  clam chowder in a bowl and hickory briset and bacon burger. After we ordered  waiting for around 15-20 mins  they gave us sets of utensils and when i opened it  my utensils and my mom are really dirty. Have to change it back so I told them  and she apologized for it (not really big deal for me). Second  when we get our sirloin steak with fries and mashed potatoes  the mashed potatoes is really cold!! Third  you know how kids meal  it serves with a drink too? Like i said earlier my bro ordered kids meal with chocolate milk on it. It never came. So i have to ask this server wheres the chocolate milk  and she answered it with a rude attitude which no no no. We've been waiting and she was kinda yelling that they dont have chocolate milk yet no one tell us that we have chocolate milk. Really disappointed  after couple minutes  our server come to our table with vanilla milk and told us that she forgot that they have no chocolate milk. After all  food is alright  service they can do better ! And i got complimetary pizookie for my bday tho even its not as big but we good. Overall  6/10 because of that server gave me an attitude where all i was trying to do is asking where my brother chocolate milk! Thanks for making my bday awesome in this place - -
Brenda M.,La Verne  CA,0,14,5,11/28/2017,1.0,When you pay for service and the waiters hide in the kitchen? What's up with that? The food has gone down hill  had the margarita pizza  how in the world can you mess that up? Food was cold. I felt like the ugly step child that no one want to help! I left a 25% tip  I did so out of obligation. I really wanted to leave zero  but I don't roll that way. Some of the employees just checked in and were like whatever. If I wanted a zombie I would find one. I say try harder and get more of a tip!!!!! Oh well maybe I'll try back in 6 months. Need to find a new restaurant !
Ray G.,Alhambra  CA,562,136,322,8/25/2017,4.0,I been to a hand full of locations  this had been thus far one of the best. The staff is very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Great at recommending and giving good suggestions. The food quality was great. The food came out hot and tasty. The recommended spicy Brussel sprouts was delicious. The deep dish pizza on point like usual. Come to this location because you can never go wrong with great service.
Jose M.,Hayward  CA,65,5,2,11/8/2017,1.0,We sat in one of the tables at the bar (self sitting) and it seem as if it was self-service too because we only saw our server twice. He walked by our table several times  and not once he asked if we were ok or needed anytime else  yet he took the time to talk to someone else who was sitting at the bar. We order a refilled for our drink and it took about 10 minutes to get it (literally)...we even forgot we had asked for it. I finished my meal and moved my empty place to the side of the table and he didn't bother to pick it up until we called him over because we wanted to order some dessert. The overall experience  the service we received from our server was pretty bad to say the least. The only good thing about it was the monkey bread!!
Leonard A.,Los Angeles  CA,719,280,2893,2/20/2017,3.0,After watching a couple of plugs on television I decided to revisit this restaurant slash brew house slash sports bar.And so my journey began hmmm.So of course I had to start off with those famous Pizookies.The salted caramel and macadamia nut are couple of new arrivals to the dessert menu.And just like I remembered the original these party mouth favors blasted my taste buds with sweet salty rich and robust flavors.Man that was definitely the highlight of my evening.Another new arrival that I tried was the Roasted Maple Salmon Tacos.When they brought it out it looked so good but I just had one problem.Apples green apples I may add.The sourness of the apple slices mixed in with thebroccoli slaw definitely did not work for me.It may be good for some people but just not for me.The hostess was nice but the wait time to order took over twenty minutes not cool.But in all fairness it wasn't our servers fault.I think if management had stepped in and helped out it wouldn't of been such a problem.From what I saw they were hanging out in the corners laughing it up like snootiness definitely not cool.At least the pizookies were bomb.Peace
Larry H.,Los Angeles  CA,118,349,32,7/29/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"So we went to BJ\'s to try their new items which have been advertised heavily. Well  all I can say the advertising is much better than the food that you get. Our dinner party was so disappointed. Brewhouse Slow-Roasted Menu needs more QA. The Prime Rib was truly tasteless. No seasoning. The Pork Chop was cooked very well  but again  no seasoning at any level. The ribs tasted like day old re-fired ribs. This is what BJ\'s states \'After a long series of taste tests and tweaks  we have perfected our Brewhouse Slow-Roasted entrees and sandwiches  delivering amazing taste at an affordable price "" said Trojan. ""We spend hours slow-roasting every cut of meat so that our guests can spend every second enjoying it.\'We spent zero seconds enjoying these new items due to a complete lack of seasoning. Now the real mess was the new chicken burgers. One is a regular chicken sandwich and the other has avocado and an egg served on top. Well  these two items need to be reevaluated. The regular chicken sandwich was just plain weird. It was four small parts (lord knows what parts!) of a chicken put in between a bun and served up. It was strange and tasted even stranger. It looked like left over chicken was used to create this chicken burger.Now the real mess was the chicken burger with avocado and an egg on top. First off the presentation was horrible. The egg was off the sandwich and when the waiter tried to put it back on the sandwich it burst and you now had an egg yolk mess in your hands. I literally was grossed out on the mess this sandwich made I could have been in a horror film if someone looked at my hands and the many napkins I needed. The bun instantly disintegrated due to the liquid mess and it became inedible without a fork and knife. Terrible experience.We wrapped it up by trying the new Churro Pizookie. It is a bunch of Churros with some Ice Cream. Not for me as the sugar on all the churros was just too much. Now  adding just a few Churros to a regular Pizzokie would work for me.BJ\'s QA is extremely spotty from location to location and I don\'t get it. You should have the same quality and consistency at each establishment. Also  the service is so different from establishment to establishment. There is no excuse for the QA or the spotty service. For a party of six  we were there close to 4 hours due to the length of time we had to wait for our server  our drinks  our orders in and finally our food. I serious undercover boss is warranted for BJ\'s."
John P.,Covina  CA,1,16,3,12/3/2017,5.0,Came by last night w the fam and had a wonderful experience. Thanks to Genna and Christine.. it was a busy Saturday night as usual at Bj's but that didn't influence our treatment and the wonderful hospitality we were given... Genna was amazing. She was very professional  humorous(not boring)  and also most important  continuously often made her rounds to be sure drinks were full and the food was on point from beginning to end. i can honestly say that all of us were so happy that we have never driven home after dining out and the kids(10 & 11) kept talking about how great their food  dessert  and service was. We will be asking for her regularly now.. you should too. I can assure  you will be in good hands and will not go wrong!!
Jay A.,Walnut  CA,94,21,2,10/29/2017,1.0,Waitress forgot to take my order so my food came in late. Chicken soba noodles barely had any chicken. This was about $15. Not worth it at all. Very disappointing.
Jane R.,Burbank  CA,0,1,,12/3/2017,5.0,I went to this restaurant for the first time today and I had the best experience! My server Alyssa was very friendly and when I asked her for recommendations she was very knowledgeable about the dishes and my food was amazing! Alyssa really went above and beyond to make our first impression of BJs really perfect. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone and also recommend they ask for Alyssa. She really cares about the customer.
Danielle  V.,West Covina  CA,33,18,16,9/26/2017,1.0,So I've been to this location multiple times and had stopped going due to poor service and horrible food. But I recently went with my friend and had the EXACT same experience. We got pizza and half of the pizza had no cheese and was completely black from being burnt. We showed our waitor and he brought us a personal pan to make up for it  which would have be been okay if they didn't serve it to us on a dirty ass plate! Not only that it took 15 min to get our drinks  which were 2 cokes not even alcoholic beverages that would make the wait semi-okay. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone!
Skye S D.,West Covina  CA,77,41,87,9/13/2017,3.0,been here few times & usually order their flatbread pizzas + a wide variety of drinksits a decent place 2 catch sports ~ their waitstaff needs 2b more attentive but da bartenders have been pretty good
Steve C.,Glendora  CA,42,47,55,5/16/2017,2.0,"Myself and 2 kids decided to eat here after a long hot day at the baseball field. My 2 kids were thirsty and ready to eat. We promptly got sat after using the mobile -waitlist function. We sat....and...sat...and waited patiently..and waited some more. After the kids getting restless I noticed about 25 minutes went by and we hadn\'t received anything! No water. Not a hi! hello!...nada. I got up and asked the hostess if we can move some place where we could get service. She looked confused and said she would help. Finally another gal come by - looked like a lead but didn\'t introduce herself and stated they forgot about us. Sigh... Finally took our order and things started moving. Thought that was the worst part - no!.... My kids ordered sliders from the children\'s menu. They came out after the mountain o\' fries and chips/guac. I\'m fixing the sliders for the kids with the condiments and O M G. The burger was charred. Like beyond belief charred. I sent it back right way. 15 minutes later we get it and kids so over the plethora o\' fries...Although we got 50% off our bill. I still shake my head. The last excuse from the manager/lead that stuck in my head... ""Well we cook our burgers well done for kids"" Im like huh? Being a chef myself...These weren\'t well done. They were charcoal. Two not so great experiences form BJ\'s which I normally favor (the first one was at Arcadia  CA)"
Will L.,Los Angeles  CA,15,13,,11/14/2017,1.0,If there was a no star option  I would've loved to give that zero star. Probably the worst experience at BJs ever. My boyfriend and I decided to take out his parents for his dad's birthday. when we first ordered our beverage  we asked the lady who brought our drinks for some lemons  she said ok  Never came back   we then asked our server who apologized and came back with our lemons 30 minutes from the time we asked. Then when our food was ready and presented to our table  our server had to explain to us that one of our dishes got taken from another server to another table    therefore we had to wait for that dish  our server apologized for the confusion    the dish was then delivered to us  after 10 minutes   we then realized that no one gave us utensils before or after our food was delivered.We then started eating  and theny boyfriend realized that the meatball in his spaghetti was really soft and it tasted funny  both his mother and I tried the meatball   when we cut it opened  the meatball was not cooked all the way through    we called the manager over made a complaint  the manager tried to tell us that she will take care of SOME of our foods  but then we insisted that she takes care of the entire bill. The manager took care of the bill and gave us a gift card for the next time back. Overall our server  John was attentive  and very nice and took care of this situation professionally .Never again will we come to this location again!! Worst experience ever!!!!!!
Courtney O.,Kalamazoo  MI,201,2,,11/17/2017,5.0,John was our server and he was ABSOLUTELY awesome!! Thank you John! Food was delicious and beers were great! (:
Josephine Q.,Baldwin Park  CA,60,28,38,8/12/2017,3.0,Late post: My girlfriend and I came on Thursday night. We were told it would take about 10-15 mins before we can be seated or we had the option of sitting in the bar area  so we decided to just sit by the bar. BIG MISTAKE. We waited around 5 mins and no one bothered to approach us to even give us our menus despite seating another couple. So we decided we would rather wait the 10-15 mins to actually receive service. Luckily  we just went up to the host and was seated immediately. I ordered the cherry chipotle glazed salmon and although it tasted good  I don't plan on ordering it again because despite being on a diet  it is too light of a meal for me personally. I felt as if my salmon was slightly smaller than the first time I tried it  but it was so long ago that I honestly don't remember. For the same price  I rather order my fettuccini alfredo and just bring half of it home so I can eat it as leftovers the next day. It comes out to be about the same calories anyway if you only eat half of the fettuccine  although I do understand that it won't be as healthy as the salmon  so there's the dilemma. Anyway  our server was really nice and even gave us a free mini pizookie! We ended up getting the triple chocolate and it was heaven in my mouth. I didn't care for the ice cream because it tasted like regular ice cream  but the warm cookie practically melted in my mouth.
Jose R.,South El Monte  CA,12,9,1,10/5/2017,1.0,So my group went out to have some drinks after work. We did not like the service by the host on Fridays so we went to BJ'S just a walk away.  Our first server was great  perfect timing and being recognizable on our usual and small drinks. Mind you this is a party of three. Sadly after our original server rotated with someone who doesn't know what he is doing made our rating go from 5 stars to two stars explains enough. It's football season I myself don't need a halfway job I need a full measure job. If servers can't do their job with the amount of stress then you should find someone who knows what they are doing once they take over your shift. It's easy to rotate if not then your Manager is responsible for mismanaging
Kameron J.,West Covina  CA,3,1,1,10/2/2017,1.0,What u call churros Didn't come with cinnamon and the cookie wasn't even cooked all the way I'm smh
Salome R.,Inglewood  CA,0,2,3,11/13/2017,5.0,Best experience I have ever had at BJ's. My server was John F.  he was amazing at explaining the different types of dishes. He smiled and listen to what I wanted and went out of his way to make that happen. He is the best server at BJ's and his attention to detail was fantastic.
Richard F.,Glendora  CA,63,105,375,11/14/2016,4.0,"Light snack for last night\'s dinner.""Guacamole Burger w/wedge fries""POGIBALLS rating Burger had a nice big chunk of avocado and the burger was cooked well. Bun was nice and toasted and mixed in with the wedge fries with ranch dipping sauce made for a very good meal. A little on the greasy side but still ok."
Yolanda G.,Covina  CA,4,7,6,10/24/2017,1.0,"1 Star because of service. Why bother offering a service you can\'t provide?! I ordered curbside pick up today. When I arrived there were no available parking spaces  then I called in several times and no one answered the phone. When I walked in I had to wait about 10-15 Minutes before I was even acknowledged. When I was finally acknowledged I asked the server if they were answering the phone today and the sever said  ""did you try calling? Did you order curbside? we can\'t always hear the phone  it\'s loud in here"". Seriously?! No tip for you. Food was good but terrible service and attitude. Management understaffed for a busy day. I use to like this place."
Jairo V.,Corona  CA,0,5,,11/9/2017,2.0,Don't come here when it's packed  love this place when it's not busy. When it is   full is cold and just gets reheated. There spaghetti was cold in the middle and the meatballs were cold also. Sent it backs  the top came out hot and the middle was like warm. Not good at all.
Chona P.,Los Angeles  CA,7,17,3,4/24/2017,5.0,BJ's never failed my expectation. Courteous servers  good food choices. Came here for regular family dinner and left satisfied. Waiter Malik did not lie about the spaghetti meatballs having pork in the ingredients. I don't eat pork and he was kind enough to ask the kitchen if they can substitute  which they did. Their Mediterranean Pizza was also very tasty.BJ's is definitely many bars higher than other restaurants. Excellent food  excellent service.
Michael Z.,Filderstadt  Germany,1,1,1,8/3/2017,5.0,Food was amazing. I got the best ribs ever here. Very Organized. Friendly service by Emy Setiadi. She was very attentive. we will be coming back because of her wonderful service! Thursday ribs special is the best!!
Tasha V.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,263,276,133,4/8/2017,4.0,I am always a fan of BJs brewhouse. The service is usually slightly above average and the food plentiful and tasty. The menu offers a very large selection  which can be overwhelming  yet welcoming. Of course end the meal with a pizookie and you are all set. The atmosphere is loud and has a sports bar vibe  yet the service and food does not hold that statistic. Dine or Dash? Dine. This place is always a safe bet.
William B.,Covina  CA,0,5,2,8/31/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Once again bad service. Salad soup and Main entree arrived together. This place is consistently bad. I eat out a lot. I would never eat at this place only my family likes going here. I've eaten at other BJ's and the service and food is generally very good. BJ Corporation needs to fire the manager. This place is consistently very bad. I wish I could give no stars.ZDJBZqH4
Emy S.,West Covina  CA,238,42,256,7/9/2017,5.0,Yesterday I ordered the party pack for 30 people. From the time I placed the other to the time I received it. All the team member and the management team are very organized. It is such a special day for our DAD. We want to make sure everything will be good. The funeral was at forest lawn. Food was fully organized with labels and the trimmings. Utensils  Plates  napkins and serving utensils. If anyone having a big gatherings Bjs party pack is your best choice. They even bake the pizookie in cookies form. Ommmmggg that was sooo good. My family and I are very grateful and thank the team for taking care my dads funeral. It was a lovely night.
F L.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,103,181,9/13/2017,5.0,BJ's Puente Hills is the bomb. Come during Happy Hour for great drink and food specials. The array of TVs to watch your favorite team is just right. They keep the volume just right  not so loud you can't hear yourself think.The service  is pleasant. The wait staff is knowledgeable and courteous. The food...hey it's BJ's. The selection of food is amazing. The pizzas are phenomenal and the avocado rolls are delicious. Everything else  is all good and very tasty.The non Happy Hour prices are a little more than Fridays and Chilis  BUT  the flavors are definitely more inviting.BEER selection....fantasticSee you at BJ's !!!
Lauren K.,Central LA  Los Angeles  CA,1,4,5,9/4/2017,1.0,*************PLEASE READ*************Bj serves food in big quantities. They're food is pretty decent. But  there is one con that has lead me to give Bj's one star. You have to wait an eternity waiting for it. By the time your food comes out  your children would probably graduate and wait for you. If you are a loner that has plenty of time  this is the perfect place for you. They only serve girls with wet hair that they fixed in the restroom  but will not serve hungry children. Please give us free guac  and I will change the 1 star into a 5.
Anthony T.,Baldwin Park  CA,14,6,,9/27/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Let me start by saying we got there at 10:22 and left 11:55 omg bad food  we ordered prime rib me and my wife  when they took the order we said well done no pinkSo when we got the food both prime rib were bad very bad blood coming out of them I turned my prime rib and it was red on the other side   my wife's prime rib was the same nasty come on guys cooks can't cook that's for sure I said give me something else that u can cook right so I got chicken this time.

Shawna C.,Oxnard  CA,26,5,10,6/23/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I'm only giving one star because yelp makes you do that. I ate here last night I ordered a side salad and to my surprise I got more then just a salad. I was about 4 bites into it and I noticed it tasted a little different I thought maybe the ranch dressing was a little bitter and after mixing the salad around some more I found a dead baby frog. Yes I said FROG! I've never experienced anything in my life like that. I informed the manager and he offered to comp our meal. I said no you can keep the food we are not eating here. He explained that there produce comes from a vendor but don't they wash there vegs before serving? I told him this frog could contain salmonella and who knows how long it's been sitting in a produce bag and he still made us pay for our drinks which consisting of three beers total! I mean really I just found a frog in my food from a place that dosent even carry frog and I still gotta pay for my drinks and take the people I'm with to go eat somewhere else! I spoke with there corporate office who said sorry and sent me a 50.00 gift card what a joke. Please inspect your food from here if you goBjs has responded to my review and thank you. But I'm disappointed that it took over a week to respond even after they had been responding to other reviews that were posted after mine.
Beah R.,City of Industry  CA,294,69,43,6/24/2017,1.0,I've been coming to this BJ's since 2011 and always recommended this branch to family and friends. However  I don't know what happened between now and 6 years ago but quality has certainly gone down. I went here a few nights ago to celebrate with my significant other by grabbing a nice dinner. To begin with  there were no hostess at the front. We waited a good ten minutes to flag someone down to check us in. When we were called to our seats we were greeted by a gentlemen who introduced himself as our server. My boyfriend ordered a burger  and I ordered a medium pizza with 2 cups of ranch. Our appetizer came first and we finished it right away since we didn't eat all day. About fifteen minutes later or so  our pizza and burger is dropped off and my pizza is flat out cold. The crust tasted stale and the cheese wasn't even melting into the dough! I could not find my server anywhere because he literally dropped it off and walked away. I flagged down another server who I made the complaint to and he took my pizza and microwaved it?? I think that's a little gross. If your restaurant was understaffed then organize the tables and settings better so no customers order is left behind. I am not okay with paying like $15 for a cold mediocre pizza I could have gotten cheaper  better  and more fresh at a 7-11. I don't think I'll be visiting this branch again.
Aina I.,Glendora  CA,1,10,,6/24/2017,1.0,I usually have no problems with this BJ's at all  but it was just horrible the last time that I decided to have dinner here. My friends and I came here and we were seated in a reasonable amount of time. We were starving from a tiring day so we were excited to start ordering our food. I found it odd that they did not take our drink orders right away l  but we decided to wait patiently because it was clearly a very busy dinner. After about 25 minutes of waiting we FINALLY got a waiter to take our order  we had to catch the attention of a waiter just walking by. The waiter took our order and said that we would get free dessert  that somewhat made up for it but the wait for our food was ridiculous. A waiter later came up to us an apologized because he apparently forgot that we were part of his section. He was paying more attention to a bigger party of people next to our table. It was the end of our dinner and we then waited another 30 minutes or so for our free desserts. At this point of the night we were there for over 4 hours when we were expecting to be done with dinner in 2. We finally got our desserts and had to wait a little longer for the check just to be give to us. Overall it was a horrible experience  even though we got free desserts it still upset me that a big named business would treat customers like this. Not planning on coming back here again.
Luis C.,La Verne  CA,0,5,,11/5/2017,1.0,I wanted to spend a valuable time for my wife's birthday. I found the worst service of my life. 18 minutes for me to take the order. Waiters and two distracted supervisors who do not know what's going on in their restaurant!!!
Keny T.,Walnut  CA,344,33,4,6/19/2017,2.0,I've had pizzas at BJ's enough to know that this is not normal. Toppings off and the bread looks like it's been baked without the toppings. Where's the tomato sauce? I ordered two large pizzas and the both look like this. It looks like the dough was baked first  toppings added  and baked again. It was quite disappointing and I know the company can do so much better. I usually enjoy the pizzas at BJ's  but this time didn't cut it. Literally  pizza was cut into odd shapes. How's a rectangular slice of pizza sound?
Jessica K.,West Covina  CA,161,17,,6/16/2017,1.0,"This was the worst I\'ve ever been treated at BJ\'s. I\'ve been a faithful customer of BJ\'s throughout my life  going whenever there were celebrations to be had or for reuinions. The food\'s good  the service is usually nice  and there\'s so many BJ\'s around that I can find one pretty quickly.Unfortunately  I will never be coming back to this one again.It was my friend\'s birthday yesterday. I arrived at 7:15 PM. The manager (blonde lady) was kind enough to help me sign in because none of the hostesses were paying me any attention even though I was standing at the counter. We had 7 people  and she promised that it\'ll only take a 30 minute wait.So I went outside  my friends arrived  and 7:45 passed. We wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt because it was busy  so we waited until 8:00  so we went to go check in to make sure I didn\'t realize the text message. The manager was nowhere to be seen  so I went in to check with the hostesses (that blatantly ignored me before :( ) so I asked her  saying that I waited for 45 minutes already  and wondering what was going on. And the girl was like oh! we sat aside a SPECIFIC table for you so we\'re waiting for the people to leave. But you guys are next!  (keep in mind  parties of 10  19  8 were called when we were promised to be next)So we were like oh that\'s fine  and then twenty minutes later (we waited for an HOUR AND FIVE MINUTES) she came back to us and said ""Hi  your table is READY  but...it may be too small to fit all seven of you."" And we\'ve already waited 2x the waittime promised  and we were promised that these hostesses were HOLDING A TABLE FOR US WHICH LENGTHENED OUR WAITING TIME ?????? WE WAITED 2X BECAUSE WE WERE WAITING FOR A SPECIFIC TABLE and then you come to us and say the TABLE CAN\'T FIT US? I don\'t understand  can they not realize you cannot fit seven people in a booth meant for FIVE? When we went to check it out  every party who was sitting in those booths had FOUR or FIVE people.So we said  sorry this table cannot fit us  and they said oh  don\'t worry just wait 20 minutes longer and we\'ll get you a bigger table. 40 minutes later...table was finally ready. We looked at each other  and thought  if their seating was THIS HORRIBLE  how would their waiters be on this night? our night was already ruined  and it was my friend\'s birthday! those hostesses kept giving us attitude and we were almost SURE we were asked to wait 40 minutes for the extra table just because they didn\'t like us. because we had the NERVE to wonder why we weren\'t seated yet when we\'ve already waited one hour and ten minutes. we waited for two hours for a table...but BJ\'s already screwed up on SIMPLY SEATING us so we just left."
Will G.,Brea  CA,42,51,196,6/17/2017,4.0,West Covina...man is it HOT outside!!We waited quite a while to get in to this location - about 35-40 minutes  but  when you show up w a party of 13...you gotta expect a bit of a wait. They really should consider taking reservations for parties over 8! Kelly was our server - and a very good one he was. Super-attentive. Very patient. Always smiled and was polite. Took the beverage order and when he came back for the rest of the order and no one was ready - he said he'd be back in 5 minutes and he was. I order the Super Salad w/ Blackened Shrimp and was told to order the chili. Others in my group had the Clam Chowder; the Peruvian Quinoa Bowl; the Appetizer Sampler Platter; the Lemon Thyme Chicken; and the Rib Eye Steak w White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes. I was not so happy w my choice because I felt the dressing didn't represent properly. It needed more acidity. I did ask for extra lemons and got them rather quickly. Now  I know what you're thinking...if you didn't really like your food - why the 4-Stars? First  I have eaten at many BJ's and have ALWAYS enjoyed the food. This IS a new item and it just wasn't something I would order again. 2nd  dining out is so much more than just about the food - it's about the entire experience. It happens to be that I had someone wMe who had a few dietary challenges. I called Kelly aside before everyone started ordering and explained that to him. He was very careful to take in everything I was saying and placed the order exactly as I requested. That may not sound like much to most people but the fact that he practically stopped everything to listen carefully when I was ordering something NOT ON THE MENU was so very appreciated. I also had the Bowl of Chili which had a nice heat to it. Of course I like MORE heat but  the flavor was so on point it reminded of canned chili but done up! Sounds weird I know. It was tasty. I tried my friends White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes and was pleasantly surprised. I can instantly taste the white Cheddar and spices. I recommend you get some with any entree  sandwich or salad you order or simply order as a side dish. Yup THAT good.If you like beer...DUH! The beer is served ICE COLD! I had the Heff on tap! The Rib Eye was cooked perfectly! The Clam Chowder was tasty and had a lot of clams.When you get a waiter that hovers and you notice it - it's annoying. But  when you get one that hovers and you only know he's been there because your glass is filled and no one wants for anything - he's good at what he does! And as such he should be appreciated and tipped. When he brought the check - the table applauded him. He was so embarrassed. When I tipped him a hefty amount on a check for 13 people - he blushed. As I left the restaurant  I asked to see the manager and shared the experience we had w Kelly. He was also happy to hear this. The reason I did this is because we have a tendency to make our bad experiences known but don't share the good ones. I like to share ALL my experiences - good  bad or indifferent - because it helps the establishment and recognizes those who should be. So...get your grub on!!!Stop by a BJ's - and enjoy! Share your experience and tip appropriately. Tell them Chef Will sent you!!
Aurora W.,Alhambra  CA,621,263,1498,6/4/2016,3.0,Happy hour with the coworkers! Totally needed on a Friday after work. :)I believe their happy hour begins around 3-4pm and ends around 7pm? Pretty basic formula for prices  $1 off drinks (wine/beer/mixed drinks)  $2 off appetizers  and 1/2 off pizzas (mini included). Their food is decent. I got their mini Mediterranean pizza and while the toppings were good (chicken/cheese/olives/ pepporchinis)  their crust was definitely SOFT. I like my crust crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside  like most deep dish pizzas are. I remember BJ's pizza to have that amazing crust  but unfortunately it didn't happen this time around. My coworker had the same issue with his mini pizza. Not sure if they were both slightly undercooked?Drinks were decent. They have a wide variety for relatively reasonable prices  since it only cost about $5-6 for a beer or glass of wine. Service left much to be desired  though. My coworker said that he was sitting there for about 20 minutes alone before anyone even acknowledged him. Definitely needs improvement in this area.
Chel R.,Hacienda Heights  CA,10,700,4395,11/28/2016,3.0,#85 Review for the 2016 Yelp 100 Challenge I typically don't like to boast my Yelp Elite status to non Yelpers. Somehow they will eventually find out on their own. Only then will I show 'em some Yelp Elite Pride! Hahaha. Tonight  Mr GM decided to take me here for dinner on date night. Was he trying to send me a message deciding on this establishment? Well rest assure  it was definitely lost in translation! HahahaIt was such a busy Tuesday night on Thanksgiving week. Needless to say  it was super loud and very difficult to hear each other. Then I thought  he did this on purpose so he could sit hip to hip with me in our booth.  Which we did. Besides  there was no way to hear each other had we stayed across from one another. And yes  I know it's a bar with multiple flat screens...as with any other BJs  like the one I frequent at City of industry merely for drinks.Anyway  on to the review...The BAD-Not date-friendly atmosphere. Great with if I was with friends who wouldn't mind almost screaming to have a conversation.. the aesthetics were just horrible!Service  although courteous  was extremely slow AF!  Slow to get our drink and food orders. About 30 minutes. That's just to order. There were more irritating delays-I ordered a glass of Cab. He originally ordered a Moscow mule  although not on the menu  our server said they will do it for him. Only to return 20 minutes later to say they ran out of ginger beer. So he decided on pia cold which he couldn't even drink because the sweetness took over the entire drink. I honestly thought it was a virgin drink. So then he decided on a glass of Merlot. Took another 30 minutes for that. SmH. The GOOD-We ordered and shared  their seasoned rare tuna salad and spinach artichoke dip. The seasoned  seared rare ahi tuna came fully dressed with greens and red bell peppers tossed with rice wine vinaigrette  served with avocado  tomatoes  cucumber  wasabi for a kick  and strips of wonton and scallions.  3/5 stars.Their spinach and artichoke dip bumped this review to a solid 3 stars! It was absolutely delish IMO. Rich and creamy with good chunks of artichokes and spinach with the right amount of flavoring & consistency  topped with parmesean cheese made for a great dip with tortilla chips! 5/5 stars!I'd definitely return for this dip alone!!!Cheers!#thankful#always#GM
Belkis Z.,Covina  CA,7,3,2,8/21/2017,2.0,We were quite disappointed yesterday  it took over 25 minutes from the time we ordered our drinks to get our appetizer. When our entres finally arrived the baked ziti was cold and it came with no bread. An Italian meal with no bread!!!We had to wait an additional 5- 7 minutes for the bread to arrive. The waitress we had was very nice and apologetic but the kitchen needs help  there is no excuse for a cold meal.
Stephanie A.,West Covina  CA,8,6,,7/30/2017,2.0,This past year  the place has really been going downhill. Service has gone way down and so has their food quality. Last night was no different when my friends and I came in for our friend's birthday. The birthday girl's pasta was lukewarm  and had the same quality of a TV dinner. A side to my entree was missing  and it never came out. A soda was ordered and our server forgot about it. 15 minutes later we requested the soda we never received. It finally came and was flat and warm as if it had been sitting out for awhile. Lastly  we decided to share the churro pizookie -- there was a mini corndog covered in cinnamon sugar mixed with the churros. Accidents happen  but when combined with the previous incidents it just grew into a frustrating evening. It should have been a fun birthday dinner  but instead we ended up with lackluster service and subpar food.
Sarah G.,Dallas  TX,0,9,,10/24/2017,2.0,While the food is decent  the service is honestly terrible. I'm a big fan of BJ's but this location is not managed well. They have also made mistakes on my food several times. I have celebrated many of my birthdays as well as my friend's birthdays there  and they continually disappoint. You're definitely better of going to one of the nearby restaurants if you want good service and if you want your food to be prepared how you like it.
Gabby A.,Baldwin Park  CA,0,17,,10/16/2017,1.0,Nasty never again will I go there I went for lunch with my friend and I got a dirty spoon ughhhhhh disgusting!!!!! Grossed out just to think about it neverrrrrrr again will I go to any bjs in my life or I would never recommender it to nobody!!!! Wash ur dishes!!!! Nasty place!!!
Jennifer F.,Westmont  Pomona  CA,129,13,1,10/21/2017,4.0,Excellent service; servers (Matthew in particular) were attentive and conversational. Food here is usually amazing but this time  when i ordered the alfredo pasta with broccoli  the broccoli was undercooked and bitter. As always  the pizookie is delicious and will definitely come back as long as food is fully cooked next time.
Cristina Q.,Azusa  CA,0,4,2,10/11/2017,1.0,"WOOOOOOOOW! That was literally my expression when I left this facility 2 nights ago. To start off not only did our service suck the excuses sucked even more! My friend & I ordered 2 appetizers 10 minutes later we ordered a pizza. I noticed the appetizers were taking long(the guy next to us was halfway through his food & we ordered at the same time) but I gave them the benefit of the doubt since it was a busy sports day. Nevertheless our pizza came out after our appetizers & at that point I was irritated. The bartender fetched our appetizers in less than a minute & said ""sorry people back their are lazy"" no shit they were just sitting on the counter. To top it off you could clearly tell they forgot to add 1 of our toppings & just threw it on top of the pizza. Regardless I kept my cool. As we finished our last drink I noticed something in front of me on the counter moving & I couldn\'t believe my eyes when I looked down. It was a BIG FAT COCKROACH!!!!!! The manager did not even have the audacity to look at us or say sorry all he did was take care of 1 of our appetizers & 2 drinks. A sorry would\'ve been nice but coming from the same place that had frog legs in their salad goes to show how unsanitary this place is!!!! They should shut it down!!!!!!!!!!"
Shae L.,West Covina  CA,14,4,2,9/11/2017,1.0,We went to bjs and ordered pizza to go and as we were waiting we saw a rat run out of the kitchen!!!!! We canceled. Don't go there!!!
Bethany P.,Denver  CO,0,2,,8/4/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,So. I'm giving a couple of stars up because1) Everything that went wrong before was fixed and...2) The GM actually responded with sincerity and wanted to make sure that our experience was as good as it could be.I hope you guys continue to improve and provide good customer service. Thank you for listening and trying to be better. I understand working in customer service and it isn't easy. Keep on keeping on!
Julie M.,El Monte  CA,76,8,3,7/20/2017,1.0,Went to this BJ's with a big group of coworkers and the service sucked. Our waitress took FOREVER to bring our drinks and food  as well as to refill my tables drinks. She was not polite whatsoever and she rudely rung all of us up. They also brought one of my coworker's food with onions  when he specifically asked with no onions because he's severely allergic to them. The waitress tried to deny that the dish had any onions in it and when my coworker wouldn't stop insisting that it did  she called over one of the other waitresses to check it out and seemed all annoyed. When that wouldn't have happen if they got the order right the first time. Plus our waitress recommended the churro pizookie as one of the best ones  when in reality it was complete shit. It was just a stack of churros with ice cream but the churros seemed to have been cooked earlier during the day  so they weren't that fresh. I was very disappointed with the whole service and restaurant. PLUS 3 of my coworkers got food poisoning from this specific restaurant. So none of us are EVER going back. Please don't go here!!
Brandon R.,Burbank  CA,0,2,,10/3/2017,5.0,This food was probably some of the best food I've ever had it was delicious I got the fried chicken with mashed potatoes white cheddar cheese and corn and it was to die for. I also had their hard root beer with Jameson and Bailey's and it was so so so good. For the flavor of the chicken was very Savory and moist. I highly recommend this place to other people the staff is kind and courteous  and Emy was the greatest waitress I have ever had 10/10 would recommend this this to a friend
Maria D.,Westmont  Pomona  CA,0,1,,11/30/2017,2.0,My friends and I usually stop by after works twice a week. The past four times we've gone  our waiters have been rude. I understand that they're perhaps understaffed and can't attend us as fast as possible but that's not even the problem that we've come across. The waiters just have no consideration for their customers and anytime we ask for something they take forever to bring it to us  whether it be water  ranch or ketchup. This past Monday we arrived at 11 pm and there was no one at the front desk to sit us down  waiters passed by and they all looked at us and didn't say a word. We stood for 15 minutes and no one helped us out. We sat ourselves down at the bar area and our waiter was a big tall white man with a beard  made no eye contact with us and seem aggravated. We switched from a booth to a table and he seemed mad because we did that  our food finally came out and we realized we had no utensils on our table  we had to steal utensils from a table further away from ours because our waiter never came near us for us to ask. We usually leave tips but this night we decided that enough was enough. There's another short guy with short black hair that works the bar area as well  he wouldn't know what hospitality was if it hit him on the face. Other than that  the food is good. It takes time to arrive but we usually don't mind. On one occasion they didn't bring out our plate of wings  20 mins after our waitress came by and said there was an issue with the system and the order never reached the kitchen  at this point we were annoyed and asked her to not bring it out anymore. I hope this place retrains their staff or hires better staff. I love the food but that alone doesn't cut it if the staff is rude.
Julie P.,Pasadena  CA,1293,246,960,10/25/2016,4.0,This place is inside a plaza with bunch of business. It has lots of free and available parking. It was a busy day but service was fairly quick. The place is set up like a bar. It was noisy with lots of sports on TV. It didn't bother me but if you are looking for a place to hang out and talk. It might not work for you.I got to order the Fresh Atlantic Salmon which is seasoned well with plater of rice pilaf and vegetables. There other speciality is the New Orleans Jambalya with blackend chicken breast  sausage with bell peppers in a spicy sauce (so tasty). We finish it off with their famous pizookie  which is their freshly baked  hot from the oven delicious cookie topped with scoops of ice creams. It was beyond imaginable.
Tonatiuh M.,Chandler  AZ,41,1,,8/29/2017,5.0,I went to Los Angeles to visit my father  and we went to bj's for a beer. The Bartender Sarah was so nice. Helped us decide on beers  my father doesn't really drink the Ale beers. But  she recommended the Blonde ale because he likes to drink bud light and wanted to try something new. I love that beer. The service was excellent  will definitely be back to this location. Thanks Sarah! And the rest of the Bj's staff. :)
Nicole P.,La Puente  CA,5,61,25,4/10/2017,1.0,I am 8 months pregnant and all I wanted was a steak and baked potato last night. We opted not to go to a bigger steak restaurant because it was 6PM on a Sunday night and we didn't have reservations. We were sat within 5 minutes and waited 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us. Just as we were going to leave our waitress came and took our drink orders. We were ready to actually order then too. Our side salads and appetizer came out. Still no drinks. (Just two waters and a beer for my husband.) Our waitress apologized that they have drink runners and that's why our drinks were taking long. Even the guy that brought us our appetizer said he couldn't bring us our drinks and explained to us all about the drink runners. Thanks but no thanks. Our waitress went and grabbed our waters and our food came. My baked potato was cold... like from the fridge cold. The cold butter made it worse. My steak was way undercooked. We left without eating and will not be returning.
Monica G.,Glendora  CA,0,2,,11/14/2017,5.0,Danielle was probably the best service I will ever have. Not one negative thought crossed my mind while we waited for our food and as we were eating. That girl deserves a freaking raise!!! Bust experience I have ever had here.
Adriana A.,Monrovia  CA,32,11,3,4/16/2017,5.0,"The wait was longer than expected. The host was not very pleasant but after management took over the waiting situation and we got the waiter named Steven  our experience changed completely. The food was great and the service that Steven provided was superb. He was attentive  fast  and humorous. Thanks to Steve  ""the medium tanned waiter"" per his words lol  he made our Easter dinner pleasurable!!!"
Brandon B.,La Habra  CA,0,5,4,3/16/2017,1.0,So I've been to plenty BJ's in my lifetime and this one by far has been the worst. For starters it took them an hour for our food to come out and once it arrived it was all incorrect I order the Broccoli cheddar soup with the bread bowl and I got the soup but no bread bowl. And I asked them where the bread bowel was and they responded with they will bring it out in a second and I had to repeat it 3 servers until they finials brought it out the correct order. And than the bathrooms were the dirtiest bathroom ever. If there was an award for how filthy a restroom can be  hands down this place will be the winner. The public parks in east la or even Compton are way cleaner compared to these restrooms.
Corrine M.,Covina  CA,9,4,6,9/12/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Changing From 1 to 3 stars and giving Kudos to manager Krysteen for reaching out to me to talk about my experience in an effort to retain my business and figure out how to better serve customers in the future. Thank you! It was getting late so I ordered via their online service to pick up curbside. I figured it would be pretty quick. I ordered at 7:24 and it said my order would be ready at 7:45. I got there at 7:48. An employee came out to the car next to mine and did her transaction first. That was fine since she was there before me. She then asked me my name and brought out my bill and took my credit card. She came back and I signed but she was still not done with the other customer. After several trips back and forth she finally offered me a free drink for my wait. By this time it had been about half an hour. She was very nice and apologetic  but when she finally brought out the first part of my order it was 8:25. 40 minutes past the time I was given in their confirmation email. She offered me two free drinks to compensate for the long wait.  I don't mind waiting a few extra minutes  but 40?! How ridiculous!
Yvonne H.,La Puente  CA,15,2,,9/29/2017,1.0,We were waiting over an hour to be seated. They were serving pizza outside while the people were waiting. They kept serving everyone who barely came and kept skipping us. Until my dad complained to her.
Kenny K.,Fontana  CA,102,17,29,9/19/2017,1.0,Went for dinner with the girlfriend  and what was suppose to be a easy and typical dinner  was turned upside down. I had ordered my entree  and her just a broccoli cheese soup. Our appetizer and my entree came out on a timely manner  however our soup was taking an eternity. Half way through my dish and our appetizer finished we had asked our server to check on our soup  he said sure and went his way without returning. We pinned him down and asked can you please see what had happened to our soup a second time. He comes back and just tells us he has no idea why it takes this long and goes away. At this point I'm done with my meal and our appetizer and my girlfriends stomach empty. We pin him down once more to just cancel the damn soup  he says let me go back there once again. He brings two out and says you can take the other since it took awhile. We were so irritated with his serving skills  if he has no idea where our soup is then who does? A simple sorry would've sufficed. But not once did we receive an apology just an extra soup 1 hour later  which we don't even want at this point. Management needs to do something about their server training procedures at this particular location.
Daniel L.,West Covina  CA,6,4,,2/6/2017,1.0,"My buddy turned 21 today. As of 2017  everyone that turns 21 from now on their ID expires on their 21st birthday. So when the server got to our table he threw the coaster down and asked for our order. When he asked for my friends ID he gave it to him and I told him we were celebrating his 21st birthday.He looked at it a few different times and said it\'s expired I can\'t serve you. I replied with that fact that he\'s 21 and has already submitted the form to request his new ID and he replied with ""It doesn\'t matter I can\'t serve you""So I asked for the manager to simply ask if there\'s any other form of ID that he can show or anything else we can do and she came over and would not let me complete a sentence without interrupting me with ""but it\'s expired we can\'t serve you""I realize it\'s expired  I was trying to see if there\'s anything else we can do but she would not let me get a word in and eventually ended up walking away while arguing with me.Overall  externally unprofessional and a terrible experience.I won\'t be going back to the bar again anytime soon and I recommend not requesting the manager unless you want to try and talk to a brick wall..."
Nathan Q.,Fontana  CA,0,6,4,4/5/2017,2.0,The food tastes horrible. Service was bad. Overall experience was wretched. My food tasted very bland and under cooked and my order was the worst and kept coming out wrong. PS my friend Adam said it was horrible too and she tricked us into getting salads we thought it was included but we were wrong
Donna C.,Los Angeles  CA,228,417,505,8/11/2016,5.0,I typically frequent the City of Industry location so compared to that one  the West Covina one is SO MUCH BIGGER and at my last visit  the staff are way cooler. They're upbeat  fun  and super duper attentive. Right now  BJ's is having their Brewhouse specials:Mon: 1/2 off large deep dish or tavern-cut pizzaTue: 1/2 off wine (glass or if you'd like to go big - bottles too!)Wed: $4 BJ's BeersThu: Baby back rib special!!! $13.95 for 1/2 rack or $18.95 full rack. Don't be silly here  def get the full!!! Comes with a house salad  2 sides  and mini pizookie. I went on a Thursday of course. Since these specials started  I've been to BJ's 3 times for the Thu special. It's a REALLY good deal because regularly  the 1/2 rack is about $18 and you don't get that extra salad or pizookie so it's a REALLY good idea to take advantage and the ribs are so omaagghh delicious. I also like their BJ's favorite pizza - you really can't go wrong with that. I'm also a big fan of wings and I've ordered their bone-in wings each time I came for the rib special as an app and after 3 times (I was in doubt I guess)  I can say that I don't think I really like them. I really can't pinpoint why. So anyway  get your butts out here for their specials. They're REALLY good deals!!
Adam B.,Chino  CA,16,105,84,10/16/2016,4.0,This place is cool. It has one of the largest dinning rooms I have ever seen in a chain resturant. The food is good. I recommend the ribs. Not the best in the world  but they are good. Here's a tip. If you are in the mood to go back to prison. STOP and don't commit that crime. Just go to BJ'S and order the ham and cheese. They serve it prison style on a tray. Make sure to ask for plastic utincels first.
Zoan E.,Miramar  San Diego  CA,16,47,55,8/22/2017,4.0,Our server was personable  attentive and engaging. Our drinks came quickly and our appetizer followed soon after. Our food was well prepared  delightfully presented and enjoyed by the entire party. No complaints at all.
Joseph L.,Los Angeles  CA,426,233,659,10/20/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,I come to a lot of BJ's pretty frequently but none comes close to the service I always get at the one in West Covina.If you're here and you're lucky enough to have Frank as your server you're in luck. Honestly the guy is talented enough to work at a high end restaurant if he wanted to. He gets customer service to the dot. Their food is always good at this location as well.If you haven't had the best luck at other BJ's give this one and Frank a shot. Not sure why this place gets such low reviews. It's great food for the value.Sign up for the mobile rewards app  BOGO coupons are pretty frequent as well.
Deborah Y.,Covina  CA,164,12,5,1/11/2017,1.0,"Not pleased at all. Especially with my most recent visit.Because this BJ\'s is so close to home  I\'ve been here several times. Typically there was nothing special about the place  but also nothing really to complain about  so I never bothered to leave a review until now.My mom and I were a bit hungry  so we went to eat lunch at BJ\'s around 3/4. There weren\'t very many people at the time  aside from the bar area that held it\'s usual beer-drinking football-watchers. There was the occasional loud cheer or angry grumble  but my mother and I didn\'t care too much.Even though the dining areas were close to empty  we were asked to wait about five to ten minutes. We weren\'t in a hurry  so we didn\'t care too much about this either.When they did come to seat us  they placed us in the back of the restaurant  far from the football watchers  which was considerate. But didn\'t really do much to lower the volume of their cheers with us still being in the same large room.We sat down  and I was quick to notice two other families in the same area. One which were nearing the end of their meal  and the other had recently sat down as well  but had drinks in front of them. We were informed that a waiter would be with us shortly  and low and behold- no one came.5 minutes passed  then 10  then 15. Multiple times we tried to flag down a waiter  only to either go unnoticed or ignored. The only employee who seemed to walk by our section was a busboy who seemed very intent on cleaning the same ""recently vacated"" table. We tried to flag him down as well  but to no avail.In the end  about 15 minutes had passed with no one coming by to even ask us for our drink orders. My mother and I decided we didn\'t need to waste our time there anymore.Needless to say  we won\'t be coming back."
Ginni K.,Alhambra  CA,1,12,2,9/10/2017,1.0,Won't b coming back here.. this is the only BJ's that has the worst customer service that I have gone to in the last 15 years. We sat down but my son was acting up so I asked them to just put my order to go    but they decided to bring my order in plates one by one and then gave me boxes and told me to pack it myself... there was soup in bread bowl  Brussels sprouts   mushroom appetizers avocado rolls  and when we asked the waiter how do I pack this bread bowl? And he goes aaaaammmm ummmm.. so do u still want it?? And then there was no sauce for Brussels sprouts  I had to walk to the kitchen to ask for it. Avoid this particular Bjs.
JC D.,Glendora  CA,28,53,46,2/12/2017,1.0,Behaviornof the receptionist should not be tolerated ....she was rude and behavior is very un professionalNobody on the pick up area and she directed me and address me as over there ....her name is MaryShe should not be in that position....
Steven P.,San Jacinto  CA,1,11,1,5/22/2017,5.0,Reuben displayed qualities of a veteran server. He was attentive but not overwhelming. Reuben was sure to make a personal connection with each of his other tables.
Ty E.,West Covina  CA,36,9,,8/28/2017,2.0,My experience was not good at all  to much to share  cold rib eye  dry potato with nothing on it or on the side  totally dry asparagus. Had to wait for ever for everything else including a beer and other drinks and to top it off horrible service over all  waiters get cocky  etc. If you have to complain and ask more than 3 times for something it's not fun anymore.Bj's is not what it used be a few years ago not only the West Covina location but I had the same experience at Montebello location quality of food and service is very low.
Joanna P.,Irwindale  CA,0,13,1,10/27/2017,1.0,THINK TWICE BEFORE GOING TO BJ'S WEST COVINA!!!! Man! I keep giving this place a chance and it doesn't ever get better. West covina BJ'S has the worst service ever. Waited 45 minutes for our dessert we ordered and for 40 minutes we're ignored. I enjoy BJ's food but definitely not their service. From now on I will visit any other BJ's besides west covina.
Ryan H.,Torrance  CA,4,44,3,6/17/2017,1.0,This BJ's is terrible  and lacks a good manager. My child slipped on the bathroom floor because there was a ton of water on it. Toilets were a mess  trash cans overflowing. When I brought it to managements attention it still didn't get done  and he said he'd stop by to check on the kid  and nothing.
Christy K.,West Covina  CA,115,18,17,6/15/2017,1.0,They estimated 30min wait for 7 people... We ended up waiting 1 hr hearing groups of 19  10  and etc head in before us. When we asked how much longer  they kept saying we're next. But other larger groups went. When they finally gave us a seat at a booth that fit only 5.....they made us wait an additional 20mins for a bigger table. But the hostess told us multiple times that she set aside a specific table for us that's why the wait was 2x the wait. But the table couldn't fit seven....The wait was 1.5 hours..... This is not how you treat customers... Not worth waiting for overpriced food...
Magdi S.,Rowland Heights  CA,54,3,,12/27/2016,1.0,I really don't want even to give them 1 star. I walked in to the bar area  it wasn't clean all the tables have left overs on it. Even all the people walking were lost and don't know where to sit because of the dirty tables. I spoke to the manger Stacey  she was like what I can do!!!!!We are short handed....sorry!!!!!!Very bad service and bad handling from the manager too.
Paul P.,West Covina  CA,29,22,19,8/4/2017,2.0,Me and my homie  Came here and leaped outtah here cuz the waitress was not attentive. 17 mins to order a drink....26 mins to order food?! And she didn't ask if we needed refills or offer dinner.. Just gave us the check..
Lauren C.,West Covina  CA,135,11,1,6/25/2017,1.0,My pizza barley had any cheese and my Brussels sprouts were burnt. Fire the cook please!
Victor S.,San Bernardino  CA,54,5,,8/27/2017,5.0,&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& Fish and chips all day!! Best dish they have in my opinion. The brews are always on point. Even if they stopped brewing them inside (don't let them fool you )
Kristin M.,Riverside  CA,26,23,7,1/28/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,Today 1/27/17 I utilized curbside to go at the West Covina BJ's location. I have a few complaints regarding my visit.1. When I arrived I called the curbside to go number as prompted in the email instructions. No one answered. I had to google and call the store number to get an answer. My order didn't come out until 12 minutes later. I was a couple minutes late to work due to no one answering the phone and the order taking so long to be brought to me. 2. I ordered a lunch size pizza with pepperoni. There were sections of cheese missing on the pizza and there were no tomatoes on the pizza. The receipt emailed to me quoted me $7.25 for my lunch special and I was charged $8.25 at the restaurant. I had already pulled off when I noticed and since I was pressed for time I couldn't turn around. 3. I ordered a regular strawberry Lemonade for. $3.25. I received a my drink in a child's cup. I didn't order a child's lemonade. I didn't have enough time to complain  because I needed to get to to work. That contacted me and rectified the situation. They comped me a free lunch. I will re update after my next experience.
Carl C.,San Francisco  CA,0,29,9,4/16/2017,3.0,"BJs seems to be the place to be! A very large restaurant with an even larger menu to match! There always seems to be a line at this place no matter what day of the week or time of the night! With a huge variety of drinks and food items  I can understand the huge draw to a place like this. Service was great on the two nights we came to eat when it came to ordering. But when it came to receiving what we ordered  it always took what felt like just 5 minutes too long. Every round of drinks and every meal that was brought out created an uncomfortable feeling of ""are we going to get what we ordered soon"" type of feeling. It\'s too bad that BJs will get this reputation  but it seems to be par for the course as it happened on two separate occasions with different servers at different times of day. Food drinks 4/5. Service 2/5"
Manuel A.,Alhambra  CA,2,10,4,4/15/2017,5.0,Thank you Vivian for helping us out   youre guest service is spectacular ! Many people need to pearn on how to be the same way   thanks management for hiring someone outgoing like Vivian
Gwen L.,Pomona  CA,0,1,,8/9/2017,1.0,The service was great but I wish the food was as good as the service. We order a pizookie and it was hard as rocks and burnt from the bottom. We ask the sever to bring us a new once since the one she gave us was burn. She comes back later and brings us a new one. Turns out that the new pizookie was just as hard as the previous one.
Lisa K.,Baldwin Park  CA,5,11,14,6/10/2017,2.0,This review is on reservations only: Called mid week to make a reservation  spoke to the scheduler and was assured that we had a set reservation for 1pm on Saturday. Came in today Saturday at 1pm and no reservation under my name. Had my whole family here waiting and still currently waiting...this is inexcusable. Can't have 20 people driving around looking for a new place to eat but so wish we could. Training needs to be better and I hope that whoever this guy who answered there phone at 11:50am on June 8th is let go or seriously retrained. Don't want to here how sorry you are. Actions speak louder than words.
Solomon K.,Los Angeles  CA,23,10,,3/20/2017,1.0,SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DONT COME HERE. So this is my first time at BJs. Chose this place over yard house. Biggest mistake I've made in my life. Servers aren't chill. There's a reason why it's so low ratings
Dee R.,Bellflower  CA,27,70,68,1/29/2017,4.0,Great portions  tasty food!! Busy Saturday night! But managed to get seated within 35 minutes.. took a good while to get our appetizers and food but waiter was polite and attentive to our drinks..
Darian K.,Whittier  CA,0,1,,10/22/2017,5.0,Nia was awesome and very friendly. I highly recommend asking for her section and I promise she will take care of you.
Allison F.,Chino Hills  CA,55,13,,2/16/2017,5.0,"There are several reasons for my 5 star rating. First  my family eats here a lot and have found both the food and service to be consistently high quality. On one occasion when I mentioned that the asparagus was tough  the server got a manager who came and spoke to me. This turned out to be positive experience. I honestly felt like the manager appreciated receiving my feedback. I tried the Roasted Shrimp Peruvian Quinoa Bowl this week and it was awesome! It\'s on the Enlightened Menu so it\'s a healthier choice. You can also get this entree with chicken  salmon or vegetarian. There was a lot of shrimp in this dish making it my new favorite!Another of my favorite entrees is the North Beach Mahi & Shrimp. The fish and shrimp always taste fresh and are cooked perfectly. It\'s also on the Enlightened Menu. One evening  I wanted a beer  but wasn\'t sure what to order. Our server  Nick  blew me away when I asked him for a recommendation. He actually ""paired"" my beer (like is done with wine) based on my tastes and meal. We were impressed. Here\'s an important tip when dining at any BJ\'s. I strongly encourage you to download and use their smartphone app. You get a free Pazooki just for downloading & using the app. Use the Preferred Waitlist function to minimize wait times. You can pay your bill  order ahead for dine-in or take-out  and you get reward points based on the amount you spend. We earn free meals on a regular basis."
Ernie F.,West Covina  CA,6,23,1,11/6/2016,2.0,I know why this place has 3 stars... The service is poop. Plain and simple. I think it would've helped if our 12 year old waiter did his job instead of catering to The Real Housewives of La Puente while they were trying to chow him down. My opinion. NO BUENO!
Gabriella R.,El Monte  CA,17,3,1,11/3/2016,1.0,Service was horrible. The severs took an hour to take our order and skipped some of our party when taking orders. The only time we saw our severs was when our food was delivered and to give us our check. We ordered pizookie and after 40 minutes after we finished our meal  we did not receive them. Many of us had to leave due to prior commitments so we never got them. We saw many of the staff just standing around talking to each other and not paying attention to the cuThe only good thing about the trip was the great food and drinks. Great beer selections This was my third or fourth time at this location and I've only had good service once. I'd recommend going to the Montebello or Monrovia location.
Kenny N.,Rosemead  CA,224,55,5,12/3/2016,4.0,"I\'d say more between of a 3.5-4 star  but I like BJ\'s...but here\'s my experience here:Obviously in many American restaurants they are ""slow"" in serving but accommodating. I ordered a BJ\'s Steak Rib Eye and my sister ordered a babyback rib and both our orders suspiciously took almost half an hour to get them served. Just when I was about to call on my server to ask why it\'s taking so long  the dishes arrived and that my server apologized and also brought her manager to come and speak to us.The manager named ""Louis"" was courteous and very accommodating. He apologized to us for the long delay as they were very busy  especially on a Saturday afternoon  and that they do their best to help make our food perfect. Needless to say  very classy of him to do that for us. If this happened in your typical Asian restaurants  an initiation of apology or any kind of conversations are very less likely to happen. He brought me a ketchup and barbeque sauce at the same time. Good service on their end.Food:My steak was perfect as promised. Medium-rare and sizzling  man it was tasty. My two sides were mashed potatoes and seasonal fries  bomb.We ordered the pizookie after and that came out kinda quick! It was yummy. My favorite part of many feasting meals are probably the desserts haha.When we got the bill  we gave them a 100 and waited for our change. The server came back with it and gave us an extra dollar instead of coin change. Pretty courteous of them. I just wished they could\'ve sped things up a little bit or add some extra chefs in the kitchen."
Charles W.,Corona  CA,0,2,,11/20/2017,5.0,this bjs was very friendly and with quick service. i ordered take out and one of the lady's michelle was very nice. will definitely be going back
R T.,Glendora  CA,4,249,42,2/17/2017,4.0,The place is fun. It is bright  busy and bustling. The food is good and the ambiance is fun. The best is the piezooki. I love it and sometime go just to get a piezooki. It is a great place to meet people and it is close to the freeway and has easy access.
Tiff P.,Covina  CA,51,15,8,7/6/2017,5.0,Stacey B was a great server! She was very helpful in our decision making for food and very nice. I got the fire roasted barbacoa chicken (from the enlightened menu) and my hubby got the new crispy chicken sandwich. Both were very tasty. Thanks Stacey for the great service :)
NikkiSweet T.,West Covina  CA,9,3,1,5/5/2017,1.0,everytime i come to this one we always have horrible service. i seriously need to stop coming to this one. been waiting about 15 minutes for marinara sauce. The tall waiter with a beard and comb over completely ignored us. The couple that was sitting right next was helped by him  he brought them water  refills  picked up their plates and brought their check. But never once wasted if we needed anything. Roger was such a huge help. He picked up the other waiter slack. Thank you roger.
Elisha H.,Colorado Springs  CO,213,8,1,7/31/2017,5.0,Highly recommend Great food happy atmosphere very clean place and the service was amazing thanks to Felicia.
SA L.,Addison  IL,0,3,,5/16/2017,1.0,If I could give negative  I will !! 1/5 is not enough to describe how unsatisfied I am to this place.If you look at most bad reviews regarding this place  it is generally geared towards the quality of the service. This place is packed and busy when I arrived. I did not mind the long wait  but server did not tell me that they will text the phone number that I gave them when it's my turn. So I never pay attention to the text and been waited so long that I noticed some other people ahead of me got seated. They should have told everyone that's how they will get notified of if its their turn. After we got seated and handed the menu  we just asked to get water. Like most people  we waited  and waited  and waited  for 10  15 minutes. No one comes. We were left unattended  ignored  while we see others who came after us and seated  were served with drinks already. This is unacceptable. The whole experience is just terrible. We decided it is not worth the wait time for this kind of service  and just left. We will NEVER come back to this place! People  just look at the bad review from this place--you will see common complaints  which are obviously not being addressed by the restaurant at all. I do understand at rush hours the restaurant might be busy  but if you are constantly understaffed  for a long time  and have had customers complaint about this over and over  shouldn't you find ways to resolve this problem? The waiters/waitress may be very busy with multiple tables to be attended  but at least tell your customers that you will be with them  tell them you have not forget them  tell them your drink / food will be out shortly  or just do some thing to show your acknowledge to them. From past experience  the food quality is okay  some are pretty good. But it is quite over priced for most items. For this kind of service  and the price range? We have better options. This is not a place to go. I am glad we did not stay and left. Reading some other people's review here  where they were being ignored  food takes forever to come out  drinks takes forever to be refilled (if at all)  and getting wrong orders  I am glad we left and able to avoid getting worse experience. But it already ruined my day!!!!!!Spend your time  and your money at some other place with better review. You deserved to be treated better than at this place. Run away from this restaurant if you could !!!
Gloria A.,Covina  CA,43,10,3,5/29/2017,3.0,Went for a friend's birthday dinner and the food was delicious. And to our surprise we could have a full conversation because the music was not blasting. The only thing was the staff could be trained better. Writing down orders for larger groups is something they might consider that way people actually get what they ordered.
Candice R.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,48,1,,7/28/2017,5.0,Awesome experience tonight having dinner with the family. Our server Nia made our night memorable
Mandi M.,Montclair  CA,2,70,37,9/25/2017,4.0,I wish i had got my servers name. She was great. A tall  thin black woman. Probably the most attentive server I've ever had at a bjs. She checked on us constantly and interacted with my son. I took off a star because my sons fruit tasted like onions. But i get it  it happens.
Alyssa Marie O.,Glendora  CA,1,29,85,1/11/2017,5.0,I always get served by the nicest people! I come here on many occasions. The monkey bread & chocolate chip pazookies are always amazing. The B.J's brew house burger is a favorite along with the fettucini alfredo with garlic knots!
Andres G.,Fullerton  CA,0,2,,10/9/2017,5.0,We had a party of 13 and there was some confusion on the reservation  we were seated at a table for 7 so once we notified the hostess ( didn't catch her name) she was really great  got us a new table in no time  our server Destiny did a great job on making sure we were taken care of and though we hit a couple obstacles she was quick to correct them.
Joshua P.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,46,48,21,6/2/2017,5.0,The food was meh  but it is to be expected. Plus in Bj's defense we did get very bland entrees  so that's not really their fault. But the beer  appetizers  and service were awesome. We were seated promptly and our waiter  Ryan B  was excellent. Constantly kept up with his tables and provide fast and reliable service. Personally I'm not too big a fan of the food but the booze and bitches (jk jk) I mean are awesome. I look forward to our return... to get really really drunk lol. thanks again to Ryan B.
Anabela M.,West Covina  CA,144,9,3,7/15/2017,1.0,"I recently went on my lunch break with my co-workers  and I was very disappointed. Mind you we are on a certain time frame where we had to be back to the office because patients were scheduled right when we get back from lunch. The waiters/waitresses were standing around talking while we were all trying to get their attention. In the end we asked for our check anxiously and the waiter that did get our attention rudely responded with ""uh I\'ll get your waiter right now  what\'s her name?"" and walked away. No team work what\'s so ever. Also  we didn\'t even know our waitresses name because she was also tending us is a rushing manner. As if she wanted to go back to mingling with her co-workers. I\'m so disappointed and definitely will not be going back. Management really needs to crack down on customer service and team work."
Michelle R.,Rialto  CA,0,10,5,2/1/2017,1.0,UPDATE: Went to get dinner on Friday. The wait time for a table was 30min  no problem. Wh an we were seated our drink and appitizer order was taken in a timely manner. After our appetizer was brought out our server came to take our order. That was the end kf the good servicr. We waited an hour to get our food! When it came out our food was cold. My husband's pizza came in the oven pan that it is cooked in which was COLD to the touch. My mother in laws food was cold and my food had a hair in it. (See picture below). When we got our food we hadn't seen our server for about 30 min. I saw him in another section while we were waiting for our food but then he disappeared. When we realized all of the issues with our food we looked for him and after about 10 minutes he appeared. I told him that there was hair in my food and he took the plate and said he'd get a manager. After about 10 minutes someone brought me a new plate of food which I did not ask for or want. About 10 minutes after that a manager finally came over and apologized. She said that she had been trying to make her way to our table. My husband told her that all of the food was cold when it was brought out and that there was a hair in my food. He didn't eat any of his pizza. She offered to remake it but we had already been there for almost 2hrs at this point (not counting the time we waited for the table) and were not in the mood to eat their food anymore. She removed the two uneaten entrees from our bill and took 50% off our lemonades  appetizer and my mother in laws food. Obviously this had been a horrible experience and we will not be back for dinner at this location. Previous review:I get the lunch special to-go a lot from this location. It's close to work and I order on the app so that it is ready by the time I get there. It's a pretty good deal for the quality of the food you get especially compared to everything else close by. I get the half chicken club lunch special and it comes with thin cut fires (yum!) or wedges and soup or salad. The broccoli cheddar soup and chicken tortilla soup are both really good! The only thing I would say is to check your order before you leave. There are a few new people at the take out counter and they have almost forgotten to include my fries once and did forget to give me my fires last week when a coworker picked up the order. I would also go inside to pay or do mobile pay on the app to save time.
Jenn R.,West Covina  CA,0,2,,6/4/2017,1.0,Service is awful. We waited 20min before going to the front desk to ask for a server to come to our table. We had not even been greeted by a server yet. After that we waited for the manager for almost 10min. Once she arrived she basically just said that she would put out order in for us. I am so disappointed.
Nanette O.,Los Angeles  CA,0,9,2,5/17/2017,1.0,Tried to end my day at a familiar place and was disappointed. I waited for half an hour to be served a glass of water. As I tried to flag a server to inquire about placing an order with my server  I was unable to because not a single server acknowledged me. I walked out hungry and saddened to have received such poor service from a restaurant chain that I really like.
Desarie B.,San Gabriel  CA,6,4,,7/12/2017,3.0,Went here 2 Sundays ago. We walked in the Manager was standing at the podium we made eye contact she did not smile she did not greet us. We got seated  within minutes we were greeted and our drink order was taken kudos. Moments later server came he was great all around on his game! We ordered an appetizer food runner brought it out no napkins no plates disappointed again. Food was ok not to Bjs normal standards. Arcadia location seems to be on point. Managers always friendly especially if they make eye contact!
Avin S.,Corona  CA,208,93,561,4/1/2016,4.0,Always come for their lunch specials  really affordable and filling at under $8. Favorites are the baked potato with soup or half sandwich with soup and fries combos. Food comes out fairly fast  but always tastes really good. They have their own app now that lets you reserve a spot in line and place your order before you're even seated! You can even pay using the app! Pretty cool.
Luis H.,El Monte  CA,0,3,,11/15/2017,1.0,i always come to this BJs for lunch and today was the worst service i got the waitress Alyssa was really rude when i decided to change the strawberry lemonade to a soda when it was way to sweet  we ordered a Deep Dished Ziti and never received the garlic bread that came with it.
Adriana H.,Covina  CA,0,20,13,1/22/2017,5.0,Ariana our server was so on it ! Food was awesome  every time I come I get good food. Very average on noise even with a football game on!
Kaylee N.,Kirkland  WA,365,1,,4/29/2017,1.0,DONT EVER GO HERE. Horrible service for nothing. The waiter was rude  the food wasn't good and the place was gross. The waiter would disappear and wouldn't come back for a very long time. The waiter didn't refill our drinks  and the food took forever. Also the bathrooms were gross and I've been in nicer gas station bathrooms. Horrible place
Dennis W.,Azusa  CA,570,244,1308,7/2/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,"Well  I don\'t know why the kitchen staff can\'t get the extra sauce concept on the pizza correct. I\'ve been trying to get them to put extra sauce on a pizza for months now and it just isn\'t working. After having a conversation about extra sauce with my server  he made sure to put it in correctly. When the pizza came he came to the table to check it out. He looked at the pizza. I looked at the pizza. I took off some of the toppings. I asked him  ""Well  what do you think?"" He said  ""It doesn\'t look like there is any sauce on the pizza."" I agreed. He brought us extra sauce... So the crisis was averted. The manager came over and was very apologetic. Five stars for service  but to constantly keep screwing up a simple request is bad. I love the pizza at other BJs restaurants  but it looks like I\'ll have to try something else to eat here or stop coming."
Aaron R.,West Covina  CA,3,7,2,5/9/2017,5.0,went for my birthday dinner and I had an amazing time. Love my server David S. He was very courteous and very kind and attentive to our every need. thank you david
Irma R.,Duarte  CA,21,4,,7/10/2017,1.0,The last time I was here the service was sub par but this time I was sick by the time I got home. Beware!!
Brittany W.,Covina  CA,0,3,,7/30/2017,1.0,I came here yesterday for my birthday and it was just a horrible experience. The broccoli and chicken on my alfredo was cold and I had to send it back. When I got it back it was still cold. ( I do believe they made an effort pretty sure it was a new plate) then the waiter left with my drink and never brought it back  not until I asked like 15 mins later. Then when he did bring my drink the ice was melted and it looked like it had been sitting. Everyone at the table tried it and agreed it was flat. I didn't drink it and left it at the table. One of my guest ordered a pull-pork and when they delivered it they told her they bring her the coleslaw in a minute that it was being freshly made but he never returned and she was too scared to ask. My table ended up ordering the new churro dessert they have and we bit into mini corn dogs (do they even sell that there?) it was so gross and funny cause they looked like churros. Honestly  I didn't eat my pasta and left hungry. I was truly disappointed on my birthday. All I wanted all day was pasta and a pizookie.
Steven G.,Los Angeles  CA,62,106,205,4/2/2016,2.0,The service is decent  but the food is terrible. Ordered calamari to start  it was super greasy  and tasted burnt. We also ordered their chicken club sandwiches  which were unrecognizable as club sandwiches  it was a chicken sandwich with bacon and avocado  missing the signature middle peice of bread. It was also drowned in mayonnaise. The pazookies are a decent desert. All in all  very lazy food  just come for the beer.
brenda V.,Downey  CA,37,14,1,1/25/2017,4.0,Wine Tuesday is everything. Half off of wine glasses and bottles until midnight. Very good service at this particular location and I will definitely be coming back when I'm in town.
Paul G.,San Dimas  CA,0,10,,9/21/2017,1.0,5 minutes on hold no one knows if they have NFL network games. Its a sports bar right?Nexxtttt!
Sophia S.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,0,3,1,1/18/2017,2.0,Totally grossed out by the food at bjs. We got wings and four out of the 10 we're either bitten or we're the actual wing of the wing. No lie take a look at the pictures. When I told the manager she said it's normal they don't inspect everyone of the wings. I think the right answer should have been oh I'm so sorry. I am completely disgusted in the quality control here. Let me mention our server was amazing it is really sad he has to get the brunt of the kitchens issue.
Nicholas F.,Chino Hills  CA,450,10,2,2/16/2017,5.0,I honestly think people lie about some of the reviews about this place. this place does their best to make sure everything is top notch. Yes its a big restaurant  yes you may have to wait an hour to be seated but its because this place is always packed to the brim. My family and I love eating here  and unless you are cursing at an employee  which i have seen happen here  i have never seen an employee act unprofessional.
Julio C.,Los Angeles County  CA,2,17,7,4/15/2017,5.0,So  I have been to this location several times and today I received the best service from and amazing server. He told me things about the in house brews that I would have never known. It was awesome how he knew and shared with us. His name is Michael H. I really hope management acknowledges him on his professionalism and knowledge.
Yvette P.,West Covina  CA,17,12,6,2/13/2017,5.0,I love coming here. The food is average but the service is always top notch. Our last server Steven P. was great  attentive and interacted great with our family. Enjoyed our Saturday dinner very much
Chrissy J.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,17,17,2,4/23/2017,1.0,Was not going to post a comment after our experience at this location today  but I can not help it being my boyfriend has been throwing up for about an hour now and we ate there about 4pm. Our service sucked and the food was cold and mediocre to say the least. Obviously  resulting in acute food poisoning for my boyfriend who got the brisket burger. Will not be going back to this location nor any other. We should have complained  but we had a new server and felt bad. Now we know better.
Babz B.,Covina  CA,32,9,,8/28/2016,1.0,"Sunday afternoon girls answering the phone were twits... hung up on me twice... transfered to ""Take Our"" so that my Curbside order could be brought out to me....and no one seemed to know wth was going on!...one star rating based solely on that part of the experience."
Raymond Y.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,96,20,17,3/12/2017,5.0,I'm a regular BJ's brewery patron  this place was exceptional.. we received great service   Roger  was attentive  accurate with our orders and had great recommendations(beer). Our pizza was warm (usually get cold pizza from BJ's) and my son's mini pizza was super cheesy-- perfect! I will return to this BJ'S
Andy L.,Palm Desert  CA,0,6,3,9/2/2017,5.0,Nice staffs here! Me and buddies went here for birthday and when I went home I found out I accidentally got over charged  I went back the manager Stacie was super nice and redound my money
Martin M.,Fullerton  CA,37,52,13,2/16/2016,1.0,We waited for our food for over 40 minutes in the curb side service. I placed the order at 5:20 I get a call asking if I had placed an order. So she says it'll be 20 minutes. I understand that it's a holiday so I give them thirty five minutes. I call in again  once I'm in the curb side parking spot  because the sign says to do so.    This guy says you placed an order? I stated I had and he says ok someone will be out there in a few. 40 minutes later I call again and I'm like uh we're still here. They say ok someone will be right out... 15 minutes later she finally arrives with our food. I wasn't rude at all I understand its busy and the girl was super nice. What really top this whole ordeal was when we got home  we were eating and there was a HUGE hair in my husbands salad. Gross!! So upsetting that even the pizookie couldn't heal that hurt. Someone needs to work on their quality checking and work flow.
Bernadette T.,West Covina  CA,0,8,,11/2/2016,4.0,My husband and I enjoy BJ's Happy Hour specials because of their good value. My hubbie enjoys sliders and beer  I like their wings and a mixed drink. We both agree that their pizza and salads are enjoyable. One of our favorite items here is their dessert Pizookie. We wish they would bring back the oatmeal raisin that we used to love! So in the mean time we settle for other flavor options...Ordering a hot freshly baked cookie topped with ice cream is unique to this establishment and keeps us coming back over and over.
Karen P.,Glendora  CA,5,5,,12/10/2016,2.0,Usually decent.. today not so much .. slooooooowwwwwww service and it was not busy  saw plenty of servers.. .just not for us. So fun watching people who were seated well after us get service. We must've been in the penalty box seating ....
Andrea A.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,0,2,,8/12/2017,1.0,My bf and I absolutely love bjs  but the service was awful didn't get attended till 20 min in. When given our desserts the girl literally put them on the table said nothing and walked away. (My bf and I are servers)
Lori O.,Moreno Valley  CA,0,20,1,6/2/2017,5.0,We stopped in for a late lunch yesterday. We sat in the bar.  As always the food was devine! I had flatbread nachos and my friend had thin crust pizza. I love their deep dish pizza and had never tried the thin crust. It was so good! I don't know which I liked better  my old standby flatbread nachos or the thin crust pizza. Our server was Jason W. (#280 - according to the receipt) and he was amazing. He made our fun lunch absolutely perfect. I was just emailing with my friend this morning  and she mentioned how awesome Jason was  haha. Thank you Jason for making our lunch memorable!
Franklin L.,Downey  CA,32,71,68,5/4/2017,4.0,first time in this place  the experience was good  costumer service was fantastic  the food is great  we will be comeback for sure.
Javier M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,8,2,10/31/2016,3.0,Mehhh the service is fine but tell me if this looks appetizing? I understand it's a 16 dollar steak but at least make it look good.
Hugh B.,Los Angeles  CA,5,18,2,6/24/2016,1.0,Hey BJ--Dude  your sauce free pizza is dry and awful  awfully dry  and just really kind of strange.You got something against pizza sauce?
Vic C.,Duarte  CA,104,2326,8399,1/18/2015,4.0,Came by this BJ's last Thursday around 11:40 pm to pick up a to go order. For it being a weekday  this place was pretty busy. The size of this restaurant location is bigger than the other BJ's around the area (Arcadia  City of Industry  Montebello). When I came to pick up my order  my food was just about ready for me to pick up (I made the order on line). This is what I ordered:Kale and Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad  $9.75 prior to tax- I have had this salad a few times already at other locations and am a big fan of it. Can't go wrong with the flavors and textures in this salad. The dried cranberries add a different texture and sweetness to this salad  along with the red grapes. The candied pecans and toasted pepitas give this salad another layer of flavor and crunch. The cooked Brussels sprouts also help to create another layer of texture to this salad and the kale is a nice dark green leafy to round out this hearty salad. It's nice that the dressing automatically comes on the side so that your salad doesn't get soggy before you arrive (this is also healthier so you don't over do the dressing in your salad). Asian Chopped Salad  $9.75 prior to tax- I liked this salad with the mandarin oranges adding a bit of sweetness. I wished this salad was made with the dark green leafys though. There is plenty of chicken in this salad  but perhaps a bit too much of the crispy wonton strips. I would probably ask them to give me half the amount they use if I was to order this again. Full Rack of Baby Back Pork Ribs  $21.95 prior to tax- This entree comes with 2 signature sides and so I picked the steamed green beans & seasoned vegetables. Both were cooked well and tasted great. But the ribs itself was a little dry. Although I got a little container of barbecue sauce  which was a nice flavor  it still wasn't a saving grace to those ribs. What a shame  especially at this price point.Sweet Pig Deep Dish Pizza  Large 14 inch ($20.05 prior to tax)- My husband and I were a little disappointed with this pizza because it was just too bread-y (if that can even be a word...). I wished the bread/ dough itself was seasoned because it was rather plain. The pizza itself was also on the salty side (but that's understandable since this pizza has ham and cheese). I thought BJ's is know for their pizzas (besides their beers) and so I was surprised that this pizza was a let down. I don't think I would order this or a pizza again in the future. Service was very friendly when we arrived and picked up our pizza. The two employees helping us moved quick and efficiently. By the way  this restaurant location is located in the same plaza as Walmart (neighborhood market)  DSW and Petsmart. There is also plenty of parking and there is free Wifi here (that was rather fast when we came).
Erik M.,Orange  CA,3,6,,8/4/2017,1.0,This is one of the worst BJ's I have ever been to  me and my girlfriend were here three days ago to get dinner. We were sat down at our table and we literally sat waiting to be greeted by a server for over 30 min. There were four groups that were seated in our immediate area and had their orders taken down and drinks brought out before we were even addressed. So I got up and walked to the front desk and asked to talk to a manager. This Hispanic lady came out I don't remember her name but she walked out like we were bothering her. She asked what the issue was and I explained and I told her I'm not here for a free meal I don't want any complimentary services I just wanted the problem of the horrible customer service fixed. She replied with well I know you guys came hungry so let me take care of you and I apologize. Lol first off that's not how you respond to customers. Secondly she responded with a aggressive attitude and I told her that your attitude sucks first off and it's obvious nothing is going to happen. So I we took our business elsewhere and the manager didn't give two shits if we left or not. She walked right off like it was nothing. I love BJ's and I will continue to eat there but NEVER at the West Covina one. If you want to be ignored for a half hour then have the crappy management treat you like crap then go to West Covina. This review is for the people of yelp because I know nothing is going to happen to that manager and the customer service will not change. If your understaffed that's not our problem hire more people. She should not be in management acting that way. Plain and simple  if I could give them zero stars I would. She is a direct reflection of the other managers that work there and it's clear if she don't give a damn about customers the others don't either.
Demi W.,Bakersfield  CA,10,9,1,4/22/2017,5.0,This was a great meal. We loved our server Steven P. He was personable  made great suggestions and was an excellent attentive server. Huge restaurant and no wait probably because we ate there Easter Sunday. We are from out of town we were in town visiting our son who is LACo Fire Academy he appreciated the delicious meal.
Valerie Y.,Davis  CA,154,1,1,3/29/2017,5.0,Had dinner at BJs for a girls night. Service was amazing! Waiter has great burger recommendations and was very attentive! Thank you Steven P!
Diana M.,West Covina  CA,33,15,,1/22/2017,1.0,"Not bad if you like your salad w/wilted lettuce  your ""medium well"" steak undercooked & rare  and your main meal lukewarm because it all sits around waiting for someone to pick it up and deliver to your table. All six of us in our party had the same problem. Server was nice and manager removed three drinks from our tab in return for the 50 minute wait and room temperature food. The place was not even packed  so there was no excuse for this problem."
Isabel G.,Glendora  CA,43,8,1,1/8/2017,5.0,The Extra Hot chicken wing are delicious and has the right amount of hot sauce and is strong in flavor should try. The reasons why I capitalized Extra and Hot is 1 it represents the delicious taste and 2 represents the hot taste. Love it so much .EG -9yrs old
Adrian B.,La Puente  CA,208,24,111,7/5/2016,4.0,This BJs is very spacious and gets parties in and out quickly  but without rushing the customers. Their intercom system allows for you to wait outside while they call you without fear of them skipping your party. The drinks are made generously with alcohol and their food was delicious! It did take longer than expected to get our food out  but it was a busy day. Great for large parties and celebrations! Saw a dual birthday party with balloons and presents so very celebration friendly.
Mike L.,Walnut  CA,9,1,,3/9/2017,2.0,The service was great but the unlimited soup and salad was a huge disappointment. First soup was in a plate size and second becomes in a tiny bowl. On top of it  the waiting was too long in between of just getting a wedge salad and soup.
Jamie S.,Burbank  CA,0,1,,6/24/2017,5.0,Came in with my family for dinner last night  I had the prime rib and my husband had the ribs kids had pasta love  love   love the food and the atmosphere. Our server Matt  was on point with clearing our tables and refilling our beverages   manager Stacey came by our to making sure that our service was good. Thank for a wonderful dining experience!
Emily P.,El Monte  CA,6,1,7,4/4/2016,3.0,Seared Ahi Salad taste very very good.Top sirloin ...... Over cooked  too dryGuacamole and chip taste good.Service not bad  but not good enough.
Abhie C.,Covina  CA,0,5,1,5/20/2016,1.0,"My first and mostlikely my last visit in this restaurant. Friday night we went there and we were on the waiting list  had to wait for 25 mins. No biggie for us  we waited until we were seated. Seated  ordered a pasta entree and my husband ordered a burger with thin sliced fries on the side. Drinks came in right after. Ten minutes later the waitress just kept checking up if we doing fine. Typical but we appreciate this gesture. Twenty minutes later  same thing  but this time she\'s trying to assure us that the food is coming soon. Thirty minutes and still no food. Forty minutes later  no food still. Pushing to fifty minutes to maybe an hour  this time we are already getting upset. The nearby tables are almost gone and empty  and yet we still have no food. We had to call a nearby waiter to ask what happened to our food. He went ahead and also called a manager in our table. All this times  I guarantee you  we were calm. A little bit upset but we were okay. We just want the damn food to come.Now the manager came and approached us  he apologized and offered a free dessert and a discount for the inconvenience. And we were ok we that  we appreciate the gesture. Soon after talking to him  our food came.But unfortunately  they got my husband\'s order wrong. They gave him wedge fries that looked horribly over fried  what he ordered were thin slices fry. How frustrating  now the manager again approached us and asked if everything is okay. And i said  that the order was wrong. He apologized and then went off to get us the right one. To be fair though  my husband said that the burger actually tasted good. My pasta  not so much unfortunately :(Now at this point we were done eating and kindly asked for the ""complimentary"" dessert  it came fast and it was really delicious. We werent even done eating it  and the bill was already given to us. Funny how fast they gave the bill but they took an hour to get us our food. Checking the bill and all that  we noticed that they were charging us of the supposedly ""free"" (apology dessert)  we then had to call the manager  yet again  for the 4th or 5th time to correct it. As you can already imagine  this is probably the one of the worst experience one can encounter. It was just a disaster. We are never going back  maybe not in a long time."
Rebecca V.,Walnut  CA,1,11,3,2/27/2017,2.0,"I was here last Friday (2/24/17) at around 4-430 and wasn\'t too pleased with the service. My bf and I came in during happy hour and the hostess said we could sit anywhere in the bar area and offered us a booth that wasn\'t cleaned up yet. She said someone would come by to clean it so I accepted the booth. We sat down and waited for the table to be cleaned. While waiting  unnoticed the hostess was irritated and rolling her eyes as soon as customers turned away or as she turned away from them. This is a really bad look because she is the hostess. She is the first and last person customers come in contact with when eating here  it\'s unprofessional and it\'s rude; even though her gestures weren\'t towards me  it\'s irritating to see. Anyway. Our waitress came by  looked at the dirty table with plates and glasses on there and said ""let me get someone to clean this"". So we waited a little longer for her to grab a buser  but I\'m sure she could have helped him since she\'s capable of doing so. After he came by and cleaned our table  the waitress came back to take our order only to realize we had no menus (: anyway.. got or menus and ordered our drinks and food. The food is always pretty good here which is why I like coming back. Asked for a side of ranch  10 minutes later we got it. The restaurant wasn\'t too busy so the service was questionable to me. And if it was busy  and I missed something  then a Friday night during happy hour should have more staff available. Our waitress wasn\'t mean or rude in any way  but she wasn\'t very friendly either. Something\'s just weren\'t right during this visit."
Kristen W.,Ontario  CA,114,14,4,6/19/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,Came and ordered ribs for my husband and an appetizer Brussels sprouts with a side of fries. Brussels sprouts were burnt crisp  but no one ever checked back to see what the food tasted like. Poor service on Olivia the servers part. We waited forever and I finally flagged down another worker  but by then we had to leave. Manager came for no reason and didn't know how to resolve situation. Left hungry. Manager contacted me on yelp and said to contact them if I would like to share more. They should make more of an effort to contact me.
Lauren A.,Covina  CA,232,176,404,10/7/2015,5.0,This place is always good  the drink and food. Service is okay but they get super busy at time. My fave thing to order is the deep dish pizza  calamari  and of course a bazookie to finding dinner. Last night there was a problem with out order since a computer malfunctioned Soo they gave us free salads and free dessert. They were very nice and professional with the situation. The pumpkin cookie and icecream was very delicious! Get it while you can. The waitress also recommended a good wine me crema pinot noir. We've been coming to this location for years. Also if you are there to drink the bar section is nice try the scoobie snack!
Jamie G.,West Covina  CA,23,2,,12/7/2016,1.0,First off after being seat we were ignored for 10 until we were asked for drinks and by then we knew our order but the waiter told to take more time to decide  so we waited another 15 before he came back to get our food order. We then wait about 20 when a manager came to apologize because a system error in the kitchen causing slow orders being made so my gf and i understood   but when our food came it didn't taste right and I ended up vomiting my beef dip sandwich at the restaurant bathroom and my gf had gotten sick on the way home from eating the metatrain tacos which we blain and dry chicken meat. So I will never return here and I hope no one else gets sick from this place like I did....
Jessica F.,Bell  CA,0,3,,3/31/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,This is my favorite hang out in town. We eat & drink here on a regular basis. We ALWAYS have a good time with our favorite bartenders  Vince  Chris  Sarah  Brady  David  Ashley  Jeff and Andrew. They have a really good variety of food and if you're watching your calories they also have an Enlightened Menu. It's a good place to hang out and socialize.
Michael T.,Fullerton  CA,0,11,,3/31/2017,2.0,We came in at 230pm to start our Friday early right  we usually sit at the bar. We met the bartender Evelyn who was amazing. She made sure to communicate  give us happy hour prices and just all around a great bartender  and then  party pooper Vince the bartender took over with his down attitude  no service  and just made us want to leave  so we did! Don't get me wrong  I love BJ's but I pay for and want good service. Come on management...let's make sure your bartenders are at least sociable and attentive!!!
Jim K.,Camarillo  CA,1373,503,3770,8/24/2015,4.0,I have eaten at a lot of BJ's but this one is one more location to check off the list!We got very good service and the food was fresh tasty.Bill had the Mahi-Mahi or Shrimp Tacos you get char grilled mahi-mahi and broiled shrimp tacos with chipotle mayonnaise and tossed in Santa Fe dressing  Napa cabbage  carrots  red onions and cilantro. With avocado cream sauce  fire-roasted tomato salsa and tortilla chips.I had the California Chicken Club  Layered with Applewood smoked bacon  avocado  melted swiss cheese  lettuce  tomatoes and roasted garlic mayonnaise on grilled sourdough bread.yum!!!we didn't have any cocktails but in the past i always go for the Jeremiah Red. RED BEER! wanted a burger but needed a change and it was a great choice!
LeBrock B.,La Puente  CA,93,176,320,12/22/2015,5.0,We came here on a Saturday night expecting the longest wait. We were seated within 10 minutes as we requested outside seating. They were still placing everything on the tables and moving around tables and chairs so we had to stand for a bit but we didn't mind. It was so cold that night so I was starting to regret our choice of eating outside. But as soon as we were seated it was amazing. The heater was right on us. There were only 2 other couples there which was extremely pleasant because there wasn't excessive noise like inside would have been.We ordered appetizers  drinks  and food and they all came to us very quickly! The server was amazing! Very friendly and helpful.Overall this location is one of the good ones. Definitely our favorite spot for dinner.
Christina B.,West Covina  CA,102,12,3,9/3/2016,5.0,Just had dinner with my cousin and sister tonight at BJ's and yhe food was great! Also the service was as well! Mr tall dark and handsome Steven was very helpful  sweet  and funny! Thanks for a great meal! (:
Ann Marie L.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,4,11,1,6/2/2017,5.0,Emy was our server today. She was great. Very friendly and knowledgeable. The place was very busy for lunch but she handled us very well. All of our food was good. The Pizookie is a must! We would come back again and ask for Emy.
Eric W.,West Covina  CA,138,4,1,10/31/2016,1.0,Horrible service  cold food  and nothing to drink. I've been a server for a long time  and have worked in many restaurants. This server was the worst I have had. No people skills  nothing to drink!! We sat here for 10 15 min before being recognized at our booth  not that busy let me add. Also I only received one glass of water my whole meel  I spent money on alcohol  so did my wife  and did not get a chance to get a refill due to him not returning till he brought a box  and the check
Tracie S.,Anaheim Hills  CA,455,359,2337,8/18/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,"Extremely disappointed in the communication/service at this BJ\'s location.Some of the people at my office wanted to throw a baby shower for one of our coworkers. Since our conference room at the office was under renovation  we needed to find another venue to have the lunch. Since we work near several restaurants  we decided to see if we can have it at one of them.We went to BJs and spoke to the general manager  Will a week prior to the event. We explained to him what we were planning and asked him if they would be able to accommodate that. We also explained to him that this was a work event and asked if we would be able to get split bills to make it easier for everyone. Since they no longer automatically added tip to large parties  it really wouldn\'t make a difference. He assured me that it was no problem and recommended that we pre-order everyone\'s food so that they would already know the name of the person  their food order  their drink order  and any special food requests they had ahead of time. I thought this was a brilliant idea and agreed that this would make the process smooth and efficient. He was really friendly and we felt at ease after speaking with him.We had 25 people RSVP to the shower and so we typed out everyone\'s orders and made sure to personally bring the print out to BJ\'s just in case they had any questions.Our party was scheduled for Thursday @ 11:30am and we brought the print out to BJs on Wednesday. We asked for Will and gave him the print out to look over and see if the info we had was sufficient for what they needed. He had a couple questions that were easily remedied and we were set to go. He even complimented the fact that we had all info so organized and easy to follow.He indicated that they would have the food ready to go that day and we wouldn\'t have to waste time trying to order and they would have the checks all ready to go with each person\'s order and name on it so it would be easy on them and on us when it came time to pay the bill. He even said he would be there the day of our event.The food and wait staff were all decent and we all got our orders in a timely manner. However  when it came time for the bill. The waitress said she didn\'t know anything about the split checks and that it would take time for them to do it. We even spoke with the assistant manager  Cynthia that day and she was aware of the printout I had given Will. She even commented that it was so well organized. We asked to speak with her and instead of apologizing for not having the bills ready as promised by Will. She said it was a hassle to do split checks and that their computer systems can\'t handle it and that\'s why it\'ll take longer.We asked if we could speak with Will since he was the one we had been dealing with and was informed by one employee that he wasn\'t working and that he was in the kitchen by another employee.We ended up waiting a good 30min for the bill and most of our party ended up leaving since we were all there during our lunch break and it was already well past our lunch. The rest of the people that stayed had to deal with everyone\'s checks. They also ended up charging some people incorrectly and were billed ""dinner"" prices when we all ordered lunch portions.It was past 2pm by the time we finished paying everyone\'s bills. We had been looking forward to a relaxing lunch and instead  we left irritated and angry. I was especially irritated because we were the ones going around getting everyone\'s orders the day before and making sure everything was as complete as possible. We have a large office and many of us order food from BJs. After this experience  I don\'t think I will ever go again. I had always been really happy with the food from BJs  but after this  even the food can\'t win back my business."
Christina C.,Norwalk  CA,70,36,13,12/27/2016,1.0,"I\'ve been to different BJ\'s locations many times and never had anything but a stellar experience. We chose to come to the West Covina BJ\'s as it was one of very few places that were going to be open at dinner time on December 24th that would have a suitable selection for my boyfriend (he\'s a vegetarian). The moment we walked in  the smell that accosted us was horrific. It reeked of urine - almost as if someone had peed all over the rugs in the entryway  someone peed at the door  the floors were mopped with a dirty mop from the bathroom... I don\'t know - but it was strong and I almost wanted to leave based solely on that. But we stood by the desk waiting for the hostess to not only help us but acknowledge us (it took about 2 minutes for her to even look in our direction - no exaggeration on the time). Our waiter was very good and attentive - I wish I\'d have gotten his name because he was the only positive part of the evening. The BF ordered a custom pizza and I ordered the ribeye. The plate and subsequent replacement plates were filthy - fingerprints  grease  caked on food - the waiter was genuinely embarrassed about this. And no  the cutlery didn\'t fair much better as the BF needed a replacement set on those  too. When the food finally arrived after what I\'d consider a longer than normal wait time  especially based on what we ordered  it looked pretty good. My BF remarked that the pizza was very tasty and well made. My steak however left quite a lot to be desired: I ordered it at mid-rare and it bordered more on rare but that wasn\'t much of an issue for me. What I DID take issue with was the amount of un-rendered fat left on the steak and the gristle. For a ""prime"" cut of meat  I was very surprised and not in the good way. I cut it in half and was able to get a couple of bites in - it tasted okay  it was just very bland and underwhelming - but as I tried to cut my third bite  I hit some gristle and I hacked and sawed trying to cut around it and mauled at a good portion of the steak before conceding (and never managing to get my knife through it). I hate  HATE to send food back but for a dish at a premium price that I couldn\'t enjoy  I decided it needed to go back. I ordered a pizza in its place and after a considerable wait period again  it arrived and was decent. The manager checked in on us and again  the waiter was very good to us. I ate a little less than 2 pieces of the pizza before asking for boxes since my BF was long done. We\'d been at the restaurant for about 2 hours at that point and were 100% ready to leave. We will never be back to this location. Ever. We will drive further if we ever consider BJ\'s again and that\'s a big ""if."" This place needs its manager to get a fire under her ass about quality and maybe have the health department come in to check the cleanliness. Seriously disappointing."
Ethan D.,Victorville  CA,0,3,,3/14/2017,5.0,So my girl friend and I were driving back home from big bear and decided to stop at Bjs. The ahi salad was great. Our sever Michael R was awesome! Very attentive  really personable! Honestly probably the best service We've had at a Bjs!! Will be back!
Rambo T.,La Puente  CA,2,14,3,2/17/2017,2.0,Bartenders were great  but my girlfriend and I sat in the bar area and the server gave us attitude after he took forever and I ended up order a second round from the bartender directly. I order the spinach dip appetizer and it came out about 20 mins later and the food has been more than 40 mins... good thing theres beer... well I'm waiting for it but I see beer.
Alicia J.,Walnut  CA,329,6,2,7/29/2016,1.0,Okkay ready to do some math kids let's go12 adults walk into BJs (long wait so we order some drinks at the bar) 45 min later we get satAt that time we have had 5 pitchers that pour roughly 4 beers so 5 x 4 = 20 now let's divide that by 12 that equals 1.6We are finally sat and order another pitcher and a couple beers. Then the manager proceeds to tell us you guys are not aloud to drink anymore because we are loud and think we are wasted (let me remind you we are celebrating a World Series win). After arguing back in forth she won't let us drink for an hour and after we eat due to policy. Let me call bullshit. I've worked in service industry for 6 years and I've never seen this kind of service. She was rude and hated us for being loud and outgoing So if you wanna have a good time don't come here because they will shut you down really fast ***let me add our waiter was awesome and food was good but going out to me includes the whole experience***
Abraham V.,Montclair  CA,0,5,,3/9/2017,5.0,They did n excellent job from sitting us down   serving us and checking if everything was ok . The food was really good and our server by the name of FRANK took very good care of us . Thank you
Danielle S.,Diamond Bar  CA,3,57,28,5/21/2016,4.0,"I apologize for the extremely long review in advance! But something has to be said. My boyfriend and I came to dinner tonight at the BJs at the Eastland center. The restaurant was packed which is to be expected for a Friday night.  Our waiter was very nice and attentive even though he was extremely busy running around everywhere. The reason I took off a star is because when the server (different from our waiter) brought us our food she had a hard time fitting my bfs plate on the table because his appetizer was in the way (he ordered potato skins and they come on a really long plate; also we were sitting at a small booth for two). She finally made it work and when she walked away she made an extremely rude and insensitive comment. At first we kind of brushed the comment off and tried to enjoy our food. Then  the more time passed and the more we thought about it  the more it upset us. We chose to go to BJs over 3 Vinos for dinner  and had every intention of enjoying a nice dinner after a long week. We make that choice just to have our night ruined by a rude server. Eventually we asked to speak to the manager. At first the assistant manager came to our table and when we told him what happened he went to get his supervisor. A few minutes later the restaurant manager came to our table and apologized for the incident  let us know our meal was ""taken care of"" and encouraged us to call him directly if we had any other concerns. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the way the manager Louis handled the situation. He apologized so many times and did so much for us that I even started to feel bad for saying anything. We had ordered dessert to go (we pizookies!) and boxed up over half of our entrees and both of our appetizers because we lost our appetites. Louis comped our entire meal including the to-go desserts  AND brought us dessert to enjoy before we left. While we were waiting for our to-go desserts the server and executive chef came to our table to apologize for the comment. This was going to be our last time at this BJs but after being taken care of so well by Louis I will make sure we return. Neither of us expected the sincerity we received from Louis  the server  and the executive chef OR for anything (let alone our entire meal) to be on the house. We really just wanted to bring it to their attention and from the way Louis reacted it seemed as thought this was not the first time this server had an incident like this."
Anthony R P.,Covina  CA,62,208,40,12/4/2016,2.0,Overpriced basic food. Probably good if you want to have some drinks and watch a game(which I don't do surgery if lol) but eating here is meh. I only come when someone wants to go here. Which is rare.
Liam C.,San Bernardino  CA,31,1,,3/14/2017\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Haven't been to bjs in a while but I'm glad I did. I went in this week and had the California chicken club food was great and service was even better! My server was Michael. He said was new and was he the best server I've had at bjs! Definitely will be asking for him again!
Slick V.,Azusa  CA,73,62,98,6/15/2016,5.0,BJ's is always the best spot for good food drink sports games and socialing in a nice environment with your friends.Decore is dark nice modern clean and spacious. Ambience and atmosphere is very happy friendly welcomeing and yet private too. Food is great love the wings California chicken sandwich is my favorite with a nice pint of Blonde. Can't say anything bad about this location.
Toni Angela O.,Los Angeles  CA,0,15,,4/15/2016,3.0,I'm making this review while I'm eating my BJ's food at home.My family and I arrived at BJ's right before the dinner rush walked in  at 6:40pm  and waited 15 minutes or less to get seated. A few minutes later  our waitress came to get our drink orders. We told her we were ready to order: 1 small bbq chicken pizza  1 side Caesar salad  1 beer  1 root beer  and waters.Our drinks came right away. While waiting for our food  my husband began feeding our 1 year old daughter. Not too long after  the family sitting in the booth adjacent to us (who got there after us) got their appetizers. And then so did the booth on the other side of us. My husband had to ask the waitress for his salad. It arrived after that  but it was the size of an entree and hardly had any dressing. He could barely eat it because it was so dry. By 7:20  the same family who go their appetizers had moved on to their entrees and here we were sitting with a dry salad and all out of baby food. The place was packed and people who weren't even there when we arrived were eating.The whole time our waitress kept checking up on our table and telling us the food would be out shortly.Well...after 35 minutes of waiting  my husband stood up and spoke to a manager and told her our situation. Of course  the pizza came while my husband was with the supervisor. I told the waitress I didn't want the pizza anymore and also complained about the salad. Instead of apologizing  she told me she saw my husband was speaking with her supervisor so she would leave the pizza here for now. Also  that she heard my husband order a Caesar entree  not a side salad.The only apology we got from our waitress was after the manager had stepped in. The manager comped our meal and we took it home. We were out the door around 7:40pm (1 hour after arrival) angry and hungry.How good or bad your experience here goes really depends on your server. Hopefully this horrible experience doesn't happen to you.
Claudia H.,South El Monte  CA,15,5,,5/3/2017,2.0,The worst service ever  we keept getting other peors food. Waiters and waitresses didn't know what they were doing. We received our appetizer and food at the same time and did mot get the condiments we requested...Dersert took 15 minutes. Will not come here again. Will go back to tbe Montebello location!.
Kevin D.,Pomona  CA,153,2,3,2/14/2017,5.0,Great customer service  Delicious food along with a great ambiance all brought to us by our great server Vivian. Thank you very much will be lookong forward to returning.
Sandy C.,Arcadia  CA,0,39,4,1/17/2017,2.0,"First let\'s start with the service. Employees are very unprofessional here even though they look older and mature. Unfortunately my boyfriend and I were seated at the booth right in front of the computers where they input food orders. The entire time we just kept hearing the girl employees gossip and talk about their nails and the males asking each other ""How\'d 32 tip you?"" Very unprofessional. The hostess also walked around while texting on her phone and servers were fooling around a good amount of the time. As for the food I was also not impressed. The portobello mushroom salad we got looked like there was little to no effort put into making it. The goat cheese was not spread out at all  they just threw on two or three giant balls of it clumped together and huge splices of portobello mushrooms laying on the top. Calamari is usually my go-to here  but their portion is very inconsistent every time. I will say they give a good-sized portion of mozzarella cheese sticks though. We also ordered the guac and bacon burger  but sad to say  in-n-out burger is even better than this. We took it to-go because we felt bad leaving it there  but when we got home we trashed it anyway because we couldn\'t even force it down our throats. Their think crispy fries were made very well though  but honestly that\'s about it."
Andrew T.,West Covina  CA,21,25,5,1/16/2017,3.0,"BJs is hit or miss with service and food. Sometimes service is great and others it\'s not. It just depends on who you get that day. The last two times I was here I ordered a pizza with extra cheese. Each time there was bald spots on my pizza. Maybe each time they got extra confused with light? It made me feel as if there was a cheese shortage right now? Another recession? I\'m also not impressed when the waiter takes your order and not writing it down!!!! It\'s annoying to me! I\'m not impressed primarily because there\'s always something wrong. 5 min later  ""you ordered a coke right?"" Umm I do t know what did you write down?"
Jenny B.,West Covina  CA,71,22,7,7/14/2016,1.0,Tried curbside service this evening  and although the convenience of our food being brought to us seemed like a plus on the positive side  it turned out to be the worst idea. After giving BJ'S a 20 minute head start on our order  we had to wait an additional 20 minutes in the curbside parking area for our food to be brought out. The customer service was decent  however the food was awful. We ordered a bison burger that was served with a rock hard bun  and cold French fries. And a kids dinner of mini corn dogs and veggies (celery and carrots). We were given no condiments with our meal. We also had ordered a monkey bread pizzoki which was hard and cold. I would have rather spent the same time at a table and received my food hot  than outside in the heat and cold food. Not worth the money spent  and very disappointing.
Connie O.,Pomona  CA,36,3,,7/13/2016,1.0,Didn't expect the shitty service we got here tables werent getting cleaned and when finally was able to get a table server looked like he wasn't even happy to be working here....last time we come to thisBJ I don't recommend it at all..food not the greatest very disappointed
Eleanor S.,Yucaipa  CA,0,10,1,1/9/2017,1.0,So I came on Thursday 1-5-17. It smelled horrible  like if they used a dirty mop to clean the floors. I knew I should have walked out as soon as i smelled that nasty smell. I've gone to 3 other Bj's at different locations. So far this was the worst service ever. So the waitress was blah. And we always order a nutty brunette house beer. It was flat. I told the waitress that the beer was flat and she said that the brew master had said that it was fine and that they don't know where we usually go and that they are the only ones that brew their own beer. Well I think if a customer is complaining that the beer is flat  it is obiously flat. San Bernardino  Moreno Valley and victor villes bj's has been the best bj'S so far  in my opinion. All their devices have been A1. I've just had better service else where  so I expecting the same service. Clearly  not every city is the same.
Alex C.,West Covina  CA,8,125,1485,4/17/2016,3.0,Came for a drink with some compadres. Been a while since I had been here. Service was good.  from what I remember service always took a while.  It was a school night so I ordered the light switch not bad and refreshing. I was one and done but I'll be coming back soon. Keep the light on for me.
Christopher G.,Covina  CA,1120,17,43,8/26/2016,1.0,Worse place ever had crappy service had to complain to the manager 3 times about how bad the service was. Food was late. Drinks we're flat. Servers were bad!!!! Not to mention they had ample time to accommodate a big party. DO NOT COME HERE
Belinda M.,Bellflower  CA,0,3,2,9/11/2016,5.0,Truly enjoyed my sons' 18th birthday celebration!  The hamburgers were amazing along with their famous pizzookie. Thank you  Emy  our waitress for being so funny & helpful. We would come back just to see you!!!
Ruth V.,Los Angeles  CA,71,25,9,9/13/2016,1.0,I'm getting straight to the point/s : Food : Very tasty for a chain & compared to the other restaurants around the food is good . Service : friendly but SLOW ! So far the times I've visited the servers have been sweet but they are not capable of doing a decent job . Ambiance : loud   large groups . Overall : the times I've gone it is because of a birthday dinner  someone taking me out for birthday / date   I would personally not come again !Last visit : party of 4   server took too long to come take our drink order   finally he did but took forever to bring the drinks (about 25 min) . We only went for pizookies   he said the order would take about 5 maybe 10 min to come out   we waited for 40 MINUTES !!! One order came out and then after asking for the other pizookies we had to wait another 15-20 min . Although I was very annoyed I didn't say anything but the waiter noticed and offered to take the sodas off the bill .Overall I will not be visiting again   as I did not find it worth the time .
Pink F.,Montebello  CA,2,17,113,11/25/2016,3.0,soups are so salty and waitress keep getting wrong order beside that everything runs smooth
Jeff T.,San Gabriel  CA,71,304,48,10/25/2016,4.0,BJ's has a surprisingly good and inexpensive lunch. I got a normal sausage  eggs  potatoes  and toast breakfast. I believe it was $8 which is quite reasonable. A much better value than Denny's or IHOP and the quality is better as well. They don't have a very extensive breakfast/brunch menu  but they have tons of lunch options to make up for it. The coffee is a bit weak though.
Bella M.,West Covina  CA,3,33,11,4/3/2016,3.0,Came here on a Saturday evening with a party of 10 and small kids. I give this place 3 stars because the food was good and came to us pretty quick. It's just our server  I believe his name was David  was not his friendliest or helpful. He took everyone's order  my sister and I weren't quite ready so he said he would be back. He never came back to check up on us. Everyone else had their food and he still hadn't taken our order. We had to call him and let him know we're ready.Throughout the evening not once did he come by and ask if everyone was doing okay or if we needed something. We had to constantly be calling him to our table for things we needed. And when we would call him? He always seemed annoyed. Overall service by him was 1 star.I know you shouldn't rate a whole restaurant based off one bad server. But you come to a place to have a good time. One person giving bad service reflects on everyone.
Xavier V.,Azusa  CA,0,4,,9/18/2016,2.0,Don't come on a Sunday poor service takes a hour to get your appatizers and other hours to receive your entree what a lack of service oh and 20 mins to get side of ranch
Sergio B.,Murrieta  CA,128,46,19,12/15/2016,2.0,Well if you look at my reviews I come different BJ's restaurants a lot and 7 out 10 times I'm disappointed in their service but sometimes they surprise me but I probably won't be ever coming back to this location because they can't ever get passed a two even though I try and try again! They took forever to come take my order (15 minutes) then they took forever to bring my order and when they finally did they didn't put in my order only my sons and while I waited for the waiter to come back to follow up so I could tell him.... low and behold 20 minutes later I decided we'll son since you've finished eating already I'm just going to personally walk up to the register and ask for my bill so we can go home. Screw it so over this place!!!
Andy F.,Covina  CA,1,5,1,3/31/2017,1.0,"On multiple occasions  the host has ""forgot to call my name""  or ""was just about to call me"". Bs. I waited 40 mins for a table (eventhough they said 25-30 mins) and when i didnt get called  and i inquired  they said  ""uhhh i can take u to your table"". Unorganized. On this occasion i had a great waiter  total thumbs up. I wish i wouldve asked his name. I ordered a pizza and they gave me a donut with a little cheese sprinkled on top. Their deep dish is embarrassing. My favorite pizza anywhere used to be the bjs buffalo chicken pizza. Now  i couldnt eat more than a slice and a half (theyre tiny btw). I will not be returning. Some type of bad experience has happened 7 out of 8 times. No more benefit of the doubt. I give up. Sad to say cause i actually went in there with a smile on my face cause i knew i was getting my fave pizza. I left with a broken heart and felt like my dreams had been shattered."
Andrew P.,San Marcos  CA,123,448,15,3/18/2016,4.0,I came here with a friend for a late-night dinner  and left pleasantly surprised. My previous experiences at any BJ's location have usually involved terrible service and mediocre food  but this place was decent. We were seated right away  and had a waiter come to the table quickly. The service was great - fast and friendly with no major issues. The food was decent - we opted for some sort of chicken ranch deep-dish pizza. For the price  it was filling and was pretty tasty. Overall  it was a good experience and I'd be happy to come back again.
Rudy B.,La Verne  CA,2,8,2,12/4/2016,1.0,Worst place to go if you have a party more than 6 people ... almost two hours wait for a party of 12 ... appetizer didn't arrive until end of the meal... one of our order came out wrong .. totally ruined our birthday celebration
Jezebel H.,Covina  CA,0,2,,12/27/2016,1.0,So disappointed and still angry on my visit I just had to deal with along with my family.We are rewards members with you guys and come to this location all the time and specifically sit by the bar because it seems that is the only area where you are attended to correctly. Chris at the bar always is on it and this time we choose to sit at the tables we get shitty service.Our server DESIRE rang up our drinks and appetizers in a hurry and NEVER rang up our order. We flagged her down 50 minutes later to check on our food and asked us what our order was and then comes back out and tells us it was her fault she never put our order in. Then asks us if we want to wait another 20 minutes for our food? What question is that to a guest who has already been waiting. She wasn't genuine on her apology and seemed to use the business as an excuse for her mistake. If it is too busy and you can't keep up then ask your co workers for help or where is your manager supporting you if you're still training? I am a general manager in a restaurant and you own up to your mistakes. The manager she brought over to us simply just said she had no excuses for our wait and what happened and I even told her she should ensure she is staffed properly to keep up with their business unless you want to continue having these experiences with other people she gave us a 25 dollar gift card not comping the meal we used it to pay for our bill. And still asked us if we wanted the order in. No longer did any of us want to wait and even if we did we wouldn't have enjoyed it after the service we just recieved. We even told her that this isn't the first time it's happened sitting in the dining tables by the bar. Unfortunately this being the closest location we will just drive to Chino or another BJ'S somewhere else...
Richard T.,Beaumont  CA,0,4,,5/30/2017,4.0,We had the best service from Emy along with some great food. The all you can eat soup and salad was wonderful  try cheddery soup  you have ask for it......so good. Thanks Emy
Katrina S.,Covina  CA,83,43,30,7/17/2016,5.0,Normally I'm always missing a thing or two with my takeout orders but every time I get my order prepared by Chioma  nothing is ever missing. She is always putting the extra care into the orders she gets and you can really tell it was prepared with love. Every time I get takeout I always hope Chioma is working that day so I can get the impeccable service she gives. If you are going to order takeout  definitely request Chioma to prepare it for you!
Shelby R.,Westmont  Pomona  CA,0,4,3,5/24/2017,5.0,Emy is a FABULOUS server/waitress at this BJ's location. Great service. She was very accommodating and friendly...made sure EVERYTHING was just right for me  my father and stepmom. I came in on a Wednesday at 3:00 PM  so that's when she works!
Kimberly D.,Covina  CA,28,1,,6/7/2017,1.0,Took my daughter and granddaughter out tonight for dinner and was greatly disappointed with the food.  I ordered the lemon thyme chicken which was served pretty raw with pink coloring throughout. In addition the entire meal (rice and vegetables) were only slightly warm. I politely asked the waiter if he could take it back for further cooking. He even agreed that it looked raw and apologized. After waiting for only a short period of time he brought it back with one piece that looked grilled  the other looked the same as when it left the table. I cut into both pieces and they were still pink and cool to the touch. My waiter was busy and I asked another employee for the manager who politely asked if I wanted something else. I ordered a pizza. The waiter stated that they would probably take one of the meals off my bill. Oh come on  were they planning on charging me for both? My pizza was cooked perfectly and was delicious. When I received the bill  I was not charged for the chicken  but was charged for the pizza  which happened to be $3.00 more. No further apologies or reduction of bill or maybe even a complimentary dessert would have been a nice gesture. Nothing to make up for my time wasted while two attempts to cook my food failed. Definitely not a restaurant I will recommend or frequent. Very disappointed.
Ray F.,Ladera Ranch  CA,1,5,,10/22/2016,1.0,This restaurant serious blows. Ordered online to avoid the Saturday night crowd. Make the order at 6:29  I'm there by 6:45 the time listed to show up for my order. Big lerp at the to go desk  won't even make eye contact with me so I can pay and be on my way. 10 min go by and female attendant who seems put off that she has to address me finally asks me if I need to make an order. Tell her I ordered online I pay and get change for $100 on a $40 dollar order  all in $5's. She doesnt even count it out. Literally balls it up and slaps it in my hand with the receipt. Felt like i was buying a dime bag on the corner. The kicker is  the pizza was ice cold when i get home. That long 5 min drive on 80 degree night must have just chilled it over.
Andrew S.,Covina  CA,50,12,3,6/23/2016,1.0,"This one star isn\'t for the Bj\'s restaurant as a whole  just their loose end.  I gathered with family to celebrate a birthday and our waiter  Frank couldn\'t have been the absolute worst service I\'ve experienced at this Bj\'s  or any other location.  He had trouble getting down orders and even the simplest request. His presence was very hallow since he seemed completely disinterested in helping us in away. Anytime we asked or question something regarding our order he would say rudely  ""wait. Give me a minute."" Or ""can you let me finish this first?"" Clearly he wasn\'t ready or trained well enough to handle 15/20 people and when it came to delivering the birthday boy\'s Pazookie  Frank simply slammed it in front of him and we had no idea he had even brought it until after we saw that it was hiding somewhere in the center of the table. We sang happy birthday and asked for pictures and his response was  ""eh  I don\'t know. Wait. Hold on."" At which point we didn\'t care to ask for anymore help knowing that he really didn\'t want to help us and he clearly had somewhere else better to be. He made the dinner feel like nothing special and treated us as if we were last table of the night and we were keeping him from going home. Point is  his service as a waiter was displeasing and how we ever got so unlucky  is beyond me.  However  despite Frank; The restaurant never disappoints as a whole. Friendly staff  food is always 100% and looks straight from the menu with REAL quality you can taste. It\'s always been a favorite place to dine for our family which it was why it was no contest when it came to celebrating a birthday; unfortunately we got unlucky this time. Hope to return soon with a better experience ... far better. - XIII"
Breanne M.,Azusa  CA,83,8,1,10/17/2016,1.0,My family and some friends end up showing up there this past weekend we got seated in about 10mins that was great but after that we waited a hour to get our food and then it was cold we got the manager involved but the damage was done even though they tried to fix the problem it's not worth the headache we will not be going back
Ravene A.,Whittier  CA,216,9,,11/25/2016,5.0,It's my first time here! The employees and managers at this place are awesome! We asked for a pizza without mushrooms  and they brought our pizza out WITH mushrooms. :( our waitress noticed immediately that the cooks had messed up and offered to remake it  but it was no big deal and we just picked the mushrooms off! A few minutes later the manager came out and offered us a free dessert! They were so attentive and made sure that we were happy! We will be coming back here all the time!
Mark M.,Inglewood  CA,239,142,67,5/7/2015,2.0,Probably some of the worst bar food I've ever had. I ordered calamari as an appatizer and chicken and Brussel sprouts for lunch. The chicken was way way over cooked to the point that it was real dry and the Brussel sprouts tasted extra bitter. The best part of the meal was the calamari.
Anthony R.,La Puente  CA,0,30,1,11/2/2016,2.0,They'll get a 2 star rating until they ban kids from the bar area. I understand there's tables in the bar area but sometimes you'll be waiting and there's a family of 5 and just the dads drinking. Or the damn kids like screaming. In my opinion take that to the dinning room I'm here for some beers and fun.
Simon L.,Rosemead  CA,69,4,,7/2/2016,1.0,I wish I could give this place no stars. We literally got seated and told our waiter would be right over. 30 minutes later and no waiter showed up. We ended up just walking out and going next door to Chili's.
Priscilla Z.,Los Angeles  CA,765,822,1873,12/18/2014,2.0,Like all chain restaurant  nothing special and nothing good. Except they provide big portion and large amount of calories that are enough for your whole day activity.Had their lunch special  salad with angle hair. The shrimp was like frozen ones  had no taste. And the noodles tasted so bland. No flavor at all  and probably full of empty calories (marked on the menu). Very low quality food. If you have a taste bud  this is not the place you wanna go. I also tried my friend's fries. The thicker ones tasted better  they were very soft. But the thin ones tasted bad as they were not crispy or soft. Sorry that I just don't like this type of chain stores. But for office get-together  I had to go.
Abigail R.,Covina  CA,189,3,,7/1/2016,1.0,If i had the choice of giving no stars i would. Literally no waiter came up to me to even offer a drink. And im still waiting. And its been 30 minutes. This is fucking ridiculous. I even tried calling for one and they straight out ignored me
Tina H.,Temple City  CA,214,124,179,9/6/2016,4.0,I haven't stepped in BJ's after graduation from college  and I don't really recall too much about their food since I am not a beer fan. It's a good experience this time. My bf and I ordered chicken pesto pizza and fried portobello since we are not too starving. The fried portobello taste good but the portobello is relatively small and dry. The pizza is really tasty. I love the crust and bf love the topping  and we both like the satisfying size of it cuz it's huge. Overall  the service is nice and environment is decent.
Leila A.,La Puente  CA,11,55,1,7/24/2016,2.0,The food is good  but the service needs improvement. The servers need to smile and at least pretend they like their jobs. It will help get better tips.
Rene G.,Chicago  IL,53,162,115,8/26/2016,2.0,I hate to be mean  but this place has nothing similar to a Chicago deep pizza as stated in the menu. Atmosphere was great  appetizers a lot to choose from and all good as well. Had a cucumber jalapeno Margarita. good as well. Pizza? ummmm.....I'm from Chicago and this was nothing like a Chicago style deep dish pizza. not even a full twist. More like Pizza Hut's pan pizza with little to no sauce. The crust and ingredients were good  but other than that not much to say. Should have tried something else  but oh well.
Teena N.,Covina  CA,29,5,,3/27/2017,2.0,We hadn't been here for 2 months as the last time our order was really messed up.i ordered something pretty simple a veggie Burger on sourdough and a side of mashed potatoes instead of fries. I placed my to-go order at 8:14 was told 10-15 minutes...arrived at 8:30 called both numbers ..no answer...called again and was to yes we'll bring it right out..after another phone call they brought it out at 9:05... cold  very cold and soggy....yes I could have gone in but have been sick and hadn't brought a sweater!! Food less than standard and service??? Won't be back for a long while...
Laramie L.,West Covina  CA,116,37,23,10/26/2016,3.0,It was a weeknight  so it wasn't crowded  but service was slow. Food was so-so... I remember liking my food more before  but my salad had brown pieces in it and my hubby's beer didn't come out till 30' later...
Elena Z.,Beverly Hills  CA,3,47,19,6/20/2016,1.0,Marlena was really bad. I never call out anyone on reviews but this girl should not be a server. At one point she walked away and rolled her eyes! I would understand if we were a difficult/demanding table but that was not the case. Everything we ordered was missing something or was incorrect. My friend asked for extra dressing on the side and didn't get it  I asked for no tomatoes since I'm allergic and my dish had tomatoes  my other fried asked for cheese and it was never brought. I won't be returning.
Rick M.,Whittier  CA,0,7,2,6/21/2016,1.0,"I promised I would never write a bad yelp review no matter how awful service I may get. Well... thats about to change... by far the worst dining experience I have ever had. To make matters worse it was a birthday dinner that was messed up.1. Table went without soda and water refills for 15-20 minutes  and glasses stayed unfilled for the majority of the dinner. 2. Empty glasses and empty appetizer plates were left at our table for 45 minutes. Multiple servers and runners came to our table to drop food off but not one bothered to pick up a single dish. We ended up just moving the empties over to the empty space on the table connected to ours. (Picture included)3. A bug in one of the drinks and the server said ""oh you don\'t like floaties?"" No sorrys or apologies  just said to move it over to the empty space next to our table and he brought out another. 4. We ordered 3 pizzas for our table. One came out warm. One semi warm and one completely wrong. Our pizza came out with olives and chicken  both of which were not ordered. It felt as if the waiter was confused as to why we would be complaining about getting extra toppings  not even considering that my girlfriend is allergic to olives. 5. We sent the pizza back to be remade since there was no way for my girlfriend to eat it. By the time we got our pizza the way we initially wanted it  all the other members of our group were already done eating.I can honestly say I wont come back to this particular BJs ever again. I wish this would have happened on a different day and not on my girlfriends birthday."
Carlos F.,Azusa  CA,79,291,98,12/30/2013\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I'm sure that the food is still the same: not good. I did have what I love most:Amazing wings. Their Belgian ale  called the Grand Cru  was amazing as the first time  and came in at $10 for the 750. I got to keep the bottle :)I also tried their pot stickers  and they were plump and deliciously filled  though I believe them to be pre-frozen. I'll still keep coming to this place  if even for these few things done right!I've been reluctant to give this place such a favorable rating  but hot dang  the beer and wings are good!On a side note: the American beer noted on my earlier review is called the Brewmaster's Reserve Imperial Red Ale.
Noemi C.,Azusa  CA,3,7,,12/2/2015,1.0,Horrible BJs location!I came in for lunch with my mom and friend and they messed up our order  the waitress was rude  they brought back a burnt burger  they claimed they didn't have a carseat sling (when I had used it a few days prior)  and when I contacted headquarters they claimed that I received courtesy cards and that the manager spoke to me  which is a complete lie!!!! Seriously this is the most unprofessional business I have ever dealt with! DONT GO HERE!
Maribel C.,La Puente  CA,1,16,16,3/10/2017,2.0,"I get it  it\'s Friday night and it\'s busy as hell... I expect to wait a little longer than usual no biggie. Our waitress was nice and took our order pretty quick after we sat. Then the problems began  we were a party of 5 my sister and ordered a Med pizza no tomatoes. We wait  it comes we have tomatoes  we tell the waitress  she apologizes and bring us another pizza about 15min later then... no pepperoni!!!! What the hell! We wait another 20 min!!!! I\'m not one to complain and be rude because I\'m in customer service myself but this was not ok... by the time we finally got the ""correct pizza"" which was the 3rd one I was over it. I had picked at everyone\'s food and was full  I asked for a box and got it almost 10min later. We also ordered desert which we never even got!! The manager was apologetic  compt us the pizza and gave us a discount on our other meals. I really do appreciate the discount but it still wasn\'t worth the wait. Don\'t know if I\'ll be coming back to this location."
Nick S.,Covina  CA,0,50,,10/10/2016,4.0,The food is great  drinks are ok and the service is mostly excellent. The lines to get in well that's a good sign very popular place to go. I only come here for office parties  or someone's retirement party now. Trying to go on a date here it's too loud not as bad as Fridays restaurant.  The pizzas are one of the best items they have  and if you order beer get it fresh from the tap.....
Art R.,El Monte  CA,0,4,,4/30/2017,2.0,Just had dinner here one of my favorite places to eat. Has the prime rib something I normally don't eat. It was cold  when I order my pizookie to go it was all crumbled in a to go container and the ice cream was almost all melted.
Harry H.,Dallas  TX,0,2,,6/21/2016,5.0,"These five stars are for the restaurant industry employees. This post is for all you ""self entitled"" people who think its someone else\'s job to make you happy. Yeah  you go out to eat and want good food  good service  but nobody owes you anything. Thing\'s sometimes don\'t go right it\'s called life get use to it. I mean  what type of person are you that gets mad over food. It\'s food! Its not your house  your family or your health. I\'ll be damned if my food doesn\'t come out right and ask for a manager and leave a bad review on a server who didn\'t even cook your food. It\'s real simple  want thing\'s done specifically to your liking? Stay home and cook it yourself and then serve yourself  that way if anything goes wrong you can complain to yourself about the food and service. Keep it up servers and cooks  there\'s just unhappy people out there who like well done steak\'s!"
Krystal M.,Ventura  CA,27,29,19,9/12/2016,5.0,This place is awesome. Great food  great lunch specials  great beer and amazing service. Everyone seems to really like their job which makes for a better experience for their customers. I typically get the lunch combo half asparagus and portobello salad and half the California Club flat bread. SO good!!! Keep up the good work!!!
Jack N Mary Z.,Glendora  CA,283,470,1283,12/5/2014,3.0,Okay  as we all know  where there's beer there is noise. LOTS OF NOISE!!! so  what's the big deal? Well  If I'm just there for dinner  and ONLY dinner... its so annoying. The way the restaurant is build  its open and all the noise from the bar travels throughout. Additionally  the wait is long sometimes. Other than that... we are usually lucky with the waiters. Very social and sweet.
Chantal S.,Corona  CA,3,5,14,8/28/2016,5.0,Steven P. was such an awesome waiter! He was really attentive and made sure we were taken care of the entire time. Our group was really big and kind of disruptive which is usually an issue in family restaurants but he was still constantly checking up on us and being very sweet! Overall great service and food! would definitely come here again!
Kimberly H.,Beaumont  CA,0,21,,8/13/2017,1.0,I honestly wish I could not leave a star at all. My cousin and I went yesterday at 1:30pm to enjoy lunch. Once we arrived we were seated immediately. It wasn't very busy and there was a lot of staff just standing around talking. There was a table in use by a family right next to us and had a waiter helping us. We had 6 waiters walk by us and just look at us. We tried to flag on down about 15 mins after sitting there because we it was a long drive and we were thirsty and they ignored us. 30 mins had past and still no one even came to take our drink order or acknowledge us at all.

Joseph S.,Brooklyn  NY,6,2,2,7/12/2016,1.0,"The night manager at bjs in west Covina was very rude and un professional. I was there 7/11 at around 530 I ordered a deep dish pizza and a float. I was disappointed with it the pizza so i did not eat it. So when it came down for the check the server said i still had to pay for the drink. I said no so the manager came over and said "" did u enjoy the drink and said thats y u had to pay"" then he said if i dont pay i am stealing and came out and wrote down my plate number and make of car then proceeded to wave goodbye with a kiss. He embarrassed me in front of my company."
Pete V.,Beaumont  CA,0,59,19,11/20/2015,1.0,Bartender Mike needs some serious guest service training! Ask what I wanted then walked away while i was in mid sentence ordering  only to help someone else. Served a sour beer to the party next to me  guy complains he then pours another beer and damn near sticks his nose in the beer smelling it to make sure it was good! Wow! Not a good look! Female server walks up to the server well says the beer she's picking up to serve to guest seems warm. Bartender proceeds to tell her to serve it  it's not gonna kill them they can deal with it! Wow!! This guy should not be behind a bar! He's a manager's nightmare!
Joanne A.,CRANBERRY TWP  PA,74,234,841,12/26/2014,4.0,When I think of BJs  I instantly think pizookie! I'm pretty sure this place invented pizookie (cookie baked on a pizza pan topped with ice cream). Of course there's a regular serving that can be shared and there's a pizza size for a big party. It is unlike any cookie sundae or sundae desserts you've ever had. Definitely indulge and try to save space for this dessert. The server will usually ask you in the middle of your meal if you want it  so that they can start making it. The new salted caramel is my fave although all of them are delish!They are also known for their pizza. The pizza dough is soft yet the edges has some crisp to them. It's not like a hard crust on the edge  so you can definitely eat it even those who usually don't eat the crust. The pizza is not greasy. Their flatbread and thin crusts are also very good. I've never had the deep dish as I think the regular pizza has enough dough. My family's fave is the classic combo hand-tossed pizza. It's almost a meat lovers with mushrooms. They definitely have an extensive pizza menu.I've never tried their steak or seafood but my family says they like the food in general. They have a big bar area  lots of TVs and a big space. Definitely great for watching sports and celebrating birthdays  etc.I can see why the service can be deemed inconsistent as not all servers are alike. Luckily  the times I've been here  the servers I've had were great: friendly  attentive  knew the menu. There was no wait the last time we went for Christmas Eve  but other times there is a long wait esp during the summer and game nights.
Patricia T.,West Covina  CA,130,2,,4/18/2017,1.0,This place is one of my favorites to eat  but i recently went to dinner with my family and we got seated and waited for 30 mins and never got menus or anything so we got up and left  all while the waiters stood by just talking to each other.
Olivia C.,Las Vegas  NV,63,8,,10/15/2016,4.0,They got us in quickly on a Friday night as a group of 17 without a reservation. Ivan was our server and was amazing!
Jonathan U.,Baldwin Park  CA,540,364,423,9/21/2013,4.0,Came here on a friday night and the service and food was incredible. Ive been here plenty of times and im finally writing this review.The wait was about 20 minutes for my party of 3. As a group we ordered the great white pizza  lettuce wraps  nachos and jeremiah red beer. Lettuce wraps tasted great. Probably one of the best ive had. The great white pizza was incredible. Im actually writing this review to tell people how great that pizza is. Im not sure what was in it but i think it consist of chicken  alfredo sauce  tomatoes  mushroom  and garlic. The blend of ingredients complemented each other well. It was a deep dish pizza that was perfectly baked. The nachos was nothing to rave about but still tasted great nonetheless. I dont drink but the other 2 people i was with throughly enjoyed the jeremiah red. Sadly  all 3 of us were on a diet so none of us ordered the pizookie. Maybe next time. Im definitely coming back during happy hour to get the great white pizza.
Freya F.,La Puente  CA,32,8,,9/2/2016,2.0,First time there  so will perhaps give other locations a try. Food was horribly bland. I ordered food that is hard to screw up  yet it wasn't good and only half my order was prepared as requested. Waitstaff was nice enough but service was rather slow for reasons I could not ascertain.
Jennifer R.,Pomona  CA,0,5,2,3/22/2017,1.0,I understand places like this are very busy  I understand the workers get frustrated with customers  I also understand big parties are a bit more frustrating then usual because of multiple orders. Our food was cold  the drinks were late  one order was so late we had all finished eating and then it came to our table so we had to ask for it to go. Once we let the manager know we were unhappy with the service and that we specifically asked not to be comped of any meals because we still ate it  the waiter comes back with one big check with some meals comped. It was a nice gesture and I appreciated it  but the waiter then had to separate the orders  which was obviously frustrating him as he shook his head constantly and tossed chairs around at the table he sat in to figure all the orders out and which ones we comped. I'm guessing there was a lack of communication because before we started ordering food we let them know ahead of time there was 4 separate orders. Overall we don't blame our waiter  we let multiple staff members know of missing food and drinks  the manager ended up having ME separate our checks and just left the waiter to deal with the rest. Your staff is only as good as the people or person running the establishment. If management couldn't help much  don't expect anyone else to.
Monica H.,Huntington Beach  CA,4,50,73,11/23/2015,1.0,I had late lunch with my son here. He ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo which came with bread. The bread was burnt so asked for another and it was the same way. Overall  customer service was bad.
Rick V.,La Puente  CA,0,9,4,3/21/2017,4.0,Had lunch there yesterday  as always great tasty appetizers and my beef dip was delicious! Our server Steven did an excellent job too. Would always recommend bjs!
JJ J.,Glendale  AZ,0,13,13,3/19/2016,2.0,"We\'ve eaten at other BJ\'s before and have always enjoyed our meal. This location I hope is the only exception. As normal we were prepared to wait for a table. For a good meal its worth it but not at this location. The wait for our meal was over 45 minutes. It must have sat in the kitchen for a while because the Brussels sprouts were slightly warm  and the ""loaded"" baked potato wouldn\'t even melt the butter/sour cream and the ribs were very dry. My wife has the chicken tacos which were cold also. In all  it was a very disappointing dinner. We\'ll be avoiding this location in the future. The service seemed adequate for how busy it was but if was better our meal would have been warm."
Joshua L.,La Puente  CA,54,7,1,2/28/2016,2.0,Not the best service First we sat underneath Ac vent and it got cold.. I thought hey we will wait for the waiter to come to take our drinks and let him/her know if we can switch seats... 10 mins pass no one came and we decide to move the next booth.. One seat over.. Then 10 mins later a waiter came took our drinks and apologize because he thought we sat in different booth and didn't see anyone there...Ok we understand took our drinks and food order since we already decide what to eat. Then a new waiter came in and said she taken over and I guess this was her section.. Came off a little rude didn't care having great time with my familyThen our food came out and we order pasta and was suppose to come with bread and the guy who bought our food we ask him and he said oh the bread is coming out  ok we ate and half way thru our meal we notice no one has check up on us or brought over the rest plate .. So I had to wave a different waiter and ask him. 15 min later then our waiter came and brought us the rest of our plate... By then we finish or drinks and she didn't come by to ask if we like a refill. I just ask for the managerManager came buy and did her manager thing which was really good .. Kudos to Kathy!!! very professional  apologize ... Then she left  10 mins after she left no one still check up on us or gave us a refill  ... Waive another waiter down and ask for the manager again Ok waiter mess up  there still solutions to fix the problem  at least come by and still check up on us.. It doesn't even have to be you the table behind us had a different waiter and he still can check up on us in case we scared her off or being that annoying customer that all waiter get and everyone decide to avoiding this table.. I just want another beer and so did my familyAll restaurant problems can be fix.. There is a solution don't worry
Milani A.,Baldwin Park  CA,35,1,,4/10/2017,2.0,My family and I went there last night. I have to say I'd rather not go to this BJs again. I went to the bar and ordered a beer. Once I had the beer it was warm. The worker at the bar and the guy manager there even said that people have been complaining about it. I even overheard one of the waiters come and say someone wanted a new beer because theirs was warm. So the manager tells me he's going to go and check out the back and see what's going on. After 10 minutes he never came back but I was being called to my table. So when I went to my table I told my waitress about the situation. She was apologetic and said she would see what's going on and offered to get me a new beer. About ten minutes later she comes back  with no new beer  and says that the manager and whoever else is saying that they haven't heard of that problem at all! I kind of got offended as if they were calling me a liar! So long story short another manager came to talk to me I got a free beer like an hour later..I don't care for there customer service..
Alexandra R.,Glendora  CA,112,107,171,7/14/2016,5.0,"I know we\'ve been here plenty of times by this time pretty much all was great! Frank was our server and he spoiled us all night with attentive service and patience as we figured out what to order. He knew the old beer that I used to get...""lindenmens framboise""? It\'s a beer that tastes like a cranberry wine. I just like how he kept checking on us and submitting each order as we asked for it. It was spaced out allowing us to conquer one plate at a time. Thanks to Frank for his great service!"
Lourdes R.,Los Angeles  CA,1,15,13,8/11/2016,3.0,"My god I came for a late night dinner... I waited for two hours for my food. Don\'t get me wrong drinks were fast to come but dam people I came to a restaurant.... To eat!!!! Not drink if I wanted to drink I might as well gone to a bar. I was starving ... Well after the whole ordeal and a couple of drinks later this great waitress comes by says ""hey sorry about the wait but here are some wings"" so bill comes after the food I waited so long for and the check comes out to be about 70 bucks let me tell u I was going to check in before I got here to get a free appetizer I mentioned to the manager the situation she took of the appetizer off as a courtesy ... I was originally going to check in into Yelp for and bam a slap in the face she said oh u can\'t do that so was it a win or lose situation ?"
Lorena S.,Los Angeles  CA,8,37,164,1/27/2016,5.0,School fundraiser are the best when they are at this BJ's. Service is always great here & food never gets old. Even with a school fundraiser a pitcher of light switch & blonde is a must. And the kids can never leave without sharing an Oreo Pizookie.
David S.,Baldwin Park  CA,16,63,66,9/29/2015,4.0,I am a pretty hard man to please when it comes to customer satisfaction  but tonights experience was nearly perfect. Walking in the hostesses said hi and looked at us weird (might have been because I was wearing a sweater and bball shorts) and then finally I told them we were a party of two.    Once seated  I grabbed the menu that was given to me. It was immediately noticeable of the cleanliness of it. Greasy stick trap. It is my biggest pet peeve to have a dirty menu.   The waitress was amazing  got what we wanted  when we wanted it. Fast  friendly with a smile. Bwthrooms were clean  sad design but it works.   Nor too much to complain about her  dirty menus  the posession of your daughter made it easier for youbto accept
Alyssa L.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,1,43,8,1/15/2016,2.0,"Never really cared for BJ\'s and tonight just valid my feelings. Came here for both of my aunts birthday. (Their choice) Friday night so of course it\'s busy.Our server was kind  but seemed way overwhelmed. He only took half of the tables order and left and came back later to order rest of the table. (So our whole table was not given food at the same time)My aunt ordered pizza  the pizza was basically just bread and cheese. There was no pizza sauce in sight. I ordered chips and guacamole and their new Jalapeo Cucumber Margarita. The chips were STALE. The guacamole was bland. The grocery store guacamole has more flavor.Our waiter never came to check on us and ask how our food was. He refilled our waters in the beginning  but pretty much disappeared after serving us our food.Another person came over to drop off the ""birthday pazookies"" and left. Uhhh I guess they weren\'t in the mood to sing? I\'m not sure. But yet on the other side of the room we hear a waiter singing happy birthday at the top of their lungs. Can we have him please? Not impressed with the Franchise. I personally will never come to BJ\'s."
Maripily W.,Hilo  HI,3,30,35,7/13/2016,5.0,Great service by Steven our waiter. Food came in a timely manner and delicious. We were sat in a booth that was extremely cold. The AC couldn't be adjusted because it would throw off all the others in the restaurant so Steven offered to move us to a different table and threw in a pizookie for my son and I. We'll return and ask for Steven. Thank you Steven.
Sandy K.,Whittier  CA,2981,1573,9337,4/10/2013,4.0,Came in for a luncheon with eight of my clients.. We were seated at a booth but it was to tight so the waitress put together several tables to accommodate our party.The decor and openness of this BJ's is really eye appealing and the bar is cool looking. Menu at BJ's is large but they list the calories which I actually think is beneficial. I ordered the Thai mango chicken avocado salad and it was yummy and tasty - about half the calories of some to the other salads but delish.The service was spot on and I was surprised BJ's didn't tack on a automatic gratuity to the tab since it was a larger party. The total came out to just under $200.00 and everyone enjoyed the food. I would definitely come back again to BJ's for a business luncheon or personal meal.
Edward P.,Long Beach  CA,17,5,,7/21/2016,2.0,Came here for the lunch specials i got chicken alfredo & my fiance got spaghetti with meatballs. The meatballs tasted like package meatballs and the chicken alfredo sauce was horrible! The rolls on our plate tasted better then the food. So disappointed
Alexis O.,Covina  CA,11,8,,3/11/2017,1.0,"I wish I could rate this location 0 stars. I had a TERRIBLE experience!!!! To make a very long story short:- I ordered a pizzookie platter and patiently waited with my boyfriend and his 2 little brothers for about 35 minutes-Katie  our waitress  came out to apologize for the wait and told us ""they are scooping the ice cream right now""-Katie did NOT come back for another 20 minutes and when she did  she told us the pizzookie had NOT been made at all- Sean  the manager  came out and we told him we were going to leave because we didn\'t want to have to wait another 30 min- However  Katie came back a few minutes later to tell us she could have the pizzookie out and it would be on the house- We decide to wait and after 20 min I ask Katie how much longer it will take and if she is positive a pizzookie is being made because we told her manager we were LEAVING. She told us she is POSITIVE because the pizzookie is out of the oven.- She comes back 10 min later to tell us the pizzookie was NOT made.We left immediately after having wasted almost 2 hours of our time. I am definitely not returning to this ridiculous place. Moral of the story: Don\'t expect your food to come out if it is a busy day. Also  the waiters are liars. If they tell you the pizzookie is out of the oven and almost ready it\'s because it\'s out of the oven barley being put into the oven."
Lupe A.,West Covina  CA,0,35,2,5/30/2016,1.0,I am so disappointed!! We placed an Online order tonight and when my hubby got to BJ's they could not find our order. He gave them our order number which we got off our email confirmation but they Still could not locate our order. So we went back Online and placed the order again...still nothing. So after my husband argued with the manager  he gave up and left.   I just don't understand if we are given a confirmation number off of an email from your restaurant/location... how can you 'not find it'???  Not sure if we will ever order to-go again!!
Diane V.,La Puente  CA,28,8,3,1/20/2016,1.0,If it isn't their table  they don't care about you. Our waiter was great. One who dropped off our food  not at all. Unfortunate. *paraphrased from an earlier  yelp deleted  review.
Eunice M.,Baldwin Park  CA,1,2,,8/30/2016,5.0,Usually I don't write Yelp reviews but for this BJ's I must. Not only was the wait super quick but the staff was friendly. Must give an extra applaud to our waiter Steven(talk dark and handsome) for amazing service. Thank you Steven !!
Julie L.,San Dimas  CA,0,4,,7/16/2017,2.0,"I placed an order to go on the phone. When I arrived to pay and receive my food at the ""take out"" counter  there was a gentleman looking at a menu  trying to decide what to order. The senseless BJ\'s girl didn\'t have the basic customer service skills to inform the man to let her know when he had decided what he wanted to order and then assist me. I stood in line for 7 minutes like this. After 7 minutes  the customer asked if he could taste test a beer  she had a sample cup brought to him  he sipped it  kept looking through the menu and eventually finished his beer. The entire time  the girl was talking to a male coworker and I was ignored. The is was at no fault the customers. He had no idea I was even behind him. She on the other hand  continuously glanced at me then looked away. By the time he ordered beer to go and left  I had waited in line for 27 minutes. I felt completely ignored. She never even said thank you for waiting or sorry that took so long. Please  please  please teach you STAFF basic customer service skills. Since when did beer taste testing become allowed at the to go counter? Rediculous. Sad. Unprofessional."
Cj C.,Griffith Park  Los Angeles  CA,2,6,4,4/30/2016,1.0,"I usually don\'t post anything on Yelp but today I was feeling a little generous. So today being Saturday I knew it was going to be busy so I decided to do the take-out service BJ\'s has. I ordered a large pizza so when I got to the take-out area to pay I used my credit card  but my card has been having issues so it was not swiping properly. I ask the girl who was helping me out if she could type it in manually instead of continuously swiping so she asked this chubby dude with slicked hair and feminine voice if she can do that  he abruptly answered ""if it doesn\'t swipe it doesn\'t work"" in a pretty rude manner. I then took out my second card and was having the same issue so I told them ""why don\'t you use the receipt paper and then slide it"" and wa lah after 20 attempts it worked  I wanted to tell them ""if they put in a little effort you might have a successful outcome"" but I just kept my mouth shut. I wait  get my pizza and when she hands it to me the bottom of the box has melted cheese and also on the top  I just wanted to get out of there so I asked the same chubby dude with slicked hair and feminine voice if I can get a bag for my pizza and he then replied with ""No we don\'t have bags for that!"" I then got a little ticked off and told them ""well can you guys at least clean the box!"" They did so but when I got home to eat the pizza it seemed as if Stevie wonder cut it himself and passed the cooked pizza to Ray Charles to box it up. Pretty disappointed with the pizza and especially the service. Bottom line if you\'re going to act like a male diva during work please do not work in a customer service industry. Don\'t plan on returning."
Katrina S.,West Covina  CA,2,4,,1/28/2017,1.0,"Let me start off by saying me and my husband are NOT picky eaters. We called and waited about 10 min because the girl on the phone said she would ask if there are delivery drivers. She hung up on me. I called back and ordered. Should\'ve turned my head at that point. She didn\'t know what she was doing and I was very patient and very polite. I got there and asked her a question about the pizookie. I asked how it worked since it was my first time ordering take out from here. She replied with ""I haven\'t scooped out your ice cream yet."" Not something you say in customer service. My husbands crispy jalapeo burger was a disaster. It wasnt even spicy and the jalapeos were canned.....what!!?? Didnt have what I wanted so I went with the brewhouse deluxe burger. Wow what a shame to be calling that deluxe or a burger in the same name. Shame. My burger had ONE piece of ""bacon"" (looked like fried cheese  tasted like feet) my bread was soggy from the pickles because the burger was made up of pickles and lettuce. I asked for it well done and it looked like it was cooked for 5 min. Your fries suck. They always have. Can\'t argue with that but at least make an effort. The stuffed mushrooms were ok. The pizookies are lies just a regular cookie and I will NEVER order those again. The only thing good about this meal is that I got to be disappointed at home instead of there because this was just absolutely ridiculous. I GAVE ALL MY FOOD TO THE DOG!! I believe this might be the last time I order from this establishment."
Courtney S.,Irvine  CA,0,2,,2/18/2017,5.0,Steven is literally the best server I've had at this restaurant. He is attentive  engaging  and totally deserves a promotion to cocktail server. I always get my order messed up here but today with Steven it was perfect. And when I left my sweater he ran it out to me in the parking lot. He made me laugh and that's what makes the magic happen for me.
Nancy C.,Alhambra  CA,16,111,666,11/9/2015,2.0,Supposed to 4 stars but then my waitress told me my burn order was how is supposed to be burn the bottom the two gentlemen sit next to me insist for her to replace it. He can not eat the new order she brought out needed to pack it to go she came in a box for me to pack it myself the two gentlemen didn't like it because they told me that she's supposed to packet for me. I don't mind but since they don't think I should I took off two stars for bad serve. Foid was good I like it unburned salmon tastes good and moist. Love it!
Candice B.,La Puente  CA,96,17,17,1/10/2015,4.0,The food was great we order the great white pizza add olives and avocado egg rolls. our wait for a table on a Saturday night was about 30mins it's took 15 mins to get our food. Our drinks were always filled which was awesome. They forgot our salads but by the time we finished our avocado egg roll and started on our pizza we were full. The manager came up to the table to apologize he was so nice and we can't wait to come back.
Laila S.,Rosemead  CA,612,158,860,3/3/2016,5.0,My boyfriend brought me here last night to watch the Clippers vs Oklahoma City Thunder on the big screen TV  and we really enjoyed ourselves. The bartenders were really attentive and the Piranha ales tasted really good with our deep dish pizza. I really liked that we were able to order food at the bar while watching the game on the big screen.
Nancy B.,West Covina  CA,0,2,,7/1/2016,5.0,I come here pretty often but  the service stood out today. Thanks for such an awesome experience  Steven P.!
Nan S.,Los Angeles  CA,0,12,4,1/15/2017,2.0,Unable to give an estimated seating time  appetizer served with no plates  had to wait until a server passed before purchasing could get appetizer plates  was brought big plates instead of appetizer plates. Avocado Egg-rolls had bad rotten avocado in it. Very disappointed with quality of food and service. Can't get a server until one passes by.
Cris V.,Whittier  CA,90,11,3,6/12/2016,2.0,I refuse to come back after ordering online. Online app was pretty clear and detailed. I ordered two entres and an appetizer. Upon getting there my wife gets out and goes in to get the food 30min after ordering. I'm waiting in the parking lot for another 25 minutes for the food. She mentioned that the lady argued that we didn't order an apetizer and I brushed it off as maybe it was my error. Went home and ate and left it alone. The next day I checked my emails and I did in fact order an apetizer and paid for it! They pretty much stole from me! I refuse to go to any place that is going to steal like that especially after that lady argued with my wife that we didn't order an app.
Janet M.,West Covina  CA,0,2,,4/16/2016,1.0,This is the first time that I've had a bad experience in this location. The first sever (Samantha) was great! Very attentive and very energetic  even though it was busy. She was sent home and the waitress that we had after could not be understood at all. I don't remember her name but was not helpful. It took over an hr to get our dessert!!!! And even after the manager came in person to tell us she would personally take care of it she had someone else do it. It wasn't just us but the table beside us also had bad service. After getting out dessert we asked to speak to a manager and they could not find her. She walked right by us like nothing. If you guys know it's going to be busy make sure you have extra staff on call and other managers to help out too.
Wendy F.,San Dimas  CA,0,3,,7/11/2016,1.0,"Beware the to go ordering! Placed an order on line  after joining their new rewards program  my husband drove the rt 10 miles and grabbed the bags. The guy didnt go over the order so when we unpacked the bags the $11 flatbread pizza was missing and the order of calamari was tiny  maybe 8 rings  and it cost about $11. We called and i spoke to a manager that never appologized and sounded like he didn\'t give a crap. I drove back  and was just handed the pizza and calamari  no apology  again. I asked about the rewards point i was supposed to receive and she knew nothing about the program and started guessing  ""um maybe the points show up in about a week?"" I told her i was very unhappy  i had been very inconvenienced and wasn\'t offered anything or apologized to. Wont be going back there for a looooong time!"
John D.,Riverside  CA,1,20,,12/6/2016,4.0,Party of 20 went here after a funeral on a Thursday at forest lawn   we called at 2 and by 2:30 they had a table for us . Good food and great service  several of us were able to still get the lunch specials.
Martina H.,Los Angeles  CA,0,2,,1/5/2017,1.0,Came to BJ's to have our usual BJ's specialty pizza and their delicious beginners appetizer  this was our first time at this particular location in West Covina  hate to say that it was a very disappointing dinner and visit. The mozzarella sticks  boneless wings  and pizza where cold when they brought it to our table! We told the gentleman who brought us our food that the sticks where cold and he graciously brought a new order of cheese sticks which we where grateful for however  even then the cheese sticks where not warm enough to where the cheese was melted. Solid cheese is not what is expected in a mozzarella cheese sticks order. We also then realized our wings where just as cold and mentioned it to our waiter for the second time. Discarding the cheese sticks we then told him we didn't want a new order  we just would like him to take them and re-heat them. Of course he did but. Sad to say when he brought them back 4 minutes later they still weren't hot enough. We then just decided to ask for a box and take the remaining pieces home and just heat it and home and call it a day. We didn't make a big deal over it  it was obvious we weren't getting anywhere after waiting 45 min to get seated and having to take our food back two time we just were not in the mood. So we sucked it up and just left. I can see It wasn't the waiters fault so we still tipped him generously but sad to say we left very unsatisfied.
ED L.,Los Angeles  CA,917,707,2047,10/2/2012,5.0,This is probably one of the most busiest BJ's restaurant I have been to. I have been here for happy hour  lunch  and dinner. And each time the place is filled and is full of energy! I like it.They have happy hour special drinks either by the bottle or in a pitcher. The food is good  and the service is awesome. All the waiters/waitresses are very friendly. They constantly check up on you to make sure all is fine.I've ordered pasta  and sandwiches here before. The prices are decent at around $10.00 for lunch specials  and probably about $15.00 for regular entrees. My pasta was tasty with enough flavor... and my sandwich (half) was a turkey cobb which comes with your choice of soup and fries or potato wedges. I chose their Tortilla soup which was delicious. It was hot and spicy with enough kick to it. It was so good that I had to ask for seconds which (they don't offer) I had to order another one. The turkey cobb was fresh. The half sandwich was large enough to be a whole. The food came out after a decent amount of time waiting. The place is clean  and there is an abundant amount of seating for everybody. Well  sometimes there is still a wait depending on the time of arrival. I really like the ambiance of the restaurant. I felt comfortable and relaxed sitting inside. They had LCD TVs hanging which is awesome for happy hour and sporting events. I definitely will give this place two thumbs up! I will come back whenever I have the opportunity.
JoshuaYodaman T.,West Covina  CA,25,24,8,8/1/2015,1.0,Absolutely taken back by this experience. I walked in with my 2 year old and wife and was immediately seated on a Saturday evening. Check in time promptly at 530 as planned. We were dumped rudely by our runner who walked away before we were even seated and didn't tell us our servers name or ask us if we wanted drinks.15 minutes after being seated we were finally asked if we wanted drinks or appetizers. We order our 2 year Olds food  drink and appetizer first to keep him entertained. 20 minutes to get drinks and dumped off to another server. (Still haven't gotten 2 year Olds ANYTHING)It's 615 at this point 45 minutes after we were seated and a random guy from the kitchen walks out with my main course. The last thing I ordered..... this place needs to get their stuff together.
Yuka N.,Brea  CA,314,440,1691,4/24/2015,1.0,I usually go to the BJ's in the City of Industry but I went to this one since it's closer to my house.  Parking sucks!!! I went on a Friday evening around 6'ish. 15 minute wait  which wasn't too bad.  The server was nice. We ordered the calamari  2 beers and those came out quickly. We also ordered the Best Beginnings appetizer platter. Somehow the food got lost back in the kitchen area and it took forever. The server came to apologize and offered a free dessert. The manager with the blonde hair came over to our table and it seemed like she was in a hurry  asked if we were ok and didn't apologize. That's bad customer service! We told our server and she brought out the Sr. manager. That lady with the dark hair was friendly and she apologized.  We got a free salted caramel Pizookie. I'm never going back to this Bj's ever again.
Alex R.,Glendora  CA,0,12,9,8/5/2015,2.0,Came here for mom's b day. There seems to be enough staff  but wait for additional drinks and some food was also a long wait. Calamari dish looked skimpy. Manager helped out after voicing concerns. He was very professional.
Jill A.,Spokane  WA,77,12,,2/29/2016,4.0,All 4 of these stars are for our server Harold. If it weren't for him  I would have given this place 1 star. I used to come here at least once week  but the last couple of years the quality of service has gone down to 1 star. And forget about talking to a manager... They will be conveniently unavailable. If we do head back to this BJ's it will only be if Harold is working and has a table in his section.
Ady M.,Covina  CA,1,17,15,5/21/2016,3.0,I like ordering the grilled chicken pasta to go from here since it's so close to my home. I get it is always busy so it's cool that they have that curbside service  when they answer. Had to walk in after being on hold for a while this time.
Gary G.,West Covina  CA,0,7,,12/18/2016,1.0,Just horrible. This is based on their take out service which sucked balls! They were quick to take my money and slooooww to bring out my order. I waited for 30 minutes for my food and when they did bring it out it was missing an entr. The server took another 10 minutes to get it. I called to complain to the manager (Sean Maisto?) after being put on hold for another 10 minutes. He offered to email me a courtesy card to make up for the bad service  which I still haven't received. Got home and the food was awful. If you want take out from a restaurant in the eastland center go to Chili's. I wish there was a negative star for this review.
Ashley N.,Greenville  SC,80,329,247,7/13/2015,3.0,So unimpressed!!While in town my mother and I stopped in for a quick beer and some Togo food. We sat up at the bar since it was a fairly busy night. Once we sat down  it took another customer flagging down a bartender to get us menus. Mind you he watched us sit down and had walked past us 3 times. I have been to this restaurant on the east coast and they were not nearly as rude. He gave us menus but in the meantime another gentlemen who had been very busy came over to help us. My mother ordered a goose island and I got BJs peach beer. For our Togo food I ordered an ahi tuna salad and my mother a cherry salmon entree. When we got our Togo food there were no utensils in the bag so our server went and got us some. Once we got back to the hotel I dived into my salad. The lettuce tasted dirty and there minimal to no dressing on it at all. I know that the foodservice here can be good but was lacking this experience.
Leo C.,Los Angeles  CA,1041,629,3439,10/6/2012,4.0,I really like coming to BJ's for its casual sports bar atmosphere and great micro brewed beer selections. They also have excellent appetizers and food for watching sporting events on their many LCD TVs. This is my first time here at BJ's in Covina. It's also the busiest that I've visited and we were fortunate to get seated immediately. Because its located in a large shopping lot  there's plenty of available parking. What I like about BJ's is that they have great variety and selection of handcrafted beers. You can even combine the different varieties of beers into glass or pitcher (half and half) to create an more unique delicious flavor. Make sure to try it on your next visit to BJ's. My favorites are the Harvest Hefeweizen and Nutty Brewnette ale  so smooth  lightly sweet and refreshing. Prices weren't to bad $5.50 pint and $16 pitcher. For appetizers  we ordered avocado egg roll  calamari and ahi poke which were all tasty and satisfyingly good. Since we were already starting to get full from the beer and appetizers we ordered the black and bleu flat bread pizzas and BBQ chicken salad. Good portions  healthy and very delicious.Service is usually pretty decent  but today was exceptionally above and beyond its norm. They accidentally made a mistake on one of my orders and I informed the waitress. A few minutes later the manager came out  apologize for the order and hand delivered my correct order in person. Wow! That's great customer service and worth 4 stars.We were to full for dessert and the chocolate chip pizookie with double scoops of ice cream is to die for here. Overall  we had a great time and experience. I will definitely be back.
Tom H.,West Covina  CA,0,14,22,7/8/2016,3.0,The service here is good. The staff seems very helpful. The drinks a good and the appetizers are tasty. This is directed at BJs as a whole  the menu seems sort of bland or lacking imagination. The menu in years past seemed to offer more variety and a good selection of choices to fit your mood. In the last year or so it seems that the menu has been reduced to burgers  pizza and pasta dishes. It just seems to be lacking originality and flavor.
Leilani K.,Diamond Bar  CA,63,27,27,6/2/2015,2.0,I'd like to say that the service here was decent. We came at an odd hour 3pm on a Thursday  suffice it to say that it wasn't too crowded...but they seemed to have plenty of work going. We ordered a couple waters  and just appetizers  since we both weren't too hungry. Well  that was our mistake...too much food! A good mistake to be sure  but one we'll keep in mind next time. My real gripe is the bill. While the paper bill itself was accurate  once checking the statement I used to pay for this meal  I was surprised to find that the tip was not how I remember it. As a sidenote  my tip for our small (easy) meal was a standard 15% and we stayed for maybe 45 minutes when it wasn't full. The mistake wasn't exorbitant  not enough to call management...but it also wasn't what I wrote...it was more. So this review is for the management: make sure your staff reads the receipts carefully enough to not overcharge your guests. It leaves a bad taste in their mouth and they likely will hesitate to return.
Erma R.,La Puente  CA,8,10,3,10/10/2014,3.0,Strawberry lemonade was yummyAvocado rolls are my fav but were pretty over cooked here. Service wasn't the best. S'mores peanut butter pozookie was really good. Came around 11pm tho a hour before they were closing. No wait
Naisi Cece M.,Corona  CA,59,16,7,12/30/2016,1.0,My husband & I arrived at the restaurant @ 4:45 last night  we sat in the bar & waited to be greeted by a server for awhile! We were concerned about the service for 1st impressions are utmost important & we were not greeted upon entering the restaurant.. our server introduced himself as 'Grayson' asked for our beverage order  our beverages arrived shortly after.. we ordered the full rack of ribs which came with no BBQ sauce on the ribs..our meal was delivered by another server..while waiting to alert our server about the ribs we noticed him socializing with other guests & could not get his attention! We decided to eat our meals which was delicious! The ribs were so tender (no BBQ sauce) but delicious! When he finally came by our table I ordered coffee at this time I noticed the table next to us be seated  after 10-15 minutes no one approached the guests  at this time I'm getting a little frustrated for I still have not received the coffee & the guests next to us we're getting very upset! We called him over & asked for the check & a box & asked about our dessert we ordered he apologized & said he forgot!!! We decided to just leave  our check was incorrect he (Grayson) said he had to have the manager correct it  again as we watched him socializing with no urgency as he knew we were frustrated we left the $ on the table & left!! B'J's I've managed restaurants for the last 17 years  this service was by far the worst I've experienced in a very long time!! Was there a manager on the floor? Perhaps you should have management table touch!!
mike e.,Glendora  CA,12,49,159,6/14/2014,4.0,One of favs: though it is loud ( I'm convinced that they have a white noise generator here) they have one of my favorite dishes. The Parmesan crusted chicken. There's something about it that is magical to my taste buds. Did I mention the Tatanka Stout? Also my favorite beer. I don't drink much beer  but this one is really good and they make it- here or at one of the other restaurants.  Eileen ordered the half rack of ribs  and we shared here salad. I like the blue cheese dressing which is a little sweet.Unfortunately for us today  it is graduation day for some of the local schools so it is crowded. Still  the place is usually pretty crowded on any Saturday evening. Our waitress Savanah  just got on and is very pleasant.The food (and beer) was as good as ever. I will fault them for the amount of steamed broccoli  but over all very good.
Jenn L.,Baldwin Park  CA,12,8,45,8/25/2015,5.0,My all time favorite dish from BJs is the Southern Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes  gravy and a roasted corn and bell pepper succotash. I always ask for extra gravy because it can get a little dry after awhile but it is amazing! They have it in a lunch portion as well as a dinner plate. The lunch portion is a single fried breaded chicken breast and the dinner plate is a double. Try this! You will definitely love it!
Sarah S.,Oakland  CA,388,49,33,7/13/2015,3.0,Typically  I have decent food and decent service anytime I visit a BJ's restaurant. However  my experience at this BJ's was a bit lacking. We visited on a busy Saturday night and were informed there was a 30 minute wait. We didn't mind waiting but when we were seated we noticed how many empty tables there were  which made us wonder why they had us waiting outside for so long. Maybe there weren't enough waiters available to serve all the tables but I would expect a popular place like BJ's to be fully staffed on a Saturday night.Our waitress was very nice and attentive when taking our orders and checked up on us frequently. However  the food took nearly an hour to come out after we placed our orders. We felt bad asking our waitress where our food was because she seemed SO busy running from table to table. I ordered the new honey-Sriracha brussel sprouts  a burger  and fries. My friends ordered a pizza and a pazookie. When the food finally arrived at our table  it was just alright. I struggled to find another adjective to describe the food but really that is the best way to sum up both the food and our entire experience at BJ's that night: Alright. The brussel sprouts were too salty and overcooked. The burger & fries were meh. The pizza seemed like it had been sitting out a little longer than it should have been. The one thing that was delicious was  of course  the pazookie because pizza-size cookies with ice cream on top are one of the greatest inventions in the modern-day world. Yum.If I am in the area again  I might give this BJ's another chance since it may have just been an off night for the restaurant.
Vanessa S.,La Verne  CA,23,12,1,4/24/2016,1.0,Worse service ever took 45 minutes to get our salad and 55 minutes for our appetizer when it came the appetizer was cold. Food came out cold and when we asked to talk o a Manager she didn't seem to make it a priority got new food out and it was burnt. My food was tacos and the tortilla was so had I couldn't even eat it. Sadly after being at our table for 2 hours my husband and oldest son left without eating dinner and we still has to pay for a bunch of food we didn't even eat. So sad and disappointed
Maria V.,La Puente  CA,0,2,,12/10/2016,5.0,Great customer service  they made one little mistake and not only did they correct it but they went above and beyond my expec
Amy K.,Los Angeles  CA,1125,788,695,2/4/2014,4.0,I don't understand why this BJ's is rated so low. As soon as you get in the parking lot you can feel you're in the suburbs. And I love that feeling. The parking lot is many and plentiful  you can park anywhere you want  for FREE  for as long as you want. It's also in a huge lot by the Burlington's and stuff so take your pick! We got in on monday evening and there was no wait. They also seated us before our entire party was there which made me sooooooooo happy. The population of looking like they've settled couples and high school children made the interior even more suburby which I again  love. Our waiter looked like he was a junior in high school and was an attentive  try hard server. I practiced some self control and ordered the chicken a la fresca without bell peppers and it was actually kind of delightful. Granted  I was absolutely starving but I finished the whole plate. The items on their menu are pretty horrible for you though so watch out  and I would try to stay with the healthier menu if possible. We were there for a bday so they brought out a mini pizookie for the bday boy  and we got our own  which was SO FREAKING DELICIOUS. Just for that pizookie they deserve 5 stars. Anyways  I had a great time here  it reminded me of my quaint suburby childhood.
Justine G.,Diamond Bar  CA,393,83,23,2/18/2015,1.0,Went it and got food poisoning and had horrible service. Will not be going back to this location.
Fernando G.,Highland Park  Los Angeles  CA,5,24,75,5/17/2015,5.0,Plenty of parking in front. Very clean bathrooms. Came here today for a birthday brunch with a group of about 25. Ordered the BJ's California Scramble. Very delicious where you can taste the fresh ingredients. Service was great especially with the big group we had. Waiters kept checking on us throughout are brunch. Definitely coming back.
Albert S.,West Covina  CA,19,31,243,7/3/2015,4.0,I come here for the blonde's (beer) stay for the pizza and pasta. Love the extreme pepperoni. This joint is always fast at seating groups. Awesome friendly service oh yeah make sure not to skip on the bazokie
Inda C.,Riverside  CA,0,3,,10/16/2016,1.0,For a party of 40+ people with buffet style dinner  surely enough this restaurant cannot handle it. 1. Service is very slow  obviously they don't have experience dealing with a large group. We have to ask NUMEROUS times to get the drinks and menu refilled. Asking for a second ice tea  the water gave me ice water  instead. 2. Food was bland  dry and not hold on safe temperature. Caesar Salad: dry  not cold  not enough dressing and cheese. Spaghetti with meat balls: bland and dry  meatballs taste like they were served straight from the microwave. C'mon  there are 40+ people  they only gave 15 meatballs. Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken: bland and dry  not enough chicken. Overall  this restaurant only deserves a C rating and definitely  we will NOT go back to BJ's. First and last visit!
Christian Z.,West Covina  CA,1,20,4,2/2/2015,5.0,My girlfriend and I come here every couple weeks or so to have a drink and a late dinner. The service is never bad but tonight was exceptionally good thanks to our waiter Ramon who made us feel very welcome and was genuinely polite. He didn't fail to check up on us every couple minutes to make sure we were doing fine and he recommended some very delicious beers that my girlfriend and I enjoyed very much. All in all I'd have to say this was our best experience at this bj's and I truly hope managements sees this and recognizes Ramon for his excellent customer service
Jessica R.,Costa Mesa  CA,70,76,159,3/19/2016,2.0,The service here is not very good. We noticed that a lot of tables were dirty and he had to wait 30 minutes. While we waited I noticed those tables were never touched. On a busy Saturday night I don't understand why the restaurant would be understaffed. We finally were seated and our waitress came to the table. She seemed very rushed and since I had brought my family for the first time I wanted to share my last great experience with them. She didn't offer any recommendations  dropped off our drinks (mine still had all the syrup at the bottom  she told me to mix it myself) and left. We wanted to start off with a few appetizers but since she didn't come back. We realized we should probably order our next time we see her since we didn't know when we would see her again. I definitely understand being busy and that's great but the service to the guest is suffering for it for sure. Once she finally came around we were starving  I was pretty embarrassed to bring my family here with this service. The Venice BJ's had great service so I thought I'd receive the same type of service here. Probably will not go back to this location.
Parker J.,Covina  CA,28,4,3,4/29/2016,1.0,always loved it here until they gave me a deep dish with almst no cheese on one half of it. never going there again
Pablo S.,Los Angeles  CA,113,53,83,2/25/2015,4.0,This was my first time at his location. Parking was not an issue and it was free. Came in today for a business meeting  It was 3 of us and our meeting started at 2pm. we were seated right away. Our server was Brandon and he was very helpful. Our food came out on time and Brandon was allowed us to take as much time as we needed to conduct our meeting  Brandon even checked to see if they had a specific drink which most servers wont even bother and just simply give you a no. We were there well over an hour but Brandon was not rushing us at all and allowed us to take up as much time as we needed. The food was the norm for a BJ's but what stood out was the lever of service Brandon provided us. The WIFI was free and fast  I was able to use my laptop without any problems. Too bad I live/work too far from this location if not I would be definitely coming back.Thank you Brandon!!!
Zak S.,Redwood City  CA,155,18,14,6/15/2015,1.0,I don't recommend coming to this restaurant find another BJ. I have been coming here for many years buying growlers of their signature beer and the last year or so the place has really gone to s***. The managers obviously don't care about the quality control going out to their customers.I can't believe that they don't even have a growler filler tube  come on guys what is it 6 dollars 20 at most. obviously you don't know anything about beer  filling a growler without a filler tube ruins the beer that defeats the purpose of selling growlers or even buying one I'm not buying a growler to drink by myself in one sitting which you are causing me to throw away or drink it all because after a few hours of pouring it into the growler without a filler tube it becomes still and undrinkablethat defeats the
Adela S.,Diamond Bar  CA,47,3,,1/23/2016,2.0,My husband and I have always enjoyed BJ's food and we still do. Normally we visit other locations. Today we came with a party of 8 and were told that it would be a 20-30 minute wait. It was not unusually busy and we went past the 30 minutes. When asked how much longer they were waiting for two ladies to leave so they could clean the table. Waited longer then when asked again they were waiting for someone to clean the table. Finally seated and we noticed there were areas that tables could have been put together as they did for another larger party who arrived. Our server took awhile to bring our drinks and our food took awhile to arrive. When it did  some of us had cold fries. We will still go to BJ's but not this location.
Sandy N.,West Covina  CA,238,76,71,5/11/2015,4.0,Love  love  love BJ's Pizookies!!! They actually have a party size one. Their chocalate chip is the best  but that's just me. Great place for lunch & dinner if you're with family  friends  date..ect! They have a flat screens all around the restaurant for the people who are interested in sports. The Bar is too the side with a Huge selection of their famous beers..Truthfully can't suggest one since I'm not a huge beer fan.What I love ordering:New Orleans JambalayaGrilled Chicken Baked Potato w/ extra Alfredo sauceAny of their PIZZAS!!! (So Yummy!)And of course their Pizookies :-dThe wait is not bad when you go on weekdays. Weekends are busy. I usually do takeout for lunch and bring it to work  the staff is friendly and very helpful esp when your asking for a recommendation on a food or beverage selection.
Rosemarie A.,Azusa  CA,0,15,5,5/8/2016,5.0,I booked a reservation for my graduation lunch and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. They made sure that my party and I were well taken care of and were very attentive. The manager is a sweetheart and ensure that everything ran smoothly! Thank you BJs for making my graduation lunch a success! Great food  drinks and service! Love this place!
Irma S.,West Covina  CA,0,1,,11/4/2016,2.0,Lousy service!!! It seemed the server was too tired. Every time we asked for something it took him a long time to get back to us.
Shane F.,Honolulu  HI,112,23,16,2/15/2014,5.0,My cousin recommended this place after passing it on our way to big bear. So we made plans to eat before heading back to Hawaii. This was as she put it their go to spot for dinner when no one could decide. So needless to say I was excited!We get there just as they were opening  and I was starving. The place has a gordon biersch type atmosphere  with a nice size bar section and an equal size dining area. Our server Nicole was great  although my cousin knew exactly what she was getting. Nicole helped me by recommending there deep dish pizza. Let me just stop right here  after taking that first bite I had to say that this was the best pizza that I've ever had. I consider myself a pizza guy and pretty much have had it all  but this was super delicious. The bread was fluffy and not to doughy  the toppings were just right  even the bell peppers were chopped into little pieces  the italian sausage and pepperoni were right on spot. Everything blended so well I was in heaven. I was starving when I came in and even with all that I just described up top I could only finish half the pizza. My cousin had the jambalaya which was her favorite. I had a taste and the flavor was spot on. Very spicy too much for me.I also on the recommendation from a friend had a beer from there brewery called Jeremiah's Red. Was excellent and I couldn't even bring myself to try another beer.Finally if you come to BJ's for nothing else you need to order a Pizooki. Now you may be wondering what that is. Well firstly its a desert! Next is where the awesome is. Imagine a huge fresh baked cookie the size of a small pizza  made to order from about 3 different types of cookies you can even do half and half  and this is topped with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream. Thats right LEGEN - wait for it - DARY! Yup thats all that needs to be said it was epic and can't wait for another excuse to go to Cali and eat at BJ's again.
Tiffany P.,Baldwin Park  CA,126,4,26,3/25/2016,2.0,BRING BACK THE CAJUN PASTA!!!!!!I ONLY get that when I come here and now that it's gone  I don't know what to get here. The Cajun pasta gave me a reason to come here! And now I don't have a reason to anymore.
Mykey M.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,8,1,12/21/2015,5.0,No wait tonight. Our server was Desire she was amazing. Her customer service is great! We come in often and the manager Danny recognized us and stopped by. He's another one with great customer service! Highly recommended!
Renee E.,Los Angeles  CA,18,157,237,1/25/2015,1.0,Made reservations a few days before for 7 people for a Friday night dinner celebration. I was expecting the place to be busy so that's why I made reservations. I've been to this BJ's once before and had a pretty good experience. The food was good  service was ok and the place was pretty clean. However  tonight was just not their night.We ordered around 7pm and didn't get our food until 7:30 pm! We were all starving and wanted our food  but we had to wait for such a long time (ughhhh). Then  not all of our orders came at the exact same time so we had to wait even longer for the last person's order so we could all eat together. We told our waiter that we wanted a to-go order but when he handed us the bill and wished us a good night  we asked him if he placed the order and he said he forgot! That was a bummer :(Food was ok  had the chili in a bread bowl. Not the best I've had but also not the worst. Kind of pricy too.I suggest coming for lunch on a weekday for their specials and hopefully it's not as busy as it was on Friday.
Tony G.,Ontario  CA,25,10,70,6/2/2015,1.0,This place suck birthday boy been waiting for almost 40 min no food everyone been waiting on him that sucks sad .. Really mad .. Fuck this place ..
Veronica H.,Indio  CA,730,323,57,10/7/2013,3.0,Went on a Sunday afternoon for some pizza  beer and football. Parking was easy to find  seats in the dining area were readily available (for a party of two). I had the sweet pig pizza with Pineapple  tomatoes and ham. The service was fast and friendly but nothing extradoinary.
Mister P.,Pasadena  CA,2,50,20,2/18/2017,1.0,"We came in today @ 4pm. Service in the bar section was pretty mediocre. First we had a waiter who took our drink orders  then came back to take out food order  after coming back with no drinks. Then we ended up with another waitress ""Samantha"" because he had to leave. So still no drinks. Finally drinks come out with an apology because bar was slammed. But minus the Pepsi my wife ordered. I told her and she again apologized and went to waitress another table. Then someone else came with the Pepsi some time later. Food came out cold. My deluxe burger was overcooked and my wife\'s pasta was cold. Meanwhile we are eating  I already finished my Mule and my wife was out of Pepsi. I had to flag down another waiter to get my wife a refill. I didn\'t even order another alcoholic beverage because I didn\'t want to wait 20 minutes for a drink again. I don\'t think I will be frequenting this place much when there are so many other good places around."
Sarah B.,Manhattan  NY,73,20,4,10/29/2015,5.0,I give this place 5 stars because I can't give John more than 5 stars. If you are eating here  don't bother dining with any other server. He is funny  witty  genuine and truly cares about your experience. My experience with him started at the host stand where one of the hostesses told me that I would be seated with John  the best server they had. Now you could say that she was lying but she was completely sincere. John was attentive and nice and always very diligent during our meal. Thank you John for being the ideal server!
Elle A.,Woodland Hills  CA,12,91,271,12/18/2014,4.0,The pizza and root beer are good. Nice place for small group or happy hour. Game nights are crowded and loud. Rodger is the best bartender in sgv. Great drinks!!
P D.,Covina  CA,0,14,,4/13/2017,2.0,I came to lunch today with my wife. Waiter Moses was very attentive we ordered Soup & Salad. We noticed that the couple who arrived after us received their order. I asked why we hadn't been served yet and the response was they had ordered soup & salad. I told Moses we had too. No big deal then they proceed to give us the silverware my wife's fork looks like someone just eaten from it. So we ask for another one all the while we had been waiting for refills on water which never came.(I guess BJ's has a new system that alleviates the wait staff from having to fill drink orders we mention that to Moses he is apologetic & says he'll have his Mgr come by our table. 10 minutes later Moses comes by & asks if his mgr had come by we say no. Then Greg the Mgr comes by very soft spoken is apologetic. At this point we had noticed that the Chicken tortilla soup we both had ordered didn't have chicken. We mention that to Greg he says very softly that we'll notice a small discount on our bill. He was right he discounted our bill 2.19 ! At least he was accurate. I think if we had just had 1 or 2 of these things happen I'd be ok with it but the inconsistent service and dirty fork & lack of chicken deserved to take a meal off the bill or at least comp a dessert. This is the 2nd time we've had a service issue come up in consecutive trips! May be awhile before we are back. The food was good but the lack of empathy on their parts was lacking mainly the Mgr.
Alexandria M.,El Monte  CA,65,25,35,3/15/2015,3.0,Came here for a late dinner with friends. The wait was 15 minutes to be seated. Our waiter was really cool but took forever bringing all the little things we needed. I had the mini pizza and a pear cider beer. Very tasty :)
James G.,Covina  CA,0,9,,3/16/2016,2.0,We went to BJs tonight for an early dinner and we were told it was 20 minute wait and it was empty. They were understaffed and apologized  I understand and proceeded to the bar for a beer and wine for my girlfriend as she waited with my mother. Bartender says sorry sir only one drink at a time  I'm 55 years old for gods sake. I left for Chilis next door and my mother could barely get by the 7 employees having a smoke and texting each other. Never going back!!!
Eugene D.,Long Beach  CA,303,27,7,1/20/2016,2.0,We came in a 9:45pm on Wednesday  January 20. We asked our server if we could order for Happy Hour which starts at 10pm. She went to ask the manager who had us wait 10 minutes. Not a big deal. But in the grand scheme of things you're stepping over dollars to pick up pennies. Thanks.
Jerry S.,Glendora  CA,44,59,1,9/6/2014,3.0,This place is pretty good. I have been here quite a few times with friends and the family. I like the fact that they have a good variety of selection of food. Their pizza is better than average and they have a great selection of beers. We have been here with other families and ordered the family size pazooki which is a huge cookie with like 8 scoops of ice cream.If you are going to order the pazookie I would put the order in as early as possible. They usually will tell you that it takes awhile to make. The one thing I do not like about this place is that the noise level is horribly loud.I think their service is ok and the wait time on the food is longer than average  but if you go in aware of the possibilty of a longer wait it does not bother you so much.
Brittany P.,Upland  CA,128,4,2,2/8/2016,5.0,I had an amazing experience dinning here. John was my server and I asked a lot of questions about the menu and he answered all my questions and spent a lot of time with us to make sure we were taken care of. When I come back I will definitely be asking if he is working so that he can be out server again.
Ardie S.,Singapore  Singapore,192,36,6,1/27/2016,5.0,We haven't been to BJ'S in a while. We decided to have lunch there today and I must say they have stepped it up a notch with enhanced appetizers. We had the root beer glazed wings... Oh la la packed with flavor and crispy. They were sauced just right. The waiter was amazing  after we paid the bill he brought us drinks to go   without being asked.
Sal B.,West Covina  CA,0,4,,8/21/2016,1.0,I went there yesterday with the little woman to have a nice meal & relax. I ordered a steak with a side of broccoli and asparagus. When the waiter brought my plate he had a look of shame & embarrassment rolled into one. When I looked at the size of the steak I immediately understood why he looked the way he looked. Instead of declining it or asking to speak to the manager I just went ahead and ate it. The steak itself was just ok  and even the sides were very small. Never again will I return to this place. At least they did not mess up my shot of Jack!
Juvi G.,Pomona  CA,421,589,4256,2/22/2012,4.0,I have only ever visited this restaurant twice  but from my experiences here  I'd say it's a good place worth visiting at least once. The food is good. And the desserts phenomenal. I especially like the variety of pizookie's they have. If you don't know what a pizookie is  it's basically a really big cookie baked in a deep dish that comes in many different flavors  (such as  Red Velvet  Godiva Dark Chocolate  White Chocolate  etc.)  and served with all sorts of delicious toppings like ice cream  whipped cream  hot fudge  and the like. Trust me  you haven't lived until you've tried one. So the next time you're in the area  you know where to go.  They also have a large variety of alcohol. As well as some unique creations of their own which vary by season.
Geneyem B.,West Covina  CA,146,101,50,11/20/2014,1.0,Worst experience I have ever had with a restaurant. Not only was the food cold but the service was horrible. We were seated around 6:45pm  took us a while to order then finally did. It was my friends 21st birthday so we wanted that evening to be special. So we ordered a little bit before 7  food and drinks  and we didn't get our food until 7:45pm. Then I didn't get my martini until 8pm. Instead of having a special night for my friends birthday it ended up a night were we had to look for our waitress and continue to wait for everything that we ordered. To top it off I gave the waitress my reward number and yet I didn't get any points for that evening. It wasn't even packed so I don't know why the service and food was bad.
Scott C.,San Diego  CA,11,215,104,12/31/2015,1.0,What a piece of crap chain establishment. It used to be good years ago but quality Has gone done and prices went up. Never again!
Christina N.,Orange County  CA,166,66,16,10/18/2014,4.0,This location is very spacious and open. I've only ever been to the location in Huntington Beach  and I liked this location better. They had a much nicer restaurant layout. But what really put them over the top was when my party was offered free pizza slices while we were waiting (something BJs-HB's never offered). The samples were mediocre but the fact that they even offered was enough to get me coming back. Other than that  Their service was very prompt  the shoe string fries were delicious  and the pizookie  as always  was plate-lickin good.
Danny S.,Los Angeles  CA,465,285,67,9/14/2013,1.0,Came here on a Friday night and did not feel welcomed. When me and some friends came here we weren't helped right away until my gf asked..which was fine since it was quite busy. After we got sat down we made our orders of food and some alcohol. The food wasn't that great that night. My gf ordered a burger and she took one bite and said it wasn't tasting good  so I had a try and the burger tasted burnt. The alcohol came quick  but our hostess spilled some of my friends beer and did not even offer to get a new one for him.Pretty horrible night for a friends bdayProbably wont be coming back to this location
Patricia K.,La Verne  CA,42,56,31,10/1/2014,5.0,Had my sons 16th birthday dinner here last night. My table was ready at the time promised even after they had to accommodate 5 more for my party. I pre-ordered food online (would highly recommend) the food was on the table 10 minutes after being seated. The waitress and bartender were very attentive. I frequent this place on a regular  have never been disappointed.
Monica M.,Covina  CA,111,49,1,1/10/2016,1.0,"I write this as I sit  waiting and waiting  and waiting for ""curbside"" delivery. I placed my order online  and asked for it to be ready at 6 pm. At the moment it is 6:15 - and I\'m still waiting. I should\'ve known things were going to go south when  upon placing my order and calling to add something to it  BJs personnel put me on hold  passed me to someone else  then hung up on me. When I called again  they couldn\'t find my order. As I was placing my order (again) on the phone it magically appeared in their system. Now  I end with the beginning: I pull up to curbside delivery stalls  only to find there are none available. The number I\'m supposed to call is only visible IF you can pull into a stall. When I called in  the manager couldn\'t tell me the number because he didn\'t know it. Whaaaaa???So  there I was sticking half my body out the car to see the number  so I can announce my arrival. With there being nowhere to park I\'m told to pull to the front - and wait - with my hazards on. Meanwhile  curbside parking remains full with what I suspect are the cars of dine-in folks. I like BJs - I really want to like the idea of curbside service. But  I found it to be far too much work and worry for the effort. I\'d suggest more spots for curbside delivery  at the very least."
Sunny D.,La Puente  CA,116,214,980,11/26/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,This place I feel is loosing focus on simple things maybe there playing on there cell phones to much or just don't care. The food was great but the one little issue was a broken plate ... It's an obvious the kitchen manager isn't doing his job correctly and his staff doesn't give a ?hit. That plate had to switched through more then one person and nobody noticed a broken place if I was the manger I would have a sit down with the staff and put them in check. There's no reason for this to happen. The kid that picked up the plate after when I was done with it noticed it and I told him let your manager know .. He didn't I walked up to the manger on my way out and showed him a picture I took of the plate he seemed shocked that this plate made it this far. Everything was cool but for this Cracked plate its a 1 star BJ's
Jim G.,Covina  CA,154,439,2,9/3/2013,4.0,"Wow  been here many many many times  and according to yelp  I have not reviewed this location...... Queeee? Don\'t know how that happened.OK  so it is BJ\'s  so most people know what that means. If you are from outside California and in one of those states where they don\'t have one  then this is worth the stop. Very Very good selection of menu items  just about anything you want you are going to find it. Food is extremely consistent from location to location.Service is usually first rate  especially at this location.Most Fri/Sat/Sun times you are going to have a wait. Just deal with it. The food is worth it  send someone over a few minutes before you really want to eat and you are good to go  grab a ""beeper"" and enjoy spending some quality time with whomever you are with and my gosh  have a conversation. Once you get seated  you should be all set to rock and roll.Menu items ----Absolute Fav --- Parmesan Crusted Chicken ---- just so darn good. YOU MUST ASK FOR EXTRA OF THAT CHARDONNAY CREAM SAUCE.... this darn stuff should be sold in a gallon jug and I would take it home with me every time to put on everything. This is the star of the show !Chili --- not too bad for a chain restaurant.Burgers --- all very good size and quite tasty.Potato --- ahhh hello  why call this out  well  cuz they make some darn good spuds that are on the menu all by their lonesome. Usually supercharged and a meal unto themselves.Salads - yep  you like \'em  they are there and all very solid.Beer ---- yep  they are called a Brewhouse for a reason  they always have a great selection of their in-house brews and everything else for the most part is available either on tap or in the bottle.BJ\'s - yes digging it - no matter where you go they are always consistent and you know what you are going to get."
Carra B.,El Segundo  CA,0,5,,5/27/2016,2.0,I have celiac disease and therefore cannot eat gluten or I get very sick. I love bjs as a good safe option to eat at and recently visited this location for the first time and was very disappointed! I always get the tomato soup with no croutons and the baked potato  but they were out of baked potatoes. Our waiter offered a salad as a replacement and made sure to tell him it had to be gluten free. The salad came out with obvious crumbs and crouton pieces in it. I showed him this and seemed very apologetic but he never brought out a new one! At first I thought I was just expecting too much but than the people I was eating with expressed the same concern! All in all I will still go to my local BJs but this location was huge disappointment!
Jason T.,Glendora  CA,1,6,5,8/10/2016,1.0,If I could give 0 stars I would. Came here with my girlfriend to enjoy a lunch date together. I should have known it was going to be interesting when our server had to keep asking what we ordered. He had a notepad in his hand but never wrote anything down. We ordered an appetizer and requested it to come out first. My girlfriend ordered a sandwich that came with a soup. I ordered a small pizza. I also ordered a house beer. After some conversation  my girlfriends soup came to the table. We mentioned to the server (who was different than the one who took our order) that we had ordered an appetizer. He said it was on the way. Finally our appetizer was ready. Next came my pizza. After eating a slice or 2  I completely forgot about my beer that never came. It had been at least 15 minutes at this point. I searched around for our server and couldn't locate him. I even pondered walking to the bar and ordering it myself (which would have been faster). Eventually our server brought my beer. Moments later  one of the managers came to our table to notify us that my girlfriends order had been given to another table  they were re-making her order  and offered to take the appetizer off the bill. We accepted and appreciated the heads up  though it was a big inconvenience as I was almost done with my meal. Our server brought out my girlfriends meal and she immediately noticed it was made wrong. She took a bite then realized it wasn't what she ordered. We waved down the server and he looked at it and even he said it wasn't correct. After finally a third attempt  they brought out the correct order but my girlfriend had already lost her appetite and I was disappointed at the terrible service. I asked to speak to the manager. We spoke to another manager  Luis (or Louis) and explained to him our terrible experience. He did the right thing and offered to cover our entire meal  except for the $4 beer (the one that took 15-20 mins). Well  we ended up leaving them $5 and probably won't be returning to this location. The food wasn't bad (when it was made correctly) which is why this only has 1-star.
Lorraine G.,Azusa  CA,0,4,1,11/7/2015,5.0,Amazing service ! Our waitress Courtney was the best! She made it such a pleasant dinner! Very attentive. Never had service like I did here!
Kay K.,La Puente  CA,1,16,11,7/21/2016,1.0,2nd time coming to this location and the service sucks again. The host was rude didn't even ask how were doing just stuck up like you work at bjs relax. I looked around and saw nothing but poor prebussing  the place just looked dirty. We finally got to our table and our server was Carlos E. Soon as he greeted the table gave a fake hello & you could just tell he did not want to be there & it made us feel awkward cause we were all in a happy mood. He got us out drinks & was rushing to get appetizers in when we haven't even looked at our menu. We finally ordered & enjoyed our food. We finally got the checked and showed him we had a coupon & he gave us a dirty look and made it an issue like come on dude at least fake it to get a good tip but nothing. He did not receive a tip and didn't even bump up his service to get one. He was just rude & fake all around. Look I get it you know I was a server once & you have bad days but you suck it up and get your money. If you don't know how to be friendly  hate what your doing  and can't be genuinely welcoming... YOU SHOULD QUIT & FIND ANOTHER JOB.
Grace G.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,41,22,,5/20/2016,1.0,"So the service today sucked. It took 40 minutes for us to get our drinks. I asked for no tomatoes  they still gave me tomatoes. Then when they gave me my new plate supposedly with ""no tomatoes""  there were still a piece of tomato on it left. What if I was allergic to tomatoes? And then when I brought it up to our horrible server  she then told her manager  who then came up to our table pinpointing each piece of red food that possibly looked like a tomato WITH MY FORK correcting me saying which one was a red bell pepper and which one might possibly be a tomato... I felt violated. Thank you horribly slow Asian server and incredibly rude manager who kept poking at my food... No  I won\'t sue you for the tomatoes in my salad  but I will write your restaurant a bad review."
Loraimy E.,San Gabriel  CA,0,1,,8/30/2016,5.0,My favorite BJs to go to! Great service every time. Our server Steven P. Outdid himself  superb  friendly  and attentive.
Erik A.,West Covina  CA,0,1,,8/30/2016,5.0,Love to come here late at night. Awesome customer service and food is great! My favorite server is Steven. He is very attentive  considerate  and is really friendly. Love the deep dish pizza and pazzukis!
Alex E.,San Gabriel  CA,0,1,,8/30/2016,5.0,Steven P was awesome! He was really friendly and always checked up on us to make sure we were ok on drinks.
Lenin C.,San Gabriel  CA,0,2,,8/30/2016,5.0,We came here on a tuesday night and the wait was not too bad. Only about 15 minutes for a party of 9. The food was great and the mini pizza was half off for happy hour! We then ordered the huge pizookie which awesome for big parties and has a great value! Our server was Steven and he made the experience quite enjoyable!
Anissa V.,West Covina  CA,114,4,,4/10/2016,1.0,Terrible service at this location. Hostess sat us at our table  we sat there for about 15 minutes trying to get any waiters attention as they all acted like they didn't hear us so finally I got up and walked to a waitress I saw at a register and asked her if she could have someone come take our order she said yes so I went back to our table  we waited about another 10 mins and still nobody came so we just decided to leave. Oh and need I mention that we visited this location at 12:00pm when it was not busy what so ever! Also hostess was pretty rude. When leaving I mentioned to her that they forgot about us and she looked to the other hostess that she was talking to and they laughed and said that that's not their job.
Chris A.,San Dimas  CA,0,5,,2/5/2016,5.0,Excellent service and food! Had a wedge salad that hit the spot before my wife and I got our custom deep dish pan pizza! Seasoned tomatoes  artichoke and mushroom. Was the best pizza my wife and I had in a really long time! Will be back again soon
Patty And Sergio R.,Los Angeles  CA,7,353,4,6/21/2015,5.0,Brice was our server tonight  he did an amazing job  he was funny and very consistent regardless of how busy the place was. It's nice to see employees smile under pressure. He sure made our Father's Day dinner a good one. At our table we had cherry chipotle salmon: delicious Chicken tortilla soup combo: delicious Chicken and spinach: good Club sandwich with fries: okClam chowder soup: could be better (salty  too thick)The green teas were watered down twice but that's ok  I understand it's busy and it happens. Will we be back ? YES.
Joseph H.,Covina  CA,13,12,3,1/1/2015,4.0,Came in for a brew house burger and a light switch and low and behold  they are showing the ROSE PARADE on the tv with sound on?!? Vanessa the bartender says don't blame her though.
Mrs.K W.,West Covina  CA,0,2,,8/18/2015,5.0,"I\'ve been a regular customer at BJ\'s West Covina ever since their opening day  years ago! ""All of the staff""  waitresses waiters  bartenders  bus boys /seaters and managers  are the ""BEST"" of all the BJ\'s I\'ve dined at (which has only been 3 others)! B.J. West Covina is just a ""special & unique"" group of people that\'s good at making you feel right at home.....some even make you feel like family!!!  Speaking of family.....tonite  I\'m on my way to say good-bye and give my blessings to my favorite Mgr. ""Patrick"" as he transitions to a new venture (still with BJs)  but living in another state! Patrick is a working manager  very motivated and has always gone over & beyond the call of duty! He definitely cares about ""CUSTOMER SATISFACTION""! He\'ll be sorely missed. West Covina\'s LOSS is the other State\'s GAIN  how lucky they are! :( Patrick  I\'d like to say Thank you for all you do continue to have the kind  rare & precious heart and personality that you\'ve displayed here at west covina and I\'m certain ""continued success"" for your future is right at hand! Thanks for being such a ""cool"" young man....you always treated me like a friend/family! Thank You! I asked God to take you safely to your new destination and to Bless you with peace and serenity as you embark on this new phase of life!  With your Reputation....no problem  this will be a piece-of-cake for you to adjust! Take care of self & family  keep in touch. And thanks for being the special person you are God Bless"
Jeanette M.,Glendora  CA,1,3,,9/27/2015,2.0,I love bjs food however when you order pick up its never the same as ordering in. If your meal usually comes with a small salad it won't when you get it to go. I even told the lady on the phone to remind her and still didn't get it. Quality of food isn't the same either. I live down the street so good will still be warm but not the same. To go service always is horrible and sometimes it's too packed to dine in.
Nini M.,Temple City  CA,10,31,10,8/20/2014,4.0,Love this place food is great and staff is also great. My favorite is the strawberry splash.
Brandy D.,Chino  CA,158,47,27,11/10/2014,1.0,Such a bummer! I normally love BJS and was pretty excited my girlfriend chose here to celebrate her going away. I haven't been for awhile  and was looking forward to their yummy pizza. I arrived about an hour after the rest of my party. I know I was late  so I totally expected for our server to not approach us right away. We waited. Then we waited. Then we waited some more. He passed by repeatedly and even smile at us? But then he would just pass us by. My husband went to the bar and ordered each of us a beer. Finally I caught his attention  and we ordered food as well as more drinks. From this point on our server was extremely attentive. Soooo...we ordered the Cali flatbread and OF COURSE the BJS favorite pizza. Our food took a whopping 25 minutes!! It's a Monday night! Like it shouldn't take that long? But then our food came out cold! :( we ate the flat bread because the toppings were fresh tomato and avocado. Those can definitely be eaten cold. But the pizza (oh the pizza I had been craving for what seemed like everrrrr) we had to send back! It wasn't just cold....it was freezing! Cheese wasn't melted  sausage wasn't siZzling  it was just a gross mess. Working in the service industry I understand these things happen. We politely let our server know And he was nice enough to take the plate away. He came back less than five minutes later with the same pizza.....still cold.......At this point we just ate the pizza. No point in sending it back again. Plus we were hungry. Regardless  I'm sad that the visit I was excited about ended with disgusting food.
Steven D.,Whittier  CA,7,65,10,12/12/2015,2.0,I used to love going to BJs. They had the best deep dish pizza. Well Its been a year or so since I last visited and wow has it changed. The quality of the food is just not up to the previous standard. The focus of the restaurant seems to have drifted away from their signature pizza  to more fancy dishes. The pizza quality was disappointing. The pie was missing cheese on some slices and was very dry. I had to request a side of sauce just to make it appetizing. Too bad because I really used to enjoy this place.
Jon R.,Los Angeles  CA,708,623,1169,3/10/2013,5.0,"Haven\'t been here in ages and wow  they really really impressed me tonight!The hostess\' were amazing. They apparently have a ""call ahead"" policy where you can  surprise surprise  call ahead and put your name in. That right there shaved off about 15 min. off our wait time. WIN!!Right from the get-go  our server Shawn B. was amazing! Friendly  professional  and very eager to guide us through the massive menu. He made some good recommendations which he heeded and were really impressed! **FOOD**Avocado Egg Rolls-Crispy exterior  creamy delicious filling-Sweet sauce for dipping-Highly highly recommend this one!California Chicken Sandwich (sub chicken tenders tossed in wing sauce)-Shawn recommended this and it was awesome! -Nice balance of flavors and textures (crispy vs. creamy)-Seasoned fries were basically mojo potatoes with a subtle seasoning  meh.-Sandwich itself was very good!Pizza-Chicago style-Thick dough  light buttery crispy on bottom-They\'re known for their pizza  get it if you wantClam Chowder-Surprisingly brilliant!-Honestly  a top notch chowder-Not runny yet not too thick-Nice pieces of clam and great overal flavor!-So good I got some to go for the next dayStrawberry BeignetFresh fried cinnamon sugar light airy donut topped with vanilla ice creamfresh strawberries  strawberry glaze and whipped cream. -Good  not great. Granted I was beyond full by the time I got to this thing  but the ""beignet"" was a little chewy for me  not delicate enough. It\'s seriously hard to go wrong with strawberries  glaze and ice cream though. -Stick with the pizookie  it\'s the classic for a reason! **DRINKS**HopStorm IPA-hoppy  light spice  acidic-nice finish-It\'s no Stone IPA or Greenflash but it\'s goodCoconut Mojito-Light  refreshing  thirst-quenching-Had a few sips and this thing is goooooodd..-Not an overwhelming coconut flavor more like a hint of itAll and all  I really wasn\'t expecting to enjoy this place as much as I did. Just discovered there\'s a BJ\'s in my city  yay  I\'m already planning on eating here in the next few days!!"
Tony G.,Alhambra  CA,0,9,,1/23/2017,1.0,Never again stepping a foot inside this BJ's   very disappointed with the service and lack of professionalism  too many employees for the type of service you get! Got seated next to 5 dirty tables with dirty plates  bones  bread crumbs and nobody to pick up around  waiter only took people's orders and picked up money but never bothered to pick up any plates around him  like 5 employees saw all these dirty tables but nobody to pick up  disgusting I couldn't even eat! And the tables were so close to each other that I was looking at nothing but dirty food the whole time  it took them 45 minutes to get them picked up after people started complaining  most likely there were more dirty tables than people how sad  and 3 waiters and Bussers just chit chatting in the lil back section where they have their extra plates like not careing about the type of service everybody is receiving which was shitty  never have I been so uncomfortable in a restaurant  NEVER  these employees are ridiculous and worst part where the hell was the manager  I asked for him and never came and other tables were complaining too about dirty plates everywhere and very disgusting dirty tables and no manager still to give a face  2 other employees on their phones just walking around texting and talking  but never nobody bothered to pick up plates around them  until a waitress dark skinned waivy curly hair was taking over the shift for our waiter she seen all the dirty tables they were leaving her and immediately gathered up the 2 waiters from that section and demanded for them to pick up those tables before leaving because where the hell would she sit her guests with all the TABLES being dirty! I did not even see a bussboy unless it was the 2 walking around in their phone and hiding the whole time! Never again stepping a foot in here  I came for service if not I woulda gone w fast food besides our order taking 45 mins for 2 people! And when walking out 5 employees chit chatting in the front desk as well  like WOW that's where they all hang I guess and where the hell is the manager unless their isn't any! Ridiculous!
Liz C.,Bakersfield  CA,57,2,,1/4/2017,1.0,Really bad service. After waiting for a table for 2  we were finally seated and had to wait another 20 minutes before a waitress finally noticed us and took our drink orders. We watched people seated after us be helped first. She was nice and the meal was good but then after she brought us the check she was nowhere to be seen again. We had already been at the restaurant for a good two hours and just wanted to get out of there. Eventually we went up to the front wondering if maybe we were supposed to pay our bill there and the hostess just told us we have to go back to our table and pay with our server. We told her we'd been sitting there forever and couldn't find her and the hostess just said sorry. We went back to our table and sat there some more  clearly irritated  before a bus boy finally noticed and went to swipe our card real fast. We could have very easily just walked out without paying since no one was even paying attention to us. Don't leave customers waiting to pay the bill for over 30 minutes. Not a good experience.
Kim W.,Covina  CA,0,8,1,8/6/2015,5.0,Went to BJ's at Eastland last nite had the best server Desire she had just started her shift and was so fabulous !! Also a shout out to Julio who was not our server but came over to say hello and just check in with us this is why we keep coming back great services and yummy food Thanks
Alison S.,Hershey  PA,17,170,7,3/5/2013,1.0,I opened the menu and BJ's and discovered that they not only include calorie counts on all their dishes; they have almost no dishes that land under 1500 calories! Not wanting to consume my entire day's allotment in one meal  I ordered the steak because it was lower at 470 (before sides  but I could order veggies). That was a mistake (pun unintended). The steak was tough  even cooked med-rare. Yuck. My dad did better with the balsamic chicken. And he says the clam chowder there is very good. The restaurant  which used to be a club  is enormous and LOUD. If you want to talk  be sure to ask for seating under the ceilinged area toward the back.
Kathy L.,Orange County  CA,68,1139,1506,7/27/2011,4.0,Ahi poke--Too much onion or garlic  otherwise big chunks of fresh tuna and avocado Santa fe spring rolls--Actual egg roll skins (usually at other places it's like really thick and doughy  so I liked this)  small but like 5 whole rolls  so more than expected. Good flavor  though cheese somewhat overpowered the other flavors. Green dipping sauce was a much better complement to the rolls than the orange one.Honey crispy chicken salad--The pieces of fried chicken were perfect! Nicely fried and crunchy on the outside but so tender on the inside. You don't find good chicken tenders like that often. And the salad itself was excellent too -- the honey mustard dressing wasn't too sweet or mustardy and the nuts added a nice crunch.Surprisingly exceeded expectations since they are known for their pizza and often when you order items off the menu that a restaurant isn't known for  you're in for a disappointment. Plus appetizers were $2 off since it was happy hour. Yay.
Andy H.,Covina  CA,52,16,8,2/3/2016,4.0,I live walking distance from here and it's still my go to place for a quick bite and a pint. The beer selection has definitely improved  and the bartender was very kind to offer me a few tasters before I made my choice. Service was average though as we had to ask a few times for water and random things. Busy for a Wednesday night but good atmosphere nonetheless. Food was decent and the Pizookie as good as usual.
Cindy V.,Baldwin Park  CA,0,5,5,7/11/2016,5.0,Our waiter was amazing!!! Steven is the best!!! The food was great. Drinks was amazing as well. All around amazing restaurant with amazing help.
Abby V.,West Hollywood  Los Angeles  CA,379,10,7,5/31/2015,5.0,John F was super chill and an amazing waiter. Always checked up on us and made my friends 21st birthday experience amazing. If you ever come to this BJ's ask for him. Have never had such amazing customer service ever.
G C.,Diamond Bar  CA,7,116,39,11/17/2015,1.0,Oh Bj's you disappointed me.Went in in the evening had to wait about 30-40 min which was ok ..it was not obvious people have to wait during the weekend.But once we got seated we took our order and waited about 25 min to get our food.We ordered an appetizer also and it was awful.Never again will i go to this Bj's.Very slow service  expensive food mediocre food .
Amanda G.,San Dimas  CA,1,6,,6/21/2016\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,I don't expect great service when I come to this restaurant. I enjoy the food which is why I come back. I went there tonight and my table was asked if we wanted any desserts...being famous for their dessert we ordered 2 monkey breads. Our server came back a couple minutes later and told us that the kitchen was closed so we couldn't get dessert. If you know that the kitchen is closing  our server should have asked us before the kitchen closed. Either way we ordered our desserts at 12:05 which was 5 minutes after they closed. As a restaurant  I would at least give your customers a chance to have dessert.
Heather C.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,18,16,37,10/22/2014,5.0,Went there today for a business lunch and had a great time. Service was great. Food was great. The atmosphere was great. The price was great. Everything came out in a timely manor and was nothing less then expected.
Nadine O.,San Dimas  CA,1,13,4,8/9/2015,1.0,If you have David as your waiter  good luck. We got seated and it took him 15 mins to acknowledge us and tell us he'd be right with us. When he finally came to order our drinks he gave me a funny look because I ordered two waters one with & one without ice. We also ordered our food because he had taken so long. Took twenty minutes to get our food and he only checked on us once. We had to ask different servers for refills and our condiments throughout the night. When we ordered our pazookie that took another 15 minutes to get to us and when we got it the cookie was rock hard. I flagged down the first waiter I saw and told him. He came back in two minutes with a new perfect warm pazookie. Don't think I will dine at this bjs again. Definitely will travel extra to go to the chino hills one  way better service there.
Chris D.,Anaheim  CA,146,100,9,11/8/2014,3.0,In the mall area lots of parking but at night you'll have to park further away. Saturday nights are packed  very loud restaurant/bar; not good for a date night. The wait staff was very attentive considering how full the restaurant was and our large party of 10.The ahi poke was tasty with the wonton chips  the onions rings/strands were zesty and the artichoke dip was cheesy and hot temperature wise. We ordered a lot of burgers but instead of cooking it to the right temp  it seemed like they were all cooked to medium well. So why even ask what temp people want it?
Leena B.,Oakland  CA,477,281,74,6/5/2013,3.0,"I don\'t want to start off this review by saying ""I like BJs"" because that has waaaay too many unnecessary connotations. So I will say that I really enjoy this brewhouse. They have a great selection of beers on tap and my two favorites are the blonde and heff. This is a great spot for happy hour. I order the spinach and artichoke dip  chicken potstickers  lettuce wraps  ahi tuna  stuffed mushrooms  and fried artichokes. Wow...I come here A LOT! Sometimes  the service is a bit slow  but the food is great. My favorite pizza is the spinach and artichoke pizza with the full crust (not thin crust). I\'m no vegetarian  but I sure do love this pizza! It melts in your mouth! And I thought only M&Ms did that...Lastly  try and save room for a delicious white chocolate pizookie. I\'m always in a group where they look at me all crazy when I want to order one. I mean yes  we just stuffed ourselves with appetizers  pizza  and beer...but it\'s so worth it! So when I compare BJs to TGI Fridays  Chili\'s  or any of those other fam bam restaurants  BJs is my favorite spot! AND the bar area is far far away from any crying children... ;)"
Juan L.,Duarte  CA,193,3,,7/25/2016,1.0,I came in and sat at the bar yesterday morning with my family. Our server was Brittany. She has bright red hair and had her hair 1/2 up 1/2 down (hope no one gets red hair in there food). She was very rude to my girlfriend. She asked for water with lemon and Brittany rolled her eyes at her. She did end up ordering a mimosa later. But because we sat in the bar and didn't order drinks right away Brittany looked mad. We ordered avocado egg rolls. They are amazing the young Mexican man that dropped it off was very nice and even smiled. (The first one we saw all day) Brittany never came by to see how we were doing. We had to ask another server to get her so we could order. She came up to us still seemed like she was mad and didn't want to be at work. We ordered a large bj favorite. The pizza was good. We then saw Brittany walk by and heard her talking to another server about someone very rude to do that with guest all around that can hear her. She had time to walk around and no time to get us a refill or ask if we needed anything. She finally came by and I asked if I could talk to a manager. She never got one because they never came. So if I come back I will make sure I don't have her. 3 stars for food 1 for Brittany. If you don't want to work don't have a job and I'm sure talking about people isn't allowed at work. I hope whoever she was talking about doesn't find out because nothing was nice. Karma comes around.
Michelle F.,Revere  MA,0,69,7,6/11/2016,2.0,"First time here and the food was ok (nothing worth waiting 30 mins to be seated) then the server need to read the menu because he gave me wrong information... Another server came and she brought the check to us  20 mins later still no dessert... When I asked the server she HAD THE NERVE to ask for the receipt  this ""girl"" wanted to check if we paid for the dessert  really??? Horrible customer service!! If you can just avoid coming to this place. Oh! Btw her name is Atiana P."
Kristine P.,West Covina  CA,24,7,10,11/10/2015,4.0,Great customer service from servers to manager. Ordered the steak medium but received it dry  well done. Our server took it back right away to replace it and the manager came to our table shortly after to apologize & offered if we wanted anything else for both me & hubby. We just added a salad since we're getting stuffed from the soup & calamari. The steak came back out juicy & more veggies.
Bryan S.,Upland  CA,162,12,,4/9/2014,1.0,I almost never complain or even write a review as you can see based on my account history  but after my experience last night I am forced to write this.Last night was my 33rd birthday  and I decided to have dinner here with my parent  my brother  my girlfriend  and her family. This was a Tuesday night at around 8pm. This isn't a busy night or time so I figured for a party of 8 this would work out quite well. I have been to this BJs countless times with my family and friends  so this led to my choice.Last night was the worst service I have ever received at any restaurant ever. Our party was sat and we waited upwards of 20 minutes. Then once our orders were taken the food took nearly 90 minutes before it was served. During that time our waiter came to the table twice. He was rushed  non-attentive  and overall a bad server. Finally the food came out  after two people in my party left because of the service  and most of the table wasn't even hungry any longer. Most of the table simply boxed the food. My brother  who also happens to be a food service employee  went to speak to the manager and explain the situation and received a cold and standard response that any automated life form might give. This was embarassing to me and my party. Then the manager had the audacity to come to the table  after my girlfriend had paid the check  and said sorry and that he felt bad. He then offered a $25 gift card  which wasn't even 10% of the check. It was obvious by his tone and his general demeanor that he could careless. I wanted to thank BJ's for ruining my 33rd birthday and wasting my girlfriend's money. I will never go to this BJ's again  eventhough it is less than a mile away from my house. And to be quite honest I will have to think long and hard about ever stepping into another BJ's again.
Jocelyn V.,Covina  CA,68,20,12,10/17/2015,4.0,BJs in West Covina never disappoints! Fast and friendly service :) I always come for the avocado rolls!
Joann L.,West Covina  CA,93,55,36,8/26/2014,2.0,Horrible night ever there.. frst time sitting in th bar area just to have drinks and dessert. For a Monday we thought it wont be that busy (which it wasnt) we get there order our drinks it took 20 mins.. we are in tge bar hello not good in my book. Then we order 2 just 2 pazookies and r u ready for this a whole freaking hour it took for 1 mini and 1 regular size. They came out and were hard no soft cookie middle. Althow the hightlight was our waiter friend got off early and had drinks with us so tht was a olus and turned the night around all in al Shame sham BJ's
Vivian P.,West Covina  CA,60,21,4,7/10/2014,1.0,Wow this BJ's location kinda sucks compared to the one I usually go to in the City of Industry. We go in around 5 and it is not busy at all. The person in the front is so rude! She asked if we wanted the sit in the tall tables and whatnot and me and my boyfriend were okay with it. But we realize there were booths open and no one had served us yet so we go back up and ask if we can be seated in the booths. And this girl acts like it's the HUGEST inconvenience. Seriously there is nobody else waiting and it is not busy at all  and all she had to do was see if there were any booths available. She didn't even have to take us to our seats. So after that we order our food  and I got the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Alfredo. My order did not meet my expectations  as it was very bland  especially the pineapple fried rice that came with it. Very little rice  and generally flavorless except for the pineapple bits. The fish was bland as well. I think it's pretty funny how they gave a teensy bit of sriracha sauce on the side. It seemed like they were attempting a design but it ended up looking like a mess. Boyfriend said that his was pretty bland too. The waiter was okay  but he was extremely busy to the point where he asked us if we wanted a pizookie but then left abruptly before I could even answer. And then took forever for the bill. Overall  horrible experience at this place.
Anthony R.,Vacaville  CA,211,18,12,7/12/2014,4.0,My first time here for weekend brunch. The usual breakfast fare of omelettes  pancakes  and French toast  but with the BJ's flare. Crispy on the outside  soft on the inside potatoes  delicious pancakes  and the enlightened veggie is perfect for anyone in the Mediterranean mood. Coffee wasn't burnt and actually tasted good!There wasn't anything noteworthy that would make this a regular trip  but will be back sometime in the future. Payton was a great waitress too!
Miguel R.,Los Angeles  CA,640,875,850,6/14/2012,3.0,Sadly  the most memorable thing about this BJ's was the little piece of straw paper (at least I hope that's what it was) floating in my Berry Burst drink. I love the Berry Burst drink and solely based on that I'm giving BJ's three stars. Oh  how I love you Berry Burst and I can thank Lydia B. for introducing me to it! This drink is pretty much the only reason I come to BJ's. Oh  I also like the Pazookies!I had a great time with my buddy Lydia B.! I always enjoy the Pesto Pizza here. Lydia ordered some good stuffed mushrooms and meatballs. I also ordered some Thai wraps which were very  very disappointing.The service was not bad  but not memorable either.Parking is not much of an issue since this BJ's is in a major mall.
Liz H.,West Covina  CA,296,9,,11/10/2015,1.0,Horrible service. Waited had a bad fucking attitude and only came once to see if we were okay. Hostess was not paying attention to guests names and wait times. Food took forever and never came to refill drinks or take plates away. I cannot stress it enough on how fucking horrible the service was here! Don't pay for shitty service!
Desiree M.,West Covina  CA,582,103,313,3/7/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,CHrystal is the best server ! She helped us out for my birthday a few months ago and today  I remembered her for how awesome she is ! Always on top of her shiet with a beautiful smile.. That's the kind of service I love to have. Came in for lunch specials  the margherita flatbread and salad is delicious! Also had the beer samplers which are always yummy.. They took it down to 4 beer tasters from what I believe was 6 or 7. I love the Tatonka  Jeremiah  Hef  and had the Abbey normal which is a seasonal. Gotta try the tasters !
Josh R.,  Taiwan,707,102,203,8/2/2015,3.0,Good all around American cuisine. Like the pizza here everything I have ordered has always been tasty. Love the cookie in a pan dessert with ice cream. Also if you sign up for the email list you can also get something for free for your birthday. They also have a bus card I believe that you get points for dinning and rewards. Always nice to find places rewarding you for your business.
Cesar C.,Los Angeles  CA,73,40,57,6/28/2015,5.0,Good service  good food  they are not stingy  they serve more than enough! Our waitress Kathryn was awesome and checked in on us often.
Cole P.,Glendora  CA,0,1,,7/1/2016,5.0,The restaurant was 5 stars. Our waiter Steven P was excellent and was very attentive he also made the restaurant feel like I was home for a thanksgiving meal. We were seated quickly and the food was great.
Neal G.,Chino  CA,98,3,2,6/5/2014,1.0,"Just had by far the worst experience here of all the times ive been here. Party of seven waited half an hour when the buzzer finally went off gathered the family when we came up had to wait more somehow they had already given away our table! We ordered simple things: 2 pizzas 2 kids meals and bunch of appetizers.....first the appetizers never came the pizzas came and kids meals. We were missing the sides for the kids meals and luckily manager came by to find out happened with our appetizers. Well the food was supposedly just ""sitting there"" and never got delivered. Kids fries never came came and we cancelled the appetizers order. Never coming back"
Richard E.,Torrance  CA,0,4,,6/4/2016,2.0,The service here is terrible! They told us it was going to be a five minute wait but it ended up being 25 minutes because they were seating people out of order. Everybody waiting was angry and complaining. The food was really good but the waitor took too long clearing the table and asking for refills. I'd rather find a different BJs to eat at. Poorly trained staff!
Megan W.,San Dimas  CA,101,26,5,8/5/2015,5.0,Food was delicious and the service was great! The waiter was very helpful and friendly  and the bill was not as expensive as I thought.
Ginger P.,Los Angeles  CA,163,46,7,2/22/2015,2.0,Okay  so... I love Bj's  always have. But this location... the service is ehhhh. The bar seems to only cater to regulars and if you are not one don't expect any kind of decent service. The hostess always has a lovely greeting which misleads you into thinking you might have a great dinning experience  but once you pass that line you enter a whole new world. Forgotten orders  rude bartenders and rushed service. Very sad  but thankfully there are many locations that we can still enjoy.
J M.,San Dimas  CA,48,102,193,5/7/2014,3.0,Order online ahead and get 20% off. This isn't the best DJs I'd recommend but definitely send menu has any other. The branch kind of sucks on Sundays hey bring the family one day to try it out and regretted not going to Denny's for norms which are just down the street. Happy hour is always great it's minimal finger food and mainly house years which can never go wrong. The reason I gave this place three stars is the service is pretty crappy at this location I have been here more than five occasions and have been disappointed  luckily it's the local BJ's so my options are very limited other than going to Montbello or Chino hills.
Anthony B.,Riverside  CA,511,690,483,5/7/2012,2.0,Seriously not impressed. It started out well and ended horribly.Point blank  the service was shit. The place was only 60% filled. Our server rarely came by to check on our refills. Now when I say came by  I mean walked past us and went about his business at other tables.This happened repeatedly through the night. We were given a break from this asshatery when he went on break (please don't ever come back). The replacement waiter is the only thing that saved this review from a straight up 1 star.There was no excuse to ignore our table  that was obviously needing refills.In turn this affected our thoughts of returning to this. We had considered it the next day but then we remembered our service and that was well enough to tell us to go elsewhere.Avoid.
Chip H.,La Puente  CA,0,3,,12/15/2015,1.0,Horrible. First we were seated right against a bus station  and the waitstaff kept slamming things loudly and violently against the back of our seats. Then later a waiter was talking to a waitress using profanity loud enough for me  my wife  and our children to hear. Our order took nearly an hour to bring out(--on a Tuesday evening!)  and both my sandwich and my wife's pizza were cold. I ordered another beer before our food came out  and it was brought to the table when we were all done eating. Don't bother with this place. It used to be OK  now terrible. Will not be back.
Tracy W.,San Dimas  CA,71,89,28,8/15/2014,5.0,I went there for dinner tonight and had great service from David. Got the 2 for 22. Great deal 2 salads medium pizza and a pizookie. So when I left I realized I forgot my leftover pizza. So I went back and told the Togo girl Mary what happened  now mind you I came back 2 minutes after I left. So anyway I told her what happened and the kitchen manager Eric just happened to be there and heard my complaint so he went above and beyond customer service and made me a whole new medium great white pizza!!!! I was shocked by this since they really didn't have to do that. So needless to say Mary and Eric showed me excellent customer service!!! I'm happy and I will definitely be back!!!!
Taylor-Marie A.,Las Vegas  NV,295,5,5,10/2/2015,3.0,Don't get the Brisket Bacon Burger. It's only a dollop of chopped brisket on the burger. The manager came to apologized and we ordered something else. She offered a free salad or soup while we wait. The pastas are a good size.
Tammy L.,Glendora  CA,212,105,32,7/8/2014,1.0,came here yesterday with my family and ugh  what is with this BJ's? We were lucky and the wait wasn't too long. Honestly  I have never had this pushy of a service as I have here. The waiter (i wont mention names  though I'll remember him)  I felt like he was trying to get us out of there as quickly as possible. We ordered the buffalo chicken pizza  and OMG  it was freaking salty  I drank a whole glass of water after eating one slice. (and i don't drink that much water at all). This was the worse pizza I've had here. We got the calamari appetizer which was lightly fried and pretty good. Hubby ordered the handcrafted root beer  which came with no ice (NO ICE????) what the heck... that was odd. Overall  I like BJ's but I will not come back to this locations  and Def not order the buffalo chicken pizza ever again.
T K.,West Los Angeles  CA,0,123,19,2/15/2014,1.0,This review is not for food. It's a chain  they all meet certain standard. It's about the hostess. Walked in  saw couple hostess at the stand. Just took names of one group  and one of the hostess walked away. The remaining one talked to the lady before us  then started to play with her touch screen system  played with her long blonde hair. Three minutes passed  she looked up ans saw me  I was about to tell her our name and how many in the party  but before I could say anything  she told me to wait. I thought she was having trouble with her system  so I waited.  Few minutes later  an older gentleman walked in and she took his name. right aftet that  she was going to take another lady's name down. At this point   me and bf just turned around and left. We are now down the other side of the mall at TGI Friday  got way better treatment.
Debbie R.,Covina  CA,1,15,,4/26/2016,4.0,Loving the Sweet Sin! If you want a quick seat when it's busy  head straight for the extensive bar seating and grab any open seat. It's rarely full  and no waiting.
Tammy C.,San Dimas  CA,308,468,874,11/12/2012,4.0,They have delicious chili in a sourdough bowl. Finish witha pizookie MMMMMMMMMMMMMM
Victoria A.,Pomona  CA,15,16,,1/20/2014,2.0,It doesn't hurt to smile! Or say you're welcome at least once!! The 2 stars are for the service only. The food was excellent as always  but the server and 1 of the runners were rude as heck. Overall  I will not return to that location. Chino Hills has a better vibe.
Kathy S.,Baldwin Park  CA,24,25,1,11/29/2016,3.0,We have visited this BJ's on several occasions. We usually get the Clam Chowder and it is wonderful. This time I ordered the deep dish pizza and a salad wedge. The pizza was good --- not great but pretty good. The salad wedge was horrible. The server saw me picking it apart -- that is because my knife couldn't cut through the lettuce core that had been left in the wedge. Two thirds of the wedge was inedible - I told the server and she offered to bring another...that what a good server does...however  I declined as I knew the pizza was coming and I didn't want to start over with a new salad...it was ok (it should not have been served in the first place and shame on the chef who let that come out but the server did the right thing all along) Pizza came and I was happy - I took a picture of the salad to send to a friend (or post on yelp) and it took only a few minutes before a manager was at the table insisting that I take a replacement salad. He was pushy and insistent even after I told him that I had already worked it out with the server - it was fine and asked him to please just let it go. So to the point - We are not likely to go back - not because of the salad but because the manager ruined our evening by being pushy and insistent even when we told him we didn't want another salad. Really  isn't that an awful way to end a special dinner with your lover by arguing with the manager. And just in case you are wondering  they did not make any adjustment on the bill.
Lawrence L.,Covina  CA,514,1035,7302,10/17/2010,4.0,2010 Game 1 NLCS Lincecum vs. Halladay... just needed to decide where to hang out to watch the game...BJ's is the answer for casual  cool vibes  and multiple screens to watch a sporting event  and it's close by for us...Sat at the bar and for libations ordered the 8 taster set of beer... liked the Piranah Pale Ale and the Jeremiah Red the most  the Lightswitch Lager and the Brewhouse Blonde which were pretty weak the least. My better half had a half pint Oktoberfest which is pretty good too. For eats  we ordered the Flat Bread Margherita Fresca pizza and the Best Beginnings appetizer plate... we liked the Margherita pizza the best  it was light and crisp  nice change for a pizza... we also liked the spinach artichoke dip of the appetizer sampler the best  the smokey taste was bomb!Great place to hang out w/friends... gets busy and parking is nuts sometimes so be prepared...
Rachel L.,West Covina  CA,33,4,2,11/21/2015,5.0,I have Celiac Disease  so eating out is tough. However  the general manager (Chris) went above and beyond for me. Nothing on the menu interested me so he offered to send one of his employees to get me food. I thought he was kidding. I wrote down my order for Chipotle and he sent his employee right away. If you're ever worried of eating out because of food restrictions  just ask! I've been to two BJ's in the past 24 hours and in both instances they were very accommodating. I wish there was more than 5 stars!! Can't say enough good things about them!
Heather H.,West Covina  CA,2,13,,4/28/2015,1.0,I have gone here about 6 different times. I don't get how a restaurant can be so bad and have so many locations. First off some of the worst service you will get. Do not expect fast or friendly service. The food is about a 4 out of 10. If you eat here you will be there a long time so don't think you can have a quick lunch.
Sergio L.,Los Angeles  CA,50,9,1,11/19/2014,5.0,Omg the Parmesan credited chicken was excellent I could of used a piece on bread with it but SHEA our server omg 100% on customer service kept our drinks coming checked on us omg !! We love him !! Will be coming when he bartends !!
Miranda W.,Upland  CA,1,4,2,9/23/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,We usually love coming to this BJ's  but recently we have been slightly disappointed. We used to go about once a week  but we have stopped going as often because their service has been lacking.Today  we came in at 11 and there were probably 5 other parties in the restaurant- it was pretty dead. We were seated immediately  and our drinks came right away. We ordered our food  but it didn't come for about 45 minutes  despite the fact that it wasn't busy at all. Our waiter didn't really check up on us  so we were left wondering if our food was coming at all. We finally got our food  ate it  and then ordered a pizookie. It took a long time for that to come out as well. We thought about just leaving  but couldn't because the waiter was nowhere to be found in order for us to get the check from him.Overall  the food is still good. You won't be disappointed there. However  the service and the kitchen have been rather disappointing lately.***Update: We just left  and had an amazing experience. Michelle H served us  and she was great! Very friendly and attentive. The food was very timely and the drinks came out quickly as well. Good to see that they got their service together since we last came here.
Gustavo F.,West Covina  CA,1,15,2,8/16/2015,3.0,Came in with a party of 10. Food was good  everything except a small detail on one of our plates was cooked as ordered. Our service on the other wasn't as great. Sat for more than 10 mins for refills on 5 of our drinks even though our waiter walked by our table more than once! One of us never got a refill at all. I come often and this is the first time our service has been unsatisfactory  hopefully it will be better next time around...
Paul K.,Newport News  VA,94,33,32,6/7/2014,3.0,Not a bad spot to get a quick lunch. Great OG style chicken wings and Salmon dish ain't too bad!
Ashley H.,La Puente  CA,0,7,,8/16/2015,2.0,I arrived with a party of 4.. our host  Jacob  was really friendly. He let us know that our waitress would be Ashley.. she seemed a little timid and confused about what she was doing. We asked her for a side of Buffalo sauce  but she forgot to bring it. That's a little disappointing when you're craving that to go along with your sandwich. Also  the Margarita that we ordered was just horrible!! The bartender on the shift must have not been paying attention because it was insanely sour!! Like did he decide to make his own ratio?! It was definitely not appreciated. Also  the California Flatbread we ordered was really burnt. Since when is it okay to serve an almost entirely black Flatbread??? The cooks really should be concerned  not only  with the taste but the presentation as well. I will more than likely not return to this location  I was not satisfied with my experience.
R R.,Walnut  CA,1,35,,4/27/2016,3.0,We have been here a few times and it is usually good. Tonight not so much. My husband ordered a Ceasar salad soup combo. The salad was drenched in dressing so he told the server who brought out another salad with dressing on the side. But the dressing was Horseradish sauce! The server took it back but my husband did not want a third salad. The mgr did take it off our bill; however he never came to our table. Our server was really nice and attentive.
Eric O.,Laguna Hills  CA,236,218,52,1/28/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,"Everyone deserves a second (and sometimes third) chance  BJ\'s is no different. If you read my previous review  you know I did not have the best of experiences. But I decided I wanted to go back today for lunch and try it out.As soon as I walked through the door  I was greeted with a cheerful ""Hello  welcome to BJ\'s"" by a smiling hostess (blonde  long pony-tail). We made small talk for a bit  and I asked if Emy  my amazing server from before  was working - and she was! I said I\'d wait however long I needed to for her section  and was told there would be no wait at all. I was handed off to another girl who seats people  and she took me to my table  chatting with me on the way.I passed Emy on the way to my table and she greeted me with a big smile and said  ""Hello Mr. Olsen!"". Ok  now that is service. I was officially impressed. When she came over  she asked me how I was doing  and even remembered my order from last time  down to my drink. Again  clearly impressed.I ordered the lunch BBQ platter (pork slider and bbq chicken with wedge fries)  and it was wonderful. Throughout the entire lunch  Emy checked in on me  and even remembered things we had talked about my last time in. I decided to indulge and have the pizookie (pizza-cookie) - white macadamia nut. So delicious  I can\'t believe I have never tried this before!I realize I was quite harsh in my last review - and while I feel it was well deserved  I also believe when a company makes a conscientious effort to fix a situation  they deserve to be recognized. I had a chance to meet with Cynthia  the manager I interacted with last time. We talked  and laughed  and she seemed genuinely interested in my experience at her restaurant today.Will I be back? Absolutely. This was a make-or-break visit  and the staff  service  and food were all wonderful."
AJ J.,San Jose  CA,7,15,,2/17/2015,3.0,BJ's has always had okay food and I do come back often. Service is never good though. Especially  at this location.
Courtney H.,Portland  OR,55,149,39,3/1/2014,1.0,"I came here for lunch last weekend on Saturday and doubt I\'ll ever go back.I had experienced mediocre service here before  but last week was out of control.After being seated  the ""waitress"" stopped by and said she would be right with us. We were then visited by 4 different people helping with drinks  food orders  and serving. I had to seek out a completely different waitress to get a plate for my pizza and silverware because no body bothered to bring those out either. After about 30 minutes and consuming all of our beers  we thought we might order another glass  but no one ever came back to the table. We had to get up to ask the hostess to get a manager so we could even get our bill. After leaving my credit card with the bill the same ""waitress"" comes by to pick it up  after about an hour passed from her initial hello. During the entire sitting  we saw the same ""waitress"" skip over our table and the neighbors next to us. The neighbors also complained and said they\'d never be back.The manager tried swaying us with a couple pizookie coupons which offended me and made me even more disgusted with the place. Thanks so much for the coupons! That made everything SO much better! Me thinks not. I would have been much happier with a discount on the shitty service instead of trying to persuade me to come back which I have no intention of doing.Beware of the horrible service and lack of genuine concern from the managers."
Monique W.,Covina  CA,250,23,1,5/23/2015,1.0,Had been coming here for years and just had a terrible experience. Ordered my pizza with no sauce and it was brought out TWICE with sauce on it. I was really patient and nice but at that point just didn't want anything. I was part of a big party but had to leave to breastfeed my baby and asked for a burger and fries to go. Manager came by  apologized  and said food was comped for my order. Good thing it was comped because the burger and fries they sent me home with were terrible!!!!! I was also given a gift card and I doubt I will use it at that location. I felt bad for the server because I could tell he felt terrible that they just couldn't get it right. It seemed like he was overworked and had too many tables but was honestly working hard and trying his best.
Daisy R.,Covina  CA,172,16,9,9/5/2015,3.0,when i went it was really dead there were a lot of employees just standing around they took 25 min to sit us but the food was amazing ill give them that. The hostess did not know what he was doing though.
Donald S.,Glendora  CA,139,356,337,5/20/2015,2.0,We ordered 4 different kinds of deep dish pizza. Sorry to report that it was the most bland pizza I've ever eaten. I thought that maybe it was just me  but afterward my son made the same comment. Service  Atmosphere and the burger my Mom had were all excellent  but I won't be coming back  at least not for the pizza.
P J.,Los Angeles  CA,2,61,3,7/24/2015\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,BJ's service has been redeemed by Ramon. Thank you for the amazing service and ninja-like skills. Food was good and the Jeremiah Red never disappoints. We will definitely be going back.
Geselle R.,La Puente  CA,0,35,22,7/21/2015,2.0,There's been a kid running around for the past hour while his parents sit in a booth. Not only is it dangerous and a hazard to the servers it's very annoying and distracting. The food was subpar and the drinks came our warm .
Carolita P.,Los Angeles  CA,2,22,,8/25/2015,5.0,Been here a few times but my most recent visit was this past Sunday afternoon. I went with my boyfriend and two close friends. Really wish I would've stuck with my gut and had came here for my birthday dinner last Thursday instead.... They never disappoint. This place is so good that you'll even catch their employees staying after their shifts to enjoy a nice meal or a cold drink by the bar.Parking: This location is placed in a shopping center so theres plenty of free parking nearby. Service: Excellent! Good customer service skills. Their staff is full of young  lively and friendly faces. The waiter that helped us out was very informative about the menu selections and made sure to inform us of their happy hour  specials and new drinks. I know that they are often busy and the waiting line and get really long but on this particular night that we went it was not too busy and we were quickly seated  assisted and served. Food: Without realizing it we so happened to arrive during one of their Happy Hour sessions (10PM-Closing) which was great! Cheap appetizers and booze  just what we were looking for! We had just gotten back from a long day at the beach so we were hungry! My boyfriend and I got their calamari  artichoke spinach dip  clam chowder soup in the bread bowl  a mini deep dish Mediterranean pizza w/jalapeos and pineapples. The calamari was just what I was expecting (calamari and not fried onions or leftover fried pieces)  the dip tasted freshly made (went great with the freshly made tortilla chips)  biggest bread bowl of soup i've ever seen (it also stayed hot the whole time we were there) and the mini deep dish pizza was only $6 for unlimited toppings! (smaller than a Little Caesars pizza but totally filling and worth it)Price: Not a cheap place to go to but its not expensive either. Definitely worth the food  service and drinks you receive.Overall we left happy and satisfied  I only regret the food coma we got afterwards....
Cindy C.,Fontana  CA,0,15,,7/17/2015,5.0,The shrimp scampi  roasted salmon  jambalaya & bi special were all delicious. Their peach beer was awesome o did I mention their margarita top shelf was also bomb.
Sergio C.,West Covina  CA,100,12,207,8/19/2015,5.0,We go to BJs strictly for the beer! Great selection of drinks. Love their blonde beer.
Tinzky H.,West Covina  CA,1,17,,2/25/2014,4.0,Chicken BarBQ deep dish pizza + Hefe = to die forCame here last Sat night and I was happy that there's enough crowd to have a festiv atmosphere but not too crowded that you have to wait long. Service is also good.
Michelle Y.,Los Angeles  CA,452,45,16,2/7/2014,3.0,Came cuz I was babysitting a picky friends kidService was horribly slowFood was cooked okKinda wished I went somewhere elseThe only good thing was the pazookie...but then again who doesn't like a half cooked melted cookie with Ice cream
William B.,San Juan Capistrano  CA,2,30,7,5/21/2015,4.0,I can only imagine why this spot has such a low average star rating. My review is based mainly just on the food I ordered  because my experience today was a simple Take-out order so I can't really report on the service  other than the food was hot  ready when I arrived and neatly packaged.Seeing as how it was for my birthday I decided to treat myself to a Ribeye dinner to-go. The steak itself was huge!! And cooked perfectly to my specifications (medium-rare  which in my humble opinion is the ONLY way to get steak  but anyways....).Along with it came my choice of two sides  of which I was given quite a lot of choices. Not just your typical soup or salad. I ended up going with asparagus and mashed potatoes. And I purchased an additional side mozzarella and tomato salad.My only complaint would be the asparagus was slightly under cooked which resulted in my pieces being extra chewy. But then again  at this point I'm just being fussy.All in all  I will definitely go back  I'm a big fan of BJ's.
Richard C.,San Dimas  CA,2,7,1,2/15/2015,3.0,Went to the bar for Sunday brunch. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich and my salad was made with wilted old lettuce. Other Than that the sandwich and beers were good.
Rosie L.,Ontario  CA,21,5,1,6/9/2015,5.0,Today we went to celebrate my nieces graduation and I have to say our waitress Charlotte was awesome. She made our experience there amazing  very personable  friendly and attentive. By far the best visit at any restaurant we have gone to and we were a party of 20 people.. Thank you Charlotte
J W.,San Bernardino  CA,2,91,57,3/6/2016,1.0,I am highly disappointed with BJ's today. My food came out cold  and the drinks were weak as hell. Bj's is my favorite but I will not be returning to this one in particular.
Lila B.,Diamond Bar  CA,58,93,294,7/25/2012,3.0,Lunch was good.. I ordered mini pizza & Caesar salad) with a refreshing Strawberry lemonade .. Sooooo good!! It's been crazy hot lately... I needed it.:)Hostess and our waitress were pleasant  the food came out fast  happy with the cheap bill. LolDefinitely can't come without ordering a PIZOOKIE... Chocolate chip!!! Yeeeee
Smith J.,Walnut  CA,0,14,,9/10/2014,3.0,I am in love with this place. Food is amazing. I would eat there every day if it wasn't that expensive lolService is good too. It's cool to be inside the restaurant
Diana H.,Baldwin Park  CA,576,699,1404,5/8/2012,5.0,Came here last night for my best girl friend's birthday. Wow  right off the bat the service was extrodinary. I think it's because we arrived just in the right time where it's not too crowded and the server was kind. After not drinking in literally months and not drinking a lick of alcohol in New York  I decided to drink that night. I ordered their new drink....mixed berry martini or something like that. I had two and at the end of the night  I honestly couldn't remember the exact name for the drink. I asked our server what he thought of the drink and he didn't know because it was new on the menu. He asked me  later on about the drink and I fairly enjoyed it. I enjoyed it enough to have two! haha I think I enjoyed the fact that he actually made my drink in front of me  it was pretty awesome. Now  my main course was the Garden Medley Salad. I love that salad so much! But I think it was the drink that I cared for to review. Overall  great night due to the drinks and the company. Spent $32 on two drinks and a salad. Perfect way to start off the week!
Michel C.,Ontario  CA,66,20,2,10/11/2013,4.0,"The food is always really good here and I tend to come here with a group of friends. That being said it can be a bit slow service wise. I went to go put our name in because i was anticipating that there would be a wait by the time my party would all be there. The woman at the front was a bit rude. I told her my party would all be here around 7:30 she kinda snapped ""well there is no waiting for a party of six  so just come up later"" I was like okay. So when most of my part was there we ended up having to wait like an extra 15mins. No big deal really I just felt perhaps she could have responded better. I worked in customer service before so I feel like I have a reasonable standard of how I would like to be treated.tl;dr versionthe food was great  the service was ok"
Brad S.,Los Angeles  CA,194,252,2,2/21/2015,2.0,Eeeck-We typically avoid these joints  but after a road trip we figured we'd stop in for a snack and libation. It's 5:30p on a Saturday and this place is packed  so we head to the bar area for a table. Servers we're hard to come by after 10 min  so we grabbed two available seats at the bar. Mistake 1: Mojita made from a mix-very sweet; ugh. Caloric intake on their appetizers; scary. TVs showing the games; makes this place tolerable. Wonder how long places like this will survive.
Jeff J.,Pasadena  CA,23,179,29,4/10/2014,2.0,Typical soul less  flavorless bar food devoid of all taste and imagination. Just your run of the mill less than mediocre quality burgers and sandwiches. Don't come here if you're vegetarian or pescatarian.  The few fish options are frozen and served either dry and hard or drowned in sugar sauce.Dragged here by co-worker who's taste and appreciation for food is equally tasteless  even though he flipped the bill  I swore never to return.Btw  maybe it's just me but places like BJ's  along with fast food-pretend-to-be-real food chains such as applebees always remind me the movie Waiting...
Dave D.,Whittier  CA,73,41,11,2/26/2014,2.0,Came here for dinner. They were busy  but I wouldn't say packed.  We were seated fairly quickly.  Once seated  it was about ten minutes before anyone checked on us to get us started on drinks or appetizers. By the time our waitress came around  we already knew what we wanted to order as an appetizer and main entre. Our appetizers came out first. No drinks yet. We then realized we had no utensils or napkins to eat with.  Kind of hard to eat Clam Chowder soup without a spoon.  We alert our waitress and it was another ten minutes before she came back  with our drinks and utensils. Our main entres came out about fifteen minutes later.  Drink refills were non existent. I only had water too.  My Ahi Tuna salad was a bit dry  so I asked for more vinaigrette.  What was brought to me was some sort of olive oil mix.  It didn't even taste like the vinaigrette that was on the salad.Needless to say we were done with our meals fairly quick.  We ordered a meal off the kids menu to take home and a dessert.  I joked when we ordered it at the end of our meal that it would take half an hour to get to us.  Sure enough it did.  A manager came and did her rounds.. And if it wasn't for her  I'm sure our food would of taken longer. We will probably never use this location again.
Steph S.,La Puente  CA,167,8,,5/25/2015,5.0,Haven't been to Bjs in a long time  but so glad I came in. John F. Is by far the most helpful  informative  personable waitor I've ever had. I will definitely be coming back and requesting his service. And this time I know exactly what beer I want.
Juan L.,Diamond Bar  CA,41,72,7,2/22/2015,5.0,Went there on a busy Friday night and was seated fairly quickly. Shane our server was attentive and very pleasant. Christian the food runner brought our orders out quickly and kept asking if we needed anything. Employees like them are why we keep coming back.
Carlos M.,La Puente  CA,0,21,4,10/6/2014,1.0,Took family to eat lunch  ordered a beer ( hef ) when the waitress brought it to me there was no lemon wedge so I tried to get her attention but failed so I stood up and walked up to her and asked her for a lemon wedge her reply was she is very busy it's going to be a few minutes so I told her I would go to the bar and get it myself she said no you can't I'll get it for you after a few minutes my lemon wedges came and a few minutes later the manager came I believe her name was Cynthia she asked how everything was and I told her the situation she was very polite and said she would take care of everything well she did she helped out for a while and then brought us a new waitress but after all this I don't think I would eat at BJ's again
Steve S.,Duarte  CA,40,3,,7/22/2015,1.0,If I could give this establishment zero stars I would. Do not ever order a keg from this Bj's. Their management is the most incompetent I think I have ever run across in terms of keeping a keg inventory. 1) When I picked up the keg they had no tap for it.2) The beer tasted horrible and was delivered luke warm3) It poured foamy4) When I returned the keg they even botched that.Besides the kegs the service at this BJ's is subpar. Slow and unattentive. You FAILED Bj's West Covina. Learn something from the Monrovia location which is much better
Adel D.,Duarte  CA,50,43,55,10/19/2014,5.0,First time at this BJ's and Justin our waiter was amazing ! I have been doing customer service for almost 10yrs and if I owned a business I would want him working for me ! Great customer service is the key to an establishment and he makes you want to come back for more. Working in the bar seating area gets pretty packed anywhere on a Sunday during a football game  so it takes a special person to be able to be attentive   accurate & kind and he hit all three thank you Justin for all your hard work !
John N.,La Verne  CA,2,105,4,4/1/2015,2.0,Went for lunch with the family. Food is just generic at best. It's the typical chain restaurant turn Em and churn em philosophy. Had the salmon it was very dry. Wife had a burned mini pizza. I can see why this place has such a low star rating.
Paul K.,Bandera  TX,375,553,283,2/6/2012,4.0,This BJ's isn't too bad. The staff is friendly  and they don't usually screw up my orders  but the parking here is terrible. Really terrible if you don't like walking  or your date has high heels. Otherwise  no complaints here.
Frankie M.,Covina  CA,0,7,4,7/18/2015,3.0,The back messed up our order and hour later the manager comes out and offers us soup and then that took another twenty mangers did not impress me but the waitress Denise made the unpleasant experience better she was very nice and super persistent to the managers that we need our food by now so she is the reason I'd come back
Karissa P.,Ontario  CA,272,15,13,9/14/2015,2.0,came here at 2:50 just in time for happy hour that started at 3. when our server came to our table we told her we wanted to order appetizers off happy hour. so we put in our entrees expecting her to come back to get or appetizers so we could get happy hour prices. our food comes out before she even came back to get our appetizer order. I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich with the pesto on the side. there was pesto on the sandwich and pesto on the side. the fries were cold. and the bread was rock hard. the server brought me a fresh one after though so we left content.

Prices are very very reasonable and the stuff is always smiling and makes sure you are happy with their service!
Haykitty V.,West Covina  CA,1,2,1,7/3/2014,2.0,We had horrible service Plus I had top sirloin was way over cooked and their salad was bad so I ordered soup instead and they charge me for both and their mashed potatoes were extra Dry the lemonade is extra sour the only good thing was the manager was trying to help us the manager was really nice everything else sucked ni got a pizookie to go and it was horrible and burnt and look like it was just throw on the plate
Jason Z.,West Covina  CA,0,3,,3/20/2016,1.0,I don't know where to begin  but here we go: we had a party of 25 and we got there it was just 6 regular tables apart from each other... Wtf  we are trying to go out as a family and celebrate a 40th bday party. It's not that often we can get together as a family like that  and we were at separate tables! Service wasn't good at all... There was beer spilled on my girls purse. I get mistakes are made  but come on. And my dinner which was a Ahi Tuna salad  was more of a side salad! It was tiny! If your establishment can't handle parties that big  maybe don't reserve them...and if your going to book those big parties... Do better! Once again how can I give less then one star. P.S. I'm not a restaurant basher  but this wasn't an enjoyable experience.
Shevonne P.,Glendora  CA,72,6,,11/16/2015,1.0,Normally me and my family don't have problems. But tonight for my birthday. The service was terrible. The waiter left never came back. His back up came explained he went on lunch. But he never told us. And didn't finish giving us our orders. On top of it all. I am not the one to go around saying people are bad people  or people go around stealing. But i did happen to leave my birthday card on the table where we eating. It even had money in it. Now they saying it isn't there that no one seen it. How so you miss a white envelope?? On a dark table?? Just saying. I am not going back any time soon after how the service was.... sorry. And the possibility of being lied to doesn't set well with me.
Kevin J.,Brooklyn  NY,76,43,12,2/18/2015,4.0,This place is known for their brews  they create there own beers and encourage you to have there. Which are really good  the stouts are pretty good and are worth the happy hour price which is $4. For a good beer at a reasonable price try BJ. Not sure what to try....They also have a beer sampler. Go for it!
Genius G.,Los Angeles  CA,259,114,140,2/17/2015,5.0,Ive been to this BJ's like 37 times now and never posted a review untill now. 1 reason only  my waitress this last time was the best. I got her name from the receipt (Susan H.) She was funny  nice  helpful  went out of her way for us  and my 6 year old daughter loved her. She was so patient while my daughter ordered her meal  well it took like 2 minutes to tell the waitress what she wanted. The food is always good here  thats why I spend all my money here on dinner and drinks  well I dont cook either so maybe thats why Im here so much. So in my opinion  Susan H. deserves a raise  or make her a manager or something because my little girl said so.
Fouad M.,San Diego  CA,13,228,3,1/22/2015,4.0,Went there recently and were quickly seated. The customer service was great and so was the atmosphere. There was not long wait time. I ordered Lemon Thyme Chicken which was just average. However  overall experience was good.
Heidi W.,Covina  CA,0,8,,3/15/2016,1.0,Worst dinner ever!! Ordered the top sirloin  baked potato and salad. Salad came with no dressing  steak was cold and potato not cooked. The pepsi was flat too! After one bite of each  the server asked how my food was and I said sorry I don't like any of it please bring me the check  I will pay for what I ate and drank and I won't be back! He got the manager I explained my dissatisfaction and she offered to excuse my check and I said no  I am going to at least pay for my drinks I do not want something for nothing but I won't be back.I'm not sure if they are cutting down in serving staff or what but I waited an hour for cold crappy food. I don't mind paying for good quality but I wouldn't give that to my dogs. I advised the manager I am now going to McDonald's! At least the food is hot!!Sad thing it wasn't the first time! I keep saying I will give them another chance but that is strike three!!! Too bad there are no 0 stars!
Theresa M.,El Monte  CA,22,25,8,9/11/2013,5.0,Great 2 for 20 deal here. My friend and I each got a salad (good portion)  split a medium pizza and shared a pazookie!! Top it off service was excellent  our waitress was friendly and checked up in us at Keats twice.Breakdown:Cob saladCaesar saladSplit medium - artichoke and spinach pizza and vegetarian pizzaChocolate chip pazookieWe each paid under 11 dollars.Great company  good food and great service!!!Next visit ill try their beers...
Elie M.,Covina  CA,3,17,12,3/2/2014,1.0,We just had a bad experience it wasn't so much the food but the service  it took for ever to get the meal after we complained twice about the time it took to get it. To make matters worse it took them a while to get our desert as well  even though you will think they would at least get that to us in a timely manner. Very disappointed.Recommendation to the management:Your servers should be aware of their table better- they should able to tell that the food is delayed and fix the problem before it arouses- a manager should be walking between tables and checking if everything is on time- something acknowledging customer helps and prevent mistakes to happen and most important is a smile.Trust me it doesn't matter how busy is this place one day It will be empty if they keep going this way.
Noelle R.,West Covina  CA,58,3,5,8/17/2014,1.0,I'm a regular at this BJ's whether it's a craving for pizookies or for their mojitos. sat in the bar area with a group. waitress didn't take our order until about 15-20 minutes after we sat down. food and drinks came out reasonable times. but when we wanted to order more it took us about 20-25 minutes to catch someone's attention and the waitress didn't even tell my group she was going on break or leaving for the night. and then once our pizookie came out  it was way overcooked  tasted and smelt burnt. once it came out again it was fine. but it's the worst service I've ever had at this location.
Belle B.,Walnut  CA,155,915,12428,4/10/2011,1.0,I don't know what it is. I ate here once and got really sick. I had a salad and pizza. It just turned my tummy. I thought maybe it was a fluke  so I tried it a second time. I got sick the second time as well. Believe me  I will not be coming back here to try it a third time.
Kevin J.,Pomona  CA,2,8,,4/28/2015,3.0,I was a little disappointed we got a flat bread pizza  cantina chicken. We thought it was an appetizer since it was small. Also they were cheap on the toppings. I think the whole pizza had five pieces of chicken.
Judy R.,Covina  CA,0,3,,2/12/2016,1.0,Service was terrible  server had nasty attitude. We called to make a compliant to manager. He assured me that this not tolerated in his Resturant. But I don't believe this statement.
Ann R.,Poway  CA,4,19,22,10/4/2014,3.0,Shout out to Curtis at the West Covina BJ's. A most entertaining staff member. Saves the night. Seated quickly thanks to the app. But service was pretty slow due to our poor waitress being given tables all across the restaurant. Food was Luke warm upon arrival and getting a refill on coffee was a challenge. Cynthia the manager and Ryan our waitress tried to remake our food which we totally appreciated. This BJs is extremely busy all the time but I would think and few tweaks in scheduling might make it better.
Diana E.,Covina  CA,0,52,,4/17/2015,5.0,Great lunch today! Tavern pizza  avocado egg rolls and scampi pasta!!! Service was spot on!! The pizza was super good.....avocado egg rolls with the sweet/sour sauce was really really yummy! The scampi pasta was just amazingly good!!! Delicate flavors and cooked just right...sooo yummy! Great service!!
Anna C.,La Habra  CA,55,19,2,12/30/2014,5.0,Took my nieces for a quick bite and was served by our favorite waitress  Emy. She is so knowledgeable about the menu and recommended a couple of things for the kids. We placed their order first and everything came out quickly. Food was great  but the service was better. Emy is so amazing. My youngest was cranky and wanted to get up. So Emy danced her around a bit  total life saver. Emy was attentive  patient  and proactive. I never had to ask for anything. Quick refills  ketchup bought with the food  and an endless supply of smiles. I highly recommend sitting in Emy's section when at this location.
Jenevieve L.,Diamond Bar  CA,29,33,122,1/20/2015,1.0,"Definitely not impressed with the service I received tonight. My brother suggested we go to Chili\'s after our Target run to get their cookie dessert when I told him ""oh no I\'ll take you to BJ\'s so you can try their pizookies!"" We arrived about an hour before closing only to find an empty host/hostess stand. We stood there for about 5 minutes looking around for someone to help us making eye contact multiple times with a man sitting at one of the tables in the bar who later turned out the be a host. He left the table  approached us and told us to take a seat anywhere in the bar  and went back to his table. No welcome or any sign of being a host. So we pick a table near other people so we would be noticed right away. Another 10 minutes pass and we\'re sitting at our table waiting for someone to check on us for drinks and to give us menus. We were almost on the verge on leaving until a blonde waitress who had seen us sitting at our table every time she came to check on her customers finally approached us and said oh someone will get you some menus. -________-I don\'t know if it\'s this location in general has bad service or if it\'s the closing shift people that aren\'t very attentive. But I definitely won\'t be going to this location for late night pizookies."
Grace C.,Beverly Hills  CA,327,465,19,6/10/2013,4.0,Good place for beer and sports. I happened to be in town when Kings were playing their disappointing loss against CHI town few days ago. Sigh~They have pretty good selection of beers on tap and in bottles. Can't complain. If you are hungry~ pair it with one of the signature pizza.
Jen C.,Covina  CA,0,22,4,2/28/2015,1.0,Had lunch here today and it was bad :( the menus were sticky and dirty ! Then my dad's mug that his rootbeer came in was filthy and had dried up crud on the side. The manager came over and she did was say sorry il have someone clean better next time. Smh I won't be back to this bjs for awhile
Greg A.,Baldwin Park  CA,0,10,,2/3/2016,5.0,Really like this Bj's it's super clean and they are very helpful with seating and helping you to be comfortable. Food is great never had an issue :))) 5 STARS
Danielle D.,Moreno Valley  CA,5,5,7,3/31/2014,2.0,Stopped in with a party of 4  which included a toddler and a 7 year old. The high chair was missing a clasp for the safety strap  so I asked for a replacement. The 2nd chair was even worse  missing clasp and an essential part which would have kept him from slipping out the front. I explained the problem to the waiter  after which we finally got a high chair with all parts accounted for. We got all our drinks quickly  except the toddler. Somehow  he was overlooked. Also the pizza for the 7 year old arrived about 15 minutes ahead of anyone else's meal. Luckily I had some crackers to occupy my toddler  otherwise we probably would have had to leave. I will add that all food and drink drop-off were done by other servers  not our initial waiter. The food was pretty good  but the uneven timing of the meal as well as other mishaps ruined the meal for us. I'll probably eat at BJs again  just not this one.
Roger R.,Los Angeles  CA,24,12,98,1/3/2015,1.0,I been to several BJ's before but this one is the worst. Slow service I believe we waited more than 10 to 15 minutes before someone came to ask us if we wanted order drinks. When they came we decided to order right away cause we didn't wanna wait another 15 minutes for them to take our order. When the food came my pizza was dry and burnt I threw half it away. I think I would have gotten a better pizza at Little Caesar for a quarter of the price I paid here. I'm never coming back to this BJ's.
Albert S.,Montclair  CA,41,39,1,6/19/2013,3.0,*hit or miss service (depending on which server you get)*Big parking lot*inexpensive Lunch menu*good caprese salad*Watermelon and feta salad is really refreshing *Tortilla soup is really tasty and has a bit of a tang*Awful chili (they just taste like beer)Would go again for their unlimited soup and salad lunch special
Don L.,West Covina  CA,141,16,8,6/13/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Last night I again stopped by this BJ's Restaurant for a light meal and a beer. As I was chatting with several friends there  I realized (to my HORROR!) that I had committed a cardinal sin in my last review. I FORGOT to include Ivanna as one of the special bartenders/servers/jill-of-all-trades who always treats me kindly and with great warmth and professionalism. I apologize for my mental lapse  and I encourage everyone who visit this restaurant/bar to recognize and praise Ivanna for her wonderful service and heart. Others I may have forgotten to mention last time are Roger  Shea (Shay?)  Matt  Ashley  Melissa  Cynthia  Tiffany  and a bunch of bartenders/servers who doubtlessly will nail me the next time I visit for not including them in this list. Everyone --- including management --- is very nice. Just come here and enjoy yourself! :--)
Carlos D.,Los Angeles  CA,0,11,,1/9/2016,5.0,"First time to this restaurant  I was expecting so so quality  but what a surprise  the waiting for a table was worth the service and food  I was expecting the dump down the road quality ""lazy dog"" restaurant in particular the quality of food   what a difference  I will definitely be back!"
Sedine S.,Los Angeles  CA,54,726,26,9/15/2011,3.0,Came here for Happy Hour. It can get super packed  so keep that in mind if you want to do Happy Hour. Also because it was opening night for the NFL so all the TV's had that going.Good beers  which are a dollar off during their Happy Hour. Their appetizers are also a dollar or two off  which is always good.Other than that  it's BJ's. It's nothing fancy. A place to get together with a group and whatnot.
Sue T.,West Covina  CA,0,11,,9/20/2015,2.0,Smells funky inside needs a renovation to remove that musty smell! Food is good as usual but can't stand the smell and guests as well. We had reception yesterday there after our grandchild's baptism.
Azalia A.,El Monte  CA,18,22,16,7/13/2014,3.0,I always come here a lot but yesterday the service was horrible it took us forever to get our drinks. Food was delicious but that pretty much was it. Hopefully next time service will be better.
Nicky R.,La Verne  CA,94,231,384,10/25/2014,1.0,I went here Saturday for dinner. It was busy and a little hard to find parking. Wait line was surprisingly not long despite for the place being packed. We ordered the avacado egg rolls for the appetizer and I ordered their mini cheese & tomato deep dish for my main meal. First  our appetizer came out with our meal. Second  they didn't bring us mini plates for the appetizer. Do they expect me to push my pizza on the side or something? There wasn't room! Third  my pizza barely had any sauce. I basically paid for cheese bread. I thought it was suppose to be a pizza? And fourth  my so called pizza or cheese bread was cold. It definitely wasn't worth the money. So disappointed. Waste of money.
Wendy T.,Baldwin Park  CA,28,151,37,10/5/2013,4.0,Good food  good drinks. Service is okay.Nice spot for happy hour :)Pizookies are highly recommended!
Joanne O.,San Diego  CA,32,3,4,1/2/2015,1.0,I have been to BJs before but this particular one I got horrible service. I was with a group of 6 people and we all agreed it was terrible. First of all  our waiter  was not welcoming  and I don't think I ever saw a smile on his face. Our drinks came after about 10 min and then we waited a little while longer to order our food. It took about 40 minutes for our food to arrive. During that time  he never came by to check on us  or refill our drinks. We were sitting at the booth with empty glasses for a good 10 minutes. Finally we started to get our food  and I realized that they got my order wrong  so I had to wait an extra 15 minutes for my food. Nobody asked is if we needed anything and so we kept trying to get someone's attention for water  condiments  etc. Overall  it was just an unpleasant experience.
Josie Y.,Lake Forest  CA,562,378,156,12/23/2012,5.0,This place was great  I hate to admit it was my first visit but I'm glad to report how tasty the food was. We went at lunch time and it was very busy but we got seated fairly quickly. I ordered a redtini *Awesome* (Belvedere martini) and the southern fried chicken lunch special with cheddar mashed potatoes and grilled corn it was sooo good. We started with the avocado egg rolls which were also very good. Service was good  a bit slow because they were busy but very friendly just the same. I look forward to my next visit.
Tina V.,City of Industry  CA,313,448,653,8/3/2011,4.0,I actually like this location better than the Rowland height's location. It is good place to come and hang with friends  grab a bite to eat  or drink with new menu items (alcohol or food) almost each time i come.Last night the bf and i came here for dinner and actually enjoyed our time and dinner. The waitress we had was so attentive and she chatted us up a few times but not too much. Surprisingly for a chain  we agree that was the best service we ever had there. Appetizer: +Stuff spinach and cheese mushrooms (3.5/5)It was good but kind of heavy on the cheese and not as fresh as i would like+Seared Ahi tuna (4/5)My bf loves it here  i had it in the RH location and hated it  mainly since i don't eat raw fish. But it wasn't bad here  it was quite fresh.+Clam Chowder Bread bowl (2.5/5)I love clam chowder and the sourdough bread at BJs. But the soup was kind of salty and become saltier the more you ate it for some reason.+Salads (Cesar and ranch) (2/5)Just didn't care for it. The two stars is the vegetables were fresh. Drinks:+BF: 8 taster set (light to dark beer) (5/5)Bf loved it  i don't drink beer so i don't know. But he liked how he can try all beer instead of just getting his usual porter. he hated the tonkanka or something like that.+Me: limited time Peach margarita (4/5)it was strong but not bitter and really good. Too bad its not a regular menu item. One cup got me kind of buzz for just a margarita.  Entree:+ Bf: Full rack of ribs: (4.5/5)The meat was tender and fell off the bone but not as tender as we would like and slightly dry. It was still good  the bf almost murder the whole thing and hes a small guy.+Me: Grilled Fresh Atlantic Salmon  (4/5)really heavy but good. We have ordered it before but blacken and i did not like it as much. The grilled version give it more tender favor and the salon flaked nicely without being dry. I didn't care for the veggie (no favor) or the rice (pure butter).Dessert:+Chocolate chip Pizookie (4/5)bottom line... you cant go wrong with their pizookie. It is what they are known for. yum. Overall (4/5) rating. The Service was really impeccable thanks to our waitress  too bad i didn't get her name. Hopefully we get her again next time.The food was good last night with a few dislikes (why i minus 1 star)End of the night we went home with a growler of their porter beer as the bf love their brew beer.
Christina C.,Glendora  CA,97,72,49,10/25/2014,4.0,Came here for lunch  which they do have great lunch specials  and i got the Chicken fettuccine pasta. I swear this pasta is so good!!!
Robert H.,La Puente  CA,0,29,8,4/11/2015,5.0,Great service and food! I love the pizza here  never fails to satisfy me! If your looking for some good pizza and a nice evening for sports come here! Tvs that can be seen from where ever your sitting.
Jocelyn K.,La Verne  CA,0,19,4,9/16/2014,4.0,"I love the great white pizza its my favorite. I came in on a weekday during lunch and the manager was very rude. She accidentally gave me the wrong drink and when I politely let her know she was extremely rude and said ""No your drink is correct"" when I replied with ""No it\'s not I ordered a Dr.Pepper"" she rolled her eyes and said okay. She then came back 10 minutes later and told my waitress ""She keeps saying her drink is wrong when it\'s right"". I\'m not sure what her issue was or if she was having a bad day but that\'s the only bad experience I\'ve had there."
Ryan K.,Redondo Beach  CA,46,4,,7/26/2014,4.0,First time here. Went for lunch and ordered the flat bread appetizers which were amazing. I wasn't as impressed with my main meal though. A Parmesan crusted chicken sandwich. Was good but not something I'd order again. Finally finished with the salted caramel pizookie. A delicious sweet and salty treat. I preferred it without the dark chocolate since it overpowers the other flavors but it's easy to just remove it. Overall friendly attentive staff and wide variety of food. Would come back again
Marvin M.,Montclair  CA,0,1,,1/8/2016,1.0,So me and my girlfriend decided to come here to this specific location for our anni. We asked to be seated in a booth. We waited over 15 minutes for someone to come and ask for just our drinks. The waiter approached and said oh I am sorry I didn't see you there. We didn't say anything because I am just not one to complain. We asked for our drinks a water with lemon and a Pepsi. 1) the Pepsi was flat and for some odd reason warm. 2) they didn't bring us our lemons AT ALL!!. Right when we got our drinks we ordered our food. In the section we were sitting at maybe 20 minutes into us being there they filled 2-3 more tables around us. 40 minutes after ordering our food we still hadn't received anything. It was not busy for them to make us wait that long. We than noticed that the 3 other tables that were seated 20 minutes after us were getting there food. Oh I was lit after that. The busboy was cleaning tables asked if we were ok and we explained our situation he told his manager and she came and brought us our food. I am not sure if the manager told our waiter anything but after that the waiter was filled with attitude towards us. She checked on everyone else but us we had to call her 2-3 times to bring us more napkins and more soda. She rolled her eyes at us and on top of that she had charged me for fries that I didn't order. I payed over $30 dollars for a meal that I didn't even enjoy. I told my company that is about 5 minutes from there to change there place for lunch. Because that experience was not one I would recommend someone to go to.
Ashley S.,Los Angeles  CA,75,156,32,12/11/2012,4.0,This BJ's is located within a center of restaurants and is almost always busy. Last time I went  I had to wait for 25 minutes  which has not happened in a while. I have had great service  but I have also had slower service. The last time I went  I felt overlooked because there were a couple of parties of about 8 or so. However  the food is always good  as are their pizookies. The red velvet one is my favorite!This is a place you can either come dressed up or stay casual. There are a lot of college students who get dressed up and go to BJ's  but then there are a lot of people who don't dress up.If you are looking for a fun place  I would give this a try. If there's a wait  it will usually go by fairly quickly. I've learned the faster you make up your mind here  the better the service you get. And when you need to pay  they are usually very good at splitting checks.
Melissa C.,Covina  CA,81,112,57,10/24/2014,1.0,Very God Place To Eat. My Boyfriend Took Me On A Special Date Here  Loved The Food  But The GIRLS Are Very Slutty. One Of The Girls Was All Lovey-Dovey With My Date. I Felt Like She Disrespected Me  She Came At Least 30 Times To See If Everything Was Okay Or If He Needed Anything. She Never Did Eye Contact With Me Only Him. And She Also Had The Nerve To Write A Heart On The Receipt. Usually People Draw A Happy Face Or Write Thank You  But No She Drew A Heart On The Receipt. This Will Not Stop Me For Coming Here Because The Food Was Good  Just The Staff Members Suck. Management  Please Have A Talk With All Your Staff Members.
Nila P.,Los Angeles  CA,25,8,1,2/7/2015,1.0,The service was bad! The waitress got our orders WRONG  and the food was SO DRY!! Girl  what was supposed to be a happy time to celebrate  was a time to bite our tongues (so they won't spit on our food) and wait  wait  and wait!
Leslie M.,Azusa  CA,98,6,,6/27/2014,5.0,5 stars!!! We have came here since it opened and after having a bad service we stayed away. However  manager Patrick write us a sincere apology and we came back today. The General Manager  Will  came up to us and was extremely kind and helpful. Thank you Will and Patrick for making our service great!
Rob P.,El Monte  CA,0,4,3,2/5/2015,2.0,Went there during the week around 3:30pm . The place was very slow so we figured we'd get fast service. Wrong!! Waited 20min for drinks. When the food came out they brought 1 plate . 10 min later the rest of the food came out...Its a SHAME to experience bad service when you go out to eat. I'm all for eating out and giving a good tip . But when the service sucks it's just too bad...
Samantha L.,San Francisco  CA,671,942,2021,10/4/2010,3.0,"One of the few chains I really enjoy and will chose to go to specifically. Their lunch specials are the BEST. Go Monday through Friday and spend less than $10 on a lunch sized portion meal. Their deep dish pizzas are especially great and a mini is the perfect size for most.They seemed to have added more seating at this location. Lunch time on a Sunday afternoon wasn\'t too busy - a lot of tables were taken but we were seated right away.Love their ""Small Bites"" section on their menu! Smaller portions than their appetizers but just enough if you\'re just in the mood to nibble on something else. I tried their bruschetta today.. came with 4 slightly larger than bite sized slices of buttery tasting bread with tomatoes and a light pesto sauce on the side. It was good!The soups only come in Large size or in a bread bowl. I opted for just the typical large bowl of chili and found it to be a lot smaller than i was hoping. Even so  they put some sour cream and cheese in it  and that was probably as much as I should have been eating anyways. PIZOOKIES! A white chocolate chunk macadamia pizookie with vanilla ice cream is still my favorite. A regular is large enough to split between 2-3 people. It\'s sweet  baked fresh out of the oven  and too good."
Melissa K.,Ontario  CA,3,52,6,10/18/2014,1.0,"Let me sum up my dreadful ""weekend brunch"" experience: over medium eggs were completely hard/well done  bacon tasted old and hard to eat  potatoes were dry and spongey  the waiter forgot my tea  water was not refilled  my honey\'s gravy was cold."
Lisett R.,Covina  CA,156,18,5,11/25/2014,2.0,I usually love bjs but service is getting worse every time I come ... Not once did the server come and ask if anything else was needed nor check on us. We had to ask a different server for another round   the food I got wasn't what I ordered and the second time around wasn't right either ... Just a bad experience in itself not to mention we were celebrating a birthday so just bad! All around !
Harikrishna M.,Arcadia  CA,2,13,,11/22/2015,3.0,Very poor service..food delivered first and water and plates were given after 10 mins..wrong bill given to me..very late in responding..no apologies.. No more coming here...!!!
Isaiah B.,Duarte  CA,0,1,,7/1/2016,5.0,the homie steven p was an absolute g. he had great service and was very kind and friendly. really praise him as a waiter and a person. had a great time at bj's.
Brett R.,Victorville  CA,1199,703,19,1/26/2013,5.0,BJ's is just awesome. The food is so good and the atmosphere is so warm that it doesn't matter if the service is slacking.When we were here  i think the server got loaded with a few tables  but it wasn't the end of the world  because EVERYthing is good here. Always love getting a BJ's.
Pete M.,Diamond Bar  CA,0,33,,3/1/2015,3.0,"A good friend and I were here on Friday  February 27. I was expecting a typically noisy Friday at a place that is one of those ""crowd pleasing"" establishments. We all know them  a place that is very loud  with boisterous people  and all that stuff for places of this type. This past Friday  in the early evening  a friend of mine and I went in and were seated in a nice booth. We waited for perhaps 15 or 20 minutes for someone to wait on us. Eventually  a nice young woman named ""Charlotte R."" came to us and asked if we had been seen. Charlotte wasn\'t our ""official"" server  but she apologized for our extended wait and brought our drinks and dinner. She was friendly  and we we had some laughs while she was at our table. Charlotte R came around often (but not too often) to ask who how things were going. I had the Jambalaya which was very  very good. My friend had a steak  baked potato  and so on. We agreed that the price for appetizers  drinks(2 each) and dinners for $86.00 plus tip was good. To conclude  Charlotte R is a great server  and I wish her well. Ask for her; you won\'t regret it."
Alex N.,San Dimas  CA,0,11,3,7/11/2014,2.0,30 minute wait to sit (normal).... 20 mins for waiter to greet us at table.... Never came to ask us if we needed anything. Everyone around looks super moody due to lack of service and waiting longer than normal. Was asked if we wanted desert  we said yes and they never came back lol
Jamie T.,West Covina  CA,73,48,18,9/22/2014,2.0,I've been here before but never wrote a review until now. I never have a problem with the food or service but tonight was all bad. I went for my friends bday and yes we had a table that had 12 people but it wasn't that busy. The server ignored me twice! Once was to order my drink! Another was to order my meal! He completely skipped twice over me! That's not cool. I finally got my drink which looked to me that someone took a drink already I just laughed it off making a silly joke about it! When I got my order (touscan chicken limone) the pasta tasted very bland and over cooked! The chicken looked like if was cooked in the microwave! I wasn't satisfied at all.
Rick S.,Upland  CA,15,74,4,9/18/2013,5.0,I was a little leery of going here with a friend last night after my horrible experience with BJ's in Montebello (see review). Much to my surprise and delight  however  the food  ambiance (that's French  you know) and service were all ... perfect! My friend had the Thai Salmon; I had the Tuscan Chicken Limone -- both phenomenally delicious. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Well done  BJ's! You have fully redeemed yourself in my book (up from your previous 1 star).
Mark C.,Azusa  CA,2,2,,12/26/2014,4.0,It's my favorite sit down chain restaurant for a reason. Avocado rolls are a must  chicken parmesan is an enjoyable dish that is worthwhile.
Chris T.,Sunnyvale  CA,15,53,,6/20/2014,1.0,Called ahead in advance for a table. We were told they couldn't make reservations but would put us on the list and it would most likely be a 25-30 minute wait. After getting there  we waited for an hour  being told multiple times that it would be a 10 minute wait  then a 15 minute wait  and finally the manager Patrick said he couldn't do anything except split our table up or wait. I understand places being busy  but being under quoted multiple times was infuriating and unacceptable. Hope they are able to figure something out  I've seen other BJ's at least bring out slices while people were waiting.
Jimmy K.,Montclair  CA,29,6,,2/7/2015,1.0,Came here for my girlfriends little brothers birthday. Worst experience of my life. Got seated at 8:20. Waited about 15. No waiter shows up I ask a waiter that was helping another table who was our waiter and we find out there wasn't a waiter or waitress assigned to our table. She was kind enough to take our order and she was already about to go home. Her boss said she couldn't help out our table so she just put the order in and we were sitting waiting for our drinks it took 30 minutes just to get our drinks. Never again am I coming to this Bj location.
Tayler K.,Covina  CA,0,11,1,1/28/2015,3.0,The service at his location is not as good as the other locations. The wait here is also longer at this one. Compairing to Cerritos  Brea  and Punte Hills  the amosphere and food taste is similar  but it beats he a Downey location....any place beats the Downey location. Im giving 3 stars because I ordered and Orange juice and they filled it with Ice. That means I really only got half a glass with the ice taking the other half. I wouldnt mind if they allow refills but they dont.
Stephanie B.,Glendora  CA,0,6,,2/24/2015,5.0,My husband and I lOVE BJ's Restaurant! :) We love their Pizza's so much! They are so   thick  fluffy  tasty  and filling! :) My husband loves to warm up his pizza leftovers the next morning for breakfast and he says it is just as good as the day he had it! I love to eat my pizza cold ^_^ yummy Oh  and their chocolate chip pizookie are AMAZING! :)
June M.,West Covina  CA,0,10,,6/5/2014,4.0,Place is good. If you plan on going at dinner time especially on game day  Friday/Saturday  or holidays  good luck. Expect to wait forever.I usually like coming here with my mom for lunch. Show up between 11-12  you should have no problem getting a table for 2-4. Any larger party  I would recommend calling ahead. Its not the fastest service  but not the slowest service. If you only have an hour  it might make you stress out a bit. If you have a rewards card  show it when you walk in  and then show it again when you order to your server. I only found out recently that you get additional points for the actual order as well as your visit. Beer selection is good  their lunch menu is nice and surprisingly not expensive. If you want to do a take-out  their service is really efficient. I've used that feature a few times  and the food is ready at the time they say it will be  and pick-up is relatively quick. They keep the food in the warmer next to the counter where you pick up gift cards so you can be in and out.
Darla D.,San Dimas  CA,165,881,671,8/22/2014,4.0,This is a nice big location. The bar area was quite large. Food and service was great. The only complaint I have is that it was exceptionally loud the evening I was there. I literally had to yell at the person I was with across the table to talk ...
Jeanette S.,Los Angeles  CA,706,204,559,6/6/2010,4.0,I came with a friend to enjoy some good food and drinks and luckily there was not a Laker game or we would've NEVER been seated and Laker fans typically ruin my appetite anyways  hahaha. There was a Dodger game  but still it wasn't too packed. We were seated right away and all of our food and drinks came out pretty quickly. I ordered a Strawberry Margarita and my friend ordered a Pomegranate Margarita  which were both very yummy. We ordered some Spinach dip to start off with  which was totally delicious and addicting  lol. I didn't want to eat that much of it so I wouldn't get full  but it was so good I couldn't help it and we kept eating it. For my meal I ordered a Turkey burger with fries  which turned out to be much bigger than I had imagined. Good Turkey burgers are hard to come by  and this one was super good  just really huge! My fries were also very good  but yea so much food I took a lot of that home. I've had some other not so great experiences at BJ's  but this one was for sure one of the better ones. Good and quick service and good food earned them 4 stars this time. They are a little pricey  for what it is but still I like this one and would for sure come back.
Nick W.,Los Angeles  CA,124,142,48,4/3/2013,4.0,Met some friends for late dinner  was not disappointed.My friend had priorly described the place as a higher quality Applebees  which I think was fair. Has more of a bigger sports bar vibe  with a more extensive menu and awesome beer selection. Hadn't eaten all day prior  so I was ready to demolish some food by the time we ordered. I got the jalapeo burger which was absolutely delicious. They had a gluten free menu for the flatmate to delve into. Always a plus when he can eat normal meals with the rest of civilization. Now... the best part: the pizookies. I've frequently heard of these magical mystical dishes ever since my arrival in Cali 3 months ago  but haven't had the honor of trying one before this night. Now I shall actively seek them out. BJ's had a great variety of them  which was daunting but exciting. Get a few different ones for the table  you won't be disappointed... however the gluten free flatmate might be  since they aren't GFree. Oh twells.
Jewseph B.,Azusa  CA,29,6,4,9/9/2014,4.0,One of my favorite places to eat in the area service is par food is good drinks are better
Imran K.,Walnut  CA,3708,718,48,4/3/2012,4.0,Ashley from BJ delivered a catered lunch in Covina rheumatology office. I was impressed Ashley is seen smiling   friendly and organised . She had all the pizza and salads. The salad with chicken breast sauted with onions  red peppers  Napa cabbage  green onions and sweet baby carrots tossed with our teriyaki sauce and served over sticky white rice topped with sesame seeds is awesome.The vegetarian pizza now on whole wheat deep dish pizza crust. With sliced mushrooms  green peppers  black olives  white onions and seasoned tomatoes.Well all thanks to Ashley for the excellent delivery on time and severed hot. Many times the food even does not show up.
Angelina C.,Pomona  CA,14,10,2,4/22/2016,1.0,I honestly used to love BJs until tonight. I ordered a curbside order for 9:15pm pick up. I was there at 9:10 sat in my car waiting and waiting. Finally at 10 pm I decided to go in and check if my order was ready as no one had been out that entire time. They checked and it was in the warmer and my salad was on top of the warmer. My order had probably been ready for awhile already and the girls at take out were standing there not doing anything I'm not sure why it wasn't brought out. Anyway I paid for my order and went to my car. Once I got to my car I checked and was given the wrong entree  even had the wrong name so I walked back in... The guys order I got was there picking up his order and the same girl that packed my order wrong had my order ready to go in his bag so they switched them and I finally got to go home to eat after over an hour. I got home to what was supposed to be a medium steak  no blood should flowing out when I put my fork in it to cut but of course it was pretty rare and blood was everywhere. My mozzarella tomato salad had 2 slices of tomato to go with all my mozzarella  pathetic. Lastly my baked potato was supposed to come with chives and sour cream but instead I got butter and chives. Overall my $20 dinner was not worth one penny and I'm so glad I didn't leave a tip. Horrible horrible service.
Ronney L.,Alhambra  CA,511,126,256,11/12/2012,4.0,Mmm pazookie :)
rod s.,Baldwin Park  CA,0,4,,10/18/2014,1.0,Horrible service! Waste of time. Waited for 40 min and food is not up to par. Manager cannot handle the job of running a restaurant. Better food nearby.
Rafa C.,El Monte  CA,10,2,1,1/16/2014,1.0,"Well there\'s no big surprise that this place only has 3/5 stars  which would mean it is a mediocre establishment; however  I\'m a rating it as a single star  and that\'s only because I haven\'t figured out how to give a place something lower that that. I went to the place last Thursday night for happy hour  and while the beer was good and atmosphere pleasant  the service was horrible. Our first round of beers came quick enough and our food order was placed for our group. We began our conversation and lost track of time and before we knew it we needed a refill. Out came round 2. Only round 2 took a little longer. No terrible yet but definitely lost that 5th Star. Again conversations continued and again lost track of time.  Then we noticed we were getting Really hungry and there was no food in sight  and neither was our waiter. We checked the time and as it turned out and hour and a half had elapsed  4th Star lost. What\'s the deal? Where\'s the food? Not only did I almost have to stand on the table in order to wave down our waiter  3rd Star lost  but when he finally decided to grace us with his presence he explained to us that he had ""forgotten to push the SEND button on our food order."" Lost 2nd star. Now mistakes happen And I understand; but what I couldn\'t understand is when the shift manager came over to apologies for the discrepancy she did not bother to offer a free meal  or discount on the beers  or Even a free Birthday Pizookie!!! This would be where they would have lost the final Star. Thanks a a bunch West Covina BJ\'s  way to represent your franchise."
R. M.,La Verne  CA,2,5,,1/22/2016,3.0,Today I went to BJ's and as usual it was loud  but that's okay because its that type of place and my hubby likes it. Now I have always enjoyed my food i.e. the taste and the appearance of it  but inevitably something was wrong with my order. This is the second time I have ordered something that was not quite right. The first time a couple months ago I ordered a mango salad  it came it looked nice and as I ate it  I realized something was not quite right...bingo!!!  no mango! what? they forgot to put in the mango  told my waiter  he handled it and the actual manager delivered a new salad properly made and apologized. Ok fine  that was that. Well  today I ordered the mahi tacos  as usual looked good  but such a miniscule amount of mahi I could hardly find it in there  (and I know that's what I'm paying for). I brought it to the waiters attention  and of course they gave me a whole new order with still such a teeny tiny bit of mahi inside  I believe that is just the way they serve them because I checked my 2nd one from the 2nd order and it was just a bit there too. Anyway  I'm saying this to say I wouldn't order that if you're looking for mahi  because the taco consisted mainly of the fish taco slaw/salad which was quite tasty  but the fish is the star of the show if you ask me. All in all  I'll probably go back there and get my usual pizza and as long as they keep giving me a second order every time they mess up.
W C.,Chino Hills  CA,22,14,1,1/19/2014,1.0,I have tried this BJs a few times and have been disappointed. I would avoid this location if you can.
Adrian V.,West Covina  CA,73,6,,11/11/2015,1.0,disappointed at the lack of attention we received by the staff. we had a waiter and a waitress and both failed to place the order for my two daughters that we ordered. they brought out my wifes and my plate and disappeared after that. our girls were hungry so we just fed them our food  glad we didn't order anything spicy! looks like we're going to have to stop for a second dinner on the way home. dont think i'll be coming back here... didnt see the staff again until the were ready to bring our check... very unprofessional
Marina R.,Los Angeles  CA,69,413,1163,8/8/2012,3.0,I think the food here is OK  not great but not bad. Their menu is huge and has more pages than most novels. You're bound to find something to order. The fried artichokes are cooked perfectly and the seasoning is tasty.1 star for the extremely dangerous slippery floors found at every single BJ's everywhere. Even in flats I always seem to fall (sober) and catch myself on a conveniently located table or chair.Besides that the service was good and their locally made cream soda is one of the best I've ever tasted.
Victor U.,Baldwin Park  CA,38,7,,6/24/2014,5.0,My favorite place to get fresh beer with some fresh and delicious pasta/burgers/pizza/etc. I definitely recommend going to this place if you've never been there before. Thumbs way up
Jonathan R.,Covina  CA,1,4,1,3/20/2015,1.0,I WAS ACCUSED! I've been there twice and on my second visit CYNTHIA walked to my booth and said a waiter noticed I had left without paying previously. Never have I experienced something so embarrassing she didn't seem to care for an explanation rather she played coy and pretended that it was a possible mistake. In fact even after paying she didn't thank me or apologize. Worst experience ever CYNTHIA RUDE AF! Please stay away she will accuse you of dine and dashing. Ewwww
Brandon B.,Pasadena  CA,1,3,,8/8/2014,3.0,This review deserves to be a 2.5 but I thought I'd be generous. Me and my family came here for dinner today. But there was multiple problems. My turkey burger was good. My mother seemed to enjoy her salmon. But. My fathers burger was over cooked he requested medium but it seems that it was cooked well done  and my sisters steak was tough as tire. And to top it off the dessert took longer than the main course. Step your game up BJs or you've lost customers.
Aerial A.,Los Angeles  CA,19,604,67,6/19/2014,5.0,I actually really like BJs! I went here for free Pizookie Day and it was amazing!
Rachel G.,Baldwin Park  CA,26,15,10,12/22/2013,4.0,"Came here for lunch today with mom  we had the same server who we had been with on a previous visit  when I first saw her coming over I thought  ""Oh no "" because the last time she really did not seem to know what she was doing. Today though  she did very well and seemed to be in a good mood so that was a plus :). Food was very good  I had the Tomato Bisque & Scampi Pasta  mom had Chicken Tortilla Soup & a green salad. The only complaint I have is that service was a bit slow  which it usually is here."
Dan F.,San Dimas  CA,11,4,,7/28/2015,4.0,Always busy and a positive Vibe. Menu has a lot of variety and pricing is fair. Usually good service   especially from one server named John  he was very helpful and always available for whatever we needed.
Dan D.,San Dimas  CA,103,392,14,1/23/2013,4.0,We have never been disappointed with the food service or value here. Always try to order something different and its always good. They turn on the NHL network for me and the Lakers were losing so it was great night
Sara M.,Covina  CA,34,11,,2/22/2012,5.0,i have been to Bj's a couple different times. Again when i was drinking their drinks werent weak but i could only have a couple. i primarily drink beer but fills me up to quickly. this is the only place i will order a mix drink. their egg rolls and filled with avacado which i could eat all day if i could. very fresh and well made. my mom had the steak and a grilled chicken sandwich. I am NOT a fan of the service at the restaurant though. It takes forever  and when you ask another waiter/waitress for something they give you attitude. The bartenders are enjoyable though! haha!
El Rey D.,West Covina  CA,0,11,,6/29/2015,1.0,My sister and I visited this location on 6-29-15 and was very dissapointed with the service. The hostess was polite but for some reason would not look at me in the eye and insisted on speaking with my sister even though I was doing the talking. I don't know what that was about. Maybe she thought we were a couple & didn't want my sister to think she was flirting with me? I don't know but in any case it was not professional and made my sister & I uncomfortable. Our waitress's name was Marlena she was slow and lacked any sense of urgency  professionalism or service. I saw her chit-chatting with fellow employees and other patrons before  during and after our meal while disregarding my table and her other tables. I had to get her attention twice while she was wasting time and chatting with a man at another table and showing him pictures of her children on her phone. When I finally got her attention she seemed annoyed & brought us a refill of the wrong beverage. Anyway I'm usually a big tipper & feel bad when I leave without tipping even if the service was subpar. This time I gladly left 0 tip with no regret! It will be a very long time before I even consider giving this place another chance. People not only pay for food but also service and ambiance both of which were ruined by our waitress!!!
Juan R.,Pasadena  CA,0,6,,5/29/2014,1.0,Horrible! Don't go even if it's a special occasion. Worst experience. No place setting. Wrong food and couldn't explain why. Wanted to argue. Manager needs to be replaced. Will never come back.
Brenda B.,Covina  CA,80,88,71,10/16/2011,1.0,Ugh...I went to BJ's two years ago and everything was crap. I decided to give it a second chance last night because my boyfriend really likes their brews. We were seated right away...or we should've been...wet got to our table and it wasn't cleaned up. So we had to wait for someone to clean it. Meanwhile the hostess was chatting it up with us. She was nice. I guess we annoyed some customer and he yelled at us to go away (lolwtf?) finally about 10 minutes later we were seated next to that guy that yelled at us...which was kinda awkward.Our waiter arrived right away and we ordered our food.My boyfriend wanted to try the seasonal Pumpkin Ale but wasn't sure about it  so the waiter offered a sample. It was delicious. The beer hit you in layers. First it was the alcohol  then the pumpkin  then the cinnamon and then the cloves...all to blend harmoniously at the end. It was great. We ordered the Exxxtra Hot 5 Pepper Hot Wings as an appetizer. I ordered them extra crispy. They arrived soggy. They weren't too spicy and they were pretty good. But I've had loads better.My boyfriend ordered the Country Fried Steak Dinner...The mashed potatoes were probably half butter  I tasted it right away. The steak wasn't seasoned enough. I had to season it for him and he agreed it tasted much better after.I ordered the fish taco dinner...Not seasoned at all...like seriously.Overall....I had to season everything. They even had Salt and Pepper on the tables...If I go to a restaurant I should never have to season my own food. BJ's will not get a third chance.
Logan H.,San Clemente  CA,7,113,21,4/6/2014,4.0,Its BJ's ... come for the pizza and a pizzookie. I cant say how their breakfast is because I have never had it. I tend not to trust places known for their lunch and dinner menus  when they start serving breakfast. Its just like ihop  even when I go for dinner i order breakfast menu items. thats just me
Alan M.,Los Angeles  CA,7,130,63,1/29/2012,2.0,"I\'m preaching similar reviews that give this particular chain 2-3 stars.  If you don\'t mind long waits and slow service  then this place is for you.  Let\'s start with the positives - the atmosphere is pretty much the same as any BJ\'s. I\'ve been to the Glendale and Montebello chains for lunch and never had any issues. I came to this one last night (for the first time) with a group of 15. Although we called in advanced  we still had to wait for 45 minutes.  I expected waiting since we had a large group and this was a peak Saturday night time. (8pm) At around the 30 minute wait mark  I overhead the manager tell the person who controlled the front desk to let the party of 8 and 6 go ahead of our group. I was ready to tell our group to walk over to Islands restaurant which I saw from the distance. I don\'t like to complain to the front desk person/greeter or whatever you call them. I was polite but she must be having a bad evening. She gave excuses such as:""well you should call days in advance if you have large party""""10 more minutes...."" (repeatedly)The worst excuse for the long wait was:""you didn\'t tell me your entire party was here. Ok  now we can put you in the queue"" (or words to that effect) My friend was more assertive with the manager and eventually we got were seated. By the ways  the gal/greeter who manned the front gave me this bitchy look and said  ""next time you should phone several days in advanced"" (Ok  I guess this place isn\'t good for impomptu dinners)The food is consistently okay (as with the rest of chain).  The pizza was delicious as usual. Since we had a large party  we had two servers. We ordered our food as soon as we were seated. Since we were waiting in the lobby  we tried to make sure we knew what to order since we were hungry. I was fortunate to be at the end of the table which had quicker delivery of the food. The other end had the slow service. They got their pizza and calzone AFTER we finished ours.  (Yes  we passed some of our food to them. How much longer? About 40 minutes! Yes! Again  one person in our party assertively spoke to the manager who said dessert on the house.  Hence  my rating goes from two stars to three stars. Geez Louis  we could have ordered a pizza and had it delivered quicker. One of my buddies was tempted to that at the 20 minute wait period. If we did that  the waiter probably would have spit in our food.I don\'t believe the bad service was intentional. I simply believe they can\'t handle the peak times.So my advice to you if you go at Saturday/Friday night and if you have a large party: - expect 1.5 hours - split up your party- I don\'t think the servers are happy to work in a demanding environment- if you are in rush  skip this restaurant and find a nearby restaurant.The place is probably a 3 star if we did not have to wait and given the run around.If you have a large group of 10 or more  this place is a 2 stars.  A two-stars in Yelp implies ""I\'ve experienced better"""
Ricardo G.,West Covina  CA,31,24,,9/19/2013,2.0,"Love the food here at Bj\'s and it is definitely the only thing that keeps me coming.With that said  the service is usually pretty bad.The other night that I went was no different.I can\'t remember the name of the waitress that helped us but she is probably in her 40s-50s  white  and the past couple of times that we have been there she has served us in the bar late at night.The first time  I wanted to try a different beer so I asked her opinion about the Tatonka Stout  and she said that it was great  that she really loved it and that I should try it out. So I took her advice and tried it out. Now  I\'m no newb to dark beers  but really  that beer was kinda gross. Gross to the point where I only drank half and just left the rest. But! That is not the upsetting part because I wanted to try something new and I knew that there was a possibility that I would not like and that would absolutely not be the waitresses fault. So the next time we go  we got put in her section again. She asked what I would have and I said I would think about it because last time I tried the Tatonka Stout and it wasn\'t very good  and she replies ""oh yeah  the tatonka stout has a really weird taste  I wouldn\'t recommend it!"" So I just laughed to myself and I\'m thinking - what a dick  you know?So I order some other drink  a raspberry type soda or something because I was thirsty as hell and I wanted something with refills. So she brings it  and it is actually very good and as many times I asked for a refill she just wouldn\'t bring it. I saw her come to the tables next to me and bring them refills and every time she came by me she said that she would be right back with my refill. Haha it wasn\'t until we were literally about to walk out  we had already paid and everything that she finally brought me the refill  and again I\'m left thinking - what a dick! If it was a busy day I would be a little more sympathetic  but both times were during the week and the place was not packed like it gets on weekends.Damn you Bj\'s for luring me into your establishment with great food but terrible customer service!"
Jay J.,Upland  CA,19,10,4,7/8/2014,1.0,This is one of the worst experiences I've had. We sat at the tables close to the bar  what made me angry was other people were getting their drinks before ours. What kind of service is this?? Plus the other waiters weren't very friendly. Just from that experience I won't be going for a long time until new people start working there. Management has some work to do with teaching their employees customer service skills. If you don't like your job  THEN QUIT!!!
Cyndi M.,Pomona  CA,0,24,,5/31/2015,2.0,Went for dinner and was not impressed with it. Service was great but my meal could have been better. I ordered fish and chips but when I received my plate the fish batter was soggy as though it had been sitting in oil. Fries were so-so. This plate was highly recommended by the waitress. My husband's rib eye was cooked to perfection but was tough! Now I know why I stay away from BJ's!
Larissa A.,Corona  CA,1,8,3,6/30/2015,1.0,As much as my family enjoys the food  the service is horrible. This place is always so busy but they never seem to have enough staff. The kitchen is on the other side of the restaurant and takes the servers forever to bring your food. If you are hungry  don't come here.
Corey T.,Covina  CA,2,4,,5/24/2014,5.0,By far the best service I've had here. Nicole is an amazing bartender and treats you well! Great communication and very attentive! I will definitely be back!
Amber H.,Moreno Valley  CA,1,11,,8/9/2015,2.0,My sister nephew and I walked in for lunch today. A panel behind a poster sign in the lobby fell on my nephews head. We were seated right after. The food was good. But the service was lacking. I think this location would benefit from a team effort. Yes we had a runner bring our food. But because of the distance from our table to the kitchen anything else we needed took longer then it should in a lunch service. Unfortunately this looks bad on the servers.
Brichelle B.,West Covina  CA,101,30,2,5/11/2015,1.0,I will not be returning to this location! The waitress was awful! Took over two hours to get a salad and soup that we ordered as an entree. And when it came the salad was soggy and the soup was cold! This is the second time that this waitress has given us bad service!
Jennifer D.,Covina  CA,34,67,15,11/17/2013,3.0,1 star for the wait . 2 stars for the food . And 3 stars for service. Good thing is I complained about all three and got our food on the house . When my food came my husbands burger was burned and we got a freeeal after that . Will never go back .
Simone V.,West Covina  CA,156,137,190,8/26/2011,4.0,Great spot to hang out with friends. Was there last night with some good friends and we had their appetizer sampler platter. The artichoke dip was pretty tasty  tho we were there more on a mission to drink the night away. I had their wild berry and white peach mojito. They were both very refreshing. I also had their strawberry martini. It was pretty light and tasty as well. Their dirty martini was just right for me  tho my friend would beg to differ. Overall  their drinks were well mixed and just right and thier service was good too.
Rachel C.,Duarte  CA,13,51,1,3/6/2014,3.0,Avocado egg rolls - yum. Seared ahi salad with Wasabi salad was yum too!! Kids menu offers standard kid foods  but spaghetti was a hit!
Alexis R.,Rosemead  CA,256,23,7,9/18/2013,3.0,Very busy on a Wednesday night. Waited over 40 min for a mini pizza. Cheese wasn't as melted on the pizza and pepperoni was oddly stacked in the middle. Pazooki hit the spot! Would have gave BJs 4 stars  but the cleanliness of the place was off. The menu was still wet and partially dirty and the floor under the table was disgusting! BJs is really good so of course I'll try it again.
Catalina T.,Azusa  CA,666,732,2220,2/1/2008,5.0,first time there was a lunch trip for some food and the famously known pazooki that wilson and his friends talked about. I wanted to experience it for my own since i have a sweet tooth. i had fettuccini alfredo and it was pretty good. I've also been there during happy hour and had some of their special pizzas  not bad and pretty good prize  affordable for us college students. so my first time there wilson  his friends and i ordered pazooki party platter. WONDERFUL!! its a must if you have a sweet tooth. its a huge giant cookie  still warm from the oven with ice cream and whipped cream on top. i have also had the cookies n cream pazookie  probably my favorite. so if you into bjs for lunch or dinner  just remember  there is always room for dessert and order a pazookie  it will make you happy.service has always been pretty decent there. decent waiting time and pretty friendly.
Gus H.,La Puente  CA,30,46,3,5/24/2015,1.0,I'm unsure..... Lipstick was on the coffee cup. Supposedly it was was washed? Sick sick sick. Plus  they never brought me what i ordered. The waiter charged it and then later removed it.
Tom S.,Duarte  CA,23,54,,7/1/2012,4.0,"Usually when I eat at BJs  I\'ll either get pizza or one of their sandwiches. This time I ordered the ribeye steak and it was surprisingly good. I say that because you don\'t usually think of BJs as a place to get a good steak  but this could hold its own against a lot of steakhouses. Had the white cheddar mashed potatoes and chicken tortilla soup for sides. Washed it down with one of their signature beers  the ""Nit Wit"". This is a great place to go if you\'re out with your buddies and want to go to a place with a sports bar like atmosphere. Plenty of TVs around the place  including a humongous one at the bar that shows four channels at once. Always fun to try the different beers and the food is better than what you usually get at sports bars."
Tom C.,Seal Beach  CA,0,3,,11/3/2013,1.0,Disappointing.  Went on a Sunday evening. Wasn't packed  but plenty of customers. Good atmosphere. Seated promptly. Server was nice and took our drink orders. Ordered appetizers and then main courses. The disappointment was in the delay of getting the food to us. No special order or requests where made  just basic orders. Second disappointment  cold pizza. Really? Delay in one of our items also.....then Mgr came over to apologize. We appreciate that he did that and he took both cold and delayed pizzas off the bill. Then we ordered pazookie cookie dessert. It was triple deal  three little cookies. One was hard as a rock.  Server put in order for full size and Manager brought item himself and apologized again....and took off the bill. Overall bummed  rarely go to BJ's and to get a poor experience puts this place in doubt to return.
Tiffany N.,West Covina  CA,335,544,162,1/7/2012,4.0,Good & quick service. Although our waitress did get my order wrong this one time  she made up for it because she brought it out rather quickly. We went when there was a Laker game so of course it was super packed. Nonetheless  BJ's always has good food. Pizookie is the BEEEEEST.
Shelly M.,Los Angeles  CA,0,29,38,8/4/2013,2.0,I've been here a few time when it was crowded but this time was just awful. Our service was less than poor and each time someone came out 20 min later saying sorry. I would've left but I wanted my chicken salad out appetizers came about 25 minutes later and other tables were served waitress Ashleigh was overwhelmed then 40min later was told she dropped food.. Only complained after we received food don't trust people..just had the worst experience will never go back again...food was warm. My tip was to do better!!!!!
Christina K.,Los Angeles  CA,1875,502,121,7/24/2011,3.0,Umm...just from looking at it you could tell my root beer was completely flat. Why was there no ice in it either? Initially  the waitress was impersonal  but warmed up a little throughout our meal. The appetizer came out and it was not what we ordered so waited for them to correct it. Waitress then brings the check out. What if I wanted some dessert? Jesus. Is it that difficult? Pizza is always good here. I would stay away from the ahi appetizer. Just a pile of lettuce  tiny bits of ahi  and few speckles of avocado.
Tammy T.,Woodside  NY,203,214,2281,10/27/2009,3.0,It might have been a sports night cause it was pretty loud. Other then that  it was alright. I don't think I'd go back  even if I was visiting Phoenix again. Just not my style of dinner. I like to hear my company rather then just seeing their lips move. But  like I said  it might have been some sort of sports even. If it wasn't than  even worst  it's just way too loud in there.We just ordered a bunch of stuff  and did it family style. Leave it to the group of Asians in Phoenix to do it that way.The pizza was pretty good  along with the Santa Fe Salad. My favorite was the Cajan pasta. The bread was pretty tough though  like break the teeth kind. GGgggrrrr!
Gretzel R.,Riverside  CA,303,11,11,1/9/2014,3.0,We came here for the niner game and of course my hubby wanted to sit right in front of the tv that played the game. The place was pretty packed but they accommodated our request to have our table in front of the game. Our server was very nice  but i have to admit our food took a while to get there. They didn't have the rootbeer ready for my husband but gave him cream soda instead. He wasn't so crazy about it but we appreciated the thoughtfulness. Overall  this place was good.
Joshua G.,Modesto  CA,25,53,21,1/28/2014,3.0,The food was great  the service was just mediocre. We visited here on 1/25/14. We sat in the bar area. The restaurant was busy  and our waitress was kind  but forgot several parts of our order  and it seemed to take an inordinate amount of time to get our food.
Tasha M.,Long Beach  CA,25,178,75,12/15/2013,2.0,"Sooooo happy to be visiting family and we decided to eat at BJ\'s after a lil xmas shopping in the area. It was sooooo packed but the wait time to be seated was only 15-20 minutes. We decided  hey why wait let\'s hit up the bar area so we can get right to eating. Well that was the worst decision that we made. Our waiter Ramon comes over and greets us. Asks if we would like to start w our drinks  I ask what sodas do u carry and his reply ""Pepsi products"". I say hmmmm ok so thays Pepsi and uhhhh? I say this because I\'m not an advit soda drinker more like water drinker. I felt his response was soooo wrong to a customer. Ramon rarely checked on our table  my aunt had to flag him down to get more hot water n lemon (she was sick). She finally just asked for a kettle of hot water this way we dont have to worry about Ramon ignoring our table. It was sooooo sad because my aunt and I always base our decision for a tip and how great of a tip on the first 7-10 minutes of ther server catering to us. Ramon seemed more interested in his larger group tables  but lil did he know I am a great tipper bcus I understand their line of work. He brought my cuzns cream soda w no straw  that took forever to get. He brought out only 1 set of silverware n napkin when there were 3 of us. This was just by far the worst restaurant service ever. I have been to the one in Cerritos which is my fav many times to watch games hang out n chill with friends. Best service ever there. Maybe because I am from the Long Beach South Bay area my standards for servive expectations are just higher because of what I am accustom to. I only gave BJ\'s a 2 star becuase the food was great  now that was consistent :) It\'s soooooo sad to have bad service like this from BJ\'S  when I know they train them well. Hell I hired one of their employees to work for me at the bank and he was the best employee ever who also got promoted quickly. Ohhhh I say Ramon as that is the name on my receipt bcus the server did not identify himself upon initial arrival to our table"
Alison W.,San Jose  CA,374,1586,929,11/12/2011,3.0,BJ's is probably my one of my favorite sit down chain restaurants. Reasonably priced and delicious food  esp their lunch specials and they have one of my favorite desserts - the pizookie. Even though essentially it's a giant cookie with ice cream. Haha. Anyways stopped in while out on the job for a quick lunch. We all went with the lunch specials - the half sandwich with soup or salad was the most popular. I wanted something more flat so I got the pizza and soup. Clam chowder was very salty. The pizza - a mini deep dish with meatballs was delish. I love deep dish. Only finished half of it so had another meal. And all for $5.95. So inexpensive. Service was a bit lacking but overall you did it for me again Bjs!
Jackie G.,Ontario  CA,0,4,,6/1/2015,5.0,Went in for a quick dinner with friends  I've never been to a BJ's for the beer (I know I know) but it all changed when I met John F. He was very knowledgeable of the beer and was really attentive with us! The brewhouse blonde is now my favorite! I will definitely be returning for the whole experience when I have a DD lol
Savannah C.,Ontario  CA,39,24,90,1/23/2012,2.0,Been to this location a few times.. ALWAYS disappointed!Honeslty  I go to BJ's for the pizookies.. went this Saturday and the worst pizookie! The cookie was waaaay uncooked and server did nothing about it. Meh..
Ezequiel F.,El Monte  CA,13,1,,2/6/2014,2.0,One of the worst service that I have ever received. The waitress serving me seems to give me the run around and blames other staff for mistakes...I've enjoyed my food at other BJ's but this location doesn't seem to get their things together
Natalie D.,San Dimas  CA,0,1,,5/26/2014,1.0,A friend and I had dinner here on Saturday evening. I arrived at 6 and was immediately seated. The service was terrible!We ordered an appetizer  which came out promptly  however we were not given any plates. We waited and finally our server walked by and I asked for plates. About 10 minutes later we asked a different server walking by if we could have plates. We had to ask a 3rd server if we were expected to eat off the tables or would it be too much to get plates. The appetizer was cold by the time we got plates. We ordered the house Blonde beer. After ordering a 2nd beer  the server brought a different kind saying they were out of the blonde. We asked for a bottled beer instead and he brought out something we didn't order  saying they were changing all beers. A gentleman in a blue shirt  appeared to be a manager  walked by and checked to see how things were. We explained that the service was very slow and we were waiting for awhile for our drinks. He said he would check and let us know but he did not return.Our server (Christopher) eventually returned with the bottled beer that we ordered. Christopher never asked if we wanted a glass  so my friend asked for one. He returned with the cold glass about 15 minutes later. The food was good (even the cold appetizer) but service is bad. This is the 2nd time I have received terrible service at this particular location. I figured the first time it was just one of those rare incidents and just chalked it up to them being busy. Today was the worst service I have ever had at any restaurant and I wish we had gone elsewhere.
Raquel P.,Covina  CA,64,48,17,2/20/2012,4.0,this is the BJ's restaurant close to home. My family comes here when we want spinach/artichoke pizza. Their asian chicken lettuce wrap and buffalo wings are the appetizers we get. I also like their sweet pig pizza. The wait isn't too long. It's in the shopping center by target  office depot  styles for less  ross  old navy bed bath and beyond dollar tree party city marshalls  and more. They check on you occasionally to see if you need anything like refills or ranch. They refill your drink when they see that your glass is empty. I like this BJ's and is the only one I've been to that's close to home.and they give you a free pizookie for your birthday. =)
Nicole H.,West Covina  CA,57,7,,5/20/2013,2.0,This Bjs is anything but prompt. I have never been greeted by a server at my table in less than five minutes. One time it took 15 minutes before someone even came over. I was beginning to think i wasnt going to get helped at all. The waiters have no energy and you're lucky to get a smile. I really don't think they care much about their customers but I do enjoy some of the menu items so ill give it 2 stars. The management that ive seen around is usually friendly. Definitely wont be coming here as often with these recent experiences  however.
David T.,Covina  CA,0,3,,4/5/2015,2.0,My wife and I used to love coming here. Everything used to be fresh and hot. But I think they changed to frozen ingredients. Not the same satisfaction. Dry and tasteless.
Scott D.,Covina  CA,7,23,17,9/2/2013,2.0,This is not a general review  just a review of my service on Labor Day. I was so looking forward to placing a quick order over the phone and stopping by to pick it up. The first attempt at calling resulted in a long hold  when somebody finally came on to the line they put me on hold again. Then  they put me on hold a third time. *click* Yup  that's right  long holds and followed by a hang up. Okay  second phone call. After TWO MORE HOLDS I finally got to place my order! It only took three read-backs of my order to get it right. Look  I get that it's busy  but Jiminy Christmas  get somebody to handle the phones. Pizza still really good.
Cynthia P.,West Covina  CA,181,91,184,10/26/2011,4.0,Its the bomb for beer  appetizers and dessert! My friend and I always come her when we wanna go out to eat have have a few beers in the daytime! Cool spot to chill  gossip and get fat!
Audrey C.,New York  NY,688,198,142,2/9/2011,4.0,PIzoooookie. I'm just drooling having to think about it. I've tried every single cookie and they're alllll delicious. On top of that  I've gotten their asian chicken salad  all of their pastas  their baked potato  the club sandwich  a couple of their mini pizzas and a couple other dishes I forgot the names of . Needless to say  I come here a lot..Something I recently discovered is calling in and picking up the food. It's hot and fresh when you go get it and you don't have to wait!I love the laid back atmosphere of the place. It's a place to go to watch sports and just hang out with friends. The service is great too in spite of the fact that everyone that works there is practically in college and high school. I've been to countless birthday and other group events here and it's very accommodating for large groups. Beware on weekends because it is sure to get packed starting at 5.
Danmo H.,Montclair  CA,230,589,1910,9/29/2011,3.0,Great deal on lunch specials! I read the calorie count on the dishes  and usually go with the all you can eat soup and salad. Minnestrone is delicious! And I can always be persuaded to pretend it's my birthday so I can have a free p'zookie.
Reina G.,West Covina  CA,0,3,,3/28/2015,1.0,Worst experience ever. Hour and a half wait for our food. When my order finally came out they forgot my mashed potatoes when I asked our waiter her response was you substituted for a salad when I never said such thing  it gets better she gives me the attitude when I told her that wasn't true. Worst experience I would not recommend this BJS in Covina.
Hardi W.,Diamond Bar  CA,8,9,,1/24/2012,4.0,I love this place.. The place always pack on weekends but luckily we always find some seats on the bar when waiting our table.. their avocado rolls is the best appetizer ever .. then goes the pizzas and Jeremiah Red beer. The service is great  the waiters are always friendly. October is always a special ones  since they have the Pumpkin beer.... cheers !!
Riza A.,West Covina  CA,10,31,11,9/4/2014,1.0,Worst service from beginning to the end. Took my Mom for lunch today and we had a server who was younger Asian girl who was absolutely the most inattentive waitress. We had to call her over to request to put our orders in after time passed with zero attention to the table. I had to call her over to fill my drink  she than filled mine and left my Moms below ice level. I noticed our neighbors at the table closeby getting much better service for obvious reasons  they were a larger party. Our order finally arrives and the chicken in my tacos was stale (hard as a rock) and appeared to have been sitting over night. I than asked for a manager and got Will the GM. He said a lot of nice things and apologizes and turned us over to a new server. After another 10 mins I get a new plate. After eating we requested our check from John our new server who than disappeared. We had no choice but to revert back to the original waitress who delivered the check. It included the stale chicken plate. I than asked for a business card some other guy who was another manager and Will both showed up and Will said our meal was paid for (my cc was already ran I'll update if I get a credit so far nada). Just a overall horrible experience. I've used bjs for both business and personal. I hope they get their act together.
Gretchen R.,Claremont  CA,302,170,5,10/6/2011,2.0,This is the worst BJ's I've been to. I've been to several around Southern California and this one has the worst service and worst food quality. It might be because this one is really busy.They didn't bring out my salad and I had to ask for it and my uncle's salad as well. Blue cheese dressing was sour/vinegary. Not good.The pizza was good and so was the pizookie  both were as expected.We had to flag down the server to get drink refills and even then  they didn't bring them and we had to ask again.
Justin J.,Chino  CA,114,210,50,12/20/2013,4.0,Great beers and desserts. Mahi salad is perfect  and the beer.. oh the BEER! My fave is the blonde! But don't ask the bartenders for help in picking out what you are looking for. For some reason  they don't have an understanding on what drinks mesh will with which foods. Always been that way  and still like that today. Weird..
Sarah L.,West Covina  CA,0,4,,5/2/2014,4.0,Great beer and food. Love the avocado egg rolls. Great place to watch sports and drink some house brewed beers
Laretta C.,Lakewood  CA,32,14,4,8/1/2014,5.0,Can't thank Brian the manager for the great job he did on setting up a rehearsal dinner for my son's wedding they were very organized and it went smooth he made it very easy . And the price was reasonable also. Thanks again Laretta
Silvia B.,West Covina  CA,7,32,3,3/16/2013,1.0,The absolute worst-ordered an appetizer-hot wings-took a while to get them-once we did they were cold!!! the service was horrible-waiter got my order wrong-!!! i wil never eat there again!!!!
Shaunna C.,Covina  CA,67,176,10,11/1/2011,2.0,I am not a huge fan of BJs  but the few times I have been here or ordered take-out  the food is decent and the staff has been alright. Nothing outstanding about this place at all.I am really just unimpressed  but I can't think of anything particularly bad to say. The food is nothing special  everyday average bar food  basically - it will do when you're hungry. I will likely go back for their home brew  maybe an appetizer  but I would rather head elsewhere for a nice meal.
Danielle A.,Denver  CO,224,82,3,9/18/2013,2.0,"Came into BJ\'s last night for a friends birthday dinner. Got there on a Monday night and the place was pretty empty so we were able to get a table right away. We were seated and a server came over right away to get our drink orders  also has another guy with her but doesnt introduce and say ""He is training"" or anything. We got our drinks but were not asked if we wanted to try any of the beers or alcohol. No upselling here. We all ordered and received our food. We got stuffed mushrooms  moroccan chicken  and moroccan salmon  and a southwest salad. All of these items were from the 500 and under menu. Dont be fooled  it may be half the calories because it is certainly less than half the portion but for full prices. My chicken ended up coming out as salmon so I just ate it because although the restaurant was fairly empty  we waited about 30 minutes for our food. The salad was so pathetic and small  think about 2 cups of lettuce and a couple slices of avocado. The stuffed mushrooms (which is an appetizer) would not have been enough for the table  it was like a snack (think edamame). My couscous was cold and I was still hungry after my meal yet it came out to a whopping $13. I don\'t mind paying for good food but it was cold and the portions were actually upsetting. It was my friends birthday so she got a pizzookie and we were amazed that the server said  ""we ran out of vanilla ice cream""  I mean did the pope run out of Bibles? Seriously! So we go a trio and had to get all chocolate  despite Baskin Robbins  neighborhood walmart  and Albertsons being in the same parking lot. When we got the dessert the ice cream was already almost melted and completely covering the cookie and the cookie was not warm. The chocolate ice cream was way to much. As we are about to take a bite of our dessert our neighboring table gets their dessert and.............. they got vanilla ice-cream. We told the waitress we really wanted vanilla and she said  ""yah I know  they just got it  sorry"". Okay? So we finished our dessert. The manager came over and said ""how was everything?"" and I said kind of a disappointment because we didnt have the dessert the way we normally like it he then said ""oh bummer  yah we just ran out of it"". Then he literally tossed 2 giftcards on the table and said ""these have anywhere between 5-500 dollars on it for your next visit""  well there were four of us at the table. So I proceeded to say  ""well for the inconvenience can we all get one? We did have luke warm meals and no ice-cream"" then he said something so ridiculous for a manager that I am offended. He said  ""Well did you have separate checks? I said  ""well we could but we wanted it to be easier for the server""  He said  ""WOW FEISTY""  then threw two more at the table and walked away. WALKED AWAY!!!!! I guess the manager is new and his name is Manny. I was so shocked that he had talked to me that way and that he had such an issue with giving us 2 extra cards. Especially because if we came back on 4 different instances with different or more friends wouldnt that end up being more money for this branch? Just saying. The food here has really gone down and the service was terrible. I was appalled at the way we were spoken too and by a manager no less. Really disappointed with this location. I think we were really treated unfairly. It really wasnt so much the vanilla ice cream but more the service and quality of care and food we had received up until that point. TSK TSK BJS."
Joe Q.,La Verne  CA,0,2,,4/10/2014\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,5.0,Did not expect to be eating here today  but a nice surprise  I'm glad we did! I'm always happy with the food. I even tried something new! Service was great once again! It seems everyone who worked there was concerned with how we were doing and making sure we had everything we needed. I go for the many different beers and the wife loves the top shelf margaritas  but the fun times keep us coming back!
Marla C.,West Covina  CA,0,14,2,3/3/2013,1.0,Poor service! Too many food choices in the West Covina area to be dissappointed.
Rashel P.,Irvine  CA,536,167,117,8/15/2013,3.0,Not too bad for a chain restaurant. I like the ambiance. Cool to go to either with friends of family. The loud atmosphere is fun especially at the bar. The food portions are big just as most chains and the food is what I would expect. Mediocre. Their appetizers taste like and have the quality of something I can find in the frozen section of Costco. The service is okay. Mostly young people just trying to make a lil money...
Pier H.,Los Angeles  CA,237,351,127,6/6/2011,3.0,Typical huge chain restaurant service and food.  Not too much stands out for me on the menu besides the pizookie's which are freakin awesome. I love the tripple chocolate pizookie and I think its the best on the menu. The chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream on top  but the vanilla ice cream tastes pretty terrible lately  like its not real ice cream or something. The chocolate ice cream tastes much better.
A P.,Fort Collins  CO,0,38,,3/17/2014,2.0,Good food  but it is always WAY too expensive for the portion size and quality of the food. Had better at other restaurants  even had better at home (much cheaper too!)
Amy T.,San Dimas  CA,0,18,1,8/4/2014,5.0,Went for a quick lunch today with my spouse and son. We have had some questionable service at other places recently so our expectations were minimal at best. What an absolute pleasure that we went to BJ's. The food was spot on delicious but better yet our server was one of the best we've ever had anywhere. Rebecca A. was at the top of the game. We will be going back thanks to her and the quality of the food.
Stephanie A.,Glendora  CA,5,44,99,9/20/2013,4.0,I love this place the best beer for me is the Jerry Burst very good on the dark side of beer but not too heavy :) I love the Ahi Poke it is delicious and that beer I mentioned goes great with the Hand tossed chicken barbecue or the hand tossed Bjs favorite. I like this pizza more the original pizza because it is not full of too much bread. The hand toss pizza is just perfect. I love this place for dinner or just drinks you'll find it here every time.
Ronnie T.,Los Angeles  CA,129,95,43,11/27/2012,2.0,It's been awhile since I have posted a review and I really hate to make my first one in awhile a negative one  but I wanted to share my story. BJ's has always been a place where I have enjoyed their brews and pizza's. It has been awhile since I attended this location. We decided to go on a Saturday night around 9:30. The place was not too crowded we waited 10 mins to be seated we were a party of six. My family and I had not gone out for awhile so we wanted to go out and shoot the Sh*t for a while. We ordered a round of drinks and some wings to start  we later ordered a second round of drinks and more appetizers. The highlight of the night and the only reason this review gets 2 stars and not 1 is because there was no large pizza's so we were given a medium pizza and a small. That is a lot of pizza a lot more than a large. Upon finishing our meal (we barely put a dent in the pizza) we were given our bill. At this point it was around 11pm. We ignored the bill because we had no intentions on leaving we were just hanging out and having drinks. The server came by around 3 times to see if we took care of the check. Finally she explained to us she was getting off her shift and if we could close out the bill. Fair enough she has to go. She could have explained that from the start  and she should have brought us a replacement server. This is what is normally done in these situations its happened to all of us. Server goes off shift a new server is brought in. We paid the bill and told the server we had no intentions on leaving. She said that was ok. We sat there finishing our drinks and waited for about 20 mins. At this point we wanted another round. We flagged down a server. He took our order and promptly brought us our order and along with a bill for that order. Again we had no intentions on leaving. At this point we were all getting frustrated. It felt as though we were being rushed out. I tried to look for a manager or someone I could talk to  but there was no one around. Other gripes that were expressed at our table was the lack of music throughout the restaurant. Its not a deal breaker for me as I don't like loud music  but some music would have been nice. In the end we all left dissatisfied and wondered why were treated this way. BJ's has lost my business for good. The Applebees in Azusa has much better service and it's a place in my opinion a notch below BJ's. A say notch below because I feel BJ's is a tad more upscale compared to Chilli's  Friday's and Applebees  but they proved to me that is not the case in terms of service. I was wondering if this would have been different if we were seated in the bar area and not the restaurant  but I am not willing to find out. I would avoid this place. There are far too many locations in this area that are more deserving of your business.Ill keep it working class at Applebee's where I always get great service and a great atmosphere.
Jesse E.,La Puente  CA,0,9,1,1/17/2015,4.0,Food is great. I recomend the Barbeque Bison burger. Rib eye steak very delicious.
Michael L.,San Ramon  CA,70,10,7,10/15/2013,3.0,I have to comment about the lack of timely service here. It is good when they actually make it to your table  but its the in between times that are bad. We waited 15 min after being seated to have our order taken  and then another 20 after we were finished to get our bill back to us. Definatly the worst BJ'S location I have been to.
Mark R.,La Verne  CA,0,31,,2/25/2015,2.0,the food was good  the waiter was very pleasant  but the service was v e r y slowstrange... the server did not serve the food  nor the dessertmaybe if the waiter was able to perform all the roles. i.e. greet  take the order  deliver items  repeat  the service would have been more efficient?
Ophelia C.,La Puente  CA,2,13,4,12/19/2012,5.0,Never once have I been dissapointed. Food is always hot and ready quick  drinks are always refilled promptly  service is all around excellent!....BJ's in Wesco  you guys rock!
Vanessa C.,Glendora  CA,102,14,3,10/1/2013,1.0,Horrible service tonight!! Our waitress forgot our appetizer plates  the utensils  forgot my honey mustard  and spilled the water....My soup tasted like it's been sitting all day.
Karla V.,West Covina  CA,32,71,3,10/21/2012,1.0,i rarely come here. I've been here about 4 times in my life time and now i remember why- the food is not that impressive. there is nothing playful nor mysterious. it took us a while to decide on what to order. i got the new thai chicken salad. the chicken was super dry... it really dried up my mouth. the food is very blah. chicken wings are good but a little over a buck each. bjs is not a place i dream on visiting again. Also  is super loud and a once again  the dental assistant thug-ish and slightly over weight girls from Eastern San Gabriel Valley come here.
Shenandoah S.,West Covina  CA,106,138,7,5/19/2013,3.0,Pricey but the food is good and the service is usually nice. It's a clean place and they make the best Arnold Palmers. So  yes  I will be going back.
O H.,Covina  CA,3,59,,1/9/2013,2.0,"BJ\'s of West Covina stands out among the many restaurants because of its size and decor  but that is where it ends at least for this writer. I joined several friends for lunch on a lazy Thursday afternoon. The noon rush was over and the place was generally empty as several severs were clustered chatting. We were seated and the usual colorful menus were given to us with a drink order asked before we had been seated ten seconds. The waitress/server appeared bored and distant and thankfully said she would return  a minute later she returned to ""take your order."" We finally ordered drinks and she pointed out the lunch specials indicating her favorites. Most notable was the flat bread with salad and the half baked potato.The flatbread was burned on the edges  dry and lacked any imagination  with its adjoining salad that lacked any significant amount of dressing. The uncooked half baked potato was drenched in some sort of chili sauce covered with sour cream and onions. The waitress/server did not return to check on whether there was any problem with the order and efforts to summon here revealed that she had left and no one knew who had replaced her. The saving grace was our conversation in seeing old friends and renewing old ties. Our party did not consume much of the food and the dishes were set aside to continue our conversation. A person in our party physically had to find a server to bring the check and when she arrived she merely placed it on the table and left with no word regarding our food. The check was paid and she finally noticed little of the food had been consumed asking if we wanted doggie bags. We told her the food was horrible and were upset that no one attended to us  she curtly apologized and left. And we followed suit leaving disappointed. Bad food  bad service not a place to come to between shifts....."
Chris P.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,3,,2/3/2013,2.0,The only reason I'm giving two stars is because I liked my Raspberry Iced Tea. The establishment wasn't crowded  at all (Super Bowl Sunday). I went with my wifey and we ordered the following: potato skins  five gourmet meat hand tossed pizza  and caesar salad. The potato skins weren't that hot  the pizza was a bit soggy  and I had to remind the waiter about the caesar salad.Our main course arrived before the salad. The table next to us (one of 6 other customers) even received the wrong check. Needless to say  I won't be going back there.
Alexandru D.,Anaheim  CA,5,57,7,6/14/2013,5.0,I love the pizza at BJ's  we usually get it loaded with all the veggies and pepperoni. The food has a superior taste and the service is not bad either. If you plan to take your date somewhere fun and you like pizza and beer then make it BJ's  order a pizza and the beer sampler  you will not regret it. :)
Mike P.,Montebello  CA,27,1,,2/7/2015,1.0,Came here with a large group to celebrate my sister's graduation and the service took forever. We had to wait 20 minutes for them to even come to us  then they spent 5 to 10 minutes talking to each other. Then they said the could only separate our checks by table  which is fin  but then proceeded to take sporadic orders from us. Then it took 10 to 15 minutes for either of them to return so the rest of us could order. Then when they did they still did not get everyone's order. We all ate at separate times  the waiter and waitress took forever to come around and give us refills. They were a little more attentive to us towards the end of our visit  but it was not a good experience.
Nikki K.,Chino  CA,9,3,1,1/2/2013,1.0,We picked BJ's for a birthday dinner. We went in with a party of 5 and it was packed. I was shocked that we were quoted a 35 minute wait. An hour later we still were not seated  that should have been the warning. We were seated and our server came by to get drink orders. Another huge wait. We finally ordered food. The person that brought our food to our table was about as personable as a rock. We had to ask several times to get silverware. What is truly amazing is that they said they were short on Parmesan cheese and peppers for the pizza  did I miss something aren't they known for pizza? The service was slow  food runners were rude  food was only okay and the drinks seemed watered down. Next time I will opt out of a trip to this BJ's!!!
Tommy K.,Covina  CA,7,6,,1/2/2012,3.0,We visited this location on New Years Eve  simply because we'd gone there last New Years Eve and it was so good. What a difference a year makes.We got there at 6pm and were seated right away. Service was good. I ordered the Pot Roast with Roasted Vegetables. The roast was tender just like the menu said it would be  it would have been great if the gravy that covered the meat didn't have so much salt. There's no reason for anything to have that much salt.The dinner came with 'roasted' vegetables  Celery  onion and carrots  none of which were completely cooked. The carrots were ugly looking  with lots of white lines in them.My husband ordered the Jambalaya  he liked it.
Dinora R.,Glendora  CA,0,13,2,11/7/2014,2.0,Hmm how do I start. My gf and I went for dinner for the second time since my bro had given us a gift card. First time around didn't like it. I always get the chicken crusted parmesean(best ever only reason why I gave 2 stars) . So we decided to give it one more chance and it was the worst idea ever! First of all we ordered a coke and water  we got a sprite and water. Secondly we ordered traditional wings for an appetizer they brought us boneless wings smh. When we finally got the wings after 15 min later after they brought wrong wings they were cold af. So instead we decided to go with avocado rolls WRONG!!! Avocado rolls had black avocados inside it was so disgusting yet another fail. My gf ordered limon and marinera sauce for her dinner it took them literally 14 min to bring which resulted in her eating a cold dinner. The only good thing was my chicken plate which I liked since they let me sub my brocrolli for clam chowder bowl. Never going to bjs again. It was literally and epic fail. We were so disappointed we didn't even wanna try the famous dessert (which we were looking fwd to try)
Joseph G.,Covina  CA,4,3,,5/19/2012,5.0,"I am in love with this place  Beer is excellent  yea its true you might have to wait a bit in the evening time to get a seat  but trust me its worth waiting.It would not be fair from my part if i dint comment about the customer services we receive there has noting to say other that excellent work ""love it\'Pricing is very reasonable and an excellent place to hang out with friends and family"
Conni F.,Covina  CA,0,2,,12/31/2015,1.0,"Large Family . We go out allot. Never here again! This time 8 of us went we had two kids with us. One in a high chair. It was wed. dec .30 My birthday. They ruined it! we waited along time to be seated. then hostess called us. then they seemed pissed that we asked for ""High chair"" they said no not were we were going to seat you. go back and just stand there with the kids. and wait some more. Well wait we did!! Since it was now to late to pack up two cars and drive somewhere else. we were stuck there. They sat everyone else in place. they seated groups that came in way after us. It was like we were being punished for asking for high chair. finally after complaining enough!! They said possibly they could push two tables together for us.. Really ???? This took ten minutes for them to do. !!!! They were being terrible to us. I could understand if the kids were running around or crying. They were not. (we stood quiet and waited all of us till we finally complained) It was like they forgot us or we were in trouble. Then we had a terrible waiter!!He seemed ok when he was actually waiting on us. But he left us waiting to order or get ticket to pay forever. Worst service ever!! Ignored us most of the time. and chatted to other guests while we waited for service! All around this place ruined my birthday. Ruined everyones evening! Never will any of our friends and family go there again!!"
Stephen S.,Upland  CA,0,4,1,9/13/2013,1.0,Every time I go here  the hosts and servers look stressed out and overworked. Good food  but not the environment to get good service. I'll try another restaurant nearby next time.
Joseph C.,San Diego  CA,391,201,101,2/22/2013,4.0,I got really wasted here! We came here for our co worker's goodbye party and we were ordering 1 of everything. It was insane! I felt like food was coming out every 5 seconds and we had nowhere to put the plates! There were tons of flatbreads and appetizers sitting around then came the octoberfest's brats and more brats. Right when I thought we're ready to leave  here comes 8 orders of large pizza. What?! Who ordered these?? Then comes more rounds of beer and more beer. Have you ever ate to the point where you're so full that you can't feel your stomach anymore? Maybe that might have been the alcohol! So my co worker kept saying he can out drink me and yeah  he didn't out drink me. Party party party let's all get wasted! Cheers!
German K.,Los Angeles  CA,199,120,1,7/16/2013,3.0,We've all been to Bj's before...expensive food that doesn't always live up to it's price tag. I normally get the pizza which  even though I always get it  I don't think it's that great. Ate there last night and decided to try something different. BIG MISTAKE! I asked the waitress what else is good and she suggested the Jambalaya. I did not really enjoy that dish at all. It had a monotonous taste and I was sick of eating it by the 2nd bite  but I do not like to waste food  especially food that costs me like $16 bucks so I just kept on chowing down on it. My friend ordered the garlic butter linguini pasta and her dish was worse than mine! I had a bite of her pasta and that was the most bland plain pasta I've ever eaten. Literally tastes like pasta tossed with some butter and some tomatoes sprinkled in. The chicken that topped it was good but pasta was soooooo incredibly bland. I literally took 1 small bite and would not eat anymore. Good for us happy hour kicked in since it was 10pm. We ordered some buffalo wings and lucky for us they accidently sent us a full order instead of the half order your supposed to get for happy hr. Service was great. We got a girl named Tera? and she was pretty awesome! We commend you on providing us with a great dining experience. Got myself a bday pizookie and I was in sweet  ice creamy  fatness heaven! I recommend to sticking with the pizza  soup  & salads. I don't eat at bj's too often but I don't think I'll be adventurous anymore at this place.
Aneesha M R.,Corona  CA,0,9,,1/8/2015,1.0,Horrible Customer service from the time we walked in. The young man at the front just looked at us. No greeting no smile. I had to ask if we could get a table. Then they girl that sat us did not say two words. She grabbed the menus and just looked at us. When we got to the table she put the menus down and just walked away. Our server was nice once he finally again I say finally got to our table. I will get their names and edit my post. BJs needs to work on it customer service.
Sophia E.,El Monte  CA,1,69,2,6/3/2014,1.0,I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review on this BJ's. I love the food at BJ's their Thai Shrimp Lettuce Wraps are AMAZING!!! Love  love it! Okay let's be real  the service at this BJ's blows just like the name! COME ON! The service here absolutely sucks! you basically have to harass other servers to get some sort of attention! I don't get it!! I've gone to the Brea BJ's and all though it takes a while to get your food there  the service is good.... but Covina BJ's JEEEEEEZZZZZ!! It sort of feels like you're at a restaurant that just hires people that doesn't give a damn about the customers. Where are the managers? The training? The customer service? Someone needs to reevaluate this place  crack the whip...something! I refuse to ever go here again  that's it I've put my foot down  No More Covina BJ's. Plus seriously how difficult is it to make a good Bloody Mary...yuck! Highly do not recommend you order them.
Alexis M.,Glendora  CA,125,75,,8/21/2012,4.0,I go here A LOT. I really love the food here. The food is always delicious and it is priced reasonably  Service is okay  nothing special but not bad. It can get really loud so I wouldn't suggest it for a first date. I like to go on Mondays because of the five dollar mojitos. It is a great place to hang out with friends.
Danny N.,West Covina  CA,2190,1401,46999,12/30/2010,5.0,Pizookie  need I say more?
Johnny Y.,La Puente  CA,0,19,2,12/23/2013,1.0,The service was absolutely the worst...So my friends and I showed up around 9:30 and they were not that packed  so we were seated fairly quickly and our drinks arrived shortly  and it is now at this point where I explain the downfall of the service. It took them 25 minutes to finally get to our table and take our orders  I ordered a double cheese burger  one friend ordered a side of wedge fries  and two of my friends split a regular bacon cheese burger. So I told them no pickles on my burger  so after taking about 35 minutes they brought me a single burger instead of a double  my friend a side of regular fries  and my friends a bleu cheese burger  so I sent mine back  and so did my friend with the fries  they brought him his wedges almost immediately  and I had to wait an extra 20 minutes  then they brought it back with pickles which of course I did not ask for  I asked for ranch which I never received  so finally I asked for the manager and complained  he apologized and said the burgers would be paid for  so when we finally got the check they charged us for a third burger which we never even ordered  they screwed up so many times I am never going there again  the absolute worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant...
Stephanie L.,Azusa  CA,0,3,,12/22/2013,5.0,I loooove this place! Food is always delicious and prompt! Waiters/waitresses are always nice and attentive! And to top it all off their pazookies are AMAZING! deff recommend! :)
Linh V.,Baldwin Park  CA,0,3,,9/5/2013,4.0,Love the pizookie and the food in general is delicious! Customer service is very nice  everyone smiles at you and is polite. Definitely worth the wait for the food!
Jennifer C.,West Covina  CA,2,10,4,6/16/2013,1.0,The service at the BJ's is horrible it took 2 hrs to get my food and my order was wrong. Once they corrected the order they never came back except to bring the bill. I like BJ's but this West Covina location is horrible and its always packed and disorganized with people standing around waiting to be seated and looking very annoyed. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE
Steve L.,Glendora  CA,422,56,5,1/20/2011,3.0,The food here is awesome. The Clam Chowder in a loaf is the best!! Or Chili. The Great White is probably one of the Best Pizzas in the UNIVERSE!!This place is a great place to eat and relax. Service sucks. This would explain the 3 stars! Servers have always been slow at this place...terribly slow. Aside that  this place is great.Ohh ya  I forgot. Drinks are BEYOND OVERPRICED. Typically no price on the drink menu for good measure..to get your money.
Jeremy B.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,1,,11/27/2014,1.0,The service was terrible the last time I went there with my girlfriend. It took 30 minutes to get our drinks to the table alone. Not to mention that they ended up giving us the wrong food not once but twice. We ended up ordering some desert as well for take out. When we got back home we discovered that they again have us the wrong order. We will not be coming back anytime soon.
Jonah C.,Azusa  CA,25,4,5,10/5/2014,2.0,Soooooooooo like where to begin. I had just gotten off a long day at work and was excited to grab a bite to eat with my bf and a friend. Waited about 30 minutes for a table  typical on a Friday night. Our buzzer thing went off and I was so excited to finally get seated. So we go turn in the buzzer and they had us waiting for like 10 more minutes because they gave our table to SOMEONE ELSE. Wow. K so I got over it. FINALLY WE GOT SEATED  and ordered clam chowder..it was alright I suppose. The bus boys were cleaning up the table right next to ours and they dropped the tray of bowls and cups and ranch got all over my friends boots..I understand mistakes happen but wow like I literally had to ask for a rag to help clean the mess THEY made.Anyyyyyways so were finishing up our night at BJs and I had to use the restroom before heading out and oh my word...the men's restroom was atrocious. Paper towels all on the floor  over flooding the bins and water everywhere. Usually my visits at BJs are good but that night was just terrible.I usually don't like pizookies either but I'll admit I enjoyed it 100%.Pros: the soup was okay  ran in to an old friend  server was niceCons: everything I mentioned lol
Chan L.,Las Vegas  NV,50,319,2,12/30/2012,4.0,- Typical BJ's: good service  good food  reasonable prices.
Faith B.,San Diego  CA,84,233,3,12/27/2010,4.0,Great place to watch a game. We were in town to do some shopping and we stopped off here for lunch. It was Sunday afternoon and packed! Huge football day. At least 4 football games going on. I thought it was a great vibe. Very fun and lively. The server was incredibly nice. We sat down right away  but the service was kind of slow (I'm sure because of the crowd). It was ok though since there was so much going on I didn't really notice the slow service... I should rephrase that... it didn't bother me too much because of all that was going on... but I sure noticed it. Fun place to hang out and the food was great  so I definitely recommend it!
Brittany M.,Claremont  CA,27,2,,8/18/2014,4.0,I came here with a friend on 08/17 to have dinner. We called ahead of time to put our name on the list. We arrived about 15 mins later and only had to wait about 5 mins to be seated. This BJ's is pretty busy on a Sunday night. Our server was so friendly and managed to keep his composure with it being so busy. He did a really great job. My only complaint was that my order was a tad wrong. I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and received the Buffalo Chicken pizza. No biggie. Also  their beer is so good. My friend wanted to order a Snakebite with the berry blast instead of Pear. Our waiter said no problem and made the switch. Turned out to be the best fruity beer ever haha I tried the Magic Hat #9. Really great light and flavorful beer. Besides that  I do want to make mention that the table next to us was so rude to the staff here and made a huge ordeal about nothing. After the customers being there for about 15 mins  complained to the manager about how they had been there for a half hour and that the service was horrible. Pretty much telling the manager they wont be coming back anymore because they have had to wait a long time the last time they were there. The manager apologized plus totally took care of their meals and drinks. I have to say that these customers were so rude that after the manager told them it would be free  they had the audacity to order a free dessert as well. My friend and I assumed that those customers wouldn't leave a tip so we tipped for them and left a note to the server saying good luck and that he had been doing a great job :)
Darlene G.,Bell Gardens  CA,0,1,,11/10/2014,1.0,worst experience eveeeer!!!went in with my family waited for 2 hours to be seated while they sat everyone else but us until we finally got up and asked what was going on just to hear that we were going to have to wait another 40 minutes. they didnt bother to offer water atleast while waiting they just totally put us aside felt discriminated. we spoke to the manager she didnt do absolutely anything about it. ended up leaving to chilis our wait there was only 7 minutes.
Angelababe B.,West Covina  CA,0,3,,7/12/2013,5.0,I'm in love with BJ's Cobb Salads!! Delicious and comes in a huge portion too!!!
Blossom F.,West Covina  CA,0,9,,8/13/2014,2.0,"Came here for lunch yesterday. Waiting to be seated we stood there for a good 5 min in front of a thin  long haired female with glasses who was on the phone and never even said hello  or give me a minute  she looked down to the side and to the back and never made eye contact. Finally a different woman came and asked if we had been helped and proceeded to seat us. The waitress was professional and food was good. As we were leaving I asked about the BJ\'s Premiere rewards card at the front desk and the young gentleman was looking for one  he asked a lady in a royal blue shirt and she said they were in the office  before he got back they handed me one to fill out. I stood there listening to the lady in the royal blue shirt having a conversation with another coworker  even though she noticed that I was done and waiting to give back the completed rewards card she ignored me and not until I said did you want this back? She very phony replied ""oh yes of course  thank you"".Host/es need to work on customer service."
S H.,Stanton  CA,1,80,,8/11/2014,1.0,Here for lunch. Restaurant is more than half empty... still a 20 minute wait. Oh the efficiency
Mimi A.,West Covina  CA,0,11,,11/2/2014,2.0,We were there Saturday  November 1st at about 7:30pm. The wait was 20 min. Which was not bad. Our waiter had great customer service skills. The food was good. However  the table was dirty and one of our forks was dirty 2! Yuk!
Oliver H.,Irvine  CA,41,9,,1/19/2012,1.0,This place has the worst service.... Came here on a thursday night  and was told that I would wait 10 to 15 minutes. More than 30 minutes has passed  and I decided to go ask the hostess what was taking so long. First thing the hostess says is we called you why weren't you here. Then in her bitchy attitude she expresses to me that probably the paging system is broken. Without ever apologizing for the extremely long wait  she starts to question that i wasn't in the room waiting  and that it is entirely my fault that. Then we are lead to a table  then again the second hostess realizes that the table wasn't even cleaned. Then another 10 minute wait  until I express my dissatisfaction to the first hostess  and she starts blaming me again for the wait. The food here is nothing spectacular  rather overpriced affair. I would much prefer yardhouse  lazy dog  cheese cake or other similar institutions. Bj's serioulsy needs to improve their service. Antoher time i went to a Bj's I waited nearly 2 hrs. for a chicago style pizza. Seems like no one is in charge in the restaurant.
Jorge M.,Covina  CA,371,176,129,9/14/2010,4.0,"Want to eat like a man!? Then come to BJ\'s for a delicious Sweet Pig Pizza and a Pint of Blonde (lighter beer.) OK  well... Maybe that doesn\'t sound very manly a ""sweet"" pig pizza and a light beer. However  they do have different types of pizzas (and different entres) and they also serve darker beers.If you are into pasta I really enjoy the Grilled Chicken Pasta. The combination of the chicken  sauce  and the broccoli is outstanding. If you are one of those people who watch their calorie in-take then I\'d skip it. This is high in calorie and high in deliciousness!The prices for their lunch specials are fantastic and are very filling. I tend to order the half sandwich and half salad which also comes with fries (I prefer the wedge cut fries.) That isn\'t the best part. After eating you can order a Pizookie! It\'s basically a huge warm delicious cookie topped with vanilla ice cream! The two main food groups I enjoyed while being a kid cookies  and ice cream! Yum!BJ\'s is a step up from Chilie\'s and TGIF in regards to food. Their service is pretty friendly at the West Covina location. There have been times when they took awhile to bring our food out but it\'s a hit or miss for me sometimes  but what chain restaurant is 100% perfect right?"
Javier El Feo ..,Pasadena  CA,6,233,,11/13/2012,4.0,I have only eaten lunch here. You cannot go wrong. Avocado rolls are legit. Sneak in a red and I am set. Service has always been good.
Soo K.,West Covina  CA,3,23,2,9/12/2010,4.0,"Food has always been good. Deep dish pizza*  jambalaya  turkey club sandwich-yum! Good price for the large portions.Finally got to experience my first ""Pizookie"". Warm cookie topped with ice cream. Like usual  filled up on the food  but still took leftovers home so we could split the smaller portioned one.Remember it\'s a great hang out for gameday- any game  and it gets very loud. I was there when Mexico was in the World Cup. *I have to add  I grew up on Chicago\'s deep dish pizza which does not exist in SGV."
Corrie N.,Glendora  CA,90,14,3,6/2/2014,1.0,I feel bad writing a negative review on one of my favorite restaurants. Last night I went with a party of 6 we went and sat in the bar area because it didn't seem too crowded. We started out with one waiter who was attentive and got our orders quickly  drinks served quickly  it was going pretty good! He came up to us about 15 minutes in and said since it was a slow they were sending him home. No problem  waiters get switched all the time for no reason. Our new waitress came to our table about 2 times and after 40 minutes of waiting with out receiving our food I finally asked. If our original waiter got sent home early for it being slow  it shouldn't have taken so long for our food. Our food ended up coming out right after I asked  but 3 of the 6 orders were messed up. It was really disappointing. Normally BJs service is great! Last night was just a let down. Not sure we will be back to that location. Hopefully they can get back on track.
Elaina G.,Chino Hills  CA,0,16,7,5/31/2014,1.0,Just left this location about an hour ago and the experience I had was just awful  left angry and unsatisfied! Waited 15 minutes to be seated  which I didn't mind  it was when we met our waiter JULIO is when everything went downhill. He kept rushing us to order  not everyone knows what they want right when they're seated! Sheesh! We ended up just ordering a deep dish pepperoni pizza to share  it was awful  looked like everything was just thrown on to it and it wasn't even cooked all the way! Me and my BF only ate one slice each  it was not appetizing at all! And to top it off not once did we ever get a refill on our drinks the entire time! Julio comes back and asks if we want desert  I tell him I want to use my rewards points to get a pizookie and that I also wanted to order a baked beignet. He comes back to tell me that I cannot use my points on the beignet but I can get 5 dollars off  I tell him I never wanted to use my points for that  only on the pizookie and he keeps calling the damn pizookie a beignet and saying the points are not for that! I continue to tell him the points are for the PIZOOKIE and the beignet is just being added to the bill AND HE STILL DIDN'T UNDERSTAND! I have never had a problem using my points before until I met JULIO! Even after all that we still only ended up with the the baked beignet and it was just DISGUSTING! It wasn't cooked in the inside  was completely doughy and raw! Ended up only eating the ice cream which was the only decent thing I had. I feel like I wasted my time and money here tonight all thanks to JULIO and his inability to understand simple words!
Jamie M.,Riverside  CA,5,27,3,2/19/2013,2.0,I gave two stars because not every experience here as been bad up until recently. We only had a party of six but our waiter had a difficult time checking on us and bringing us what we asked for. We came here on a Sunday around 3pm. We didn't think that would be a busy time being in between meals but we were very disappointed in the service and the food. The fish and chips were over cooked. The pizza was OK. My daughter got macaroni and cheese and when they brought it it was cold. After we waited a long time to have it warmed  it didn't taste good. I've always loved their Pizookie's but that doesn't make the $100 we spent worth the visit since the food and service was so crappy.
Joe U.,Newport Beach  CA,75,190,22,1/19/2010,3.0,I hadn't been to a BJ's in years  but I had good memories. Maybe it was just the late night pazookie runs that I always seem to think about.This particular location is out of my hood  but impressed me nonetheless. Really large space -- great for groups. I only went here because my Yowza app said I could get $5 off $20 or more  but then came to find out that it was only valid on online orders. After speaking with the waitress  she graciously had the manager honor it in-store.The new menu's have a killer lunch special. $5.95 for a half sandwich with fries and salad  along with countless other options. I really didn't expect such a deal. And it was good too! Great service and things were clean -- all I need for a chain restaurant.
Dania S.,Irvine  CA,344,81,23,8/15/2012,3.0,Good location. Typical BJ's food but they have a very nice out door patio so you can enjoy the ambiance.
Vanessa A.,Escondido  CA,0,16,5,8/11/2014,4.0,The best unlimited soup and salad for lunch. Inexpensive  and tasty. Good customer service  attentive and friendly.
Vicky T.,Los Angeles  CA,61,324,123,7/31/2010,5.0,I LOVE BJ's!!!!!You gotta try their shrimp scampi. One time  my professor asked what food would I want to eat as my last meal living  and I said the shrimp scampi! ahhhhhh I WANT SOME!
GEO S.,San Pedro  CA,12,21,,2/4/2010,4.0,The time i went with my cousin and his girl was one of the chillest times.it was 4 of us  and we all ordered the beer taster sampler  where you get 10 lil beers for about 10 bucks i think  we were drinking a little bit before so that kind of helped. The server was cool (better than the snotty tricks @ tgif's) we got our drinks in 5 mins  and the crowd was cool too. No one was there to do anything other than what they came to do.the bathrooms were clean  the food was cool and i cant really think of anything i would complain about.
Jeanne G.,Hacienda Heights  CA,0,7,6,12/9/2013,1.0,"All BJ restaurants are not created equal. This was my first  and definitely last  visit to BJs in West Covina. They have won the recognition of providing the worst service I have ever had (I am 56 yrs). I placed an order at 4:30 pm - well before any type of crowd arrived. The other people received their food  I asked for mine from server 2 who stated she would check on it. Mean time  another table ordered and received their food from Our original waitress. I stated I was still waiting for my salad  she said she would bring it immediately (my third request). Twenty minutes later  no food. In frustration  I spoke to manager Brian who said he would take care of it right away. instead  he sent yet another server to ""take my order"" (note: it has now been over one hour since placing my original order). Magic  after pleading five times to four different people  I finally received my salad at 6pm. Not bad 1 1/2 hour wait filled with all kinds of frustration and aggravation. I left feeling horribly upset and got the honor of paying $45 for the experience. DO NOT go here! Drive the extra distance to BJs in City of Industry...there the service is as good as West Covina\'s is bad!"
Bom S.,Diamond Bar  CA,20,9,,9/23/2009,1.0,"Have you ever stop by a gas station where you already know the bathroom is going to be disgusting and nasty but you really have to go so you just suck it up and go anyway.. then you feel pissed afterward? That\'s exactly how I feel about West Covina BJ\'s.I\'ve been here before and the service was soooo bad. It doesn\'t matter if you\'re at the bar or the table. The servers are the worst of all. They even talk back to you.. may be i should\'ve start my every sentences with ""BRO.."" so they can do their job right. They really don\'t give a crap. I had to drag my ass over there cus it was my good friend\'s birthday joint (It seems like everyone loves to go there for their birthday). I think if i have to go back there again is to use their clean bathroom.. at least it\'s reliable not like the shitty ass servers."
Kristyn A.,Lake Forest  CA,0,24,,6/23/2013,4.0,Their food is delicious (pizooki  anyone?) but their cocktails are awful.
Shelley C.,Los Angeles  CA,568,287,17,6/7/2010,4.0,came here for company luncheon.. not a good idea for diet food..I started with thai shrimp wrap ... then a garden medley salad... all healthy and good for my dietthen the TRIO pizzzzzooookiii came... there goes my diet.. i finished all 3 =( it was sooo good
Monique M.,Los Angeles  CA,196,182,12,9/8/2009,1.0,Yes-its a chainYes-it has standards that are guided by the health departmentYes-I should always get beer and pizzait will be like pulling teeth for me to come back to this location... i found a nice strand of blonde hair in my salad... yes a hair.. i'm asian and not dyed blonde.. it was not mine.. yes thats what i get for not getting beer and pizza... fail me.. but bigger fail kitchen @ bjs.
Carlos F.,Norwalk  CA,92,153,46,6/8/2010\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,2.0,"Honestly  great food  great beer  great environment  lots of tv screens. its just that theyve got this ""service culture"" if you will.... theyre in a hurry  sort of like their ass is itching  to get you out. i know some people are into that but Im not. Ive been here twice and both times its happened. After this laker series is over. Im finding a new place to watch the games."
Ken T.,Brea  CA,51,16,5,12/3/2011,3.0,I like this restaurant  but the last time I visited  the server had pure attitude. Thank goodness she went on break and was replaced. three stars only because the breaking server treated us kindly. P S  LOOSE THE ATTITUDE. With out customers  you make no money....
Phillip V.,Santa Ana  CA,160,44,10,10/18/2009,5.0,First time eating for a friend's birthday. They kept giving us samples and drinks but who doesn't like free stuff anyway?Waiters were extremely polite. I got to try different items on the menu  and all of them were delicious. Price is similar to that of TGIF  but the food is way better.You can expect there to be a wait if you come in the evening or at night.
Max G.,Dallas  TX,67,69,4,8/15/2009,5.0,This is our favorite BJ's in the land.Happy Hour here is the best in town.The food  the beer  and the ambiance is awesome. This is the former home of Safari Bar back in the days. Which in the 90's it was the place to go  especially on Thursday's to Voodoo Lounge being the best. BJ's has taken it to another level and kept that vibe alive.I know first-hand that it is the place to hang out on minimum days  so if you want to know where your child's teacher is at  you now know where.There is not one dish that will disappoint. The avocado rolls are a must as the Piranha Ale beer.Portions are big enough to be shared. Only con is that if you are looking for a quiet place  go somewhere else. The biggest con is the parking. It is very limited.
Ray P.,Baldwin Park  CA,0,4,,6/12/2014,2.0,Usually have a great experience here! But today it would've been nice to know when we first came in that the systems were down for a bit. We've been sitting here for 55 minutes with no food and empty glasses. Very disappointed in the fact that if we were on our lunch break we'd have left without food. Customer service very poor and tables have walked out all around us.
Stephanie S.,Los Angeles  CA,10,87,6,9/3/2013,2.0,Take out experience. Unfortunately they cut off the cub side service at some point and you are left driving halfway to Wal-Mart to find a spot because there is no parking anywhere!  Once you are in the restaurant you are left standing at the counter feeling stupid while the servers hang around the take out booth talking about how their boyfriends are texting other girls and other non work place gossip. I don't care about what they are doing at the club and they shouldn't be workplace social hour while customers stand around unacknowledged and frustrated. Really inappropriate  very unprofessional  extremely uncomfortable. The food was lackluster at best after the long wait. Appetizer was potato skins and they were fried beyond recognition and we didn't eat them. My salad was okay-but its hard to mess up lettuce. No so for my husband's entree. He ended up eating cereal. His roast beef dip sandwich was a soggy  mushy mess. From the fries to the bread all mush. I tried to save the fries in the oven but they came out greasy. This was our LAST unpleasant experience at this place.
Fonda K.,Rosemead  CA,60,248,55,3/29/2012,4.0,Service is slow so don't come here when you're starving. Chicken wings and Pizookie are delicious! I come here when I crave pizookies..
Nicholas B.,Pomona  CA,101,233,38,3/3/2010,2.0,Went to this BJ's last night with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday on a tuesday. Reservations were made early in the day for 7pm  friends arrive there at 6pm to make sure everything is ready by 7. We were not seated till 7:45pm but that was only because we had to speak to a manager. We were a group of 12 and they decided to crowed us together using 2 tables so we had to snag another unused table. It took another 20min from when we were seated to have our orders taken and another 45min to get out meals.I ordered the ANGEL HAIR TOSCANAOur delicate angel hair pasta tossed with olive oil  garlic  sun-dried tomatoes  fire-roasted red peppers  fresh basil  feta cheese  pine nuts  Roma tomatoes and topped with fresh Parmesan cheese and parsley.When I finally received my meal it didnt have any garlic  red pepper  pine nuts  parmesan cheese or parsley. Because it had been sitting so long the olive oil pooled to the bottom of the plate  so when i took my first bite the pasta was dry. I also asked my friends and most of them werent satisfied with their meals either. I dont see myself going to this BJ's again.
Jocey K.,Monrovia  CA,49,428,,3/18/2012\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,3.0,My only complaint is once I came here for curbside and called in like 3 times for my order and no one came out. This was a hot and in the middle of the day too so I wasn't happy. Finally I got out of my car and went in. The hostess acted all surprised and kept apologizing and making excuses but they weren't that crowded in there/outside in the parking lot. Idk I'd come back here but their curbside needs to get it together! The SF rolls are really good!
Jena R.,North Hollywood  CA,70,75,4,11/1/2011\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,1.0,over it.done. finito. this place should be blown up.chips and salsa never came.mini pizzas room temperature.no refills- walked to the bar to ask bartender to refill my damn pepsi because our damn waiter was m.i.a.pissed.
Steph Y.,Columbia  SC,0,14,1,12/30/2012,2.0,I like BJ's in general  but this was not the best one I've been to.Food: The food is good  as is typical of the chain. Service: The first time I was there  everything was run of the mill and relatively decent. The second time I was there  it seemed really disorganized. They served us someone else's salads; we accepted out of confusion because we had ordered some fancy salads. Then they tried to serve us someone else's salads again. When we indicated we already had salads  they went to the next two tables to my left and asked if they ordered salads. The salads were not theirs either. Then  when we had pretty much stopped eating  before they asked us if we needed anything else  someone came and stacked our plates on each other and walked away with food we intended to box up.
Dawn M.,West Covina  CA,1,2,,6/13/2014,1.0,"On Monday June 9th 2014 we had the worst experience here...of all the times we\'ve been here. We had a large party and we called earlier in the day to make reservations. I spoke to the manager to make sure they would be able to accomodate a party of 20. The manager told me that there would not be a problem and he\'d be happy to accomodate us. When our party arrived (before our reservation time) we had to wait for over a half an hour for our ""reserved"" table. At that  we had to complain to the host/hostess. We asked why was our table not ready at the time of our reservation. We were told that our table was given away to another large party. The host then said he would get the manager. When the manager came out  she totally ignored us and took an order for another party. We were finally seated  drink orders taken. Drinks arrive 15 minutes later. The waiter finally takes our food order. All our food comes out at different times  some items not brought out at all and some items brought out were cold! We ask to have the hot entrees (that were cold) replaced  we ended up being charged twice for these items  and for the items that never came out. To top off the night  we were told we could not order dessert because they were closing and given our check!! Isn\'t it customary to advise the customer that the kitchen will be closing and ask if there is anything else they would like to order before the kitchen closes???  Never coming back"
Marissa M.,Huntington Beach  CA,0,1,,6/12/2014,1.0,Been sitting here for 40 minutes at the bar  and we haven't even gotten water. -_- worst service.
Bill E.,West Covina  CA,11,34,,4/15/2009,1.0,"The only reason I am giving BJ\'s ONE STAR is because I couldn\'t leave ZERO STARS. I will NEVER spend my money in this dump ever again  and I don\'t miss an opportunity to tell anyone who will listen. I went there with my family one evening  and we were seated by the front door. As soon as we sat down  I smelled CIGARETTE SMOKE billowing in from the ""smoking area"" AKA ""right outside the front door"". Some genius decided that ASHTRAYS right by the front door were a good idea  and the smokers take advantage of them IN A BIG WAY. I summoned the MANAGER and voiced my displeasure with BREATHING CIGARETTE SMOKE with my meal  and asked him if there was anything he could do. I was floored when he simply said ""NO"". He flatly refused to do ANYTHING about it  and basically told me that the smokers had a right to smoke. I have never heard of a restaurant manager taking this position on ANY complaint by a paying customer. But I will tell you this... I WILL NEVER SPEND MY MONEY in this place EVER AGAIN. The food ain\'t bad  but you had better enjoy CIGARETTE SMOKE with your meal. SKIP B.J.\'s... TGI Fridays is just across the lot  and APPLE BEE\'S is just down the freeway. NON SMOKERS UNITE."
Andy P.,Walnut  CA,40,19,1,5/23/2013,2.0,came here multiple times  every time service is really slow. the food is always mediocre. also whats the point of putting those sticks that say medium  rare  etc. into the burger when u get it well done every time? last time i came here they left the paper separating the burger patties on the burger and served it to my friend. he didn't notice till halfway into his burger lol. he told our server and she apologized and asked if he wanted another one...yeah right...they offered a refund and a free appetizer..we got mozzarella sticks..and those were terrible (wow wat a surprise)... would be a 1 star if it wasn't for the manager trying to make it up to us about our friend eating burger paper. seriously tho  as a cook  placing the burger on the grill  cooking it  how do u not see the paper on the burger? ridiculous. this place is bad.
Leo P.,San Diego  CA,66,52,92,7/21/2009,5.0,Everyone remember their first BJ's and this was mine  so this particular location is special to me. The 1st time I went here was about 8 years ago  and I fell in love with their their beer. I love the Piranha Pale Ale  Jeremiah Red  PM Porter  Tatonka Stout  Nutty Brewnette  and their seasonal Nit Wit.I also love their Chicago style pizza  especially the BJ's Favorite  Mediterranean  Great White  Buffalo Chicken  and Spinach & Artichoke. If you're looking for an entree  try the Parmesan Crusted Chicken  which is my favorite dish.Pizookie and beer is good  but make sure you're drinking the Porter  Stout  or the Brewnette.PRO: Their draft beer  deep dish pizza  extensive menu.CON: Always packed regardless of where I go (LA  OC  or IE).
Enrico G.,Azusa  CA,15,57,2,2/27/2012,5.0,Great placr to hang out and chill abd eat
Janice S.,Ontario  CA,0,27,,5/22/2014,5.0,This BJ's rocks! Everything from management  servers  to the food! We go in for lunch and always have a great experience. Highly recommend this restaurant. :)
Alemayehu S.,Pomona  CA,3,6,,4/29/2012,5.0,Went there yesterday  on the 29th April The food took a while to get to use because it was so busy  but the customer service here was exceptional. I mean  we had three different waitresses and they were nearly stumbling over themselves to make my mother and I as happy as possible! I commented to the manager that she had an wonderful staff and thanked her as she gave us our dessert and one of our entrees free because of our wait.Really worth going to this place if anyone has a chance  same menu as all the other BJ's but great crew working at that place!
Dipy G.,Rosemead  CA,11,39,7,2/12/2012,5.0,This BJ is awesome  a few months ago we left our boxed leftover foods and came back a few minutes later only to find out that they've been thrown out  but they offered to make a new one  not half but a whole new order  how can I refuse that ? Will definately be back again  as a matter of fact  we're in here right now :)
Paul S.,Covina  CA,5,9,13,7/11/2011,4.0,Been a regular at BJ's West Covina since they opened about 14 yrs ago...Always consistant service and food. I am a home brewer for 25 years and really enjoy the craft.... sad to see the brewery is downsizing and contracting out but always a supporter of the BJ's beer line up. A brewery restaurant done right for sure!
Alejandra P.,Rowland Heights  CA,30,106,6,9/9/2011,4.0,Just here today for lunch with friends. The waiter was very friendly  but our drinks took too long. It's a good thing we ordered drinks and food together  as the food came soon after the drinks. As always  the Blonde is crisp and refreshing. I had an ahi tuna salad which was BOMBBBBBBBBBB. My friends ordered the thin fries which I did not have because I was already indulging with the beer  but I have had them before and they are scrumptious. BJ's is always reliable.
Jo P.,La Puente  CA,35,36,5,3/19/2009,4.0,I've had no complaints about this place in my book  if its busy hey you wait  there's nothing the workers can do to speed up people eating..with no negative repercussions of course..The beer is AWESOME  i've tried them all and i'm a fan of the tanaka stout and the blonde ale  really good.The pizza is thick crusted  so prepare to hear a crunch when you reach the end  it's deep dish style from the looks of it. Pizookie is pretty damned good  really cool to just show up have a small pizza and a pizookie with your loved one :)Overall  nice place to go  try to avoid it during sport seasons as it will get really loud and packed!
Liz H.,Orange  CA,38,18,12,9/22/2011,4.0,You can never go wrong with BJ's  pastas  fish n chips  teriyaki  the burgers  the Beer! Not to mention the pazookies. One of my favorite places to come to. I love the dark lighting  the atmosphere is nice here.
Mark F.,West Linn  OR,66,3,,7/26/2012,2.0,"Called ahead let them know we had a party of 14. Waited about 10 minutes for our table once we checked in. They stuffed us into the back of the restaurant between 3 other tables. The servers could not even get between our tables and we kept getting bumped.Server saw large party and thought - ""automatic tip."" Service was horrible. Had to go to the bar to get water since she was MIA. Food finally showed up - steak was CRAP - way overcooked and barley warm. Messed up salad  crappy appetizers  and 3 other orders were made incorrectly.Asked to speak to manager  he was lightweight apologetic  ""comped"" us one appetizer  and got new server. Was too late by then. Folks i brought to dinner were pissed and had a not so good time as you can imagine.Been here abut 10 times before - will not be coming back."

DeAnn O.,Brea  CA,4,42,11,10/21/2011,5.0,Felicia u rock! What a great personality...what a pleasure it was to have you as a server
April T.,Los Angeles  CA,175,13,18,10/14/2013,1.0,Came here for lunch today  10/14/13 during my 1-hour lunch break (12:30-1:30). Arrived at 12:50  sat at happy hour booth and placed order at 12:51pm with server Adam S. Ordered 2 waters and 2 BBQ Lunch Platters for husband and myself. Took at least 10-15 mins to receive the water. After 25mins from ordering the food  we waved our server to follow-up on our order since I have to go back to work soon. Adam finally brought our order out at least 25 mins from ordering. He came back so quickly  our food must have just been sitting on the counter waiting to be picked up. And what's worse is the place wasn't even packed! They can at least make an effort for those that eat here during their lunch break and have to be back within 30mins - 1 hour. I just devoured and almost choked on my pulled pork slider and had to take my fries to go. Although the slider was good  the bad service left a bad taste in my mouth. I will never come back here during my lunch break. Will call Managing Director - Jessica Simmons to file a formal complaint.
Ken C.,San Dimas  CA,2,8,,12/24/2013,1.0,We had dinner  bought gift cards and two growlers of beer. Three days later one growler was flat. I called the manager and got a rude  unhelpful guy that said tough  we don't guarantee growlers over 48 hours. We buy growlers from a lot of brew pubs and have never had a problem. This manager would sacrifice regular customers over a couple bucks of beer. Never go to this restaurant because if the manager won't stand behind one small item then I don't trust them.
Joel J.,Mission Viejo  CA,17,163,149,6/25/2009,3.0,Of all the BJ's chain restaurants that exist. This is my favorite location. Food is ok. There's nothing I stick to. But it's their beer that's wonderful.Anything from the Tatonka Stout to the PM Porter. Magnificent!
Terry J.,West Covina  CA,125,105,4,8/18/2009,5.0,I love this BJ's  its literally walking distance from my house. Every single time I have been the workers are always very cordial. With a nice little variety of brewed beer  and good food always makes for a good time whther its a date or with friends.For me the best dish is the Cajun Shrimp Pasta  which is the one of the best dishes ever. Also if your a sports fan its another plus cause obviously they have tv's everuywhere showcasing games of whatever sport.I just go for the beer (Jeriamiah Red to be specific) and pasta
Amanda U.,Covina  CA,0,7,,1/25/2014,1.0,Worst service I've ever experienced. And I am usually the one with patience that tries to be understanding to the servers and staff when everyone else at the table is pissed already. It had been a four year stretch since the last time I was even in this restaraunt because I remembered being annoyed last time. And this was by far worse. I won't be back. Not even for a pazookie.
Ray A.,Azusa  CA,12,2,1,3/12/2012,4.0,Went to BJ's in West Covina  last Wednesday with my sister and her friend. I love their avocado egg rolls  they never disappoint. I ordered the rib eye steak with the baked potato  the steak was good and cooked to my what I had ordered  but the potato was huge! The potato took almost the whole plate  lol! My sister ordered the BBQ chicken pizza  and her friend ordered the ahi salad. The pizza was good  but too much crest for my taste  and the ahi salad was great. The server was very good and we actually had two staff members attending us  but we all know why we go there...the pizookies!! We got the red velvet and it was delish! All in all it was a good and fun dinner that night :)
Craig L.,Azusa  CA,272,169,28,9/12/2011,3.0,it's a typical B.J.'s noting spectacular. It dosen't make your eyes roll back in you head like a great B.J.! It was good  you can't beat the 2 for $20 special they have. The service is good  and the drinks are aaaaigght. It's fun to people watch  and see the people that areon their first date
Ron L.,Covina  CA,4995,1336,4973,11/26/2008,3.0,BJ's has awesome Pazookie.   After the appetizers..we make an attempt to save room for that Pazookie...that's the size of a dinner plate...Totally awesome.  This place is more for younger crowd...and it's definitly a beer joint... There is ample parking in the Eastland shopping center and you will have a good time here.   I always come here for that awesome Pazookie....Ya Gotta try it.... Really...you do...Cons: The lomg wait to get a seat.      The long wait to get your food.      The high noise level
Sienna M.,Torrance  CA,0,3,,2/12/2012,1.0,My husband and I had the Santa Fe salad with salmon. I will never eat here again. I ordered my Salad to go and the girl who brought out my order was rude  she was bothered when I asked her for plates and utensils. The salad gave me an upset stomach that lasted for hours. My husband ended up with really bad stomach cramps. Maybe someone forgot to wash their hands. One star for good parking.
Patrick A.,Covina  CA,6,151,2,8/22/2011,3.0,Three stars for this particular chain. Five Stars for the company in general. The food is always hot and is always good. The service however is rather inconsistent. I've come here many times and it's usually a gamble. I've been asked to sit under an A/C and denied the opportunity to move when it was freezing. I've been given a free appetizer for a long wait by a manager. Oh and my favorite is when you get a prick waiter who warms up at the end when its time to tip. I personally believe tips are for those who deliver exceptional service typically for a large group. I've ordered over the internet a few times and it's worked out well for me. I recommend the spinach artichoke dip and the pizza which is amazing.
Anne M.,San Dimas  CA,58,83,117,7/9/2011,5.0,I put 5stars  because the service has improved immensly. I used to know that if I went to Bj's  at this location  I would have to be prepared for either slow or bad service. I had an issue on June 10  2011(night)  but I'm so happy that the matter were resolved right away. The manager was so nice. Eventhough the place was really crowded I had an awesome experiance in the end and the food was amazing. The service has improved.
Wesley V.,West Covina  CA,61,192,66,5/26/2013,5.0,The Cajun chicken pasta was delish. Love their bruschetta too.
Dr. Groovy O.,Los Angeles  CA,318,201,26,7/31/2008,3.0,Hmm... Bj's I like there pizza with only Romen Tomatoes! Yummi in my tummy! I love this place but sometimes  it just gets really really packed! Very hard to get a drink. You get your good waiters/bartenders  and your bad. Some remember you order your Delirium. Others come back about 20 minutes later when you've already gotten 2 from the bar because they took so damn long.I'm really not into there own brewed stuff but they have other choices that are great. There apps. are also great. We got really wasted here once after a quick trip to the canyons. We were already wasted when we got there so the partying continued! We had a pitcher each every round. It was horrible. : o  But very fun. ; ^ D
Michael G.,Long Beach  CA,473,681,1420,8/25/2010,1.0,my food was decent but not decent enough to get a good review out of me. i went last wednesday for my sister's birthday and had such an awful experience i wont be returning to this location ever. my sister made a large reservation and we had the entire party there on time  but we had to wait almost an hour to be seated even with the reservation because the restaurant double booked. once we were finally seated our main server in a very condescending voice informed us that if we were to order drinks from the bar we would not be allowed to consume anymore alcoholic beverages while at bj's - all drinks had to be ordered through her. this waitress was younger than i am and had no need to talk down to me and my table. once the food finally came out to us part of my meal was missing and i didn't receive a refill on my drink once. we all felt that the staff felt that since they knew they had a guaranteed tip that they didn't have to try at all. lastly my sister didn't get her free birthday pizookie and that's probably the worst part. why else would someone have their birthday at bj's?!?i have been here several times before and hadn't had an awful experience although i can also say i've never had an especially good one either. if bj's can't handle a large party like this then this should've been communicated before we all wasted are money on an overall awful experience.
Tina-Marie L.,La Mirada  CA,584,586,357,4/17/2009,3.0,"Maybe I\'m okay with BJ\'s because I always go into a BJ\'s knowing that it\'s going to be some sort of clusterf*ck. More times than not  at least for moi  it\'s been better than worse. Hence  the 3 stars. There have been ""those"" times.Tonight the wait was about 15 minutes. I can\'t believe the amount of people that just kept coming. What recession?We decided to have a pitcher of Jerry Burst which is Jeremiah Red with Raspberry Cider. YUMMY! We started with a Fresh Basil with Italian Sausage appetizer pizza. I usually order that pizza for my meal it is so good. Since we started with the pizza I decided to try something new. I tried their Angel Hair Toscana with grilled chicken. OMG! This was delish. It had sun-dried tomatoes  peppers  feta cheese  pine nuts  Roma tomatoes  and fresh basil.My husband is always craving fish and chips so I told him he needed to just order the freakin\' things already. He did and he was glad he did. He said that the batter was very good.Overall  this experience was pleasant. Not too long of a wait  and the food was good."
Jon R.,West Covina  CA,24,73,164,10/13/2008,2.0,I've been her several times but the last visit was just terrible. It was my friend's birthday party and due to the number of guests we had our food buffet style. First of all  I've never been fond of their pizza  I'm not saying its terrible but its definitely not great either. I don't mind chicago style pizza or deep dish but BJ's pizzas are pretty bland. They need to have more variety like CPK. So we had four different types of pizzas but the problem was they were slow to bring them out and when they did  only four at a time and because of our large numbers  half the group was eating while the rest was waiting for more pizza to come out. The alfredo pasta was worse than something you could have eaten from a microwave dinner of the same thing. Really tasteless and for me  I my pasta had lots of pasta that was stuck together and slighty harder than it should have been. The pizookie was fine  there's not too many ways you can ruin a desert as simple as that.Service was also really bad. There's really no excuse... if they're under staffed then that's just bad management. Drinks took forever to come out. I was sitting down and eating for almost 20 minutes before my drink finally came. Didn't even bother to ask for ranch sauce or hot sauce for the pizzas cos I knew it would take forever.It's a shame cos it was fun hanging out with friends for a birthday party but its too bad it took place on a night when BJs dropped the ball.
Daisy Z.,Los Angeles  CA,85,98,,7/21/2008,4.0,"I think this goes for BJ\'s restaurant & Brewhouse also. I usually meet the girls here for ""girls night out"" and love our heffies!!! We get chicken fingers  lettuce wraps and santa fe salad. We sit in the bar area since the wait is always long for the restaurant side. I haven\'t tried anything else  parking is a pain. They do have a/c and it gets really packed on game nights."
Lili M.,Pasadena  CA,0,57,44,9/9/2013,1.0,"I have given this BJs wayy too many chances and too much of my time and money  enough! I have never been happy with their service yet I kept a hopeful thought about them thinking maybe they\'d change. False. Last time I went  I invited my best friend for a quick drink and maybe some food if we felt like it. We were seated in a table for 4. I dont understand why they\'d place us in a massive table in the middle of the floor when there were smaller ones around and empty small booths for two people. Anyway our first server  first server. . .   greeted us and was nice. She got our drinks out promptly. Then later brought another server explained to us that she had other things to do and that the woman next to her would be our new server. We looked at her and the woman just stood there with theeee most unfriendliest place..almost rolling her eyes..!!! Me and my friend were like omg did you just see that?! Anyway so this woman was our new server and said hi and walked away not asking us if we needed anything..which we did!! we were ready to order food. It took her  i timed it!!   20 minutes to walk by..not to check on us..but walk by  when we caught her attention and was like yes?? i asked if i could order a pasta dish and she said yes. another 20 mins later she brings out my pasta scampi which was 1  burnt from the top..im talking about BLACK breadcrumbs and cheese soo burnt it was brown and all stuck together  fine. I let that slip by and totally peeled off the top burnt layer. When i started eating my food i noticed the ""angel hair"" pasta was all cut up!! Now if you know anything about pasta you know theyre long strands like spaghetti. This was mushy choppy 3 inch pieces of pasta! My friend and I were so surprised how awful it looked! Like throw up! I decided to just get a box to go and we decided to just leave. A bus boy had to ask us if we needed our check!! It was awful! Then another guy  idk who he was  dropped off our check. I mean seriously? We probably saw about 5 different people assisting us that night. No consistency. We also noticed they moved a family to a new table and started cleaning their table as if saying ""were closing soon..we gotta clear this section of the restaurant"" it was around 1045 pm. It was horrible! the people literally grabbed their plates and walked with them to another table near us! They didn\'t look too happy!!! When we finally left our paid check. We had yet ANOTHER different girl pick up our check and literally open it and look down to see if we had left a tip...she was standing right there..reading our check next to us  didnt even greet us or anything. just grabbed the check and read it and walked away. This place is a JOKE!!"
Kaylee C.,San Dimas  CA,0,3,,12/24/2013,1.0,I love going to B.J's Restaurants  and really enjoy the food  however this B.J's has the most rude and disrespectful manager I have ever encountered. He was not willing to stand by the product or help me out in any way. I will never return to this B.J's again.
Josie M.,Walnut  CA,0,7,,1/28/2013,1.0,Really bad service we were seated and had to wait 1/2hour for the waitress to take our order when mentioned we had waited a long time she avoided us as much as she could we had to flag her down to get refills on drinks. She would notice she forgot something say she was going to get it and not return we had to look for her. I called manager he apologized for the service it was my sons birthday the experience is now part of his memory
Shell S.,Hesperia  CA,20,104,339,9/2/2010,2.0,It's ok to grab a beer with some friends but that's it. Food is not that good. It's too noisy to carry on a conversation. Pizza isn't authentic Chicago deep dish. I only used to go here when I went to school at Cal Poly and wanted a cold one after class. I've had the cookie ice cream Pizookie thing 10 years ago and haven't had one since.
Anthony S.,Los Angeles  CA,64,184,1,7/14/2008,5.0,If I had to be reborn  even this gay man  it better be at the bottom of a pitcher of Jeremiah Red. A bartender would be the doctor  anxiously tending over the draft as I am released into a large glass pitcher  just enough for four pints of beer. In this elixir of bliss  I arise  my hair dripping with the frothy head of this delicious brew being nursed by the waiter who will serve me to you. There you are  still a mouthful of avocado egg rolls and that sticky sweet sauce that is all over your chin. Yes I know  you want to lick every drop of the nectar out of my glass  but alas  you must be at least 21 to get in. Remember to bring your ID  a few close friends  and a belly ready to be filled with my juices baby.(Next update I'll be reborn as a pizzokie.)
Michael P.,Dublin  CA,40,8,26,10/4/2008,4.0,"Well I\'m not a huge fan of beer  and that\'s not because of my taste. I have an allergic reaction to most alcohols  but for some reason hard cider is not so severe. The Hard Cider at BJ\'s is pretty good  and if you are into beers  there\'s a wide selection. Pizzas are done Chicago style - not my favorite style being a Left Coaster but it\'s good bite. Pasta was above your average food chain restaurant It\'s a sports bar  so women beware if your date has the attention span of pigeon with shinny objects. Open late  till 1 AM I think  it\'s perfect for a late night craving.But what I\'m really writing this review for is what BJ""s has introduced me to: PAZOOKI. OMG twuuu wuuuv at last! Cookies as big as pizzas  topped with scoops of vanilla ice cream? And your choice between chocolate chip  peanut butter  oatmeal & raisin  or massive overload on chocolate chip. Need I say more?Go now  really!"
Disenchantedone Z.,Los Angeles  CA,6,57,,7/24/2012,2.0,Extremely disappointed. I've been to three BJ's and all of the servers have given me my bill before 1) my family and I have finished our meal  2) have ordered any desert and 3) have given me my desert. My latest experience in West Covina  though  takes the cake cause my server did all three. She gave us our bill when half my families food was still on their plate. We hadn't even ordered desert or been asked if we wanted any. I put the bill down on the table  waiting for our desert. She proceeded to stop by and attempt to pick it up three times. Correct me if I'm wrong  but you pay once you've concluded your meal  right? This happened to me at Montebello BJ's but nowhere near as bad as this. This also happened in Burbank  but the server was extremely nice and said not to worry about it until we were absolutely done. And he kept his word and never bothered us. There is nothing more ridiculous than being harassed for your bill when you haven't finished your meal or even been served the desert you ordered. Very disappointing service.
Jenny P.,Covina  CA,144,173,13,3/16/2011,3.0,The only time i come to BJ's are their beers. Porter is my fave. The food here is not bad. Their salads are really good. This place is always pack starting at 5pm.
Lady-Lourdes D.,Walnut  CA,180,87,128,9/17/2010,4.0,Four stars for our server Kaitlin!!! It was crowded  but it's amazing how she got our food out so quickly. She was pleasant  and she kept our drinks filled. As usual  food is always good!
Rache S.,West Covina  CA,0,42,,7/8/2013,3.0,BJ's food is consistent  so not a problem there. Last time  however  service was horrendous. They were not that busy  but for some reason  our food took forever to come out--even after the large party that was seated 15 minutes after us. We flagged down the manager who apologized and said she would check on the food. Came out with everything but my son's fries and  again  apologized profusely. We started to eat but noticed everything was not hot--basically  like it had been sitting in the kitchen and they forgot to serve it. Our son ordered the mac and cheese--it was nearly room temp. Same with my husband's pizza and my fish tacos. A few minutes later  the fries came out. They were hot  of course--I suspect they made a fresh batch since fries don't keep well or warm up well. The manager could see our disgusted faces and asked if everything was okay. We asked if our food was just sitting in the kitchen and she said no  they just made them and came out of the kitchen (BOLD. FACE. LIE.) Needless to say  we didn't finish our food. As a consolation  they comped our drinks and gave us a free dessert. It was the least they could do. We will likely be back because it's convenient and  as I said  the food is consistent (when served immediately!!).
Cynthia G.,Covina  CA,0,10,,2/13/2012,3.0,Good aumbience. Good customer Service. Whenver i order the pasta with the chicken with it (which has been the last 4 times) my chicken always comes out burnt
Jessica S.,Pomona  CA,22,16,9,8/25/2013,1.0,I have always enjoyed going to BJ's. Love the food  the ambience and the drinks. Today was a bit different. The food was good. The service was mediocre at best  but the worst part was that I found a cockroach inside my cream soda as I was drinking it! My stomach turned and I had to spit out my drink inside my cup. My daughters were also drinking cream soda. I informed the waitress which in turn informed the manager. The manager's name is Cynthia. She looked at the cockroach leg and said she guarantees there are no cockroaches and has never seen one in the kitchen. The cockroach leg had joints and the little spiky hairs and was really gross. I can't believe she discredited the roach leg I fished out of my drink! She compensated my food  my drink and appetizer  but still charged me for both my daughter's drinks and food. They were both drinking cream soda too which I asked them to stop drinking. I just wanted to get the hell out of there. I paid the remainder of my bill and took off so I can go vomit at home. I had never been so sick to my stomach! I'll never set foot there again. I should have taken a picture of the cockroach leg to put on here!
Leyla J.,Pomona  CA,9,10,,1/1/2015,1.0,"My husband  4 year old daughter  and I decided to try BJ\'s for the first time early in the evening on New Year\'s Eve. When we walked in  despite the rather early hour for dinner  it was very busy  and there was a wait. There were tables in the bar though  so we decided to eat there. We sat down  and 30 seconds later  a young couple sat at the table next to us. While we waited over 10 minutes to have a drink order and even menus brought to us  the young couple next to us were greeted within a minute  had a drink order and their dinner order taken. They had a salad in front of them before someone even stopped by (not the lady who ended up being our waitress  but yes the one who was taking care of the table next to us) to get our drink order or give us menus. Now I understand that it was quite busy and the waitress who eventually took care of us told us that they\'d started off the evening short staffed  and I was giving quite a bit of slack because of this. Otherwise  I would have taken my family and walked out. I will say that the waitress who took care of us was quite nice to us and gave special attention to my daughter  and she did keep my drink glass full. But it took about 30 minutes for our food to come out after we were finally able to order it (the young couple next to us had eaten  paid  and the table had turned over to a new couple well before that). I ordered a ribeye medium rare. In parts  it was medium  other parts were medium well  and it was dry. It also could use a bit of salt  but a guy with a tray had taken all the salts and peppers off all the tables right after we sat down. We asked our waitress for the salt  but it never showed up  so I ate my steak as it was. My husband had the angel hair pasta with blackened chicken  and he liked it. I tried it  and found it very bland overall  but I also bit into a large chunk of something very crunchy (no idea what it was) that had a very unpleasant taste. My daughter ordered the kid\'s 6"" deep dish cheese pizza. She refused to eat it when it came out  but I made her take a couple of bites. She said it wasn\'t pizza  and I must say I agree. It wasn\'t deep dish pizza either. It was just puffy cheesy bread with a tiny bit of sauce on it. Our waitress did bring by a box for the pizza without us requesting it  trying to be helpful  saying that she was sure our daughter would want to take it home. We told her our daughter didn\'t like it  refused to eat it even  but our waitress did nothing about it  just dropped off the check that she\'d brought with the box. So we just ended up paying $5.25 for it anyway and left the whole pizza behind. Very disappointed with the level of service AND the food. We will not be back."
Louis A.,Baldwin Park  CA,0,15,5,8/9/2011,5.0,Cajun shrimp pasta is just to die for! Everytime i go i get that...always look forward eating here
Pete R.,Long Beach  CA,117,80,282,3/21/2011,2.0,Parking was horrible at this location  as I experienced at the Cerritos location also. I had to park almost on the other side of the parking lot. When I got in the location  it was filled almost to capacity  which I take for a given. I met up with my friends  who were crammed into a tiny booth in the corner...one of the guys was actually sitting in a chair sticking out of the booth. I asked the next waitress who walked by for a chair and it took her somewhere between 5 or 10 minutes to look for a chair. When I did get the chair  it took a few minutes for her to come back to take my order....I wasn't eating  however I asked for a couple of pitchers to celebrate with my friends....it was almost another fifteen to twenty minutes before we received the pitchers....I thought they had forgotten about my order. What was funny was that one of the persons at our table already had a drink  but the waitress still asked her for ID. She said something about that even though the drink came from the bar  she had to check. The kicker was when we asked for desserts  we all ordered pizookies  which I have to say was a good experience  but they handed us the bill WAY before the pizookies arrived. My bill came out to 45$  almost 18 a pitcher  hell I don't even know how much the damn thing was....I'll go back as a group  but don't count on me going there alone. I'll stick to the holes in the walls. The company was good though  and that's basically the only thing that warranted me being there.
Irma B.,La Puente  CA,3,23,3,4/14/2011,5.0,I love BJs i had a Chocolate Cherry Martini it is Delicious also The Alfredo Baked Potato yummy! Very good Food & friendly service
Robbie R.,Upland  CA,135,214,62,4/5/2011,4.0,BJ's has everything pizza  patatos  burgers  salads  crazy appitizers you name it. Really cool how they have there own selection of beer. Notcied they had a some what decent happy hour as well till 7. I don't normally get dessert but when I go here I will get the pizookie! Doesent get any better than one of those! It does get crowded so you might have to wait or try to find a spot in the bar.
Marina T.,West Covina  CA,0,8,2,9/16/2013,1.0,"The food is great but the serive is terrible!!! Went here fornmy bday on 9/13/13 and our waktier was matthew or matt. He was very unattentive n had a really crappy attitude. My boyfriens ordered a soup n snadwich plate. He brought his soup out but asked for it to be taken back till both of our meals were ready. Server had a look on his face then took it. Then once our food was ready it took another 10 mins for him to bring back the soup. I finished my drink before my meal n by the time he asked if I wantes another k was alrdy done with my food. Then my noyfriend asked if he woukd bring the bday dessert. He did but didn\'t even say happy bday to me. Then my boyfriend asked if he would sing. He shook his finger at him n stated""I don\'t do that"" and walked away. This man was beyond rude!!! Never again will we dine there. Doesnt matter how good the food is. I will not be treated that way ever! I was a server for two yrs so I know how customers should be treated!!!"
Belinda C.,Ontario  CA,7,18,20,6/23/2009,3.0,I went to BJ's on Father's Day at about 12:30ish  and was pleasantly surprised to be seated as soon as we got there. There were several empty tables  but that didn't make it any less noisy in there.I ordered the Angus Pot Roast Sandwich  which was very generous in size. Served on a toasted garlic cheese French roll and topped with white cheddar mashed potatoes and mushroom brown gravy. Also camewith oven roasted vegetables. It was delicious and very  very filling. The service was great  and I think my only complaint would be that the silverware had dried tidbits of food on it. I'm not sure if my setting was a fluke  but it's enough to make me consider taking my own silverware if I ever go again.
Lauren B.,Walnut  CA,0,5,1,8/16/2011,1.0,This place was decent. Went there with my girlfriend for dinner last night  the waitress was rude and unformed. I probably wont go there any time soon.
Andy C.,Cary  NC,84,413,913,11/1/2010,3.0,"Man  I wish I could give half stars  because this would be a 2.5  but because I like to give the benefit of the doubt to the establishment  I decided to go with 3 stars.Location: 3 out of 5Pretty convenient and open location close to one of the shopping centers in the area. I think there\'s a Chili\'s  Target  Toys R Us  etc in the area. Parking was fairly plentiful when I went.Service: 3 out of 5Bless the server who had me as a table. He tried. He really did  and I do have to give him credit. He was fairly young (probably a student)  and had to deal with the baseball game crowd  plus a huge party of 8 that walked in shortly after I did. And although it took him a long time to get my water and beer  I don\'t think it was all his fault. For all I know  management may tell all their servers to wait until the bar fulfills  oh - 80% of an area\'s drink orders before taking off. This makes less trips for the server  but the wait time is increased substantially. Food came out very quickly  however. Quality of food: 3 out of 5. Not bad. The flatbread pizzas here are consistent (I\'ve had one in Oklahoma City) across all the chains. I ordered the gourmet mac and cheese  and although tasty  they did overcook the noodles. Very easy to tell because  a)the noodles were boiled past al dente and b)the ends were singed to a crisp (and not from the cheese).Quality of Beer: 1.5 out of 5Really  BJ\'s? You try to pass off what you serve at this location as a ""microbrew?"" Let me take a few steps back here an put this in context. I  along with a few of my close friends  are fairly avid home brewers. We don\'t have cyclone fermenters  but we do have fairly decent setups that yield a consistent tasting and looking product from batch to batch. You know what their ""light lager"" tasted like at this location? It tasted worse than my first batch of home brew using the Mr Beer kit. No joke. Their Kolsch? A little more flavor  but not much better. Their Hefe was passable. Their pale ale was nicely hopped and actually had a good finish  but had the same consistent flaw that I noticed in all of the beers  which I\'ll get into. The seasonal pumpkin brew was mildly spiced and didn\'t have a whole lot of pumpkin flavor. You\'d be better off going to the store and getting a pumpkin ale made by Sam Adams or something. So why the ire from me? What did BJ\'s do that was so earth shattering that I was seriously disappointed with my entire beer experience there? It\'s what they didn\'t do  and that\'s to let the beer mellow out. Every single beer I had there had that really young almost acetone-esque smell (incomplete diacetyl rest  perhaps...) and taste. Even the pale ale  which was properly hopped and quite good  had a very unpleasant finish due to not enough mellowing time. This is a stark contrast to the Oklahoma City location  which I thought had more than acceptable varieties of the same beers I had at this location. Overall: 3 out of 5Know what you\'re getting into before you go. It\'s not a terrible chain  but it\'s definitely not the best  either. And I wouldn\'t really call this location a ""brewpub..."" More like a restaurant that serves ok food with subpar house brews."
david p.,West Covina  CA,0,6,,9/28/2012,1.0,Service bad. Drinks bad. Asked for plates for a party of 9 got 2. Mixed drinks was too sour that's all you taste for a long island. 42 mIn later to make the drInk agaIn nIce .Clam chowder with no crackers. Been an hour and only 3 items came out. Food just came out. And they didn't clean up the empty plates.food was salty and full of oil. Chicken marsala 5meat pizza was salty and all oil. Like dominoes pizza nothing but grease. Just got home and now I'm on the toilet. Geez I remembered this place use to he decent. To top it off everything was way over priced
Cliff B.,Henderson  NV,12,19,12,3/10/2011,4.0,I have been to BJ's in Houston and this was the same exact experience. Good food  plenty of choices  and great waiters. Good overall.
Marie Y.,Azusa  CA,115,154,13,1/26/2008,3.0,I like this place...really  I do. What I couldn't figure out was why the service was so slow at 11:00 a.m.  which is when they open. Lucky for me  the baby wasn't that hungry yet so I didn't have to worry about the crankiness that comes with when he's starving. I was armed with crackers and juice just in case  anyway. We must've waited about 15 minutes for our food after the server took our order. When our food did arrive  my son had the chicken tenders and happy face potatoes  which he really enjoyed. I had the BBQ chicken salad in the lunch-size  which is still pretty big. I could only eat 3/4ths of it. At least they don't skimp on the portions  so you totally get your money's worth. I'll still come to BJ's because of the food and the atmosphere. The only area of improvement needed was the service. I could understand if it was super-busy  but it wasn't today and the servers were still slow in responding.
Daniel C.,Tustin  CA,0,2,,11/5/2014,1.0,Probably my worst experience I have ever had at BJs. I did the order ahead dine in option thinking when I got there my food would have begun being made. Walked in she had me on the waitlist got seated. There was a cup with our receipt order and everything  time passed no sign of a waiter. Finally the waiter showed up and did not know we had ordered ahead and eventually saw the receipt and took it. Then more time passed it was about 8:45pm now and we had got there at 8pm. The waiter says he got the manager since our food had not come out. Manager comes out basically says our food has not been made. At this point I am pretty confused and livid considering there was a receipt with our order exactly  so I don't get how they can print out a receipt of the order but yet blame their system for not receiving it. Looked really bad on them he finally brought out the food and forgot our pazookies. They were not even that good. Overall never going back to this BJs.
Jerson David A.,Baldwin Park  CA,8,114,10,1/10/2013,2.0,waiting to be seated took a bit long but the service was very bad  took very long on drinks and our food plus took for ever for a refill ..the was the worst experience i had at BJ's...
Jason J.,Upland  CA,37,473,96,8/24/2008,3.0,I got take out from this BJ's a few months ago. This location gets horribly crowded  so thankfully we had ordered for take out.Of course  I stood around and waited behind some people who thought it best to stand in front of the cash register like they were waiting for something  and the cash register staff were more than happy to look at me as a new comer and smile like I belonged in this line to nowhere just like everyone else.In the end  I got my food and went home  and was pretty happy.Personally  I feel like the Ontario location has a little more reasonable wait range than the West Covina location.Recommendation: potato wedges seem better than french fries  and personally  I don't care for their meatballs (too much bell pepper.)Oh! and their strawberry lemonade is GREAT.
Chunk C.,Los Angeles  CA,114,107,58,7/30/2012,2.0,"Just got back from BJ\'s lunch right now and was not too pleased. There was 9 of us  and several ordered the same meals...however it took us an ENTIRE HOUR just to get our food! i mean its only lunch time its not even as busy as dinner would be and it took that long?! so of course we ended up being there a total 1.5 hours which is a way extended work lunch bc of how long it took to get our food. I ordered half sandwich and soup. They put the soup in a huge plate it looked like so it could seem like they gave you a lot of soup when in fact they didnt; what a waste of table space & of a plate! The sandwich meat was cold when the bread was warm which made no sense... it somewhat grossed me out because shouldnt the meat have been warm if the bread was? they also put avocado when i asked for none  in addition to the wrong style fries. I wouldnt say it was the servers fault because she even said herself ""they brought that out when u ordered no avocado or wedge fries"". that was pretty much why i gave them a 2 star for both food and service (kitchen service NOTserver service). i suppose this is why i have never really been a fan of BJs."
Hy C.,Oceanside  CA,2,35,,8/11/2008,4.0,Did someone say BJ??! I'd want go there right now! HahahaI've been coming here a lot during lunch time. This place get so pack during lunch time we just sit at the bar area order drinks and foods. Services is little slow  but they're very friendly waiter/waitress will do their best help you with the orders. Lunch menu is freaking awesome  order any dishes and come with $1 soup/salad. Scamp pasta's my favor dish  succulent shrimp with olive oil  butter  garlic  lemon juice and Roma tomatoes. Also my favor Harvest Hefeweizen beer with little lemon juice. Overall  BJ's great place hang out with friends and getting drunks going back work =).
Mini L.,Gardena  CA,24,28,,1/24/2008,3.0,Tried a raspberry beer... forgot the name of it... It was good but very sweet.Ordered a combination plate with mozarella sticks  eggrolls  dips  chips and spinach cheese dip.. It was pretty good. Large enough to share with 3 or more people  if you are not too hungry.Good atmosphere. Plenty of space at the bar....for happy hour and chatting with co-workers. Nice wooden decor. It's clean.
N. V.,Los Angeles  CA,30,87,,6/23/2007,2.0,I've been to this location probably three times and I always end up feeling like a crotchety old lady - it's too loud and there are too many young people. Bah.It's a chain restaurant with your standard American food and fake brewery. Big ups for the Pazookie  but that's about it.
Cleo M.,Oakland  CA,105,144,5,11/3/2007,5.0,WOW....I didn't think they made places like this anymore.There services is just amazing..............we had an issue with our table the manager made sure we got it in 30 minutes not an hour like others were getting  did I mention it was 7 of us in the party. We order the big appetizer platter that was sent to the wrong table  the manager came over and told us the problem and put the platter on the house for us. Just great....The is also delicious  I usually order pasta and I did - the chardonay shrimp pasta. A white sauce with tomator and plump shrimps - yummy. Two of my friends order the pizzas and it looked delicious from there faces - I knew it was. Another two of my friends order the meat and it was a huge mountain of food. It was very good lookin' and the other two  one order a club sandwich and chicken with steamed vegetables. The waiter was so cool  he even brought one of my friends wedges on the house. Of course we couldn't leave without trying the famous pazookie. We got half chocolate chip and the other half white macondamian nut and white chocolate chip with scoops of white vanille bean ice cream. It was good... we could have shared with more people  with only the seven of use we scapped the platter clean in a minute or two flat.I think the beers are great though I didn't try any. Our waiter was gonna give the beer speech but we didn't drink but he seemed excited to give it so I assumed he stands behind the quality of the products.You can't go wrong here.....
Sergio R.,Los Angeles  CA,137,150,93,5/4/2008\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,I always have at LEAST a decent time when I come here and always get a place at the bar. If there's no space available I just order the drinks first all whilst keeping an eye open for anybody heading out. Service can take a while but as soon as they spot you they'll head you're way.The Hef is good and a pitcher serves up 4 glasses. The pizza is delicious! Nothing beats a simple pepperoni and mushroom. For the noobs - they'll ask you if you want tomatoes on that.Great place to knock down some beers and chat it up. Mixed drinks and shots are made well too. A lot of Cal Poly comes here. Past 10 = 1/2 off mini pizza's and some other savings for appetizers and beers.
Guen S.,Covina  CA,89,91,28,5/25/2008,4.0,This place is pretty cool. It's different from the other BJs I've gone to. This is more spacious  and has roomy booths. They designed in more of a sports bar  so there's t.v.s visible from every angle. Great for small get togethers. I'm not sure if they have an Happy Hour. It's a lil' pricey. Not a place I'd go every weekend. But every once and awhile. If you like Hefeweizen beer  this is the place to go.
Rob L.,Covina  CA,2,11,1,1/23/2011,4.0,Ahi Poke and a glass of blonde beer hits the spot everytime.
Desiree C.,Walnut  CA,2,11,,9/11/2009,1.0,"I use to be alright with this place. Its chain food  so you can\'t expect too much. Yet  one night my boyfriend and I came in at a DEAD time  when there was about 10 other people in this huge restaurant. The waiter was nice  took our order and we NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN. We never got refills  he never gave us the check  and we had to bother a ""runner"" for our check  which I hate to do. Ugh  I won\'t come here again. No thanks. Oh and the hostesses are awful."
Jess P.,Los Angeles  CA,53,40,3,1/3/2010,3.0,Really good food  and the pizookies are to die for. But this place is loud  loud  loud. Good luck trying to have a conversation in here. It's been a couple years since I've been here  but I used to go quite frequently and it's always packed  so be prepared to wait.
Melinda L.,Orange County  CA,73,329,16,2/12/2008,4.0,"BJs is an all-around good brewery place to chill after work or just to eat some tasty pizza and grub. It\'s an all-American joint gourmet-ish bar food locale. It\'s one of the better restaurants in the area  right next to the mall and Eastland shopping center. Their pizzas are thick and tasty and their baked potatoes are truly the definition of ""loaded."" Their sandwiches are pretty tasty as well  such as the crispy chicken  chicken salad and the roast beef dip sandwiches. Try out BJs man...you\'ll come back with more buds later on!"
James T.,Arcadia  CA,2834,274,2515,3/5/2011,4.0,Great spot for a chill night. Great wings  pizza and beers. Never let's me down. Must orders is the great white pizza  wings and Jeremiah Red. I don't mess with desserts but can't go wrong with the Pizookie. It's a cookie topped with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream. Choose the white chocolate macadamia nut. Schend!
William O.,Honolulu  HI,0,76,,4/4/2010,2.0,Food definitely tasted pre fab  lacked flavor  was only warm at best  and is overpriced. I wanted a lunch special but was told they were only available Monday - Friday and was directed to a more expensive meal  WT? Service was slow and it took forever to get the bill paid. When the waitress had to keep apologizing you know there is a problem. The place is very noisy which takes away from your experience spent w family. I wonder if the managers ever read their Yelp reviews?
CJ C.,Chino  CA,236,18,7,11/26/2011,5.0,one of my favorite restaurants. they have a good range of food and beers. i particularly enjoy their buffalo pizza and top it off with a pizookie!
Cassandra S.,San Dimas  CA,0,11,4,9/25/2012,1.0,"We went to BJ\'s to celebrate my little brother\'s 21st bday and it was HORRIBLE!!!!! I had been there like 5 years ago and had bad service and haven\'t been back till tonight. When I called to make reservations they put it down at the wrong time and my brother called to do the same not knowing I already did and they never wrote it down. So tonight a drink was spilt on my niece  my nephew and I didn\'t get our breadsticks  my other niece never got her steak (we asked and it was dropped on the floor so they had to make a new one and never thought to let us know...they eneded up having to give it to her to go and her baked potatoe got cold waiting. poor girl only ate a salad) I had to clean off the tables for the pies that i had to ask for them to bring a couple of times to be brought then get handed all the packs of forks to pass out too (since I\'m so good at ""working"" there) OH BTW!!! did I mention that while i was cleaning  the waiters were standing around texting laughing and talking like 5 feet away  and when the guy decided to get off his butt to clean the table off (which I was almost done doing for him) he told my boyfriend that I should apply!!!! WTH?!?!?! How about just doing your job?! So much for my brother having a great dinner. Oh well... won\'t be going back. The manager did try to help but as he is helping us on one side they were still messing up on the other side. We had to just suck it up and get out of there because there was no way the manager could keep fixing the staffs problems. We probably should have got our whole meal free. However not even that would make any of our party of 17 go back. The 1 star is only because of the manager trying to help. I will be sure to spread the word."
Kakugorou Z.,Los Angeles  CA,72,63,,7/6/2010,4.0,surprisingly  i am a fan of this chain restaurant. friends have been frequenting this place since my high school days  but surprisingly... ive never eaten more than a bite of pizookie there until yesterday.me &the boyfriend went and we were happily seated within ~5mins. the place was packed  but the overall ambience was nice. shockingly so! tho i thot it was happy hour (we went at 6pm monday)  we did not get a discount on our appetizer... i guess you have to ask for it specifically? but nonetheless  those pale ale nachos were amazing! i was skeptical cus im not a fan of nachos  but those chips were nice and fresh tasting and the chili! omgg... the chili was amazing! i usually dont like things that are cooked with alcohol  but somehow this was jst... it worked.boyfriend usually get the small pizzas here  but i convinced him to try something new and he got the angus pot roast sandwich. when we got the order  i thot they brought out the wrong dish! the garlic bread was buried under the mound of mash potatoes &pot roast! but twas lovely. mushroom gravy  tender pot roast  very creamy thick cheesy mash potatoes BUT the winner was the garlic bread. buttery  garlicky  tender  chewy  and sweet all at the same time! despite being buried. LOVE.i got the santa fe salad w/ the blacked salmon. i was surprised by the decent size of the salmon filet! it was cooked to perfection and tasted rather fresh. a good deal because it was a good sized piece of fish (main course worthy) AND there was still an entree-sized salad left! the dressing was delectable but the roasted peppers were oddly sour.. yeah. overall tho  i was pleasantly surprised.being a picky eater  i hope that this time wasnt a fluke and the next time will also be a happy ending! :]
Ms. C.,Berkeley  CA,0,2,,7/5/2010,1.0,"One Star because I had to click something  and I wasn\'t going to click more than one  anyways. Great food  bad representative service - even at the door.Usually when I come here  the service is okay. I might be harsh since I\'ve been a server before and now I\'m a bartender in Hollywood.I came in here before to ask if I could speak with the manager so that I can give him/her my resume. Talked to the host who was a dumb 18 yr old girl who was brushing me off. Made her get the manager for me  and that sucked. The ""manager"" didn\'t seem like a manager  she was probably some shift leader. Fat  dark skinned  very unapproachable lady who was rude  and also brushed me off saying they were super busy and couldn\'t see any applicants (even though the place was pretty much EMPTY - esp. for BJ\'s.) She wouldn\'t even accept or touch my resume (putting her two hands up to surrender). Told me to come back tomorrow. no thanks!"
KeNina P.,West Covina  CA,68,98,48,6/8/2009,5.0,This place is awesome. Yummy Pizza. Happy hour or laker games here are great but get there early as it gets packed! Happy hour has half off mini pizzas  $2 off apps  and $1 off their draft beer
Scott M.,Puyallup  WA,4,8,6,12/28/2011,3.0,I've been to this location at least five times. This was the worst experience I've had in regards to the food. This was my first time ordering the ANGUS POT ROAST SANDWICH with mashed potatoes and oven roasted vegetables. It was served open face on garlic french toast. The first problem with my dish was the vegetables. They were carrots  celery and onion. Kinda of a let down. They were serves cold  undercooked and with white spots on the carrots and celery. Meaning they had been sitting for at least 10 min. The pot roast was dry and cold also. The mashed potatoes were so hot I burned the roof of my mouth. Maybe the cooks were hoping the potatoes would keep the rest of the pot roast and veggies warm??!! The kicker  as I moved the potatoes and pot roast aside  the garlic french toast was burnt on one half. Overall the dish was disappointing. The server was great though. He offered a free dessert for all the trouble.
Heather J.,Baldwin Park  CA,99,103,4,6/2/2011,2.0,I love the food at BJ's but the service here isn't very good. Usually it's not awful  but the last time we went it was terrible. My friends and I work with the youth at our church and every week after we meet  we go to dinner.  We went here one week and had the worst service. We sat in the bar because the host told us that would be quickest for a group our size at the time. So we sit and everyone orders. Two of my friends had already eaten so they ordered the pizookie platter to split. And one just got a regular pizookie. The food comes  but the pizookies didn't come for another half an hour at least. My friend and I had decided to split one after we ate our meals so we decided to order one ASAP. Yeah  good luck getting the server's attention. We finally order and again it takes at least half an hour. Then getting our check took forever. Granted it was busy  but my friend and I have both been servers and are usually pretty understanding but this really tried our patience.
Christopher J.,Rowland Heights  CA,175,591,420,11/17/2008,2.0,Short and quick: (1) service was horrible  (2) bj's favorite pizza was excellent!
Philippe G.,Covina  CA,574,145,148,8/26/2008,4.0,BJs....who doesn't love BJs...Giggidy giggidy...I love it here...I don't get to get wasted like back in the day on J. Red beer...but I love the food. Start with the dip and usually roll with a pizza. The Pazookie is a must....ice cream on the side otherwise you'll get that soggy cereal effect....Good service and good times are to had here....If you haven't gone  make it an item on your to do list tomorrow....if you're single  you may just meet someone..it's usually packed all night long....
Alexis C.,Azusa  CA,92,74,1,8/18/2008,1.0,** this is mostly about the service**I went to BJs for a friends bday. We had a party of 8  so you know that means 18% tip easily for the servers. I have been to BJs when my party has been 15 and we had excellent service. But man this time for only 8 the service was bust! So I order a pitcher of cider  the waitress wont let me order for one person. I dont want to sound like an alcoholic but really for friggin cider??? Get over yourself BJs. So my friend chipped in sayin it was goin to be shared. The waitress comes back with the pitcher and glasses. I hold the glass and its prickly and dirty. I tell the waitess the glasses were dirty and if we can get another pair. She gives me this lame excuse about they are just scratched. WTF??? I see food particles stickin to the glass what kind of scratch is that missy? So she hesitantly grabs another pair. I tried to ignore her attitude the whole night. They even try to bum rush us while we were still eatin. Picking up and waiting for us to pay the bill. Hey bjs dont rush mexicans we will take our sweet beaner time. BJs you are lame as can be.
Michael G.,Rowland Heights  CA,18,35,7,11/24/2008,2.0,this ones gonna be short...really bad service!awesome bj's special pizza!
Mel L.,Arcadia  CA,87,354,140,3/4/2009,4.0,"This place was rocking on a Thursday night  they had a wait to get in. I like this store much better than the one in Arcadia. It has a very ""Vegas"" feeling to it. Food was great  and the beer was fresh and cold (I had the flight of samplers)."
Randy Y.,Chino Hills  CA,23,66,31,5/21/2009,5.0,Food are amazing. I don't go there a lot  just because the food are pricey. Environment is great for all occasions. I've been there for a date  to watch a football game  and for a family dinner or celebration  all have been wonderful. Service is always good. I recommend the Cobb Salad and BJ's Fav & Chicken Alfredo Pizza. Can't go wrong with that! BTW  own brewed beer is not bad either!
Greg T.,Newport Beach  CA,879,373,1216,6/14/2008\n            \n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated review,4.0,BJ's togo girl Sarah does a great job. Be sure to tip her. Most places I've been the togo serviced basically sucked  but she made sure that I had plates  napkins  etc  etc. Sarah is giving BJ's a good reputation.... for good service.... so remember  Sarah  Good Service  BJ's.
Mike L.,Rancho Cucamonga  CA,96,1282,17,1/21/2009,4.0,went here for lunch with some guys from work. Ordered the Cuban burger and it was very good. I would order it again. I didnt care for their thick cut fries. Good service also.
Rosemary Q.,West Covina  CA,25,8,,1/30/2009,4.0,Went to BJ'S with a few friends..had a great time...had a few drinks..well i had more then a few : ) .....got to try a drink called ..( POM PUNCH )...for those whos like a sweet drink..but its a drink that sneeks up on you ..and you'll never know it..( that what happen to me...but had alot fun..).food was awsome..people work there were nice..A great place to hang out for awhile and and kick back and relax....enjoy.....
Carter K.,Azusa  CA,0,3,,10/13/2013,1.0,Horrible service. My wife and I went on Tuesday night around 6ish. Place was semi empty. It took 15 minutes for our waitress to even get to our table. She promised us a free pazooki at the end of the night to make up for the wait. Ordered our food. Food was great as usual. We waited another 20 minutes after we finished our food for her to make an appearance again. She asked what pazooki we wanted as she promised  we said the triple chocolate. Well she had another waiter bring us our pazooki  it was a birthday pazooki. Why even ask what flavor we wanted if your just going to bring us a birthday original pazooki? By this time we were annoyed and just wanted to receive our bill. Well that took another 15 minutes. We went again on a Saturday night same crap. Horrible service  typed in wrong order. And all the tables around us were complaining as well. This time I ordered a pazooki and the cookie came back cold and hard and on top of that they were out of silverware and gave us plastic spoons for our hard shell pazooki. The waitress comes to us and says sorry. I can't believe this  have you seen our reviews on yelp? They are horrible. ( the reason I made an account) I wouldn't come back and eat here lol THEN when she comes back to give us our check. She tries to sign us up for their reward program!? Lol horrible service. Never going back to this location.
J. P.,La Verne  CA,0,48,,10/1/2011,5.0,Great beer and appetizers. Love the Tatonka beer. Marguerite fresco pizza and the fresh Mozzarella tomato salad are a favorite. Take a growler home of your favorite beer. Save room for a pizookie. Sit in the bar for happy hour prices.
Sonia S.,West Covina  CA,0,9,,6/21/2009,5.0,I LOVE LOVE LOVVVEE Their PIZZA!!Fisch Tacos rockPazookie rockspastas are a little on the bland side but still decent.Ranch dressing is really good too.
Brandon K.,Temple City  CA,364,72,8,6/6/2010,5.0,of all the BJ's ive experienced  this one was by far the best. the waitress really knew what she was doing. the way she handled herself was like nothing ive ever seen. she catered to my every need... even my numerous requests for water to rehydrate myself. my only complaint was the mess. the sauce got everywhere and i needed 3 moist towelettes to clean up. even the waitress got sauce on her hands from my plate. it was ALL OVER. the best part of the BJ experience was the cookie for dessert. after all that work cleaning up... it is totally worth it to sit back and enjoy a giant cookie covered in chocolate. most of the waitresses here are willing to go the extra mile for their customers... awesome time.
Mark B.,Covina  CA,18,7,4,6/14/2011,4.0,Where should I begin... first off I love there beer they have all kinds available I have tried most of them but my personal favorite is the blonde it's a light beer but has a really good taste. We ordered the bacon cheeseburger pizza which was amazing it even has dill pickle on it which sounds weird but trust me its freakin good! I like it to cause its original considering how pricey the pizzas are here at least they have original pizzas that you probably couldn't order at most restaurants therefore I highly recommend it. We also got the stuffed mushrooms which were okay I've has better if your going to order an appitizer I would recommend the avocado eggrolls they are really good. For desert we tried the red velvet pizookie and I can honestly say it's my favorite pizookie I love them all but this one is really good you have to try. Overall I love the food at B.j.'s although its always busy and parking is kinda hard to find at this location its perfect for a special occasion such as birthdays. I wouldn't recommend it for just a normal a dinner outing because it's kinda pricey but if your really craving good food and drinks and you got the funds then go for it ;)
Stephen F.,Glendora  CA,144,11,,2/4/2009,2.0,Okay - the food here is pretty amazing...If it weren't for the fact that it is convenient  close  and relatively inexpensive  I wouldn't be eating here. Again and again  the customer service has been sub-par. If you don't mind asking four times for a refill  two times for ketchup  three times for the check  and after asking time-and-time again getting no response then BJ's is a recommended restaurant. This is not an isolated instance either. 4 out of 5 times that I eat here the service is horrible. On top of that the management doesn't seem to see customer service as a priority. I am not one to complain to anyone else without notifying the management of what I am telling you. They just don't care! You have to ask them numerous times to get a refill as well.
Christopher C.,Arcadia  CA,1489,271,57,9/25/2007,3.0,"I still can\'t help laughing whenever someone mentions getting ""BJ\'s"" for happy hour (yes I have a dirty mind I know)...Regardless of the interesting name  this chain of restaurant/breweries are all over Southern California and I\'ve been a repeat customer for years. Each one varies by the crowd it attracts  but the one in Covina seems to favor a mixed bunch. On any given Friday or Saturday night  you get the 20-30 something age group crowd of fairly attractive people all looking to get drunk and perhaps grab something to eat in the process. I usually start off with a tall glass of hef or if I\'m really craving a beer  then it\'s Jeremiah Red for me. 3 of these and I\'ve got a good buzz going. As far as food  I stick with appetizers which is usually nachos  chicken wings  or fries...although I highly recommend the barbecue chicken deep dish pizza! YUM! Oh  and a BJ experience *snicker* isn\'t complete without ordering a pazookie! A pawhat now? For all you newbies  a pazookie is a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie about the size of a dinner plate  topped with vanilla ice cream....every dieter\'s nightmare  but oh sooooo good! Almost as good as a real BJ....ok maybe not  but pretty damn close. =) Gotta try it folks...But I\'m only giving this place a 3 star cuz bar service is pretty slow  as well as table service on busy nights....and when you\'re hungry  slow service is grounds for someone going postal. I like this place though....great for big groups and for happy hour. nuff said."
Lisa L.,Los Angeles  CA,145,118,,1/28/2010,3.0,i'll give this place 3 stars for the food. their service can be bad at times especially on big game nights. try to go during lunch  good specials.
sarah i.,Oakland  CA,59,200,,7/3/2007,3.0,BJs started the insane explosion of middle-to-high end chains in WC. We always had a lot of chains here - TGIFs  Applebee's  Chili's - and then we suddenly reached a tipping point where seriously  the chains just exploded - now we even Hooters. I mean  who puts a Hooters in WEST COVINA???!!!! Anyway  now we even have a CPK (who puts a CPK in WEST COVINA???!!). But BJs started it all. You can't go wrong with a BJs pizza. The waits here are insanely long  though.
Joe G.,Santa Ana  CA,0,3,,9/14/2006,4.0,I have no idea what the hell Andrew D. is smoking!BJ's has pretty good food  a nice selection  great deep dish pizza and a really good microbrewery. Can't go wrong with a BJ's famous  a pitcher of porter  red  or hef!
D V.,Whittier  CA,8,121,,3/3/2008,5.0,Love the Cider  Food and ESPECIALLY the Pizookie. Order the Pizookie and BJ'S donates a portion of all Pizookie sales to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.
Jocelyn V.,West Covina  CA,64,11,3,4/24/2010,3.0,Went here for to have dinner with a friend. The place was packed like any other BJ's I've been to. Luckily  we did not have to wait that long for a table. Our server was really friendly (I think he was checking out my friend). Got our drinks right away. I got an Arnold Palmer (half lemonade  half iced tea) and my friend got the Strawberry Lemonade which in his opinion was very sweet. For appetizers  we got the Spinach Artichoke dip which was really good. It was smooth  creamy and nicely blended. I usually get the BBQ Chicken deep dish pizza but thought I should try something else. So we got BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza for the main course. It has meatballs  Italian sausage  pepperoni  green bell peppers  onions   tomatoes and mushrooms. It was good  over par  though I expected more meat and cheese in it. Tasted better with lots of crushed red peppers and ranch. Got full right away after a slice so we had to skip dessert.
Andrew D.,Glendora  CA,8,24,10,2/22/2006,2.0,It a meat market. Their food isn't that good so there has to be another reason people go. I guess if your in to micro brew beers they are suppose to be pretty good. I have also received some of my worst restaurant service ever in this BJ's
Neville D.,Phoenix  AZ,6,12,1,7/17/2007,5.0,if you haven't been to Bjs  gobeer is amazing  piranha pale ale is fav(if you like bitter beer) or the hefeweizen is goodtheir Pizza is the bomb  bbq chicken  spinach & artichoke  or blackened chicken are all good. you really cant go wrong with any of their specialty pizzas. haven't tried any of their other foodand the pazooki is a must trydefinitely a 5outof5stars
Steven A.,Baldwin Park  CA,0,1,,5/6/2008,4.0,Been here on Friday & Saturday nights  and I always order in the bar area. It gets crowded here for dinner  lots of people  so sometimes it can be quite a wait. They have a good service and of course good brew. It can get quite loud at times  but that doesn't bother me. This is a great place to socialize with friends..
Shelley L.,Hacienda Heights  CA,13,21,,3/18/2009,4.0,Went here last month for my brother's birthday. We were a little late (not my fault) so when we got there my family had ordered the avocado rolls appetizer plate. To my surprise  they were really good and had a yummy dipping sauce. So me and my brother decided to order pizza and we actually agreed on the same kind. Buffalo Chicken pizza. It was the best of both worlds. It was a deep dish style pizza that came with wing sauce in place of regular tomato sauce. It also came with ranch dipping sauce. DELICIOUS!!!! It was like eating buffalo wings and pizza all at the same time. Loved it! To then top it off  I ordered my favorite  the white chocolate chip macadamia nut pizzokie. If it is your birthday they will bring you one with a candle in it. Pizzokies are one of the best deserts ever! Hot cookie + ice cream = HEAVEN!!! Oh  I can't forget to mention my fav drink here  the berry cider. PINK BEER  so good. Usually not a beer drinker  but I will order this every time I come here.
Olivia Q.,Montclair  CA,1,3,,4/13/2009,2.0,I can understand the wait to get seated but it's usually all down hill from there. What is up with the customer service? I can never seem to get any of my requested condiments  I can't say never they usually come at the end of my meal. The appiezters usually come with my food or after my meal is half way done  I'm pretty sure they're suppose to come before my meal. The food is good and I love the beer selection but because of the customer service  I won't be back anytime soon.
