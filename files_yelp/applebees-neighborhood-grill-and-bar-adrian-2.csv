Shelby B.,"Lincoln Park, MI",137,3,,5.0,10/25/2017,My boyfriend and I love this location! Always super nice to us! (Other locations not so much) but it's our perfect way to escape college life and go to a place we both can agree on!! Also Molly is the best! We usually get her and we can't find one thing that we would say we dislike !!!!
Nic W.,"Adrian, MI",32,45,178,3.0,7/4/2016,"I have frequented Applebees in Adrian several times through the past several years. At times eating there several times a week for both lunch and dinner. Through the past few years there has been a change in management and wait staff. The one thing that keeps me coming back is the fact I have a couple favorite appetizers. I have lowered my expectations of service to just a self serve. Several times I have better luck getting my own refills at the bar. When food is slow or comes out wrong the wait staff or manager (if you see the manager) has an excuse, short staffed, just cut staff and then we got busy.  I feel that their poor planning should not ruin my experience. Their food is very inconsistent especially their steak.   **UPDATE** I submitted the above review yesterday. I was contacted today by the GM Michael P. in regards to the above review. I think it's awesome that he reached out and was genuinely wanting to hear the issues and wants to improve service at his restaurant. It's one thing to see these reviews but it's another to try to reach out and dig deep on what's going on and I feel he went above and beyond. Thanks Mike for reaching out. This type of customer service is hard to come by these days!"
Scott D.,"Ypsilanti Township, MI",4,9,19,1.0,11/20/2016,Ok here we go walked out after 25min they told us a 20 min wait then the was seating a party of 6 the same as use when we ask what was the deal with that they said The party is 6 named Todd was there before us. Well hostess you are in a small town and I know that party that that you took from the bar and I know Todd and they walked in 15 min after us  And I do know they are regulars there wonder if that makes a difference apparently it does   And then I get a message for me to contact the manager I think not he can contact me
Barb F.,"Adrian, MI",0,1,,5.0,8/23/2017,"Service was great. Everything was delicious! I love their apps especially, the wonton tacos. Could eat them everyday!"
Stephanie J.,"Adrian, MI",59,9,,3.0,11/27/2016,"Interesting. I wanted to leave a review on our experience tonight and found my review from three months ago explaining the food has been lacking, even down to sprinkling seasoning on their awesome pretzels.  Well, tonight was no different.  Our service was awesome and we ordered pretzels to start and they arrived with zero seasoning as well as being VERY underdone. Our waitress agreed and took them back and quickly brought us a new batch. Exact. Same. Problems. So, we put them to the edge of the table and told her (now that our other food was in) that we didn't want to try getting them cooked again.   She apologized and brought the gm (Mike) over who is always helpful. He even offered to make them for us. However most of his talk to us made us feel like we just must like them over done and suggested we ask them to be dropped longer when we come in next time. These were clearly not cooked all the way theough, you could tell by the elasticity of the dough and it's denseness.  The biggest issue for me then arose when another waitress mentioned they were getting complaints yesterday about the pretzels being undercooked as well. Overall service was kind and accommodating. Just unfortunately the food dropped the ball."
Dirk R.,"Portland, MI",160,8,1,5.0,5/26/2016,"Good times, great tv view-ability for the games. Typical chain on the food front but relatively reliable, 1/2 off app after 9."
Linda S.,"Adrian, MI",0,24,1,2.0,12/2/2016,Ordered a salad and beer. Asked waitress for a glass for my beer she never brought me one. My husband had to get up and ask another staff member to get me a glass. My salad had very and I mean very little lettuce the rest was all crunchy lo me in noodles. The waitress did not come to check on us until we were done . Found service poor along with food.
Steven S.,"Adrian, MI",14,10,,1.0,7/9/2016,I guess if you like reheated pre packaged microwaved food with poor service than here you go
Lauren H.,"Manitou Beach, MI",0,4,,1.0,12/16/2016,"Awful. Our waitress was awful. I was a part of a large group which we called ahead for. When we arrived, they proceeded to tell us that they had sat others before us and it would be an hour and a half wait. We refused and say separately. When we were seated, our waitress Jessica was absolutely horrible. She was rude, short, and was far from having any hospitality. She threw a fit after my group wanted to pay separately and refused to take our money."
J K.,"Tecumseh, MI",0,25,,3.0,10/27/2016,"I like Applebee's. When I can afford it. When I take my daughter there, who is a vegetarian, there is always a lot of arguing over there being very little for her to eat. She's not a fan of just salads and cheese sticks or french fries. Because of that and because their prices are pretty high, I can't get out of there for less than $30 for two people having a meal and a soft drink. Although their food is pretty good, the atmosphere is sports bar type with loud music and lots of screens showing sports. Not exactly my cup of tea. Or my daughter's."
Emily D.,"Hillsdale, MI",24,50,72,1.0,12/15/2015,The only reason why I'm even giving this place a star is because the host was nice and quick at seating. We've been here almost an hour. She came and gave us a refill and didn't pick up our appetizer plates or dirty glasses and there's no sign of her. Beyond irritating watching people get food and drinks while we sit here with dirty plates and cups on our table.
Maria M.,"Adrian, MI",0,11,,3.0,3/31/2016,Like the half price apps. And $6.00 burger night is a good deal. I think the Adrian apple bees is much nicer than most Applebee's.
Aiden Z.,"Adrian, MI",0,1,,1.0,3/22/2016,"Their food tastes as if they took salt, colored it, then shaped it into what looks like food."
Ayhem M.,"Detroit, MI",0,153,64,5.0,11/9/2011,"I wish I could give this Applebees 10 star's!! While attending Siena Heights University, this was kind of the ""hang-out spot"", especially after receiving your work-study paycheck-lol. I miss BIG BOB so freaking much!! I loved how he would come over to my table, and talk to my friends and I about his wife and her limo driver boyfriend. Until this day I do not know if he was being serious or joking, but whatev.. I still loved going there nontheless.  I will be honest about the service, yes, it was ""iffy"" but since we all went there to drink and get the 1/2 off appetizers anyway (atleast when we were 21 that was the main reason) I did not mind the service!! We were always groups of 10 or more anyway; sometimes more depending on who you saw was already there!! Compared to other Applebees in my area (Northville, Westland, Farmington Hills) this one is by far the best!! It was just the atmosphere that I will always be drawn to. :)"
Rose G.,"Clinton, MI",0,4,,1.0,2/15/2016,"We were seated instantly.  However, our waitress did not show up for almost 15 minutes.  By then we knew what we wanted to order.  We placed our order and waited another 10 or more minutes for our drinks.  I almost left.  We ordered a water and a diet soda.  Not complicated!  The place was not busy.  (It was a Monday night.)  There were plenty of servers, too.  I must say that our steaks were perfectly cooked - kudos to the cooking staff.  We had to ask twice to get drink refills.  At $3.50 for a soda, I expect a refill or two.  I will not be returning to this Applebees, nor will I be recommending it.  In fact, I will steer people away.  No excuse for such inattentive service.  It does not take that long to bring drinks to a table.  In addition, the manager did not come to our table to ask how we are doing as I have experienced at other Applebees.  Just poor."
Jason W.,"Mason, MI",0,3,,2.0,2/27/2015,"Took my niece here for her birthday.  Put our name on the list.  Was the second person down.  They seated 5 couples before us that arrived after us.  When we sat down we placed our order, the waitress was very polite and let us know the kitchen was really behind and apologized to us for the issue at the door.  Food actually came out quickly but portions were really small for the price...  Last time we came here they seemed a lot bigger."
Elizabeth R.,"Adrian, MI",2,20,8,3.0,10/14/2014,"Service was ok at best. It was a little slow. I received a kids cup of Sprite complete in styrofoam with a lid and I'm 33 years old! Haha! Seriously! We ordered a sampler platter and it was your basic fried food. Our kids had chicken tenders/fries. I had the tomato soup/grilled cheese and hubby had a burger. Nothing was tragic, but nothing spectacular. I was reminded why we only go there once in a blue moon. We just happened to be shopping near there and didn't want fast good, but ultimately it was the same. Kids behaved so that was a bonus! Haha!"
Nicole W.,"Blissfield, MI",0,3,,5.0,1/8/2015,"Went in with the kids for lunch while shopping.  The bartender was way nice, split a virgin daiquiri for the kids, split the fish and chips for us, it was great.  Food was well timed, and yummy.  I can't wait to go back."
H K.,"Adrian, MI",2,325,174,3.0,6/20/2015,"I have to say this Applebee is pretty solid.  Chicken tenders are at best okay more like poor-super dry, right out of freezer section.  But other menu items are good.  My fav is the fiestalime chicken.  Wait staff is very attentive, obviously inventives for up-sales."
Beth H.,"Ann Arbor, MI",287,892,1038,2.0,6/4/2012,"We have come not to expect much from the food at this Applebee's but there is no excuse for the bad service.  Lacked the skills to prioritize his time between tables and wasn't very bright when we were asking questions. thankfully, someone else brings out your food when ready, or we might still be waiting for it."
Jeff S.,"Adrian, MI",0,1,,2.0,6/21/2015,We went for fathers day and we love applebeez food. Our server kristin did great but i did not like how it took 40 mins to get our food though we understand it was busy but it got us upset when we saw some people came after us and got their food before us..i just hope it will never happen again it was horrible experience.
Rob S.,"Adrian, MI",0,9,,2.0,3/20/2015,"Surprised my daughter at college for lunch. Waitress was friendly and took our orders promptly, 40 minutes later no food. Waitress apologized for kitchen ""messing up"" and brought out my entree but not my daughter's. Manager stopped by to apologize for the ""error with the order"", when I questioned her she said our entree was sent to the wrong table.  I asked her to take my entree back to warmer until my daughter's was ready, took about 5 more minutes (my entree would have been sitting on our table for 10-15 minutes before they brought my daughter's food).  Food was very good and cooked to order.  Waitress brought check, stating they had ""paid for our meal"" and apologized for ""kitchen that is just messed up today"" but stated she would leave the check ""in case we wanted to leave a tip"". I would have tipped had she been professional enough to straight up tell us there had been a service error and not kept blaming the kitchen and/or begging for a tip"
Erin B.,"Portland, ME",41,101,36,4.0,9/12/2012,"Im glad to see they've updated and improved their menu.  The food was good, the service was great.  I'd go back."
Angela D.,"Adrian, MI",32,113,10,1.0,3/11/2014,"My husband says we can never go back.  Ridiculous lousy service. My husband and son took me here for my birthday. Once again they were out of pinot grigio wine keep in mind they only carry three varieties of white wine I settled for chardonnay.  I ordered a bottle server said she didn't think they sold it by the bottle. Ok whatever. My husband told the server it was my birthday when we sat down. We ordered and after quite a wait we ate. We sat for at least 10 minutes waiting for our waitress to come back to clear a plate or ask if we wanted dessert. Eventually the manager stopped by to pick up our plates and asked if everything was ok we said fine reluctantly when he asked if we were sure my husband said he didn't want to make a fuss but he was not thrilled with our waitress the manager says to my husband well I need feedback I won't say anything to her but what specifically was the problem ?  My husband preceded to tell him about how we had been waiting for some time for a check or for our waitress to return to ask us about dessert and that he had let her know it was my birthday.  He says oh I think she's working on that now. Then proceeds to walk over to our waitress at the waitress station and key something in the register. About 10 long minutes later my brownie bite, ooh how impressive, arrives and the waitress tells my husband in a joking manner you ruined my surprise. Um really the fact that applebees gives you a one dollar dessert on you're birthday is you're big surprise. My husband was so embarrassed and upset about being called out like that. It was awkward and ridiculous for the manager to not see that we can see what's going on.  We will not be back and in a town with only 3 decent sit down places to eat that's saying something."
J I.,"Adrian, MI",0,6,6,4.0,7/8/2010,Tina the Bartender is back.  I am removing my bad review and returning to Applebees after an extended absence. Updated May 2011
Abby Z.,"Palmyra, MI",0,2,,1.0,9/8/2015,"Where to start.. this beyond was the worst experience at a restaurant ever. The hostess was so pushy to have us sit at the bar i felt uncomfortable then when we finally got to a booth out waitress was so rude and awkward. My boyfriends steak was cooked bad. He asked for medium rare. It was cooked all the way through he said it tasted like they had cooked it warmed it up in the oven stored it in the fridge and heated it in the microwave. Not to add he got sick from the food while we were waiting for the check. And was sick the rest of the day. When the waitress brought my food she looked at me and said, ""oh, do you want mustard""... like really? Just rude and awkward the whole time, yet I could hear her behind us acting so different to other guests.oh we also got a ""soo, do you want dessert or your check"" in a rude tone like she was kicking us out. I know i know it was labor day but it wasnt even that busy we just wanted a nice lunch and instead got a shit show and sick. Such a waste of 50 bucks we will never be going back."
Jason S.,"Adrian, MI",4,10,,3.0,4/30/2009,I have to admit that I am hard pressed to give this place more then 3 stars because it is a huge chain that everyone knows about. I will say that on MOST nights the service here is pretty good and on Sunday - Thursday after 8:30pm the half off appetizers and drink specials are a big draw for the two colleges and locals alike.  If you like Applebee's you'll be happy with this one and if you've never gone to Applebee's I would like to welcome you from out under your rock.
Wes V.,"Adrian, MI",0,9,,1.0,1/21/2012,You'll feel like a king because you'll have ten different staff members waiting on you. Food is chain fair... straight out of a microwave. Every little thing costs extra.
